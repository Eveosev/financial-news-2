low after the company said yesterday a planned new tax on phone
calls may have an impact on its dividend.  The stock slid 0.7 percent to 462 forint in Budapest, the
lowest closing price since Bloomberg started tracking the stock
in 1997. Magyar Telekom lost 5.7 percent this week and is down
11 percent from the end of last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
