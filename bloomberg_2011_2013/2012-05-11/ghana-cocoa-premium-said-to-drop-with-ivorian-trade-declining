The premium paid for cocoa from
 Ghana , the second-largest producer, fell in the past two weeks
as higher prices for nearby delivery encouraged sales, according
to three traders with direct knowledge of the sales.  Ghanaian beans in the European market cost 75 pounds ($121)
to 85 pounds a metric ton more than futures on NYSE Liffe in
 London , according to the traders, who declined to be identified
because they’re unauthorized to speak to the media. The premium
was 85 pounds to 90 pounds on April 27.  Cocoa futures for May delivery are 14 pounds a ton more
expensive than the July contract,  data  on Bloomberg show. That
means traders have less incentive to store beans. The contracts
moved into the so-called backwardation yesterday.  The premium in  Europe  for Ghanaian beans from the next crop
starting in October was unchanged at 90 pounds to 95 pounds a
ton, the traders said.  There was little trading of cocoa from  Ivory Coast  in the
European market because the mid-crop, the smaller of two annual
harvests that usually starts in April, is delayed, according to
the traders. Harvesting will start “soon,” the International
Cocoa Organization said in a report this week.  Ivorian beans from the new season were trading in Europe at
a premium of 55 pounds to 85 pounds depending on the shipment
period, three traders involved in the sales said.  Cocoa for July delivery fell 0.2 percent to 1,539 pounds a
ton on NYSE Liffe today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
