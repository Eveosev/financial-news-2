Investors should favor regional banks
over the largest financial companies because of prospects for
increased regulations, said Jason Trennert, chief investment
strategist at Strategas Research Partners.  “We’d rather stick with more regional banks that are doing
the real lending, than the big money-center banks that are going
to have some regulatory overhang for quite some time,” Trennert
said in a radio interview today on “Bloomberg Surveillance”
with  Tom Keene  and Ken Prewitt.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer  Jamie Dimon 
said yesterday that the firm suffered a $2 billion trading loss
he attributed to “egregious” failures in a unit managing
risks. Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President  Richard Fisher 
said large U.S. banks need to be split apart because they
operate with an implied government safety net that imposes their
risks of failure on taxpayers.  “You want to be in places that are in more traditional,
agency-type, utility-type financial activities,” Trennert said.
“You want to avoid companies that have relied a lot on
principle transactions to spur their growth because the
regulatory environment is such that it’s going to be very
difficult to do that, notwithstanding the risk that’s involved
in it.”  Shares of  JPMorgan (JPM) , the largest and the most-profitable
bank, dropped 7.4 percent to $37.74 at 12:39 p.m. in  New York ,
the biggest decline since Aug. 8 on a closing basis.  To contact the reporters on this story:
