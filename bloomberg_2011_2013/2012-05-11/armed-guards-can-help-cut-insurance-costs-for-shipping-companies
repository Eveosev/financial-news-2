(Corrects war risk additional premium in fifth paragraph
of story published on May 11.)  Insurance costs to pay ransoms if
vessels are hijacked by Somali pirates can be reduced by 75
percent if ships employ private armed guards,  Seacurus Ltd. 
said.  The London-based marine insurance broker cuts its premiums
by that amount, or more if additional security measures are
taken on board vessels transiting a high-risk area, Nick
Maddalena, company director, said yesterday.  If owners employ four armed guards, kidnap and ransom
insurance rates fall to about $4,500 from $15,000 for a large
tanker’s single transit, Maddalena said, adding about 20 percent
of all ship owners buy the coverage.  Piracy attacks rose to a record off the coast of Somalia
and  Indian Ocean  last year, an area of sea larger than
continental U.S. through which 42,500 vessels sail each year.
Owners paid $160 million in ransom payments in 2011 and $79.8
million in 2010, according to figures from the European Union
Naval Force and Broomfield, Colorado-based non-profit One Earth
Future Foundation.  Kidnap and ransom insurance is optional, on top of premiums
charged by other providers when ships travel through designated
high-risk piracy areas, Maddalena said. The additional premium
is typically 0.04 percent of the ship’s value, he said at the
Tradewinds Marine Risk Forum in London.  Additional premiums for very large crude carriers, tankers
that ship 2-million barrels of oil, are reduced by 60 percent to
$11,200 per transit from $28,000, if shipowners take out kidnap
and ransom insurance, Maddalena said.  The insurance pricing arrangements mean the price arbitrage
can save some larger, more expensive ships, such as liquefied
natural gas carriers, as much as $15,000 in fees for each
journey, Maddalena said.  Teams of armed guards cost about $60,000 for a crossing,
Roland Hoeger, managing director of Hamburg-based shipping
company Komrowski Group, said at a conference on April 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
