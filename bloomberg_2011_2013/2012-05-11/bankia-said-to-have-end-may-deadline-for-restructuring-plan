Bankia (BKIA)  group’s new management will
have an initial deadline of the end of the month to present a
restructuring plan including additional state support after
 Spain  nationalized the lender, a person familiar with the matter
said.  Bankia’s parent, BFA, was nationalized on May 9, giving the
state control of Bankia with a 45 percent stake. The lender must
carry out a full independent audit before deciding what
additional funds it needs, said a second person familiar with
the plans, who also declined to be identified because the plan
isn’t yet public.  Bankia group is the nation’s third-largest lender with more
real estate on its books than any other Spanish bank and its
nationalization adds momentum to Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy ’s
efforts to overhaul the industry. The Cabinet today is set to
approve a second package of measures aimed at strengthening
banks and allowing them to offload real estate into separate
vehicles, Rajoy said on May 7, when he acknowledged for the
first time he may use public funds to save banks.  Spokesmen at the Economy Ministry and Bank of Spain
declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
