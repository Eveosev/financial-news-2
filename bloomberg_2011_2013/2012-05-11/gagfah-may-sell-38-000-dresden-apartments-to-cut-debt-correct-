(Corrects Charlton’s title in first paragraph of story
published yesterday.)  Gagfah SA (GFJ) ,  Germany ’s biggest
residential landlord, may sell its 38,000 apartments in Dresden
to help pay debt due next year, Chief Executive Officer Stephen Charlton said.  “That’s a portfolio we clearly have to do something about,
and that something could be refinancing or selling,” Charlton
said on a conference call today. “We have not decided to sell,
we’re just considering that as one of a number of
possibilities.”  Dresden is Gagfah’s biggest market, accounting for about a
quarter of the total portfolio value, or 1.8 billion euros ($2.3
billion), according to the company’s website. The properties
belong to Gagfah’s Dresden Woba unit, which bought them from the
local government in 2006.  Gagfah, controlled by  Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG) , has
about 3.3 billion euros of debt maturing next year. First-
quarter net income declined to 11.2 million euros, or 5 cents a
share, from 24 million euros, or 11 cents, a year earlier, the
Luxembourg-based company said in a statement after the market
closed yesterday.  Gagfah was down 0.8 percent at 6.73 euros at the close of
trading in Frankfurt. The stock has fallen 14 percent over the
last 12 months, giving company a market value of about 1.49
billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
