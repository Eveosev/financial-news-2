NFI Empik Media & Fashion SA (EMF) , a
Polish retail group known as Empik, may continue to be traded on
the  Warsaw Stock Exchange (GPW) , Maciej Dyjas, the chief executive
officer of Eastbridge Group told Rzeczpospolita.  Luxembourg-based Eastbridge Group together with Penta
Investments Ltd., a private-equity group based in central and
eastern Europe, plan to increase their stake to 75 percent in
Empik.  “Withdrawing Empik from the Warsaw bourse will be
discussed with minority shareholders, but delisting is not
absolutely necessary,” Dyjas was cited by Rzeczpospolita as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
