Piraeus  Port Authority  SA (PPA),
which operates  Greece ’s biggest port, said containers handled at
Pier I in the first quarter rose 46 percent from a year earlier.  The pier handled 166,000 twenty-foot-equivalent units
(TEUs), up from 113,990 in the first quarter of 2011, the
authority said in a  statement  on its website late yesterday.  Container traffic was boosted by the MSC Eva, one of the
world’s largest container ships with a carrying capacity of
14,000 TEUs. The vessel is owned by Switzerland-based
 Mediterranean Shipping Co. , the world’s number two container
line, according to the statement.  Greece plans to sell its 74.5 percent stake in PPA this
year as part of a program to sell state assets and redevelop
real estate to boost public revenue. The port’s Pier II is run
by Piraeus Container Terminal SA, a unit of  Cosco Pacific Ltd. (1199) ,
which will build a Pier III.  To contact the reporter on this story:
