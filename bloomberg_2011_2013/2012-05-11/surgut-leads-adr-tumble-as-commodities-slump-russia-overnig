Russian stocks  traded in New York
posted the longest run of declines since at least 2005 after
commodities erased this year’s gains and oil retreated for a
second week.  The  Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  of the most-traded
Russian companies in the U.S. dropped for a 10th week, losing
0.4 percent to 94.03 yesterday. Futures expiring in June on
Moscow’s dollar-denominated RTS Index fell 0.7 percent to
143,030 yesterday.  OAO Surgutneftegas (SGTPY) , Russia’s fourth-largest
oil producer, retreated for an eighth day, widening the discount
versus the Moscow shares by the most since June 2009.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 commodities
slid for an eighth day and  crude oil  sank to the lowest level
this year after industrial output slowed in China and shrunk in
India, while  JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM)  said that it had a $2 billion
trading loss. Russia, the world’s biggest energy exporter and
the largest producer of nickel and palladium, got almost 50
percent of government revenue from oil and gas sales last year.
Markets in Moscow are open today.  “ Russia  is very sensitive to commodities prices,”  Alec Young , a global equity strategist at S&P Capital IQ, said by
phone from New York. “We are seeing general  risk aversion  in
global markets. Oil is down, commodities fell and that is having
negative impact on Russia.”  The Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index lost 2.9 percent this
week, trimming this year’s gain to 3.8 percent.  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , a U.S.-traded fund that
holds Russian shares, fell for a third week, retreating 2.6
percent to $26.95. The RTS Volatility Index, which measures
expected swings in futures, rose 0.5 percent to 33.42 points.  Ruble Down  American depositary receipts of Surgutneftegas fell 0.4
percent to $5.38 in  New York  yesterday, widening their discount
to the Moscow-traded shares to 12 percent, the most since June
2009. The company’s preferred shares in Moscow rose 1.9 percent
to 18.38 rubles or 61 cents. Ten preferred shares equal one ADR.  The GSCI Spot Index of commodities posted its longest slump
since December 2008 and dropped to 640.46, the lowest since Dec.
22. Crude for June delivery fell 1 percent to $96.13 a barrel on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest since Dec. 19.
Prices declined 2.4 percent this week and are down 2.7 percent
this year.  The ruble fell to the weakest level against the dollar in
almost three months yesterday, as the currency depreciated as
much as 0.6 percent before trading down less than 0.1 percent at
30.113 per dollar by the close in Moscow.  ‘Sentiment Worsens’  “As far as sentiment goes, it worsens, as the market
equates Russia with commodities,”  Chris Osborne, head of
Troika Dialog’s U.S. unit, said by phone yesterday from New
York. “The impact on the economy is more nuanced -- when oil
comes off, the ruble depreciates and exports become more
competitive.”  OAO Lukoil (LUKOY) , Russia’s second-biggest oil producer, lost 9.6
percent to $55.47 in a four-week drop through yesterday in New
York, the longest losing streak since Nov. 25, 2011. Lukoil fell
0.6 percent to 1,734.90 rubles, or $57.56, on Russia’s Micex
Index.  “The recent weakness in the share prices of the Russian
 oil companies  was mainly driven by a decline in risk appetite
and the recent drop in crude  oil prices ,” Zoltan Palfi, an
analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG in London, said by phone
yesterday.  Brent oil for June settlement dropped 0.4 percent to
$112.26 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. Urals
crude, Russia’s chief export blend, was little changed at
$110.19 yesterday, dropping 0.7 percent in the week.  ‘Intriguing’  The Russia-US Index trades at 6.1 times estimated earnings,
nearly half the 10.3 valuation for the average company on the
MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index and the 12.6 multiple for the BSE
India Sensitive Index’s stocks.  “On the valuation side, Russia is intriguing,” Nelson Saiers, who oversees $639 million at Alphabet Management LLC in
New York, said by phone. “It’s one of the cheapest markets in
the world and one can argue it’s the cheapest. This low market
valuation is a byproduct of the material political and economic
uncertainty surrounding Russia and the euro zone along with its
sensitivity to energy.”  Polyus Gold International Ltd. (PLZLY) , Russia’s biggest gold
producer, fell 2.5 percent to $2.78, the lowest since July 2011.
Gold slid to a four-month low, capping the biggest weekly drop
since March. Gold futures for June delivery fell 0.7 percent to
settle at $1,584 an ounce. Prices were down 3.7 percent for the
week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
