The European Union cut its forecast
for Hungary’s  budget deficit  after the Cabinet approved new
taxes, boosting the country’s chances of unfreezing development
aid the EU threatened to block over fiscal concerns.  Hungary is on track to meet its 2012 deficit target of 2.5
percent of gross domestic product and the gap may widen to 2.9
percent, compared with a previous 3.7 percent forecast, the
European Commission said in its Spring Forecast, published
today. The government targets a 2.2 percent shortfall in 2013.  Hungary approved taxes on banking, energy,
telecommunications and insurance companies to allay European
Union concern that its budget was unsustainable and to retain
grants from the EU next year, which the bloc partially froze in
March. Hungary is shifting levies toward consumption after the
EU said the government relied on one-time measures to mask its
budget gap.  Hungary’s 2012 euro convergence program “contains numerous
additional saving measures including tax increases, the
introduction of new taxes such as the financial transaction tax,
and expenditure cuts, mainly in the area of budgetary chapters
and drug subsidies, altogether with a gross budgetary improving
effect of close to 2 percent of GDP,” the commission said.  The  economy  may contract 0.3 percent this year and expand 1
percent next year, the commission said. The government debt
level may decline to 78.5 percent of GDP this year from 80.6
percent last year and drop to 78 percent in 2013, according to
the EU’s executive.  Hungary is trying to end the EU’s excessive-deficit
procedure, which it has been under since the country joined the
bloc in 2004 for successive failures to meet budget targets in a
sustainable way.  To contact the reporters on this story:
