Aerodrom Nikola Tesla AD (AERO) , Serbia’s
main airport near the capital Belgrade, said first-quarter
profit rose 17.8 percent as traffic increased and the dinar
weakened.  Net income rose to almost 384 million dinars ($4.43
million) from 325.8 million dinars a year earlier, the state
controlled company said in a regulatory filing. Passengers
increased 14 percent to 604,210, and flights rose 2 percent to
9,749, according to the regulatory  filing . Sales climbed 4.7
percent to 1.2 billion dinars.  “It’s good that they maintained double-digit growth but
efficiency is weaker,” said Nenad Gujanicic, chief broker at
Belgrade-based  Sinteza Invest Group AD  brokerage. Operating
profit fell to 324 million dinars from 373 million the previous
year after price cuts in the second half of 2011 aimed at
attracting more passengers, he said.  The weaker dinar in the first three months was favorable
for the airport as most of its client contracts are pegged to
the dollar or the euro, Gujanicic said.  The airport may lose its monopoly on providing ground
services if Swissport International AG wins approval from
Serbia’s  Civil Aviation Directorate  to offer the service in
Belgrade, including baggage handling, catering and aircraft
cleaning, said Katarina Andric-Milosavljevic, spokeswoman for
the directorate.  Zurich-based Swissport, bought by Paris-based PAI Partners
Holdings Inc. in 2010, “just needs to add some documents” to
its application filed earlier this year, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
