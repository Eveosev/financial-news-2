Gasoline slid a second day on concern
that global fuel demand will fall after  China ’s industrial
growth slowed and  Greece  struggled to form a new government.  Futures declined as much as 1.1 percent as China’s factory
 production  grew the least since 2009 in April. The risk of a
Greek exit from the euro area mounted this week after May 6
elections saw anti-bailout parties surge in popularity.  “Weaker economic data out of China has contributed to
pressure on product prices,” said  Andy Lipow , president of
Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston. “Concern over the Greek
elections continues to provide uncertainty about the resolution
of their debt crisis and how that will impact demand throughout
other portions of Europe.”  Gasoline for June delivery fell 0.94 cent, or 0.3 percent,
to settle at $3.0008 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  Gasoline has lost 12 percent since reaching a 2012 high of
$3.4166 on March 26. The fuel has pared its year-to-date gain to
12 percent from 27 percent.  Chinese factory output increased 9.3 percent in April from
a year earlier, the biggest negative surprise against forecasts
in two years, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Consumer prices
rose 3.4 percent from a year earlier, staying below the
government’s annual goal for the third month.  “Signs of China slowing continue and the problems with
Europe don’t go away,”  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at
Tradition Energy in  Stamford , Connecticut.  Greece’s Struggles  Efforts to form a government in Greece,  Europe ’s most
indebted nation, have so far failed. Greece’s fiscal deficit is
projected to increase next year if a new government does not
pass additional budget cuts in the coming months.  Europe’s banks are ready for the possibility of a Greek
departure from the euro, European Banking Federation President
 Christian Clausen  said.  Futures touched a low of $2.9759 before paring losses and
finishing the week up 0.8 percent after a report that U.S.
 consumer confidence  rose in May to the highest level in four
years as gasoline prices at the pump continue to decline.  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
index of consumer sentiment climbed to 77.8, the highest since
January 2008, from 76.4 the prior month. The gauge was projected
to drop to 76, according to the median forecast of 68 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  “If there’s any bright spot, the  U.S. economy  is teetering
along here, and people are looking for demand to pick up here,”
said Fred Rigolini, vice president of Paramount Options Inc. in
New York. “The price of gasoline going down is going to be a
big boost to consumer sentiment.”  Pump Prices  Regular gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, fell 0.5
cent to $3.734 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA. That’s the
lowest level since Feb. 28. Prices are down 20.2 cents since
reaching a 2012 high of $3.936 on April 4. Gasoline peaked in
2011 at $3.985 on May 4.  June-delivery heating oil declined 1.98 cents, or 0.7
percent, to settle at $2.9636 a gallon on the exchange, the
lowest settlement since Dec. 30. Futures fell 1.5 percent this
week following a 5.4 percent loss the prior week. It’s the
biggest two-week slide since Nov. 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
