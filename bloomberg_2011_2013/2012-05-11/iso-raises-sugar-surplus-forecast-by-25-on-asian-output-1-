The global sugar surplus for the
current season ending Sept. 30 will be 25 percent bigger than
estimated on higher output from countries in  Asia , according to
the London-based International Sugar Organization.  Sugar supplies will outpace demand by 6.5 million metric
tons in 2011-12, up from a February forecast of 5.2 million
tons, the organization said in a report e-mailed today. The
surplus comes after two years of shortages and a season in which
production about matched consumption, the ISO said.  Global sugar production will rise by 9.6 million tons to a
record 173.8 million tons in 2011-12, with bigger crops in
 Thailand , China,  India ,  Russia  and the European Union, the ISO
said. World consumption will gain by 3.7 million tons, or 2.3
percent, to 167.4 million tons, the organization estimated.  “Our previous projections for a number of Asian key
producers, including  China  and Thailand, were too
conservative,” the ISO said in the report. “A new production
record is projected despite a significant decrease in sugar
output anticipated for  Brazil ,” the world’s largest producer.  Production in the 2011-12 season in Brazil dropped for the
first time in a decade as dry weather, frost and flowering cut
yields, according to industry group Unica. Harvesting of the
2012-13 crop, which starts in October in most countries, is
already under way in the South American nation.  The world sugar surplus may fall to 4 million tons in the
2012-13 season, with smaller crops in India and the EU, the ISO
estimates.  “For the time being, the return of a large-scale deficit
such as that seen by the world sugar market at the end of the
previous decade looks rather remote,” it said.  The surplus is likely to put pressure on prices, according
to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
