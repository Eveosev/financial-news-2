Iran  is pursuing work on a nuclear
warhead, Die Welt said, citing a report by the People’s
Mujahadeen and a member of the opposition group.  Scientists are carrying out research in a five-floor
building in Tehran’s Pars neighborhood and conducting testing at
Iran’s Parchin site, the group said in a report it says is based
on information obtained from people within the Iranian
government and military, the Berlin-based newspaper said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
