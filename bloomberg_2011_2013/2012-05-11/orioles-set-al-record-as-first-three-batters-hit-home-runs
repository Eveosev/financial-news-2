The Baltimore Orioles’ first three
batters each hit a home run to open the bottom of the first
inning against the  Texas Rangers , setting an American League
record.  Ryan Flaherty, J.J. Hardy and Nick Markakis gave the
Orioles a 3-0 advantage in the first inning. Baltimore held on
to win the first game in a double header 6-5.  Hardy also was the second batter the last time a first
inning began with three straight homers, on Sept. 9, 2007, when
he was a member of the  Milwaukee Brewers , the third National
League team to record the feat.  After 18 batters were retired, the Orioles came back in
the seventh inning with a solo homer by  Adam Jones  and a two-run
homer by Wilson Betemit. All the home runs were off Rangers’
pitcher Colby Lewis (3-2), who also had a career high 12
strikeouts.  The Orioles lost 7-3 in the night game as  Josh Hamilton  hit
his Major League Baseball-leading 15th home run. Hamilton hit
four homers in a 10-3 win May 8 against Baltimore to tie a major
league record.  To contact the reporter on this story:
