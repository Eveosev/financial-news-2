Absolute Return for Kids, the charity
founded by hedge fund investor  Arpad Busson , raised 14.5 million
pounds ($23.4 million) in London last night, 2.7 million pounds
less than last year, as the hedge fund industry struggles to
pare losses due to the European sovereign debt crisis.  Bill Gates  addressed the audience in a recorded video at
the auction dinner, which was attended by guests including hedge
fund managers Pierre Lagrange, founder of GLG Partners, and Ian Wace of Marshall Wace LLP and top model Eva Herzigova. British
rock band  Mumford & Sons  and electronic music duo  Pet Shop Boys 
performed at the Kensington Palace Gardens event, which Princess Beatrice of York also attended.  ARK  founder Busson, 49, started EIM SA, a Nyon,
Switzerland-based manager that invests in  hedge funds .  The fundraising was “an extraordinary show of generosity
at any time, but especially so given the challenges of
fundraising in this climate,” ARK said in a statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
