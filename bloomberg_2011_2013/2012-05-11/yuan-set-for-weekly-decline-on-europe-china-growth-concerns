The  yuan  was headed for its biggest
weekly loss in almost two months on concern political shifts in
 Europe  will reignite the region’s debt crisis, dimming the
outlook for Chinese exports.  Overseas sales  climbed 4.9 percent from a year earlier in
April, last month, less than the 8.5 percent growth forecast in
a Bloomberg survey of economists, data showed yesterday.
 Consumer-price gains  moderated to 3.4 percent from 3.6 percent
in March, according to figures released today.  Greece ’s
political leaders enter a fifth day of talks to form a
government following a May 6 election. French Socialist Francois
Hollande, who has called for austerity measures to be delayed,
was elected president.  “The weak data cast doubts on the strength of  China ’s
domestic consumption,” said Banny Lam, Hong Kong-based
economist at CCB International Securities Ltd., a unit of
China’s second-largest bank. “The political uncertainty in
Europe is also unfavorable for China.” Lam predicts the yuan
will trade at around 6.3 per dollar this quarter and resume
appreciation in the second half of the year.  The yuan fell 0.18 percent this week and 0.05 percent today
to 6.3173 per dollar as of 10:20 a.m. in  Shanghai , according to
the China Foreign Exchange Trade System. That’s the biggest
weekly drop since the five days ended March 16. The currency’s
one-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings
used to price options, declined 15 basis points, or 0.15
percentage point, this week to 1.85 percent.  The People’s Bank of China lowered the currency’s  reference
rate  by 0.02 percent today to 6.2952 per dollar, the weakest
level since April 24. The yuan is allowed to trade as much as 1
percent on either side of the fixing.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan dropped 0.19
percent this week to 6.3163. Twelve-month non-deliverable
forwards declined 0.06 percent today to 6.3600, extending the
week’s loss to 0.24 percent. The contracts traded at a 0.7
percent discount to the onshore spot rate, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Growth in China’s industrial output quickened to 12.2
percent last month from 11.9 percent in March, a survey showed
before the figures are released today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
