First Solar Inc. (FSLR)  Chief Executive
 James Hughes , who last week was promoted from chief commercial
officer, will receive a 36 percent increase in salary in his new
position.  Hughes’s salary will increase to $750,000 from $550,000,
and his bonus target will increase to 115 percent from 90
percent, Tempe, Arizona-based First Solar said today in a
regulatory filing.  First Solar, the world’s largest maker of thin-film solar
panels, fell to a record low on May 4 after reporting a $401
million restructuring charge related to firing 30 percent of its
workforce. Shares fell 7.7 percent this week.  Hughes replaces Michael Ahearn, who took over as interim
CEO after Rob Gillette was ousted last year. Ahearn’s salary was
$500,000, 41 percent less than Gillette received, according to a
regulatory filing. Gillette got a $5 million signing bonus when
he was hired in 2009 as part of a package estimated to be worth
$29.9 million for his first 15 months on the job.  A global glut of solar panels and cuts to government
subsidies in the U.S. and  Europe  have driven down prices for
solar panels 48 percent in the past year. The company announced
March 17 it would would fire 2,000 employees and close a plant
in Germany.  To contact the reporter on this story:
