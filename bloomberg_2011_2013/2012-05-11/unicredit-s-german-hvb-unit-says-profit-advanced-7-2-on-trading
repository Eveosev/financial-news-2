HVB Group,  UniCredit SpA (UCG) ’s German
banking unit, said first-quarter profit rose 7.2 percent, helped
by higher income from trading and after it set aside less money
for risky loans.  Net income advanced to 730 million euros ($943 million)
from 681 million euros a year earlier, the Munich-based lender
said in an e-mailed  statement  today.  HVB reduced its loan-loss provisions by 29 percent to 90
million euros. Net trading income rose 57 percent to 807 million
euros, while the lender’s core Tier 1 capital ratio, in
accordance with Basel II rules, climbed to 15.7 percent at the
end of the quarter from 15.6 percent at the end of last year.  HVB, led by Chief Executive Officer Theodor Weimer,
announced plans last year to eliminate more jobs to reduce
administrative costs. Milan-based UniCredit,  Italy ’s biggest
bank, said yesterday that profit rose 13 percent to 914 million
euros as higher trading income related to the buyback of its
securities offset a drop in fees and lending.  UniCredit CEO Federico Ghizzoni is cutting costs and
reviewing the bank’s strategy in central and eastern  Europe  as
part of a plan approved in November to strengthen finances and
boost profit. The lender raised 7.5 billion euros in a rights
offer in January to meet capital targets set by the European
Banking Authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
