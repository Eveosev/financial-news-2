Factory workers are getting no richer
as  General Electric Co. (GE)  and other U.S. companies move production
back home, according to  Pierre Lapointe , Brockhouse & Cooper
Inc.’s global macro strategist.  As the CHART OF THE DAY illustrates, average weekly
earnings of production employees fell 2.6 percent during the
past 16 months after accounting for inflation. The decline took
place because consumer prices increased more than wages, which
rose 1.3 percent during the period.  The chart shows the average nominal and real earnings, or
wages before and after inflation, based on data compiled by the
Labor Department. Periods defined as recessions by the National
Bureau of Economic Research appear in red.  “We are not seeing any pressure on wages,” Lapointe wrote
two days ago in a report with colleagues Alex Bellefleur and
Frances Donald. This means the economy will suffer as the
workers refrain from spending more, the report said.  Manufacturers have been able to hold down pay because so
many U.S. factory workers lost jobs during the past few years,
according to Lapointe, who is based in Montreal. The number of
production employees was 15 percent lower last month than in
December 2007, when the latest recession began, according to
Labor Department figures.  GE is returning appliance jobs to the U.S. from China and
Mexico, as Chief Executive Officer  Jeffrey Immelt  pledged to do
in September. The Fairfield, Connecticut-based company is in the
process of spending $432 million and adding 500 positions to
design and make more energy-efficient refrigerators.  To contact the reporter on this story:
