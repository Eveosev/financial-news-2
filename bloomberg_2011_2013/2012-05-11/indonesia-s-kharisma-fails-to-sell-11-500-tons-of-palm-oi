PT Kharisma Pemasaran Bersama
Nusantara, which sells palm oil from  Indonesia ’s state
plantations, withdrew the 11,500 tons it offered at an auction
in Jakarta today.  The company received the highest bids from PT SMART at
8,918 rupiah a kilogram ($970 a ton) for delivery from Belawan
port, the company said in a faxed statement. That’s less than
the target price of 9,125 rupiah a kilogram.  Indonesia is the world’s largest producer of palm oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
