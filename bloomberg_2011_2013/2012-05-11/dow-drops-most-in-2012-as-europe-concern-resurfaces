U.S. stocks fell for a second
straight week, driving the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  to the
biggest loss of 2012, as political tension in Greece heightened
concern about  Europe ’s debt crisis and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s $2
billion trading loss weighed on shares of banks.  Financial and technology  companies in the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index slipped at least 1.7 percent for the week as JPMorgan
tumbled 11 percent and  Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) ’s forecasts missed
analysts’ estimates.  Macy’s Inc. (M)  lost 7.6 percent and Fossil
Inc. sank 39 percent amid disappointing projections.  Walt Disney
Co. (DIS)  rose 6.1 percent to an all-time high after the movie
“Marvel’s The Avengers” earned a record $200.3 million in its
opening weekend and profit beat analysts’ estimates.  The S&P 500 fell 1.2 percent to 1,353.39, the lowest level
in two months. The index dropped 3.6 percent over two weeks,
trimming its 2012 gain to 7.6 percent. The Dow slipped 217.67
points, or 1.7 percent, to 12,820.60 for its biggest weekly
decline of the year.  “Europe is the big overlay,”  Bernie Williams , a portfolio
manager at USAA Investment, which oversees $52 billion in San
Antonio, said in a phone interview. “People are relatively
fearful, but the U.S. seems to be weathering this fairly well.”  Global equities declined during the week as an inconclusive
election in  Greece  left political parties struggling to form a
government. The impasse reignited concern over Greece’s ability
to meet terms of its two bailouts and the possibility the
country will leave the euro. In France,  Francois Hollande , who
defeated  Nicolas Sarkozy  as president, pledged to curtail
austerity measures. The Europe turmoil overshadowed U.S. data
showing jobless claims fell to a one-month low and  consumer
confidence  rose in May to the highest level in four years.  Biggest Retreat  Concern that European officials would fail to contain the
region’s debt crisis helped trigger the bull market’s biggest
retreat last year. The S&P 500 plunged 19 percent from April 29
through Oct. 3, 2011, as Moody’s Investors Service cut its
credit ratings on Portugal and Ireland to junk levels.  The index then rallied 29 percent to a four-year high on
April 2 amid better-than-expected earnings and economic data.
Per-share profits have  topped projections  at 70 percent of  S&P
500  companies that reported results during the current earnings
season, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The S&P 500 fell 0.8 percent in April and is down 3.2
percent in May as speculation grew that Europe’s debt crisis
could slow the global economy. The index hasn’t posted back-to-
back monthly declines since September. The Dow retreated in
eight out of the past 10 trading sessions.  ‘Egregious’  JPMorgan sank 11 percent to $36.96. Chief Executive Officer
 Jamie Dimon  blamed an “egregious” failure in trading of
synthetic credit securities for the trading loss. The firm’s
chief investment office, run by Ina Drew, took flawed positions
on synthetic credit securities that remain volatile and may  cost
an additional $1 billion  this quarter or next, Dimon said.  Cisco tumbled 14 percent to $16.51. The largest maker of
computer-networking equipment forecast fourth-quarter sales and
profit that missed analysts’ estimates, saying some business
clients are reluctant to spend. Chief Executive Officer  John Chambers  said orders from big companies fell in the third
quarter and that it’s taking longer to sign large deals with
corporate customers.  Cyclical, Defensive  Before this week, technology and financial stocks were
market leaders this year, jumping 15 percent and 16 percent,
respectively as a group, as investors snapped up stocks most
tied to economic growth. Concern about the global slowdown
prompted investors to seek safety in so-called defensive shares,
driving S&P 500 gauges of phone stocks, utilities and health-
care companies to the only gains this week.  The index of phone companies rallied 1.8 percent, the most
among 10 S&P 500 groups.  MetroPCS Communications Inc. (PCS)  jumped 5.9
percent to $7.04. Deutsche Telekom AG is discussing a merger of
its T-Mobile USA unit with the pay-as-you-go wireless carrier as
it reviews options for the customer-losing business, according
to people familiar with the matter.  Raw-materials and industrial companies fell the most as a
group, sinking 2 percent and 1.8 percent, respectively. CF
Industries Holdings Ltd., the largest U.S. maker of nitrogen
fertilizers, fell 6.2 percent to $172.18 after Dahlman Rose &
Co. recommended selling the shares. Dun & Bradstreet Corp., the
owner of the Hoover’s business information service, slumped 13
percent to $66.59 after cutting its full-year sales forecast.  Macy’s, Fossil  Macy’s slid 7.6 percent to $37.98. The second-biggest U.S.
department-store chain repeated its 2012 earnings forecast of no
more than $3.30 a share. The average analyst estimate is $3.39.   Fossil (FOSL)  plunged 39 percent, the most in the S&P 500, to
$78.55. The watchmaker reported first-quarter revenue of $589.5
million, missing the average analyst estimate of $617.9 million,
citing a softening economy in Europe. The company also lowered
its 2012 earnings forecast to no more than $5.33 a share. The
average analyst estimate was $5.56.  Disney climbed 6.1 percent to $45.56. The world’s largest
entertainment company is working on a sequel to “The Avengers”
and racing to get more merchandise in stores and plotting to get
the characters in its parks, Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer  Robert Iger  said.  Dean Foods Co. (DF)  surged 18 percent, the most in the S&P 500,
to $14.55. The biggest U.S. dairy processor boosted its full-
year earnings forecast, saying it expects at least $1.10 a
share. Analysts, on average, estimated 95 cents, according to a
Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
