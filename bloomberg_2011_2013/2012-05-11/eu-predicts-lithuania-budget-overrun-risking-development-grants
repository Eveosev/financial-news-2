Lithuania  will probably miss a
deadline to narrow its  budget deficit , threatening the Baltic
nation’s access to the European Union development grants that
have driven economic growth, the bloc’s executive arm said.  The fiscal gap may shrink 2.3 percentage points in 2012 to
3.2 percent of  gross domestic product , exceeding the 3 percent
limit set by the EU for a fifth year, the European Commission
said today in an e-mailed statement from Brussels. The shortfall
may drop to 3 percent in 2013, it added.  The grants helped Lithuania’s economy expand 5.9 percent in
2011, the second-fastest pace in the 27-member EU behind
Estonia. Growth will slow to 2.4 percent this year, the
commission said, cutting a previous 3.4 percent forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
