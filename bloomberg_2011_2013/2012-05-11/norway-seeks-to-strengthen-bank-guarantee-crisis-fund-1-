Norway  proposed to strengthen its
bank guarantee crisis fund by removing the upper limit to pave
the way for set annual fees, the  Finance Ministry  said.  Building up the fund will make it better equipped to handle
difficulties for individual banks and the industry as a whole,
Finance Minister Sigbjoern Johnsen said in a statement today.  The minister, ahead of a white paper to parliament today,
also reiterated that capital requirements for Norwegian banks
should increase faster than is being considered at an
international level, without being more specific.  “The Norwegian economy is relatively strong, which makes
it easier and cheaper for the banks to build up their capital,”
he said in a statement. “We also have special challenges in
Norway. We have never had such high household debt levels and
 house prices  as now.”  The ministry said banks such as  DNB ASA (DNB)  will have to pay an
annual fee to the fund, which in 2010 was on average 0.045
percent of their capital. In total, Norwegian banks paid 1.7
billion kroner ($289 million) into the fund in 2010, the last
year that banks had to contribute. The fund’s current size is 24
billion kroner.  The fund’s main task is to cover deposits in member banks.
Norwegian law states that deposits in a bank are guaranteed up
to 2 million kroner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
