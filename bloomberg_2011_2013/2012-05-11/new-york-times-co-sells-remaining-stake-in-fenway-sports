New York Times Co. (NYT)  sold its remaining
stake in Fenway Sports Group, owner of the Boston Red Sox
baseball team, for $63 million in cash to multiple buyers.  Times Co., publisher of the New York Times newspaper,
expects a pretax gain of about $38 million in the second
quarter, according to a regulatory filing today. The company
sold a third of its Fenway stake in February for $30 million.  The newspaper publisher has been selling assets amid
declining advertising sales as the publishing industry loses ad
dollars to Internet companies such as  Google Inc. (GOOG)  and Facebook
Inc. Times Co. reported a sevenfold rise in first-quarter profit
last month after selling regional publications.  In 2002, Times Co. paid $75 million for a  17 percent stake 
in Fenway Sports Group. The sports venture also owns the English
Premier League soccer club Liverpool Football Club and 80
percent of New England Sports Network, a regional sports cable
network.  The newspaper publisher, which still owns the Boston Globe
and the Worcester Telegram & Gazette after selling the Regional
Newspaper Group for $143 million in December, has built up its
digital business to capitalize on the ad industryâ€™s shift toward
online marketing and away from print.  Times Co.  dropped  1.2 percent to $6.43 today in  New York .
The shares have lost 17 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
