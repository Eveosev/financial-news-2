MOIL Ltd. (MOIL) , India’s largest producer
of manganese ore, increased prices after five straight quarterly
declines on expectation demand for the steelmaking material will
rebound as lower  interest rates  spur spending.  The state-run company, which supplies 40 percent of India’s
manganese demand, raised prices by as much as 12 percent for the
three months ending June, Chairman Kumar Jitendra Singh said
today by phone. Manganese helps strengthen steel.  India’s steel demand is expected to expand 8 percent in the
year ending March 31 from 5.5 percent the previous year, as
declining interest rates fuel purchases of homes, automobiles,
appliances and stimulates government spending.  Steel Authority
of India Ltd. (SAIL) , which consumes almost one-quarter of MOIL’s
production, plans to increase capacity by 55 percent to 21.4
million metric tons this year.  “We are seeing demand for manganese ore returning after
more than a year,” Singh said. Prices had plummeted about 33
percent in the previous year, he said.  MOIL  shares  fell as much as 1.4 percent to 251.50 rupees
and traded at 254.95 rupees as of 10:39 a.m. in Mumbai. The
shares have gained 12.5 percent this year, compared with the 5.8
percent increase in the key Sensitive Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
