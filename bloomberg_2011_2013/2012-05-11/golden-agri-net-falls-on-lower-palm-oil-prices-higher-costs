Golden Agri-Resources Ltd. (GGR) , the
world’s second-largest oil-palm planter, said first-quarter
profit fell 30 percent as prices of the tropical oil used in
food and fuel declined and fertilizer costs surged.  Group net income dropped to $162 million in the three
months ended March 31 from $230.7 million a year earlier, the
Singapore-based company said today in a statement. Revenue rose
4 percent to $1.5 billion.  Golden Agri, 50 percent owned by Indonesia’s Widjaja
family, follows  Wilmar International Ltd. (WIL)  in reporting lower
profit amid volatile commodity prices and rising costs.  Palm
oil , used in everything from candy bars to biofuel, averaged
3,254.20 ringgit ($1,059) a metric ton in the quarter, about 10
percent lower than a year earlier.  “The operating environment of the China agri-business
remains challenging given the high volatility in raw material
prices and intense competition,” Golden Agri said in the
statement. “We will continue to focus on managing our costs and
targeting our growth in the sale of various palm-based products
through our extended distribution channels.”  Cost of sales increased 14 percent to $1.1 billion in the
quarter from a year earlier.  Golden Agri shares were unchanged at 69.5 cents at the
close in  Singapore . The stock has fallen 2.8 percent this year,
compared with a 9 percent gain the benchmark Straits Times
Index. The earnings were announced after market hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
