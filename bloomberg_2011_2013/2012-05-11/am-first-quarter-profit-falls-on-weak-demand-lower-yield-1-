Tam SA (TAMM4) ,  Brazil ’s biggest airline by
market share, posted a 22 percent drop in first-quarter net
income, as domestic demand remained low, profitability fell and
fuel costs increased.  Tam net income fell to 100.9 million reais ($51.3 million)
in the first quarter from 128.8 million reais a year earlier,
according to a regulatory filing. Earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent costs, or Ebitdar,
fell 22 percent to 298.2 million reais from a year earlier. The
Ebitdar margin fell 3.3 percentage points to 9.2 percent.  “We anticipate weak results,” Banco Santander Brasil SA
analysts Alexandre Amson and Bruno Amorim wrote in an Apr. 27
note to clients. “Weak domestic demand and an unfavorable macro
scenario drove this poor performance,” wrote the analysts, who
have a buy recommendation to Tam.  Demand measured by revenue per passenger per kilometer rose
1.7 percent in the quarter, while yield, or the profitability
per passenger per kilometer, fell 0.8 percent and occupancy
declined 2.3 percentage points to 68.1 percent. Fuel costs rose
19.8 percent, to 1.27 billion reais.  Tam cut its 2012 guidance for demand increase to “ensure
profitability,” according to the statement. The airline now
expects seat availability to remain stable or fall as much as 2
percent this year and domestic demand to grow between 7 percent
and 9 percent.  Tam’s first-quarter report comes a day after  Lan Airlines
SA (LAN)  began its share swap offer that will run through June 11 in
Brazil and the U.S. The transaction will result in a combined
company with market value of about $13 billion, making it the
world’s biggest airline by market value, overtaking Air China
Ltd. and Singapore Airlines Ltd. After the completion of the
share swap, if the agreement requirements are met, Tam will be
delisted, what could make today’s Tam’s last earnings report.  Tam shares  rose  29 percent to 46.05 reais this year.
Competitor  Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA (GOLL4)  fell 17 percent in
the same period, while Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa index rose 4.7
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
