Bonds of  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) 
declined the most in six months after the firm said it suffered
a $2 billion trading loss at a unit set up to manage risks.  The yield premium investors demand to hold the lender’s $6
billion of undated 7.9 percent junior subordinated notes rather
than the 0.875 percent Treasury due 2018 rose 16 basis points to
392.2 basis points, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices at
10:10 a.m. in London. The price of the note, callable in 2018,
fell 2.2 cents on the dollar to 107.84 cents, pushing up the
yield to 6.3 percent.  The firm’s chief investment office lost money on bets on
synthetic credit securities that remain volatile, Chief
Executive Officer  Jamie Dimon  told analysts yesterday. Losses
mounted as JPMorgan tried to lay off hedges against credit
positions.  JPMorgan’s problem given the size of the positions it takes
is “moving in and out of markets in an orderly fashion, yet
without too much disruption of related pricing,” CreditSights
Inc. analysts led by  David Hendler  in  New York  said in a note.
The loss “puts into question the accuracy and calibration of
JPMorgan’s” risk models.  To contact the reporter on this story:
