The Socialist Party of President-
Elect  Francois Hollande  and its allies were favored by 45.5
percent of respondents ahead of June legislative elections,
according to a poll by BVA. The Socialists alone had 30 percent.  The UMP party of defeated President  Nicolas Sarkozy  had
32.5 percent support.  BVA noted that the support for parties on the left was 7.5
percentage points higher than in 2007 and slightly lower than
the 47 percent backing it had in 1997 when it last won.  The survey sampled 1,159 respondents on May 9-10 in the
poll conducted for Orange, Presse Regionale and RTL. No margin
of error was given.  To contact the reporter on this story:
