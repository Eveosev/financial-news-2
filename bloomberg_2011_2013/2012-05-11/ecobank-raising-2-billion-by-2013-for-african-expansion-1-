Ecobank Transnational Inc. (ETI) , which
operates in more African countries than any other lender, said
it may raise $2 billion by June 2013 as it seeks further
expansion in the continent.  Having been mandated by shareholders in 2008 to raise as
much as $3 billion, Ecobank will this year take on another $100
million in loans from the  World Bank ’s International Finance
Corp, about $50 million from “small companies” and a further
$100 million from European funding sources, Kolapo Lawson,
chairman of Ecobank, said today in an interview at the  World
Economic Forum  on  Africa  in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia’s capital.
“We’re hoping to enter Angola this year and will move very fast
if we get our license,” he said. “We may buy in East Africa.”  Ecobank, which is based in Lome, Togo, is present in more
than 30 African countries and wants to dominate the retail
banking markets in what it calls “middle Africa” -- the region
from Kenya in the east to Guinea-Bissau in the west and from
just below the Sahara to just above  South Africa . In the past
six months it has taken a $285 million loan from its South
African alliance partner,  Nedbank Group Plc (NED) , and sold a 20
percent stake to the Public Investment Corp., Africa’s largest
pension fund manager, for $250 million.  Ecobank may also move into South Sudan and Mozambique and
remains cautious about growing its Zimbabwean operations, Kolapo
said. Having bought Oceanic Bank International Plc in  Nigeria 
earlier this year with the help of Nedbank’s loan, Ecobank hopes
to be one of the top three banks in the oil-rich nation, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
