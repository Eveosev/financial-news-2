Dewey & LeBoeuf LLP, the New York-
based law firm seeking to avoid implosion, was sued by a unit of
 ABM Industries Inc. (ABM)  for not paying its bill for janitorial
services.  ABM Janitorial Services-Northeast filed the suit in New
York state Supreme Court today, accusing the law firm of failing
to pay about $299,000 for janitorial and related cleaning
services at its offices at 1301 Avenue of the Americas in
Manhattan through April 30. ABM Industries is based in New York.  Dewey is a shell of what was once the 11th-largest U.S. law
firm. More than 120 partners, including three out of four
remaining co-chairmen, have bolted the firm, and 450 employees
were fired this week.  Michael Sitrick , a spokesman for Dewey, didnâ€™t immediately
return a telephone message seeking comment on the lawsuit.  The case is ABM Janitorial Services v. Dewey & LeBoeuf,
651645/2012,  New York  State Supreme Court (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
