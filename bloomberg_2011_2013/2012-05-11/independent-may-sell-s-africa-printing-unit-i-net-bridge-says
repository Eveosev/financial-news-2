Independent News & Media Plc (INM)  may sell
its printing division in  South Africa ’s Gauteng province to cut
costs to better cope with lower advertising sales, I-Net Bridge
said, citing unidentified people close to the company.  The company is close to completing a plan that includes
shutting its printing operation in Gauteng and the reduction of
as much as 200 jobs, the Johannesburg-based news service said,
citing the people. Gauteng is the main business hub of  South
Africa  and includes Johannesburg and Pretoria.  David Ringrose, the finance director of Independent News
South Africa, declined to comment, while Tony Howard, the chief
executive officer of Independent News South Africa, didn’t
respond to requests from I-Net for comment. Independent News
Chief Executive Officer Vincent Crowley  did not immediately
return a message left with an employee at the company’s Dublin
office today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
