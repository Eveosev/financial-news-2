Thailand’s baht completed this year’s
biggest weekly drop and government bonds fell after overseas
investors cut holdings of local assets on concern  Europe ’s debt
crisis will hurt demand for Asian exports.  Global funds sold $224 million more local shares than they
bought this week through yesterday and pared ownership of
sovereign debt by $262 million, data from the stock exchange and
the Thai Bond Market Association show. The baht touched a three-
month low as  Greece ’s leaders entered a fifth day of talks to
form a government following elections on May 6. This week’s 3.9
percent drop in  gold prices  is also weighing on the currency,
according to  Kasikornbank Pcl. (KBANK)   “A major factor is the Greek political situation and that
is why investors aren’t putting the money in this region,” said
Amonthep Chawla, an analyst in Bangkok at Kasikornbank. “And
with gold prices having gone down this week, we have been seeing
flows to buy dollars from importers.”  The baht retreated 0.8 percent this week and 0.3 percent
today to 31.22 per dollar as of 3:07 p.m. in Bangkok, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency reached 31.25
earlier, the weakest level since Jan. 27.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of foreign-exchange
swings used to price options, was unchanged this week and today
at 4.52 percent.  The Bank of  Thailand  raised the nation’s 2012 economic-
growth forecast to 6 percent today from a March prediction of
5.7 percent. That compares with an expansion of 0.1 percent last
year.  The yield on the government’s 3.25 percent bonds due June
2017 rose seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 3.64
percent this week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
was little changed today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
