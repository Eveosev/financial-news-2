Merck & Co. (MRK)  isn’t liable in Australia
for heart risks associated with the Vioxx painkiller, the
country’s top court ruled, upholding an appeal of the first
trial decision outside the U.S.  Graeme Robert Peterson was awarded A$287,912 ($290,000) in
a 2010 ruling that found Vioxx contributed to his heart attack
in 2003, and a Federal Court appeal panel in Melbourne reversed
that decision in October 2011. The  High Court  of Australia today
rejected a request to hear an appeal,  Slater & Gordon Ltd. (SGH) , a
class-action  law firm , said in a statement.  Merck withdrew Vioxx in 2004 after a study showed it
doubled the risk of heart attacks and strokes. The drugmaker,
which faced thousands of claims from users blaming the medicine
for those medical conditions, won 11 of 16 Vioxx U.S. suits at
trial before agreeing in 2007 to create a $4.85 billion
settlement fund. The fund didn’t apply to cases outside the U.S.  Ronald Rogers, a spokesman for Whitehouse Station, New
Jersey-based Merck, didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail sent
outside regular business hours in the U.S.  Slater & Gordon said it has spent about A$10 million to
fund the Vioxx class-action litigation in  Australia  since it
started in 2005. The amount will be written down in the current
year’s financial accounts and won’t have a cash impact as the
costs have been accounted for, the law firm said.  The case is Graeme Robert Peterson v Merck Sharpe & Dohme
(Australia) Pty Ltd. and Merck & Co, Inc., VID 570/2010, Full
Court of the Federal Court of Australia (Melbourne).  To contact the editors responsible for this story:
