U.S. fighter jets intercepted a small
private plane near  Los Angeles  after it entered airspace closed
for a visit by President  Barack Obama , according to a North
American Aerospace Defense Command  statement .  The Piper PA-28 plane landed at 9:50 a.m. local time, about
five minutes after two F-16s flew alongside it, NORAD said on
its website. The single-engine plane landed at El Monte Airport
near Los Angeles, Ian Gregor, a spokesman for the U.S. Federal
Aviation Administration, said in a phone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
