Lacy Hunt, executive vice president 
and chief economist at Hoisington Investment Management Co., 
says a high inflation rate could "destroy" the American middle 
class, as wages lag behind the cost of living.  Hunt talks with 
Bloomberg's Pimm Fox and Courtney Donohoe on Bloomberg Radio's 
"Taking Stock."    (Source: Bloomberg)  Running time 14:12
