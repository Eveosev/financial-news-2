China , the world’s biggest steel
producer, boosted output 2.6 percent last month as steelmills
ramped up production.  Crude-steel output  was 60.57 million metric tons in April
from a year earlier, according to the National Bureau of
Statistics. Production fell 1.6 percent from 61.58 million tons
in March, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Chinese  steel prices  fell for four straight weeks to 4,281
 yuan  a ton today, according to researcher Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co. The  steel industry  is facing
increasing competition as more facilities, mainly from private
mills, started operation earlier this year, analyst Hu Zhengwu
said.  “Supply is rising faster than the pace of demand,” Hu,
from researcher Custeel.com, said by phone, “Cutting output
would incur big losses so steelmakers don’t tend to do that. The
increasing supply will likely weigh on prices over the next
month.”  Still, China’s manufacturing expanded in April at the
fastest pace in a year, damping speculation the central bank
will relax monetary policy. The  Purchasing Managers ’ Index rose
to 53.3 last month from 53.1 in March, the statistics bureau and
logistics federation said in a statement May 1.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
