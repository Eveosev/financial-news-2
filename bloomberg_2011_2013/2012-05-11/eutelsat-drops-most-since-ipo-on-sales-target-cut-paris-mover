Eutelsat Communications SA (ETL)  fell the
most since it started trading in Paris in December 2005 after
the satellite company cut its forecast for full-year revenue.  The stock fell as much as 15 percent to 22.54 euros, and
traded down 13 percent at 22.98 euros at 10:05 a.m., giving the
company a market value of 5.06 billion euros ($6.54 billion).  Henrik Nyblom, an analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc.,
downgraded the stock to “neutral” from buy and reduced the
target price to 32.5 euros from 36 euros. Nyblom cited
“disappointing” third-quarter revenue and the cut to guidance.  “Lower-than-expected near-term growth and lower visibility
justifies a more cautious stance,” Nyblom wrote in a note
today. “Our cuts reflect a more prolonged period of competitive
pressure in certain geographies as the industry continues to add
capacity and a more cautious view on the growth potential in
multi-usage leasing.”  Eutelsat last night reduced its sales target in the fiscal
year through June to about 1.22 billion euros from a previous
forecast of more than 1.24 billion euros. The satellite company
expects full-year earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization to be about 955 million euros, down from a
previous prediction of more than 955 million euros, it said.  Analysts had estimated full-year sales of 1.24 billion
euros and Ebitda of 966.5 million euros, according to the
average of 16 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Eutelsat will give an update on its medium-term outlook
when it reports full-year earnings on July 30.  Challenges for Eutelsat include “a more competitive
environment in the Balkans and  Africa ” and partial delays in
the rollout of some services, Chief Executive Officer Michel De Rosen said in the statement.  Third-quarter revenue rose 4.6 percent to 308.7 million
euros.  To contact the reporters on this story:
