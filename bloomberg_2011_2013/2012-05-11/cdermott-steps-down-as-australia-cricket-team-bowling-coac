Craig McDermott stepped down as
 Australia ’s bowling coach after a year in the job because of the
amount of travel involved, Cricket Australia said.  “The team’s schedule is a particularly busy one and after
looking at the upcoming touring demands, I felt this to be the
right decision from a personal and professional point of view,”
McDermott said in an e-mailed statement.  McDermott, 47, replacedTroy Cooley in the role 12 months
ago and has since taken the team’s fast bowlers “to another
level,” head coach Mickey Arthur said in the statement.
McDermott will continue to provide input to Cricket Australia’s
Centre of Excellence in Brisbane, the governing body said.  Australia, which finished a tour of the West Indies last
month, is scheduled to play one-day matches in the U.K. in June
and July before competing at the World Twenty20 tournament in
 Sri Lanka  in September and October. Next year, the Australians
are scheduled to tour  India  twice and England once for the Ashes
series.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
