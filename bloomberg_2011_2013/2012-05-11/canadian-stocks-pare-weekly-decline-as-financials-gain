Canadian stocks  fell, completing a
second straight weekly decline, as energy and materials
producers slipped on concern that a weakening Chinese economy
may curb demand for commodities.  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX)  and Suncor Energy Inc. declined 1.9
percent each as oil and gold futures slumped. Osisko Mining
Corp. sank 13 percent after  RBC Capital Markets  cut its rating.
 Sun Life Financial Inc. (SLF) , the country’s third-largest insurer,
rose 3.3 percent, as financial shares rose on stronger-than-
forecast employment figures.  Savanna Energy Services Corp. (SVY) 
gained 4.1 percent after RBC recommended the shares.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  fell 41.50
points, or 0.4 percent, to 11,694.67 today for a 1.5 percent
weekly decline. The index has retreated 8.2 percent since the
2012 high in February.  “It’s a bit of a mixed day, with Chinese industrial
production a little lower than last month, showing signs of
slowing,”  Todd Johnson , a  money manager  at BCV Asset Management
in Winnipeg, Manitoba, said in a telephone interview. The firm
oversees C$349 million ($350 million). The Canadian jobs number
“was very good and helps propel the market higher, given
domestic jobs here are pretty robust.”  The benchmark gauge fell 3 percent last week as a U.S.
industry report showed employers added fewer jobs than forecast
in April and commodity prices dropped. Energy and mining shares
account for 43 percent of Canadian stocks by market value.  China’s Slump  Chinese industrial production rose the least since 2009 in
April, while retail sales and new lending gained less than
estimated and inflation was below target, figures showed today.
The value of Chinese house sales slumped, adding to signs the
world’s second-largest economy is weakening. Oil fell 1 percent,
to $96.13 a barrel, the lowest settlement since Dec. 19.  Suncor Energy, Canada’s largest oil and gas producer, lost
1.9 percent to C$28.75.  Materials shares had the biggest decline in the S&P/TSX
today, falling 1.5 percent as a group as gold futures plunged to
a four-month low, capping the biggest weekly drop since March.
Copper also declined. The group had the worst performance of the
week, down 5 percent.  Osisko Mining Corp. (OSK)  fell 13 percent to C$7.40, the
company’s biggest retreat since February 2009, after RBC lowered
the stock to sector perform from outperform. The rating means
the stock is expected to trade in line with the sector average
over 12 months. The company said yesterday it would shut its
ore-processing mill at the Canadian Malartic mine for as long as
three weeks after a fire.  Barrick, Eldorado  Barrick Gold slipped 1.9 percent to C$37.09, while  Eldorado
Gold Corp. (ELD)  fell 2.9 percent to C$11.49.  Ivanhoe Mines Ltd. dropped 5.1 percent to C$9.48. The
Vancouver-based miner appointed David Klingner as chairman and
said construction of phase one at its Oyu Tolgoi gold and copper
project in Mongolia was 82 percent complete at the end of April.  A report today showed Canadian employment rose almost six
times faster than economists forecast in April, led by private-
sector and full-time positions. Employment rose by 58,200
following a March jump of 82,300,  Statistics Canada  said today
in Ottawa, for the largest two-month increase in more than 30
years.  An  index of banks  in the S&P/TSX rose 0.2 percent, after
falling as much as 0.7 percent earlier today following  JPMorgan
Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s disclosure of a $2 billion trading loss. Toronto-
Dominion Bank, Canada’s second-biggest lender, rose 0.4 percent
to C$80.51.  A gauge of insurers added 1.2 percent. Sun Life climbed 3.3
percent to C$23.30, while Manulife Financial Corp., Canada’s
largest insurer, added 2.4 percent to C$12.36.  Savanna Energy Services gained 4.1 percent to C$7.70 after
RBC raised the stock to outperform from sector perform.  To contact the reporter on this story:
