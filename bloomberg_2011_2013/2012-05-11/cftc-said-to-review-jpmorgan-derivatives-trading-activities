The main U.S. derivatives regulator
has been reviewing  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s derivatives trading
activities since last month, according to a person briefed on
the matter.  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission hasn’t opened an
enforcement action against the bank, according to the person,
who spoke on condition of anonymity because the review is
private. JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer  Jamie Dimon  said
yesterday that the firm suffered a $2 billion loss from trading
credit derivatives, which he attributed to “egregious”
failures in a unit managing risks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
