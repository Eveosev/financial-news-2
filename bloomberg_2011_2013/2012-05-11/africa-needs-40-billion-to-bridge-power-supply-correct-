(Corrects spelling of minister’s name in first paragraph.)  Africa needs $40 billion annually to
bridge its power-supply deficit, Nigerian Petroleum Resources
Minister Diezani Alison-Madueke said.  There is a $30 billion funding gap that governments can
fill by making the oil and gas projects  more “bankable” and
ensuring “securitization” for private equity, she said at the
 World Economic Forum  on Africa today in  Addis Ababa , Ethiopia’s
capital.  “Access to low-cost funds are critical in bridging this
gap,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
