OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP)  shares slid, set for a
second week of declines on concern  Hungary ’s planned financial-
transaction tax will hurt lending and as JPMorgan Chase & Co.
reported a $2 billion trading loss.  OTP, Hungary’s largest bank, fell 1 percent to 3,632 forint
as of 9:52 a.m. in Budapest, poised for a 3.3 percent five-day
retreat. The  BUX (BUX)  index of 11 companies, in which OTP Bank has a
28 percent weighting, slumped 0.2 percent today.  Hungarian banks want to renegotiate the 0.1 percent tax on
financial transfers proposed by Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s
administration, Daniel Gyuris, deputy head of the country’s
Banking Association and deputy chief executive officer at OTP
Bank, said yesterday. The plan was “unexpected” and threatened
to curb lending and economic growth, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
