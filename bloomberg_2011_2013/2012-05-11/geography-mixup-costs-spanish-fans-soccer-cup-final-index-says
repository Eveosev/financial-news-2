Some 400 supporters of Spanish soccer
club Athletic Bilbao missed the Europa League cup final after
mistakenly flying to the Hungarian capital, Budapest, instead of
the Romanian capital, Bucharest, news website  Index.hu  reported,
without saying where it got the information.  In their absence, their team suffered a 3-0 defeat against
 Atletico Madrid  during the final game of the continent’s second-
tier competition on May 9, the website reported today.  The announcer at Bucharest’s National Arena greeted the
crowd by saying “Welcome to Budapest,” drawing jeers, Index
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
