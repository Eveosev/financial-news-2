The Philadelphia 76ers eliminated the
top-seeded  Chicago Bulls  and will play the  Boston Celtics , who
ousted the  Atlanta Hawks , in the National Basketball
Association’s Eastern Conference semifinals.  The Denver Nuggets defeated the Los Angeles Lakers 113-96
to force a decisive Game 7 in the Western Conference series. The
winner, to be determined tomorrow in Los Angeles, will play the
Oklahoma City Thunder for a place in the conference finals.  Andre Iguodala hit two free throws with two seconds
remaining and then blocked C.J. Watson’s 3-point attempt as time
expired as the 76ers won 79-78 to secure a four games to two
victory in the best-of-seven playoff series. Boston beat the
Hawks 83-80 last night to win by four games to two.  “I’ve been struggling all year” with free throws,
Iguodala said in a televised interview. “I thought of my son
and it was easy after that.”  The 76ers, with their first postseason series victory since
2003, became the fifth No. 8 seed to win a first-round series
against a No. 1 seed in the NBA playoffs. The Memphis Grizzlies
ousted the San Antonio Spurs last year, while the 2007  Golden
State Warriors , 1999  New York  Knicks and 1994  Denver Nuggets 
also achieved the feat.  At Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia, Chicago trailed by
12 points with seven minutes, 33 seconds to play in the third
quarter. The Bulls then went on a 22-10 scoring run to tie the
game with one quarter to play.  Missed Free Throws  Faced with a chance to give the Bulls a three-point lead
with seven seconds remaining, Omer Asik missed two free throws.  “We’ve been in that position so many times this season,
and we’ve let the games go,” said Iguodala, who led the 76ers
with 20 points. “I’m just so proud of my teammates.”  Jrue Holiday and Lou Williams each scored 14 points for the
76ers, who visit the Celtics tomorrow in Game 1 of the second
round.  Luol Deng had 19 points and 17 rebounds, and Richard Hamilton contributed 19 points for  Chicago .  The Bulls, who finished the regular season tied with the
Spurs for the best record in the league, lost four of five games
since winning the series opener, in which NBA Most Valuable
Player Derrick Rose suffered a season-ending knee injury.  At TD Garden in Boston, Kevin Garnett hit a 13-foot basket
to give the Celtics an 80-79 lead with 30 seconds remaining. Ray Allen added a free throw 21 seconds later to make it 81-79.  Atlanta’s  Al Horford  narrowed the gap to 81-80 with a free
throw with two seconds left before Paul Pierce secured the
victory with two free throws.  Garnett led the Celtics with 28 points and 14 rebounds, and
Pierce added 18 points.  Josh Smith scored 18 points and Joe Johnson added 17 for
the Hawks.  The  Miami Heat  will host the  Indiana Pacers  in Game 1 of
their Eastern Conference semifinal series May 13.  Tonight, the  Los Angeles  Clippers host the Memphis
Grizzlies. A win for the Grizzlies will set up a decisive
seventh game May 13 in Memphis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
