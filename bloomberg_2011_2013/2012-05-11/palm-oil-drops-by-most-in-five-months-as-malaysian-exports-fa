Palm oil  declined by the most in
almost five months, for a second weekly loss, after estimates
showed that Malaysian exports fell and as concern Europe’s debt
crisis may worsen damped demand for commodities.  The July-delivery contract slumped 2.2 percent to close at
3,275 ringgit ($1,060) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange, the biggest drop for the most-active contract since
Dec. 15. Futures dropped 2.5 percent this week, after a 4.2
percent loss last week.  Shipments declined 6 percent to 450,269 tons in the first
10 days of May from the same period a month earlier, Intertek
said yesterday. Exports fell 14 percent to 419,364 tons in the
same period,  Societe Generale de Surveillance  estimated.  Commodities fell for an eighth day today, wiping out gains
for the year, on concern turmoil in  Greece  may worsen Europe’s
crisis and as  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  said it had a $2 billion
trading loss on derivatives. Data also showed weaker industrial
output in China and India.  “Demand is anemic,” said Paramalingam Subramaniam, a
director of Kuala Lumpur-based brokerage Pelindung Bestari Sdn.
The “macro uncertainties in the European Union” are weighing
on prices, he said in an e-mail.  Greece has been unable to form a government since the May 6
elections, stoking concerns over the country’s ability to hold
to the terms of bailouts negotiated since May 2010 and
possibility of the nation leaving the currency union.  Europe’s economy  will fail to grow this year after nations
from  Spain  to Italy slipped into recession, the European
Commission said today. Gross domestic product in the 17-nation
euro area will drop 0.3 percent, the commission said,
reiterating a February forecast.  Crude oil, copper and gold headed for second weekly
declines and equities fell after  Jamie Dimon , chief executive
officer at JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, said the
lender made egregious mistakes leading to the loss.  Soybeans for July delivery fell 1 percent to $14.4025 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.  Soybean oil , which
competes with palm oil for use in food and fuels, lost 1.63
percent to 52.63 cents per pound.  Palm oil for September delivery slumped 2.5 percent to
close at 8,438  yuan  ($1,337) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity
Exchange , the lowest for the most-active contract since March 8
and the biggest drop since October. Soybean oil for the same
month fell 1.9 percent to 9,566 yuan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
