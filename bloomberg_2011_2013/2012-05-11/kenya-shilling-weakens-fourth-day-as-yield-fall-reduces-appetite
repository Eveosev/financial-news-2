Kenya ’s shilling weakened for the
fourth day as falling yields on  government securities  reduced
investors’ appetite.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy depreciated
less than 0.1 percent to close at 83.55 per dollar, the weakest
since Feb 9, after trading as much as 0.4 percent weaker at
83.80 earlier in the day.  “The Kenyan shilling tumbled to a three-month low against
the dollar as falling yields on government securities reduced
appetite to hold the currency,”  NIC Bank Ltd. (NICB)  said in a note to
clients.  Kenya’s three-month and six-month borrowing costs fell for
the 17th straight week after the government cut the size of its
weekly debt offering and halved its target for domestic debt
purchases this financial year.  The yield on the 91-day Treasury bills declined to 11.381
percent at yesterday’ sale from 20.799 percent at a sale on Jan
12, while the yield on 182-day bills retreated to 13.076 percent
from 20.914 percent realised on Jan 23, according to the central
bank  website .  Kenya’s central bank accepted all 9.3 billion shillings
($111 million) of bids received for seven-day repurchase
agreements, said Godfrey Putunoi, a dealer at the bank’s money-
market department.  The weighted average rate for the repos was 16.073 percent,
he said by phone today from Nairobi, the capital. The bank had
offered 5 billion shillings, he said  The central bank has stayed out of the money market the
last three days. The bank mopped a total of 26 billion shillings
through  repurchase agreements  from April 27 through May 7,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Tanzania’s shilling gained for the second time this week,
appreciating by 0.3 percent to close at 1,578 to the dollar,
while the Ugandan shilling remained unchanged at 2,465 to the
dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
