European banks’ reluctance to lend to
one another fell to the lowest level in more than nine months,
according to a money-market indicator.  The  Euribor-OIS spread , the difference between the euro
interbank offered rate and overnight indexed swaps, was 37 basis
points at 8:18 a.m. in  London  from 38 yesterday, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. The measure fell for the third day to the
lowest level since Aug. 1. It is the fourth week the measure has
declined.  The cost for banks to convert euro interest payments into
dollars rose. The three-month cross-currency  basis swap  was 45
basis points below Euribor from 44 yesterday. It is the first
week the measure has risen after a four-week decline.  The one-year basis swap rose to 54 basis points less than
Euribor from minus 53.5 yesterday. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  Lenders increased  overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-based
European Central Bank yesterday, placing 703 billion euros ($908
billion) with the  European Central Bank  from 696 billion euros
the day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
