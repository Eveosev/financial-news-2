PPF Investments filed a lawsuit
challenging the appointment of directors on the board of
Ingosstrakh, an insurer 38.5 percent held by the private-equity
group and controlled by Russian billionaire  Oleg Deripaska .  It filed the suit in the Moscow court of arbitration after
an Ingosstrakh shareholder meeting yesterday elected all nine
nominees for the board put forward by Deripaska’s Basic Element
holding company, while a PPFI candidate list was “ignored,”
the private-equity company said in an e-mailed statement.  The firm, which has investors from the Czech Republic and
 Italy , also said it was prevented from voting on “multibillion
ruble deals” between Ingosstrakh and affiliated groups.  “We are deeply concerned with the position of Czech
shareholders, which is reflected in filing endless and
groundless lawsuits against Ingosstrakh,” Mikhail Volkov, a
board member at the insurer representing Basic Element, said in
an e-mailed reply to questions from Bloomberg News.  PPFI has been locked in a battle with Deripaska for
influence over Ingosstrakh since the firm bought a stake in
2007. The company has held talks to sell its holding to  Russia ’s
state-run VTB Group, Vedomosti reported in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
