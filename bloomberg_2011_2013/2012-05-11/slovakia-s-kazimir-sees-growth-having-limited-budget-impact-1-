The Slovak economy’s likely growth
this year will have a “limited” impact on the country’s
budget, which means immediate measures will be needed to hit the
deficit target, Finance Minister Peter Kazimir said.  The European Union raised today its forecast for Slovakia’s
gross domestic product  growth  in 2012 to 1.8 percent from 1.2
percent. The revision is based mainly on external demand, which
won’t raise revenue enough to offset other budget risks, Kazimir
said in a phone interview from Bratislava today.  Prime Minister  Robert Fico ’s government wants to cut the
deficit to insulate the country from the euro area’s debt crisis
at a time when a European slowdown is weighing on the export-
oriented Slovak economy. The growth forecast for Slovakia
compares with a predicted 0.3 percent contraction in the euro
region as a whole.  “Growth has been revised, but its impact on the budget is
small,” Kazimir said. “We see bigger budget risks than the
EU.”  The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, predicted
today that Slovakia’s budget  deficit  will, at 4.7 percent of
GDP, exceed the target for this year. Kazimir said the
government’s goal is still to cut it to 4.6 percent of GDP, and
that will require additional measures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
