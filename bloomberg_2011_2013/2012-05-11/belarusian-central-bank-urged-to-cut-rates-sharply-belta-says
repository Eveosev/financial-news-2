Belarus should lower its benchmark
refinancing rate “sharply” this quarter to unlock loan
resources that companies need to expand, Belta  reported , citing
First Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Semashko.  Semashko asked the  Finance Ministry , central bank and
Economy Ministry to draft a proposal on reducing the main
interest rate by the end of the year to the inflation level of
no more than 22 percent to 25 percent, according to the state-
run news service.  The central bank today cut the refinancing rate for a
fourth time this year, decreasing it by 2 percentage points to
34 percent, effective May 16. Central bank Chairman Nadezhda
Ermakova said April 4 that the regulator planned to reduce the
rate by 1 to 2 percentage points each month this year.  The Belarusian economy grew 2.9 percent in the first four
months from a year earlier, down from a 12.3 percent increase
during the same period in 2011, the state statistics committee
 said  on its website today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
