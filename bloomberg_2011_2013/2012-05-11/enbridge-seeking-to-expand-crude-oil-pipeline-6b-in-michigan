Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  is seeking to replace
210 miles of pipeline 6B in  Indiana  and Michigan in a $1.3-
billion project to double the crude-oil line’s capacity to
500,000 barrels a day.  The expansion would be the second phase of a replacement
project of the line, which runs from Griffith, Indiana, to
Sarnia, Ontario. The first phase, which involves replacing 75
miles of pipeline segment for integrity reasons, is scheduled
for completion later this year, said Lorraine Little, a
Superior, Wisconsin-based spokeswoman for Enbridge.  Line 6B, which has a current capacity of 240,000 barrels a
day, according to Little, was shut for two months after spilling
19,500 barrels of oil July 26, 2010, near Marshall,  Michigan .  Enbridge filed an application April 16 with the Michigan
Public Service Commission asking permission to replace 160 miles
of 30-inch pipeline. The new pipeline would include 110 miles of
36-inch pipe and 50 miles of 30-inch pipe, according to the
filing. Another 50 miles of pipeline would be replaced in
Indiana.  “Recent, ongoing and anticipated refinery upgrades and
expansions in Michigan,  Ohio  and eastern  Canada  are driving the
demand for additional pipeline transportation capacity,” Little
said in an e-mailed statement.  Line 6B delivers oil to refineries in Detroit, Toledo,
Ohio, and Sarnia, Ontario.  “These refinery customers are reconfiguring in order to
accept delivery of and process increased volumes of heavy crude
oil from western Canada as well as light crude oil supplies from
the Bakken Formation in  North Dakota  and Montana,” Little said.  Enbridge requested approval by Nov. 1 so it can start work
by Nov. 15 and put the expanded pipeline into service in
September 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
