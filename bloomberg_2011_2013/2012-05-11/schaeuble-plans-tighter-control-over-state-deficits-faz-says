German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  plans to force the country’s states to define binding
spending limits starting in 2014 to ensure adherence to a
constitutional balanced-budget rule for the regions from 2020,
 Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  reported.  The plan is part of the implementation in  Germany  of the
so-called fiscal pact among 25 European Union governments that
aims to ensure budget discipline, the German newspaper said.  Tighter budget controls would thwart plans by the
government of North Rhine-Westphalia, a coalition of the Social
Democrats and Greens that are in opposition at national level,
to raise the  budget deficit  to boost economic growth, the
newspaper said. The state votes on May 13.  Schaeuble’s road map for state deficits makes it harder for
the opposition-controlled upper house of parliament, where the
states are represented, to block the fiscal pact on the grounds
that repercussions on state finances are unclear, FAZ said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
