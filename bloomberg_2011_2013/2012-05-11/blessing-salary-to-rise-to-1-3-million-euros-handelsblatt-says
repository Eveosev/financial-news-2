Commerzbank AG (CBK)  Chief Executive
Officer  Martin Blessing ’s base salary will rise to 1.3 million
euros ($1.7 million) next year as a state-imposed 500,000 euro-
cap on pay for top management no longer applies,  Handelsblatt 
reported today, without saying where it got the information.  The bank’s management board has done “an excellent job,”
Commerzbank Chairman Klaus-Peter Mueller said, according to
