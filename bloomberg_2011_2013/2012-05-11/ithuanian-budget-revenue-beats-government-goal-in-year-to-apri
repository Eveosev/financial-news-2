Lithuania’s budget revenue increased
7.7 percent from a year earlier in the four months through
April, exceeding the government’s target.  Revenue rose to 6.62 billion litai ($2.48 billion), the
 Finance Ministry , based in the capital, Vilnius, said today in a
statement on its website. The government had sought 6.49 billion
litai.  The Baltic nation’s government plans to narrow the  budget
deficit  to 3 percent of  gross domestic product  this year from
5.5 percent in 2011. The shortfall may shrink to 3.2 percent
this year, the European Commission said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
