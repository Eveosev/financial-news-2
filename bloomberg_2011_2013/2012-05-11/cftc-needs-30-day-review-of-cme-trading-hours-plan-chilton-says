The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission should implement a 30-day comment period on a plan by
 CME Group (CME)  Inc. to expand trading hours for grain contracts, said
 Bart Chilton , one of five CFTC commissioners.  “It makes a lot of sense to hear from market participants,
farmers and the public about this one,” Chilton said today by
telephone. “We would be better off having an expanded view
before a final determination is made.”  CME Group, the owner of the largest U.S. grain market,
plans to expand trading to 22 hours a day from 17 hours starting
on May 21, after  IntercontinentalExchange Inc. (ICE)  starts offering
grain and oilseed contracts on May 14. The National Grain and
Feed Association and the North American Export Grain
Association, the largest U.S. grain-trading groups, yesterday
urged the CFTC to delay the trading expansion and urged the
regulator to implement the 30-day comment period.  The exchanges provided “inadequate advance consideration”
of their plan to expand trading, the groups said. The impact of
the longer trading day on market participants justifies
intervention by U.S. regulators in delaying the change, they
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
