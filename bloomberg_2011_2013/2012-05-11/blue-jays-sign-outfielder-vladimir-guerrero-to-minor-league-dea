The Toronto Blue Jays, who are tied
for third lowest in the  American League  with a club batting
average of .238, signed nine-time All-Star  Vladimir Guerrero  to
a minor-league contract.  Guerrero, 37, will report to the Major League Baseball
team’s extended spring training camp in Dunedin, Florida, the
Blue Jays announced today in a statement on their  website . Terms
of the deal weren’t disclosed.  In a 16-year career with the Montreal Expos, Los Angeles
Angels,  Texas Rangers  and Baltimore Orioles, Guerrero has a .318
average with 449 home runs, 1,496 runs batted in, 181 stolen
bases and 477 doubles. He has topped 25 home runs and 100 RBIs
