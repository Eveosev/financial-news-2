Caledonia Mining Corp. (CAL)  said it will
sell 51 percent of its Blanket gold mine in  Zimbabwe  for $30.1
million to comply with the southern African country’s ownership
laws.  Flemiro Investments (Pvt) Ltd., a closely held Zimbabwean
investment company, will pay $11 million for 15 percent of the
mine, Caledonia said in a statement on its  website . A workers’
trust fund will buy a further 10 percent, 16 percent will be
sold to the state-owned Zimbabwe National Indigenization and
Economic Empowerment Fund and 10 percent will be given to a
local community share trust, the company said.  Under Zimbabwean law, all foreign-owned mines must be 51
percent-owned by black Zimbabweans or the state.  Toronto-based Caledonia produced 9,164 ounces of gold in
the quarter through Dec. 31, an increase of 25 percent on the
same period a year earlier, according to the company’s quarterly
report. Production fell 13 percent from the preceding quarter,
it said. Profit after tax rose to $7.11 million from $1.89
million a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
