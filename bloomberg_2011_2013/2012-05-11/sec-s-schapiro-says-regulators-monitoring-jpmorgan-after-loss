U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission Chairman Mary Schapiro said that regulators are
monitoring  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  after the bank said it suffered
a $2 billion trading loss.  “I think it’s safe to say that all the regulators are
focused on this,” she told reporters after speaking at an event
in Washington.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon
said yesterday that the New York-based bank suffered a $2
billion trading loss after an “egregious” failure in its chief
investment office. The flawed positions on synthetic credit
securities remain volatile and may cost an additional $1 billion
this quarter or next, Dimon told analysts yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
