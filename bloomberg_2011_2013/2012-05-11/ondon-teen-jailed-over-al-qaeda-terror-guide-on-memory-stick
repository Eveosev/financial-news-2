A 19-year-old  London  man caught with
a memory stick containing an al-Qaeda terrorism guide was
sentenced to 14 months in prison by a court in the U.K. capital.  Mohammed Abu Hasnath, of east London, was arrested in
October and pleaded guilty to four separate terror offenses at
an earlier hearing at London’s central criminal court, police
said.  Abu Hasnath “was caught in possession of a USB device
which contained literature designed to influence the reader to
support, fund, or join terrorism, and which also provided
practical guidance on how to do it.” Stuart Osborne, deputy
assistant commissioner, said in an e-mailed statement from the
Metropolitan Police today. “This is a serious terrorist offense
and we hope this will send a clear message that anyone caught in
possession of such material can expect to be brought before the
courts.”  The magazine, called ‘Inspire’, is published by
al-Qaeda and contains English-language guides on how to commit
acts of terrorism, police said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
