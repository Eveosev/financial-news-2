Iceland’s  parliament  passed a motion
allowing the government to cut the number of ministries to eight
from 10 through mergers and a redistribution of roles.  The changes were backed by 28 lawmakers in the 63-member
Althingi, according to a  statement  on the Reykjavik-based
legislature’s website. Twenty-one lawmakers opposed the move.  A new Industry and Innovation Ministry will replace the
current  Ministry of Industry, Energy and Tourism  and the
Ministry of Fisheries and Agriculture.  The duties of the Ministry of Economic and Business Affairs
will be divided between that new ministry and the  Ministry of
Finance , which will be renamed the Ministry of Finance and
Economic Affairs. The  Environment Ministry  will be renamed the
Ministry for the Environment and Natural Resources.  “The intention of these changes is to make the government
more powerful and productive,” according to the  motion .  The changes will take effect on Sept. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
