Peru ’s sol posted its steepest weekly
decline since November after copper declined on concern that
demand will slow in  China  and as the outlook for Europe’s
economic growth worsened.  The sol weakened to 2.6530 per  U.S. dollar  today, pushing
its decline to 0.5 percent from 2.6410 on May 4, according to
Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit. That’s the currency’s biggest
decline since the period ending Nov. 25. The sol depreciated 0.1
percent today.  Copper, Peru’s top export, declined for a second week after
industrial output in China increased 9.3 percent in April from a
year earlier, lower than the 12.2 percent median estimate of 32
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Europe’s economy will fail to
grow this year with risks to the outlook “tilted to the
downside” after nations from Spain to Italy slipped into
recession, the European Commission said.  “If we were to see a further deterioration in Europe then
we’ll continue to see the dollar perform a bit better against
Peru’s sol,” said  Mike Moran , a currency strategist at Standard
Chartered Bank in  New York . “Reduced expectations for copper”
are likely damping demand for soles, he said.  The yield on Peru’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-denominated
bond due August 2020 climbed 12 basis points, or 0.12 percentage
point, this week to 5.13 percent, according to prices compiled
by Bloomberg. The price fell 0.88 centimo from a week ago to
117.96 centimos per sol. The yield rose one basis point today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
