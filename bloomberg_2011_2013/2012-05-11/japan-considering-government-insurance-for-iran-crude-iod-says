Japan ’s government may insure the
nation’s tankers that are unable to obtain coverage for
shipments of Iranian crude because of European Union sanctions,
the International Oil Daily reported.  Providing sovereign insurance is among the options being
considered, the IOD said today, citing an unidentified Japanese
government official familiar with the situation. Averting the
sanctions through negotiations with the EU remains the
government’s top priority, according to the official.  To contact the reporter on this story:
