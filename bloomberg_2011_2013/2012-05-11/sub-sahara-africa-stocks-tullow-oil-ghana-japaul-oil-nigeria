excluding  South Africa . Stock symbols are in parentheses.  Safaricom Ltd. (SAFCOM)  , East Africa’s biggest mobile-
phone company, sank 1.5 percent to 3.4 shillings, the first fall
in three days, on concern that the Nairobi-based company’s sales
growth will slow, after Chief Financial Officer John Tombleson
said yesterday sales in the year to March 2013 will rise by low-
to mid-single digits.  “The guidance was not convincing enough so investors are
starting to have second thoughts,” Eric Musau, a research
analyst at Nairobi-based Standard Investment Bank Ltd., said in
a phone interview today.  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW)  , the Accra listing of the London-
based oil company, dropped 2.6 percent to 37 cedi, the biggest
decline since March 28. Oil fell in New York, heading for a
second weekly drop, on concern that Europe’s debt crisis will
worsen and curb fuel demand as global crude supplies increase.  Japaul Oil & Maritime Services Plc (JAPAULOI)  , a
Nigerian oil-services company, fell for a second day, slumping
by the 5 percent daily limit to 57 kobo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
