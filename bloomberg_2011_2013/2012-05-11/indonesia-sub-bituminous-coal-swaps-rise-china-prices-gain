Swaps contracts gained for lower-
quality thermal coal from  Indonesia , the worldâ€™s biggest
exporter of the fuel, according to Ginga Petroleum Singapore Pte
Ltd., an energy broker.  China  prices also rose.  The June 2012 contract for Indonesian sub-bituminous coal
with a heating value of 4,900 kilocalories a kilogram rose 5
cents to $74.70 a metric ton on a net as-received basis
yesterday, according to data from the energy broker. Swaps for
the third quarter of 2012 increased 65 cents to $74.90 a ton.  Swaps contracts for China coal gained. Coal with a heating
value of 5,500 kilocalories a kilogram on a net as-received
basis for shipments to South China for June was 25 cents higher
at $98.35, Ginga said. The swap for the third quarter also rose
25 cents to $98.50 a ton.  There is an oversupply of coal for power stations in Asia,
driving prices lower as Chinese demand slows and U.S. exports
rise, according to Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.  China may consume about 200 million tons of thermal coal
less than last year as power production growth has dropped to 6
percent this year after increasing 14 percent last year, said
 Michael Parker , a Hong Kong-based analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein, in a report e-mailed today.  A commodity swap is a financial agreement whereby a
floating, or spot price, is exchanged for a fixed rate over a
specified contract period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
