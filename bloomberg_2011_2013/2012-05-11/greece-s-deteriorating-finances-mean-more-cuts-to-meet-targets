Greece ’s fiscal deficit is projected
to increase next year if a new government does not pass
additional budget cuts in the coming months.  The budget shortfall will widen to 8.4 percent of gross
domestic product in 2013 from a projected 7.3 percent this year,
compared with a target deficit of 4.6 percent, the European
Commission said in a report today. The primary deficit, which
excludes interest repayments, will widen to 2 percent from 1
percent, according to the report.  “The government aims at achieving a primary surplus of 1.8
percent of GDP in 2013,” the commission said in the report.
“Based on current projections, this would require additional
expenditure savings of 3.8 percent of GDP to be identified in
the coming months.”  Greece’s political leaders are in a fifth day of talks
today to carve out a government with  Evangelos Venizelos , the
socialist Pasok leader, pressing counterparts on a proposal for
a unity government that would avert a new election. Both Pasok
and the New Democracy party led by Antonis Samaras, which came
first in elections on May 6, have said they want to renegotiate
aspects of Greece’s bailout terms with the European Union and
the  International Monetary Fund .  Greece’s ratio of debt to GDP is projected to rise to 168
percent next year from 161 percent, according to today’s report.
The economy will contract 4.7 percent this year and show zero
growth in 2013, the commission said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
