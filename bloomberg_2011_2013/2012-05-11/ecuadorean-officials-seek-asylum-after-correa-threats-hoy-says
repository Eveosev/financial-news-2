Members of a commission investigating
alleged corruption in President  Rafael Correa ’s government will
seek political asylum after being threatened with lawsuits for
publishing a report implicating the president and his brother,
Diario Hoy reported.  Pablo Chambers, Gerardo Portilla and Jose Quishpe will seek
refuge from a “friendly government” to avoid possible prison
sentences, the Quito-based  newspaper  said today in its online
edition.  The men, members of a commission appointed by the president
to investigate claims that his brother, Fabricio Correa,
received illegal government contracts, determined Correa knew
his sibling was awarded deals worth about $700 million according
to the report.  The president’s press office didn’t answer telephone calls
today and Veronica Alvarez, Correa’s sub-secretary for
communications, didn’t immediately respond to a telephone
message seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
