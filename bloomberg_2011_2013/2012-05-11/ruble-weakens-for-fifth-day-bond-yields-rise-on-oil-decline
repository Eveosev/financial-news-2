The ruble depreciated to the weakest
level against the dollar in almost three months and Russia’s
local bonds fell as oil, the country’s chief export earner,
declined in  New York .  The Russian currency depreciated as much as 0.6 percent
before trading down less than 0.1 percent at 30.113 per dollar
by the close in Moscow, the lowest since Feb. 16. The yield on
119 billion rubles ($3.9 billion) of OFZ bonds due 2021 rose
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 8.04 percent.  Crude futures slipped 0.2 percent to $96.86 per barrel in
New York, poised for a second weekly drop. Oil may extend
declines next week amid rising U.S. stockpiles and concern the
debt crisis in  Europe  will spread, according to a Bloomberg
survey.  “We don’t see too many long positions in the ruble,”
Sergey Fishgoyt, deputy head of foreign exchange at Otkritie
Bank in Moscow, said by e-mail. “The market doesn’t look in
panic, we will watch the continuing dynamics in the
international markets.”  Russia ’s trade surplus narrowed to $19.4 billion in March
from a revised $20.3 billion in the previous month, the central
bank said on its website today. That compares with expectations
of $20.9 billion, according to a Bloomberg survey of 11
economists.  The Russian currency is more likely to weaken than
strengthen against the dollar next week, Fishgoyt said.  Bank Rossii manages the ruble within a so-called “floating
corridor” against a basket of dollars and euros to limit swings
that erode exporters’ competitiveness. The current  level  against
the basket implies the bank may be buying about $120 million a
day in other currencies against the ruble, according to
Otkritie’s estimates.  Bets on Weakening  Investors increased bets on the currency weakening, with
non-deliverable forwards showing the ruble at 30.568 per dollar
in three months, compared with expectations of 30.4706 per
dollar yesterday. The ruble was little changed at 39.0325 per
euro and 34.1268 against the basket.  The yield on Russian Eurobonds due 2015 rose two basis
points to 2.175 percent. Similar-maturity dollar-denominated
notes from OAO Sberbank, the country’s largest lender, yielded
two basis points less than yesterday at 3.384 percent, while the
yield on 2015 Eurobonds issued by state gas monopoly OAO Gazprom
dropped two basis points to 3.445 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
