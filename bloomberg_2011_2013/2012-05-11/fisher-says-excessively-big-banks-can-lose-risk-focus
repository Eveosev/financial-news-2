Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas
President  Richard Fisher , when asked about a $2 billion trading
loss by  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , said U.S. banks can become so big
they lose their focus on risk management.  “You can reach a size where risk management becomes an
exercise,” Fisher said today in response to audience questions
following a speech to the Texas Bankers Association meeting in
Fort Worth. “At what point do you reach a size you don’t know
what is going on beneath you?”  Fisher said he wouldn’t comment on an individual U.S.
institution, other than express his view that large U.S. banks
need to be split apart because they operate with an implied
government safety net that imposes their risks of failure on
taxpayers. JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer  Jamie Dimon  said the
firm suffered a $2 billion trading loss after an “egregious”
failure in a unit managing risks.  “That is not the American form of capitalism,” Fisher
said. “We are calling for significant downsizing of those
institutions. We don’t feel the Dodd-Frank Act is the answer to
the problem.”  “We pray for the big risk management teams in those big
 New York  banks,” the Dallas Fed chief said.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said at an April 25 news
conference in Washington that policy makers were “making some
progress” in averting bailouts by “substantially” increasing
supervision and requiring higher levels of capital.  To contact the reporters on this story:
