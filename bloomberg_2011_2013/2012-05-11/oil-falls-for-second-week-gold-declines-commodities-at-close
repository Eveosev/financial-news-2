The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities declined 0.8 percent to 642.23 at 5:06 p.m.
Singapore time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials
dropped 0.08 percent to 1,510.1693.  CRUDE OIL  Oil fell in  New York , heading for a second weekly drop, on
concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will worsen and curb fuel demand as
global crude supplies increase.  Crude for June delivery fell as much as $1.34 to $95.74 a
barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , and was at $96.03 at 4:14 p.m. Singapore time. The
contract yesterday rose 27 cents to $97.08. Prices are 2.5 lower
this week and down 2.8 percent this year.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas futures fell in New York after gaining
yesterday on a smaller-than-forecast increase in U.S.
stockpiles.  OIL PRODUCTS  The premium of gasoil, or diesel, to Asian marker Dubai
crude was at $16.37 a barrel at 12:25 p.m.  Singapore  time,
according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. This
crack spread has shrunk 3 percent so far this week after losing
0.2 percent last week. Gasoil swaps for June fell 90 cents, or
0.7 percent, to $124.70 a barrel, PVM data showed. That’s the
lowest level since Jan. 3.  Fuel-oil  swaps for June decreased $6.50, or 1 percent, to
$671.75 a metric ton, according to PVM. Prices are down for a
ninth day, the longest stretch of declines in data going back to
August 2006. High-sulfur fuel oil was at a discount of $4.91 a
barrel to Dubai crude, PVM said. The difference has widened 27
percent this week, the most in nine weeks, signaling increased
losses for refiners turning oil into residual products.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold slid to a four-month low and headed for the biggest
weekly drop since December in  London  as concern Europe’s debt
crisis is deepening strengthened the dollar and cut gold’s
appeal as an alternative asset.  Bullion for immediate delivery fell as much as 1.3 percent
to $1,573.82 an ounce, the lowest price since Jan. 3, and was at
$1,575.98 by 8:57 a.m. in London. Prices are down 4 percent this
week, the most since Dec. 16. June-delivery futures were 1.2
percent lower at $1,576.10 on the Comex in New York.  Silver for immediate delivery dropped as much as 1.9
percent to $28.51 an ounce, the lowest price since Jan. 3, and
was last at $28.6325. Palladium  slid as much as 2.3 percent to
$600.75 an ounce, the lowest price since Dec. 14.  BASE METALS  Copper was set for a second weekly drop on concern that
 China  may face a further slowdown and as JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s
$2 billion surprise loss on synthetic credit securities
underscored risks to global financial markets.  The metal for delivery in three months lost as much as 1.4
percent to $7,993.25 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange,
before trading at $8,005 at 3:37 p.m. Shanghai time. The
contract is heading for a 2.1 percent drop this week, after a
2.9 percent slump last week.  GRAINS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Corn set to gain for the second time this week on
speculation that a slump to the lowest price this year may spur
importer purchases. Soybeans dropped.  Corn for July delivery gained as much as 0.6 percent to
$5.91 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and was at $5.8725
at 1:48 p.m. in Singapore. July-delivery soybeans dropped as
much as 1.1 percent to $14.40 a bushel and traded at $14.4025.
 South America  boosts demand. Wheat for July delivery was little
changed at $6.0175 a bushel.  Rubber posted the biggest weekly loss in six months as
political turmoil in Europe raised concerns the debt crisis may
worsen and as JPMorgan Chase & Co. said it had a $2 billion
trading loss.  October-delivery rubber lost 3.5 percent to 283.5 yen a
kilogram ($3,555 a metric ton) on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange,
the lowest settlement for a most-active contract since Jan. 16.
The price slumped 10 percent this week, the biggest drop since
the week ended Nov. 11.  Palm oil  dropped to a two-month low, heading for a second
weekly loss, after data showed exports from  Malaysia  fell and on
concern that Europe’s debt crisis may worsen, damping investor
demand for commodities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
