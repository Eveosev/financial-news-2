LG Electronics Inc. (066570) , the world’s No.
2 television maker, plans to sell 55-inch sets using the new
OLED technology for more than $9,000 in the U.S., two people
with knowledge of the matter said.  The price is higher than that predicted by analysts for IHS
Inc.’s iSuppli and NPD Group’s DisplaySearch, who expected the
sets to sell for about $8,000 when they debut later this year.
LG can’t charge less for the organic light-emitting diode TVs
because production costs are too high, one of the people said.
The people declined to be identified because the price hasn’t
been disclosed publicly.  LG and its bigger competitor  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  are
trying to rebound from stagnating sales of liquid-crystal-
display TVs by adopting OLED technology. The OLED sets modeled
at the  Consumer Electronics Show  in  Las Vegas  earlier this year
were as thin as 4 millimeters (0.16 inches) and produced sharper
images than LCD models.  LG hasn’t made a decision on pricing yet, Im Seung Kyoo, a
spokesman for the Seoul-based company, said by phone yesterday.  Samsung, which also plans to start selling 55-inch OLED
sets this year, on May 10 said its models will cost at least
double the 5.4 million won ($4,700) price tag of the most
expensive flat-screen TVs of similar size in  South Korea .  Shipments of OLED TVs may total about 50,000 units this
year and reach 5 million by 2015, according to Paul Semenza,
senior vice president of analyst services at  Santa Clara ,
California-based  DisplaySearch .  LG has dropped 3.8 percent in Seoul trading this year,
 compared  with a 5 percent gain for the benchmark Kospi index and
a 23 percent climb for Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung.  OLED TVs can be thinner than Apple Inc.’s iPad because they
use organically glowing materials to display images without the
need for separate backlights required in LCD models.  LG Display Co., a flat-screen making affiliate of LG
Electronics, has a capacity to produce 48,000 OLED TV panels a
month, Chief Financial Officer James Jeong said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
