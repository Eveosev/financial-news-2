The world’s richest people lost a
combined $17.1 billion this week as concern over  JPMorgan Chase
& Co. (JPM) ’s $2 billion trading loss and the weakening euro pushed
the  Standard & Poor’s (SPY)  500 Index to a two-month low.  Carlos Slim , the world’s richest man, lost the most. The
Mexican mogul’s fortune fell by $4.2 billion during the week as
shares of his Mexico City-based  America Movil SAB (AMXL)  dropped 3.82
percent, its biggest weekly loss since December 2011.  The company, the biggest wireless carrier in the Americas,
said May 8 it would spend as much as $3.4 billion to buy
additional shares of Dutch phone operator  Royal KPN NV (KPN)  in an
effort to further the mogul’s European ambitions.  “America Movil investors see a lot of problems in his bid
for KPN,” Jos Versteeg, an Amsterdam-based analyst at Theodoor
Gillissen Bankiers, said in a telephone interview May 11. “Slim
has found it extremely difficult to get a foothold in the
European telecom market. He hasn’t succeeded in  Spain , in Italy,
in Serbia and in Poland. That must hurt for Latin America’s most
successful businessman.”  The 72-year-old has a net worth of $69.6 billion, according
to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, a daily ranking of the
world’s 40 richest people. The combined net worth of the
ranking: $1 trillion.  During the week, the euro extended its longest slump since
2008 as Greece struggled to form a government and concern grew
that Spanish banks are underfunded. The S&P 500 fell 1.15
percent to 1353.39, while the STOXX Europe 600 lost 0.41 percent
to close at 251.97.  Buffett, Gates   Bill Gates, 56, ranks second on the list with a net worth
of $61.8 billion, up 10.1 percent year-to-date. Placing third is
 Warren Buffett . The  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/B)  chairman is worth
$45.7 billion, up $313 million during the week.  “Berkshire will continue to grow,” Buffett, 81, said in
an interview with Bloomberg Television after the company’s May 5
shareholders meeting in Omaha, Nebraska.  Buffett said Berkshire’s $34 billion purchase of Burlington
Northern Santa Fe LLC in 2010 “will not be the limit,” and
that he is looking for bigger acquisitions. The company has
$37.8 billion in cash.  Berkshire agreed to provide financing to Coty Inc. in the
perfume-maker’s bid to acquire  Avon Products Inc. (AVP)  Coty said it
increased its offer for the world’s largest direct seller of
cosmetics to about $10.7 billion on May 10.  Casino mogul Sheldon Adelson’s fortune fell by $1.1 billion
during the week as shares of his Nevada-based  Las Vegas Sands
Corp. (LVS)  dropped 4.53 percent. The 78-year-old is the 12th richest
person in the world, with a net worth of $23.7 billion.  Rinehart in Peril  Cheng Yu Tung,  Hong Kong ’s second-richest man, dropped $705
million. Shares of the tycoon’s  Chow Tai Fook Jewellery Group
Ltd. (1929) , the largest jeweler in China and Hong Kong, fell 2.58
percent. He is worth $19 billion.  Australian mining heiress Gina Rinehart, 58, is in peril of
falling off the index. On May 9, Rinehart’s children won the
right to a 23.5 percent share of a trust that holds the majority
of the family’s $18.2 billion fortune, the Sydney Morning Herald
 reported .  Rinehart’s lawyers disclosed she had moved the trust’s
vesting date from 2068 to April 30 of this year. The
billionaire’s three oldest children, who sued in September 2011
to have their mother removed as trustee, haven’t decided whether
to take ownership of their shares in the trust because they
don’t know the tax implications, the newspaper said.  The  Bloomberg Billionaires Index  takes measure of the
