Kenya ’s shilling snapped three days
of losses as the central bank accepted more bids for repurchase
agreements than it had offered.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy appreciated
0.3 percent to 83.25 per dollar as of 1:44 p.m. in Nairobi.  Kenya’s central bank accepted all 9.3 billion shillings of
bids received for seven-day repurchase agreements after
originally offering 5 billion shillings, said Godfrey Putunoi, a
dealer at the bank’s money-market department. The central bank
had stayed out of the money market the last three days.  The weighted average rate for the repos was 16.073 percent,
Putunoi said by phone today from Nairobi, the capital. The bank
has mopped up a total of 26 billion shillings through repurchase
agreement from April 27 through May 7, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The Tanzania’s shilling strengthened the first time in
three days, appreciating 0.5 percent to 1,574 per dollar, while
the Ugandan shilling was unchanged at 2,465 to the dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
