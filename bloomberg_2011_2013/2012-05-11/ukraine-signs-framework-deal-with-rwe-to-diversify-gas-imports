Ukraine’s state-owned energy company
NAK Naftogaz Ukrainy signed a framework accord with  RWE AG (RWE)  for
natural-gas imports as the country seeks to diversify supplies.  The agreement with  Germany ’s second-biggest utility was
signed this month and provides for the possibility of gas
imports to Ukraine, Naftogaz, based in the capital Kiev, said
today in e-mailed statement. Separate contracts will be needed
to specify volumes and price, the company said.  Ukraine relies on  Russia  for about 70 percent of its annual
natural-gas use of 52 billion cubic meters and has been in talks
since 2010 with Russia’s OAO Gazprom on cutting prices and
volumes under an existing 10-year accord. To buy gas from RWE,
Ukraine would need to arrange facilities to transport fuel from
west to east, said Volodymyr Omelchenko, an analyst at the
Razumkov Center for Economy and Political Studies.  “Volumes of deliveries could be under 3 billion cubic
meters into Ukraine,” Omelchenko said by phone from Kiev today.
“This is quite significant but not critical for Ukraine and
won’t impact the policies of Gazprom on revision of the existing
contract.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
