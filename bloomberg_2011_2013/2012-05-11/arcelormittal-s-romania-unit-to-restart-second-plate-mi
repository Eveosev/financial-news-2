ArcelorMittal (MT)  Galati, the Romanian
unit of the worldâ€™s largest steelmaker ArcelorMittal, plans to
restart a second production unit in the coming weeks to boost
its output, according to an e-mailed statement today.  The company said it seeks to restart a second plate mill to
increase flexibility and avoid bottlenecks at the other mill as
the procedure may increase the production capacity of the Galati
unit to 1 million tons per year, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
