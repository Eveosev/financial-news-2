Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG)  led Czech shares
down for a second week as JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s $2 billion
surprise trading loss added to concern the euro area may not
contain its debt crisis, driving investors from riskier assets
worldwide.  The Austrian lender slumped 1.9 percent to 404.3 koruna by
10:30 a.m. in  Prague , poised for a 3.7 percent weekly drop, its
biggest since the five days ended April 6. The Czech  PX (PX)  index,
in which Erste has a 19 percent weighting, slid 0.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
