The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default increased, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  rose 2 basis points to 181 basis points
as of 8:22 a.m. in  Hong Kong ,  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  prices show.
The gauge is set for its highest close since Jan. 31, according
to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index advanced 2 basis points
to 179 as of 10:22 a.m. in Sydney, Credit Agricole prices show.
The index is poised to close at the highest level since Jan. 9,
according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles
prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index was little changed at 200
basis points as of 9:20 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Deutsche
Bank AG prices. The measure reached 204 basis points on May 9,
the highest since Nov. 30, CMA data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
