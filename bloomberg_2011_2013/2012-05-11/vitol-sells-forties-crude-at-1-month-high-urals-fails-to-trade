 North Sea  Forties crude from Vitol Group at the highest price in
a month. No bids or offers were made for Russian Urals for the
second day.  Three supertankers were booked to haul North Sea crude for
loading in May to  South Korea , the most since January, according
to tanker reports and ship-tracking data from IHS Inc.  North Sea  Morgan Stanley bought the cargo of Forties for loading on

of 2012, resulting in lost production of $300 million to $400
million, de Margerie told shareholders at a meeting in Paris.  Mediterranean/Urals  Urals was at 60 cents a barrel less than Dated Brent in the
