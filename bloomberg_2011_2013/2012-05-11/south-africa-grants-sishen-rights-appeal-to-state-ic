South Africa  won permission to appeal
a court ruling that annulled its award of rights at the nation’s
biggest iron-ore mine to Imperial Crown Trading 289 (Pty) Ltd.  “My word should not be the last and final word,” Judge
Raymond Zondo of the North Gauteng High Court said in Pretoria
today. The matter is important enough for it to be heard by the
country’s Supreme Court of Appeal, he said.  The court in December overturned the award of a prospecting
permit at the Sishen mine to Imperial, whose owners include a
business partner of President Jacob Zuma’s son, Duduzane. Sishen
Iron Ore, the division of  Anglo American Plc (AAL) ’s  Kumba Iron Ore
Ltd. (KIO)  unit that operates the mine, and  ArcelorMittal South Africa
Ltd. (ACL)  had asked the court to annul the award.  ArcelorMittal (MT)  South
Africa previously held part of the mining right to the property.  In March 2010, Kumba canceled a 2001 accord to supply 6.25
million metric tons of ore a year from Sishen to ArcelorMittal
South Africa at cost plus 3 percent. Kumba said it lapsed
because ArcelorMittal failed to renew its mining license for a
portion of the deposit, an argument rejected by the steelmaker.  ArcelorMittal South Africa declined for a fourth day,
losing 0.2 percent to 55.35 rand by the 5 p.m. close in
Johannesburg. Kumba retreated 1 percent to 521.61 rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
