Germany , which plans to sell more
European Union carbon allowances starting next year, will give
56 percent fewer away, according to figures from the federal
environment agency Umweltbundesamt.  The nation will hand out about 1.4 billion metric tons of
the permits to 1,814 factories, including plants operated by
 Volkswagen AG (VOW)  and  BASF SE (BAS) , in the eight years through 2020,
according to the data published today. That’s 175 million tons a
year on average and compares with 401 million tons of free
allowances granted last year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The decision on allowances to the  individual plants  is
“preliminary,” as they have to be verified by the European
Commission in Brussels, regulator of the carbon market, the
agency said today in an e-mailed statement.  EU nations have granted about 97 percent of carbon
allowances for free in the five years through this year, easing
emitters into the program, according to data from the U.K.
Department of Energy and Climate Change. Western European power
stations must buy all allowances starting in 2013.  Factories in industries that have successfully argued they
may be hurt by carbon trading because of price competition in
international markets for products will continue to get at least
a portion of allowances at no charge after this year, according
to the system’s rules.  The bloc’s carbon market is the world’s biggest greenhouse
gas cap-and-trade program by traded volume.  To contact the reporters on this story:
