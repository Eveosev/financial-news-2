Switzerland stocks  advanced as U.S.
 consumer confidence  rose to a four-year high in May, outweighing
the Greek political crisis and  JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM) ’s
announcement of a $2 billion trading loss.  Holcim Ltd. (HOLN)  and Actelion Ltd. led gains. Zurich Insurance
AG lost 2 percent.  The Swiss Market Index gained 0.5 percent to 5,954.88 at
the close of trading in Zurich. The gauge has still lost 1.7
percent this week as Greek leaders struggled to form a
government after inconclusive elections, raising questions about
that nation’s ability to obtain financial rescue and pay back
its debt on time. The Swiss Performance Index rose 0.5 percent.  “Slight optimism that current negotiations in Greece will
lead to the formation of a unity government soon and much better
than expected Michigan sentiment data are giving stocks a lift
to the upside in late trading,” Markus Huber, head of German
sales trading at ETX Capital in  London .  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
index of U.S. consumer sentiment climbed to 77.8, the highest
since January 2008, from 76.4 the prior month. The gauge was
projected to drop to 76, according to the median forecast of 68
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer  Jamie Dimon  said the firm
suffered the loss after an “egregious” failure in a unit
managing risks. The firm’s chief investment office, run by Ina
Drew, 55, took flawed positions on synthetic credit securities
that remain volatile and may cost an additional $1 billion this
quarter or next, Dimon said.  Greek Government Talks  Greece’s politicians entered their fifth day of talks today
to form a unity government headed by  Evangelos Venizelos , the
socialist Pasok leader, to avoid another election.  The impasse has renewed concerns over  Greece ’s ability to
comply with the terms of its two bailouts negotiated since May
2010 and sparked concerns that the country may leave the euro.  In  China , a report showed that the country’s industrial
output rose 9.3 percent in April from a year earlier. That
compared with the 12.2 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey and 11.9 percent in March.  Gross domestic product in the 17-nation euro area will drop
0.3 percent, the European Commission said today, reiterating a
February forecast. Greece will have the deepest contraction,
with GDP declining 4.7 percent this year, while the economies of
Spain and  Italy  are seen shrinking 1.8 percent and 1.4 percent.
In 2013, the euro-region economy may expand 1 percent.  Holcim, Actelion  Holcim, the world’s second-biggest cement company, gained
1.9 percent to 55.20 Swiss francs.  Actelion Ltd (ATLN) , the country’s largest biotechnology company,
rose 2.2 percent to 39.10 francs, gaining for a second day.  Syngenta AG (SYNN) , a maker of agricultural pesticides, gained 1.9
percent to 313.70 francs.  Swiss drugmaker  Novartis AG (NOVN)  added 1.2 percent to 49.72
francs, while SGS SA, the world’s largest product-inspection
company, gained 1 percent to 1,746 francs.  Zurich Insurance, Switzerland’s biggest insurer, lost 2
percent to 208.40 francs, dropping for a fourth day.  Swiss Re AG (SREN)  slid 0.9 percent to 56.40 francs.  ABB Ltd, the largest power-grid supplier, fell 1.2 percent
to 15.79 francs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
