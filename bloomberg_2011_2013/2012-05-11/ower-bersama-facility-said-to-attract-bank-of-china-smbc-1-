PT Tower Bersama Infrastructure (TBIG) ’s
$325 million loan has attracted commitments in general
syndication from PT Bank Danamon Indonesia,  Bank of China Ltd. (3988) 
and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp., according to two people
familiar with the matter.  Tower Bersama is targeting to complete marketing of the
loan today or May 14 and expects five to ten banks to join in
syndication, Gavin Caudle, an adviser to the board of directors
and a founder of the company, said in an e-mailed response to
questions today.  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., Bank of Tokyo-
Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd., DBS Bank Ltd., Oversea-Chinese Banking
Corp. and United Overseas Banking Ltd. were hired by the
Jakarta-based provider of telecommunications infrastructure to
help arrange the senior debt facility, according to a March 21
e-mailed statement. Proceeds will be used to help fund Tower
Bersama’s purchase of 2,500 mobile phone towers from PT Indosat
and for other capital expenditure requirements, according to the
statement.  Banks that joined the loan as arrangers prior to general
syndication include PT Bank Central Asia, PT Bank Negara
Indonesia Persero, CIMB Group Holdings Bhd., Credit Agricole SA,
HSBC Holdings Plc and Qatar National Bank SAQ, Caudle said.  Tower Bersama is separately seeking a $50 million mezzanine
loan that is being provided solely by Standard Bank Group Ltd.,
Caudle said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
