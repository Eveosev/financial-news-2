Yahoo (YHOO) ! Inc. Chief Executive Officer
 Scott Thompson , under fire after the company misstated his
credentials, said he didn’t provide incorrect information or a
resume to Yahoo, according to a person briefed on the remarks.  Thompson made his comments during a meeting with executives
yesterday, according to the person, who asked not to be
identified because the meeting was private. Yahoo said last week
that the misrepresented credentials were an “inadvertent”
error.  Yahoo, which named Thompson CEO in January, is under
pressure from investor Third Point LLC, which first pointed out
the discrepancy in his resume. Sunnyvale, California-based Yahoo
said May 8 that it formed a committee of three recently
appointed independent board members to review Thompson’s
academic credentials and the vetting process that preceded his
selection as CEO.  Amanda Pires, spokeswoman for Yahoo, declined to comment.  Thompson’s remarks were previously reported by Reuters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
