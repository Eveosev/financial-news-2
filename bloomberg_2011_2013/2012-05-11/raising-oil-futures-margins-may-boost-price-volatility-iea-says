Rising margin requirements in oil
futures trading may increase volatility and concentrate market
share in the hands of large speculators, the  International
Energy Agency  said.  The Obama administration proposed rules on April 17 to
strengthen the oversight of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission to give it authority to raise margin requirements in
oil futures trading.  “If we consider raising margin requirements to a very high
level through regulations to combat speculation, then we might
find that certain trader groups, especially the hedgers and
cash-constrained small speculators, will be driven out of the
market,” the Paris-based adviser to oil-consuming nations said
today in its monthly Oil Market Report.  This would increase “concentration share where few
traders, especially large traders, participate in the price
discovery” and lead to “more volatile, rather than more
stable, oil markets.”  The IEA report also said that while higher margins may
increase oil price volatility they may have “no effect on  price
levels ,” a reference to the overall price direction trend,
which depends on physical supply and demand.  Separately,  CME Group Inc. (CME) , the world’s largest futures
exchange, said on May 2 it would raise margins for non-hedged
accounts from May 7 to comply with new regulations. On May 4,
the CME received from U.S. regulators a 90-day extension for
implementing those changes, under which members would have been
treated as speculators for outright positions, paying a higher
margin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
