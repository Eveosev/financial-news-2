The European Union imposed tariffs as
high as 61.4 percent on aluminum radiators from  China  to help
Italian and Polish producers compete with cheaper imports.  The duties punish Chinese exporters such as Zhejiang
Guangying Machinery Co. for selling the radiators in the EU
below cost, a practice known as dumping.  European manufacturers including  Italy ’s Fondital SpA and
 Poland ’s Armatura Krakow SA have suffered “material injury” as
a result of dumped imports from China, the European Commission,
the 27-nation EU’s trade authority in Brussels, said today in
the  Official Journal . The levies, due to take effect tomorrow,
are for six months and may be prolonged for five years.  Chinese exporters expanded their combined share of the EU
market for aluminum radiators to 24 percent in the 12 months
through June 2011 from 13 percent in 2008, according to the
commission.  The duties are the preliminary outcome of an inquiry that
the commission opened last August after a dumping complaint
against China by an industry group on behalf of producers that
account for more than 25 percent of the EU’s output of aluminum
radiators. The levies range from 12.6 percent to 61.4 percent,
depending on the Chinese company. Zhejiang Guangying Machinery
faces a 21.2 percent levy.  EU governments, acting on a proposal from the commission,
must decide within six months whether to turn the provisional
anti-dumping duties into “definitive” levies lasting for five
years. The rates of any definitive duties can change.  To contact the reporter on this story:
