Statoil ASA (STL)  entered a partnership
with Cirque Resources to search for shale oil and gas in the
Heath area of the state of Montana in the U.S.  Norway’s largest oil and gas producer bought stakes of as
much as 50 percent in “several blocks,” spokesman Baard Glad
Pedersen said by phone from Oslo today. Cirque, a closely held
U.S. company, will be operator at all of the prospects, he said.  “These are small investments, at a very early stage,”
Pedersen said. “We’re looking for new opportunities within
shale oil and gas.”  Statoil is expanding abroad and into so-called
unconventional resources in  North America  to boost reserves of
oil and gas amid dwindling output from aging fields off the
coast of  Norway . The company last year spent $4.4 billion buying
Brigham Exploration Co. to gain access to the Bakken and Three
Forks areas.  Cirque has drilled four wells at Heath and recently
notified authorities of a commercial find with an initial test
production rate of more than 270 barrels a day, Upstream, an
Oslo-based weekly newspaper, reported today.  Statoil plans to increase production to 2.5 million barrels
of oil a day by 2020 from more than 2 million now.  To contact the reporter on this story:
