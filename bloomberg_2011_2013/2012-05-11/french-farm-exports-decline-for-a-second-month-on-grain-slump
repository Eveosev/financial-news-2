France ’s farm and food exports, the
world’s fifth-biggest by value, declined for a second month in
March, slipping 3.6 percent as grain shipments dropped.  Exports of farm products and food fell to 5.25 billion
euros ($6.8 billion) from 5.45 billion euros a year earlier, the
 Agriculture Ministry  said in an online  report  today. February’s
drop was the first annual slide since January 2010.  France is the largest European Union farm producer and in
the 27-nation bloc trails only the Netherlands and Germany in
value of agricultural exports, World Trade Organization data
show. Farm products and food contributed a 1.19 billion-euro
surplus to France’s current account in March.  “Sales of grains are in very strong decline, especially on
the destination  Morocco ,” the ministry said.  France’s grain shipments excluding rice fell to 749 million
euros from 963 million euros in March last year, the ministry
reported. Oilseed and protein-crop exports rose to 150 million
euros from 144 million euros.  The value of soft-wheat exports fell 37 percent on fewer
shipments to Morocco and falling prices, while durum-wheat
exports dropped 53 percent on lower demand from  Algeria , the
ministry wrote. Corn exports climbed 28 percent on deliveries to
the Netherlands, Spain and the U.K., the report showed.  Wine and champagne shipments rose to 635 million euros from
631 million euros, while overall beverage exports advanced to
1.11 billion euros from 1.09 billion euros, helped by demand for
spirits from  China , according to the ministry.  France imported 4.07 billion euros of agricultural goods
and food in the month, compared with 4.17 billion euros in March
2011, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
