The  International Monetary Fund  said
it had estimated net income of $2.3 billion in the fiscal year
ended April 30, which it will add to its precautionary reserves
as a protection against growing risks.  “The Fund is facing increased credit risk in light of a
surge in program lending in the context of the global crisis,”
the IMF staff wrote in a report released today.  “While the Fund has a multi-layered framework for managing
credit risks, including the strength of its lending policies and
its preferred creditor status, there is a need to increase the
Fund’s reserves in order to help mitigate the elevated credit
risks,” the staff said in the report.  The Washington-based IMF is co-financing loans to  Greece ,
Ireland and  Portugal  to help stem the  European debt crisis , with
Greece representing the IMF’s largest loan on record. As a
result, the IMF last month decided to raise reserves in the
medium term to about $30.8 billion.  Net income last year was about $6 billion, including a
profit of about $4.9 billion from gold sales.  To contact the reporters on this story:
