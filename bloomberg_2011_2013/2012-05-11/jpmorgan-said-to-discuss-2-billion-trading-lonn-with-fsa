JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  is in
discussions with the U.K.’s financial regulator over the role
London employees had in a $2 billion trading loss, according to
two people familiar with the talks.  The Financial Services Authority is speaking with officials
at the bank to determine the cause of the loss, said the people,
who declined to be identified because they weren’t authorized to
speak on the matter. The agency hasn’t opened a formal
investigation and there was no evidence of criminal activity,
according to the people.  The bank’s Chief Executive Officer  Jamie Dimon  said
yesterday that the New York-based firm suffered the loss after
an “egregious” failure in a unit involved in managing risks.
The firm’s chief investment office took flawed positions on
synthetic credit securities that remain volatile and may cost an
additional $1 billion this quarter or next, Dimon said. He
attributed it to “errors, sloppiness and bad judgment.”  The $2 billion loss occurred in  London  under multiple
traders, according to an executive at the bank, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity.  Spokesmen for the FSA and JPMorgan declined to immediately
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
