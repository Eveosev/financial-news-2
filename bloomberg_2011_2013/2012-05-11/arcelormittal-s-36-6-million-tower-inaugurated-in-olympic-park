A 22.7 million pound ($36.6 million)
red tower designed by sculptor  Anish Kapoor  and sponsored by
 ArcelorMittal (MT) , the world’s biggest steelmaker, was inaugurated
today in the  2012 London Olympics  park.  The ArcelorMittal Orbit is taller than Big Ben and the
Statue of Liberty and twice as high as Nelson’s column in
London’s Trafalgar Square. Like an oil rig twisting around
itself, it is a spiraling 114.5-meter (377 foot) lattice of
tubular steel.  Mayor of London Boris Johnson persuaded ArcelorMittal to
contribute as much as 19.6 million pounds toward the cost of the
tower, which was shown to reporters before the 2012 London 
Olympic Games, which run from July 27 to Aug. 12. The Orbit will
have a two-level space at the top with a restaurant and a 
viewing gallery, to which high-speed elevators will take as many 
as 700 visitors an hour.  “This 114.5-meter attraction to trump rivals the world over
is a calling card for investment in east London,” Mayor Johnson
said, describing the Orbit as “a symbol of prosperity and
growth.”  Today’s Muse highlights include:  Lewis Lapham  on  history ,
Zinta Lundborg’s  New York   weekend .  To contact the writer on the story:
