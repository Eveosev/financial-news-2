Vietnam ’s five-year bonds had the
best week since January 2009 after the government asked the
central bank to lower borrowing costs. The dong was little
changed.  The instruction posted on its website on May 9 cited
slowing inflation as a reason to cut lending rates. Consumer
prices climbed 10.54 percent in April from a year earlier, the
least in 18 months, official data show. The central bank lowered
the refinancing rate, the discount rate and the repurchase rate
by 1 percentage point each, effective April 11, the second
reduction in less than a month.  “We may not have to wait until the third quarter of 2012
to see a drop in  interest rates ,” which could happen this
quarter due to abundant liquidity and slowing inflation,” Cao Tan Phat, Ho Chi Minh City-based analyst at ACB Securities Co.,
wrote in a research note today. The inflation rate may decline
to “single-digits in May,” he said.  The  yield  on five-year bonds fell 61 basis points, or 0.61
percentage point, this week to 9.63 percent, the lowest level
since August 2009, according to a daily fixing from banks
compiled by Bloomberg. It dropped four basis points today.  Vietnam’s refinancing rate is currently 13 percent, while
the discount and repurchase rates stand at 11 percent and 12
percent, respectively.  The dong traded at 20,850 per dollar as of 3:20 p.m. in
Hanoi, compared with 20,853 a week ago, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The central bank set the currency’s
reference rate at 20,828, unchanged since Dec. 26, its website
showed. The currency is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on
either side of the official fixing.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
