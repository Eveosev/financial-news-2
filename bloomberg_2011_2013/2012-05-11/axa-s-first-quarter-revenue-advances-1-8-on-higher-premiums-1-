--  Axa SA (CS) ,  France ’s largest insurer,
said first-quarter revenue rose 1.8 percent, helped by higher
demand for its protection and property-and-casualty policies.  Total sales climbed to 28.06 billion euros ($36.3 billion)
from 27.57 billion euros a year earlier, the Paris-based company
said in a statement today. Property-and-casualty premiums rose
4.8 percent to 9.97 billion euros and the insurer lifted prices
by 3 percent on average at the business, it said.  First-quarter sales “are completely in line with our
plans,” Chief Financial Officer Gerald Harlin said on a call
with reporters today. Axa aims for “efficiency everywhere we
are operating,” he said.  Axa, led by Chief Executive Officer Henri de Castries,
expanded in  Asia  last year and scaled back in  Canada  as it aims
for 10 percent annual growth in operating earnings a share
through 2015. Last June, the French insurer set a 2015 target to
reach annual operating profit of 6 billion euros compared with
3.88 billion euros in 2010.  Axa fell 25 cents, or 2.5 percent, to 9.67 euros at 11:11
a.m. in Paris trading, giving it a market value of 22.8 billion
euros.  CNP Assurances (CNP)  SA, France’s second-largest insurer by
market value, declined 2.8 percent.  Greek Unit  “Maybe there is a bias against French banks today that is
also transferring to insurers,” said Benoit Valleaux, a Paris-
based insurance analyst at Natixis SA. Still, Axa “keeps
reinforcing profitability both at its life and P&C businesses,”
he said.  Axa’s life-and-savings annual premium equivalent, a common
gauge of insurers’ sales, rose 5.6 percent to 1.67 billion euros
in the quarter, helped by its protection-and-health business,
the company said.  Axa has “no more risks” on Greek sovereign debt and its
“small” Greek unit remains profitable, Harlin said today.  Sales from asset-management operations fell 7 percent to
771 million euros in the first quarter, Axa said.
 AllianceBernstein Holding LP (AB) , the New York-based fund-management
unit, had 2.7 billion euros of outflows in the first three
months of 2012. Axa Investment Managers, based in Paris, also
had 2.7 billion euros of net outflows in the period, hurt by a
voluntary exit from unprofitable employee-shareholding plans and
continued outflows at its U.S.-based business Axa Rosenberg, the
company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
