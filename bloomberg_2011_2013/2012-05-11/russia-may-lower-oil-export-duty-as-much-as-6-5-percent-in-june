Russia , the world’s biggest  oil 
producer, may reduce its  export duty  on most crude shipments by
as much as 6.5 percent from June 1 on lower Urals prices.  The standard duty may decline to $419.30 to $420.20 a metric
ton, or $57.20 to $57.33 a barrel, according to Bloomberg
calculations based on Finance Ministry data. That compares with
$448.60 a ton in May.  The discounted rate on some eastern Siberian and Caspian
Sea oil may fall in June to within a range of $210.50 to $211.10
a ton, compared with $232.40 this month.  Russia bases the export duties on the average Urals crude
price from the 15th day of one month to the 14th of the next.
Urals, Russia’s benchmark export blend, may average $114.08 to
$114.28 a barrel during this period,  Alexander Sakovich , a
Finance Ministry adviser, said by phone today. In the previous
monitoring period, the crude price averaged $120.76, according
to the ministry.  The duty for middle distillates and heavy products may drop
to within a range from $276.70 to $277.30 a ton next month, from
$296 in May.  A gasoline tax that Putin imposed from May 2011 to counter
domestic shortages may be set in a range from $377.40 to $378.20
a ton, compared with $403.70 this month. That is 90 percent of
the crude oil duty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
