Romania’s new government plans to
scrap the country’s flat tax from 2013 and introduce a
progressive taxing system pending a win at this year’s
elections, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said.  The newly instated cabinet seeks to design next year’s
budget using a progressive taxing system with an 8 percent tax
for low-income earners, a 12 percent tax for average incomes and
a 16 percent tax for high incomes and cut some social
contributions, Ponta said in a document published on the cabinet
website today.  Romania introduced a flat tax of 16 percent in 2005 to
attract foreign investors. Ponta’s government took office on May
7 after his Social-Liberal Union ousted former Prime Minister
Mihai-Razvan Ungureanu in a no-confidence vote in Parliament.  The alliance, known as USL, would win 61 percent of the
votes in a general election, a survey, conducted by pollster
IRES on May 2 among 1,209 people, showed. Romania is scheduled
to hold parliamentary elections in the second half of this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
