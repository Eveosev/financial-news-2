Italy  sold 10 billion euros ($13
billion) of Treasury bills, meeting its target as rates fell
from the previous auction.  The Rome-based Treasury sold 7 billion euros of 364-day
bills at 2.34 percent, down from 2.84 percent at the last sale
of similar-maturity debt on April 11. Investors bid for 1.79
times the amount offered, up from 1.52 times last month. Also
sold were 3 billion euros of 3-month bills at 0.865 percent,
compared with 1.249 last month.  Prime Minister  Mario Monti  is implementing 20 billion euros
in spending cuts and tax increases to erase the budget gap and
tame a 1.9 trillion-euro debt. Ten-year borrowing costs fell
more than 2 percentage points between Monti’s appointment in
November and early March as demand for the nation’s debt was
bolstered by European Central Bank lending and the premier’s
efforts to spur the euro region’s third-biggest economy.  Today’s sale “offers a measure of reassurance, but needs
to be backed up by a solid bond auction on Monday,” Nicholas Spiro, London-based managing director of Spiro Sovereign
Strategy, said in an e-mail. Italy will auction as much as 5.25
billion euros of bonds on May 14.  Political deadlock in  Greece  and  Spain ’s fiscal woes have
helped reignite the region’s debt crisis amid waning impact from
the ECB’s long-term refinancing operation, or LTRO. The yield on
Italy’s 10-year bond was 5.50 percent at 12:39 p.m. in  Rome , up
from 4.80 percent on March 8, which was the lowest since Monti
took office on Nov. 16.  “Market perception-wise, Italy is faring better than
Spain, but is still paying more to get its debt out the door,”
Spiro said. “This is a post-LTRO trading environment.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
