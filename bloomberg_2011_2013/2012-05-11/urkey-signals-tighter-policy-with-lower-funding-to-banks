Turkey â€™s central bank slashed the
minimum amount of lending it will make to banks over one week in
a signal that it may tighten monetary policy.  The central bank will lend a minimum of one billion liras
in one-week repurchase agreements at its lowest funding rate of
5.75 percent between today and May 24. That compares with the
minimum 9 billion liras it announced for the preceding two
weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
