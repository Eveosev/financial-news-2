Sugar production in  Europe  may fall
by 2 million metric tons in the season starting in October from
a six-year high in the current year as farmers reduce the
planted area in Russia and Ukraine, F.O. Licht GmbH said.  Europe’s sugar output is estimated to total 28.2 million
tons in 2012-13, the Ratzeburg, Germany-based researcher said by
e-mail today. That compares with 30.2 million tons forecast for
the 2011-12 season, which was the highest output on the
continent since 2005-06, the researcher said.  “While beet drillings in the EU are seen hardly changed
from a year ago, there will be an expected reduction in areas in
Russia and the Ukraine after the bumper 2011-12 crops in those
countries,”  Stefan Uhlenbrock , an analyst at the company, said
in an e-mailed response to questions.  Russian sugar output is set to climb 60 percent in the
current season, according to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture .
In Ukraine, sugar output for the current season was estimated to
rise by 36 percent from a year earlier, USDA data show.  Sugar production within the 27-nation European Union will
fall by 1.2 million tons to 16.8 million tons on unfavorable
weather, Licht said. Russian producers may make 5 million tons
of sugar next season, down from 5.5 million tons in the current
year, the researcher estimated.  Russian Farmers  Planted area in the EU will remain unchanged at 1.42
million hectares (3.5 million acres) in the new season,
according to Uhlenbrock. Farmers in  Russia  will plant 1.174
million hectares, a decrease of 6 percent from the current
season, as limited capacity leaves factories unable to process
all the sugar beets harvested in 2011-12, he said.  “A rather modest decline in area under beet cultivation
coupled with another fast and early sowing period in key
producers gives cause for the assumption that Europe may be
headed for another above-average crop in 2012-13,” Uhlenbrock
said in the e-mail. “The EU may be facing a sugar crop that may
be more difficult to dispose of at a time of a world market in
heavy surplus.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
