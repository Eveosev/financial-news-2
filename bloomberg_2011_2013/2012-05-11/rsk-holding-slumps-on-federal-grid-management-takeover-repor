OAO MRSK Holding, the Russian state-
run power distributor added to the MSCI Index last year, fell
the most in almost eight months following an Interfax report it
may be transferred under the management of Federal Grid Co.  MRSK dropped 9.7 percent to 2.183 rubles by the close in
Moscow, the biggest decliner on the Micex today and the biggest
drop since Sep. 22.  “MRSK Holding could be transferred under the management of
Federal Grid Company,” UralSib analysts led by Matvey Taits,
said in an e-mailed note today, citing the report by Interfax.
“Privatization could be delayed until the end of the
restructuring process.”  Nikolay Shvets, chief executive officer of MRSK, will step
down, Interfax reported.  Energy Ministry spokesman Dmitry Klokov did not immediately
return calls seeking comment, while MRSK’s press service didn’t
respond to an e-mailed request.  To contact the reporter on this story:
