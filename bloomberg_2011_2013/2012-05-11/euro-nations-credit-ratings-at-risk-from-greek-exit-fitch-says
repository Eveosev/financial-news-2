Fitch Ratings  said all euro-area
countries would be placed at risk of a downgrade if  Greece  drops
out of the 17-nation currency union.  The risk of a Greek euro exit would increase if the country
forms a new government opposed to the terms of the existing
bailout, Fitch said in a statement today. Elections in June,
following the possible collapse of coalition talks after the May
6 ballot, will be a “critical event” for Greece and the euro
area.  “In the event of Greece leaving EMU, either as a result of
the current political crisis or at a later date as the economy
fails to stabilize, Fitch would likely place the sovereign
ratings of all the remaining euro-area member states on rating
watch negative as it re-assessed the systemic and country-
specific implications of a Greek exit,” Fitch said in a
statement today.  A Greek euro exit would “break a fundamental tenet” of
the currency union, which was designed to be irrevocable, the
company said.  “In a benign scenario, the spillover and contagion to the
rest of the euro zone could be less profound than feared and
possibly provide the catalyst for greater fiscal and political
integration that would strengthen the viability of Economic and
Monetary Union,” Fitch said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
