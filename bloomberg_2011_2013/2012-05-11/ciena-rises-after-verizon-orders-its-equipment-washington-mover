Ciena Corp. (CIEN)  shares rose the most in
more than four months after  Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) 
announced plans to use Ciena switching technology in an
expansion of the phone company’s fiber-optic network.  Ciena, a maker of networking-equipment in Linthicum,
Maryland, advanced 8.6 percent to close at $13.10 in New York.
The shares were little changed this year before today.  Verizon picked Ciena’s 5430 optical switch to help upgrade
its network by increasing speeds and allowing it to be expanded
more easily, according to a  statement  today. The move solidifies
Ciena’s position as a top supplier of optical-networking
equipment, which transmits data in the form of light over fiber
strands. The deal also will help boost profit margins, said
Kevin Dennean, an analyst at Citigroup Inc. in  New York .  “The announcement is significant on multiple fronts,” he
said in a research note. Similar deals at other carriers are now
more probable, Dennean said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
