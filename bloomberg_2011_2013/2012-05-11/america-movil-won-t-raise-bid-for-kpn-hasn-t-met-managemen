Carlos Slim ’s  America Movil  SAB said
it won’t raise its 8-euro per share offer to increase its stake
in Dutch phone company  Royal KPN NV (KPN)  to as much as 28 percent and
will wait to see if shareholders accept the bid.  America Movil hasn’t received an invitation from the Hague-
based KPN to discuss the offer, Chief Financial Officer Carlos Garcia-Moreno said in an interview with Het Financieele Dagblad
today. The comments were confirmed by the company via an outside
spokeswoman.  KPN reiterated that the unsolicited offer from America
Movil “substantially” undervalues the company, said Steve Hufton, a spokesman for the Dutch operator. He wouldn’t comment
on whether there was an invitation from KPN to dicuss the offer.  If America Movil’s offer is successful, the Mexico City-
based company has no immediate plans to increase its holding,
and would probably not evaluate buying more shares for at least
a year, a person familiar with its plans said this week. KPN
could eventually be used as a vehicle for further acquisitions
in  Europe , the person said.  KPN  fell  0.2 percent to 7.79 euros at the close of trading
in Amsterdam. America Movil rose 0.1 percent at 17.16 pesos at
11:18 a.m. in Mexico City.  To contact the reporter on this story:
