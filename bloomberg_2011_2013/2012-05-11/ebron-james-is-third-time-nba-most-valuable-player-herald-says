Miami Heat forward LeBron James will
be named the National Basketball Associationâ€™s Most Valuable
Player today, the Miami Herald reported based on information
from a person who wished to remain anonymous.  It will be the third MVP award for James, 27, who won two
in Cleveland before moving to the Heat as a free agent for the
2010-11 season.  James finished third in the NBA in scoring this season with
an average of 27.1 points per game, and was fourth in steals and
13th in assists.  Seven other players -- Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (6),  Michael Jordan  (5), Bill Russell (5), Wilt Chamberlain (4),  Larry Bird ,
 Magic Johnson  and Moses Malone -- have at least three MVP
trophies.  The league declined to confirm the announcement before
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
