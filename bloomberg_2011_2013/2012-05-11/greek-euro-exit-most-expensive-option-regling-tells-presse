Klaus Regling, chief executive
officer of the European Financial Stability Facility, said an
exit of  Greece  from the European monetary union would be the
costliest option, according to an interview in Die Presse
newspaper.  The “worst-case scenario” of Greece leaving the euro
“would be the most expensive solution for all parties
involved,” Regling told the Vienna-based paper. “That’s why
the governments of the euro area are doing everything for Greece
to stay.”  The EFSF chief cited a UBS AG study that estimated the cost
of an exit at 100 billion euros ($129 billion) in the first
year. “Possibly this could be considerably higher, as one can’t
anticipate the consequences,” he said.  Regling reiterated that the EFSF had enough fire power to
cover bailouts of Spain and  Italy , adding that he “didn’t
expect that these countries will actually need funds” from the
facility, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
