Finland’s economic growth will
accelerate to 1.3 percent next year, helping narrow its  budget
deficit , the European Commission said today.  Gross domestic product will expand 0.8 percent this year,
the Commission said, keeping its forecast unchanged from
February. The government’s budget deficit will narrow to 0.4
percent of GDP in 2013 from 0.7 percent this year. The
commission in November forecast a deficit of 0.7 percent for
next year.  The northernmost euro member’s economy relies on exports
for 40 percent of its output, and a third of its sales abroad
are in the euro area, which will shrink 0.3 percent this year,
according to the Commission’s forecast.  Domestic demand is boosting the AAA rated Nordic nation, as
the  European Central Bank ’s record-low  1 percent interest rate 
keeps mortgage costs low and buoys consumption.  To contact the reporter on this story:
