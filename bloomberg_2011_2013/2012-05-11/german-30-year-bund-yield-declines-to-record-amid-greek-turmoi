German  bunds  advanced, with 10- and
30-year yields dropping to records, as  Greece  remained at a
political impasse following inconclusive elections, boosting
demand for  Europe ’s safest assets.  Ten-year bunds advanced for a fourth week as the European
ECommission estimated the economy of the 17-nation euro area
will contract 0.3 percent this year, while Greece’s gross-
domestic product will tumble 4.7 percent. Greek bonds maturing
in 2023 slid for the ninth day as German Finance Minister
 Wolfgang Schaeuble  suggested the euro area could handle the
nation exiting the currency bloc.  “Nervousness about the political outlook in Greece and the
rising possibility of a European monetary union exit is keeping
bunds well underpinned,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a strategist in
Edinburgh at RIA Capital Markets Ltd., a broker for banks. “The
outlook for bunds will be dictated by the movement of risk
markets, which in turn will be heavily influenced by political
developments in Greece.”  The 10-year bund fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 1.52 percent at 4:36 p.m. London time after dropping
to 1.49 percent, the lowest since Bloomberg began collecting the
data in 1989. The 1.75 percent bond due July 2022 rose 0.2, or 2
euros per 1,000-euro ($1,294) face amount, to 102.16. The yield
fell seven basis points this week.  The 30-year yield declined four basis points to 2.2 percent
after sliding to an all-time low 2.188 percent.  Deepest Contraction  Greece will have the region’s deepest economic contraction
in 2012, while  Spain ’s GDP will shrink 1.8 percent and  Italy ’s
will fall 1.4 percent, according to the European Commission.
 Portugal ’s GDP will drop 3.3 percent, the commission said.  Greece’s political leaders held a fifth day of talks today
as they struggled to form a new government.  Evangelos Venizelos ,
the socialist Pasok leader, who received the mandate to form a
government yesterday met first with New Democracy leader Antonis Samaras. If the parties cannot agree on a ruling coalition, new
elections may need to be held.  The German 10-year bund futures contract expiring in June
advanced as much as 0.3 percent to 143.07, the highest since
Bloomberg began compiling data on the securities in 1990.  The yield on Greece’s bond due in 2023 jumped 65 basis
points to 24.84 percent, with the price falling to 18.61 percent
of face value.  Bond Losses  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  said it had 397 million euros of losses
from the Greek bond-swap in the first quarter. The shortfalls
include 319 million euros in debt provisions from three Greek
companies as part of the country’s government-debt
restructuring, it said.  “We have learned a lot in the last two years and built in
protective mechanisms,” Schaeuble told the Rheinische Post
newspaper in an interview published today, when asked whether
the euro area is prepared for a Greek exit. His comments were
confirmed by the  Finance Ministry  in Berlin.  Italian two-year notes fell after the nation sold 10
billion euros of 92- and 364-day bills, matching its maximum
target. The average yield on the 364-day securities was 2.34
percent, down from 2.84 percent at a sale on April 11.  The yield on the two-year securities climbed two basis
points to 2.99 percent.  Volatility on Dutch bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets, according to measures of 10-year debt, the spread
between two- and 10-year securities and credit-default swaps.
The change was 3.1 times the 90-day average.  The Dutch 10-year yield dropped as much as seven basis
points to 2.019 percent, matching their all-time low.  German debt has returned 2.2 percent this year, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish bonds lost 1.9 percent,
while Italian securities gained 10 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
