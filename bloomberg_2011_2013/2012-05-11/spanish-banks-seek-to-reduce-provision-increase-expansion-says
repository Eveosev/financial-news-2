Spanish banks are putting pressure on
the government to raise the coverage level for healthy real-
estate loans to 14 percent, rather than 30 percent, in rules to
be announced today,  Expansion  reported, citing unidentified
people with knowledge of the matter. The current level is 7
percent.  Banks have also requested public aid, such as state
guarantees, to meet the provision requirements, the newspaper
said. In exchange for aid, the companies may be required to sell
assets or agree to mergers, Expansion said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
