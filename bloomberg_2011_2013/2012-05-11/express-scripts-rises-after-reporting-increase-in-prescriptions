Express Scripts  Holding Co., the
U.S.’s largest pharmacy benefit manager after buying Medco
Health Solutions Inc., rose the most in five weeks after the
company reported prescription volume increased more than
analysts expected.  Express Scripts gained 1.4 percent to $55.10 at 4 p.m. in
 New York  trading today. The stock has declined 6.8 percent in
the past 12 months.  The volume of adjusted prescription claims Express Scripts
handled during the first quarter increased 3.6 percent to about
193 million from a year earlier, the St. Louis-based company
said yesterday. Revenue increased 9.4 percent to $12.1 billion,
beating analysts’ estimates of $11.5 billion.  “They reassured everybody that everything’s on track”
with the merger, analyst Dave Shove of BMO Capital Markets in
New York said in a phone interview. “And the quarter on scrip
metrics was good. The stock’s lifting on all of that.”  The company shipped 14 million prescriptions to customers
by mail, a 6 percent increase from a year earlier that was
helped by  Walgreen Co. (WAG) ’s decision to withdraw its drug stores
from Express Scripts’ network, Chief Executive Officer George Paz said on a conference call with analysts today.  Profit excluding one-time items was 73 cents per share,
missing analysts’ average estimate of 77 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
