A fundraising dinner for President
Barack Obama in Los Angeles tonight raised almost $15 million
for his re-election campaign, according to  Dreamworks Animation
Skg Inc. (DWA)  Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Katzenberg, who helped
organize the event.   The dinner, hosted by actor  George Clooney , was for 150
major donors who paid $40,000 per ticket. The guest list
included Hollywood celebrities such as Robert Downey Jr., Jack
Black and Barbra Streisand. The dinner was estimated to have
raised $6 million, supplemented at least in part by a raffle
among smaller campaign donors for a chance to attend.   To contact the reporter on this story:
