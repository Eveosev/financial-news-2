Serbia will probably have a leaner
new government with 15 ministries instead of 17 at present,
 Vecernje Novosti  newspaper reported, citing a person close to
coalition talks it did not name.  The negotiations involve the ruling  Democratic Party  and
the Socialists who emerged as second and third in the May 6 vote
for parliament and may remain in power if they secure majority
against the opposition Serbian Progressive Party that won most
assembly seats, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
