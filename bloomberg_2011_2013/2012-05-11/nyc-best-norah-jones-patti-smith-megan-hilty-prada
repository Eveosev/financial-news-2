Designers Elsa Schiaparelli and
 Miuccia Prada  speak to one another across time at the Met in the
juxtaposition of their clever fashions and accessories -- from
the late 1920s to the present.  They also converse directly in Baz Luhrmann’s short films
of the two with the dead Schiaparelli played by Judy Davis.  “Ugly Chic” and “Surreal Body” are among the themes
explored in the exhibition.  “Impossible Conversations” runs through Aug. 19 at the
Costume Institute of the  Metropolitan Museum , 1000 Fifth Ave.
