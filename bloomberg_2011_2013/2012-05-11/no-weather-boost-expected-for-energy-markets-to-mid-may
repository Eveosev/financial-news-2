The U.S. East Coast is expected to be
warm and the South seasonal through the next two weeks without
creating much demand for energy to cool homes and business,
according to forecasters.  Temperatures are expected to be 3 to 5 degrees Fahrenheit
(1.7 to 2.8 Celsius) above normal across much of the Midwest to
Northeast from May 16 to May 20, said  Matt Rogers , president of
Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda, Maryland.  Chicago  and
the  Great Lakes  may be as much as 8 degrees above normal.  “The East Coast is fairly quiet over the next two weeks
with 70s and just a few low 80s at times,” Rogers said in a
note to clients. “The South is also seasonal to cool through
most of the period, which suppresses early cooling demand.”  Commodities traders watch temperature forecasts to gauge
energy use and needs. About 51 percent of U.S. households use
gas for heating, according to the Energy Department, while
demand from electricity generators peaks in the summer months to
meet air conditioning demand.  Warm weather from the Midwest to the Northeast from May 12
to May 18 probably won’t require energy to cool homes and
businesses, according to a forecast from  David Salmon , owner of
Weather Derivatives in Belton, Missouri.  The South may need 30 to 60 percent less energy for cooling
than usual at this time of year, Salmon said.  Warm weather expected for southern  California  and the
Southwest may require 30 to 60 percent more fuel than normal to
power air conditioners, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
