T. Boone Pickens , the billionaire
energy investor, said he’s sold off his shares in  Chesapeake
Energy Corp. (CHK) , his third-biggest stock holding at year-end.  “We do not own Chesapeake stock,” Pickens said yesterday
at the SkyBridge Alternatives Conference in Las Vegas. “We
didn’t like natural gas.”  Chesapeake’s directors said last week they will strip
Aubrey McClendon of the chairman’s post and are conducting an
internal review of his personal transactions involving corporate
jet travel, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
opened an informal inquiry. The stock  declined  23 percent in
2012 through yesterday.  Asked whether it was “the politics of the company” that
spurred his share sale, Pickens said, “It was not.”  “Aubrey is a good friend,” Pickens said. “The guy has
pulled off some unusual deals. He’s done some very innovative
things. He’s in a spot where he’s spending more than his cash
flow.”  BP Capital Management, the investment firm Pickens founded
in 1996, held 570,055  shares  of Chesapeake as of Dec. 31,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Its biggest equity
holdings were  BP Plc (BP/)  and  McMoRan Exploration Co. (MMR)   Pickens said the price of West Texas Intermediate oil could
reach as high as $128 a barrel later this year. The oil for June
delivery traded at about $96 a barrel yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
