Germany ’s Free Democratic Party fell
to 4 percent in a nationwide poll, Bild-Zeitung reported in a
preview of an article to be published today, citing a poll
carried out by Emnid.  Angela Merkel’s  Christian Democratic Union  remained steady
at 34 percent, as did the Socialist Party, Greens, Pirates and
Left Party at 27 percent, 13 percent, 11 percent and 7 percent
respectively, according to the poll, which interviewed 3,684
people May 3 to May 9. The survey didn’t give any margin of
error.  To contact the reporter on this story:
