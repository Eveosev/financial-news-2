Low-sulfur oil delivered from the
soon-to-be reversed Seaway pipeline is being offered in the U.S.
 Gulf Coast  for June delivery.  The crude is offered at July Brent minus 50 cents a barrel,
 Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston,
said in a telephone interview.  Enterprise Product Partners LP (EPD)  and  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  are
reversing the pipeline and on May 17 will begin shipping oil
from the storage hub at Cushing, Oklahoma, to the Gulf. It is
expected to narrow the discount of inland U.S. grades to imports
and Gulf Coast production.  The first phase will carry 150,000 barrels a day on the
500-mile (800-kilometer) line, with subsequent phases expanding
capacity to 850,000 barrels a day by mid-2014. The initial
transit time will be about 15 days,  Rick Rainey , a Houston-based
spokesman for Enterprise, said in April.  The lack of a pipeline from Cushing, Oklahoma, to
refineries and ports in the Gulf Coast has created a glut of oil
in the storage hub and depressed prices of certain grades
produced in the Bakken shale and Canadian tar sands.  West Texas Intermediate crude for July delivery traded at a
$15.06 discount to international benchmark Brent at 12:24 p.m.
The oil from Seaway is being offered in the Houston area at
about $14.50 over WTI delivered in Cushing, and about 80 cents
over Light Louisiana Sweet, a similar quality oil delivered in
the Gulf, based on data compiled by Bloomberg.  In April, Enterprise and Enbridge proposed transport rates
from $2 to $4.32 a barrel between Oklahoma and the Gulf,
depending on grade and contract length, according to a filing
with the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
