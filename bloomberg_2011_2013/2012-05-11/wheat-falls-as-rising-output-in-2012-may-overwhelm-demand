Wheat fell, capping a second straight
weekly decline, after the U.S. forecast increased domestic
production as favorable weather in the southern Great Plains and
Midwest boosts yields.  The winter-wheat crop in the U.S., the world’s biggest
exporter, will jump 13 percent to 1.694 billion bushels this
season, the USDA said in a report yesterday. Analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg estimated a harvest of 1.658 billion bushels. Warm
weather and timely rain has improved field conditions and sped
development in  Kansas , the top U.S. grower of winter varieties.  “The report was negative with the higher-than-expected
production numbers,”  Tom Leffler , the owner of Leffler
Commodities LLC in Augusta, Kansas, said in a telephone
interview.  Wheat futures for July delivery slipped 0.7 percent to
settle at $5.97 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. The price fell 2.1 percent this week and has slumped 8.5
percent this year.  The price also declined on speculation that global
consumption of the grain will decline after India said its
industrial production unexpectedly contracted in March on weaker
demand and  China ’s output grew the least since 2009 in April,
Leffler said.  Wheat is the fourth-largest U.S. crop, valued at $14.4
billion in 2011, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
