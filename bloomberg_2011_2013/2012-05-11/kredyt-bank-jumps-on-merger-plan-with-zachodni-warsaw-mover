Kredyt Bank SA (KRB) , the Polish bank
Spain’s Santander SA bought this year, rallied the most in more
than two months after signing a merger plan with Bank  Zachodni (BZW) 
WBK SA.  Shares of the former unit of  KBC Groep NV (KBC)  surged as much as
5.6 percent to 14.43 zloty, the most since Feb. 28, and traded
1.4 percent stronger at 13.85 zloty at 1:29 p.m. in Warsaw.
Zachodni, Santander’s Polish unit, fell 1.3 percent to 232
zloty.  The agreement is based on an exchange ratio of 6.96
Zachodni shares for every 100 shares of Kredyt Bank, the lender
said in a statement dated today. The sale of Kredyt is part of
KBC’s strategy to repay 7 billion euros of rescue funds received
from the Belgian government during the credit crisis.  “Today’s news ends uncertainty on the market about the
exchange ratio,” Michal Sobolewski, a Warsaw-based analyst at
IDM SA said by phone today. “Some investors feared it might
change.”  Santander (SAN) , Spain’s biggest lender, is seeking to expand in
Poland to help diversify its business as profit slumps at home
following Spain’s property crash.  To contact the reporter on this story:
