Iraq, seeking to more than double oil
output by 2015, is poised to overtake Iran as OPEC’s second-
largest producer by the end of the year as sanctions hobble
crude production in its Persian Gulf neighbor.  Iraq is pumping at the highest rate since  Saddam Hussein 
seized power in 1979, supported by foreign investors such as
Exxon Mobil Corp. and  BP Plc (BP/)  that are developing new fields and
reworking older deposits. The country produced 3.03 million
barrels a day in April, 7.7 percent more than in March, while
Iranian production declined to 3.2 million barrels a day,
according to an OPEC monthly report yesterday. Iraq’s output
last exceeded Iran’s in 1988, when the countries ended their
eight-year war, statistics compiled by BP show.  With rising oil supply from  Libya  and Saudi Arabia, the
recovery of Iraq’s biggest foreign currency earner is helping
alleviate concern that a European Union embargo on Iranian crude
starting July 1 will squeeze global supply. Tensions over  Iran’s
nuclear program  and the prospect of curbs on its oil sales
pushed  Brent crude  to a 3 1/2-year high of $128.40 a barrel on
March 1. Oil fell as low as $111.40 today.  “Iraq appears to be a steady and growing producer,”
 Victor Shum , managing director at consultant Purvin and Gertz
Inc. in  Singapore , said in a telephone interview yesterday.
“That’s certainly a positive for world supply as there have
been lingering concerns on output and spare capacity.”  Exploration License Round  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries plans to
meet next month in Vienna to assess output after absorbing Iraq
into its quota system when the group’s ceiling was raised to 30
million barrels a day at a meeting in December. Oil prices of
$100 to $120 a barrel are “acceptable” and won’t damage the
world economy, Iraqi Oil Minister Abdul Kareem al-Luaibi said in
an interview yesterday in  Baghdad .  Iraq  holds the world’s fifth-largest crude reserves,
according to data from BP that include Canadian  oil sands .
Production has revived since the U.S.-led invasion of 2003 ended
more than two decades of stagnation caused by wars, sanctions
and underinvestment. Since Hussein’s ouster, the government has
awarded 15 oil and gas licenses to foreign companies, and 47
potential bidders have signed up for its next auction of
exploration rights scheduled for May 30.  Iraq ‘Upswing’  “Iraq is on the upswing,”  Harry Tchilinguirian , head of
commodity-markets strategy at BNP Paribas SA in  London , said in
a telephone interview yesterday. “With all the investment
coming in, with people developing new areas or trying to expand
output at existing fields, it was a foregone conclusion that
production would rise. There was a question mark over stability
and security, but that’s been mostly OK.”  The country is targeting production of 3.4 million a day
this year and more than 4 million barrels in 2013, according to
Asim Jihad, a spokesman for the Oil Ministry in Baghdad. Exports
will increase to 2.9 million barrels in 2013 from a current
level of 2.5 million barrels, al-Luaibi said yesterday.  Export shipments from Iraq surpassed those of  Iran  during
the first quarter of the year,  David Fyfe , head of the
 International Energy Agency ’s market and industry division, said
on May 7 in Bahrain. Iranian sales dropped by 400,000 barrels a
day to 2.1 million barrels a day for the period, Fyfe said,
while ministry data show Iraq shipped a daily average of 2.145
million barrels in the quarter and 2.5 million in April.  Crude exports from Iran averaged 1.8 million barrels a day
in April, the agency said today, citing traders it didn’t
identify. As much as 35 million barrels may be held in floating
storage, compared with 8 million in March, it said.  Tougher Sanctions  Iranian output may suffer further as tougher international
restrictions take effect, falling an additional 600,000 to
700,000 barrels a day once the new sanctions are in place, the
IEA’s Fyfe said in a telephone interview today.  Bottlenecks for shipments from southern Iraq, where energy
companies are making most of their investments, have eased with
the construction of two offshore mooring facilities for
supertankers. Another two units will be built in coming months.
The country will generate $100 billion from oil sales this year,
according to al-Luaibi.  “Asian markets, chiefly China and  India , have become very
important for Iraq’s crude exports over the last few years,
making up 60 percent of Iraq’s total crude exports,” Jihad
said. “Crude exports to  Asia  are still on the rise.”  As the sanctions made it more difficult for importers to
buy Iranian petroleum, Iraq overtook Iran to become the second-
largest supplier of crude to India after  Saudi Arabia  in the 12
months through March, according to data from the Associated
Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India.  Security Hurdles  Iraq still faces hurdles to its re-emergence as a reliable
global supplier. As the U.S. withdrew the last of its troops
from the country in December, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki’s
government reinforced security at energy installations,
including the use of army helicopters. Bombings, assassinations
and attacks on pipelines and refineries have persisted, though
their frequency and intensity has decreased.  The government has failed to bridge sectarian and political
divisions, adopt an energy law, find investors to upgrade its
ageing refineries or solve electricity blackouts. Crude exports
this month won’t increase from April’s level because Iraq needs
to divert fuel to new  power plants , al-Luaibi said May 9.  Although the new mooring facilities helped boost output
from Basra by 200,000 barrels a day last month, they are
operating well below capacity given infrastructure constraints,
the IEA said. Exports will be capped at 300,000 barrels,
compared with planned capacity of 1.8 million.  Kurdish Dispute  Politicians are also at loggerheads over sharing oil
revenue with the country’s semi-autonomous Kurdish region, a
dispute that threatens projects of Exxon Mobil and other foreign
investors. The oil ministry is in talks with “a number of
companies” that may result in cuts to targets for crude
production, al-Luaibi said. The government wants to pump 12
million barrels a day by 2017, he said.  Even with the Kurds halting shipments of crude on April 1
through a pipeline controlled by the central government, the
country’s progress in rebuilding its energy infrastructure
through investment and foreign expertise has allowed Iraq to
raise crude production by 45 percent since the end of 2003,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The investment environment does look more robust in Iraq
than in Iran at the moment,” the IEA’s Fyfe said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
