The cost of insuring against default
on European sovereign and corporate debt rose, heading for the
biggest weekly increase in about two months.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 15 governments rose 1.5 basis points to 285 at
8:35 a.m. in London, and is up 9 basis points this week, the
most since March 23. An increase signals deterioration in
perceptions of  credit quality .  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings climbed 12.5
basis points to 700. The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125
companies with investment-grade ratings rose 4.5 basis points to
161, and is up from 145 last week, heading for the biggest
increase since November 25.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers rose five basis points to 270 and the
subordinated index jumped 10 to 440.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13 million) of debt from default for five years
is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face
value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
