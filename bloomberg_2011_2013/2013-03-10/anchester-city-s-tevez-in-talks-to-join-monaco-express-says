Manchester City striker  Carlos Tevez  is in “advanced talks” to join Monaco, the Sunday
Express reported.  Tevez, who scored three goals in City’s 5-0 F.A. Cup win
over Barnsley yesterday, will have a year left on his contract
after this season and is unlikely to sign another one, the
newspaper said.  Monaco, currently leading France’s second division, is
ready to pay City about 15 million pounds ($22.4 million) for
the Argentine, the Express added.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
