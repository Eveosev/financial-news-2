Spain’s Rafael Nadal had a winning
return to hard-court tournament action by beating  Ryan Harrison 
of the U.S. last night in the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells,
California.  Nadal downed Harrison, No. 73 in the ATP tennis rankings,
7-6 (7-3), 6-2 to reach the third round.  The 11-time Grand Slam champion, now ranked No. 5, returned
recently after a seven-month layoff with a knee injury.  Since coming back he’s finished second in an event in Vina
del Mar, Chile, and won the Brazil Open in Sao Paulo before
clinching the Mexican Open in Acapulco. All those were on clay,
his favored surface.  Last week Nadal lost to Argentina’s Juan Martin del Potro
in a hard-court exhibition match in New York.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
