Hedge funds cut bets on a commodity
rally to a four-year low on signs of surplus supply in
everything from coffee to zinc before Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
said prices had fallen too far and investors should buy.  Speculators reduced net-long  positions  across 18 U.S.
futures and options in the week ended March 5 by 9.2 percent to
405,885 contracts, the lowest since March 2009, U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission data show. They are the most bearish
on copper in four years, and are also betting on declines for
coffee, hogs, sugar, soybean oil, wheat and natural gas.  Commodities retreated 4.8 percent since reaching a four-
month high Feb. 13, even as optimism about the global economy
drove the MSCI All-Country World Index of equities to a 56-month
peak. Supplies will outpace demand for 12 of 18 metals and
agriculture goods, according to Barclays Plc and Rabobank
International. Goldman raised its three-month outlook for raw
materials to “overweight” from “neutral” on March 7, saying
accelerating Chinese growth will support prices.  “There is a disagreement about the extent of how much
demand for commodities will rise based on growth,” said Jack Ablin, who helps oversee about $66 billion of assets as chief
investment officer of BMO Private Bank in  Chicago . “Commodities
became a victim of their own success as higher prices have
created more supplies. People who have been looking for a
vehicle that can generate income and keep pace with inflation
have invested in equities.”  Trading Partners  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 commodities
climbed 1 percent last week. The MSCI equity index gained 1.8
percent, while the dollar rose 0.5 percent against six trading
partners. Treasuries lost 0.9 percent, a Bank of America Corp.
index shows. The GSCI gauge slid as much as 0.6 percent today.  The raw-materials index rallied 85 percent in the four
years to Dec. 31 as record global stimulus measures revived
economies and sent prices of gold, corn, soybeans, copper and
cotton to records. A weakening dollar also increased the appeal
of commodities denominated in the currency. The dollar climbed
3.7 percent against six major trading partners this year, the
best start since 2009.  Investors pulled $4.66 billion from commodities this year,
according to EPFR Global, which tracks money flows. That
compares with an inflow of $5.05 billion a year earlier, the
researcher said. Commodity assets under management totaled $430
billion in January, from a record $451 billion in April, data
from Barclays show.  Supply Gains  Funds are dumping commodities as increasing supply
outweighs the improving economic outlook that sent the Dow Jones
Industrial Average to a record high today. The 120-day
 correlation  between the S&P GSCI and the MSCI All-Country World
Index has weakened to 0.47, from 0.72 in June, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Crude-oil stockpiles in the U.S., the biggest consumer, are
at the highest level since the end of June, a government report
showed March 6. Copper supplies monitored by exchanges in New
York, London and Shanghai have jumped to the highest since
December 2003. Global inventories of wheat and soybeans will be
higher than forecast a month earlier, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture said March 8.  The slump in raw materials is “overdone” and prices will
rebound in the next three months as  China ’s economy accelerates,
 Jeffrey Currie , Goldman’s head of commodities research in New
York, said in the March 7 report. Copper will increase 16
percent to $9,000 a metric ton in six months, the bank said.  China GDP  China maintained its expansion target at 7.5 percent for
2013 and spending will rise to “maintain support for economic
growth,” Premier Wen Jiabao said March 5. The country plans to
open 5,200 kilometers (3,232 miles) of new railway lines and
build 80,000 kilometers of highways, a report from the National
Development and Reform Commission showed the same day.
Urbanization will boost the nation’s metals demand, Jiangxi
Copper Co., China’s largest producer, said last week.  Payrolls in the U.S. rose 236,000 last month, Labor
Department figures showed. The median forecast of 90 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg projected an advance of 165,000. The
jobless rate dropped to 7.7 percent, the lowest since December
2008. The U.S., the biggest economy, consumes the most corn and
is the biggest metals user after China.  Build Positions  “We do see demand coming back for commodities as the U.S.,
China and other  emerging markets  are showing signs of
acceleration,” said Rob Haworth, a senior investment strategist
at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in  Seattle , which oversees about
$110 billion of assets. “This is a good time to build commodity
positions as a demand boost may help perk up prices.”  Fund managers pulled $990 million from commodity funds in
the week to March 6, according to  Cameron Brandt , the director
of research for Cambridge, Massachusetts-based EPFR. Outflows
from gold and precious-metals funds totaled $1.12 billion, he
said. Holdings in exchange-traded products backed by gold
contracted a record 106.2 tons last month, and another 21.9 tons
in March, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Bets on declining copper prices more than doubled to a net-
short position of 16,391 futures and options, the CFTC data
show. That’s the most negative outlook since March 2009. Traders
are the most bullish in five weeks, with 13 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg expecting prices to rise this week. Four forecast
declines and three were neutral, the highest proportion of bulls
since Feb. 1.  Metal Stockpiles  China’s  inventories  of steel reinforcement-bar jumped 86
percent this year, according to data from  Shanghai  Steelhome
Information. The country’s copper imports tumbled 38 percent
from a year earlier to 298,102 tons in February, the lowest in
20 months, custom figures showed March 8. Global supplies of the
metal will outpace demand by 56,000 tons this year, Barclays
estimates. Zinc will have a surplus of 273,000 tons, and
aluminum of 1.82 million tons, the bank forecasts.  Bullish gold wagers dropped 27 percent to 39,631 futures
and options, the lowest since July 2007, the CFTC data show. The
holdings are down 61 percent this year. Those for silver tumbled
47 percent to 6,118 contracts, the biggest slump since June, and
platinum wagers fell 8.7 percent to 30,705.  Crude-oil wagers slid 4.4 percent to 167,498 contracts, the
lowest since Jan. 1. The net-long position in heating oil
tumbled 61 percent.  Farm Bets  A  measure  of speculative positions across 11 agricultural
products from wheat to coffee to cattle fell 3.4 percent to
140,580, the lowest in almost four years.  Wagers on a decline for coffee increased to 24,671
contracts, and were at a record bearish outlook of 28,454 in the
week ended Feb. 19, the CFTC data show. Supply will outpace
demand by 6.73 million bags this season, each weighing 60
kilograms, from a 1.08 million-bag shortfall in the previous
season, Rabobank forecasts.  “In the past couple of years everyone had been
enthusiastic about commodities being the diversifying risk
trade, and that seems to have changed,” said Frances Hudson,
who helps manage about $263.9 billion of assets as a strategist
at Standard Life Investments in  London . “Also, the dollar has
been playing a huge role as it has jumped against other
currencies. Investors have been disappointed by the broad
commodity performance and have continued to withdraw.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
