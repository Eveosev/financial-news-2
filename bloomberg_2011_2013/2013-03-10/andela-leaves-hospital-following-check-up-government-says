Former South African President
 Nelson Mandela , 94, was discharged from a hospital today
following a medical check-up, the nation’s presidential office
said in a statement on its website.  Mandela spent the night in an unidentified hospital in the
capital, Pretoria,  Mac Maharaj , a spokesman for President Jacob Zuma, said by phone earlier today.  “The doctors have completed the tests,” Maharaj said in
the statement. “He is well and as before, his health remains
under the management of the medical team.”  Mandela became South Africa’s first black president after
the African National Congress won all-race elections in 1994
that ended apartheid. The Nobel Peace Prize-winner spent 27
years in prison before that for his opposition to white-minority
rule.  He was hospitalized from Dec. 8 to Dec. 26 for treatment of
a recurring lung infection and had gallstones removed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
