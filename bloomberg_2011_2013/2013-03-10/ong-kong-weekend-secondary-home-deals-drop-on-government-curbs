Hong Kong’s biggest private
residential projects recorded fewer than 10 transactions for a
second straight weekend after the  developer  controlled by the
city’s richest man said it would cut prices of its apartments to
boost sales in response to a doubling of stamp duty.  A total of six units changed hands today and yesterday at
the city’s top 15 private home estates, including Tai Koo Shing
and Mei Foo Sun Chuen, compared with 9 transactions a week
earlier, according to data compiled by  Midland Holdings Ltd. (1200) ,
Hong Kong’s biggest publicly listed realtor.  Hong Kong on Feb. 22 doubled stamp duty tax on all
properties over HK$2 million and raised mortgage downpayment
requirements on some homes, the fourth round of major real
estate curbs since Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying took office
in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
