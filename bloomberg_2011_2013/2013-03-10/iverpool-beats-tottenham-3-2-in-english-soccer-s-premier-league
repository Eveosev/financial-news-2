Liverpool beat Tottenham 3-2 in
English soccer’s Premier League as the London team faltered in
its quest for a top-four place and Champions League
qualification. Newcastle defeated Stoke 2-1 with an injury-time
goal.  Luis Suarez opened the scoring for Liverpool in the 21st
minute, and Jan Vertonghen got goals in the 45th and 53rd
minutes as Tottenham took a 2-1 lead.  Defensive errors by Spurs enabled Stewart Downing to level
for the Reds 13 minutes later and Steven Gerrard to convert a
penalty kick eight minutes from the end.  Stoke took the lead at Newcastle in the 67th minute with a
penalty kick by Jonathan Walters. Yohan Cabaye leveled the
scores with a free kick five minutes later and Papiss Cisse
grabbed the winner in the second minute of injury time, firing
into goal from a pass by Sylvain Marveaux.  Manchester United leads the standings on 71 points, with
defending champion Manchester City on 59. Tottenham, which has
played one more game than the others, has 54 and Chelsea 52.
Arsenal has 47.  Liverpool is sixth on 45 points. Stoke and Newcastle, both
on 33 points, are in 11th and 13th places, respectively.  Yesterday, Aston Villa moved out of the three-team
relegation zone with a 2-1 win at Reading. Bottom club Queens
Park Rangers beat Sunderland 3-1, West Brom defeated Swansea 2-1
and Norwich and Southampton drew 0-0.  QPR has 23 points along with Reading, which has a better
goal difference. Wigan has 24 and Villa 27.  Wigan, which has played one fewer league game, won 3-0 at
Everton in the F.A. Cup quarterfinals.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
