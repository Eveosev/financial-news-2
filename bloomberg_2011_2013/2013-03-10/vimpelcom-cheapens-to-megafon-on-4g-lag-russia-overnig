VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP) , Russia’s third-
largest mobile provider, is trading at the cheapest-ever level
versus rival OAO MegaFon on concern expansion abroad is hobbling
the company’s ability to compete in its biggest market.  American depositary receipts of VimpelCom, based in
Amsterdam, dropped 1.4 percent March 8 in New York to trade at
9.4 times estimated profit, 19 percent below the valuation for
MegaFon, the widest discount since the Moscow-based company’s
initial public offering in November. The  Bloomberg Russia-US
Equity Index (RUS14BN)  of the most-traded Russian stocks in the U.S.
climbed 2.5 percent last week, the first jump since the
beginning of February.  CTC Media Inc. (CTCM)  surged 24 percent.  VimpelCom, which got 42 percent of sales from Russia in
2011, operates in 18 countries and is seeking control of its
Canadian unit, Chief Executive Officer Jo Lunder said March 6.
While both companies won fourth-generation wireless licenses in
July, MegaFon overtook VimpelCom as Russia’s No. 2 mobile
provider by subscribers in 2010 and offers 4G services in cities
including Moscow and St. Petersburg. VimpelCom will roll out  4G
by June , according to its website.  “I prefer MegaFon over VimpelCom,” Luis Saenz, head of
equity sales at BCS Financial Group in London, said by phone
March 8. “MegaFon is very good in Russia and is better prepared
for 4G than its competitors, including VimpelCom. I have yet to
see a Russian company successfully expanding abroad.”  BCS analyst Anna Kurbatova rates VimpelCom a buy with a
price target at $14.18 and MegaFon a hold with a price target at
$28.55. Saenz, who has been trading Russian assets for a decade,
said he expressed his own opinion on the stocks.  ‘Catch Up’  VimpelCom began its global expansion, favored by Russian
billionaire shareholder Mikhail Fridman, in 2011 when its
Moscow-based unit merged with Italy’s Wind Telecom SpA to create
the world’s sixth-biggest mobile phone company by subscribers.  The company had 56.1 million customers in Russia in the
fourth quarter of 2012, compared with 71.2 million for OAO
Mobile TeleSystems, or MTS, the country’s biggest mobile phone
operator, and 62.6 million for MegaFon, data by Moscow-based
researcher Advanced Communications & Media show.  VimpelCom is going to “catch up in 2013 as we are behind
MTS and MegaFon,” CEO Lunder said on the March 6 conference
call. The company reported a profit in the fourth quarter,
compared with a loss a year earlier.  ‘Tougher Year’  “2013 will be a tougher year, with the company committing
to necessary reinvestment in Russia,” JP Davids and Roman Arbuzov, analysts at Barclays Plc in London who rate the stock
sell, wrote in an e-mailed report on March 8. “Despite this
reinvestment, we do not see the network gap to peers closed. We
prefer MegaFon and see it as the market share taker in 2013.”  MegaFon focused its expansion strategy on Russia,
conducting first 4G network tests in 2010, according to the
company’s website. MegaFon provides 4G services in Russian
regions including Khabarovskiy Krai and Sochi, where the nation
will host 2014 Winter Olympic Games. Fourth-quarter profit
surged 28 percent, the company said last month, beating the
average estimate of five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  ADRs of VimpelCom fell to $12.24 in New York on March 8,
paring their gain last week to 2.4 percent. MegaFon rose 1.2
percent to $30 in London to cap a 5.6 percent weekly gain.  CTC Media, a Russian television company, rallied to $11.99
to post the biggest weekly gain since 2009.  The Market Vectors Russia ETF, the largest dedicated
Russian exchange-traded fund, rose 1.5 percent to $29.48 on
March 8 for a weekly increase of 2.3 percent. Russian markets
reopen today after a national holiday on March 8.  Short Ruble  BNP Paribas recommended shorting the ruble versus dollar-
euro basket in a report on March 8. The currency was flat
against the dollar last week, settling at 30.6975 on March 7. It
lost 0.3 percent against the basket to 34.9770.  Oil futures capped the biggest weekly gain in a month last
week after U.S. employers added more jobs than planned. Crude
oil for April delivery gained 0.4 percent to $91.95 on the New
York Mercantile Exchange on March 8.  Brent oil for February delivery fell 0.3 percent to $110.85
a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe on March 8.
 Urals crude , Russia’s chief export oil blend, decreased 0.2
percent to $107.66.  To contact the reporter on this story:
