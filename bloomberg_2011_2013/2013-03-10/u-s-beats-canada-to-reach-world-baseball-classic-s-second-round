The U.S. became the final team to
advance to the second round of the World Baseball Classic,
beating Canada 9-4 with seven runs over the final two innings.  Adam Jones of Major League Baseball’s Baltimore Orioles had
a two-run double and scored in the eighth inning as the U.S.
erased a 3-2 deficit in Phoenix. The Americans pushed across
four more runs in the ninth, with Eric Hosmer of the Kansas City
Royals delivering a three-run double with two outs.  The U.S., which beat Italy and lost to Mexico in its first
two games, are the last of eight teams to advance to the second
round of the sport’s third World Baseball Classic. The Americans
join the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and Italy in Pool 2 and
next play on March 12 in Miami.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
