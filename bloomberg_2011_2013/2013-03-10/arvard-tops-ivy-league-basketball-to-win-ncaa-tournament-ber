Harvard University  defeated Cornell
University 65-56 to win its third straight  Ivy League  Conference
title and an automatic berth in the NCAA men’s college
basketball tournament.  Florida Gulf Coast defeated Mercer 88-75 to win the
Atlantic Sun title yesterday and Belmont topped Murray State 70-
68 in overtime to capture the Ohio Valley Conference
championship and earn spots in the 68-team National Collegiate
Athletic Association field.  At Lavietes Pavilion in  Boston , Laurent Rivard scored 17
points and Siyani Chambers had 16 points for the Crimson (19-9,
11-3 Ivy), who won the Ivy League title after Princeton lost to
Brown.  The Ivy League is the only conference to award its
automatic bid to the regular-season champion.  “I just feel like the basketball gods have been on our
side,” said Christian Webster after he watched Princeton fall
80-67 to Brown to eliminate the possibility of a tiebreaker,
which Harvard lost three years ago.  Miles Asafo-Adjei scored 15 points and Errick Peck added 14
for Cornell (13-18, 5-9).  Florida Gulf Coast (24-10) was awarded the first NCAA
tournament berth in school history after its win over Mercer
(23-11). Brett Comer scored 21 points for the second-seeded
Eagles.  In Nashville, Kerron Johnson hit a jumper with 1.2 seconds
left in overtime as Belmont beat Murray State (21-10) in its
first season in the Ohio Valley Conference. The Bruins (26-6)
had won five tournament championships in the Atlantic Sun and
now have their sixth NCAA berth in eight seasons.  In today’s championship games, Charleston South takes on
Liberty in the Big South championship and Creighton faces
Wichita State in the Missouri Valley Conference final.  To contact the reporter on this story:
