Fourth-ranked University of  Kansas 
had its worst loss in seven years as it fell 81-58 to Baylor
University, forcing the Jayhawks to share the Big 12 regular-
season title in men’s college basketball.  In other games involving top five schools, it was No. 1
Gonzaga 66, Loyola Marymount 48; No. 3 Duke 69, North Carolina
53; and No. 5 Georgetown 61, Syracuse 39.  At Ferrell Center in Waco,  Texas , Pierre Jackson had 28
points and Cory Jefferson scored 25 points for Baylor (18-13, 9-
9 Big 12).  Ben McLemore scored 23 points to lead the Jayhawks (26-5,
14-4 Big 12) who share the conference title with Kansas State,
which lost 76-70 to No. 13 Oklahoma State yesterday. Kansas will
still be the No. 1 seed for next week’s conference tournament in
 Kansas City .  To contact the reporter on this story:
