Egypt ’s inflation accelerated last
month to the highest level since May 2012 amid a weakening
currency, bolstering the case for higher  interest rates .  The annual urban rate climbed to 8.2 percent from 6.3
percent in January, according to the state-run Central Agency
for Public Mobilization and Statistics today. Prices rose 2.5
percent in February from the previous month.  “The weakening currency is a major driver behind this
broad inflationary trend,” Mohamed Abu Basha, an economist at
Cairo-based investment bank EFG-Hermes Holding SAE, said by
phone. “This increases the possibility of a rate hike.”  The pound has dropped more than 8 percent against the
dollar since Dec. 30, according to data compiled by Bloomberg,
as the central bank started capping the amount of dollars each
lender can buy at currency auctions. The regulator has said the
policy seeks to conserve reserves, which have plunged more than
60 percent from their pre-revolt levels to $13.5 billion last
month.  High prices were among the reasons that fueled the 2011
uprising that unseated former President  Hosni Mubarak .  To contact the reporter on this story:
