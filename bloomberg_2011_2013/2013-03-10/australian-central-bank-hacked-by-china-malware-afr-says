The  Reserve Bank  of  Australia  said
cyber attacks on its network haven’t compromised its systems and
the central bank has “comprehensive security arrangements”
that ensured viruses didn’t spread.  “The bank’s IT systems operate safely, securely and with a
high degree of resilience,” the RBA said in a statement on its
website. The Australian Financial Review reported today that the
central bank’s system was repeatedly and successfully hacked
with malicious software developed in  China .  Central bank computers were infiltrated by a Chinese-
developed software designed to collect information on sensitive
G20 negotiations, the newspaper said, citing RBA officials it
didn’t identify. The RBA responded by hiring a private security
firm to carry out penetration testing, or authorized hacking of
its computer networks, to assess its security, the newspaper
said.  The bank “routinely consults” with the Defence Signals
Directorate, a government intelligence agency, “and draws on
the expertise of specialist private firms,” the RBA said in the
statement. “There is ongoing rigorous testing of the Bank’s IT
systems and regular training of staff.”  The RBA said in a December Freedom of Information
 disclosure  that several of its staff, including senior
management, were targeted by “malicious” e-mails on Nov. 17,
2011. The malware was an Internet URL link to a zip file
containing a trojan -- a hidden program -- which at the time
wasn’t detectable by the bank’s anti-virus scanners, the bank
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
