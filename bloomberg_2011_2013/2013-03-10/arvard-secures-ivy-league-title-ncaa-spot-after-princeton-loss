Harvard University defeated Cornell
University 65-56 to win its third straight Ivy League Conference
title and an NCAA Tournament berth after  Princeton University 
lost in men’s college basketball.  Laurent Rivard scored 17 points and Siyani Chambers had 16
points today for the Crimson (19-9, 11-3 Ivy), who won an
automatic spot in the National Collegiate Athletic Association
championship as the conference titleholder.  Princeton’s 80-67 loss to Brown eliminated the possibility
of a tiebreaker. The Tigers (16-11, 9-4) have one game left
against Pennsylvania on March 12.  Miles Asafo-Adjei scored 15 points and Errick Peck added 14
for Cornell (13-18, 5-9) at Lavietes Pavilion in  Boston .  To contact the reporter on this story:
