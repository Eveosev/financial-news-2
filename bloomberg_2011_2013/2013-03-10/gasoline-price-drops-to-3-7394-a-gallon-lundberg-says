The average price for regular
gasoline at U.S. pumps fell 5.56 cents a gallon in the past two
weeks to $3.7394 a gallon, according to Lundberg Survey Inc.  The survey covers the period ended March 8 and is based on
information obtained at about 2,500 filling stations by the
Camarillo, California-based company. The average has risen about
48 cents since Dec. 21, 2012, and is about 8 cents below the
year-earlier price of $3.8148 a gallon.  “After nine weeks of prices increasing we have a drop,”
Trilby Lundberg, president of Lundberg Survey, said yesterday in
a phone interview. “We can expect more price cutting in the
future, possibly more than a dime.”  “Both refinery margins on gasoline and retailer margins on
gasoline appear healthy enough to allow for further price
cuts,” she said.  Gasoline futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose
12.39 cents, or 4 percent, to $3.2035 a gallon in the past two
weeks. Futures have climbed 14 percent this year, making
gasoline the second-best performer on the Standard & Poor’s GSCI
index of 24 commodities after cotton.  U.S. gasoline stockpiles  fell 616,000 barrels in the week
ended March 1 to 227.9 million, the lowest level in nine weeks,
according to data from the Energy Information Administration.
Refineries ran at 82.2 percent of capacity, the lowest level
since March, amid breakdowns and seasonal plant maintenance.  Weaker Demand  West Texas Intermediate oil on the Nymex fell $1.18, or 1.3
percent, to $91.95 a barrel in the two weeks to March 8. Prices
have climbed 13 cents this year.  Crude  inventories  rose 3.83 million barrels in the week
ended March 1 to 381.4 million, the highest level since June,
according to data from the EIA, the Energy Department’s
statistics arm. Supplies at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery
point for the Nymex futures contract, climbed 257,000 barrels to
50.8 million.  Oil may fall this week after weaker demand from refineries
boosted U.S. crude inventories to the highest level in eight
months, a Bloomberg survey showed.  Seventeen of 37 analysts, or 46 percent, forecast crude
will drop through March 15. Thirteen respondents, or 35 percent,
predicted a gain. Seven said there would be little change. Last
week, 57 percent of analysts projected a decrease.  The highest price in the lower 48 U.S. states among the
markets surveyed was in Los Angeles, where the average was $4.23
a gallon, Lundberg said. The lowest price was in Billings,
 Montana , where customers paid an average of $3.31 a gallon.  Regular gasoline on Long Island, New York, averaged $3.97 a
gallon, according to Lundberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
