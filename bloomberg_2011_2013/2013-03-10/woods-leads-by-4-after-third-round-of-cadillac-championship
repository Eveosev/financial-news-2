Tiger Woods holds a four-stroke
lead over Graeme McDowell going into the final round of the PGA
Tour’s Cadillac Championship.  Overall, Woods has a 39-2 record in tour events when in
sole possession of the lead before the final day’s play.  Woods made seven birdies yesterday at the TPC Blue Monster
at Doral in Miami in a round of 5-under 67 to stand 18-under par
at 198. Woods, going for his second win of the year, has made 24
birdies and taken 74 putts through 54 holes, both personal bests
in his PGA Tour career.  “You know what kind of closer he is,” said  Steve Stricker ,
who shares third place with  Phil Mickelson . “When he gets the
lead in a  golf tournament , it’s tough. He doesn’t let too many
guys in usually when he gets the lead.”  McDowell shot a 69 yesterday to hold second place at 14-
under 202.  “All respect to the way he handled himself today and the
way he played,” McDowell said. “He’s going to be a tough guy
to catch.  But according to the forecast tomorrow, we are going
to have strong winds. I think that’s an advantage to the rest of
the field.”  Mickelson and Stricker both scored 69 yesterday to stay
five strokes off the lead.  “I threw away five or six shots on the greens and around
the greens, and I feel like I don’t have to play too much
different,” Mickelson said. “I just can’t afford to give away
those shots.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
