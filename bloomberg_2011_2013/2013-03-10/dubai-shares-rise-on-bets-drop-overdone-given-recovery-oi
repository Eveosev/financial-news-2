Dubai stocks rose the most in
almost three weeks on bets last week’s drop was overdone given
the outlook for earnings and as crude price increased after U.S.
employment figures signaled higher fuel demand.  Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , developer of the world’s tallest
skyscraper in Dubai, soared to the highest since October 2008.
 Arabtec Holding Co. (ARTC) , the largest United Arab Emirates builder by
market value, rose 0.9 percent after tumbling 21 percent last
week. The benchmark DFM General Index, which last week posted
its first weekly decline in four weeks, gained 1.5 percent, the
most since Feb. 19, to 1,909.39, at the close in the emirate.
Israeli shares surged as investors bet a government coalition is
near.  “Last week’s profit-taking was excessive considering the
outlook for economic growth and earnings in Dubai,” said Waleed Al Khateeb, Dubai-based senior finance manager at Daman
Securities LLC. “The general sentiment is strong and the
performance of global stocks last week helped.”  A drop of 2.3 percent last week left Dubai’s shares valued
at an average  price-to-book value  of 0.8 times, compared with
1.8 times for stocks on  Saudi Arabia ’s  Tadawul All Share Index, (SASEIDX) 
the Persian Gulf’s largest bourse, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. The 31 companies on Dubai’s measure trade at about 10.7
times estimated 2013 earnings, compared with 11.3 times for the
Saudi gauge.  Emaar is the best performing stock on Dubai’s gauge this
year as it benefits from a recovery in the emirate’s property
market after prices tumbled more than 65 percent from a 2008
high. The economy may have expanded 5 percent in 2012, the
fastest pace since 2007, as tourism, hotel and restaurant
industries pick up, government forecasts show.  Jobs Improvement  The shares rose 3 percent to 5.56 dirhams, bringing a rally
in 2013 to 48 percent. That compares with a gain of 18 percent
for the  DFM General Index. (DFMGI)  The company is  poised to post  a nine
percent increase in 2013 earnings after an advance of 18 percent
last year, according to the  mean estimate  of 11 analysts
compiled by Bloomberg.  Crude oil for April delivery gained 1.4 percent last week
to $91.95 a barrel on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange. Gulf
Arab oil exporters, including the U.A.E., supply about a fifth
of the world’s oil. The better-than-expected jobs data in the
U.S. helped the  Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU)  extend a record
high. The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  last week gained 1.2
percent, it’s biggest five-day gain since the first week of
January.  Israel Rally  Arabtec advanced to 2.14 dirhams, the highest level since
March 4. The company’s shares last week tumbled on investor
concern the Dubai builder’s capital increase plans may dilute
the shares given the conversion price and after  full-year profit 
missed estimates.  The DFM General Index’s 14-day  relative strength index  rose
to 57 today from 51 at the close last week. A reading above 70
indicates to some analysts that a security or index is poised to
decline. About 242  million shares  were traded today, compared
with a 12-month daily average of 162 million shares.  Elsewhere in the  Middle East ,  Abu Dhabi ’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI)

the close in Tel Aviv, after Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu 
said today’s cabinet meeting may be the last of the current
government.  “The market is optimistic following nearly two months of
uncertainty since the elections about what form the government
would take,” Zach Herzog, head of international sales at Psagot
Investment House Ltd. in  Tel Aviv , said by phone. “So the
reports of a significant progress toward a coalition agreement
this week is providing a catalyst for the rise.”  The yield on the government’s benchmark 4.25 percent bonds
due 2023 rose six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to
3.99 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
