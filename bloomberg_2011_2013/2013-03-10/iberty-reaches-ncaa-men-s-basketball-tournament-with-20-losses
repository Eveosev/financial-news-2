Liberty University made the
National Collegiate Athletic Association men’s basketball
tournament with a record-tying 20 losses after capturing its
first Big South Tournament title since 2004.  Liberty, the Lynchburg, Virginia-based school founded by
Baptist minister  Jerry Falwell , upset top-seeded Charleston
Southern 87-76 in the title game of the Big South tournament
yesterday in Conway,  South Carolina .  Liberty (15-20), which opened the season with eight
straight defeats, equals Coppin State’s 2008 team, which went
16-20, for the most losses by a school in the NCAA tournament.
The Flames are the 22nd team to make the tournament field with a
losing record since 1955.  “You try to grind it out in the face of adversity,”
Liberty coach Dale Layer said at a news conference. “A lot of
men quit after losing eight straight. Not those guys in the
locker room. They’ll never forget this and will never be the
same because of it.”  Liberty won four tournament games in six days after failing
to win more than three straight games at any point during the
regular season.  Creighton University became the fifth school to earn an
automatic berth to the NCAA tournament by beating Wichita State
68-65 yesterday in the final of the Missouri Valley Conference
tournament. Jahenns Manigat scored a team-high 16 points,
including a basket with 11.5 seconds left in  St. Louis , as the
Bluejays (27-7) claimed their second straight MVC title.  Wichita State fell to 26-8 as Malcolm Armstead’s 3-point
attempt at the buzzer missed, yet the Shockers still have a
chance to get an at-large invitation to the NCAA tournament.  Florida Gulf First  Harvard University  (19-9) earned a spot two days ago by
beating Cornell University 65-56 to win its third straight Ivy
League title. Florida Gulf Coast (24-10) claimed its first NCAA
tournament berth in school history by winning the Atlantic Sun
title and Belmont (26-6) won the Ohio Valley Conference
tournament title by beating Murray State 70-68 in overtime.  Five more automatic NCAA bids will be presented to
tournament champions today in the Colonial, Southern, Metro
Atlantic Athletic, Sun Belt and West Coast conferences.  To contact the reporter on this story:
