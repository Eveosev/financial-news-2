Steven Finn was the keystone of
 England ’s defiance yesterday as his team held out for a draw in
the first cricket Test against New Zealand.  Finn, a bowler who came in to bat earlier than usual as a
“nightwatchman,” lasted 286 minutes and 203 balls before he
was out for 56 in Dunedin. It was his first professional half-
century.  England had reached 421-6 on the final day when the draw
was agreed during the final session, with England 128 runs
ahead. Ian Bell was on 26 and Matt Prior 23. Previously, captain
Alastair Cook had made 116 and Nick Compton 117.  After the opening day was wiped out by rain, the visitors,
who lost the toss, slumped to 167 all out in the first innings.
New Zealand replied with 460-9 declared, including 171 from Hamish
Rutherford, making his Test debut.  The second Test in a three-game series starts in Wellington
on March 14.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
