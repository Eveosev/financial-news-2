Manchester United manager  Alex Ferguson  said striker  Wayne Rooney  will be offered a new
contract before his current deal ends in 2015, the Mail on
Sunday reported.  There has been speculation over whether Rooney will leave
Old Trafford after he was left out of the starting line-up for
the Champions League match against Real Madrid last week. United
lost the game 2-1 and failed to reach the quarterfinals after a
1-1 first-leg draw.  “There is no issue with the contract. When it has to be
renegotiated, it will be,” Ferguson was cited as saying by the
Mail. “We don’t want good players to leave.”  Rooney may have to take a cut in his current 230,000 pounds
($344,000) a week deal, the newspaper added.  United hosts Chelsea today in the F.A. Cup quarterfinals.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
