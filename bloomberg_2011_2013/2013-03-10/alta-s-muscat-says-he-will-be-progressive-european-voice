Maltese Prime Minister-elect Joseph Muscat said  Europe  “should not be afraid” of a Labour
government on the Mediterranean island nation.  “We are as European as we are Maltese,” Muscat said today
in an interview in Floriana after he addressed  Labour party 
supporters. “We want to assure everybody that we are a new,
progressive voice around the European table,” he said.  The Labour Party will be “diligent but will safeguard
Malta’s national interest where necessary,” while working with
European partners to “rebuild a solid Europe which will protect
its citizens from further effects of a crisis that has brought
poverty and strife to many across the continent,” Muscat said.  Muscat, whose Labour Party won yesterday’s national
elections with 55% of the vote, said he will form his cabinet
Monday, March 11, shortly after taking his oath as prime
minister from President George Abela at about 10 a.m. local
time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
