Malta’s  Labour Party  has won
national elections for the first time since the start of the
euro with 55 percent of the vote in the biggest landslide since
at least 1964, early projections show.  Prime Minister Lawrence Gonzi has called Labour leader
Joseph Muscat to concede defeat, Nationalist Party Secretary
General Paul Borg Olivier said on Malta television.  Voting took place yesterday between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m.,
with total turnout of 93.1 percent, a slight drop since the last
general elections in 2008, which saw turnout of 93.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
