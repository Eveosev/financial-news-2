Worsening drought across  New
Zealand ’s  North Island  could curb tax revenues amid the
government’s efforts to return to  budget surplus  in 2015,
Finance Minister  Bill English  said today.  The dry conditions were “bound to have some impact on the
economy,” English said in an interview on Radio Live. Drought
declarations were extended to most of the North Island last
week, including the nation’s biggest milk producing region.  “In the shorter term, it just means less national
income,” said English. “When there’s less national income,
there’s also less tax.”  New Zealand, the world’s biggest dairy exporter, first
declared a drought this year on Feb. 27 in Northland province,
at the top of the North Island. Whole-milk powder prices surged
the most in two-and-a-half years on March 6, the same day that
droughts were declared in other regions, as dry conditions on
farms curb the nation’s milk collection.  The government in December narrowed its forecast operating
surplus for the year ending June 30, 2015, to NZ$66 million. It
hasn’t yet determined whether the drought’s impact will be large
enough to derail that plan, English said today. The budget is
delivered on May 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
