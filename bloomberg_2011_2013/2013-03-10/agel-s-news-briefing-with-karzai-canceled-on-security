U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel’s scheduled news conference with Afghan President Hamid Karzai in Kabul today was canceled due to security reasons,
according to two U.S. officials.  Hagel still plans to meet later today with Karzai, the
officials told reporters in Kabul, asking not to be identified
because they weren’t authorized to discuss sensitive security
issues. Pentagon spokesman George Little declined to provide any
details on the cancellation.  Hagel, who arrived in Kabul on March 8, is making his first
international trip as the top U.S. defense official to prepare
for what he’s called a “responsible transition” in the Afghan
war. Yesterday, suicide bombers struck in Kabul and Khost,
killing 19 people.  The Taliban, who claimed responsibility for the Kabul
attack, is holding peace talks daily with the U.S., Karzai said
today in an e-mailed statement. The negotiations are going on
“in Gulf and European countries,” Karzai said.  His comments are “completely untrue” and “no talks are
ongoing,” Taliban spokesman  Zabihullah Mujahed  said by e-mail.  Karzai also said that yesterday’s suicide bombings “were
in the service of America.” The Afghan president’s assertion
that the U.S. and Taliban are in collusion is “categorically
false,” U.S. Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford, commander of
NATO forces in  Afghanistan , told reporters in Kabul today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
