David Wright  hit a grand slam in a
five-run fifth inning to lead the U.S. to a 6-2 victory over
Italy in a  World Baseball Classic  first round matchup.  Wright’s grand slam off Italy reliever Matt Torra was only
the second in classic history.  Jason Varitek  hit the first on
March 18, 2006, in a U.S. loss to Canada.  The U.S. (1-1) must beat Canada (1-1) today to avoid
elimination and advance to the next round. Italy (2-1) secured a
place in the second round with its wins over Mexico (1-2) and
Canada (1-1).  Canada eliminated Mexico with a 10-3 victory in a game that
erupted into a bench-clearing brawl in the ninth inning after
Arnold Leon hit Rene Tosoni. Both teams had been warned about
their conduct.  Starter Danny Betancourt threw six shutout innings as Cuba
scored eight times in the seventh inning in a 14-0 victory over
Chinese Taipei. The game was called in the middle of the seventh
inning as the mercy-rule was invoked.  In other games yesterday, the  Dominican Republic  defeated
Spain 6-3 and  Puerto Rico  topped Venezuela 6-3.  The semifinals and final game are in San Francisco’s AT&T
Park from March 17-19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
