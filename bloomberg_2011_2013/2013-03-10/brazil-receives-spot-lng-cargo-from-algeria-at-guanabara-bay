Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Brazil’s
sole LNG importer, is receiving a spot cargo of liquefied
natural gas from Algeria, according to ship-tracking data.  The Excelerate, with a capacity of 135,313 cubic meters,
arrived March 6 at  Rio de Janeiro , according to ship
transmissions captured by  IHS Inc. (IHS)  on Bloomberg. The tanker
sailed from the Arzew LNG terminal in northern Algeria, where it
loaded its cargo and departed Feb. 19, the data show.  Petroleo Brasileiro has a floating regasification terminal
at Guanabara Bay near Rio de Janeiro. Brazil’s driest rainy
season in a decade has reduced hydropower supply and boosted the
country’s LNG demand, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a Jan. 28
note.  A Petrobras official in Houston didn’t immediately respond
to an e-mail seeking comment outside normal working hours.  Brazil doesn’t have any long-term LNG supply contracts with
Algeria, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
