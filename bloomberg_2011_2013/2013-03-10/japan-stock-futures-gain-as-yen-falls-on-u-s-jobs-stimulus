Japanese  stock futures  rose as
faster-than-forecast jobs growth in the U.S. boosted investor
optimism in the global recovery and as the yen weakened amid
speculation the  Bank of Japan  will increase monetary easing.  Futures on the  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  gained 0.6 percent
from the March 8 close. Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures fell
0.1 percent with the equity cash gauge less than 1 percent below
the record of 1,565.15 reached in October 2007. The yen dropped
to 96.15 per dollar, having touched the lowest level since
August 2009 on March 8. New Zealand’s NZX 500 Index gained 0.2
percent and Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index rose 0.1 percent.  U.S. employers added 236,000 jobs in February and hiring in
construction jumped by the most in almost six years.  China ’s
industrial output had the weakest start to a year since 2009 and
lending and retail sales growth slowed, toughening challenges
for a new leadership that wants to narrow the gap between rich
and poor. Haruhiko Kuroda, the nominee for Bank of  Japan 
governor who has pledged more aggressive easing to boost growth,
is due to speak in a parliament hearing today.  “The continued strength in U.S. economic data and Japan’s
reflationary intentions buoyed global risk appetite,” said
 Michael Kurtz , Hong Kong-based head of global equity strategy at
Nomura Holdings Inc., Japan’s largest brokerage. “We expect the
newly constituted BOJ to announce around 10 trillion yen
additional easing measures at its next board meeting and
eventually to start open-ended asset purchases ahead of
schedule.”  Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe nominated Kuroda last
month to lead the BOJ, prompting further speculation of
increased stimulus if he wins parliamentary backing to take over
on March 19.  U.S. Jobs  U.S. employment rose 236,000 last month after a revised
119,000 gain in January that was smaller than first estimated,
Labor Department figures showed March 8 in  Washington . The
median forecast of 90 economists surveyed by Bloomberg projected
an advance of 165,000. The jobless rate dropped to 7.7 percent.  China’s industrial production increased 9.9 percent in the
first two months and retail sales rose 12.3 percent, government
data showed March 9, trailing economists’ estimates. New local-
currency loans in February fell to 620 billion  yuan  ($99.6
billion), the People’s Bank of China said yesterday, lower than
the estimates of 27 of 28 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
