Chelsea came back from 2-0 down to
draw 2-2 at Manchester United in the quarterfinals of English
soccer’s F.A. Cup. Millwall tied 0-0 with Blackburn in today’s
other match.  Javier Hernandez and  Wayne Rooney  scored in the first 11
minutes at Old Trafford. Eden Hazard and Ramires got Chelsea’s
goals in the 59th and 68th minutes.  Rooney started the game after being left out of the opening
line-up for United’s Champions League defeat to Real Madrid last
week.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
