Saudi Arabian Oil Co.’s trading
unit will lease storage space for refined fuel at the United
Arab Emirates port of Fujairah from tank-farm operator Vopak
Horizon Fujairah Ltd., the state-owned crude producer said.  Saudi Aramco  Products Trading Co. will use the storage to
boost trading, according to the statement sent by e-mail today.
Known as Aramco Trading, the unit buys refined products such as
gasoline and diesel to meet domestic demand in the Persian Gulf
state, while Saudi Aramco continues to market  crude oil  directly
to customers mainly under long-term contracts.  Middle Eastern crude producers often import oil products
because they lack adequate refining capacity to meet domestic
demand. Aramco Trading was seeking to triple the volume of
products it buys and sells to 1.5 million barrels a day from the
500,000 barrels of refined products it was handling since it
started last year, the unit’s head said Said Al-Hadrami said in
May 2012.  Fujairah, one of seven U.A.E. emirates, lies outside the
Gulf and Strait of Hormuz, a shipping chokepoint. Royal Vopak NV
and partners including the government of Fujairah and Dubai-
based refiner Emirates National Oil Co. operate the 2.1 million-
ton Vopak Horizon storage facility.  To contact the reporter on this story:
