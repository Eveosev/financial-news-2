Shanghai  found more than 900 dead
pigs in the main river that provides drinking water for the
city’s residents, according to the official Xinhua  News Agency .  The carcasses were found and retrieved at Songjiang in the
upper reaches of the Huangpu River, which runs through the
city’s financial center, the news agency reported, citing the
municipal government. Water quality hasn’t been affected so far,
the government said in a statement on its website today.  The dumping is the latest environmental scare in  China ,
which has grappled with lead poisoning from battery makers,
fluoride leaks from solar panel plants and acid spills from
mines. In January, a cadmium spill in a tributary of the Pearl
River triggered panic buying of bottled water, while a 2010
waste leak into a river in southern  Fujian province  poisoned
almost 2,000 tons of fish.  Shanghai’s agriculture commission is investigating the
source of the dead pigs and is taking precautions to prevent the
contamination of the water supply, according to a statement on
its website.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
