Thousands of Azeris demonstrated in
the capital, Baku, in a rally organized through  Facebook Inc. (FB)  to
protest non-combat deaths in the armed forces.  Riot police used water cannons and rubber bullets to
disperse protesters in the central Fountains Square. The
demonstrators chanted slogans such as “Stop killings in the
army” and “Stop turning the army into a morgue.” Almost 100
were detained in the unauthorized protest, according to the
opposition daily newspaper Yeni Musavat  More than 22,000 people signed up on Facebook to attend the
rally. Ali Karimli, leader of the main opposition People’s Front
of Azerbaijan Party, said “thousands of people” attended the
demonstration.  Azerbaijan’s largely conscription-based army has suffered
15 deaths in non-combat incidents so far this year, according to
Jasur Sumarinli, head of the Doctrine Center of Military Studies
in Baku. Seventy-seven died last year, he said by e-mail last
week.  Military service is mandatory for all men aged from 18 to
35 in the Caspian Sea nation, which has a population of more
than 9 million. The government has rejected calls to shift to an
all-volunteer force because of a military standoff with
neighboring  Armenia . Accusations of bullying are common.  To contact the reporter on this story:
