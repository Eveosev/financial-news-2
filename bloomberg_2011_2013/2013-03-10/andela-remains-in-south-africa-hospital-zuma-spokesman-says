South Africa’s former leader,
 Nelson Mandela , 94, remains in hospital after being admitted for
a medical check-up, the country’s Presidency said.  Mandela went to a hospital in Pretoria, the capital,
yesterday for tests to manage existing conditions in line with
his age,  Mac Maharaj , a spokesman for President Jacob Zuma said
in a statement.  Mandela became South Africa’s first black president after
the African National Congress won all-race elections in 1994
that ended apartheid. The Nobel Peace Prize-winner spent 27
years in prison before that for his opposition to white-minority
rule in the continent’s largest economy.  He was admitted to a hospital on Dec. 8 and discharged on
Dec. 26 for treatment of a recurring lung infection and had
gallstones removed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
