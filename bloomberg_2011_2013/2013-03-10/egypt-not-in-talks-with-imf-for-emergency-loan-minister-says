Egypt  is “not in need” of an
emergency loan from the International Monetary Fund and is
instead focusing its efforts on completing a $4.8 billion loan
agreement with the lender, the country’s planning minister said.  “Egypt wants to implement the fiscal and economic reform
program as we have a number of structural problems,” Planning
and International Cooperation Minister Ashraf el-Arab said in
Cairo today.  The political tensions plaguing the country since the 2011
uprising have prolonged Egypt’s loan talks with the fund.
International reserves have plunged more than 60 percent from
their pre-revolt levels. Egyptian officials have said the IMF
loan is necessary to bolster investor confidence and unlock
other funds.  Earlier today, Investment Minister Osama Saleh said in an
interview that the government was in contact with the IMF to
answer questions the fund has about the economic plan submitted
as part of the loan request.  Egypt’s annual urban inflation rate accelerated last month
to 8.2 percent, the highest reading since May 2012, amid a
weakening currency, the statistics agency said today.  News website Aswat Masriya reported earlier this month that
Egypt may study an IMF offer to provide an urgent loan of as
much as $750 million. Aswat Masriya cited an unidentified
Finance Ministry official.  To contact the reporter on this story:
