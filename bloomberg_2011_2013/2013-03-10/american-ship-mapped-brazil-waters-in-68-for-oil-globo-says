Declassified documents from the
archives of the Brazilian congress say the country detained an
American ship in 1968 suspected of mapping potential oil
reserves in Brazilian waters, the daily O Globo reported.  Brazil’s naval authorities gave seized mapping equipment
from the ship, the North Seal, to state oil company  Petroleo
Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , according to the daily newspaper. The article
doesn’t identify the owner of the ship.  The declassified documents, from 1947 to 1976, also show
that the Brazilian dictatorship’s intelligence agency monitored
phone calls by Brazilian lawmakers as recently as 1970, the
daily reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
