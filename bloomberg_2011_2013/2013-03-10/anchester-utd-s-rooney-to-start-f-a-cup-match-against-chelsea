Wayne Rooney was named to start in
Manchester United’s team for today’s F.A. Cup quarterfinal
against Chelsea at Old Trafford.  There’s been speculation over the striker’s future at
United after he was left out of the starting line-up for the
Champions League match against Real  Madrid  last week. United
lost 2-1 and failed to reach the quarterfinals.  United manager Alex Ferguson has dismissed talk about
Rooney leaving. He said the player will be offered a new
contract before his current deal ends in 2015, the Mail on
Sunday reported today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
