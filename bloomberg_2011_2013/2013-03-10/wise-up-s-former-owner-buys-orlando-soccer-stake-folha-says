Brazilian investor Flavio Augusto
da Silva bought a stake in the  Orlando  City Soccer Club after
selling his group of English schools to  Abril Educacao SA (ABRE11)  for
about $450 million, daily newspaper Folha reported.  Silva said his Orlando City investment was for as much as
$80 million and will help the team build a stadium with as many
as 25,000 seats and become a Major League Soccer franchise, the
daily reported.  Silva told Folha he hopes the city of Orlando, Florida,
will make an investment of a similar amount in the team, which
plays in the USL professional division.  Abril Educacao said last month it agreed to buy Silva’s
Wise Up and other English school brands that have locations in
Brazil, the U.S., Mexico, Colombia, Argentina and China, Folha
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
