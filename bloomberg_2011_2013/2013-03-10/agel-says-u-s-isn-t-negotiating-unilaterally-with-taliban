Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said
the U.S. isn’t negotiating with the Taliban as Afghan President
 Hamid Karzai  alleged today.  “I told the president it was not true that the U.S. was
unilaterally working with the Taliban trying to negotiate
anything,” Hagel told reporters in Kabul after meeting Karzai.
“The fact is any prospect for peace or political settlements
has to be led by the Afghans. Obviously the U.S. will support
efforts if they’re led by the Afghans to come to some possible
resolution if that eventually evolves.”  Hagel held a news conference at a U.S. military base in
Kabul after a joint press appearance with Karzai was canceled
because of security concerns.  Earlier today Karzai said in an e-mailed statement that the
Taliban are holding peace talks daily with the U.S. and
negotiations are going on “in Gulf and European countries.”
Karzai’s comments are “completely untrue” and “no talks are
ongoing,” Taliban spokesman  Zabihullah Mujahed  said by e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
