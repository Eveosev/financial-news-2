Israel ’s economy expanded slower
than previously estimated last year, as growth in exports of
goods and services remained little changed.  Gross domestic product grew 3.1 percent last year, down
from 4.6 percent in 2011, the Central Bureau of Statistics said
in an e-mailed report. The figure compares with a preliminary
estimate of 3.3 percent. In the  fourth quarter , the economy
expanded 2.4 percent, slower than the bureau’s 2.5 percent
estimate from last month.  “Growth slowed as the year wore on,” said Alex Zabezhinsky, chief economist at DS Securities & Investments Ltd.
in Tel Aviv. “It doesn’t look like things have improved this
year, judging from tax receipts.”  The Bank of Israel has gradually reduced the borrowing rate
from 3.25 percent in 2011 in an effort to shore up the economy
amid the  European debt crisis . The monetary committee held the
rate at 1.75 percent last month for a second month, as rising
house prices balanced slowing growth and inflation.  While growth in Israel was faster than most developed
countries, the decline in growth from 2011 was greater,
Zabezhinsky said. Growth in the 34 Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development countries averaged 1.4 percent in
2012, the statistics bureau said.  The halt in the flow of Egyptian gas, which forced the
economy to turn to more expensive alternatives, and the week-
long conflict between Israel and militants with the Gaza Strip’s
ruling Hamas group in November may have also affected growth,
Zabezhinsky said.  Private consumption rose by 2.7 percent last year, after
rising 3.8 percent the previous year, the bureau said.
Investment rose 3.6 percent, compared with 16 percent in 2011.
Exports edged up 0.1 percent, compared with 5.5 percent the
previous year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
