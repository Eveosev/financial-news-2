The dollar traded at almost the
strongest since August 2009 versus the yen as signs the American
economy is gaining momentum boosted demand for U.S. assets.  The  Dollar Index (DXY)  traded at almost the highest in seven
months before reports this week that economists said will show
retail sales improved in February and consumer prices increased.
U.S. stocks gained.  Mexico ’s peso rallied to its strongest level
against the greenback since September 2011 after the central
bank signaled its interest-rate cut last week would be a one-
time reduction. The pound touched the weakest level to the
dollar since June 2010.  “The dollar is still generally firmer,”  Robert Lynch , a
New York-based currency strategist at HSBC Holdings Plc, said in
a telephone interview. “The general risk-on bias in some equity
markets -- like the U.S., like Japanese equity markets -- that
tends to correlate negatively with movements in the yen.”  The dollar rose 0.3 percent to 96.28 yen at 5 p.m. in New
York after climbing to 96.55 on March 8, the highest level since
Aug. 11, 2009. The U.S. currency fell 0.3 percent to $1.3046 per
euro. The yen weakened 0.6 percent to 125.61 per euro. Sterling
was little changed at $1.4915 after touching $1.4866.  Equities Gain  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of stocks 500 increased 0.3
percent and the  Dow Jones Industrial Average , which set a record
high last week, climbed 0.4 percent.  The yen will face a test at the 97-to-97.80 zone, according
to Niall O’Connor, a technical analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co.
in New York.  Japan ’s currency may depreciate to 100, which would be its
lowest level since April 2009, if it breaches that support
level, O’Connor said. Support is an area where preset orders may
be triggered.  Bank of Japan (8301)  governor nominee Haruhiko Kuroda said the
central bank will consider buying derivatives if he’s confirmed
as governor and signaled a readiness for a quick expansion in
monetary stimulus.  Mexico’s peso rallied for a third day. Policy makers led by
central-bank Governor Agustin Carstens said the rate cut
“doesn’t represent the start of a cycle,” bolstering
confidence the bank will keep rates on hold for now and reducing
the likelihood looser monetary policy will erode the allure of
local-currency debt for foreigners.  The peso rose 0.7 percent to 12.5402 to the dollar.  Economic Data  U.S. retail sales  rose 0.5 percent in February after a 0.1
percent gain in January, according to a Bloomberg News survey
before the Commerce Department data on March 13. A separate
report on March 15 will show the consumer-price index climbed
0.5 percent, after being little changed in January. The  jobless
rate  fell to a four-year low of 7.7 percent, the Labor
Department said last week.  The threat of across-the-board cuts in  government spending 
-- known as sequestration -- failed to deter households,
economists said.  The  Dollar Index , which Intercontinental Exchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six U.S. trade
partners, declined 0.2 percent to 82.569 after climbing to
82.924 on March 8, the highest since Aug. 3.  “The market has run a long way in terms of dollar
strength,”  Sebastien Galy , a foreign-exchange strategist in New
York at Societe Generale SA, said in a telephone interview.
“We’re probably mostly in a phase of consolidations, with one
exception in short sterling, which still attracts as a bearish
trade on  Europe .”  Market Measure  The dollar has appreciated 3 percent this year, the best
performer after  Sweden ’s krona of the 10 developed-nation
currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, on
speculation stronger U.S. growth will prompt the  Federal Reserve 
to reduce the pace of bond purchases. The euro rose 1.7 percent,
while the yen tumbled 8.3 percent.  Hungary’s forint slid the most since December after
central-bank President  Gyorgy Matolcsy  stripped two of his
deputies appointed under a previous government of some of their
powers on March 8. He shifted responsibility to Adam Balog, a
vice president appointed by Prime Minister  Viktor Orban ’s
cabinet this month.  Investors interpreted the decision “as evidence that
drastic changes in the monetary policy toolkit would be
announced soon,” weakening the forint, Mariann Trippon, a
Budapest-based economist at Intesa Sanpaolo SpA’s CIB unit,
wrote in a research report today.  The forint slid 0.8 percent to 301.81 per euro after
weakening to 303.61, the lowest since June.  The won fell to the lowest since October against the dollar
after North  Korea ’s Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of
Korea said it would target the South’s incoming defense
minister. It dropped 0.4 percent to close at 1,095 per dollar
after sliding to 1,102.65, the lowest since Oct. 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
