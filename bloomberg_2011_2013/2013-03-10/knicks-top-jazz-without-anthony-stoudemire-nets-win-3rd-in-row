Reserve J.R. Smith scored 24 points
for the  New York Knicks  who defeated the  Utah Jazz  113-84
without  Carmelo Anthony  and Amar’e Stoudemire.  Stoudemire, 30, will miss as much as six weeks after
undergoing “a right knee debridement,” the Knicks said before
last night’s game.  “He’s been very efficient with how he’s been playing,”
coach  Mike Woodson  told reporters. “I feel for Amar’e. He put a
lot of work in this summer to get back on the court. Now he’s
got to go back in again.”  The Knicks (38-22) lead the Eastern Conference’s five-team
Atlantic Division, 2 1/2 games over the Brooklyn Nets (37-26)
who won their third straight game with a 93-80 win over the
Atlanta Hawks.  Stoudemire underwent the same procedure to remove dead or
damaged tissue or bone from his left knee before the start of
the season, which kept him on the bench until Jan. 1. Since
returning, he has been limited by the medical staff to 30
minutes, a time limit he exceeded twice this week.  Stoudemire, who averaged 14.2 points and five rebounds in
29 games as a reserve, isn’t expected to return until after
April 17, the last day of the regular season.  Anthony, 28, collapsed on the court with a knee injury
during the Knicks’ game against Cleveland on March 4 and hasn’t
returned to the team. He was averaging 28.2 points and 6.2
rebounds this season.  At Madison Square Garden last night,  Steve Novak  had 20
points and  Raymond Felton  added 15 points for the Knicks, who
had a 55-38 halftime lead.  Alex Burks scored 14 points and Gordon Hayward contributed
13 for the Jazz (32-31), who have lost four straight games.  Utah is third in the Western Conference’s five-team
Northwest Division, 14 1/2 games behind the Oklahoma City
Thunder (46-16).  To contact the reporter on this story:
