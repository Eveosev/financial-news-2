Forward Amar’e Stoudemire will miss
as much as six weeks after undergoing knee surgery next week,
said the  New York Knicks , who also are playing without leading
scorer  Carmelo Anthony .  Stoudemire, 30, is having “a right knee debridement,” the
Knicks said before tonight’s game against the  Utah Jazz  at
Madison Square Garden in New York.  “He’s been very efficient with how he’s been playing,”
coach  Mike Woodson  told reporters. “I feel for Amar’e. He put a
lot of work in this summer to get back on the court. Now he’s
got to go back in again. I feel for him as a young man because
he’s put in so much hard work. But we have to go on.”  Stoudemire underwent the same procedure to remove dead or
damaged tissue or bone from his left knee before the start of
the season, which kept him on the bench until Jan. 1. Since
returning, he has been limited by the medical staff to 30
minutes, a time limit he exceeded twice this week.  Stoudemire, who averaged 14.2 points and five rebounds in
29 games as a reserve, isn’t expected to return until after
April 17, the last day of the regular season.  Anthony, 28, collapsed on the court with a knee injury
during the Knicks’ game against  Cleveland  on March 4 and hasn’t
returned to the team. He was averaging 28.2 points and 6.2
rebounds this season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
