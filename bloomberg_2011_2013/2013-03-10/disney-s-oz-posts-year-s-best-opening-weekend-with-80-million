Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s “Oz the Great and Powerful,” a prequel to the 1939 classic “The Wizard of Oz,” delivered the best opening weekend of 2013 at U.S. and Canadian theaters, taking in $79.1 million.  Sales were almost triple that of last week’s No. 1 picture, “Jack the Giant Slayer.” It dropped to second place this past weekend with $9.8 million for  Time Warner Inc (TWX) .’s New Line Cinema, researcher  Hollywood.com Box-Office  said today in an e-mailed statement.  Inspired by the L. Frank Baum novels, “Oz the Great and Powerful” posted the third-highest March opening, behind “The Hunger Games” ($152.5 million) and “Alice in Wonderland” ($116.1 million). It also topped this year’s previous best debut,  $34.6 million  in sales by  Universal Pictures ’ “Identity Thief,” Hollywood.com said.  “‘Oz’ is perhaps one of the most identifiable brand names in the universe and has a built-in” fan base,  Paul Dergarabedian , president of Hollywood.com’s box-office unit, said in an e-mail. “Jack” is aimed at teens and 20-something males, who “have seemingly checked out of going to the movies thus far this year,” he said.  “Jack,” a $200 million film, had opening weekend sales of $27.2 million.  “Oz” stars  James Franco  as Oscar Diggs, a circus con artist who gets caught in a tornado and carried to the magical land of Munchkins. He finds redemption while matching wits with a wicked witch.  Mila Kunis ,  Rachel Weisz  and  Michelle Williams  also are featured in the film.  Past Flops  The new “Oz,” directed by Sam Raimi and made for about $225 million, was expected to generate sales of $75 million, the estimate of  Boxoffice.com .  The character of Diggs fills the title role in “The Wizard of Oz,” the classic film starring  Judy Garland . Studios have tried unsuccessfully to capitalize on the magic of that film before. In 1985, Disney released “Return to Oz” with domestic box office sales of $11.1 million, according to IMDB.com. That was less than half the $25 million production budget. Universal Pictures produced “The Wiz” with  Michael Jackson  and Diana Ross in 1978. The $24 million movie took in $13 million from U.S. theaters.  ‘Huge Competition’  “Jack the Giant Slayer” is 3-D re-imagination of the children’s fairy tale that goes beyond the simple story of Jack’s one-time trip up the beanstalk. In the film, directed by Bryan Singer, Jack rekindles an ancient war between humans and a race of bloodthirsty giants. Nicholas Hoult, who played the character Beast in “X-Men: First Class,” portrays Jack.  The film has taken in $43.6 million since it was released on March 1. Ticket sales per theater dropped 64 percent from last week, the data show.  “It was a disappointing opening weekend and it’s continued here in the second week,” said  Paul Sweeney , an analyst with Bloomberg Industries. “They had huge competition from ‘Oz.’”  Still, the movie may do well overseas, Sweeney said in a telephone interview. Hollywood studios are reworking classic tales that they can sell to international audiences, he said.  “Studio chiefs are recognizing that in order for a movie to be successful overseas, it has to be a character or a series or a story that’s well known globally or can travel globally,” Sweeney said.  Revenue Rises  “Identity Thief” had sales of $6.3 million for third place. The movie stars  Jason Bateman  as Sandy Bigelow Patterson, a man whose gender-neutral name enables a woman to assume his identity and wreck his credit. The film from  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s Universal Pictures co-stars Melissa McCarthy as Bateman’s nemesis. Amanda Peet plays Sandy’s wife.  The weekend’s only other new film,  FilmDistrict ’s “Dead Man Down,” took in $5.3 million for fourth place. The mob thriller stars  Colin Farrell  as a low-level thug out for revenge against a crime boss played by Terrence Howard. Noomi Rapace plays a young woman who has her own reasons for wanting to bring down Howard’s character. The film was expected to have sales of $5 million, according to  Boxoffice.com .  Finishing fifth was “Snitch” from  Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. (LGF)  The film, which stars  Dwayne Johnson , had $5.1 million in receipts.  Weekend revenue for the top 12 films rose 8.7 percent to $128.3 million from the year-earlier weekend, Hollywood.com said. Sales this year are down 12 percent to $1.72 billion. Attendance is down 13 percent.  The amounts below are based on actual ticket sales for March 8 to March 10.
