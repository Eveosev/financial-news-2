Australia ’s dollar fell toward a
two-month low after a private report showed  China ’s
manufacturing expanded at a slower pace, damping prospects for
the South Pacific nation’s commodity exports.  The Aussie dropped yesterday by the most in three months
after minutes the  Federal Reserve ’s latest meeting signaled that
$85 billion of monthly bond purchases could be reduced in the
coming months. The  International Monetary Fund  said Australia’s
currency “looks overvalued by around 10 percent.” New
Zealand’s kiwi dollar slid along with Asian stocks.  “A shift in China away from investment-intensive and
commodity-hungry growth toward more consumption-oriented growth
will be negative for the Aussie dollar,” said David Forrester,
a senior vice president for Group of 10 foreign-exchange
strategy at Macquarie Bank Ltd. in  Singapore . Today’s
manufacturing report “shows that China’s economic recovery
remains sideways.”  The Aussie dropped 0.4 percent to 92.99 U.S. cents as of
5:08 p.m. in Sydney after slumping 1.1 percent yesterday, the
most since Aug. 21. It touched 92.69 on Nov. 12, the weakest
since Sept. 16. The kiwi fell 0.3 percent to 82.49 U.S. cents
following a 1.2 percent tumble, the biggest since Oct. 23.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of shares slid 0.6 percent,
declining for a third day.  HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics said today their
preliminary  Purchasing Managers ’ Index for Chinese manufacturing
was 50.4 in November. That trailed the 50.8 median estimate
among economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News , while remaining
above the 50 threshold that indicates expansion.  Aussie Bonds  Australia’s bonds fell for a fifth day following a decline
in Treasuries on concern the Fed will start to taper stimulus
that’s propped up asset prices worldwide.  The  yield  on the South Pacific nation’s 10-year government
note added seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 4.34
percent, the highest since March 2012. The U.S. yield touched
2.81 percent, a level unseen since Sept. 18.  Fed policy makers “generally expected” that improvement
in U.S. employment data would “warrant trimming the pace of
purchases in coming months,” according to the record of the
 Federal Open Market Committee ’s Oct. 29-30 gathering, released
yesterday in  Washington .  The 120-day correlation between the Aussie and the
benchmark U.S. 10-year yield was minus 0.36. It fell to minus
0.38 last month, the lowest since December 2006, from as high as
0.68 in November 2011.  “At this stage, tapering is the dominant driver instead of
global growth,” said David de Ferranti, a Sydney-based market
analyst at FXCM Inc. “It’s possible that U.S. dollar demand
will outweigh demand for the Australian dollar as a risk
currency” toward the end of March, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
