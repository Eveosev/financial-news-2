Ethanol futures jumped above $2 to
an 11-week high on speculation that rail congestion is
exacerbating a U.S. supply imbalance.  Prices gained 5.5 percent a day after the Energy
Information Administration said  inventories  fell 0.5 percent to
15.1 million barrels last week, the lowest level since Oct. 25.
Ethanol is mostly shipped by rail, where traffic has climbed 2
percent this year, data from Bloomberg Industries show.  “Some of this is a logistics issue,” said Jerrod Kitt, an
analyst at Linn Group in Chicago. “Rail car availability is
tight in the Midwest.”  Denatured ethanol for December delivery rose 10.7 cents to
$2.047 a gallon, the highest settlement since Sept. 5. The
futures have increased 15 percent this month.  Gasoline for December delivery increased 8.08 cents, or 3
percent, to $2.7438 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol’s discount to gasoline narrowed 2.62 cents to 69.68
cents a gallon.  “There a bunch of little things that by themselves
wouldn’t have much of an effect, but together” are raising
prices for ethanol, Kitt said.  Besides lower supplies of the additive, U.S. producers
haven’t had to compete with imports, Kitt said. Also, there’s
export interest and  gasoline demand  is higher than a year ago,
he said.  International Trade  The U.S. hasn’t made any  foreign purchases  of ethanol since
Sept. 27, the longest streak since 2011, data from the EIA, the
Energy Department’s statistical arm, show.  Ethanol is made from corn in the U.S., with one bushel
making at least 2.75 gallons of the fuel.  Corn for December delivery advanced 6 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $4.23 a bushel in  Chicago . One bushel makes at least
2.75 gallons of ethanol.  The corn crush spread, or the price difference between the
cost of a bushel of corn and the price of ethanol, was 51 cents,
up from 42 cents yesterday and compared with minus 33 cents on
Jan. 3, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “Margins have officially broken bad,” Kitt said.
“They’re going nuts. Most people are comparing this to 2011,
which is considered” a record year for profitability.  Ethanol  production  fell 2.5 percent to 904,000 barrels a
day in the week ended Nov. 15, EIA data show.  Cash Markets  Supply tightness is most pronounced in the cash market,
Kitt said.  In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago surged 30 cents
to $2.675 a gallon; on the West Coast prices gained 29.5 cents
to $2.75; in the U.S. Gulf the additive increased 26.5 cents to
$2.735; and in  New York  the biofuel jumped 25 cents to $2.70 a
gallon, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Prices on the West Coast were at a premium to the Gulf of
1.5 cents, after trading at a discount of 1.5 cents yesterday.
Chicago traded 2.5 cents below New York Harbor, compared with
7.5 cents a day earlier.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency enforces the
nation’s biofuel consumption mandate. Tracking certificates
called Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs, are attached
to each gallon of the fuel and are traded among refiners and
submitted to EPA.  Corn-based ethanol RINs rose 0.5 cent to 19.5 cents, while
advanced RINs, which cover biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol, added 2 cents to 22 cents, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
