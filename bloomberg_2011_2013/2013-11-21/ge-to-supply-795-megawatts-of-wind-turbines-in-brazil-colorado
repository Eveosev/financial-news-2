General Electric Co. (GE) , the largest
U.S. producer of wind turbines, agreed to supply 795 megawatts
of systems for projects in Brazil and  Colorado . Terms weren’t
provided.  GE won contracts for 545 megawatts in Brazil, about 63
percent of the capacity awarded in a government-organized
auction, the Fairfield, Connecticut-based company said in a
statement today. The 1.7- and 1.85-megawatt turbines will be
used in 26 wind farms by seven developers, and the orders
include 10-year service agreements.  The sales resulting from the Nov. 18 auction add to deals
GE completed after a similar event in August, totaling about 1
gigawatt of turbine orders.  The company also agreed to supply 250 megawatts to the
Golden West wind farm in El Paso County, Colorado, which will
use 147 of its 1.7-megawatt turbines, it said in a separate
statement today. GE will maintain the systems under a five-year
agreement.  Xcel Energy Inc. (XEL) ’s Public Service Co. of Colorado will buy
the wind farm’s electricity, enough for about 77,500 homes,
under a 25-year contract. The state is required to generate 30
percent of its energy from renewable sources by 2020.  To contact the reporter on this story:
