The British Army pushed Prime
Minister  Tony Blair  to include more ground troops in the 2003
invasion of  Iraq  against the advice of his officials, according
to a study of the relationship between politicians and the
military.  Blair had been presented with three options for military
involvement, from “Package 1,” which involved giving the U.S.
access to British bases, intelligence support and the use of
some special forces, through “Package 2”, which included the
Royal Navy and Royal Air Force, to “Package 3”, which
envisioned a ground invasion.  According to a report published today by the Royal
Institute of International Affairs in London, known as  Chatham
House , the government went for the broadest option “because
politicians feared they would have problems with the British
Army if it was left out, and that these problems would find
their way into the media.”  The report’s author, James de Waal, said the U.K. needed to
introduce standard structures for military decision-making,
along U.S. lines, with agreed rules for accountability to
Parliament.  To contact the reporter on this story:
