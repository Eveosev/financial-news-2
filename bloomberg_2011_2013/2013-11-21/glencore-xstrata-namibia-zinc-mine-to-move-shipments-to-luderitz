Glencore Xstrata Plc (GLEN) , the biggest
publicly traded commodities supplier, will export concentrates
from its Rosh Pinah zinc and lead mine from a Namibian port
closer to the operation starting next week, an official said.  The company will ship the metal that’s used to galvanize
steel, a process that protects it from corrosion, from the
southern port of Luderitz, about 290 kilometers (180 miles)
northwest of the operation, rather than from the Walvis Bay
port, which is about 812 kilometers away from the mine, said a
company official who asked not to be named because an
announcement hasn’t been made.  A spokesman for Glencore Xstrata declined to immediately
comment.  While the company has started transporting material by road
to Luderitz, nothing has yet left the port, the official said.
The new shipping route will officially start on Nov. 27, the
person said. Until now, concentrates have been moved by rail to
Walvis Bay.  Rosh Pinah is an underground mine 800 kilometers south of
 Namibia ’s capital, Windhoek. It can produce 70,000 metric tons
of zinc and 28,000 tons of lead annually. Glencore International
Plc bought a majority stake in Rosh Pinah in 2011, including
 Exxaro Resources Ltd. (EXX) ’s share in the company. Glencore on May 2
took over Xstrata Plc, creating the world’s fourth-biggest
mining company.  Rosh Pinah started exporting concentrates via Walvis Bay in
2011, after Exxaro closed its Zincor zinc refinery in
neighboring  South Africa .  To contact the reporter on this story:
