grams according to the Trade Agriculture and Craft Chamber in Asti, 
 Italy :        NOTE: Prices refers to the white truffle of Piedmont or the "tuber

searcher. Trade gains are computed as the difference between the
consumer and wholesale prices.  The Asti truffle market opens each Wednesday morning during the
truffle searching season. After the market closes, the chairman

truffle season.  Week on week percent changes are calculated by Bloomberg News 
between weeks with available price quotations, also when these
