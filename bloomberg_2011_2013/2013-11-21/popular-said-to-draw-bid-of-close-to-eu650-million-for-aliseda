Spanish lender  Banco Popular Espanol
SA (POP)  drew a bid of close to 650 million euros ($874 million) for
its real estate platform known as Aliseda, a person with
knowledge of the process said.  Five firms have bid for Aliseda, said the person, who asked
not to be identified because the information isn’t public. They
are Cerberus Capital Management LP, Kennedy-Wilson Holdings
Inc.,  Lone Star Funds , Centerbridge Capital Partners LLC and
Fortress Investment Group LLC, the person said.  John Dillard , a spokesman for Cerberus in New York,
declined to comment, as did a spokesman for Popular. Officials
for the other four firms weren’t immediately available for
comment.  Popular hired KPMG in September to seek buyers for Aliseda.  Reuters reported earlier today, citing people familiar with
the matter, that Popular had received preliminary offers for
Aliseda ranging from 450 million euros to 600 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
