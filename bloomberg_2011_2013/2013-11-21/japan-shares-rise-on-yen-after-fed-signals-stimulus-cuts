Japan ’s  Topix index  rose, after
falling the past two days, as the yen extended declines and
investors weighed recommendations that the country’s $1.21
trillion pension fund invest more in risk assets.  Honda Motor Co., which gets more than 80 percent of revenue
abroad, jumped 3.4 percent as the yen slipped against the
dollar. Minebea Co. gained 5.7 percent after Barclays Plc  raised 
its rating on the ball-bearings maker.  Mitsubishi Estate (8802)  Co.
paced a decline by  property  stocks as JPMorgan Chase & Co. cut
its outlook on Japan’s biggest developer by market value.  The Topix climbed 1 percent to 1,246.31 at the close in
 Tokyo , after losing 0.7 percent over the last two days. The
Nikkei 225 Stock Average increased 1.9 percent today to
15,365.60. A panel yesterday urged Japan’s government pension
fund to diversify away from domestic bonds, while the  Federal
Reserve  indicated stimulus may be cut in coming months. The  Bank
of Japan  kept monetary policy unchanged today.  “Reviewing GPIF’s asset mix is likely to take some time,
but some investors are hopeful they’ll increase investments in
risk assets sooner than expected,” said Takashi Aoki, who helps
oversee the equivalent of $37.6 billion in Tokyo at Mizuho Asset
Management Co. “While U.S. and European shares have been
surging in recent months, Japan’s performance has been
lackluster, so we’re now seeing a catch-up rally.”  Relative Performance  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  gained 5.9 percent from the
start of October through yesterday, hitting a record high on
Nov. 15. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index climbed 4 percent in the
period, closing at its highest level since May 2008 on Nov. 18.
The Topix’s advanced 3.3 percent in that span, and after today’s
gain remains 2.3 percent short of its highest close this year on
May 22.  Futures on the S&P 500 slipped 0.1 percent. The gauge slid
0.4 percent yesterday. Fed policy makers expected that economic
data will show ongoing improvement in the labor market and
“thus warrant trimming the pace of purchases in coming
months,” according to the record of the  Federal Open Market
Committee ’s Oct. 29-30 gathering.  The yen slid 0.7 percent to 100.75 per dollar today, its
lowest level since July 19. Japan’s currency retreated against
all its 16 major peers.  Honda, which counts  North America  as its biggest market,
gained 3.4 percent to 4,240 yen. Panasonic Co., which gets
nearly half its revenue outside Japan, added 2.3 percent to
1,070 yen.  Sony Corp. (6758) , which generates almost 70 percent of
sales abroad, gained 1.4 percent to 1,894 yen.  Inflation Goal  The central bank today stuck with a pledge to expand the
monetary base by 60-70 trillion yen ($600-$700 billion) a year.
The BOJ will need to extend the timeframe for achieving a 2
percent inflation target as it refrains from enlarging its
asset-purchase program, economists forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey. Twenty-two of 37 analysts see Governor Haruhiko Kuroda’s
board altering the objective adopted in April. JPMorgan Chase
says the change may come in April or July next year, pushing
back the timeframe to the fiscal year starting April 2016.  Japan’s Government Pension Investment Fund needs more
independence from bureaucrats and should put some of the world’s
biggest retirement savings pool into private equity and
commodities, an expert panel said yesterday.  The fund should also look at increasing holdings of
overseas assets and diversifying into real-estate investment
trusts, where returns may be higher than on local sovereign
bonds, and it should consider investing in infrastructure and
inflation-linked Japanese government debt, the panel said.  KDDI, Minebea  Among other shares that gained, KDDI Corp. jumped 6.3
percent to 6,430 yen, the most on the  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  and its highest
close in more than 13 years. The mobile-phone company has jumped
more than 25 percent since reporting earnings on Oct. 28.  Minebea advanced 5.7 percent to 710 yen for the  second-biggest  gain on the Nikkei 225. Barclays raised its rating on
the stock to overweight from equalweight, while boosting its
price target to 830 yen from 540 yen.  Mixi Inc., an social-networking site operator, surged 22
percent to 1,640 yen, the most since listing in 2006. The
company’s “Monster Strike” game moved up the Apple Inc. iTunes
app rankings today to become the 25th most popular free game,
compared to an average ranking of 46th this month, according to
the AppDB website.  Just three groups  fell  among the 33  Topix (TPX)  industry sectors
today, airlines, developers and utilities.  Mitsubishi Estate sank 0.5 percent to 2,837 yen. JPMorgan
cut its rating on the stock to neutral from overweight, while
Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co. also reduced its
outlook for the developer to neutral from outperform.  Tepco Slides  Japan Airlines Co. slipped 1.5 percent to 5,300 yen for the
biggest loss in its sector. Tokyo Electric Power Co. led
declines among utilities, slipping 1.7 percent to 537 yen. The
company detected smoke at the security office of its
Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear plant today, it said in a statement.
No radiation leaked to outside the facility, it said.  Mitsui Chemicals Inc. slumped 2.4 percent to 241 yen to
lead declines on the Nikkei 225. Iwai Cosmo Securities Co. cut
its rating on the stock to neutral from neutral plus.  Shares on the Topix traded at 1.27 times  book value  today,
compared with 2.57 for the  S&P 500  and 1.80 for the Stoxx Europe
600 Index yesterday. The Japanese measure’s 30-day volatility
was 15.56 today, down from its five-year median of 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
