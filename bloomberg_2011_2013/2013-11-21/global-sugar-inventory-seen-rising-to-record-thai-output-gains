Global sugar inventories will rise
more than forecast to a record as consumption trails production
for the fourth straight year and output gains in  Thailand , the
second-biggest exporter, U.S government data showed.  Stockpiles will increase 0.5 percent to 43.379 million
metric tons in the marketing period ending in 2014 for most
countries from a year earlier, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture said today in a  report . That topped a May forecast
by 13 percent. Thailand’s output will climb to a record 10.9
million tons, up 9 percent from a year earlier and 3.8 percent
more than estimated in May.  Global production will drop 0.7 percent to 174.8 million
tons, partly on smaller crops in  India  and  Russia , the USDA
said. Consumption will increase 2.4 percent to 167.6 million
tons as lower prices spur demand and trade, the agency said.  This year, raw sugar on ICE Futures U.S. in New York has
dropped 10 percent. The price headed for the third straight
annual decline, the longest slump in 21 years.  The USDA forecast for output in  Brazil , the top producer
and exporter, was cut 4.1 percent to 38.8 million tons. The
nation’s marketing year runs from May to April.  The estimate for shipments from India, the second-largest
producer, more than tripled to 2 million tons amid large
stockpiles and demand in  Africa .  India’s marketing year runs from October to September. The
USDA global estimates cover at least 10 different periods.  To contact the reporter on this story:
