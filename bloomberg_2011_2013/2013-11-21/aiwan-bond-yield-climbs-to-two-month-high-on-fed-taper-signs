Taiwan ’s 10-year bonds fell, pushing
the yield to a two-month high, after minutes of a Federal
Reserve meeting indicated it may cut bond purchases in the
“coming months” as the world’s largest economy improves.  U.S. Treasury yields rose after the record of the Oct.
29-30 Federal Open Market Committee meeting showed policy makers
expect economic data to be consistent with its outlook for
improvement in labor-market conditions, which would warrant
trimming stimulus. U.S. jobs growth topped forecasts last month,
a signal economic recovery is gathering pace. Taiwan’s gross
domestic product expanded at the slowest pace in a year in the
third quarter while exports fell in the last two months.  “U.S. Treasury yields jumped last night and demand for
longer-dated bonds has been weak,” said  James Wang , a bond
trader at Yuanta Securities Co. in Taipei. “But the prospect of
tapering was already expected in Taiwan, and the domestic
economy is sluggish, so yields increased surprisingly little.”  The yield on the 1.75 percent notes due September 2023
climbed two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 1.74
percent in when-issued trading as of 10:19 a.m. in Taipei,
according to Gretai Securities Market. That’s the highest  rate 
for 10-year sovereign debt since Sept. 14. The bonds will be
sold at a Nov. 29 auction.  Currency Market   Taiwan’s dollar was little changed at NT$29.563 against the
greenback, prices from Taipei Forex Inc. show, after slipping
0.2 percent in the last 12 minutes of trading yesterday amid
suspected central bank intervention. The monetary authority has
sold the currency in the run-up to the close on most days since
March 2012, according to traders who asked not to be identified.  Taiwan’s central bank yesterday reported a $14.9 billion
current-account surplus in the third quarter, compared with a
revised $14 billion in the previous three months. Export orders
rose 3.2 percent in October, data showed yesterday, beating the
median estimate of 0.8 percent in a Bloomberg survey.  One-month non-deliverable forwards on Taiwan’s currency
dropped 0.2 percent to NT$29.512 per dollar, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts declined 0.2 percent
yesterday.  One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in
the  exchange rate  used to price options, fell three basis points
to 3.18 percent. The  overnight interbank lending rate  was little
changed at 0.388 percent from yesterday’s 0.386 percent, a
weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money Center
showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
