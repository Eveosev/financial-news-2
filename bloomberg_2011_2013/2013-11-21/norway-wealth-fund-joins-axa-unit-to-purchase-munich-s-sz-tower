The manager of  Norway ’s sovereign-wealth fund, the world’s largest, and a unit of Axa Real Estate
Investment Managers plan to buy Munich’s SZ Tower.  A Norges Bank Investment Management unit and Axa Real
Estate will “indirectly acquire joint control” of the 28-story
building, according to a  filing  to the European Union’s
executive arm yesterday. The property includes three lower
levels, an underground garage and a six-floor campus.  Prime Office REIT-AG agreed to sell the building for 164.1
million euros ($220 million), the Munich-based company said
today in a statement. Prime Office didn’t identify the buyers of
the building, which is currently the headquarters of publishing
company Sueddeutscher Verlag.  Norway’s $808 billion sovereign-wealth fund is seeking to
increase the proportion of its holdings in real estate to about
5 percent. It’s bought stakes in European warehouses, the Times
Square Tower in  New York  and the Meadowhall Centre in northern
 England  in just over a year. It formed a venture with Axa Real
Estate, an affiliate of  Europe ’s second-largest insurer, to
provide commercial-property debt last month.  Norges Bank spokesman Thomas Sevang confirmed the contents
of the EU filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
