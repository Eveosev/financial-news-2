Turkey ’s central bank said it will
hold three dollar auctions from the end of this month until the
end of January, a move seen as an attempt by Governor Erdem
Basci to extend the period of forward guidance to the market.  The central bank said it will implement so-called “extra
tightening days” on Nov. 28, Dec. 30 and Jan. 30, selling at
least $100 million and refraining from offering funding to the
market at the benchmark 4.5 percent rate. Until today, the bank
used to announce similar actions on a weekly basis.  “The central bank is sending the message that it will
continue additional tightening for a long time,” Ugur Kucuk, a
fixed-income strategist at Is Investment & Securities in
Istanbul said by phone today. “What the bank is trying to do is
to maintain tight policy until the inflation outlook is in line
with their targets.”  The decision comes a day after policy makers told
economists to start disregarding its benchmark one-week
repurchase rate of 4.5 percent. Instead, economists should view
the new benchmark measure as the market’s overnight repo rate
quoted at the Borsa Istanbul, which the bank aims to bring in
line with the overnight lending rate at 7.75 percent, according
to three attendees at the meeting in Ankara.  The central bank said Nov. 19 that inflation was likely to
stay above its target for “some time.” It kept all three main
interest rates unchanged and decided to stop monthly repurchase
auctions to strengthen its “cautious stance and reduce the
volatility of short-term money market rates.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
