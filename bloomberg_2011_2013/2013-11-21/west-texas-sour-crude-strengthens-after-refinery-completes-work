West  Texas  Sour crude strengthened
relative to the U.S. benchmark after a refinery that processes
the grade completed maintenance.  WTS, a high-sulfur crude from the Permian Basin priced in
Midland, Texas, strengthened by 85 cents to a discount of $4.75
a barrel below West Texas Intermediate in Cushing,  Oklahoma , at
1:54 p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Phillips 66 (PSX)  completed planned maintenance at its Borger
refinery in the Texas Panhandle, Dennis Nuss, a Houston-based
spokesman for the company, said in an e-mailed statement. The
146,000-barrel-a-day refinery processes primarily high-sulfur
crude from West Texas and other locations, according to the
companyâ€™s website.  WTI in Midland strengthened by 25 cents to a $3.50-a-barrel
discount to its counterpart in Cushing.  The Permian Basin, which stretches over 75,000 square miles
in western Texas and southeast New Mexico, is the largest and
one of the oldest oil-producing basins in the U.S. Output has
jumped 49 percent since 2007 to about 1.3 million barrels a day,
according to data from the Energy Information Administration.  To contact the reporters on this story:
