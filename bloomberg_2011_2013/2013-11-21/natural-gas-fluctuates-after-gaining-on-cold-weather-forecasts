Natural gas futures advanced in  New
York  to the highest price in almost a month on speculation that
government data will show a larger-than-normal decrease in
inventories of the heating fuel.  Gas gained as much 1 percent. An Energy Information
Administration report scheduled for release at 10:30 a.m. in
 Washington  may show a stockpile drop of 38 billion cubic feet
last week, according to the median of 25 analyst  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg. The five-year average drop for the period
is 2 billion.  “The market is gearing up for the first storage withdrawal
of the season, and we have cold temperatures on top of that,”
said  Phil Flynn , a senior market analyst at Price Futures Group
in  Chicago . “There’s going to be increasing demand for natural
gas down the road.”  Natural gas for December delivery rose 2.8 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $3.702 per million British thermal units at 10:04
a.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  after advancing to
$3.712, the highest intraday price since Oct. 25. Trading volume
was 12 percent below the 100-day average. Prices have climbed 10
percent this year.  The discount of December to January futures narrowed 0.3
cent to 3.6 cents. March gas traded 1.5 cents  above  the April
contract, compared with 1.6 cents yesterday.  December $3.75 calls were the most active options in
electronic trading. They were 0.5 cent higher at 3.6 cents per
million Btu on volume of 199 at 10:13 a.m. Calls accounted for
63 percent of trading volume.  Stockpile Report  Gas inventories totaled 3.834 trillion cubic feet in the
week ended Nov. 8, EIA data show. Supplies were 1.5 percent
above the five-year average and 2 percent below year-earlier
stockpiles.  MDA Weather Services in Gaithersburg,  Maryland , predicted
colder-than-normal weather in the eastern two-thirds of the U.S.
through Dec. 5.  The low in New York on Nov. 27 may be 23 degrees Fahrenheit
(minus 5 Celsius), 15 less than average, according to
 AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College ,  Pennsylvania . The low in
Chicago may be 26 degrees, 3 lower than normal.  About 49 percent of U.S. households use gas for heating,
according to the EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical arm.  The U.S. may have 1.3 percent more heating-degree days, a
measure of weather-driven energy demand, from November to March
compared with the same period last year, Commodity Weather Group
LLC in Bethesda, Maryland, said in an Oct. 15 seasonal outlook.  To contact the reporter on this story:
