Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  apportioned December
shipments on five pipelines that ship crude oil from Alberta to
the U.S. Midwest and eastern  Canada  after space was overbooked.  Lines 2a and 3, which can transport a combined 832,000
barrels a day of light oil from  Edmonton  to Superior, Wisconsin,
were apportioned by 6 percent,  Graham White , a spokesman for the
Calgary-based company, said in an e-mailed statement.  Line 4, which can carry as many as 796,000 barrels a day of
both light and heavy crudes along the same route, was
apportioned by 10 percent, White said.  Line 14 from Superior to refineries near Chicago was
apportioned by 11 percent, and Line 6b from the Chicago area to
Sarnia, Ontario, by 45 percent, White said.  The lines are all part of the companyâ€™s  Mainline , the
largest crude-oil export system from Canada to the U.S., with as
much as 2.5 million barrels a day in capacity.  Apportionment occurs when shippers ask to transport more
oil than a line can hold and typically indicates excess demand
or lower capacity. A 45 percent apportionment means shippers
will only be able to deliver 55 percent of the volumes they
sought to transport.  To contact the reporter on this story:
