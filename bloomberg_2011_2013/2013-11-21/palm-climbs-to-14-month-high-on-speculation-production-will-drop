Palm oil advanced to the highest
level in more than a year on expectation that output may decline
this month in  Indonesia  and  Malaysia , the world’s top suppliers.  The contract for delivery in February gained 2.8 percent to
2,653 ringgit ($828) a metric ton on the Bursa Malaysia
Derivatives, the highest level at close for most-active futures
since Sept. 25, 2012. Prices entered a bull market this month
and have advanced 8.8 percent this year, set for the first
annual gain in three years.  Heavy rains may disrupt harvesting and reduce production in
Indonesia and Malaysia in November, according to the Indonesian
Palm Oil Association, which estimates yields in Indonesia to
decrease by 15 percent to 20 percent this year.  “Supply is very tight,” said Chandran Sinnasamy, head of
trading at LT International Futures Sdn. A weaker Malaysian
currency may further boost purchases from China and  India , the
top cooking oil consumers, he said.  The Malaysian ringgit fell by the most in almost two months
today and the Indonesian rupiah slid to the weakest level since
March 2009, making exports cheaper in dollars.  Palm oil shipments from Malaysia fell 2 percent to 1
million tons in the first 20 days of November, less than a 13
percent drop in the first 10 days of the month, data from
surveyor Intertek show. Exports from Indonesia surged 13 percent
to 1.86 million tons in October, the highest in eight months,
according to the nation’s palm oil association.  Biofuel Demand  Palm oil prices have rallied on biofuel demand, lower-than-expected output from Indonesia and Malaysia, and lower
inventories in both countries from a year earlier, Lee Oi Hian,
chief executive officer of Kuala Lumpur Kepong, said today.
Output is trailing expectations due to weather and biological
cycles of trees, Lee said.  Soybeans for January delivery rose 0.4 percent to $12.7925
a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybean oil gained 1
percent to 40.95 cents a pound.  Refined palm oil for May delivery gained 1.6 percent to end
at 6,370  yuan  ($1,046) a ton on the Dalian Commodity Exchange
and soybean oil climbed 1.2 percent to close at 7,272 yuan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
