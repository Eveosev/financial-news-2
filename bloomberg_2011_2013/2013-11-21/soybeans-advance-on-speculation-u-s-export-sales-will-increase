Soybeans climbed for the first time
in three days on expectations that demand would increase for
supplies from the U.S., the world’s second-biggest shipper, even
as global production heads for a record.  The contract for January delivery gained as much as 0.4
percent to $12.7825 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and
was at $12.7725 by 11:52 a.m. in  Singapore . Prices dropped to
$12.6825 on Nov. 19, the lowest since Nov. 8, and tumbled 9.4
percent this year.  Farmers worldwide will harvest a record 286.5 million
metric tons of soybeans, 5.2 million tons more than forecast a
month ago and 19.3 million tons bigger than last year’s crop,
researcher Oil World said Nov. 19. U.S. export sales were
probably 500,000 tons to 1 million tons in the week ended Nov.
14 from 441,031 tons a year earlier, according to a Bloomberg
survey. The U.S. Department of agriculture will release its
sales report today.  “There’s decent demand on one hand and very large supplies
on the other,”  Luke Mathews , a commodity strategist at
 Commonwealth Bank of Australia , said by phone from Sydney today.  Corn for March delivery fell 0.2 percent to $4.245 a
bushel. Wheat was little changed at $6.56 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
