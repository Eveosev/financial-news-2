Germany ’s top court won’t rule on
lawsuits challenging the  European Central Bank ’s plan to buy
bonds of crisis-torn countries before the end of the year.  Several suits are targeting the central bank’s Outright
Monetary Transactions program, arguing it oversteps the ECB’s
mandate to conduct monetary policy. No ruling will be made this
year, Bernd Odoerfer, a spokesman for the Federal Constitutional
Court in Karlsruhe, said in an e-mailed statement today.  The judges are “still aiming to complete the case as fast
as possible,” Odoerfer said. “We can’t yet disclose more
details.”  The cases were filed by political groups, professors and
lawmakers who argue that the program and the European Stability
Mechanism violate European laws and the constitutional principle
of democracy.  The cases are BVerfG, 2 BvR 1390/12 et al.  To contact the reporter on this story:
