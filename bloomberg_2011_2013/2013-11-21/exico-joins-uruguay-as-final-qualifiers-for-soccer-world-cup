Mexico and  Uruguay  became the last
two teams to qualify for next year’s soccer World Cup in Brazil.  Mexico beat  New Zealand  4-2 in Wellington yesterday and
Uruguay drew 0-0 with Jordan in Montevideo to win the two-match
playoff series. They join 30 other squads in the Dec. 6 draw.  Mexico beat New Zealand 5-1 in their opening match last
week, while Uruguay routed Jordan 5-0. Last night, Oribe
Peralta’s first-half hat trick put the visitors in control
before New Zealand got back into the match with a Chris James
penalty in the 80th minute and then Rory Fallon scored three
minutes later.  Carlos Pena  finished the scoring in the 87th
minute for Mexico.  Uruguay was unable to crack Jordan in Montevideo’s
Centenario Stadium with the match ending 0-0.  The World Cup starts June 12 in Brazil, and runs through
July 13.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
