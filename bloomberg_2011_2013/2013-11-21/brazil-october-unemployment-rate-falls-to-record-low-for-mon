Brazil ’s  unemployment  rate in
October fell to a record low for the month, as the labor market
remains strong in the face of lackluster growth. Swap rates
rose.  The jobless rate fell to 5.2 percent from 5.4 percent in
September, the national statistics agency said in Rio de Janeiro
today. That was less than  forecast  by 32 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg, whose median estimate was 5.3 percent.  President Dilma Rousseff, who faces an election next year,
has highlighted low unemployment as an achievement of her
administration. While  job creation  slowed this year, joblessness
in the world’s second-largest emerging market remained at near-record lows, stoking inflation that pressured the central bank
this year to undertake the largest rate-increase cycle in the
world.  Swap rates on the contract maturing in January 2015, the
most traded in Sao Paulo today, rose eight basis points, or 0.08
percentage point, to 10.85 percent at 9:07 a.m. local time. The
real weakened 0.9 percent to 2.2933 per U.S. dollar.  “We constructed our stability -- controlled inflation, a
fiscal surplus and high reserves -- while increasing income and
employment,” Rousseff said on Twitter on Nov. 18.  Brazil created 1 million government-registered jobs in the
first nine months of 2013. That’s down from 1.3 million and 1.8
million in the same period of 2012 and 2011, respectively.
Average real income in the first nine months of 2013 was 1,880
reais ($819) per month, up from 1,851 reais and 1,780 reais in
2012 and 2011.  Brazil’s inflation rate in the month through mid-November
accelerated to 5.78 percent, above the 4.5 percent midpoint of
the central bank’s target range. To tame inflation, the central
bank has increased the benchmark  Selic (BZSTSETA)  rate by 225 basis points
since April to 9.5 percent.  Economists in the latest weekly central bank survey
forecast gross domestic product growth of 2.5 percent this year
and 2.1 percent next, after expansion of 0.9 percent in 2012.  The labor force was unchanged in October from the month
before at 24.5 million. The number of unemployed fell 4.4
percent to 1.27 million, the statistics agency said. The agency
surveys the job market in six of Brazil’s metropolitan areas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
