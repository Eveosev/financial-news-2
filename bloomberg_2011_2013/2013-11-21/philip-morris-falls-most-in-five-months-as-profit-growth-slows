Philip Morris  International Inc.
extended its decline into a second day, falling the most in five
months after a crimped profit outlook prompted Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. to cut its rating on the shares to neutral.  The stock fell 3 percent to $86.60 at the close in  New York 
for the steepest drop since June 20. Yesterday, the world’s
largest publicly traded tobacco company had forecast falling
volume in Europe and  Russia .  In Russia, where President  Vladimir Putin  earlier this year
signed a package of anti-tobacco measures, Philip Morris said
cigarette volume may drop as much as 11 percent in 2014. The New
York-based maker of Marlboro cigarettes said it expects declines
on that basis of as much as 8 percent in the EU region.
International volume may fall 2 percent to 3 percent.  “We underestimated some of the challenges in Philip
Morris’s key markets,”  Judy Hong , a Goldman Sachs analyst,
wrote in a note to investors yesterday.  Hong, who previously rated the stock buy, lowered her 12-month price target for the stock to $95 from $103.  Per-share profit excluding currency swings will increase 6
percent to 8 percent in 2014, the company said yesterday in a
statement. Its long-term target is for 10 percent to 12 percent
growth, it said.  Philip Morris, which fell 2.4 percent yesterday, has
advanced 3.5 percent this year. That compares with a 26 percent
 gain  for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
