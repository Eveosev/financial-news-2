Ukraine halted preparations to sign
a trade accord with the European Union next week.  The government said today on its website that the decision
is aimed at “renewing lost production volumes, lost trade and
economic relations with  Russia  and other members of the
 Commonwealth of Independent States .”  The former Soviet republic will renew dialog with Russia
and the other members of Russia’s customs union to improve trade 
and economic ties, according to the  resolution .  European governments had been urging Ukraine to meet EU
demands so it can finalize an association and free-trade pact at
a Nov. 28-29 summit in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius. The
chance of signing the accord is less than 50 percent, Polish
Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said yesterday.  The yield on the government’s 2023 dollar bond jumped 20
basis points, or 0.2 percentage point, to 9.858 percent at 3:28
p.m. in Kiev, having been lower than yesterday earlier in the
session. The cost to insure Ukrainian debt against non-payment
for five years with credit-default swaps rose 13 basis point to
973 percent, according to data complied by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
