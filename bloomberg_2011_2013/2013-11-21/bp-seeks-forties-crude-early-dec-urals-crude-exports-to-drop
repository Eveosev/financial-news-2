BP Plc bid for  North Sea  Forties
crude at a higher price than yesterday. There were no bids and
offers for Russian Urals blend.  Russia  is scheduled to ship 12 cargoes of Urals crude, or
1.2 million metric tons, from Primorsk port in the  Baltic Sea 
from Nov. 30 to Dec. 10, a preliminary loading program obtained
by Bloomberg News shows. That’s down from 1.67 million tons in
the same period this month.  North Sea  BP sought to buy Forties crude without success at a premium
of 45 cents a barrel to Dated Brent for Dec. 9 to Dec. 15,
according to a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers
monitoring the Platts pricing window. That’s 10 cents more than
the company’s bid for the same loading dates yesterday.  Trafigura Beheer BV withdrew a bid to buy Forties at plus
65 cents. The grade last traded on Nov. 19 at a 10-cent premium.  The trader was also bidding for either Ekofisk for Dec. 5
to Dec. 15 at Dated Brent plus $1.30 a barrel, or Oseberg for
Dec. 11 to Dec. 17 at $1.25 premium. Total SA was looking to buy
either Oseberg or Ekofisk crude for Dec. 11 to Dec. 13 at a
premium of 90 cents, while BP sought the latter grade at plus
$1.10 for Dec. 13 to Dec. 15 loading.  BP failed to buy Oseberg for loading either Dec. 11 to Dec.
13 or Dec. 16 to Dec. 18 at Dated Brent plus $1.25. Mercuria
Energy Trading SA sought the same grade for Dec. 16 to Dec. 18
at $1.20 more than the benchmark.  Brent for January settlement traded at $109.06 a barrel on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of the window,
compared with $107.84 in the previous session. The February
contract was at $108.44, a discount of 62 cents to January.  Total chartered the suezmax Front Njord, able to haul as
much as 1 million barrels of crude, to load at Forties terminal
Hound Point in Scotland for  South Korea , according to fixture
lists from shipbrokers PF Bassoe AS and SSY Futures Ltd.  The tanker, which is scheduled to load Dec. 3 to Dec. 5,
was booked for $3.7 million. Total didn’t reply to a phone call
to its media office in Paris and an e-mail seeking comment.  Urals/Mediterranean  OAO Surgutneftegas is offering three Urals cargoes from the

to Dec. 9 from Primorsk, while the rest will be shipped Dec. 6
