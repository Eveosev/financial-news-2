Blackstone Group LP (BX) , the largest
manager of alternative assets such as buyouts, real estate and
 hedge funds , hired David Calhoun, the chief executive officer of
Nielsen Holdings NV, as head of private equity portfolio
operations.  Calhoun will lead a group of 21 professionals in a group
that works with company CEOs to improve valuations, New York-based Blackstone said today in a statement. He will report to
the global head of private equity, Joseph Baratta, and become a
member of the firm’s management and executive committees.  Calhoun joined Nielsen, the biggest tracker of U.S.
television ratings, in 2006 after it was bought by a group of
private-equity firms that included Blackstone. Nielsen this
month named Dwight M. Barns to succeed Calhoun on Jan. 1.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
