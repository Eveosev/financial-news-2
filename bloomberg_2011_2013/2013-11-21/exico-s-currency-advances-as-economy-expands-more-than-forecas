Mexico ’s peso rose for the first
time in three days as a government report showed that Latin
America’s second-largest economy expanded more than forecast in
the third quarter.  The peso strengthened 0.3 percent to 13.0588 per U.S.
dollar at 10:21 a.m. in Mexico City after falling as much as 0.4
percent. It has declined 0.9 percent in five days, the worst
performance after  Japan ’s yen among 16 major currencies.  Gross domestic product  expanded 1.3 percent in the third
quarter from a year earlier, the national statistics agency
reported today. The median estimate of 20 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was for growth of 1 percent.  “The GDP gave it a bit of a lift,”  Eduardo Suarez , a
Latin America strategist at Bank of Nova Scotia in Toronto, said
in an e-mailed response to questions.  The yield on peso bonds due in 2024 increased seven basis
points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 6.24 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The price fell 0.73 centavo to
129.91 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporters on this story:
