The euro rose to the highest in more
than four years versus the yen after a German report showed
Europe’s economic recovery may be gaining momentum, easing
speculation the central bank will cut interest rates further.  Australia ’s dollar fell against all of its 16 most-traded
peers amid speculation the nation’s central bank will take steps
to curb the currency’s strength. The yen reached a four-month
low versus the dollar after Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko
Kuroda said he will do his utmost to restrict an increase in
long-term yields. Futures traders increased their bets that the
yen will decline against the dollar to the most in six years.  “It looks like we’re going to see the euro zone return to
genuine growth in 2014,” said Andrew Wilkinson, chief economic
strategist at Miller Tabak & Co. in New York. “There seems to
be a finite magnitude in terms of how far the ECB can go to cut
rates. That’s no longer driving investors away from the euro.”  The euro gained 0.7 percent to 137.28 yen at 5 p.m. New
York time after touching 137.25, the highest level since October
2009. The shared currency rose 0.6 percent to $1.3558 and
advanced for a second week. The dollar added 0.1 percent to
101.27 yen after reaching 101.35 yen, the strongest since July
8.  The Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the currency
against 10 major counterparts, fell 0.2 percent to 1,018.56 to
pare its weekly gain to 0.2 percent.  Krona, Rand  Sweden ’s currency rose the most in two weeks versus the
euro as an index of Sweden’s  consumer confidence  in November
rose to 104.9 from 102 the previous month, the National
Institute of Economic Research said in statement today.
Manufacturing confidence increased to 105.8 from a revised 101.7
in October.  The krona gained 0.3 percent to 8.9225 per euro after
adding as much as 0.8 percent, the most since Nov. 7, and
appreciated 0.8 percent to 6.5792 per dollar.  The rand approached a three-week high after South Africa’s
central bank indicated it may raise borrowing costs as a weaker
currency fuels inflation.  Governor Gill Marcus “iterated time and again in the
statement about the continued risks to  inflation (JNCPIYOY)  along with a
downward revision in growth, so on balance it was certainly more
hawkish than we expected,” Mohammed Nalla, head of strategic
research at Nedbank Group Ltd. in Johannesburg, said by e-mail.  South Africa’s currency advanced 0.6 percent to 10.070 per
dollar, after declining 0.3 percent earlier, approaching the
highest since Nov. 1.  ‘Vulnerable’ Aussie  The Aussie fell for the third day against the dollar after
Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Glenn Stevens said in a
speech in Sydney yesterday that foreign-exchange intervention
can be effective as long as it’s “judiciously used in the right
circumstances.”  “The Aussie is looking very vulnerable,” said Ian Stannard, head of European foreign-exchange strategy at Morgan
Stanley in  London . “The RBA has once again focused in on the
currency, citing it as overvalued. There are domestic and
international reasons to be negative and we are looking for the
move to continue.”  The Aussie fell 0.6 percent to 91.83 U.S. cents after
touching 91.44, the weakest since Sept. 6. It lost 2 percent
since Nov. 15, a fifth weekly drop, matching the longest such
stretch since June.  The currency traded at NZ$1.1206 after touching NZ$1.1170,
the lowest versus the New Zealand dollar since October 2008.  Kuroda Comments  Japan’s currency weakened for a fourth week versus the
greenback, the longest slump since February, as Japanese bond
yields fell to the lowest in two months relative to their U.S.
counterparts.  Japan ’s central bank kept its pledge at a policy meeting
yesterday to expand the monetary base by as much as 70 trillion
yen ($691 billion) a year to help spur inflation.  The yen isn’t “excessively weak,” Bank of Japan Governor
Kuroda said in parliament today in  Tokyo . Inflation will hit the
BOJ’s 2 percent target in the latter half of the central bank’s
two-year time frame and policy makers will adjust its bond-buying program as needed, he said.  The  extra yield  that U.S. 10-year Treasuries offer over
similar-maturity Japanese bonds expanded to 2.19 percentage
points on Nov. 20, the widest level since Sept. 12 based on
closing prices. It was at 2.12 percent today.  The yen has tumbled 13 percent this year, the worst
performer among 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar strengthened
3.7 percent and the euro advanced 6.9 percent.  Yen Bears  Futures traders placed the biggest bet on a decline in the
yen against the dollar since July 2007, figures from the
Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading Commission show.  The difference in the number of wagers by hedge funds and
other large speculators on a decline in the yen compared with
those on a gain -- so-called  net shorts  -- was 112,216 on Nov.
19, compared with net shorts of 95,107 a week earlier.  The Ifo institute’s German business climate index, based on
a survey of 7,000 executives, increased to 109.3 from 107.4 in
October. That was the highest reading since April 2012.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast a gain to 107.7.  “I’m relatively positive on the euro,” said Simon Smith,
chief economist at FxPro Group Ltd. in London. “I don’t really
have the impression the actual backdrop is really that bad.
Underneath, it actually has a decent tone.”  The Bundesbank said this week that the German economy
remains on a “solid growth path.” Investor confidence rose to
the highest level in four years in November, unemployment
remained near a two-decade low in October and factory orders
climbed more than economists predicted in September.  The euro rose yesterday as ECB President Mario Draghi
damped speculation of negative deposit rates after the central
bank unexpectedly cut them to a record low  0.25 percent  on Nov.
