BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (BMRN)  may
draw bidders to the biggest biotechnology deal in three years
after its most promising rare-disease drug came one step closer
to U.S. regulatory approval this week.  An advisory committee to the  Food and Drug Administration 
said this week that BioMarin’s Vimizim drug should be approved
to treat the rare metabolic disease Morquio A syndrome. A
favorable FDA ruling by the end of February would remove some
risk for acquirers and may encourage them to pay a premium for
the  $9.8 billion company , Robert W. Baird & Co. said.  Vimizim, which would be BioMarin’s fifth orphan drug to hit
the market, is  projected  by analysts to be the company’s best-selling therapy by 2017. Large drugmakers such as  Pfizer (PFE)  Inc.
and GlaxoSmithKline Plc may covet BioMarin’s treatments that
target concentrated markets and sell for higher prices, said
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC. BioMarin could fetch at least $93 a
share, said William Blair & Co. At about $13 billion, it would
be the largest deal for a pharmaceutical or biotechnology
company since 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “It’s a good acquisition candidate given big pharma’s
interest in the orphan drug development space and given
BioMarin’s deep pipeline,” Kimberly Lee, a San Francisco-based
managing director and analyst at financial services firm Janney,
said in a phone interview. Approval of Vimizim would “increase
their attractiveness.”  FDA Approval  Debra Charlesworth, a spokeswoman for  San Rafael ,
California-based BioMarin, declined to comment when asked if the
company would be interested in a sale.  An advisory committee to the FDA voted on Nov. 19 to
recommend that Vimizim be approved for sale in the U.S. A
majority of the panel said it should be approved for all
patients with  Morquio A syndrome , a rare genetic disorder that
causes skeletal malformation. The FDA, which isn’t required to
follow the advisers’ recommendation, is scheduled to make its
decision on the drug by Feb. 28.  Today, BioMarin shares rose 2.4 percent to $70.82, after
increasing 3.3 percent yesterday on news of the advisory
committee’s vote.  Vimizim may generate $416 million in annual revenue by
2017, more than the projected sales for any of BioMarin’s drugs
already on the market, according to analysts’  estimates  compiled
by Bloomberg. The company  currently sells  enzyme replacement
therapies Naglazyme and Aldurazyme, Kuvan for metabolic genetic
disorder PKU and Firdapse for the autoimmune disease Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome.  Orphan Drugs  Large drugmakers “do want good products and growing
products, and with Vimizim now very likely to get to the market,
that’s another one of those in BioMarin’s portfolio,”  Phil Nadeau , a New York-based analyst at Cowen Group Inc., said in a
phone interview. “BioMarin is a good candidate and probably a
likely candidate at this point to be acquired.”  Orphan drugs such as those sold by BioMarin command premium
prices of as much as $400,000 a year per patient and target
diseases that affect as few as 5,000 to 10,000 people worldwide.
The market has attracted interest from larger pharmaceutical
companies seeking to boost earnings as mass-market pills lose
patent protection, with Shire Plc agreeing this month to buy
rare-disease drugmaker  ViroPharma Inc. (VPHM)  for about $4.2 billion.  BioMarin would likely command takeover bids of at least $93
a share, according to Tim Lugo, a San Francisco-based analyst at
William Blair. That would be a 35 percent premium to yesterday’s
closing price of $69.14.  Takeover Valuation  “There are only a limited number of companies that do rare
diseases well and BioMarin is at the top of the list,” Lugo
said in a phone interview.  At that price, the deal would cost at least $13 billion,
the most for a biotechnology or pharmaceutical deal since  Sanofi (SAN) 
agreed to buy orphan drugmaker Genzyme Corp. in 2010, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The cash bid was ultimately
raised to about $20 billion.  Given its position in the market for rare disease
treatments after acquiring Genzyme, Sanofi could be among large
pharmaceutical companies interested in buying BioMarin, Nadeau
of Cowen said.  Glaxo (GSK)  or Pfizer are also potential suitors, said
Lee of Janney.  Jack Cox, a spokesman for Paris-based Sanofi, and Joan Campion of New York-based Pfizer said the companies don’t
comment on speculation when asked about a potential takeover of
BioMarin. Representatives for London-based Glaxo didn’t respond
to a request for comment.  ‘Too Expensive’  DealReporter said in a Sept. 19 report that  Roche Holding
AG  was lining up $15 billion in debt financing for an
acquisition of BioMarin. Roche CEO Severin Schwan responded
later that day, saying the company wasn’t raising funds for a
deal.  “We are scratching our heads” at valuations in the
biotechnology industry, Schwan said in an interview at the time.
As of yesterday, the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index had gained 54
percent this year, while BioMarin rose  41 percent  to add $3.7
billion to its market value.  Other potential buyers may feel the same way, said Liana Moussatos of Wedbush Inc.  “I’m sure plenty of companies would love to be able to
buy” BioMarin, Moussatos, a San Francisco-based analyst, said
in a phone interview. “Except it’s too expensive.”  BioMarin  trades  at about 17 times its trailing 12-month
revenue of $534 million, compared with the price-sales multiple
of almost 5 times paid in the acquisition of Genzyme. In 2016,
BioMarin is projected to post its first  profit  in six years,
analysts’ estimates show.  With large pharmaceutical companies more willing to pay up
for biotechnology targets with proven products and fewer risks,
the advisory committee’s backing of Vimizim may help ease those
concerns, said Christopher Raymond of Baird.  BioMarin is “right in the wheelhouse of attractiveness in
terms of being in the rare disease space,” Raymond, a Chicago-based analyst, said in a phone interview. A takeover “is
absolutely a possibility.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
