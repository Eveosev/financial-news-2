Rubber swung betweens gains and
losses as a Chinese manufacturing gauge fell for the first time
in four months, raising concern demand may drop, while the
Japanese currency weakened, boosting contracts based in yen.  The contract for delivery in April on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange lost as much as 0.3 percent to 257.9 yen a kilogram
($2,575 a metric ton) and traded little changed at 258.5 yen at
11:24 a.m. Futures have lost 15 percent this year.  The preliminary 50.4 reading in November for a  Purchasing
Managers ’ Index released today by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics compared with a 50.8 median estimate from analysts
surveyed by  Bloomberg News . The final number for October was
50.9, and levels above 50 indicate expansion. China is the
world’s biggest consumer. Japan’s currency dropped to 100.52 per
dollar, the weakest level since Sept. 11.  “The Chinese data weighed on the market,” said Hideshi
Matsunaga, an analyst at broker ACE Koeki Co. in Tokyo. “Still,
there were no aggressive sellers as a weak yen continued to
support futures.”  Rubber for May delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
lost 0.5 percent to 19,260  yuan  ($3,160) a ton. Thai rubber
free-on-board added 0.3 percent to 78.60 baht ($2.48) a kilogram
yesterday, according to the Rubber Research Institute of
Thailand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
