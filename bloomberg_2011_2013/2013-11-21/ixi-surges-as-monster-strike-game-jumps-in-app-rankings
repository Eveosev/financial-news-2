Mixi Inc. (2121)  rose by its daily limit in
Tokyo trading as the company’s “Monster Strike” game moved up
the app ranking.  The Tokyo-based game maker rose 22 percent to 1,640 yen,
the most since its 2006 listing, adding to a 13 percent increase
yesterday. About  1.16 million  Mixi shares changed hands today,
compared with its 30-day average of 136,000 shares.  “Monster Strike” is ranked as the 25th most popular free
game on iTunes today, up from its average ranking of 46th place
this month, according to the AppDB  website . The game allows up
to four players to participate simultaneously.  “We expect business to be back in the black in the third
quarter of 2015,” Mizuho Financial Group Inc. analyst Shinsuke Iwasa said in a report yesterday. “If their new three pillars
of support take off, then we may see this happen earlier,” he
said, citing services including “Monster Strike.”  Mixi provided the second-biggest boost to the TSE Mothers
index of smaller companies today, which rose 0.5 percent. The
broader Topix index increased 1 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
