Gasoline futures rose as the largest
oil refinery in the U.S. carried out maintenance, threatening to
curtail supplies.  Motiva Enterprises LLC began work at its 600,000-barrel-a-day  Port Arthur ,  Texas , plant on Nov. 19, according to Destin Singleton, a company spokeswoman based in Houston. A drop in
output may further reduce stockpiles of gasoline, which fell to
a one-year low last week, government data show. The fuel’s
premium to West Texas Intermediate crude widened for the first
time in three days.  “This is what’s moving RBOB up this morning,” said  Jim Ritterbusch , president of Ritterbusch & Associates, a Galena,
Illinois-based consulting company. “When you see a big refinery
like that indicating some problems, you see values rise in
futures and crack spreads.”  Gasoline for December delivery gained 3.32 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $2.6962 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 10:14 a.m. Trading volume was 46 percent above the 100-day
average for the time of day. Futures are down 4.1 percent in
2013.  Gasoline’s  crack spread  versus West Texas Intermediate oil
widened 64 cents to $17.91 a barrel. The fuel’s  premium  to
European benchmark Brent oil gained 80 cents to $3.86.  Inventories of the motor fuel sank to 208.9 million barrels
in the week ended Nov. 15, the lowest level since Nov. 23, 2012,
Energy Information Administration data show.  Jobless Claims  Prices also climbed as  jobless claims  in the week ended
Nov. 16 dropped by 21,000 to 323,000, the fewest since the week
ended Sept. 29, the U.S. Labor Department said today in
 Washington . The median forecast of 47 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg called for a drop to 335,000.  “Jobless claims showed a reduction and also boosted the
market,” Ritterbusch said in a phone interview today.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel rose for a second day, adding 0.83
cent, or 0.3 percent, to $2.9628 a gallon. Volume was 79 percent
above the average.  ULSD’s  premium  over WTI narrowed 14 cents to $30.03 a
barrel. The crack  spread  versus Brent was unchanged at $15.96.  U.S. gasoline  pump prices , averaged nationwide, climbed 0.8
cent to $3.22 a gallon, the highest level since Nov. 6,
according to Heathrow, Florida-based AAA. Prices are 20.6 cents
below a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
