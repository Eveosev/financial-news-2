China ’s  sugar imports  jumped to a
record for a second month in October as domestic refining
capacity expanded amid changing diets in the world’s second-biggest consumer of the sweetener.  Imports were 709,873 metric tons in October, compared with
the previous record of 591,855 tons in September, according to a
statement from China’s customs today.  “The fast expansion of China’s sugar refining capacity has
fueled imports of raw sugar recently,” said Zhan Xiao, an
analyst at Xinhu Futures Co. in Dalian. “Higher prices in China
also stimulated imports.”  Refined sugar for May delivery on the Zhengzhou Commodity
Exchange closed at 5,036  yuan  a ton (37.58 cents a pound), while
raw sugar in New York was at 17.61 cents a pound at 4:27 p.m.
Beijing time.  China also imported a record 1.31 million tons of  wheat 
last month, according to customs. Suppliers made deliveries of
U.S. grain buyers had bought during the second quarter, said
Liang Ruian, vice president at  Shanghai  Jianfeng Asset
Management Co. in Shanghai.  Imports of  cotton  fell to 141,157 tons in October, the
lowest level since June 2011, according to customs. The local
 textile industry  struggled to compete with cheaper imports of
foreign yarn, said Dong Shuangwei, head of research at Henan
Tongzhou Cotton Trade Co. in Beijing.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
