Daniel Loeb, the activist investor
who runs hedge fund Third Point LLC, said his firm has taken a
stake in  SoftBank Corp. (9984)  valued at more than $1 billion.  Loeb disclosed the stake at the Robin Hood Foundation’s
investor conference in New York yesterday, according to a
spokesperson for the U.S. investment firm.  SoftBank shares climbed to their highest since 2000 in
Tokyo trading. Loeb, who earlier this year pushed for a spinoff
of a portion of Sony Corp.’s entertainment unit, invested in
SoftBank because of its long-term value and isn’t agitating for
asset sales, according to a person familiar with the matter.  SoftBank, which has been involved in more than 10  deals  in
the past year, wants to acquire makers of games, music and
videos as it tries to generate more revenue from smartphone
users. The Tokyo-based company founded by billionaire Masayoshi Son paid $21.6 billion for  Sprint Corp. (S)  in July before adding
agreements for majority stakes in game developer Supercell Oy
and U.S. mobile phone distributor Brightstar Corp. in October.  Elissa Doyle, a spokeswoman for Third Point, declined to
comment, as did Hiroe Kotera, a spokeswoman for SoftBank.  Shares Jump  Shares of SoftBank rose 2.3 percent yen to close at 8,150
yen in Tokyo trading, the highest since May 10, 2000. Based on
SoftBank’s market value of 9.8 trillion yen ($97 billion), Third
Point’s stake would equal about 1 percent, compared with the 6.5
percent it has said it holds in Sony. Sprint jumped 8.2 percent
to $7.95 in New York yesterday.  Loeb met Son and was impressed by the Japanese
billionaire’s leadership and prospects, the people said. Third
Point likes SoftBank’s organic growth potential and investments
in gamemaker  GungHo Online Entertainment Inc. (3765)  and Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., the people said.  Tokyo-based SoftBank owns about 37 percent of Alibaba.
 China ’s biggest e-commerce operator is worth as much as $190
billion, analysts at Sanford Bernstein said last month. That
potentially values SoftBank’s stake at $70 billion.  Loeb began pushing for changes at Sony in May.  After acquiring control of Sprint, the third-biggest U.S.
mobile-phone company, Son is seeking to apply the same formula
that has helped SoftBank gain market share in  Japan  -- luring
heavy users of wireless Internet service. Sprint is spending $16
billion during two years on improvements to its network speed
and reliability, planning to catch up with AT&T Inc. and Verizon
Wireless.  To contact the reporters on this story:
