WTGoodman, a joint venture between
 Goodman Group (GMG)  and WTorre SA, offered to buy 34 industrial
properties in Brazil from  BR Properties SA (BRPR3)  for A$1.49 billion
($1.38 billion).  BR Properties has given Sao Paulo-based WTGoodman a period
of exclusive due diligence, Goodman said in a statement filed
with the Australian stock exchange today. The Brazilian real
estate developer will use proceeds from the sale of the
industrial and logistics sheds to reduce debt, pay dividends and
buy back shares, it said in a separate filing yesterday.  Goodman, which managed A$24 billion of properties as of
Sept. 30, is expanding in the U.S.,  China  and Brazil in
partnership with local operators and global investors. It’s
growing as demand from tenants climbs for modern, well-located
logistics properties, and investors are drawn to the relatively-high yields from warehouses.  “The proposed transaction is consistent with Goodman’s
global investment and funds management strategy,” Goodman said
in the statement.  The group sought in November 2012 to raise A$400 million to
fund the joint venture with WTorre, which is focused on
developing prime logistics and industrial properties. Goodman
entered  Brazil  to capitalize on low vacancy rates, an
undersupply of prime logistics space and an expanding middle
class, the company said in its annual report on Sept. 27. The
first development of the joint venture, in Rio de Janeiro, is
expected to be completed this year, it said then.  To contact the reporter on this story:
