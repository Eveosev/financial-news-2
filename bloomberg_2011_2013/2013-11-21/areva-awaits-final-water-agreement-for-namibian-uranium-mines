Areva (AREVA)  SA’s Namibian unit is waiting
for a distribution agreement with Namibia Water Corp. to supply
desalinated water to uranium mines and businesses in the semi-arid Erongo region, Managing Director Hilifa Mbako says.  The Paris-based nuclear power company’s desalination plant
in Erongo, west of the capital, Windhoek, can pump 20 million
cubic meters a year, and is currently supplying China Guangdong
Nuclear Power Co.’s Husab uranium project with 166,000 cubic
meters of water a month, Mbako said in a phone interview today.  Areva and Namwater signed an interim supply agreement on
Aug. 15 and the company is waiting for a final deal before
turning on the taps, Mbako said.  “Areva and Namwater are currently at an advanced stage of
finalizing agreements for the supply of bulk desalinated water
to the uranium mines in the Erongo region,” he said. “We are
ready to start providing the water at an agreed price.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
