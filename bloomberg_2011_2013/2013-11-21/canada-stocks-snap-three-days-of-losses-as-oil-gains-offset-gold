Canadian  stocks  rose, snapping three
days of losses, as gains among oil producers overshadowed a
decline in  gold prices  amid speculation the  Federal Reserve  will
trim asset purchases in coming months.  Whitecap Resources (WCP)  Inc. and Crew Energy Inc. climbed at
least 3.5 percent as crude surged the most in seven weeks.
Detour Gold Corp. and Rio Alto Mining Ltd. lost more than 7.6
percent as the price of gold tumbled.  Gildan Activewear Inc. (GIL) 
retreated 3.3 percent after 2014 forecasts fell short of
analysts’ estimates.  Lightstream Resources Ltd. (LTS)  sank 7.9 percent
after announcing a dividend cut and reduced capital spending.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  climbed 45.32
points, or 0.3 percent, to 13,475.33 at 4 p.m. in Toronto. The
benchmark equity gauge has risen 8.4 percent this year, the
third-worst performer among the world’s developed markets, ahead
of  Hong Kong  and Singapore.  “Today is a bounce-back from the down days that we’ve
had,” said  John Kinsey , a  fund manager  with Caldwell Securities
Ltd., said from Toronto. The firm manages about C$1 billion
($952 million). “Yesterday was a knee-jerk reaction to the Fed
minutes. Energy seems to be pretty solid here.”  U.S. policy makers expect economic data will signal further
improvement in the labor market and “warrant trimming the
pace” of bond purchases in coming months, according to minutes
from the Fed’s October meeting released yesterday. Stocks have
rallied this year, bolstered by the Fed’s $85 billion in monthly
asset purchases.  Oil Jumps  Whitecap Resources rallied 5.5 percent to C$12.36 and Crew
Energy increased 3.5 percent to C$5.61 to pace gains among
energy stocks. Nine of 10  industries  advanced in the S&P/TSX on
trading volume 13 percent above the 30-day average at this time
of the day.  Crude for January delivery climbed 1.7 percent to $95.44 a
barrel in New York, after a report showed jobless claims in the
U.S. fell by 21,000 to 323,000 last week.  Bombardier Inc., the world’s third-largest plane maker,
advanced 0.4 percent to C$4.68 after the planemaker said it had
received firm orders and commitments for as many as 38 aircraft
worth up to $2.01 billion at the Dubai airshow.  Air Canada, the nation’s largest airline, climbed 4.5
percent to C$6.98, the highest since June 2008. The stock is the
top  performer  in Canada this year with a 299 percent advance.  Detour Gold (DGC)  declined 9 percent to C$4.44 and Rio Alto

analysts’ estimates for 41 cents.  Gildan also reported fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of 83
cents a share, trailing analysts’ projections of 84 cents.  Lightstream Resources, an oil exploration and production
company, tumbled 7.9 percent to C$5.57, a record low. The
company said it will reduce its 2014 capital spending program by
about 25 percent from estimated 2013 levels, and targeted more
than C$600 million in non-core asset sales by the end of 2015.  The company also cut its  dividend  50 percent to 4 Canadian
cents a month, for annual cash savings of C$40 million a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
