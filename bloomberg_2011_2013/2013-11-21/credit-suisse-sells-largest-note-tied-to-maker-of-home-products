Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  sold $25.4
million of one-year notes tied to  Masco Corp. (MAS) , the largest such
offering since at least January 2010.  The securities, issued Nov. 13, yield 8.5 percent a year
plus an additional 5.27 percent if the home improvement  company 
gains at least 8.5 percent, with protection against 5 percent of
declines before investors take losses, according to a prospectus
filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The
Swiss bank estimated the notes’ initial value at 97.4 cents on
the dollar, according to the prospectus.  Homeowners are spending more on home improvement projects
as housing prices improve, said Nicholas Coppola, an analyst at
Thompson Research Group in Nashville, Tenn. “People have more
confidence that if they make improvements in their houses,
they’re going to get a return.”  Thompson reiterated its 12-month  target price  of $29 for
the company on Nov. 12. Masco, the Taylor, Mich.-based maker of
items including cabinets, faucets and  hot tubs , rose 28 percent
this year to $21.32 yesterday.  Bloomberg started to collect comprehensive data on
structured notes in 2010.  Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts with
values derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
or events such as changes in  interest rates  or the weather.  To contact the reporter on this story:
