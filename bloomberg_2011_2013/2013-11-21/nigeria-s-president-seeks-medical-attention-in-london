Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan
has been advised by doctors in  London  to rest “for a few
days,” his spokesman Reuben Abati said.  Jonathan, 56, didn’t appear at today’s opening of an
investment meeting that he had traveled to London to attend,
Abati said in an e-mailed statement.  “President Jonathan’s condition is not serious,” Abati
said. The medical attention Jonathan sought is “only
precautionary,” he said, without providing further details.  Jonathan took over the presidency of Africa’s top oil
producer and most populous nation in 2010 when his predecessor,
Umaru Yar’Adua, died in office. He won an election in 2011, and
hasn’t said if he will stand in a vote scheduled for 2015.  His ruling People’s  Democratic Party , which has been in
power since military rule ended in  Nigeria  in 1999, will face
its toughest challenge yet. Four main opposition parties joined
forces this year to fight Jonathan, and the PDP has also been
hit by internal power struggles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
