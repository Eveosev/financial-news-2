Sprint Corp. (S)  fell to last from
second place among the major U.S. carriers in  Consumer Reports ’
new annual ranking of U.S. cellphone-service providers.  In 2012, Sprint was No. 2 among the four major carriers,
behind only  Verizon Wireless , according to the product-review
magazine. This year, consumers gave the Overland Park, Kansas-based carrier lower marks on everything from reliability of its
4G service to value, according to Consumer Reports National
Research Center’s survey of 58,399 subscribers. Verizon Wireless
was the top carrier, followed by  T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS) , AT&T Inc. and
Sprint.  Sprint, which SoftBank Corp. acquired this year, closed
down its outdated Nextel network on June 30, losing some
subscribers in the process. The company reported third-quarter
revenue of $8.68 billion in October, missing the average analyst
estimate compiled by Bloomberg. Sprint is now working to attract
new customers with an upgraded network and lower-cost calling
plans.  “People were down across the board on all aspects of
Sprint services,” said James McQueen, a spokesman for  Consumer
Reports .  To contact the reporter on this story:
