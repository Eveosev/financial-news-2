Asian  stocks  outside Japan fell for
a third day after minutes from the Federal Reserve’s last
meeting signaled bond purchases may be reduced in coming months
and a gauge of  China  manufacturing fell more than expected.  Perseus Mining Ltd. (PRU)  led gold producers lower, slumping 10
percent in Sydney after prices for metal fell amid concern
tapering stimulus will erode demand for haven assets.  Prince
Frog International Holdings Ltd. (1259) , a maker of baby-care products,
suspended after its accounting came under scrutiny by a short
seller and lost 22 percent in Hong Kong as it resumed trading.
Honda Motor Co., a Japanese carmaker that gets more than 80
percent of revenue abroad, rose 3.4 percent as the yen fell.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropped 0.7 percent to 141.17
at 7:38 p.m. in Hong Kong, with nine of the gauge’s 10 industry
groups falling. The MSCI Asia Pacific Excluding Japan Index
declined 1.3 percent, with Japan’s  Topix (TPX)  index gaining 1
percent.  “There’s a feeling around that the Fed is starting to see
the cost of ongoing quantitative easing mounting,” said Shane Oliver, Sydney-based head of investment strategy at AMP Capital
Investors Ltd., which oversees $135 billion. “The market is
still feeling very twitchy about it.”  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index lost 0.5 percent, while the
Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of mainland companies listed
in Hong Kong slid 0.9 percent. China’s Shanghai Composite Index
was little changed. A preliminary gauge of China’s factory
activity in November from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics
fell to 50.4 in November from 50.9 in October. Analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg had expected a reading of 50.8, with 50 the
dividing line between growth and contraction.  Inflation Goal  Japan ’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 1.9 percent as the
central bank kept monetary policy unchanged today. The Bank of
Japan will at some stage alter its target of 2 percent inflation
in two years as unprecedented bond-buying proves insufficient to
achieve the goal, economists forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey.  Japan’s 121 trillion yen ($1.2 trillion) pension fund needs
more independence from bureaucrats and should put some of the
world’s biggest retirement-savings pool into private equity and
commodities, an expert panel said. The Government Pension
Investment Fund should review domestic bond holdings and
consider investing more overseas, according to a report released
by the advisory group yesterday.  South Korea’s Kospi index lost 1.2 percent.  Australia ’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index fell 0.4 percent, while New Zealand’s NZX 50
Index declined 0.5 percent.  Singapore ’s Straits Times Index fell 0.4 percent even after
the government raised its growth forecast for 2013 after the
economy unexpectedly expanded last quarter. Taiwan’s Taiex index
retreated 1.3 percent.  U.S. Futures  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.2
percent today after the stocks gauge dropped 0.4 percent
yesterday. Central bank policy makers “generally expected that
the data would prove consistent with the committee’s outlook for
ongoing improvement in labor-market conditions and would thus
warrant trimming the pace of purchases in coming months,”
according to minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee’s Oct.
29-30 gathering released yesterday.  Perseus (AS51)  plunged 10 percent to 30 Australian cents as gold
traded near the lowest level in more than four months.  Newcrest
Mining Ltd. (NCM) , Australia’s biggest gold producer, declined 4
percent to A$8.70. Zijin Mining Group Co., China’s largest
producer of the precious metal, dropped 2.2 percent to HK$1.80.  Yen Slides  Japanese exporters rallied as the yen dropped against all
of its 16 major counterparts. Honda added 3.4 percent to 4,240
yen.  Fanuc Corp. (6954) , a maker of factory robotics that gets 78
percent of its sales abroad, rose 1.8 percent to 16,980 yen.  Prince Frog International slumped 22 percent to HK$3.63 as
it resumed trading after allegations from Glaucus Research Group
dropped the stock by a record last month. The short-seller on
Oct. 16 initiated coverage of Prince Frog at a strong sell,
saying tax records indicate the company’s net income was less
than reported. Prince Frog said the report was without merit and
said it will consider buying back shares.  Australand Property Group (ALZ)  fell 4 percent to A$3.60 in
Sydney, extending yesterday’s loss, after CapitaLand Ltd. said
it was selling part of its 59 percent stake in the developer to
raise as much as A$433.7 million ($403 million).  The Asia-Pacific gauge  traded  at 13.9 times estimated
earnings as of yesterday, compared with 16.1 for the S&P 500 and
15.1 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
