China ’s net exports of diesel rose
to the highest level in six months in October after refiners
were granted record sales quotas.  Overseas shipments of the fuel exceeded purchases by
200,211 metric tons, according to data e-mailed by the General
Administration of Customs in Beijing today. That’s about 48,600
barrels a day, the most since April, and more than triple net
exports in September, the data show.  China, the world’s second-largest oil consumer, is shipping
more diesel cargoes after the government increased export
allowances for China National Petroleum Corp. and  China
Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028) , its two biggest refiners. That’s
meant to preempt a surplus in fuel supply as plants restart
after seasonal repairs and upgrades, according to ICIS-C1
Energy, a Shanghai-based energy consultant.  “This quarter of the year usually is an off-season for
maintenance, meaning there will be enough fuel supply
domestically, thus the government approved a record quota for
diesel,” Jean Zou, an oil analyst at ICIS-C1, said by phone
from Guangzhou today.  The two refiners, which account for about 80 percent of
nation’s total crude processing volume, were granted a combined
diesel export quota of 1.7 million tons for the fourth quarter,
ICIS-C1 reported on Oct. 25. They may only use as much as 30
percent of this allowance as domestic demand is forecast to
increase by year end while the profit from selling to the Asian
market is suppressed, according to Zou.  Diesel’s premium to Dubai crude in  Singapore ,  Asia ’s oil
trading hub, dropped by 2.8 percent in October, the third
decline in three months, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The so-called gasoil  crack spread , a measure of
processing profit, has averaged $17.64 a barrel this year.  Fuel Oil  China’s net exports of gasoline fell to 323,666 tons last
month, the least since July, according to the customs data. Net
jet-kerosene exports climbed to a record 696,200 tons.  Imports of fuel oil, used by ships and smaller refineries
known as teapot plants, increased to 1.69 million tons in
October, the highest level in three months, the data show.
Shipments in the first 10 months of 2013 were 20.8 million.  Venezuela  remained the biggest  fuel oil  supplier to China
after it shipped 381,441 tons last month. Russia shipped 224,956
tons, Singapore delivered 307,381 tons and  Iran  sold 177,246
tons.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
