Astrum Solar Inc. , a Maryland-based
installer of residential solar systems,  raised  $7.5 million to
expand on both coasts, its chief executive officer said.  The company, based in Annapolis Junction, installed its
first system in 2009 and has customers in 11 states in the
Midwest and on the East Coast. It’s seeking to expand to the
West Coast, CEO Vadim Polikov said today in a phone interview.  The financing follows a $3 million equity round in 2011,
according to  filings  with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission.  Customers may buy systems or lease them with little or no
upfront cost, Polikov said. “We are similar to SolarCity in
that we do the installation in house, and we sell and market the
systems.”  SolarCity Corp. installs rooftop solar systems for
customers who typically pay little to nothing up front and sign
long-term contracts to buy the power.  To contact the reporter on this story:
