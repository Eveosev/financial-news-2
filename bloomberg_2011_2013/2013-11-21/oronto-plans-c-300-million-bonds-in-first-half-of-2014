Toronto will probably double
borrowing to C$600 million ($570 million) in 2014 from this
year, with half the issuance coming in the first six months,
according to the city’s chief financial officer.  “Investors keep calling us asking us when are we going to
do another debenture issue because they want to buy our bonds,”
Rob Rossini, deputy city manager and CFO, said in an interview.
“There’s strong demand for municipal bonds in general and
strong demand for our bonds as well.”  The city council has approved as much as C$900 million of
debt issuance for each year of the current four year term. The
city also issued C$600 million in 2012.  Toronto’s borrowing costs have not increased since Mayor
Rob Ford came under pressure to resign last week after admitting
to smoking crack cocaine, the city said today in a statement.  The average extra interest rate for Toronto bonds increased
four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 94 basis points
more than federal government benchmarks from Nov. 13 to Nov. 18,
according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Canadian
Provincial & Municipal Index. The city’s average spread fell to
89 basis points more than federal benchmarks as of the end of
trading yesterday, according to the index.  Rossini said investors are not concerned with the turmoil
at city hall.  “Our fiscal agents and our credit-rating agencies have
said none of this impairs our ability to repay our debt,”
Rossini said. “We are a very, very strong, high-quality credit
rating.”  Moody’s Investors Service rates Toronto’s debt Aa1, while
Standard & Poor’s gives the city a AA rating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
