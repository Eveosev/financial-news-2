Taiwan lawmakers will debate the
first amendments to its mergers and acquisitions law in nearly a
decade aimed at making transactions easier and protecting
shareholder rights.  The island’s cabinet approved draft rules today, which are
now subject to legislative review, according to a  statement  on
the government’s website. Revisions would allow greater
flexibility in deal structures and permit large shareholders to
participate in acquisition or spinoff decisions, Chen Mi-shun,
deputy director-general at Ministry of Economic Affairs’
Department of Commerce, said by phone today.  “Mergers will increase significantly after the rules eased
as it simplifies the process and diversifies the means of
payment into cash or shares,” said Alan Jih, senior attorney at
 Jones Day .  Cash could be used for acquisitions and spinoffs, an easing
of existing rules requiring the use of stock only, Chen said.
Companies would establish special committees comprised by
independent board directors and auditors, under the proposed
rules, for reviewing the price and terms of mergers or
acquisitions, Chen said.  Taiwan’s laws for mergers and acquisitions were introduced
in 2002 and were first revised in 2004, according to the
island’s cabinet.  To contact the reporter on this story:
