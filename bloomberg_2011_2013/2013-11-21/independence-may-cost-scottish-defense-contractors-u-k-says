Scottish defense contractors will
have less domestic demand and lose access to export markets in
the event of independence, the U.K. government said.  The companies, which employ 12,600 people and have annual
sales of more than 1.8 billion pounds ($2.9 billion), would no
longer be eligible to compete for orders being placed by the
U.K. Ministry of Defence for national-security reasons, the
government in  London  said in  response  to a  report  published
earlier in 2013 by lawmakers.  “It will be for the Scottish government to make its case
that an independent  Scotland  could sustain an appropriate level
of defense and security,” the U.K. government said. “Remaining
part of Britain offers certainty for people in Scotland.”  Defense and security, together with currency and welfare,
are at the heart of the debate about independence, the flagship
policy of Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond, who heads the
semi-autonomous government in Edinburgh, and his Scottish
National Party. A referendum will be held on Sept. 18 next year.  The SNP is seeking to cut  defense spending  and remove the
U.K.’s Trident nuclear missiles from Scottish soil. Its proposed
2.5 billion-pound budget was 7 percent of the U.K.’s spending
compared with Scotland’s 8.4 percent share of the population,
the U.K. government said today.  Defense contractors with units in Scotland include Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc,  BAE Systems Plc (BA/)  and Thales SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
