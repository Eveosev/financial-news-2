Hog futures fell on signs that U.S.
pork production is increasing as demand ebbs. Cattle gained.  Pork processors slaughtered 1.75 million animals this week,
up 3.5 percent from a weak earlier, U.S. Department of
Agriculture data show. Hog carcass weights increased 0.2 percent
to 211.4 pounds (95.8 kilograms) yesterday, and are up 2.4
percent from a year earlier, according to the USDA.  “Weights are at record levels,” Ron Plain, a livestock
economist at the University of Missouri in Columbia, said in a
telephone interview. “Domestic pork demand is declining.”  Hog futures for February settlement fell 0.4 percent to
close at 90.575 cents a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. Prices jumped 1.1 percent yesterday, the
most for the contract since Oct. 28.  Cattle futures for February delivery rose 0.3 percent to
$1.3235 a pound on the CME, a second straight gain.  Feeder-cattle futures for January settlement climbed 0.4
percent to $1.63375 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
