China  and Europe started talks on an
investment agreement and aim to boost bilateral trade to $1
trillion by 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said.  China and Europe will also discuss the feasibility of a
free-trade agreement and will have more cooperation in areas of
transportation, infrastructure as well as science and technology
innovation, Li said today at a China-EU summit in Beijing,
according to the official Xinhua News Agency. Li spoke after
meeting with European Union President  Herman Van Rompuy  and
European Commission President  Jose Barroso .  “All these moves will significantly boost bilateral trade
and economic cooperation,” Li said. “The plan is unprecedented
in its breadth of content, ranging from aerospace and counter-piracy to urbanization and energy.”  The aim of $1 trillion in bilateral trade would represent
an 83 percent increase from last year, when China-EU trade
totaled $546 billion, according to the Chinese Customs Office
website.  China supported Chinese companies to invest and do
businesses in Europe and hopes Europe can further loosen
restrictions on high-technology product exports to China, Xinhua
said in a separate report today, citing Premier Li.  Chinese President Xi Jinping, who met with  Van Rompuy  and
Barroso yesterday, was cited by Xinhua as saying the two sides
should expand cooperation in trade and investment while opposing
protectionism and promoting the development of an open global
economy.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
