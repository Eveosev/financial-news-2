David Einhorn , president of
Greenlight Capital Inc., recommended investors buy shares of
 Micron Technology Inc. (MU) , according to a person with knowledge of
the matter.  Einhorn recommended the trade at the Robin Hood Investors
Conference, according to a person who attended the event in New
York today, who asked not to be identified because the
presentation was private and closed to media.  Micron, the largest U.S. maker of memory chips, last month
reported fiscal  fourth-quarter results  that exceeded analysts’
estimates as higher average prices for chips helped make up for
lackluster demand for personal computers. Baupost Group LLC
added to a stake in Micron in the quarter ended Sept. 30, and
Viking Global Investors LP also bought shares in that period,
according to regulatory filings. Einhorn’s Greenlight had not
disclosed a stake in Micron as of Sept. 30.  Micron rose 4 percent at 11 a.m. in  New York  trading. The
shares have more than tripled this year amid an anticipated
increase in chip prices.  Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for Greenlight at Sard
Verbinnen & Co., declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
