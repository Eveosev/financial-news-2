Akzo Nobel (AKZA) , Europeâ€™s largest
paintmaker, plans to cease production of coil coatings at two
sites as Chief Executive Officer Ton Buechner pushes ahead with
plans to create more cost-effective manufacturing hubs.  Production of coil coatings will be terminated in Gamleby,
Sweden and Nurnberg,  Germany  by mid-year 2015, the Amsterdam-based company said today. Manufacturing will be concentrated at
another site in Germany, and two others in Sweden and Russia.  About 280 employees will be affected by the measures, Akzo
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
