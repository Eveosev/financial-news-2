Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell said regulators are attempting to fix the “significant
flaws” in the over-the-counter  derivatives market  that were
revealed by the financial crisis.  “Increased central clearing and margins for noncleared
derivatives are foundational elements of the program” which
“can help create a system in which the OTC derivatives-market
infrastructure acts as a pillar of strength in the next
crisis,” Powell said today in the text of remarks in New York.  Regulators have been working to toughen safeguards in the
$693 trillion OTC derivatives market blamed for worsening the
credit crisis, in part by moving most trading onto open
exchanges away from the private dealing that was the norm. The
Dodd-Frank financial overhaul legislation of 2010 required most
swaps to be backed by clearinghouses for the first time.  “To achieve this goal, it is imperative that international
standards” and “the margining framework for non-centrally
cleared derivatives be forcefully and consistently implemented
across the globe,” Powell said.  “The financial crisis revealed significant flaws in the
structure of the OTC derivatives markets that are now being
addressed as part of a worldwide reform effort,”  Powell said.
Central counterparties must be “safe and effective at managing
the risks, interactions and interdependencies inherent in the
clearing process.”  “Given their heightened prominence in the financial
infrastructure, if CCPs are to mitigate systemic risks they must
hold themselves to, and be held to, the highest standards of
risk management,” he said. “Effective risk management by both
a CCP and its clearing members need to work in concert.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
