U.K. government bonds fell, with 10-year yields touching a two-month high, after Federal Reserve
minutes showed officials may reduce debt purchases and data
pointed to accelerating British growth.  Gilts underperformed other European sovereigns, with the
 extra yield  that investors demand to hold U.K. 10-year bonds
instead of similar-maturity German bunds expanding to the most
since October 2005. The pound strengthened versus all of its 16
major counterparts, reaching three-year highs against the
Australian and Canadian dollars, after an industry report showed
a measure of new orders at British factories rose to the highest
in almost two decades in November.  “There’s a spillover into the U.K. from what the Fed
did,” said  Sam Hill , a U.K. rates strategist at Royal Bank of
Canada in London. Gilts are “under pressure,” he said.  The benchmark 10-year yield climbed nine basis points, or
0.09 percentage point, to 2.82 percent at 5:28 p.m. London time,
after rising to 2.87 percent, the highest since Sept. 24. The
2.25 percent bond due in September 2023 fell 0.705, or 7.05
pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,617) face amount, to 95.17.  U.S. policy makers “generally expected” improvement in
employment data that would “warrant trimming the pace of
purchases in coming months,” according to minutes of the Fed’s
Oct. 29-30 meeting released yesterday. The central bank buys $85
billion of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities a month.
The Fed next meets on Dec. 17-18.  Yield Spread  The spread between 10-year gilts and German bunds expanded
six basis points to 108 basis points, the widest close since
Oct. 25, 2005.  Five-year gilts fell for a third day after the Debt
Management Office sold 4.75 billion pounds of debt maturing in
July 2019.  The U.K. allotted the securities at an average yield of
1.905 percent, compared with 1.583 percent at an auction of
gilts due in July 2018 on Oct. 17.  The five-year gilt yield climbed six basis points to 1.57
percent, extending this month’s increase to 13 basis points.  Gilts handed investors a loss of 3.1 percent this year
through yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes.
German bonds slid 1.2 percent and Treasuries fell 2.6 percent.  Pound Rises  The pound strengthened 0.4 percent to $1.6170 after rising
to $1.6178 yesterday, the highest since Oct. 28. The U.K.
currency appreciated 0.2 percent to 83.31 pence per euro.
Sterling rallied as much as 1.4 percent to 1.7487 Australian
dollars, the strongest level since August 2010, and touched
1.6992 Canadian dollars, the highest rate since February 2010.  The Confederation of British Industry’s manufacturing gauge
climbed to 11 this month, the highest since March 1995, the
business lobby group said in  London . That exceeded the median
estimate of 1 in a Bloomberg News survey of economists.  “A very encouraging report that confirms the view that
activity in the U.K. has not decelerated,” Annalisa Piazza, an
analyst at Newedge Group in London, wrote in a note to clients.
“A progressive improvement remains the key scenario in the
coming months.”  The U.K. government’s budget shortfall excluding temporary
support for banks narrowed to 8.1 billion pounds in October,
compared with 8.28 billion pounds a year earlier, the  Office for
National Statistics  said.  The minutes of the  Bank of England ’s November meeting
released yesterday showed the Monetary Policy Committee voted
9-0 to keep the benchmark  interest rate  at 0.5 percent and the
 asset-purchase target  at 375 billion pounds.  The pound strengthened 6.7 percent in the past six months,
the best performer among 10 developed-market counterparts
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro rose
4.1 percent, while the dollar weakened 0.8 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
