Indonesia ’s rupiah dropped to the
weakest level since March 2009 and  government bonds  fell after
minutes of the  Federal Reserve ’s meeting spurred speculation
stimulus may be trimmed sooner than previously expected.  The currency dropped 0.4 percent to 11,703 per dollar as of
4:22 p.m. in Jakarta, prices from local banks show. It reached
11,733 earlier, the weakest level since March 31, 2009. In the
offshore market, one-month non-deliverable forwards declined 0.5
percent to 11,608 per dollar, 0.8 percent stronger than the
onshore spot rate, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The U.S. central bank expects data showing continued labor
market recovery in the world’s largest economy to “warrant
trimming the pace of purchases in coming months,” according to
the minutes released yesterday, referring to its record $85
billion a month of bond buying that has buoyed emerging-market
assets. Global funds sold  $322 million  more Indonesian stocks
than they bought in November through yesterday, set for the
biggest monthly outflow since August, exchange data show.  “The decline is across the board in reaction to the Fed
meeting minutes,” said Suriyanto Chang, head of treasury at PT
Bank QNB Kesawan in Jakarta. “In the coming months can mean
anything, but the rupiah is under pressure as investors are
still concerned the tapering will happen sooner.”  The yield on the nation’s 5.625 percent bonds maturing in
May 2023 climbed 20 basis points, or 0.20 percentage point, to
8.52 percent, the highest level since Sept. 12, prices from the
Inter Dealer Market Association show.  A  fixing  used to settle the rupiah forwards was set at
11,513 per dollar, from 11,407 yesterday, according to the
Association of Banks in  Singapore . One-month implied volatility
in the rupiah, a measure of expected moves in the  exchange rate 
used to price options, rose 26 basis points to 14.49 percent.  The Finance Ministry plans to raise $450 million at its
debut domestic dollar bond auction on Nov. 25, it said in a
statement on its website. The government will offer notes
maturing in May 2017 at the sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
