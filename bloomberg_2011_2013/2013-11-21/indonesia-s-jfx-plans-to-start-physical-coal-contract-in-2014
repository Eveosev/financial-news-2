The  Jakarta Futures Exchange  plans
to start a physical thermal coal contract next year to create an
alternative benchmark price in Indonesia, the world’s largest
exporter of the fuel for power-stations.  JFX has commitments from as many as five producers to sell
coal through its daily electronic spot trading system, Bihar
Sakti Wibowo, a director at the exchange, said in an interview
yesterday in Jakarta. Buyers will be a mix of traders and end-users and cargoes will be shipped for both domestic and export
markets, he said.  The Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry sets monthly
benchmark prices for miners to calculate selling prices and
royalties. The current marker is based on coal with a gross
heating value of 6,322 kilocalories a kilogram.  “The current benchmark’s price is often problematic, for
example when the price is set higher or lower than the market,”
Wibowo said. “This will make pricing in the exchange
important.”  The JFX is finalizing trading rules and deciding which coal
grades to use, Wibowo said. The exchange will submit the plan
for approval to  Indonesia ’s Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory
Agency next week, he said. The bourse, established in 1999, also
trades cocoa, palm olein and gold futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
