The  National Collegiate Athletic
Association  sued  Electronic Arts Inc. (EA) , saying the video-game
maker hasn’t agreed to indemnify the NCAA for legal claims by
college athletes and hasn’t maintained insurance to do so.  The NCAA is a co-defendant in a consolidated lawsuit by
student basketball and football players who allege their
likenesses were used in video games without compensation.
Electronic Arts in September agreed to settle the claims for $40
million. The NCAA wasn’t involved in the settlement.  The settlement would eliminate Electronic Arts’ contractual
duty to indemnify the Indianapolis-based NCAA for any liability,
as well as for its attorneys’ fees, arising from the NCAA-themed
football and basketball video games, according to the complaint
filed Nov. 4 in Fulton County,  Georgia .  “EA has continually refused to accept its responsibility
for its breaches of the video game licensing agreements and its
obligation to indemnify the NCAA under these agreements,”
according to the complaint.  John Reseburg, a spokesman for  Redwood City , California-based Electronic Arts, declined to comment on the lawsuit.  The case is National Collegiate Athletic Association v.
Collegiate Licensing Co., 2013CV238557, Fulton County, Georgia,
Superior Court.  To contact the reporter on this story:
