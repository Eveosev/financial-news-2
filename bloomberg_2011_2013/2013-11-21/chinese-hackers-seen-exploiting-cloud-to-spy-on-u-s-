China-based hackers may target
Internet-based e-mail, data storage and other services provided
overseas by such companies as  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  to spy on the
U.S., a congressional commission found.  The Chinese government wages “a large-scale cyber
espionage campaign” and “has successfully targeted the
networks of U.S. government and private organizations,” the
 U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission  concludes in
its annual report to Congress released yesterday.  The commission for the first time said cloud computing,
which connects Internet services, “represents a potential
espionage threat.” The report fails to cite any examples of the
Chinese government using the technology in attacks.  “Our focus has been on making sure that Defense Department
or State Department data, or other government information, is
secure,”  William Reinsch , chairman of the commission, told
reporters before the report’s release. “To the extent those
entities use the cloud as well, we think that they need to get a
better grip on who’s actually providing their services and where
their data is going.”  President  Barack Obama ’s administration and lawmakers have
used diplomacy and a public shaming campaign to pressure Beijing
to stop cyber-attacks that are estimated to cost the  U.S.
economy  as much as $300 billion a year. Their efforts have been
overshadowed by revelations since June that the National
Security Agency eavesdropped on foreign leaders, hacked into the
private networks of  Google Inc. (GOOG)  and  Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO)  abroad and spied
on Americans and foreigners without warrants.  China Connection  At a briefing today in Beijing, Hong Lei, a Chinese Foreign
Ministry spokesman, said the commission “year after year,
releases this kind of biased report and viewpoint.”  “China’s national defense strategy has always been
defensive. We are insistent on a peaceful development path,”
Hong said. “We hope this Commission can change its thinking and
do more that helps mutual trust and cooperation between China
and the U.S.”  China’s Ministry of State Security, which is the country’s
main foreign intelligence collection agency, is “closely
connected” to a special cloud-computing zone in the city of
Chongqing, the commission wrote. That represents a threat “to
foreign companies that might use cloud-computing services
provided from the zone or base operations there,” it concluded  Microsoft Findings  The only U.S. cloud provider singled out in the report as a
possible risk for hacks sponsored by the Chinese government  was
Microsoft because the Redmond, Washington-based company has
licensed its products to  21Vianet Group Inc. (VNET) , a Beijing-based
company selling online data center services.  The commission on Nov. 19 backed away from that assertion,
saying in a statement it had “been informed of new information
and will be reaching out to all involved parties to determine
what impact, if any, this has on the findings.”  “If we inadvertently included incorrect information, we
will make corrections as appropriate,” according to the
statement.  The commission based its conclusions about cloud computing
on a Sept. 5 report called  Red Cloud Rising  that it commissioned
from a private U.S. intelligence and security company, Defense
Group Inc., based in Vienna, Virginia.  The company was given incorrect information by Microsoft
about its relationship with 21Vianet when it wrote the September
report, Leigh Ann Ragland, one of the authors, said in an e-mail
on Nov. 19. She said the company was contacting the commission
to correct the report’s language.  No Access  While Microsoft licenses its Windows Azure and Office 365
products to 21Vianet, the Chinese company doesn’t have access to
“services and datacenters operated by Microsoft outside of
 China ,” Doug Hauger, Microsoft’s general manager for China
commercial cloud services, said in an e-mail on Nov. 19.  Microsoft Azure and Office 365 “include security
technologies, systems and monitoring to mitigate malicious
activities,” Hauger said. “If we believe malicious activity is
taking place, we investigate and take the appropriate action.”  Ragland said a theoretical cybersecurity concern still
exists if the Chinese government can find unknown
vulnerabilities, commonly referred to as zero-day exploits, in
Windows Azure to attack users overseas.  “Cloud computing technology enables hackers to better
obfuscate the source of their attacks, which also serves the
strategic interests of certain organizations within the PRC
military and government,” she said.  Recommendation to Congress  The commission recommends in its report that Congress
direct the Obama administration “to prepare an inventory of
existing federal use of cloud computing platforms and services
and determine where the data storage and computing services are
geographically located.” The inventory should be prepared
annually, it said.  “If you allow a Chinese entity to provide cloud services
then you’re entrusting them with your data,” Reinsch said.
“That creates with it certain risks.”  The commission’s assessment of the security vulnerabilities
received mixed reviews from cloud-computing industry
specialists.  “Every country is going to seek to use  information
technology  assets for surveillance,” Jim Reavis, executive
director of the Seattle-based nonprofit Cloud Security Alliance,
said in a phone interview.  Censorship, Regulations  He said U.S. information-technology companies aren’t
aggressively seeking to expand cloud services in China due to
restrictions that include regulations, an immature
telecommunications infrastructure and Internet censorship.  U.S. companies operating in China have been more affected
by revelations about the extent of NSA spying programs, he said,
since the disclosures by former government contractor Edward Snowden, who’s now in  Russia  on temporary asylum.  Cisco Systems
Inc. (CSCO)  last week became one of the first companies to warn
publicly that the disclosures have reduced its business in
China.  Daniel Castro, a senior analyst for the Information
Technology and Innovation Foundation, a Washington research
institution, said the commission’s report could damage a growing
industry in China.  “It feeds this narrative that is incorrect that security
is based on where you store data. It’s not,” Castro said in a
phone interview. “It’s based on the security protocols that you
have in place.”  The Defense Group estimated in its September report that
China’s cloud computing industry will continue to grow and be
valued at $163 billion by 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
