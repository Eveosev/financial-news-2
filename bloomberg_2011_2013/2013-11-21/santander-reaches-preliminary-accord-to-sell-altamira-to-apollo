Banco Santander SA (SAN) ,  Spain â€™s biggest
bank, reached a preliminary accord to sell Altamira, a unit that
handles loan recoveries and markets real estate, to  Apollo
Global Management LLC. (APO)   Santander expects the sale to Apollo European Principal
Finance Fund II to close in the coming weeks and will disclose
the price then, the Santander, Spain-based bank said in a filing
to regulators today.  Investors are looking for ways to profit from a Spanish
real estate crash that left the financial industry with more
than 180 billion euros ($242 billion) of souring assets and left
banks with the task of managing property piling up on their
balance sheets.  The La Caixa banking group said in September it would sell
51 percent of its Servihabitat Gestion Inmobiliaria to TPG
Special Situations Partners in a transaction that valued the
real estate servicing company at about 310 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
