Even with the smallest grape harvest
since 1991 in  Bordeaux ,  France ’s biggest wine-exporting region,
producers of the most-prestigious bottles will see prices fall
as buyers shift to cheaper alternatives.  Output of wine from Bordeaux will drop 23 percent this year
to 4.07 million hectoliters, or 543 million bottles, after
grapes failed to set and were damaged by hail and summer rot,
government data show. Top-ranked vineyards, or chateaux, may cut
prices for the 2013 vintage more than 25 percent next year on
weaker demand and perceived lower quality, said Allan Sichel,
the head of Bordeaux’s UMB union of wine merchants.  The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index of leading Bordeaux wines,
which were classified at the demand of Emperor Napoleon III in
1855, has tumbled 7.9 percent from a peak in March, heading for
a third straight annual decline, after reaching a record in
2011. The region accounted for 29 percent of the 7.84 billion
euros ($10.5 billion) of wine shipped last year by France, the
world’s top exporter. Sales of red Bordeaux to  China , the
biggest  importer , fell last year for the first time since 1999.  “Basic growing conditions over the course of the 2013
vintage were poor,”  Miles Davis , a partner at Wine Asset
Managers LLP, a London-based  fund manager  that  invests  in fine
wine and has $20 million under management, said by telephone on
Nov. 14. Between 2008 and 2012, “the rate of price increase in
Bordeaux has been greater than anywhere else,” he said.
“There’s not a lot of sympathy around for the place.”  Chinese Imports  China’s imports of bottled red Bordeaux slipped 0.3 percent
last year to 325.9 million euros, ending 12 years of rising
sales, even as volume rose 5.7 percent and demand increased for
less-expensive wines from the regions of Languedoc-Roussillon
and Cotes du Rhone, trade data show. Chinese importers paid 4.79
euros on average last year for a bottle of red Bordeaux, down
from 5.78 euros in 2011.  “Chinese demand has dropped dramatically, and no one is
taking up the slack,” Davis said. “The old-fashioned Bordeaux
buyers are not prepared to pay the new prices.”  A 12-bottle case of 2009 Chateau Lafite Rothschild sold for
6,750 pounds ($10,864) on the  Liv-ex market  on Oct. 18, taking
the vintage to a record low amid selling pressure on top
Bordeaux as investors focus on other regions. That’s down from
10,000 pounds in May 2010, immediately after its release to
market, and less than half the 14,300 pounds reached in November
2010 as Chinese demand was peaking.  Prices Drop  The Bordeaux slump comes amid price declines for most
commodities. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 raw
materials is down 5 percent this year, heading for the first
annual drop since the recession in 2008 after plunges for corn,
silver, gold and coffee. The Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Bond Index
lost 2.6 percent since the end of December, while the MSCI All-Country World Index of equities advanced 17 percent.  Bordeaux’s classified estates from Angelus to Vieux Chateau
Certan sell wine “en primeur,” or still in the cask, to
merchants in a futures market. Many 2012 Bordeaux wines quoted
on  London ’s Liv-ex exchange have dropped below the price at
which they were first offered to consumers and investors.  The average of all 344 Bordeaux wines from 2012 offered en
primeur was down 7.6 percent compared with the 2011 vintage,
Decanter magazine reported in June, citing data from wine broker
Tastet & Lawton. That was still up 30 percent from prices in
2008, before the peak of Chinese buying.  “It certainly doesn’t sound promising,” Jancis Robinson,
a U.K wine critic and editor of The Oxford Companion to Wine,
wrote in an e-mailed reply to questions on Nov. 13. “The market
for the last two vintages has been more sluggish than I can
remember for consecutive vintages. I can’t imagine that demand
will be at all strong for 2013s at 2012 pricing levels.”  Too Early  Growers including Beychevelle, Palmer, Pichon-Longueville
parent Axa Millesimes, a unit of French insurer  Axa SA (CS) , and
Mouton Rothschild said it’s too early to discuss 2013 pricing
because the vintages still need to be assembled.  The poor harvest may tempt the most prestigious estates to
keep prices near those of recent vintages.  “There could be tension on the prices of the most sought-after growths, taking into the account the volumes that are well
below those of 2012,” and leading to higher quotes, according
to e-mailed comments from Philippe Dhalluin, the director of
Chateau Mouton Rothschild.  Bordeaux’s top wines aren’t too expensive, said Xavier
Pariente, who runs Chateau Troplong Mondot and cut the price for
his 2012 vintage to 54 euros a bottle from 57.60 euros.  “Quality comes at a price,” Pariente said by telephone on
Nov. 14. “Don’t think for a second that a great bottle creates
itself. We know every grape bunch, stroke it every day, if
there’s a blemish, we remove it.”  Cold Spring  The vintage this year will be the smallest since the 2.59
million hectoliters produced in 1991, when spring frost
destroyed flower buds on both sides of the Gironde estuary that
separates Bordeaux’s left and right banks.  This year, a colder-than-normal spring affected flowering
and led to berry losses, particularly for merlot grapes. Warm
and rainy weather at the end of September caused the botrytis
fungus to spread through vineyards, prompting estates such as
 Mouton Rothschild  and Palmer to harvest earlier than planned.  Vines flowered around June 25, two weeks late, according to
Olivier Bernard, head of producer group Union des Grands Crus de
Bordeaux. Hot, humid conditions three months later led to rot in
ripening grapes. Some growers started the merlot harvest by the
end of September rather than in October.  Too Wet  The city of  Bordeaux  had 38 millimeters (1.5 inches) of
rain on Sept. 28, 45 percent of normal for the entire month,
while maximum temperatures of 26.1 degrees Celsius (79 degrees
Fahrenheit) that day were 2.2 degrees above the month’s average,
according to weather office Meteo-France.  To head off rot, Mouton Rothschild mobilized the office
workers of its holding company Baron Philippe de Rothschild SA
to help its regular pickers bring in the estate’s 83 hectares
(205 acres) of merlot and cabernet grapes, the grower said.  At Chateau Beychevelle, yields were the lowest ever after
“worrisome” levels of  botrytis  forced an early harvest of
grapes that were less mature than vintners desire, according to
Philippe Blanc, the domain’s managing director. The estate
produced no more than 32 hectoliters per hectare (342 gallons
per acre), compared with 42 hectoliters in 2012, and first-wine
output of 12-bottle cases will total 10,000 to 12,000, down from
the usual 20,000, Blanc said.  Slumping Market  Producers cut  prices  in 2011 in recognition of the
difference in quality with the two previous vintages, and most
lowered them again for last year’s issue.  Beychevelle this year cut its 2012 vintage to 40.80 euros a
bottle from 45.5 euros, according to prices tracked by Liv-ex.
That’s still almost double the 2008 value of 21.50 euros. Mouton
Rothschild dropped to 240 euros a bottle from 360 euros, having
raised the price to 660 euros in 2010. The estate had priced its
2008 vintage at 120 euros. Chateau Palmer 2012 carried a
merchant price of 160 euros a bottle, down from 162 euros in
2011 and 215 euros in 2010.  The higher prices of recent years are boosting demand for
wine from other regions and prompting investors such as Davis to
prefer Champagne and  Italy ’s Tuscany as well as older Bordeaux
vintages.  “En primeur prices of the two last vintages have been so
high and completely out of kilter,” said Davis at Wine Asset
Managers. “The Bordeaux market is dead. People are fed up with
en primeur pricing.”  Liv-Ex Pricing  Average prices for the 2012 vintage of the 50 top wines in
the Liv-ex Bordeaux 500 Index have slipped 3.8 percent in the
past three months, led by a drop for  Chateau Petrus . The same
basket of wines from the 2011 vintage has added 2.6 percent in
the past 12 months, compared with a 6.7 percent increase for
2010 wines.  The average cost of a 2012 bottle of the top Bordeaux wines
quoted on Liv-ex is 158.75 euros, ranging from 24.42 euros for
Lagrange Saint Julien to 1,725 euros for the most-recent Chateau
Petrus.  “No one will be excited about the 2013 vintage, so it’ll
be complicated to justify high prices,” Sichel of the UMB said.
While some estates that carry low or no inventories of unsold
2011 and 2012 may be tempted to charge last year’s prices, those
will be “exceptional cases,” he said.  The young wine that Sichel has tasted so far, while lacking
the green notes of unripe fruit, doesn’t have “a lot of depth”
and may have difficulty developing a lot of complexity, with
bottles that may be best drunk young, he said.  Estates need to price 2013 “realistically” or “risk
losing the market completely,”  Chris Smith , an investment
director at the Wine Investment Fund in London, said by
telephone on Nov. 14.  “It’s going to be a small crop of fairly low-quality
wine,” Smith said. “When you get Bordeaux chateaux saying it’s
an average year, that’s about as bad as it gets.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
