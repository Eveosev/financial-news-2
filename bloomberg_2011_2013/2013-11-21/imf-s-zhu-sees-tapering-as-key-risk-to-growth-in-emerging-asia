Several emerging economies in  Asia 
face a “key source of risk” in the eventual tapering of
monetary stimulus in advanced nations, an International Monetary
Fund official said.  “Global growth is in low gear and downside risks
persist,” IMF Deputy Managing Director Zhu Min said in prepared
remarks for a conference in Port Vila, Vanuatu. He didn’t
specify which countries were at risk from the scaling back of
so-called quantitative easing policies that the central banks of
 Japan  and the U.S. have adopted.  “Advanced economies are recovering, but overall recovery
is slow and is hindered by constraints on both the demand and
the supply sides,” he said. “ Emerging markets  are still in the
lead, although they are slowing down from elevated levels in
recent years.”  He said economic expansion in emerging Asia is expected to
reach 6.25 percent to 6.5 percent this year and next.  To contact the reporter on this story:
