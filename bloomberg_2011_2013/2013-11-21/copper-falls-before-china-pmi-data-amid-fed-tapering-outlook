Copper declined after minutes from
the  Federal Reserve ’s last meeting signaled U.S. stimulus may be
cut in coming months and ahead of a private manufacturing gauge
for China today.  The contract for delivery in three months on the London
Metal Exchange dropped as much as 0.7 percent to $6,950 a metric
ton and traded at $6,954.75 at 10:34 a.m. in  Tokyo . The metal
fell 12 percent this year.  Policy makers expected economic data to signal further
improvement in the job market and “thus warrant trimming the
pace of purchases in coming months,” minutes of the Fed’s
October meeting showed yesterday. The HSBC Holdings Plc/Markit
Economics purchasing managers’ index may come in at 50.8 for
November from 50.9 in October, according to the median of 18
economists’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Readings above 50
signal expansion.  “The Fed minutes indicated U.S. stimulus will be tapered
in coming months, weighing on copper prices,” said  Kazuhiko Saito , an analyst at commodities broker Fujitomi Co. in Tokyo.
Investors were also watching the private report on China’s
manufacturing, he said.  Copper for delivery in February on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange slid 0.8 percent to 49,940  yuan  ($8,195) a ton. Futures
for delivery in March lost 0.4 percent to $3.157 a pound on the
Comex in New York.  On the LME, lead also declined, while aluminum, nickel and
zinc were little changed. Tin hadn’t traded.  To contact the reporter on this story:
