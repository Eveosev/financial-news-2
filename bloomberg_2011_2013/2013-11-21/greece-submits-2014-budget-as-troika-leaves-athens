Greece  submitted its 2014 budget
plan forecasting a bigger surplus before interest costs this
year than previously anticipated, strengthening its hand in
talks with creditors over releasing further bailout funds.  The primary surplus will be at least 812 million euros
($1.1 billion) this year, instead of the 344 million euros
forecast last month, rising to 2.96 billion euros in 2014, or
1.6 percent of gross domestic product, according to the plan
submitted to parliament by Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras.
The figure excludes transfers received from the euro area
corresponding to European Central Bank profits on Greek bonds,
which are not accounted for in Greece’s bailout evaluation.  Under the accord with the troika of the European
Commission,  International Monetary Fund  and ECB, posting a
primary surplus will qualify Greece for additional debt relief.
The government and troika officials have been locked in talks
since September, with the two sides disagreeing over fiscal
measures needed for the country to achieve its 2014 budget
projections. The troika mission chiefs will leave Athens today
and return early next month, according to a statement.  ‘Good Progress’  “Good progress has been made, but a few issues remain
outstanding,” the Commission, IMF and ECB said in the joint
statement today. The troika held “productive discussions with
the authorities on the set of policies that could serve as a
basis for the completion of the ongoing review,” they said.  The European Union’s Economic and Monetary Affairs
Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said today that the review will conclude
by January at the latest.  Greece’s budget plan sees  GDP (GKGNGDPY)  rising 0.6 percent in 2014
after falling 4 percent this year, its sixth year of recession.
 Unemployment (GKUQR)  is seen averaging 24.5 percent next year from a
25.5 percent average rate in 2013.  The overall  budget deficit  will widen to 2.3 percent of GDP
in 2014 from 2.2 percent of GDP this year, excluding the cost of
recapitalizing the country’s lenders, according to the budget.
Public debt is seen coming down to 174.8 percent of GDP next
year from 175.5 percent this year.  Parliament will vote on the budget plan on either Dec. 7 or
Dec. 8 after debate begins at committee stage on Nov. 25,
Parliament speaker Evangelos Meimarakis told lawmakers in  Athens 
today. Prime Minister Antonis Samaras’s coalition government
controls 154 seats in the 300-seat legislature.  To contact the reporters on this story:
