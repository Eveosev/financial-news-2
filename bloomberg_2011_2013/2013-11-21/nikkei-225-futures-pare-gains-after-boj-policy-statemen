 Japanese  stock futures  trimmed
gains after the Bank of  Japan  issued a statement that it kept
monetary policy unchanged.  Nikkei 225 Stock Average futures traded at 15,330 in
 Singapore  as of 12:16 p.m. in Tokyo. Before the central bank
announcement, the Nikkei 225 climbed 1.6 percent to 15,322.46 at
the trading break in Tokyo. The broader  Topix index  added 0.9
percent to 1,243.87.  All economists in a Bloomberg survey forecast that at
todayâ€™s meeting the bank would keep its pledge to expand the
monetary base by 60-70 trillion yen ($600-700 billion) a year.  Nineteen said the BOJ would add stimulus in the second
quarter of next year after the sales-tax bump starting in April,
with seven saying it would ease policy in the July-September
period.  The central bank will at some stage alter its target of 2
percent inflation in two years as unprecedented bond-buying
proves insufficient to achieve the goal, economists forecast in
the survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
