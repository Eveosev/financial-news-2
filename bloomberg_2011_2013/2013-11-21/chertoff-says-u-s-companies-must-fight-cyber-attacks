Former Homeland Security Secretary
 Michael Chertoff  said the U.S. government must work more closely
with companies to protect  computer networks  from cyber-attacks.  “If we see something coming across our network, we ought
to share it as widely as possible,” Chertoff said today at
“The Year Ahead: 2014,” a conference in Chicago hosted by
Bloomberg LP. “If we don’t do that, we are giving the adversary
an opportunity” to penetrate sensitive systems.  Increased involvement by companies is needed because “most
of the networks are privately owned,” he said in an interview
with  Erik Schatzker  of Bloomberg Television.  Chertoff, who served under President  George W. Bush , said
government requests for computer records from U.S. companies can
be “used in a way to kind of put American companies on the
defensive” because of the perception that it can be easier to
do work overseas to protect privacy.  Asked about terrorist threats to the U.S., Chertoff said
“low-level” incidents are likelier than another assault on the
scale of the Sept. 11 attacks that killed almost 3,000 people.  Chertoff, 59, is the co-founder and managing principal of
the Chertoff Group in Washington, which advises corporate and
government leaders on security issues.  Before heading  Homeland Security  from 2005 to 2009,
Chertoff was a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals. He also was a
federal prosecutor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
