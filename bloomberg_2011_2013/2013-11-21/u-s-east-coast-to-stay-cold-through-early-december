Temperatures will be below normal
the U.S. East Coast into the first week of December, said  Matt Rogers , president of the Commodity Weather Group LLC.  Temperatures will be as much as 8 degrees Fahrenheit (4.4
Celsius) below normal from Nov. 26 to Nov. 30 from Texas to New
England, including Houston,  New York  and Toronto. Readings are
expected to be at least 3 degrees below from Dec. 1 to Dec. 5
over much the same area, Rogers said in his forecast.  “The Midwest, East and South all see colder changes to
next week’s forecast as a robust secondary cold push drops
down,” Rogers wrote from his office in Bethesda,  Maryland .  Below-normal temperatures, especially in Eastern and
Midwestern cities, tend to increase energy consumption as more
people heat homes and businesses. November marks the start of
the U.S. heating season, when natural gas demand peaks.  Power generation accounts for 32 percent of U.S. gas use,
according to the Energy Information Administration, the Energy
Department’s statistical arm. About 49 percent of all homes use
the fuel for heating.  The normal average temperature in New York on Nov. 27 is
about 45 degrees, according to MDA Weather Services in
Gaithersburg, Maryland. In  Boston , it’s 42; in  St. Louis , 41;
Dallas, 52; Houston, 59; Chicago, 35; Burbank, California, 57;
and in Calgary, it’s 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
