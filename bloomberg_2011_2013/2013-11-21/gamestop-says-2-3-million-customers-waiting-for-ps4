GameStop Corp. (GME) , the largest
specialty retailer of video games, said its initial allocation
of PlayStation 4 consoles sold out and that 2.3 million
customers are waiting for new players from  Sony Corp. (6758)  and
 Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)   Initial sales of the player exceeded its predecessor, the
PlayStation 3, by more than 80 percent in the first few days,
executives of the Grapevine, Texas-based chain said today on a
conference call with analysts. They also anticipate a large
waiting list for Microsoft Corp.’s Xbox One, suggesting a
prolonged industry sales slump is ending.  “We still have over 2.3 million customers on the First to
Know List, which indicates continued demand for months to
come,” GameStop President Tony Bartel said on the call.  Sony said on Nov. 17 it sold more than 1 million
PlayStation 4 consoles in the U.S. and  Canada  within 24 hours of
the $399 machine going on sale. The figure included some of the
1 million units Tokyo-based Sony presold on a global basis, said
Dan Race, a PlayStation spokesman.  Microsoft’s $499 Xbox One goes on sale tomorrow in 13
countries and also is expected to be in high demand after a
seven-year drought on new home consoles from the two companies.
 Nintendo Co. (7974) ’s Wii U is entering its second year of sales.  GameStop fell 6.9 percent to $48.80 at the close in New
York, the biggest decline since May. The company forecast
fourth-quarter profit of $1.97 to $2.14 a share, less than the
$2.16 average of 20 analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  The retailer, which accounts for more than half of Sony and
Microsoft’s video-game software sales, will benefit from the
console transition based on its ability to lure gamers who trade
in older titles and hardware for discounts on new gear, said
 Colin Sebastian , an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co. in San
Francisco. He recommends buying the stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
