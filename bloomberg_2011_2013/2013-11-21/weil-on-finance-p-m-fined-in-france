Welcome back to another linkfest, View fans. Here are your afternoon reads. The  check  is definitely not in the  mail Mike Shedlock, one of my favorite libertarian economics bloggers, has a bizarre post about how he learned he had been fined 8,000 euros by a French financial-markets regulator for quoting a French blogger who also had been fined by the same regulator. "I would have known earlier, but the letter notifying me of the fine was sent in French," he writes, adding that the regulator "has no jurisdiction over me, so they won't collect." The second link takes you to Econintersect, which has an article with more of the backstory. It seems this all got started when the French blogger published an analysis of the French bank Societe Generale back in 2011 that the bank didn’t like so much. There's a  good reason  for all this  talk about bubbles  lately Lots of investors keep seeing them: "Asset bubbles are forming in Internet and social media stocks as well as in the housing markets of London and China, according to the latest Bloomberg Global Poll. Eighty-two percent of the responding investors, analysts and traders who are Bloomberg subscribers said Internet and social media shares are either at or near unsustainable levels. Seventy-three percent said the same of Chinese house prices, and 69 percent identified London homes as already or almost frothy." Of course anytime lots of people see bubbles, others see debating points. All of this bubble chatter may well be a contrary indicator, say the good folks at Ciovacco Capital Management. BusinessWeek declared the "Death of Equities" in a 1979 cover story, and people are still talking about that one. Short-seller  attacks are working again Shares of a 3D-printing company called Voxeljet AG have been getting crushed this week, in response to a bearish report by Citron Research, which is known for having called many great shorts over the years. Miniature blog posts aren't the ideal place to throw around allegations, denials, counter attacks, etc. So I'll just send you to the link, and you can decide for yourself if the report is persuasive. The company went public only last month. So welcome to the capital markets, Voxeljet. This writer may have a point about  quantitative easing  and how America may need to accept that we'll never get rid of it David Cottle of the Wall Street Journal says: "Nuclear weapons, nerve gas, boy bands. There are some things which, once invented, we end up dearly wishing we could un-invent, but it just isn’t so easy. Quantitative easing is likely to end up in the same category. Now it’s been used, and widely, it will always be with us. Markets might do well to remember this even as they seem to look upon the latest set of Fed minutes and despair that they'll soon have to go cold turkey on their favorite drug. As we pointed out some time ago, QE can be a very difficult habit to kick. Look at Japan."
