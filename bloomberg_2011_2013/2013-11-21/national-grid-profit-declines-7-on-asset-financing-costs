National Grid Plc (NG/) , the operator of
energy networks in Britain and  North America , said first-half
profit dropped 7 percent as financing costs rose.  Pretax profit fell to 979 million pounds ($1.58 billion) in
the six months through September from 1.05 billion pounds a year
earlier, the London-based company said today in a statement.
Operating profit slipped 1 percent to 1.57 billion pounds.  The decline reflects the “temporary additional cost of
pre-financing asset growth at attractive  interest rates ,”
National Grid said. “We continue to invest efficiently in
essential regulated assets on both sides of the Atlantic.”  The company has raised investment in power transmission and
gas distribution in the U.S. while increasing spending on U.K.
networks to accommodate more generation from low-carbon sources
such as wind farms. It will spend about 3.5 billion pounds this
fiscal year, “slightly” lower than its previous forecast, to
drive regulated-asset growth of about 6 percent, it said.  National Grid dropped as much as 1.9 percent in London
trading, the biggest intraday decline in eight weeks. The stock
was down 0.3 percent at 765.5 pence as of 8:15 a.m. local time.  The company’s U.K. businesses, in their first year of new
price controls, are on schedule to deliver “strong returns,”
Chief Executive Officer Steve Holliday said in the statement.
National Grid expects net debt to increase by about 1 billion
pounds this fiscal year from last March, excluding the effect of
exchange rates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
