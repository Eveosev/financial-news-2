Microsoft Corp. will take over  Nokia
Oyj (NOK1V) ’s glass-walled headquarters, one of  Finland ’s best-known
buildings, once the software giant’s deal to buy the Finnish
company’s mobile-phone business is completed.  Nokia will move to a location further away from central
Helsinki, to a campus where its network-equipment business is
based, James Etheridge, a spokesman for the Finnish company,
said today in an e-mailed statement.  Microsoft gains occupancy of a landmark complex whose
construction in the 1990s symbolized Nokia’s rise into Finland’s
first major global corporation. The building, just outside
Helsinki in Espoo, is by the shore and offers expansive views to
the  Baltic Sea  from its meeting rooms. It is situated on a busy
highway between Finland’s two biggest cities and is seen by tens
of thousands of commuters every day.  The Karaportti campus, where Nokia will move, is further
inland in Espoo and resembles more of a traditional industrial
estate.  Nokia’s shareholders agreed this week to sell its device
unit to Microsoft in a 5.44 billion-euro ($7.3 billion) deal.
The majority of workers in the current head office, which Nokia
sold last year and leased back to cut costs, work for the unit
to be acquired by Microsoft. Nokia is renovating a building at
the Karaportti campus for its future use, Etheridge said.  Microsoft and Nokia expect to complete their deal in the
first quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
