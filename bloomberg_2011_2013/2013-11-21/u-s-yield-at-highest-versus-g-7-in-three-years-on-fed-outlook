Treasury 10-year note yields reached
the highest level in two months as a report showing U.S. jobless
claims fell more than forecast last week added to speculation
the  Federal Reserve  is moving closer to reducing bond purchases.  U.S. debt  was little changed after slumping yesterday as
minutes of the Fed’s October meeting showed officials may reduce
their $85 billion a month of bond-buying if the  U.S. economy 
improves as anticipated. The difference between the yields on
two- and 10-year notes widened as much as 2.56 percentage
points, the most since August 2011 as investors demand more to
own longer-term securities before tapering begins. The Treasury
sold $13 billion of 10-year inflation-protected securities at
the highest yield since July 2011.  “There’s still some speculation they could move by the end
of the year, but it’s more likely the Fed needs to see more
strength in the data over a period of time to be comfortable
tapering,” said  David Coard , head of fixed-income trading in
 New York  at Williams Capital Group LP, a brokerage for
institutional investors. “There’s a little bit of bargain-hunting with this backup in yields.”  The benchmark  10-year yield  fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 2.78 percent at 4:59 p.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2.75 percent note
due in November 2023 rose 1/8, or $1.25 per $1,000 face amount,
to 99 22/32. The yield rose as much as four basis points and
touched the highest level since Sept. 18.  Off Highs  The 10-year yields slipped from the day’s highs as the
increase in yields attracted buyers.  “The market got a little bit oversold,” said Dan Mulholland, head of Treasury trading at BNY Mellon Capital
Markets in New York. “Short-term, we’re oversold, long term
we’re probably getting closer to fair value.”  Treasury trading  volume  at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , was at $419 billion,
above the 2013 average of $315 billion. Volume fell to a 2013
low of $147.8 billion on Aug. 9. The high was $662.3 billion on
May 22.  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Merrill Lynch
MOVE Index rose to 68.35 after reaching 58.31 on Nov. 18, the
lowest level since May. It touched a record low of 48.87 on May
9 and a 2013 high of 117.89 on July 5.  Yield Difference  The  difference  between the yields on three-year notes and
the 30-year bond, known as the yield curve, was at 3.33
percentage points. It earlier reached 3.38 percentage points, a
level not seen for more than two years. The yield spread jumped
12 basis points yesterday after central bank policy makers said
they expect “ongoing improvement in labor market conditions.”  The steeper curve “reflects the potential for the Fed to
taper,” said Jason Rogan, managing director of U.S. government
trading at Guggenheim Securities LLC, a New York-based brokerage
for institutional investors. “It seems the Fed is ready to
taper in December if the data gives them reason to.”  Treasuries have lost 2.6 percent this year through
yesterday, according to the  Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. (BUSY)   U.S. Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, or TIPS, lost
8.4 percent this year through yesterday, underperforming
Treasuries which fell 2.6 percent, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch Indexes.  TIPS Sale  The 10-year TIPS yielded 0.56 percent at today’s auction,
compared with an estimate of 0.59 percent, according to the
average forecast of five of the Fed’s primary dealers in a
Bloomberg News survey.  Direct bidders purchased 21.5 percent of the securities,
the highest since September 2011. Indirect bidders, a group of
investors that include foreign central banks, purchased 46.7
percent, the least since September 2012.  The U.S. previously sold 10-year TIPS on Sept. 19 at a
yield of 0.5 percent. TIPS pay interest at lower rates than
regular Treasuries on a principal amount that’s adjusted based
on the Labor Department’s consumer price index.  The U.S. is scheduled to sell $32 billion in two-year
notes, $35 billion in five-year debt and $29 billion in seven-year securities on three consecutive days starting Nov. 25.  The five-year notes to be sold may be considered an
additional issue of the outstanding seven year notes sold
Nov.30, 2011 if the auction results in a high yield ranging from
1.375 percent to 1.499 percent, according to the Treasury.  Fed Buys  The Fed today bought $4.8 billion of debt maturing between
November 2017 and July 2018.  Fed Bank of St. Louis President  James Bullard  said
yesterday a cutback in the bond-purchase program is “on the
table” for policy makers’ December meeting.  Four of five investors expect the Fed to delay a decision
to begin reducing its bond buying until March 2014 or later,
with just 5 percent looking for a move next month, according to
a Bloomberg Global Poll released before yesterday’s minutes.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said this week that the
benchmark  interest rate  will probably stay low long after the
central bank’s asset purchases end.  Jobless claims in the week ended Nov. 16 dropped by 21,000
to 323,000, the fewest since the week ended Sept. 28, from a
revised 344,000 the previous week, the Labor Department said in
 Washington . The median forecast of 47 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg called for a drop to 335,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
