Resolution Ltd. (RSL) , the British
insurance buyout firm and parent company of Friends Life, is in
discussions to sell Lombard, its European wealth manager.  There’s no certainty that talks will lead to a transaction,
the company said in a statement today. Friends Life’s
predecessor,  Friends Provident , acquired Lombard for 265 million
euros ($356 million) in 2004 to expand internationally and boost
life insurance revenue from wealthy clients.  “A further announcement will be made as and when
appropriate,” Resolution said in the statement. A spokesman for
Resolution declined to comment beyond the statement.  Friends Provident scrapped plans to sell Lombard in 2008
after a 10-month search failed to find a buyer. London-based
private-equity firm CVC Capital Partners Ltd. had been in talks
at the time to buy Lombard.  Barclays Plc is advising Resolution on the sale, according
to  Sky News , which reported the talks earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
