Switzerland ’s independent wealth
managers may increase client assets next year by attracting
customers, adding net new money or acquiring competitors,
according to a survey.  While 57 percent of firms predicted managed assets will
advance, 36 percent saw client funds as stable in 2014, Coutts,
a wealth-management unit of Edinburgh-based  Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc (RBS) , said in a joint  study  with Wealth Briefing
today, after polling 109 Swiss businesses.  Switzerland and western Europe will be the key region for
business growth in the next two years, according to 49 percent
of respondents. Fewer managers expect to expand in  emerging
markets , with 11 percent identifying Asia, and 8 percent
selecting eastern Europe and the  Middle East  for growth, the
survey showed.  Switzerland is tightening regulation of its 2,500
independent asset managers, prompting companies to consider
mergers to pool costs. Independent advisers, which provide
investment advice to wealthy people who deposit assets with the
nations’ banks, oversee an estimated 600 billion francs ($656
billion), according to the  Swiss Association of Asset Managers ,
which has more than 1,000 members.  Operational costs will increase next year, according to 59
percent of firms participating in the Coutts study, while 34
percent see no change in expenses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
