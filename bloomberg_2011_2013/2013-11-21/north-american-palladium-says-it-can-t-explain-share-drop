North American Palladium Ltd. (PDL) , the
operator of the Lac des Iles mine in Ontario, said it’s not
aware of any reason for the 27 percent plunge in its share price
two days ago.  The company is “working hard” to obtain additional
financing, Chief Executive Officer Phil du Toit said today in a
statement. North American said it will provide an update if and
when a “firm commitment materializes.” The Toronto-based
company is expanding Lac des Iles to raise palladium output and
reduce production costs.  The company is still “optimistic about the mine’s future
cash generation potential,” du Toit said. “2013 is a critical
transitional year and the financial challenges that we are
encountering are no doubt related to this transitional phase.”  The shares were unchanged yesterday, closing at 51 Canadian
cents in Toronto, a 30-year low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
