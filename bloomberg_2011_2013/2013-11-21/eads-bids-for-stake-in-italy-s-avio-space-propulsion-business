European Aeronautic, Defence & Space
Co. (EAD)  said it’s aiming to buy a stake in Italy’s Avio SpA as
private equity firm Cinven Ltd. seeks to cut its holding in a
company whose remaining business is focused on rocket engines.  “We made an offer in the frame of the disposal process,” 
EADS spokesman Martin Aguera said by e-mail. Cinven has a 81 
percent stake in Rome-based Avio, with 14 percent held by 
Italian aerospace company  Finmeccanica SpA. (FNC)   General Electric Co. (GE)  bought Avio’s commercial aircraft
engine activities this year in a $4.3 billion transaction that
did not include space propulsion activities involved in powering
rockets such as Europe’s Ariane 5 launcher.  Finmeccanica Chief Executive Officer Alessandro Pansa said
Nov. 8 the company was in talks with Cinven and “other
international companies” about further investment in Avio.  Safran SA (SAF)  also made a non-binding offers for Avio valued at
around 300 million euros, Defense News said in September, citing
an unidentified person familiar with the talks. CEO Jean-Paul Herteman said Oct. 24 it would “make sense” to combine the
company’s space activities with Avio. Spokeswoman Catherine Malek declined to say today whether a bid was made.  To contact the reporters on this story:
