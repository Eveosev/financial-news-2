Yuan  forwards fell the most in three
weeks after China’s central bank weakened the currency’s onshore
reference rate by the most since July.  The People’s Bank of China lowered the yuan’s daily  fixing 
by 0.1 percent, the most since July 30, to 6.1366 per dollar
today. Deputy Governor Yi Gang said in a speech yesterday that
it no longer benefits China to increase the nation’s foreign-currency reserves that now exceed a record $3.7 trillion.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards fell 0.08 percent to
6.1504 per dollar at 10:18 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts traded at a 0.9 percent
 discount  to the onshore spot rate, which was little changed at
6.0930, China Foreign Exchange Trade System prices show. The
spot rate in  Shanghai  is allowed to diverge a maximum 1 percent
from the fixing.  “The PBOC will intervene less and allow more two-way moves
for the currency,” said Teck Kin Suan, a Singapore-based
economist at United Overseas Bank Ltd. “They will probably give
more movement to the fixing rather than just have a one-way
appreciation.”  A Chinese manufacturing gauge declined for the first time
in four months, limiting a recovery in the world’s second-largest economy as leaders start to implement the broadest
policy reforms since the 1990s.  The preliminary 50.4 reading in November for a Purchasing
Managers’ Index released today by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics compared with the 50.8 median estimate of analysts
surveyed by  Bloomberg News . The final number for October was
50.9. Levels above 50 indicate expansion.  In  Hong Kong ’s offshore market, the yuan slid 0.09 percent
to 6.0720 per dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
One-month implied volatility in the onshore yuan, a measure of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, rose
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 1.64 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
