Australia  slumped to 273-8 on the
opening day of the first Ashes cricket Test as England’s  Stuart
Broad  took five wickets.  None of the top six batsmen reached 50 runs in Brisbane for
the hosts after Australia elected to bat. Broad took 5-65 for
England, which is trying to add to its three successive Ashes
victories.  Ian Bell caught both opening batsman Chris Rogers and
captain Michael Clarke on 1 off of the bowling of Broad, who
took the wickets of the top four batsman. Brad Haddin is
unbeaten on 78 alongside Ryan Harris on 4 at the end of the
first day.  Mitchell Johnson was bowled by Broad on 64 after combining
for 114 with Haddin to steady Australia. England’s  James
Anderson  took 2-61, while Chris Tremlett took the other wicket.  England hasn’t claimed four straight Ashes victories since
winning the opening eight series after the contest was founded
in 1882. That sequence ended in 1890, when Queen Victoria was
nearing the last decade of her 63-year reign over the British
Empire.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
