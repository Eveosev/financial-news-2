BlackBerry Ltd. (BB)  said it made an
acquisition earlier this year, placing a bet on the future of
its instant-messaging service just months before it made
preparations to sell itself.  The struggling Canadian smartphone maker said today that it
acquired software developer  Scroon  in May, its first publicly
disclosed acquisition in more than a year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The French startup manages Facebook,
Twitter and other social-media accounts for large clients like
luxury-good maker LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA, wireless
operator  Orange SA (ORA)  and Warner Bros. Entertainment. Financial
terms weren’t disclosed.  Scroon is part of a strategy to profit from the BlackBerry
Messenger instant-messaging service, said  Alexandre Mars , the
startup’s founder, in an e-mail. Waterloo, Ontario-based
BlackBerry made the BBM software available for free last month
to iPhone and Android smartphones users, who have since
downloaded it at least 20 million times. It’s one of the few
areas of growth for BlackBerry, which took a writedown in
September of almost $1 billion for unsold phones.  BBM, which comes already installed on BlackBerry phones,
now has more than 80 million users, including 20 million on
Google Inc.’s Android platform and Apple Inc.’s iOS, BlackBerry
said last month.  New BBM channels -- essentially chat rooms focused on
specific themes -- will eventually create opportunities for
advertisers to target users by sponsoring posts, Andrew Bocking,
the BlackBerry executive in charge of BBM, said in an interview
in May. It’s too early to say when BBM channels might begin to
generate revenue, he said at the time.  ‘Delicate Buzz’  Scroon’s Mars said he hadn’t disclosed the purchase by
BlackBerry before because of the “delicate media buzz” around
the company, which introduced a new line of phones this year in
an attempt to regain market share. After the devices flopped
with consumers, BlackBerry announced in August it would consider
takeover offers and focus more on phones for business users.
This month, it shelved plans to sell itself to a group led by
 Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd. (FFH) , its largest shareholder.  BlackBerry dropped 0.7 percent to $6.04 at the close in  New
York , bringing its decline this year to 49 percent.  The last time BlackBerry disclosed that it had bought a
company was in March 2012, when it acquired Paratek Microwave
Inc., according to merger-and-acquisition data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
