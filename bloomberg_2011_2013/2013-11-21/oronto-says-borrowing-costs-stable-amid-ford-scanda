Toronto’s borrowing costs remain
stable after council voted to remove some of Mayor Rob Ford’s
powers and censure him for smoking  crack cocaine , the city said
today in a statement.  Spreads on Toronto’s most recent bond have held steady
since issue, the city said. Toronto sold C$300 million ($285
million) 10-year bonds in September at an interest rate 26 basis
points, or 0.26 percentage point, more than comparable Province
of Ontario bonds, the city said in a  statement . That issue is
now trading 25 basis points more than the Ontario benchmark, the
city said.  “Recent events at  City Hall  have had absolutely no impact
on our costs or our ability to borrow funds,” Joe Pennachetti,
Toronto’s city manager, said in the release.  Since city council moved to censure the mayor last week the
average extra  interest rate  for Toronto bonds increased four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 94 basis points more
than federal government benchmarks, according to the Bank of
America Merrill Lynch Canadian Provincial & Municipal Index on
Nov. 18. The city’s average spread has fallen since then to 89
basis points more than federal benchmarks as of the end of
trading yesterday, according to the index.  “We have seen no deterioration in the City of Toronto’s
primary and secondary market interest rate spreads,” said Rob
Rossini, deputy city manager and chief financial officer.  Moody’s Investors Service rates Toronto’s debt Aa1, while
 Standard & Poor’s  gives the city a AA rating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
