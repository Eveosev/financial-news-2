Billionaire hedge-fund manager John Paulson told clients he wouldn’t personally invest more money in
his gold fund because its not clear when inflation will
accelerate, according to a person familiar with the matter.  Paulson, who has been betting that gold would rally as a
hedge against inflation as central banks flood the global
economy with money, has lost 63 percent year-to-date in the PFR
Gold Fund, said the person, who was briefed on the returns and
asked not to be identified because the information in private.
The fund, which has shrunk to $370 million, with most of that
John Paulson’s own money, fell 1.2 percent in October, the
person said.  The hedge-fund firm will maintain the fund’s positions in
gold stocks and let options related to bullion expire, Paulson
said at the firm’s annual meeting yesterday in Paulson & Co.’s
 New York  office, according to the person.  Armel Leslie , a spokesman for $19 billion Paulson & Co.
with WalekPeppercomm, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
