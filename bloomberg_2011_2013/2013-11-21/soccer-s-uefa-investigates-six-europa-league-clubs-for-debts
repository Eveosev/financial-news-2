Portugal’s Vitoria Guimaraes is
among six clubs that may face sanctions as European soccer’s
ruling body UEFA examines whether they broke so-called financial
fair play rules.  UEFA  said in a statement it will decide on the cases by the
end of the year. The rules aim to stop clubs missing payments to
players, other teams and tax authorities.  The other clubs are  Ukraine ’s Metalurh Donetsk, Latvia’s
Skonto, Slask Wroclaw of  Poland  and Romania’s Petrolul Ploiesti
and Pandurii Targu Jiu. The teams entered this season’s  second-tier Europa League  organized by UEFA.  The ruling body said it closed the cases of 25 other clubs
that it was investigating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
