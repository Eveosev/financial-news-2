West Texas Intermediate crude surged
the most in seven weeks after fewer Americans than forecast
filed claims for  unemployment benefits , bolstering optimism that
U.S. economic growth will accelerate.  Futures advanced 1.7 percent after the Labor Department
said  jobless claims  fell by 21,000 to 323,000 last week, the
fewest since Sept. 28. The  median  forecast of 47 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg called for 335,000. U.S. fuel  demand 
averaged over four weeks reached a five-year high of 20.3
million barrels a day last week, Energy Information
Administration data showed yesterday.  “Any improvement in the jobs picture is good for demand,”
said  Michael Wittner , head of oil market research at Societe
Generale SA in New York. “Yesterday’s report showed that
product consumption is rocking and rolling. This will improve
refinery margins, which will increase crude demand.”  WTI for January delivery climbed $1.59 to $95.44 a barrel
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest settlement
since Oct. 31. It was the biggest gain since Oct. 2. The volume
of all futures traded was 9.4 percent below the 100-day average.  Brent for January settlement rose $2.02, or 1.9 percent, to
close at $110.08 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. The European benchmark traded at a $14.64 premium to
WTI versus $14.21 yesterday.  The  four-week  average of jobless claims, a less-volatile
measure, decreased to 338,500 last week from 345,250 the prior
week, the Labor Department said in  Washington .  ‘Broader Market’  “The U.S. jobs number was a little bullish for the oil
market,” said Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at
Mizuho Securities USA Inc. in New York. “The improving jobs
picture is a positive sign for the broader economy as a whole.”  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.8 percent and the
 Dow Jones Industrial Average  gained 0.6 percent. The  S&P 500 
reached a record Nov. 15.  Four-week average total fuel consumption increased 2.8
percent last week, a fourth consecutive gain, according to the
EIA. Demand for distillate fuels, a category that includes
 diesel  and heating oil, jumped 6.4 percent and gasoline usage
went up 0.4 percent. The government measures shipments from
refineries, pipelines and terminals to calculate demand.  Gasoline for December delivery gained 8.08 cents, or 3
percent, to settle at $2.7438 a gallon in New York. It was the
highest close since Sept. 13. December ultra-low-sulfur diesel
rose 5.22 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $3.0067. The  crack spread ,
the profit to process three barrels of oil into two of gasoline
and one of heating oil, rose $1.36 to $22.94 a barrel based on
January contracts.  Fibonacci Retracement  Today’s advance pushed futures out of a key technical
trading range, said  Stephen Schork , president of the Schork
Group Inc. in Villanova,  Pennsylvania . Crude traded in the 50
percent to 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the increase
from $77.28 in June 2012 to the intraday high of $112.24 on Aug.
28 from Nov. 11 through yesterday. Investors typically buy
contracts when prices exceed technical resistance.  “We’ve had a precipitous drop since late August when the
Syrian tension began to ease,” Schork said. “The bears can’t
even gather interest in a further move lower.”  WTI has tumbled 15 percent since the August peak as tension
between Western powers and both Syria and  Iran  have been reduced
and U.S. crude inventories have surged.  Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif met the
European Union foreign policy chief,  Catherine Ashton , for about
two hours in Geneva, according to an EU statement. Ashton is
negotiating on behalf of the five permanent members of the
 United Nations Security Council  plus  Germany .  Geneva Talks  Envoys are trying to strike a first-step accord that would
give negotiators a six-month window in which to win a broader
agreement over Iranian nuclear work. Iran denies allegations
that its atomic research work is a cover to build weapons.  “If and when there’s an interim agreement you could see
oil come off by $5 rather quickly, in a couple of days even,”
Wittner said. “Once the news is absorbed, prices may rebound
because there will be no change to the oil fundamentals. Any
return of barrels will have to wait for a comprehensive
agreement, which will take several months.”  Iran’s oil output has decreased 16 percent since the U.S.
and the European Union tightened sanctions in July 2012 to curb
its nuclear program, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Iran,
OPEC’s second-biggest producer in June 2012, is now in sixth
place.  Draghi Comments  Oil also rose after comments by European Central Bank
President  Mario Draghi  sent the euro higher against the dollar.
Draghi said in Berlin that policy makers considered the risks of
keeping  interest rates  low for an extended period. The euro rose
as much as 0.3 percent against the U.S. currency, a move that
usually strengthens commodities.  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
January was 16.5 percent, down from 17.3 percent yesterday,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 439,834
contracts as of 2:53 p.m. It totaled 441,925 contracts
yesterday, 24 percent below the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.61 million contracts, the least since Feb. 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
