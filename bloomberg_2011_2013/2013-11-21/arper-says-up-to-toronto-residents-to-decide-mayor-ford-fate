Canadian Prime Minister  Stephen Harper  said it’s up to the people of Toronto to determine the
political future of Mayor Rob Ford after his admitted use of
 crack cocaine .  “In terms of his future in Toronto, that is for the
residents of Toronto to decide,” Harper told reporters today in
Lac-Megantic, Quebec, in remarks shown on Canadian Broadcasting
Corp. “We have ensured that we have strict laws in place and
could never support the use or purchase of illegal drugs by
anyone in political positions such as that.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
