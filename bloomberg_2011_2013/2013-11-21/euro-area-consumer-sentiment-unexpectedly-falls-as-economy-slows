Euro-area  consumer confidence 
unexpectedly declined in November, as the 17-nation currency
bloc struggled to recover from a  record-long recession .  An index of household confidence in the euro area fell to
minus 15.4 from minus 14.5 in October, the European Commission
in Brussels said in a preliminary report today. The median
forecast in a  Bloomberg News survey  of 27 economists was for an
increase to minus 14.  Euro-zone economic growth cooled in the third quarter and
the  European Central Bank   cut its main refinancing rate  to a
record-low 0.25 percent on Nov. 7, based in part on its forecast
for “continued, albeit modest, growth in the second half of the
year.”  The currency bloc’s economy  grew 0.1 percent  in the third
quarter after expanding 0.3 percent in the previous three
months. Economists in a separate Bloomberg survey saw gross
domestic product rising 0.2 percent this quarter and 0.3 percent
in the first three months of 2014.  A study by Deloitte LLP this month showed French shoppers
plan to cut their Christmas-season spending, joining Italians
and Greeks in reducing purchases as unemployment in the euro
region lingers at record highs. Economists forecast the jobless
rate will remain at 12 percent or above through 2015. Retail
sales  slipped 0.6 percent  in September from the previous month.  Still, European new car sales rose in October for a second
month for the first time since 2011. Registrations increased 4.6
percent from a year earlier to 1.04 million autos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
