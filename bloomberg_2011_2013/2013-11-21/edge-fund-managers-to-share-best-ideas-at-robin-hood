Hedge-fund managers including  David Tepper ,  Ray Dalio  and  Daniel Loeb  will help raise $5 million to
fight poverty in New York by sharing some of their best trading
ideas with attendees of the Robin Hood Foundation’s inaugural
investors conference, said the charity’s executive director.  Attendees “are going to get some of the best tips they
ever had,” David Saltzman said in an interview with Bloomberg
Television’s Stephanie Ruhle today.  Appaloosa Management LP’s Tepper, Bridgewater Associates
LP’s Dalio and Third Point LLC’s Loeb will be joined at the
conference, which starts today, by former U.S. Treasury
Secretaries Timothy Geithner, Henry Paulson and Lawrence Summers. Attendees paid $7,500 each for the chance to hear
speakers discuss financial markets and where people should
invest their money in the year ahead.  Robin Hood is a New York charity dedicated to fighting
poverty that was founded in 1988 by Tudor Investment Corp.’s
 Paul Tudor Jones . It focuses on finding, funding and creating
programs and schools for families in the city’s poorest
neighborhoods, according to its website. Bloomberg LP is a media
sponsor of the Robin Hood conference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
