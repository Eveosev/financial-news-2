Union Pacific Corp. (UNP)  rose the most in
more than a month after the largest U.S. railroad authorized a
buyback plan of as much as $9.5 billion in stock.  The four-year program, which will repurchase as many as 60
million shares, is effective Jan. 1 and replaces the current
authorization, Omaha, Nebraska-based Union Pacific said today in
a statement. The buyback is equivalent to 13 percent of the
current outstanding stock.  While  profit  has advanced at Union Pacific in every quarter
since 2010, a 28 percent gain in the shares this year trails
rivals  CSX Corp. (CSX) , Norfolk Southern Corp. and Kansas City
Southern. Last month, Union Pacific reported third-quarter
revenue that trailed analysts’ estimates.  The shares  increased  1.4 percent to $160.78 at the close in
New York. Union Pacific’s increase for the year is less than the
33 percent advance for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Railroads
Index.  Since 2007, Union Pacific has  repurchased  about 19 percent
of its outstanding shares at a total cost of almost $8.6
billion, according to the statement. The company also reported a
quarterly dividend of 79 cents a share, payable on Jan. 2, to
shareholders of record as of Dec. 3.  U.S. railroads are currently challenged with slumping
volumes of fossil fuel as utilities switch to cheaper natural
gas. Last quarter, Union Pacific said volume growth from
industrial products, automotive, and chemicals was offset by
declines in coal, agricultural products and intermodal
shipments.    To contact the reporter on this story:
