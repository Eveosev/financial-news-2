Agents from the U.S. Federal Bureau
of Investigation met with  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  trader Robert Wallden
as part of probe into alleged manipulation of currency markets,
according to a person briefed on the matter.  During a visit to Wallden’s home the agents showed him
excerpts of electronic communication that suggested he
considered himself able to manipulate the markets, said the
person, who asked not to be identified because the matter is
private. Deutsche Bank hasn’t suspended Wallden, who is based in
New York, because there is no evidence he tried to rig foreign
exchange prices, the person said.  Deutsche Bank is cooperating with regulators investigating
currency markets, it said in an e-mailed statement to Bloomberg
today. The bank, based in Frankfurt, declined further comment.
Wallden didn’t answer a call placed to his office telephone or
respond to an e-mail seeking comment. The  Department of
Justice ’s press office didn’t immediately answer two calls
seeking comment.  Bloomberg News reported in June that traders at some banks
said they shared information about their positions through
instant messages, executed their own trades before client orders
and sought to manipulate the benchmark WM/Reuters rates.  Regulators including the Department of Justice, the U.K.’s
Financial Conduct Authority and the Swiss Financial Market
Supervisory Authority are probing the $5.3 trillion-a-day
market.  The Wall Street Journal reported the FBI’s meeting with
Wallden earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
