Increased production of  Lockheed
Martin Corp.’s (LMT)  F-35 depends more on how the fighter fares in
testing than how deeply the Pentagon budget is cut, Deputy
Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said.  “The principle thing that is determining in the next
couple of years” whether to ramp up production of the Joint
Strike Fighter “is less our budget situation than it is the
maturity of the program,” Carter said in an interview.  The comments by Carter, who’s preparing to leave his post
as the Pentagon’s No. 2 civilian official on Dec. 4, reflect the
Defense Department’s continuing effort to shelter the costliest
U.S. weapons system from $500 billion in  defense spending  cuts
over a decade under the budget process called sequestration.  “Nothing’s going to be completely insulated” from planned
budget reductions, “but the Joint Strike Fighter program is in
a lot better position that it was four years ago,” Carter, who
has overseen efforts since 2009 to reduce spiraling costs of the
program, said in the Nov. 19 interview.  The current price tag for 2,443 aircraft is $391.2 billion,
a 68 percent increase from the projection in 2001, as measured
in current dollars. The number of aircraft the Pentagon plans to
buy is 409 fewer than called for originally. This year,
lawmakers, the Government Accountability Office and the
Pentagon’s test office have said the aircraft is making progress
in flight tests and in stabilizing production.  “Our industry partners came to understand that the key to
the Joint Strike Fighter was control of cost,” Carter said.
“That’s what we’ve been working on these last four years.”  Saving $48.5 Billion  The Congressional Budget Office said last week in its
annual menu of options for reducing the federal deficit that the
Pentagon could save as much as $48.5 billion in budget authority
through 2023 ending the program at the 150 already on order,
while continuing to buy  Boeing Co. (BA)  F-18E/F fighters and Lockheed
F-16s. The Pentagon’s current plan has it buying about 2,300
F-35s through 2037 in addition to about 150 on order the agency
said.  The F-35 program has political support on Capitol Hill
because it includes contractors in 45 states with 1,300
suppliers supporting 133,000 jobs, according to Bethesda,
Maryland-based Lockheed.  United Technologies Corp. (UTX) ’s Pratt &
Whitney unit makes the engines in  Connecticut .  Eight primary international partners have committed to
buying the plane, including the U.K.,  Canada  and  Australia .  The Pentagon’s current budget plans call for increasing
production to 42 of the fighters in fiscal 2015, which begins
Oct. 1, from 29 each this year and the previous year. The rate
would increase to 62 in 2016, 76 in 2017 and 100 in 2018,
according to internal Pentagon budget documents.  Carter, 59, was the Pentagon’s top weapons buyer before
taking over as deputy secretary in late 2011. He has tackled
challenges including equipping U.S. troops in Iraq and
 Afghanistan  with fortified vehicles and other equipment,
informed by visits with the troops during eight trips to
Afghanistan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
