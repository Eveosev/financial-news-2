The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will raise crude shipments through to early
December as demand for heating fuel increases with the onset of
winter in the northern hemisphere, according to tanker tracker
Oil Movements.  OPEC, which supplies about 40 percent of the world’s oil,
will bolster sailings by 400,000 barrels a day, or 1.7 percent,
to 23.93 million barrels in the four weeks to Dec. 7, the
researcher said today in a report. That compares with 23.53
million in the period to Nov. 9. The figures exclude two of
OPEC’s 12 members,  Angola  and  Ecuador .  “Refinery rates are rising again, so that will pull up
crude demand,”  Roy Mason , the company’s founder, said by phone
from Halifax, England.  Brent crude futures have slipped 1.9 percent this year,
trading near $109 a barrel today.  Middle Eastern exports will advance 2.2 percent to 17.57
million barrels a day in the month to Dec. 7, versus 17.19
million in the previous period, according to Oil Movements.
Those figures include non-OPEC nations Oman and Yemen.  Crude on board tankers will increase by 1 percent on Dec. 7
to 484.88 million barrels from 480.1 million four weeks prior,
data from Oil Movements show. The researcher calculates volumes
by tallying tanker bookings and excludes crude held on vessels
for storage.  OPEC’s members are  Algeria , Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar,  Saudi Arabia , the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela. It will next meet in Vienna on Dec. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
