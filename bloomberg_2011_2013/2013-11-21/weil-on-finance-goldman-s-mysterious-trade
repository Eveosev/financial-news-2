So you’re back for more links, huh? We Viewsters aim to please. Here’s what I’ve been reading this morning. No idea  what to make  of this Goldman Sachs trading  story  Here are the first two lines from the Wall Street Journal’s big Goldman article today: “A complex bet in the foreign-exchange market backfired on Goldman Sachs Group Inc. during the third quarter, people familiar with the matter said. The previously undisclosed trading mishap played a part in a revenue slump that prompted senior executives to defend the firm's trading strategy.” How big a part? Don’t know. The article says: “It isn't clear how large the trade was or how long it was in place.” And without knowing basic stuff like that, there’s no way to tell if there’s much of a story here. But whoever caused this purported mishap, there is no indication in the article that any of the people involved has been tagged with a memorable nickname. So by definition it can’t be considered a major trading scandal yet, because almost all the huge ones come with fun nicknames like London Whale or Mr. 5 Percent. But give it time, and maybe some reporters will turn up something.   What if the Fed’s  easy-money policies  keep going for many years?  Equities, commodities and housing prices all would rise, while the dollar would lose, writes Michael Casey in a column for Market Watch. “All this would be fine if the rising tide lifted all boats,” he writes. “But perpetually easy monetary policy will create even wider divisions within and between economies. The gap will grow between the few who benefit from financial market advances —- those who can now afford to splurge on record-setting Francis Bacon artworks -— and the many who don’t.”  Washington’s  insider-trading hysteria  gets a reality check  Here’s another head-scratcher from the Wall Street Journal. Last spring some politicians and regulators freaked out because it dawned on them that sometimes information about government decisions can move stock prices, and sometimes people figure out or get hold of that information faster than others do, especially if they’re trying to make a living trading stocks or as investment researchers. So then these same politicians and regulators decided they couldn't let such unfairness stand unchecked and that some small fry needed to be investigated over all of this. Except now they’re finally coming to the obvious realization that there probably was no illegal trading in any of the high-profile examples that first got everyone’s attention, and that insider trading by people with ties to Capitol Hill is extremely hard to prove, because that’s the nature of a free society: Before the government makes big, market-moving decisions, it’s supposed to seek outside input. And if some well-connected people get an unfair advantage along the way, well, so be it. Anyway, the gist of the Journal’s story is that these insider-trading investigations into people with Capitol Hill connections seem to be going nowhere.   The guy  who runs  Toyota  loves what ?  Jason Clenfield and Yuki Hagiwara of Bloomberg News have an excellent profile of Aiko Toyoda, the president of Toyota Motor Corp. and grandson of the company’s founder: “Toyota is on track for a record profit, its Lexus luxury unit predicts the best-ever year of sales, and industry surveys show public questions over deteriorating quality are fading. It’s a remarkable turnaround for an executive who got off to a shaky start handling one of the worst crises in Toyota’s 76-year history.” The article also says he “loves the smell of gasoline,” which I hope was only a figure of speech and isn’t literally true. Because inhaling gasoline fumes can cause some serious damage to your body.   Weird  stuff about  food , just because Thanksgiving is almost here  From Foodbeast, here’s a recipe for jalapeño espresso nog, plus an article about candles that smell like fried chicken.
