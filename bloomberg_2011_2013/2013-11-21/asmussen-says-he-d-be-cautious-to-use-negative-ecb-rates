European Central Bank Executive
Board member Joerg Asmussen said he has reservations about
lowering the deposit rate below zero.  “We studied the instrument -- it is, in theory,
available,” Asmussen said in response to questions after a
speech in  New York . “I, personally, would be very, very
cautious to use that one, but I would not exclude it.”  The ECB reduced its main refinancing rate by a quarter of a
percentage point to 0.25 percent on Nov. 7, while keeping the
overnight deposit rate for lenders who park excess cash at the
central bank at zero. Policy makers are considering a smaller-than-normal cut in the deposit rate to minus 0.1 percent if more
stimulus is needed to ward off deflation, according to two
central-bank officials with knowledge of the debate.  “Our monetary policy remains accommodative as long as
needed,” Asmussen said. “We will use, if necessary, all
instruments to ensure  price stability .”  Asmussen said he sees inflation risks as “broadly balanced
to both sides.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
