Glenn Dubin , chairman of Highbridge
Capital Management LLC, said the “super-cycle” in commodity
markets is over as demand from developing nations has declined
and supply has increased.  Prices have settled into a trading range after
“hyperbolic” market moves, Dubin said in an interview with
Bloomberg Television’s  Stephanie Ruhle  at the Robin Hood
Investors Conference in New York today. He said small investors
aren’t investing significantly in commodities.  Dubin, 56, said he is “bullish” on energy markets. He and
investors including billionaire  Paul Tudor Jones  last year
bought an energy-trading unit that was a joint venture formed by
Highbridge and Louis Dreyfus Group. The unit was renamed
Castleton Commodities International. Highbridge, a New York-based alternative asset manager that has $29 billion in assets,
is owned by  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)   Dubin said independent energy merchants are the right
business model to take advantage of market opportunities.  “Having long-term capital and being able to be an owner
and operator of both assets as well as a trading company gives
you a competitive advantage,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
