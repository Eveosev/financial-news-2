Tenaska Inc., a closely held
renewable-energy developer, closed a $319.4 million refinancing
of a solar project in  California .  The company raised the funds through the sale of senior
secured notes for the 130-megawatt Imperial Solar Energy Center
South project near El Centro, California, that began operations
earlier this month, Omaha, Nebraska-based Tenaska said today in
a statement.  The project is majority owned by a Tenaska affiliate and
Prudential Capital Group is buying a minority interest in the
project, subject to regulatory approvals, Tenaska said in the
statement. RBC Capital Markets LLC acted as an advisor on the
sale of the equity interest to Prudential.  To contact the reporter on this story:
