Electronic payments in Bangladesh
may increase 20-fold over the next five years as mobile-phone
transactions increase and the government pulls citizens into the
formal financial system,  MasterCard Inc. (MA)  said.  The annual value of electronic payments may jump to $10
billion from $500 million today, T.V. Seshadri, group executive
for global products and solutions for Asia-Pacific, the Middle
East and Africa, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television
today. The country has 100 million mobile-phone subscriptions,
compared with 5 million payment cards, he said.  MasterCard this week opened a representative office in the
South Asian country, where it works with banks. The government’s
initiatives to develop electronic payments systems echo those in
other  emerging markets  such as Nigeria and South Africa,
Seshadri said in Singapore.  “We’re seeing growth in emerging markets, where
governments are driving financial inclusion in a very
concentrated way,” he said. “Mobile may actually be the place
where payments take over in  Bangladesh . Enabling mobile payment
solutions is what we’re focused on.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
