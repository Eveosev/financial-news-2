China’s benchmark money-market rate
fell to a one-week low after the central bank added funds to the
financial system by selling 14-day reverse-repurchase contracts
for the first time in three weeks.  The People’s Bank of China injected 33 billion  yuan  ($5.4
billion) via the agreements at 4.1 percent today, according to
three traders at a primary dealer required to bid at the
auctions. That compared with an addition of 16 billion yuan when
it issued the same contracts on Oct. 31 at 4.3 percent. The
monetary authority added 35 billion yuan on Nov. 19 via seven-day reverse repos sold at 4.1 percent.  The  seven-day repurchase rate , a gauge of funding
availability in the banking system, fell 20 basis points, or 0.2
percentage point, to 4.63 percent as of 10:31 a.m. in  Shanghai ,
according to a weighted average compiled by the National
Interbank Funding Center. It dropped 82 basis points this week
from a two-week high of 5.45 percent on Nov. 15.  “The PBOC resumed the 14-day reverse-repo sales to prevent
rates from rising too much and too fast, so that it can continue
to realize the goal of maintaining a neutral to tight policy
stance,” said Zuo Junyi, an analyst at Founder Securities Co.
in Beijing. “I don’t see that will change before the first
quarter next year.”  The cost of one-year interest-rate  swaps , the fixed payment
needed to receive the floating seven-day repo rate, rose one
basis point to 4.57 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Bond Auction  The yield on the 4.08 percent government bonds due August
2023 jumped 13 basis points to 4.73 percent, according to data
from the Interbank Funding Center. That was the highest for a
 benchmark  10-year note since Bloomberg started to compile the
ChinaBond data in September 2007.  The Ministry of Finance auctioned 28.15 billion yuan of 10-year bonds yesterday at a yield of 4.71 percent, according to a
statement on  China  Central Depository & Clearing Co.’s website.
That compared with a yield of 4.14 percent at the last sales of
similar-maturity securities on Oct. 23.  “It’s no longer in China’s favor to accumulate foreign-exchange reserves” that now exceed a record $3.7 trillion, PBOC
Deputy Governor Yi Gang said yesterday. “The marginal cost of
accumulating foreign-exchange reserves has exceeded the marginal
gains.”  Under China’s current foreign-exchange settlement system,
the central bank has to purchase forex and sell the yuan,
leading to an increase in the  money supply .  A preliminary reading of a  Purchasing Managers ’ Index for
November dropped to 50.4 from a final reading of 50.9 in
October, according to a report from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics. The indicator fell short of the 50.9 median estimate
of economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
