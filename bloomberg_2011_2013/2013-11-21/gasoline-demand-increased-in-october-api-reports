U.S. gasoline demand rose in October
to the highest level for the month in three years as domestic
crude production grew, the  American Petroleum Institute  said.  Gasoline deliveries, a measure of demand, gained 2.6
percent from a year earlier to 8.93 million barrels a day, the
industry-funded API said today in a monthly report. Domestic
output exceeded 7 million barrels a day for a 12th month.  “The  United States  continues to meet more and more of its
demand with energy produced here at home,” said  John Felmy ,
chief economist at the API.  Total petroleum deliveries increased 1.3 percent from a
year earlier to 19 million barrels a day, the API said. Demand
for distillate fuels, including heating oil and diesel, rose 3.3
percent to 3.98 million.  Jet fuel use gained 1.6 percent to 1.38 million barrels a
day. Demand for all other oils, a category that includes
liquefied petroleum gas, climbed 3.4 percent to 4.5 million.  Production jumped 12 percent to 7.77 million barrels a day,
the highest level for the month in 25 years. Output in the lower
48 states gained 13 percent to 7.22 million in the lower 48
states and slid 0.2 percent to 546,000 in Alaska.  To contact the reporter on this story:
