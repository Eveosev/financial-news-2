Germany is unlikely retroactively to
extend the statute of limitations in order to prosecute
Cornelius Gurlitt, the 80-year-old who hoarded artworks for half
a century, Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger
 told Handelsblatt  newspaper.  Such an extension is “hard to imagine,” she said, urging
Gurlitt to acknowledge he has “moral as well as legal
obligations”.  About 590 of the works, which include pieces by  Max Beckmann  and  Pablo Picasso  and were found in his Munich flat in
March 2012, may have been looted from Jewish collections by the
Nazi regime, Germany’s government said Nov. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
