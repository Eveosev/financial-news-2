Brazil ’s Superior Justice Tribunal
said it may rule on a decade-old tax dispute between  Vale SA (VALE5)  and
the government on Nov. 26 before a settlement deadline.  The possible ruling date for $13.2 billion in taxes for
profits from overseas units of Vale, the largest iron-ore
exporter, was published today by the tribunal on its website.  “In our view, the November 26 settlement date throws Vale
a lifeline ahead of the government’s deadline of its tax
proposal to Vale,” Andreas Bokkenheuser, an equity analyst at
UBS AG, said by e-mail. “Needless to say, a favorable ruling
would ensure Vale materially higher bargaining power in its
future tax negotiations.”  The South American country is asking Vale, the world’s
third-largest mining company, to pay 30.5 billion reais ($13.2
billion) in taxes for 1996 to 2008, the company said April 2 in
a U.S. regulatory filing. The Rio de Janeiro-based company
expects Brazil to file additional claims for the years after
2008.  Vale’s press office declined to comment in an e-mailed
statement. The company has enough time to make a decision on the
possible tax settlement before the Nov. 29 deadline, Chief
Executive Officer Murilo Ferreira told reporters on Nov. 7.  Brazil’s Congress approved in September a regulation that
scraps fines, interest and legal charges if companies pay their
debts in one tranche and reduces taxes and interest if they pay
debt in installments.  To contact the reporters on this story:
