BrightSource Energy Inc. (BRSE) , a solar-thermal developer that withdrew plans for an initial public
offering last year, made David Ramm its permanent chief
executive officer.  Ramm had served as interim CEO since June when John Wollard
stepped down. He is also chairman, and plans to steer Oakland,
California-based BrightSource’s efforts to develop power plants
in other countries, according to a statement today.  BrightSource’s plants use arrays of  mirrors  to focus
sunlight to produce steam, driving a turbine that produces
power.  To contact the reporter on this story:
