European shares  declined as a gauge
of China manufacturing dropped more than forecast and minutes
from the  Federal Reserve ’s last meeting signaled the U.S. may
reduce stimulus in coming months.  Atos (ATO)  fell 4.1 percent after an investor cut its stake in
the company.  Intermediate Capital Group Plc (ICP)  lost 3.4 percent
after Numis Securities Ltd. lowered its rating on the  money
manager .  Allianz SE (ALV)  fell 1.3 percent after  Europe ’s biggest
insurer was  cut  to neutral at Citigroup Inc.  Johnson Matthey Plc (JMAT) 
climbed 3.8 percent after reporting a profit increase in the
first half of the year.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index lost 0.2 percent to 322.42 at
the close of trading. The gauge, which has rallied 15 percent
this year, is poised for its first weekly drop in seven weeks.  “There’s been a lack of conviction and momentum in the
European market,” Michael Ingram, a market strategist at BGC
Partners LP in  London , said by telephone. “March is still
likely in terms of the timing of a taper, but this has been a
movable feast. The data doesn’t support a taper yet.”  National benchmark indexes retreated in nine of the 18
western European markets. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 and  Germany ’s DAX
were little changed.  France ’s CAC 40 dropped 0.3 percent.  The Fed expected economic data to signal improvement in the
job market and “would thus warrant trimming the pace of
purchases in coming months,” minutes of the U.S. central bank’s
Oct. 29-30 meeting showed yesterday in  Washington .  March Meeting  As of Nov. 19, four of five investors expected the Fed to
delay a decision on the first cuts to bond buying until March
2014 or later, with 5 percent looking for a move next month,
according to the latest Bloomberg Global Poll. Only one in 20
said the central bank will begin to reduce its purchases at its
Dec. 17-18 meeting, according to the poll yesterday of
investors, traders and analysts who are Bloomberg subscribers.  Equities pared earlier declines of as much as 0.7 percent
as a report indicated fewer Americans than forecast filed claims
for jobless benefits. Unemployment claims in the week ended Nov.
16 dropped by 21,000 to 323,000, the fewest since the period
ended Sept. 28, from a revised 344,000 the previous week, the
Labor Department said today in Washington.  A  gauge of China’s manufacturing activity  declined for the
first time in four months. The preliminary 50.4 reading for the
November Purchasing Managers’ Index released today by HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics compared with a 50.8 median
estimate from analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News . Levels above
50 indicate expansion.  Euro-Area Manufacturing  In the euro-area, an index based on a survey of purchasing
managers in the manufacturing industry rose to a 29-month high
this month of 51.5 from 51.3 in October, London-based Markit
Economics said today. An index of French manufacturing PMI
unexpectedly declined to 47.8 from 49.1. Economists in a
Bloomberg survey had predicted an increase to 49.5.  “PMIs confirmed the fear that has been nagging that the
momentum in European real economies is petering out,” BGC
Partners’ Ingram said. “France in particular has returned as a
concern within the core of Europe. There is a worry that growth
isn’t coming through.”  A separate report showed that an index of household
confidence in the region fell to minus 15.4 from minus 14.5 in
October, the European Commission said in a preliminary report.
The median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of 27 economists
was for an increase to minus 14.  Atos dropped 4.1 percent to 61.70 euros for the biggest
loss since June 2012. Shareholder PAI Partners SAS is selling
8.9 million shares in the French company for 61.25 euros each.  Intermediate Capital  Intermediate Capital  lost 3.4 percent to 445 pence after it
was  cut  to hold from add at Numis, which said that half-year
results were weaker than expected. The London-based money
manager reported first-half pretax profit rose to 155.3 million
pounds ($250 million) from 39.6 million pounds in the same
period a year earlier. The company’s assets under management
shrank 6 percent to 12.1 billion euros.  Intermediate Capital and Nomura Holdings Inc. agreed to set
up a mezzanine debt fund in  Japan , citing increased demand as
the world’s third-largest economy recovers.  Allianz fell 1.3 percent to 126.85 euros. Europe’s biggest
insurer was  cut  to neutral from buy at Citigroup, which says
earnings growth is limited.  Tobacco Companies  British American Tobacco Plc (BATS)  declined 2.4 percent to 3,281
pence, and  Imperial Tobacco Group Plc (IMT)  lost 2.6 percent to 2,367
pence. Philip Morris International Inc., the world’s largest
publicly traded tobacco company, said yesterday international
cigarette volume may drop as much as 3 percent next year.  Johnson Matthey rose 3.8 percent to 3,210 pence, the
highest price since at least May 1989. The producer of a third
of all auto catalysts used to cut vehicle pollution said first-half underlying pretax  profit  climbed to 202.1 million pounds
from 180.1 million pounds a year ago. Revenue jumped to 6.41
billion pounds from 4.89 billion pounds last year.  Daily Mail & General Trust Plc (DMGT)  climbed 2.6 percent to 862.5
pence. The company said contribution from national newspapers to
