Middle-distillate inventories in
 Singapore ,  Asia ’s largest oil-trading and storage center, fell
17 percent the past week, the most in more than 19 months,
according to a unit of the Trade and Industry Ministry.  Onshore stockpiles including gasoil, or diesel, and
kerosene dropped by 1.64 million barrels to 8.21 million in the
seven days to yesterday,  International Enterprise  Singapore said
in an e-mailed statement today. That’s the steepest percentage
decline since the week ended April 25, 2012, leaving supplies at
the lowest level since Aug. 21 this year.  Residual-fuel inventories including  fuel oil  and low-sulfur
waxy residue and excluding bitumen decreased by 438,000 barrels,
or 2.1 percent, to 20.3 million, the data show. That’s the sixth
drop in seven weeks.  Stockpiles of  light distillates  including naphtha,
reformate and gasoline slid by 352,000 barrels, or 3.2 percent,
to 10.7 million, according to the data. Supplies shrank to a
three-week low.  The trade ministry unit surveys refiners, oil traders and
storage terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude
some offshore storage capacity, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
