Edcon Holdings (Pty) Ltd.,  South
Africa ’s largest clothing retailer, said second-quarter sales
rose and losses narrowed as trading at lower-price units
improved and the company introduced new international brands.  The loss was 724 million rand ($71 million) in the three
months to Sept. 28, versus a restated 2.7 billion-rand loss a
year earlier, the Johannesburg-based company said in a statement
today. Retail sales advanced 5.9 percent to 6 billion rand.  The refurbishment of 72 stores in the Edgars chain is
“almost complete, although the heavy build element of this
program still negatively affected results,” said the company,
controlled by private-equity firm Bain Capital Partners LLC. The
discount division, which includes the Jet chain, “delivered a
good sales and profitability performance,” with same-store
sales rising 4.9 percent.  Bain, based in  Boston , bought Edcon in 2007 for 25 billion
rand in an effort to tap rising consumer spending in  Africa ’s
largest economy. Edcon, which owns chains including CNA,
Boardmans and Red Square, has been revamping stores in an effort
to regain market share.  Growth in  South African (SAPO)  retail sales grew 0.2 percent in
September, the slowest pace since December 2009, as inflationary
pressures curbed spending.  To contact the reporter on this story:
