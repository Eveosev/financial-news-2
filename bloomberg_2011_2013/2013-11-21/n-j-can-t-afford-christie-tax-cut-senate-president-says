New Jersey  can’t afford the 10
percent income-tax cut said to be planned by Republican Governor
 Chris Christie  in the coming year, Democratic Senate President
Stephen Sweeney said.  Christie, 51, will make a second attempt at passing the
proposal for an across-the-board income-tax cut as part of the
agenda for his second term, according to  Robert Grady , chairman
of the New Jersey governor’s Council of Economic Advisors,
speaking yesterday at an economic seminar. Democratic lawmakers
stymied a tax cut last year.  Sweeney said legislative support for the tax reduction
would hinge on whether the state can afford it and whether the
governor agrees to restore property-tax rebates and credits for
the working poor. The income-tax cut would mean less state
funding for municipalities, forcing local governments to raise
property taxes to compensate, he said.  “At the end of the day, numbers don’t lie -- we don’t have
the money,” Sweeney said in  Atlantic City , where he spoke to a
convention of mayors sponsored by the New Jersey League of
Municipalities. “If we have have money left over after we do
these things, we can talk.”  Last year, Christie proposed the cut and later agreed to a
plan by Sweeney to reduce property taxes. Democrats refused to
release money for the cut after they said revenue growth didn’t
support the cost of the program. Sweeney said Christie is re-starting the program ahead of a potential presidential run in
2016.  To contact the reporter on this story:
