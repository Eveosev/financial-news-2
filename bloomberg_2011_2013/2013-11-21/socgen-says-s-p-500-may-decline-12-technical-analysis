U.S. stocks  may fall as much as 12
percent in the next four to five months after the  Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  surpassed 1,800 during trading hours earlier
this week, according to Societe Generale SA.  The benchmark index has reached the fifth and final stage
of the Elliott Wave Theory and may retreat to about 1,570 by
March or April, said Loic De Galzain, an equity-technical
analyst at the French bank. The method analyzes price trends in
a five-stage structure of three steps forward, two steps back.
The S&P 500 topped 1,800 on Nov. 18 for the first time ever.  “The Elliott Wave count looks more complete as the move
under way seems to be a wave five, a final wave,” De Galzain
wrote in an e-mail. “The momentum indicators are posting
negative divergences both daily and weekly while forming that
final wave five.”  The  S&P 500  rose to 1,802.33 on Nov. 18 before ending the
day down 0.4 percent at 1,791.53. The gauge of U.S. stocks has
rallied 25 percent this year through yesterday, on pace for its
biggest annual jump since 2003. It closed at an all-time high of
1,798.18 on Nov. 15.  The first warning sign of a short-term retreat will be if
the index reaches about 1,725, De Galzain said. The S&P 500
closed at about that level on Sept. 18, when it started to fall
as part of the third wave of the model. It dropped 4.1 percent
to 1,655.45 Oct. 8, the lowest level in a month.  The Elliott Wave Theory was originally developed by
accountant  Ralph Nelson Elliott  during the Great Depression. He
concluded that market swings, or waves, follow a
predictable structure. Technical analysts study charts of
trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a commodity,
currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
