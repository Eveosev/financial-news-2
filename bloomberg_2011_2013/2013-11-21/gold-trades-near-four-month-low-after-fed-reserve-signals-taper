Gold fell to the lowest since July
as investors weighed speculation that the  Federal Reserve  may
reduce monthly bond purchases in coming months.  Policy makers expect U.S. economic data will signal further
improvement in the labor market and “warrant trimming the pace
of purchases in coming months,” according to minutes of the
Fed’s October meeting released yesterday. Applications for
 unemployment benefits  in the U.S. for the week ended Nov. 16
declined to the lowest in almost two months,  the Labor
Department said today.  “The market is convinced that the Fed is ready to start
tapering,” Sterling Smith, a futures specialist at Citigroup
Inc. in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “Today’s
jobless data shows that the economy is improving, and gives
people another reason to believe gold will continue to weaken.”  Gold futures for December delivery tumbled 1.1 percent to
settle at $1,243.60 an ounce at 1:39 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York , after dropping to $1,235.80, the lowest for a most-active
contract since July 9.  Trading was 70 percent higher than the average for the past
100 days for this time of day, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Expectations that the Fed will trim its $85 billion in
monthly asset purchases pushed gold toward its first annual drop
since 2000. Prices have fallen 26 percent this year as some
investors lost faith in the precious metal as a store of value.  Gold is still heading for a significant decline in 2014,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a report yesterday outlining
investment themes for next year. Bullion may drop to $1,050 by
the end of the year, analysts including  Jeffrey Currie  wrote.  Silver futures for March delivery retreated 0.6 percent to
$19.976 an ounce on Comex, after touching $19.740, the lowest
since Aug. 8.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
January delivery fell 0.6 percent to $1,391.70 an ounce.  Palladium futures for March delivery slid 0.1 percent to
$715.60 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
