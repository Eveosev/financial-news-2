At the turn of the millennium, when I was in business school, the auto dealership business model seemed ripe for disruption.  Dell Inc.  was already doing a bang-up business building computers to order. It seemed only a matter of time before  General Motors Co.  did the same, and we could buy our cars easily over the Internet rather than having to haggle with a dealer. Ah, the optimism of youth! Ten years later, auto dealers are still very much with us. It turns out that building and selling cars is a bit more complicated than doing the same with computers. Oh, and auto dealers are extremely well connected in Congress and especially in state legislatures; they are often among the richest people in a legislator’s district, which has translated, over the years, into protective franchise laws that make it very hard for automakers to prune their dealer networks.  And yet, the dream of low, no-haggle pricing seems to be moving closer. The Internet didn’t get rid of the dealers, but it forced them to become much more competitive. Pricing is much more transparent, thanks to a wealth of Web-based information, and because dealers are now advertising. Lower your price a bit, and you’ll poach customers who in the old days might not have thought to check a dealer an hour and a half away when they had to make inquiries by phone. But they’ll happily drive that far to save a few hundred dollars. The result,  reports the Wall Street Journal , is falling profits for dealers, with some moving toward no-haggle pricing: One of the things I learned in business school is that incumbents have more ability to resist disruption than you’d think -- by regulatory and legal means, of course, but also by co-opting the disruption. Incumbents often have the complementary assets, such as marketing and sales teams, to maximize a disruptive technology’s commercial value. General Electric Co.  did not invent the CAT scan , but the technology has made the company a lot of money. Still, one of the things I learned after business school is that if the disruptive force is powerful enough, it will eventually breach even the most impressive walls that incumbents can erect. That’s a lesson the dealers seem to be learning right now.
