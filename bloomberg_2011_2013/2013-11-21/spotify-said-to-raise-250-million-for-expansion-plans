Spotify Ltd., the music streaming
service, raised $250 million in financing led by Technology
Crossover Ventures to back its expansion into new territories,
including  Japan , a person with knowledge of the terms said.  The financing also comes as Spotify is renewing agreements
with record companies, including  Vivendi SA (VIV) ’s Universal Music
Group and  Sony Corp. (6758) , said the person, who asked not to be
identified because an announcement isn’t planned. The funding
brings Spotify’s valuation to more than $4 billion, the Wall
Street Journal reported earlier today.  Spotify, based in Stockholm, is seeking to beat competitors
to new territories. The company offers a free advertising-supported service on computers and a $9.99 monthly ad-free plan
on mobile and other devices. The  website  lists over 24 million
active users and more than 6 million paying subscribers. The
closely held company, founded by Daniel Ek, operates in 32
regions including the U.S., U.K. and Hong Kong.  Ken Parks , Spotify’s chief content officer, declined to
comment, as did  Rebecca Hurst , a spokeswoman for Palo Alto,
California-based Technology Crossover Ventures.  Technology Crossover Ventures has invested in companies
including Netflix Inc., Facebook Inc., Electronic Arts Inc. and
 Groupon Inc. (GRPN) , according to the company’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
