Richard Fairbank, the chief
executive officer of  Capital One Financial Corp. (COF) , sold about $44
million in stock this month as part of a previously disclosed
plan to dispose of almost 1.5 million shares.  Fairbank sold 910,000 shares in transactions through Nov.
18, according to regulatory filings from McLean, Virginia-based
Capital One. That includes separate sales of common shares and
exercising 360,000  stock options  granted in 2003. Fairbank still
held 2.1 million shares as of Nov. 18, according to  data 
compiled by Bloomberg.  The options were granted in lieu of any base salary, cash
or long-term incentive for performance in 2004 and 2005,  Julie Rakes , a spokeswoman for Capital One, said today in an e-mailed
statement. Fairbank has held the options for “almost their
entire term,” Rakes said.  Fairbank, 63, is diversifying his personal investments, the
firm said in a May filing. The CEO was awarded $17.5 million for
2012, which included $2.19 million in deferred cash. Last year
was the first time in at least 15 years Fairbank’s compensation
wasn’t all options or stock.  Shares of Capital One increased 19 percent this year
through yesterday’s close of trading in  New York , the  fourth-worst  performer on the 24-company  KBW Bank Index (BKX) , which advanced
29 percent.  The share plan also allows Fairbank to exercise options for
566,000 shares awarded in 2004, according to the May filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
