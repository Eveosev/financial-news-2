The U.S. House will vote on
legislation to continue funding government operations and avoid
a federal shutdown should budget negotiators fail to reach an
agreement, Speaker  John Boehner  said.  The talks are being led by House Budget Chairman  Paul Ryan ,
a Wisconsin Republican who was his party’s vice presidential
nominee in 2012, and Senate Budget Chairman  Patty Murray , a
Washington state Democrat.  “I’m hopeful that Chairman Ryan and Chairman Murray can
come to some agreement on the budget,” Boehner, of Ohio, told
reporters in Washington today. If they can’t, the House “will
be prepared to move” on a temporary spending bill that would
keep the government open, he said.  The commitment, which echoes comments Ryan made yesterday,
reduces the risk of another government shutdown when federal
spending authority expires Jan. 15.  The measure would fund the federal government initially at
$988 billion, a level that would be automatically reduced to
$967 billion in January.  Boehner didn’t provide details on the length of such a
short-term funding bill, or whether the House would take it up
before or after Dec. 13, when the House is scheduled to leave
 Washington  for a several-week break.  To contact the reporter on this story:
