Richie Incognito said he postponed
an arbitration hearing scheduled for this week until after a
league probe into the  Miami Dolphins ’ bullying case is complete.  “I will cooperate fully with the ongoing investigation
with a goal of resuming my career with the Miami Dolphins at the
conclusion of this investigation,” Incognito said in a
statement released yesterday by the NFL Players Association. “I
love my teammates and hope we can put this distraction behind us
soon.”  The Dolphins began meeting three days ago with National
Football League investigators about the bullying case that’s
left the team without offensive linemen Jonathan Martin and
Incognito.  New York  attorney  Ted Wells  is leading the
independent probe of the Dolphins’ workplace conduct.  “Richie is cooperating fully with the NFL investigation”
and will meet with Wells, the Dolphins said yesterday in a
statement.  NFL Commissioner  Roger Goodell  has said there’s no time
frame for Wells, a senior partner in the law firm of Paul Weiss
Rifkind Wharton & Garrison, to complete his investigation into
Martin’s claims of harassment by teammates.  Martin left the Dolphins on Oct. 28 and Miami indefinitely
suspended Incognito a week later for conduct detrimental to the
team after an expletive-filled voice message he sent to Martin
became public.  A poll released yesterday by  Seton Hall University  showed
that 46 percent of respondents agreed with Incognito’s
suspension and 22 percent opposed it. In the poll, 53 percent of
respondents said bullying was widespread in sports, while 25
percent said it was not.  The investigation comes as the team is challenging for a
playoff berth. With a 5-5 record after a 20-16 win against the
 San Diego Chargers  on Nov. 17, Miami is among nine teams within
1 1/2 games of the final playoff spot in the American Football
Conference. The Dolphins next play Nov. 24 against the Carolina
Panthers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
