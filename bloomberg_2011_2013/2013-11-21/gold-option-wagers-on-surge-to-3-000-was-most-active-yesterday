Wagers betting that  gold prices  will
rally 141 percent in about two years were the most-traded option
in  New York  bullion yesterday.  Call options giving owners the right to buy gold at $3,000
an ounce by December 2015 traded 7,250 contracts yesterday on
the Comex in New York, more than double the amount of the next
most-active option, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Futures for
December delivery slumped 1.1 percent to $1,243.60 on the Comex
in New York today. Prices reached a record $1,923.60 in
September 2011.  Bullion has tumbled 26 percent in 2013 as signs of economic
recovery spurred speculation that the  Federal Reserve  will start
to cut its monthly bond buying, strengthening the dollar. Global
demand for the precious metal fell 21 percent in the third
quarter as investors continued to dump holdings through
exchange-traded funds and central banks slowed purchases, the
World Gold Council said.  “This looks like a trade with a bank on one side and a
very bullish investor buying a lottery ticket on the other,”
 James Cordier , founder of Optionsellers.com in Tampa, Florida,
said in a telephone interview. “It’s a big bet.”  Each option contract gives the right to buy 100 ounces of
gold.  To contact the reporters on this story:
