Barclays Plc (BARC) ’s South African unit
said its investment banking head Stephen Van Coller has been
subpoenaed to appear before a commission of inquiry.  Van Coller will appear with former Chief Financial Officer
Jacques Schindehutte next week in Cape Town at an inquiry
examining the collapse in 2011 of real-estate company  Pinnacle
Point Group Ltd. (PNG) , Business Day reported earlier, citing
Schindehutte.  “As the matter is now before the commission for
consideration, we will comment once a finding is rendered,”
Johannesburg-based Absa Capital said in an e-mailed statement
today. The investment banking unit of Barclays Africa Group Ltd.
didn’t specify the commission or give further details.  Absa was forced in 2008 to acquire stakes in Pinnacle Point
and three other companies after South African brokerage Cortex
Securities, for which Absa was the clearing bank, defaulted on
payments for the single-stock futures linked to the four shares.
Absa in 2010 agreed to sell its Pinnacle stake after taking a
931 million-rand ($92 million) writedown on the investment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
