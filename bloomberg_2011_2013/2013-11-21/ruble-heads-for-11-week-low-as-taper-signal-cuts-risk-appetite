The ruble headed for its lowest
level in 11 weeks against Bank Rossii’s target basket as the
Federal Reserve signaled it may taper U.S. monetary stimulus
“in coming months,” cutting appetite for riskier assets.  The currency slid 0.3 percent to 38.1175 against the basket
of dollars and euros by 2:04 p.m. in Moscow. That’s the weakest
level on a closing basis since Sept. 4 and fourth day of losses.
Yields on the government’s February 2027 bonds rose six basis
points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 7.87 percent.  Ruble led decliners among the eastern European currencies
monitored by Bloomberg after minutes from the Fed’s Oct. 29-30
gathering, released yesterday, showed policy makers’ readiness
to trim $85 billion in monthly bond buying if the economy
improves as anticipated. Emerging-market stocks fell for a third
day and the region’s currencies weakened.  “Foreigners are dumping the ruble after the Fed’s
minutes,” Dmitry Dorofeev, a strategist at BCS Financial Group
in Moscow, said in e-mailed comments.  The ruble depreciated 0.2 percent against the euro to
44.3310. An index of the 20 most actively-traded emerging-market
currencies declined 0.2 percent to 92.7619,  retreating for the
third day, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Russian central bank now steps in with $200 million of
daily purchases of the local currency at 37.60 rubles per basket
and increases interventions to $400 million per day at 38.60,
after the latest 5-kopek shift of the ruble trading corridor.  “The ruble is well in the central bank intervention zone,
and exporters may step up to support in coming days,” BCS
Financial’s Dorofeev said.  Russian companies are paying mineral extraction tax on Nov.
25 and corporate income tax on Nov. 28, according to the Federal
Tax Service schedule.  To contact the reporter on this story:
