A measure of  new orders  at U.K.
factories rose to the highest in almost two decades in November
and expectations for the next three months improved, the
 Confederation of British Industry  said.  The CBI’s manufacturing gauge climbed to 11 from minus 4 in
October, the highest since March 1995, it said in  London  today.
That exceeded the median estimate of 14 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey for a reading of 1. An index of output
expectations rose to 24 from 9.  The London-based business lobby raised its forecasts for
U.K.  economic growth  this month and said business investment and
trade will pick up in 2014. Bank of England Governor  Mark Carney 
said last week the recovery has “finally taken hold” as he
pledged to keep  interest rates  at a record low until
unemployment falls to at least 7 percent.  An index of export order books improved to 1 this month
from minus 12 in October and a gauge of the outlook for selling
prices for the next three months rose to 5 from minus 2. The CBI
surveyed 345 manufacturers between Oct. 24 and Nov. 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
