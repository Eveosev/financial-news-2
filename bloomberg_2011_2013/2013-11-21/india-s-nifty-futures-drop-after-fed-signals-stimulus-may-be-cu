Indian stock-index futures dropped
after minutes from the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee’s last
meeting signaled stimulus may be reduced in coming months.  SGX CNX Nifty Index futures  for November delivery lost 0.5
percent to 6,097 at 10:25 a.m. in Singapore. The underlying CNX
 Nifty (NIFTY)  Index slid 1.3 percent to 6,122.90 yesterday, the biggest
loss since Sept. 30. The S&P BSE Sensex declined 1.2 percent,
the most since Nov. 5. The Bank of  New York  Mellon India ADR
Index of U.S.-traded shares fell 1.1 percent.  The Sensex slumped in the last hour of trading as investors
closed positions before the release of the Fed minutes. The
Fed’s $85 billion monthly bond-buying program has fueled inflows
into Indian stocks. Foreign funds have purchased $17.2 billion
of the nation’s shares this year, the highest inflow after  Japan 
among 10 Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg.  International investors bought a net $155.6 million of
local shares on Nov. 19, a 31st straight day of purchases and
the longest consecutive inflow since the 35 days through Feb.
15, according to data from the market regulator.  Indian (SENSEX)  shares also dropped yesterday after the rupee
snapped a four-day gain on speculation oil importers stepped up
purchases of the dollar, countering inflows into stocks. One-month rupee forwards weakened for a second day today, losing 0.4
percent to 63.30 per dollar.  Shares of  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , owner of the world’s
largest refining complex, may be active. The company has been
fined an additional $792 million by the government for lower-than-targeted gas output from its KG-D6 block, according to a
Press Trust of India report that cited an unnamed oil ministry
official. That would take total production-shortfall penalties
imposed on Reliance to $1.8 billion.  The Sensex has gained 6.2 percent this year and trades at
13.5 times projected 12-month profits, compared with the MSCI
 Emerging Markets  Index’s 10.6 times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
