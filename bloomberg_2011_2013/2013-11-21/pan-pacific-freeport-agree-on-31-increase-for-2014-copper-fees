Pan Pacific Copper Co., Japan’s
largest smelter of the metal, said it agreed with  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX)  to a 31 percent gain in fees to turn
ore to refined metal for next year.  The companies settled on $92 a metric ton to treat
concentrate and 9.2 cents a pound to refine the metal, Atsushige
Higashimori, a spokesman at the Tokyo-based firm, said by phone
today. The rates this year were $70 a ton and 7 cents a pound,
according to Higashimori. A call to  Eric Kinneberg , a spokesman
for Phoenix-based Freeport, wasn’t answered outside of business
hours.  The agreement follows Freeport’s similar deal last week
with  Jiangxi Copper Co. (600362) , China’s biggest producer, that was
reached at the same level. Higher fees would help boost earnings
at smelters and add support to copper futures that slumped 12
percent this year in London.  “The levels that the top smelters in China and Japan have
set for next year are going to be a benchmark for others,” said
 Shinya Yamada , an analyst at Credit Suisse Securities Japan Ltd.
“The increase will help improve earnings at Japanese
smelters,” which suffer from rising power costs.  Mining companies including Melbourne-based BHP Billiton
Ltd. and Freeport are negotiating with smelters around the world
to set fees for 2014. The rates, which are deducted from the
price paid by smelters to miners for the raw material, usually
rise when mine supplies increase.  The world supply of mined copper will expand at least 4
percent annually in from 2012 to 2016, Standard Bank Plc said in
a report in October, compared with less than 1 percent in four
of the six years before 2012.  Masashi Takahashi, a spokesman at  Sumitomo Metal Mining
Co. (5713) , the nation’s second-biggest, was not immediately available
for a comment. Takuya Kitamura, a spokesman at  Mitsubishi
Materials Corp. (5711) , declined to comment on their own talks.  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange fell 0.2 percent to $6,985 a ton by 4:58 p.m. in  Tokyo .  To contact the reporter on this story:
