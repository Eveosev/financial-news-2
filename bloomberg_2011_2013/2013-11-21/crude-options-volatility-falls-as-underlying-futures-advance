The volatility of crude options fell
as West Texas Intermediate futures surged the most in seven
weeks amid optimism that U.S. economic growth will accelerate.  Implied volatility for at-the-money January options, a
measure of expected futures swings and a key gauge of value, was
16.52 percent at 4:10 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
down from 17.25 percent yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate crude for January delivery rose
$1.59 a barrel, or 1.7 percent, to settle at $95.44 a barrel on
the Nymex after fewer Americans than forecast filed claims for
 unemployment benefits .  Puts, or bets that prices will fall, accounted for 56
percent of electronic trading volume today. The most-active
options were January $90 puts, which slid 24 cents to 33 cents a
barrel with 3,068 lots trading. January $97 calls rose 32 cents
to 84 cents a barrel on volume of 2,978 contracts.  In the previous session, puts accounted for 58 percent of
the 53,181 lots traded. January $90 puts declined 5 cents to 57
cents a barrel with 1,987 contracts trading. January $99 calls
slipped 3 cents to 21 cents on volume of 1,812 lots.  Open interest yesterday was highest for June $80 puts, with
27,653 contracts. Next were January $75 puts with 27,245 lots
and December 2015 $120 calls with 25,319.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
