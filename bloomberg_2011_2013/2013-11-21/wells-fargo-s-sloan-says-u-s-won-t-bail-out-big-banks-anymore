Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  Chief Financial
Officer Tim Sloan said the idea of banks being too big to fail
is effectively over in the U.S.  The government has new tools to deal with a failing bank
that wouldn’t lead to a 2008-style bailout, Sloan said today
during an industry-sponsored panel discussion in New York. San
Francisco-based Wells Fargo is the biggest U.S. home lender.  To contact the reporter on this story:
