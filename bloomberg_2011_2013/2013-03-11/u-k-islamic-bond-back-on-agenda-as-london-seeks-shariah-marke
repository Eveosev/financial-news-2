The U.K. government is considering
reviving plans to sell Islamic bonds as part of an initiative to
boost Britain’s role as a center for Shariah-compliant
financing.  Treasury Minister Greg Clark and Sayeeda Warsi, a minister
in the foreign office, are leading a working group to raise the
profile of the  Islamic finance  industry, the Treasury said in an
e-mailed statement today. Among items discussed at today’s
inaugural meeting was the sale of Islamic bonds, said Shabir
Randeree, chairman of DCD London & Mutual Plc in London and a
member of the taskforce.  “What we will be looking at is whether a sovereign sukuk
or an infrastructure type of instrument will be more
appropriate,” Randeree said in a telephone interview from
London.  The U.K. announced plans five years ago to become the first
Western government to issue bonds compliant with Islamic law
only to disband the initiative in 2011 when the Debt Management
Office said the securities don’t “provide value for money.”
The government is renewing its push as the global market for
Islamic-compliant financing is set to double to $3 trillion by
2015, according to Standard & Poor’s.  The market for bonds that comply with Islam’s ban on
interest is expanding as borrowing costs plunge. The average
yield on sovereign sukuk tumbled 126 basis points, or 1.26
percentage points, last year to 2.65 percent, according to the
HSBC/Nasdaq Dubai Sovereign US Dollar Sukuk Index. The yield was
2.83 percent March 7, the index showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
