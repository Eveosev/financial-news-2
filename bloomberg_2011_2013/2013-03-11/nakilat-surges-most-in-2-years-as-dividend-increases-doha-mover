Qatar  Gas Transport Co. soared the
most in two years after the Doha-based exporter of gas known as
Nakilat raised its 2012 dividend.  Shares of the company that owns, operates and leases
liquefied natural gas vessels rallied 3.1 percent, the most
since March 2011, to 16.85 riyals at the close in Doha. About
2.6 million shares were traded, almost six times the three-month
daily average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
stock was the  most traded  on the benchmark QE Index, which
advanced 0.3 percent.  Nakilat, the  second-best performing stock  in Qatar this
year, said it would pay a  cash dividend  of 1 riyal a share for
2012 after it paid 0.85 riyal for 2011. The payout translates
into a “healthy” dividend yield of 6.1 percent, QNB Financial
Services estimates. That compares with 4.8 percent for  National
Shipping Co. of Saudi Arabia,  which transports freight by ship.  Nakilat “remains Qatar’s primary LNG carrier and benefits
from stable-visible revenue and cash flow” via fixed-charter
contracts with state-controlled LNG producers, Qatar Liquefied
Gas Co. and Ras Laffan Liquefied Natural Gas Co., QNB Financial
Services said in an e-mailed note today.  Nakilat posted an  8 percent drop  in 2012 profit to 765.5
million riyals ($210 million). The company is  poised to report  a
10 percent increase in 2013 profit, according to the median
estimate of three analysts on Bloomberg.  Qatar produces as much as 77 million tons a year of LNG,
making it the world’s biggest exporter of the fuel chilled for
shipment by sea. Nakilat has expanded into dry dock operations
and ship building after receiving the last of 25 wholly owned
and 29 partly owned LNG tankers. The tankers are leased under
long-term contracts to Qatargas and Rasgas.  Nakilat’s shares have gained 10 percent in 2013, compared
with a 2.2 percent gain for the  QE Index. (DSM)   Two analysts  recommend
buying Nakilat shares while two have a hold rating, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
