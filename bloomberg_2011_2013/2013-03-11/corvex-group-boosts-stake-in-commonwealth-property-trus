Corvex Management LP and Related
Cos. bought about 1.9 million shares in  CommonWealth REIT (CWH)  after
unsuccessfully challenging a stock offering by the real estate
investment trust last week.  Keith Meister’s Corvex and Related, led by Chief Executive
Officer Jeff Blau, now own 10.1 million shares, or 8.5 percent
of the Newton, Massachusetts-based REIT, according to a  filing 
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission today.  Corvex and Related projected that CommonWealth’s real
estate assets are worth about $40 a share, according to a Feb.
26 letter to the board. The “misalignment of incentives”
between the REIT and its external management has driven down the
value of the stock, the New York-based investors said. They
sought to stop the stock sale because of the dilution to
shareholders it would cause.  CommonWealth last week sold 34.5 million shares at $19
each, resulting in net proceeds of about $628 million, the REIT
said in a statement. Before the sale, Corvex and Related owned
9.8 percent of the outstanding shares.  Corvex and Related had offered to acquire the company for
$27 a share before the stock was priced and said they may seek
to replace the five-member board with independent trustees.  Joanna Rose , a spokeswoman for the investors, declined to
comment on the share purchase. Tim Bonang, a CommonWealth
spokesman, didn’t immediately return a call and e-mail seeking
comment.  CommonWealth was little changed at $22.15 at the close
today in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
