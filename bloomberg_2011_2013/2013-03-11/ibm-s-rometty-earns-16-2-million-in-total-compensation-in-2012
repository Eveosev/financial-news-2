International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM)  Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty, who took the job in
January 2012, earned $16.2 million in compensation last year,
including $9.26 million in stock awards.  The total figure was almost double the $8.3 million she
made the previous year, when she was a senior vice president in
charge of sales at IBM, the company said today in  a filing . The
pay package included $1.5 million in salary and $3.92 million in
non-stock incentive pay.  Rometty has overseen IBM during a period of profit growth,
even as sales remain sluggish. The Armonk, New York-based
company said in January that earnings would be at least $16.70 a
share in 2013, beating analysts’ estimates and sending the stock
on its biggest one-day gain in a year.  Rometty runs the ninth-largest company by market value and
has emerged as one of the best-paid female leaders in corporate
America, topping the level of  Meg Whitman  and other high-profile
CEOs. Whitman earned $15.4 million at Hewlett-Packard Co. in
2012 -- only 70 percent of her targeted compensation because the
struggling company missed its goals for the year. PepsiCo Inc.’s
Indra Nooyi, meanwhile, received $17.1 million in 2011. Her pay
for last year hasn’t been released yet.  Chairman Role  Rometty’s pay reflects a bump in incentive compensation
that took effect on Oct. 1, the day Rometty added the job of
chairman to her duties. When she took on the CEO role earlier in
the year, she became IBM’s ninth chief executive and its first
female leader, following stints in services, sales, strategy and
marketing. During her rise up the ladder, she oversaw the
integration of PricewaterhouseCoopers Consulting, helping IBM
build a staff of more than 100,000 consultants.  Even with the pay increase, Rometty earned less in 2012
than former IBM CEO  Sam Palmisano , who remained chairman until
October. He received $37.1 million in total compensation,
compared with $31.8 million in 2011, his last year as CEO. Most
of his compensation came from a $20 million stock award.  If IBM calls on Palmisano’s expertise after his retirement,
he will be paid $20,000 in in consulting fees for days he
provides more than four hours of service and $10,000 for days he
provides less, IBM said.  IBM shares  fell 0.1 percent to $210.08 today in  New York .
The stock has climbed 9.7 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
