Orange juice rose to an 11-week
high on mounting concern that dry weather will curb output in
 Florida , the world’s second-biggest citrus grower. Cocoa and
sugar also gained, while coffee and cotton declined.  Florida’s citrus belt will get drier-than-normal weather
during the next two weeks, with the best chance for light rain
expected tomorrow, Bethesda, Maryland-based Commodity Weather
Group LLC said in a report today. Last week, the U.S. Department
of Agriculture cut its estimate of orange production in Florida
by 1.8 percent because of dry conditions and citrus greening, a
crop disease.  “It is all about how much damage the dry weather will
cause before the rainy season starts in June,” Fain Shaffer,
the president of Infinity Trading Crop in Medford,  Oregon , said
in an e-mail.  Orange juice for delivery in May rallied 2.3 percent to
settle at $1.3625 a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York, after touching $1.375, the highest for a most-active
contract since Dec. 21. Prices are up 11 percent in three
sessions and 16 percent this year.  “Dryness is a factor this winter,” Jerry Neff, a branch
manager at Allendale Inc. in Bradenton, Florida, said in an e-
mail. “Even though we irrigate a lot of groves, this still
seems to be a real concern for Florida citrus growers.”  Also in New York, cocoa futures for May delivery rose 0.5
percent to $2,130 a metric ton, while raw-sugar futures for May
delivery advanced 0.4 percent to 18.82 cents a pound, the fifth
gain in six sessions.  Arabica-coffee futures for delivery in May slipped 0.2
percent to $1.4375 a pound on ICE, while cotton futures dropped
0.2 percent to 86.72 cents a pound.  To contact the reporters on this story:
