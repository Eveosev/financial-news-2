Fridfinnur Ragnar Sigurdsson, a
former executive with failed Icelandic lender Glitnir Bank hf,
was sentenced to 12 months in jail for  insider trading , the
District Court of Reykjavik  ruled  today.  The former executive was indicted for “insider trading”
for having on five separate occasions in 2008 sold a total of
1.26 million Glitnir shares for 20.1 million kronur ($159,000),
according to the prosecution.  Sigurdsson is the third former Glitnir banker to receive
jail time after the court in December sentenced Larus Welding,
the former chief executive officer, and Gudmundur Hjaltason, an
ex-director, to nine-month terms for fraud. Glitnir was the
first of Iceland’s three-biggest banks to fail in 2008,
triggering the biggest recession in six decades and sending the
krona down as much as 80 percent against the euro in the
offshore market.  Sigurdsson couldn’t be immediately reached through his
lawyer, Reimar S. Petursson.  To contact the reporter on this story:
