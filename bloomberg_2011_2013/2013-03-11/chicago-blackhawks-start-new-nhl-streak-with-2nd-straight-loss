The  Chicago Blackhawks  fell to
their second straight loss after setting a National Hockey
League record by scoring at least one point in 24 straight games
to start the regular season.  Sam Gagner scored two goals to lift the Edmonton Oilers to
a 6-5 victory yesterday at Chicago’s United Center. The
Blackhawks’ loss came two days after they were beaten 6-2 by the
Colorado Avalanche and dropped their record to 21-2-3.  Chicago had three overtime losses during its record-setting
point streak, yet hadn’t lost a game in regulation before its
current two-game skid.  “We’ve got to be careful not to get too down on ourselves,
especially after the start we’ve had,”  Patrick Kane , who had
two goals and an assist for the Blackhawks, told reporters. “We
did something really special and no one can ever take that away
from you. We’ve just got to regroup and get back to that
mentality of not wanting to lose.”  The  New York  Rangers won for the fifth time in six games
yesterday, beating the Washington Capitals 4-1, while the
 Pittsburgh Penguins  pushed their winning streak to five games
with a 6-1 rout of the New York Islanders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
