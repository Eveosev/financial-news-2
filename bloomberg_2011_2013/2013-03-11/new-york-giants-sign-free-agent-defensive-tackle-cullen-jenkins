Defensive tackle  Cullen Jenkins 
signed with the New York Giants after being cut by the
Philadelphia Eagles last month.  Jenkins, who played on the Green Bay Packers’ 2010 Super
Bowl championship team, started every game the past two National
Football League seasons for Philadelphia.  “He can play inside and outside,” coach  Tom Coughlin  said
in a team statement announcing the signing. “He’s a very
versatile player that can play in all circumstances and
situations. He’s athletic. He’s quick. He plays with good
effort.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
