Japan , which has almost no natural
energy resources of its own, will begin the world’s first
offshore drilling operation this week to extract frozen natural
gas locked under the seabed.  Japan Oil, Gas & Metals National Corp., known as JOGMEC,
and  the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and
Technology  will begin test production for methane hydrate as
soon as today in the Nankai Trough about 50 kilometers (31
miles) off the coast of the country’s main island of Honshu, the
trade and industry ministry said in a statement.  Deposits of methane hydrate, known as “ burnable ice ,”
could provide Japan with a “next-generation source of clean
energy” and may be large enough to supply the country’s natural
gas needs for about 100 years, according to JOGMEC. The
government plans to develop technology to enable commercial use
of methane hydrate by fiscal 2018, according to the agency.  The two-week trial will use a depressurization method in
which icy gas crystals are returned to gaseous form inside a
drilled hole, the trade and industry ministry said in the
statement. Japan and  Canada  used the same technology to
successfully extract gas from methane hydrate stored in
permafrost found in northern Canada in a joint project running
from 2007 to 2008, according to the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
