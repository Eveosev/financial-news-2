The cost of insuring corporate
bonds and sovereign bonds from non-payment in the Asia-Pacific
region declined, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  fell 3 basis points to 100 basis points
as of 8:55 a.m. in  Hong Kong , according to Australia & New
Zealand Banking Group Ltd. prices. The measure is set for its
lowest close since Jan. 2011, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index retreated 3 basis points to
102.3 as of 9:11 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices show. The
benchmark is falling for a ninth straight day and heading for
its lowest level since March 2011, according to CMA, which is
owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers
in the privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index dropped 3 basis points to
106 as of 11:32 a.m. in Sydney, according to Westpac Banking
Corp. prices. The gauge is on course for its lowest close since
May 2011, CMA data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
