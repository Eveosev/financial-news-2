Ridley Scott , the director of
movies including “Alien” and “Gladiator,” will produce 12
short films for the website Machinima Inc.  Scott is the latest A-list talent to move into online video
production, joining Tom Hanks, who produced a science-fiction
series last year for Yahoo.com, and Jerry Seinfeld, who starred
in webisodes on  Sony Corp.’s (SNE)  Crackle.com.  Machinima, which offers videos online for a young male
audience, is the No. 1 entertainment channel on Google Inc.’s
YouTube site, serving over 2.6 billion video views per month,
the company said yesterday in a statement.  Los Angeles-based Machinima has been financed by MK Capital
and Redpoint Ventures, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
