The U.S. Bank Tower in Los Angeles,
 California ’s tallest building, will be bought by  Overseas Union
Enterprise Ltd. (OUE)  for $367.5 million as the real estate company
seeks to expand beyond its base in Singapore.  The office property, owned by a unit of MPG Office Trust
Inc., was completed in 1989 and has a height of 1,018 feet (310
meters), OUE said today in a statement. The tower has about 1.4
million square feet (130,000 square meters) of space on 72
floors and six levels of underground parking, OUE said.  “U.S. Bank Tower is a well-positioned building that we
expect to appeal to a broad base of both local and international
office tenants operating in California,” OUE Executive Chairman
Stephen Riady said in the statement.  Downtown  Los Angeles  has undergone a decade-long revival
with developments such as the Frank Gehry-designed Walt Disney
Concert Hall on Grand Avenue, which has lured locals and
tourists into the area since opening 10 years ago. Even so,
city-center office vacancies rose to 17.8 percent in the third
quarter from 15.6 percent a year earlier, according to  Jones
Lang LaSalle Inc. (JLL)   The U.S. Bank Tower, which was blown up in the 1996 movie
“ Independence Day ,” is 56 percent occupied. It will be
succeeded as the tallest in California by a $1 billion office
and hotel complex being developed by Korean Air Lines Co. in Los
Angeles that’s due to open in 2017.  OUE will acquire the U.S. Bank Tower through Beringia
Central LLC, a wholly owned unit. The company is also buying
Maguire Gardens and a car-park facility from Library Square
Associates LLC, a unit of  MPG. (MPG)   To contact the reporter on this story:
