Odey Asset Management LLP is
betting on  Trinity Mirror Plc (TNI)  to decline after borrowing 3.26
percent of the newspaper company’s outstanding shares.  The London-based hedge fund founded by Crispin Odey
borrowed stock valued at $15.2 million, data compiled by
Bloomberg shows. Short-sellers bet that a stock will decline in
value, usually by selling shares they borrow, then buying them
back at a lower price.  Trinity Mirror, publisher of the U.K.’s Daily Mirror
newspaper, has seen its share price more than triple in the past
year after cutting editorial positions and streamlining newsroom
operations. Simon Fox, formerly head of HMV Group Plc, succeeded
Sly Bailey as chief executive officer in September.  Trinity Mirror shares were down 0.4 percent at 120.5 pence
as of 12:16 p.m. in  London , giving the company a market value of
310.5 million pounds ($462 million).  Crispin Odey  couldn’t be reached for comment today. A
spokesman for Trinity Mirror wasn’t available for comment.  News of Odey’s short-selling was previously reported in the
Sunday Times.  Trinity Mirror said in August it was “moving in the right
direction in driving profitability” and was considering when it
might pay a dividend. The last payment was in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
