Geokinetics Inc. (GEOK) , a provider of
seismic data, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in Wilmington,
 Delaware .  The  company  cited assets of $12 million and liabilities of
$351 million in the court filing.  Geokinetics, based in Houston, said in January that it
reached an agreement with holders of more than 70 percent of
secured notes, under which the noteholders would convert $300
million of debt to equity.  According to the accord, unsecured creditors would be paid
in full through confirmation of a bankruptcy reorganization plan
that was to be voted on or agreed to before the filing of a
Chapter 11 petition.  Geokinetics missed a $14.6 million interest payment due
Dec. 15 on the secured notes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
