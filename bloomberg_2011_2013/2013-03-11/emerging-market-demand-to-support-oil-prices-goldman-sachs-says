Oil prices will be supported by
emerging market demand, a lack of spare supply and improvements
in transporting U.S. output,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  said.  Relatively low oil inventories around the world, limited
spare capacity in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries and continued demand growth among emerging-market
economies will sustain the market’s current “backwardation,”
where prices for immediate and near-term delivery exceed those
for later, Goldman Sachs said in a report today.  The premium of the front-month April Brent contract over
May was at 47 cents today on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in
London. The grade has been in backwardation since July.  Goldman Sachs also forecast that a glut of crude at
Cushing, Oklahoma, the main U.S. depot for the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange, will shift to a “large deficit” in the
second quarter. Completion of refinery maintenance and new
pipeline capacity from the Permian basin to the U.S. Gulf Coast
starts will divert crude away from Cushing, the report said.  “Substantial pipeline debottlenecking in North America
during the second quarter is expected to support second and
third quarter West Texas Intermediate prices,” the Goldman
Sachs analysts said.  As a result of these changes, Goldman Sachs predicted a
three-month return of 6 percent for petroleum investments, and
said the price spread between Brent and WTI will narrow
substantially to average $7.50 a barrel this year. Brent was at
a $18.44 a barrel  premium  to WTI today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
