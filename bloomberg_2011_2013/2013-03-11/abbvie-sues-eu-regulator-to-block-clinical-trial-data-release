AbbVie Inc. (ABBV) , the drugmaker that was
split off from  Abbott Laboratories (ABT)  at the start of this year,
and biotechnology company  InterMune Inc. (ITMN)  sued the European
Union’s pharmaceuticals regulator in a bid to block publication
of clinical-trial data.  AbbVie filed two lawsuits against  the European Medicines
Agency  at the  European Union General Court  in Luxembourg
“seeking to protect AbbVie’s confidential and commercially
sensitive information,” the company said in an e-mailed
statement today. InterMune said it’s challenging a separate EMA
decision to let a competitor see information concerning its
Esbriet lung remedy.  The EU regulator promised in 2010 to bolster its
transparency by disclosing -- on demand -- clinical trial data
for every drug reviewed. Drug safety activists pressed for the
move amid concerns over suicide risks linked to  Sanofi (SAN) ’s failed
diet pill Acomplia.  AbbVie, based in North Chicago,  Illinois , said while it
supports transparency of clinical research and safety
information “for the benefit of patients and healthcare
professionals,” it opposes the publication of information
“that does not meaningfully contribute to the scientific review
or evaluation of our products.”  ‘Commercially Confidential’  Jim Goff, a spokesman for InterMune, said the Brisbane,
California-based company is challenging the EMA’s decision “to
disclose to a competitor parts of documents” in its application
for a marketing authorization for Esbriet. “We consider this
information to be commercially confidential.”  Esbriet is a treatment for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,
or IPF, a rare disease that causes unexplained scarring in the
lungs and makes it hard for patients to breathe.  While the company agrees that “as much information about
medicinal products as practicable” should be given to the
public, the disclosure of certain data could harm a company’s
commercial interests, Goff said.  The EMA will “await the outcome” of the cases, Monika Benstetter, a spokeswoman for the London-based regulator, said
in an interview. “At the moment we continue with our policies
until the court rules otherwise.”  An advisory group is expected to present a plan to the EU
agency in April about how to publish clinical trial data and a
policy should be drafted by mid-year, she said.  The AbbVie lawsuits were filed in January and Brisbane,
California-based InterMune’s case was filed in February,
according to the EU court’s website.  The Financial Times reported earlier that AbbVie was suing
the EMA.  The cases are: T-29/13 Pending Case, AbbVie v. EMA, T-44/13
Pending Case, AbbVie v. EMA, T-73/13 Pending Case, InterMune UK
and others v. EMA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
