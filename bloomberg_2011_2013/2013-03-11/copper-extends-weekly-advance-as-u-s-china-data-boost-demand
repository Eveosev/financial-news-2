Copper extended a weekly gain as
better-than-expected U.S. jobs data and  China ’s fixed-asset
investment helped boost demand from the two largest users. Zinc
also advanced.  Copper for delivery in three months rose as much as 0.4
percent to $7,768 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange,
before trading at $7,764 by 10:43 a.m. Shanghai time. The metal
climbed 0.5 percent last week, the first gain in four weeks. The
contract for June delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange was
little changed at 56,740  yuan  ($9,119) a ton.  U.S. employment rose 236,000 last month, exceeding a median
forecast of 165,000 by 90 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.
The jobless rate dropped to 7.7 percent, the lowest since
December 2008. In China, fixed-asset investment increased by
higher-than-estimated 21.2 percent in January and February.  “The data are positive to prices,” Cheng Xiaoyong, an
analyst at Baocheng Futures Co., said by phone from Hangzhou.
“Looking ahead, if inflation worsens and property continues to
climb, any tightening measures would be negative to metals.”  Futures for delivery in May on the Comex in  New York  rose
0.3 percent to $3.519 per pound. Net-short  positions , or wagers
on falling prices, held by funds gained to 16,391 futures and
options contracts as of March 5 from 7,172 a week earlier,
according to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  On the LME, aluminum, nickel and tin declined.  To contact  Bloomberg News  staff for this story:
