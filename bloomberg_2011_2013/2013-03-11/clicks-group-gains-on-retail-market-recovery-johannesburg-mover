Clicks Group Ltd. (CLS) , a South African
beauty and pharmaceutical retailer, climbed the most in almost
seven months as food and drug retailers continued to recover
from an early-year slump driven by slower consumer spending.  Shares (BAW)  in the Cape Town-based company climbed as much as
6.4 percent to 62.79 rand, the biggest intraday gain since
August, and were 5.4 percent higher at 4.20 p.m. in
Johannesburg. The four-member  FTSE/JSE Africa Food & Drug
Retailers Index (JFDRT)  added 0.6 percent, after climbing 2.6 percent
last week.  “The retailers were smacked too hard and we’re seeing them
coming back,”  Ferdi Heyneke , a trader at Afrifocus Securities
Ltd., said by phone today. “Clicks didn’t rise in line with the
likes of Shoprite and Spar last week and is catching up.”  Shoprite Holdings Ltd. rose 3.3 percent last week, while
 Spar Group Ltd. (SPP)  climbed 4.1 percent.  South African retailers suffered share price declines
earlier this year after trading updates showed slower sales
growth amid rising unemployment and lower consumer spending.  To contact the reporter on this story:
