China  should accelerate opening
commodities futures to overseas investors and detail regulations
allowing domestic firms to trade raw materials contracts on
bourses abroad, Shanghai Futures Exchange Chairman Yang Maijun
said in proposals to the National People’s Congress.  Government agencies including foreign exchange regulators
and the tax bureau should use preparations already under way for
crude oil futures trading to prepare similar policies allowing
foreign investors to trade base metals, precious metals and
natural rubber futures, Yang said, according to an e-mail from
the exchange today.  Yang, a delegate to the annual congress, which began in
Beijing last week, also suggested institutional and individual
investors from abroad should enjoy preferential tax rates,
according to the statement.  China introduced a Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor
program in 2002, allocating quotas to non-Chinese funds that
were initially restricted to trading stocks and bonds listed on
exchanges. In July 2012, China allowed entry into the  interbank
market , which hosts 99 percent of the nation’s debt.  The SHFE is facing rising competition from the Hong Kong
Exchanges & Clearing Ltd., which bought the London Metal
Exchange last year and has plans to boost the LME’s activities
in  Asia .  Chinese companies are disadvantaged because they don’t have
legitimate channels to access overseas commodities futures
markets to hedge, today’s statement cited Yang as saying.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
