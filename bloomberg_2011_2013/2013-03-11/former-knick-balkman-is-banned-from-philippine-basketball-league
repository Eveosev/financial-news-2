Former  New York  Knicks first-round
draft pick Renaldo Balkman has been banned from the Philippine
Basketball Association after bumping a referee and choking a
teammate on court.  The 28-year-old forward also was fined 250,000 pesos
($6,150) for his actions in a game last week against the Alaska
Aces, PBA Commissioner Chito Salud said today in a  statement  on
the league website.  The 20th pick in the 2006 National Basketball Association
Draft, Balkman signed with the Petron Blaze Boosters this season
after a six-year NBA career in which he never averaged more than
five points a game.  Balkman displayed “a blatant and utter disrespect for the
game, his own ballclub, the league, the fans and his host
country,” Salud said.  Balkman verbally confronted a referee in the fourth quarter
against the Aces after he believed he was fouled. He received a
technical foul after bumping the referee, and shoved multiple
teammates who tried to restrain him, choking one of them.  Balkman apologized on his Twitter account for his actions,
calling his resulting punishment a “lesson learned.”  “I accept all responsibilities for my actions while
playing an intense game,” he said. “I have truly enjoyed my
time here playing in the  Philippines .”  Salud said Balkman, a native of New York’s  Staten Island ,
head-butted an opponent during an International Basketball
Federation game in 2011 while playing for  Puerto Rico , and was
involved in an altercation with the Aces’ bench during a
preseason game in Cebu City this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
