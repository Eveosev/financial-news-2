U.K. business confidence rose in
February, according to an Optimism Index released today by
accountants BDO LLP.  BDO’s Optimism Index, which predicts business performance
two quarters ahead, stood at 90.6 in February from 88.9 in
January, which was a 21-year low. It remains below the 95.0 mark
that indicates growth. The Index has been below that threshold
since May 2012.  Despite this increase in confidence, businesses still do
not anticipate growth in the next two quarters, BDO said.  An increase in the BDO Inflation Index, to 101.5 from 100.4
in January, points to further pressure on businesses’ bottom
lines, BDO said in an e-mailed statement.  BDO’s Output Index, which predicts short-run sales
expectations, declined to 92.1 in February from 92.3 the month
before, further away from the 95.0 mark.  The surveys cover 4,000 different respondents from U.K.
companies employing about 5 million people. BDO didn’t specify
when the survey was conducted.  -- Editor: Dick Schumacher  To contact the reporters on this story:
