 Zynga Inc., the biggest maker of
online social games, climbed to the highest price since July on
speculation that Yahoo! Inc. might consider buying the company.  The shares rose 10 percent to $3.91 at the close in New
York. The stock has advanced 67 percent this year, compared with
a 9.4 percent gain for the Russell 1000 Index.  Yahoo may consider buying Zynga as Chief Executive Officer
 Marissa Mayer  seeks acquisitions to bolster the U.S. Web
portalâ€™s mobile and social capabilities, Blake Harper, an
analyst at Wunderlich Securities Inc., wrote in a research
report today. Since Mayer arrived, Yahoo has ceded share in its
core business of display advertising amid mounting competition
from Google Inc. and Facebook Inc.  With a market value of about $3 billion, Zynga might be an
attractive target if Mayer opts for deals valued at more than $1
billion, Harper said. Yahoo might also look at purchasing food-
review sites  Yelp Inc. (YELP)  and  OpenTable Inc. (OPEN) , or  Millennial Media
Inc. (MM) , which offers mobile advertising, Harper said.  Representatives from Sunnyvale, California-based Yahoo and
Zynga, based in San Francisco, declined to comment. Yelp,
OpenTable and Millennial Media also declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
