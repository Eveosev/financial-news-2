West Corp. (WSTC) , the operator of  call
centers  and phone services that was taken private by Thomas H.
Lee Partners LP and Quadrangle Group LLC in 2006, is planning a
$500 million initial public offering to pay down its debt.  The offering, managed by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
Morgan Stanley, will include 21.3 million shares at a price of
$22 to $25 each, according to a  filing  today. The underwriters
will have the option to purchase 3.2 million additional shares,
the company said. Omaha, Nebraska-based West Corp. will use the
proceeds to pay $450 million in senior notes due in 2016.  The move would mark a return to public markets for the
company, which counts  AT&T Inc. (T)  as its largest customer. Lee and
Quadrangle, two buyout firms, led the acquisition of West for
about $4 billion, including debt, almost seven years ago. Its
services include telemarketing, automated customer-call routing,
conference-call hosting, alerts and emergency-call services.  West Corp., founded in 1986, reported a 5.9 percent gain in
revenue to $2.64 billion last year. Net income dipped 1.6
percent to $125.5 million. The company has $179.1 million in
cash and about $4 billion in debt as of Dec. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
