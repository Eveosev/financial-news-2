Customs officials seized 26,000
diamonds from a Russian citizen who arrived at Moscow’s
Sheremetyevo International Airport from Dubai with the gems in
his hand luggage.  Officials also found 249 boxes for iPhone 5 telephones as
well as five of the actual devices in the luggage, the Federal
Customs Service said in a  statement  on its website today. The
person, who wasn’t identified, attempted to take the diamonds,
of various sizes and colors, through the airport’s “green
zone” for passengers with no goods to declare.  “The citizen says the precious gems and goods don’t belong
to him, and that an acquaintance asked him to transport them,”
the Moscow-based service said in the statement. The goods were
sent for analysis and authorities are deciding whether to open a
criminal investigation, the service said.  Russia requires that people bringing goods worth more than
10,000 euros ($13,000) declare them in writing and pay customs
fees, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
