Economic growth in the six-nation
Gulf Cooperation Council is set to slow to about 3.5 percent
this year from 5.7 percent in 2012, Moody’s Investors Service
said in a report today.  High  oil prices  and expansionary fiscal policies will not
provide as much of a boost to growth in the GCC, which includes
the U.A.E,  Kuwait ,  Qatar ,  Saudi Arabia , Bahrain and Oman and
supplies about a quarter of the world’s crude oil, Moody’s said.  GCC governments are likely to continue recording large
fiscal and current account surpluses, according to the report.
GCC country ratings have been stable since the global financial
crisis and during the Arab Spring, and any vulnerability to a
fall in oil prices is offset by assets held by sovereign wealth
funds, Moody’s said. Exceptions are Oman and Bahrain, it said.  The average economic growth rate among non-oil-importing
countries in the  Middle East  and North Africa will be about 2.6
percent this year versus 2.2 percent in 2012, Moody’s said. Its
baseline scenario assumes oil prices will average $112 a barrel
in 2013.  In a Feb. 27 report, the Centre for Economics and Business
Research Ltd. said it expected GCC growth to ease to 4.8 percent
from 6 percent in 2012. That compares with a growth forecast of
3.9 percent for the entire Middle East this year, the London-
based group said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
