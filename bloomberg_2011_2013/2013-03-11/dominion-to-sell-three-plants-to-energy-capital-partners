Dominion Resources Inc. (D)  agreed to
sell three  power plants  to funds controlled by private-equity
firm Energy Capital Partners. Terms of the deal weren’t
disclosed.  Dominion will sell the 1,528-megawatt Brayton Point plant
in Somerset, Massachusetts; the 1,158-megawatt Kincaid plant in
Illinois; and its 50 percent stake in the 1,424-megawatt Elwood
plant outside Chicago, the Richmond, Virginia-based company said
in a statement today. The company expects to get proceeds of
about $650 million from the sale, including cash tax benefits.  The plants burn coal, natural gas or oil, and the sale is
expected to close in the second quarter, Dominion said. The sale
is part of Dominion’s stated intention to exit the merchant
coal-fired generation business. It will use the money to invest
in regulated units and reduce debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
