Sucden Financial Ltd. said Kevin Watkins, a senior commodities broker, left the company after
being hired about a year ago to develop its coffee business.  Watkins left last month, Robert Cantle, a spokesman for
London-based Sucden, said today in an e-mailed response to
questions by Bloomberg News, without commenting further.  Watkins was hired to “build a greater presence in the
coffee market” and started at Sucden in February 2012, the
broker said in a statement dated Feb. 23 of last year. He was
previously at UBS AG, the largest Swiss bank, managing a desk
covering sales and trading aspects of exchange-traded
derivatives products.  Arabica coffee fell 37 percent last year, the most in more
than a decade, in  New York  trading. That was the biggest drop in
the Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24 raw materials.  To contact the reporter on this story:
