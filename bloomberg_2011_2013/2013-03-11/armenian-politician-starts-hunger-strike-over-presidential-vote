The runner-up in last month’s
Armenian presidential election declared a hunger strike, vowing
to press President Serzh Sargsyan to annul the vote outcome.  Raffi Hovhannisyan, who lost by more than 20 percentage
points in the Feb. 18 vote, is staging the hunger strike on
Yerevan’s Liberty Square, where a presidential inauguration is
set to take place on April 9. Speaking after a rally last night
in the Armenian capital, he said the protest is the only way to
force the president to concede defeat.  Sargsyan, who is leaving for Moscow today on his first
official trip after winning re-election to a second five-year
term, invited Hovhannisyan through a chief of staff to discuss
his concerns. Hovhannisyan will only meet the president at
Liberty Square, said his spokesman, Hovsep Khurshudyan.  The country’s  Constitutional Court  today began
deliberations over cases filed by Hovhannisyan and a fellow
presidential contender, Andrias Ghukasyan, seeking to invalidate
the election’s outcome. Ghukasyan carried out a hunger strike
for about a month until the vote was held.  Eight candidates competed for the presidency, the sixth
time the former Soviet republic elected a leader since
independence in 1991. Sargsyan won 59 percent of the vote,
according to official results.  To contact the reporter on this story:
