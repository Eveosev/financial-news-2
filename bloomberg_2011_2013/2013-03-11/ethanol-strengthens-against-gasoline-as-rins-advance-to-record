Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
narrowed to the lowest in more than a week as the motor fuel
plunged and as the value of renewable identification numbers, or
RINs, for biofuel blending was near a record.  The spread contracted 8.31 cents to 60.84 cents a gallon as
production costs reduced  output  to the least for this time of
year in records going back to 2010. Prices for corn-ethanol-
based RINs climbed fell to $1.01, from a record $1.06 on March
8. Refiners use the certificates to comply with government
renewable-fuel mandates in lieu of blending.  “We’re certainly seeing a lot of activity in RINs,” said
Michael Slider, director of business development at Elgin, Iowa-
based Fauser Energy Resources. “With production off, people are
grabbing RINs to meet their requirements.”  Denatured ethanol for April delivery rose 3.2 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $2.544 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
highest price since Sept. 4. Prices have gained 16 percent this
year.  Gasoline futures for April delivery slumped 5.11 cents, or
1.6 percent, to $3.1524 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is
made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to filling
stations.  Blend Wall  The surging RIN prices probably will be a “a wash” for
most refiners as the costs are passed through to the crack
spread, or the premium of the fuel over crude,  Doug Leggate , an
analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said in a note to
clients today.  Slider said lackluster gasoline demand and rising ethanol
consumption targets, a phenomenon known as the blend wall, is
causing the surge in RIN prices.  “With fuel demand off they’re hitting the blend wall,” he
said.  The value of Advanced RINs, which include biodiesel and
Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol, was unchanged at a record
$1.08.  Ethanol  production  dropped 16 percent to 805,000 barrels a
day, or 12.3 billion gallons on an annualized basis, in the week
ended March 1 from a record 963,000 barrels a day in December
2011, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information
Administration, the statistical arm of the Energy Department.  Corn for March delivery added 9.25 cents, or 1.3 percent,
to $7.345 a bushel in  Chicago . One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol. The May contract climbed by 7.75 cents to
$7.1125 a bushel.  Crush Spread  The corn crush spread, representing gains or losses from
turning corn into ethanol and based on May contracts, was minus
8 cents a gallon, unchanged from March 8. The amount doesn’t
include revenue from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a
byproduct of ethanol production, which can be fed to livestock.  Stockpiles of the fuel in the week ended March 1 fell to
19.4 million barrels, the lowest level since November 30, EIA
data show.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up 94 percent of the total
U.S. gasoline pool, up from 88 percent the previous week and the
highest in five months, the Energy Department’s analytical arm
said in the March 6 report.  Producers of the fuel didn’t have to contend with  imports 
for the first time since Feb. 1, EIA said.  Spot ethanol in Sao Paulo  was $2.42 a gallon last week,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  In cash market trading, ethanol surged in the major U.S.
trading hubs, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf jumped 15 cents to $2.67 a gallon;
in Chicago the additive increased 14.25 cents to $2.6025; in New
York the biofuel climbed 9.5 cents to $2.675; and on the West
Coast, the most expensive trading point, ethanol added 9.5 cents
to $2.86 a gallon.  West Coast ethanol’s premium to the Gulf narrowed 5.5 cents
to 19 cents, while Chicago’s discount to  New York  narrowed 4.75
cent to 7.25 cents, the lowest since Jan. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
