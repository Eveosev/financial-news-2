Hog futures fell for the first time
in three sessions as the lowest wholesale-pork prices since
September in the U.S. signaled slowing demand for the meat.
Cattle prices gained.  Pork fell to 78.16 cents a pound on March 8, the lowest
since Sept. 21, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show. Russia
last month banned imports of U.S. pork and beef because some may
contain the feed additive ractopamine. A foot of snow fell on
 Boston  last week, and storms in the past six months, including
 Hurricane Sandy  in October, have kept consumers out of grocery
stores and from grilling outside, said Lawrence Kane, a market
advisor at Stewart-Peterson Group.  “There have been a number of things that have hurt the
meat markets this year,” Kane said by telephone from Elmwood,
 Illinois . “We have the Russian issue and the weather has not
been good for the consumer in New England.”  Hog futures for April settlement fell 1.2 percent to 81.025
cents a pound at 10:35 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
The price through March 8 declined 4.3 percent this year.  Cattle futures for April delivery rose 0.5 percent to
$1.28225 a pound on the CME, the first increase in five
sessions. Feeder-cattle futures for May settlement climbed 0.2
percent to $1.44175 a pound in  Chicago .  To contact the reporter on this story:
