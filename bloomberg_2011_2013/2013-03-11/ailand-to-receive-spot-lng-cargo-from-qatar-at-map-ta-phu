Thailand ’s state-owned  PTT Pcl (PTT) ,
 Southeast Asia ’s only importer of liquefied natural gas, will
receive a spot cargo from Qatar at the Map Ta Phut terminal,
according to ship-tracking data.  The Al Gharrafa, with a capacity of 216,200 cubic meters,
will arrive at Map Ta Phut in central Thailand today, according
to ship transmissions captured by  IHS Inc. (IHS)  on Bloomberg. The
vessel loaded its cargo at Qatargas’ LNG terminal at Ras Laffan
and departed Feb. 26.  Terdkiat Prommo, PTT’s vice-president of LNG supply in
Bangkok, didn’t respond to a call to his office number or an e-
mail seeking comment.  “We don’t have this kind of information,” Christopher
Evans, a Doha-based Qatargas spokesman, said in an e-mailed
statement.  PTT owns and operates the 5 million metric ton-a-year Map
Ta Phut terminal in Rayong that began operating in the third
quarter of 2011. It signed its first long-term contract with
Qatargas in December 2012 for 2 million tons of LNG annually for
20 years starting in 2015, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
