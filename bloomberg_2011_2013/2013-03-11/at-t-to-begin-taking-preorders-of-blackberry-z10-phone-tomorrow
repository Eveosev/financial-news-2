AT&T Inc. (T) , the second-largest U.S.
wireless carrier, will begin taking consumers’ orders for
BlackBerry’s new flagship Z10 phone tomorrow, ahead of the
device going on sale March 22.  The Z10 will sell for $199.99 with a two-year agreement,
Dallas-based AT&T said today in a statement. It is the first
phone to run BlackBerry’s new BB10 operating system, the
linchpin of the Canadian smartphone company’s comeback bid.  The U.S. rollout of the Z10 trails its debut in other
countries, a delay that BlackBerry has attributed to a lengthier
testing process by American carriers. With the new phone,
BlackBerry and AT&T are looking to entice customers into
ditching the physical keyboard that was once BlackBerry’s
hallmark in favor of a touch-screen interface.  “Customers who have grown to love the tried and true
BlackBerry experience will continue to enjoy the easy typing and
the secure platform they expect with a fresh platform that lets
them get more out of their smartphone,” Jeff Bradley, a senior
vice president at AT&T, said in the statement.  Shares of BlackBerry, formerly known as  Research In Motion
Ltd. (BB) , rose 14 percent to $14.90 at the close in New York, the
biggest gain since Feb. 4. The stock has climbed 26 percent this
year.  T-Mobile USA Inc., the fourth-largest U.S. carrier, began
taking its own Z10 preorders today for business customers. The
first devices will be received by those users as early as this
week, T-Mobile said in an e-mailed statement. The Z10 will be
widely available to consumers by the end of the month, the
company said.  In its statement, AT&T didn’t mention the timing of the
release of the Q10, a model with a physical keyboard designed to
appeal to BlackBerry’s user base. Although BlackBerry Chief
Executive Officer Thorsten Heins said in February that the Q10
will go on sale “around the April-May time frame,” the company
has yet to give specific dates for its release in any country.  To contact the reporters on this story:
