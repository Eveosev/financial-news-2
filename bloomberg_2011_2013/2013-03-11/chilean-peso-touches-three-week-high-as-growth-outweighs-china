Chile’s peso touched a three-week
high as expectations for local economic growth outweighed lower-
than-forecast Chinese industrial production.  The peso appreciated as much as 0.1 percent to 471.05 per
U.S. dollar, the strongest since Feb. 18. It was trading little
changed at 11:10 a.m. in Santiago.  The peso opened lower after Chinese industrial output and
retail sales data trailed economists’ projections, showing the
slowest start to the year since 2009. China is the biggest buyer
of copper, which made up 54 percent of Chile’s exports last
month.  “Despite the negative data, we still have a positive
outlook for Asian economies and local fundamentals are still
favorable,” said Sebastian Senzacqua, an economist at Bice
Inversiones in Santiago. “That tends to benefit the exchange
rate.”  Chilean  economic activity  expanded 6.7 percent in the 12
months through January and unemployment fell to 6.0 percent, the
lowest recorded under the current methodology. President
Sebastian Pinera yesterday announced a plan to pay one-time
bonuses in March to 2 million families totaling $200 million.
Chile will hold presidential elections later this year.  Volatility in the currency fell to new lows. Thirty-day
volatility was the lowest since June 1998 and 90-day volatility
in the peso was the lowest since July 2007, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency has traded between 471 and
476 per dollar for the last three weeks and has held between 469
and 476 per dollar since Jan. 16.  “We’re still stuck in the same range,” said Cristian
Donoso, a currency trader at Banchile Corredores de Bolsa SA in
Santiago. “Why doesn’t it appreciate more? Because of the
phantom. Part of the market believes the central bank will
intervene below 470.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
