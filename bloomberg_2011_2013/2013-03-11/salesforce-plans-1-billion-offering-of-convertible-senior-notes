  Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM) , the largest
maker of online customer-management software, plans to offer $1
billion in convertible senior notes in a private placement to
institutional investors.  A portion of proceeds from the notes, due in 2018, will be
used for acquisitions, investments in technology and capital
expenditures, the San Francisco-based company said today in a
statement.  Chief Executive Officer  Marc Benioff  is expanding into
tools for human resources and online marketing, paying $689
million last year for Buddy Media Inc., whose software helps
companies place advertisements on Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc.
Benioff has said heâ€™ll keep using deals to help accelerate
growth by  pushing beyond  cloud-computing software for sales
management.  To contact the reporter on this story:
