Canadian  stocks  rose to a 19-month
high, erasing losses from earlier in the day, as energy
companies rallied and BlackBerry surged on takeover speculation.  BlackBerry jumped 14 percent, the most in five weeks, after
a report said Lenovo Group Ltd. might consider buying the
smartphone maker. Pengrowth Energy Corp. rallied 5.4 percent as
it closed an asset sale. Nevsun Resources Ltd. plunged 10
percent ahead of the company’s removal from an exchange-traded
fund of gold-mining stocks.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  rose 22.88
points, or 0.2 percent, to 12,858.49 at 4 p.m. in Toronto, its
highest closing level since July 2011. The benchmark equity
gauge fell as much as 0.2 percent earlier in the day, after
Chinese production data missed estimates. Trading volume was 19
percent lower than the 30-day average.  “There’s some thinking that energy stocks in  Canada  were
oversold, and we’re seeing a bit of that following through
today,”  Robert McWhirter , president of Selective Asset
Management Inc., said on the phone from Toronto.  Energy shares contributed most to gains in the S&P/TSX, as
six of 10 groups advanced. Petrominerales Ltd. added 4.7 percent
to C$6.70. Pengrowth Energy gained 5.4 percent to C$5.50. The
company said it will repay all outstanding bank debt after
completing the sale of a non-core asset for C$316 million.  Oil Rises  Oil rose 11 cents to $92.06, the highest settlement since
Feb. 27. Crude fell as much as 1.2 percent earlier in the day
after  China  industrial output and retail sales grew in the first
two months of the year at slower-than-forecast rates. China is a
major consumer of Canadian resources.  “We had some mildly negative numbers out of China, nothing
too bad,” said  David Cockfield ,  fund manager  with Northland
Wealth Management. The firm manages C$225 million ($219
million).  Technology stocks climbed 4.1 percent as a group, the
biggest daily jump since Jan. 11. BlackBerry, formerly known as
Research In Motion Ltd., surged 14 percent to C$15.29 for its
largest advance since Feb. 4. Lenovo Chief Executive Officer
 Yang Yuanqing  told a French financial newspaper that a deal with
the smartphone maker “could possibly make sense, but first I
need to analyze the market and understand what exactly the
importance of this company is.”  AT&T Inc. said it will begin taking orders for BlackBerry’s
new Z10 device tomorrow. The phone will go on sale in the U.S.
on March 22.  Index Changes  Petrobank Energy & Resources Ltd. dropped 4.4 percent to 65
Canadian cents after S&P said the stock will be removed from the
benchmark Canadian equity gauge starting on March 18. Colossus
Minerals Inc. and Nordion Inc. will also be pulled. Colossus
rose 1.2 percent to C$2.47, and Nordion slid 3.9 percent to
C$6.87.  Element Financial Corp. is the only company that will be
added to the measure. Its shares rose 1 percent to C$8.89.  Nevsun Resources slumped 10 percent to C$3.62 after Market
Vectors said it plans to remove the stock from the  Market
Vectors Global Junior Gold Miners ETF. (GDXJ)  The company is
transitioning to copper production this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
