Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Development
Co. is interested in investing in  Vale SA (VALE5) ’s halted $5.9 billion
potash project in  Argentina , according to a provincial official.  “We have offered Vale strategic partners interested in
bringing in money,” Carlos Molina, head of mining for Mendoza
province, said in a telephone interview today. “Mubadala is one
and a Canadian-Australian company is another.”  The two companies are considering entering the project even
if Rio de Janeiro-based Vale decides to exit in a board meeting
scheduled for today, Molina said. Vale is seeking tax breaks and
partners to help make the Rio Colorado project more profitable.
He didn’t identify the Canadian-Australian company.  Vale dropped 1.2 percent to 34.31 reais at 11:55 a.m. in
Sao Paulo. The press departments of Vale and government-owned
Mubadala didn’t immediately respond to e-mailed requests for
comment on prospects for investing in the project.  Work at Rio Colorado was suspended indefinitely in January
so Vale could reassess the project, which has become more costly
because of inflation and exchange rate fluctuations. Vale also
received demands from some of the provinces affected by the
project, Chief Executive Officer Murilo Ferreira told analysts
in a Feb. 28 conference call.  “We have analyzed all scenarios and have a response for
any decision Vale may chose today,” said Molina, who has held
meetings with federal government and company officials over the
past month. “This situation will be sorted out.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
