Turkey’s Internet economy will probably grow at 19 percent a year until 2017 as Turkish companies embrace Web-based business, according to a report sponsored by  Google Inc. (GOOG)   Turkey’s Internet economy will grow to 2.6 percent of gross domestic product, or 64.3 billion liras ($35.7 billion), by 2017 from 1.7 percent and 22 billion liras in 2011, Boston Consulting Group Inc. said in the  report . In 2011, Turkish consumers spent about 8.8 billion liras on Internet access and charges, and more than 4.4 billion liras on e-commerce.  “Consumption is expected to be the largest driver of growth, primarily through an increase in e-commerce following a rise in broadband and Internet user penetration,” according to the report.  In a more optimistic case, with broadband penetration and smartphone retailing at the upper end of expectations, the figure in 2017 may reach 76.4 billion liras, or 3 percent of GDP, similar to current levels in Germany or  France , according to the report. About 47 percent of people in  Turkey  use the Internet, less than the European Union level of 71 percent, the report showed.
