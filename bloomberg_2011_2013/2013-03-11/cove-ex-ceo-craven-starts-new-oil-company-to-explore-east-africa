John Craven, the oil executive who
presided over a 20-fold jump in value at Cove Energy Plc, will
use his experience in  East Africa  to set up an oil and gas
exploration company focused on the region.  Craven will head Discover Exploration Plc, which has a
production sharing contract off the Comoros Islands between
Mozambique and Madagascar. Michael Blaha and  Michael Nolan ,
Cove’s former executive chairman and chief financial officer,
respectively, will take on the same roles at the new company.  “Our objective is to enter into various deepwater
turbidite plays in young emerging basins, with reliable and
proven partners, and with value added through drilling,” Blaha
said in a statement. “Whilst entry into  Africa  is a primary
target, our discussions are not restricted to this geography.”  Cove, which owned 8.5 percent of the Rovuma-1 exploration
block in Mozambique, sold itself for $1.9 billion to Thailand’s
 PTT Exploration and Production Pcl  after a bidding war with
 Royal Dutch Shell Plc. (RDSA)  More than 100 trillion cubic feet of gas
have been discovered off Tanzania and  Mozambique , enough to meet
global consumption for a year.  Discover, which has acreage adjacent to the Rovuma basin,
has financing from Oranje-Nassau Energie BV as well as the
management team and board.  Cove’s 240-pence-a-share sale price compares with 12 pence
a share at its 2009 initial public offering.  To contact the reporter on this story:
