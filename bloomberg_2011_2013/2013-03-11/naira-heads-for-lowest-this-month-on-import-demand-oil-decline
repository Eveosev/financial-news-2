Nigeria’s naira depreciated for a
second day and headed for its lowest this month as importers
demanded dollars to pay gasoline bills and as oil, the country’s
key export, retreated.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer weakened 0.3
percent to 158.15 per dollar as of 12:45 p.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital. A close at this rate will be the lowest
since Feb. 28, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Nigeria relies on imports to cover 70 percent of its own
fuel needs because of inadequate refining capacity, and those
shipments into the country are a source of pressure on the
naira, according to the central bank. Bonny Light Crude, the
nation’s main export grade, slid for a second day, dropping 0.4
percent to $113.14 in New York. Brent crude fell as industrial
production slowed in  China , the world’s second-biggest oil
consumer, and Saudi Arabia boosted output.  “We’ve seen increase in dollar demand from oil importers
and dealers bringing in consumer goods,” Abubakar Mohammed,
chief executive of Lagos-based Forward Marketing Bureau de
Change Ltd., said by phone. “The outlook of the crude oil
market is also important for the naira exchange rate.”  Foreign-currency reserves in Africa’s most populous country
rose to $47.56 billion, the highest level since at least 2010,
the Central Bank of Nigeria in Abuja said in a March 4 statement
on its website.  The steady increase since early 2012 means the central bank
has “enough ammunition” to address a temporary demand-supply
mismatch in the foreign-exchange market, Samir Gadio, an
emerging-markets strategist at Standard Bank Group Ltd.,
Africa’s largest bank by assets, said in e-mailed comments
today.  Yields on Nigeria’s $500 million of Eurobonds due January
2021 fell 15 basis points to 4.11 percent.  The yield on the country’s 16.39 percent domestic bonds due
January 2022 rose 25 basis points to 11.26 percent, according to
March 8 data compiled on the  Financial Markets Dealers
Association  website.  Ghana ’s cedi gained 0.5 percent to 1.9115 per dollar in
Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
