Mary Jo White, President  Barack Obama ’s nominee to lead the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, says the regulator needs a “sense of urgency ” in
overseeing markets dominated by high-speed trading.  “There must be a sense of urgency brought to addressing
these issues to understand their impact on investors and the
quality of our markets so that the appropriate regulatory
responses can be made,” White wrote in testimony prepared for a
Senate Banking Committee hearing on her nomination tomorrow.  White’s pledge to supervise high-frequency traders and the
fragmented electronic marketplace comes as senators prepare to
ask about her lack of experience overseeing markets and writing
financial rules.  White, 65, is a career prosecutor and defense
lawyer who has defended large banks since stepping down in 2002
as a Manhattan-based U.S. attorney.  In her prepared remarks, she said her first priority would
be completing rules required by the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 and
last year’s Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act. The SEC should
consistently consider the costs and benefits of new rules “from
the outset,” she wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
