U.S. Gulf Coast gasoline
strengthened after  Phillips 66 (PSX)  said a refinery in Sweeny, Texas,
will need several days to restart following a  power failure .  Several process units at the 247,000-barrel-a-day plant
shut or experienced operational issues yesterday after the power
failure triggered by Texas-New Mexico Power Co., a third-party
supplier, according to a filing with the Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality.  The incident “resulted in temporary shutdown of the
refinery,”  Rich Johnson , a Houston-based spokesman for Phillips
66, said in an e-mailed response to questions. “Power has been
restored and we’re in the process of restarting the refinery,
which we expect to take several days.”  The discount for  reformulated , 84-octane gasoline on the
Gulf Coast narrowed 0.5 cent to  22 cents  a gallon versus futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:08 p.m. The
spread between the fuel on the Gulf Coast and New York Harbor
widened to  7.49 cents  a gallon, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The  3-2-1 crack  spread on the Gulf, a measure of refining
profitability based on West Texas Intermediate in Cushing,
Oklahoma, retreated $1.29 to $32.12 a barrel after climbing by
89 cents last week. The same spread for Light Louisiana Sweet
oil declined 99 cents following a $1.24 advance last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
