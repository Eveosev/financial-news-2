Palm oil exports from  Indonesia ,
the largest producer, fell for a second straight month in
January as sales to China declined, an industry group said.  Shipments, which include palm and kernel oils, dropped 1.4
percent to 1.87 million metric tons from 1.896 million tons in
December, the Indonesian Palm Oil Association said in an e-
mailed statement today. The median estimate for exports was 1.6
million tons in a Bloomberg survey last month, and is 14 percent
more than a year earlier.  Falling shipments from Indonesia may hamper efforts to trim
stockpiles, extending the 26 percent drop in prices in Kuala
Lumpur in the past year. Inventories may drop to 2.3 million
tons this year from 2.5 million at the end of 2012, according to
Derom Bangun, chairman of the Indonesian Palm Oil Board.  The decline in exports “is because of seasonal factors,”
Fadhil Hasan, executive director at the association, known as
Gapki, said by phone from Jakarta. Importers curbed purchases as
demand slowed after Christmas and New Year holidays, he said.  Shipments to  China  fell 15 percent to 178,230 tons in
January, Gapki data showed. Exports to  India  rose 21 percent to
808,830 and sales to European Union gained 8 percent to 389,370
tons, the data showed.  Palm oil and it’s by-products accounted for 97 percent of
total January shipments, or 1.76 million tons, and the rest was
palm kernel oils, the data showed.  Palm oil futures for May delivery ended little changed at
2,449 ringgit ($787) a ton on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange
in Kuala Lumpur today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
