Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  will sell
a 20 percent stake in its wealth-management unit,  St. James’s
Place Plc (STJ) , as Britain’s biggest mortgage lender seeks to bolster
capital.  Lloyds will sell a minimum of 102 million shares in the
company, realizing a gain of between 350 million pounds ($522
million) and 400 million pounds, the London-based bank said in a
statement today. Lloyds will retain 37 percent of St. James’s
Place after the sale.  Lloyds Chief Executive Officer Antonio Horta-Osorio is
reducing the bank’s balance sheet to enhance its financial
strength after it was bailed out by the U.K. taxpayer during the
banking crisis. The so-called non-core division has shrunk 49
percent to 98 billion pounds in the past two years. Lloyds
acquired St. James’s Place when it bought HBOS Plc in 2008.  Bank of England  Governor  Mervyn King  said in November U.K.
banks may need to increase the capital they hold against
potential losses. He asked the Financial Services Authority to
investigate which banks might be undercapitalized and report
back in March.  The sale will boost Lloyds’s core Tier 1 capital ratio by
20 basis points, Lloyds said. The ratio was 12 percent at the
end of 2012.  St. James’s Place, which advises clients with typically
more than 100,000 pounds to invest, has more than doubled funds
under management over the last five years as economic turmoil
and a changing tax burden in the U.K. prompted high earners to
look for investment advice. The firm charges annual fees for
investing clients’ assets in third-party funds.  St James’s Place shares have risen 54 percent in the last
12 months and increased its dividend by a third to 10.64 pence
for last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
