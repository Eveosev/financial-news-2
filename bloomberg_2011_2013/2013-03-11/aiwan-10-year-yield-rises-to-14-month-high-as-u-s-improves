Taiwan’s government bonds fell for
a fifth day, driving the 10-year yield to the highest level in
14 months, on optimism demand for the island’s exports will
improve as the  U.S. economy  recovers.  Stocks rallied across  Asia  and the  Dollar Index (DXY)  approached
its highest in seven months after a report last week showed jobs
in the U.S., Taiwan’s second-biggest overseas market, increased
236,000 in February, beating the median 165,000 estimate of
economists in a Bloomberg survey. Global funds bought $163
million more Taiwanese shares than they sold in the five days
through March 8, bringing net purchases for the year to $2.1
billion, according to exchange data.  The yield on the 1.125 percent notes due March 2023 climbed
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 1.308 percent
as of 9:58 a.m. in Taipei, the highest level since Jan. 5, 2012,
according to prices from Gretai Securities Market.  “Yields continue to rise after the good jobs data in the
U.S.” but we’re seeing orders to buy the bonds at 1.3 percent,
said  Albert Lee , a fixed-income trader in Taipei at Cathay
United Bank Co. “A consistent strengthening of the  U.S. dollar 
might lead to money shifting out of Taiwan bonds into
investment-grade dollar debt in the long run.”  Currency Weakens  The  Taiwan dollar  rose 0.1 percent to NT$29.704 against its
U.S. counterpart, based on prices from Taipei Forex Inc. It
touched NT$29.810 earlier, the weakest level in six months.  The central bank has sold the local currency near the close
on most days in the past 11 months, according to traders who
asked not to be identified.  One-month  non-deliverable forwards  in the Taiwanese
currency weakened 0.1 percent to NT$29.698 per dollar, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Implied volatility, a measure of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  over a month used to price
options, advanced 10 basis points to 3.86 percent.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  was little changed at
0.388 percent, according to the Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
