Empresas Hites SA (HITES) ,  Chile ’s fifth-
largest department store operator, was headed for its biggest
three-day drop in a year as analysts said a measure of operating
profit was below their expectations.  Hites fell 3.2 percent to 557 pesos at 1:28 p.m. in
Santiago and has  tumbled  11 percent over three days, the biggest
such decline on a closing basis since October 2011.  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization was 10.8 billion pesos ($22.9 million) in the
fourth quarter, according to a March 7 filing from the Santiago-
based company. The figure, known as Ebitda, was 0.5 percent
lower than  estimated  by Bice Inversiones. Ebitda as a percentage
of revenue fell to 13.5 percent from 14.1 percent.  “The lower-than-expected Ebitda explains the fall since
the report,” Aldo Morales, an analyst at Bice, said today in a
telephone interview.  The stock had rallied 53 percent this year prior to the
earnings report, and now investors are “taking some profits,”
Morales said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
