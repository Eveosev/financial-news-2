Canadian heavy oil strengthened on
the spot market for a second day, reaching its strongest price
relative to the U.S. benchmark in almost five months.  Western Canada Select, a heavy blend of diluted oil-sands
bitumen, strengthened by $1 a barrel to $18.50 a barrel below
West Texas Intermediate crude for delivery in April, according
to Calgary oil broker Net Energy Inc. It was the smallest
discount for the grade since Oct. 17, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Forward-delivery months also strengthened. WCS for May
delivery gained 50 cents to a $19.25-a-barrel discount; June
delivery rose 75 cents to a $19-a-barrel discount.  Syncrude, a light oil processed from bitumen, strengthened
by 50 cents to a $6.50 premium to WTI.  On the Gulf Coast, offshore oils weakened as WTI narrowed
its discount to Brent, the benchmark for overseas imports. The
gap between WTI and Brent fell 51 cents to $18.40 at 2:20 p.m.
 New York  time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet oil’s premium narrowed 65 cents to
$20.85 above WTI at 2:34 p.m., according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Poseidon’s premium lost 25 cents to $16, and Thunder
Horse lost 50 cents to an $18.50 premium.  To contact the reporter on this story:
