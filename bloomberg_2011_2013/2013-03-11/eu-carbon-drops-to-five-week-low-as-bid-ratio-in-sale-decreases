European Union carbon allowances
dropped to a five-week low as demand fell in an auction of new
permits and German power prices declined.  Carbon for December slumped as much as 7.8 percent to 3.93
euros ($5.12) a metric ton, the lowest since Jan. 31, and closed
at 3.95 euros on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in  London .  Prices may fall further as European countries auction more
allowances, James Cooper, an analyst at Bloomberg New Energy
Finance in London, said in an e-mailed report today. This week’s
sales may total 21.49 million tons, the second-highest amount
ever, according to data from exchanges. That includes 2 million
tons of Phase 2 permits that can be used to cover emissions made
in 2012.  “The bearish impact of EU allowance supply looks to be
taking its toll,” and prices may fall toward 3.50 euros a ton
this week, he said.  Bidders at today’s sale by EU nations put in orders for
2.66 times the amount auctioned, the lowest bid ratio for a week
and down from 3.3 on March 8, according to European Energy
Exchange AG data published on its website. That’s less than the
average Phase 3 cover ratio of 2.88 from all auctions this year.  Phase 3 of the market runs for eight years starting this
year.  EU carbon has dropped 41 percent in 2013 as lawmakers seek
ways to shore up prices caused by an oversupply of allowances.
The decline has eroded the price premium of EU December 2014
contracts relative to United Nations Certified Emission
Reduction credits to 3.80 euros, the smallest gap since Jan. 31.  German power for 2014 dropped 1.2 percent to 40.80 euros a
megawatt-hour, the lowest since Feb. 1, according to data from
brokers. Lower power reduces utilities’ incentive to sell
electricity forward, a hedging process that may include buying
fuel and carbon futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
