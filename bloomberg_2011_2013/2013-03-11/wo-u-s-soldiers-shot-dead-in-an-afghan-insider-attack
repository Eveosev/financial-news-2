Two U.S. soldiers serving with
NATO’s  International Security Assistance Force  were shot dead
today by an Afghan police officer in eastern  Afghanistan ,
officials said.  The police officer positioned himself in the back of a
police pickup truck and opened fire on Americans with a machine
gun, killing two U.S. troops, said Abdul Razaq Quraishi, a
deputy police chief of Wardak province in a phone interview.
Three Afghan policemen, including the assailant, were shot dead
by U.S. troops in response, he said.  The incident, the second so-called green-on-blue attack in
four days, took place on a joint Afghan-US military base in
Jalrez district of the key province, neighboring the Afghan
capital Kabul. In the earlier incident, individuals wearing
Afghan National Army uniforms turned their weapons against U.S.
troops, killing an American civilian contractor and wounding
several troops in same region.  ISAF confirmed the insider attack in an e-mailed statement
today, saying two U.S. soldiers were shot dead by an individual
wearing an Afghan National Security Force uniform. Afghan and
U.S. military officials are investigating the incident to find
out if the Taliban had a connection to the attack, according to
Quraishi and ISAF.  The attack took place a day after the expiration of Afghan
President  Hamid Karzai ’sorder for U.S. special forces troops to
leave the province in two weeks. The order was issued after
investigators said they found Afghans working with the troops
were torturing and murdering fellow citizens.  To contact the reporter on this story:
