Thailand ’s baht fell the most in
six weeks as Chinese data damped the nation’s export outlook.
Government bonds fell even after an upgrade by Fitch Ratings.  Industrial output in China, Thailand’s largest overseas
market, had the slowest start to the year since 2009, an
official report showed on March 9. Thailand’s credit rating was
restored to BBB+ by Fitch Ratings on March 8, four years after
political turmoil prompted a cut. The rating, three levels above
junk, is back in line with those of  Standard & Poor’s  and
Moody’s Investors Service.  “Weaker-than-expected China data is weighing on the
baht,” said Shigehisa Shiroki, chief trader on the Asian and
emerging-markets team at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in  Tokyo .
“Sentiment itself is not so weak, but there’s a broad dollar-
buying move today as well. The rating upgrade was already priced
in and didn’t have any impact.”  The baht declined 0.3 percent, the most since Jan. 25, to
29.81 per dollar as of 8:49 a.m. in Bangkok, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That pared its gain this year to 2.6
percent, the best performance among the 11 most-traded Asian
currencies. One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected
moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, rose one basis
point to 5.09 percent.  The  Dollar Index (DXY) , which tracks the greenback against the
currencies of six major trading partners, rose 0.1 percent today
after advancing 0.8 percent on March 8, the most since Feb. 20.  The yield on Thailand’s 3.625 percent  government bonds  due
June 2023 rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
3.66 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
