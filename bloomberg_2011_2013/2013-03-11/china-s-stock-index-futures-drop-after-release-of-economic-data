China’s benchmark stock  index  fell
in its longest losing streak in three months as the country’s
industrial output had the weakest start to a year since 2009 and
lending and retail sales growth slowed.  Industrial Bank Co. (601166)  led lenders lower after the nation’s
new loans last month trailed analyst estimates. Liquor maker
Sichuan Swellfun Co. dropped among consumer companies after the
country’s retail sales growth in the first two months was the
smallest for that period since 2004.  China Vanke Co. (000002)  and Poly
Real Estate Group Co. advanced at least 1.4 percent as property
sales jumped this year.  “The economic recovery is weaker than expected,” said
 Wang Zheng , Shanghai-based chief investment officer at Jingxi
Investment Management Co., which manages $120 million.
“Investors are worried that stocks may already have moved ahead
of fundamentals.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  dropped 0.4 percent to
2,310.59 at the close, trimming its gain since last year’s Dec.
3 low to 18 percent. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  declined 0.6 percent to
2,592.37. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  slipped 0.1
percent in  Hong Kong . The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN)  rose 1
percent in  New York  on March 8.  The Shanghai index retreated 1.7 percent last week on
concerns the government will tighten monetary policy and
regulators will allow the resumption of initial public
offerings. It remains up 1.8 percent this year.  Industrial production climbed 9.9 percent in the first two
months and  retail sales  rose 12.3 percent, the statistics bureau
said over the weekend, trailing economists’ estimates. New
local-currency loans in February fell to 620 billion  yuan  ($99.6
billion), the People’s Bank of China said, less than the
estimates of 27 out of 28 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey.  Banks, Insurers  Industrial Bank, part-owned by a unit of HSBC Holdings Plc,
retreated 3.2 percent to 19.09 yuan. Ping An Bank Co. slid 1
percent to 22.63 yuan, adding to a two-day, 5.7 percent loss.
 China Minsheng Banking Corp. (600016) , the nation’s first privately owned
bank, lost 3.2 percent to 10.22 yuan.  A  gauge  tracking consumer-staples shares slumped 0.4
percent, the third most among the CSI 300’s 10 industry groups.
Sichuan Swellfun, the Chinese liquor maker that’s a partner of
Diageo Plc, declined 1.9 percent to 17.70 yuan. Wuliangye Yibin
Co., China’s second-biggest liquor maker by market value, fell
1.2 percent to 24.50 yuan.  The moderation in retail sales follows a crackdown by new
Communist Party chief  Xi Jinping  on lavish spending by
government officials and state-owned companies, part of efforts
to curb corruption and waste.  Property Stocks  Fixed-asset  investment  increased by higher-than-estimated
21.2 percent in January and February, while consumer prices
climbed a more-than-estimated 3.2 percent in February from a
year earlier. Standard Chartered Plc estimates inflation will
average 4 percent this year, compared with the government’s
target of 3.5 percent.  The Shanghai Composite is valued at 9.5 times earnings for
the next 12 months, compared with a five-year average of 13.5,
according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. Trading volumes were 34
percent lower than the 30-day average and 30-day volatility
dropped to the lowest in a week, Bloomberg data showed.  A  measure  of property stocks in the Shanghai Composite rose
1 percent. Vanke, the nation’s biggest listed property
developer, rose 1.4 percent to 11.11 yuan. Poly Real Estate, the
second largest, gained 1.7 percent to 11.57 yuan.  Property sales jumped 78 percent in the January-to-February
period while real-estate investment climbed 23 percent, the
statistics bureau said.  Rail Stocks  Guangshen Railway Co. (601333)  gained 1.9 percent to 3.26 yuan as
Barclays Plc said the government’s plan to dismantle the railway
ministry will benefit industry stocks through reduced
bureaucracy and increased participation of private capital.
Daqin Railway Co., the operator of China’s biggest coal
transport network, added 0.8 percent to 7.77 yuan.  The Ministry of Railways will be split into two, according
to a report signed by Premier  Wen Jiabao  delivered to the
National People’s Congress in Beijing. Some functions will be
put into a State Railway Administration under the Ministry of
Transportation. A new company, China Railway Corp., will take
over commercial operations, according to the plan.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
