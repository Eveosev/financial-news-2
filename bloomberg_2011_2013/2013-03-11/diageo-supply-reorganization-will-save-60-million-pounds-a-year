Diageo Plc (DGE)  said a reorganization at
its supply and procurement operation will lead to savings of 60
million pounds ($89.6 million) a year within three years.  The reorganization will cost about 100 million pounds, the
London-based distiller said in a statement today. Responsibility
for local operations will be transferred to the companyâ€™s key
markets as Diageo reduces regional structures, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
