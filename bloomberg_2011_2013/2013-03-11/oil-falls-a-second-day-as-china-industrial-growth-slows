Oil rose in New York as equities
advanced for a seventh day, bolstering optimism that U.S. fuel
demand will grow.  Futures rallied after banks led gains in U.S. equities that
pushed the  Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU)  to a record and the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index near the all-time high. Prices
dropped as much as 1.2 percent in earlier trading as China’s
industrial production trailed estimates and after Saudi Arabian
crude output climbed in February from a 20-month low.  “I don’t see anything other than the equities supporting
 oil prices  today,” said  Tim Evans , an energy analyst at Citi
Futures Perspective in New York. “There tends to be a
correlation between the  S&P 500  and the oil market. Crude tested
the downside earlier and couldn’t break through and it’s now
bobbing back up.”  Crude oil for April delivery gained 11 cents to $92.06 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest
settlement since Feb. 27. The volume of all futures traded was
31 percent below the 100-day average. Futures are down 14
percent from a year earlier.  Brent oil for April settlement dropped 63 cents, or 0.6
percent, to end the session at $110.22 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The volume of all futures
traded today was 30 percent above the 100-day moving average.
The European benchmark was at an $18.16 premium to WTI,
narrowing for a fourth consecutive day.  Equities Rising  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  gained as much as 0.3
percent to 1,556.21, less than 1.3 percent below the record high
set in intraday trading on Oct. 11, 2007. The Dow also climbed
0.3 percent, reaching an all-time high 14,441.76.  The gain in equities helped oil rebound from an early
decline after Chinese government data showed the world’s second-
biggest oil-consuming nation started the year with the weakest
industrial growth since 2009.  China’s industrial output expanded 9.9 percent in January
and February, according to the government. That’s lower than a
10.6 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg survey. Retail sales
growth also slowed in the period and new local-currency loans
were down in February, separate data showed.  Saudi Output  Saudi Arabia  raised crude production in February to 9.15
million barrels a day, up 100,000 barrels from the previous
month, the Persian Gulf official said, asking not to be
identified because the information is confidential. The kingdom
reduced exports to 9.16 million barrels last month from 9.26
million, according to the official. Crude delivered from storage
accounted for the excess of supply over production, the official
said.  “If the Saudi production gain is confirmed, we should see
further downward pressure on the market,” said  Gene McGillian ,
an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in Stamford,
 Connecticut .  U.S. crude could be supported in the second and third
quarters by pipeline “de-bottlenecking” in  North America  from
April to June, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  The balance at Cushing, Oklahoma, the largest oil storage
hub in the U.S., could “shift into a large deficit” in the
second quarter as refineries end maintenance and new pipeline
capacity from the Permian Basin diverts crude to the Gulf Coast,
 Jeffrey Currie , Goldman’s head of commodities research in New
York, said in an e-mailed report today.  Hedge funds  cut bullish oil bets to a two-month low in the
week ended March 5. Money managers cut net-long positions, or
 wagers  on rising prices, by 4.4 percent to the least since Jan.
1, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s March 8
Commitments of Traders report showed. Bullish bets have fallen
24 percent from an 11-month high in mid-February.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 365,968
contracts as of 3:39 p.m. It totaled 510,994 contracts March 8,
5.4 percent below the three-month average. Open interest was a
record high 1.72 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
