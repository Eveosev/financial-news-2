Indian government bond yields
stayed near the lowest level this month on speculation slowing
economic growth and easing inflation will prompt the central
bank to cut  interest rates  this month.  Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram said last week he
hopes borrowing costs will be reduced after data released Feb.
28 showed  Asia ’s third-largest economy  grew  4.5 percent from a
year earlier in the final three months of 2012, the weakest pace
in almost four years. Wholesale  prices  rose 6.6 percent in
February, the least in 39 months, according to a Bloomberg News
survey before the data is published on March 14.  “The overall outlook for bonds is positive,” said
Srinivasa Raghavan, the Mumbai-based executive vice president of
treasury at  Dhanlaxmi Bank Ltd. (DHLBK)  “The central bank is expected
to cut rates as growth and inflation are slowing.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes maturing in June 2022
was 7.84 percent, matching a level touched on March 8, according
to the central bank’s trading system. That was the lowest level
since Feb. 27.  The monetary authority, which reduced the repurchase rate
by 25 basis points to 7.75 percent in January, will review
borrowing costs next on March 19.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, was steady at
7.57 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
