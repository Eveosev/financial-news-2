The U.S. Treasury Department froze
the U.S. assets of North Korea’s Foreign Trade Bank, saying it
facilitates transactions linked to the proliferation of weapons
of mass destruction.  The company, which is North Korea’s primary foreign
exchange bank, “facilitated millions of dollars in
transactions” which benefited the country’s premier arms dealer
Korea Mining Development Corp., the Treasury Department said
today in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
