General Electric Co. (GE)  Chief
Executive  Jeffrey Immelt  received total compensation of $25.8
million in 2012, including a $12.1 million award for improving
manufacturing performance and shrinking the finance unit.  Immelt, 57, also received $3.3 million in  salary , the same
as the previous year, and a bonus of $4.5 million, up $500,000
from 2011, according to Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE’s proxy
materials filed today with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission.  GE’s board rewarded its CEO for exceeding three-year growth
targets on earnings per share as well as industrial cash flow
and return on capital, all while shrinking GE Capital’s balance
sheet. Shares of the world’s biggest maker of jet engines,
diesel locomotives and medical scanners advanced 17.2 percent
last year,  outpacing  a gain of 13.4 percent on the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index.  Immelt’s 2012 total compensation climbed 20 percent from
the previous year’s $21.6 million, according to the  SEC filing .
Excluding the change in the value of his pension and other
deferred compensation, it increased 80 percent to $20.5 million.  His realized compensation, or income reported to the U.S.
Internal Revenue Service for the period, was $7.91 million,
little changed from a year earlier, the SEC filing shows. That
doesn’t include the payout under GE’s long-term performance award
program, which was settled in cash this year.  Three GE board members aren’t standing for re-election at
this year’s annual meeting. Penske Corp. CEO Roger Penske,
former U.S. Senator Sam Nunn and former Procter & Gamble Co. CEO
Alan Lafley are all stepping down.  Marijn Dekkers, chairman and CEO of Bayer AG; former
Vanguard Group Inc. CEO  John Brennan ; and Francisco D’Souza, CEO
of Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., were appointed to the
board after last year’s annual meeting. GE nominated former SEC
Chairwoman  Mary Schapiro  for a board seat earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
