Nigeria ’s trade surplus grew 76
percent in 2012 from a year earlier to 16.8 trillion naira ($106
billion), the  National Bureau of Statistics  said.  Exports rose 15 percent from 2011 to 22.4 trillion naira,
the Abuja-based agency said late yesterday on its website. The
fourth-quarter surplus contracted 0.8 percent from the previous
three months and 20 percent from a year earlier to 4.6 trillion
naira.  Nigeria, Africa’s largest crude producer and sub-Saharan
Africa’s second-largest economy, relies on oil for more than
two-thirds of exports. Crude sales increased 11 percent last
year, the statistics agency said. The country’s main market was
 Europe , which took 37 percent of exports.  Imports were led by machinery, with 41 percent of goods
coming from  Asia  and China the largest supplier, according to
the agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
