Ukraine’s winter rapeseed harvest
is seen jumping as much as 81 percent this year as “the average
yield potential is rather high” on favorable weather,
 UkrAgroConsult  said.  Farmers may reap 1.93 million metric tons of winter
rapeseed, compared with 1.07 million tons in 2012, the Kiev-
based researcher said in an e-mailed note today. About 94
percent of winter rapeseed was in good or satisfactory condition
as of the end of March, UkrAgroConsult said.  The total crop of winter and spring rapeseed may climb to 2
million tons this year from 1.23 million tons a year ago,
according to the statement.  “Winter crops condition in early March is considered to be
among the best for the last few years,” the researcher said,
adding that more than 91 percent of winter grain was in good or
satisfactory condition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
