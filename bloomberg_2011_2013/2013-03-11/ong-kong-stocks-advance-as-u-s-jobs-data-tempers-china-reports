(Corrects time stamp in second paragraph.)  Hong Kong  stocks  erased gains amid
disappointing Chinese economic data as  Want Want China Holdings
Ltd. (151)  retreated from a record high. Shares climbed earlier after
a U.S. jobs report beat estimates.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  fell 0.1 percent to 23,064.93 as of
3:41 p.m. in Hong Kong, after gaining as much as 0.7 percent.
About the same number of stocks climbed as fell, with trading
volume about 25 percent below the 30-day average for the time of
day. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of mainland companies
declined 0.6 percent to 11,417.63.  To contact the reporter on this story:
