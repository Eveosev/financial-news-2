China Windpower Group Ltd. (182) ,  China
Development Bank  Corp. and China Asset Management Co., Ltd.
agreed to invest in solar power as the nation thatâ€™s seeking to
limit pollution doubled targets for new projects.  They will set up a joint venture to invest in solar
projects at home and abroad, China Windpower said today in a
statement. The Hong Kong-based company will own 45 percent while
units of China Development Bank and China Asset Management will
hold the remaining shares.  China Windpower is boosting its solar business after the
country set a target to add 10 gigawatts of new solar projects
this year, more than double a previous goal. China is expected
to drive annual global solar installations to a record and
unseat  Germany  as the biggest market in 2013 as it seeks to curb
coal dependence and social unrest from pollution, according to
Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  The accord, signed as a memorandum of understanding, is
subject to a formal agreement, according to the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
