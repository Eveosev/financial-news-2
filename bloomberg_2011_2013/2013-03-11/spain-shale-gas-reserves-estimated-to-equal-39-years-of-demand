Spain , a country that’s yet to
produce its first shale gas, probably has enough resources of
the fuel to satisfy domestic demand for at least 39 years,
according to the nation’s  Council of Mining Engineers .  The estimated reserves of natural gas trapped in shale rock
are about 50 trillion cubic feet, Fernando Pendas, a water and
oil geology professor at University of Oviedo, said today at a
briefing in  Madrid  to present the council’s findings. The
estimate could double once exploration studies are finalized and
more is discovered through breaking open rock using hydraulic
fracturing, knowns as fracking.  “If we don’t allow fracking, Spain would have missed out
on a huge opportunity,” Pendas said. As many 100 companies have
applied for permits to begin exploration using fracking in Spain
during the past five years.  The most advanced shale-gas exploration projects are
located in the Basque-Cantabrian basin in the north of Spain and
benefit from proximity to water sources, Angel Camara, co-writer
of the study who is a chemical engineering and fuels professor
at Madrid’s Polytechnic university.  The environmental success of shale gas production, which
has been targeted by environmental protests in Spanish regions
including Cantabria, will “entirely depend on good operator
practices,” Camara said. “If those are fulfilled, there is no
reason to fear.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
