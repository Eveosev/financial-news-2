  Japan ’s machinery orders plunged
13 percent in January, the biggest decline in eight months,
signaling limits on corporate investment as Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe tries to drive an economic revival.  The decline from the previous month, announced by the
Cabinet Office today in  Tokyo , compared with the median estimate
in a Bloomberg News survey of 26 economists for a 1.7 percent
fall. Large orders can cause volatile results.  Japan returned to growth in the fourth quarter as the yen
began to slide, bolstering Abe’s campaign to end 15 years of
deflation and revive the world’s third-biggest economy. Today’s
data are a reminder that business investment will not drive the
recovery, said Izumi Devalier, a Japan economist at HSBC
Holdings Plc in  Hong Kong .  “Looking ahead, we expect accelerating consumption,
residential and public investment,” Devalier said. “But given
that exports are trending at still-weak levels, it will take
more time before we see the improved business environment
spurred by the weak yen and increased manufacturer optimism
translate into robust corporate investment.”  The Japanese currency was little changed at 96.03 per
dollar as of 9:33 a.m. in Tokyo.  Devalier cautioned against reading too much into a single
month of “very volatile” data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
