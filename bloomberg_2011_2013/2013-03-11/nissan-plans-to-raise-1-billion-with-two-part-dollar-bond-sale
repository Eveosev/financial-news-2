Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , Japan’s second-
largest automaker, raised $1 billion in a two-part, dollar-
denominated bond offering through its finance unit.  Nissan Motor Acceptance sold $400 million of 1.8 percent,
five-year notes that yield 95 basis points more than similar-
maturity U.S. Treasuries and $600 million of 1 percent, three-
year securities with a 65 basis-point spread, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The transaction was doubled from $500 million in earlier
discussions, according to a person familiar with the offering
who asked not to be identified, citing lack of authorization to
speak publicly.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  is Japan’s biggest automaker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
