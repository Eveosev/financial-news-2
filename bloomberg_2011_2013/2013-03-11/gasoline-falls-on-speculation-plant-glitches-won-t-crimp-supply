Gasoline fell on speculation that a
rash of refinery glitches won’t result in lower production of
the motor fuel.  Futures retreated 1.3 percent after climbing 2 percent
earlier after refineries from the  Gulf Coast  to the Midwest
reported flaring, malfunctions and power outages during the past
several days. The gasoline crack spread, or the premium of the
fuel over crude, narrowed.  “A rash of refinery problems seem to spark the market but
the concern has gone away,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market
analyst at Price Futures Group in  Chicago . “We’re back in the
shoulder season and we have plenty of supply.”  April-delivery gasoline fell 4.13 cents to $3.1622 a gallon
at 10:29 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  on volume that
was 114 percent above the 100-day average for the time of day.  The April crack spread versus West  Texas  Intermediate crude
on Nymex narrowed 82 cents to $41.77 a barrel. The spread
against Brent oil on ICE Futures Europe Exchange slipped 66
cents to $23.04.  Yesterday, Phillips 66’s Sweeny  refinery  in Texas reported
a  power failure  and BP Plc’s Toledo, Ohio, plant flared,
according to filings with the National Response Center.  The Energy Information Administration reported on March 6
that gasoline supplies in PADD 1, or the East Coast, expanded
651,000 barrels to 60.5 million as of March 1, the highest level
in almost a year. East Coast inventories of  reformulated
gasoline , or RBOB, rose 1.43 million barrels to 20.3 million,
the most since March 2011.  RIN Concern  Futures touched $3.2672 earlier, the highest intraday level
since Sept. 28, and settled at a five-month high on March 8 on
concern that higher prices for Renewable Identification Numbers,
or RINs, that refiners must buy in lieu of blending ethanol into
gasoline, may limit supplies in some areas.  The  cost  for RINs in 2013 surged to $1.06 a gallon on March
8, from 56 cents 7.3 cents on Jan. 8.  “The market is concerned some refiners and importers won’t
be able to meet renewable fuel standard in 2013 because the RINs
simply won’t be available and as a result could cause sporadic
shortages in certain areas,” said  Andy Lipow , president of
Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  Heating oil for March delivery declined 1.89 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $2.956 a gallon on volume that was 4 percent below
the 100-day average for the time of day.  Gasoline at the pump , averaged nationwide, fell 0.2 cent to
$3.696 a gallon, AAA said today on its website. Prices have
fallen every day since Feb. 26.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
