Investors need to carefully analyze
credit-enhancing structures for offshore Chinese bonds and
examine the “economic motivations” behind such support,
according to Moody’s Investors Service.  Structures such as keepwell deeds, which are contracts
between a parent company and its unit to maintain solvency,
should be scrutinized, according to Vikas Halan, a senior
analyst at the ratings company. Keepwell deeds, guarantees and
letters of credit are used by onshore Chinese companies to
maximize the credit quality of offshore debt sold by their
subsidiaries.  “It is critical to look beyond contractual arrangements to
understand the business and economic motivations which a parent
might have to support the subsidiary,” Halan wrote in a report
dated March 7. The “lack of precedent in enforcing a keepwell
agreement in  China  and the potential for complexity to impede
timeliness of payment are considered as weaknesses.”  Chinese issuers had sold more than $9.4 billion of credit-
enhanced bonds graded by Moody’s as of March 7, excluding taps,
the ratings company said in the report. China National Petroleum
Corp., the nation’s biggest oil company, has used keepwell deeds
on almost $3.5 billion of debt sold by its units, Moody’s data
show. The agreements don’t require onshore regulatory approval,
unlike guarantees, Moody’s wrote in the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
