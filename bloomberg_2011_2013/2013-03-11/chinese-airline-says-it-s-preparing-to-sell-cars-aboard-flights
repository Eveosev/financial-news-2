Passengers aboard  China ’s Spring
Airlines Co., the nation’s biggest privately-owned carrier, may
soon be able to buy cosmetics, jewelry...and cars.  The airline plans to start selling Chinese-branded
automobiles priced from about 100,000  yuan  ($16,000) by as early
as next month, Zhang Wu’An, a spokesman at the Shanghai-based
company, said in an interview yesterday. Spring Air is still in
talks over details such as which brands and models to offer,
Zhang said, declining to give details.  “We wanted to start in-flight sales a few years ago, and
decided cars are suitable for our passengers,” Zhang said.
“Car sales are very popular in Shanghai and our passengers can
have time during their flight to study details of the models
available.”  Car sales on flights will initially be available on flights
from Shanghai and could be introduced to other flights, Zhang
said. Flight attendants will be trained on the car details,
while passengers may be eligible for discounts, he said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
