Belimo Holding AG (BEAN)  shares rose the
most in more than a month after the Swiss maker of air
conditioning machinery forecast continued growth in  Europe , its
biggest market.  Belimo climbed as much as 3.9 percent, the biggest intraday
gain since Feb. 6, and was up 3 percent at 2,060 Swiss francs as
of 10:41 a.m. in Zurich. The stock has risen 16 percent this
year, giving the Hinwil-based company a market value of 1.28
billion francs ($1.4 billion).  The supplier to the building industry said it expects
growth in its major European markets in 2013, even as a
lingering financial crisis crimps government spending. Europe
accounted for 55 percent of Belimo’s sales in 2012.  Full-year net income rose 19 percent to 61.4 million francs
as sales rose 6.9 percent to 444.6 million francs, Belimo said.
The company is proposing a dividend of 60 francs a share, an
increase of 10 francs from a year earlier.  “Belimo reported a solid recovery,” Serge Rotzer, an
analyst at Bank Vontobel AG said in a note to investors. Rotzer
has a hold recommendation on the stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
