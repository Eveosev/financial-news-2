The U.S. has expelled two
Venezuelan diplomats following a similar action last week by
 Venezuela  against two U.S. military attaches, according to State
Department officials.  The Venezuelan diplomats, Second Secretary Orlando Jose
Montanez Olivares and Consular Officer Victor Camacaro Mata,
were informed on March 9, according to officials who asked not
to be named ahead of the official announcement.  The two diplomats have left the U.S., the officials said
today.  Venezuela expelled two U.S. military attaches after
accusing them of plotting against President  Hugo Chavez â€™s
government as the leader was dying from cancer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
