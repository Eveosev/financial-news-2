China plans to set four rates that
solar-power plants can earn for selling electricity to grid
operators, compared with two currently, PV-Tech news reported on
its website yesterday, citing people it didnâ€™t identify.  The prices for utility-scale generation will be based on
regions, and they no longer will be a fixed tariff of 1  yuan  (16
U.S. cents) a kilowatt-hour everywhere except in  Tibet , where
they get 1.15 yuan, according to the report. The lowest price
will be 0.75 yuan a kilowatt-hour in four areas of  Qinghai
province , the report said. The other rates will be 0.85 yuan,
0.95 yuan and 1 yuan a kilowatt-hour, PV-Tech said.  The government also plans to set a rate of 0.35 yuan a
kilowatt-hour for distributed solar-power projects. Such
projects would have less than 6 megawatts of capacity and would
be connected to grids with voltage of as much as 10 kilovolts.  The National Development and Reform Commission has been
seeking advice from solar-power generation companies. Two calls
and a fax to the NDRC seeking comment went unanswered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
