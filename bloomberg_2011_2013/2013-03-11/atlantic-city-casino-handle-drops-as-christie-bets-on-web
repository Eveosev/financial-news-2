Atlantic City casino revenue fell
more than 12 percent in February, continuing a downward spiral
that  New Jersey  Governor Chris Christie said may end with the
start of Internet-based betting, fueling the resort’s revival.  The seaside city has fallen to third-largest U.S. gambling
market after Pennsylvania and  Las Vegas . Casino revenue dropped
13 percent in January and was down 13 percent for the first two
months of 2013 compared with the same period a year ago,
according to figures from the state Gaming Enforcement Division.  “I wish it was up 13 percent, but it’s not,” Christie
said at a news briefing in North Brunswick.  The first-term Republican said he is midway through his
five-year turnaround strategy and it is too early to judge the
result in  Atlantic City . Internet-based gambling in the resort’s
casinos hasn’t begun yet, he said. Christie’s proposed fiscal
2014 budget anticipates a $1.2 billion market for gambling over
the Web in the first year and projects an 85 percent increase in
casino tax collections.  To contact the reporter on this story:
