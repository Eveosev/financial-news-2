Vietnam  plans to boost domestic
debt sales to a record 150 trillion dong ($7.2 billion) in 2013
as falling property prices and stagnant bank lending supports
demand for the government notes, according to the State Treasury.  The Southeast Asian nation will sell 120 trillion dong of
bonds with maturities of between two and 15 years, and 30
trillion dong of Treasury bills, Tran Minh Hang, deputy head of
the treasury, she said in a telephone interview today. The
country sold an all-time high of 141 trillion dong of securities 
last year, he said.  “We want to take the chance when difficulties in other
markets have slowed banks from extending loans and prompted
investors to put money in bonds, which are a relatively safe and
profitable investment channel,” Hang said from Hanoi.  The government is struggling to raise revenue this year
after it granted tax exemptions, reductions and payment delays
to help businesses cope with the slowest annual economic growth
since 1999. The World Bank forecast in December that Vietnam’s
gross domestic product will increase 5.5 percent this year,
compared with 5.03 percent in 2012, which would be the third
year of below 6 percent growth.  Vietnam’s property market is “frozen and faces many
difficulties with about 112 trillion dong of real-estate
projects unsold,” according to a January posting on the website
of the National Assembly’s Economic Committee. Credit growth may
remain slow in the first few months of 2013, Prime Minister
Nguyen Tan Dung said on Jan. 1.  Bonds Steady  The yield on the three-year notes was little changed at
8.56 percent as of 4:10 p.m. in Hanoi, according to a daily
fixing rate from banks compiled by Bloomberg. The five-year
yield was steady at 9.32 percent, almost double the 4.83 percent
rate on similar-maturity Indonesian sovereign securities.  “There’s good appetite for government debt now, especially
from overseas investors,” said Nguyen Duy Phong, a Ho Chi Minh
City-based analyst at Viet Capital Securities Co. “Vietnamese
bond yields are at attractive levels compared to regional
markets.”  The dong traded at 20,938 per dollar, compared with 20,935
on March 8. The central bank fixed the reference rate at 20,828,
unchanged since Dec. 26, 2011, according to its website. The
currency is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either side
of the rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
