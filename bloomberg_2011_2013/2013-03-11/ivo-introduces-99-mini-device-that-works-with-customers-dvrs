TiVo Inc. (TIVO) , the company that helped
pioneer digital video recorders, introduced a $99.99 accessory
called the TiVo Mini that lets users access applications and use
their existing DVRs in additional rooms.  The device requires a $5.99 monthly subscription fee or 
customers can make a one-time payment of $249.98 to get the
Mini and lifetime service, the  San Jose , California-based 
company said in a statement. The TiVo Mini lets customers 
access one of their DVRs and use its features on another TV 
without having to give it its own set-top box.  The product represents a new potential revenue stream for a
company that has struggled to maintain sales growth and
profitability over the past five years. While TiVo helped create
a category of devices that has become common -- used by millions
of consumers to pause live TV and schedule recordings of shows
-- the company has faced mounting competition in recent years.  “The TiVo Mini answers the demand for a simplified whole-
home viewing experience and a more cost-effective solution than
putting another client DVR or cable set-top box in another
room,” said Jim Denney, general manager of product marketing
for TiVo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
