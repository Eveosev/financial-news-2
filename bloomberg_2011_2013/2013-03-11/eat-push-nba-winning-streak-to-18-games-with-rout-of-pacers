The Miami Heat overcame LeBron James’s lowest-scoring game in 21 months to beat the Indiana
Pacers 105-91 for their 18th straight win, the longest streak in
the National Basketball Association this season.  Mario Chalmers  scored 26 points,  Chris Bosh  had 24 and
Dwyane Wade added 23 yesterday to help the Heat avenge their
last loss, a 102-89 defeat in Indiana on Feb. 1. The Heat went
on a 17-3 scoring run early in the third quarter and pushed
their lead to as many as 23 points during the second half.  James finished with 13 points for Miami, his lowest tally
since scoring eight points in a loss to the Dallas Mavericks in
Game 4 of the NBA Finals on June 7, 2011. Miami has won 14
straight home games and hasn’t lost at AmericanAirlines Arena
since Jan. 4 against the  Chicago Bulls .  The Heat have the best record in the NBA at 47-14 and
surpassed the 17-game win streak of the Los Angeles Clippers
earlier this season. The Pacers, who lead the Eastern
Conference’s Central division, fell to 39-24.  The Heat have matched the second-longest winning streak in
NBA history by a defending champion. The 1981-82 Boston Celtics
also had run of 18 consecutive victories, while the 2008-09
Celtics won 19 games in a row.  The Oklahoma City Thunder beat the Boston Celtics 91-79 for
their eighth win in nine games to improve to 47-16.  Kevin Durant 
recorded 23 points and 11 rebounds for the Thunder, who visit
the San Antonio Spurs (48-15) tonight with a chance to pull even
for the best record in the Western Conference.  The  Los Angeles Lakers  moved into position for the final
playoff berth in the West with a 90-81 win against the Chicago
Bulls.  Kobe Bryant  had 19 points, nine assists and seven
rebounds for the Lakers (33-31), who have won 16 of their past
22 games since starting the season 17-25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
