Denizbank AS (DENIZ) , a unit of Russia’s
OAO Sberbank, is in talks to buy  Citigroup Inc. (C) ’s Turkish
consumer-banking unit as the U.S. lender pulls back from some
 emerging markets .  Denizbank confirmed the negotiations in a statement to the
 Istanbul Stock Exchange  today. Citigroup said Dec. 5 it would
sell or scale back consumer operations in Turkey, Pakistan,
Romania, Uruguay and Paraguay as the New York-based bank cuts
costs. Commercial and corporate-banking services in Turkey will
continue, Citigroup said.  Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN) , the nation’s largest bank by
market value, on Feb. 14 denied press reports it was involved in
the process of buying the Turkish consumer unit. Garanti,
Fibabanka AS, Denizbank and Odeabank, the Turkish unit of
Lebanon’s Banque Audi sal-Audi Saradar Group, were on the
shortlist to buy the Citigroup unit, Reuters reported on Feb.
