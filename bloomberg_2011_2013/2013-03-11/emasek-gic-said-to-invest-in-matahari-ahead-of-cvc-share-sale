Temasek Holdings Pte,  Singapore ’s
state investment fund, is among 15 investors that are buying
almost one-third of a CVC Capital Partners Ltd.-led offering of
PT Matahari Department Store shares, said a person with
knowledge of the matter.  Temasek’s Fullerton Fund Management Co. and funds managed
by  Government of Singapore Investment Corp .,  Blackrock Inc. (BLK)  and
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. will be so-called cornerstone investors
in the $1.36 billion sale, the person said, asking not to be
identified as the information is private. Together, the funds
have agreed to buy about 32 percent of the offering, or about
$435 million of stock, the person said.  CVC and  Indonesia ’s  Lippo Group (226)  control 98 percent of
Matahari through an entity called Asia Color Co. GIC is also an
investor in Asia Color, the person said. The investors are
selling a 40 percent stake in the department store operator
after setting a price range of 10,000 rupiah ($1.03) to 11,250
rupiah per share for the sale, three people with knowledge of
the matter said last week.  Spokesmen for GIC and Fullerton declined to comment on the
investments. Reuters reported on the cornerstone investors
earlier today, without citing anyone. CVC and its partners are
meeting investors starting today and a final price for the
offering will be set on March 21, according to the person.  Cornerstone investors typically receive guaranteed
allocation in a stock offering in return for agreeing not to
sell the shares for a certain period of time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
