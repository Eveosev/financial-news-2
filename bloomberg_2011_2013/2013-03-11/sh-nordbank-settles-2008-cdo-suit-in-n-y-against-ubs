HSH Nordbank AG, the German
regional lender, settled a lawsuit it filed against  UBS AG (UBS)  over
losses on a collateralized debt obligation linked to the U.S.
subprime-mortgage market.  HSH Nordbank, based in Hamburg, sued UBS in February 2008
over losses on a CDO called North Street 2002-4. HSH Nordbank
said in the suit that its predecessor, Landesbank Schleswig-
Holstein, lost almost all of the $500 million it invested in the
CDO in March 2002.  The two sides have reached a settlement, the terms of which
are confidential, Isaac Nesser, an attorney with Quinn Emanuel
Urquhart & Sullivan LLP representing Nordbank, and Daniel J.
Kramer, a lawyer with Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison LLP
representing Zurich-based UBS, said in telephone interviews.  HSH Nordbank is one of a group of regional German lenders
that have sued in  New York  courts over mortgage-backed
securities. It sued  Bank of America Corp.  in New York State
Supreme Court in December over $218 million in such investments,
and has filed suits against  Barclays Plc (BARC) ,  Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS)  and  Morgan Stanley (MS)  in the same court.  CDOs package assets such as mortgage bonds and buyout loans
and use the income from that debt to pay investors in the new
securities. The collapse of the U.S. market for subprime loans
revealed the risk of such investments.  The case is HSH Nordbank AG v.  UBS AG (UBSN) , 600562/2008, New
York State Supreme Court, New York County ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
