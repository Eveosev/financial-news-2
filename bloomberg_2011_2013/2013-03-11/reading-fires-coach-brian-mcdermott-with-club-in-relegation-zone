Reading fired manager Brian
McDermott after a run of four defeats left the English soccer
club in danger of being relegated from the Premier League.  McDermott, 51, led Reading back into  England ’s elite
division last year after taking over in 2009. The team is in
second-last place with nine games remaining, and owner Anton Zingarevich said he needed to make a change.  “The search for a successor will start immediately and it
is hoped that a new manager will be in place as soon as possible
to lead the fight against potential relegation,” read a
 statement  on Reading’s website last night.  Defeats to Stoke, Wigan and Everton followed by a 2-1 home
loss to Aston Villa left Reading on 23 points, four adrift of
safety. The last three teams get relegated to the Championship
and dropping out of the Premier League would mean they would
miss out on a share of a record television agreement worth about
5 billion pounds ($7.4 billion) over the next three seasons.  Reading travels to league leader Manchester United in four
days. Paolo Di Canio, who resigned as Swindon manager last month,
and PSV Eindhoven coach Dick Advocaat are among the favorites to
replace McDermott, the U.K.’s Daily Telegraph reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
