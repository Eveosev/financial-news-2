The  Baltimore Ravens  agreed to
trade receiver Anquan Boldin to the San Francisco 49ers for a
sixth-round draft pick, the Baltimore Sun reported on Twitter
without saying where it got the information.  Boldin, 32, scored the Ravensâ€™ first touchdown in their
Super Bowl victory over the 49ers on a 13-yard pass from  Joe
Flacco . Boldin caught 65 passes this season for 921 yards and
four touchdowns.  The Sun, citing people in the National Football League,
reported that Boldin refused to take a $2 million pay cut this
season from the $6 million he was scheduled to make.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
