India’s annual car sales are poised
to decline for the first time in a decade as faster inflation,
 slowing economic growth  and high  interest rates  continue to keep
buyers from showrooms.  Local deliveries declined 4.6 percent to 1.71 million cars
in the 11 months ended in February, according to the  Society of
Indian Automobile Manufacturers . Annual deliveries last declined
in the year ended March 2003, the group said.  Carmakers from  Suzuki Motor Corp. (7269)  to Ford Motor Co. are
introducing new models and variants, and offering discounts as
the industry group in January lowered its full-year domestic car
sales forecast for the third time in six months as demand wanes.
February car sales fell 26 percent to 158,513 units, the biggest
monthly drop since December 2000, the group said.  “ India’s economy  is not doing very well,” Sugato Sen, the
deputy director general of the group, said in  New Delhi  today.
“In such times, the discretionary purchases get hit first and
small cars have been affected the most.”  The slowdown in India comes as the European auto market is
set to shrink for a sixth consecutive year, according to IHS
Automotive research. In contrast, China’s passenger-vehicle
market had its strongest start since 2010, with wholesale
deliveries rising 20 percent to 2.84 million units in January
and February.  ‘Bottoming Out’  Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL) , the local unit of Suzuki, closed
one of its factories for a day last week to pare inventory. The
automaker said March 1 that domestic deliveries fell 9 percent
in February, led by a 16 percent drop in its mini-car sales.  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  said on March 1 its sales in India last
month fell 7.6 percent to 34,002 vehicles.  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) ,
maker of the world’s cheapest car, the Nano, reported a 70
percent drop in passenger-vehicle sales for February to the
lowest in a decade.  “We still hope we’re bottoming out and hope we’ll improve
in future,” said Sen.  Asia’s third-biggest economy expanded 4.5 percent in the
three months through Dec. 31 from a year earlier, the weakest
pace in almost four years, a report showed Feb. 28.  The  consumer-price gauge  in January surged 10.79 percent,
one of the highest levels in major economies. The  Reserve Bank 
of India’s benchmark repurchase rate remains the highest among
major Asian economies even after Governor Duvvuri Subbarao cut
it on Jan. 29 by 25 basis points to 7.75 percent in the first
reduction since April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
