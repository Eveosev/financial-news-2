CPC Corp. bought 55,000 metric tons
of full-range naphtha for delivery to Kaohsiung,  Taiwan , in
April, according to two traders who participate in the market.  The company bought the cargo last week at a premium of
about $23 a ton to Japan prices from an unidentified seller, the
people said, asking not to be named because the information is
