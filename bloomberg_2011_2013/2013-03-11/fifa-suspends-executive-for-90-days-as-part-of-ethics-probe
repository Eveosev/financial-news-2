FIFA, soccer’s governing body,
suspended  Sri Lanka ’s Vernon Manilal Fernando from its executive
committee for 90 days as part of an ethics probe.  Fernando’s suspension comes at the request of Michael J.
Garcia, chairman of the ethics committee’s investigative arm,
and Hans-Joachim Eckert, who oversees the adjudicatory panel,
which considers any procedural steps needed, FIFA said today in
an e-mailed statement.  FIFA said formal ethics charges were brought by the
investigatory chamber, which started a probe in October. The
governing body didn’t detail what charges Fernando faces.
Fernando, 63, won’t be able to take part in any soccer-related
activities for 90 days. He joined the Executive Committee in
2011.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
