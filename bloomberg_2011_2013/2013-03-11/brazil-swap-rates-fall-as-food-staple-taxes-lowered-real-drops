Brazil ’s swap rates fell after
President Dilma Rousseff announced cuts in taxes on food staples
to curb inflation, reviving speculation that the central bank
will refrain from increasing borrowing costs.  Swap rates due in January 2014 decreased 10 basis points,
or 0.10 percentage point, to 7.86 percent at 10:06 a.m. in Sao
Paulo. They climbed 34 basis points last week in the biggest
five-day increase since May. The real declined almost 0.1
percent to 1.9452 per dollar today.  “The government is taking action so that the inflation
outlook doesn’t get much worse,”  Gustavo Rangel , the chief
economist for Latin America at ING Group, said in a telephone
interview from  London .  Eliminating the 9.25 percent PIS/Cofins taxes on staple
foodstuffs will rein in prices and stimulate the economy as
Brazilians are able to save and consume more, Rousseff said in a
televised address March 8. The measure will reduce tax revenue
by 7.3 billion reais annually.  Swap rates rose to a six-month high on March 8 after the
government reported that its IPCA index of consumer prices
climbed 6.31 percent in February from a year earlier, the
highest annual rate in 14 months.  Policy makers dropped a pledge to keep borrowing costs
unchanged for a “prolonged period” from their statement
accompanying the decision last week to leave the target lending
 rate  at a record low 7.25 percent.  Economists cut their 2014 economic growth forecasts in a
survey published today. Gross domestic product will expand 3.50
percent next year, according to the median estimate of about 100
analysts surveyed by the central bank, down from the prior
projection of 3.65 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
