The  New York  Giants and former
Philadelphia Eagles defensive tackle  Cullen Jenkins  agreed to a
three-year, $8 million contract,  USA Today reported , citing a
person familiar with the negotiations it didn’t identify.  Jenkins, 32, was cut by the Eagles last month after
starting all 32 games the past two seasons and totaling 9 1/2
sacks and 56 tackles for the Giants’ division rivals. He’ll
receive $3 million in guaranteed money, USA Today said.  A nine-year National Football League veteran with 38 1/2
career sacks, Jenkins signed with Philadelphia before the 2011
season. He was set to make $5.5 million this year and the Eagles
opted to release him as they continue to rebuild after compiling
a 12-20 record over the past two seasons,  USA Today  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
