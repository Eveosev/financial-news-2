The BP Plc-led Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan
pipeline shipped less Azeri oil in the first two months of the
year as the country’s crude production declined.  The BTC link carried 4.9 million metric tons of oil through
February, down 6.2 percent from a year earlier, according to
data published today on the  website  of State Oil Co. of
 Azerbaijan , or Socar, a partner in the project.  Azerbaijan, the largest oil producer in the former  Soviet
Union  after Russia and Kazakhstan, produced 3.8 million tons of
oil in January, down 3.1 percent from a year earlier, the State
Statistics Committee based in the capital, Baku, said Feb. 14.  The country pumped 43 million tons of oil in 2012, a 5.3
percent decline from 2011. Production of marketable natural gas
rose 5.4 percent to 17.2 billion cubic meters, it said.  The 1,768-kilometer (1,100-mile) BTC link connecting the
Azerbaijan Caspian Sea coast with  Turkey ’s Mediterranean port of
Ceyhan, via  Georgia , also exported 301,703 tons of Turkmen oil
in February, down from 326,676 tons, according to Socar data.  Azerbaijan shipped 4.6 million tons of oil through the
Ceyhan port in the first two months, down 3.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
