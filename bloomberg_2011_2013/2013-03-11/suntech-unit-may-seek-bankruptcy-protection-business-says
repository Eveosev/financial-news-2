Wuxi Suntech Power Co. , a unit of
Suntech Power Holdings Co., may seek  bankruptcy protection 
between March 15 and March 20, the China Business Journal

acquire the stakes in the unit afterwards and lead its
restructuring, the report said.  Suntech declined to comment on the report. Two calls to
Wuxi Guolian went unanswered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
