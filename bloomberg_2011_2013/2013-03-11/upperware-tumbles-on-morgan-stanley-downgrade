Tupperware Brands Corp. (TUP) , the direct
seller of household storage containers, fell the most in more
than nine months after Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock,
saying foreign-currency exchange rates may hurt earnings.  Tupperware dropped 4 percent to $76.10 at the close in New
for the biggest decline since June 1. The  Orlando , Florida-based
company’s  shares  had gained 24 percent this year through March
8, compared with an 8.8 percent gain for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index.  With 90 percent of its sales outside of the U.S. and 61
percent in emerging economies, any material change in the dollar
would have a significant impact on Tupperware, Dara Mohsenian,
an analyst at Morgan Stanley in  New York , wrote in a note on
March 8. She cut her  rating  on the shares to equal-weight, the
equivalent of a hold.  Tupperware also raised its dividend 72 percent and
announced a $2 billion share buyback in January, removing the
possibility of returning more cash to shareholders as a catalyst
to spur the stock, Mohsenian wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
