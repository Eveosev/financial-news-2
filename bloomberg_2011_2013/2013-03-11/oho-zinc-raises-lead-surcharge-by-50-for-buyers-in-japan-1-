Toho Zinc Co. (5707) , a Japanese non-
ferrous metal smelter, said it raised fees on lead sales by 50
percent for the year starting in April, increasing costs for
battery makers.  The Tokyo-based company, which is  Japan ’s biggest refiner
of lead and second-biggest of zinc, pushed the  surcharge  buyers
pay over the London Metal Exchange’s cash price for lead to the
highest level in at least 20 years, said Kimiyasu Marusaki, who
oversees sales of the metal. He declined to disclose the fee,
which also includes delivery costs, or identify affected
customers.  “The increase is in line with a jump in U.S. premiums,”
Marusaki said in an interview on March 8. Fees in the U.S. rose
as prices of raw materials and scrap batteries jumped, while
some producers also closed operations, tightening supply, he
said.  Buyers in the U.S. are  paying  14 cents per pound more than
the LME’s cash price for lead, according to Metal Bulletin Plc
data. The premium in  Europe  this year almost doubled from 2012
to 100 euros ($130) to 150 euros a metric ton, four traders with
direct knowledge of the sales said in January.  Lead for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange fell 0.3 percent to $2,206.25 a ton at 4:51 p.m. Tokyo
time, while zinc was down 0.3 percent at $1,969 a ton. Shares of
Toho rose 0.3 percent to close at 390 yen today.  Toho said in October that it would produce 92,000 tons of
lead and 91,000 tons of zinc in the 12 months ending March 31.
Marusaki said the target remained unchanged and that Toho would
announce plans for the next half year in early April.  The company shut its  Chigirishima  lead smelter in Hiroshima
for 20 days for scheduled maintenance on March 3, Marusaki said.  There are no plans to suspend operations at the Annaka and
Onahama zinc smelters, which were halted for at least two months
last year after Tokyo Electric Power Co. raised electricity
rates for some big users by an average of 17 percent.  The Annaka smelter has an annual capacity of 139,200 tons
of zinc, according to the company. The Onahama plant processes
two-thirds of the zinc concentrate required by the Annaka
smelter.  To contact the reporters on this story:
