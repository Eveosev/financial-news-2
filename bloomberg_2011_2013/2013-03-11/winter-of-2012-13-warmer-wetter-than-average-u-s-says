The winter of 2012-2013 had above-
average precipitation, providing some optimism for crop yields
amid a historic drought.  The average temperature for December through February was
34.3 degrees Fahrenheit (1.3 Celsius) in the contiguous 48
states, 1.9 degrees above the 20th-century average, making the
season the 20th-warmest on records going back to 1895, according
to the  State of the Climate  report issued by the National
Climatic Data Center.  Precipitation  for the three months  that constitute
meteorological winter was 7.1 inches, 0.63 inch above the
average of the past century, said the center, a unit of the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Major storms in
February helped that month reach near-average moisture.  “The general thinking is this is all good for resolving
drought conditions in the U.S. and increasing yields of corn and
wheat,” said Gail Martell, president of Martell Crop
Projections in Whitefish Bay,  Wisconsin . “Not all of that
moisture was absorbed. In the Upper Midwest, a lot of the soil
is still frozen.”  At the end of February, 54.2 percent of the contiguous U.S.
was experiencing moderate-to-exceptional drought, a smaller area
than the 57.7 percent at the end of January, according to the
 U.S. Drought Monitor . Those dryness levels covered 62.7 percent
of the region in November, double the extent of the previous
year. It’s been the worst drought since the 1930s.  Mixed Blessing  The wetter weather could be a mixed blessing, Martell said.
Warming temperatures high above the equatorial Pacific may mean
wetness continuing into the spring and possibly delaying
planting season at the end of April. Calendar spring for the
Northern Hemisphere begins March 20.  “The wetness could get to be too much of a good thing,”
she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
