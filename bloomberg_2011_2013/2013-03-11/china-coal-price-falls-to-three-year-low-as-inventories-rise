The benchmark price for  China ’s
power-station coal fell to the lowest in more than three years
as increased imports of the fuel boosted stockpiles amid a
slowdown in power generation.  Spot coal with an energy value of 5,500 kilocalories per
kilogram at the port of Qinhuangdao was at a range of 615  yuan 
($98.85) to 625 yuan a metric ton as of yesterday, down 5 yuan
from the week before, according to data today from the China
Coal Transport and Distribution Association. That’s the lowest
price since Oct. 19, 2009, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Stockpiles of the fuel at the port rose 3.6 percent
to 7.45 million tons, the highest in a month.  China’s  electricity output growth  slowed to 3.4 percent in
the first two months of 2013 from December’s 7.6 percent as
industrial production had the weakest start to a year since
2009, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed Mar. 9.
The nation  imported  53.85 million tons of coal in January and
February, 34 percent higher than a year earlier, the General
Administration of Customs said March 8.  “Relatively high stockpiles and weak power generation
weigh on domestic coal prices,”  Helen Lau , an analyst at UOB
Kay-Hian Ltd. in  Hong Kong , said by phone. “The government’s
efforts in energy conservation and pollution reduction may also
curb a recovery in prices.”  The government plans to reduce the nation’s carbon
emissions and energy use per unit of gross domestic product by
at least 3.7 percent in 2013, the National Development and
Reform Commission, China’s top economic planner, said in a
report March 5. The country cut  energy intensity  by 3.6 percent
last year, beating a target of 3.5 percent.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
