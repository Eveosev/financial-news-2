Airbus SAS’s chief salesman said
he’s confident the planemaker will pass 2,000 orders for the
A320neo by month’s end, meaning he expects to log orders for
about 120 additional planes worth $12 billion at list price.  Airbus has 1,878 firm orders for the series, meaning it
would need only 122 orders to reach 2,000,  John Leahy , who run
sales at the Toulouse, France-based planemaker, told aircraft
brokers at the ISTAT conference in  Orlando  today. The A320neo
sells for $100 million, with the price lower for the 319neo and
higher for the A321neo. Customers typically get discounts.  Since Airbus first committed in December 2010 to offering
its existing single-aisle series with new engines, airlines have
rushed in to make it Airbus’s best-selling plane ever.  Deutsche
Lufthansa AG (LHA) , which has already ordered 30, has said it’s
looking to buy 100 short- to mid-range planes. And  Turkish
Airlines (THYAO)  is also considering an order for at least 100 single-
aisle planes, according to the airline.  The A320neo, which offers two engine choices, is scheduled
for entry into service in October 2015.  Boeing Co. (BA) , which
originally balked at offering a re-engined version of its own,
single aisle 737, has followed suit with a plane now known as
the 737 Max. That plane, which has won 1,185 orders, is scheduled
for delivery two years after the Airbus model.  ISTAT is the International Society of Transport Aircraft
