European  stocks  fell from a 4 1/2-
year high and Italian bonds retreated after  Fitch Ratings 
downgraded the nation’s debt. Oil declined as  Saudi Arabia 
boosted output, and metals slipped after China’s industrial
production trailed estimates.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index dropped as much as 0.3 percent
as of 9:45 a.m. in  London , while Standard & Poor’s 500 futures
fell 0.1 percent.  Italy ’s 10-year  yield  rose four basis points
to 4.64 percent. Copper lost 0.7 percent and zinc as much as 1.5
percent in London. West Texas Intermediate crude fell from a
one-week high. The Hungarian forint weakened amid changes at the
country’s central bank.  Fitch cut Italy’s debt rating after the close of equity
markets on March 8 as European Union leaders prepared for a
March 14-15 summit to discuss financial-rescue terms for Cyprus.
China’s industrial output had the weakest start to a year since
2009 and retail sales growth slowed, data in the past two days
showed. The Dollar  Index (SXXP)  traded near its highest level in seven
months before a report this week that economists said will show
retail sales improved.  “I do get a sense that the market has extended itself
compared to the potential threat to the system,” said Yianos Kontopoulos, chief investment officer in  Athens  at Eurobank
Ergasias SA. “All these issues, like the Fitch rating, will be
used by the market to sell.”  Stoxx Decline  The Stoxx 600 slipped from the highest level since June
2008 after climbing 2.3 percent last week. Storebrand ASA
slumped 8.2 percent to a six-month low in Oslo after Norway’s
second-largest insurer said it will need to increase the amount
of money it sets aside for longer  life expectancy . ICAP Plc, the
world’s largest broker of transactions between banks, lost 3.8
percent as UBS AG downgraded the shares to sell.  The decline in S&P 500 futures indicated the U.S. gauge
will snap a six-day rally that has pushed the index to the
highest level since October 2007.  Japan ’s  Topix (TPX)  Index advanced as Honda Motor Co., which gets
about 80 percent of its revenue outside Japan, rose 2.6 percent.
The Topix has jumped 41 percent in the 74 days since the biggest
rally for Japanese shares since 1987 began in November. After
adjusting for the yen’s depreciation against the dollar, the
return shrinks to 18 percent, or three percentage points more
than the  S&P 500 , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Italy Downgrade  Fitch cut Italy’s credit rating one level to BBB+ with a
negative outlook, saying an inconclusive election in February
has produced political paralysis that threatens the country’s
ability to respond to a recession and the  European debt crisis .
The grade is three levels above junk and one higher than  Spain .  German 10-year bund yields fell three basis points to 1.50
percent. The euro was little changed at $1.3004 and 124.97 yen.
Japan’s currency traded at 96.10 per dollar.  The cost of insuring against losses on French government
debt jumped 4.5 percent after a report showed output from
factories, mines, utilities and the  construction industry  fell
1.2 percent in January. Credit-default swaps protecting French
sovereign debt increased 3.5 basis points to 78. Contracts on
Italy climbed 6.5 basis points to 264.  The Hungarian forint retreated 1.2 percent versus the euro,
sliding for a second day to the weakest level since June 1. The
Hungarian central bank will complete management changes by the
end of March, it said in a statement on its website today.
Gyorgy Matolcsy, Magyar Nemzeti Bank’s new president, moved to
solidify his authority by stripping two vice presidents
appointed by his predecessor of their areas of responsibility,
according to the regulator’s new articles of association
published in the official gazette on March 8.  Kenyan Shilling  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  fell 0.1 percent from a
two-week high. The Kenyan shilling strengthened 0.4 percent
versus the dollar after Uhuru Kenyatta won the country’s March 4
presidential election with 50.07 percent of the vote. His main
rival,  Raila Odinga , plans to challenge the outcome in court.
Last week’s election was the first since a disputed presidential
vote in 2007 that triggered ethnic clashes in which more than
1,100 people died.  WTI, the U.S. crude benchmark, fell as much as 43 cents to
$91.52 a barrel on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange. Saudi
Arabia’s output rose in February from a 20-month low, according
to an official with knowledge of the country’s oil policy.  Copper for three-month delivery fell to $7,688 a metric ton
on the London Metal Exchange. Zinc retreated 1.4 percent to
