Treasuries declined, pushing 30-
year yields up for a sixth day in the longest stretch since
2007, as the U.S. prepared to auction $66 billion in notes and
bonds this week.  Ten-year  yields  closed at an 11-month high before a retail
sales report this week forecast to add to signs the U.S. economy
is gaining momentum. Bets the  Federal Reserve ’s effort to spur
growth is working damped demand for government  bonds  after data
last week showed the jobless rate unexpectedly fell to a four-
year low. Another report this week may show consumer prices
increased for the first time in four months. Stocks rose.  “There’s been a very slow grind today to set up for the
auctions,” said Jason Rogan, director of U.S. government
trading at Guggenheim Partners LLC, a New York-based brokerage
for institutional investors. “There seems to be enough interest
in the market; 2.05 and 2.06 percent will bring in enough
interest. A lot of people out there have been a little eager to
see strong growth in the  U.S. economy .”  Thirty-year bond  yields rose two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 3.26 percent at 5 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The price on the 3.125
percent securities maturing in February 2043 dropped 9/32, or
$2.81 per $1,000 face amount, to 97 14/32. The yield increased
as much as three basis points to 3.27 percent today. They last
rose for six straight days in May 2007.  Benchmark 10-year note  yields  increased two basis points to
close at 2.06 percent, the highest since April 5, 2012. They
touched 2.07 percent, approaching the 11-month intraday high of
2.08 percent they reached on March 8.  U.S. stocks rose, with the  Dow Jones Industrial Average 
reaching a record high for a fifth straight day.  Yield Curve  The difference between the yields on two-year and 10-year
notes, called the yield curve, increased to as much as 1.82
percentage points, approaching the widest since April 2012. It
averaged 1.5 percentage points over the past year.  Treasury securities  due in 10 years and more are trading at
the cheapest level since 2011 relative to global peers with
similar maturities, Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes show.
Yields on the Treasuries were 54 basis points higher on March 8
than those in an index of other sovereign debt due in 10 years
and more, the indexes show. It was the most since August 2011.  The U.S. will sell $32 billion in three-year notes
tomorrow. The previous three-year note sale, an offering of the
same size on Feb. 12, drew a yield of 0.411 percent, compared
with a forecast of 0.409 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of
seven of the Fed’s 21 primary dealers. The record-low three-year
auction yield of 0.327 percent was reached Dec. 11.  Demand Gauge  The Feb. 12 auction’s  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges
demand by comparing total bids with the amount of notes offered,
was 3.59, matching the average for the previous 10 sales.  The Treasury will auction $21 billion of 10-year securities
March 13 and $13 billion of 30-year bonds the next day.  “The supply this week is the big thing,” said Thomas Roth, senior Treasury trader in  New York  at Mitsubishi UFJ
Securities USA Inc.  U.S. retail  sales  advanced in February for a fourth month,
rising 0.5 percent, according to the median estimate of
economists in a Bloomberg News survey before the Commerce
Department reports the data on March 13. they gained 0.1 percent
in January.  The U.S. cost of living rose 0.5 percent in February,
economists forecast a March 15 report from the Labor Department
will show. It was little changed in January and December and
dropped in November.  ‘Overwhelmingly Strong’  “The data has been overwhelmingly strong,” Roth said.
“The Fed is obviously lowering rates and helping the economy,
and that’s what’s going on.”  U.S. government securities maturing in more than a year
lost 0.3 percent in the past month, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies.  Treasury yields climbed 20 basis points in the five days
ended March 8, the biggest weekly gain in a year, amid the
stronger-than-forecast employment report. U.S. payrolls
increased by 236,000 jobs last month, versus the 165,000 that
economists forecast. The  unemployment rate  fell to 7.7 percent,
from 7.9 percent.  The Fed purchased $1.46 billion today in Treasuries due
from February 2036 to February 2043.  The U.S. central bank has been buying $85 billion of
Treasury and mortgage bonds each month under the quantitative-
easing stimulus strategy since the start of the year. The effort
is designed to try to hold down borrowing costs and encourage
economic growth.  Volume Rises  The central bank has also kept its benchmark  interest-rate 
target for overnight lending between banks in a range of zero to
0.25 percent since 2008 to support the economy.  Policy makers reiterated after their January meeting the
rate will stay low as long as unemployment is above 6.5 percent
and inflation is projected at no more than 2.5 percent. The
 Federal Open Market Committee  meets next on March 19-20.  Trading  volume  dropped 52 percent today to $184 billion,
the least since touching the 2013 low of $183 billion on March
4, according to ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of
 U.S. government debt . Volume increased to $384 billion on March
8, the highest since Feb. 26. Average daily Treasuries volume
for the past year was $248 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
