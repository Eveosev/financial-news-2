Helvetia Holding AG (HELN) ,  Switzerland ’s
fourth-biggest insurer, increased its full-year dividend by 6.3
percent after full-year profit rose on higher investment income
and improving non-life results.  The insurer will pay a dividend of 17 Swiss francs ($18) a
share, up from 16 francs in 2011,  St. Gallen , Switzerland-based
Helvetia said in a statement on its website today. Net income
advanced to 339.6 million francs from 288.2 million francs a
year earlier. That beat the 335.3 million-franc average estimate
of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Helvetia, which generates more than half of its revenue in
Switzerland, pursues “an active mergers and acquisitions
strategy” and has said it may use part of the 4.1 billion
francs in equity it held at the end of 2012 for purchases in
countries such as Germany and  Italy . It last year took over the
transport portfolio of Gan Eurocourtage, a subsidiary of
Groupama SA, making it  France ’s No. 2 transport insurer.  “Our 2012 year-end result shows that we have effectively
managed the challenges of a demanding market environment,” said
Chief Executive Officer Stefan Loacker. “The acquisitions
support our growth and our confidence that we will profitably
serve our existing markets in the long term, too.”  Investment income increased 34 percent to 1.18 billion
francs after an investment performance of 5.5 percent. Operating
profit in non-life, the insurer’s biggest unit, rose 33 percent
to 180.6 million francs, Helvetia said.  The company in November completed its purchase of SEV
Versicherungen and said it will buy a 51 percent stake in Chiara
Assicurazioni SpA from Italy’s  Banco di Desio e della Brianza
SpA (BDB)  for 17 million euros ($22 million), while raising its stake
in Chiara Vita SpA to 100 percent from 70 percent for 22.5
million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
