Japanese shares rose, with the
 Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  posting its longest daily winning
streak since 2009, after better-than-forecast U.S. hiring and a
weaker yen boosted the earnings outlook for exporters.  Honda Motor Co., which gets about 80 percent of its sales
outside Japan, rose 2.6 percent. Resona Holdings Inc. and
Shinsei Bank Ltd. surged amid speculation the lenders will
follow Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings Inc. in repaying
government bailouts.  Sharp Corp. (6753)  lost 3.1 percent after Kyodo
news reported the electronics maker may sell shares.  The Nikkei 225 rose 0.5 percent to close at 12,349.05 in
Tokyo. The measure last week recovered its losses since the 2008
collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. on optimism Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe and his nominee for  Bank of Japan  governor,
 Haruhiko Kuroda , will succeed in ending 15 years of deflation.
The broader  Topix Index (TPX)  increased 1.9 percent 1,039.98 today.
About four shares rose for each that fell and all but two
industry groups gained.  “The  U.S. economy  leads the global economy, so positive
data boosts investor sentiment,” said  Naoki Fujiwara , chief
 fund manager  at Shinkin Asset Management Co., which oversees
about 498 billion yen ($5.18 billion). “Until now, Japanese
shares have risen on the back of Abenomics and monetary-easing
expectations from the BOJ. From here on, U.S. fundamentals
should contribute to a higher-dollar, weaker-yen situation.”  Abe Surge  The Nikkei 225 jumped 42 through March 8 from Nov. 14 when
the general election that swept Abe into power was announced.
The equity benchmark’s gain in the period compares with a 7.7
percent rise in  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index, a 13 percent rally
for  China ’s Shanghai Composite Index and a 14 percent advance
for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  After adjusting for the yen’s depreciation against the
dollar, the Nikkei 225’s return shrinks to about 19 percent.  The yen traded at 96.13 per dollar today, its weakest level
since Aug. 10, 2009. A weaker yen boost overseas earnings for
the nation’s exporters when repatriated.  Honda rose 2.6 percent to 3,755 yen, giving the Nikkei 225
its biggest boost. Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s biggest
carmaker, rose 1.8 percent to 5,000 yen. Olympus Corp., which
gets nearly 20 percent of its sales from  North America , advanced
2.9 percent to 2,371 yen, its highest since October 2011.  Futures on the  S&P 500  were little changed today. The gauge
gained 0.5 percent on March 8, when data showed U.S. employers
added 236,000 jobs. The median forecast of economists surveyed
by Bloomberg was for a gain of 165,000. The jobless rate fell to
7.7 percent.  Short-Selling  The ratio of short selling to total trading value at the
Tokyo Stock Exchange fell to 12 percent on March 8, the lowest
since the exchange began releasing data in October 2008. The
Nikkei 225 capped a 5.8 percent gain last week, with the measure
rising for all but one week since mid-November.  “While there may have been some short-covering last week,
I think most of the gains were on fundamental reasons,” said
Shinkin’s Fujiwara. “In  Japan , I think a lot of individual
investors are starting to pile-in. Foreign investors are also
buying, and as long as they hedge, they shouldn’t see a problem
from the currency devaluations when repatriating.”  Shares rose as Kuroda said the BOJ will consider buying
derivatives if he’s confirmed as governor and signaled a
readiness to buy more bonds more quickly.  Stocks gained even after data showed the country’s
machinery orders plunged 13 percent in January, the biggest
decline in eight months, and worse than the 1.7 percent decline
predicted by an economists’ survey.  Exiting Bailout  Resona Holdings advanced 14 percent to 531 yen and Shinsei
Bank gained 8.4 percent to 245 percent on speculation they would
follow Sumitomo Mitsui Trust in repaying public funds.  Sumitomo Mitsui Trust rose 2.3 percent to 437 yen after
saying it bought 467 million of its own shares from the
government.  Among stocks that dropped, Sharp lost 3.1 percent to 309
yen, the second-biggest drop on the Nikkei 225. Kyodo news
reported the company plans to raise about 100 billion yen by
selling shares to repay about half its 200 billion yen of
convertible bonds due in September.  The Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index fell 0.6 percent
to 26.49 today, indicating traders expect a swing of about 7.3
percent on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days. Volume on
the Nikkei 225 was about 28 percent higher than the 30-day
average at the close.  To contact the reporter on this story:
