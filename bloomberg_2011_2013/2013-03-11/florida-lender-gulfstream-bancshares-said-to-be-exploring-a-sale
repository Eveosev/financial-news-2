Gulfstream Bancshares Inc. , a
closely held  Florida  business lender with four branches and
equity of about $66 million, has put itself up for sale, said
two people with knowledge of the matter.  Hovde Financial Inc., an Inverness, Illinois-based
investment bank that advises small lenders, is handling a sale
process for Gulfstream, said the people, who asked not to be
identified because the process is private.  Gulfstream, based in Stuart, Florida, had about $550
million in assets at year-end, according to the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. It may solicit interest from rival Florida banks
with $1 billion to $3 billion in assets, said one of the people
familiar with the situation. Banks of that size that compete
directly with Gulfstream include Seacoast Banking Corp. of
Florida,  Centerstate Banks Inc. (CSFL)  and  1st United Bancorp Inc. (FUBC) ,
according to regulatory data.  Brian Avril, Gulfstream’s chief financial officer, and
Steven Hovde, chief executive officer at Hovde Financial, didn’t
return calls seeking comment. Representatives for Seacoast,
Centerstate and 1st United didn’t respond to messages seeking
comment.  Gulfstream’s net income rose almost 16 percent to $4.2
million in 2012,  according to the FDIC . It had total equity of
$65.6 million, FDIC data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
