Nissan Motor Co. (7201) ,  Japan ’s second-
largest automaker, put its electric-vehicle business under the
direct supervision of the chief operating officer after sales of
the Leaf missed the company’s expectations.  Toshiyuki Shiga will oversee zero emission vehicle strategy
and the battery business starting April 1, Nissan said in an e-
mail. Hideaki Watanabe, corporate vice president at the electric
car division, was moved to supplier  Calsonic Kansei Corp. (7248) , where
he will be senior vice president.  Deliveries of Nissan’s flagship electric car in the U.S.
failed to reach even half of the 20,000 units the Yokohama,
Japan-based automaker had targeted last year. Lower-than-
anticipated demand for zero-emission cars has been a blow to
Nissan Chief Executive Officer Carlos Ghosn, who’s forecast that
electric cars would become so popular that they’d account for at
least 10 percent of global auto sales by the end of the decade.  “Chief Operating Officer Shiga is taking direct
responsibility of zero emission efforts because the business is
Nissan’s top priority which requires global and cross-functional
efforts,” Chris Keeffe, a spokesman for the carmaker said by
phone, declining to elaborate on the personnel changes.  Nissan cut prices of the Leaf, improved its battery range
and introduced an entry-level model last year to boost sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
