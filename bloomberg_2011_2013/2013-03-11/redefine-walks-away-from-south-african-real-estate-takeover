Redefine Properties Ltd. (RDF)  walked
away from the battle to acquire  Fountainhead Property Trust (FPT)  and
instead announced plans to raise its stake in the Johannesburg-
based company to about a third.  Redefine has been competing with  Growthpoint Properties
Ltd. (GRT)  for control of Fountainhead since last year. Growthpoint,
South Africa’s biggest real-estate investor that owns half of
the V&A Waterfront restaurant and shopping complex in  Cape Town ,
raised its all-share offer for Fountainhead last month.
“The formulation of the Growthpoint offer, and the manner in
which it has been dealt with by the independent committee” at
Fountainhead “has caused protracted delays and uncertainty,”
Johannesburg-based Redefine said in a statement today. “As
Redefine has for some time feared, the uncertainty is now having
a significant detrimental impact on Fountainhead’s assets and
day-to-day business.”  Redefine owns about 18 percent of Fountainhead’s shares, it
said. It will offer to buy as many as 175 million more shares,
which according to Fountainhead equates to a 15 percent stake.  “Redefine resolved some time ago that, if its proposal to
acquire the assets of Fountainhead was not successful, it would
seek to obtain a meaningful stake in Fountainhead,” Redefine
said.  Redefine shares closed 0.9 percent lower at 9.79 rand.
Growthpoint declined by 0.2 percent, while Fountainhead gained
0.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
