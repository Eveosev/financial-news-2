Sauer-Danfoss Inc. (SHS) , a maker of
hydraulic and electronic equipment, was sued by an investor
claiming shareholders will be shortchanged by a $700 million
offer from Danfoss A/S for the shares it doesn’t already own.  Sauer-Danfoss investor C. David Schacher, in a complaint
filed March 8 in Delaware Chancery Court in Wilmington, said
majority shareholder Danfoss’s $58.50-a-share offer to buy the
remaining 24.4 percent stake undervalues the company. Schacher
is asking for class-action status to represent minority
shareholders as a group.  “Given Sauer-Danfoss’s future growth prospects, the
consideration shareholders will receive is inadequate and
undervalues the company,” lawyers for Schacher said in the
lawsuit.  Nordborg, Denmark-based Danfoss’s offer represents a 5.3
percent premium to the highest trading price during the one-year
period before its previous proposal of $49 a share on Nov. 28,
according to a March 1 statement announcing the new offer. The
new offer, which was accepted by the board of directors,
represents a 19.4 percent premium to the prior deal.  Bryan Locke, a spokesman for Ames, Iowa-based Sauer-
Danfoss, wasn’t immediately available to comment on the lawsuit.  Sauer-Danfoss fell 4 cents to $58.76 in  New York  Stock
Exchange trading at 12:43 p.m. The shares rose 8.5 percent to
$58.73 after the latest offer and have traded above the offered
share price since.  The case is Schacher v. Sauer-Danfoss Inc., CA8396,
Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
