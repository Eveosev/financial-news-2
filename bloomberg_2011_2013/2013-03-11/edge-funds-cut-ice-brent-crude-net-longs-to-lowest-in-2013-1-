Hedge funds  and other money
managers cut  bullish bets  on  Brent crude  for the fourth week to
the lowest this year, according to data from ICE Futures  Europe .  Speculative bets that prices will rise, in futures and
options combined, outnumbered long positions by 131,228 lots in
the week to March 5, the London-based exchange said today in its
weekly Commitment of Traders  report . That’s down 18 percent, or
28,588 contracts, from the previous week and is the lowest since
Dec. 25.  Brent prices declined 1 percent to $111.61 a barrel in the
week to March 5 after dropping in the second-half of February.
Futures for April delivery were down 0.7 percent to $110.13 a
barrel as of 12:34 p.m. London time on the ICE exchange.  “For as long as the exodus on the part of money managers
continues, prices cannot be expected to recover,”  Carsten Fritsch , an analyst at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt , said in a
note today.  Bearish positions by producers, merchants, processors and
users of Brent outnumbered bullish positions by 200,246, up from
198,946 the previous week.  Swaps dealers were net-long 101,970 lots, up 30 percent
from a week earlier.  Money managers’ net-long bets on  gasoil  dropped for the
second week by 24 percent to 80,036 contracts, the  data  show.
Net-long positions in gasoil surged to the highest in more than
two years on Feb. 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
