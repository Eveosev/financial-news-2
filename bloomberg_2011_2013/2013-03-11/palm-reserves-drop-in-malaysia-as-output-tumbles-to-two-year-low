(Corrects scope of output decline in headline and text.)  Palm oil  stockpiles in Malaysia,
the world’s second-largest producer, contracted for a second
month in February as production declined more than expected to
the lowest level in 10 months, according to official data.  Inventories shrank 5.2 percent to 2.44 million metric tons,
the Malaysian Palm Oil Board said today, matching the median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey published March 5 and 18 percent
higher than a year ago. Output fell 19 percent to 1.3 million
tons, the lowest level since April and more than the 13 percent
drop estimated in the survey. Exports retreated 14 percent to
1.4 million tons, according to data from the board.  Prices in Kuala Lumpur have dropped 26 percent over the
past year as stockpiles remain near record levels on rising
global oilseed supplies and slowing demand. A  bear market  in
palm is poised to deepen in 2013 as the most-used cooking oil
slumps to less than 2,000 ringgit ($642) a metric ton on
increased global supplies of vegetable oils,  Dorab Mistry ,
director at Godrej International Ltd., said on March 6.  The drop in production will be “near-term positive” for
prices, said Gnanasekar Thiagarajan, director at Mumbai-based
Commtrendz Risk Management Services Pvt. Output may continue to
be at these levels this month, he said.  Palm oil for May delivery ended little changed at 2,450
ringgit a ton on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange, the highest
price at close since Feb. 25.  Production Outlook  January and February are usually the  lowest production 
months in the year. Malaysia may produce 19.5 million tons to
19.7 million tons this year, according to Mistry. That’s more
than the 18.9 million tons forecast by the nation’s palm board
and higher than last year’s output of 18.8 million tons.
Reserves reached a record 2.63 million tons in December.  “Demand is going to be incrementally less, and supply will
be incrementally higher” this year, said Gnanasekar.  Malaysia  said in October it would cut the export tax to
between 4.5 percent and 8.5 percent, from about 23 percent, from
Jan. 1, to clear out the stockpiles. The tariff for March was
4.5 percent after being set at zero in January and February as
the base price was below the threshold that triggers the minimum
rate.  Indonesia , the biggest grower, fixed the duty at 10.5
percent this month.  In the first 10 days of this month, exports from Malaysia
were little changed at 441,025 tons from 440,830 tons in the
same period of February, Intertek said today. Shipments gained
2.2 percent to 438,549 tons in the same period, Societe Generale
de Surveillance said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
