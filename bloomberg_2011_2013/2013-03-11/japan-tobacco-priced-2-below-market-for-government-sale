Japan  priced a stake in the former
tobacco monopoly at 2 percent less than yesterday’s closing
share price as part of a 978 billion yen ($10 billion) sale to
help fund rebuilding after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami.  The Ministry of Finance is selling 253.3 million  Japan
Tobacco Inc. (2914)  shares, a 13 percent stake, at 2,949 yen each,
according to a ministry statement yesterday. The government
earlier sold 80.1 million shares for 230.6 billion yen as part
of the planned reduction in its holdings, it said Feb. 27.  The offering, the country’s largest in three years, comes
after sluggish economic growth in 2012 prompted a delay in the
planned sale. Japan Tobacco climbed to a five-year high on March
7 on expectations a weaker yen would boost profit from overseas,
where the Tokyo-based cigarette-maker got about 54 percent of
operating income last fiscal year.  The government has said spending on post-quake rebuilding
would be partly financed by sales of stakes it holds, including
Japan Tobacco. The budget for the fiscal year ending March 31
includes an estimated 500.3 billion from the Japan Tobacco share
sale, an amount that had been expected to increase to reflect
the gains in market prices.  Japan Tobacco fell 1.4 percent to 2,967 yen as of 10:27
a.m. in Tokyo trading, paring  this year’s gain  to 22 percent
compared with a 19 percent advance for the Nikkei 225 Stock
Average. The shares dropped 3.7 percent to 3,010 yen at the
close of trading in Tokyo yesterday, before the announcement.  Bigger Budget  Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in January increased the
budget for rebuilding after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami by 6
trillion yen to 25 trillion yen. The record 9.0-magnitude
earthquake caused a tsunami that left about 19,000 people dead
or missing and forced the evacuation of 160,000.  The stake sale is the largest in Japan since Dai-ichi Life
Insurance Co.’s $11 billion initial public offering in February
2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The transaction leaves the ministry holding about 33
percent of the company, down from 50 percent. Japan Tobacco
spent 250 billion yen to buy 86.8 million of its own shares to
mitigate the effect of the sale on the market, it said Feb 27.  To contact the reporters on this story:
