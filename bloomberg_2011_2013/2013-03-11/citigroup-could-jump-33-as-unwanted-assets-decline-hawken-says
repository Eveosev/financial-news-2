Shares in  Citigroup Inc. (C) , the
third-biggest  U.S. bank , could increase by about 33 percent in
12 months as the lender reduces unwanted assets and management
cuts costs, according to Brennan Hawken, an analyst at  UBS AG. (UBS)   The stock may rise as the New York-based lender reduces the
amount of money it holds against distressed assets in the  Citi
Holdings  division while losses from the unit also decline,
Hawken wrote in a note to clients today, upgrading his rating to
buy from neutral. Shares could increase to $62 within a year,
Hawken said, 33 percent more than its  closing price  on Friday of
$46.68.  Chief Executive Officer  Michael Corbat  is reducing unwanted
assets in Citi Holdings while firing 11,000 workers and pulling
back from certain markets to improve profit. The division had
about $92 billion of U.S. home loans at the end of 2012, which
should be easier to reduce as the housing market improves,
Hawken wrote.  “We tried to think about which universal banks and brokers
are under-earnings right now and when will a recovery in
earnings become evident,” Hawken wrote. “The most clear
candidate on this front is Citi, given the meaningful earnings
headwind and large amount of trapped capital in Citi Holdings.”  Citigroup gained 10 cents, or less than one percent, to
$46.78 at 11:44 a.m. in New York trading. The stock has gained
18 percent this year, outpacing the 24-company  KBW Bank Index (BKX) ,
which increased 11 percent.  Unwanted Assets  Corbat, 52, used to run Citi Holdings, which was created by
his predecessor  Vikram Pandit , 56, as a home for unwanted and
unprofitable assets in the wake of the bank’s $45 billion
bailout in 2008. Citigroup had $156 billion of total assets in
the division at the end of 2012, down 31 percent from a year
earlier, according to a financial supplement.  The bank is “excessively conservative” in the amount of
money it holds as a buffer against potential losses from the
mortgages in Citi Holdings, Hawken wrote. The company could
release about $2 billion from these reserves in 2013 and $2.2
billion in 2014, according to the note.  “Citi has more capital trapped on its balance sheet than
any other universal bank, and we believe a healing housing
market and moderately improving economic outlook in the U.S.
provides a much needed tailwind for Citi to release it,” Hawken
wrote.  Losses at Citi Holdings should plunge to $1.7 billion this
year and just under $1 billion in 2014, Hawken wrote. This would
compare with losses of $6.56 billion in 2012 and $4.22 billion
in 2011.  Analysts’ Estimates  Moshe Orenbuch, an analyst with Credit Suisse Group AG,
predicts that the division will lose $3.1 billion this year and
$1.7 billion in 2014.  John McDonald  of Sanford C. Bernstein &
Co. projects a $1.63 billion loss in 2013 and an $856 million
loss next year. Both analysts have outperform ratings on the
shares.  Citigroup houses its distressed mortgages within the local
consumer-lending unit of Citi Holdings. Losses there should
tumble to $1.01 billion this year and $370 million in 2014,
Hawken wrote, compared with a loss of about $7.6 billion for the
two prior years combined.  Orenbuch estimates that the unit will lose $2.38 billion
this year and $1.1 billion in 2014. McDonald predicts a $1.3
billion loss in 2013 and a $649 million loss next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
