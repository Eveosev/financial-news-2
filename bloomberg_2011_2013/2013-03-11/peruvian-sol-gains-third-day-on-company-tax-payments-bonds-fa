Peru ’s sol rose for a third
consecutive session as local companies bought the currency to
pay taxes and the central bank refrained from buying dollars.  The sol advanced 0.1 percent to 2.5955 per  U.S. dollar  at
today’s close, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It has
dropped 1.7 percent this year after strengthening 5.7 percent in
2012.  Companies have until March 21 to make monthly income tax
payments, according to the website of Peru’s tax collection
agency Sunat. The increased dollar sales allowed the overnight
dollar rate to fall to about 3 percent, from 6.3 percent a week
earlier, said Gonzalo Navarro, the head trader at the local unit
of Banco Santander SA.  The central bank said on its website it didn’t buy or sell
dollars in the foreign exchange market today.  The yield on Peru’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol bond due
August 2020 climbed one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point,
to 3.81 percent at 3:32 p.m. in  Lima , according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The price declined 0.07 centimo to 125.70 centimos
per sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
