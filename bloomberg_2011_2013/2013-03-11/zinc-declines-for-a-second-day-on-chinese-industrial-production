Zinc prices fell to a 15-week low
after industrial output posted the weakest start to a year since
2009 in  China , the world’s biggest user of industrial metals.  Production rose 9.9 percent in the two months ended Feb.
28, trailing estimates by economists, and retail sales fell
short of forecasts. Zinc dropped below its 200-day moving
average, and aluminum, lead, and tin also declined in London.
Nickel was higher.  “Macro numbers out of China released on Friday and over
the weekend did not seem to have impressed,”  Edward Meir , an
analyst at INTL FCStone Inc. in New York, said in a report.
“The Chinese economy, while growing, does not seem to be
delivering the upside momentum to metals that it once did.”  On the London Metal Exchange, zinc for delivery in three
months dropped 0.7 percent to close at $1,960.5 a metric ton at
5:50 p.m. Earlier, the price touched $1,928, the lowest since
Nov. 23.  Stockpiles tracked by the LME increased 1 percent to 1.21
million tons. On Dec. 6, inventory of the metal used to
rustproof steel reached 1.24 million, the highest since 1994.  Copper rallied 0.2 percent to $7,758 a ton ($3.52 a pound)
in  London . In New York, futures for May delivery climbed 0.2
percent to settle at $3.517 a pound on the Comex.  Money managers more than doubled  wagers  on lower copper
prices to 16,391 Comex futures and options contracts in the week
ended March 5 from a week earlier, according to government data
on March 8.  To contact the reporters on this story:
