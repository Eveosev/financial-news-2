Steel reinforcement-bar futures
fell to the lowest in more than two months after China’s
industrial output had the weakest start to a year since 2009.  Rebar for delivery in October on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell by as much as 1.6 percent to 3,867  yuan  ($622) a
metric ton, the lowest level for a most-active contract since
Dec. 27, and was little changed at 3,928 yuan at 10:40 a.m.
local time. The contract declined for a third week last week.  China’s industrial output rose 9.9 percent in the first two
months this year and retail sales rose 12.3 percent, government
data showed March 9, trailing economists’ estimates. New local-
currency loans in February fell to 620 billion yuan ($99.6
billion), the People’s Bank of China said yesterday, less than
the estimates of 27 out of 28 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  “Sentiment has turned pessimistic over government policy
and the Chinese economy,” Fang Guodong, analyst at Wanda
Futures Co., said in a report today.  The average spot price for rebar fell 0.1 percent on March
8 to 3,759 yuan a ton, according to data from Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery was
unchanged at $146.30 a ton, according to data compiled by The
Steel Index Ltd.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
