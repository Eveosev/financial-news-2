Exports of North Sea Foinaven crude
will decline to two cargoes in April, from three this month,
according to a loading program obtained by  Bloomberg News .  The schedule is comprised of one consignment of 590,000
barrels and another of 600,000 barrels, the plan showed. That
compares with three 590,000 barrel lots set to load this month.  BP Plc (BP/)  operates the offshore U.K. field, west of the
Shetland Islands. Loading programs are monthly schedules of
crude shipments compiled by field operators to allow buyers and
sellers to plan their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
