Serbia probably will overshoot its
fiscal deficit target for the second consecutive year as revenue
collection weakens and the two-month budget gap has already
exceeded one-fifth of the full-year plan.  The fiscal gap will be at least 4.5 percent of gross
domestic product, compared with a 3.6 percent target, and may be
as high as 5 percent if unbudgeted aid to unprofitable
steelworks or subsidies to information technology companies are
included, said Pavle Petrovic, the head of the Fiscal Council, a
three-member body appointed by parliament to oversee government
compliance to self-imposed fiscal rules.  The cumulative deficit in January and February is estimated
to have reached a “worrying” 35 billion dinars ($404.75
million) and “if this pace of the deficit continues in the
coming months, the deficit will exceed 210 billion dinars
instead of the planned 122 billion dinars,” Petrovic said today
at a Belgrade news conference.  Serbia reported a 6.99 billion-dinar budget gap in January.
The consolidated result, which includes local governments,
pension and health funds, showed a surplus of 3.8 billion dinars
in January, the  Finance Ministry  said in a March 9 e-mailed
statement.  Squeezing the shortfall is key to “avoiding an external
debt crisis,” he said.  Staying on track toward balancing the budget through 2016
will require savings of as much as 450 million euros ($585
million) next year, Petrovic said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
