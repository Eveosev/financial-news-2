Rules requiring shipping companies
to cut sulfur emissions could cost the industry 2,000 jobs and
harm the environment by increasing carbon pollution, according
to a report commissioned by the U.K. Chamber of Shipping.  Regulations taking effect in 2015 would shift more cargo to
land transportation, adding carbon emissions and increasing the
cost of road diesel by 2.8 pence ($0.04) a liter (0.3 gallon),
according to the report by AMEC Environment & Infrastructure
U.K. Ltd. The change would cause passenger and container route
ticket prices to climb as much as 29 percent and would threaten
2,000 maritime service jobs, the chamber said in an e-mailed
statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
