Swiss stocks  rose for a third day,
with the benchmark  Swiss Market Index (SMI)  extending a 4 1/2-year
high, as better-than-forecast export growth in  Germany 
outweighed a downgrade in Italy’s credit rating.  Givaudan SA led gains in the index.  Belimo Holding AG (BEAN)  rose
4.8 percent after it forecast continued growth in  Europe .
Actelion Ltd fell the most on the benchmark index. Kuehne &
Nagel International AG dropped 1 percent after the shares were
downgraded at Nomura Holdings Inc.  The SMI added 0.2 percent to 7,758.65 at the close of
trading in Zurich, its highest level since May 2008. The SMI
rallied 1.9 percent last week as the U.S. unemployment rate fell
and speculation mounted that central banks around the world will
continue to support economic recovery. The broader Swiss
Performance Index rose 0.1 percent today.  The volume of shares changing hands in SMI-listed companies
was 30 percent lower than the average of the last 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  German exports rose more than economists forecast in
January, data from the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden
showed. Exports, adjusted for working days and seasonal changes,
advanced 1.4 percent from December, when they gained 0.2
percent. Economists in a Bloomberg survey had forecast a 0.5
increase.  Italy Rating  Fitch Ratings downgraded  Italy ’s credit rating by one level
to BBB+ with a negative outlook amid a political deadlock that
threatens the country’s ability to respond to a recession and
the debt crisis.  Givaudan, the world’s largest maker of flavorings and
fragrances, advanced 0.9 percent to 1,175 francs.  Belimo Holding rose 4.8 percent to 2,096 francs after the
Swiss maker of air conditioning machinery forecast continued
growth in Europe, its biggest market.  Full-year net income rose 19 percent to 61.4 million francs
as sales rose 6.9 percent to 444.6 million francs ($468
million), Belimo said. The company is proposing a dividend of 60
francs a share, an increase of 10 francs from a year earlier.  Nestle SA, the world’s largest food company which accounts
for more than 23 percent of the SMI, added 0.5 percent to 67.65
francs.  Kuehne & Nagel (KNIN) , the world’s biggest sea-freight forwarder,
dropped 1 percent to 104.50 francs. The stock was downgraded to
neutral from buy at Nomura.  Actelion,  the Swiss maker of the Tracleer lung drug, fell
0.8 percent to 50.55 francs, snapping a four-day rally.  To contact the reporter on this story:
