The  Seattle Seahawks  agreed to
acquire wide receiver Percy Harvin from the  Minnesota Vikings  in
exchange for multiple National Football League draft picks,
according to Fox Sports.  The trade will become official once Harvin, 24, passes a
physical, Fox Sports  reported  today without saying where it
obtained the information. Minnesota will receive Seattle’s
first- and seventh-round picks in the 2013 draft next month, and
a mid-round pick in 2014, according to the report.  Seahawks spokesman Dave Pearson and Bob Hagan, a Vikings
spokesman, didn’t immediately respond to e-mails seeking
comment.  Harvin led the Vikings last season in receptions, with 62,
and yards receiving, with 677, despite missing seven games with
an ankle injury. The 22nd draft pick in 2009, he is entering the
final season of his five-year rookie contract.  The Seahawks (11-5) qualified for the playoffs as a wild-
card team and advanced to the National Football Conference
semifinals, where they lost 30-28 to the Atlanta Falcons. The
Vikings (10-6), also a wild-card team, lost 24-10 in the opening
round to the  Green Bay Packers .  Harvin will likely need a new jersey number should he join
Seattle. The No. 12 that he wore in Minnesota is retired by the
Seahawks for the “12th Man,” a nickname for their fans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
