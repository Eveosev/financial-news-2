OGX Petroleo e Gas Participacoes
SA , the oil company of billionaire  Eike Batista , slumped after
an unexpected drop in offshore oil production, erasing last
week’s rally.  OGX, based in Rio de Janeiro,  fell  15 percent to 2.65 reais
at the close in Sao Paulo after declining as much as 20 percent
to its lowest intraday level since the company was taken public.
The stock, which was the most traded by volume on  Brazil ’s
Bovespa at 2.8 times its three-month daily average volume, led
losses on the index, which rose 0.2 percent.  Yields on OGX’s $2.56 billion of bonds due in 2018 surged
1.39 percentage points to 11.69 percent.  Production at the company’s three offshore wells in the
Campos Basin fell 14 percent to a combined 11,300 barrels a day
in February, the company said in a presentation. Investors were
expecting production to increase this year after the company
connected a third well to the Tubarao Azul project in January,
Oswaldo Telles, an equity analyst at  Banco Espirito Santo SA (BES) ,
said by phone from Sao Paulo.  Batista, 56, signed an agreement last week with billionaire
 Andre Esteves ’  Grupo BTG Pactual (BBTG11)  to co-run a strategic and
financial management committee for his six publicly-traded
companies after OGX fell 68 percent in 2012. BTG is the most
profitable Brazilian bank and Esteves is the only Brazilian
national on Bloomberg Markets Magazine’s 50 Most Influential
list last year. OGX rallied 16 percent on March 7 after the deal
was announced.  “There was a short-term relief when Eike announced a pact
with BTG, and now people realize this pact is not a miracle,”
Telles said. “Only one thing can bring expectations up:
delivering on production.”  Targets Reduced  OGX in June cut targets at two wells by as much as 75
percent, triggering a stock selloff that wiped out 7.3 billion
reais ($3.73 billion) in market value in a week. Five years
after the oil startup raised 6.7 billion reais in an initial
public offering by vowing to produce 730,000 barrels a day in
2015, OGX is still struggling to boost output at its offshore
fields where the geology is more challenging than the company
anticipated.  Banco Safra SA was expecting output at Tubarao Azul to rise
to about 15,000 barrels a day after the company added the third
well, analyst Leonardo Alves said today in a note to clients.  To contact the reporters on this story:
