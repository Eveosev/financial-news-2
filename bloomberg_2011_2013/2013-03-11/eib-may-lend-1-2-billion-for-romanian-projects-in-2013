The European Investment Bank  plans
to “considerably” boost lending in  Romania  this year to help
the country accelerate economic growth.  The Luxembourg-based bank may provide as much as 900
million euros ($1.2 billion) in financing in the eastern
European country, compared with 335 million euros last year, EIB
President Werner Hoyer told reporters in Bucharest today.  “We are willing to considerably increase our lending in
Romania this year and we have several projects in the
pipeline,” Hoyer said.  The bank, which has lent about 9.3 billion euros in Romania
since 1990, is taking steps to help European countries overcome
a sovereign-debt crisis, which hampers lending by commercial
banks. The EIB will probably approve loans worth as much as 1
billion euros in five western Balkan countries this year,
including Serbia and  Montenegro , Vice President Dario Scannapieco told reporters in Belgrade today.  The EIB last year lent 245 million euros to help finance
commercial loans to small and medium-sized companies in Romania,
according to a statement released after a meeting between Hoyer
and Prime Minister Victor Ponta today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
