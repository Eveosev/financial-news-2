Poet LLC, the second-largest U.S.
ethanol maker by production capacity, agreed to process sorghum
from Chromatin Inc. into ethanol at its largest plant.  Poet’s Chancellor plant in South Dakota will use sorghum
from as many as 4,400 acres grown in the state, Chicago-based
Chromatin said today in a statement. Terms weren’t disclosed.  The deal is Chromatin’s fourth with a U.S. ethanol producer
this year, and its first outside California, following supply
agreements with Calgren Renewable Fuels LLC, Aemetis Inc. and
 Pacific Ethanol Inc. (PEIX)  Shifting some production from corn to
sorghum will let Poet better manage costs and feedstocks, the
biofuel producer said in the statement.  The Chancellor plant, about 20 miles (32 kilometers)
southwest of Poet’s Sioux Falls, South Dakota, headquarters,
produces about 110 million gallons (416 million liters) of fuel
a year from corn. The companies didn’t say what percentage of
that will be made from sorghum. Closely held Chromatin is backed
by investors including  BP Plc. (BP/)   Ethanol made from sorghum may  qualify  as an advanced
biofuel according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
U.S. gasoline and diesel producers  must blend  2.75 billion
gallons of advanced biofuels with their products this year.  Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. (ADM)  is the largest U.S. ethanol
company by production capacity, according to data from the
Renewable Fuels Association, a Washington-based trade group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
