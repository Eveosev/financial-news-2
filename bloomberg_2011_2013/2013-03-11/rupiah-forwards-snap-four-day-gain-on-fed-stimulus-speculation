Indonesia ’s one-month rupiah
forwards snapped a four-day advance as an improving U.S. economy
spurred speculation the Federal Reserve will scale back its
monetary stimulus, slowing flows into emerging-market assets.  The Dollar Index advanced today after touching a seven-
month high on March 8 following reports last week that showed
the jobless rate dropped and payrolls increased in the world’s
largest economy. The Fed has been buying $85 billion of bonds
each month in its open-ended program, while foreign ownership of
Indonesian government debt has increased 13.5 trillion rupiah
($1.4 billion) this year, official data show.  “If quantitative easing ends earlier than expected, then a
cheap U.S. dollar will be no more,” said Mika Martumpal, a
currency analyst at PT Bank CIMB Niaga in Jakarta. “The strong
U.S. labor market is the primary mover.”  One-month non-deliverable forwards weakened 0.1 percent to
9,717 per dollar as of 3:45 p.m. in Jakarta, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The contracts traded at a 0.2 percent discount
to the spot rate, which fell 0.1 percent to 9,691, according to
prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg.  A daily  fixing  used to settle the derivative contracts was
set at 9,691 per dollar today, little changed from 9,688 on
March 8, by the Association of Banks in  Singapore .  The rupiah’s one-month implied volatility, which measures
expected exchange-rate swings used to price options, declined 18
basis points, or 0.18 percentage point, to 5.66 percent.  The yield on Indonesia’s 5.625 percent bonds due May 2023
fell one basis point to 5.35 percent, prices from the Inter
Dealer Market Association show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
