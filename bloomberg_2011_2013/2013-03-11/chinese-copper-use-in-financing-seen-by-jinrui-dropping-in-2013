Use of copper in financing accords
in  China  is set to drop this year as credit becomes more
available, said Zhong Min, vice-general manager at Jinrui
Futures Co.  China might import more copper concentrate this year and
less refined metal, according to Jinrui, a unit of  Jiangxi
Copper Co. (358)  The nation’s demand for refined copper will expand
5.5 percent in 2013, speeding up from last year’s 3.5 percent
gain to 7.59 million metric tons, according to Jinrui.  Following are comments made by Zhong at Metal Bulletin’s
 26th International Copper Conference  in  Madrid  on March 6.
Jiangxi’s production of refined copper rose 9 percent last year
to 1.03 million tons, ranking fourth globally, according to
researcher CRU. China is the world’s biggest consumer of copper,
used as a backup for borrowings by banks.  On copper use in financing:  “It is believed in the industry 70 percent of all refined
copper is for financing needs. In 2013 we are expecting loose
credit and no  renminbi  appreciation. Copper financing should
drop.”  On China’s refined-copper capacity:  “Mining capacity increases slowly, while smelting capacity
grows fast. In 2013 the estimated excess of concentrate could
result in more imports into China.  “Local government pursuing high GDP growth made refined
copper capacity increase rapidly in the past. In 2012 Chinese
smelters had 330,000 tons of excess capacity, and in 2013 there
will be 440,000 tons of new capacity. In total, as high as
770,000 tons of capacity may be released. In 2013 refined copper
could be greater than the 9.75 percent growth rate in 2012.”  On Chinese copper demand:  “A lower level of the growth rate of China’s copper
consumption is not a short-term situation, but will be constant
in the future. But in 2013 we will see better consumption
growth.  “Even with rapid growth in the past, China’s consumption
per person was as low as 5.87 kilograms (12.9 pounds) in 2011.
It’s almost the same as when  Japan ,  Taiwan  and  Korea  were at the
beginning of their economic growth. Considering the development
history in Japan, Korea and Taiwan … copper consumption growth
in China is still good.  “Copper consumption per person will grow and nuclear
power, high-speed rail and city rail should be the new areas of
consumption growth.  “It is estimated that copper consumption per person in
China will be 7.3 kilograms in 2020 and 8.2 kilograms in 2030.
China will remain the largest copper consumer at least for
another 10 to 20 years.  “Looking at the composition of industries, along with
modernization and industrialization, electric power has become
the largest part of copper consumption.  “Low-income housing should be an important point of growth
in 2013’s copper consumption. Transmission-grid investment will
have a stable increase.”  On  China’s economy :  “The economy is currently rebounding. We believe in 2013
macroeconomic policies will not be tight.  Monetary policy  will
be looser than expected.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
