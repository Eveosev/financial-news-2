The yen may decline to its weakest
level in almost four years versus its U.S. counterpart if a key
support level fails to hold, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The Japanese currency will face a test at the 97-to-97.80
zone, according to Niall O’Connor, a technical analyst at
JPMorgan in New York. The yen may depreciate to 100, which would
be its lowest level since April 2009, if it breaches that
support level, O’Connor said. The currency fell 3 percent over
the five days ended March 8, its biggest weekly decline since
November 2011.  “Depending on how dollar-yen progresses toward the 97-
to-97.80 area, the next big zone could come in between 99 and
100,” O’Connor said in a telephone interview.  The yen decreased 0.1 percent to 96.06 per dollar at 11:51
a.m. in New York after reaching 96.26. The currency fell 0.1
percent to 125 per euro.  Japan ’s currency may strengthen back to 93.50 if it moves
past a key resistance zone from 94.10 to 94.75, according to
O’Connor.  “That would be near-term negative for dollar-yen and
suggest that it could move lower,” O’Connor said. “But those
initial levels should probably hold and maintain the more
immediate upside bias.”  The yen fell 2.6 percent over the past week among the 10
developed-nation currencies monitored by the Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar gained 0.4 percent.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
currency or index. Resistance refers to an area on a chart where
sell orders may be gathered, and support is an area where there
may be buy orders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
