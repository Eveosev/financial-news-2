The  Bovespa index  fell for a second
session as raw-material producers including steelmaker Cia.
 Siderurgica Nacional (CSNA3)  SA tumbled after  China ’s industrial output
growth trailed economists’ estimates.  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Brazil’s state-controlled oil
company, followed crude lower. Competitor  OGX Petroleo (OGXP3)  & Gas
Participacoes SA slumped after saying its daily production per
offshore well fell to 3,800 barrels in February from 4,900 in
January.  The Bovespa declined 0.7 percent to 58,025.07 at 10:36 a.m.
in Sao Paulo. Forty-one stocks advanced on the gauge while 26
retreated. The Bloomberg Base Metals 3-Month Price commodity
Index dropped 0.8 percent after China’s statistics bureau said
industrial production climbed 9.9 percent in the first two
months of 2013, below the median forecast of 10.6 percent among
22 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “China’s latest economic data were worse than expected,
which helps to push the Bovespa lower, given that some of
Brazil’s biggest companies depend on commodities exports,” Luis Gustavo Pereira, an analyst at Futura Corretora in  Sao Paulo ,
said in a telephone interview. “OGX is also a big chunk of
today’s drop. Its production figures were disappointing.”  OGX plunged 15 percent to 2.65 reais. CSN, as Cia.
Siderurgica is known, dropped 1.5 percent to 10.48 reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
