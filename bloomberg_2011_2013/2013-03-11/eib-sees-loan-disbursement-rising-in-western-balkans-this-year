The European Investment Bank will
probably approve loans worth as much as 1 billion euros ($1.3
billion) in five western Balkans countries this year to support
the region’s integration with the European Union.  The bulk of the funds would go to  Serbia , followed by
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia, Montenegro and Albania, for
infrastructure and for small and medium-sized enterprises, EIB
Vice President Dario Scannapieco told reporters in Belgrade
today.  “The money is flowing into the real economy” after 839
million euros were disbursed to the region last year, he said.
This year’s financing is seen between 750 million euros and 1
billion euros, after loan contracts worth 671 million euro were
signed in 2012, he said.  The Luxembourg-based lender also sees disbursement of
previously agreed loans outpacing the signing of new ones, due
to “intensified work on actual projects,” Scannapieco said.  The AAA-rated EIB will keep its focus on transportation
projects in the region which are “essential for attracting
foreign investment,” while “increasing attention and support
on renewable energy and environmental” projects, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
