Gold gained for the third straight
session, the longest rally this year, on concern that the
European crisis may worsen, increasing the appeal of the
precious metal as a haven.  Fitch Ratings  cut Italy’s credit rating by one level on
March 8. Physical demand prospects out of China remain positive
in the weeks ahead, UBS AG said in a report on March 8. Gold is
down 5.8 percent this year, after 12 straight annual gains, on
mounting confidence that economies are recovering.  “Fitch downgrading Italy is providing some support,” Fain Shaffer, the president of Infinity Trading Corp. in Medford,
 Oregon , said in a telephone interview. “Also, there is an
increase in demand in Asia.”  Gold futures for April delivery climbed 0.1 percent to
settle at $1,578 an ounce at 1:49 p.m. on the Comex in  New York .
The metal fell as much as 0.2 percent today as the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  reached an all-time high on signs that the
 U.S. economy  is strengthening.  “The positive data out of the U.S. is very negative for
gold, and gold has been getting slaughtered because of equities
this year,” Shaffer said.  U.S. payrolls rose and the jobless rate declined in
February, the Labor Department said March 8. Holdings in
bullion-backed exchange-traded funds fell to 2,484.1 metric tons
on March 8, the lowest since September, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Silver futures for May delivery slid 0.3 percent to $28.853
an ounce on the Comex, the first decline this month. Trading
volume was 55 percent below the average in the past 100 days for
