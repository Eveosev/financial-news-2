Russia’s 15-year ruble bonds
dropped, lifting the yield to a record. The ruble snapped two
days of declines against the central bank’s basket of
currencies.  The yield on OFZs due January 2028 increased three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 7.39 percent, the highest
since the bond started trading in January. The ruble gained 0.1
percent against Bank Rossii’s dollar-euro basket to 34.9353 by 7
p.m. in Moscow. The Russian currency slid 0.3 percent against
the dollar to 30.7775 and gained 0.5 percent against the euro to
40.0170.  Inflation accelerated to 7.3 percent in February from a
year earlier, the Federal Statistics Service said on March 5.
While the Economy Ministry forecasts the rate may be 7.2 percent
to 7.3 percent in March, consumer prices will slow to 6.5
percent for the year, according to the average estimate of
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “The main reason for rising OFZ yields is that we are
passing through the peak of inflation,” Dmitry Dorofeev, a
fixed-income strategist at BCS Financial Group in Moscow, said
by phone.  Yields on ruble-denominated government bonds are advancing
because of low interest in the local market from foreign
investors, Dmitry Polevoy and Egor Fedorov, analysts at  ING
Groep NV (INGA)  in Moscow, said in a note to clients. “Rising
interbank lending rates have made longer-dated OFZ even less
attractive for local players,” they said. The MosPrime
overnight lending rate rose to 6.27 percent from 6.09 percent at
the end of last month.  Tax Period  Crude in New York declined 0.9 percent to $91.09 per
barrel, reversing a 0.4 percent increase on March 8, when
Russia’s markets were closed for public holidays. The oil and
gas industry provides about 50 percent of Russia’s budget
revenue.  A stable oil price is likely to support the ruble in the
short term at the “psychological” level of 35 rubles to the
basket, OAO  Rosbank (ROSB)  analysts led by Vladimir Kolychev said in
note to clients. The currency may then get additional support
from exporters, who face a “large volume” of payments to the
state budget, they wrote.  Russian corporate taxpayers will transfer about 950 billion
rubles ($31 billion) to the state budget during this month’s tax
period, which starts March 15, according to calculations by HSBC
Holdings Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
