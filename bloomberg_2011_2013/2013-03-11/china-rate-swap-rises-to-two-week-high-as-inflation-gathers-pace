China ’s five-year interest-rate
swap climbed to a two-week high after government data showed
February’s inflation was the fastest in 10 months.  China’s  consumer prices  climbed 3.2 percent from a year
earlier, according to figures released March 9, exceeding
January’s 2 percent gain and the median estimate for a 3 percent
increase in a Bloomberg survey of analysts. The government set
an annual inflation target of 3.5 percent at an annual congress
meeting that started in Beijing on March 5.  “The higher-than-expected CPI headline number is boosting
traders’ inflation expectations,” said Liu Junyu, a bond
analyst in Shenzhen at China Merchants Bank Co., the nation’s
sixth-biggest lender.  The five-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, climbed two
basis points to 3.71 percent as of 10:33 a.m. in  Shanghai , the
highest since Feb. 25, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It averaged 3.28 percent in the past 12 months.  The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, jumped 51 basis points to 3 percent,
according to a weighted average rate compiled by the National
Interbank Funding Center. It dropped 195 basis points, or 1.95
percentage points, last week.  The People’s Bank of China gauged demand for seven and 14-
day reverse-repurchase contract operations this week, according
to a trader required to bid at the auctions. The central bank
also asked banks to submit orders for 28-day repos.  --Judy Chen. Editors:  James Regan , Simon Harvey  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
