Asian  stocks  rose, with the
regional benchmark index heading for the highest close since
August 2011, after U.S. jobs data beat estimates and Japanese
exporters gained on a weaker yen.  Techtronic Industries Co. (669) , a maker of power tools that gets
most of its sales in North America, gained 1.9 percent in Hong
Kong. Resona Holdings Inc. and Shinsei Bank Ltd. led gains among
Japanese lenders on speculation they may follow Sumitomo Mitsui
Trust Holdings Inc. with plans to repay public funds.  Agile
Property Holdings (3383)  Ltd., a Chinese developer, slid 1.8 percent in
Hong Kong as stock indexes in the city erased gains following
Chinese economic reports that missed estimates.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.7 percent to 136.52 as
of 8:35 p.m. in Tokyo, set for the highest close since Aug. 2,
2011. About five stocks gained for every four that fell. The
MSCI Asia Pacific Excluding Japan Index was little changed at
482.90 after falling as much as 0.4 percent.  The U.S. jobs data “has shown the world’s largest economy
is really starting to gain momentum and, of course, that’s all
positive for financial markets,” said Matthew Sherwood, head of
investment markets research in Sydney at Perpetual Investments,
which manages about $25 billion. “The biggest part of the
global economy, namely the U.S., is doing well and continues to
do well, whereas there’s a small question mark over  China .
That’s containing the rally.”  The Asia-Pacific measure gained 11 percent from the end of
October through March 8 as Japanese shares surged on optimism a
new government led by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will press for
more stimulus to beat deflation. Shares on Asia’s benchmark
 traded  at 15.1 times estimated earnings compared with 14 for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 12.7 for the Stoxx Europe 600 on
March 8, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  BOJ Easing  Haruhiko Kuroda, nominee for the BOJ governorship,  said
today the central bank will consider buying derivatives if he’s
confirmed and signaled to more bond more quickly.  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 0.5 percent, gaining
for an eighth day, as the yen traded near a 3 1/2 year low
against the dollar. The ratio of short selling to total trading
value at the  Tokyo  Stock Exchange last week fell to the lowest
level since the bourse began releasing the data in October 2008.  The Nikkei climbed 43 percent in the 74 days since the
rally began in November. After adjusting for the yen’s
depreciation against the dollar, the return shrinks to about 19
percent, or four percentage points more than the S&P 500,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  North Korea  South Korea’s Kospi Index dropped 0.1 after North Korea
threatened to target South Korea’s incoming defense minister.

supplier of toys and clothes to Wal-Mart Stores Inc., rose 1.6
percent to HK$11.16 in Hong Kong.  James Hardie Industries Plc, a seller of home siding that

government. Its shares gained 2.3 percent to 437 yen. Resona
surged 14 percent to 531 yen, while Shinsei Bank soared 8.4
percent to 245 yen.  The banks are among lenders that were rescued by taxpayers
after bad loans mounted following the collapse of  Japan ’s
property and stock-market bubble in the 1990s. Resona, the most
recent to be bailed out a decade ago, is considering repaying
part of the government’s stake, Kyodo News reported on March 8,
without saying where it got the information.  Innolux Corp. advanced 7 percent to NT$18.35 after the
Commercial Times said the maker of liquid crystal displays and
AU Optronics Corp. will benefit from an increase in TV panel
shipments. AU Optronics added 4.9 percent to NT$13.95.  Chinese developers dropped after the nation’s industrial
production increased in the two months through February at the
slowest pace since 2009. Retail sales rose 12.3 percent,
