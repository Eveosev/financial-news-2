Qatar seeks to raise its  credit
rating  by two levels to AAA, putting the world’s biggest
exporter of liquefied natural gas on par with countries
including Canada and Norway.  “We are working on AAA instead of AA,” Finance Minister
Yousef Kamal told reporters in Doha today. “Our strength
deserves AAA.” Qatar’s non-oil economic output will expand 9
percent this year, Kamal said, in line with International
Monetary Fund estimates.  Bonds from Qatar and  Abu Dhabi , which has the same rating,
emerged as a refuge for investors amid Europe’s sovereign debt
crisis. The cost of insuring Qatar’s dollar debt for five years,
a measure of credit risk, dropped 45 basis points last year to
82, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts
declined another 20 basis points this year to 63.  Qatar will record a budget surplus of 8.5 percent of gross
domestic product this year, the third biggest among the six-
nation Gulf Cooperation Council after Kuwait and  Saudi Arabia ,
according to IMF data. The government plans next year’s budget
based oil priced at $65 a barrel, Kamal said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
