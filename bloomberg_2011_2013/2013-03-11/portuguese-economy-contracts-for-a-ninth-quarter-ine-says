Portugal â€™s  economy  shrank for a
ninth quarter in the three months through December as export
growth slows with a deepening recession in the euro-area.  Gross domestic product declined 1.8 percent from the third
quarter, when it fell 0.9 percent, the Lisbon-based National
Statistics Institute said in an e-mailed statement today. That
matches a preliminary report on Feb. 14. Fourth-quarter GDP
dropped 3.8 percent from a year earlier.  Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  is battling rising
joblessness and lower demand from European trading partners as
he raises taxes to meet the terms of a 78 billion-euro ($101
billion) aid plan from the European Union and the International
Monetary Fund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
