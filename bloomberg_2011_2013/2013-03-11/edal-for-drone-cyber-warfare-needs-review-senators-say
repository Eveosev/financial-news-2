The leaders of the Senate Armed
Services Committee said a new medal to recognize the role of
drone operators and cyber warriors shouldn’t rank higher than
traditional awards honoring heroism and combat wounds.  Senators  Carl Levin  of Michigan, the panel’s Democratic
chairman, and  James Inhofe  of Oklahoma, the top Republican,
called on Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to reconsider the
standing given to the new Distinguished Warfare Medal.  “Although we are supportive of this new medal, we are
concerned that it is given precedence above awards earned by
service members for actions on the battlefield, such as the
Bronze Star Medal and Purple Heart,” Levin and Inhofe said in a
letter to Hagel.  The Pentagon created the medal last month to recognize
troops with special training and capabilities that “directly
and precisely impact military operations at times far from the
battlefield,” according to a Defense Department statement.  Leon Panetta , Hagel’s predecessor as Pentagon chief, announced the
award.  To contact the reporter on this story:
