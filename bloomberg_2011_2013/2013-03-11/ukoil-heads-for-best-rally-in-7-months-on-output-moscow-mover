OAO Lukoil rose for its longest
winning streak since August on optimism  Russia ’s second-biggest
oil producer will boost output and dividends.  Lukoil gained 0.2 percent to 2,013 rubles by the close in
Moscow, after adding as much as 2.7 percent earlier, the highest
intraday level since April 2011 and a fifth day of gains. The
number of shares traded was 1.8 million, equivalent to about two
times the three-month average.  Lukoil will invest more than $16 billion this year to lift
output by 18 percent by the end of 2015, Chief Executive Officer
 Vagit Alekperov  said March 7. Lukoil will consider boosting
 dividend  payout ratios from next year when investment demands
ease, Alekperov said. The Moscow-based company will distribute
23 percent of net income in 2012 and is looking to boost
shareholder payments to 30 percent of profit in the medium term,
he said.  “Lukoil is the most attractive name in the Russian oil and
gas sector now,”  Alexei Kokin , an analyst at UralSib Financial
Corp., said by phone from Moscow. “It showed a great
performance, solid cash generation in the fourth quarter, higher
than expected dividends.”  Lukoil will rise to 2,552.48 rubles in the next year,
according to the average of 21 analyst price targets compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
