CIC Insurance Group Ltd. (CIC) , Kenya’s
second-biggest insurer by premiums, jumped to the highest on
record on bets 2012 profit grew as much as 54 percent, according
to Sterling Capital Ltd.  The shares surged 9.4 percent to 5.25 shillings by 12:15
p.m. in the capital, Nairobi, the highest level since July 19,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. About 57 percent of the
three-month daily average volume of shares was traded.  “Trading is based on speculation by investors on
anticipation of a results announcement this week or next week,”
Augustine Misoka, a research analyst at Nairobi-based Sterling
Capital, said by phone today. Net income may rise to 900 million
shillings ($10.5 million) from 584 million shillings a year
earlier, he said. “Micro insurance is the main driver of
profit.”  Kenyan stocks, the worst performers in sub-Saharan  Africa 
in 2011, were the best last year as the central bank reined in
inflation and spurred a rally in the shilling. The Nairobi
Securities Exchange All-Share Index surged 39 percent in 2012,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  CIC’s stock has rallied 48 percent this year, outpacing an
18 percent advance by the  Nairobi Securities Exchange All-Share
Index. (NSEASI)   To contact the reporter on this story:
