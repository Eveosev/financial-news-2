Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau Director Richard Cordray pledged to continue to pursue
policies that protect consumers as the Senate considers his
second nomination to run the agency.  “As the economy recovers, we want people to know they have
a new agency standing on their side, looking out for their
interests, to help restore their confidence in the consumer
financial marketplace,” Cordray said in prepared testimony
before the Senate Banking Committee.’’  Cordray testifies tomorrow before the committee, which is
considering President  Barack Obama ’s second try to have him
confirmed. Republicans have pledged to block his confirmation to
the bureau, created by the Dodd-Frank Act, absent structural
changes.  In the face of Republican resistance to Cordray’s previous
nomination, Obama put him in charge of the agency with a recess
appointment. The second nomination was submitted in January. A
subsequent federal court ruling raised questions about the
validity of the recess appointment.  Cordray made no mention of the Republican objections to the
bureau or the court case in his testimony. Both will be a focus
of his nomination hearing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
