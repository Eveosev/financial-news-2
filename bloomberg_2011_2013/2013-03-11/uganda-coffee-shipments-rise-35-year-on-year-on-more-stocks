Coffee exports from  Uganda ,
Africa’s second-biggest shipper of beans, rose 35 percent year-
on-year in February as farmers released more stocks.  Exports in February climbed to 328,643 a 60-kilogram (132-
pound) bags from 244,289 bags a year earlier, Uganda Coffee
Development Authority, the regulator, said today by e-mail from
the capital Kampala. The beans were worth $40.9 million, it
said.  Shipments from the East African nation, which exports its
beans mainly to the European Union, U.S.,  Sudan , Switzerland,
India, Australia and Russia, surpassed an earlier forecast
280,000 bags, the authority said. Exports were lower than
345,546 bags in January as the main harvest slowed, it said.  Farmers released more stocks to benefit from rising prices
and to cater for children’s first-term school expenses, the
authority said. Robusta prices are up 13 percent this year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The nation’s coffee exports in the first five months of the
2012-13 season climbed to 1.32 million bags from 1.16 million
bags a year earlier, according to a tally of the authority
figures by  Bloomberg News . Uganda produces 3.4 million to 3.5
million bags annually, according to the authority.  Uganda, the continent’s second-biggest grower of the beans
after  Ethiopia , consumes about 3 percent of its annual crop,
according to the Africa Fine Coffee Association.  Robusta beans, used in espressos and instant drinks,
accounted for 70 percent of Ugandan exports last season,
according to the authority. Arabica beans, which made up the
remaining 30 percent, are brewed by specialty companies like
Starbucks Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
