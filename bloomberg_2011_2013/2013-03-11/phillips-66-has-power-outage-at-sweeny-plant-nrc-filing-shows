Phillips 66 (PSX)  released an unknown
amount of hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide and benzene at its
Sweeny, Texas, oil refinery because of flaring after a power
outage, according to a filing with the U.S. National Response
Center.  U.S. companies must notify the response center if they
release hazardous substances in excess of reportable quantities,
according to the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund.
