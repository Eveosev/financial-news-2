Winners of an auction in  Guatemala 
to build more than 600 megawatts of new power capacity,
including solar plants, will start producing electricity in two
years as the nation seeks to spur investment in clean energy.  Developers will bring the bulk of projects online in 2015
and some will start in 2018, Jose Rafael Argueta Monterrosoa,
strategic projects division chief at power regulator Comision
Nacional de Energia Electrica, said in an e-mail today.  Guatemala produces about 35 percent of its power from oil
and 23 percent from hydroelectric dams, the International Energy
Agency said on its  website .  The nation plans to “reach a target of getting 80 percent
of its energy from renewables in 2026,” Monterrosoa said.  Developers will build 55 megawatts of solar projects, 101
megawatts of wind farms and 16 megawatts of biomass facilities,
he said. They will also develop 311 megawatts of hydroelectric
projects and 140 megawatts of plants that use fossil fuels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
