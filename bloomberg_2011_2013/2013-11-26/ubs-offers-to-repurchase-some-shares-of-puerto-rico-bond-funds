UBS AG (UBSN)  offered to repurchase some
shares of its  Puerto Rico  bond funds after the commonwealth’s
debt has lost 16 percent this year.  The buyback program applies to funds solely managed by UBS,
and offers would be at net-asset value or below,  Karina Byrne , a
spokeswoman for  Switzerland ’s largest bank, said yesterday in an
e-mailed statement. The Zurich-based firm has told advisers to
contact clients who hold Puerto Rico closed-end funds and those
with UBS Bank USA loans secured “in any part” by closed-end
funds about the repurchase program, Byrne said.  The closed-end funds are capped to prevent the repurchase
of more than 25 percent of outstanding shares over the life of
the investment, Byrne said. Some funds are closer to that limit
than others and may choose not to reach it with this buyback,
she said.  Debt sold by Puerto Rico and its localities  lost  16 percent
this year through Nov. 22, the worst performance since at least
1999,  Standard & Poor’s  data show. Yields on Puerto Rico
securities soared to record levels this year on concern that the
island’s finances would deteriorate as its economy has struggled
to grow since 2006.  Shares of the Puerto Rico Fixed Income Fund, one of the
bank’s closed-end offerings, had a net asset value of $3.65 as
of Nov. 20, according to UBS’s  website . They were offered to the
public at $10 each, according to a July 2003  prospectus .  UBS’s decision to repurchase shares was reported yesterday
by InvestmentNews.com.  The lender said in October it put a financial adviser on
administrative leave in Puerto Rico while it reviews loans
issued to clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
