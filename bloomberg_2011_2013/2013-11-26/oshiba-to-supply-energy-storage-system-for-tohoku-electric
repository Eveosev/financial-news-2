Toshiba Corp. (6502)  will supply an energy
storage system for a pilot project by  Tohoku Electric Power Co. (9506) 
to stabilize the flow of electricity generated by wind and solar
power.  The battery system, which will have 20-megawatt hours of
storage capacity, will be set up at a substation in the northern
city of Sendai in Miyagi prefecture north of Tokyo, Toshiba said
in a  statement  today.  The lithium-ion battery system is expected to be installed
by February 2015, Tohoku Electric said in a statement yesterday.  In a similar pilot project by the Ministry of Economy,
Trade and Industry,  Sumitomo Electric Industries Ltd. (5802)  was picked
in July to supply a system with 60-megawatt hours of storage
capacity to a  Hokkaido Electric Power Co. (9509)  substation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
