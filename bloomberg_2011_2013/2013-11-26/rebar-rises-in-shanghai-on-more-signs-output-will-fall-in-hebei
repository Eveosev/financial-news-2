Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
Shanghai climbed on further signs that output will decline in
 Hebei province , the largest producing region in China.  Rebar for May delivery, the most-active contract on the
Shanghai Futures Exchange, rose as much as 0.6 percent to 3,657
 yuan  ($600) a metric ton, the highest price since Nov. 13.
Futures traded at 3,653 yuan at 10:32 a.m. local time.  Xingtai Longhai Iron & Steel Group Co., a unit of China’s
biggest producer Hebei Iron & Steel Group Co., halted production
because of operational difficulties, the official Securities
Times reported  Nov. 24  citing exchange filings. Hebei government
on the same day demolished furnaces with output capacity of 4.56
million tons for iron and 6.8 million tons for steel to reduce
pollution, Xinhua News Agency reported.  “The news of closing down plants has been supporting the
market in the past few days,” Xia Junyan, analyst at Wanda
Futures Co., said from  Shanghai .  State-owned China National Radio also reported on Nov. 24
that Hebei would reduce its annual steel output capacity by at
least 10 million tons. The provincial government said September
it planned to cut capacity by 60 million tons by 2017 to tackle
air pollution.  Iron ore  for May delivery on the Dalian Commodity Exchange
rose 0.8 percent to 940 yuan a ton. The steel-making  material 
for immediate delivery at Tianjin port tracked by The Steel
Index was unchanged at $136.5 a dry ton yesterday.  Rebar for immediate delivery tracked by Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co. was little changed at 3,534 yuan a
ton yesterday.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
