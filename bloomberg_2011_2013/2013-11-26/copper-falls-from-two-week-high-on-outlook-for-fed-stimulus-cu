Copper declined from the highest in
two weeks on concern that the U.S. Federal Reserve may start
tapering stimulus in coming months, reducing the demand prospect
for the metal.  The contract for delivery in three months on the London
Metal Exchange lost as much as 0.3 percent to $7,075.25 a metric
ton and was at $7,081 per ton at 11:14 a.m. Shanghai time. The
metal yesterday touched $7,140, the highest intra-day level
since Nov. 12.  Minutes of the Fed’s October meeting released Nov. 20
showed officials may cut their  $85 billion  a month of bond
buying if the economy improves as anticipated. The central bank
next meets on Dec. 17-18.  “The Fed’s possible tapering has been seen as the biggest
pressure on metals,” said Xu Liping, a Shanghai-based analyst
at HNA Topwin Futures Co.  Copper for delivery in February on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange rose 0.4 percent to 50,690  yuan  ($8,320) a ton. The
contract for delivery in March was little changed at $3.227 a
pound on the Comex in  New York .  On the LME, zinc fell, while aluminum, nickel, and lead
were little changed. Tin hadn’t traded.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
