The cost of insuring corporate bonds
from non-payment in  Japan  declined to the least in more than two
months, according to traders of credit default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell 0.5 of a basis point to
77.75 basis points as of 9:10 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc.
prices show. The gauge is poised for its lowest close since
Sept. 19, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan was little changed at 129 basis points
as of 8:09 a.m. in Hong Kong, Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. prices show. The benchmark is set for a 1 basis-point
fall this month, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill
Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private
market.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index was also little changed
at 100.5 as of 11:09 a.m. in Sydney, according to Westpac
Banking Corp. The measure is poised for a 4.6 basis-point drop
in November, after declining 20.1 basis points last month, the
most since January 2012, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
