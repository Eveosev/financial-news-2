Rubber declined to a two-week low
after a forecast that the global surplus of the commodity will
widen through 2015 as production increases.  Futures for delivery in April on the  Tokyo  Commodity
Exchange lost as much as 1.8 percent to 256 yen a kilogram
($2,523 a metric ton), matching the intraday low on Nov. 12.
Futures traded at 257.3 yen at 11:42 a.m. local time, extending
losses for this year to 15 percent.  The surplus of natural rubber may expand to 200,000 tons
next year and 257,000 tons in 2015 from 134,000 tons this year,
according to a report from the Economist Intelligence Unit.
Demand is expected to rise at annual 4 percent in 2014 and 2015
after declines in some major consumers brought the growth rate
to 1.6 percent this year.  “Futures were weighed down by speculation that the market
will remain oversupplied,” said Takaki Shigemoto, an analyst at
research company JSC Corp. in Tokyo.  Rubber for May delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
added 0.2 percent to 18,890  yuan  ($3,100) a ton.  Thai rubber free-on-board added 0.3 percent to 79.10 baht
($2.47) a kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research
Institute of  Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
