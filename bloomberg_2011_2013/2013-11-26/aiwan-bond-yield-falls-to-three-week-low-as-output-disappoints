Taiwan ’s 10-year bonds gained,
driving the yield to a three-week low, as investors sought the
safety of fixed-income securities amid signs the island’s
economy is slowing.  Industrial production climbed 0.78 percent in October from
a year earlier, official data showed yesterday, missing the 1
percent median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists. The
 Taiex index  of shares slid in the last three weeks, after data
showed Taiwan’s economy expanded at the slowest pace in a year
in the third quarter. The gauge rose 0.6 percent today. The  gap 
between yields on five- and 10-year sovereign debt rose to 64
basis points last week, the widest since August 2004.  “The stock market has been falling, which gave the  bond
market  a boost,” said Eric Hsing, a Taipei-based fixed-income
trader at First Securities Inc. “Amid early signs of slower
growth, investors were buying five-year bonds, but after the
spread between five- and 10-year notes widened and economic data
continued to disappoint, they have begun buying 10-year notes as
well.”  The yield on the 1.75 percent bonds due September 2023
dropped two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 1.696
percent in when-issued trading as of 10:23 a.m. in Taipei,
according to Gretai Securities Market. That’s the lowest for 10-year sovereign  debt  since Nov. 8. The bonds will be sold at a
Nov. 29 auction.  The Ministry of Finance will sell NT$30 billion ($1
billion) of 30-year bonds at 2.45 percent today, according to
the median estimate of 11 fixed-income traders surveyed by
 Bloomberg News . The government will report revised third-quarter
gross domestic product data and this year’s growth forecast on
Nov. 29.  Currency Market  Taiwan’s dollar strengthened 0.3 percent to NT$29.601
against the greenback, prices from Taipei Forex Inc. show, after
slipping 0.3 percent in the last six minutes of trading
yesterday amid suspected central bank intervention. The monetary
authority has sold the currency in the run-up to the close on
most days since March 2012, according to traders who asked not
to be identified.  One-month non-deliverable forwards on Taiwan’s currency
fell 0.02 percent to NT$29.561 per dollar, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts touched NT$29.585 earlier,
the weakest level since Nov. 15.  One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in
the  exchange rate  used to price options, fell three basis points
to 3.17 percent. The  overnight interbank lending rate  was little
changed at 0.388 percent, compared with yesterday’s 0.385
percent, a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
