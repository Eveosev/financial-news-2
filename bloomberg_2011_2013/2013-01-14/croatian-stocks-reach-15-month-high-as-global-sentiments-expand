Croatia ’s main stock index rose to
the highest level in 15 months, following gains in other
markets, as the country prepares to join the European Union this
year.  The  Crobex benchmark index  reached 1869.05 at 1:40 p.m. in
Zagreb, 1.35 percent higher than the previous close. It was the
index’s biggest increase since Sept. 28, 2011, led by
 Petrokemija d.d. , which rose 5.21 percent.  “Optimism in global capital markets has spread to Croatia,
further boosted by the country’s imminent EU entry on July 1,”
said Zeljko Kruhak, a broker at Auctor Invest d.o.o., by phone
in Zagreb.  To contact the editor responsible for the story: James M. Gomez
