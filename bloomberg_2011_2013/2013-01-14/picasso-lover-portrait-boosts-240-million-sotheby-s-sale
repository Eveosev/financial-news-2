APablo Picasso painting of his
lover Marie-Therese Walter is estimated to sell for as much as
$56 million at an auction next month in London.  The artist’s canvas “Femme assise pres d’une fenetre,”
showing a serene Marie-Therese seated in a black armchair, is
among 61 works being offered by  Sotheby’s (BID)  in its Feb. 5 auction
of Impressionist, modern and Surrealist art. The auction is
valued at as much as 149 million pounds ($240 million).  The young blonde is described in biographies as the married
artist’s mistress, model and muse. Picasso’s paintings of her
have become wealthy art collectors’ ultimate early-20th-century
trophies. The 1932 Marie-Therese canvas “Nude,  Green Leaves  and
Bust” fetched $106.5 million -- then a record for any artwork
at auction -- at Christie’s International,  New York , in May
2010.  This latest painting from the series to appear at auction
was made by Picasso at his rural retreat, the Chateau de
Boisgeloup, near Gisors, northwest of Paris, on Oct. 30, 1932.
The country house was a favorite venue for trysts with Marie-
Therese.  The work is entered from a European private collection and
has a formal valuation of 25 million pounds to 35 million
pounds, based on hammer prices. It was last seen on the auction
market in 1997 and is guaranteed to sell courtesy of a third-
party “irrevocable” bid, Sotheby’s said.  Chance Meeting  The 45-year-old Picasso, then unhappily married to  Olga
Khokhlova , met his blonde girlfriend by chance on the streets of
Paris in 1927. Marie-Therese was 17 at the time. She remained
close to the artist until about 1935. For years he gave her and
their daughter financial support.  Khokhlova found out about the affair when portraits of
Marie-Therese were hung with Cubist and Surrealist works in a
Picasso retrospective at the Galerie Georges Petit, Paris,
according to the Sotheby’s catalog.  The auction also includes the  Claude Monet  water-lily
painting “Nympheas avec reflets de Hautes Herbes.” The work
dates from 1914-17 and is estimated at 12 million pounds to 18
million pounds.  The earlier Monet snow scene, “Le Givre a Giverny,” from
1885, has emerged from the English collection of the late Earl
of  Jersey , who acquired it from a London dealer in 1943. It is
now valued at 4 million pounds to 6 million pounds.  Joan Miro ’s 1945 canvas “Femme revant de l’evasion,”
related to the Spanish Surrealist artist’s “Constellation”
series of a few years earlier, is from the U.S.-based collection
of Miriam and Ira D. Wallach. The work hasn’t been seen on the
market for more than 50 years and is priced at 8 million pounds
to 12 million pounds.  The sale has a lower total formal estimate of 103.1 million
pounds.  (Scott Reyburn writes about the art market for Muse, the
