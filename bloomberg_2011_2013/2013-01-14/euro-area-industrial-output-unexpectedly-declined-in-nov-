Euro-area industrial production
unexpectedly fell in November as declines in Italy and Spain
offset a return to growth in  Germany .  Output in the 17-nation euro area dropped 0.3 percent from
October, when it declined a revised 1 percent, the European
Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said today. Economists
had forecast an increase of 0.2 percent, according to the median
of 37 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. Output fell 3.7
percent from the year-earlier period.  The European Central Bank estimates the euro-area economy
contracted 0.5 percent in 2012 and will shrink 0.3 percent this
year. Manufacturing output shrank for a 17th month in December,
according to Markit Economics, adding to signs a recession in
the currency bloc may extend into this year as leaders struggle
to tackle the debt crisis.  Industrial output in Germany,  Europe ’s largest economy,
increased 0.1 percent after a 2 percent decline in October,
today’s report showed. French production rose 0.5 percent, while
Italy and Spain reported declines of 1 percent and 2.5 percent,
respectively.  Energy production dropped 1.6 percent after a 0.3 percent
decline in October, according to today’s report. Output of
durable and non-durable consumer goods fell 1.1 percent and 1.2
percent, respectively, while production of capital goods rose
0.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
