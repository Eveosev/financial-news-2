Western Canada Select heavy oil
weakened to its lowest level in a month after the second-largest
Midwest refinery shut down a unit over the weekend, cutting into
demand.  Phillips 66 (PSX)  shut a crude unit at its 356,000-barrel-a-day
 refinery  in Wood River,  Illinois , after an electrical fire Jan.
12. BP Plc’s Whiting plant in  Indiana  is the largest in the
region at 420,000 barrels a day.  The unit will be back in service within “a couple of
days,” according to a company statement.  Western Canada Select, an oil-sands bitumen blend, fell
$1.50 to a $41.75-a-barrel discount to U.S. benchmark West Texas
Intermediate, according to Net Energy Inc., a Calgary oil
broker.  The Wood River refinery is a joint venture between Phillips
66 and  Cenovus Energy Inc. (CVE) , and takes crude from two Cenovus
oil-sands projects that  produced  95,625 barrels a day during the
third quarter.  Rising crude oil production in  Alberta  has filled up export
pipelines, causing steepening discounts as some supplies can’t
reach the U.S. refining markets. Last week, capacity to ship on
two Enbridge Inc. export pipelines carrying as much as 1.25
million barrels a day was cut by 10 percent this month because
of power outages and equipment failures.  Canada exported 2.3 million barrels of oil a day during the
third quarter of 2012, up 4.5 percent from the same period a
year earlier, according to the  National Energy Board .  Extra production from a new heavy oil project,  Imperial Oil
Ltd. (IMO) ’s 110,000-barrel-a-day Kearl mine in Alberta, is expected
to cone online early this year, adding to supply that will have
to travel through limited pipeline space.  Syncrude, a synthetic light crude produced from bitumen,
rose 55 cents to trade at parity with WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
