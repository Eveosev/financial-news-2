St. Jude Medical Inc. (STJ) , a maker of
devices for irregular heartbeats, said it received a warning
from U.S. regulators last week for deviating from unspecified
good manufacturing practices at its Sylmar, California, plant.  The  Food and Drug Administration  warned the company in a
Jan. 11 letter, which St. Jude had said Oct. 17 it expected,
according to a company filing today. The letter, which wasn’t
made publicly available by St. Jude or the government, means the
 St. Paul , Minnesota-based company won’t be able to gain approval
for certain devices until the violations are corrected.  St. Jude sent the FDA a list of corrective actions the
company is taking. The warning letter doesn’t affect its Durata
cable used for defibrillators or any of the company’s other
medical products, the device maker said.  “The company will continue manufacturing and shipping
product from the Sylmar facility and customer orders are not
expected to be impacted while we work to resolve the FDA’s
concerns,” St. Jude said in the filing.  The company’s shares gained 1.8 percent to $38.99 at 12:38
p.m.  New York  time. St. Jude  increased  6.5 percent in the past
12 months through Jan. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
