Russia ’s lower house of parliament
rejected a call to review a law barring adoptions of Russian
children by U.S. citizens after activists raised 100,000
signatures in an online petition opposing the ban.  Vladimir Pligin, head of the legislative committee at the
State Duma, said “there is nothing to discuss” because the
appeal didn’t comprise a “legislative initiative,” according
to a statement e-mailed today by the parliamentary faction of
the ruling United Russia party. The independent Novaya Gazeta
newspaper led the drive to collect 100,000 signatures on the
Internet against the law.  Russia barred U.S. adoptions in retaliation for American
sanctions over the death in custody of lawyer Sergei Magnitsky,
who’d alleged a $230 million  tax fraud  by Russian officials. The
ban took effect on Jan. 1. Last year, President  Vladimir Putin 
ordered that every proposal that garners 100,000 signatures
should be reviewed by lawmakers.  Tens of thousands of Russians braved freezing temperatures
yesterday to rally against the legislation and join a procession
through central Moscow called a “March Against Scoundrels.”
Protesters also called for parliament to be disbanded, with a
separate petition demanding the legislature’s breakup on Novaya
Gazeta’s website raising more than 120,000 signatures as of 3:30
p.m. today.  Reviewing a call for the dissolution of parliament would be
“illegitimate,” Pligin said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
