Justice Clarence Thomas spoke at a
U.S. Supreme Court argument for the first time in almost seven
years, evoking laughter as he made a wisecrack during a
discussion about Ivy League law schools.  Neither the court’s official transcript yesterday nor the
audio recording is clear as to exactly what Thomas said. He
jumped into the conversation while Justice Antonin Scalia was
asking a Louisiana prosecutor about the adequacy of a criminal
defendant’s lawyers.  The lawyer, Carla S. Sigler, confirmed first that one
member of the defense team was a graduate of Yale Law School and
then that a second attended Harvard Law School. Scalia, a
Harvard graduate, responded, “son of a gun.”  Thomas, a Yale graduate who until recently had a strained
relationship with the school, quipped that a Yale degree could
be a sign of incompetence, rather than competence, according to
 Scotusblog , which tracks the court and is sponsored by Bloomberg
Law.  The transcript then indicates laughter, after which Sigler
responded, “I would refute that, Justice Thomas.”  Thomas hadn’t asked a question at argument since Feb. 22,
2006, when he interjected in a South Carolina death penalty
case. Since then, he had limited his courtroom comments to
summaries of his opinions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
