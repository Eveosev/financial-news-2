Energy, water and food are
“inextricably linked,” and imbalances between the three
systems can cause adverse impacts to the economy and ecosystems,
according to a report from the  Grace Communications Foundation .  Examples of the linkage include power use in  California  and
freshwater consumption in the U.S., according to an e-mailed
statement today from the foundation. Moving drinking water and
treating wastewater requires about 20 percent of California’s
electricity, and a quarter of U.S. freshwater is effectively
wasted when food is discarded, an amount that’s nearly
equivalent to the volume of Lake Erie, the foundation said.  Its “Food, Water and Energy: Know the Nexus”  report ,
released today, underscores public health, economic and
environmental issues that arise when food, water and energy
become unbalanced, and the foundation said the U.S. government
lacks policies that account for the complex relationships
between the three systems.  “We hope to stimulate a much broader conversation to help
knock down the silo approach of isolated resource management,”
Scott Cullen, executive director of the New York-based
foundation, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
