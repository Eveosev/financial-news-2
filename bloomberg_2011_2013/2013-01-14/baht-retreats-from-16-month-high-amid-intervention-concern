Thailand ’s baht retreated from a 16-
month high amid concern the central bank will intervene to slow
gains that hurt exports. Government bonds advanced.  The currency touched its strongest level since September
2011 as global investors bought $1.6 billion more of sovereign
notes than they sold this month through Jan. 11, and poured a
net $172 million into local equities, stock exchange and Thai
Bond Market Association data show. There is a broad-based
recovery in Thai exports even as weakness in Europe and  Japan 
persists, the Bank of Thailand said Jan. 9 after keeping its
policy rate unchanged at 2.75 percent.  “Funds are coming in and the baht has been
strengthening,” said Disawat Tiaowvanich, a foreign-exchange
trader at  Bangkok Bank Pcl. (BBL)  “The baht may move on the stronger
side as inflows will probably continue, but there is concern
about central bank action in the market, capping the baht’s
upside.”  The baht traded at 30.28 per dollar as of 8:20 a.m. in
Bangkok from 30.27 on Jan. 11 after reaching 30.14 earlier, the
strongest level since Sept. 14, 2011, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
expected moves in exchange rates used to price options, declined
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 4.08 percent.  Exports, which account for about two-thirds of  Southeast
Asia ’s second-largest economy, climbed 27 percent in November
after a 14 percent increase the previous month, a central bank
report showed on Dec. 28.  The yield on the 3.125 percent  government bonds  due
December 2015 fell one basis point to 2.96 percent, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
