Chinese investigators found that a
deputy provincial police chief in northern  China  helped cover up
his son’s drunken assault of a traffic officer and should be
fired, China Daily reported today.  Li Yali, who was suspended as deputy director of the public
security department in Shanxi Province over the incident last
month, abused his power to help his son after the traffic stop,
the newspaper reported.  The son, Li Zhengyuan, refused to cooperate and attacked a
traffic officer when he was stopped Oct. 13 after making an
illegal left turn, the newspaper said. His blood-alcohol level
was above the legal limit, it said.  Charges were never filed and video footage from
surveillance cameras near the scene of the traffic stop was
deleted, China Daily reported. If discipline officials agree
with the investigators, Li Yali will be removed from his post
permanently and stripped of his Communist Party membership, the
newspaper said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
