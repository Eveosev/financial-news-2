Earnings growth and the return of
investors to equities will extend the U.S. bull market into a
fifth year, said  Tobias Levkovich , the most accurate Wall Street
strategist on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index in 2012.  “We’re looking for another double-digit gain this year,”
Levkovich, chief U.S. equity strategist at Citigroup Inc., said
in a Bloomberg Television interview on “Surveillance” with  Tom Keene , Scarlet Fu and Sara Eisen. “You are supposed to buy when
the idea of buying gets you a little sick to your stomach.”  Levkovich, whose forecast at the beginning of 2012 for the
S&P 500 came within 2 points of where the index ended, forecasts
the S&P 500 will climb 13 percent to a record 1,615 this year,
the most bullish among the 15 strategists tracked in a Bloomberg
survey.  The  S&P 500  rallied 13 percent to 1,426.19 last year as
corporate earnings beat estimates and the  Federal Reserve 
expanded its bond purchase program to boost the economy. The
benchmark gauge is up more than 3 percent so far this year.  Analysts predict  profits  for companies in the S&P 500 will
rise 8.6 percent this year to a record $110.40 a share,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The U.S. equity gauge
 trades  at 14.8 times reported earnings, about 9.8 percent below
the six-decade average of 16.4, the data show.  Individual investors, who shunned stocks during the past
six years, have just started to change behavior. A record $3.1
billion flowed into U.S. stock funds in the first week of 2013,
according to data compiled by research firm EPFR Global, after
they investors withdrew $375 billion funds since the financial
crisis began in 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
