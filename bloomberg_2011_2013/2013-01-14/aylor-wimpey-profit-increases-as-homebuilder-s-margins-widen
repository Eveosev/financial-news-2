Taylor Wimpey Plc (TW/) , the U.K.’s
second-largest homebuilder by volume, said its 2012 operating
profit rose by more than 40 percent, at the upper end of the
company’s expectations, as margins widened.  Taylor Wimpey completed 10,886 homes in 2012, up from
10,180 a year earlier, and the average selling price rose 6
percent to 181,000 pounds ($292,000), the London-based company
said in a statement today. Lower mortgage rates will help
homebuyers this year, even though loans are still difficult to
obtain, the company said.  “We are delivering on the strategy that we set out in
2011, including a return to U.K. double-digit operating margin
ahead of schedule,” Chief Executive Officer Pete Redfern said
in the statement. The operating margin for all of 2012 exceeded
the first-half figure of 11.1 percent, Taylor Wimpey said.  Home sales growth by volume will probably slow this year
from the 7 percent increase seen in 2012, Redfern said on a
conference call. He predicted a “low single digit” gain.  Mortgage lending has been slow to recover from the
financial crisis as lenders clean up their balance sheets and
the U.K. economy struggles to recover from a double-dip
recession. Homebuilders are benefiting from the Bank of
England’s Funding for Lending Scheme, which helps banks offer
loans at more affordable rates.  Shock Protection  Such initiatives “protect the group, in part, from any
shocks in the mortgage market,” Anthony Codling and Sam Cullen
of Jefferies Group Inc. said in a note to investors today. The
analysts, who have a buy rating on the stock, raised their
estimates for pretax profit by 6 percent for 2013 and 3 percent
for 2014.  Taylor Wimpey fell 1.6 percent to 73.05 pence at the 4:30
p.m. close of trading in  London , the biggest decline among
stocks in the Bloomberg EMEA Homebuilders Index. On Jan. 11, the
shares closed at the highest since May 2008.  Before today, Taylor Wimpey had risen 92 percent in 12
months, the second-best performance in the index after  Barratt
Developments Plc (BDEV) , the biggest U.K. homebuilder by volume. The
index was up about 80 percent in the period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
