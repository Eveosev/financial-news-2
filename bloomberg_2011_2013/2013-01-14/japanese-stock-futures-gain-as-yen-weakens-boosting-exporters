Japanese stock futures rose,
indicating the  Nikkei 225  Stock Average will extend gains from a
23-month high when the market reopens after a holiday, amid
speculation a weakening yen will boost export earnings.  American Depositary Receipts  of Nissan Motor Co., which
gets about 80 percent of sales overseas, climbed 2.2 percent.
 Billabong International Ltd. (BBG)  shares may move when they resume
trading in Sydney after the surfwear maker received a takeover
offer from VF Corp. and Altamont Capital Partners that matches a
A$527 million ($556 million) bid from one of its directors.  Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in
March closed at 10,980 in Chicago yesterday, up from 10,830 at
the close in Osaka, Japan, on Jan. 11. Japan’s financial markets
were closed yesterday for a holiday. Futures were bid in the
pre-market at 10,960 in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time.
Australia’s  S&P/ASX 200 Index (AS51)  was little changed and New
Zealand’s NZX 50 Index advanced 0.1 percent.  “Although the Japanese market has already risen 24 percent
in local terms since Nov. 14, we believe Japanese equities still
enjoy further upside given low valuations and prevalent
underweight positions among global funds,” said  Michael Kurtz ,
Hong-Kong based head of global equity strategy at Nomura
Holdings Inc., Japan’s largest brokerage. Decisions on a new
 Bank of Japan  governor and a proposed consumption tax increase
“are likely to sustain further easing expectations, yen
weakening, and other stimulus measures, to the support of
Japanese equity prices.”  Election Boost  Japan’s Topix Index advanced 24 percent though Jan. 11 from
Nov. 14, when elections were announced, on expectations a new
government would call for more stimulus. The gauge is trading at
1.07 times book value, compared with 2.20 for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index and 1.59 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. The
Nikkei 225 closed at its highest level since February 2011 on
Jan. 11.  The yen dropped to 89.53 per dollar today, the weakest
level since June 2010. Speculation mounted that Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe will select a central-bank chief who will expand
monetary easing, accelerating the currency’s decline. A weaker
yen boosts overseas income for exporters when repatriated.  The choice of a successor to BOJ Governor  Masaaki
Shirakawa , whose term ends in April, will be made after
consultations with Yale Professor Emeritus Koichi Hamada and
others, Abe said Jan. 13 on public broadcaster NHK’s “Sunday
Debate” program. The BOJ meets next week.  Futures on the  S&P 500 Index  were little changed today. The
cash gauge yesterday declined 0.1 percent from near a five-year
high as Apple Inc.’s slump amid concern about iPhone sales
offset a rally in Dell Inc.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. rose 0.7 percent to 102.05 yesterday
in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
