China’s export and gross-domestic-
product data can be trusted even though they are not as reliable
as U.S. numbers, said Stanford professor Ed Lazear.  “If you look at their trade numbers, they are highly
volatile, but they do follow a pretty consistent pattern,”
Lazear, a former chairman of the  Council of Economic Advisers 
for President  George W. Bush , said on Bloomberg Television’s
“In the Loop” with  Betty Liu . “The trend is right.”  China’s recent growth in exports caused concern from
analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and other firms that data
from the nation may be unreliable. China reported a 14.1 percent
export increase last month.  Last November, the Treasury Department said that China
isn’t a currency manipulator under U.S. law, while the yuan is
undervalued. The yuan has gained 12.6 percent in real terms
against the dollar since June 2010, the Treasury Department
said.  “China’s numbers are nowhere near as accurate as ours,
their methodology is simply not at the same level as ours,” he
said. “But we certainly know they’re growing at very high
rates. I don’t worry too much about a half a percentage point or
even a percentage point one way or another.”  The weak value of the  yuan  against the dollar doesn’t have
a significant impact on trade, Lazear said.  “People tend to overplay exchange rates on exports,”
Lazear said. “There is a lot of rhetoric. The exchange rates
have some effect on trade, but the effects are small.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
