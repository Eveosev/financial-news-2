U.S.  Gulf Coast  gasoline
strengthened, rising from a two-week low, as  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) 
and Flint Hills Resources LLC shut units or were conducting
maintenance at refineries in  Corpus Christi ,  Texas .  Valero is carrying out planned work on an oleflex unit at
the Corpus Christi  West refinery , while Flint Hills reported
flaring associated with a shut unit at its Corpus Christi East
plant, the companies said today. With the ability to process a
combined 515,000 barrels a day, the plants make up almost 6
percent of  U.S. Gulf Coast capacity .  Reformulated gasoline on the Gulf gained 2 cents to trade
13.25  cents  a gallon below futures on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  at 4:04 p.m. The  differential  was 15.25 cents on Jan.
11, the widest gap since Dec. 27. The same fuel for prompt
delivery gained 3.46 cents to $2.6216 a gallon.  Shut units and maintenance on the Gulf Coast may help
reduce the regionâ€™s inventories of motor fuel, which rose 1.15
million barrels to  81.4 million  last week, according to the
Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the
Energy Department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
