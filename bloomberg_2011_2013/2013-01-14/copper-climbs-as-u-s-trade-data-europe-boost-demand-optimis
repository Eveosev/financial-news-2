Copper advanced after data showed a
jump in U.S. imports and on speculation that an economic
recovery in Europe may increase demand for metals.  The contract for delivery in three months on the London
Metal Exchange climbed as much as 0.6 percent to $8,095.25 a
metric ton, before trading at $8,089.75 at 11:38 a.m. in
Shanghai. It declined 0.5 percent last week.  U.S. imports gained 3.8 percent to $231.3 billion in
November, the most since April, while exports increased 1
percent to $182.6 billion. German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said Jan. 11 that the euro-area is “over the worst of
the crisis.”  “These are solid signs that the global economy is on the
upward trajectory, helping to improve  market sentiment ,” said
Ma Jian, an analyst at Orient Futures Co. in Shanghai.  Futures for April delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
traded little changed at 58,370  yuan  ($9,385) a ton. Copper for
March delivery on the Comex in New York rose 0.6 percent to
$3.6750 per pound. Net-long positions, or wagers on rising
prices, held by funds rose to 20,165 futures and options
contracts as of Jan. 8 from 15,924 a week earlier, according to
the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  On the LME, aluminum and zinc also gained, while lead,
nickel and tin were little changed.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
