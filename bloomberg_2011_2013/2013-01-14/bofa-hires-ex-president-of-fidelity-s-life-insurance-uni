Bank of America  Corp. hired Jeff Cimini, previously president of  Fidelity Investments  Life
Insurance Co., as head of personal retirement.  Cimini, 48, joined the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank
today, according to an internal Bank of America memo provided to
 Bloomberg News . His position, a new one, is responsible for
retirement-product strategy and innovation. Cimini reports to
David Tyrie, a managing director in the global wealth and
retirement solutions group at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  “It’s a perfect fit,” Tyrie said of Cimini in an
interview. “Jeff’s background on insurance and annuities can
help people frame how very sophisticated products and solutions
can fit into their overall outlook and plan.”  Workers are living longer and assuming more responsibility
for managing their retirement savings as U.S. companies shift
from traditional pension plans to 401(k)-type accounts, Tyrie
said. Innovations regarding retirement income will be a focus
for Bank of America Merrill Lynch this year, he said.  Cimini, who is based in  Boston , will oversee products and
strategies for the bank’s individual retirement accounts, 529
college savings plans, retirement-income solutions and
participant advice and guidance, Tyrie said.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch managed more than $500
billion in retirement assets as of Sept. 30.  Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Co. is a unit of
Fidelity Investments, the world’s second-biggest mutual-fund
company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
