China has set the minimum to which
regions must raise their water resource rates by the end of 2015
to narrow regional gaps and encourage reforms.  Beijing and Tianjin are required by 2015 to raise the fees,
the highest in the nation, to at least 1.6  yuan  (26 U.S. cents)
per cubic meter for surface water and 4 yuan per cubic meter for
ground water, the National Development and Reform Commission
said today on its website.  The lowest fees are set in 13 regions including  Shanghai ,
Chinaâ€™s biggest city, at 0.1 yuan per cubic meter for surface
water and 0.2 yuan per cubic meter for ground water.  Tariffs for drawing water under the ground are relatively
low and the fees fluctuate in regions with similar water-
resource and economic development status, the NDRC said. The
government on Jan. 6 issued  rules  and set quotas for usage
amounts to regulate the development of water resources for
conservation and protection.  Two-thirds of Chinese cities lack water, with the national
resource amount per capita equalling 28 percent of the average
globally,  China  News  reported  Feb. 16, citing Hu Siyi, vice
minister of the Ministry of Water Resources.  China will strictly control excessive exploration of ground
water while it will support reasonable usage for agriculture,
according to the statement. The nation will encourage recycling
water resources.  The country will punish the exceeding of quotas or plans,
at least doubling fees for excessive water usage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
