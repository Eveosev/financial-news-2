BP Plc failed to sell a cargo of
Forties blend for loading next month at an unchanged price from
its offer on Jan. 11. Total SA bid for the grade without success
at 10 cents less than BP’s offer.  Daily exports of the 12 main grades of  North Sea  crude for
loading in February will increase 13 percent to the most in
eight months, according to loading programs obtained by
Bloomberg News.  North Sea  BP offered Forties lot F0221 for loading Feb. 1 to Feb. 3
at 70 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent, the same level as
the previous session, without finding a buyer, a Bloomberg
survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts pricing
window showed. The grade last traded on Jan. 10 at a $1.15
premium.  The consignment was added to the February program, bringing
total shipments for next month to 20, said three people with
knowledge of the shipping schedule, asking not to be identified
as the information is confidential.  Total bid unsuccessfully at 60 cents more than the
benchmark for a Jan. 31 to Feb. 5 loading cargo, according to
the survey.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days dropped 68 cents to 67 cents a barrel more than
Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Brent for February settlement traded at $110.98 a barrel on
the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange in London at the close of the
window, compared with $110.02 in the previous session. The March
contract was at $110.09, a discount of 89 cents to February.  Exports of Flotta crude will be two cargoes of 600,000
barrels in February, one more than this month, according to a
loading plan obtained by  Bloomberg News .  The first shipment is scheduled for Feb. 4 to Feb. 6 and
the second on Feb. 26 to Feb. 28, the plan shows. Talisman
Energy Inc. operates the field.  Shipments of Brent, Forties, Oseberg, Ekofisk, Statfjord,
Gullfaks, Alvheim, Aasgard, DUC, Flotta, Grane and Troll blends
will total 57.7 million barrels, or 2.06 million barrels a day.
That compares with a revised 1.83 million barrels this month and
2.1 million in June.  Mediterranean/Urals  There were no bids or offers for Russian Urals for a third
day, according to the Platts survey.  The Urals differential to Dated Brent in the Mediterranean
was unchanged at minus 61 cents, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. In northwest Europe, the  discount  was unchanged for a
second day at $1.14, the data showed.  The Caspian Pipeline Consortium will boost daily crude
exports from the  Black Sea  in February by 11 percent from this
month, according to a program obtained by Bloomberg News.  The group, known as CPC, will ship 2.297 million metric
tons, compared with 2.288 million tons in January, according to
the schedule. That’s equal to about 636,597 barrels a day, up
from 572,738 this month.  West Africa  Benchmark Nigerian Qua Iboe blend fell 2 cents to $2.31 a
barrel more than Dated Brent, Bloomberg data show.  Indian Oil Corp., the nation’s largest refiner, extended
the closing date of a tender to buy crude for loading in March,
an amended document obtained by Bloomberg News shows.  The tender will now close at 3 p.m. local time on Jan. 23
with offers valid until 5 p.m. the next day, a week later than
originally scheduled, according to the document. IOC had last
week purchased four million barrels of West African crude for
loading in March.  Oil output in Congo Republic fell 10 percent to 98.6
million barrels last year and averaged about 270,000 barrels per
day, Serge Bwiti-Viaudo, chief of staff in the Petroleum
Ministry, said today in a statement in the capital, Brazzaville.
