Jordan’s King Abdullah II warned
that the stalemate in Palestinian-Israeli peace efforts and the
failure to revive the process would add to regional tension and
plunge it into the unknown, the official  news agency  reported.  If  Israel  continues to adopt a “fortress mentality,”
ignoring current political changes in the region, that would
work against its interests and leave it isolated from the rest
of the region, the king said during a meeting with delegates
from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee in Amman,
Petra said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
