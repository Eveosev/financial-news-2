Melanie Aitken , the former Canadian
competition watchdog, has rejoined Bennett Jones LLP to run the
law firm’s office in  Washington .  Aitken, who stepped down as Competition Bureau Commissioner
in September, will also act as co-head of the firm’s antitrust
and competition practice, according to a  statement  from Bennett
Jones. Aitken was a partner at Bennett Jones before moving to
the competition bureau in 2005.  Aitken developed a reputation as a guardian of Canada’s
antitrust rules in battles against companies such as Visa Inc.
and Air Canada. She also oversaw an increase of cases where
companies made concessions, such as selling assets, to get
mergers approved.  To contact the reporter on this story:
