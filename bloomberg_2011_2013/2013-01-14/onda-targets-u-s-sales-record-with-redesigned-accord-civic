Honda Motor Co. (7267)  is targeting record
sales for the U.S. this year, supported by revamped Accord and
Civic models and building on a 24 percent rebound in 2012.  The company’s best year in the U.S. was 1.55 million Honda
and Acura vehicles in 2007,  Tetsuo Iwamura , the Tokyo-based
automaker’s executive vice president, said today in  Detroit .  “We wish to exceed that,” he told reporters at the North
American International Auto Show. “We are trying to challenge
for record sales.’”  Japan’s third-largest automaker relies on the U.S. for more
than one-third of its global sales and was hurt in the market in
2011 after natural disasters in Asia disrupted production.
Output at the company’s North American plants rebounded last
year, to a record 1.69 million Honda and Acura autos. U.S sales
in 2012 climbed to 1.42 million.  The company expects to report 2012 global sales of about
4 million cars and light trucks, Iwamura said.  Honda later today is scheduled to show a concept “urban”
utility vehicle based on its Fit small car. The company’s U.S.
headquarters is in Torrance, California.  To contact the reporter on this story:
