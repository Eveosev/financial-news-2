Colombia ’s peso rose the most among
major Latin American currencies amid mounting speculation that a
 tax cut  will lure foreign investors and as companies exchange
dollars for the local currency to pay taxes.  The peso appreciated 0.3 percent to 1,759 per  U.S. dollar .
It touched 1,750.50 on Jan. 2, the strongest intraday level
since July 2011, and has gained 2.1 percent in the last month.  Foreign direct investment rose 11 percent in 2012 to a
record $16.7 billion. The government cut taxes on overseas
investors’ earnings from domestic securities to 14 percent from
33 percent as of Jan. 1 to help boost demand and reduce
borrowing costs.  “It looks like it’s more speculation of inflows than
actual flows coming in that are driving the peso,” said  Camilo Perez , head analyst at Banco de Bogota SA, the nation’s second-
biggest bank.  Central bank Governor Jose Dario Uribe said Jan. 2 on RCN
Radio that the peso is a concern and reiterated that Banco de la
Republica will buy a minimum of $20 million a day through at
least the first quarter to curb its advance, after printing
pesos to buy a record $4.8 billion in 2012.  Agriculture Minister Juan Camilo Restrepo urged the central
bank on Jan. 9 to increase dollar purchases to slow the
currency’s appreciation, which is making the nation’s coffee,
flower and banana exporters less competitive.  Peso Outlook  The peso may rally to 1,650 in the second quarter, Felipe Hernandez, a  Stamford , Connecticut-based economist at Royal Bank
of Scotland Group Plc, wrote in a note to clients today.
Companies converting dollars to pesos to pay income tax in
February, April and June are helping the local currency,
according to Hernandez.  “We expect additional but still gradual exchange rate
intervention consistent with our forecast for further currency
appreciation early in 2013,” Hernandez wrote. Capital controls
and “less transparent intervention could be possible at levels
close to our target” of 1,650, he wrote.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent peso-denominated debt
due in July 2024 fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point,
to 5.43 percent, the lowest since the securities were first
issued in 2009, according to the central bank. The price rose
0.042 centavo to 138.292 centavos per peso.  The “search for yield” amid near-zero  interest rates  in
the U.S.,  Europe  and  Japan  are leading to gains in government
peso bonds, known as TES, Perez said. “It’s clear there is a
lot of appetite for TES. Yields have fallen strongly across the
curve.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
