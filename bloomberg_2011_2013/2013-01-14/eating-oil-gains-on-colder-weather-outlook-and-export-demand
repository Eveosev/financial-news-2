Heating oil gained on speculation
that cold weather in the U.S. will boost demand for the fuel and
higher gasoil prices in  Europe  will attract shipments.  Futures rose for the first time in three days as the
 National Weather Service ’s Climate Prediction Center estimated
temperatures will be lower than normal across the Northeast from
Jan. 19 through Jan. 27. Gasoil rallied in Europe as the cold
deepened across the continent.  “This time of the year it’s supported by colder weather,”
said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in
Houston. “Gasoil tends to draw up heating oil since Europe is a
large importer of U.S. distillate.”  Heating oil for February delivery rose 3.03 cents, or 1
percent, to $3.0388 a gallon at 9:37 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Volume was 3.9 percent above the 100-day
average.  Temperatures in Frankfurt are forecast to drop to minus 6
degrees Celsius (21 Fahrenheit) on Jan. 19 from minus 1 today.
Germany is Europe’s largest heating oil market, according to
data from CustomWeather Inc. Freezing weather is also predicted
for London, Paris and Amsterdam this week, according to  weather
forecasts  compiled by Bloomberg.  Gasoil for February delivery rose $13.75, or 1.5 percent,
to $953.50 a metric ton on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in
 London .  The February heating oil crack spread, or premium of
heating oil over West Texas Intermediate crude on Nymex, jumped
$1.04 to $33.83 a barrel.  Gasoline for February delivery rose 0.46 cent to $2.7441 a
gallon on the exchange.  The average nationwide  retail price  for regular gasoline
fell 0.3 cent to $3.304 a gallon, AAA said today on its website.
