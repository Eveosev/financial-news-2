Steel reinforcement-bar futures
climbed the most in almost three weeks on speculation that data
will show  China’s economy  strengthened, boosting demand for the
material used in construction and housing.  Rebar for May delivery advanced 2 percent to 4,004 yuan
($643) a metric ton on the  Shanghai  Futures Exchange, the
biggest gain at close for the most-active contract since Dec.
25. The alloy tumbled 2.4 percent on Jan. 11, the most since
November, on speculation accelerating inflation would limit room
for easing to support a recovery.  China’s economic growth may have recovered to 7.8 percent
in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, after sliding to a
three-year low of 7.4 percent in the previous quarter, according
to the median  estimate  in a Bloomberg News survey before the
data on Jan. 18.  “The market generally believes positive economic data will
come out of the release and that boosted confidence,” Dang Man,
analyst at Maike Futures Co., said by phone from Shanghai.  The average spot  price  for rebar fell 0.3 percent to 3,739
 yuan  a ton today, according to data from Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co. Spot  iron ore  at Tianjin port
dropped 2.1 percent to $154.90 a dry ton on Jan. 11, according
to The Steel Index Ltd.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
