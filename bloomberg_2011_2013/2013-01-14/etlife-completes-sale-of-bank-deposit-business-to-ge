MetLife Inc. (MET) , the largest U.S. life
insurer, completed the sale of its deposit business to General
Electric Co. and is moving to deregister as a bank-holding
company to reduce U.S. oversight.  About $6.4 billion in bank deposits were transferred to GE
Capital Retail Bank, New York-based MetLife said today in a
statement, which didn’t give the terms of the deal.  MetLife Chief Executive Officer Steven Kandarian, 60, has
been blocked from raising the firm’s dividend or repurchasing
shares by the Federal Reserve, which weighed how the largest
U.S. lenders would fare in a financial crisis. The insurer is
now seeking permission from the Fed and Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. to end its bank status.  “The closing of the transaction with GE Capital is an
important step in the process of exiting retail banking,”
Kandarian said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
