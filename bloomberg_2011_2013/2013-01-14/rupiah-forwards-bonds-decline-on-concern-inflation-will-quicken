Indonesia ’s rupiah forwards weakened
and  government bonds  declined on concern inflation will
accelerate this year as the government reduces energy subsidies.  Global funds  pulled 1.29 trillion rupiah ($133 million)
from local-currency sovereign bonds last week through Jan. 10,
finance ministry data show.  Consumer-price gains  may quicken to
5.4 percent in 2013 from 4.3 percent last year due to increases
in electricity tariffs and the minimum wage, PT Mandiri
Sekuritas economist Leo Rinaldy wrote in a note today. The
central bank will respond to concerns over the current-account
deficit, which it estimates reached 2.3 percent last quarter,
the largest since at least 1997, Governor Darmin Nasution told
reporters on Jan. 11.  The rupiah’s one-month non-deliverable forwards declined
0.1 percent to 9,920 per dollar as of 3:22 p.m. in Jakarta, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. That is 2.5 percent weaker than the
onshore spot rate, which fell 0.4 percent to 9,670, according to
prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg. A daily fixing
used to settle non-deliverable forward contracts was set at
9,877 today by the Association of Banks in  Singapore .  “The gap between the forwards and the  spot market  keeps
widening as  Bank Indonesia  is committed to guarding the rupiah
onshore,” said Nurul Eti Nurbaeti, head of treasury research at
PT Bank Negara Indonesia. “There is concern over the economic
outlook, considering prospects for faster inflation and the
deficits on the trade and current accounts.”  The currency’s one-month implied volatility, a measure of
expected moves in exchange rates used to price options, was
unchanged at 6.75 percent, the highest level since September.  The government’s 5.25 percent notes due May 2018 declined
for the first time in four days, pushing the yield up one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 4.67 percent, according to
the Inter Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
