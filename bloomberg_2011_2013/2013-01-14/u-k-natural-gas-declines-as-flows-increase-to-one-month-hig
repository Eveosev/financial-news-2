U.K. natural gas fell, trimming a
two-week advance, as higher demand was met with the biggest
flows in a month.  Next-day and month-ahead gas declined, according to broker
data compiled by Bloomberg. Demand in the 24 hours to 6 a.m.
tomorrow was predicted at 357 million cubic meters, compared
with a seasonal normal of 309 million,  National Grid Plc (NG/)  data
show. Flows earlier reached 403 million cubic meters a day, the
most since Dec. 14, grid data show.  Gas for tomorrow fell 1.1 percent to 68 pence a therm at
4:24 p.m.  London  time.  Month-ahead gas  dropped 0.4 percent to
67.2 pence a therm. That’s equivalent to $10.79 per million
British thermal units and compares with $3.38 per million Btu of
front-month U.S. gas.  The low temperature in London will be minus 3 degrees
Celsius (26 Fahrenheit) tomorrow and minus 5 on Jan. 16,
compared with a 10-year median of 4 degrees, CustomWeather Inc.
data on Bloomberg shows.  Shipments from  Norway , the U.K.’s largest source of
imported gas, were at a rate of 114 million cubic meters a day,
after rising to as much as 132 million, compared with a 10-day
average of 113 million, Gassco AS data show.  Output for  Statoil ASA (STL) ’s gas fields is reduced by a net 3.2
million cubic meters a day today, with availability increased by
4.2 million and decreased by 7.2 million, data on the company’s
website showed.  Gas accounted for 35 percent of U.K. power production at
4:20 p.m., grid data show. Coal generated 39 percent, nuclear 17
percent and wind 4.5 percent.  Electricity for tomorrow rose 0.9 percent to 54 pounds a
megawatt-hour, broker data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
