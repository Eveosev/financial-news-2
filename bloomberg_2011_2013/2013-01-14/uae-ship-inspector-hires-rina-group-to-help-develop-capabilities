Abu Dhabi-based Emirates
Classification – Tasneef, a classification society specializing
in the maritime sector, hired RINA Group to help develop its
ability to inspect and certify ships for safety.  Tasneef and Genova, Italy-based RINA, a marine
classification and service company, are planning 44 projects
this year including certifying new and existing vessels and
helping administer the United Arab Emirate’s shipping registry,
Rashed Alhebsi, head of the Establishment Committee of Tasneef,
said in an e-mailed statement today.  The two companies will work together on newbuilding
projects and ships in service to develop Tasneef’s procedures
and technical competence, Andrea di Bella, Middle East area
manager at RINA, said in the statement. “We expect this to be
the beginning of a long partnership as the UAE further expands
its maritime interests.”  Classification societies verify that ships comply with
safety regulations. RINA is one of the 13 members of the London-
based International Association of Classification Societies Ltd.
