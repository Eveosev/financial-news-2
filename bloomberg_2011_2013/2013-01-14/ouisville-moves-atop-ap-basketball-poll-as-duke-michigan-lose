The  University of Louisville  took
the No. 1 spot in the  Associated Press ’s Top 25 college
basketball poll after the sport’s last four undefeated teams
were beaten.  Louisville, which downed  Seton Hall  and South Florida last
week to raise its record to 15-1, climbed two spots in the
 ranking  after previously unbeaten Duke and Michigan lost.  The Cardinals received 36 of 65 first-place votes and 1,591
points, followed by Indiana, which drew 13 first-place votes,
and Duke, with 14 first-place votes after the 84-76 loss at
North Carolina State. Kansas is fourth and Michigan fifth, each
getting one first-place vote.  Syracuse is sixth and Arizona is seventh after falling
70-66 to Oregon for its first loss of the season. Unranked
Wyoming also lost, leaving no remaining unbeaten teams at the
highest level of college basketball.  To contact the reporter on this story:
