Malaysia will allow shipments of
crude  palm oil  at zero duty for another month in February as the
second-largest producer seeks to reduce record stockpiles and
boost competition with  Indonesia , the top supplier.  “The tax for this coming month will still be zero,”
Plantation Industries and Commodities Minister Bernard Dompok
said in Kuala Lumpur today. Stockpiles should start to decline
and a level below 2 million metric tons will be “quite
comfortable,” he said, without giving a timeframe.  Inventories in Malaysia rose 2.4 percent to 2.63 million
tons in December from a revised 2.57 million tons a month
earlier, according to the Malaysian Palm Oil Board. Palm dropped
23 percent last year as reserves expanded while slowdowns in
Europe and China hurt demand. Indonesia, where the  tax rate  is
set at 7.5 percent, is considering cutting it to zero, trade
minister  Gita Wirjawan  said Jan. 11.  “Any actions by either Malaysia or Indonesia, as the two
biggest producers of palm oil, will have an impact on prices and
the economy,” said Dompok, when asked about possible moves.  Increased competition from Indonesia may erode Malaysian
exports and could deepen the  bear market  in Kuala Lumpur, the
regional futures benchmark, while benefiting importers such as
 India , China and  Pakistan . Malaysia may produce 18.9 million
tons this year, said Choo Yuen May, director-general of the palm
oil board. Output in 2012 was 18.78 million tons, Dompok said.  Tax Cuts  The contract for delivery in March traded little changed at
2,370 ringgit ($785) a ton on the  Malaysia  Derivatives Exchange
at 5:35 p.m. after climbing 1.4 percent to 2,402 ringgit.
Futures fell 4 percent last week, the most since Nov. 9, and are
down 2.8 percent this year.  The Malaysian government said in October it would cut the
export tax to 4.5 percent to 8.5 percent, from 23 percent,
starting Jan. 1, to reduce reserves. The tariff for January was
set at zero as the base price was below the 2,250 ringgit
threshold that triggers the 4.5 percent rate. Indonesia cut
taxes in 2011, making local crude palm cheaper than in Malaysia.  “News that Malaysia is going to extend the zero export tax
for February is positive for exports,” Chung Yang Ker, an
analyst at Phillip Futures Pte., said from  Singapore .  Exports from Malaysia fell 25 percent to 373,462 tons in
the first 10 days of January from 499,732 tons in the same
period last month, Intertek said Jan. 10. Shipments dropped 34
percent to 343,081 tons, according to Societe Generale de
Surveillance. Rabobank International, which in November picked
palm as likely to be the best-performing farm commodity in 2013,
said Jan. 10 prices will remain range-bound in the coming weeks.  Biodiesel Plan  Stockpiles should start declining with the implementation
of the so-called B10 biodiesel blending program, the tree
replanting scheme spread across 100,000 hectares (247,105 acres)
and as economies in consuming countries recover, Dompok said.
The B10 program to blend 10 percent of palm biodiesel with
petroleum diesel for the “unsubsidized sector,” will raise
consumption by 300,000 tons a year, the Ministry of Plantation
Industries and Commodities said in a statement in October.  Imports by  China , the biggest cooking oil consumer, are set
to plunge this month after the government imposed more stringent
inspections on shipments. Palm oil purchases may be 300,000 tons
in January, less than half of those in December, according to
Bloomberg survey published today.  China’s quality watchdog, the General Administration of
Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine, toughened
inspections on imports from Jan. 1 to improve  food safety .  The Malaysian Palm Oil Board has engaged the Chinese
authorities on the regulations, said Dompok.  “They are trying to improve food safety generally in China,
not just focused on the palm oil industry,” he said. “There’s
no clarity yet.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
