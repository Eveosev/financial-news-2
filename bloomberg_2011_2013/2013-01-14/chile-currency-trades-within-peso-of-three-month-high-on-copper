Chile ’s peso depreciated the most in
three weeks amid speculation that the central bank will
intervene to weaken the currency at its Jan. 17 meeting.  The currency fell 0.4 percent to 473.7 per  U.S. dollar  at
the close in Santiago. Copper fell 0.5 percent on the Comex in
 New York .  Speculation that the central bank will act to slow the
appreciation of the peso, as it did by purchasing $12 billion in
2011, has increased after the currency reached 469.1 per dollar
on Jan. 8. Copper, Chile’s top export, dropped to a two-week low
today as a slump in U.S. equities sparked concern the economic
recovery may slow.  “It’s the noise about intervention from the central
bank,” said Francisco Schneider, head of foreign  currency
trading  at Celfin Capital SA in Santiago, explaining today’s
peso decline. “This week is important, with the central bank
meeting on Thursday. The market is cautious. No one wants to be
short dollars.”  The peso has traded within a range of 475 to 469 per dollar
since the beginning of this month as concern that the central
bank will buy dollars to weaken the currency prevented it from
appreciating.  Finance Minister Felipe Larrain said on Jan. 8 the
government shared exporters’ concern about the appreciation of
the peso, which has gained 4 percent in the past six months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
