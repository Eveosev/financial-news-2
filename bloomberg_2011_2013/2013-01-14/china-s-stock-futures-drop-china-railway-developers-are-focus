China’s stocks  rose the most in a
month after the head of the securities regulator said the nation
can increase by 10 times the size of two investment programs
that allow foreign investors to buy securities.  China can raise quotas to allow foreigners as well as
offshore  yuan  holders in Hong Kong to buy stocks and bonds in
the mainland, said Guo Shuqing, Chairman of the China Securities
Regulatory Commission. Citic Securities Co. led a rally for
brokerages on the prospect that increased demand for equities
would boost profit.  Hebei Sailhero Environmental Protection
High-tech Co. (300137)  jumped 10 percent and Tasly Pharmaceutical Group
Co. surged to a record high as worsening pollution in Beijing
may spur demand for health care and environmental protection.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  rose 3.1 percent to 2,311.74
at the close, the biggest advance since Dec. 14. The  CSI 300
Index (SHSZ300)  jumped 3.8 percent to 2,577.73, as gauges of financial,
technology and health-care companies jumped more than 4 percent.
The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  added 1.3 percent.  “Guo’s comments are very significant as it shows the
government is trying to get bullish on stocks and it’s a policy
signal as well,” Hao Hong, Hong Kong-based managing director of
research at Bank of Communications Co., said in a phone
interview. China is trying to improve the quality of its
economic growth and investing in environmental technology and
health care fit into this plan, he said.  The Shanghai measure has risen 18 percent from an almost
four-year low on Dec. 3, while the CSI 300 climbed 22 percent on
signs economic growth is picking up. Government reports last
week showed exports expanding more than economists forecast,
while inflation accelerated.  Financials Rally  A gauge of brokerages, banks and developers in the CSI 300
jumped 4.8 percent, the most among 10 industry groups and the
steepest gain since Dec. 14. Citic Securities, the biggest
brokerage, climbed 6.9 percent to 13.59 yuan.  Haitong Securities
Co. (600837) , the second largest, added 7 percent to 10.26 yuan.  China can raise the level of quotas for the  Renminbi 
Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors and the Qualified
Foreign Institutional Investors programs, Guo said at a
conference in Hong Kong today.  RQFII allows offshore yuan in Hong Kong to be invested in
mainland’s securities while QFII permits foreigners to buy yuan-
denominated stocks and bonds. Regulators have since 2003
approved a combined QFII quota of $36.04 billion as of Nov. 30,
the State Administration of Foreign Exchange said on Dec. 11.  QDII2 Program  The government scrapped a ceiling on investments by
overseas sovereign wealth funds and central banks in its capital
markets last month, part of government efforts to encourage
long-term foreign ownership and shore up slumping equities.  China  has also started preparations for a trial program
that would allow individuals to invest in overseas capital
markets as the nation seeks a greater role for its currency in
global finance.  The People’s Bank of China will proactively prepare for the
trial of its qualified domestic individual investor program, it
said in a statement on its website on Jan. 11, without giving
further details. The central bank lists the so-called QDII2
initiative as one of its major goals for 2013.  Hebei Sailhero surged by the 10 percent daily cap to 15.25
yuan.  Beijing SJ Environmental Protection and New Material Co. 
rose 4.2 percent to 12.38 yuan. Nanjing CEC Environmental
Protection Co. rallied 5.1 percent to 13.62 yuan.  “Thematic plays such as environmental-protection stocks
are good investments,” said Wu Kan, a Shanghai-based fund
manager at Dazhong Insurance Co., which oversees $285 million.  Unhealthy Air  Beijing ordered government vehicles off the roads as part
of an emergency response to ease air pollution that has
smothered China’s capital for the past three days, while warning
the smog will persist until Jan. 16.  Official measurements of PM2.5, fine airborne particulates
that pose the largest health risks, rose as high as 993
micrograms per cubic meter in Beijing on Jan. 12, compared with
World Health Organization guidelines of no more than 25. It was
as high as 500 at 6 a.m. today. Long-term exposure to fine
particulates raises the risk of cardiovascular and respiratory
diseases as well as lung cancer, according to the WHO.  Hualan Biological Engineering Inc. (002007)  led gains for  health-
care stocks , jumping 10 percent to 24.85 yuan. Tasly
Pharmaceutical surged 3.8 percent to 57.21 yuan.  Average trading volumes on the Shanghai Composite were 38
percent higher than the 30-day average. Thirty-day  volatility  in
the gauge was at 21.3, compared with last year’s average of
17.1. The measure trades at 12.8 times reported earnings,
compared with the seven-year average of 21.4, according to  data 
compiled by Bloomberg since 2006.  Economic Outlook  The “uptrend” for Chinese equities remains unchanged,
David Li, UBS AG chairman and country head for China, said in an
interview in Bloomberg’s Shanghai office. China’s stocks are
poised to rise 20 percent this year, bolstered by the
government’s efforts to boost domestic spending and accelerate
urban development, he said.  Government data last week showed overseas shipments rose
14.1 percent from a year earlier last month, the most since May
and more than double the 5 percent median of 40 economists’
estimates.  December economic data including industrial production and
fixed-asset investment as well as a report on fourth-quarter
gross domestic product are due on Jan. 18. Economic growth may
have recovered to 7.8 percent in the fourth quarter from a year
earlier, after sliding to a three-year low of 7.4 percent in the
previous period, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey.  The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN)  fell 1.1 percent in New
York on Jan. 11. It lost 0.4 percent last week for the first
weekly slump since the end of November. The iShares FTSE China
25 Index Fund, the largest Chinese exchange-traded fund in the
U.S., declined 1 percent to $41.09 Jan. 11, extending its weekly
loss to 1.3 percent.  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Allen Wan, Chan Tien Hin  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
