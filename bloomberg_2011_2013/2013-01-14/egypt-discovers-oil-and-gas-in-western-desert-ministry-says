Egypt â€™s state-run General Petroleum
Co. made an oil and natural gas discovery in the Western Desert
and plans to drill nine wells to develop the concession, the Oil
Ministry said today.  The find has reserves estimated at about 16.5 billion cubic
feet of gas and 48 million barrels of crude, the Cairo-based
ministry said in an e-mail. The company, also known as GPC, and
Kuwait Energy Co. made two joint discoveries in the same area,
the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
