French Finance Minister  Pierre Moscovici  said that France met its deficit target last year as
state spending declined.  The French state’s budget deficit was 87.2 billion euros
last year, according to the finance ministry’s latest estimate,
Moscovici said in an e-mailed statement.  Total state spending fell by 300,000 euros, its first ever
decline, as President  Francois Hollande ’s government benefited
from lower debt-service charges. The entire 2.5 billion-euros
saved due to lower interest rates were channelled into deficit
reduction, Moscovici said.  The improvement is also thanks to an “exemplary” spending
discipline, Moscovici said.  A final estimate of France’s 2012 deficit, including local
government and social security finances, will be published at
the end of March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
