Alcatel-Lucent’s submarine network’s
unit should remain in French hands, Digital Technology Minister
Fleur Pellerin said, according to an interview published in Les
Echos newspaper.  “The know-how of Alcatel Submarine Netwroks is unique,”
Pellerin was quoted as saying. It’s a “strategic asset” and
“we favor a solution that keeps the business intact and based
in  France . Any purchases of stakes will be subject to a review
by the treasury under the foreign investment decree.”  Pellerin also said that the French government favors having
four mobile phone operators in the country. “A merger, which
would imply the disappearance of one operator, would be seen as
a defeat,” the minister was quoted as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
