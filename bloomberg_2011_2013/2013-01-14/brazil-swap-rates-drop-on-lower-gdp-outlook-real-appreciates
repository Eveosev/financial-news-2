Brazil ’s swap rates fell to a three-
week low after economists cut their 2013 growth forecast,
bolstering bets that the central bank will refrain from
increasing borrowing costs at its policy meeting this week.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2015 dropped four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point to 7.69 percent at 9:58
a.m. in Sao Paulo, the lowest on a closing basis since Dec. 19.
The real appreciated 0.1 percent to 2.0322 per dollar.  Brazil’s gross domestic product will expand 3.20 percent
this year, according to the median forecast in a central bank
survey of about 100 analysts published today. They projected in
the prior week 3.26 percent economic growth. Policy makers have
left the benchmark  rate  unchanged at a record low 7.25 percent
since October.  “There should be no debate,”  Newton Rosa , the chief
economist at SulAmerica Investimentos in Sao Paulo, said by
phone. “They will leave the rate unchanged.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
