South  Korea ’s won fell for the first
time in a week on speculation authorities may take steps to slow
the currency’s appreciation after it reached a 17-month high
last week.  Government bonds  declined.  The won fell 0.1 percent to 1,055.80 per dollar as of 10:21
a.m. in  Seoul , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
rallied 0.9 percent last week and closed at 1,054.69 on Jan. 11,
the strongest level since Aug. 2, 2011. The won advanced 8.3
percent in 2012, the best performance among the 11-most traded
Asian currencies.  The  Bank of Korea  kept its  seven-day repurchase rate  at
2.75 percent on Jan. 11, with Governor Kim Choong Soo saying
that day the central bank’s role is to control volatility in the
currency through “smoothing” operations. Finance Minister Bahk
Jae Wan said on Jan. 2 that he’s concerned about herd behavior
in the  currency market  and may introduce measures to curb the
won’s volatility.  “Concern that authorities may take action to stem the
won’s gains are keeping the won weaker,” said Jeon Seung Ji, a
currency analyst at Samsung Futures Inc. in Seoul. “Still, some
investors bet the won will rise after the central bank left
rates unchanged.”  The yield on South Korea’s 2.75 percent bonds due September
2017 rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 2.88
percent, according to Korea Exchange prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
