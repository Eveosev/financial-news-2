Rates to ship liquefied natural gas
will decline this year as new vessels join the fleet more
quickly than global output of the fuel expands, according to
 Wells Fargo Securities LLC .  “We expect LNG carrier spot rates to ease slightly in 2013
(but generally stay at healthy levels), as the rapid rate upside
following the Fukushima nuclear disaster continues to plateau,
and as the global carrier fleet starts to grow in advance of a
major liquefaction inflection point in 2015/2016,”  Michael Webber , a New York-based analyst at the bank, said in an e-
mailed report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
