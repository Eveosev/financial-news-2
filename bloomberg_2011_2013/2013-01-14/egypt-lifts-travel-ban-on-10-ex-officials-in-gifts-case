Egypt ’s top prosecutor has lifted a
travel ban on 10 former Hosni Mubarak-era officials after they
repaid the value of gifts they were said to have received from
leading state-run newspaper Al-Ahram, according to a website
owned by the publication’s group.  The order issued by Prosecutor-General Talaat Abdullah
removed bans and an asset freeze placed on officials including
former Prime Minister Ahmed Nazif and Fathi Sorour, the former
head of the parliament’s lower house, the Ahram Gate website
reported. The site cited an unidentified judicial official as
saying the order was temporary, pending further investigations
into the gifts allegedly doled out between 2006 and 2011 by
former top officials at the newspaper.  The government has already received 8 million Egyptian
pounds ($1.2 million) from the ex-officials since the
investigation started, Ahram Gate reported, citing Public Funds
Prosecution attorney-general Mostafa El-Husseiny.  Financial prosecutors yesterday approved a request by
Mubarak to repay 18 million Egyptian pounds in connection with
reported gifts from the newspaper. Authorities had ordered the
former leader held for 15 days pending investigations into the
charges linked to the so-called “Ahram Gifts” case.  The offer to settle the case came after a court overturned
Mubarak’s life sentence over his failing to stop protester
deaths during the uprising that ousted him in 2011. He was
ordered to be retried, though no hearing date has been set.  To contact the reporter on this story:
