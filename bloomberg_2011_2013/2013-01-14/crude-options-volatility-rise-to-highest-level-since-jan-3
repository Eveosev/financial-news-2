Crude options volatility rose to the
highest level since Jan. 3 as underlying futures advanced.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
March, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 22.24 percent on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  as of 4:10 p.m., compared with 22.06 percent yesterday.
February options expire Jan. 16.  Crude oil for March delivery rose 60 cents to $94.59 a
barrel on the Nymex. February-delivery crude oil advanced 58
cents to $94.14 a barrel, the highest settlement for the front-
month contract since Sept. 17.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
March $120 calls, which were unchanged at 4 cents a barrel on
volume of 867 contracts at 3:21 p.m. in  New York . March $85 puts
were the second-most active, with 1,463 lots exchanged as they
fell 6 cents to 40 cents a barrel.  Bets that prices would fall, or puts, accounted for 50.2
percent of electronic trading volume.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  In the previous session, bearish bets accounted for 54
percent of the 102,861 contracts traded.  March $90 puts were the most active options with 4,716
contracts changing hands. They rose 7 cents to 7 cents a barrel.
March $110 calls fell 1 cent to 10 cents on 4,601 lots.  Open interest was highest for February $105 calls with
31,541 contracts. Next were March $110 calls at 31,422 and March
