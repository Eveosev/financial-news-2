Leef Dierks, the London-based head
of covered bond strategy at  Morgan Stanley (MS) , is leaving the bank,
according to a person familiar with the matter.  Dierks is going as part of job cuts planned by the New
York-based firm, said the person, who asked not to be named
because theyâ€™re not authorized to speak on the matter. He joined
in 2010 from Barclays Plc, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Hugh Fraser, a London-based spokesman at Morgan Stanley,
declined to comment.  Morgan Stanley is eliminating about 1,600 jobs worldwide
from its investment bank and support staff, with half the
reductions in the U.S., a person with direct knowledge of the
matter said on Jan. 9.  Covered bonds are a form of bank financing backed by
mortgages or public sector loans and guaranteed by the issuer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
