Hewlett-Packard Corp.’s Autonomy
Corp. software unit, which contributed to a $8.8 billion
writedown last year, will eliminate some jobs related to a
product that recognizes images using a mobile device’s camera.  The undisclosed number of job cuts at Aurasma, a digital
display technology unit, will be offset by hiring more than 50
engineers at Autonomy for research and development, according to
a memo sent to employees by Robert Youngjohns, Hewlett-Packard’s
senior vice president for information management in charge of
Autonomy.  Hewlett-Packard Chief Executive Officer  Meg Whitman  is
seeking to turn around the  Palo Alto , California-based company
after five straight quarters of declining sales and years of
botched deals, management tumult and strategic missteps.
Hewlett-Packard, which agreed to buy Autonomy in 2011 for $10.3
billion as it sought to compete in the market for business-data
services, wrote down the bulk of the investment after accusing
the software company of miscategorizing sales.  “While a number of roles will remain largely unaffected by
this, other roles within Aurasma will no longer be required
going forward and some work force reduction is likely,”
Youngjohns said in an e-mail to Autonomy employees that was
provided by Hewlett-Packard.  Hewlett-Packard will continue to invest in Autonomy and
devote resources to the business, and also focus on revenue
generation for Aurasma, Youngjohns said in the memo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
