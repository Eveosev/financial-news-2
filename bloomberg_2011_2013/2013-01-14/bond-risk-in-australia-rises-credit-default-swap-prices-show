The cost of insuring corporate bonds
from non-payment in Australia increased, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index rose 0.5 basis point to
113.5 basis points as of 11:34 a.m. in Sydney, according to
Westpac Banking Corp. prices. The gauge has fallen 14 basis
points since Dec. 31, extending a 53 basis-point drop in 2012,
CMA data show.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  was unchanged at 106 as of 8:50 a.m. in
 Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices show. The
measure has declined 7.4 basis points this year, after sliding
93 basis points in 2012, according to data provider CMA.  Markets in Japan are closed today for a public holiday.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
