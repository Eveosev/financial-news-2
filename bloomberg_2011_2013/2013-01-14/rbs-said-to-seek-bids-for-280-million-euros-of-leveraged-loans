Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, 
the U.K.’s biggest government-owned bank, is seeking bids for
280 million euros ($374 million) of leveraged loans it owns,
according to two people with knowledge of the matter.  The loans are being sold in a so-called bids-wanted-in-
competition, or BWIC, process where the highest offer above the
reserve price wins, said the people, who asked not to be named
because the sale is private. Bids are due by 2 p.m.  London  time
tomorrow, the people said.  The portfolio includes loans to Formula One, the auto-
racing series partly owned by CVC Capital Partners Ltd., Kion
Group GmbH, a forklift truck producer, and UPC Broadband Holding
BV, a unit of  John Malone ’s Liberty Global Inc., the people
said.  Rebecca Nelson, a spokeswoman in London for RBS, declined
to comment on the sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
