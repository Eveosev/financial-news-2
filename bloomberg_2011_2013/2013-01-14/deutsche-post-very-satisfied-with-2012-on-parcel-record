Deutsche Post AG (DPW) , Europe’s largest
postal service, is “very satisfied” with performance in 2012
after record Christmas-season parcel volume in  Germany , the mail
carrier’s biggest market.  Deutsche Post delivered 7 million parcels a day in its home
nation prior to the Dec. 25 holiday as shoppers ordered more
gifts online, Chief Financial Officer Larry Rosen said today in
a company newsletter. Deutsche Post’s mail division will benefit
from expected growth in the German parcel market of as much as 7
percent a year through 2020, when consumers will spend one-fifth
of their money online, Rosen said.  Electronic commerce will help stabilize the Bonn-based
company’s earnings as traditional mail volume shrinks and
persistent economic troubles in  Europe  hamper Deutsche Post’s
ability to forecast its DHL express and freight brand’s
performance. Deutsch Post reiterated today that it plans to
increase earnings at DHL to as much as 2.9 billion euros ($3.9
billion) by 2015, from an expected 2 billion euros in 2012.  “We won’t have an easy year in 2013, given the remaining
uncertainty of the economic outlook,” Rosen said in the
newsletter. At the same time, “we are positioned to operate
more robustly and flexibly than ever before, making us well-
prepared for economic setbacks.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
