U.S. nuclear-power generation
advanced, led by the Southeastern regionâ€™s highest level of
output in 17 months, as the  Tennessee Valley Authority  restored
a reactor in Alabama to full capacity.  U.S. nuclear output increased 0.6 percent to 93,881
megawatts, or 92 percent of capacity, the highest level in 10
days, according to U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission data
compiled by Bloomberg. Production was 1.7 percent more than a
year ago, with eight of 104 reactors offline.  Tennessee Valley Authority boosted its 1,065-megawatt
Browns Ferry 1 reactor to full power. The plant, 32 miles west
of Huntsville, Alabama, was 50 percent operational two days ago.
Generation in the Southeast, known as Region 2 by the
commission, rose to 30,083 megawatts,  the highest level  since
August 2011.  Exelon Corp. (EXC)  restored the 1,112-megawatt Peach Bottom 3
plant to full capacity after the unit, 18 miles (30 kilometers)
south of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, dropped to 75 percent capacity
yesterday.  Reactor maintenance shutdowns, usually undertaken in the
U.S. spring or fall when energy use is at its lowest, may
increase consumption of natural gas and coal to generate
electricity. The average refueling down time was 43 days in
2011, according to the  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:
