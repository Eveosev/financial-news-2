Japan ’s top currency official said
his nation isn’t engaged in “competitive” devaluation, after
the yen broke 120 per euro and a U.S. Federal Reserve official
expressed concern at the nation’s foreign-exchange policy.  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe “and the new cabinet don’t have
any intention of competitive devaluation,” Vice Finance
Minister Takehiko Nakao said at a forum in Hong Kong today.
“The yen’s depreciation is a correction, or an adjustment from
previous excessive appreciation.”  Abe’s campaign to spur growth and aid exporters by driving
down the yen is triggering concern that other nations may match
him with moves to weaken their currencies. In the U.S., Federal
Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard said Jan. 10
that he’s “a little disturbed” by Japan’s stance and the risk
of “beggar-thy-neighbor” policies.  The yen traded as weak as 120.13 per euro today, going
beyond 120 for the first time since May 2011. The currency was
at 119.93 as of 1:19 p.m. in  Tokyo  and at 89.58 per dollar.  Abe’s “very strong remarks” about his commitment to
exiting deflation are “not the only reason” for the yen’s
slide, Nakao said. Stability in  Europe , some signs of recovery
in the U.S. and a temporary agreement in the U.S. on delaying
spending cuts and tax increases are also factors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
