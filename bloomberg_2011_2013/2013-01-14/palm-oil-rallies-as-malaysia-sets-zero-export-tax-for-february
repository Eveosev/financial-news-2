Palm oil  gained the most in more
than a week after Malaysia, the world’s second-largest producer,
said it will allow duty-free exports of the crude variety for a
second month in February to boost shipments.  The contract for delivery in March climbed as much as 1.4
percent to 2,402 ringgit ($796) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange, the biggest increase since Jan. 2, and
ended the morning session at 2,387 ringgit in Kuala Lumpur.
Futures fell 4 percent last week, the most since the five days
ending Nov. 9.  Malaysia, which has a record inventory amid falling
exports, has set the tax for shipment of crude oil at zero,
Plantation Industries and Commodities Minister Bernard Dompok
said in  Kuala Lumpur  today. The country changed its export-tax
structure from Jan. 1 to reduce reserves. Stockpiles rose 2.4
percent an all-time high of 2.63 million tons in December from a
revised 2.57 million tons a month earlier, according to the
Malaysian Palm Oil Board.  “News that Malaysia is going to extend the zero export tax
for February is positive for exports,” Chung Yang Ker, an
analyst at Phillip Futures Pte., said from  Singapore . “There
has been a technical rebound after last week’s sharp loss.”  Exports dropped 25 percent to 373,462 tons in the first 10
days of January from a revised 499,732 tons in the first 10 days
of December, Intertek said last week. Shipments retreated 34
percent, according to Societe Generale de Surveillance.  Refined palm oil for delivery in May increased 1.1 percent
to 6,712  yuan  ($1,080) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange .
 Soybean oil  for May rose 0.8 percent to 8,556 yuan a ton.  Soybeans for March delivery gained 1.3 percent to $13.905 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybean oil for delivery
in March advanced 1.1 percent to 49.76 cents a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
