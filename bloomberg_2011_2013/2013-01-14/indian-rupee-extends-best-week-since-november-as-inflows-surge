India ’s rupee rose the most in more
than a week on optimism the slowest inflation in three years
will spur demand for the nation’s assets.  The benchmark  wholesale-price  index rose 7.18 percent from
a year earlier in December, official figures showed today.
That’s the slowest pace since December 2009 and less than the
7.37 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg survey. Global funds
 poured  $26 billion into Indian equities since the end of 2011,
exchange data show. Rupee gains will be curbed by a decline in
the nation’s export earnings, according to  IDBI Bank Ltd. (IDBI)   “The rupee is so far just being supported by capital
inflows,” said N.S. Venkatesh, Mumbai-based head of treasury at
the state-run bank. “Falling exports are retaining pressure on
the currency.”  The rupee advanced 0.5 percent to 54.50 per dollar in
Mumbai, the biggest gain since Jan. 2, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility in the
rupee, a gauge of expected moves in exchange rates used to price
options, was unchanged at 9.95 percent.  India’s overseas  shipments  fell 1.9 percent in December
from a year earlier, Director General of Foreign Trade Anup
Pujari said on Jan. 11, the eighth straight month of decreases.
The shortfall in India’s  current account , the broadest measure
of trade, widened to a record $22 billion in the quarter through
September, official data show.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 55.43 per
dollar, compared with 55.71 on Jan. 11, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 55.26 versus 55.69. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
