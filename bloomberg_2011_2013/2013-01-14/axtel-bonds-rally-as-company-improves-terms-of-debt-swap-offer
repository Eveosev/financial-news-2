Axtel SAB bonds rose, pushing yields
to the lowest in two months, after  Mexico ’s second-largest land-
line phone carrier improved the terms of a debt exchange offer.  The securities maturing in 2019 gained 7.07 cents to 61.07
cents on the dollar at 12:53 p.m. in Mexico City. The yields
dropped 2.95 percentage points to 19.72 percent, the lowest on a
closing basis since Oct. 25, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Axtel’s  shares  rose 3.3 percent to 3.18 pesos.  The Mexican phone company, which is struggling to compete
with  Carlos Slim ’s America Movil SAB, boosted the value of an
offer announced Dec. 26 to exchange dollar senior unsecured debt
due in 2017 and 2019 for a combination of senior secured
securities, peso-denominated convertible bonds and cash. Axtel
extended the deadline to Jan. 18.  The improved terms of the debt swap came after a group of
bondholders controlling at least 40 percent of Axtel’s dollar
notes rejected the offer in a Jan. 9 letter obtained by
Bloomberg News. BCP Securities LLC valued the new proposal at 62
cents on the dollar, compared with 54 cents previously.  The company is in the process of selling tower assets to
 American Tower Corp. (AMT)  for $250 million in a transaction that
depends on the debt exchange’s acceptance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
