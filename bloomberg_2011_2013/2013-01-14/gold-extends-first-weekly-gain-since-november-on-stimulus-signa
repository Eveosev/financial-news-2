Gold advanced after Federal  Reserve
Bank  of Chicago President  Charles Evans  said the U.S. central
bank should keep policy accommodative to support the economy
while lawmakers reduce  government spending .  Gold for immediate delivery climbed as much as 0.3 percent
to $1,667.93 an ounce and traded at $1,664.03 at 11:20 a.m. in
Singapore. Prices advanced 0.4 percent last week, the first
weekly gain since Nov. 23. Bullion for February delivery rose
0.2 percent to $1,664.20 on the Comex in  New York .  The dollar weakened as much as 0.5 percent to $1.3404
versus the euro, the lowest level in more than 10 months, after
the comments from Evans. Bullion climbed for a 12th straight
year in 2012 as central banks from Europe to the U.S. and China
boosted stimulus to counter slowing growth. Japanese Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe will select a central bank chief who will
expand monetary easing, he said yesterday.  “We can’t see any joy for the  U.S. dollar ,” said  David
Lennox , an analyst at Fat Prophets in Sydney. “That should be
supportive of gold.”  Gold slid to a four-month low on Jan. 4 after Federal
Reserve minutes indicated policy makers may end $85 billion in
monthly bond purchases sometime this year. Bullion rose 70
percent as the Fed bought $2.3 trillion of debt in two rounds of
easing from December 2008 through June 2011. Gold will climb as
much as 14 percent this year and average $1,753, a London
Bullion Market Association poll of traders and analysts showed.  Holdings in exchange-traded products backed by gold stood
at 2,619.91 metric tons on Jan. 11, data tracked by Bloomberg
show. Holdings fell for a second week last week, the data show.  Silver for immediate delivery climbed as much as 0.8
percent to $30.6925 an ounce and traded at $30.6475. Spot
platinum rose 0.2 percent to $1,635.25 an ounce, while palladium
gained 0.4 percent to $703.75 an ounce.  To contact the reporter for this story:
