ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA)  Supervisory Board
Chairman Gerhard Cromme should resign amid an investigation into
company-funded foreign travel, a lobby group said.  Cromme, who’s also chairman of  Siemens AG (SIE) , should consider
resigning because the post of chairman has been undermined, the
Vereinigung der Aufsichtsraete in Deutschland e.V., or VARD,
said in a letter addressed to the 69-year-old.  The letter comes amid a reorganization of ThyssenKrupp’s
top management. Bertin Eichler, deputy chairman of
ThyssenKrupp’s supervisory board, will leave this year as
compliance staff at  Germany ’s largest steelmaker investigate him
over five trips that had a partly “touristic character,”
Handelsblatt reported last week.  ThyssenKrupp last year ousted three top executives in an
effort to repair a boardroom tainted by corruption allegations
and an ill-fated expansion in the Americas. The Essen-based
company, which is cutting business units to five from eight and
building its non-steel base, scrapped its dividend for the first
time in December after posting a second straight annual loss.  VARD, whose members include Air Berlin Plc Chairman Hans- Joachim Koerber and former RWE AG Chief Executive Officer
Dietmar Kuhnt, seeks to improve the work of board chairmen by
setting common rules.  ThyssenKrupp declined to comment on the letter, which is
dated Jan. 11 and was obtained by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
