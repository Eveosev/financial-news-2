Germany and China agreed to work
together for the expansion of renewable energy sources such as
solar and wind.  German Environment Minister  Peter Altmaier  and Liu Qi,
deputy director of China’s National Energy Administration,
signed an agreement today in Abu Dhabi, Altmaier’s ministry said
in an e-mailed statement. Both countries seek to work together
on  energy policy , implementation of energy systems, and showcase
projects such as renewable-energy cities in China, it said.  China, the world’s largest carbon emitter due to its
dependence on coal, plans to add 49 gigawatts of renewable-
energy capacity this year in an effort to boost power production
without increasing its reliance on fossil fuels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
