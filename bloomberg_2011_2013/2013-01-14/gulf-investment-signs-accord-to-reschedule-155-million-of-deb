Gulf Investment House (GIH) , a Kuwait-
based financial services company, agreed to reschedule payments
on 43.5 million dinars ($155 million) of debt after the
financial crisis crimped its ability to tap the market.  The five-year deal with  Kuwait Finance House (KFIN)  requires Gulf
Investment to pay equal installments every six months until
October 2017, when a final payment of 21.75 million dinars is
scheduled, Gulf Investment said in a statement today. The first
payment of 2 million dinars was made this month, it said.  Kuwaiti companies, including  Global Investment House KSCC (GLOBAL) ,
are restructuring debt after the value of their assets collapsed
and frozen debt markets prevented them from raising new loans.
Aref Investment Group said in 2011 it planned to sell some of
its assets to restructure 280 million dinars of loans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
