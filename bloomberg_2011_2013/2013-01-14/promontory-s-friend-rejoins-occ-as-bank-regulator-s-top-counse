Amy Friend, a former Senate Banking
Committee lawyer who helped craft the Dodd-Frank Act, is
rejoining the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency as the
agency’s top counsel, the agency said today.  Friend, who joined Promontory Financial Group LLC in
January 2011, will fill a vacancy at the OCC left by longtime
chief counsel Julie Williams, who was hired by Washington-based
Promontory after leaving the national-bank regulator last year.  “I’m very pleased that Amy has agreed to rejoin the OCC in
this new capacity,” Comptroller of the Currency Thomas J. Curry
said in a statement. “She has been involved in financial
services regulation and legislation for more than 20 years, and
she has an unparalleled knowledge of the Dodd-Frank Act, which
we are still in the process of implementing.  Friend, who starts work at the OCC next month, was
assistant chief counsel at the agency before she was hired by
then-Senator  Chris Dodd  in 2008 to be the Senate Banking
Committee’s top lawyer. She has also worked for other Democratic
lawmakers, including Senator Chuck Schumer of  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
