Aldar Properties PJSC (ALDAR)  and  Sorouh
Real Estate Co. (SOROUH)  surged to a two-year high on bets Abu Dhabi’s
biggest property developers are poised to benefit from about $90
billion in infrastructure spending over the next five years.  Aldar, which is discussing a potential merger with Sorouh,
soared 4.5 percent to 1.62 dirhams, the highest level since
April 2011 at the close in Abu Dhabi. Sorouh jumped 3.2 percent
to 1.6 dirhams, the highest since January 2011. The stocks were
the  second and third most traded  by value on the benchmark  ADX
General Index. (ADSMI)  They helped the gauge rise 0.9 percent to
2,766.29, surpassing the threshold some investors consider as
the beginning of a bull market after it advanced 20 percent
since last year’s low.  The United Arab Emirates’ capital, which is transforming
itself into a business and cultural hub, plans to spend about
330 billion dirhams on projects including housing and roads
through 2017, the Abu Dhabi Executive Council said yesterday.
The announcement comes about a year after the oil-rich emirate
said it will resume suspended real estate projects including
branches of the Louvre and Guggenheim museums after the credit
crisis slowed lending and caused property prices to crash.  The move is “expected to stimulate economic growth and
will benefit developer companies in the emirate among other
sectors,” Nabil Farhat, a partner at Abu Dhabi-based Al Fajer
Securities, said by e-mail.  The Abu Dhabi government forecasts economic growth to
accelerate to 5.7 percent a year through 2016 from an estimated
3.9 percent in 2012 as it invests in metals, chemicals and the
arts. Abu Dhabi sits on the majority of proven oil reserves in
the U.A.E.  Profits Surge  Aldar and Sorouh surged 15 percent last week as the
companies said discussions about a potential merger are in
advanced stages. Shares of Sorouh rallied 47 percent in 2012 and
Aldar’s surged 38 percent, outpacing the Abu Dhabi gauge’s 9.5
percent gain, as investors anticipated news on the merger.  Aldar’s  2012 profit  probably doubled to 1.31 billion
dirhams ($357 million), according to the average estimate of six
analysts compiled by Bloomberg. Sorouh may post a  70 percent
advance  in net income for the year, the median estimate of four
analysts shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
