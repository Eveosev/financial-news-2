Kenya’s shilling headed for its
lowest level in a year, extending last week’s decline after the
 central bank  slashed  interest rates  more than expected.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy depreciated
0.1 percent to 86.80 a dollar as of 3:53 p.m. in Nairobi, the
capital, poised for the weakest since January 2012.  The shilling rallied as much as 0.2 percent earlier as the
central bank sold dollars to support it. The bank sold an
unspecified amount of dollars in the foreign-exchange market
today, an official who asked not to be identified in line with
policy, said by phone.  “The central bank is keen to keep the shilling within the
86.50 to 86.70 range and they have intervened by selling dollars
in the market,” Duncan Kinuthia, the head of trading at
Commercial Bank of Africa Ltd., said by phone from Nairobi.  The Monetary Policy Committee, led by central bank Governor
Njuguna Ndung’u, reduced the rate for the fourth time since
July, cutting it to 9.5 percent from 11 percent, the Nairobi-
based Central Bank of  Kenya  said on Jan 9. Seven out of 10
economists and analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had forecast a 1
percentage-point reduction.  Kenya’s foreign-exchange reserves decreased to $5.282
billion in the week ended Jan. 10, compared with $5.369 billion
a week earlier, the central bank said in a weekly bulletin
posted on its website.  Rate Cut  “The local unit could weaken in coming sessions if
commercial banks respond to the lower base rates with rate cuts
of their own,” Nairobi-based  NIC Bank Ltd. (NICB)  said in a note.  The shilling is expected to depreciate “modestly” to the
88 a dollar level by year end and to 90 by 2014, Morgan Stanley
said in a research note released today.  The central bank took 900 million shillings ($10 million)
of seven-day  repurchase agreements  out of bids of 4.9 billion
shillings, having offered 4 billion shillings at the sale. The
repos are used by the regulator to withdraw  money supply  from
banks and support the shilling.  The Ugandan shilling weakened 0.3 percent to 2,693.85 a
dollar, while Tanzania’s shilling weakened 0.9 percent to
1,603.00 a dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
