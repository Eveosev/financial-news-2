An index of U.K. business confidence
and a gauge of output both fell in December, suggesting the
economy may contract in the coming months, according to BDO LLP.  The sentiment gauge fell to 90.3 in December from 91.4 the
previous month, the accountancy firm said in a report today in
 London . A measure of output decreased to 93.1 from a reading of
93.4, below the 95 mark that points to positive growth one
quarter ahead. The decline suggests “the U.K. may experience
further contraction in the first quarter of 2013, potentially
resulting in a triple-dip recession,” BDO said.  Britain’s recovery is struggling to take hold after the
economy emerged from a recession in the third quarter. The
turmoil in the euro area is adding to pressures at home, as the
government’s fiscal squeeze curtails domestic spending. The  Bank
of England  last week kept its emergency bond-buying plan on hold
as it assesses the effect of a credit-boosting plan introduced
in the summer.  “Many U.K. businesses are in a state of limbo,” Peter
Hemington, partner at BDO, said in an e-mailed statement.
“Ongoing volatility in the U.S. and  euro zone , coupled with
sluggish U.K. GDP growth, is leaving them reluctant to hire and
make plans for growth.”  An index of employment intentions fell to 93 from 93.1, the
report showed. The BDO indexes are calculated by the Centre for
Economics and Business Research from a weighted average of all
the U.K.’s main business surveys in the last month.  -- Editors: Rob Verdonck,  Chad Thomas   To contact the reporter on this story:
