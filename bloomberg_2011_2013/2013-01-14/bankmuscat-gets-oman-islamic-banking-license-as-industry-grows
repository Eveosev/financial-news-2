BankMuscat SAOG (BKMB) , Oman’s biggest bank
by assets, received a license to offer services complying with
Shariah as it seeks to benefit from the industry’s growth
prospects.  The bank will open seven so-called Islamic windows this
year operating under the brand “Meethaq Islamic Banking,”
according to a regulatory filing today.  The move comes after the Persian Gulf country approved
licenses for two Islamic banks last year. Islamic banking assets
in Oman may account for a 10th of the total within a year of the
lenders starting services, Hilal Al Barwani, vice president of
banking supervision at the central bank, said in October.
 National Bank of Oman SAOG  said in June its shareholders
approved starting Islamic banking.  Global Islamic financial assets may double to $3 trillion
by 2015, according to  Standard & Poor’s . BankMuscat shares have
gained 6.1 percent this year. The shares dropped 11 percent in
2012.  A study released in 2011 by the U.K.-based  Islamic Finance 
Advisory & Assurance Services found that of the 86 percent of
Omanis who bank with non-Islamic lenders, 60 percent are
“bothered” by using products based on interest. Islamic law
bans the payment and receipt of interest as well as investments
in businesses such as those involving tobacco, alcohol, pork and
gambling.  To contact the reporter on this story:
