Tahoe Resources Inc. (THO) , the company
developing the Escobal silver mine in Guatemala, said two
security guards were killed in an ambush at the mine on Jan. 12.  Other Escobal security workers repelled the attackers, the
Reno, Nevada-based company said in a statement today. The
assault was one of three against mining entities in Guatemala
this week, Tahoe said.  “In the last year, numerous businesses have been subjected
to intimidation and violence from criminal elements intent on
stopping development,” Tahoe said in the statement. “The
Company thoroughly rejects the notion that these unprovoked
violent acts are justified.”  Goldcorp Inc. (G) , the world’s second-largest gold company, is
Tahoe’s  largest shareholder  with a 40 percent stake, according
to a Dec. 23, 2010 filing.  Tahoe plans to produce 20 million ounces of silver a year
from the mine, which is 70 kilometers (43.5 miles) southeast of
 Guatemala City , the company said. Tahoe remains on schedule to
commission Escobal’s mill in the second half of this year and
begin commercial production in early 2014.  Tahoe didn’t receive the final permit required for
exploitation of the Escobal project as expected in 2012, the
company said. “The Guatemalan President and the Minister of
Energy and Mines have reassured us that the license is
forthcoming,” Ron Clayton, Tahoe’s chief operating officer,
said in the statement.  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX)  is the world’s largest gold producer by
market value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
