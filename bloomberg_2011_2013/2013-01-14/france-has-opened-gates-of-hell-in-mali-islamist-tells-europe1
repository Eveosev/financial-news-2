France ’s government has opened the
“gates of hell” with its intervention in  Mali , an Islamist
militant leader told a French radio station.  France “has fallen into a trap much more dangerous than
Iraq, Afghanistan and Somalia,” Oumar Hamaha, known as “Red
Beard” for his hennaed facial hair, told  Europe1  today. “And
it’s only started.”  French air and ground forces have been carrying out attacks
since Jan. 11 to beat back militants in the north of Mali who
went on the offensive last week. Hamaha is the militants’
spokesman.  “The Mirages that bombed Gao were 13,000 meters up,” he
said. “Come down to earth if you are men. We’ll receive them
with open arms.”  France’s interior minister said yesterday that security
forces are increasing patrols at airports and train stations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
