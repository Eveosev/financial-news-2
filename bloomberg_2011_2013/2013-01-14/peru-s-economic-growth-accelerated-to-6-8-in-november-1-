(Corrects  unemployment rate  in eighth paragraph.)  Peru ’s economic growth unexpectedly
quickened in November, led by construction, fueling expectations
the central bank will keep its key  interest rate  on hold as
inflation remains subdued.  Economic activity  climbed 6.8 percent from the same month a
year earlier, the government’s statistics agency said today at a
news conference in  Lima . The median estimate of 12 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg was for growth of 6.4 percent.  Peru’s $200 billion economy is leading growth in  South
America  as a mining-led investment boom spurs construction
activity. A recovery in Chinese demand for Peru’s metal exports
this year will compensate for weaker investment as social
conflicts delay mine projects, enabling the central bank to keep
its benchmark rate at 4.25 percent for all of 2013, said  Roberto Flores , the head of research at Inteligo SAB.  “Growth will be very similar to last year but we’ll see a
re-balancing in the drivers,” Flores said in a phone interview
in Lima. “Although we’ve seen an improvement in business
sentiment, the issue of social conflicts hasn’t gone away.”  Community protests, permit delays and cost increases in the
third largest copper producing nation will damp mining
investment in 2013 and 2014, the central bank said in a Dec. 14
report.  Subdued Inflation  The monetary authority kept borrowing costs unchanged for a
20th consecutive month on Jan. 10, the longest pause since it
began targeting inflation in 2002, citing stable economic growth
and slowing inflation. Consumer prices rose 2.65 percent in
December from the year earlier, the slowest pace since February
2011.  Construction activity expanded 16.8 percent in November
from the year earlier, while retail activity rose 6.3 percent
and manufacturing climbed 4.8 percent, the statistics agency
said. The economy expanded 1.3 percent from October on a
seasonally adjusted basis.  Lima’s  unemployment rate  fell to 5.6 percent in December,
the lowest since at least 2001, while average monthly incomes
rose 4 percent to 1,326 soles ($523), the agency said in a
separate report. The unemployment rate was 5.9 percent in
November and 7 percent a year earlier.  The sol appreciated 0.3 percent to 2.5360 per  U.S. dollar 
at 11:39 a.m. in Lima, according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
