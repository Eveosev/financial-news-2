Apollo Global Management LLC (APO)  will
remain a passive investor in  HMV Group Plc (HMV)  after acquiring a
stake in the U.K. retailer’s bank debt, according to two people
familiar with the matter.  The asset-management firm has no plans to make an offer for
the seller of CDs and DVDs, according to the people, who
declined to be identified because the matter is private. The
Sunday Times reported on Jan. 6 that New York-based Apollo was
considering a takeover of HMV, which last month said it will
probably breach debt covenants in 2013 amid continued losses.  Apollo acquired the stake of about 6 percent in HMV’s bank
debt about two weeks ago, the people said. Neither HMV nor
Apollo would comment on the price paid.  The holding is too small to influence any planned
restructuring of the business, they said.  Lloyds Banking Group
Plc (LLOY)  and  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  are the lead banks and
will lead any restructuring discussions, the people said.  A spokesman for HMV declined to comment.  HMV shares  have
fallen 41 percent this year, adding to last year’s 44 percent
slump and reducing the company’s market value to 4.9 million
pounds ($7.9 million). The retailer last month reported a first-
half net loss of 36.2 million pounds and on Jan. 12 started
selling CDs, DVDs, box sets and games at a 25 percent discount.
Its  net debt  was 176.1 million pounds as of Oct. 27.  Apollo is the smallest stakeholder in the bank debt and has
no plans to make additional purchases, the people said.  The asset-management firm in December agreed to buy U.K.
luxury jewelry retailer Aurum Holdings, which includes Watches
of  Switzerland , Mappin & Webb and the Goldsmiths brands.
