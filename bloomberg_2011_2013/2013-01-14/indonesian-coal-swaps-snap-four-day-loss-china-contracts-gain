Swaps prices for thermal coal from
 Indonesia , the world’s largest exporter of the fuel, rose for
the first time in five days, according to Ginga Petroleum
Singapore Pte.  The swap for Indonesian sub-bituminous coal with a
calorific value of 4,900 kilocalories a kilogram in the second
quarter gained 10 cents to $64.60 a metric ton on a net-as-
received basis on Jan. 11, Ginga said in an e-mail today. The
February contract climbed 10 cents to $63.70 a ton.  Indonesia raised its January coal benchmark price to $87.55
a ton today, up from $81.75 in December, the directorate general
of coal and minerals at the energy and mineral resources
ministry said in a statement on its website.  Contracts for coal with a heating value of 5,500
kilocalories a kilogram for shipment to South  China  in the
second quarter advanced 50 cents to $86.80 a ton on a net-as-
received basis, the energy broker said. The February contract
gained 20 cents to $85.70 a ton.  Lower-priced domestic supplies will displace Chinese coal
imports this year, Sanford C. Bernstein said in a report e-
mailed today. The benchmark Qinhuangdao coal price will average
650  yuan  ($104.60) a ton in 2013 and 2014, down 7 percent from
2012, according to the report.  Qinhuangdao coal was unchanged at 620 yuan to 630 yuan a
ton as of yesterday compared with a week earlier, according to
data today from the China Coal Transport and Distribution
Association. Stockpiles rose to 6.82 million tons.  A commodity swap is a financial agreement whereby a
floating price is exchanged for a fixed rate over a specified
contract period. About 60 percent of Indonesia’s coal is
classified as sub-bituminous. Higher moisture levels and a lower
carbon content reduce the heating value compared with better-
quality stock. Sub-bit coal has fewer than 6,100 kilocalories
per kilogram, according to the Indonesian energy ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
