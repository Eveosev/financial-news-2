The U.K. government started a 125
million-pound ($201 million) cash-rebate program to encourage
uptake of its Green Deal energy efficiency initiative designed
to fund upgrades of insulation and heating in homes.  Cashback payments of more than 1,000 pounds could be
available for the first households to book Green Deal measures
such as loft insulation and new heating systems, the Department
of Energy and Climate Change said in a  statement .  The Green Deal, which starts Jan. 28, is at the heart of
government plans to reduce energy demand, helping consumers cope
with rising bills while curbing emissions. Users of the Green
Deal program pay for measures through their electricity bills,
with repayments not supposed to exceed energy savings resulting
from the upgrades. Companies including EON SE,  Centrica Plc (CNA) ’s
British Gas unit and SSE Plc are among the appointed providers
of efficiency packages.  “The Green Deal will be a great offer for people to
insulate their homes from the cold, and their wallets from
rising energy prices,” Energy and Climate Change Secretary  Ed
Davey  said in the statement.  “Our cashback scheme is a
generous offer but it’s first-come, first-served so householders
need to be quick off the mark,” he said.  Payments include 650 pounds for households installing solid
wall insulation, 390 pounds for flat roof insulation and 150
pounds for replacing storage heaters. These rates last until the
first 40 million pounds of the rebate is used after which
they’re likely to reduce, according to today’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
