The BP Plc-led Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan
pipeline shipped less Azeri crude oil last year as the Caspian
nation cut production.  The so-called BTC link carried 29.7 million metric tons of
oil (about 217 million barrels) last year, a decline of 7.9
percent from 2011, according to data published today on the
website of State Oil Co. of  Azerbaijan , or Socar, a partner in
the pipeline project.  Azerbaijan, the largest oil producer in the former  Soviet
Union  after Russia and Kazakhstan, saw production fall 3.7
percent last year to 43.9 million tons, Socar President Rovnaq Abdullayev said on Dec. 30. Natural gas output rose 8.3 percent
to 27.9 billion cubic meters, he said.  As of Jan. 1, the 1,768 kilometer (1,099 mile) BTC link
connecting Azerbaijan’s Caspian Sea coast with Turkey’s
Mediterranean port of Ceyhan via  Georgia  has carried 205.45
million tons of oil since 2005, Socar said.  BTC also carried 228,188 tons of Turkmen oil in December,
up from 204,758 tons a year earlier, according to the Socar
data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
