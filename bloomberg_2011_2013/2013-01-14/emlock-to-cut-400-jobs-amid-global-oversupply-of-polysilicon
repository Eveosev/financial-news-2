Hemlock Semiconductor Corp., the
largest U.S. provider of polysilicon, plans to lay off about 400
people in Michigan and  Tennessee  amid a global glut of the main
raw ingredient in solar cells.  The layoffs will take place in the next few weeks and may
become permanent if poor market conditions persist, the Hemlock,
Michigan-based company said today in an e-mailed statement.  “The unresolved trade disputes among the U.S.,  China  and
Europe are a major factor,” Hemlock President Andrew Tometich
said in the statement. “The threat of tariffs on U.S.
polysilicon imported into China has significantly decreased
orders from China, which is home to one of the largest markets
for our products.”  The  price  of polysilicon has declined 77 percent during the
last two years as Chinese companies flooded the market with
panels and drove down demand, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Hemlock is jointly owned by Dow Corning, Shin-Etsu Handotai
Co. and  Mitsubishi Materials Corp. (5711)   To contact the reporter on this story:
