PT Garuda Indonesia (GIAA) ’s low-cost unit
Citilink ordered 25 Airbus SAS A320neo aircraft, worth $2.4
billion at list prices, as the carrier expands its fleet amid
rising travel demand in Asia’s third-most populous nation.  The contract, signed in December, is the first direct
purchase by Citilink from Airbus, the planemaker said in a
statement today. The 2012 average list price of an A320neo is
$96.7 million, according to Airbus website. Carriers usually get
discounts from catalog prices.  Rival PT Lion Mentari Airlines, which ordered 230 Boeing
Co. planes last year, is also considering the purchase of
additional aircraft as air travel in the region is expected to
grow more than 6.4 percent annually through 2031. Airbus has
generally lagged behind Boeing in  Indonesia  where economic
growth is spurring air travel demand.  Shares of Garuda were  unchanged  at 640 rupiah at close of
trading in Jakarta. The Jakarta Composite index advanced 1.8
percent. The stock gained 39 percent last year.  Garuda ordered 25 A320 aircraft from Toulouse, France-based
Airbus in 2011 to support Citilink’s growth. The contract
included 10 orders for the A320neo, a revamped version of
Airbus’s single-aisle plane.  Airbus is also looking to sell A380 superjumbos to Garuda.
The airline said Nov. 21 it had received proposals from Airbus
as well as from Boeing for its 747-8 Intercontinental. President
Director Emirsyah Satar had said the review of proposals was
still at an early stage.  Citilink has 14 A320s and seven Boeing 737s in its fleet,
according to the carrier’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
