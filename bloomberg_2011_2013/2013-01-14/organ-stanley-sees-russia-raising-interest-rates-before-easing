Russia will increase  interest rates 
in the first six months of 2013 before easing monetary policy in
the second half as inflation slows to the central bank’s 5
percent to 6 percent target range, according to Morgan Stanley.  As  core inflation , which excludes volatile costs such as
energy, is set to exceed 6 percent in the first half, the
central bank will raise borrowing costs by a quarter-point to
“keep inflation expectations in check and maintain the
credibility of its transition to inflation targeting,” Jacob Nell and Alina Slyusarchuk, economists at Morgan Stanley, said
today in an e-mailed research note.  Bank Rossii Chairman Sergey Ignatiev, whose third and final
term ends this year, failed to hold inflation below the 6
percent upper limit of the regulator’s target band last year,
with price growth accelerating to 6.6 percent in December, up
from 6.1 percent a year earlier.  Policy makers will cut rates “at least once” in the
second half of the year, Nell and Slyusarchuk said, adding that
the pace and timing of the moves will depend on the impact of
July’s increases in utility tariffs and the grain harvest this
year. The central bank will also expand the range in which it
allows the ruble to trade against its target dollar-euro basket
to 9 rubles from 7 rubles and reduce its levels of currency
interventions, according to Morgan Stanley.  To contact the reporter on this story:
