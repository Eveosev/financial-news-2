Sugar fell in New York as  Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  cut the sweetener’s price forecast for the next
three, six and 12 months on ample global supply. Cocoa rose.  Raw sugar traded on ICE Futures U.S. in New York will be at
18.50 cents a pound in three and six months, down from a
previous estimate of 22 cents, Damien Courvalin, an analyst at
the bank in the city, said in a report dated yesterday. Sugar,
which slid 16 percent last year, will be at 19 cents a pound in
12 months, according to the bank’s forecast.  “Going forward, we expect the global sugar market to
remain in a surplus for the third consecutive year in 2013-14,”
said Courvalin. “We expect a further build in global
inventories.”  Raw sugar for March delivery retreated 0.6 percent to 19.06
cents a pound by 6:04 a.m. in  New York . The price gained as much
as 1.2 percent in the previous trading session on Jan. 11.
White, or refined, sugar for March delivery slid 0.4 percent to
$512.90 a metric ton on NYSE Liffe in London.  Sugarcane in Brazil’s center south, the main growing region
of the world’s biggest producer, will keep expanding as farmers
continue to plant and because of “favorable” weather,
according to Goldman Sachs. The crop will climb to as much as
590 million metric tons in 2013-14 from 535.7 million tons in
2012-13, Datagro Ltd. forecasts.  “This larger harvest will most likely allow for both an
increase in sugar and ethanol production,” Courvalin said. Both
ethanol and sugar are made from sugar cane in  Brazil .  Cocoa for March delivery gained 0.2 percent to $2,260 a ton
on ICE. Cocoa for March delivery was up 0.4 percent to 1,444
pounds ($2,326) a ton on NYSE Liffe.  Cocoa Consumption  Global cocoa consumption will exceed output by about
100,000 tons in the season that started in October after two
years of oversupply, according to Goldman Sachs. Output was
90,000 tons higher than demand in the 2011-12 season after a
record surplus of 341,000 tons a year earlier, according to the
International Cocoa Organization in London.  Arabica coffee for March delivery rose 0.7 percent to
$1.5435 a pound in New York. Robusta for March delivery advanced
0.9 percent to $1,962 a ton in  London .  “We see limited further downside to prices and expect
coffee prices to remain rangebound near-term before recovering
modestly in 2013,” Courvalin said, commenting on arabica beans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
