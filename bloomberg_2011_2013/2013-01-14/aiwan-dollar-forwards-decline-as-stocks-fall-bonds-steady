Taiwan’s dollar retreated from a 17-
month high, reversing an earlier advance, as overseas investors
pulled money from local stocks and on speculation the central
bank intervened to limit gains.  Government bonds  were steady.  The currency declined 0.4 percent in the last two minutes
of trading. The central bank has sold its own dollar to damp its
appreciation on most days in the past nine months, according to
traders who asked not to be identified. Global funds sold NT$1.6
billion ($54 million) more local stocks than they bought today
after an official report on Jan. 11 showed Chinese consumer
prices rose by the most in seven months in December, prompting
speculation monetary policy may be tightened.  “The market is concerned about  China , though we need to
see the trend over a few months” of whether the price pressures
will continue, said George Pu a bond trader at Sinopac
Securities Corp. in Taipei. The  currency market  also faces
intervention risk, he said.  The local dollar closed down 0.1 percent at NT$29.058
against its U.S. counterpart, according to prices from Taipei
Forex Inc. It rose as much as 0.4 percent to NT$28.928 earlier,
the strongest level since September 2011. One-month non-
deliverable forwards fell 0.1 percent to NT$28.898, a 0.6
percent premium to the spot rate, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  One-month implied volatility in the  Taiwan dollar , a gauge
of expected moves in exchange rates used to price options,
dropped 11 basis points, or 0.11 percentage point, to 3.27
percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The central bank’s mandate is to keep relative exchange-
rate stability and to intervene in the market in the event of
abnormal moves, Governor Perng Fai-Nan said Dec. 19.  The yield on the 1.125 percent bonds due September 2022 was
1.171 percent, the same as Jan. 13, according to Gretai
Securities Market. The  overnight interbank lending  rate was
little changed at 0.386 percent, a weighted average compiled by
the Taiwan Interbank Money Center shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
