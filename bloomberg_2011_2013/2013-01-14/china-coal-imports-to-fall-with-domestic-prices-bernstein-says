China  will cut coal imports this
year as the cost of domestic supplies declines, Sanford C.
Bernstein & Co. said in a report.  Net  purchases  from overseas will drop 47 percent to 150
million metric tons this year from 281 million in 2012,
Bernstein said in the e-mailed note today. Average domestic
 benchmark prices  will fall 7 percent, it said.  China, the world’s largest consumer and producer of coal,
is undergoing a structural slowdown in power-consumption growth
just as the capacity for production and transport of coal
increases, according to Bernstein. Domestic prices will slide
through 2015, while still being susceptible to “seasonal
bumps,” Bernstein said.  “We believe that Chinese coal imports are likely to fall
in absolute terms in 2013 as lower-priced domestic supply pushes
out imports,”  Michael Parker , a Hong Kong-based analyst at
Bernstein, said in the report. “Over that entire time, we
expect coal prices to trend downward. There is plenty of supply
available both domestically and from the seaborne market if coal
prices creep back up.”  The average price of coal with an energy value of 5,500
kilocalories per kilogram at the Chinese port of Qinhuangdao
will slip to 650  yuan  ($105) a ton this year and in 2014,
compared with 699 yuan in 2012, Parker predicted.  The fuel traded in a range of 620 yuan to 630 yuan a ton as
of yesterday, according to data today from the China Coal
Transport and Distribution Association.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
