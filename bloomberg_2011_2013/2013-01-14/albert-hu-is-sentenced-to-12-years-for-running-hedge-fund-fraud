     Jan. 14 (Bloomberg) --- Albert K. Hu, who was convicted of
running a California hedge fund fraud scheme that the government

to 12 years in prison.  U.S. District Judge Ronald M. Whyte imposed the sentence
today in San Jose, California. Hu, 50, formerly of Fremont,
California, and Hong Kong, was found guilty by a jury in June of
seven counts of wire fraud.  To contact the reporter on this story:
