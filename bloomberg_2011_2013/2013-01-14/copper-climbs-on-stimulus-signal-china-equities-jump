Copper rose in London, rebounding
from last week’s drop, after U.S. and Japanese officials
indicated central banks in the countries might take more steps
to spur economic growth.  The  Federal Reserve  should keep policy accommodative to
support the economy in the U.S., said  Charles Evans , president
of the Fed Bank of Chicago. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe
said he wants a “bold policy leader” as the next governor of
the  Bank of Japan . The dollar weakened to a 10-month low against
the euro.  “We are higher primarily due to the fact that EUR/USD has
broken resistance,” Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at
Saxo Bank A/S in Copenhagen, said by e-mail. “The news from
 Japan  has indirectly helped this move along.”  Copper for delivery in three months gained 0.7 percent to
$8,100 a metric ton by 9:58 a.m. on the London Metal Exchange.
Prices slid 0.5 percent last week. Copper for delivery in March
rose 0.8 percent to $3.685 a pound on the Comex in  New York .  A weaker dollar makes raw materials more attractive as an
alternative investment. The U.S. is the world’s second-biggest
copper consumer after  China  and Japan ranks fourth. BOJ policy
makers are scheduled to meet next week.  Prices also gained after money managers increased their
net-long positions, or wagers on rising copper prices, to 20,165
Comex futures and options contracts as of Jan. 8 from 15,924 a
week earlier, according to figures from the U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission.  Stockpiles of copper monitored by the LME dropped 0.2
percent to 329,725 tons, daily exchange figures showed. Orders
to withdraw the metal from warehouses, or canceled warrants,
declined for a fifth session in six to 62,975 tons.  Nickel for delivery in three months on the LME was little
changed at $17,586 a ton. Canceled warrants  jumped  7.5 percent
to 18,576 tons, the highest level since at least October 1997.
Stockpiles of the metal used to make stainless steel climbed 2
percent to 147,060 tons, the highest since April 22, 2010.  Aluminum, zinc, lead and tin advanced in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
