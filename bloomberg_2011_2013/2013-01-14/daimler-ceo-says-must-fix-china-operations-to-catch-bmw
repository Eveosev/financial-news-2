  Daimler AG (DAI)  Chief Executive Officer
 Dieter Zetsche  said the Mercedes-Benz brand must turn around its
struggling Chinese operations to catch up with  Bayerische
Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  and  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Audi.  “We have to fix China,” Zetsche told reporters today at
the North American International Motor Show in Detroit. “And
that’s what we’re doing.”  Daimler is negotiating its role in a possible initial
public offering by Chinese partner Beijing Automotive Group Co.,
the CEO said, without giving details. There are no talks with
China’s sovereign-wealth fund to buy a stake in the automaker,
he said, denying a media report from last week.  Zetsche has vowed to retake the top spot Mercedes lost to
BMW in 2005 by the end of the decade at the latest. Audi, No. 2
in global luxury sales since 2011, is pursuing the same goal.
Mercedes fell further behind BMW and Audi in sales last year as
it grew more slowly in  China , the world’s biggest car market,
than its two main rivals.  Daimler, based in Stuttgart, Germany, has named Hubertus Troska to its board with responsibility for China and is
combining its separate sales organizations in the country for
imported and locally produced cars into one entity.  “We have to give the new people a chance,” said Zetsche.
“This is a good starting point.”  New products will give Daimler momentum this year, the CEO
said. Daimler presented a refreshed E-Class sedan in Detroit and
will introduce an overhauled version of the flagship S-Class
sedan later this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
