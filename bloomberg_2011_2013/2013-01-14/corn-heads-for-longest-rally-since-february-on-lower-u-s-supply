Crop prices rose in  Chicago , driving
corn toward the longest rally since February, as U.S. government
estimates showed shrinking stockpiles after the worst drought
since the 1930s seared fields across the Midwest.  Corn inventories on Dec. 1 were 8.03 billion bushels, 17
percent less than the year-earlier 9.647 billion, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said in a  report  on Jan. 11. Analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg expected 8.219 billion. Wheat reserves on
May 31, before the 2013 harvest, will be 716 million bushels,
down 5 percent from a December estimate and less than the 741
million expected by analysts.  “A sharp increase in demand and tightening grain
stockpiles mean the January USDA reports were supportive for
corn prices,”  Luke Mathews , a strategist at  Commonwealth Bank
of Australia (CBA) , wrote in a report today.  Corn for delivery in March climbed 2.1 percent to $7.235 a
bushel at 7:12 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade. The grain
reached $7.24, the highest level since Dec. 18, and advanced for
a sixth session, poised for the longest streak for a most-active
contract since Feb. 29.  Lower  quarterly  corn stockpiles mean supply before the 2013
harvest in the U.S., the world’s largest grower and exporter,
will further shrink to 602 million bushels, the lowest since
1996, USDA data released Jan. 11 showed. Analysts on average
expected 647 million bushels, according to a Bloomberg survey.  Wheat for delivery in March rose 2.3 percent to $7.7175 a
bushel. The grain touched $7.75, the highest price since Jan. 2.
In Paris, milling wheat for the same delivery month added 1.5
percent to 248.50 euros ($331.45) a metric ton on NYSE Liffe.  Soybeans for delivery in March climbed 1.5 percent to
$13.9425 a bushel in Chicago. The oilseed reached $13.96, the
highest price since Jan. 4.  U.S. soybean inventories on Dec. 1 totaled 1.966 billion
bushels, less than analysts expected and the lowest level for
the date since 2003, the USDA said. Still, the agency boosted
its forecasts for U.S. and Brazilian production, helping send
prices to a six-month low of $13.515 on Jan. 11.  To contact the reporters on this story:
