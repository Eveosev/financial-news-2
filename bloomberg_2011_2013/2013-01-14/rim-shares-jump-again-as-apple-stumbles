Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM) , the maker
of the BlackBerry smartphone, is trading at its highest level in
almost a year amid signs that demand for  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s market-
leading iPhone is ebbing.  RIM’s stock rose 10 percent to $14.95 at the close in New
York, climbing to the highest price since Feb. 17. The move
followed a 14 percent gain on Jan. 11, the previous trading day.  Apple reduced its orders for iPhone 5 screens this quarter,
Japan’s Nikkei newswire reported today, signaling that demand is
slowing. After years of losing market share, RIM is counting on
its new BlackBerry 10 lineup to win back customers from Apple
and Google Inc.’s Android. The Waterloo, Ontario-based company
plans to unveil the phones on Jan. 30, before they go on sale in
February and March.  RIM’s stock has more than doubled since late September,
fueled by optimism that the struggling company can build a
comeback around BlackBerry 10.  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)  reiterated
its support for the BlackBerry last week at the  Consumer
Electronics Show , ensuring that all of the largest U.S. carriers
will offer the new phones.  To contact the reporter on this story:
