The Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development said that its leading economic
indicator suggests that the global economy is stabilizing as the
U.S., U.K.,  China  and  India  return to growth.  The composite leading indicator for the U.S. climbed to 101
in November from 100.8 in October, the Paris-based OECD said
today in an e-mailed statement. The reading for the U.K. rose to
100.7 from 100.5, while China’s reading climbed to 99.7 from
99.5. The euro-area reading rose to 99.5 from 99.4.  “In the U.S. and U.K., the leading indicator continues to
point to economic growth firming” the OECD said today in a
monthly statement. “In China and India, signs of a turning
point are more marked than in last month’s assessment” and for
the reading of the euro area “as a whole point to a
stabilization in growth prospects,” according to the OECD.  To contact the reporter on this story:
