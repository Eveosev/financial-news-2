Libya  has begun to set up a force
under the direction of the  Interior Ministry  dedicated to
protecting diplomatic missions, in a bid to curb attacks such as
the one that left the U.S. ambassador dead.  Authorities have begun recruiting troops for the unit,
Libyan television reported late yesterday. The move follows an
attack on the Italian consul in Benghazi. Gunmen opened fire on
the diplomat’s vehicle Jan. 12. The official escaped unharmed.  An attack on the American consulate in the same city in
September led to the death of the U.S. ambassador and three
other Americans. The attack has been blamed on an Islamist
group.  Libya’s central government has been struggling to restore
order in the wake of Muammar Qaddafi’s ouster and killing in
2011. Libyan premier Ali Zaidan met with his Tunisian and
Algerian counterparts on Jan. 12, with the three agreeing to
cooperate on security issues in an effort to curb the flow of
weapons and infiltration by militants across their porous
borders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
