The zloty declined for a third day
after Economy Minister Janusz Piechocinski said a weaker
currency would be good for Polish exporters.  The zloty slid 0.2 percent to 4.1189 per euro as of 5:28
p.m. in Warsaw. The yield on 10-year notes fell 5 basis points
to 3.98 percent.  It would be “good” if the zloty depreciated further and
the level of 4.30 to 4.38 per euro would “guarantee real
profitability” for exporters, Piechocinski told the
Rzeczpospolita newspaper in an interview published today. His
comments come after  Hungary ’s Economy Minister  Gyorgy Matolcsy 
said last week he opposes a strong-forint policy to fight
inflation while the Czech central bank is considering steps to
weaken the koruna to boost the economy. The three central
European countries rely on the recession-stricken euro area for
most of their exports.  “The zloty and other regional currencies are now ripe for
a correction,” Timothy Ash, head of emerging-market research at
Standard Bank Group Ltd. in  London , said in an e-mailed comment
today. “We are now seeing active verbal intervention by policy
makers to talk currencies weaker.”  The zloty, the world’s best-performer last year, will
weaken to 4.25 per euro by the end of June, according to ING
Groep NV, which came the closest to predicting zloty-euro moves
in the past six quarters, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
