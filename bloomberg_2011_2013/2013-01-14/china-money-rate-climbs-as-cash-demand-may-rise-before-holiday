China ’s money-market rate climbed
for the first time in nine days on speculation cash demand will
increase before the Lunar New Year holiday that starts Feb. 11.  The People’s Bank of China asked banks today to submit
orders for seven- and 14-day reverse-repurchase agreements this
week, according to a trader required to bid at the auctions. The
central bank has kept the  yield  on seven-day contracts unchanged
at 3.35 percent at auctions since September.  “Liquidity may get tight from next week,” said Chen Lan,
a bond analyst at Guotai Junan Securities Co. in  Shanghai . “The
unchanged seven-day reverse-repo rate shows the central bank’s
target range for the rate is probably 3 percent to 3.5
percent.”  The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, rose 11 basis points, or 0.11 percentage
point, to 2.85 percent as of 10:25 a.m. in Shanghai, according
to a weighted average compiled by the National Interbank Funding
Center. China’s financial markets will be shut from Feb. 11
through 15 for the holiday.  The one-year interest-rate swap contract, the fixed cost
needed to receive the floating seven-day repo rate, climbed one
basis point to 3.37 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The yield on the 2.95 percent government bonds due
August 2017 was unchanged at 3.24 percent, according to the
Interbank Funding Center.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
