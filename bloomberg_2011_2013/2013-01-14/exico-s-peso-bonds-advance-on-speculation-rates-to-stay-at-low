(Corrects peso move in second paragraph.)  Mexico ’s peso bonds climbed
following last week’s rally amid speculation cooling inflation
will allow the central bank to keep borrowing costs at a record
low this year.  The benchmark local-currency bonds due in 2024 rose 0.30
centavo to 139.78 centavos per peso at 1 p.m. in Mexico City.
Yields fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to
5.45 percent after dropping five basis points last week.
Mexico’s peso gained 0.3 percent to 12.6313 per  U.S. dollar 
today.  The annual rate of consumer price increases slowed in
December to 3.57 percent, below the 4 percent upper end of the
central bank’s target for the first time since May, a Jan. 9
government report showed. The central bank will hold the target
lending rate at a record low 4.5 percent on Jan. 18, according
to all of the 17 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The policy statement will probably boost speculation that
the bank will stay on hold for the rest of the year, Javier Belaunzaran, who helps manage about $3 billion of debt at Grupo
Financiero Interacciones SA, said in a telephone interview from
Mexico City. The central bank’s statement is likely to be “a
bit dovish. Inflation came out better than expected.”  Citigroup Inc.’s Banamex unit said in a note to clients
that the central bank’s statement will have “significant
changes,” with policy makers possibly removing language about
reasons they would raise  interest rates .  To contact the reporter on this story:
