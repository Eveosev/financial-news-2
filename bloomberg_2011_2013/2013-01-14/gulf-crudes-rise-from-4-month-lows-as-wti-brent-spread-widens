Gulf Coast oils on the  spot market 
strengthened after reaching four-month lows last week as the
spread widened between U.S. and European benchmark crudes.  The discount of West Texas Intermediate to Brent widened as
much as 4.4 percent after narrowing to $17.08 a barrel on Jan.
11, the smallest gap since Aug. 28, after the Seaway pipeline
began flowing at expanded rates to Houston from Cushing,
 Oklahoma . When Brent gains versus WTI, it typically strengthens
the value of U.S. grades that compete with foreign oils priced
against the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet, the benchmark low-density, low-
sulfur crude on the U.S. Gulf Coast, strengthened 45 cents to a
$16.45-a-barrel premium to WTI in Cushing at 4:22 p.m.  New York 
time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana
Sweet also added 45 cents to its premium, to $16.55 a barrel.  The expanded Seaway line will be able to carry 400,000
barrels a day, easing a glut of crude in the U.S. Midwest and
offering a less-expensive alternative to LLS and light imports
from West Africa.  Mars Blend, a medium-gravity, high-sulfur crude from the
 Gulf of Mexico , strengthened 60 cents to a $12.60-a-barrel
premium to WTI. Poseidenâ€™s premium grew 30 cents to $12.60 a
barrel. Southern Green Canyon added 35 cents to its premium,
bringing it to $12.75a barrel. And  Thunder Horse  widened its
premium 65 cents to $15.40 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
