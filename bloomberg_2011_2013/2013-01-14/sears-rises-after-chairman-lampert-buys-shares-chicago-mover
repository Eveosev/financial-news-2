Sears Holdings Corp. (SHLD)  climbed the
most in more than four months after Chairman  Edward Lampert 
disclosed that he increased his stake in the retailer last week
after being named chief executive officer.  Sears increased 8.9 percent to $44.60 at the close in New
York for biggest gain since Sept. 6.  Lampert spent $13.6 million of personal funds to buy
332,048 on the Sears shares on Jan. 9 and Jan. 10, according to
a regulatory filing today. The Hoffman Estates, Illinois-based
department-store chain said Jan. 7 that Lampert, 50, will take
over as CEO in February when Lou D’Ambrosio steps down because
of a health matter in his family.  Lampert and his funds are Sears’ largest investors,
controlling more than half of the shares.  ESL Investments Inc., the hedge fund run by Lampert, named
former Best Buy Co. interim CEO G.  Mike Mikan  as president,
effective Jan. 1. He reports to Lampert.  To contact the reporter on this story:
