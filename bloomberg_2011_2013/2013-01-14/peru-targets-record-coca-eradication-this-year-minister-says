Peru  will destroy a record 22,000
hectares (54,363 acres) of coca bushes this year to stem rising
production of the raw material used to make cocaine, the
government said.  President  Ollanta Humala ’s government will increase
eradication 57 percent from the 14,000 hectares of coca bushes
removed last year, Interior Minister Wilfredo Pedraza said in a
 statement  posted on the ministry’s website.  Humala is boosting counter-narcotic spending to halt a boom
in the coca crop that the United Nations says now rivals
Colombia’s as the world’s largest. For the first time the drive
to curtail cultivation will be extended to the valley of the
Apurimac, Ene and Mantaro Rivers, an area of jungle in the south
of the country where holdout members of the Shining Path, a
Maoist insurgency group, are active, Pedraza said.  The government seeks to “break all records” in the drugs
fight, including seizures of cocaine and chemicals used to
process the drug, he said.  The area under cultivation in Peru increased for a sixth
straight year to 62,500 hectares in 2011, from 61,200 hectares
in 2010, according to Sept. 26 report by the  United Nations 
Office on Drugs and Crime.  To contact the reporter on this story:
