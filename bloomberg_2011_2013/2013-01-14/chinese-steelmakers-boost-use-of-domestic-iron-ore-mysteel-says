Steelmakers in China, the world’s
 biggest iron ore importer , are using more domestic supplies of
the raw material after a rally in the price of imports,
according to Mysteel.com.  Domestic ore accounted for 84.1 percent of the fines used
to process into pellet feed and 28.2 percent of the ore used to
produce sinter feed as of Jan. 11, up from 80.1 percent and 26.2
percent respectively reported on Dec. 21, the researcher said in
a  survey report  of 60 smaller mills on its website. Pellet and
sinter feed are both used in blast furnaces to make iron in
steel production.  Iron ore delivered to ports in China surged to $158.50 a
dry ton on Jan. 8, the highest in almost 15 months. Steelmakers
including Jianlong Steel Holdings Co.,  China ’s third-largest
non-state mill, and Zenith Steel Group Corp. said last week
they’d like to buy more local ore, even as the nation’s coldest
winter in 28 years keeps domestic mines closed and local
supplies limited.  “Mills are more willing to use domestic ore to tame the
rise in raw-material costs,” Xie Yingwu, a Shanghai-based
analyst with Mysteel.com, the nation’s biggest iron and steel
researcher, said in the report.  Ore with 62 percent iron conten t delivered to China’s
northern port of Tianjin jumped 83 percent to $158.50 a ton last
week, rebounding from an almost three-year low reached on Sept.
5, according to a gauge compiled by The Steel Index Ltd. Prices
declined 2.1 percent, the biggest drop since Sept. 24, to
$154.90 on Jan. 11.  Cheaper Ore  Iron ore  from  Australia  arriving at China’s northern city
of Qianan is 40 yuan ($6.43) to 50 yuan a dry ton more expensive
than domestic fines, Xie said Jan. 11. China’s ore contains
about 20 percent iron, compared with more than 55 percent iron
in Australian ore, making it more expensive to extract.  Iron ore inventories for pellet-making, in which domestic
ore is mostly used, climbed to 3.41 million tons as of Jan. 11,
from 2.83 million tons on Dec. 21, the report said. Ore
inventories for sinters, in which imported ore accounts for 72
percent, declined to 2.25 million tons from 2.35 million tons
during the same period, it said.  A recovery in local supplies of iron ore isn’t expected
until March with cold weather in northern China making it
impossible for supplies to resume, Mirae Securities Co. analysts
Henry Liu and Shirley Zhao said in an e-mailed note last week.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
