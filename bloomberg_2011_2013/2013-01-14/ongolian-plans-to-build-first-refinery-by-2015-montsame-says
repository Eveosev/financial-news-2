Mongolia targets ending its reliance
on imported fuel by 2015 with the completion of the country’s
first oil refinery, the state-owned Montsame  News Agency 
reported.  The plant will be able to process two million metric tons
of oil per year, sufficient for domestic needs, the news agency
reported Jan. 12, citing a government meeting held that day.
Japan’s  Toyo Engineering Corp. (6330)  will build the refinery, in
conjunction with unidentified Mongolian companies, with
financing for the project to be discussed with Japanese banks
next month, the report said.  The refinery is planned for Darkhan city, according to the
report. Darkhan, which means “blacksmith” and is located 140
miles north of the capital Ulan Bator, was established in 1961
with assistance from the  Soviet Union  as an industrial and
agricultural hub.  Domestic production of gasoline will help cut prices 6-8
percent, according to Montsame. The investment in the refinery
could be recouped in four years, the agency reported. Mongolia
currently relies on imported gasoline and other oil products,
nearly all of which comes from  Russia .  Mongolia has been in talks with Japanese companies to build
the refinery since at least 2011. An article published by the
news portal infomongolia.com in June 2011 said the facility
would be built within three years. The report said $600 million
was expected to be invested in the project.  To contact the reporter on this story:
