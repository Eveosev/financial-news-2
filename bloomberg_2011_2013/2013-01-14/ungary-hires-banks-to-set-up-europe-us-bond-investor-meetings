Hungary hired banks for meetings
with bond investors in the U.S. and  Europe  as the country
prepares to sell notes on international markets for the first
time in 20 months.  The Debt Management Agency, known as AKK, picked  BNP
Paribas SA (BNP) ,  Citigroup Inc. (C) ,  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  and  Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS)  to arrange meetings “in the coming weeks,” the
agency said in an e-mailed statement today. The forint
appreciated 0.2 percent to 295.25 per euro by 6:18 p.m. in
Budapest after falling as much as 0.9 percent today.  Hungary, which last sold Eurobonds in May 2011 and is due
to repay 5.1 billion euros ($6.8 billion) in foreign-currency
debt this year, plans to issue 4 billion euros to 4.5 billion
euros on the international markets in 2013, the agency said in a
separate e-mailed statement today. The agency seeks to sell
notes “as soon as possible,” Deputy Chief Executive Officer
Laszlo Andras Borbely told reporters in Budapest on Dec. 20.  “It would have been really hard to survive another year
based on forint issuance only,” Viktor Szabo, who helps manage
about $10 billion in emerging-market debt at Aberdeen Asset
Management, wrote in e-mailed comments today. “It’s important
to help ease the pressure on the forint bond market.”  Yield Impact  The yield on  Hungary ’s euro notes due in 2020 rose three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 4.92 percent today,
the highest since Jan. 2. Yields on forint-denominated notes due
in 2022 fell one basis point to 6.26 percent after a 16 basis
point increase on Jan. 11.  The AKK raised its offer of euro-denominated inflation-
linked bonds due in 2015 and sold under Hungarian law to 1
billion euros from 600 million euros on Jan. 11. With most of
that sale already snapped up by today by Hungarian businesses
and households, the agency said it will sell a new note due in
2016 that is linked to euro-area inflation, without specifying
the size.  The inflation-linked bonds “can’t replace entering
international capital markets,” the agency said today. “The
AKK will determine the timing and currency type of capital
market issuance based on the market environment.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
