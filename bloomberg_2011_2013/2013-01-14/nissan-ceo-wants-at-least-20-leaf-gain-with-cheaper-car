Carlos Ghosn , who leads  Nissan Motor
Co. (7201)  and  Renault SA (RNO) , said he expects global deliveries of all-
electric Nissan Leafs to expand at least 20 percent this year
aided by the addition of a lower-priced version.  The company today said the new S trim version of its
rechargeable hatchback will have a $28,800 base price when it
goes on sale this year. Prices for its current SV and SL grade
cars for 2013 will be $31,820 and $34,840, respectively, the
company said at the North American International Auto Show in
Detroit.  Nissan, Japan’s second-largest carmaker, sold 9,819 Leafs
in the U.S. last year, less than half of Ghosn’s 20,000 goal.
Ghosn cited limited charge infrastructure as one reason for the
result and declined to set a specific sales target for the
lithium-ion powered hatchback  “You can expect them to be up,” Ghosn told reporters
today in  Detroit . “It would be fair to say” that Leaf should
post at least a 20 increase, he said.  Base prices for the 2012 SV and SL Leafs are $35,200 and
$37,250, respectively, before a $7,500 federal tax credit,
according to Nissan’s  website .  He said the company’s bullish early targets for the car
reflected “passion” for the product rather than “arrogance.”  Production of the car and its battery packs is under way in
Smyrna, Tennessee, the company said this month.  Nissan is coming off record U.S. sales in 2012, aided by
deliveries of Altima sedans and Rogue crossovers. The Yokohama,
Japan-based company boosted deliveries 9.5 percent to 1.14
million Nissan and Infiniti brand vehicles.  Nissan’s U.S. headquarters are in Franklin,  Tennessee .  To contact the reporter on this story:
