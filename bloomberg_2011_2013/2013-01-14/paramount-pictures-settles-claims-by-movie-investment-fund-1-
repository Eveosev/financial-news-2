Viacom Inc. (VIAB) ’s Paramount Pictures
reached a settlement Melrose Investors 2 LP, a movie financing
fund that sued claiming it hadn’t received any returns from its
$375 million investment in movies including “Transformers.”  “The dispute was satisfactorily resolved,”  Robert
Lawson, a Paramount spokesman, said yesterday in an e-mailed
statement.  Mark Holscher, the investors’ lawyer, said in an e-mail
that the owners of Melrose 2 are private-equity funds and that
Vine Alternative Investment Group managed the fund. He declined
to comment on the settlement, saying it was confidential, other
than to confirm it was “satisfactorily resolved.”  The investors sued Paramount in 2011, alleging that the
studio overreported the production and the distribution costs of
the movies co-financed by Melrose 2 and underreported the
revenue. The 29 movies that Melrose 2 co-funded include
“Mission Impossible 2,” “Transformers,” “Transformers 2,”
and “Flags of Our Fathers,” according to the complaint.  The Melrose 2-backed films grossed about $7 billion and
Paramount received $600 million in distribution fees alone from
them, the investors said in the Nov. 29, 2011, complaint filed
in California state court in  Los Angeles .  The case is Melrose Investors 2 v.  Paramount Pictures ,
BC474310, California Superior Court, Los Angeles County.  To contact the reporter on this story:
