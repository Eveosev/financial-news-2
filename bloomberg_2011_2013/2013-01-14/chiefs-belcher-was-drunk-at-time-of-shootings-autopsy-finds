Kansas City Chiefs linebacker Jovan Belcher was drunk when he fatally shot his girlfriend and
himself last month, according to a Jackson County, Missouri,
Medical Examiner’s autopsy report.  Belcher’s blood-alcohol level was .17, more than twice the
legal limit, when he shot himself in the head in front of then-
General Manager Scott Pioli and coach Romeo Crennel on Dec. 1 at
the National Football League team’s Arrowhead Stadium, according
to the report, which was released today.  He shot his girlfriend, Kasandra Perkins, 22, nine times
that morning, the medical examiner also said. The couple had a
3-month-old daughter. Belcher’s mother, who lives at the home
where the shooting occurred, called police.  Perkins was shot in the chest twice, neck, abdomen, back,
hip, left leg, right leg and right hand, according to the
report. Neither Belcher nor Perkins had any signs of illegal
drugs in their system, the medical examiner said.  The 6-foot-2, 228-pound Belcher was in his fourth season
with the Chiefs, who signed him as a rookie free agent from the
 University of Maine  in 2009.  The Chiefs finished the season with a 2-14 record, the
worst in the NFL. Crennel was fired on Dec. 31 and succeeded by
Andy Reid. Pioli was dismissed on Jan. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
