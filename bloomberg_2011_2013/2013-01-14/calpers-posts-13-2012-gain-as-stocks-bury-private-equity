The  California Public Employees’
Retirement System , the largest U.S. pension at $252.3 billion,
earned about 13 percent on invested assets last year, led by
increases in stocks and private equity.  That compared with a 1.1 percent return in 2011, according
to the fund. Private-equity investments, whose reporting lags
behind the rest of the results, climbed about 12 percent for the
year through September, less than half the target rate, Calpers
said yesterday. Publicly traded shares rose about 17 percent,
meeting goals for the period ending Dec. 31.  Public pensions such as Calpers have been under pressure to
boost investment returns following historic declines stemming
from the global financial crisis and the 18-month recession that
ended in 2009. In 2008, the Sacramento, California-based system
lost almost 28 percent on investments.  “In pension-fund time, one year isn’t a long time,” Chief
Investment Officer  Joe Dear  said at a Calpers board meeting in
Monterey. “I’m pleased, but not excessively so.”  The fund has about 74 percent of assets required to meet
long-term obligations, according to Calpers. When the pension’s
investments underperform benchmarks, the state and
municipalities must make up the difference.  Below Threshold  For the first half of fiscal 2013, invested assets rose 7.1
percent. That’s an improvement from fiscal 2012, which ended
June 30, when it earned just 0.1 percent. It was the third year
in five that Calpers failed to reach the 7.5 percent threshold
needed to meet projected obligations, data show.  For fiscal 2011, the system’s assets earned almost 21
percent, the best result since at least 1990, led by gains in
stocks and private equity.  Following the historic declines, the fund set about
restructuring its real-estate holdings, inserting more risk
controls into investment decision-making, hedging some holdings
against inflation, and allowing managers to better coordinate
between asset classes.  Still, with half its assets invested in stocks, the fund is
subject to market volatility. Its 10-year return as of Dec. 31
was about 7.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
