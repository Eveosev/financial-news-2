The U.S. Supreme Court signaled
interest in  Pfizer Inc. (PFE) ’s bid for a shield from some asbestos
lawsuits connected to its Quigley Co. subsidiary, a bankrupt
unit that stopped most operations in 1992.  The justices today asked the Obama administration for
advice on Pfizer’s appeal of a ruling that opened the New York-
based drugmaker to some claims related to Quigley. That company
made asbestos-containing products for the  steel industry  from
the 1940s to the 1970s. Pfizer acquired Quigley in 1968.
Asbestos, once widely used an insulator, was later shown to
cause cancer.  Pfizer, the world’s largest drugmaker, contends that
Quigley’s bankruptcy proceedings insulate the parent company
from suits filed by the Baltimore law firm of Peter Angelos. The
firm began suing Pfizer in Pennsylvania state courts in 1999,
saying the company was legally responsible for some claims
because its logo appeared on Quigley products.  Pfizer says it played no role in making or selling the
Quigley products. A federal appeals court in  New York  said the
claims against Pfizer could go forward.  The Supreme Court case is Pfizer v. Law Offices of Peter
Angelos, 12-300. The bankruptcy case is In re Quigley Co.,
04-15739,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
