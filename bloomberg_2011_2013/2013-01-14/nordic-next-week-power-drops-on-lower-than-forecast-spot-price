Nordic electricity for next week
retreated as the price for power delivered today turned out
lower than market expectations.  “All front contracts through February are dropping on the
back of a lower-than-expected spot price for today, while the
contracts for March and further out are supported by a dry and
cold weather outlook,” Arne Oesterlind, a  fund manager  at
Shepherd Energy, said today by phone from  Stockholm .  Electricity for delivery around the clock today costs 46.29
euros ($61.91) a megawatt-hour on average, following yesterday’s
auction on the Nord Pool Spot AS exchange in Oslo. That’s lower
than market expectations of 51.50 euros on average for this
week, as reflected by the financial contract for today, which
closed on Jan. 11 on the the Nasdaq OMX Group Inc.’s energy
exchange in Oslo.  The week-ahead contract lost as much as 3.2 percent to
50.75 euros a megawatt-hour and traded at 51.25 euros as of
11:33 a.m. on the Nasdaq OMX Group’s energy exchange. February
power retreated 0.3 percent to 46.80 euros while March power
gained 0.4 percent to 41.25 euros.  Low temperatures in Oslo are forecast to drop to minus 20
degrees Celsius (minus 4 Fahrenheit) on Jan. 21 from minus 18
today, according to CustomWeather Inc. data on Bloomberg.  The region’s hydropower reserves are 4.93 terawatt-hours
below the seasonal average and may drop further to a deficit of
11.6 terawatt-hours in two weeks, according to Markedskraft AS
data on Bloomberg. The region, which gets more than half of its
power supplies by running water through turbines, had a surplus
of 9 terawatt-hours as recently as the end of November.  The utilization rate of Swedish and Finnish nuclear
reactors rose to a five-week high of 96 percent as of 7:45 a.m.
Stockholm time, after  EON SE (EOAN)  started its 638-megawatt
Oskarshamn-2 reactor yesterday following a five-week halt,
according to data from the operator and calculations by
Bloomberg. The region gets a fifth of power output from atomic
reactors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
