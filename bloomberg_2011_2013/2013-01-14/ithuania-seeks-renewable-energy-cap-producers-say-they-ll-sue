Lithuania ’s government, seeking to
block a surge in subsidized renewable energy, approved draft
legislation to limit permits for installing new capacity.
Producers opposed the change, saying they would sue for damages.  “The amendments are intended to protect the interests of
all electricity consumers by preventing a surge in electricity
prices,” the government in the capital, Vilnius, said today in
an e-mailed statement. The size and pace of expansion,
especially of small solar installations, was unsustainable, it
said.  The Baltic nation’s Energy Ministry issued about 5,300
permits to install or expand wind, solar, hydroelectric and
biomass power plants in 2011 and 2012. It has received another
10,000 requests for permits, mostly to build solar plants with
capacity of 30 kilowatts or less, according to the statement.  The legislation would halt the issuance of permits when
national capacity targets are reached - 500 megawatts for  wind
turbines , 10 megawatts for solar plants, 141 megawatts for
hydroelectric generation and 355 megawatts for biomass power
plants. It would also put on hold already issued permits for
small solar plants that aren’t operating yet.  Producers stand to lose about 500 million litai ($193
million) of already committed resources if parliament adopts the
changes, 11 groups representing Lithuania’s renewable energy
companies said in a joint statement today on the BNS news
service. They pledged to sue the state for compensation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
