Arizona  Governor Jan Brewer said she will create a task force to combat human trafficking.  Brewer, a second-term Republican, announced during her State-of-the-State speech that she will issue an executive order to establish the task force. Brewer also used the occasion to praise Cindy McCain, the wife of Arizona U.S. Senator John McCain.  “This is truly a crime against humanity -- a modern-day slavery in which men, women and children are sold into forced labor or prostitution,” Brewer said. “Cindy McCain has been a leading voice in the fight against human trafficking. She’s with us today, and I look forward to working with her and legislators to combat this growing problem.”  Matthew Benson, Brewer’s spokesman, said no members of the  task force  have been appointed yet.  Brewer, known for signing the nation’s toughest state immigration law in 2010, also reiterated her assertion that any national overhaul must begin by securing the border.  She pledged to “work with all fair-minded people” to fix the nation’s broken immigration system once the border is secured with additional fencing, personnel and technology.
