Profits at Lithuanian state-owned
companies fell 9.3 percent from a year earlier in the first nine
months of 2012, mainly because of higher fuel, salary and
services costs, the State Property Fund said.  Aggregate net income was 366 million litai ($142 million),
compared with 404 million litai in January-September 2011, the
fund, based in the capital, Vilnius, said today in an e-mailed
statement. Combined sales for the companies rose 1 percent from
a year earlier to 5 billion litai, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
