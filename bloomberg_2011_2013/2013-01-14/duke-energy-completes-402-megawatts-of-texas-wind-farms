A unit of  Duke Energy Corp (DUK) , the
largest U.S. utility owner by market value, has started
producing power at wind farms in  Texas  with 402 megawatts of
combined capacity.  The 200-megawatt Los Vientos I project in Willacy County is
selling power to CPS Energy Products Inc. and the 202-megawatt
Los Vientos II project in Wilacy and Cameron Counties is selling
power to Austin Energy, Charlotte, North Carolina-based Duke
Energy Renewables said today in a statement.  The projects will “boost economic development, support the
local school districts, and be a source of dependable tax
revenue for years to come,” Duke Energy Renewables President
Greg Wolf said in the statement.  Duke’s unit, with enough capacity to power half a million
homes, now has more than 1,700 megawatts of wind and solar
capacity, Wolf said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
