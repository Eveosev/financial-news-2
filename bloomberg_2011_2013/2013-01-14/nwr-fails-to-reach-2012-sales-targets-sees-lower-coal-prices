New World Resources Plc (NWR)  tumbled the
most in two months as the biggest Czech producer of coking coal
said it will curb investment after 2012 sales fell below target.  The stock tumbled 5.4 percent to 94.60 koruna by the close
in  Prague , the biggest drop since Nov. 13 and the worst
performance in the 13-member  PX (PX)  index today. NWR’s share
turnover was twice the daily average over the past three months.  NWR sold 9.7 megatons of coal and 555 kilotons of coke last
year, less than a projected 10.3 megatons and 600 kilotons
respectively, as Europe’s economic crisis and a manufacturing
slowdown in China damped demand from steelmakers, the Amsterdam-
based company said today in a statement.  “NWR failed to reach its targets, especially in the fourth
quarter,” Miroslav Adamkovic, an analyst at Komercni Banka AS,
said in a report to clients. “That’s negative for the shares.”  The company said it plans to cut capital and operating
expenses by as much as 50 percent in 2013 and produce between 10
and 11 megatons of coal and 800 kilotons of coke this year.  NWR owns four mines and two coking facilities in the  Czech
Republic  and sells to customers in central Europe, including the
Czech unit of  ArcelorMittal (MT) , the world’s largest steelmaker. The
company is scheduled to report full 2012 earnings on Feb. 21.  The stock fell 28 percent last year and 50 percent in 2011.  To contact the reporters on this story:
