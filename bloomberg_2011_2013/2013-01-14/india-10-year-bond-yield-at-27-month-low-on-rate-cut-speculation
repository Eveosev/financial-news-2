India ’s 10-year bonds advanced,
pushing the yield to the lowest level in 27 months, on
speculation the central bank will cut  interest rates .  The  Reserve Bank  of India will lower the repurchase  rate  by
50 basis points to 7.5 percent by the end of March, according to
11 of 22 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Wholesale prices
probably rose 7.37 percent in December from a year earlier, near
the 10-month low of 7.24 percent in November, according to a
Bloomberg survey before a report due today. Industrial  output 
fell 0.1 percent in November from a year earlier, after rising
8.3 percent the month before, government data showed on Jan. 11.  “Concerns over growth may prompt the central bank to ease
its policy in the coming months,” said N.S. Venkatesh, Mumbai-
based head of treasury at state-run IDBI Bank Ltd. “Inflation
is also softening to comfortable levels.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent bonds due June 2022 fell one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.86 percent as of
10:01 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. That is the lowest level for a benchmark 10-year
security since September 2010.  Eight of the economists surveyed on the repurchase rate see
a 25 basis point reduction by the end of this quarter. Of the
remaining three, UBS AG forecasts a 100 basis point cut, Westpac
Banking Corp. predicts the rate will be held, while Woori CBV
Securities Corp. sees a quarter of a percentage point increase.
The next policy review is on Jan. 29.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell one basis
point to 7.53 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
