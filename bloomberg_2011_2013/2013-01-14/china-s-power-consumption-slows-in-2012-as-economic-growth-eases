China ’s power-consumption growth
slowed last year as economic expansion in the world’s biggest
energy user eased.  Electricity demand rose 5.5 percent in 2012 to 4.96
trillion kilowatt hours, the National Energy Administration  said 
on its website today. Power use increased 11.7 percent in 2011.  China’s electricity needs slowed as the financial crisis in
 Europe  weighed on exports and curbed economic growth. The
nation’s gross domestic product is estimated to have expanded
7.7 percent last year, compared with 9.3 percent in 2011,
according to the median estimate of 49 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg from Dec. 13 to Dec. 18.  Secondary industries, which include typically energy-
intensive mining, manufacturing and construction companies,
consumed 3.9 percent more electricity in 2012 than a year ago,
today’s report showed. Power demand by primary industries, which
include agriculture and livestock, was unchanged, according to
the NEA. Electricity use by the tertiary sector, including
services and logistics, increased 11.5 percent.  China’s power demand may increase 4.8 percent in 2013 from
a year ago, Jefferies Group Inc. said in an emailed report Dec.
28. Consumption by the tertiary sector will outpace that of the
industrial sector amid continued efficiency gains, it said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
