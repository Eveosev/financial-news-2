Egypt ’s top prosecutor has lifted a
travel ban on 10 former Hosni Mubarak-era officials after they
repaid the value of gifts they were said to have received from
the country’s leading state-run newspaper, the Ahram Gate
website reported.  The order issued by Prosecutor-General Talaat Abdullah
includes former Prime Minister Ahmed Nazif and the ex-head of
the parliament’s lower house, the state-run news website
reported. It cited a judicial official as saying the order was
temporary, pending further investigations into the gifts
allegedly doled out between 2006 and 2011 by the Ahram
newspaper’s former top officials.  Financial prosecutors yesterday approved a request by
Mubarak to repay 18 million Egyptian pounds ($2.74 million) in
connection with reported gifts from the institution. Authorities
had ordered him held for 15 days pending investigations into the
charges linked to the so-called “Ahram gifts” case.  The offer to settle the case came shortly after a court
overturned Mubarak’s life sentence in connection with failing to
stop the death of protesters during the uprising that ousted him
in 2011. He was ordered retried, though no date has yet been
set.  -Editors: Digby Lidstone,  Karl Maier .  To contact the reporter on this story:
