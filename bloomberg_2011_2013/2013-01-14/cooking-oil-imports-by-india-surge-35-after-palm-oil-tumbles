Cooking oil imports by  India , the
world’s largest  palm oil  buyer, jumped last month after a
decline in prices of the tropical commodity and domestic oilseed
supplies spurred demand, a processors’ group said.  Shipments surged 35 percent to 901,092 metric tons in
December from 669,912 tons a year earlier, the  Solvent
Extractors’ Association of India  said in an e-mailed statement
today. That matched a median estimate of 900,000 tons in a
Bloomberg survey of five processors and brokers last week.  Rising Indian purchases may help trim record stockpiles in
 Malaysia , the world’s second-largest producer, and curb a
decline in prices, which fell 23 percent in 2012. Malaysia will
allow shipments of the crude oil at zero duty for another month
in February as it seeks to reduce inventory, Plantation
Industries and Commodities Minister Bernard Dompok said.  “Heavy discount of palm products of $300 to $350 per ton
over soft oils, and lower domestic production of vegetable oils
due to slowdown in crushing pushed up the import of palm
products even during the winter season,” B.V. Mehta,  executive
director  at the trade group, said in the statement.  Palm oil for delivery in March was little changed at 2,367
ringgit ($784) a ton on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange at
1:25 p.m. in Mumbai, erasing gains of as much as 1.4 percent
earlier. Futures slumped to a three-year low of 2,217 ringgit on
Dec. 13. Soybean oil’s  premium  was at $313.572 a ton today,
compared with an average of $208.33 a ton in the past year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Sunflower Drops  Crude palm oil imports  rose 44 percent to 628,618 tons in
December, while refined palm oil purchases climbed 28 percent to
137,475 tons, the extractors’ association said.  Soybean oil 
imports nearly tripled to 21,960 tons from 7,387 tons a year
ago, while sunflower oil purchases dropped 27 percent to 69,000
tons, it said.  Inventories, including those at ports and in the pipeline,
were 1.46 million tons as of Jan. 1, data from the association
showed. India imported a record 10.2 million tons of vegetable
oils in 2011-2012, according to the extractors’ association.  India’s palm oil imports may rise by 750,000 tons this
year, Govindlal G. Patel, managing partner at GG Patel & Nikhil
Research Co., said in  Kuala Lumpur  today. Imports were 7.57
million tons in 2011-2012, according to the trade body data.  Palm oil represents almost 80 percent of India’s cooking-
oil imports. It buys palm from Indonesia and Malaysia, and
soybean oil from Brazil and  Argentina .  To contact the reporter on this story:
