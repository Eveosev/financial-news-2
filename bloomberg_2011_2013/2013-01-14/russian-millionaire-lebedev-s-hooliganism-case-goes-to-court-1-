Russian newspaper owner  Alexander Lebedev  is set to face trial in the coming weeks after Moscow
prosecutors sent a case over alleged hooliganism to court.  “The trial should start in a few weeks,” Lebedev’s
spokesman, Artem Artemov, said by phone today. Lebedev, 53,
faces a maximum of five years in prison for punching Sergei Polonsky, a property developer, on a televised talk show in
2011. Lebedev denies any wrongdoing.  The former KGB agent, who served in the Soviet Embassy in
London during the  Cold War , has said his fortune has fallen to
several hundred million dollars from $2 billion two years ago
after he’s come under official pressure. Lebedev says he’s the
subject of a three-year campaign in retaliation for funding
 Novaya Gazeta , a newspaper critical of President  Vladimir Putin 
that investigates corruption. Lebedev also controls the Evening
Standard and Independent newspapers in the U.K.  Polonsky, 40, is in detention in Cambodia after an incident
in which and he and two other Russians allegedly threatened the
crew of a boat with a knife. Polonsky denies the accusations.  The Cambodian sailors have dropped their claims about the
attack after an agreement was reached on compensating them, an
unidentified member of Polonsky’s defense team was cited as
saying by the Russian state news service RIA Novosti.  To contact the reporter on this story:
