Hong Kong ’s Exchange Fund will boost
investments in emerging-market securities and yuan-denominated
assets after posting its second-highest annual investment income
on record.  The fund’s 4.4 percent return on investments last year
brought income of HK$108.6 billion ($14 billion), Hong Kong
Monetary Authority Chief Executive  Norman Chan  said at a
briefing in the city yesterday. That compared with a 1.1 percent
gain in 2011 and the 5.6 percent annual average return since
1994, according to a statement by the HKMA.  “The board has agreed to transfer emerging-market bonds
and equities and  renminbi  assets into the investment portfolio
as liquidity improves,” Chan said. “Global financial markets
will continue to be subject to many uncertainties in 2013.”  The HKMA will discuss raising its quota in the Qualified
Foreign Institutional Investor Program with Chinese authorities,
Chan said. The HKMA has a quota of $1 billion in the QFII
program, which allows foreign investors to trade in China’s
onshore equity and bond markets.  Among its assets last year, the Exchange Fund had HK$47
billion in yuan-denominated assets, HK$47 billion in private
equity, HK$41 billion in emerging-market bonds and equities, and
HK$14 billion in real estate, Chan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
