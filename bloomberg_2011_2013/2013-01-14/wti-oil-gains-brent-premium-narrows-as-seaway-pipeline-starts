Oil traded near a four-month high in
New York, narrowing its discount to Brent crude to the least
since September, after the expansion of a pipeline that may
reduce a glut in the U.S. Midwest.  West  Texas  Intermediate climbed as much as 0.8 percent
after a fifth weekly gain, the longest run of advances since
August. The 500 mile (805 kilometer) Seaway line running from
Cushing,  Oklahoma , to Freeport, Texas, resumed service after
shutting Jan. 2 to boost capacity to 400,000 barrels a day from
150,000 barrels,  Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD)  and  Enbridge
Inc. (ENB)  said Jan. 11.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  said WTI’s discount
to Brent will shrink to $6 a barrel in the second quarter, from
$17 today.  “Cushing stocks should start to decline with the start of
the extended Seaway pipeline,” said  Carsten Fritsch , an analyst
at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt , who predicts the spread between
WTI and Brent may narrow to $15 a barrel this quarter.  Crude for February delivery rose as much as 73 cents to
$94.29 a barrel and was at $93.99 in electronic trading on the
New York Mercantile Exchange at 12:40 p.m. London time. Prices
traded as high as $94.70 on Jan. 10, the most since Sept. 19.  Brent for February settlement was at $111.18 a barrel, up
54 cents, on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The
European benchmark contract was at a premium of $17.22 to WTI.
It settled at $17.08 on Jan. 11, the narrowest gap based on
closing prices since Sept. 19.  Oil Glut  WTI dropped 7.1 percent in 2012 as the U.S. shale boom
deepened the glut at Cushing, America’s largest storage hub and
the delivery point for WTI. That left it at an average discount
of $17.47 a barrel to Brent last year, compared with a premium
of about 7 cents in the five years through 2010. Brent, the
benchmark grade for more than half the world’s crude, climbed
3.5 percent last year.  Goldman Sachs expects a “substantial narrowing of the WTI-
Brent spread” as a result of a “more balanced market” in the
U.S., compared with the surplus at the end of 2012, Jeff Currie,
head of commodities research in New York, said in a report.  Crude stockpiles at Cushing rose to a record  50.1 million
barrels  in the week ended Jan. 4, Energy Department data show.  Global crude supply is set to increase this year amid
growth from both OPEC and non-OPEC producers, according to
Morgan Stanley.  Hedge Funds  The production capacity of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will rise by 713,000 barrels a day in 2013,
led by an addition of 265,000 barrels of supply from  Iraq ,
 Hussein Allidina , head of commodities research at the bank, said
in a report today. Projects in Angola and Nigeria will add
another 187,000 barrels a day, according to the bank.  Hedge funds boosted bullish bets on oil to the highest
level in more than three months, according to a report from the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  Money managers raised net-long positions, or  wagers  that
the U.S. benchmark crude will gain, by 12 percent in the week
ended Jan. 8, according to the CFTC’s Jan. 11 Commitments of
Traders report. Net-long positions held by money managers,
including hedge funds, commodity pools and commodity-trading
advisers, jumped by 18,173 futures and options combined to
168,066.  In  London , hedge funds and other money managers raised
bullish positions on Brent crude by 10,925 contracts to the
highest in more than nine months, according to ICE data.  Speculative bets that prices will rise, in futures and
options combined, outnumbered short positions by 150,036 lots in
the week ended Jan. 8, the highest level since March 27, the
London-based exchange said today in its weekly Commitment of
Traders report. That’s the fourth consecutive weekly advance.  WTI’s advance may stall as a technical indicator continues
to show futures have risen too quickly for further gains to be
sustainable. The 14-day relative strength index remains close to
70, a reading that signals a market is overbought and may
decline. Crude fell on Jan. 11 after the RSI climbed above 70
the previous day for the first time since August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
