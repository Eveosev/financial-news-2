Chicago Mayor  Rahm Emanuel  ordered a
review of city pension-fund holdings today to determine whether
fund managers hold stakes in companies that manufacture or sell
military-style guns.  “We cannot support or invest in companies that profit from
the proliferation of assault weapons and the violence these guns
bring to our communities,” Emanuel said in a statement released
by his office.  “If our fund managers have invested in a company that
manufactures or sells assault weapons, I will ask them to remove
these investments from our retirement funds,” said Emanuel, who
ordered Comptroller Amer Ahmad to request the analysis from five
pension and retirement funds for city employees.  An assault rifle was used in the Dec. 14 killings of 20
children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in
Newtown,  Connecticut . And Chicago has its own struggle with
violence: The city reported 506 homicides in 2012, its highest
number in four years.  Emanuel’s directive comes one week after  California 
Treasurer Bill Lockyer expanded his proposal to have the state’s
pension funds divest holdings in firearms manufacturers to
include companies that make high-capacity ammunition clips.  Lockyer last month proposed that the California Public
Employees Retirement System, or Calpers and the California State
Teachers’ Retirement System, known as Calstrs, sell their
investments in any gunmaker that produces weapons that are
banned in California.  To contact the reporter on this story:
