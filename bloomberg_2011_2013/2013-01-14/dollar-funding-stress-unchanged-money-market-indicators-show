Money-market forward indicators
signaled short-term dollar funding conditions were little
changed.  Three-month London interbank offered rate, or Libor, held
for a second day  at  0.304 percent, the lowest since Aug. 19,
2011, according to the British Bankers’ Association. The Libor-
OIS spread, a gauge of banks reluctance to lend, was little
changed at 17 basis points.  Overnight index swaps, or OIS, give traders predictions on
where the Fed’s effective funds rate will average for the term
of the swap. The central bank’s target rate is set in a range of
zero to 0.25 percent.  Predictions in the forward market for Libor-OIS, known as
the FRA/OIS spread, rose to 18 basis points from 17.2 basis
points on Jan. 11, according to the second rolling three month
contracts.  The difference between the two-year swap rate and the
comparable-maturity Treasury note yield, known as the swap
spread, widened 0.2 basis point to 13.63 basis points yesterday.
The gap is a gauge of investors’ perceptions of U.S. banking
sector credit risk as swap rates are derived from expectations
for dollar Libor.  Swap rates serve as benchmarks for investors in many types
of debt, including mortgage-backed and auto-loan securities.  The seasonally adjusted amount of U.S.  commercial paper 
rose $23.2 billion to $1.105 trillion in the week ended Jan. 9,
according to Federal Reserve data.  Euribor-OIS Spread  The cost for European banks to convert euro-denominated
payment streams into dollars-based funding via the cross
currency swaps market held steady. The three-month cross-
currency basis swap was 17 basis points below Euribor.  Foreign-exchange swaps are typically for periods of less
than a year, while cross-currency basis swaps usually range from
one to 30 years. The latter are agreements in which a person
borrows in one currency and simultaneously lends in a different
currency. The trade involves the exchange of two different
floating-rate payments, each denominated in a different currency
and based on a different index.  The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between the euro
interbank offered rate and overnight indexed swaps, was
unchanged. The measure of banks’ reluctance to lend to one
another was 10.4 basis points.  Repo Rates  The overnight Treasury general collateral repurchase
agreement rate opened today at 0.21 percent, according to ICAP
Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker.  The  average rate  for borrowing and lending Treasuries for
one day in the repo market was 0.148 percent on Jan. 11,
according to index data provided on a one-day lag by the
Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. That was little changed from
the day before.  Securities dealers use repos to finance holdings and
increase leverage. Securities that can be borrowed at  interest
rates  close to the Fed’s target rate are called general
collateral. Those in highest demand have lower rates and are
called “special.”  The  average rate  for overnight federal funds, known as the
fed effective rate, was 0.14 percent on Jan. 11. The rate opened
today at 0.16 percent. The effective rate is a volume-weighted
average of trades between major brokers for overnight funds,
reported on a day lag by the  Federal Reserve Bank of New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
