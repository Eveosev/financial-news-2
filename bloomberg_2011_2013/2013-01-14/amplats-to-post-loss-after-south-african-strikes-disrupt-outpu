Anglo American Platinum Ltd. (AMS) , the
biggest producer of the metal, said it expects to show a loss
for 2012 after strikes disrupted its mines in South Africa.  Amplats, as the Johannesburg-based company is known, said
the loss may be 24.87 rand to 26.24 rand on a basic earnings-
per-share basis, compared with a profit of 13.74 rand the
previous year. Amplats wrote down 6.6 billion rand ($760
million) in the carry-value of assets and projects “not in
use,” and which are considered not economically viable in the
current market environment, it said in a statement.  The shares declined as much as 3.4 percent after the
announcement, the biggest intraday fall since Oct. 29. It traded
down 2 percent at 490 rand by 11:39 a.m.  Amplats was one of several  South Africa  miners to be hit by
a wave of strikes in 2012 as workers demanded higher pay. The
company said earlier today that the two-month “illegal action”
drove platinum sales down for the period. Walkouts at the
company’s Rustenburg, Union and Amandelbult operations cut
output by 306,000 ounces, it said.  “We remain concerned regarding the company’s ability to
initiate operational changes given the current South African
social and political environment,” said Justin Froneman, an
analyst at SBG Securities, in a note to clients today. The
Johannesburg-based brokerage has a sell recommendation on
Amplats, with an price target of 435 rand.  South African gold, iron-ore and coal mines were also
halted by a wave of unauthorized strikes after  Lonmin Plc (LMI)  agreed
in September to award pay increases of 11 percent to 22 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
