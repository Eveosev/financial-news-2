Invenergy LLC, a closely held
renewable-energy developer, is reevaluating the site for a
proposed wind farm in eastern  North Carolina  as the project has
run into opposition due to its proximity to local military
bases.  “With regard to the importance of military training
routes, Invenergy takes very seriously the concerns about our
proposed Pantego Wind project design,” the Chicago-based
company said today in an e-mailed statement. “Rather than
continuing to pursue the project as previously proposed, then,
we are conducting a thorough reconsideration of the project
site.”   Invenergy announced plans for the the 80-megawatt project
in Beaufort County in 2011. It may cost as much as $160 million,
according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. The North Carolina
Utilities Commission approved a construction permit last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
