Chile’s government probably will
reduce taxes on loans to help businesses and individuals access
funding to create new products and services, Diario Financiero
 reported today , citing a speech by President Sebastian Pinera.  The reduction from today’s 0.4 percent tax rate would be
part of a more than $1 billion initiative the government is
implementing this year to promote innovation in the Andean
nation, the Santiago-based financial daily reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
