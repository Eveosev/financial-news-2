Iceland’s government agreed to slow
down talks on joining the European Union as it prepares for
parliamentary elections on April 27, according to a statement
from the prime minister’s office.  Most Icelanders oppose continuing the membership bid and
want the island’s government to withdraw it, according to a
November Capacent Gallup poll. The poll showed that 53.5 percent
of voters don’t want to proceed with the application, compared
with 36.4 percent who want the island to finish the discussions.  Iceland began EU membership talks in July 2010 and has now
opened talks in 27 of the EU’s 35 policy areas and completed 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
