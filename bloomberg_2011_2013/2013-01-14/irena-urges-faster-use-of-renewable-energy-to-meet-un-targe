Countries must “substantially”
expand their capacity to produce energy from solar, wind and
other renewable resources to meet a global United Nations
target, the  International Renewable Energy Agency  said.  Investment in power generation and grids and other
technologies for producing heat and energy in an environmentally
sustainable way should accelerate if states are to achieve the
UN’s goal of doubling renewables use by 2030, the agency known
as IRENA said. Nations must add an average renewables capacity
of 150 gigawatts a year through 2030, in contrast to the
increase in 2011 of 110 gigawatts, IRENA said today in an e-
mailed statement.  Governments want to diversify their energy mix and reduce
fuel imports and costs without adding to global carbon
emissions, IRENA Director General Adnan Amin said in a Jan. 9
interview at the agency’s  Abu Dhabi  headquarters. Declining
costs have made many renewables more competitive with fossil
fuels, he said at his office in the United Arab Emirates
capital.  A boom in the output of natural gas trapped in shale would
complement growth in renewables use because both are substitutes
for dirtier fuels such as coal, Amin said. Gas can supply
constant power, unlike intermittent wind or solar.  Costs for some types of solar panels have fallen by as much
as 60 percent in two years, Amin said. Small-scale hydropower
often provides the cheapest source of energy for  developing
countries , according to an IRENA report this week.  To contact the reporters on this story:
