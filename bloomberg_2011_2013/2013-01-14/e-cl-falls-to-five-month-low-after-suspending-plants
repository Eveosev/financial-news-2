E.CL SA (ECL) , northern  Chile ’s largest
power generator, fell to a five-month low after the company said
last week it suspended operations at two power plants to repair
cooling-systems leaks.  E.CL retreated 0.4 percent to 1,094.5 pesos at the close of
trading in Santiago, the lowest price since Aug. 1. Volume was
almost three times the average of the last three months. The
benchmark Ipsa index rose 0.4 percent.  The generator, based in Santiago, said in a Jan. 8 filing
that it suspended operations at its Central Termoelectrica
Andina and Central Termoelectrica Hornitos plants to fix the
leaks. E.CL didn’t say when it will complete the repairs.  “If it’s a long suspension, then it will affect profit
margins negatively,” Marcelo Catalan, an analyst at  Banco de
Credito e Inversiones (BCI) , said in a telephone interview. E.CL will
need to buy more expensive power in the open market to fulfill
its contract obligations, Catalan said.  When market prices are high, a suspension of more than a
month may cut earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization by as much as 9.5 percent to about $282 million for
2013, Catalan estimated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
