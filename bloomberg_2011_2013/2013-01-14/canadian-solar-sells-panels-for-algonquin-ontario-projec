Canadian Solar Inc. (CSIQ) , a solar-panel
maker, agreed to supply  Algonquin Power Co. (AQN)  with 10 megawatts of
panels for a project in Ontario.  Canadian Solar will supply Algonquin with 42,000 panels for
the project in Cornwall on which construction is scheduled to
begin in the second quarter with completion set for the fourth
quarter, the Guelph, Ontario based-company said today in a
statement. Financial terms of the deal weren’t disclosed.  The company is expanding its project pipeline in Ontario,
Shawn Qu, the company’s chairman and chief executive officer,
said in the statement today.  Canadian Solar expects to get half of its revenue this year
from selling solar projects after the price of panels has fallen
more than 60 percent since November 2010, the company said Dec.
13. On Dec. 28, it said it bought four solar projects from MEMC
Electronic Materials Inc.’s SunEdison unit for $37 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
