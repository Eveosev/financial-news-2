New South Wales,  Australia ’s biggest
cotton grower, will cap the amount of water the federal
government can buy under the nation’s Murray-Darling Basin plan
that was signed into law two months ago.  Water purchases will be restricted to 3 percent per valley
each decade, Katrina Hodgkinson, the state’s minister for
primary industries, said in a statement today. Once the limit
has been reached in a valley, no more purchases for
environmental purposes will be approved and processed by the
state, she said.  Australia signed the plan into law in November, aiming to
restore the health of the system where some river beds run dry
in years of drought and ensure sustainable  food production . The
 Murray-Darling Basin , which extends from southern Queensland to
 South Australia , covers 14 percent of Australia’s land and
produces more than one-third of the nation’s food including
wheat and dairy.  The federal government “has ignored the very real concerns
of New South Wales Basin communities about the potential size
and pace of an environmental water buyback program,” the
statement said. The 3 percent limit is “a more sustainable rate
of purchase which will provide much needed breathing space and
time for rural economies to adjust,” it said.  Water  storages  in the Murray-Darling Basin were 80 percent
full as of Jan. 10, data on the basin management authority’s
website showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
