Zimplats Holdings Ltd. (ZIM) , Zimbabwe’s
biggest producer of platinum, will complete the expansion of a
recovery plant on schedule in April, processing ore from a new 2
million metric ton underground mine, Chief Executive Officer
Alex Mhembere said.  The $460 million project will increase annual production to
270,000 ounces from 187,000 ounces last year. “The second
stage, which is underground mining development, will reach full
production in 2015 as originally planned,” Mhembere said in an
e-mailed response to questions.  Zimbabwe, which has the biggest platinum and chrome
reserves after  South Africa , doesn’t have a refinery and most of
Zimplats’s platinum is processed at Impala Platinum Ltd.’s plant
near Johannesburg. Impala, which owned 87 percent of Zimplats,
on Jan. 11 signed the terms to sell 51 percent to the country’s
black citizens.  Zimplats has spent $30 million on a feasibility study for a
refinery in  Zimbabwe  that will cost at least $2 billion,
Mhembere said. “Building a refinery is not only down to cost
and the availability of feedstock but also depends on the
availability of a number of factors, chief amongst them a stable
and adequate power supply,” he said.  Zesa Ltd., the southern African country’s only power
utility, produces 1,100 megawatts, while demand is estimated at
2,100 megawatts. The deficit has led to outages that can last as
long as 13 hours a day, curbing output, according to the
Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries.  Zimplats “isn’t expecting any major shifts” in platinum
prices “from current levels in the short term. The medium to
longer-term  price levels  will more than likely respond to supply
factors,” Mhembere said.  The metal was 0.3 percent higher at $1.641 an ounce at 9:54
a.m. in  London . It gained 9.7 percent in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
