Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PRE) , the
operator of Colombia’s largest oil field, will reach production
this year at the upper end of the company’s goal, Raymond James
Ltd. said.  Rubiales targets 15 to 30 percent average daily production
growth this year, according to a Jan. 8 statement. We “would
not be surprised if the company were to revise its guidance
upwards partway through the year,” Raymond James analysts led
by Rafi Khouri wrote in a report today.  Rubiales is trading at a level where exploration this year
and beyond should be considered a “free option,” according to
the report. They rate the stock a “strong buy.”  Pacific Rubiales operates the Rubiales field, which
includes the Rubiales and Piriri blocks in the Eastern Llanos
Basin of eastern Colombia.  Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL) , Colombia’s state-
controlled oil company, has a 50 percent stake in Piriri and 60
percent of the Rubiales block, according to the company’s
website.  Shares (PREC)  fell 0.2 percent to 40,160 pesos at the close in
Bogota. The Canadian-traded  shares  were little changed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
