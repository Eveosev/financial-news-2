Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ’s fiscal second-
quarter earnings will be less than previously expected due to
weak demand for personal-computers and the company’s new tablet,
Surface, according to  Brent Thill , an analyst at UBS AG.  Thill cut his estimate for Surface sales in half, to 1
million units for the period, which ended in December, citing
“gloomy sentiment” after the holiday shopping season, he wrote
in a research report today. He cut his earnings per share
projection for the quarter by 8 cents to 76 cents.  Microsoft initially limited sales of the device to its own
roughly 60 retail outlets and Surface also failed to draw many
customers away from Apple Inc.’s iPad and rival devices with
Google Inc.’s Android software. A new business-focused version
of Microsoft’s tablet, Surface Pro, is expected to go on sale
this month and may fare better against the iPad, Thill said.  “Surface Pro is the more promising” model, he wrote in
the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
