Spanish  government securities 
declined, with the 10-year yield rising the most in a month,
after the nation said it plans to sell 4.5 billion euros ($6
billion) of debt at an auction this week.  Italy ’s bonds dropped after the nation announced it would
sell a new 15-year benchmark security for the first time in two
years. German bunds rose for the first time in three days,
paring their worst start to a year since the introduction of the
euro in 1999, after a report showed euro-area industrial
production unexpectedly shrank in November.  France  sold 7
billion euros of bills.  “The market is making room for more supply from  Spain  and
Italy,” said  Peter Chatwell , a fixed-income strategist at
Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in  London . “That’s
pushing their yields higher given they rallied significantly
last week.”  Spanish 10-year  yields  rose 14 basis points, or 0.14
percentage point, to 5.03 percent at 4:31 p.m. London time. It
added as much as 17 basis points, the steepest intraday gain
since Dec. 10. The 5.85 percent bond due January 2022 fell
1.065, or 10.65 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 105.83. The
yield touched 4.84 percent on Jan. 11, the lowest since March 1.  Spain will auction bonds maturing in 2015, 2018 and 2041 on
Jan 17. Italy’s Rome-based Treasury will sell the new 15-year
benchmark security via banks “in the near future and in
relation to market conditions,” according to an e-mailed
statement today.  Italian Manufacturing  The yield on 10-year Italian bonds rose seven basis points
to 4.20 percent, after sliding to 4.09 percent on Jan. 11, the
least since Nov. 10, 2010.  Industrial production  in the 17-nation euro area dropped
0.3 percent from October, when it slid a revised 1 percent, the
European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said today.
Economists had forecast an increase of 0.2 percent, according to
the median of 37 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  Italian industrial output fell 1 percent from October, when
it dropped 1.1 percent, according to Istat, the national
statistics office in  Rome . The median estimate of 16 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg was for a 0.2 percent decrease.  “Today’s data comes as a reminder that it may not be plain
sailing,” said  Elisabeth Afseth , a fixed-income analyst at
Investec Bank Plc in London. “There might be a little bit of a
reversal” in Italian and Spanish bonds.  German Bunds  Germany ’s 10-year yield fell three basis points to 1.55
percent after rising to 1.61 percent on Jan. 11, the highest
level since Oct. 25. German bonds dropped 1.7 percent this year
