X5 Retail Group NV (FIVE) , Russia’s largest
food retailer by revenue, proposed Stephan DuCharme become chief
executive officer as three other executives depart.  Chief Financial Officer Kieran Balfe will resign as of
March 8 and be replaced by Sergey Piven, pending shareholder
approval at a meeting in April, X5 also said. Frank Mros, head
of so-called soft discounters, and human-resources director
Tatiana Kozhevnikova will resign, the company said.  “We view this turmoil in management as a sign of
despair,” said Ivan Kushch, an analyst at VTB Capital in
Moscow. “Appointment of DuCharme on the permanent basis is also
bad for the company as he used to be a board member and lacks
executive experience in retail.”  X5, controlled by Russian billionaire  Mikhail Fridman ’s
 Alfa Group , has slid 29 percent in the last 12 months as growth
slowed. The company’s revenue advanced 8.3 percent last year
while rival OAO Magnit posted 34 percent sales growth.  Magnit (MGNT) 
has doubled its market value since December 2011. X5 shares fell
as much as 4.9 percent in London today.  “The appointment of DuCharme, who has been acting CEO
since July, shows that X5 didn’t have much of a choice,” said
Mikhail Terentiev, an analyst at Otkritie Capital in Moscow.
“Still, it’s mildly positive that X5 finally got a permanent
CEO after not having one for half a year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
