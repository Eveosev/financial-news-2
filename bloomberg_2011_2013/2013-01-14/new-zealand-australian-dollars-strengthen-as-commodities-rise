The New Zealand and Australian
dollars gained versus their U.S. counterpart as commodities rose
the most in more than a week.  New Zealand’s currency, nicknamed the kiwi, advanced versus
all 16 of its most-traded peers after the nation’s statistics
agency said the value of retail transactions on electronic cards
increased 0.3 percent in December, the third-straight monthly
advance. The Aussie dollar reached the highest level in more
than four years against the yen.  The kiwi added 0.8 percent to 84.32 U.S. cents yesterday in
New York and climbed 1.2 percent to 75.44 yen.  Australia ’s dollar appreciated 0.3 percent to $1.0567. It
gained 0.6 percent to 94.55 yen and touched 94.65, the highest
level since August 2008.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials rose
0.9 percent, the most on a closing basis since Jan. 2.  New Zealand’s dollar strengthened 2.3 percent over the past
year among the 10 developed-nation currencies monitored by the
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The Aussie fell 1.7
percent, and the U.S. dollar slid 4.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
