Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
strengthened to the narrowest in four weeks as smaller corn
supplies signaled higher costs.  The spread contracted 2.44 cents as ethanol extended its
longest streak of gains since July on signs of higher feedstock
prices. An Agriculture Department report on Jan. 11 showed corn
stockpiles in the U.S. on Dec. 1 totaled 8.03 billion bushels,
17 percent less than a year earlier.  “The corn market’s strong so ethanol’s trying to follow
along with it,” said Mike Blackford, a consultant at INTL
FCStone in  Des Moines ,  Iowa . “Ethanol’s got to stay with corn
to make sure the plants stay on.”  Ethanol was 42.41 cents a gallon below the price of
gasoline, based on prompt-month contracts for both commodities.
That was less than the 44.85 cents on Jan. 11 and the smallest
gap since Dec. 17.  Denatured ethanol for February delivery rose 3.9 cents, or
1.7 percent, to settle at $2.33 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of
Trade, the highest price since Dec. 11. Prices have advanced 9.9
percent in the past year.  Corn for March delivery advanced 15.25 cents, or 2.2
percent, to $7.24 a bushel in Chicago, the highest price since
Dec. 17. The futures have risen 21 percent in the past year.  Losing Money  Based on March contracts for corn and ethanol, producers
are losing 28 cents on each gallon of the fuel made, up from 27
cents on Jan. 11, according to data collected by Bloomberg. The
figures exclude the revenue that can be made from the sale of
dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol production that
can be fed to livestock.  In cash market trading, ethanol on the West Coast jumped 6
cents, or 2.5 percent, to $2.45 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf
the additive increased 6 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $2.385, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Ethanol in  New York  gained 3.5 cents, or 1.5 percent, to
$2.40 a gallon and in Chicago the biofuel rose 2.5 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $2.30.  Gasoline for February delivery increased 1.46 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $2.7541 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers gasoline that’s made to be blended
with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
