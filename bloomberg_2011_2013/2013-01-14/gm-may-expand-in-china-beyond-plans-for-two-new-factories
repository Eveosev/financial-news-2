General Motors Co. (GM) , the top-selling
foreign automaker in  China , said it’s looking at further
expansion in the country, beyond previously announced plans for
two new factories, even as the market slows.  “You need to stay ahead of the curve,” Bob Socia,
president of GM China, told reporters yesterday at the North
American International Auto Show in Detroit. “Are we ready to
announce another plant? No, but clearly we’re looking at what
we’re going to need to handle our expansion.”  GM opened two assembly plants in China last year, he said.
Shanghai GM, its joint venture with  SAIC Motor Corp. (600104) , began
construction of its fourth manufacturing base in Wuhan last
year, while SAIC-GM-Wuling announced plans for a third plant in
Chongqing.  Deliveries at GM and its Chinese joint ventures rose 11
percent to a record 2.84 million vehicles last year, the
Detroit-based automaker  said  on its website yesterday.
 Volkswagen AG (VOW) , which unlike GM includes Hong Kong in its China
tallies, said deliveries climbed 24.5 percent to 2.81 million.  China’s auto market may increase to 21 million this year
from 19.4 million in 2012, and GM aims to gain share, Socia
said. A consensus is forming that sales may rise to as many as
30 million vehicles by 2020, he said.  GM exported 77,000 vehicles from China last year, an
increase from about 3,000 in 2009, to about 15 different
markets, including in  South America  and Africa, Socia said. The
company expects exports could increase to 100,000 or more this
year, he said.  GM has said it plans to boost deliveries in China to 5
million by 2015 and will focus on expanding its luxury Cadillac
brand and sport-utility vehicle lineup. It may also sell the
seventh-generation Chevrolet Corvette in China, Chief Executive
Officer Dan Akerson said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
