German  Chancellor Angela Merkel 
rebuked the opposition Social Democrats for blocking a  tax
treaty  with Switzerland, saying that preserving the status quo
only serves to help Swiss banks.  Campaigning for her party in the state of Lower Saxony,
Merkel said it was a mistake for Germany not to join countries
such as the U.K., Austria and Greece in negotiating a tax treaty
with Switzerland. Had the pact been approved, it would have
taken effect at the beginning of this year.  “We could have had 14 days already during which there
would never again be  tax fraud  with Switzerland,” Merkel told a
crowd at an event for her  Christian Democratic Union  in the
western town of Stadthagen today. “And if you read the
newspaper, who in Switzerland is happy that it didn’t happen?
The banks -- the Swiss banks are happy.”  The Social Democrats last year blocked a treaty signed by
Merkel’s government with Switzerland that sought to fight  tax
evasion  by levying a withholding tax on Germans with Swiss
accounts, while preserving a measure of bank secrecy.  The SPD stopped the legislation in the upper house of
parliament, or Bundesrat, where Merkel lacks a majority, saying
that the treaty was a giveaway to tax dodgers.  “I can only say: this isn’t my policy,” Merkel said in
the speech ahead of the Lower Saxony state election on Jan. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
