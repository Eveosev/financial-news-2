The ruble traded six kopeks from its
strongest level in eight months versus the dollar as  Russia ’s
central bank said it had been continuing interventions to curb
gains in the currency.  The ruble added 0.2 percent to 30.2540 per dollar by 11:50
p.m. in Moscow, after closing at 30.1910 Jan. 10, the highest
level since May 11. The currency added less than 0.1 percent to
40.4450 per euro and strengthened 0.1 percent to 34.84 against
the central bank’s  dollar-euro basket , gaining for the first
time in four trading days.  Russia’s currency has rallied as oil, the country’s main
export, climbs on optimism the economies of  China  and the U.S.
are recovering. Crude is up 2.5 percent this year. Russia’s
central bank has bought 15.1 billion rubles ($499 million) of
foreign currency since 2013 trading started Jan. 8 to stem the
ruble’s advance after abstaining from interventions in December,
according to Bank Rossii data.  “The central bank is fighting the strengthening ruble as
oil prices climb,” Dmitry Dudkin, head of fixed-income analysis
at UralSib Financial Corp., said by phone from Moscow.  While Russia’s central bank is shifting toward targeting
inflation instead of the exchange rate to manage monetary
policy, the central bank will still intervene to curb volatility
that can hurt the competitiveness of the nation’s exporters,
First Deputy Chairman  Alexei Ulyukayev  said in October. The
regulator aims to move to inflation-targeting by 2015, according
to its annual monetary strategy report.  Bank Rossii purchased 5.15 billion rubles of currency for
settlement Jan. 11 compared with 4.83 billion rubles the day
before, it said today.  Rates Meeting  While the ruble’s trading hours were extended to 11:50 p.m.
last week, policy makers won’t buy and sell dollars and euros to
influence the currency’s movements beyond 7 p.m., according to a
Jan. 9 statement.  Bank Rossii wants to hold inflation between 5 percent to 6
percent this year and 4 percent to 5 percent in 2014. Price
growth quickened to 6.6 percent in December from a year earlier
after remaining at 6.5 percent in the previous two months.
Russian policy makers will probably leave interest rates
unchanged at a meeting in Moscow tomorrow, according to a
Bloomberg survey of economists.  Speculation that the ruble debt market will be opened this
year to direct settlement for foreigners via systems including
Euroclear Bank SA and Clearstream International SA have also
lifted demand for Russia’s currency, Ivan Sinelnikov, an analyst
for OAO Gazprombank said Jan. 11.  Yields on the country’s ruble-denominated government bonds,
known as OFZs, may fall 50 to 80 basis points in 2013,
Renaissance Capital Chief Economist  Ivan Tchakarov  wrote in an
e-mailed note.  Ruble bonds have returned 1.12 percent this year, compared
with 0.39 percent for  Brazil ’s debt, 1.36 percent for  India ’s
