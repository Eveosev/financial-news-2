A rally in the  Dollar Index 
represents a selling opportunity as the gauge is poised to break
out of a “drawn out consolidation,” according to Bank of
America Corp., citing technical patterns.  The index will increase to no higher than 80.87 before
resuming a downward trend to 78.41, based on Elliot Wave
analysis,  MacNeil Curry , head of foreign exchange and interest
rates technical strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in  New
York , wrote to clients. It may fall to as low as 76.43, he
wrote.  “I do think you should be selling the Dollar Index on a
bounce,” Curry said in an e-mail. “The reason it has taken
longer to fall than I previously thought is because the
consolidation has unfolded as a triangle, which is a pattern
that takes longer to unfold than many other types of
corrections/consolidations.”  The bounce shouldn’t exceed the Jan. 4 high of 80.87, Curry
wrote to clients.  The Dollar Index, which Intercontinental Exchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S.
trading partners, was little changed at 79.445 at 3:40 p.m. in
New York. The gauge is weighted 57.6 percent to movements in the
euro.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, index or currency. Elliott Wave theory, created by
Ralph Elliott in the 1930s, seeks to predict moves by dividing
past trends into five sections, or waves, and calculating
changes in value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
