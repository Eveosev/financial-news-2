Renova Energia SA (RNEW11) , the Brazilian
renewable-energy developer that built the largest wind farm in
Latin America, may sell bonds tied to infrastructure in  Brazil ’s
local markets as it seeks to finance 1.5 billion reais ($740
million) in new wind-power projects this year.  Renova has plans to build 400 megawatts to 500 megawatts
annually and expects to close on contracts for the free
electricity market by the end of 2013, said Pedro Pileggi, the
company’s director of investor relations.  The bonds are part of the government’s push to create a
debt market for infrastructure projects. They are designed to
attract foreign investors, and could help relieve “financing
bottlenecks,” Pileggi said in an interview today in Sao Paulo.  In addition, the bonds may offer long-term financing of 12
to 14 years, Pileggi said.  “This is what we are hoping for,” Pileggi said, adding
that the company has received the bulk of its financing from
Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Economico e Social, Brazil’s
national development bank. “BNDES will continue being extremely
important, but some kind of capital market instrument has to
continue for the entire sector to succeed.”  Renova’s shares have more than doubled since the company’s
initial public offering on July 13, 2010, compared with a 2.5
percent decline for the Bovespa benchmark index. Renova fell 1.2
percent to 31.63 reais today.  It has already contracted more than 1.1 gigawatts of wind
power on the Brazilian electricity market, of which 400
megawatts is being built for Renova shareholder  Light (LIGT3)  via the
free market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
