Gold gained for the second time in
three sessions amid speculation that the U.S. may continue with
stimulus measures, increasing demand for the precious metal as a
store of value. Platinum rose to the highest in 12 weeks.  Federal  Reserve Bank  of Chicago President  Charles Evans 
said the U.S. should keep policy accommodative to support the
economy. Gold slid to a four-month low on Jan. 4 after Fed
minutes indicated policy makers may end $85 billion in monthly
bond purchases sometime this year.  “Today’s comment is definitely supportive,”  Scott Gardner , the chief investment officer at Verdmont Capital SA in
Panama City, said in a telephone interview. “The Fed’s
statement earlier this month took a lot of sheen out of gold.”  Gold futures for February delivery climbed 0.5 percent to
settle at $1,669.40 an ounce at 1:36 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. Prices advanced 0.7 percent last week, the first gain in
seven.  Fed Bank of San Francisco President  John Williams  said
policymakers will probably need to keep buying assets “well
into” the second half of the year to combat unemployment that
will decline only gradually.  Silver futures for March delivery rose 2.3 percent to
$31.11 an ounce in New York.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
April delivery advanced 1.7 percent to $1,658.20 an ounce.
Earlier, prices touched $1,665, the highest for a most-active
contract since Oct. 18.  Palladium futures for March delivery added 0.3 percent to
$703.30 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
