A group led by  Overseas Union
Enterprise Ltd. (OUE)  extended a deadline for a S$13.1 billion ($10.7
billion) bid for  Fraser & Neave Ltd. (FNN)  to Jan. 21, the deadline
for final bids for the  Singapore  property and beverages company.  The OUE-led group on Nov. 15 made a S$9.08 per share bid
for F&N, topping an earlier S$8.88 a share offer from Thai
billionaire Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi. Both have until Jan. 21
for final offers under Singapore’s takeover rules, according to
F&N spokeswoman Elaine Lim.  Charoen agreed to buy a 22 percent stake in F&N in July,
setting off a fight for the company’s soft drink and property
assets and prompting the sale of its beer unit to  Heineken NV. (HEIA) 
F&N shares have traded above both offers in a sign that
investors expect the bidding war to escalate.  F&N fell 0.5 percent to close at S$9.68 in Singapore
trading today.  OUE extended its deadline to 5:30 p.m. on Jan. 21,
according to a stock exchange statement today. Charoen last week
extended his offer to Jan. 15.  OUE, a Singapore-based property company, has teamed with
 Kirin Holdings Co. (2503) ,  Japan ’s largest drinks maker, in its bid.
OUE would get the company’s property business and Kirin would
take the food and beverage unit.  Kirin has agreed to tender its 14.8 percent  stake  in F&N,
OUE has said. The Japanese brewer,  Asia ’s biggest beverage
maker, will offer S$2.7 billion for F&N’s food and beverage
business if OUE wins enough support to complete the takeover.  The Thai billionaire agreed to pay S$2.78 billion for an
initial 22 percent stake in F&N by acquiring the stock held by
Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. and its partners. He later
acquired more shares to take him near the threshold to make a
bid.  Charoen’s offer for F&N valued the rest of the company at
about S$8.9 billion on September 13, the day his TCC assets
offered S$8.88 a share for the 69.6 percent of F&N it didn’t
already control.  OUE Executive Chairman Stephen Riady is a son of Mochtar
Riady, who controls  Indonesia ’s Lippo Group, with businesses
ranging from real estate and financial services to food across
Asia.  OUE, which gets about 65 percent of its revenue from hotel
operations, is planning at least one investment a year in
Singapore to boost property holdings that include office towers,
luxury apartments and malls, Stephen Riady said in an interview
in August.  Heineken won control of F&N’s brewery unit, the maker of
Tiger beer, in a  deal  that closed in November.  To contact the reporters on this story:
