Controladora Comercial Mexicana SAB (COMERUBC) ,
a Mexican supermarket chain whose shares almost doubled last
year, fell for a second day on speculation the stock may be
expensive compared with competitors.  Shares of the Mexico City-based company fell 3.9 percent to
45.80 Mexican pesos at the close of trading in Mexico City, the
biggest drop in two months. It was the biggest contributor to
today’s 0.2 percent drop in the  Mexico IMC30 Index (IMC30)  of mid-cap
stocks. The shares reached a record 49.05 on Jan. 10.  Comercial Mexicana’s price is  35.6 times  the company’s
earnings over the most recent 12-month period, compared with a
ratio of 24.1 for competitor Organizacion Soriana SAB and 27 for
Grupo Comercial Chedraui SAB.  “In terms of valuation it’s quite expensive,” said Luis
Willard, an analyst at Grupo Bursatil Mexicano in Mexico City.
He rates the stock “market underperform.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
