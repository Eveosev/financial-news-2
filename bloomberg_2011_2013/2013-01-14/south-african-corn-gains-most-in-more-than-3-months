South African corn futures rose the
most in more than three months tracking prices in the U.S.,
which increased after the Department of Agriculture’s estimates
showed shrinking stockpiles. The U.S. is the world’s largest
producer of the grain.  White corn for March delivery, the most active contract,
surged 3.3 percent to 2,190 rand ($252) a metric ton, the most
since Oct. 2, by the midday close in Johannesburg. The yellow
variety for July delivery, climbed 3.4 percent to 2,104.20 rand
a ton.  Corn increased 2 percent to $7.23 a bushel on the Chicago
Board of Trade at 12:35 p.m. in London. Inventories of corn on
Dec. 1 were 8.03 billion bushels, 17 percent less than the 9.647
billion held a year earlier, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
said in a  report  on Jan. 11.  “U.S. prices increased a lot today after the release of
the USDA report last Friday,” Brink van Wyk, a trader at BVG
(Pty) Ltd., said by phone from  Pretoria .  South Africa  is the continent’s biggest corn producer, also
known as maize. White corn is a staple food, while yellow corn
is used as  animal feed .  Wheat for delivery in March, rose 2 percent to 3,545 rand a
ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
