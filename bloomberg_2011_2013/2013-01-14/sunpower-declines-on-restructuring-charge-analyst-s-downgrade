SunPower Corp. (SPWR) , the solar-panel
company majority-owned by Total SA, fell the most in a week
after an announcement of higher-than-anticipated restructuring
costs and a downgrade by Credit Agricole Securities.  SunPower fell 6 percent to $7.70 at the close in New York.
The shares had gained 10 percent in the last year through Jan.
11.  The solar company, based in San Jose, California, said
after the close of trading on Jan. 11 that it expected to record
a restructuring charge of $33 million to $40 million, higher
than a previously estimated $10 million to $17 million. The
“majority” of the charge will be recorded in the fourth
quarter, the company said in a filing.  While selling two solar projects to  Warren Buffett ’s
MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co. “adds to revenue visibility, we
still don’t see meaningful upside to our forecast,”  Mark
Heller , an analyst at Credit Agricole Securities in San
Francisco, wrote in a note to investors today. Heller downgraded
SunPower to sell from underperform.  To contact the reporter on this story:
