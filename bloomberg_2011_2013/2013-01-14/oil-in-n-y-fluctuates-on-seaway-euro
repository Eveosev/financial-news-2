Oil rose to the highest level in
almost four months as service began on the expanded Seaway
pipeline and heating oil jumped.  Futures advanced 0.6 percent after Seaway resumed service
to the  Gulf Coast  from Cushing,  Oklahoma , on Jan. 11. The line’s
increased capacity of 400,000 barrels a day may help ease a glut
at Cushing that has held down prices of West Texas Intermediate
crude. Heating oil climbed the most in nearly two months on
forecasts for cold weather in the East Coast and Midwest.  “Seaway is giving oil a boost,” said  Phil Flynn , senior
market analyst at the Price Futures Group in  Chicago . “We are
going to have some very cold weather and it’s increasing demand
expectations for heating oil.”  WTI oil for February delivery increased 58 cents to $94.14
a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest
settlement since Sept. 18. Prices have jumped 2.5 percent this
month. Prices accelerated gains in the last 15 minutes of floor
trading as U.S. equities pared losses. Trading volume was 12
percent above the 100-day average.  Brent for February settlement rose $1.24, or 1.1 percent,
to end the session at $111.88 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange. Volume was 5.5 percent more than the
100-day average.  The European benchmark contract was at a premium of $17.74
to WTI. It settled at $17.08 on Jan. 11, the narrowest gap based
on closing prices since Sept. 19.  Cushing Inventories  The 500-mile (805-kilometer) Seaway pipeline resumed full
service after shutting Jan. 2 to complete the final connections
necessary to boost the line’s capacity by 250,000 barrels from
150,000,  Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD)  and  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  said
on Jan. 11.  Seaway’s expansion may reduce record inventories of crude
at Cushing, the delivery point for U.S. benchmark WTI oil
futures. Cushing stockpiles climbed to 50.1 million barrels in
the week ended Jan. 4, the highest level in data going back to
2004 from the Energy Information Administration, the Energy
Department’s statistical arm.  “This is another milestone on the road to eventually
relieving the structural oversupply situation in the U.S.
Midcontinent,” said  Mike Wittner , the New York-based head of
commodities research at Societe Generale SA, in a note to
clients today.  WTI slid in 2012 as the U.S. shale boom deepened a glut at
Cushing, America’s biggest storage hub and the delivery point
for the New York contract. That left it at an average $17.48 a
barrel below Brent last year, versus a premium of about 95 cents
in the 10 years through 2010.  Seaway “should give WTI a boost,” said Tariq Zahir, a New
York-based commodity fund manager at Tyche Capital Advisors.  Heating Oil  Crude also advanced as heating oil jumped on forecasts for
cold weather on the U.S. East Coast and in the Midwest next
week. About 26 percent of households in the Northeast use
heating oil for heating, according to the EIA.  Computer models show that temperatures across the regions
will be 5 degrees Fahrenheit (2.8 Celsius) below normal from
Jan. 19 to Jan. 23, said  Matt Rogers , president of Commodity
Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland . The low in New York on
Jan. 22 may be 16 degrees Fahrenheit, 11 below normal, according
to AccuWeather Inc. in  State College ,  Pennsylvania .  Heating oil for February delivery climbed 5.40 cents, or
1.8 percent, to end at $3.0625 a gallon on the Nymex, the
biggest gain since Nov. 19.  S&P 500  Prices extended gains as the  Standard & Poor’s  500 Index
pared losses. The index was little changed after falling as much
as 0.4 percent earlier.  “Oil is following the equities,” said Bill Baruch, a
senior market strategist at Iitrader.com in Chicago. “Seaway
will help reduce the Cushing supply.”  Crude fell as much as 0.7 percent earlier as the  S&P 500 
dropped and on concern political disagreements over the nation’s
debt ceiling that may affect economic growth.  President  Barack Obama  warned Congress against using the
debt ceiling as leverage in the spending debate, saying
“markets could go haywire” and government payments, from
Social Security checks to military salaries, will be held up if
the limit isn’t raised.  Republican lawmakers “will not collect a ransom” if they
delay increasing federal borrowing authority, Obama said today
at a White House news conference.  “The oil market is a little nervous about the debt
ceiling, and people covered their positions,” Flynn said.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 497,274
contracts as of 3:30 p.m. Volume totaled 604,531 contracts on
Jan. 11, 25 percent above the three-month average. Open interest
was 1.50 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
