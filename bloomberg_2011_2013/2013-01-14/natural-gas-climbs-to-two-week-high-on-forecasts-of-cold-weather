Natural gas futures advanced to a
two-week high in New York on forecasts of colder-than-normal
weather that would spur demand for the heating fuel.  Gas climbed 1.4 percent after Commodity Weather Group LLC
in Bethesda,  Maryland , predicted below-average temperatures in
the eastern half of the U.S. from Jan. 19 through Jan. 23. The
low in New York on Jan. 22 may be 16 degrees Fahrenheit, 11
below normal, according to  AccuWeather Inc.  in State College,
 Pennsylvania .  “The cold weather is supposed to return and some of the
sellers are bailing out,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and
broker at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “The idea
is that this kind of cold will bring stronger withdrawals from
storage in the weeks to come.”  Natural gas for February delivery rose 4.6 to $3.373 per
million British thermal units on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, the highest settlement price since Dec. 28. Trading
volume was up 8.3 percent from the 100-day average at 2:37 p.m.
The futures have gained 26 percent from a year ago.  February $3.10 puts were the most active gas options in
electronic trading. They were 1.1 cents lower at 1.2 cents on
volume of 1,777 contracts as of 2:39 p.m. Puts accounted for 54
percent of options volume.  Net-long wagers on four U.S. natural gas contracts advanced
by 4,371 futures equivalents, or 7.8 percent, to 60,421 in the
week ended Jan. 8, according to data released Jan. 11 by the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission. It was the first increase
in six weeks.  Chicago Low  The low in  Chicago  on Jan. 22 may be 10 degrees Fahrenheit
(minus 12 Celsius), 8 lower than normal, according to
AccuWeather.  About 50 percent of U.S. households use gas for heating,
according to the Energy Information Administration, the
statistical arm of the Energy Department.  The number of rigs drilling for gas in the U.S. fell by 5
last week to 434, Baker Hughes Inc. in Houston said on Jan. 11.
The total was down 45 percent from a year earlier.  An EIA report Jan. 10 said inventories fell 201 billion
cubic feet in the seven days ended Jan. 4 to 3.316 trillion
cubic feet, the biggest weekly decline since February 2011.  A  surplus  to the five-year average fell to 10.7 percent
from 12.4 percent the previous week. Supplies were 2.6 percent
below year-earlier inventories, the widest deficit since
September 2011.  Price Outlook  The EIA increased its estimate for 2013 natural gas prices,
citing more normal winter heating demand compared with last
year. Gas prices at the benchmark Henry Hub in Erath,  Louisiana ,
will average $3.74 per million British thermal units, compared
with the previous estimate of $3.68 and $2.75 in 2012, the EIA
said Jan. 8 in its monthly  Short-Term Energy Outlook.   Consol Energy Inc. (CNX) , the third-largest U.S. coal miner by
sales, plans to sell assets for $127 million to $312 million in
2013 as it ramps up production of natural gas.  Asset sales will help finance 2013 capital spending of
$1.29 billion to $1.5 billion, most of it on gas production,
Consol, based in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, said today in a
statement. Gas output will rise as much as 15 percent above last
year’s production, equivalent to 156.3 billion cubic feet.  Natural gas output in the lower-48 states rose to an all-
time high in October as more of the fuel was pumped from shale
formations in the Northeast and North Dakota, the administration
said Jan. 7.  Production Report  Gross gas production increased 0.4 percent to 73.54 billion
cubic feet a day from a revised 73.22 billion in September, the
agency said in the monthly  EIA-914 report .  Supplies from the “other states” category rose 1.8
percent to 23.94 billion cubic feet a day from a revised 23.51
billion in September “as operators reported new wells coming
online in the Marcellus and Bakken shale plays,” the EIA said.  The boom in oil and natural gas production helped the U.S.
cut its reliance on imported fuel. America met 83 percent of its
energy needs in the first nine months of last year, government
data show. If the trend goes on through 2012, it will be the
highest level of self-sufficiency since 1991.  To contact the reporter on this story:
