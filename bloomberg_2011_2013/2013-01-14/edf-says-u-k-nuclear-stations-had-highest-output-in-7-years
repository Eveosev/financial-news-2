Electricite de France SA said its
nuclear power stations in the U.K. had their highest output in
seven years in 2012, producing enough electricity for half of
Britain’s homes.  EDF’s eight U.K. atomic stations generated 60 terawatt-
hours of electricity in 2012, almost 50 percent more than the
last year before the French company acquired the stations in
2009, it said today in an e-mailed station.  EDF attributed the improved performance to 300 million
pounds ($482 million) of annual investment in the stations, on
top of their yearly operational costs of 350 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
