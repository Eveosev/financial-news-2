The Australian dollar slid versus
most of its 16 major peers before a report this week that may
show an increase in unemployment, adding to signs of weakness in
the domestic economy.  Australia ’s currency fell against the dollar on prospects
employers in the South Pacific nation last month added the
 fewest jobs  since a decline in August. Both the so-called Aussie
and its  New Zealand  counterpart, known as the kiwi, tumbled from
the highest levels in more than four years versus the yen after
comments by Japan’s economy minister stoked speculation the
country won’t try to spur further losses in its currency.  “There is underlying weakness in the labor market,” said
 Andrew Salter , a currency strategist in Sydney at  Australia &
New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  “If we do a get a weaker
unemployment read, the market will look to take the Aussie
lower.”  The Australian dollar fell 0.2 percent to $1.0549 as of
4:45 p.m. in Sydney after rising 0.3 percent yesterday. It
touched 94.66 yen, the highest since August 2008, before trading
at 93.83, 0.8 percent below the close in  New York . New Zealand’s
currency, known as the kiwi, lost 0.3 percent to 84.05 U.S.
cents. It slid 0.9 percent to 74.75 yen after earlier reaching
75.53, the strongest since September 2008.  Jobless Rate  Australia’s  jobless rate  probably rose to 5.4 percent last
month from 5.2 percent in November, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey before the statistics bureau
releases the figures on Jan. 17. That would match the level
reached in September that was the highest since 2010.  Interest-rate swaps  data compiled by Bloomberg show traders
see a 45 percent chance RBA Governor  Glenn Stevens  will keep
borrowing costs unchanged at 3 percent by the bank’s March 5
rate decision. That’s up from 27 percent odds a month ago.
There’s an 84 percent probability the cash rate will fall to a
record 2.75 percent or lower by the July 2 meeting, according to
the figures.  The Australian dollar’s 14-day relative strength index
against the greenback was at 61 yesterday, near the 70 level
that some traders see as a sign an asset has risen too quickly
and may be set to reverse course.  “As the Aussie is approaching the $1.06 level, you might
anticipate the currency to find some resistance,” said Greg Gibbs, a Singapore-based senior currency strategist at Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc. The Aussie climbed to as high as
$1.0599 on Jan. 11, matching the strongest level since Sept. 14.  The kiwi earlier climbed versus the yen after a report by
the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research Inc. showed today
that a net  20 percent  of 767 companies surveyed last quarter
said they expect the economy to improve in the next six months,
the most since the three months through September 2011.  Australia’s 10-year bond yield was at 3.44 percent from
3.46 percent yesterday. New Zealand’s two-year swap rate, a
fixed payment made to receive floating rates which is sensitive
to interest-rate expectations, was unchanged at 2.82 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
