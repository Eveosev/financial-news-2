Canadian  stocks  swung between gains
and losses as acquisition targets  Aurizon Mines (ARZ)  Ltd. and  Uranium
One Inc. (UUU)  rallied while energy producers declined as oil fell for
a second day.  Aurizon Mines soared 35 percent, the most in more than six
years, as Alamos Gold Inc. offered C$780 million for the
company. Alamos sank 9.3 percent. Uranium One jumped 15 percent
as Russian state-owned JSC Atomredmetzoloto planned to buy the
rest of the company it doesn’t already own for C$1.3 billion.
Research In Motion Ltd. surged 11 percent amid signs demand for
rival Apple Inc.’s iPhone 5 is slipping.  Tahoe Resources Inc. (THO) 
slid 7.2 percent after an attack at its silver mine.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  was little
changed at 12,600.68 at 11:53 a.m. in Toronto. The benchmark
gauge has gained 1.3 percent this year.  “It’s a a bit of a quiet start to the week; some of it is
nervousness after the strong start to the year,”  Greg Taylor ,
 fund manager  with Aurion Capital Management, said on the phone
from Toronto. His firm manages about C$8 billion ($8.12
billion). “The Alamos-Aurizon deal has people scratching their
heads as there aren’t a lot of synergies. It’s strange why
they’re making that acquisition. It seems RIM goes up when Apple
goes down, and it probably isn’t any more complicated than
that.”  Raw-material and information technology companies
 contributed  most to gains in the S&P/TSX as five of 10
industries advanced. Trading volume is 128 percent higher than
the 30-day average at this time of the day.  Aurizon, Uranium One  Aurizon Mines jumped 35 percent to C$4.60, headed for its

 Mexico , offered to buy the company for either C$4.65 or 0.2801
of an Alamos share for each Aurizon share. If successful, the
bid would give Alamos Gold access to projects in the Abitibi
region of northwestern  Quebec .  Alamos, which already owns a 16 percent stake in Aurizon,
plunged 9.3 percent to C$15.34.  Uranium One soared 15 percent to C$2.78, the biggest
intraday gain in nine weeks. Russia’s ARMZ, together with other
units, owns 51.4 percent of Uranium One. The C$1.3 billion
($1.32 billion) offer is a 32 percent premium to the company’s
20-day weighted average price in Toronto, the company said.  RIM, which is set to debut its BlackBerry 10 line of
smartphones on Jan. 30, climbed 11 percent to C$14.72. A report
in Japan’s Nikkei newspaper today said Apple has reduced its
orders for iPhone 5 screens this quarter by about half from its
original target of 65 million displays. Apple fell 2.8 percent
to $505.95 in New York, headed for its lowest closing level
since February 2012.  Harry Winston  Harry Winston  Diamond Corp. gained 3.9 percent to C$14.81,
