The euro, which has advanced more
than 4 percent against the yen this year, may “struggle” as it
approaches 121.94, Credit Suisse Group AG said, citing trading
patterns.  The so-called resistance level represents the 61.8 percent
Fibonacci retracement from the June 2009 high to the July 2012
low, the bank said in a research note published today.  Credit Suisse’s euro target for 121.94 yen “is now within
striking distance,” said strategists including London-based
 David Sneddon . “We envisage the market continuing higher
towards this hurdle, but would expect the price to struggle once
up there.”  If the euro does fall back, it will find support, or an
area on a price graph where buy orders may be grouped, at
114.28, Credit Suisse said.  The euro rose 0.3 percent to 119.32 yen at 4:45 p.m. London
time, after rising to 120.13, the highest level since May 4,
2011.  Fibonacci analysis  is based on the theory that securities
tend to rise or fall by specific percentages after reaching a
high or low. Resistance is an area on a price graph where
technical analysts anticipate sell orders to be clustered.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a bond,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
