Lear Corp. (LEA) , the auto-parts maker
that emerged from bankruptcy in 2009, is seeking to double a
revolving credit line to $1 billion.  Proceeds of the revolver and a planned $500 million bond
sale will be used for corporate purposes, including redemption
of $70 million of notes, the company said today in a regulatory
filing.  The actions “further improve our capital structure,
increase our financial flexibility and allow us to continue to
invest in growing and strengthening our business,” Matt Simoncini, Lear’s chief executive officer, said in the filing.  The Southfield, Michigan-based company’s existing revolving
credit, which is due to expire in June 2016, had no borrowings
outstanding as of Sept. 29, Lear said in an Oct. 26 regulatory
filing. Lear pays interest on drawn portions of the line of
credit of between 1.375 percentage points more than the London
interbank offered rate and 3 percent more than Libor, depending
upon ratings, according to the filing. As of Sept. 29, the debt
paid 2.25 percentage points.  Libor is a rate banks say they can borrow in dollars from
each other. In a revolving line of credit, money may be borrowed
again once it’s repaid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
