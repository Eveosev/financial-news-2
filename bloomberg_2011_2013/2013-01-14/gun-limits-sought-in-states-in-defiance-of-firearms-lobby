Democratic governors and lawmakers in at least 10 U.S. states are seeking new restrictions on guns and ammunition after last month’s school shooting in  Connecticut , challenging the firearms lobby’s political clout.  New York Governor  Andrew Cuomo , a Democrat, last week called for making his state’s gun laws the toughest in the nation with restrictions that include a ban on sales of high- capacity ammunition magazines and a vote may come as soon as today. Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper, also a Democrat, wants background checks on private gun sales.  The proposals mark a shift from previous years, when debate focused on expanding residents’ right to carry guns, including at colleges or in public buildings. The Dec. 14 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, which killed 20 children and 6 adults, is fueling calls for action.  “The main thrust has been on expanding gun rights, not a retraction,” said Richard Feldman, president of the Independent Firearm Owners Association, a Rindge, New Hampshire-based group that opposes restrictions on gun owners. “This is the most intense discussion of the gun issue in my lifetime.”  Biden Plan  Vice President  Joe Biden  said last week there’s a growing agreement on the need for background checks on all types of gun sales and a ban on high-capacity magazines. President  Barack Obama  said today he received recommendations from Biden for legislative and executive actions to stop gun violence as part of the administration’s response to the Connecticut shooting.  The  National Rifle Association , the nation’s largest gun- rights group with 4 million members, said last week the Obama administration is moving to “attack the Second Amendment,” which protects the rights of Americans to bear arms. The Fairfax, Virginia-based group’s opposition poses an obstacle in the U.S. House, which is controlled by Republicans, who more often side with gun-rights advocates than Democrats.  Other states in which governors or lawmakers are calling for new restrictions include Arizona,  California , Connecticut, Delaware,  Florida ,  Illinois , Maryland and  Oregon .  More proposals may emerge as legislative sessions in many states begin in coming weeks. In a recent letter to supporters, the NRA said state lawmakers “will soon be voting on dozens of new bills to impose greater restrictions on your right to own and use firearms.” Andrew Arulanandam, a spokesman for the group, didn’t respond to a telephone message seeking comment on the proposals.  Cerberus Capital  Cerberus Capital Management LP, the New York-based owner of Freedom Group Inc., the largest U.S. gunmaker, said last month that it isn’t taking a position on gun-control debates and is moving to sell the company.  Peter Duda , a spokesman for Cerberus at  Weber Shandwick , a public relations firm, declined to comment further.  Republicans control a majority of governorships and state legislatures. Gun-control measures will be more difficult to pass in those states, said Andy Pelosi, the executive director of States United to Prevent Gun Violence, a New York-based firearms-control group.  “We’re going to have to fight a very uphill battle, whether it’s in  Washington  or state legislatures,” he said.  Maryland Governor  Martin O’Malley , a Democrat, said today that he plans to propose limits on assault weapons and high- capacity magazines, as well as tougher licensing requirements for handguns. He predicted the measures will win approval.  ‘No Sense’  “We know that it makes absolutely no sense, when you look at the level of carnage on our streets from guns, to blame everything but guns,” he said in a speech at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of  Public Health  in Baltimore at the start of an academic conference on gun violence.  New York’s Cuomo produced the most sweeping proposal. In  Albany  on Jan. 9, he said he wants to close loopholes in the state’s assault weapon ban, forbid large-capacity magazines and allow the state to revoke gun licenses and confiscate weapons.  Cuomo and lawmakers are close to a deal that would expand the assault-weapon ban and reduce the number of rounds allowed in a magazine to seven from 10, said Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat. The legislature may vote on it as soon as today, he said.  Colorado’s governor called for background checks on all gun sales, not just those purchased at retail stores or at gun shows. In Arizona, a Democratic state senator is seeking to force the same step.  Governor Opposed  “The governor generally opposes efforts that would infringe on the rights of lawful gun owners,” said Matthew Benson, a spokesman for Arizona Republican Governor  Jan Brewer .  In California, a Democratic state senator proposed requiring permits and background checks to buy ammunition. In Florida, a state House Democrat’s bill would allow for limits on carrying concealed weapons and ammunition on public property.  Delaware Governor Jack Markell today joined other Democrats in calling for bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and background checks for all gun sales. He also proposed bans on guns near schools and requiring residents to report when guns are lost or stolen.  In Oregon, Democratic Governor John Kitzhaber is awaiting recommendations of his staff and favors banning assault weapons, said Tim Raphael, a spokesman.  “The governor really sees no reasons for citizens to own assault weapons,” Raphael said.  In Illinois, Governor  Pat Quinn , a Democrat, supports a ban on assault weapons, said a spokeswoman, Brooke Anderson. A similar measure failed to advance in the legislature last year after opposition from gun groups, including the NRA.  ‘Tough Fight’  Richard Pearson, executive director of the Illinois State Rifle Association, which opposed the bill, said he’s poised for a fight when it’s revived in the legislature this year.  “It’s going to be a long and tough fight,” he said.  Since the Connecticut shooting, many state Republican leaders have responded by calling for improvements in mental- health programs and school safety, not curbs on guns.  Louisiana Republican Governor  Bobby Jindal  ordered a commission to scrutinize safety in schools. In  South Carolina , a Republican lawmaker is seeking to allow teachers to carry concealed weapons into school. In Texas, Lieutenant Governor David Dewhurst, also a Republican, said he’s in favor of funding firearms training for school teachers or administrators.  In Ohio, the week after the Connecticut shooting, Republican Governor  John Kasich  signed a law allowing concealed weapons in state-owned parking garages. He said the response shouldn’t be to erode gun owners’ rights and instead moved to spend $5 million to help families deal with mental illness.  “We can’t do everything and this isn’t going to solve everything, but it’s at least I think a good start,” he told reporters this month.
