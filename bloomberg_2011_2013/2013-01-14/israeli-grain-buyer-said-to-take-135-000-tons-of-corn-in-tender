Sherutei Bar Grains Import Ltd., an
Israeli importer, bought 135,000 metric tons of corn from
Ukraine and  South America  and 30,000 tons of feed wheat,
according to two traders with direct knowledge of the tender.  The company bought three 45,000-ton cargoes of corn on
behalf of its customers for delivery from March to May depending
on the origin, in the tender that closed Jan. 10, said the
traders who asked not to be identified because the results
havenâ€™t been publicly announced.  Gavilon sold two cargoes of Ukrainian and optional origin
corn at $302 and $307 a ton, respectively, including cost and
freight, the traders said. Noble sold South American corn at a
premium of $79.75 a ton over the May Chicago Board of Trade
contract, they said. Sherutei also bought 30,000 tons of South
American feed wheat from Nidera at $324 a ton, they said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
