The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined from near a five-year high as  Apple (AAPL)  Inc.’s slump amid concern about iPhone sales offset a rally in Dell Inc.  Apple, the most valuable company, sank 3.6 percent on reports it curbed iPhone production on weak demand. Sprint Nextel Corp. dropped 3.9 percent after the wireless carrier was cut at JPMorgan Chase & Co. Dell surged 13 percent as two people with knowledge of the matter said the company is in buyout talks with private-equity firms.  Hewlett Packard Co. (HPQ)  rose 4.9 percent as market researcher Gartner Inc. said it retook the spot as the top personal-computer maker from Lenovo Group Ltd.  The  S&P 500 (SPX)  retreated 0.1 percent to 1,470.68 at 4 p.m.  New York  time. The benchmark gauge for U.S. equities trimmed a decline of as much as 0.4 percent amid Dell’s rally. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  advanced 18.89 points, or 0.1 percent, to 13,507.32. About  5.6 billion  shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, or 8.1 percent below the three-month average.  “As Apple goes, so goes the market,”  Frank Ingarra , who helps manage $1.4 billion at Greenwich, Connecticut-based NorthCoast Asset Management LLC, said in a phone interview. “The problem you run into is that eventually they run out of people to sell stuff to. There’s just not enough people in the world to keep buying all these Apple products. It makes sense that it’s pulling back, and it makes sense that its effecting the market because it’s such a large weight.”  Almost 80 percent of the 28 S&P 500 companies which reported quarterly results beat analysts forecasts. Fourth-quarter profits at S&P 500 companies grew 2.5 percent, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That would be the second-slowest quarterly growth since 2009, the data show.

The Cupertino, California-based company reduced its original target to order 65 million iPhone 5 displays this quarter by about half, Nikkei said, citing an unidentified senior executive at a component maker it didn’t name.

Dell Surges  Dell surged 13 percent, the most since October 2008, to $12.29.  Round Rock , Texas-based Dell is discussing going private with at least two firms, said one of the people, who declined to be identified because the talks are private. The discussions are preliminary and could fall apart because the firms may not be able to line up the needed financing or resolve how to exit the investment in the future, the people said.  “There’s nothing like a good rumor to get the market going in the absence of macro news,” Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at the private-banking unit of KeyCorp in  Cleveland , said in a phone interview. His firm oversees $20 billion. “We’ve had a pretty decent 2012 in stocks and a good start to this year and people are watching the earnings season.”  Hewlett Packard  Hewlett Packard added 4.9 percent to $16.95. While Lenovo’s sales growth of 8.2 percent from a year earlier was the fastest of the top five  computer makers , Hewlett Packard’s dominance in professional PCs helped it retake the lead from Lenovo, market researcher Gartner said in a report today. Hewlett-Packard shipped 16.2 percent of PCs last quarter compared with 15.5 percent a year earlier.  Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO)  gained 2.4 percent to $20.97.

Volatility will deter investors from moving into  stocks  from bonds in 2013 even as dividend returns exceed fixed-income yields, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s U.S. equity strategist.  ‘Drawdown Risk’  “It’s the drawdown risk that is inhibiting investors from reducing bond holdings and increasing equity holdings,”  David Kostin  said at a presentation in London today. “You need to have more stable markets. I do not anticipate flows into equities from bonds. It should happen; it won’t happen this year.”  The forecast is at odds with Goldman Sachs Asset Management Chairman  Jim O’Neill ’s comment this year that funds may see a “great rotation” into equities. Investor deposits into global equity mutual funds in the first week of January were higher than any other period except one, a sign they may be returning to stocks after withdrawing cash for the past six years, according to data from EPFR Global.  The S&P 500 ended last year with a dividend yield that was 56 basis points, or 0.56 percentage points, higher than the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury, according to Bloomberg data.
