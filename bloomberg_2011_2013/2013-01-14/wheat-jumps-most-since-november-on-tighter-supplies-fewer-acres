Wheat surged the most since November
on mounting concern that  inventories  and winter-grain planting
fell short of analyst forecasts in the U.S., the world’s largest
exporter.  Stockpiles on May 31 will total 716 million bushels, down 5
percent from a December forecast and the 741 million estimate by
analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News , the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said on Jan. 11. Growers  planted  41.819 million
acres with winter varieties from September through November,
less than the 42.585 million expected by analysts, USDA data
show. Prices are up 3.2 percent in two sessions.  “We have historically tight supply,” Frank J. Cholly, a
senior commodities broker at RJO Futures in Chicago, said by
telephone. “The grain markets do a good job of alerting end-
users and producers when there’s short supply. The price goes
up, which rations demand.”  Wheat futures for March delivery gained 1.6 percent to
settle at $7.67 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the biggest jump since Nov. 27. The price rose 19 percent
last year, the largest increase among 24 commodities tracked by
the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index.  In the U.S., wheat is the fourth-largest crop, valued at
$14.4 billion in 2011, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government
data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
