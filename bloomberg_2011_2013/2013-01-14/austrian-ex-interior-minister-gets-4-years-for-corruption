Austria ’s former Interior Minister
was sentenced to four years prison after a jury today found him
guilty of corruption and influence peddling, according to a
spokeswoman from Vienna’s criminal court.  Ernst Strasser, who resigned his post as an Austrian member
of the European Parliament in March 2011, has a month to appeal
the verdict, Christina Salzborn, a court spokeswoman, said in a
phone interview.  Journalists from  London ’s Sunday Times in March 2011
published a film of  Strasser , then a member of Austria’s ruling
 People’s Party , offering to influence European legislation in
exchange for a 100,000-euro ($133,650) fee. Strasser argued in
court that he suspected that the reporters, Claire Newell and
Jonathan Calvert, were spies and that he wanted to expose them,
the Austrian Press Agency reported.  Strasser’s lawyer Thomas Kralik didn’t immediately return a
phone call seeking comment.  Austria was criticized by the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development for lax bribery investigations and
bank rules in a report released earlier this month. The country
hadn’t convicted one of its citizens of foreign bribery since
ratifying the Anti-Bribery Convention in 1999, the OECD said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
