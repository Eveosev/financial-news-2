After running a marathon,  Unilever (UNA)  Chief Executive Officer Paul Polman revives himself with his company’s Slim-Fast bars. Today it’s Slim-Fast that’s in need of revival.  Polman, who has re-energized Unilever’s Dove personal care and Magnum ice cream brands since he arrived in 2009, has done little for Slim-Fast, the one-time leader in the $13 billion weight-management sector. That has allowed products such as  Kellogg Co.’s (K)  Special K to fill the void.  Over the past four years, Slim-Fast’s sales in the U.S., its biggest market, have declined 40 percent, to $196 million, according to data trackers SymphonyIRI. During the same period, waistlines have expanded and the global meal-replacement category has grown 27 percent, researcher Euromonitor reports.  Is Slim-Fast “a forgotten brand? It certainly seems that way,” said  Lee Linthicum , an analyst at Euromonitor. “Kellogg did really well to launch their own products just when Slim-Fast had troubles.”  The biggest U.S. cereal maker has expanded its brand into a bona fide diet  plan  that mirrors Slim-Fast, encouraging dieters to swap two meals a day with Special K cereal and bars. Kellogg has added a stable of products including water and flatbread breakfast sandwiches to support the brand, which has contributed to a 22 percent average annual sales increase over the past five years, according to the company.  Crash Diet  “The quick crash diet is a thing of the past,” said Mark Baynes, Kellogg’s chief marketing officer. “People are happy to be seen eating Special K. People might not be so happy to be seen walking around with Slim-Fast.”  Unilever, which no longer breaks out Slim-Fast’s results, has seen sales growth at its refreshment business -- where Slim- Fast is housed -- fall behind the company as a whole. The brand now represents less than 1 percent of the company’s annual sales of about 50 billion euros ($67 billion). Slim-Fast has pulled out of  France , and innovation has slowed. The brand introduced seven new items last year, versus 77 in 2005, according to market researcher Mintel.  Nowadays, dieters such as Melissa Wood, a 42-year-old marketing executive in Marlow,  England , seek lasting remedies rather than Slim-Fast’s plan-in-a-can approach. Even the word “diet” has become passe, Mintel has found, as consumers shift their focus from just  weight loss  toward lifestyle changes that include eating fewer processed foods, exercising more, and getting more sleep.  ’Fake Flavoring’  “I see Slim-Fast as a down-market product,” said Wood, who has been on the diet twice. “It’s a quick fix and not the right thing for me. The fake flavoring and sugar are not part of healthy living in the 21st century.”  Slim-Fast has also missed out as diets go digital. Research firm Research2guidance has  estimated  that 500 million people will be using health-related smartphone apps by 2015, and diet apps are among the most downloaded.  Despite pleas from its users on Slim-Fast’s own message boards, Slim-Fast still has no smartphone app. In a survey published this month in  Consumer Reports  magazine, Slim-Fast ranked last in overall satisfaction among do-it-yourself diet plans, behind MyFitnessPal, the Paleo Diet, the Mediterranean Diet, and low-carb diets like Atkins.  In an e-mailed statement, Slim-Fast said it’s planning “exciting changes” and promised investments needed to bring the brand up to date.  Unilever rose 0.8 percent to 28.81 euros a share at 12:35 p.m. in Amsterdam trading.  Lasorda’s Weight  Created in 1977 by  New York  native S. Daniel Abraham, Slim- Fast powder -- mixed with low-fat milk -- was designed to replace breakfast and lunch, complemented by a 600-calorie “sensible” dinner. Sales took off in 1988 when Los Angeles Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda signed on as its spokesman. Dieters connected to Lasorda, seeing in him a man not afraid to admit he had a weight problem, according to a 2001  study  from Texas A&M University professors.  Through the 1990s, Slim-Fast fended off rivals by lowering the prices it charged to retailers, introducing new items like frozen entrees, and airing ubiquitous television ads that promised “give us a week, we’ll take off the weight!” Sales grew about 20 percent a year, hitting $611 million in 1999, with profits of $125 million.  The success attracted Unilever, which bought Slim-Fast for $2.4 billion in 2000. The company, based in  London  and Rotterdam, was eager to expand the brand outside  North America , which comprised over 90 percent of Slim-Fast’s sales at the time. By plugging Slim-Fast into its global marketing and distribution system, Unilever said it could increase revenue fivefold by 2003.  South Beach  That didn’t happen as the emergence of low-carb diets like Atkins and  South Beach  caught Unilever by surprise. After climbing to more than 1 billion euros in 2002, Slim-Fast sales plummeted 21 percent in 2003. In response, Unilever took about half of the sugar out of the product and rebranded it as Slim- Fast Optima, offering discounts to keep dieters from defecting. The damage was done, though, and in 2005 Unilever took two charges totaling 850 million euros to account for the decline in the value of the brand.  Things didn’t get any better from there. In December 2009, Unilever voluntarily recalled all cans of ready-to-drink Slim- Fast products in the U.S. over concerns they may have been contaminated with bacteria that could cause food poisoning.  Orphan Brands  CEO Polman doesn’t say much about Slim-Fast these days, choosing to focus on the growth of brands like TRESemme shampoo and Magnum in  emerging markets . He said in a December interview that he would look to get rid of “orphan” food brands, and the company on Jan. 3 said it will sell Skippy peanut butter to  Hormel Foods Corp. (HRL)  for $700 million. Given the 2005 writedowns and shrinking sales since, the Slim-Fast business today is worth a fraction of what Unilever paid for it, according to Sanford C. Bernstein analyst  Andrew Wood .  “Perhaps they are just letting it die quietly,” Wood said.  If Polman does decide to sell Slim-Fast, suitors might include England’s  Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc. (RB/) , which bought supplement maker Schiff Nutrition for $1.4 billion last year. Or he could sit down with Abraham, Slim-Fast’s founder, who says he has offered to help “revitalize” the brand.  “Unilever is sleeping on it,” Abraham said while driving in  Palm Beach ,  Florida . “If I still owned it, it would not be that way. I would be fighting harder. It’s a damn shame.”  To contact the reporter on this story: Matthew Boyle in London at  mboyle20@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: Celeste Perri at  cperri@bloomberg.net
