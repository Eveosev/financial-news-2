BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , the world’s largest
asset manager, hired Hsueh-ming Wang, a former  Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS)  executive, to head its China operations as it seeks
to expand in Asia.  Wang, who had been an advisory director at Goldman Sachs
and chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management in China, will be
chairman of BlackRock China, responsible for developing and
executing the firm’s business strategy there, Bobbie Collins, a
spokeswoman for the New York-based firm, said today in an e-
mail. Wang will report to  Mark McCombe , chairman of BlackRock’s
Asia-Pacific operations.  Laurence D. Fink, chairman and chief executive officer of
BlackRock, said during a conference call with analysts and
investors in 2011 that the firm is interested in expanding in
Asia and investor deposits there are “slower than we would
like.” Fink hired McCombe in 2011 and last year hired Philipp
Hildebrand, the former head of the Swiss central bank, to help
expand relationships with institutional clients overseas.  Wang left Goldman in 2011, Edward Naylor, a spokesman for
the firm in Hong Kong, said in an e-mail.  The Financial Times reported Wang’s appointment earlier
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
