Soybeans rose the most in more than
six months on signs that U.S. supplies are tightening amid
higher demand from feed producers and overseas buyers. Corn
reached a one-month high.  Soybean  inventories  on Dec. 1 fell 17 percent from a year
earlier to 1.966 billion bushels, the lowest in nine years, the
 U.S. Department of Agriculture  said Jan. 11. Exporters sold
120,000 tons to  China , the world’s biggest consumer, the USDA
said today. The department increased its forecast for U.S. meat
and poultry output by 1.4 percent last week from a December
projection. The oilseed is used in livestock feed.  “Soybean prices are reacting to the tightening U.S. supply
story,” Greg Grow, the director of agribusiness for Archer
Financial Services Inc. in Chicago, said in a telephone
interview. “The report last week has encouraged livestock and
poultry producers to increase purchases out into the start of
the U.S. planting season.”  Soybean futures for March delivery jumped 3.3 percent to
close at $14.18 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the  Chicago  Board of
Trade, capping the biggest gain since July 5. The price is down
21 percent from a record $17.89 on Sept. 4 as rains boosted
South American crops.  Brazil  may collect a record 82.5 million tons in 2013,
topping the U.S. as the biggest shipper and producer for the
first time, the USDA said Jan. 11. Brazilian forecaster Celeres
said today that exports this year will rise to 36.8 million
tons, up 12 percent from a year earlier and above the USDA
forecast for U.S. shipments of 36.61 million.  Corn Climbs  Corn futures for March delivery gained 2.2 percent to $7.24
a bushel in Chicago after touching $7.2675, the highest since
Dec. 17. The grain rose for a sixth straight session, the
longest rally since Feb. 29.  Stockpiles in the U.S, the biggest producer and exporter,
on Dec. 1 were 8.03 billion bushels, 17 percent less than a year
earlier, the USDA said last week. World  inventories  on Aug. 31
may fall 12 percent to 115.99 million metric tons, the smallest
as a percent of use since 1974, USDA data show.  In the U.S., corn is the biggest crop, valued at $76.5
billion in 2011, followed by soybeans at $35.8 billion,
government figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
