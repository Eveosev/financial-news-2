China National Biotec Group , China’s
largest biotechnology company, is planning an initial public
offering to raise about $1.5 billion in  Hong Kong , said two
people with knowledge of the matter.  The unit of  Sinopharm Group Co. (1099)  may file an application to
Hong Kong’s stock exchange by the end of March and start the
offering as early as in the second quarter, said the people, who
asked not to be identified because the information is private.
Sinopharm is China’s biggest pharmaceutical distributor by
market value.  China International Capital Corp., Morgan Stanley and UBS
AG will manage the offering, the people said. An external
spokeswoman for National Biotec declined to comment on the plan.  National Biotec , based in Beijing, is the fourth-biggest
vaccine maker in the world, according to its website. It has
about 8.6 billion yuan ($1.4 billion) of assets and annual sales
of more than 5 billion  yuan , the website shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
