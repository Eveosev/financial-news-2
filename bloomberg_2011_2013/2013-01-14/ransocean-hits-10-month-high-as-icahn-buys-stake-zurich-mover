Transocean Ltd. (RIG) , the world’s largest
offshore rig operator, climbed to the highest in 10 months after
billionaire investor  Carl Icahn  said he’s acquired a 1.56
percent stake and is seeking more.  The company, based in Vernier,  Switzerland ,  rose  as much as
3.1 percent to 50.9 francs, the highest since March 27, and
traded up 2.8 percent at 50.6 francs as of 10 a.m. local time.  Transocean said Icahn notified the company that he’s
seeking regulatory approval to potentially acquire shares worth
more than $682.1 million, according to  a statement  put on its
website yesterday. Transocean said Jan. 3 it agreed to pay $1.4
billion in penalties for its role in the worst U.S. maritime oil
spill in the  Gulf of Mexico  in 2010. Transocean shares lost more
than half their value in the months following the accident and
remain about 40 percent below their pre-spill price.  “The occurrence of the famous billionaire activist
investor Icahn is likely to be a game changer for the firm,”
said Michael Romer, an equity analyst at Bank Sarasin & Cie AG
in Basel, in an e-mailed note. We expect Icahn “to put
management under pressure.”  Icahn is known for buying stakes in companies he considers
to be under-performing and pushing for change. Last year he
acquired large stakes and drove for new board members at energy
companies  Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK) , an Oklahoma City-based
natural gas producer, and  CVR Energy Inc. (CVI) , a  Sugar Land , Texas-
based oil refiner.  Top Shareholder  Icahn’s planned additional purchase of Transocean shares
would amount to at least 3.4 percent of the company based on the
Jan. 11 closing share price of $54.09, and would make Icahn one
of the top two shareholders.  Capital Group Companies Inc. is the largest shareholder
with a 4.92 percent stake worth $995.7 million and  Franklin
Resources (BEN)  is second with $524.6 million of shares, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Since the 2010 disaster, the company has continued to
dominate the Gulf of Mexico’s deep-water drilling market.
Fourteen of the 37 rigs actively drilling in Gulf water depths
of at least 1,000 feet (305 meters) are owned by Transocean,
more than any other operator, according to Dice Holdings Inc.’s
Rigzone, which tracks global offshore rig data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
