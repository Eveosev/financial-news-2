Tecnisa SA (TCSA3) , a Brazilian homebuilder,
fell the most in two months after reporting that sales fell 43
percent in the fourth quarter.  Shares slid 3.9 percent to 7.72 reais at the close of
trading in Sao Paulo, the steepest one-day decline since Nov.
14. It was the worst performance on the BM&FBovespa Real Estate
index, which rose 0.6 percent.  Sales fell to 230 million reais ($113.2 million) in the
three months through December 2012, from 403.7 million reais in
the same period one year earlier, Sao Paulo-based Tecnisa said
in a Jan. 11 regulatory filing. The decline was partially
explained by the start during the quarter of The Five, a hotel,
shopping, residential and commercial complex that will account
for 290 million reais of sales when completed, Tecnisa said.  “The numbers were weak,” David Lawant, Enrico Trotta and
Vivian Salomon, analysts at the investment bank Itau BBA, wrote
in a note to clients dated yesterday. “Although we still see
the stock as an interesting way to play the Brazilian real
estate story, we are maintaining a more conservative stance on
the name.” Itau has the equivalent of a hold recommendation on
the stock.  Tecnisa’s sales totaled 1.1 billion reais in 2012. That
compares with Itau’s estimate of 1.5 billion reais, according to
yesterday’s report.  Tecnisa declined 20 percent in 2012, while the real estate
index gained 22 percent during that period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
