Company bond  sales  worldwide reached
at least $126 billion last week in the busiest period ever as
borrowing costs hovered close to record lows.  Bank of America Corp. , the second-biggest U.S. lender by
assets, raised $6 billion and Torino, Italy-based  Intesa
Sanpaolo SpA (ISP)  issued $3.5 billion as they led borrowers in the
most active week since  $124.3 billion  in the five days ended
Sept. 14, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales
increased from $27.9 billion the previous week and compare with
a 2012 weekly average of $76 billion.  Sales rose following a banner year in 2012, when offerings
reached an unprecedented  $3.95 trillion , as issuers rushed to
lock in rates that touched a record-low 3.243 percent on Dec.
28. Investors are opening the year eager to invest cash in
corporate bonds, according to Jody Lurie at Janney Montgomery
Scott LLC.  “There’s a mentality of, ’Let’s buy up again,”’ Lurie, a
Philadelphia-based corporate credit analyst, said in a telephone
interview. “With the start of the year, they’re starting to
spend again.”  The extra yield investors demand to own corporate bonds
rather than government debentures decreased to 206 basis points
on Jan. 11 from 211 basis points on Jan. 4, according to the
Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Corporate & High Yield
index. Yields decreased 5 basis points to 3.27 percent from 3.32
percent. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
