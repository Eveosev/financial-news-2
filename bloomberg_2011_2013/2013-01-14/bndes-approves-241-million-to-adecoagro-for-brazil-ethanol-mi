Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento
Economico e Social,  Brazil ’s development bank, approved a 488.6
million-real loan ($241 million) to  Adecoagro SA (AGRO)  for a sugar-
cane mill as the agricultural company seeks to position itself
for a looming fuel deficit.  The mill, planned for Ivinhema, Mato Grosso do Sul, in the
country’s center-west region, will be able to process 4.1
million metric tons of cane a year and includes a 120-megawatt
biomass power plant, the Rio de Janeiro-based lender said today
in an e-mailed statement. It’s expected to start processing
crops next year.  Brazil, the world’s second-biggest ethanol producer, is on
track to suffer a domestic shortage of fuel for light passenger
vehicles by 2018 if investments in new ethanol production
capacity don’t increase, according to Salim Morsy, an analyst at
Bloomberg New Energy Finance’s  Sao Paulo  office.  “The arithmetic reality of fuel supply is that ethanol
investments in greenfields must take place if the country wants
to avoid the embarrassment of importing tens of millions of
cubic meters of gasoline,” Morsy said in a telephone interview
today.  Adecoagro operates another sugar and ethanol mill, Angelica
Agroenergia, in Mato Grosso do Sul with 4 million tons of cane-
crushing capacity, according to the statement.  Adecoagro has operations in  Argentina , Brazil and Uruguay
and its biggest investor is billionaire  George Soros . The U.S.
is the world’s biggest ethanol producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
