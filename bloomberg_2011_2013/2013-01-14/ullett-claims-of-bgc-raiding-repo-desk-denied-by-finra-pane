Tullett Prebon Plc (TLPR) ’s claim that
competitor  BGC Partners Inc. (BGCP)  improperly lured away nine traders
was rejected by an arbitration panel of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority, according to BGC.  The claims for more than $16 million against BGC, which
matches securities trades between banks, are in addition to
several other lawsuits brought by Tullett Prebon from 2009 to
2011 that seek at least $1 billion in damages for allegedly
raiding its brokers around the world. The dispute decided Jan.
11 by the Finra arbitration panel involved nine repurchase
agreement traders who left Tullett Prebon for BGC in 2011,
Robert Hubbell, a BGC spokesman, said in a telephone interview.  “All Tullett’s claims were denied in full, affirming that
BGC’s recruitment and employment of the repo brokers was lawful
and appropriate,” BGC said in a statement today.  The larger lawsuits are still progressing, Hubbell said.
BGC sought to “cripple Tullett’s inter-dealer broker business
on a global scale,” luring 83 brokers from Singapore, Hong
Kong, Tokyo and London, according to Tullett’s 2009 complaint
filed in federal court in Newark,  New Jersey .  Tullett Prebon was ordered to pay $380,000 in compensation
that was owed to the nine brokers who left in 2011, Hubbell
said.  Nigel Szembel, a Tullett Prebon spokesman, didn’t
immediately respond to a telephone message.  The case is Tullett Prebon Plc v. BGC Partners Inc., U.S.
District Court, District of New Jersey (Newark).  To contact the reporter on this story:
