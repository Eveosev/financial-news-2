The  New England Patriots  will be
without  Rob Gronkowski  for the rest of the playoffs after their
All-Pro tight end broke his left forearm again,  NFL.com said ,
citing an unidentified person familiar with the injury.  Gronkowski, who had a team-leading 11 touchdown receptions
this season, will require surgery, NFL.com reported. He
previously broke his forearm on Nov. 18 and missed five games
before returning for the regular-season finale on Dec. 30.  Gronkowski, 23, was injured when he landed hard while
trying to catch a pass during yesterday’s 41-28 playoff win
against the Houston Texans. The Patriots next host the Baltimore
Ravens in the Jan. 20 American Football Conference championship
game, with the winner advancing to the Super Bowl.  Gronkowski has been one of quarterback  Tom Brady ’s favorite
targets since entering the National Football League in 2010,
scoring 38 touchdowns in 43 regular-season games. He had 55
catches for 790 yards in 11 games this season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
