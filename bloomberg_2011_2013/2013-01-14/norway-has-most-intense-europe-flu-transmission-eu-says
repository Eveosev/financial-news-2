Norway is experiencing  Europe ’s most
intense influenza transmission, even as the continent’s annual
flu season appears normal, disease trackers said.  Eleven countries, including France and Germany, reported
medium-intensity flu transmission in the first week of this
year, compared with four in the last week of 2012, the European
Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said in a  report .
Norway was the only country to report high-intensity
transmission, while the U.K. had low-intensity transmission, the
ECDC said.  “This influenza season has started early compared to the
previous season, which was both late and mild,” Angus Nicoll,
head of the Stockholm-based ECDC’s flu program, said in an e-
mailed response to questions today. “There is no indication
that it will be more intense in Europe than usual.”  An influenza epidemic in the U.S. has killed 20 children,
prompting  New York  state and Boston to declare health
emergencies. Flu is widespread in 47 states and deaths from the
virus and associated pneumonia are slightly above the epidemic
level, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has
said. There’s a different mix of viruses circulating in Europe
from those causing disease in the U.S., Nicoll said.  Influenza viruses circulating in Europe are considered a
good match for those in the seasonal vaccines, according to the
Jan. 11 report from the ECDC, which is an agency of the European
Union. Companies that make flu vaccines include  AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) ,
CSL Ltd., GlaxoSmithKline Plc,  Novartis AG (NOVN)  and  Sanofi. (SAN)   To contact the reporter on this story:
