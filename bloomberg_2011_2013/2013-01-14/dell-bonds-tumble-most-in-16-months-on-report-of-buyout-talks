Dell Inc. (DELL) ’s bonds fell to the lowest
level in almost 16 months following a report that the personal-
computer maker is in buyout talks with private-equity firms.  Dell’s $400 million of 4.625 percent notes due April 2021
declined 5.24 cents to 103.57 cents on the dollar to yield 4.11
percent as of 3:36 p.m. in New York, according to Trace, the
bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority. That’s the lowest level for the debt since Sept. 15,
2011.  Dell is discussing going private with at least two firms,
according to a person with knowledge of the matter who asked not
to be identified because the talks are private. The discussions
are preliminary and could fall apart, according to the report
from Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
