China Investment Corp., the nation’s
sovereign wealth fund, is trying to cut an “over-reliance” on
U.S. debt as an economic recovery in the world’s biggest economy
drives up  interest rates , Chairman  Lou Jiwei  said.  The Beijing-based fund is adding stable-return assets,
including infrastructure, manufacturing and real estate with
good returns, Lou told a forum in Hong Kong today. Europe still
faces a recession risk, and CIC, as the state fund is known, is
“very cautious” on Japan investments, he added.  CIC, which helps manage the world’s largest foreign-
currency reserves, will post a profit on its overseas
investments for 2012 as monetary easing in Western countries
boosted  capital markets  and investment returns, CIC’s Executive
Vice President  Jesse Wang  said at a forum in China last month.  “With the economic recovery, it’s only a matter of time
that U.S. interest rates will rise and those bonds will
depreciate in value,” Lou said. “So our approach is limited
buying. We’re hoping to add allocations to stable return,
absolute return, stock and other assets to reduce reliance on
 U.S. debt .”  The fund had a 4.3 percent loss on its international
investments in 2011, its worst performance since it was
established in 2007, as its resources-heavy portfolio was hurt
by declines in global commodity prices.  --Bei Hu. With assistance from Zhang Dingmin in Beijing. Editors:
