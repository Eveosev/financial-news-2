Los Angeles Dodgers manager  Don
Mattingly  has been suspended two games by Major League Baseball
for arguing with the umpire during a game.  Mattingly was also given an undisclosed fine for his
“excessive arguing” with home plate umpire Angel Campos in the
Dodgers’ 10-6 loss at Pittsburgh two days ago. Mattingly was
ejected from the game.  The suspension will begin tonight when the Dodgers continue
their series in Atlanta.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
