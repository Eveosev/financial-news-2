Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez 
announced a program to subsidize housing for middle class
Venezuelans ahead of an October election.  Under the program, Venezuelans who earn between four and
fifteen times the nation’s minimum wage of 2,048 bolivars ($476)
a month would receive a government subsidy of at least 10
percent for a home purchase, Chavez said in comments on state
television.  Venezuelans who qualify for the subsidy would make no down
payment and repay mortgages at up to 11.42 percent interest over
30 years. Chavez’s plan calls for more than 20,000 homes to be
built nationwide for the middle class.  To contact the reporter on this story:
