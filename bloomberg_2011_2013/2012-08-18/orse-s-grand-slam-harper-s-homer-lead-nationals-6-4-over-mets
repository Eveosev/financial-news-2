Michael Morse hit a grand slam and
Bryce Harper added a two-run homer to lead the National League-
leading  Washington Nationals  to a 6-4 Major League Baseball
victory over the  New York  Mets.  Both home runs came off Mets’ pitcher Johan Santana (6-9),
who surrendered six runs on seven hits and struck out four in
five innings at Nationals Park in  Washington  D.C.  Morse’s grand slam in the fourth inning, the first of the
season for Washington, gave the Nationals a 4-2 advantage.  “It was awesome,” winning pitcher Ross Detwiler said.
“Everyone in the dugout and in the stands was going crazy.”  Harper’s two-run homer in the fifth widened the lead to 6-2.  Detwiler (7-5) allowed three runs on six hits and struck
out one in six innings for the Nationals. Tyler Clippard got his
26th save after walking two and striking out two in the ninth
inning.  Daniel Murphy hit a two-run single to give the Mets a 2-0
lead in the first inning. Ronny Cedeno drove home  Scott Hairston 
in the sixth and Kelly Shoppach homered in the seventh to narrow
the gap to a two-run deficit.  The Mets (56-63) are in third place in the five-team NL
East, 18 games behind the Nationals (74-45).  To contact the reporter on this story:
