Jimmy Walker takes a one-stroke lead
into the third round of the Wyndham Championship, the final PGA
event before the FedEx Cup playoffs begin.  Walker shot an 8-under 62 yesterday after a one hour, 17-
minute rain delay for a 12-under 128 for 36 holes at Sedgefield
Country Club in Greensboro,  North Carolina .  Defending champion  Webb Simpson  shot a 7-under 63 to take
second place, while Carl Pettersson,  Tim Clark ,  Sergio Garcia 
and rookie Harris English were in third place at 10-under.  “I was playing with J.B. (Holmes), and he was bombing the
driver everywhere, and I was just kind of bunting the 5-wood
around and hitting good approach shots,” Walker told reporters.
“It was pretty boring-looking golf -- not a lot of drivers, not
a lot of 3-woods. There’s a lot of 5-woods and some irons, and
it’s just kind of placement around the golf course.”  Simpson had birdies on four of his final five holes to
elevate him in the standings to 11-under 129.  “To play a round on a golf course this tricky without a
bogey is always a good thing,” Simpson said.  The top 125 golfers in points will qualify for the FedEx
Cup competition that begins next week with the Barclays on the
Black Course at Bethpage State Park in Farmingdale,  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
