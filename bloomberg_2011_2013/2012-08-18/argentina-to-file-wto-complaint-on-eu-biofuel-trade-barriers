Argentina will lodge a complaint
with the  World Trade Organization  about barriers imposed by the
European Union on biofuel imports.  Spain’s April 21 decision to block biofuel imports from out
of the European Union is a “protectionist” measure, according
to a statement distributed by e-mail from Argentina’s foreign
relations ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
