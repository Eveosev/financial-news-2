Measures to stimulate growth should
be combined with fiscal austerity to avoid a deterioration of
deficits, European Central Bank council member Panicos Demetriades told the Cypriot edition of  Kathimerini .  While Cyprus primarily asked for an international aid to
recapitalize its lenders, the country has chronic structural
problems and needs to cut unproductive public spending and
deploy resources for investments, the Nicosia-based newspaper
cited Demetriades as saying today in an interview.  The expansion of  Bank of Cyprus pcl  and Cyprus Popular Bank
pcl abroad has created significant systemic risks and a possible
solution is for the lenders to reduce their reliance on foreign
assets, Demetriades, who is also governor of the  Central Bank of
Cyprus , told the newspaper.  The amount needed for the recapitalization of the banks
won’t be known until an independent review of their loan
portfolios, including their lending in  Greece , is completed,
according to Demetriades. The review isn’t expected to be
completed before the end of October, he said.  Cyprus government bonds will be eligible again for use in
ECB refinancing operations as soon as the country signs its
international aid deal, which is expected next month, the
governor said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
