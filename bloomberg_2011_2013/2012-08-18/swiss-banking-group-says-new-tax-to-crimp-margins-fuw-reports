The  Swiss Bankers Association 
expects the cost of implementing new withholding taxes to put
pressure on margins,  Finanz und Wirtschaft  reported, citing an
interview with Chief Executive Officer Claude-Alain Margelisch.  While the new fiscal regime will result in outflows of
client funds, it will add legal certainty and increase the
attractiveness of Switzerlandâ€™s financial center, Margelisch was
cited as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
