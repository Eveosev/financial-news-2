The  New England Patriots  signed
Olympic silver-medal sprinter and free-agent running back Jeff
Demps, the National Football League team said.  Terms of the contract weren’t disclosed.  Demps, 22, won his medal in the 4x100 relay at the 2012
Games in London, where the U.S. team finished second to  Jamaica .  Demps, listed in a release by the team at 5 feet, 7 inches
and 191 pounds (170 centimeters and 87 kilograms), wasn’t
drafted by an NFL team after making known his intention to focus
on a track career. When the Olympics ended, he filed the
paperwork to join the league.  Nick Caserio, player personnel director for the Patriots,
said Demps was “good with the ball, good speed, caught the ball
OK, a little bit undersized.”  Demps had 367 rushing attempts for 2,470 career yards for
6.7-yard average with 23 rushing touchdowns in four seasons at
the University of  Florida . He also returned 21 kickoffs for 604
yards and one touchdown.  “He’s speed,” agent Daniel Rose told the  Associated Press .
“If used correctly, he could definitely be a weapon.”  Demps is the only Florida athlete to have won a national
championship in two sports with his 2009 football title and
multiple indoor and outdoor track championships.  The Patriots, who opened the preseason with a 7-6 win over
 New Orleans , will host Philadelphia on Aug. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
