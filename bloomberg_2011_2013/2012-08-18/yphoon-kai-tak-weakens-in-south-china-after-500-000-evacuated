Typhoon Kai-tak weakened into a
tropical depression after blowing over houses, triggering floods
and causing more than 500,000 people to be evacuated as it swept
through the south of  China .  The typhoon will continue to cause rainstorms in Yunnan
province and China’s southern regions today, after weakening
when it reached northern  Vietnam  at 2:00 p.m. China time
yesterday, the China Meteorological Administration said.  Floods triggered by the typhoon caused the emergency
evacuation of 526,000 people in the provinces of Guangdong,
Guangxi, and Hainan, while more than 3,000 houses collapsed in
its wake, the Xinhua News Agency  reported , citing the Ministry
of Civil Affairs. It caused one death while two people remain
missing, according to the report.  More than 700 villagers near Qinzhou, a port city about 80
kilometers (50 miles) north of China’s border with Vietnam, were
trapped in their homes, Xinhua said in a separate report.  Flooding due to the typhoon rains affected more than 60,000
in districts near Qinzhou, with more than 8,700 people evacuated
to safety, according to the Xinhua report, which cited flood
control authorities.  Hong Kong  on Aug. 17 lowered its tropical cyclone warning,
first to a No. 3 Strong Wind Signal and then to a No. 1 Standby
Signal, as Typhoon Kai-tak passed, the  Hong Kong Observatory 
said on its website.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
