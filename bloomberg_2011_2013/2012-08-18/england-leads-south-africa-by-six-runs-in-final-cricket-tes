England leads South Africa by six
runs after being bowled out for 315 on day three of the third
and final cricket Test at Lord’s in London.  Jonny Bairstow scored 95 and Graeme Swann added 38 runs for
England, which began the day 208-5. Morne Morkel and  Dale Steyn 
took four wickets each for South Africa.  England needs a victory to remain No. 1 in the
 International Cricket Council ’s Test rankings, while a draw is
enough for South Africa to leapfrog the hosts. The Proteas won
the first Test by an innings and 12 runs with the second rain-
affected game drawn.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
