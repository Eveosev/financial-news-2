Standard Chartered  Plc is
accelerating plans to change its board members amid investor
pressure over how the bank handled claims it hid transactions
with Iran, the Financial Times said, citing sources it didn’t
identify.  The changes, expected in the next few months, will focus on
the length of tenure, the paper said. The bank this week paid
$340 million to the New York Department of Financial Services,
which said Standard Chartered falsified records dealing with
Iran.  Standard Chartered chairman Sir John Peace flagged board
changes through 2012 and 2013 at the annual general meeting in
May, and the bank can’t comment further on timing, company
spokesman Shaun Gamble said by phone from London today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
