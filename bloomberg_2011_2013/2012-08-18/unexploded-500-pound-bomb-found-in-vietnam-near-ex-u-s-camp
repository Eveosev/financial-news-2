An unexploded 500-pound (227-
kilogram) bomb was removed from near the site of a former U.S.
military camp in  Vietnam , according to an organization that
deals with remnants of war such as munitions and landmines.  The MK-82 bomb was found in Lang Vei, in Tan Lap commune in
the central Vietnamese province of Quang Tri, according to an e-
mailed statement from Project Renew, which receives support from
the governments of  Norway  and the U.S. Tan Lap commune is in a
district called Huong Hoa, near the countryâ€™s border with Laos.  The bomb was unearthed Aug. 16 at a depth of about 10 feet
by local men searching for scrap metal in an area where an
electricity transmission line is under construction. It was
removed the next day in a six-hour process by an explosives
ordnance disposal team, Project Renew said.  Lang Vei was the site of a Special Forces camp from 1966 to
1969, according to the website of the U.S. Army. The U.S. and
Vietnamese governments will continue to cooperate in clearing
bombs and mines, with the American side providing facilities and
technology, Vietnamese Defense Minister Phung Quang Thanh said
during a June visit to Hanoi by U.S. Defense Secretary  Leon Panetta .  --Jason Folkmanis in  Ho Chi Minh City . Editor: Paul Tighe,  Jim
