Hurricane Gordon is moving rapidly
east toward the eastern Azores islands off the coast of
Portugal, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center.  A Category 2 hurricane on the five-step Saffir-Simpson
scale, Gordon was located 340 miles (550 kilometers) west-
southwest of the Azores, the NHC said in an  advisory  today.  The seventh named storm of the Atlantic season is moving
toward the east at 23 miles per hour and maximum sustained winds
decreased to around 100 miles per hour, according to the NHC. It
is forecast to approach the eastern Azores tomorrow.  “Additional weakening is forecast, but Gordon is still
expected to be a hurricane when it passes near or over the
eastern Azores,” the center said.  A hurricane warning is in effect for the central and
eastern Azores, and surf swells generated by Gordon are expected
to reach the islands today.  Showers and thunderstorms that are part of a tropical wave
about 800 miles west of the Cape Verde Islands have about a 60
percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone during the
next 48 hours as it moves west at between 20 and 25 miles per
hour, the hurricane center said on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
