Spain’s 10-year bonds  advanced  for
the first week this month on speculation the government will
request a sovereign bailout that would trigger European Central
Bank purchases of its debt.  German 10-year bunds dropped as  Chancellor Angela Merkel 
signaled support for the ECB’s plan to help reduce indebted
countries’ borrowing costs and attach conditions to the
providing the support. Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy 
reiterated that he is considering requesting purchases.  “Spanish yields have fallen, suggesting increased market
optimism about ECB and European Union policy action,” said
 Orlando Green , a fixed-interest strategist at Credit Agricole
Corporate & Investment Bank in London.  Spain’s 10-year yield slid 46 basis points to 6.44 percent
this week, reaching the lowest since July 5. The 5.85 percent
securities maturing in January 2022 rallied 0.375, or 30.75
euros per 1,000-euro ($1,232) face amount, to 95.855. Spain’s
two-year note yield dropped 43 basis points to 3.77 percent.  Yields on Spanish debt surged to euro-era records last
month before ECB President  Mario Draghi  said on Aug. 2 that the
central bank may buy sovereign bonds. Rajoy said the next day he
would consider triggering the mechanism if it were in the “best
interests of Spaniards,” and he reiterated those comments on
Aug. 14.  Spain plans to sell 12- and 18-month debt on Aug. 21.
 France  and the Netherlands will auction bills a day earlier,
while Germany is set to offer two-year notes on Aug. 22.  The rate on German 10-year bonds climbed 11 basis points
this week to 1.50 percent, the biggest advance since the five-
days through July 27. Germany is “in line” with the ECB’s
approach to defending the euro, Merkel said at a news conference
in Ottawa on Aug. 16.  Spanish debt handed investors a loss of 3.3 percent this
year through Aug. 16, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg
and the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.
That’s compared to a 2.8 percent return on German  government
bonds .  To contact the reporters on this story:
