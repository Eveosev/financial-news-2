(Corrects to show Phelps won two silver medals in London,
in seventh paragraph.)  Michael Phelps  didn’t violate
Olympic rules when photos of the swimmer modeling for a Louis
Vuitton advertising campaign were released prematurely, his
agent Peter Carlisle said.  One photo showing Phelps lounging in a bathtub with a Louis
Vuitton bag on the floor was leaked during the 2012 Olympic
Games in London.  The  International Olympic Committee  has a rule that bans
athletes from promoting non-official sponsors during the games.
Punishment for violations can include stripping an Olympian of
medals.  “Rule 40 applies to athletes who permit use of name during
Games; it doesn’t apply to unauthorized uses (which,
unfortunately, are common),” Carlisle said on his Twitter
account.  The ad campaign, photographed by  Annie Leibovitz , was
officially released two days ago.  Besides the bathtub scene, Phelps is also shown in a three-
piece suit sitting on a sofa with former Soviet gymnast Larisa
Latynina, who held the record for the most medals until the
swimmer surpassed it in  London .  Phelps won four golds and two silvers in London, retiring
with 22 medals.  The IOC didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
