Treasuries posted their biggest
four-week decline since December 2010 as signs economic growth
is accelerating dimmed the likelihood the  Federal Reserve  will
initiate another round of asset purchases.  Economic data on the job market, the housing industry and
consumer purchasing and sentiment showed signs of faster growth,
helping reduce haven demand to push benchmark 10-year Treasury
 yields  to the highest level since May 11. The central bank will
release minutes from its Aug. 1 meeting where it declined to
initiate a third round of monetary stimulus, a policy known as
quantitative easing, or QE. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will
address the Kansas City Fed’s annual conference on monetary
policy at  Jackson Hole , Wyoming, on Aug. 31.  “The market’s saying there is no QE3,” said  Charles Comiskey , head of Treasury trading at Bank of  Nova Scotia  in  New
York , one of 21 primary dealers that trade with the Fed. “Rates
have backed up significantly. QE3 is off the table.”  The 10-year note yield rose 15 basis points this week, or
0.15 percentage point, to 1.81 percent, according to Bloomberg
Bond Trader prices. The 1.625 percent note due in August 2022
dropped 1 13/32 or $14.06 per $1,000 face value to 98 9/32.  Yield Path  The yield on the securities has climbed 35 basis points
from 1.46 percent on July 20, the biggest four-week increase
since the weeks ended Dec. 24, 2010, when the yield rose 52
basis points. That boost in yields came four weeks after the Fed
announced a $600 billion program of purchases of  Treasury
securities  with the goal of increasing inflation expectations.  “Economic activity decelerated somewhat over the first
half of this year,” the  Federal Open Market Committee  said Aug.
1. “The committee will closely monitor incoming information on
economic and financial developments and will provide additional
accommodation as needed to promote a stronger economic recovery
and sustained improvement in labor market conditions in a
context of  price stability .”  The minutes of the meeting will be released Aug. 22.  So-called convexity-related hedging by holders of mortgage-
backed securities may have contributed to declines in
Treasuries, according to analysts at Bank of America Corp.
Rising Treasury yields help drive  mortgage rates  higher,
triggering hedging from holders of mortgage-backed securities,
wrote  Priya Misra  and Shyam Rajan, interest-rate strategists at
Bank of America in New York, in a note to clients today.  Mortgage Hedges  Rising mortgage rates decrease the risk of mortgage
refinancing, which increases bond holders’ duration. The hedging
spurs demand to pay fixed rates in swaps, driving swap rates
higher and swap spreads wider.  Convexity-related hedging may “have been responsible for
the last 10 basis points of the selloff,” they wrote.  A selloff paused when 10-year yields climbed as high as
1.86 percent Aug. 16, matching the 200-day  moving average ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The 10-day relative-
strength index, a gauge of momentum, for the 10-year note, was
72.4 yesterday, compared with 47.5 on Aug. 2. A level below 30
or above 70 suggests the yield may change direction. The index
reached 28.5 on July 24, the day before the 10-year yields fell
to a record low 1.379 percent.  “We seem to be trying to get our footing in this 1.80
percent to 1.85 percent area,” said  John Briggs , a U.S.
government-bond strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc’s
RBS Securities unit in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , a primary dealer.
“We could generate a near-term rally just because of the
technicals.”  Futures Positions  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators reversed
from a net-short position to a net-long position in 10-year note
futures for the week ending Aug. 14, according to U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission data.  Speculative long positions, or bets prices will rise,
outnumbered short positions by 32,336 contracts on the Chicago
Board of Trade. Last week, traders were net-short 14,595
contracts.  U.S. government securities have handed investors a 1.6
percent loss this month as of yesterday, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch indexes, as economic data exceeded
forecasts and the  European debt crisis  eased. An index of
sovereign bonds around the world slid 0.7 percent, reflecting
waning demand for the relative safety of debt.  The  MSCI All-Country World Index (MXWD)  of stocks returned 3.2
percent including reinvested dividends, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Economic Data  The index of U.S. leading economic indicators climbed more
than forecast in July, a sign of sustained expansion in the
world’s largest economy. The Thomson Reuters/University of
Michigan preliminary August index of consumer sentiment
increased to 73.6, the highest level since May, from 72.3 the
prior month.  U.S. retail sales rose 0.8 percent in July, a report on
Aug. 14 showed, above the median estimate of economists in a
Bloomberg survey. A separate report on Aug. 3 showed the U.S.
added 163,000 jobs last month, more than the 100,000 projected
by analysts.  Building permits, a proxy for future construction, rose to
an 812,000 pace, the most since August 2008. New-home starts
fell 1.1 percent to a 746,000 annual rate from June’s 754,000
pace, Commerce Department figures showed Aug. 16 in  Washington .
The median estimate of 79 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
called for 756,000.  Jobless claims climbed by 2,000 to 366,000 in the week
ended Aug. 11, Labor Department figures showed Aug. 16 in
Washington. The four-week moving average fell to 373,400, the
lowest since July 2008.  Budget Update  The U.S. government’s deficit narrowed as spending dropped
by 11.9 percent from a year earlier and some payments were
accelerated to the previous month for calendar-related reasons.
The deficit through July for the 2012 fiscal year, which ends
Sept. 30, is $973.8 billion compared with $1.1 trillion at this
point last year and the lowest for July since 2008.  Even as the economy shows signs of improvement, the U.S.
“will be on downgrade watch again as the end of the year comes
in,” said  Michael Cloherty , head of U.S. interest-rate strategy
at Royal Bank of Canada’s RBC Capital Markets unit in New York,
a primary dealer, in an interview on  Bloomberg Radio  with  Tom Keene .  Efforts to support the economy by scaling back budget cuts
enacted as part of August 2011 agreement to increase the debt
ceiling may lead to an additional reduction to the U.S. credit
rating, Cloherty said. “It’s going to be very difficult to
avoid the effects of the fiscal cliff.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
