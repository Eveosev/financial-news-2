Arsenal agreed to sell midfielder
Alex Song to Barcelona, the two soccer teams said on their
websites.  Barcelona will pay 19 million euros ($23 million) for the
24-year-old Cameroon national team player, who will sign a five-
year contract, the club said on its website. He’ll undergo a
medical exam in two days, Barcelona said.  Song is the second player to leave Arsenal this week.
Former captain  Robin van Persie , who led the Premeier League
with 30 goals last season, signed a four-year deal with
 Manchester United  yesterday.  Arsenal tied Sunderland 0-0 at home today in its Premier
League opener. Barcelona begins its season in Spain’s La Liga
tomorrow at home against Real Sociedad.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
