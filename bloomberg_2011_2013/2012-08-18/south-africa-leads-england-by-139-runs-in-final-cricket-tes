South Africa leads  England  by 139
runs after day three of the third and final cricket Test at
Lord’s in London.  Hashim Amla was 57 not out as South Africa reached 145-3 in
its second innings. Earlier, Jonny Bairstow scored 95 as England
was bowled out for 315 in response to the Proteas’ first-innings
309.  England must win to remain No. 1 in the  International
Cricket Council ’s Test rankings, while a draw is enough for
South Africa to leapfrog the hosts. The Proteas won the first
Test by an innings and 12 runs with the second rain-affected
game drawn.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
