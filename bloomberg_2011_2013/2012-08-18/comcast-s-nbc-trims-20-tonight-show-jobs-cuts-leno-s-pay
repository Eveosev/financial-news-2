Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s  NBC Universal 
eliminated about 20 positions from “The Tonight Show” and host
 Jay Leno  took a salary cut, a person familiar with the moves
said.  Leno, who receives about $25 million to $30 million a year,
agreed to accept about $20 million, according to the person, who
wasn’t authorized to speak publicly. The Los Angeles Times and
IMDB.com, a movie and entertainment website, reported the staff
cuts and Leno’s pay package earlier.  Dick Guttman, a publicist for Leno, didn’t respond to a
voicemail left by Bloomberg News seeking comment. Leno’s agent,
Steve Levine, also didn’t immediately reply to a voicemail and
e-mail.  The move comes 19 months after Philadelphia-based Comcast,
the largest U.S. cable operator, acquired control of NBC
Universal from General Electric Co. GE, based in Fairfield,
Connecticut, moved Leno to 10 p.m. three years ago in a failed
attempt to move the late-night talk-show host into prime time.  Other staff members also agreed to pay cuts as well, the
Times reported.  The newspaper said the show’s weekly budget will be about
$1.7 million after the cost cuts, down from about $2.3 million
now.  Shares of Comcast fell less than 1 percent to $34.02 on
Aug. 17 in Nasdaq trading. The stock is up 43 percent year to
date.  To contact the reporter on this story:
