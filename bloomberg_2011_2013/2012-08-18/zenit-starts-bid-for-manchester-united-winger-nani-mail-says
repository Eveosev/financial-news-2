Zenit St. Petersburg has launched a
bid to sign Manchester United winger Nani, the  Daily Mail  said.  Nani may have to fight for playing time this season after
United signed  Robin van Persie  from Arsenal and Shinji Kagawa
from German champion Dortmund, the Mail said.  Coach Luciano Spalletti said Zenit has made a “an offer to
a club,” but hasn’t approached the player.  “If the club won’t sell a player, then there’s no thought
of making an offer to the player himself,” the Mail quoted
Spalletti as saying.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
