Hurricane Gordon, the seventh named
storm of the Atlantic season, is moving to the east at 18 miles
(28 kilometers) per hour, maintaining its strength, the U.S.
National Hurricane Center said.  The storm  is about 700 miles west-southwest of the Azores,
the Miami-based center said in its latest advisory. The
 Portuguese government  has upgraded its warning for the central
and eastern Azores to a  hurricane warning  from a tropical storm
warning, the center said.  Gordon is expected to strengthen slightly before it reaches
cooler waters tomorrow, and will be “near” hurricane strength
as it approaches the eastern Azores tomorrow night, the agency
said. Its maximum sustained winds are 80 mph.  Separately, Tropical Storm Helene has weakened into a
tropical depression about 15 miles south-southwest of Tampico,
 Mexico , and has maximum sustained winds of 35 mph, the center
said.  The Mexican government has dropped the tropical storm
warnings issued for Helene.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
