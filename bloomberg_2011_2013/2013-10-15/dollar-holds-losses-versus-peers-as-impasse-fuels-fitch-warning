Higher-yielding currencies including
 Mexico ’s peso and South Africa’s rand rallied versus the dollar
as a tentative U.S. agreement to extend the nation’s borrowing
ability prompted an increase in investors’ risk appetite.  The yen fell versus all of its 16 most-traded peers amid
ebbing haven demand as Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and
Minority Leader Mitch McConnell announced an accord to end the
government shutdown and push fiscal deadlines into next year.
New Zealand’s dollar reached a four-week high as inflation
fueled bets interest rates will rise.  “Currencies are responding to increasing hope that the
situation will be resolved in the next 24 hours or so,” Dan Dorrow, the head of research at Faros Trading LLC in  Stamford ,
 Connecticut , said in a telephone interview. The longer-term
effect of the crisis is that “it’s a growth shock to the
economy. It’ll have a dollar-negative effect.”  The peso strengthened 1.2 percent to 12.8424 to the
greenback at 5 p.m. New York time and touched 12.8366, the
strongest level since Sept. 24. The rand rallied 1.2 percent to
9.8648 per dollar and reached 9.8594, the strongest level since
Sept. 25.  South Africa’s key interest rate is 5 percent, compared to
a range of zero to 0.25 percent in the U.S. Mexico’s benchmark
is 3.75 percent.  The yen fell 0.6 percent to 98.77 per dollar and reached
98.97, the weakest since Sept. 27. The Japanese currency dropped
0.7 percent to 133.67 per euro.  Euro-Dollar  The dollar was little changed against the euro at $1.3534
after weakening earlier as much as 0.3 percent and appreciating
0.4 percent. It touched $1.3473, the strongest since Sept. 30.  “We’ve just had a hairy run thanks to  Washington , and that
hasn’t caused euro-dollar to break,” Andrew Wilkinson, chief
economic strategist at Miller Tabak & Co. in New York, said in a
phone interview. “I don’t think the catalyst to buy dollar on
this current resolution is sufficient to drive the dollar higher
at this point.”  A gauge of price swings among Group of Seven nations’
currencies rose from the lowest level in almost nine months.
JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s G-7 Volatility Index increased to as much
as 8.27 percent after dropping to 8.17 percent yesterday, the
least since Jan. 23. The 2013 average is 9.46 percent.  U.S. stocks climbed, with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
rising 1.4 percent.  The Senate and House plan to vote on the debt plan later
today, and the White House press secretary said President  Barack
Obama  supports the deal. House Speaker John Boehner said in a
statement Republicans won’t block the compromise.  Future Confrontations  The framework negotiated by Reid and McConnell would fund
the government through Jan. 15, 2014, and suspend the debt limit
until Feb. 7, setting up another round of confrontations. Senate
opponents said they won’t stall a vote, and the White House
press secretary said President Barack Obama supports the deal.  The agreement concludes a four-week standoff that began
with Republicans demanding defunding of President Barack Obama’s
2010 health-care law, and objecting to raising the $16.7
trillion debt limit and funding the government without policy
concessions. A partial government shutdown has been in place
since Oct. 1. They achieved almost none of those goals.  “This is far less than many of us had hoped for, frankly,
but it’s far better than what some had sought,” McConnell said.  New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, climbed after the
statistics bureau said consumer prices increased 0.9 percent in
the third quarter, the fastest pace since the period ended June
2011. An industry report released this week showed home prices
climbed to a record in September.  Rate Bets  “New Zealand is almost the only developed country with a
rate increase coming into sight, so the kiwi is likely to remain
strong,” said Kengo Suzuki, chief currency strategist at Mizuho
Securities Co. in  Tokyo . Markets are expecting the central bank
to raise interest rates “because of the resilient economy and
inflation concerns.”  The kiwi appreciated 0.5 percent to 84.25 U.S. cents and
touched 84.45 cents, the highest level since May 9.  The Czech koruna dropped against the majority of its 31
most-traded counterparts, falling to a two-week low against the
euro, after Lubomir Lizal, a central-bank board member, said
economic developments point to need for easier monetary
policies. The currency lost 0.3 percent to 25.682 against the
shared currency. It touched 25.714, the weakest since Oct. 1.  The dollar declined 0.9 percent in the past month,
according to Bloomberg Correlation Weighted Indexes, which track
10 developed-country currencies. The euro gained 0.8 percent,
while the yen declined 0.5 percent.  The Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback
against 10 major peers, rose as much as 0.2 percent today and
fell as 0.2 percent before trading little changed at 1,011.89.  Options Trading  Trading in over-the-counter foreign-exchange options
totaled $49 billion, from $46 billion yesterday, according to
data reported by U.S. banks to the Depository Trust Clearing
Corp. and tracked by Bloomberg. Volume in options on the dollar-yen exchange rate amounted to $8.6 billion, the largest share of
trades at 17 percent. Options on the euro-dollar rate totaled
$7.1 billion, or 14 percent.  Greenback-yen options trading was 62 percent more than the
average for the past five Wednesdays at a similar time in the
day, according to Bloomberg analysis. Euro-dollar options
trading was 90 percent above average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
