Baltimore Orioles third baseman
Manny Machado will miss spring training and probably the start
of the 2014 Major League Baseball regular season after having
surgery to repair a torn ligament in his left knee.  Machado, 21, was injured during a Sept. 23 game against the
 Tampa Bay Rays  when his knee buckled as he landed awkwardly
while rounding first base. Machado was taken off the field on a
cart and later opted for surgery, which included a
reconstruction of the patellofemoral ligament in his knee, the
Orioles said yesterday on their  website .  Machado’s projected recovery time is six months, the team
said, making it unlikely he’ll be back for Baltimore’s 2014
regular-season opener on March 31.  Machado was selected to the American League All-Star team
in his first full season this year, hitting .283 with 14 home
runs, 71 runs batted in and a league-leading 51 doubles. He also
had the highest fielding percentage and most double plays for an
AL third baseman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
