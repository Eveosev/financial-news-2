Underwater on your mortgage and still haven’t refinanced? You may think that you missed the window or are not eligible, but with  interest rates  still near historic lows and an expanded Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP) it may be within your reach. While it’s true that home prices have risen steadily over the past year and a half,  approximately 24 percent of American homeowners are still underwater on their mortgages . This is especially true of those living in areas hardest hit by the housing and economic crisis. The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) estimates that there are between 1 million and 2 million borrowers eligible for HARP who are underwater or are paying above-market interest rates. You could be one of them. Why do it? Borrowers nationwide are reaping significant savings — either by lowering their payments, reducing their interest rates and/or securing a fixed rate. Homeowners who refinanced through HARP during the first quarter of 2013 will save an average of $4,300 in interest payments during the first 12 months. Take homeowners Josh and Kelly in Tampa, FL, who were $80,000 underwater on their mortgage. By refinancing under HARP last year, they were able to lower their interest rate by nearly 2 percent, reducing their monthly payments by about $520. And HARP is now simpler than ever. So if you were already turned down before, try again because recent changes to the program are designed to help more homeowners no matter how far your home has fallen in value. Why now? While the program has been extended through the end of 2015, the time to act is now!  Interest rates on  30-year fixed mortgages  have increased nearly a full percentage point since mid-May, and we do not expect them to return to the historic lows seen late last year and the first part of 2013. However, mortgage interest rates are still comparatively low. Looking back to the mid-2000s, the average 30-year fixed interest rate was around 6 percent. Freddie Mac’s chief economist expects rates on the 30-year fixed rate mortgage to remain around 4.5 percent for the rest of the year. Given that nearly half of the 30-year fixed rate mortgages owned or guaranteed by Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae have rates of 5 percent or greater, lots of homeowners stand to benefit from acting now. Get started More than 2.8 million families have already benefited from the program, and you could, too. If you are current on your payments and your mortgage is owned by Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae,  get started  now by following these steps: Related items from  Zillow Blog : Note: The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the opinion or position of Zillow.
