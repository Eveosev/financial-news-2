New York  Giants running back  David Wilson  won’t require season-ending surgery on his neck and may
be able to return to action in about a month,  NFL.com reported ,
citing an unidentified person familiar with the situation.  Wilson missed the Oct. 10 loss to the Chicago Bears after
suffering an unspecified neck injury during the first quarter of
the team’s Week 5 defeat against the  Philadelphia Eagles . Wilson
had told the  New York Daily News  that doctors were concerned he
might have a narrowing of the spinal column.  Wilson got a second opinion yesterday in Los Angeles from
spinal surgeon Robert Watkins, who didn’t recommend surgery,
according to NFL.com. Wilson probably will still miss three to
four weeks, the National Football League’s website said, meaning
he’d sit out games against Minnesota and Philadelphia before the
Giants’ Week 9 bye.  Brandon Jacobs  has taken over as the lead back in Wilson’s
absence, though he and Da’Rel Scott both missed practice
yesterday because of sore hamstrings, leaving rookie Michael Cox
as the only healthy running back.  The Giants are 0-6 this season for the first time since
1976 and rank 30th out of 32 NFL teams in yards rushing per
game.  To contact the reporter on this story:
