The U.S.  Supreme Court  turned away
California’s appeal of a ruling that requires the state to cut
its prison population by almost 10,000 inmates by year-end.  The justices today left intact a lower court order that the
state at one point said would force the release of violent
offenders. California is planning to rent private prison space
to avoid that possibility. The state’s prison population is
currently 124,000.  The high court foreshadowed today’s action in August, when
the justices voted 6-3 not to put the lower court ruling on
hold.  The Supreme Court in 2011 upheld an earlier order requiring
the state to cut the number of inmates by tens of thousands. The
high court said that order, the largest of its kind in U.S.
history, was an appropriate step to remedy the constitutionally
inadequate level of health care provided to prisoners.  The latest appeal centered on a follow-up order issued in
June by the same three-judge federal panel requiring the state
to take new steps to reach 137.5 percent of prison design
capacity by Dec. 31.  California ’s prisons operated at 200 percent of design
capacity for more than a decade. In the 2011 ruling, the high
court said that as many as 54 prisoners had to share a single
toilet and that suicidal inmates had been held in cages the size
of a telephone booth because of a shortage of treatment beds.  In the latest appeal, California’s lawyers argued that the
appellate panel should have considered changes that have been
made in the penal system during the interim.  The case is Brown v. Plata, 13-198.  To contact the reporter on this story:
