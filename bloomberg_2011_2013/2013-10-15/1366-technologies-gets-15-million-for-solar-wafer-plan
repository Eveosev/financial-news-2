1366 Technologies Inc., a supplier
of solar wafers that qualified for a U.S. Energy Department loan
guarantee, raised $15 million in a Series C financing round led
by the Japanese silicon provider  Tokuyama Corp. (4043)   The funds will be used to build a factory that will be able
to produce enough silicon wafers for 250 megawatts of solar
cells a year, the Bedford, Massachusetts-based company said
today in a statement.  Completing the plant will validate the company’s
manufacturing capabilities and may let it access the loan
guarantee, Laureen Sanderson, an external spokeswoman, said in
an e-mail today. The company won approval in 2011 to borrow as
much as $150 million with backing from the Energy Department,
subject to certain conditions that it has yet to meet.  1366 uses technology developed at Massachusetts Institute
of Technology. The “direct wafer” technique lets it produce
silicon wafers for solar cells in a single step, rather than the
conventional process of growing crystal ingots that are sliced
into wafers. That reduces waste, improves efficiency and may cut
production costs in half, the company said.  1366 expects to use the loan guarantee to expand annual
production to as much as 1,000 megawatts. With the new funding,
the company has raised $62 million from venture capital
investors including VantagePoint Capital Partners and Energy
Technology Ventures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
