The cost of insuring corporate bonds
in Australia and  Japan  against non-payment fell, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index dropped 2 basis points to
111.5 basis points as of 11:40 a.m. in Sydney, according to
Deutsche Bank AG prices. The benchmark is poised for its lowest
close since Sept. 19, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index declined 2.5 basis points to
88 as of 8:53 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup Inc. prices.
The measure last closed lower on Sept. 19, according to CMA,
which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by
dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan was little changed at 139 basis points
as of 8:50 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. prices show. The gauge is poised for a 17 basis-point
retreat this month, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
