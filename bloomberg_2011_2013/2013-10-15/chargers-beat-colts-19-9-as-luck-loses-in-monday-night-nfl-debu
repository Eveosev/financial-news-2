The San Diego Chargers defeated the
Indianapolis Colts 19-9 as Nick Novak kicked four field goals,
including a 50-yarder with two minutes left that helped prevent
Andrew Luck from mounting another comeback.  Keenan Allen scored the Chargers’ lone touchdown, catching
a 22-yard scoring pass from Philip Rivers less than three
minutes into the second quarter to give the home team the lead
for good last night at Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego.  Novak added field goals of 31, 33, 34 and 50 yards, the
last coming after the Chargers’ defense forced the Colts to punt
while trailing 16-9 with just over three minutes left. Luck had
nine game-winning drives during the fourth quarter or overtime
in his first 21 National Football League games -- the most by a
quarterback since the 1970 merger -- yet was held without a
touchdown pass in his “Monday Night Football” debut.  “We weren’t great in the red zone offensively, but our
defense was awesome and Nick Novak was awesome,” Rivers, who
passed for 237 yards, said in a televised interview.  The Chargers held an opponent without a touchdown for the
first time since Dec. 12, 2010, to even their record at 3-3.
They also dominated the time of possession, holding the ball for
about 38 1/2 minutes to 21 1/2 for the Colts, who converted only
2-of-10 third-down opportunities.  The Colts fell to 4-2 and head back to Indianapolis for a
Week 7 game against the 6-0 Denver Broncos and Peyton Manning,
who will be making his return to the city in which he spent the
first 14 years of his NFL career.  Luck completed 18 of 30 passes for 202 yards and had his
final pass intercepted with 1 minute, seven seconds remaining.
The Colts were limited to three field goals by Adam Vinatieri.  “They made the plays and we didn’t,” Luck said after
failing to throw a touchdown pass for the second time since
being selected No. 1 in the 2012 draft. “Credit goes to them.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
