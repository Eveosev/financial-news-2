Total SA (FP) , Europe’s biggest refiner,
said third-quarter crude-processing margins shrank to the lowest
level in almost five years as fuel demand continued to slide.  Total earned $10.60 a metric ton, compared with $51 a ton a
year earlier, it said today on its  website . The indicator, which
was $24.10 a ton in the second quarter, has dropped to its
lowest since at least early 2009, according to company  data .  “Refining margins were ugly” in the third quarter,
 Bertrand Hodee , an analyst at Raymond James in Paris, said in a
note. He had previously estimated $12 a ton.  European refiners have suffered a slump in demand after
economies slowed. In response, Total is curbing oil-processing
and petrochemicals operations in the region and expanding in
Asia and the Middle East. The Paris-based company unveiled a
plan last month to shut a steam cracker at its Carling plant in
 France , and has acquired gas stations in Pakistan and  Egypt .  The average European refining margin was 20 euros ($27.01)
a ton in the first six months of 2013, down from 34 euros in
2012, the  Union Francaise des Industries Petrolieres  lobby said
on its website. Oil-product use will drop 5 percent in the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in the
decade through 2020, and grow elsewhere, Total said last month.  The company failed to sell its Lindsey refinery in the U.K.
and fought with the French government in 2010 over a proposal to
shutter a plant at Dunkirk. Strikes against the plan led to
nationwide fuel shortages and forced Total to guarantee not to
shut another French plant for five years.  The company reports third-quarter results on Oct. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
