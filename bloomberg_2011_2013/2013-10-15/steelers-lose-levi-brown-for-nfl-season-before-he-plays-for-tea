The Pittsburgh Steelers placed
tackle Levi Brown on season-ending injured reserve with a torn
triceps muscle before he played a single down for the National
Football League team.  Brown was acquired by the Steelers in an Oct. 2 trade with
the  Arizona Cardinals . He was injured during warm-ups before
Pittsburghâ€™s 19-6 victory over the New York Jets two days ago.  The 6-foot-6, 324-pound Brown was the fifth pick in the
2007 draft and started 79 of 81 games in Arizona.  The Steelers (1-4) also placed  David Johnson , who played
fullback and tight end, on injured reserve with a wrist injury.  To contact the reporter on this story:
