Nexans SA (NEX)  fell the most since
February 2009 after saying it plans to raise 284 million euros
($385 million) from selling shares and cut its full-year
earnings forecast as the world’s second-biggest cable maker
battles overcapacity and increasing competition.  The company, based in Paris, also unveiled plans to cut 468
jobs in  Europe , including 206 in  France , and transfer another
462 positions as it seeks to reduce costs. The stock plunged as
much as 22 percent to 33.15 euros.  Nexans’s full-year operating profit will be 130 million
euros to 150 million euros compared with a July forecast of
about 185 million euros, Chief Financial Officer Nicolas Badre
said on a call with journalists. Nexans said it will probably
post a net loss in the second half due to reorganization costs.  “Markets remain difficult in the cable industry, in
construction and power distribution,” said Pierre Boucheny, an
analyst at Kepler Cheuvreux. “Even if it’s not written in the
statement, it also points to a strong cut in 2015 targets.”  Chief Executive Officer  Frederic Vincent  said in February
that Nexans will seek to boost its operating profit to as much
as 400 million euros in 2015 from 202 million euros in 2012.
He’s seeking to fix production issues at its undersea cables
business, open or upgrade plants in the U.S. and  China  as well
as focus on key markets and cuts costs by 70 million euros by
2017 to regain competitiveness in European high-voltage and
industrial cables.  Strategic Review  The group is currently putting together strategic goals for
2015, to be announced when 2013 results are published, Nexans
said today, adding that it “remains confident in its outlook
for the medium term.”  Most of the restructuring costs will probably be in 2014
and 2015, the CFO said. Excluding the cost of the plan, the
“financial return” from the savings programs should add 48
million euros to earnings in 2015, and 73 million euros in 2017,
the company said today.  The company’s net debt of 734 million euros at the end of
September “is expected to decrease” at the end of the year,
Nexans said. It “could rise” in 2014 because of the company’s
plan to invest 600 million euros over three years, it said. The
estimate doesn’t include a possible antitrust fine by the
European Commission, for which Nexans has provisioned 200
million euros in its accounts, it said.  Flexibility  The capital increase will give Nexans flexibility in the
execution of these initiatives, and strengthen its financial
structure, it said.  “Going into 2014, covenants would have been breached,
hence the capital increase,” Kepler’s Boucheny said.  Chile ’s Grupo Quinenco, which holds 22.5 percent of Nexans
through holding company  Invexans SA (INVEXANS) , has committed to subscribe
to the capital increase, allowing it to hold a minimum of 24.9
percent of the company, Nexans said. BpiFrance, a French
government entity which owns about 5.5 percent of Nexans, plans
to subscribe for the minimum allowed.  Invexans shares fell today 6.8 percent to 11.49 pesos in
Chile, the biggest slump since September 2011.  Each shareholder of Nexans will receive one preferential
subscription right for every share it holds as of the close of
trading on Oct. 16, Nexans said. The subscription price is 22.5
euros per share on the basis of three new shares for seven
existing shares, a 47 percent discount to yesterday’s closing
price.  Nexans shares closed with a 15 percent fall to 36.10 euros
in Paris, giving it a market value of 1.06 billion euros.  Some 12.6 million shares will be issued, and the total
amount of the rights offering could be increased to about 293
million euros if all currently exercisable  stock options  by
Nexans are exercised by Oct. 22, Nexans said.  BNP Paribas is sole global coordinator and joint bookrunner
of the rights issue,  Credit Agricole  is joint bookrunner, and
HSBC Bank Plc. is co-lead manager, Nexans said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
