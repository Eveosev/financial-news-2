Brazil ’s August  retail sales  rose
more than economists forecast for a second consecutive month, as
slower inflation helps revive demand. Swap rates rose.  Sales in August increased 0.9 percent from the previous
month, after jumping a revised 2.1 percent in July, the national
statistics agency said today in Rio de Janeiro. The number was
higher than the 0.2 median  estimate  from 33 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg. Retail sales rose 6.2 percent from the same month
last year, above the median  forecast  of 4.8 percent.  Brazil retail sales are being fueled by slower inflation,
Finance Minister Guido Mantega said on Sept. 12. The central
bank is undertaking the biggest interest-rate raising cycle in
the world in a bid to tame price increases.  Swap rates on the contract maturing in January 2015, the
most traded in Sao Paulo today, rose three basis points to 10.41
percent at 9:16 a.m. local time. The real was little changed at
2.1829 per U.S. dollar.  The broader retail index, which includes cars and
construction materials, rose 0.6 percent from the previous
month, the agency said today. That matches an increase of 0.6
percent last month.  Sales of computers, telecommunications and office equipment
rose 7.6 percent in August, up from a 3.7 increase in July.
Sales of cars, motorcycles and auto parts rose 2.6 percent after
a decline of 3.4 percent the previous month.  GDP Growth  Consumer spending rose 0.3 percent in the second quarter,
rebounding from a contraction in the first quarter, of 0.03
percent. Overall, gross domestic product rose 1.5 percent from
0.6 percent the prior quarter. Economists surveyed by the
central bank forecast 2.5 percent growth this year, from 0.9
percent in 2012.  The central bank has boosted the benchmark Selic rate by
225 basis points since April, to 9.50 percent. It also
implemented a $60 billion program of swaps and credit line
auctions after the real weakened below 2.45 per US dollar in
August. It has since appreciated 11.5 percent, more than any
other major currency tracked by Bloomberg.  Consumer price increases in September continued to slow,
reaching 5.86 percent, the lowest level recorded since December.
Inflation twice breached the 6.5 percent ceiling of the central
bank’s target range this year.  Traders are betting the central bank will raise rates by 50
basis points in its November monetary policy meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
