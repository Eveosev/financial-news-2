(Corrects description of venture in fifth paragraph.)  Aluminum Corporation of China Ltd. ,
the Hong Kong-listed unit of the nation’s largest producer of
the metal, plans to sell its stake in a venture in  Guinea  to a
unit of its parent for about $2.07 billion.  The state-owned company, known as Chalco, announced on
Sept. 30 the sale to its parent of a 65 percent stake in a
venture that mainly invests in the Simandou iron-ore project.
The value of the stake was not disclosed at the time.  The appraisal value of the asset is about $2.07 billion and
the transaction value will be no less than that, the company
said in filings to the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges
yesterday.  Rio Tinto Group, the world’s second-largest mining company,
said last month that the $20 billion Simandou project may start
in 2018 at the earliest, three years behind the initial target,
pending completion of funding. The company is helping Guinea get
financing for its half share of the project’s port and rail.  In 2010, Chalco paid $1.35 billion for a stake in a venture
with  Rio Tinto  that gave it an effective 44.65 percent stake in
the Simandou mine.  It later formed another venture with Baosteel Group Corp.
and other Chinese investors to hold that stake. Chalco is now
selling its holding in the venture with the other Chinese
companies to its parent.  The sale requires approvals from Rio Tinto and the Chinese
government, Chalco said in September.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
