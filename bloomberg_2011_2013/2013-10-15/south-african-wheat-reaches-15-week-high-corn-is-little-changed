Wheat futures traded in South  Africa 
advanced to the highest level in 15 weeks, while corn prices
were little changed.  Wheat for delivery in December rose 0.4 percent to 3,470
rand ($348) a metric ton by the close on the South African
Futures Exchange in Johannesburg. That was the highest price for
a most-active contract since June 27.  South Africa, a net importer of wheat, is sub-Saharan
Africa’s largest producer of the grain after  Ethiopia  and the
region’s biggest buyer after Nigeria and  Sudan , according to
U.S. Department of Agriculture data.  Yellow corn for delivery in December gained 0.1 percent to
2,155.20 rand a ton, while the white variety for the same
delivery month climbed 1 rand to 2,351 rand a ton. A meal made
from white corn is a staple food in South Africa, the
continent’s largest corn producer, and the yellow variety is
mostly fed to animals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
