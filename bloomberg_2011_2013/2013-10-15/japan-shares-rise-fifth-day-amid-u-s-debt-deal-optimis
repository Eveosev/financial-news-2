Japanese  shares  rose, with the Topix
index posting its longest winning streak in three months, as
paper makers surged and amid optimism U.S. lawmakers will reach
a deal to avoid breaching the debt ceiling.  Oji Holdings Corp. climbed the most on the  Nikkei 225  Stock
Average after a report paper manufacturers may sell surplus
electricity.  Sony Corp. (6758) , which gets almost 70 percent of sales
abroad, gained 1 percent. Maeda Corp. jumped 4.2 percent after
Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co. boosted its outlook
on the general contractor. Dowa Holdings Co. sank 5.9 percent
after the metal producer’s profit forecast missed estimates.  The Topix added less than 0.1 percent to close at 1,197.47
in Tokyo. The gauge last capped a five-day advance on July 3.
Volume today was about 28 percent below the 30-day average.  The
Nikkei 225 increased 0.3 percent to 14,441.54. Markets were
closed yesterday for a holiday.  “The market is revolving on optimism that things will
somehow work out,” said  Masaru Hamasaki , a senior strategist at
Tokyo-based Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management Co., which oversees
about 11.2 trillion yen ($114 billion). “If investors’ hopes
are dashed, fear will come to the forefront again and markets
will tumble in a big way. But for now people are generally in
wait-and-see mode.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.1
percent. The measure rose 0.4 percent yesterday, leaving it less
than 1 percent away from a record, amid signs politicians may
reach a deal before the government loses its ability to borrow
money Oct. 17.  Deal Discussions  An agreement being discussed by Democrat and Republican
Senate leaders would suspend the debt limit through Feb. 7 and
fund the government through Jan. 15, according to a person
familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity. A
partial government shutdown began Oct. 1 after Congress failed
to pass a spending authorization bill for the financial year.  Some exporters gained. Sony, the maker of PlayStation
gaming consoles and Bravia TVs, rose 1 percent to 1,938 yen.
Mitsubishi Motors Corp., which gets more than 80 percent of
sales overseas, added 0.8 percent to 1,041 yen.  “It’s beginning to sink in among U.S. political parties
that it’ll be a catastrophe if they don’t reach a deal on the
debt limit, and they’re starting to compromise,” said  Toshihiko Matsuno , a strategist at Tokyo-based SMBC Friend Securities Co.,
a unit of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc.,  Japan ’s second-biggest lender by market value. “In Japan, earnings season is
about to heat up and there’s a lot of optimism companies will
raise their forecasts.”  Earnings Season  Twenty-three companies on the Topix are  due  to report
results this week. Earnings per share on the gauge are  projected 
to jump 56 percent from the previous quarter, according to
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. (7270) , which makes Subaru cars,
climbed 0.8 percent to 2,815 yen, its highest close since July
24. The company may report a 250 percent increase in operating
profit to a record 150 billion yen for the half year through
September, the Nikkei newspaper reported, without saying where
it got the information. Earnings were boosted by a weaker yen
and sales of sport-utility vehicles in Japan and the U.S.,
according to the report.  Maeda advanced 4.2 percent to 673 yen after its shares were
raised to outperform from neutral by Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan
Stanley. Kajima Corp., which was also upgraded to outperform by
the brokerage, gained 1 percent to 403 yen.  Shimizu Corp. (1803) , which
was boosted to neutral from underperform, rose 1.7 percent to
486 yen.  Power Shift  Oji Holdings, Japan’s biggest paper maker by market value,
gained 6.2 percent to 496 yen. Manufacturers in the sector are
moving into electricity retailing ahead of deregulation starting
in 2016, the Nikkei newspaper reported, without citing anyone.
Oji may spend about 30 billion yen by 2015 on generating
facilities to be able to provide about 1.1 billion kilowatt-hours a year, the report said.  Nippon Paper Industries Co., which currently generates
about 17 million kilowatts according to the Nikkei, advanced 4
percent to 1,573 yen.  Among stocks that fell, Dowa Holdings declined 5.9 percent
to 942 yen. The company raised its full-year net income forecast
by 5.6 percent to 19 billion yen. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
had  expected  an increase to 20.4 billion yen.  The Topix traded at 1.25 times  book value  today, compared
with 2.51 for the S&P 500 and 1.75 for the Stoxx Europe 600
Index yesterday. The Japanese gauge’s 30-day  historic volatility 
was at 17.97 today, compared with its five-year median of 19.31.  To contact the reporters on this story:
