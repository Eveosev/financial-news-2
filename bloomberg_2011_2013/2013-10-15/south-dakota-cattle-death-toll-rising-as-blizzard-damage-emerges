The cattle-death toll in  South
Dakota  from a blizzard more than a week ago has topped 6,000,
and officials say the number will increase as more detailed
reports emerge.  Cattle deaths based on voluntary reports reached 6,138 as
of 3 p.m. compared with about 4,000 at the start of the day,
 Dustin Oedekoven , the state veterinarian, said in a telephone
interview from Pierre, South Dakota. The tally probably will
increase because many areas remain without power and some
ranchers have yet to disclose their losses, he said.  The state’s primary goal is the “health of the animals”
that survived the Oct. 3-Oct. 5 storm and the disposal of
carcasses, Oedekoven said. South Dakota had the nation’s sixth-largest  cattle  herd with 3.85 million head in January, according
to U.S. Department of Agriculture data.  As much as 4 feet (1.2 meters) of snow fell in the Black
Hills region, an unseasonably early storm that was deadly for
cattle unable to escape to shelter and had yet to develop their
winter fur, according to  Jodie Anderson , executive director of
the South Dakota Cattlemen’s Association.  “It is devastating” for local ranchers, Lawrence Kane, a
market adviser at Stewart-Peterson Group in  Yates City ,
 Illinois , said in a telephone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
