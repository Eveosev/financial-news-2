Soybeans advanced for a second day
on concern that rains will slow harvests in the U.S., the
world’s largest producer.  The contract for delivery in November gained as much as 0.3
percent to $12.7675 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade,
before trading at $12.7425 at 11:11 a.m. in  Singapore .  Showers may cause some delay in the oilseed harvest in the
U.S. central and eastern parts today and tomorrow, Commodity
Weather Group said in a report e-mailed yesterday. The main
concern is for the pace of soybean and cotton gathering in the
Delta in the next two weeks, it said.  “Rains in the U.S. will likely delay soybean production,
supporting prices,” said  Kazuhiko Saito , chief analyst at
Tokyo-based commodity broker Fujitomi Co. The U.S. and Argentina
are the world’s biggest exporters of the oilseed after  Brazil .  Wheat for delivery in December was little changed at $6.92
a bushel. Corn for delivery in December dropped 0.2 percent to
$4.3625 a bushel, falling for the third day in four. U.S.
production is expected to rise 28 percent to a record this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
