Caesars Entertainment Corp. (CZR)  fell 11
percent, the most in almost a year, after the stock began
trading without rights to participate in an IPO of the company’s
online gambling unit.  Investors who bought the shares today didn’t get rights to
a new unit that will own part of the online gaming division,
Richard Hightower, an analyst at International Strategy &
Investment Group LLC, said in an interview. Those who owned them
yesterday will be able to buy Caesars Acquisition Co. stock.  “You can sell the stock today and settle and still keep”
the subscription rights, John Kempf, an analyst at RBC Capital
Markets in New York, said in an e-mail.  Caesars fell to $19.91 at the close in  New York , the
biggest drop  since  Nov. 14, 2012. The shares have almost tripled
this year as the company set plans for the gambling unit and
restructured some of its $23 billion in debt.  The Las Vegas-based company, owner of the Caesars Palace
casino, along with Harrah’s and Bally’s on the  Las Vegas  Strip,
set Oct. 17 as the record date for investors to participate in
the offering of Caesars Acquisition, which includes the online
gambling business. Caesars, the largest owner of U.S. casinos,
has more debt than any other casino or hotel company. It is
seeking to raise as much as $1.18 billion for the gambling unit.  Caesars Acquisition will own a piece of Caesars’
interactive gaming business as well as two casinos,  Planet
Hollywood  in Las Vegas and a Horseshoe property under
construction in Baltimore, the company said in an Oct. 3
release.  To contact the reporter on this story:
