A former U.S. Army captain who had
openly criticized his superiors for insufficient support in a
2009 battle in  Afghanistan  became the sixth living Medal of
Honor recipient.  President  Barack Obama , in a White House ceremony,
described a “remarkable” video from the Sept. 8, 2009, battle
in Ganjgal, released by the Army. It showed Will Swenson,
helmetless and open to enemy fire, helping a wounded soldier
into a helicopter and kissing his head before going back into
battle.  Obama called it “a simple act of compassion and loyalty to
a brother in arms.”  Swenson, in more than six hours of fighting against 60
insurgents after his initial request for support was denied, led
a team in search of wounded and fallen soldiers, according to
official accounts.  Dakota Meyer, a former Marine who received the Medal of
Honor in 2011 for his actions in the same battle, was among
those questioning why Swenson wasn’t awarded the medal earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
