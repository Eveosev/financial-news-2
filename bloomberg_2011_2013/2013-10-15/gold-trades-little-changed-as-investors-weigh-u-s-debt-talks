Gold rebounded from a three-month
low after negotiations stalled in the Senate on ending a U.S.
government shutdown and preventing a default, boosting demand
for the metal as a haven.  Senator  Dianne Feinstein , a California Democrat, said talks
fell apart, and the Senate needs to “vote on what we believed
our agreement was.” Without an agreement on the debt ceiling,
U.S. borrowing authority lapses on Oct. 17, and the 15-day
government shutdown continues. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
fell as much as 0.8 percent.  “Safe-haven bids are coming in for gold as the debt
ceiling worries are gripping everyone,” Phil Streible, a senior
commodity broker at R.J. O’Brien & Associates in  Chicago , said
in a telephone interview. “Investors are very nervous and are
in a ‘risk-off’ mode.”  Gold for immediate delivery rose 0.7 percent to $1,281.80
an ounce at 3:30 p.m.  New York  time. Earlier, the price fell as
much as 1.6 percent to $1,251.85, the lowest since July 10.  On the Comex in New York, gold futures for December
delivery fell 0.3 percent to close at $1,273.20 at 1:43 p.m. In
electronic trading, the price rose as much as 0.9 percent from
yesterday’s settlement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
