Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
Shanghai were little changed as China’s steel output climbed and
iron ore prices increased.  Rebar for delivery in January on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange was at 3,628  yuan  ($594) a metric ton at 10:21 a.m.
local time from 3,625 yuan yesterday. Prices earlier climbed to
3,636 yuan, the highest level since Sept. 25.  China’s average daily crude steel output rose to 2.15
million tons in late September from 2.14 million tons in mid-September, Shanghai-based Xiben New Line said in a statement on
its website, citing data from the China Iron & Steel
Association.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port
gained 0.4 percent yesterday to $133.60 a dry ton, according to
a  price index  compiled by The Steel Index Ltd.  “Investors are cautious with higher raw-material prices
and increased supply,” said Wang Yongliang, an analyst at
Beijing Cifco Futures Co. in Tianjin.  China’s Dalian Commodity Exchange will start trading the
country’s first  iron ore  futures for physical delivery on Oct.
18, the bourse said in a statement on its website yesterday.  The  spot price  of rebar rose 0.3 percent yesterday to 3,518
yuan, according to Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
