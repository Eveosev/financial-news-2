The  New York Jets  signed former
Cleveland Browns wide receiver and kick returner Josh Cribbs,
whose eight kickoff returns for touchdowns are tied for the most
in National Football League history.  Cribbs, 30, is a three-time Pro Bowl selection who played
with the Browns from 2005 through 2012. He underwent knee
surgery during the offseason.  The Jets have been without receiver  Santonio Holmes  for the
past two games because of foot and hamstring injuries and today
placed wide receiver and kick returner Clyde Gates on season-ending injured reserve with an undisclosed shoulder injury. The
Jets also said running back Mike Goodson will miss the rest of
the season with a knee injury.  Gates had 12 receptions this season and was the Jets’ top
kickoff returner, averaging 23.2 yards. Cribbs has averaged 25.9
yards on 387 career NFL kick returns and has totaled 11
touchdowns on kickoff and punt returns. He had a career-high 41
receptions for 518 yards and four scores with the Browns during
the 2011 season.  The Jets also signed receiver Greg Salas, a fourth-round
draft pick of the  St. Louis Rams  in the 2011 draft, to their
active roster.  To contact the reporter on this story:
