Cerberus Capital Management LP, the
private-equity firm that focuses on distressed assets, signed a
nondisclosure agreement with  BlackBerry Ltd. (BB) , gaining access to
financial information it could use to formulate a bid for the
smartphone maker, said a person with knowledge of the situation.  The firm is in the early stages of considering an offer to
acquire all of BlackBerry, said the person, who asked not to be
identified because the deliberations are private. Cerberus may
still choose not to proceed with a deal.  Peter Duda , a spokesman
for New York-based Cerberus, declined to comment, as did Adam
Emery, a spokesman for Waterloo, Ontario-based BlackBerry.  Cerberus views BlackBerry as a viable turnaround business,
rather than a set of assets to be sold off piecemeal, said the
person. A Cerberus bid would bring competition to  Fairfax
Financial Holdings Ltd. (FFH) , BlackBerry’s largest shareholder, which
made a tentative offer on Sept. 23 to buy the company for $4.7
billion. BlackBerry co-founders  Mike Lazaridis  and Doug Fregin
also said last week that they’re considering their own takeover.  BlackBerry shares  rose 0.1 percent to $8.15 at the close in
 New York . The stock has fallen 31 percent this year.  BlackBerry put itself up for sale in August after years of
losing ground in the smartphone market to Apple Inc. and Samsung
Electronics Co. The company posted a 45 percent plunge in sales
last quarter and a $965 million loss, dragged down by unsold
inventory of its latest phones.  Financing Question  While Fairfax is the only prospective buyer to actually put
a price on BlackBerry, the Toronto-based firm hasn’t announced
the other partners in its investment group or shown that it has
financing. That’s raised concerns that Fairfax’s $9-a-share
offer won’t actually materialize, sending the shares almost 10
percent below the bid price.  Lazaridis, who invented the BlackBerry phone and served as
co-chief executive officer until last year, has hired Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. to help him explore a buyout -- though that
deal is even less concrete.  If Cerberus pushes to keep BlackBerry whole, it would
contrast with growing sentiment that a breakup is likely.
Alberta Investment Management Corp. CEO Leo de Bever, whose firm
has considered joining a bid for BlackBerry, said this month
that potential buyers are struggling to craft takeover proposals
for the whole company.  “It doesn’t necessarily mean that we want to take a
carving knife to BlackBerry,” he said in an interview. “The
odds are that’s what’s probably going to happen.”  Chrysler Deal  Cerberus would bring expertise dealing with troubled
companies. The firm, which  manages  more than $20 billion in
assets, invested in automaker Chrysler in 2007 and led a group
that acquired grocery-store chains from  Supervalu Inc. (SVU)  earlier
this year.  Some of Cerberus’s investments have been difficult to turn
around. In 2005, the firm agreed to pay $2.3 billion for
NewPage, which makes coated covers for magazines. NewPage filed
for bankruptcy in 2011 as it struggled with a shift of readers
online. Cerberus’s investment in  Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY) , which was
then known as GMAC Inc., suffered from the sluggish economy and
its holding was diluted by a government rescue plan.  A BlackBerry deal wouldn’t be Cerberus’s first foray into
 Canada . In 2004, the firm invested about $190 million in Air
Canada, the country’s biggest airline, which was in  bankruptcy
protection  at the time. Cerberus then put $1.05 billion into a
U.S. real estate portfolio owned by Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce in the depths of the financial crisis in 2008.  BlackBerry’s Emery said his company wouldn’t be discussing
further developments “until we approve a specific transaction
or otherwise conclude the review of strategic alternatives.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
