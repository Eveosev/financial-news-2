Banco Bradesco SA (BBD) ’s health insurance
unit has agreed to increase its stake in  Odontoprev SA (ODPV3)  to more
than half by purchasing 6.5 percent of the dental benefits
provider’s voting shares from founder Randal Zanetti.  Bradesco Saude SA didn’t disclose how much it is paying for
the stock. Zanetti has stepped down as Odontoprev’s chief
executive officer and will become its vice-chairman, the dental
benefits company said in a regulatory filing yesterday after the
close of trading. The transaction, which would increase the
insurer’s stake to 50.01 percent, needs to be approved by the
central bank, according to the filing.  “The shares were bought at a price very similar to
market’s price these days,” Marco Antonio Rossi, president of
Bradesco Seguros e Previdencia SA, which is Bradesco Saude’s
controlling shareholder, said in a conference call with analysts
today.  Rossi said there’s no need to extend the offering to
minority shareholders because “Bradesco was already
Odontoprev’s controlling shareholder. There was no change in the
company’s controlling block.”  Odontoprev’s shares slumped 5.6 percent to 9.36 reais at
12:49 p.m. in  Sao Paulo , the worst performance on the
BM&FBovespa Small Cap index, which slipped 0.2 percent.  Banco
Bradesco  fell 0.2 percent to 32.17 reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
