Apple Inc. (AAPL)  sent invitations to a
product event next week in San Francisco, where it is set to
introduce an update to its iPad lineup  The Oct. 22 function will start at 10 a.m. local time at
the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts Theater in San Francisco,
Cupertino, California-based Apple said today in a note to
members of the media. The venue is where Apple has held many
previous product introductions.  Apple, which last month unveiled two iPhone models, is
introducing a batch of new products ahead of the holiday
shopping season. Next week’s event will include an update to the
iPad mini with a high-definition screen, as well as design
changes to make the larger iPad thinner, people with knowledge
of the plans have said. Apple also is expected to show its Mac
software upgrade, called Mavericks, as well as a revamped Mac
Pro high-end computer.  “We still have a lot to cover,” Apple said in the
invitation.  In the absence of a new iPad, the tablet market shrank in
the second quarter, suggesting pent-up demand for the new
models. Global tablet unit sales fell 9.7 percent to 45.1
million, with iPad shipments falling to 14.6 million units from
19.5 million in the first quarter, according to researcher IDC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
