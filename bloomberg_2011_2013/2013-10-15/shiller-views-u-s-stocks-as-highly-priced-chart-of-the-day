U.S. stocks are vulnerable to losses
because they are the most expensive relative to earnings in more
than five years, according to Robert J. Shiller, a co-winner of
this year’s  Nobel Prize  in Economic Sciences.  The CHART OF THE DAY tracks Shiller’s cyclically adjusted
price-earnings ratio, which compares the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index with companies’ average profits during the past 10 years.
The ratio ended last month at 23.7, the highest since January
2008, according to  data  available from his website.  “The stock market is rather highly priced,” he said
yesterday during a press conference at  Yale University  in  New
Haven , Connecticut, where he serves as a professor of economics
and finance. “I worry that it might correct down.”  Even so, the September ratio was lower than a peak of 27.5
in May 2007 -- and even further below a record of 44.2, set in
December 1999. Shiller’s price-earnings figures begin in 1881,
and the chart shows them since 1900.  “I don’t think one should view it with alarm,” he said
about the most recent reading for the gauge, known as CAPE.
“One could well -- and probably should, in a diversified
portfolio -- invest in stocks.”  Shiller developed the cyclically adjusted ratio with a
Harvard University professor, John Y. Campbell. He shared the
Nobel with two University of Chicago professors, Eugene F. Fama
and Lars Peter Hansen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
