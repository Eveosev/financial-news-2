Billionaire hedge-fund manager
 Steven A. Cohen , whose firm is facing huge fines for  securities
fraud , will sell three paintings from his art collection at
auction in New York next month.  The group will include two pieces by  Andy Warhol  and a
 Gerhard Richter , according to the New York Times. Cohen’s $9
billion net worth includes an art collection valued at about
$750 million, according to Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index.  Cohen’s SAC Capital Advisors LP is accused in a grand jury
indictment of  insider trading . Last week, the company was told
it would have to pay $1.8 billion and admit wrongdoing to
resolve securities-fraud charges. Cohen has already agreed to
pay $600 million.  His three works will be offered at Sotheby’s contemporary
art sale on Nov. 13. Warhol’s 1963 “Liz #1 (Early Colored
Liz)” is estimated at $20 million to $30 million. His “5
Deaths on Turquoise (Turquoise Disaster),” also from 1963, is
valued at $7 million to $10 million.  Sotheby’s (BID)  showed the
paintings as part of its exhibition at the Katara Art Center in
Doha last week.  The Richter is a 1986, 10-by-8-foot abstract painting
titled “A. B. Courbet,” according to a person familiar with
the matter. It is estimated at $15 million to $20 million.  Cohen actively buys and sells in the art market. In May
2011, another Warhol Liz portrait from his collection fetched
$26.9 million at Phillips. Cohen’s 1983 Richter canvas,
“Prag,” was less successful; estimated at $9 million to $12
million, it failed to sell at Christie’s in November 2012.  Other Warhols  Cohen will face fierce competition from 12 other Warhols at
the November evening sales, led at Sotheby’s by the large 1963
canvas “Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster),” estimated at more
than $60 million.  A smaller “Green Car Crash -- Green Burning Car I” (1963)
has been the artist’s record since 2007 when it sold for $71.7
million.  Christie’s seven lots on Nov. 12 include Warhol’s 1962
painting of an oversized Coke bottle, estimated at $40 million
to $60 million.  To contact the reporters of this story:
