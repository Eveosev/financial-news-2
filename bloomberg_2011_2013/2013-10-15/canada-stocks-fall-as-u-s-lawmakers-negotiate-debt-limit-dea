Canadian  stocks  fell, after posting
the biggest weekly gain in a month, as industrial and consumer
shares retreated amid political brinkmanship in the U.S. over
extending the government’s ability to borrow.  Canadian National Railway Co. dropped 0.8 percent after the
Teamsters Canada union threatened to strike over contract talks.
North West Co. and Metro Inc. each slid 1.6 percent as producers
of consumer staples lost the most as a group. Toronto-Dominion
Bank slipped 0.7 percent to pace declines among Canada’s largest
lenders.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  fell 14.76
points, or 0.1 percent, to 12,877.35 at 10:14 a.m. in Toronto.
Canadian markets were closed yesterday for the Thanksgiving
holiday. The gauge advanced 1.1 percent last week.  Senate leaders are considering a bipartisan plan to end the
government shutdown and increase the federal borrowing limit
that is expected to be reached Oct. 17.  House Republicans  are
planning to vote tonight on a proposal designed as an
alternative to the Senate bill.  To contact the reporter on this story:
