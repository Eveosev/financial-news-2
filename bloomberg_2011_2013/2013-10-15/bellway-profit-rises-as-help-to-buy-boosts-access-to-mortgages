Bellway Plc (BWY)  said annual profit rose
37 percent as the U.K. homebuilder benefited from an increase in
borrowing sparked by the government’s Help to Buy loan-guarantee
program. The shares rose to the highest in about two months.  Net income for the 12 months through July climbed to 108.6
million pounds ($174 million), or 89.3 pence a share, from 79.3
million pounds, or 65.5 pence, a year earlier, the Newcastle,
England-based company said today in a statement. Revenue
advanced 11 percent to 1.11 billion pounds.  “Help to Buy acted as a catalyst for underlying consumer
demand and helped increase our sales values,” Chief Executive
Officer Ted Ayres said by phone.  The government last week introduced the second phase of
Help to Buy, which offers mortgage guarantees that allow buyers
to make down payments as low as 5 percent. The first phase,
which began in April, provided interest-free loans for buyers of
newly built homes who meet certain income qualifications.  The program has contributed to the most buoyant housing
market since the financial crisis, even as two thirds of 31
economists surveyed by Bloomberg described it as “bad” policy.
The government’s measure won’t cause a bubble, Ayres said,
echoing comments made by the EY Item Club, a London-based group
sponsored by Ernst & Young LLP, in a report yesterday.  “Outside of London we’re still seeing pricing relatively
flat -- we’re achieving what we anticipated in our valuations.”
Ayres said.  Higher Prices  Bellway sold 5,652 homes in fiscal 2013, up from 5,226 a
year earlier, according to today’s statement. The average
selling price increased to 193,025 pounds from 186,648 pounds.  “The results are up against weak comparisons from previous
years and now come with very, very heavy use of stimulus,”  Mark Hughes , an analyst at  Panmure Gordon & Co. (PMR) , said by phone. Other
U.K. homebuilders are also expected to report “exceptional”
sales figures, he said.  Bellway gained as much as 4.6 percent to 1,449 pence in
London trading, the highest since Aug. 19. The shares have
climbed 38 percent this year, while the Bloomberg U.K.
Homebuilder Index is up 48 percent, led by  Telford Homes Plc. (TEF)   Telford’s earnings for fiscal 2014 are expected to be
significantly higher than analysts’ estimates because of
“substantially improved margins”, the Hertfordshire, England-based company said in a statement today without giving any
figures.  The homebuilder climbed as much as 8.4 percent to 335.25
pence, the highest since 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
