Huaneng Renewables Corp. (958) , a Chinese
wind-farm operator, plans to raise HK$1.58 billion ($204
million) from a share sale.  The company will issue about 582.3 million shares at
HK$2.71 apiece, according to a Hong Kong stock exchange filing.
Net proceeds, excluding fees, will be HK$1.55 billion.  The placement price is 7.5 percent lower than the closing
price on Oct. 11. Credit Suisse (Hong Kong) Ltd. is the sole
share sale manager.  Huaneng Renewables joins  China Longyuan Power Group Corp. (916) ,
the nation’s biggest wind project developer, in issuing equity.
China Longyuan raised HK$2.91 billion from a share placement in
December. Huaneng Renewables’ sale will account for about 16.7
percent of its H shares after completion, the company said.  The sale is “far lower in terms of dilution” and “far
higher in terms of the issuance price” than expected, analysts
led by  Michael Parker  at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. wrote in a
note to clients today.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
