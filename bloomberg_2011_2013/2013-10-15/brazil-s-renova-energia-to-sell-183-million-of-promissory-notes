Renova Energia SA (RNEW11) , the Brazilian
wind-farm developer, may sell as much as 400 million reais ($183
million) of promissory notes to finance new power plants.  The notes will pay the Brazil interbank lending rate known
as CDI plus 0.98 percent and will mature after 180 days, Sao
Paulo-based Renova Energia said in a regulatory filing
yesterday.  The company received contracts to sell energy from the
planned wind farms in two auctions in 2010 and 2011, according
to the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
