Citic Pacific Ltd. (267)  won a court order
barring Clive Palmer’s Mineralogy Pty from halting the
development of Australia’s biggest magnetite iron-ore project
over a royalty dispute.  Western Australia Supreme Court Justice James Edelman
granted the application by Citic Pacific’s Sino Iron Pty and
Korean Steel Pty yesterday. He criticized Mineralogy for wasting
time and money after it accused them of default for failing to
pay A$287,000 ($273,370) in royalties and claimed the right to
suspend and terminate mining rights and leases.  Citic Pacific has spent about A$7 billion and employs as
many as 2,800 people on the project on Palmer’s property,
Edelman wrote. Mineralogy stands to lose A$15,000 to A$25,000
from the alleged default on the royalty payment, the judge said.  “The legal fees on this application must have vastly
exceeded the potential loss to Mineralogy,” Edelman wrote.
“The progression towards a final hearing has now been delayed
by the considerable time, expense and resources which have
necessarily been devoted to this application.”  Steve Connolly, a spokesman for Palmer, didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mailed request for comment sent after regular
business hours in Sydney.  Citic Pacific said in an e-mailed statement it will
continue “to take all necessary steps to protect our investment
in this project.”  The case is Mineralogy Pty v. Sino Iron Pty. CIV1808/2013.
