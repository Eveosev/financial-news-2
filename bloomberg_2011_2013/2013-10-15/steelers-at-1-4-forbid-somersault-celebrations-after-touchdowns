The Pittsburgh Steelers won’t be
celebrating touchdowns with somersaults any longer.  Two days after the Steelers (1-4) beat the  New York  Jets
19-6 for their first win of the season, coach  Mike Tomlin  said
he’s put a stop to the flips. Steelers wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders did a forward flip into the end zone and landed on his
back as he scored the game’s only touchdown on a 55-yard catch.  In the Steelers’ previous game, rookie running back Le’Veon
Bell somersaulted into the end zone after scoring his first
National Football League touchdown.  “It’s a potential for injury,” Tomlin said at a news
conference. “It’s silly.”  The Steelers host the Super Bowl-champion Baltimore Ravens
this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
