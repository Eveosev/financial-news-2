The owners of Onduline SA, a French
maker of roofing materials, are expected to name advisers to
explore a sale of the company, two people with knowledge of the
situation said.  Buyout firms Astorg Partners and Abenex Capital SAS,
Onduline’s Paris-based owners, are interviewing investment banks
and plan to begin an auction process early next year, said the
people, who asked not to be named because the talks are private.  Onduline may fetch as much as 450 million euros ($610
million), based on a multiple of eight times the company’s 55
million euros in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization in 2012, the people said. The Rouen, France-based company, which has 1,700 employees and operates 11
production sites globally, according to its website, gets 40
percent of its revenue from Russia and  Turkey , said one person.  Founded in 1944, Onduline was purchased by Astorg and
Abenex in 2006 for an undisclosed sum. The buyout firms invested
65 million euros in the company to reduce its debt the following
year and bought Texas-based roofer Tallant Industries Inc. in
2010 for an undisclosed sum.  Robert Amady, a spokesman for Astorg in Paris, declined to
comment. Spokesmen for Abenex and Onduline didn’t respond to e-mail requests for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
