The U.S. is expected to overtake
 Saudi Arabia  as the world biggest total supplier of oil this
year when natural gas liquids and biofuels are added to crude,
PIRA Energy Group said.  The U.S. is projected to produce an average of 12.1 million
barrels a day of liquids in 2013, 300,000 barrels a day higher
than Saudi Arabia and 1.6 million more than Russia, according to
data presented at PIRA’s Retainer Client Seminar Oct. 10 and
Oct. 11 in  New York .  The U.S. position has improved because of surging “shale
oil” output, the New York-based energy consultant said. The
combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, or
fracking, has unlocked supplies in shale formations in the
central part of the country. Shale liquids output has climbed
3.2 million barrels a day in the last four years, the biggest
gain since Saudi Arabia raised production between 1970 and 1974.  “This isn’t a big surprise but notable all the same,”
said  Michael Lynch , president of Strategic Energy & Economic
Research in Winchester,  Massachusetts . “This is another sign of
the successful story that is horizontal drilling.”  The U.S. is forecast to pump 7.4 million barrels a day of
crude and condensate, 2.5 million of natural gas liquids and 1
million of biofuels, according to PIRA. It also counted almost
1.3 million of “refinery gains,” a measure of the ability of
refineries to optimize output through high-conversion
capabilities.  Saudi Arabia  Saudi Arabia and Russia pump about 3 million barrels a day
more crude oil than the U.S., PIRA said.  Total U.S. liquids supply is projected to climb 1 million
barrels in 2013, about the same as last year’s growth, PIRA
said. This is greater than the sum of the next nine fastest-growing countries combined and has covered most global demand
gain over the past two years.  U.S. liquids output will probably rise faster than that in
Saudi Arabia and  Russia  until after 2020 and the nation should
maintain the lead through 2030, according to PIRA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
