Rising charter school enrollments
may hurt credit ratings at public education systems in poor U.S.
cities, according to a Moody’s Investors Service report.  Cleveland, Detroit, Washington,  St. Louis  and  Kansas City ,
Missouri, where more than one in five students are enrolled in
 charter schools , have already seen significant movement from
public grade schools and high schools, according to a statement
today from Moody’s. Nationwide, about one in 20 students are
signed up at charter schools, the report said.  Charter schools have thrived in some older cities where
shrinking tax revenues have hurt services, including education,
according to the report by Moody’s analysts Michael D’Arcy and
Tiphany Lee-Allen. Charter schools can pull students and
revenues away from districts faster than their systems can
reduce costs, the authors said.  “Districts may face institutional barriers to cutting
staff levels, capital footprints and benefit costs over the
short term given the intricacies of collective bargaining
contracts -- leaving them with underutilized buildings and
ongoing growth in personnel costs,” Lee-Allen said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
