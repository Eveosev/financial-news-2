CSX Corp. (CSX) , the biggest railroad in
the eastern U.S., boosted its full-year profit forecast as crude
oil volumes and shipments of intermodal freight climbed in the
third quarter.  The shares  jumped  as much as 6.4 percent in extended
trading after Jacksonville, Florida-based CSX said earnings per
share for 2013 will be “slightly up” from 2012. Previously,
the company said profit would be “roughly flat.”  Shipments of cargo that can be carried by train, truck or
ship are CSX’s “greatest opportunity” for growth, Chief
Financial Officer Fredrik Eliasson said at a meeting with
analysts and investors last month. Intermodal volumes rose 6
percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, CSX  said 
today. Chemical carloads that include crude climbed 12 percent.  “The third quarter performance is an ongoing reflection of
the company’s ability to capitalize on the modest improvement in
the economy” and rising operating efficiency, Chief Executive
Officer  Michael Ward  said in the statement.            Net income in the third quarter rose 1.8 percent to $463 
million, or 46 cents a share, from $455 million, or 44 cents, 
a year earlier, CSX said today. Analysts projected 43 cents, 
the average of 25 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  CSX rose 1 percent to $26.35 at 4:53 p.m. in  New York ,
after reaching as high as $27.78. The shares closed at $26.10 in
regular trading, extending their 2013 gain to 32 percent. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 19 percent.  CSX was the first major U.S. railroad to report third-quarter earnings.  Union Pacific Corp. (UNP) , the biggest carrier, is
scheduled to release results on Oct. 17, followed by  Kansas City
Southern (KSU)  the following day and  Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC)  on Oct.
23.  Norfolk Southern and CSX compete for rail freight in the
eastern U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
