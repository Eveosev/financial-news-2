Rufus Norris will be the director of
the U.K.’s  National Theatre  from April 2015, the theater said at
a news conference this morning.  Norris, 47, will replace Nicholas Hytner, 57, who announced
earlier this year that he’s leaving in March 2015, when “it will
be time to give someone else a turn.” He has been running the
institution for the last decade.  Hytner had set out to bring the best artists and works to 
the theater, Norris said. “I'd like to cast the net wider, in 
different ways,” he said. “Hopefully I'll bring fresh energy to 
it and build on the success that this institution is.”  Norris grew up in Africa and  Malaysia , and has been an 
associate director at the National Theatre since 2011.  He directed “London Road” at the theater in 2011-12, and 
“Table” at the NT's temporary Shed space this year.  Norris said he aimed to attract more young audiences to 
the theater, as well as make sure it was gender-balanced and 
culturally diverse. He described himself as “very 
collaborative” and said, “I don't care where the best ideas
come from as long as they keep coming.”  Muse highlights include  Richard Vines  on food,  Amanda
Gordon’s  Scene Last Night,  Jorg von Uthmann  on Paris art and
 Scott Reyburn  on the art market.  To contact the writer on the story:
