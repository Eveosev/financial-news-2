Hindalco Industries Ltd. (HNDL)  headed for
its biggest decline in nearly three months in Mumbai as the
nation’s top investigating agency registered a case related to
allocation of coal blocks against the company and its
billionaire owner Kumar Mangalam Birla.  India’s second-largest aluminum and copper  producer  fell as
much as 5 percent, the most since July 26, to 105 rupees and
traded at 108.40 rupees as of 10:21 a.m. in Mumbai.  Aditya Birla
Nuvo Ltd. (ABNL) , also owned by Birla, fell 3.3 percent to 1,222.95
rupees. The benchmark S&P BSE Sensex fell 0.3 percent.  The Central Bureau of Investigation, or CBI, is conducting
searches in the cities of Mumbai, New Delhi, Hyderabad and
Bhubaneswar and has also registered a case against former coal
secretary P.C. Parakh, CBI spokeswoman Kanchan Prasad said in a
phone interview. The group hasn’t received notice of a case
against Hindalco or its owner, spokeswoman Pragnya Ram said.  The CBI is probing companies after the nation’s auditor in
August 2012 said the allocation of coal mines without an auction
had cost the government 1.86 trillion rupees ($30.2 billion).
The Comptroller & Auditor General of India said the award of the
mines gave undue benefit to companies including  Jindal Steel &
Power Ltd. (JSP) , India’s third-largest steelmaker by value, and  Tata
Steel Ltd. (TATA)   To contact the reporter on this story:
