Spain  sold 12-month bills at the
lowest yield since April 2010, the month  Greece  asked for the
first European sovereign bailout.  The Treasury in Madrid said it sold 3.75 billion euros
($5.1 billion) of 12-month bills at an average yield of 0.961
percent. It also sold 817 million euros of six-month bills for a
total of 4.57 billion euros, exceeding the maximum target of 4.5
billion euros. Demand at the auction was 2.74 times the amount
sold.  Foreign investors are returning to Spanish assets, allowing
the Treasury to sell its first new 30-year bond since 2009 this
month, as concerns over a euro breakup or default across the
region’s periphery ease. Ireland and Spain are set to exit their
European aid programs soon, European finance chiefs said late
yesterday, adding to optimism the region may be emerging from
its debt crisis.  Spain expects to conclude its bank-aid program on time at
the end of the year after drawing 41.3 billion euros of a 100
billion-euro  credit line  granted by the euro rescue fund,
Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said yesterday. The economy
probably exited its second recession since 2008 in the third
quarter, the government forecasts.  Still, Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  is battling to bring
the  budget deficit  in line with EU limits and the  International
Monetary Fund  expects the jobless rate to remain above 25
percent until 2018.  To contact the reporter on this story:
