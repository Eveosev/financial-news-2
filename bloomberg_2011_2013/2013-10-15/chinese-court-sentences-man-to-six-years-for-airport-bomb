A Chinese court sentenced a
wheelchair-bound man to six years in prison for detonating a
homemade bomb at Beijing’s main airport, an act he committed to
protest what he said was a  beating by police  in 2005.  Ji Zhongxing was jailed for “causing an explosion in a
public place,” the official Xinhua News Agency said, citing the
Chaoyang District People’s Court. Ji lost his hand in the July
20 blast while a police officer suffered minor injuries.  Ji’s case drew attention to the plight of Chinese
petitioners who believe their grievances against authorities go
ignored. He lost a lawsuit in the southern city of Dongguan in
2008 over his alleged beating, which he said damaged his spine
and left him in a wheelchair. Dongguan police later paid him
100,000  yuan  ($16,382) in humanitarian assistance, the People’s
Daily said in July.  Ji detonated the bomb at the Beijing Capital International
Airport after handing out leaflets that read “paying off old
scores,” Xinhua reported, citing the court. He received a
lesser sentence because he warned people before the bomb went
off and he confessed, Xinhua said.  The Public Security Bureau in  Guangdong province  said in
July it would reopen an investigation into Ji’s allegations that
he was beaten when he dropped off a passenger from his
motorcycle taxi on June 28, 2005, the  China Daily  reported at
the time. Police said he sustained his injuries when he collided
with a policeman and fell off his motorcycle.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
