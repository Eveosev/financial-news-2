(Corrects largest unsecured creditor in fourth paragraph of
story published yesterday.)  Savient Pharmaceuticals Inc. (SVNT) , the
developer of a treatment for gout, sought  bankruptcy protection 
and court approval to sell its assets to a US WorldMeds LLC unit
for $55 million, the company said.  Savient had $260 million in debt and $74 million in assets,
according to a filing today in bankruptcy court in Wilmington,
Delaware. An agreement with Sloan Holdings CV, a unit of
Louisville, Kentucky-based US WorldMeds, calls for Sloan to
acquire most of Savient, including the gout drug Krystexxa, for
$55 million under a court-supervised auction process, Savient
said in a statement.  The Sloan offer sets the floor for the auction,
Bridgewater, New Jersey-based Savient said. The company’s
largest shareholder is Palo Alto Investors LLC, which owns 15
percent of Savient common stock, followed by  Franklin Templeton ,
with 8 percent, and Wellington Management Co. with 7 percent,
according to a court filing.  Holders of $145 million of notes are Savient’s largest
unsecured creditor, according to the filing.  As many as 6 million people in the U.S. suffer from gout, a
type of arthritis in which deposits of uric acid build up around
joints, causing pain, swelling and stiffness, according to the
National Institutes of Health.  The case is In Re Savient Pharmaceuticals, 13-12680,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
