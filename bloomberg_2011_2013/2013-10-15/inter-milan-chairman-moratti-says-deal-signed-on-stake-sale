Massimo Moratti, chairman of the FC
Internazionale Milano soccer club, said he’s signed final
documents for the sale of the team.  In comments to reporters posted on the team’s website,
Moratti said a statement will be released soon. He didn’t give
additional details nor identify the buyer.  Moratti said Sept. 20 that he was discussing a sale of the
team to Indonesian businessman Erick Thohir. Italian newspapers
including  Corriere Della Sera  have reported previously that the
Moratti family was negotiating the sale of a 70 percent stake to
Thohir.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
