A bomb placed inside a microphone at
a mosque in eastern  Afghanistan  killed a provincial governor and
wounded 18 others during prayers to mark the Muslim holiday of
Eid al-Adha, local official said.  Arsala Jamal, governor of Logar province, was killed while
delivering a speech in the mosque, Din Mohammad Darwish, the
province’s spokesman, said by phone. The bomb had been
“masterly” placed inside the microphone and it exploded after
the governor began talking, he said.  The attack comes as the war-torn country prepares for
elections next year as the U.S. seeks a deal with President
 Hamid Karzai  to keep some troops in the nation after 2014. The
Taliban, which is fighting U.S. troops and views Karzai as
illegitimate, vowed last month to disrupt the election with
targeted assassinations.  “Today’s violence increases the fears and intimidations of
Afghans and it will lead to less participation of people,”
Jawid Kohistani, a Kabul-based political and security analyst,
said by phone.  Karzai and U.S. Secretary of State  John Kerry  have said
they are close to completing a security agreement that would
allow some U.S. troops to stay in Afghanistan beyond 2014. Any
agreement must be approved by both Afghanistan’s parliament and
a council of elders called a Loya Jirga.  Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar warned of “grave
consequences” for the U.S. and its allies if the agreement is
signed, according to a statement sent to reporters yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
