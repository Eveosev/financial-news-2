The ruble strengthened for the first
time in three days as  Russia ’s monthly tax period began and
after the central bank kept interest rates unchanged.  The ruble gained 0.3 percent against Bank Rossii’s target
basket of dollars and euros to 37.3678 at 1:43 p.m. in Moscow.
The yield on the government’s February 2027 bonds dropped one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.72 percent.  The central bank left its main lending rate unchanged
yesterday as Chairman  Elvira Nabiullina  prioritizes curbing
inflation over boosting economic growth. Companies start paying
900 billion rubles ($28 billion) of duties today, which should
provide support for the ruble, according to Danske Bank S/A in
Helsinki.  “The key message remained intact: the regulator is
comfortable with sacrificing growth for the good of lower
inflation expectations,” Maxim Korovin and Anton Nikitin, VTB
Capital analysts in Moscow, said in an e-mailed report today.  Bank Rossii kept the one-week auction rate, its benchmark
introduced last month, at 5.5 percent. While policy makers
removed a phrase from the accompanying statement about rates
being appropriate for the “nearest future,” a reduction will
probably come no sooner than the first quarter of next year,
according to VTB.  Consumer-price growth slowed as of Oct. 7 to 6 percent --
the top end of the central bank’s target range for this year --
while the “pace of economic growth remained low,” the
regulator said.  The ruble gained less than 0.1 percent against the dollar
to 32.2640 and appreciated 0.5 percent versus the euro to
43.5900.  To contact the reporter on this story:
