California ’s  Sacramento  County will
issue about $110 million in pension-obligation bonds this week
as sales of such securities drop to the lowest since 2010.  Sacramento County, home to the state capital and 1.5
million residents, will refinance variable-rate pension debt
sold in 2004 in a sale set for Oct. 16. The new fixed-rate bonds
will save the county $50 million, said debt officer Chris Marx.
The taxable securities mature in 2025.  “It’s really the last planned action in our measured
approach to reduce the risk in our debt portfolio,” Marx said
in a phone interview. She said the county, which has about $977
million in pension debt, doesn’t plan to issue more.  The offering is among $6.7 billion of long-term municipal
issues scheduled for this week as benchmark yields are the
highest since Sept. 23, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
total is up from $4.6 billion last week. Individuals pulled
about $729 million from muni-focused mutual funds in the week
through Oct. 9, according to Lipper US Fund Flows data.  Sacramento County must contribute more than $200 million to
its pension system in fiscal 2014, a 391 percent increase from a
decade ago, deal documents show.  Stockton’s Woes  U.S. localities have sold $300 million of bonds to fund
retirement plans this year, the least since 2010, when issuance
was $100 million, Bloomberg data show. A 2010 review of such
bonds by the Center for Retirement Research at  Boston College 
showed most lose money for the communities.  When Stockton, a city of 292,000 about 50 miles (80
kilometers) south of Sacramento, filed for bankruptcy in 2012,
it cited pension and retiree health costs. Under a proposed
plan, Stockton would make payments every year starting in 2023
until 2052 to Assured Guaranty Corp. on $124.3 million in
pension securities guaranteed by the insurer.  Standard and Poor’s this month raised Sacramento County’s
rating one level to A, its sixth-highest grade, after it ended
the last three years with surpluses, and the pension debt to A-.
The municipality finished 2012 with a $69.3 million increase to
its general-fund reserves, the ratings company said.  Moody’s Investors Service rates the pension securities
Baa1, three steps above junk, saying the community is recovering
from a “downturn that was more pronounced than in other
comparably sized counties” in California.  A county pension-obligation bond due in 2024 traded Oct. 9
with an average yield of 6.1 percent, a spread of 342 basis
points, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The  risk premium  has
widened since Feb. 5, when the bond traded at 311 basis points
for an average yield of 5.22 percent. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  To contact the reporters on this story:
