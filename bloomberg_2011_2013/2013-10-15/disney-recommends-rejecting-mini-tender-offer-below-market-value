Walt Disney Co. (DIS)  recommended that
investors reject an offer to buy a small portion of its stock
for 4.7 percent below market value.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has warned
against such mini-tender offers, which bidders use to “catch
investors off guard if the investors do not compare the offer
price to the current market price,” Disney said today in a
statement.  TRC Capital Corp., a closely held investment firm, made the
proposal last week to acquire about 2 million Disney shares for
$61 apiece. Toronto-based TRC has made similar offers this year
for  Intel Corp. (INTC)  and 21st Century Fox Inc. shares.  Disney, based in Burbank, California, slid 1.2 percent to
$66.03 at 9:55 a.m. in  New York . The shares closed at $64 on
Oct. 8, the day before TRC made its mini-tender offer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
