South Korea ’s won rose to the
strongest level in almost nine months on signs U.S. lawmakers
are moving closer to a deal to avoid a debt default and reopen
its partially-shut government. Sovereign bonds gained.  “Tremendous progress” has been made in talks to end the
impasse, Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid  said yesterday.
Politicians are working on a proposal to suspend the debt
ceiling through Feb. 7 and fund the government until Jan. 15, a
person familiar with the talks said. If no deal is reached, the
U.S. could suffer its first default on Oct. 17. Global funds
bought more South Korean equities than they have sold every day
since Aug. 22, the longest streak since 1998, according to stock
exchange data available since 1997.  “The U.S. budget talks seem to be making progress,
although there is nervousness among traders as the deadline
nears,” said Jude Noh, chief currency trader at Suhyup Bank in
 Seoul . “Foreign investors’ purchases of local stocks seem a
strategic investment based on Korea’s fundamentals.”  The won climbed 0.5 percent to 1,066.75 per dollar in
Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It earlier
touched 1,066.63, the strongest level since Jan. 24. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in the  exchange
rate  used to price options, rose five basis points to 6.68
percent.  Former Treasury Secretary  Lawrence Summers  said American
economic policy must remain focused on addressing inadequate
demand, and predicted the U.S. would not default on its debt, at
a conference in Seoul today.  Forecasts Raised  HSBC Holdings Plc raised its forecast yesterday for the
Korean won to 1,070 per dollar by the end of this year and 1,095
by the end of 2014, from earlier forecasts of 1,090 and 1,100,
respectively. The  Federal Reserve ’s September decision to delay
tapering and the U.S. government shutdown have helped reduce
core bond volatility which will support some Asian currencies in
the near term, HSBC said in a research note.  The yield on South Korea’s 2.75 percent sovereign notes due
June 2016 fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
2.88 percent, according to Korea Exchange Inc. prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
