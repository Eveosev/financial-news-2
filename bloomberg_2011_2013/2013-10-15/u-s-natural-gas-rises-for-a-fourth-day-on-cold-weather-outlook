Natural gas futures climbed for a
fourth day in New York on forecasts for below-normal
temperatures that would stoke demand for the heating fuel.  Gas gained 0.8 percent after closing yesterday at the
highest level in almost four months. Commodity Weather Group LLC
in Bethesda,  Maryland , said the weather may be colder than
average in the central U.S. from Oct. 19 through Oct. 28. The
low in Milwaukee on Oct. 31 may be 33 degrees Fahrenheit (0.6
Celsius), 5 degrees less than usual, according to  AccuWeather
Inc.  in  State College , Pennsylvania.  Natural gas for November delivery rose 3.2 cents to $3.852
per million British thermal units in electronic trading on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange  at 11:47 a.m. in London after
closing yesterday at $3.82, the highest settlement since June
20. Trading volume was about 43 percent above the 100-day
average. Prices have gained 15 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
