Bakken crude weakened as  North
Dakota  regulators reported record production in August.  Bakken oil delivered at a pipeline hub in Clearbrook,
Minnesota, fell 60 cents to a $12.35-a-barrel discount to U.S.
benchmark West Texas Intermediate at 12:33 p.m. in  New York ,
according to Calgary oil broker  Net Energy Inc.   North Dakota’s portion of the Bakken  produced  847,150
barrels a day in August, according to data released today by the
state Industrial Commission. Production rose 4.3 percent from
the previous high in July. Total oil output in the state
increased to 911,242 barrels a day.  More crude also left the state by  pipeline , according to
the North Dakota Pipeline Authority. About 282,000 barrels a day
of crude left the state by pipe, the highest level since
October.  About 559,000 barrels, or 61 percent of the state’s
production, left by rail. That’s the lowest percentage since
December.  Enbridge Inc. (ENB) ’s Line 81 can carry 281,000 barrels a day
into Clearbrook, where it connects with the company’s Mainline
system that can transport crude to the Chicago area and Cushing,
 Oklahoma .  To contact the reporters on this story:
