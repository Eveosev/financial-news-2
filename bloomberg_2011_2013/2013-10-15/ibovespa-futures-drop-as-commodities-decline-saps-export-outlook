Ibovespa  futures  fell, after the
benchmark stock index rose for a fourth straight session, as
lower commodities prices dimmed the outlook for Brazilian raw-material exporters.  Cyrela  Brazil  Realty SA may be active after the homebuilder
said third-quarter sales declined 23 from a year earlier. Banco
Bradesco SA may move after saying its health insurance unit
increased its stake in  Odontoprev SA (ODPV3)  to 50.01 percent.  Ibovespa futures contracts expiring tomorrow dropped 0.2
percent to 54,105 at 9:20 a.m. in Sao Paulo. The real weakened
0.1 percent to 2.1838 per dollar. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI
index of 24 raw materials slid 0.4 percent as traders waited for
U.S. lawmakers to reach a deal on the nation’s debt ceiling.  In Brazil, retail sales climbed 0.9 percent in August from
a month earlier, the national statistics agency said today. The
median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for a
0.2 percent increase.  OSX Brasil SA (OSXB3) , the shipbuilder controlled by former
billionaire  Eike Batista , may move after two people familiar
with the matter who asked not to be identified said Brazil’s
national development bank, known as BNDES, agreed to roll over a
548 million-real loan due today for 30 days. OSX and BNDES
declined to comment.  Batista’s mining company  MMX Mineracao e Metalicos SA  may
be active after Trafigura Beheer BV and Mubadala Development Co.
agreed to buy a controlling stake in its iron-ore port in Rio de
Janeiro state for $400 million and assumed debt.  The Ibovespa entered a bull market Sept. 9 after rising 20
percent from this year’s low on July 3 through that day. The
gauge is down 17 percent in dollar terms this year, compared
with a decline of 2.4 percent for the MSCI  Emerging Markets 
Index of 21 developing nations’ equities.  Trading volume of stocks in Sao Paulo yesterday was 5.84
billion reais, compared with a daily average of 7.57 billion
