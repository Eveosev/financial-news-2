The  Colorado Rockies  agreed on a
three-year contract with manager Walt Weiss, who guided the team
to a 10-win improvement during his first season in Denver.  The Rockies had a 74-88 record this year, when they
finished last in the National League’s five-team West division.
They were 64-98 in 2012 and have missed the Major League
Baseball playoffs the last four seasons.  “I am very excited and grateful to have the opportunity to
lead this club as we work toward building a championship-level
team,” said Weiss, who grew up in Tuxedo, New York.  Weiss, 49, played 14 major-league seasons at shortstop,
including with the Rockies from 1994 to 1997, and was the team’s
special assistant to the general manager from 2002 to 2008. The
Rockies didn’t disclose terms of his contract.  To contact the reporter on this story:
