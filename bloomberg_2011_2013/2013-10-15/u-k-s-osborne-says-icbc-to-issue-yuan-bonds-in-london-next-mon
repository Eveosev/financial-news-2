Industrial & Commercial Bank of
China Ltd.  will become the first mainland Chinese-headquartered
lender to issue bonds denominated in  yuan  in London, Chancellor
of the Exchequer  George Osborne  said in a Twitter posting.  The world’s biggest bank by market value will issue the
notes next month, according to the posting yesterday, which
didn’t give details. Osborne met Chinese Vice Premier Ma Kai in
Beijing yesterday.  The U.K.’s Coalition government is forging closer links
with the world’s largest emerging economy as it seeks to
establish London as a hub for offshore yuan trading. The Bank of
England was the first European central bank to establish a
currency-swap facility with China when it agreed on a 200
billion-yuan ($33 billion) line in June and Osborne said
yesterday that agreements on yuan settlement and clearing are
planned.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  became the first European bank to list an
international yuan-denominated bond in London with a 2 billion-yuan issue of Dim Sum bonds in April 2012. More than half the
orders for the securities came from Europe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
