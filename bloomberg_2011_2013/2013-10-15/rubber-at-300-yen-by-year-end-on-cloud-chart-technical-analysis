Rubber’s upward trend that started
in June may take the commodity as much as 12 percent higher by
Dec. 31, according to  technical analysis  by JSC Corp.  The most-active contract on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange
entered the Ichimoku cloud pattern this month, signaling futures
will find a floor after retreating 7.5 percent from a three-month high reached in September, said Takaki Shigemoto, an
analyst at the Tokyo-based research company. The 50-day moving
average was around the upper end of the cloud, indicating the
medium-term trend remains upward.  The 50-day average neared the 200-day average after
surpassing 150-day average last month, forming a golden cross,
he said. A golden cross forms when a short-term moving average
rises above a long-term measure and is seen as a bullish
indicator.  “After confirming a floor, futures will resume a rally
toward 300 yen,” Shigemoto said in a telephone interview on Oct
11.  Rubber entered a  bull market  on Aug. 26 as a weaker yen and
signs that  China’s economy  is gaining strength boosted demand
for the commodity used in tires. The contract for March delivery
traded at 268.7 yen a kilogram ($2,724 a metric ton) at 9:14 a.m.
in Tokyo, recovering 18 percent from the year’s lowest close on
June 26.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. The Ichimoku chart analyzes
midpoints of historic highs and lows, or so-called resistance
and support levels, with a breakout from above or below the
cloud pointing to a trend.  To contact the reporter on this story:
