The  Netherlands ’  flower  and plant
exports, the world’s biggest, extended a string of quarterly
drops to the worst on record with a fifth straight slide as weak
European  consumer confidence  hurts spending.  Third-quarter shipments fell 3 percent to 1.06 billion
euros ($1.4 billion) from 1.1 billion euros a year earlier, data
published today by the Aalsmeer, Netherlands-based Dutch
Agricultural Wholesale Board for Flowers and Plants  showed .
Shipments rose 2.2 percent in September, ending a record six-month streak of declines.  Demand for Dutch blooms and potted plants suffered from
lower consumer confidence in European countries including
leading export destination  Germany , according to the board. It
also cited a colder-than-usual spring followed by a warm summer.  “It looks very likely we’ll have to add 2013 to 2008 and
2009 as a year with falling export value of flowers and
plants,” Tom Bijleveld, the board’s director, was cited as
saying. That would be the third annual decline in 60 years, he
said.  Dutch exports of greenery to  Italy , Spain, Portugal and
 Greece  slid 13 percent this year on average, the board said.  Flower and plant shipments in the first nine months of 2013
dropped 3.4 percent from a year earlier to 4.05 billion euros,
according to the report. The Netherlands’ exports of flowers and
plants rose to 5.39 billion euros last year from 5.24 billion
euros in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
