Spot gasoline in  Chicago  weakened
the most in three weeks relative to New York futures as the
region transitioned to a new delivery cycle and two Midwest
refiners were returning from maintenance.  Conventional,  85-octane gasoline , or CBOB, in Chicago
tumbled 5.87 cents to 6.5 cents a gallon below New York
Mercantile Exchange futures at 2:38 p.m., the largest drop since
Sept. 23.  “This is mostly the cycle roll,” said Steve Mosby,
president of ADMO Energy LLC, a supply consultant in  Kansas
City ,  Missouri .  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in Group 3 slid 0.75 cent
to a three-month low of 12.25 cents below futures.  BP Plc’s Whiting, Indiana, refinery was returning a crude
unit to normal operations after being shut for a week of
unplanned maintenance, while  Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC)  was
restarting units at its Catlettsburg, Kentucky, plant following
work in September. The two sites have a combined capacity of
660,000 barrels a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  in Chicago, a rough measure of
refining margins for gasoline and diesel based on West Texas
Intermediate oil in Cushing,  Oklahoma , dropped $1.36 to $12.22 a
barrel, the third consecutive decline. The  same spread  in Group
3 gained 35 cents to $11.46 a barrel.  Conventional,  87-octane gasoline  on the U.S. Gulf Coast
slipped 1.5 cents to a discount of 9.75 cents a gallon after
climbing yesterday to a six-week high. CBOB retreated 1 cent to
a discount of 10 cents a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
