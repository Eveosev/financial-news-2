David Tepper, the billionaire who
runs $19 billion hedge-fund firm Appaloosa Management LP, said
there’s “no way” the U.S. Federal Reserve can scale back its
economic stimulus amid disruptions caused by the government
shutdown.  “They’re not tapering for a long time now,” Tepper said
today in an interview on CNBC. “They have no choice. The
government is still shut, things are going to obviously slow
down and now it looks like they may have a relatively short-term
deal, which is not going to create the confidence you would
quite like.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
