New Zealand  inflation accelerated
faster than economists forecast in the third quarter, ending
more than a year of subdued price pressure and underpinning the
Reserve Bank’s case to start raising interest rates in 2014.  Consumer prices  rose 0.9 percent from the second quarter,
when they gained 0.2 percent,  Statistics New Zealand  said in
Wellington today. Economists forecast a 0.8 percent increase,
according to the median of 12 estimates in a Bloomberg News
 survey .  The annual rate climbed to 1.4 percent, the highest in 18
months and back within the RBNZ’s 1-percent-to-3-percent target
band for the first time since the second quarter of last year.  “The sub-1-percent period of inflation has now come to an
end,”  Nick Tuffley , chief economist at ASB Bank Ltd. in
Auckland, said before today’s report. “This is the point at
which we expect to see the CPI jump up reasonably substantially
and then grind higher.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
