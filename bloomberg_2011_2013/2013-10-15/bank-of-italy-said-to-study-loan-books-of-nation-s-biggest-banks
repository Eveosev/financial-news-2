Italy’s central bank, which started
examining the assets of the country’s top 20 lenders last year,
is reviewing the loan books of  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  and  Intesa Sanpaolo
SpA (ISP) , according to two people with knowledge of the matter.  The central bank started the review of Italy’s two biggest
banks between July and September, said the people, who asked not
to be identified because the inspections aren’t public. The
analysis, focusing on non-performing loans, is part of
inspections started in 2012 to assess lenders’ asset quality and
provisions before a European Central Bank review, the people
said.  The Italian central bank has said lenders must boost
capital by selling non-strategic assets and curbing operating
costs, dividends and executive pay. In the fourth quarter, the
banking regulator forced them to set aside additional provisions
after coverage ratios declined compared to previous years.  Officials at the  Bank of Italy , UniCredit and Intesa
declined to comment. The inspection was reported earlier today
by Reuters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
