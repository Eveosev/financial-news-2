Rubber jumped to the highest level
in more than two weeks after  China  agreed to buy 200,000 tons a
year from Thailand, signaling improvement in demand from the
world’s largest consumer.  The contract for March delivery climbed 2.4 percent to end
at 270.8 yen a kilogram ($2,752 a metric ton) on the  Tokyo 
Commodity Exchange, the highest settlement since Sept. 26. The
most-active contract pared losses to 10 percent this year.  Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra unveiled a plan on
Oct. 13 to sell the commodity to China under a government-to-government contract after meeting with Chinese Premier  Li
Keqiang . The purchases will start this year with unlimited years
of buying, she said.  “China is moving to replenish stockpiles as the economy
recovers,” said Hideshi Matsunaga, an analyst at broker ACE
Koeki Co. in Tokyo. “China also increased rubber imports as
part of an agreement with Thailand to boost bilateral trade.”  China’s passenger-vehicle sales rose more than analysts’
estimates in September. Wholesale deliveries climbed to 1.59
million units last month, compared with the 1.5 million-unit
median estimate of five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Rubber for January delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange ended unchanged at 21,175  yuan  ($3,470) a ton. Thai
rubber free-on-board gained 1.3 percent to 80.80 baht ($2.59) a
kilogram today, according to the Rubber Research Institute of
 Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
