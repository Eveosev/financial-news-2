China , the world’s largest producer
of rare earths, is drafting rules to crack down on illegal
mining, reduce pollution and prevent price wars, an industry
association said today.  They are at the proposal stage and a long way from becoming
laws, said Chen Zhanheng, a spokesman at the Association of
China Rare Earth Industry in Beijing. The group has extensive
contacts with various ministries and is in charge of drafting
rules on the issue, although it isn’t affiliated with the
government, he said.  China cut mining permits and imposed production and export
quotas in 2007 to cut pollution and conserve supplies of rare
earths, a group of 17 chemically similar elements used in
everything from hybrid cars to smartphones. Export controls
soured relations with the biggest users including the U.S. and
 Japan .  The Shanghai Securities News reported today that China may
stockpile rare earths this year after purchasing for inventories
in 2012 and 2011.  Two calls to the National Development and Reform Commission,
which oversees stockpiling of materials from copper to rare
earth, weren’t immediately answered.  China set its production quota for 2013 at 93,800 tons,
unchanged from 2011, according to the Ministry of Land and
Resources.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
