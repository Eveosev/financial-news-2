Honduras deployed 1,000 military
police in its two largest cities to bolster the fight against
organized crime in one of the world’s  most violent  countries
before presidential elections next month.  The force, which is being funded through a tax on private
businesses imposed last year, was approved by Congress in August
and is expected to reach 5,000 officers by the end of 2014.
Starting yesterday, about 500 police were deployed in the
northwestern city of San Pedro Sula and another 500 took
positions in the capital, Tegucigalpa, military spokesman
Colonel Jeremias Arevalo said.  “We are looking to lower the violence and crime rate, to
stop extortion, so that, for example, the woman selling
tortillas in the street doesn’t have to pay so-called war tax or
protection money,” Arevalo said in a phone interview. “The
officers are part of the military, but they are doing the work
of a policeman, working for public order.”  Honduras ’s homicide rate of 86 for every 100,000 citizens,
almost 20 times the U.S. level, costs the Central American
country about 10 percent of gross domestic product, the World
Bank estimates. About 87 percent of all cocaine smuggling
flights departing South America land in Honduras, the U.S. State
Department said in a March report.  Hondurans vote Nov. 24 to choose the successor to President
Porfirio Lobo, who is barred from running for a second term.  To contact the reporter on this story:
