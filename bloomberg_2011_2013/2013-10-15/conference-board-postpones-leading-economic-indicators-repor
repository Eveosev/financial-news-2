The Conference Board said itâ€™s
postponing the release of its September index of leading
economic indicators because of the U.S. government shutdown.  The measure, partly derived from data provided by the
government, was slated for Oct. 18. The New York-based group
said in an e-mail that it will announce a new release date once
government reports are made available.  To contact the reporter on this story:
