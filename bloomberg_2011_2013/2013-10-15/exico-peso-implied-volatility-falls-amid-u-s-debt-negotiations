The Mexican peso’s implied
volatility fell to a two-month low as traders reduced bets in
the options market while U.S. lawmakers wrangle over a spending
deal before the government’s borrowing authority lapses.  One-month implied volatility on options for the currency,
which reflects traders’ expectations for future price
fluctuations, dropped to 11.55 percent at 9:45 a.m. in  Mexico 
City, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s the lowest
on a closing basis since Aug. 14. The currency’s 2.8 percentage
point drop in implied volatility is the biggest decline among
the U.S. dollar’s 16 most-traded counterparts in October after
 Brazil ’s real.  While U.S. Senate leaders have cited progress on a deal to
suspend the debt ceiling, the peso’s implied volatility is
falling as an agreement remains elusive before an Oct. 17
deadline. Mexico sends about 80 percent of its exports to the
world’s biggest economy.  “Everybody is waiting as to what is going to happen,”
 Pedro Tuesta , a senior economist at 4cast Ltd., said by phone
from  Washington . “It’s not the best moment, really, for doing a
volatility” trade.  The peso gained 0.1 percent to 12.9855 per dollar today.
Yields on Mexico’s peso bonds due in December 2024 rose two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 5.91 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
