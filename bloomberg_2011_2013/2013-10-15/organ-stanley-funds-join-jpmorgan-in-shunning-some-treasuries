Morgan Stanley (MS)  Investment Management
told clients its money-market funds aren’t holding Treasuries
that mature in the next month as Congress debates whether to
raise the U.S. debt ceiling.  The firm’s money-market portfolios don’t own Treasuries
that mature between tomorrow and Nov. 20, the Morgan Stanley
unit said in its Investor Insights publication for this month.
The prime portfolios have no Treasury exposure, it said.  “Our portfolio management team has taken a conservative
stance on U.S. Treasury bills and notes in anticipation of
congressional gridlock around raising the debt ceiling,” the
firm wrote. “We felt it prudent to avoid the potential price
volatility near the estimated deadline as well as eliminate any
possible need to sell those securities later at potentially less
favorable prices.”  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the second-biggest provider of U.S.
money-market mutual funds, said last week that those products
had divested Treasuries that mature between Oct. 16 and Nov. 6.
Fidelity Investments, the Boston-based company that is the
largest U.S. money-fund manager, also said it had moved out of
Treasuries maturing in late October and early November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
