Russia , the world’s biggest energy
exporter, will probably reduce  duties  on most oil shipments
abroad by 4.9 percent on Nov. 1 after Urals crude prices fell.  The standard export  duty  may fall to $395.90 a metric ton,
or about $54.01 a barrel, from $416.40 a ton this month,
according to Bloomberg calculations based on oil price data from
the Finance Ministry.  Russia is considering a plan to lower the export levy for
crude and most oil products and raise the extraction tax rate to
increase revenue, while encouraging exploration. Production in
September hit a post-Soviet era record of 10.53 million barrels
a day, according to data from the Energy Ministry’s CDU-TEK
unit, in line with President Vladimir Putin’s output goal for
the decade.  The discounted rate on some eastern Siberian and Caspian
Sea grades may decrease to $192.90 a ton in November from
$208.30 a ton this month. The levy on extra-heavy crude, set at
10 percent of the standard duty, may fall to $39.50.  Russia bases the export taxes on the average Urals blend
price from the 15th day of one month to the 14th of the next.
The benchmark export grade averaged about $108.74 a barrel
during the most recent period,  Alexander Sakovich , a Finance
Ministry adviser, said today by phone. In the previous
monitoring period, it was $113.42, according to the ministry.  The Economy Ministry will publish the levies on its website
before they come into effect, according to Sakovich.  The duty for middle distillates, such as diesel, and heavy
products, such as fuel oil, may fall to $261.20 a ton from
$274.80. A gasoline tax, set at 90 percent of the crude duty
since May 2011 to counter domestic shortages, may decrease to
$356.30 a ton in November from $374.70 a ton this month.  The government may raise the duty on liquefied petroleum
gases such as butane and propane to $154.30 a ton next month,
compared with $121.30 a ton currently.  To contact the reporter on this story:
