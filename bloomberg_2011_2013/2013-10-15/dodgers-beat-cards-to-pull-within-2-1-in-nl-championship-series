Hyun-Jin Ryu pitched seven scoreless
innings and the  Los Angeles Dodgers  ended a scoring drought to
beat the  St. Louis  Cardinals 3-0 and pull within two games to
one in the National League Championship Series.  The Dodgers, playing at home for the first time in the
best-of-seven series, broke out of a 22-inning scoreless streak
that had included a 1-0 defeat two days ago in St. Louis.  Game 4 is set for tomorrow night at Dodger Stadium, with
the following game also in Los Angeles. If necessary, the series
then would return to St. Louis.  The Dodgers broke a scoreless tie with two runs in the
fourth inning on doubles by Mark Ellis and  Adrian Gonzalez  and a
triple by Yasiel Puig, who had gone hitless in 11 previous at-bats in the series and had struck out five straight times.  Los Angeles added its third run in the eighth inning on a
run-scoring bloop single by Hanley Ramirez.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
