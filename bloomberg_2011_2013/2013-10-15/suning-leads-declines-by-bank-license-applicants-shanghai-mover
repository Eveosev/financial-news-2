Suning Commerce Group Co. (002024)  led
declines in shares of Chinese companies that have sought to open
privately owned banks after a newspaper reported that the new
lenders will be limited to their home provinces.  Suning, China’s largest electronics retailer by market
value, fell 6.4 percent to 12.83  yuan  at 2:15 p.m., set for the
biggest one-day drop since June.  Kingfa Sci. & Tech. Co. (600143)  slipped
3.9 percent to 6.13 yuan and  Guangzhou KingTeller Technology Co. (002177) 
dropped 2.7 percent to 6.90 yuan in Shanghai. The city’s
benchmark composite index lost 0.3 percent.  The companies are applying for bank licenses as China’s
government seeks to increase competition in financial services
and reduce the state’s role in reviving the world’s second-largest economy. Regulators will select two applicants per
province and may ban shareholdings larger than 20 percent, the
Guangzhou-based New Express newspaper reported.  “The reported rules we’re seeing are much tighter than
people thought previously, mainly the quota on licenses,” Rainy Yuan, a Shanghai-based analyst at  Masterlink Securities Corp. (2856) ,
said by phone. “Regulators may allow capable private companies
to enter banking, but they would want a controlled pace” of
liberalization.  Regulators may also restrict individuals’ ownership in the
new banks to 2 percent, New Express said. Limits on leverage and
capital may keep the lenders from growing as large as potential
owners had estimated, Yuan said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
