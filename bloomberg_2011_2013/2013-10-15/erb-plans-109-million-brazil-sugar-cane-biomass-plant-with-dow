Energias Renovaveis do Brasil Ltda.,
a Brazilian biomass-power developer, agreed to build a 237
million-real ($109 million) plant at a  Dow Chemical Co. (DOW)  ethanol
project in Minas Gerais State fueled by sugar-cane residue.  The plant will have 46 megawatts of capacity and generate
230 tons of steam an hour, ERB, as the Sao Paulo-based company
is known, said today in an e-mailed statement. It’s expected to
go into operation next year.  The contract is ERB’s second in Brazil with Dow, which is
building the Santa Vitoria ethanol mill with  Mitsui & Co. (8031) , an
ERB press official, who asked not to be identified because of
company policy, said today in an e-mail.  ERB agreed in December 2010 to build a 265 million-real
wood-fired plant to produce steam for a Dow factory in the
northeastern city of Aratu, according to ERB’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
