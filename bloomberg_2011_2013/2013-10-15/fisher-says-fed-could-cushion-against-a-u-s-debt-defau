Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas
President  Richard Fisher  said the central bank could reduce the
turmoil from any U.S. debt default, which he said is unlikely.  “I’m very confident” in the ability of the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York to “mitigate the chaos that might ensue should we default,” Fisher
said today in a speech in New York. “I don’t think that’s going to happen.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
