U.S.  stocks  dropped, following a
four-day rally in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, as lawmakers
failed to reach an agreement to extend the government’s
borrowing limit less than two days before the deadline.  Citigroup Inc. dropped 1.5 percent as its profit fell short
of analysts’ estimates.  Teradata (TDC)  Corp. declined 18 percent after
the computer-data storage company’s earnings missed projections.
Flir Systems Inc. dropped 14 percent after preliminary earnings
fell short of analyst estimates. FedEx Corp. jumped 4.1 percent
after the world’s largest cargo airline operator announced a
share repurchase program.  The S&P 500 fell 0.7 percent to 1,698.06 at 4 p.m. in New
York. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  declined 133.25 points,
or 0.9 percent, to 15,168.01. About 6.2 billion shares changed
hands on U.S. exchanges today, 6.3 percent above the three-month
average.  “Everyone is somewhat over-caffeinated and a bit jittery
in part because of politicians not doing their job,” Chad
Morganlander, a  Florham Park , New Jersey-based portfolio manager
at Stifel Nicolaus & Co., which oversees about $130 billion of
assets, said by phone. “The markets are trading on every news
clip and the uncertainty is increasing, which is having an
unstabilizing effect in the markets.”  The benchmark index dropped as much as 0.8 percent after
Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid  rejected a House plan to halt
the fiscal impasse and Senate leaders stopped talks on a bill
that would fund the government through Jan. 15, 2014, and
suspend the U.S. debt limit until Feb. 7. The Senate talks
haven’t broken down, spokesmen for the chamber’s top leaders
said.  Revised Plan  The House later revised its plan, which would extend
government funding through Dec. 15, rather than Jan. 15, 2014,
in the Senate plan, said Representative Devin Nunes of
 California , who had been meeting with leaders. A vote could come
as soon as tonight.  The new House proposal would bar government subsidies of
health insurance for congressional staff members, along with
lawmakers and high-ranking administration officials, Nunes said.
A two-year delay in the medical-device tax was dropped, he said.  The Congressional impasse has left the government partially
shut down since Oct. 1 and could lead to the U.S. reaching on
Oct. 17 the limit on federal borrowing.  The  S&P 500  closed at the highest since Sept. 19 yesterday
after a four-day rally gave it the biggest advance since
January, as optimism grew that lawmakers would reach a deal to
prevent a government default. The rally pushed the gauge to
within 16 points of its Sept. 18 record of 1,725.52.  ‘Political Mess’  “If we can get through this political mess, then we can
really start to focus on more fundamental things like
earnings,” Thomas Garcia, head of equity trading at  Santa Fe ,
New Mexico-based Thornburg Investment Management Inc., said in a
phone interview. His firm manages more than $90 billion. “The
numbers that we are going to start to get for the last month,
you might see a little bit of a slowdown from the government
shutdown.”  A report today showed manufacturing in the  New York  region
grew at a slower pace than projected in October as sales and
hiring cooled. The government shutdown has delayed the
publication of some closely watched economic data, including the
Labor Department’s monthly jobs gauge.  Earnings Forecast  Profits for companies in the S&P 500 probably increased 1.4
percent during the three months while sales rose 2 percent,
according to analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Intel
Corp ., Johnson & Johnson, Yahoo! Inc. and Coca-Cola Co. were are
among nine companies in the S&P 500 that  released  third-quarter
results today.  The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, the
gauge of S&P 500 options prices known as the VIX, jumped 16
percent to 18.66. the biggest gain since June 20.  All 10 main industries in the S&P 500 fell at least 0.4
today, as utility stocks dropped 1.4 percent to lead losses.
Industrial companies and producers of consumer-discretionary
products sank more than 0.5 percent.  Home Depot Inc. retreated 1.5 percent to $75.18 and  Procter
& Gamble Co . sank 1.5 percent to $77.60 for the biggest slides
in the Dow.  An S&P index of homebuilders fell 2.6 percent for a second
day of losses. KB Home slid 3.2 percent to $16.09 and Lennar
Corp. fell 2.8 percent to $33.34.  Teradata Profit  Teradata sank 18 percent to $42.91. The company said
adjusted earnings per share amounted to 69 cents to 70 cents in
the third quarter, compared with the average analyst estimate
that called for 81 cents. Teradata cut its earnings forecast for
the year to $2.70 to $2.80, down from a previous prediction of
$3.05 to $3.20.  Flir Systems Inc. lost 14 percent to $28.59. The maker of
surveillance and broadcast systems reported preliminary third-quarter profit below analyst estimates as exposure to the U.S.
federal government hurt results.  Citigroup dropped 1.5 percent to $48.86. The third-biggest
U.S. bank reported a $3.23 billion profit that missed estimates
as bond trading slumped 26 percent and U.S. mortgage revenue
declined.  Charles Schwab Corp. gained 4.6 percent to $23.03. The
brokerage reported third-quarter profit that beat analyst
estimates as average revenue per trade increased.  Coca-Cola increased 0.7 percent to $37.66. The world’s
largest beverage company said third-quarter profit rose as sales
volumes advanced in  North America .  FedEx Buyback  FedEx rallied 4.1 percent to $120.08, the highest since
February 2007. The package delivery company said it would buy
back 32 million shares, or about 10 percent of its outstanding
stock as of Sept. 30. The repurchase program comes in addition
to an existing plan to buy back 7.4 million shares.  Even with a deadline looming for the U.S. to avoid a debt
default, it’s been a comparatively calm October for financial
markets. Daily swings in the S&P 500 have averaged 0.78 percent
so far this month through yesterday, down from 0.9 percent for
Octobers over the last eight decades and less than a quarter the
moves in 1929, 1987 and 2008, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  U.S. equities aren’t overpriced even though they have
historically elevated valuations, Robert J. Shiller, a co-winner
of this year’s  Nobel Prize  in economics, said today in a
Bloomberg Television interview with  Tom Keene  and Sara Eisen.  Companies are “relatively high-priced” according to
Shiller’s cyclically adjusted price-earnings ratio, or CAPE,
which compares the S&P 500 with companies’ average profits
during the past 10 years, he said.  “The U.S. market is still not that overpriced, not like it
was in 2000,” even though “we’re pretty high” using the CAPE
gauge, he said. “Looking at the alternatives, it should be a
part of your portfolio.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
