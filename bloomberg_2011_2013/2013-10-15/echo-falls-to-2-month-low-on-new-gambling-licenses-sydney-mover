Echo Entertainment Group Ltd. (EGP) , which
has a 97 percent share of Queensland’s casino market,  fell  5.2
percent to a two-month low in Sydney trading after the
Australian state said it may issue as many as three new licenses
for gambling resorts.  The stock was at A$2.58 at 12:01 p.m. in Sydney and headed
for its largest drop since July 5. while its major competitor,
 Crown Ltd. (CWN) , owned by billionaire James Packer, was 2.2 percent
 higher  at A$16.195 after touching a record of A$16.46. Macquarie
Research upgraded its recommendation on Crown to outperform.  Queensland will allow rival bids for a site in the state
capital  Brisbane  where Echo currently has one of its three
casinos in the state, Premier Campbell Newman said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. The government is considering two
more licenses in the state, he said.  The state government’s announcement adds “a further layer
of risk and uncertainty in terms of potential new entrants,”
UBS AG analyst Sam Theodore wrote in a note to clients. “The
uncertainty could impact the stock for some time.”  Echo gains the bulk of its Queensland sales from its
landmark Jupiters casino on the Gold Coast. Its position is
under threat as the regional government there considers
proposals for a new casino from Skycity Entertainment Group
Ltd., Brookfield Asset Management, Zhuhai Ridong Group Ltd., and
China State Construction Engineering Corp.  Echo has slumped 25 percent this year, compared with a 52
percent rally for Crown and a 13 percent rise in the benchmark
S&P/ASX 200 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
