Ineos Group Holdings and  Solvay SA (SOLB) ,
Europe’s two biggest makers of polyvinyl chloride, submitted
concessions to European Union regulators examining their 4.3
billion-euro ($5.8 billion) PVC joint venture.  The European Commission extended its deadline to rule on
the deal until Nov. 5, according to a  filing  on its website. The
Brussels-based regulator didn’t comment on what the companies
offered. Concessions to resolve antitrust concerns can include
the sale of units or changes to the way companies do business.  The merger of the two companies’ PVC assets, announced in
May, would allow the companies to cut costs in areas from
transport to marketing and raise profitability at a commodity
business suffering from inflated raw material and energy costs.
The PVC industry is facing overcapacity and weak demand in
 Europe , prompting companies in the labor-intensive and power-hungry industry to explore mergers.  Solvay and Ineos may sell a PVC-production plant in  Germany 
to help win regulatory approval for the deal, according to two
people familiar with the matter last month. Strategic Value
Partners LLC’s Vestolit GmbH is among bidders for the site in
Schkopau, Germany, which is valued at about 60 million euros,
two people said earlier this month.  Caroline Jacobs, a spokeswoman for Brussels-based Solvay,
declined to comment on the merger-review process. Ineos didn’t
immediately respond to a call and an e-mail seeking comment.  Solvay has said it plans to exit the PVC venture at a later
stage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
