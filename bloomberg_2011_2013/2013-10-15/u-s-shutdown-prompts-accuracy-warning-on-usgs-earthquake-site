When the  Philippines  was struck by
an earthquake this morning it was the U.S. Geological Survey
website that flashed the details on how big the quake was and
its location to aid the disaster response.  Along with rafts of items on World Seismicity Maps and
Hazard Analysis Tools, the USGS has added another alert on its
go-to website for earthquake and tsunami warnings: The data may
not be reliable.  A banner in pink at the top of the page  reads : “Due to a
lapse in Federal funding, the USGS Earthquake Hazards Program
has suspended most of its operations.” While the Reston,
Virginia-based agency said it will continue monitoring, “the
accuracy or timeliness of some earthquake information products,
as well as the availability or functionality of some web pages,
could be affected by our reduced level of operation.”  Any drop in USGS activity would impact lesser developed
nations such as the Philippines, which run smaller-scale
monitoring and rely on the USGS for global earthquake data,
Robert Geller, a professor of seismology at Tokyo University,
said by phone. It would also affect ordinary citizens in the
U.S, he said.  “If a big quake occurred now, hypothetically, inside the
U.S., disaster relief work might be slowed down if USGS data
wasn’t available to the government,” Geller said. The effect of
the shutdown depends on whether the agency has curtailed the
monitoring itself or stopped putting the data online, he said.  Earthquake Risk  Despite the warning, the National Earthquake Information
Center of the USGS at Golden,  Colorado , does not expect delays
in earthquake monitoring and said data is being gathered at the
same rate as before the shutdown.  “At this point we are getting earthquakes posted on our
website on time, within 20 minutes for magnitude 5 and larger
worldwide, and earlier for a national event,” Jana Pursley, a
geophysicist at the center, said today in a phone interview.  The partial shutdown of the U.S. federal government began
Oct. 1 after Republicans insisted on changes to the 2010 Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act. President  Barack Obama  and
Democrats refused.  Earthquakes pose significant risk to 75 million Americans
in 39 States, according to the USGS  website . The USGS is the
only federal agency responsible for recording and reporting
earthquake activity in the country and its accurate and timely
information is used by citizens, emergency responders, and
engineers, according to the website.  At least 67 people were killed in the Philippines as a
result of the strongest earthquake to hit the nation in a year.
The magnitude-7.2 earthquake struck 2 kilometers (1.2 miles)
south of Carmen, Bohol at 8:12 a.m. local time, according to the
USGS.  To contact the reporter on this story:
