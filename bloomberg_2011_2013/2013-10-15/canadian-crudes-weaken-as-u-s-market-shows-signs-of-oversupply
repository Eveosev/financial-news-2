Canadian crude prices weakened on
the  spot market  as the front-month U.S. oil futures contract
traded below the second month, indicating a near-term oversupply
of oil.  West Texas Intermediate oil for November delivery on the
 New York  Mercantile Exchange was cheaper than December for a
third consecutive day, a situation known as contango, the
longest such period since June 19, according to exchange data.  Western Canadian Select heavy oil declined by $1.50 a
barrel against WTI to a $30.50 discount, according to Calgary
oil broker Net Energy Inc. Syncrude, a light oil processed from
Canadian oil-sands bitumen, lost 50 cents to a $10.75 discount.  WTI futures for November delivery fell $1.20 to $101.21 a
barrel on the Nymex, settling at a 20-cent discount to the
December contract.  U.S. crude oil  inventories  rose by 6.8 million barrels in
the week through Oct. 4, the largest increase since September,
the Energy Information Administration said last week. The EIA
said it will have no further inventory reports until the U.S.
government shutdown ends.  Bolstering supplies are production increases from both
 North Dakota  and  Canada . North Dakota production reached a
record 911,242 barrels a day in August, according to preliminary
 data  released today.  Canadian production is ramping up this month after
upgraders in Alberta and Saskatchewan return from maintenance.
 Suncor Energy Inc. (SU)  said last week that it completed work at its
240,000 barrel-a-day Upgrader 2. Production had been cut by
between 50,000 to 60,000 barrels a day during the work, which
began in early September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
