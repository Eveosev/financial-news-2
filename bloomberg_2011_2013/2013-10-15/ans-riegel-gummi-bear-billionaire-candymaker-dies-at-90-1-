Hans Riegel, the German billionaire
owner of Haribo GmbH, the maker of Gummy Bear candy, has died.
He was 90.  Riegel died today of heart failure in Bonn, the company
said in an e-mailed statement. He had undergone successful
surgery this year to remove a benign brain tumor and was “on
the way to recovery,” Haribo said. Riegel had a net worth of
$4.2 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.  “With his pioneering spirit, he created an internationally
incomparable company and brand,” Bonn-based Haribo said.  Riegel’s father, also named Hans, founded the maker of
liquorice and Chamallows candy in 1920. The son rebuilt the
company with his brother Paul after World War II. He led sales
and marketing, while Paul, who died in 2009, ran production.  Haribo is an acronym of Hans Riegel Bonn, the names of the
founder and the former West German capital. Its other successful
candy products include Fruity Cocktail, Pandas and Happy Cola.
The company, which has about 6,000 employees, manufactures about
100 million Gummy Bears each day, according to Haribo’s  website .  Hans Riegel was born on March 10, 1923. He served as a
soldier in World War II and returned to  Germany  in 1946 after
spending time as a prisoner of war, according to Spiegel
magazine. He studied economics at the University of Bonn and
completed a doctorate in 1951 on the global sugar industry.  Riegel received Germany’s Federal Cross of Merit in 1994
and the French Legion of Honor in 2010.  In accordance with Riegel’s will, his share in the business
will be transferred to a private foundation in order to ensure
that Haribo continues as a family company, Spiegel reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
