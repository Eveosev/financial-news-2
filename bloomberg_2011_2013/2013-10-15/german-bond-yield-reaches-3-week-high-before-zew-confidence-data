German  government bonds  fell, with
10-year yields climbing to the highest level in three weeks, as
signs that U.S. lawmakers are poised to reach an agreement to
end a fiscal standoff damped demand for safer assets.  Austrian, Dutch and Finnish securities also declined amid
bets politicians will reach an agreement before the U.S.
borrowing authority lapses on Oct. 17. German bunds stayed lower
as a report showed investor confidence in  Europe ’s biggest
economy increased in October.  Spain  sold 3.75 billion euros
($5.06 billion) of 12-month bills at the lowest rate since April
2010. Greek bonds advanced, pushing 10-year yields to the lowest
since the nation’s debt was restructured in March 2012.  “Speculation that there will be a solution for the debt-ceiling limit in the U.S. is pushing bond yields in the core
market higher,” said Jussi Hiljanen, head of fixed-income
research at SEB AB in  Stockholm . “Everyone hopes politicians
will work things out but we expect some volatility in the run-up
to the deadline.”  Germany ’s benchmark 10-year yield climbed five basis
points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 1.91 percent at 4:41 p.m.
London time, the  highest  since Sept. 24. The 2 percent bund due
in August 2023 fell 0.43, or 4.30 euros per 1,000-euro face
amount, to 100.825.  Austria’s 10-year yields increased four basis points to
2.28 percent, Dutch rates also climbed four basis points, to
2.27 percent, as did  Finland ’s, advancing to 2.15 percent.  ‘Tremendous Progress’  The emerging U.S. deal would stave off a potential default,
end the 15-day-old government shutdown and change the immediate
deadlines in favor of three new ones over the next four months.
It’s far from complete as the Senate may delay passing the plan
and  House Republicans  may seek to block or change it.  “We’ve made tremendous progress,” Senate Majority Leader
 Harry Reid  said yesterday in  Washington . “We are not there
yet.” He said he hoped a deal could be announced today as his
Republican counterpart, Minority Leader  Mitch McConnell , said
“substantial progress” had been made.  Treasuries dropped for a fifth day, the longest losing
streak since June, with the 10-year yield rising three basis
points to 2.72 percent.  Volatility on Finnish bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today, followed by those of  Greece  and the Netherlands,
according to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between
two- and 10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  Modest Recovery  The ZEW Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim
said its index of investor and analyst expectations rose to 52.8
from 49.6 in September. The gauge of the current situation fell
to 29.7 from 30.6, compared with the median forecast of 31.3.  “While the current index fell a tad, there are foundations
for a modest but robust recovery,” said Annalisa Piazza, an
analyst at Newedge Group in  London . “We expect bund yields to
progressively rise.”  The benchmark yield may climb to as much as 2.10 percent by
year-end, Piazza said. The median of analyst and economist
predictions compiled by Bloomberg is for the rate to reach 1.93
percent in December and 2.10 percent at the end of June.  German two-year note yields rose as much as three basis
points to 0.21 percent today, the highest since Sept. 23, before
an offering tomorrow of 5 billion euros of the debt.  They were last sold on Sept. 18 at an average yield of 0.22
percent, compared with 0.23 percent at an auction on Aug. 21.  Spanish Sale  Spain’s Treasury said it sold the one-year bills at an
average yield of 0.961 percent and 817 million euros of six-month securities at 0.672 percent. Investors bid for 2.06 times
the 12-month securities sold, up from a bid-to-cover ratio of
1.85 at the previous auction on Sept. 17.  Spain expects to conclude its bank-aid program on time at
the end of the year after drawing 41.3 billion euros of a 100
billion-euro  credit line  granted by the euro rescue fund,
Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said yesterday. The economy
probably exited its second recession since 2008 in the third
quarter, the government forecasts.  Greece’s 10-year yield fell 29 basis points to 8.38 percent
after declining to 8.07 percent. The rate has dropped 86 basis
points in the past week.  The nation’s 10-year yield surged to as high as 44.21
percent in March 2012 as the government forced losses on
investors as part of a debt swap that saw it issue new
securities at less than 30 percent of face amount.  European Union finance ministers meeting in  Luxembourg 
today agreed that the success of European Central Bank-led
asset-quality reviews and stress tests depends on having
sufficient backstops in place to handle any capital shortfalls
that are uncovered.  German bonds lost 2 percent this year through yesterday,
according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Austrian securities
dropped 1.3 percent and Dutch bonds declined 2.3 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
