Cocoa rose in  London  on speculation
data will show bean processing increased in  North America  just
as chocolate makers need to buy futures. Coffee retreated.  The so-called cocoa grind in North America may have risen 6
percent to 10 percent in the third quarter, according to broker
Marex Spectron Group. That exceeds the 5.1 percent forecast in a
Bloomberg trader and analyst survey. The  National Confectioners
Association  will release the data Oct. 17. European processing
gained 4.7 percent in the period, data showed last week.  “The immediate focus is on U.S. grinds,” Eric Sivry, head
of agricultural options brokerage at London-based Marex
Spectron, said by e-mail today. “The industry is running at a
low 4 to 4.5 months’ worth of forward cover.”  Cocoa for delivery in December added 0.7 percent to 1,766
pounds ($2,814) a metric ton by 10:52 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in
London. Cocoa for the same delivery month gained 0.3 percent to
$2,720 a ton on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York .  Prices slid yesterday as bean deliveries in top producer
 Ivory Coast  jumped almost fivefold from a year earlier to 64,000
tons in the Oct. 1-13 period, according to data on the website
of KnowledgeCharts, a unit of Commodities Risk Analysis.  “Some do believe that as much as two-thirds of this cocoa
arriving at Ivorian ports was carried over from the previous
season,” Sivry said. Farmers are now getting 50 CFA francs (10
U.S. cents) more than the price for the mid-crop, the smaller of
two annual harvests that ended Sept. 30, “so the bigger numbers
make sense, in a way.”  Farmers will get at least 750 CFA francs a kilogram (2.2
pounds) for the main cocoa harvest for the 2013-14 season
started Oct. 1, according to Ivory Coast’s government. That
compares with 2012-13 figures of 700  CFA francs  for the mid-crop
and 725 CFA francs for the main crop.  Robusta coffee for delivery in November tumbled 1.8 percent
to $1,702 a ton on NYSE Liffe. Arabica coffee for delivery in
December fell 1.5 percent to $1.153 a pound on ICE.  Refined, or white, sugar for delivery in December rose 0.1
percent to $508.60 a ton in London. Raw sugar for delivery in
March added 0.1 percent to 19.06 cents a pound in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
