Hargreaves Lansdown Plc (HL/) , the U.K.’s
largest retail broker, reported “immense” demand from clients
for shares in the initial public offering of  Royal Mail  Group
Ltd. and apologized for any delays in transacting orders.  Hargreaves Lansdown “has seen unprecedented public
interest in the flotation of the Royal Mail,” Chief Executive
Officer Ian Gorham said in a statement published today. “In
addition to interest from existing clients, a large proportion
of our Royal Mail investors were new clients, many investing for
the first time.”  Royal Mail rose 38 percent on its trading debut last week
and was seven times oversubscribed by retail investors in the
U.K.’s biggest state asset sale since British Rail was broken up
in the 1990s. Gorham apologized to the “minority” of its
customers who experienced delays in buying the shares and said
there were no notable financial implications.  Assets under administration jumped 8 percent to a record
39.3 billion pounds ($63 billion) in the three months to Sept.
30 from June 30, Bristol, England-based Hargreaves Lansdown said
in the statement.  The shares rose 3 percent to 1,040 pence by 8:01 a.m. in
 London . They’ve increased 53 percent this year, giving the
company a market value of 4.9 billion pounds.  Revenue jumped 13 percent to 77.9 million pounds and client
numbers rose by 20,000 to 528,000. Net new clients gained
relating to the Royal Mail will be reported in the next quarter,
the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
