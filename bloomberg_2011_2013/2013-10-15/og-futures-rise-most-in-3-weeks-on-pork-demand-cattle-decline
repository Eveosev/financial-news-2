Hog futures gained the most in three
weeks on speculation that demand is improving for U.S. pork,
encouraging meat companies to buy more animals for slaughter.
Cattle prices declined.  Processors this week probably slaughtered 0.4 percent more
hogs than last week, and demand will increase, according to
Urner Barry, a Bayville, New Jersey-based provider of
agriculture data and market news. Official estimates have been
unavailable this month after a budget impasse sparked a partial
government shutdown Oct. 1 that halted supply, demand and price
reports from the  U.S. Department of Agriculture .  Prices “should be good here for a little while,” Lou Arens, a broker at PCI Advisory Services in Waucoma,  Iowa , said
in a telephone interview. “We should be pushing back higher
with some good demand.”  Hog futures for December settlement increased 1.6 percent
to 87.7 cents a pound at 12:45 p.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. The price is up 2.3 percent this year.  Cattle futures for December delivery declined 0.2 percent
to $1.32825 a pound on the CME, after touching $1.33225, the
highest since January.  Feeder-cattle futures for November settlement decreased 0.9
percent to $1.679 a pound. Prices reached records in the
previous three sessions as slumping corn costs encouraged
feedlots to add to their herds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
