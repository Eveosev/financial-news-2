Spot wholesale electricity in PJM
Interconnection LLC’s Western hub fell as demand came in below
forecasts.  Prices reversed earlier gains as demand reached 87,598
megawatts at 4:30 p.m., below the grid’s predicted consumption
of 87,638 megawatt for that time, according to PJM’s website.
Prices climbed earlier on the 13-state grid as above-normal
temperatures boosted demand.  Spot power at PJM’s benchmark Western hub fell $1.10, or
3.3 percent, to average $31.99 a megawatt-hour during the hour
ended at 4 p.m. from the same time yesterday, grid data shows.  Power at the Eastern hub, which includes New Jersey, fell
92 cents, or 2.7 percent, to $32.51 a megawatt-hour. On-peak
Western hub prices traded at a 12 cent premium to the East,
narrower than 23 cents yesterday.  Prices gained in  Boston  after  Entergy (ETR)  Corp.’s Pilgrim 1
nuclear reactor shut automatically yesterday because of the loss
of one of two 345-kilovolt lines that provide offsite power.  The unit, which is about 4 miles (6 kilometers) east of
Plymouth,  Massachusetts , will return to service following
restoration of power and completion of maintenance, said Carol Wightman, a spokeswoman for the New Orleans-based company.  Power in Boston rose $11.06, or 33 percent, to $44.34 a
megawatt-hour at 4 p.m. from a day earlier. The shutdown helped
send New York prices higher because of lower imports from New
England, said Matthew Oatway, a Boston-based analyst for
Genscape Inc., which tracks real-time power data.  New York  “It’s lent some strength to the region and contributed to
a growing list of generation outages,” he said.  Spot power in  New York  City rose $2.33, or 5.9 percent, to
$41.83 a megawatt-hour at 4 p.m. Demand was 8 percent higher
than a day earlier at 6,588 megawatts, grid data show.  Prices in Northern California dropped $7.94, or 19 percent,
to $33.35 a megawatt-hour for the hour ended at 2 p.m. local
time from the same time yesterday, grid data show. Southern
California power fell $7.85, or 19 percent, to $34.37.  Pacific Gas & Electric Co. cut output at the Diablo Canyon
1 nuclear reactor to 50 percent of capacity yesterday to carry
out “necessary work on a feed-water pump,” said Thomas Cuddy,
a spokesman for the San Francisco-based company. The plant is
located 160 miles northwest of Los Angeles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
