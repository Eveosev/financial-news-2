KB Home (KBH) , the Los Angeles-based
homebuilder that announced a tender offer for as much as $215
million of its bonds today, issued $450 million of notes to help
retire the debt.  The company sold 7 percent securities due December 2021 to
yield 460 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The debt is rated B2
by Moody’s Investors Service, an equivalent B at Standard &
Poor’s and B+, one level higher, by Fitch Ratings. The
homebuilder initially marketed $350 million of notes.  Proceeds will be used to fund the tender offer and the
redemption of any redeemable notes not purchased, KB Home said
in a statement today.  The company offered to buy back its $76 million of 5.75
percent notes due February 2014 for as much as 101.39 cents on
the dollar and $102.2 million of 5.875 percent debentures due
January 2015 for as much as 106.6 cents, it said in a separate
statement. KB Home also tendered for as much as $37 million of
its $236.9 million of 6.25 percent bonds due June 2015 for as
much as 107.5 cents.  KB Home last sold debt in January, issuing $230 million of
1.375 percent, six-year convertible debentures, Bloomberg data
show.  Credit Suisse Group AG, Bank of America Corp., Citigroup
Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG managed today’s offering, Bloomberg
data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
