Ultra-low sulfur diesel fluctuated
as the deadline neared for U.S. Congressional leaders to hammer
out a deal that would end the budget standoff before the
country’s borrowing authority runs out.  Futures swung between a drop of 1 percent and a gain of 0.3
percent. Senate leaders are crafting an agreement to offer the
full body. The deal would then have to pass the Republican-dominated House. The government is already in day 15 of a
partial shutdown and Oct. 17 is the deadline for raising the
debt ceiling or risk default.  “There is some skepticism that the House is going to go
along with the deal,” said  Andrew Lebow , a senior vice
president at Jefferies Bache LLC in  New York . “We’re going to
be watching the headlines.”  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for November delivery gained 0.02
cent to $3.0219 a gallon at 10:39 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Trading volume was 4.6 percent above the
100-day average.  The deal being discussed would push the deadlines for
raising the debt limit and funding the government into the first
quarter of 2014. The Senate may delay passing the plan and  House
Republicans  may seek to block or change it.  ULSD’s  premium  versus WTI widened 38 cents to $25.30 a
barrel. The  crack spread  over Brent rose 68 cents to $16.97.  Gasoline for November delivery gained 0.62 cent to $2.673 a
gallon on trading volume that was 24 percent below average.  The motor fuel’s  crack spread  versus WTI widened 63 cents
to $10.23 a barrel. The  premium  to Brent increased 87 cents to
$1.84 a barrel.  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, rose 0.4 cent to $3.347 a
gallon, 44 cents below a year ago, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA
said today on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
