U.K. antitrust regulators gave
companies more time to seek new bids for accounting work, saying
that large corporations must re-tender their audits every 10
years.  The requirement will apply to companies in the FTSE 350
Index starting in the last quarter of 2014, the U.K.  Competition
Commission  said in a statement.  The Competition Commission has repeatedly backed away from
stricter measures during the course of its probe into the U.K.
accounting industry. In February, the regulator said it was
considering forcing companies to change auditors, before
proposing guidelines to rebid work every five years in July.  “Ten years is the appropriate backstop period for
mandating that the audit engagement be put out to tender,”
Laura Carstensen, the Competition Commission’s deputy chairman,
said in the statement. Requiring audits to be put to tender
every five years “in all cases could dilute the benefits we all
want to see.”  After a 16-month inquiry focused on KPMG LLP, Deloitte LLP,
Ernst & Young LLP and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the
Competition Commission took a minimalist approach ahead of
changes planned by the European Union to increase competition in
the industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
