U.S. stocks extended declines after
 Dianne Feinstein  told reporters an emerging agreement in the
Senate had fallen apart, reducing optimism that lawmakers will
reach an agreement on extending the debt ceiling.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.7 percent to
1,697.41 at 2:46 p.m. in New York.  Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid  rejected a House plan to
halt the fiscal impasse, as Senate leaders put on hold
bipartisan talks aimed at ending the 15-day-old government
shutdown and preventing a default.  “It’s all fallen apart,” Feinstein, a Democratic Senator
from California, said of the talks on a budget deal.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
