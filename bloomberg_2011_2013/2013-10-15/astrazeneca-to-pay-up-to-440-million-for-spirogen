AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) ’s MedImmune
biotechnology unit bought closely held  Spirogen Ltd.  for an
initial $200 million in one of two deals to expand the company’s
research into a new type of cancer therapy.  MedImmune will pay an additional $240 million if Spirogen
meets certain development goals, London-based AstraZeneca said
today in a statement. In the second deal, the unit will pay $20
million for a stake in  ADC Therapeutics Sarl , an amount to be
matched by Auven Therapeutics, the majority shareholder of both
London-based Spirogen and Lausanne, Switzerland-based ADC
Therapeutics, AstraZeneca said.  The deals expand AstraZeneca’s pipeline in the field of
antibody-drug conjugates, following competitors including  Roche (ROG) 
Holding AG, Novartis AG and  Bayer AG. (BAYN)  The therapies marry
antibodies, substances produced naturally by the immune system,
with cancer-killing drugs. In conjugates, the antibody acts as a
guided missile, binding to a target found on the surface of
malignant cells and delivering a toxic payload that destroys the
cancer without harming healthy tissue.  “It’s definitely a good deal for them,” Fabian Wenner, an
analyst with Kepler Cheuvreux in Zurich, said in an interview,
although he said AstraZeneca is yet to fully address the
probable impact of generic competition on its biggest-selling
drugs. “It doesn’t change the fact that AstraZeneca needs to
repair its late-stage pipeline as it approaches the Crestor
patent expiry,” he said.  ‘Ground-Breaking’  AstraZeneca  shares  slipped 0.1 percent to close at 3,183
pence in London. The stock is up 9.4 percent this year, giving
the pharmaceutical company a market value of 39.9 billion pounds
($63.7 billion).  “Antibody-drug conjugates are ground-breaking
technologies,” Bahija Jallal, executive vice president of
MedImmune, said in the statement. “The cutting-edge
technologies developed by Spirogen and ADC Therapeutics
complement MedImmune’s innovative antibody engineering
capabilities, enabling us to accelerate antibody-drug
conjugates” into human testing.  AstraZeneca will conduct research with ADC Therapeutics on
two of the Swiss company’s conjugates in preclinical studies.
Spirogen’s existing licensing agreements, such as one with
Basel, Switzerland-based Roche, are excluded from the
acquisition, AstraZeneca said.  Armed Antibody  Roche already has its first conjugate on the market:
Kadcyla, a breast-cancer treatment. That drug was developed with
U.S. partner  ImmunoGen Inc. (IMGN) , which signed an agreement on
conjugates last week with Basel-based Novartis.  AstraZeneca has one drug in late-stage development for
hairy cell leukemia which uses a similar technology. Moxetumomab
pasudotox is an “armed antibody” that targets cancer cells and
kills them from within, Edward Bradley, senior vice president
and head of Oncology Innovative Medicines at MedImmune, said in
an interview. The treatment was developed by Cambridge Antibody
Technology, which was acquired by AstraZeneca in 2006. The U.S.
 Food and Drug Administration  said only one late-stage trial
would be necessary after 50 patients in a early-stage trial saw
their tumors shrink and the disease had disappeared in more than
half of them.  “Spirogen has one of the most potent warheads that makes
it ideal for antibody conjugates,” Bradley said today.
AstraZeneca plans to pair Spirogen’s technology with several
antibodies in its preclinical pipeline, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
