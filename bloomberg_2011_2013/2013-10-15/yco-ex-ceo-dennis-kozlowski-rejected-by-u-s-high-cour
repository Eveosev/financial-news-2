The U.S. Supreme Court rejected an
appeal by former  Tyco International Ltd. (TYC)  Chief Executive Officer
L. Dennis Kozlowski, who was challenging his conviction for
looting the company.  Kozlowski argued unsuccessfully that he wasnâ€™t given access
to crucial documents at trial. He and former Tyco Chief
Financial Officer Mark Swartz were convicted of stealing more
than $100 million from the company. Swartz was granted parole
this month and is tentatively scheduled to be released from a
 New York  prison in January.  Kozlowski, 66, was sentenced in 2005 to 8 1/3 to 25 years
in prison. A New York state appeals court denied him a new
parole hearing in July.  The Supreme Court case is Kozlowski v. Smith, 13-279.  To contact the reporter on this story:
