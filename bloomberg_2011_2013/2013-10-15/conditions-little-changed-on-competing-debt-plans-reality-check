U.S. financial conditions are little
changed, hovering at the highest level in two months, as
Congress wrangles over competing plans that would end a shutdown
and prevent the government from missing debt payments.  The  Bloomberg U.S. Financial Conditions Index (BFCIUS)  increased
0.02 to 1.47, the highest since Aug. 13. The gauge measures
stress in the markets by combining everything from money-market
rates to yields on government and corporate bonds to volatility
in equities. During the debt-ceiling debate of August 2011, the
index fell as low as negative 1.631.  The measure has risen from last week’s one-month low as the
House and Senate prepare plans that each would fund the
government through Jan. 15, 2014, and suspend the U.S. debt
limit until Feb. 7. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said before
Congress this month that the U.S. needs to boost the debt limit
by Oct. 17 or risk defaulting on its payments.  “Most investors are trying to sit on their hands and not
do anything,” Robert Grimm, the head of corporate trading at
Odeon Capital Group LLC in  New York , said in a telephone
interview. “This is taking a lot longer and looking a lot
sloppier than anybody ever expected.”  The emerging contours of an agreement would stave off a
potential default, open shuttered federal services and change
the immediate deadlines in favor of three new ones over the next
four months, including a Dec. 13 target date for a budget
conference between the House and Senate.  Treasuries  The rate on bills due Nov. 21 fell 9 basis points to 0.08
percent after rising to 0.21 percent on Oct. 11. It’s averaged
0.04 percent this year.  The rate on bills due Feb. 20 rose 8 basis points, more
than tripling to 0.12 percent. It touched zero on Oct. 2.  Treasury 10-year note yields rose 0.03 to 2.72 percent as
of 12:51 p.m. in New York.  Rate Swaps  The U.S. two-year interest-rate swap spread, a measure of
debt-market stress, fell 0.5 basis point to 13.25 basis points.
The gauge typically narrows when investors favor assets such as
corporate bonds and widens when they seek the perceived safety
of  government securities . The measure has dropped from this
year’s high of 19.55 on June 21.  Default Swaps  A gauge of U.S. company credit was little changed. The
Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge against
losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, decreased 0.23 basis
point to a mid-price of 76.52 basis points, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg. The index, which typically falls as
investor confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates, has
averaged 81.7 this year.  Currencies  The Bloomberg U.S.  Dollar Index , which tracks the greenback
against 10 major currencies, rose 0.2 percent to 1,013.19. The
index has traded in a range of 1,007.9 and 1,038.63 in the past
three months. The greenback was little changed at 98.61 yen. The
Japanese currency gained 0.4 percent to 133.12 per euro.  Stocks  The Standard & Poor’s 500 fell 0.2 percent to 1,706.42 at
12:55 p.m., declining from the highest level in three weeks. The
 Dow Jones Industrial Average  dropped 46 points, or 0.3 percent,
to 15,255.26.  Volatility  The  CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) , or VIX, gained 5.35 percent to
16.93, below last week’s high of 20.34. Volatility in Treasuries
as measured by the Bank of America Merrill Lynch MOVE index was
at 77.11 as of the end of last week, compared with the average
this year of 72.46.  Currency swings as measured by the JPMorgan Global
Volatility Index fell for a fourth day to 8.29, versus a 2013
average of 9.36.  Energy, Commodities  West Texas Intermediate crude oil for November delivery
slid $0.73, or 0.71 percent, to $101.68 a barrel on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange .  Gold futures for December delivery fell 0.4 percent to
$1,271.1 an ounce on the Comex in New York.  Copper futures for delivery in December rose 0.15 percent
to $3.3080 a pound on the Comex in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
