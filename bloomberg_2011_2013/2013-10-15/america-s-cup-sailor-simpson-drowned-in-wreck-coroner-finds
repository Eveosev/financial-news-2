Blows to the head, body and limbs
contributed to the drowning death of America’s Cup sailor Andrew
Simpson in a May training accident, according to a report from
the San Francisco medical examiner.  Simpson drowned following the May 9 wreck of the 72-foot
(22-meter) catamaran sailed by the Swedish Artemis Racing team
on  San Francisco Bay , the coroner’s office said in a report
released yesterday. Blunt trauma also contributed, though the
report didn’t specify how.  The 36-year-old British sailor, who won gold and silver
medals with Iain Percy at the 2008 and 2012 Olympics, suffered
wounds to the head along with cuts and bruises to his torso,
arms and legs, according to the report.  Simpson died when he was trapped beneath a section of the
capsized yacht, out of sight from other vessels and divers
searching for him.  That accident, the second involving the new 72-foot, twin-hulled boats after eventual champion Oracle Team USA capsized
last October, spurred four investigations, dozens of new safety
rules and renewed debate about whether technology had advanced
faster than sailors’ ability to use it safely.  To contact the reporter on this story:
