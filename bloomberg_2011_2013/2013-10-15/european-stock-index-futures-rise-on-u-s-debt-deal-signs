European stocks  rose for a fourth
day, the longest winning streak in two months, amid optimism
Senate leaders will forge a deal to reopen the U.S. government
and avoid a breach of the debt limit. U.S. index futures were
little changed, while Asian shares advanced.  Rio Tinto Group added 3.2 percent after saying third-quarter iron ore output rose 1 percent. Ashtead Group Plc gained
2.8 percent as JPMorgan Chase & Co. raised its rating on the
building-equipment rental company. Burberry Group Plc lost 4.9
percent after saying Chief Executive Officer Angela Ahrendts
will depart for Apple Inc.  Schindler (SCHP)  Holding AG declined 6.4
percent after the Swiss elevator maker cut its profit forecast
for the year.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose 0.8 percent to 314.81 at
10:23 a.m. in London, its highest level in three weeks. The
gauge has advanced 1.4 percent in October even as U.S. lawmakers
struggled to agree on a budget, forcing the first partial
government shutdown in 17 years. Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
futures added 0.2 percent, while the MSCI Asia Pacific Index
climbed 0.4 percent today.  “We had very positive comments from the Senate leaders,
and if you take those comments at face value, a deal looks
fairly imminent,” Otto Waser, chief investment officer at R&A
Research & Asset Management AG in Zurich, said by telephone
today. “The market is back to the levels it was at before the
entire crisis talks started.”  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat, said
“tremendous progress” had been made during negotiations,
though “we are not there yet.” Leaders are working on an deal
to suspend the  debt ceiling  through Feb. 7 and fund the
government through Jan. 15, a person familiar with the talks
said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.  Possible Delays  The possible deal could still face procedural delays in the
Senate and an uncertain path in the Republican-controlled House
of Representatives, where Speaker John Boehner would have to
decide whether to allow a vote or make changes. Should Congress
fail to act, the U.S. government would run out of borrowing
authority in two days and start missing debt payments sometime
between Oct. 22 and Oct. 31, according to the Congressional
Budget Office.  The U.S. will not default, former Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers said in  Seoul  today. Senate Minority Leader,
Republican Mitch McConnell, said he shares Reid’s optimism after
talks in  Washington .  German investor confidence increased for a third month in
October. The ZEW Center for European Economic Research in
Mannheim said its index of investor and analyst expectations,
which aims to predict economic developments six months in

by Bloomberg.  A gauge of resources stocks posted the biggest gain of the
19 industry groups on the Stoxx 600. Lonmin Plc, the world’s
third-biggest platinum producer, added 3.2 percent to 326.6

British luxury-goods producer, as Ahrendts departs to head

billion) in the six months through September, Burberry said
today in a separate statement. Analysts predicted 698 million
pounds, according to the median of 13 estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Comparable-store sales increased 13 percent, matching
analysts’ estimates.  Schindler Forecast  Schindler slid 6.4 percent to 124.40 Swiss francs, for the
biggest drop on the Stoxx 600. Operating profit fell 5.7 percent
to 682 million francs ($749 million) in the nine months through
September from a year earlier. The company also said full-year
net profit will be no more than 550 million francs, after
 predicting earlier  this year it would be as much as 600 million
francs.  Kuehne and Nagel International AG  declined 2.5 percent to
114.80 francs. The world’s biggest sea-freight forwarder
