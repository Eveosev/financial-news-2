Wally Bell, a 21-year Major League
Baseball umpiring veteran who last week worked the National
League Division Series between the St. Louis Cardinals and
Pittsburgh Pirates, has died. He was 48.  Bell died yesterday of a heart attack at a hospital in his
hometown of Youngstown,  Ohio , according to NBC television
affiliate  WFMJ  in Youngstown. He had open heart surgery in 1999,
 MLB.com said .  “All of us at Major League Baseball are in mourning,” MLB
Commissioner Bud Selig said in a statement. “I always enjoyed
seeing Wally, who was a terrific umpire and such an impressive
young man. On behalf of our 30 clubs, I extend my deepest
condolences to Wally’s family, fellow umpires and his many
friends throughout the game.”  Bell joined the National League staff in 1993 and umpired
three MLB All-Star Games, seven division series, four league
championship series and the 2006 World Series.  “Wally was a great umpire, a great partner and a great
friend,” said Joe West, president of the World Umpires
Association. “The umpiring community is deeply saddened by this
tragic loss. He will be sorely missed by many.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
