An affiliate of Hines, an
international property investor, is in talks to buy a 73 percent
stake in a Dublin shopping mall, five people with knowledge of
the matter said.  The shareholding in Liffey Valley Shopping Centre is owned
by  Aviva Investors , manager of $437 billion of assets, said the
people, who asked not to be identified because the talks are
private. The 46,600 square-meter (500,000 square-foot) mall is
the fourth-biggest in Dublin, according to broker DTZ. Spokesmen
for Aviva and Hines declined to comment.  Hines, based in Houston, opened an Irish office in 2011 to
target property and development sites being sold by banks and
investors, the company said in a  statement  at the time. Retail-property values in Ireland are picking up after Western Europe’s
worst real estate crisis. Store prices rose 0.6 percent in the
third quarter from the previous three months, Jones Lang LaSalle
Inc. said in a report today.  Aviva and Grosvenor Group Ltd., the London-based property
company that owns 27 percent of the Dublin shopping center, had
planned to sell the mall in 2011 for 350 million euros ($472
million), Property Week reported at the time. Grosvenor, owned
by the Duke of Westminster’s family trusts, and the asset
manager took the building off the market after it failed to
attract acceptable offers, the magazine said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
