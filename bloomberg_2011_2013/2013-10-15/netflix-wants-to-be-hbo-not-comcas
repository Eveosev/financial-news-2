This is one of the most interesting pieces of news I’ve seen in a while:  Netflix is looking to hook up with cable companies , allowing them to put a Netflix app on their set-top boxes. Talks are in early stages, so it’s too soon to flip out about a sea change in telecoms. But if this moves forward, it will represent a dramatic change in Netflix’s strategy -- and possibly a blow to the dreams of cord-cutters everywhere. In the minds of many fans (including, at one point, me), Netflix was supposed to be the cable-killer. I  explained  why this was folly a few years back, after the brief and tragic life of Qwikster, Netflix Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings's attempt to separate its DVD business from the streaming: Netflix still has this problem: The more people use it to evade the high cost of cable television, the more content providers will demand that it pay cable-like prices for the content they need. It’s why it has gotten into the original content business with shows such as "House of Cards" and "Orange is the New Black." What these talks seem to signal is that the folks at Netflix have decided they are never going to beat the cable companies -- so they might as well join them. That’s interesting because it comes not long after Home Box Office’s CEO, Richard Plepler, has begun making noises --  albeit vague, uncertain noises  -- about possibly selling his web portal, HBO Go, as a standalone product. Are we starting to see some sort of convergence, where content providers settle on a model that’s a bit more independent from the cable company than HBO or Showtime, but much more dependent than Netflix or Hulu? It certainly seems possible. And if that convergence happens, here’s what it might look like: cable for people who like their content bundled, and standalone Web products for those who just want a couple of things. HBO or Netflix might cost $8 as an add-on to cable, but $15 or $20 as a separate product. People who only watch three or four shows a year could pay for a couple of networks, while those who watch hours of television every night could get the “all you can eat” package we’re used to. Or perhaps all of this is just vague talk, and things will continue as they are right now, for far longer than you’d think possible. If you think markets just naturally get disrupted when new technologies appear, just ask yourself why you still have to buy a car through a dealer in 2013.
