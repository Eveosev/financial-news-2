BP Plc (BP/) , the U.K. oil and gas
company, bought its first assets in Morocco with the purchase of
stakes in three blocks operated by  Kosmos Energy Ltd. (KOS)   BP will buy an interest in the Essaouira, Foum Assaka and
Tarhazoute offshore blocks in the Agadir Basin by paying for an
exploration well in each, part of a second exploration well and
past costs, Kosmos said in a e-mailed statement without
disclosing terms.  BP Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley has pushed the
company to look for oil in frontier areas as it recovered from
the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill. Kosmos plans to start a
drilling campaign in the first half of next year.  “We are delighted that BP will be joining this venture as
they add significant value to our operations, particularly given
their proven success in salt basin exploration and production,”
Brian Maxted, chief executive officer of Kosmos, said in the
statement.  Kosmos will retain about a 30 percent stake in each of the
licenses and remain the operator.  Morocco ’s government will keep
25 percent. BP will gain a 45 percent interest in two of the
areas, while in the Foum Assaka license,  Fastnet Oil & Gas Plc (FAST) 
has an 18.75 percent stake, leaving BP with about 26 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
