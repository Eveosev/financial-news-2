Electricite de France SA ,  Europe â€™s
biggest power producer, said it restarted its Dungeness B-21
reactor in southern  England  after an unplanned halt.  The plant resumed operating at 00:03 a.m. London time today
after closing on June 22 due to a fault on the main boiler feed
pump, the company said in an e-mailed statement.  The unit is one of two at the site and can generate as much
as 550 megawatts when fully operational.  To contact the reporter on this story:
