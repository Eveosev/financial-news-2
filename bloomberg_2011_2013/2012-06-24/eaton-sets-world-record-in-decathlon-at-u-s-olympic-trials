Ashton Eaton set a world record in
decathlon at the U.S. Olympic track-and-field trials, breaking a
mark that stood for 11 years.  Eaton finished the two-day event with 9,039 points, 13
points ahead of Roman Sebrle of the  Czech Republic  who took
ownership of the world record in 2001.  “It’s like living an entire lifetime in two days,” Eaton
told reporters after joining the ranks of Americans Bruce Jenner,
Dan O’Brien and Rafer Johnson, who also held the world mark.  The record came down to the final the 10 decathlon events -
- the 1,500-meter run -- at the University of  Oregon  in Eugene,
Oregon.  Eaton, 24, completed the event in 4 minutes, 14.48 seconds,
almost two seconds faster than the time of 4 minutes, 16.37
seconds needed for the world record.  “I wanted it to be a special event because this is my home
state, my hometown, my home university,” he said. “And just
from the start, I just wanted to perform well.”  Defending champion Trey Hardee finished 656 points behind
Eaton. Both will compete in the  London  Olympics.  “Going into London, I’m not going to change a thing,”
Eaton said. “Clearly.”  Harper Qualifies  Dawn Harper with the fastest time of 12.73 seconds, Kellie
