Aeroporti di Roma SpA is ready to
invest as much as 12 billion euros ($15 billion) when clearer
rules and higher tariffs will be approved, Gilberto Benetton
told Il  Corriere della Sera  in an interview.  Investments to double capacity at  Rome ’s Fiumicino airport
and to increase passengers from 40 million to 100 million a year
are “halted so far” because imposed fees are too low and hurt
revenue, Benetton, whose family controls the airport management
company through  Gemina SpA (GEM) , told Corriere.  To contact the reporter on this story:
