Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  could cut
the sale price of 632 bank branches to revive a deal with the
Co-operative Group Ltd., the Sunday Times reported, citing
unidentified people with knowledge of the situation.  The Lloyds board could reduce by half the price of the
Project Verde branches, which the bank must sell by November
2013 to abide by European Union state-aid rules following its
bailout, the newspaper said. The branches might have fetched as
much as 2 billion pounds ($3.1 billion) last year, according to
the report. The board could make a decision when it meets on
June 27, the Sunday Times said.  Lloyds spokesman Ed Petter said by telephone that the
company wouldnâ€™t comment on the Sunday Times report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
