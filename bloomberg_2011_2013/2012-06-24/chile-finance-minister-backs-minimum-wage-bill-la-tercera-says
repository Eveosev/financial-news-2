Chilean Finance Minister Felipe Larrain condemned the opposition for rejecting a government bill
to raise the minimum wage by 6 percent, saying their attitude
was a “sign of populism,” La Tercera reported.  The proposal, which also was rejected by one of the two
parties in the ruling coalition as insufficient, took into
account slowing domestic growth and the  European debt crisis ,
Larrain said in an interview with the Santiago-based newspaper.  Chile’s government could speed up existing public works
projects and bring forward others to combat the decline in
demand for exports, Larrain said, according to La Tercera today.
There were no plans to cut spending in the budget for next year,
he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
