South African President  Jacob Zuma 
holds “problematic” and “pretentious” views about Zimbabwe’s
power-sharing government and President  Robert Mugabe , the Sunday
Mail of Zimbabwe reported, citing Julius Malema.  Malema, the former leader of South Africa’s ruling African
National Congress Youth League before his ouster for
indiscipline, told the state-controlled Sunday Mail that Zuma
isn’t a “neutral” mediator between Zimbabwe’s political
parties.  The Southern African Development Community appointed Zuma
to mediate between the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic
Front and the Movement for Democratic Change in 2009, after
violence marred elections the previous year. Under the accord,
Mugabe’s Zanu-PF shares power with the Movement for Democratic
Change, led by Prime Minister  Morgan Tsvangirai .  Malema said Zuma should “start packing his bags” because
he will probably be removed as leader at an ANC conference in
December, according to the Harare-based Sunday Mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
