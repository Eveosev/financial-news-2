Egypt’s strategic wheat stockpiles
total 5 million metric tons, enough to cover the country’s needs
for six months, the state-run Middle East  News Agency  reported,
citing Supply Minister Gouda Abdel Khaleq.  The  Finance Ministry  allocated 8.5 billion Egyptian pounds
($1.4 billion) to the purchase of wheat from local farmers, the
agency, known as Mena, cited Abdel Khaleq as saying.  The increase in the quantity and the quality of the
domestic wheat harvest decreases dependence on imported grain
and eases pressure on the budget, Abdel Khaleq said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
