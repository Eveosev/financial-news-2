England and Italy were tied 0-0 at
the end of regulation play in their quarterfinal in Kiev,
Ukraine at soccerâ€™s European Championship and will play 30
minutes extra time.  If the teams remain tied, the match will be decided by a
penalty shootout. Both sides have missed a number of chances,
with Italy creating the most. Daniele de Rossi and  Mario
Balotelli  have come close to scoring in the second half for
Italy.  The winner of the match at the Olympic Stadium will play
record three-time champion Germany in the semifinals. The other
semifinal will be between defending champion Spain and Portugal.  England, which last reached the semifinals in 1996, is
looking to win the tournament for a first time. Italy is the
1968 champion.  England named an unchanged team, with  Wayne Rooney  again
partnering Danny Welbeck in attack. Italy recalled striker Mario
Balotelli to the starting lineup, while Riccardo Montolivo and
Leonardo Bonucci came in for the injured Giorgio Chiellini and
Thiago Motta.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
