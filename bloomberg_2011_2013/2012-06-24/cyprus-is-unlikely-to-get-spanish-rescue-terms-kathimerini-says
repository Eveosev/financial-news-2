Cyprus is unlikely to get similar
treatment to  Spain  if it applies for a European rescue as it
will have to address serious imbalances in its economy,
Kathimerini reported, without saying how it got the information.  Spain became the fourth euro-area nation to seek a bailout
on June 9, with a request for as much as 100 billion euros ($126
billion) to rescue its banks. The euro area will impose no extra
budget-austerity requirements on Spain’s government, European
Union Economy Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said.  Cyprus’s negotiations on receiving funds from the European
Financial Stability Facility won’t be affected even if it
resorts to a bilateral loan from  Russia , the Nicosia-based
newspaper reported. The euro area’s third-smallest economy may
need as much as 9.9 billion euros in rescue funds until it can
regain bond-market access, Kathimerini said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
