Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings
Ltd. (1038) , owned by  Li Ka-Shing , Asiaâ€™s richest man, is interested in
buying a stake in Manchester Airports Group, the Sunday Times
reported, without saying where it got the information.  The owners of Manchester Airports Group, which also
operates the East Midlands, Bournemouth and Humberside sites,
want to raise as much as 1 billion pounds ($1.56 billion) to
fund a bid for Stansted airport, the newspaper said, and would
set up a joint venture with any investor to run the airports.
Any investor would get a 35 percent equity stake with 50 percent
voting rights in the venture, according to the Sunday Times.  Industry Funds Management Pty. Ltd. is also interested in
the stake, the paper said. A joint venture between 3i
Infrastructure Plc and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority will
no longer bid for the stake, the paper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
