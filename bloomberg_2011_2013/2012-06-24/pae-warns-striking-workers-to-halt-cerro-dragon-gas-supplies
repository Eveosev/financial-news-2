Pan American Energy LLC, the
Argentine energy company partly owned by BP Plc, said that its
Cerro Dragon oil field will stop supplying gas to two pipelines
“within hours” after about 400 workers occupied the plant.  The construction workers were blocking roads to the plant
as well as occupying the installations, PAE said in an e-mailed
statement late yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
