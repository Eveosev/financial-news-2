Germanyâ€™s opposition  Social
Democratic Party  is considering a pledge to scrap cuts in state
retirement benefits that would boost public spending by at least
25 billion euros ($31.4 billion) per year from 2030,  Der Spiegel 
 said , citing an internal party document.  The proposal, which is being debated by party officials and
may not become policy, calls for stopping a planned decline in
retirement benefits to 43 percent of average income by 2030 and
a minimum monthly benefit of 850 euros, the German magazine
reported in an e-mailed version of an article today.  SPD party head Sigmar Gabriel declined to comment on the
reported plan, Der Spiegel said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
