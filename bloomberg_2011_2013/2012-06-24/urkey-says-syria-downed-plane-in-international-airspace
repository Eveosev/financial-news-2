The Turkish plane shot down by
Syrian forces on June 22 was in international airspace when it
was fired at, though it had entered Syrian airspace some minutes
previously, Turkish Foreign Minister  Ahmet Davutoglu  said.  The plane was struck about 13 miles of the Syrian coast,
and crashed into the sea about 8 miles offshore, Davutoglu said
on state television from Ankara today.  The jet was unarmed and conducting a test and training
flight related to the countryâ€™s radar system, and was not on any
mission related to  Syria , Davutoglu said. Its Turkish identity
was clear, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
