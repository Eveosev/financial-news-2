Exxon Mobil (XOM)  Corp.’s refinery in
Beaumont,  Texas , flared nitric oxide at 8:30 p.m. local time
yesterday, according to a National Response Center filing.  About 2,000 pounds of nitric oxide was released because of
a trip in the settling converter, NRC said on its website.  U.S. companies must notify the response center if they
release hazardous substances in excess of reportable quantities,
according to the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund.
Bloomberg News couldn’t immediately verify that the information
in the NRC filing was accurate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
