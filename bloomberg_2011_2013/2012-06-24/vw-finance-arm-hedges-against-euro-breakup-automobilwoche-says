Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s finance arm is
making risk provisions for the possible exit of some euro-area
countries from the currency union,  Automobilwoche  quoted Frank Witter, the unit’s head, as saying in an interview.  Braunschweig, Germany-based VW Financial Services AG is
running possible scenarios and aims to protect itself against
major turmoil in the euro area, Witter, the unit’s chief
executive officer, was quoted as saying in comments on the
magazine’s website.  While the euro wouldn’t necessarily collapse if  Greece  left
the currency union, the contagion risks can’t be forecast
reliably, Witter was quoted as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
