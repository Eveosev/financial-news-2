Prime Minister  David Cameron  will
propose cuts to some housing benefit for people aged 25 and
under, the  Mail on Sunday  reported, citing an interview.  Cameron will say in a speech tomorrow that the U.K. will
cut most of the 1.8 billion-pounds ($2.8 billion) in housing
benefit paid to 380,000 people, and will stop 70 pound weekly
payments to the unemployed who refuse to look for work or have a
resume, the paper said.  “We are spending nearly 2 billion pounds on housing
benefit for under-25s -- a fortune,” the paper reported him as
saying. “We need a bigger debate about welfare and what we
expect of people. The system currently sends the signal you are
better off not working, or working less.”  “We are sending out strange signals on working, housing
and families,” he said “At the moment the system encourages
people not to work and have children, but we should help people
to work and have children.”  He said there should be more tax collection and the wealthy
should pay more tax, while some arrangements to avoid paying
should be stopped.“We need a crackdown on aggressive schemes,”
he said.  “If the facts change, it’s braver to make changes,” he
said, when asked about some of the government’s recent policy
changes. “No one thinks this is a weak government.’  To contact the reporter on this story:
