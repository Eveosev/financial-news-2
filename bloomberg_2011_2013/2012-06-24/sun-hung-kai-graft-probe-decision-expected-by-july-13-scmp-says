Hong Kong’s Department of Justice
will probably decide whether to pursue prosecutions in the  Sun
Hung Kai Properties Ltd. (16)  bribery investigation by July 13, the
 South China Morning Post  reported, citing unnamed sources.  Nine people arrested in connection with the case are
expected to report back to the ICAC on July 13, an unnamed law
enforcement official told the Post, which said the date was
confirmed by a second source working in the private sector. No
one has been formally charged as yet.  The city’s Independent Commission Against Corruption
arrested co-chairmen Raymond and  Thomas Kwok  and Rafael Hui,
formerly the city’s No. 2 official, in March in one of the
highest-level investigations conducted in the body’s 38-year
history. The probe increased public concern about real-estate
policies implemented by the government as property price gains
make Hong Kong the world’s most expensive place to own a home.  To contact the reporter on this story:
