The U.K. government will rate
suppliers based on their performance in a bid to improve
efficiency and lower costs, the  Sunday Telegraph  said today,
citing an unidentified spokesman in the  Cabinet Office .  The office has called 22 companies which together provide
the government 15 billion pounds ($23.4 billion) of supplies to
meetings to warn them that it plans to get “tough” in
assessing their performance, the newspaper reported. The
companies include  Balfour Beatty (BBY)  Plc,  BT Group Plc (BT/A) , Sodexho Inc.
and  G4S Plc (GFS) , according to the Sunday Telegraph.  To contact the reporter on this story:
