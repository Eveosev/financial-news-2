Salvatore Ferragamo SpA (SFER)  Chief
Executive Officer Michele Norsa said revenue in  China  continues
to increase at a “significant” pace, even as growth slows in
some coastal areas as the economy cools.  “There isn’t a big difference” between Ferragamo’s
second-quarter sales growth and the first quarter, Norsa said
today before the Florence, Italy-based shoemaker’s mens’ runway
show in Milan.  So-called second- and third-tier Chinese cities are
“performing even more positively,” while coastal cities such
as Shenzhen and Guangzhou “suffer a little bit more because of
the economic slowdown,” the CEO said.  The U.S. is performing better than expected, particularly
in tourist destinations such as Hawaii, Norsa said. Ferragamo’s
sales growth on the West Coast of the country is higher than
that on the East Coast, he said.  Ferragamo isn’t preparing for Greece to exit the euro,
Norsa said. The Greek market, where the luxury goods maker
operates via a partner, still has “a reasonable future,”
particularly as it’s one of the top five countries for e-
commerce sales in  Europe , the CEO said.  “It means people are more willing to buy online than go
out shopping,” Norsa said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
