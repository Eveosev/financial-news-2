Hans-Peter Keitel, the head of
Germany’s BDI industrial employer association, backs Chancellor
 Angela Merkel ’s bid to keep the euro area intact, Handelsblatt
said, citing a letter by Keitel to leading members of the group.  Preserving the joint currency is in  German industry ’s
interest and any backsliding in European integration would pose
incalculable risks for economic and political stability, the
Dusseldorf, Germany-based newspaper quoted Keitel’s letter as
saying in an article published today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
