Germans showed the lowest support
for the euro among the four largest nations using the currency,
according to a poll published in four European newspapers today.  The poll shows 39 percent of Germans favor leaving the
euro, versus 28 percent of Italians, 26 percent of French and 24
percent of Spaniards, according to the survey, conducted by
Ifop-Fiducial and published in Madrid-based ABC,  Germany ’s Bild,
 Italy ’s Corriere della Sera and Le Journal du Dimanche.  In all four countries, majorities said that loans to  Greece 
will never be paid back, even as most said that not saving
Greece would increase the euro region’s difficulties
“dangerously,” ABC said. In France and Germany, most of those
polled said Greece should leave the euro if it can’t pay back
its loans, while in Italy and  Spain  about half shared that view.  The surveys were carried out from June 18 to June 21 and
questioned 976 people in Spain, 1001 in France, 1003 in Germany
and 967 in Italy, ABC said. No margin of error was given.  To contact the reporter on this story:
