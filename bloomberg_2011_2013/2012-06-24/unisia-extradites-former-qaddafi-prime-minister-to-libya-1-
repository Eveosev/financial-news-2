Tunisia extradited the former Libyan
Prime Minister Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi, detained since the end of
September in the country, to neighboring  Libya , Bachir al-Sid,
his lawyer, said today by phone.  Al-Mahmoudi was received by Libyan authorities and was
being held in a prison belonging to the Justice Ministry and
under the supervision of the judiciary police, Libyan Prime
Minister Abdelrahim El Keib said today at a press conference.  Adnan Mnasser, a spokesman for the presidency, earlier said
by phone that “the president did not sign the decree of
delivery.” Tunisian Prime Minister Hamadi Jebali had said that
the extradition was not conditional on the signature of the
president.  To contact the reporter on this story:
