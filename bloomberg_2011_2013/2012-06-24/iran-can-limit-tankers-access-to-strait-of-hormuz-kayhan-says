Iran can restrict  oil tankers ’
access to the  Strait of Hormuz  based on its “right of
retaliation” when a European Union embargo on its oil starts
next week, said  Kayhan ’s editor-in-chief, Hossein Shariatmadari.  Iran’s “hands aren’t tied” when it comes to the embargo
that will come into force on July 1 and it can respond to the
“bellicose undertaking” by barring access to tankers
transporting oil for countries enforcing the sanctions,
Shariatmadari wrote in an editorial published yesterday.  Iran can act in line with its rights under the 1958
 Convention on the Territorial Sea , said the head of the Tehran-
based daily who was appointed by Supreme Leader  Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei .  The Persian Gulf country “can prevent the passage of oil
tankers or ships with military or commercial loads that aren’t
considered harmless for its security, order and peace,” he
said. “Why shouldn’t Iran use its legal right?”  To contact the reporter on this story:
