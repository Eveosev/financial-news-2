Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA ,
 Italy ’s third-biggest bank, postponed by a day to June 26 a
board meeting to approve a business plan, including measures on
capital to comply with European Banking Authority targets.  Monte Paschi delayed the meeting for “organizational
reasons,” the Siena, Italy-based bank said in a statement
yesterday. The bank will present the plan to investors on June
27, it said.  Monte Paschi, among Italian lenders that must raise capital
as part of  Europe ’s plan to end the sovereign-debt crisis, has a
capital shortfall of 3.3 billion euros ($4.4 billion), according
to the European Banking Authority. The bank has also to repay
1.9 billion euros of state aid provided in 2009.  The lender has already covered more than 2 billion-euro of
its shortfall through the conversion of hybrid bonds and the
implementation of new internal models, Chief Executive Officer
Fabrizio Viola said last month. The bank may fill the remaining
shortage of capital through asset sales and the issue of
contingent convertible bonds, he said.  Monte Paschi is also considering asking for  new state aid,
through the issue of 1 billion euros of bonds subscribed by the
Italian Treasury,  Il Sole 24 Ore  reported June 19.  Monte Paschi’s  first-quarter profit  dropped 61 percent to
54.5 million euros after setting aside more money for bad loans,
it said May 15. Loan-loss provisions in the quarter rose 58
percent to 434 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
