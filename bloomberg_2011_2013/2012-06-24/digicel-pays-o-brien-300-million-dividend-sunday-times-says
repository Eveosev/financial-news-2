Irish telecommunications billionaire
 Denis O’Brien  received a $300 million special dividend from his
Digicel Group Ltd., the Jamaica-based mobile phone company, for
the year through March, the Sunday Times reported, without
citing anyone.  O’Brien received a $115 million dividend from Digicel for
the previous year and took $800 million from the business in a
refinancing in 2008, when he took full control of the company,
which has operations across the Caribbean, Central America and
the Pacific, the newspaper said in its Irish edition.  The most recent special dividend payment was disclosed in
an analyst conference call this month, the report said. James
Morrissey, a spokesman for O’Brien, declined to comment when
contacted by Bloomberg News.  Editors:  To contact the reporter on this story:
