Alex Hales hit the highest score by
an Englishman in Twenty20 internationals as the hosts beat West
Indies by seven wickets today.  Hales was bowled by  Ravi Rampaul  for 99 at Trent Bridge in
Nottingham, his home ground. He just missed out on becoming the
seventh player to hit a century in an international 20-over
match.  England reached its victory target with two balls
remaining, making 173-3 in response to the visitors’ 172-4.  Ravi Bopara , who shared a 159-run partnership with Hales, scored 59.  England finishes unbeaten against West Indies this summer
following 2-0 victories in both the Test and one-day series.
Today’s was the only Twenty20 match.  Hales and Bopara took the hosts to the brink of today’s win
before losing their wickets in the final two overs. First, Hales
was bowled, before Bopara was caught by  Fidel Edwards  off the
bowling of Marlon Samuels.  Eoin Morgan got two runs off his first ball to seal the
victory.  Earlier, Dwayne Smith top-scored with 70 as the West Indies
recovered from a slow start that had seen them on 30-3. Dwayne Bravo finished unbeaten on 54, while Kieron Pollard was 23 not
out.  England starts a five-match one-day series against Australia
at Lord’s in London on June 29. It is also set to host South
Africa in a series of Test, one-day and Twenty20 matches.  To contact the reporter on this story:
