Saudi Arabia ’s Crown Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz said the kingdom will remain on its “Islamic path
without deviation,” Arab News cited him as saying.  Salman, who also serves as defense minister, said he would
try to strengthen the kingdom’s security and stability, the
 Jeddah-based newspaper  reported. The crown prince made the
comments as princes, Islamic scholars and senior military
officials pledged their allegiance to him, the newspaper said.  King Abdullah  appointed Salman as crown prince on June 18
after his predecessor Nayef bin Abdulaziz died in Geneva two
days earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
