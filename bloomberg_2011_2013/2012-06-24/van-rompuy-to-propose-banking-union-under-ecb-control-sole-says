European Council President  Herman
Van Rompuy  will propose a plan to create a banking union
controlled by the European Central Bank, the Italian newspaper
 Il Sole 24 Ore  reported, without saying how it got the
information.  The plan also includes a proposal to create a fund to
manage banking crises, the newspaper said.  EU leaders are due to meet from June 28 to June 29, and a
key issue on the agenda will be a long-term plan for more fiscal
and banking integration.  Van Rompuy  is due to unveil the draft
plan this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
