Aggreko Plc (AGK) , a British supplier of
power generators, won a temporary contract to set up a 60
megawatt thermal power-plant in Nairobi to prevent electricity
shortages, the Sunday Nation reported.  The company, which has been operating in Kenya since at
least 2000, plans to sell the power for $13.79 per kilowatt, the
Nairobi-based newspaper said, citing a statement from  Kenya
Electricity Generating Co. (KEGC) , the countryâ€™s biggest power
producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
