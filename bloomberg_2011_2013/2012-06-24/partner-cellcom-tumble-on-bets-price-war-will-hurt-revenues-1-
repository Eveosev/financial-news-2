Cellcom Israel Ltd. (CEL)  and  Partner
Communications Co. (PTNR) , the country’s largest and second-largest
mobile-phone providers, tumbled in  Tel Aviv  on bets price cuts
will hurt revenues.  The  shares  in Partner dropped 5.4 percent to 16.03 shekels,
the lowest level since April 2003, at 12:36 p.m. in Tel Aviv,
bringing its year-to-date drop to 52 percent.  Cellcom slumped
6.1 percent to 25.25 shekels, the lowest since July 2007, when
the shares were listed in Tel Aviv.   Bezeq Israeli
Telecommunication Corp. (BEZQ) , which provides wireless services
through a unit, dropped 3.7 percent to 4.082 shekels.  Partner said last week it plans to set up a new low-cost
wireless brand called Mobile 012. Competition in
telecommunications has intensified after the government forced
providers to cut fees and encouraged new players to enter the
market.  “This could lead to an additional drop in average revenue
per user (ARPU) of all the companies and may hurt revenues,”
Rami Rosen, head of research at Harel Finance Trade Securities
Ltd. in Ramat Gan, Israel, said today by phone. Partner’s
monthly ARPU was 101 shekels ($25.89) for the first quarter
2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Cellcom’s per
user revenue was 90.5 shekels for the same period, the data
shows.  Golan Telecom Ltd. and  Hot Telecommunication System Ltd. (HOT) 
said in May they’d start offering unlimited mobile-phone
services, competing with packages of Cellcom, Partner and Bezeq,
who have been the worst performing shares on the TA-25 benchmark
index in the past six and 12 months.  Hot  dropped  3 percent to 32.89 shekels, the lowest level
since May 30, bringing its year-to-date drop to 31 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
