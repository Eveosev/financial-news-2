The Czech Republic should fulfill
its goal to cut the public-finance deficit to 3 percent of its
economic output this year, unless there is a “severe”
worsening of the economic situation in the euro-area, Czech
Finance Minister Miroslav Kalousek said today on the state TV
channel  CT1 .  “Unless there’s a severe worsening of the situation in the
euro zone, I don’t have any reasons to reckon that we won’t
fulfill the central state and public finance budget goals for
this year,” Kalousek said on CT1.  The Czech Republic’s deficit in 2011 was 3.1 percent of
gross domestic product.  To contact the reporter on this story:
