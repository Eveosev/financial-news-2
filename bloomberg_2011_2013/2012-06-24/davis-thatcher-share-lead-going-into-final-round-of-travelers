Brian Davis  and Roland Thatcher
share the lead going into the final round of the PGA Tour’s
Travelers Championship.  Davis shot a 6-under-64 yesterday and Thatcher carded a 5-
under 65 to stand a 12-under 198 after 54 holes at TPC River
Highlands in Cromwell, Connecticut.  The leaders are two strokes ahead of John Rollins, James Driscoll and  Stuart Appleby  who are tied for third at 10-under
200.  Half of the field yesterday needed to finish round two,
which was suspended when storms moved into the area. By day’s
end, all golfers had completed 54 holes.  Davis had six birdies for a 29 on the front nine.  “I didn’t even realize I had shot 29,” Davis told
reporters. “I was just playing and everything was going right.
Then obviously we hit the turn and we had the wind pick up for
about three holes and it was playing tough all of the sudden.”  Thatcher had three straight birdies on the back nine to
take a one-stroke lead over Davis before missing a putt for par
on the 17th hole  “I executed just really well in that stretch,” Thatcher
said.  Defending champion Fredrik Jacobson was the leader when
play was suspended during the second round. After finishing the
third round at 9-under, he shared sixth place with Padraig Harrington,  Matt Kuchar ,  Tim Clark ,  Charley Hoffman  and Will
Claxton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
