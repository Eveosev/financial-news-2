Home prices and rents in  Saudi
Arabia ’s two largest cities increased during the first quarter
amid limited residential supply and an easing in bank lending
conditions,  Jones Lang  LaSalle said.  In  Riyadh , the kingdom’s capital, villa and apartment
prices increased to 4,236 riyals and 2,628 riyals ($1,129 and
$700) a square meter, respectively, the property broker said in
a report e-mailed today. Villa rents jumped 8 percent in the
quarter compared with the same period a year earlier, while
apartment leases climbed 13 percent.  Saudi Arabia’s population has quadrupled in 40 years to
28.7 million, creating a widening housing shortage. The Arab
world’s largest economy needs 900 new homes a day over the next
five years to meet demand, Jones Lang LaSalle said March 2011.  “Commercial banks and financing companies have relaxed
their financing terms for end users,” the report said.
“Families can now submit a joint mortgage application to
fulfill the salary criteria.”  Apartment rents will probably increase further throughout
the year if housing allowances for government employees are
raised, wrote  John Harris , Jones Lang’s head of research. At
least 130,000 homes will be built by 2015, adding to the city’s
existing 889,000 homes, he said.  Sale prices for villas in the Red Sea city of  Jeddah , the
kingdom’s second-largest, jumped 11 percent to 4,600 riyals a
square meter. Apartment prices also rose.  “Villa rents increased by 4 percent in the preferred
Western region in first quarter to an average of 201,000 riyals
per year,” Jones Lang LaSalle said. “Villas in residential
compounds have shown the greatest increase, due to the
preferences of many expatriate families to live in gated-villa
communities.”  Approximately 4,000 housing units were completed in the
first quarter and a further 12,000 additional units are to be
finished this year, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
