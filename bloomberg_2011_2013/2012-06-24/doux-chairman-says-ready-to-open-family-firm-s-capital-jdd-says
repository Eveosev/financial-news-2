Doux SA Chairman Charles Doux is
ready to open up the capital of  Europe ’s largest chicken
processor to “ensure the integrity” of the family-controlled
company, Le Journal du Dimanche  reported , citing an interview.  Doux is ready to talk with industrial partners, either
French cooperatives or financiers that can provide guarantees
for the future of the company, he was quoted as saying in the
newspaper. The company was placed under court administration on
June 1 by the court in Quimper, Brittany.  Charles Doux and his sons own 35 percent of the company,
while two other branches of the family bring the stake to 80
percent, JDD wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
