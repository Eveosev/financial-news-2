New York settled a lawsuit for
$410 million with J.  Ezra Merkin  over claims that Merkin funds
secretly placed more than $2 billion of client money with
Bernard L. Madoff.  The agreement provides $405 million to compensate investors
and $5 million for the state, according to a statement today by
the office of New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. In
the case, filed in 2009 by his predecessor,  Andrew Cuomo , the
state claimed Merkin steered assets to Madoff and didn’t
disclose Madoff’s role.  Madoff, who pleaded guilty to running a Ponzi scheme that
authorities say swindled investors of about $17 billion, is
serving a 150-year prison sentence.  The case is People of the State of New York v. J. Ezra
Merkin, 450879-2009, New York State Supreme Court, New York
County (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
