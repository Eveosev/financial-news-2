London’s  Gatwick Airport  will
propose a second runway to make it a gateway to Asia and
increase air capacity into the U.K. capital, the  Sunday
Telegraph  said, citing the airport’s chief executive officer.  Another runway at Gatwick would be less costly and
problematic than building a new airport or expanding London’s
Heathrow Airport, the newspaper reported, quoting Gatwick
Airport Ltd.’s Stewart Wingate.  Global Infrastructure Partners owns Gatwick Airport.  To contact the reporter on this story:
