Nobel Prize-winning economist  Joseph
Stiglitz  said some countries may return to national currencies
if economic institutions aren’t created in the euro region to
make the single currency work, ABC reported.  Even as a return to national currencies used to be
“unimaginable,” it could now happen, Madrid-based ABC quoted
Stiglitz as saying in an interview published today.  He called for joint euro-region bonds, “massive
purchases” of sovereign debt by the European Central Bank, the
creation of a stabilization fund for “solidarity” among
countries and a European banking system, ABC quoted him as
saying. The  European Investment Bank  should be recapitalized so
it can invest in infrastructure projects, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
