The men’s tennis tour will take no
further action against  David Nalbandian , who was defaulted from
the Aegon Championships in  London  a week ago after he injured a
linesman when kicking an advertising board.  “After a review of the incident, the ATP determined that
although David’s actions were unacceptable and under ATP rules
warranted an automatic default, the injury to the linesman was
unintentional,” the ATP World Tour said in a  statement  on its
website today. “As such, it was decided that the sanctions
already levied against David are sufficient in this case.”  The day after the final at Queen’s Club in west London,
police said they were looking into an assault complaint made
against the Argentine player by an unidentified person.  Nalbandian, a former Wimbledon finalist, was disqualified
and sanctioned around $70,000 in prize money and fines, as well
as being docked 150 ranking points following the incident during
his match against Croatia’s  Marin Cilic .  Nalbandian plays Serbia’s Janko Tipsarevic in the first
round of Wimbledon tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
