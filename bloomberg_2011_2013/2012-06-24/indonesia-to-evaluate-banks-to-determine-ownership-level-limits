Indonesia  will determine bank
ownership limits based on a grading system that measures the
quality of lenders’ corporate governance and financial
“health,” Bank Indonesia Deputy Governor Halim Alamsyah said.  Indonesian banks graded three or lower on a five-level
scale won’t be eligible for single-entity majority ownership,
and investors in such banks who own majority stakes will be
required to divest over a five-year period, Alamsyah said at a
seminar in Bogor, West Java today.  The rules, which may affect DBS Group Holdings Ltd.’s bid
for PT Bank Danamon Indonesia, could take effect at the end of
July, Alamsyah said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
