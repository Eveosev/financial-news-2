Monitise Plc (MONI) , which trades on  London
Stock Exchange Group Plc (LSE) ’s Alternative Investment Market for
smaller companies, is looking for new bankers, the  Sunday
Telegraph  said, citing Chief Executive Officer Alastair Lukies.  Monitise’s current adviser is Canaccord Genuity and it is
talking to a number of banks, including  Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS) , the London-based newspaper reported, without saying where
it received the information.  The mobile-payment technology company may move its listing
to the Nasdaq Stock Market in  New York , the newspaper reported.
Any decision wouldn’t be made until after the company completes
its $141 million acquisition of Clairmail Inc. and its full
board meets, the Sunday Telegraph quoted Lukies as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
