A civil war could start in  Syria  if
foreign nations push for a new government in the Middle Eastern
country, a Russian foreign-ministry official said in an
interview with Interfax.  “We have no doubts that foreign attempts to dictate any
program of a regime change in Damascus, as well as the support
of the opposition only, is the direct way to a full-scale civil
war,” Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Morgulov said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
