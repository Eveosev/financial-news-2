Support for Ireland’s two ruling
parties rose to a combined 47 percent as a result of a 2
percentage point increase for  Fine Gael , the larger of the
coalition partners, according to a poll published in today’s
 Sunday Business Post .  The Red C poll showed that backing for Fine Gael rose to 32
points, while support for the  Labour Party , the smaller partner,
had remained steady since a similar poll last month, the
newspaper said.  Fianna Fail, the country’s largest opposition party in
parliament, was unchanged at 18 percent, while  Sinn Fein  fell
three points to 16 percent, it said.  The poll of 1,003 people was carried out between June 18
and June 20. It didn’t give a margin or error.  To contact the reporter on this story:
