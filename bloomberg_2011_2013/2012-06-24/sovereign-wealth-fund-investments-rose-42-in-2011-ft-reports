Sovereign wealth funds made 237
direct investments, valued at $80.9 billion, last year, the
Financial Times reported, citing data collected by the Sovereign
Investment Lab at Bocconi University in Milan.  A significant part of the investing was by funds in
developing countries into developed markets, the FT said, citing
the report.  Much of the money was put into companies with strong
involvement in emerging economies --  LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis
Vuitton SA (MC)  in China and  Iberdrola SA (IBE)  in  Latin America , for
example -- while little was invested in European manufacturing,
suggesting a lack of confidence in the continentâ€™s economy, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
