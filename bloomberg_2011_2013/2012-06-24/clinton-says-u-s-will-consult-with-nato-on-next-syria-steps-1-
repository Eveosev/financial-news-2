Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton 
condemned “in the strongest possible terms” Syria’s shooting
down a Turkish plane and said the U.S. will consult with NATO
and other international groups on next steps.  Clinton said in a statement today that she had spoken with
Turkish Foreign Minister  Ahmet Davutoglu  yesterday. “The
Foreign Minister briefed me on the specifics of the incident,
including that the Syrian military shot its plane down without
warning,” Clinton said. “The  United States  condemns this
brazen and unacceptable act in the strongest possible terms.”  Turkey announced today that the jet, which was downed June
22, was over international waters at the time. The regime of
President Bashar al-Assad claims that the plane had entered
Syrian airspace.  As a full member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,
 Turkey  is entitled to call on Article 5 of the group’s charter,
which sees an attack on one member as an attack on all and
requires a joint response.  For now, Turkey has invoked Article 4, which requires
consultations among the group. NATO announced today that
ambassadors of all 28 NATO members will meet June 26 in response
to Turkey’s request.  To contact the reporter on this story:
