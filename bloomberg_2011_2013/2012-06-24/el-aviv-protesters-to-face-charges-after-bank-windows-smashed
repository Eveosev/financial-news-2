Fifteen social activists arrested in
 Tel Aviv  late Saturday night after protesters smashed bank
windows will be charged today for destroying public property,
causing public disturbances and assaulting police officers,
Israel Police spokesman  Micky Rosenfeld  said.  Another 70 demonstrators arrested last night were freed
without being charged, Rosenfeld said. Social activists are
trying to revive the large-scale demonstrations that took place
last summer in Tel Aviv and other Israeli cities and led the
government to take measures to rein in the cost of housing and
essential consumer items.  Protesters had clashed with police in a June 23
demonstration after the Tel Aviv municipality said it wouldn’t
allow them to set up tent encampments in the city’s business
district, as occurred last summer.  “The Israeli police are acting as if we are police state
instead of a democratic nation,” said Zehava Gal-On, leader of
the Meretz party which is supporting the protests, in an
interview today on Israel Radio.  To contact the reporter on this story:
