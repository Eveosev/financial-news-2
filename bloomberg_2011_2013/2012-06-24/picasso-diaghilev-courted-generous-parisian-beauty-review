Toulouse-Lautrec, Renoir, Bonnard,
Vuillard portrayed her, Ravel dedicated his choreographic poem
“La Valse” to her, and Mallarme, a leader of the Symbolist
movement, glorified her on an autographed fan.  “Misia, Reine de Paris,” an exhibition at the Musee
D’Orsay in Paris, celebrates Misia Sert (1872-1950), the darling
of countless painters, composers and writers.  Her turbulent love life even inspired a play, Cocteau’s
“Les Monstres Sacres.”  The Catalan painter Jose Maria Sert, under whose name she
is remembered today, was her third husband.  Marie Sophie Godebska, born in  St. Petersburg , came to
 France  at a young age. Her first husband, Thadee Natanson,
directed “La Revue Blanche,” mouthpiece of France’s literary
and artistic avant-garde.  When the periodical folded, the ruined Natanson pushed her
into the arms of the press baron Alfred Edwards. The fortune of
her second husband enabled her to do what she liked best -- take
budding artists under her wing.  Fortunately, Sert, too, was a rich man. So the good life,
with sumptuous parties and adoring proteges, continued.  Fairy Witch  Misia was no saint. Valentine Gross Hugo, who also painted
her portrait, described her as “a fairy godmother one moment
and a witch the next, frightfully malicious, adorably generous,
out to destroy everything in the arts that hadn’t been hatched
or at least nurtured within her own four walls.”  Serge Diaghilev, impresario of the Ballets Russes, was her
most important protege.  The exhibition includes replicas of the grotesque costumes
Picasso designed for Erik Satie’s ballet “Parade.” The 1917
premiere was one of the noisy scandals the Ballets Russes
provoked.  To an outraged critic, Satie sent a postcard calling him
“an asshole and an unmusical one at that.” The addressee went
to court, and Satie was sentenced to a week in prison.  The postcard, sadly, isn’t in the show. Instead, there are
letters and portraits featuring Misia’s vast circle of friends,
including Proust, Stravinsky and Cocteau.  The costumes designed by Coco Chanel evoke the friendship
between the two women. After her divorce from Sert, in 1927,
Misia toyed with the idea of becoming a fashion designer.  Spouse’s Pomp  It so happens that the Petit Palais in Paris is devoting an
exhibition to Misia’s third husband.  Jose Maria Sert (1874-1945) wasn’t taken seriously by his
painting contemporaries, and he responded in kind. Cubism,
Surrealism and the other modernisms of the day left him cold.  His model was Tiepolo and the splendors of 18th-century
 Venice . He found plenty of wealthy customers who shared his
traditional taste -- the queen of  Spain , the Vatican and  Nelson Rockefeller , among others.  In the 1930s, Sert worked in  New York , decorating the
Waldorf-Astoria Hotel and the lobby of the RCA Building at
Rockefeller Center.  The Petit Palais presents his wall decorations, including
some large canvases, in a way the great showman would have
appreciated -- with Baroque pomp.  “Misia, Reine de Paris” runs through Sept. 9. The show
will travel to the Musee Bonnard in Le Cannet, France, (Oct. 13-
Jan. 6, 2013). Information:  http://www.musee-orsay.fr . “Jose
Maria Sert: Titan at Work” is at the Petit Palais through Aug.
