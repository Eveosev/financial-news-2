Dana Gas PJSC (DANA) , the fuel producer
with $1 billion in Islamic bonds maturing in October, said it
resumed partial production at its Khor Mor liquefied petroleum
gas plant in the Kurdish region of Iraq after a fire.  The blaze during filling at the plantâ€™s loading facility on
June 22 killed one person and caused extensive damage, Dana Gas
 said in a statement  to the Abu Dhabi bourse today. The plant
partially started yesterday from a facility supplying natural-
gas to local power stations, according to the statement.  Sharjah, United Arab Emirates-based Dana Gas is struggling
to obtain payments for its operations in Iraq and  Egypt ,
hampering its ability to invest and expand. The company has been
active in the Kurdistan region of  Iraq  since April 2007 and
began production of gas and condensate at the Khor Mor gas field
in 2008, according to its website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
