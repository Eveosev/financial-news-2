Japanese and Australian  stock
futures  rose as the dollar strengthened, boosting the earnings
outlook for Asian exporters.  American Depositary Receipts  of Canon Inc., a Japanese
camera maker that gets 80 percent of its revenue overseas, rose
0.8 percent from the closing share price in Tokyo. ADRs of
Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. climbed 0.8
percent. Those of Mitsubishi Corp., Japan’s top commodities
trader by market value, added 0.6 percent after  oil prices 
increased. Renesas Electronics Corp. may be active after the
Nikkei newspaper reported the Japanese chipmaker may sell 50
billion yen ($622 million) of new shares to KKR & Co.  Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in
September closed at 8,830 in Chicago on June 22, up from 8,780
in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 8,820 in
Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index added 0.3 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
gained 0.5 percent in Wellington.  “The yen remains weak, which will support investors to buy
blue-chips,” said  Kenichi Hirano , general manager and
strategist at Tachibana Securities Co. in Tokyo.  The dollar appreciated to as high as 80.52 yen today in
Tokyo, compared with 80.45 yen at the close of  stock trading  on

companies when repatriated. The Australian dollar, or Aussie,

Sydney.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.3
percent today. The index rose 0.7 percent in New York on June 22
as bank downgrades from Moody’s Investors Service were no worse
than the firm had warned. The ratings firm cut Morgan Stanley by
two levels rather than a threatened three grades. Banks rose the
most among the 24 industry groups in the  S&P 500 .  Oil Rises  Crude oil for July delivery gained from an eight-month low,
rising 2 percent to settle at $79.76 a barrel in New York on
June 22.  The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded Chinese

last week, led by a 9.7 percent slump in China Unicom ( Hong
Kong ) Ltd.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  rose 0.2 percent this year
through June 22, compared with a 6.2 percent advance by the S&P
500 and a 0.8 percent gain by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks
in the Asian benchmark are valued at 1.2 times book value,
compared with 2.1 times for the S&P 500 and 1.4 times for the
Stoxx 600, according to Bloomberg data. A number below 1 means
companies can be bought for less than value of their assets.  To contact the reporters on this story:
