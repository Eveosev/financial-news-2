Turk Hava Yollari AO (THYAO) , or Turkish
Airlines, may bid for a stake in Irish carrier  Aer Lingus Group
Plc (AERL)  , the Sunday Business Post said, citing unidentified people.  Turkish Airlines may bid for the government’s 25 percent
stake in Dublin-based Aer Lingus or make a joint offer with
another airline, as it is precluded as a non-European Union
company from owning more than a 49 percent stake in an EU
carrier, the newspaper said.  The Istanbul-based company is among a number of
international airlines assessing the Irish carrier, the report
said. Ryanair Holdings Plc made a renewed bid for Aer Lingus
last week.  An external spokeswoman for Aer Lingus, who asked not to be
named, declined to comment. A Transport Ministry spokesman
didn’t immediately respond to a text message requesting comment.  Editors:  To contact the reporter on this story:
