Bahrain’s National Gas Co., known as
Banagas, is reviewing prices of natural gas sold locally to
industrial companies, Alwatan newspaper said, citing chief
executive officer Mohamed bin Khalifa  Al Khalifa .  Banagas is awaiting the results of a study it’s undertaking
with an international consultancy firm to determine the new
pricing structure, the Bahraini  daily  quoted Al Khalifa as
saying.  Global prices for the fuel have fluctuated this year and in
Bahrain they are the highest in the Gulf region, Al Khalifa was
quoted as saying.  Banagas is 75 percent owned by Bahrain’s government while
the remaining 25 percent is equally owned by the Arab Petroleum
Investments Corp. and Chevron Bahrain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
