Germany ’s economy might shrink by as
much as 10 percent in the year after a breakup of the euro, Der
Spiegel reported, citing an unpublished study from the German
Finance Ministry.  The number of jobless in Germany would rise to more than 5
million if the currency union falls apart, the magazine cited
the study as saying in an  article  on its website today. Germany
had 2.87 million unemployed in May, the Federal Labor Agency
said on May 31.  The German Finance Ministry “won’t take part in
speculation about alleged secret papers,” Silke Bruns, a
ministry spokeswoman in Berlin, said by telephone today. She
said she isn’t aware that such a study exists.  The numbers suggest that the cost of rescuing the euro is
the lesser evil compared with a return to national currencies,
according to a Finance Ministry official  Der Spiegel  didn’t
identify by name.  To contact the reporter on this story:
