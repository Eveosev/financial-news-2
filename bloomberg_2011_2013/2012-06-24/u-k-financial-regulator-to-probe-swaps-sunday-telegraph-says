The U.K.’s  Financial Services
Authority  will say on June 29 that it has discovered that some
of the country’s banks inappropriately sold complex interest-
rate derivatives to small businesses, the  Sunday Telegraph  said.  Banks expect the regulator to formally investigate the
matter, which would take at least a year and could lead to
financial penalties for banks and bans on any bankers who
violated FSA rules, the newspaper said, without saying where it
got the information. Lenders could also be pressed to agree to
compensate any victims of mis-selling, according to the report.  “We will update on our findings by the end of this
month,”  Joseph Eyre , a spokesman for the FSA, said in a phone
interview today. “We’re not commenting in the interim.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
