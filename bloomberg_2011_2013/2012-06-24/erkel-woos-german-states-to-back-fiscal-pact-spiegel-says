Chancellor Angela Merkel  is offering
federal aid to Germany’s states in a bid to win their
parliamentary support for the European Union’s fiscal pact,  Der
Spiegel   reported , without saying how it got the information.  Merkel proposed this month that the federal government pick
up all of any fine that’s due if Germany’s total public deficit
exceeds limits set in the pact, the magazine said today. The
federal government normally pays just 65 percent of such fines
with the rest falling to the states.  Merkel lacks a majority in the upper house of parliament,
or Bundesrat, which groups delegates of Germany’s 16 states.
Two-thirds majorities in both houses are needed for Germany to
ratify the fiscal pact.  To contact the reporter on this story:
