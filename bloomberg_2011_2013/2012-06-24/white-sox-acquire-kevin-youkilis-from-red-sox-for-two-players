Kevin Youkilis  was traded to the
 Chicago White Sox  after 8 1/2 seasons with the  Boston   Red Sox ,
where he played on two World Series championship teams and was
selected as an All-Star three times.  The White Sox sent utilityman Brent Lillibridge and pitcher
Zach Stewart to the Red Sox for Youkilis, who leaves  David Ortiz 
as the only remaining holdover from the team that ended Boston’s
86-year Major League Baseball title drought in 2004.  Youkilis, 33, has been limited to 42 games this season
because of a lower back injury and became expendable in Boston
with the play of 23-year-old Will Middlebrooks. Youkilis can
play both corner infield positions and will probably take over
at third base in Chicago as Brett Morel was hitting .177 for the
AL Central  Division-leading  White Sox before going on the
disabled list with a back injury.  Youkilis hit a triple in his final at-bat for the Red Sox
yesterday and came out of the dugout to acknowledge a standing
ovation from the Fenway Park crowd after being pulled from the
game in favor of a pinch-runner. He’s hitting .233 with four
home runs and 14 runs batted in this season.  “He’s legendary,” Red Sox manager  Bobby Valentine  said at
a news conference yesterday when asked about Youkilis’s ovation.
“His work ethic, his dedication, his ability out on the field.
He’d never come off the field with a clean uniform and always
gave it everything he had. The fans here get it, there’s no
doubt about it.”  Youkilis is a career .286 hitter with 133 homers and 563
RBI, and in 2007 won a Gold Glove award for his defense.  Lillibridge, 28, was hitting .175 with two RBI and seven
stolen bases in 49 games this season while playing first base,
third base and in the outfield. Stewart, a 25-year-old right-
hander, had a 1-2 record with a 6.00 earned run average in 18
games, including one start, for the White Sox.  To contact the reporter on this story:
