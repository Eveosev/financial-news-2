A collapse of  Italy ’s economy would
mean a collapse of the euro, the Italian Deputy Prime Minister
Antonio Catricala told  Il Messaggero  in an interview.  “Europe and our partners shouldn’t act to help us, but to
help themselves,” Catricala was cited as saying in the daily
newspaper. “Only a stronger and more united Europe has a
future.”  The cost of borrowing on the markets for Italy has risen
toward the level that prompted Greece, Ireland and  Portugal  to
request outside financial aid amid mounting concern the euro-
area sovereign-debt crisis is spreading to the region’s larger
economies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
