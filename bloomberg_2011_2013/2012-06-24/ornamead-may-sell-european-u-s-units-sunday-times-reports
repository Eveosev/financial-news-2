The family owners of Lornamead
Group, the owner of toiletry brands including Simple soap, may
sell its European and U.S. units, the Sunday Times reported,
without saying where it got the information.  The Jatania brothers may sell the divisions for as much as
120 million pounds ($187 million), the newspaper said. The
family will retain the Asia and African units.  Barclays Plc (BARC)  has
been hired to assess the sale of the Europe division and Sawaya
Segalas & Co. LLC for the U.S. business, according to the Sunday
Times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
