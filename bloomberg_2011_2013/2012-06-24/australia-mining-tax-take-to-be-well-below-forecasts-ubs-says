Australia ’s planned mining tax will
raise less than half the amount forecast by the nation’s
Treasury in the next two years and reduce profit estimates for
 BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  and  Rio Tinto Ltd. (RIO) , UBS AG said.  Mining companies, including BHP, Rio and  Fortescue Metals
Group Ltd. (FMG) , will pay A$1.8 billion ($1.8 billion) in the 2013
fiscal year and A$1.4 billion in 2014, compared with government
forecasts for revenue of A$6.5 billion in both years,  Glyn Lawcock , a Sydney-based analyst at UBS, wrote in a report dated
June 22. The bank cut its estimates for profits at both BHP and
Rio by 4 percent for 2013, citing the impact of the mining and
carbon taxes, which take effect on July 1.  The mining levy “is designed to be a volatile stream of
 tax revenue  for the Australian government, but funding a stable
and growing series of government obligations,” Lawcock wrote.
“As a result of this mismatch of a declining revenue position
on our commodity price forecasts and rising obligations, we
believe a future Labor government may seek to either raise the
tax rates or bring in other commodities.”  The government, seeking to return the nation’s budget to a
surplus in the year ending June 30, 2013, has said A$1.8 billion
in revenue from the mining tax will be diverted to increases in
family payments. Australia’s price on  carbon emissions , set at
A$23 a metric ton, is expected to raise A$24.7 billion in four
years. The nation will transition to an emissions trading system
in 2015 that lets the market determine the cost.  Carbon Price  The carbon price will contribute to Australia’s economic
growth that will include creating an extra 1.6 million jobs by
the end of the decade, Treasurer  Wayne Swan  said in his weekly
economic note today, citing Treasury modeling. The average
income per person will rise about 16 percent, he said.  The carbon tax will increase electricity prices by an
average of A$3.30 a week, raising the cost of living by 0.7
percent, he said. More than 98 percent of households with
incomes of as much as A$150,000 will receive some government
assistance, in the form of tax cuts and increased payments, and
all families making less than A$100,000 will get help, he said.  “In the years to come no first-rate economy can be
anything other than a clean-energy economy,” Swan said. “Every
cent raised from a price on carbon will be used to provide tax
cuts and increased benefits to households, to support the most
affected industries and the jobs that depend on them, and to
tackle  climate change .”  Falling Prices  The carbon price is projected to increase power supplier
 AGL Energy Ltd. (AGK) ’s earnings-per-share by 10.8 percent in the 2013
financial year, while lowering profit at  Qantas Airways Ltd. (QAN)  by
11.6 percent and  Virgin Australia Holdings Ltd. (VAH)  by 14.7 percent,
JPMorgan Chase & Co. Ltd. said on June 18.  Iron-ore prices have declined 20 percent, and mining
company valuations 24 percent, over the past year as slowing
economic growth erodes demand. Rio in April pulled out of talks
for a potential coal port expansion in Queensland state, citing
uncertainty in global economic markets.  BHP will pay $715 million in mining tax and about A$300
million in carbon tax in the year ending June 30, 2013, Lawcock
said. The mining tax will cost Rio $676 million, and the carbon
tax $202 million in the 2013 calendar year, he said.  The most emissions-intensive businesses, including those
belonging to BHP, Rio and  Alumina Ltd. (AWC) , as well as liquefied
natural gas projects, will be eligible for carbon tax assistance
from the government, Lawcock said.  Earnings Downgrades  While this will help Alcoa Worldwide Alumina reduce its
carbon tax liability to about A$20 million from A$380 million
before the assistance, Lawcock still cut Alumina’s 2013 earnings
estimate by 5 percent to A$130 million. Alumina owns 40 percent
of Alcoa Worldwide Alumina.  The bank also cut  Whitehaven Coal Ltd. (WHC) ’s expected earnings
for 2013 by 8 percent,  Mount Gibson Iron Ltd. (MGX)  by 6 percent and
 BC Iron Ltd. (BCI)  by 5 percent.  The mining tax, levied on 30 percent on earnings of iron
ore and coal, is payable when a company’s annual profits reach
A$75 million, so as not to burden smaller businesses, Lawcock
said. BHP and Rio’s coal divisions won’t be required to pay any
mining tax in the near term, and other coal miners’ liabilities
may also not be large, he said.  The government expects to raise A$3.2 billion from the
mining tax in fiscal 2015 and A$3.7 billion in 2016, compared
with UBS’s forecasts of A$1.1 billion in the year ending June 30,
2015 and A$538 million in 2016.  Fortescue, the nation’s third-biggest iron-ore exporter, is
suing the government, saying the tax discriminates between
states, curtails their sovereignty and restricts their ability
to encourage mining.  Western Australia state Premier  Colin Barnett  has pledged
to participate in any action, saying opposing the tax would be
in the best interest of all state citizens, the Western
Australia Today newspaper reported on March 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
