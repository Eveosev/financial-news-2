Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc (RR/)  is seeking
a new chairman to replace Simon Robertson, who may step down
next year, the Sunday Times newspaper reported, without saying
where it got the information.  The company is in the early stages of the search process
and may seek to employ Nigel Rudd, chairman of Invensys Plc, or
U.S.-based candidates as it looks to increase international
diversity on its board, the paper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
