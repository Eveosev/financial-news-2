Copper futures, down 16 percent this
year, may fall by next month to the lowest since mid-2010, based
on  technical analysis  by Matt Zeman at Kingsview Financial LLC.  The attached chart of monthly prices shows that copper on
the Comex in  New York  broke out of a triangle pattern formed by
a high in February 2011 of $4.6575 a pound and a low of $2.994
in October that year. Declines beneath the lower line of the
triangle in the past three months signal a 10 percent drop to
$2.75 by early August, Zeman said in a telephone interview.  “The charts look bearish,” said Zeman, a strategist at
Kingsview in  Chicago . “The inability to maintain any meaningful
rally is also a bearish factor. We could see a pretty quick
slide lower.”  Copper has dropped this year amid signs of a slowing
economy in  China , the world’s biggest consumer of the metal, and
concern that Federal Reserve policy makers will reduce stimulus
in the U.S. The metal hasn’t traded as low as $2.75 since June
2010.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts of trading
