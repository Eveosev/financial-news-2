Investment firm Starboard Value LP
said it has acquired a 6.9 percent stake in  Emulex Corp. (ELX) , a
chipmaker that’s seeking potential buyers.  Starboard owns 6.25 million shares of Costa Mesa,
California-based Emulex, the investor said in a U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission filing yesterday.  Emulex has hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to seek potential
buyers, two people with knowledge of the situation said last
week. They asked not to be identified because the process is
private. Before today, Emulex had  declined  21 percent since
rejecting an $11-a-share bid from  Broadcom Corp. (BRCM)  in 2009,
leaving it with a market value of $694.2 million.  Activist investor Elliott Management Corp., the hedge-fund
firm founded by billionaire  Paul Singer , is Emulex’s largest
 shareholder  with about 10 percent of the stock. Emulex added two
Elliott appointees to its board under a standstill agreement in
March that permits Elliott to wage a proxy battle or initiate a
tender offer as early as Aug. 12 under certain conditions,
according to a statement at the time.  Emulex shares rose 2.9 percent to $7.86 at the close in New
York. The stock has climbed 18 percent since July 2, the last
trading day before  Bloomberg News  reported that the company had
hired Goldman Sachs.  Emulex, which sells chips that help computer servers and
storage networks transfer data, traded as high as $109.61 in
2001 before dropping to $4.53 in March 2009 as the recession and
weakened demand crimped profit. In July 2009, Emulex said
Broadcom’s sweetened $11-a-share takeover bid undervalued its
clean balance sheet and long-term expansion prospects.  To contact the reporter on this story:
