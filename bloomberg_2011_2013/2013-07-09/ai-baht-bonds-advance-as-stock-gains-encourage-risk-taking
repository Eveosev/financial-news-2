Thailand ’s baht rebounded from a 10-month low and government bonds advanced as gains in regional
stocks encouraged risk-taking.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of shares climbed 1.6 percent,
the most this month, after the Bloomberg Dollar Index, which
tracks the greenback against 10 major trading partners, fell
yesterday. The baht weakened 7.1 percent in three months, the
second-worst performance after  India ’s rupee among Asia’s 11
most-traded currencies, on speculation the Federal Reserve will
cut stimulus that has spurred demand for emerging-market assets.  “Risk sentiment is recovering as stocks are rising,” said
 Tsutomu Soma , manager of Rakuten Securities Inc.’s fixed-income
business unit in  Tokyo . “We are also seeing a correction from
the recent dollar strength, but the main trend remains for the
regional currencies to see downward pressure amid lingering
speculation of the Fed tapering.”  The baht climbed 0.5 percent, the most since June 25, to
31.29 per dollar as of 3:41 p.m. in Bangkok, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 31.53 yesterday, the weakest
level since Aug. 21, 2012. One-month implied volatility, a
measure of expected moves in the exchange rate used to price
options, climbed 12 basis points, or 0.12 percentage point, to
7.69 percent.  The Bank of Thailand will keep its benchmark interest rate
at 2.5 percent tomorrow, according to 17 of 18 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. One predicts a cut of 25 basis points.  The yield on the 3.625 percent government bonds due June
2023 dropped 10 basis points to 3.74 percent, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
