Spot gasoline in the  New York  Harbor
market reached the strongest level against futures in six months
on concern that Irving Oil Corp.’s Saint John refinery will slow
output after last week’s train derailment in  Quebec .  The  spread for reformulated , 84-octane gasoline, or RBOB,
in the New York Harbor widened 0.5 cent to of 3 cents above
futures at 2:25 p.m., the highest level since Jan. 7, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Conventional, 83.5-octane
gasoline, or CBOB, gained 0.38 cent to 12 cents below futures.  Gasoline inventories  in the New York Harbor region,
referred to as PADD 1B, plunged  1.96 million barrels  to 31.8
million barrels last week, the lowest level since May 31,
according to EIA data.  Stockpiles may fall further after a crude oil train heading
for the  298,000-barrel-a-day Saint John refinery  derailed and
exploded, killing at least 13 people. Over half the refinery’s
finished products, including gasoline and diesel, are exported
to the U.S. Northeast, according to the  company’s website .  Irving Oil was unloading 80,000 to 90,000 barrels a day of
crude from rail cars last month and planned to increase volumes,
Gary Weimer, quality assurance manager of Mid-Continent crude
for the company, said during an oil quality conference in
Seattle June 6.  The 3-2-1 crack spread in the region, a rough measure of
refining margins for gasoline and diesel based on Brent oil in
 Europe , widened 81 cents to $16.90 a barrel, the highest since
June 19.  Gulf Coast  Gasoline on the Gulf Coast also gained against futures,
reaching a three-week high as a Petroleos de  Venezuela  SA
refinery in Curacao remained shut because of a  power failure .  The discount  for conventional, 85-octane gasoline, or CBOB,
shrank 3.12 cents to  15.63 cents a gallon  versus New York
Mercantile Exchange futures at 3:45 p.m., the narrowest spread
since June 16.  The gap slimmed after Romeo Rudolph of PDVSA said its
Curacao refinery was still down following a July 7 blackout.
Providing the company can get steam from the utility plant,
PDVSA planned to restart the  335,000-barrel-a-day refinery 
today, he said. A coker at PDVSA’s Amuay refinery, in Venezuela,
is expected to restart this week as well.  As product is shipped to the Caribbean to meet potential
demand from PDVSA, supplies on the  Gulf Coast  may tighten.
Stockpiles of motor fuel in the region, known as PADD 3, were at
a four-month high of  77.9 million barrels  on June 28, according
to Energy Information Administration data.  The  margin for Gulf Coast refiners , based on West Texas
Intermediate oil in Cushing,  Oklahoma , advanced $1.86 to $15.46
a barrel. The same spread based on Light Louisiana Sweet oil
increased $1.96 to $9.71 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
