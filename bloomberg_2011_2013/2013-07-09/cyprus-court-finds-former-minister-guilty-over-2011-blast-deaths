A Cypriot court found former Defense
Minister Costas Papacostas guilty of manslaughter over a blast
at a naval base in 2011 that killed 13, injured 62 and knocked
out half of Cyprus’s electricity supply.  Papacostas was directly responsible for a series of
failures to properly safeguard a cargo of munitions stored at
the base that had been seized from a ship in 2009 by the Cypriot
authorities, a court ruled today, according to the decision
handed out to reporters and read out on state-run RIK TV.  Gunpowder and shell casings were kept at the naval base for
months in high temperatures and Papacostas ignored warnings from
his staff about the increasing risks, according to the court
decision.  Papacostas will be sentenced on July 24 along with two
senior fire-fighting officials and the former commander of the
country’s disaster response squad, who were found guilty of
causing death by negligence, according to the court decision.  Markos Kyprianou, who was foreign minister at the time of
the blast on July 11, 2011, along with Savvas Argyrou, the
former deputy commander of Cyprus’s National Guard, were cleared
of all charges related to the explosion at the Evangelos
Florakis naval base. The blast seriously damaged the adjacent
Vassilikos power plant, the country’s largest, and killed the
head of the country’s navy.  Relatives of those killed condemned the court for failing
to sentence all those charged and also blamed Demetris Christofias, who was Cypriot president at the time, in comments
televised live on RIK.  The U.S., Britain and  France  said in 2009 that the Islamic
Republic of Iran Shipping Lines had chartered the Russian-owned,
Cypriot-flagged Monchegorsk vessel to send weapons-related
material, including what they described as “bullet shells” and
anti-tank munitions, to  Syria . Iran said at the time that the
seizure of the arms shipment was illegal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
