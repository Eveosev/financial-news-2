U.S.  stocks  rose for a fourth day
amid optimism companies will report better-than-forecast
earnings and that economic growth is strong enough to withstand
any reduction in Federal Reserve stimulus.  Nine out of  10 groups  in the  S&P 500  advanced. FedEx Corp.
rallied 4.4 percent, to lead industrial shares higher. An S&P
gauge of homebuilders added 5.5 percent as all 11 members
advanced. Kroger Co. climbed 2.7 percent after saying it will
buy  Harris Teeter Supermarkets Inc. (HTSI)  in a deal valued at $2.5
billion. Alcoa Inc. slipped even after posting earnings that
beat analysts’ estimates and maintaining its forecast for global
aluminum demand.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500  climbed 0.7 percent to 1,652.32
in New York, the highest in almost six weeks. The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  rose 75.65 points, or 0.5 percent, to
15,300.34 today. More than 5.8 billion shares traded hands on
U.S. exchanges today, or 8.1 percent below the three-month
average.  “Everybody’s waiting to see what earnings are going to
look like,” Brian Jacobsen, who helps oversee $221.2 billion as
chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Advantage Funds in
 Menomonee Falls ,  Wisconsin , said by telephone. “Until we see
more earnings roll in, we’re waiting until tomorrow for what the
Fed says. A lot of the other things are preludes or noise.”  The  S&P 500 (SPX)  has gained 2.4 percent in the last four days,
its longest winning streak since May 15, as better-than-estimated economic data on employment and manufacturing tempered
concern over a scaling back of Fed bond buying. Investors will
gain more insight into the central bank’s plans tomorrow when
Chairman  Ben Bernanke  speaks and the  Federal Open Market
Committee  publishes minutes from its June meeting.  Stimulus Curtailment  The benchmark gauge plunged as much as 5.8 percent from a
 record high  on May 21, when Bernanke first suggested the Fed
might curb stimulus this year if growth meets the central bank’s
estimates. The S&P 500 has since risen 5 percent from its June
low and is 1 percent off the record. The index today surpassed
its level on June 18, the day before a 4.8 percent rout started
as the Fed’s policy-making committee suggested tapering could
occur as early as in September.  The  International Monetary Fund  today lowered its 2013
projection for U.S. growth to 1.7 percent from 1.9 percent in
April. The IMF said global growth will struggle to accelerate as
U.S. expansion weakens,  China ’s economy levels off and  Europe ’s
recession deepens.  Buying Opportunity  The Fed stimulus and better-than-estimated corporate
earnings have helped fuel a rally that lifted the S&P 500 by as
much as 147 percent from its bear-market low in 2009. The start
of the earnings season, which is traditionally marked by  Alcoa (AA) ’s
report, has been a buying opportunity during that time. The S&P
500 has risen 13 of the 17 times Alcoa has posted results in the
 bull market , adding an average 1.6 percent in the two weeks
following the company’s release.  Earnings at companies listed on the S&P 500 rose 1.8
percent last quarter, down from a projection of 8.3 percent six
months ago, according to more than 11,000 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Lower expectations helped about 73
percent of the companies in the benchmark measure exceed
 forecasts  by an average of 5.1 percent for the first three
months of the year, Bloomberg data show. There are no S&P 500
companies scheduled to report today.  “Expectations for second-quarter earnings had fallen quite
a bit and we’re beginning to see that the downgrades were by too
much,” Jacobsen said. “We could see some pleasant surprises in
the earnings season.”  Alcoa Results  Alcoa, the first member of the Dow to release results,
slumped 0.1 percent to $7.91. The largest U.S. aluminum producer
said profit excluding one-time items was 7 cents a share, more
than the 6-cent average of 15 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
Sales fell to $5.85 billion, also exceeding the $5.79 billion
average of nine estimates.  Alcoa  maintained  its forecast that global aluminum demand
will rise by 7 percent this year, led by 11 percent growth in
China. Demand will exceed supply by 315,000 tons, the company
said in  presentation slides  for the conference call.  The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, or
VIX, slid 2.9 percent to 14.35. The equity volatility gauge,
which moves in the opposite direction as the S&P 500 about 80
percent of the time, reached a six-month high on June 20 and has
fallen 30 percent since.  Industrial stocks rose 1.5 percent for the second-biggest
gain among 10 S&P 500 groups behind materials producers.
Caterpillar Inc. surged 2.6 percent to $85.33 for the largest
increase in the Dow.  FedEx Rally  FedEx jumped 4.4 percent to $103.15 amid speculation that
it may be an investment target for  William Ackman ’s Pershing
Square Capital Management LP. The company also agreed to settle
a lawsuit claiming it had been “systematically overcharging”
customers by billing businesses and government offices at higher
residential rates. United Parcel Service Inc. added 1.6 percent
to $89.73.  The S&P Supercomposite Homebuilding Index rallied 5.5
percent, rebounding after falling yesterday to a low for the
year. D.R. Horton Inc. surged 7.6 percent to $21.22, the biggest
gain since April. KB Home climbed 6.7 percent to $18.86.  Cisco Systems Inc. jumped 2.2 percent to $25.16 after
announcing a deal with Microsoft Corp. on cloud computing
infrastructure.  Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA)  advanced 1.5 percent to $123.45.  Nasdaq 
OMX Group Inc. said the maker of electric cars will join the
Nasdaq-100, which tracks the biggest companies on the Nasdaq,
before the start of trading on July 15. The best-performing
automotive stock this year will replace Oracle Corp., which is
moving to the New York Stock Exchange.  Bookseller Executive  Barnes & Noble Inc., which is considering separating and
spinning off its divisions, jumped 5.4 percent to $18.61. The
U.S. bookstore chain said Chief Executive Officer William Lynch
resigned. The company promoted Chief Financial Officer Michael
Huseby to president of the company and CEO of Nook Media, making
him Barnes & Noble’s most senior executive.  International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)  dropped 1.9 percent
to $191.30 for the biggest retreat in the Dow. Goldman Sachs
Group Inc.  downgraded  the largest technology-services provider
to a neutral rating from buy. The firm expects growing pressure
on IBM’s growth areas in  emerging markets . Goldman cut the price
target for the stock to to $200 from $220.  Kroger, the largest U.S. grocery chain, climbed 2.7 percent
to $37.15 after saying it will buy Harris Teeter in a deal
valued at $2.5 billion. The smaller regional chain added 1.5
percent to $49.26.  Intuitive Surgical Inc. plunged 16 percent, the most in
almost five years, to $419.30 after reporting preliminary
results that missed analysts’ estimates as sales slowed for its
surgical robots.  To contact the reporters on this story:
