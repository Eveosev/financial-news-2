Health Management Associates Inc. (HMA) , a
hospital operator considering strategic alternatives, reached
its highest market value in six years after a news report said
the company has attracted takeover interest.  Health Management gained 7.6 percent to $16.64 at 3:01 p.m.
 New York  time, after earlier reaching $17.06, the highest
intraday price since March 2007. The Naples, Florida-based
company had attracted interest from  Community Health Systems
Inc. (CYH) , the second-largest publicly traded U.S. hospital company,
and other rivals, Reuters reported today, citing people familiar
with the matter.  Health Management, which operates 71 hospitals in the U.S.,
said last month it had hired Morgan Stanley and Weil, Gotshal &
Manges LLP as advisers to consider strategic alternatives in the
face of pressure from its largest shareholder, Glenview Capital
Management LLC, to oust the board and top executives. MaryAnn
Hodge, a spokeswoman for Health Management, said today that the
company doesn’t intend “to disclose developments with respect
to the foregoing until such time as the board deems further
disclosure appropriate.”  Glenview, which holds about 15 percent of the company’s
shares, has criticized the leadership’s “substandard strategic
and financial approach.” Glenview declined through a
spokeswoman to comment on today’s report.  A spokesman for Franklin, Tennessee-based  Community Health 
didn’t immediately respond to a message seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
