Ingersoll-Rand Plc (IR)  Chief Executive
Officer Mike Lamach said Allegion Plc, the security unit that’s
being spun off, may have a market capitalization of about $4
billion when it begins trading at the end of this year.  Allegion, which sells residential and commercial door
locks, will have about 100 million outstanding shares, Lamach
said in a telephone interview today. That would value each share
at about $40. David Petratis, who previously ran  Quanex Building
Products Corp. (NX) , was named CEO of the business.  Ingersoll, the maker of air-conditioning systems and
climate-control technologies, announced the split in December
after billionaire investor  Nelson Peltz  pushed for a breakup.
Peltz’s Trian Fund Management LP held a 4.5 percent stake in
Swords, Ireland-based Ingersoll as of March 31, according to
 data  compiled by Bloomberg.  “It’s really creating the value that we thought we would
create in terms of the estimated value,” Lamach said. “You
really end up here with a company that, although you’ve got a
couple of billion starting revenue, you’ve got enterprise value
and market cap that’s double that.”  Allegion, which is also based in Ireland, will have its
operating headquarters in Carmel,  Indiana . Allegion will have
annual revenue of about $2 billion, and employ about 7,600
people in 35 countries, according to a statement today.  Ingersoll  rose  0.9 percent to $57.76 at 10:57 a.m. in New
York. The shares had gained 19 percent this year through
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
