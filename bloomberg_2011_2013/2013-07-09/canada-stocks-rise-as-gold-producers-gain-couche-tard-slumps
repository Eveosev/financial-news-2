Canadian  stocks  rose, sending the
benchmark index to the highest level in three weeks, as an
advance in precious metals prices overshadowed disappointing
earnings from companies including Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc.  OceanaGold Corp. and Argonaut Gold Inc. rallied at least
7.1 percent as gold climbed. Alimentation Couche-Tard, which
operates convenience stores across North America and Europe,
slumped 5 percent after adjusted earnings fell short of
forecasts due in part to higher expenses in Europe.  Jean Coutu
Group Inc. (PJC/A) , the pharmacy company, fell 2.1 percent after posting
first-quarter revenue short of estimates.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  rose 88.22
points, or 0.7 percent, to 12,297.09 at 4 p.m. in Toronto. The
gauge has rallied 3.9 percent since hitting its low for the year
on June 24. Trading volume was 18 percent below the 30-day
average at this time of the day.  “We’re seeing some buying in the gold sector, likely
because the entire sector was so oversold,” said Arthur Salzer,
chief executive officer of Northland Wealth Management in
Toronto. The firm manages C$225 million ($213 million). “There
was so much optimism in Couche-Tard and Jean Coutu, that once in
a while the stocks get ahead of themselves. The underlying
numbers were quite good but maybe not what people were hoping
for.”  The International Monetary Fund cut its projection for
global growth in 2013 for a fifth time, to 3.1 percent from 3.3
percent in April as a U.S. expansion weakens,  China ’s economy
levels off and Europe’s recession deepens. U.S. growth was
trimmed to 1.7 percent from 1.9 percent, while China’s was
lowered to 7.8 percent from 8 percent.  Gold Gains  Raw-materials stocks  paced gains  in the S&P/TSX, rising 1.7
percent as a group. OceanaGold jumped 8.5 percent to C$1.28 and
Argonaut Gold gained 7.1 percent to C$5.58 as gold futures for
August delivery advanced 0.9 percent to $1,245.90 an ounce in
New York. The S&P/TSX Gold Index climbed 1.1 percent as 18 of 25
members advanced.  First Majestic Silver Corp. rallied 4.7 percent to C$11.70
and Pan American Silver Corp. rose 3.2 percent to C$12.13 as
silver prices gained.  BlackBerry Ltd. (BB) , maker of the BlackBerry 10 line of
smartphones, added 1 percent to C$10.20 after investors re-elected the company’s existing directors at an annual general
meeting today and approved the company’s name change from
Research In Motion Ltd.  Chief Executive Officer Thorsten Heins said at the meeting
the company is “100 percent open to partnerships” to drive
scale and will explore “every opportunity” to create value.  Consumer-staples companies, which include both Jean Coutu
and Couche-Tard, lost the most in the S&P/TSX, declining 0.9
percent as a group.  Couche-Tard  Couche-Tard, the  largest  publicly traded convenience store
chain operator in North America, sank 5 percent to C$58.35, for
its biggest decline since May 2012. The Laval, Quebec-based
company said fourth-quarter adjusted  earnings  were 61 cents a
share, while analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had estimated 78
cents. Merchandise and service gross margins in the U.S., where
Couche-Tard operates the Circle K convenience-store chain,
declined 0.1 percent in the quarter.  Jean Coutu lost 2.1 percent to C$17.44. The Longueuil,
Quebec-based company reported first-quarter revenue of C$681.6
million, falling short of forecasts for C$688.2 million.
Adjusted earnings for the period were 26 Canadian cents a share,
in line with analysts’ estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
