It was difficult to hear the voices
of the women in prayer shawls over the shouts from the crowd
outraged at what they were doing: worshiping as men do at
Judaism’s holiest prayer site.  Police set up barricades and deployed hundreds of officers
to protect the women from the ultra-Orthodox Jews -- some
hurling eggs and curses, some yelling “Death to the Reform” --
who gathered July 8 at the Western Wall in  Jerusalem ’s Old City
to protest women wearing garments and performing rituals
that tradition reserves for men.  The clash was the latest flare-up over the power the
religious hold in Israel. The  Women of the Wall  began its
crusade for equal worship at the shrine 25 years ago, and it’s
been gaining momentum as a combination of forces chips away at
the influence of the ultra-Orthodox, now out of government for
the first time in a decade.  “We don’t need one authority, one Jesus figure, a
community of Jesus figures, interpreting God for the rest of the
community,” said Susan Silverman, a Jerusalem rabbi and sister
of American comedian  Sarah Silverman , who was arrested at the
wall in February on grounds she disturbed the peace.  Warriors for religious pluralism are an odd sight in
Israel, where Jews tend to be traditional or not at all devout.
Their campaign is getting a tailwind from a public that’s grown
less tolerant of privileges the ultra-Orthodox enjoy and from a
justice system sometimes more liberal than Israeli society.  Privileges Backlash  “I think the broad sentiment against the ultra-Orthodox
turns things that the ultra-Orthodox oppose into things that
should be supported,” said Yedidia Stern, director of research
at the Israel Democracy Institute in Jerusalem.  While the ultra-Orthodox make up less than 10 percent of
 Israel ’s 8 million people, they wield great influence, largely
because they often control enough seats in parliament to give
prime ministers a majority.  Called haredim in Hebrew, for those who tremble, they
usually live in isolated communities and strictly separate the
sexes. The government excuses most of ultra-Orthodox men from
military service, subsidizes their religious institutions and
helps to support their families.  The ultra-Orthodox rabbinate’s exclusive right to perform
marriages, divorces and burials has fueled frictions with
secular Israelis, about 40 percent of the population. Some
modern Orthodox also resent the allowances made for the most
conservative Jews.  Lost Clout  January elections cost the ultra-Orthodox considerable
clout as secular and modern Orthodox parties allied to keep them
out of the government.  Finance Minister Yair Lapid has cut funding to their
community in the proposed budget. The Justice Ministry recently
ruled against the gender segregation rabbis have tried to impose
on some buses, sidewalks and other public spaces. And Israel’s
Cabinet approved a bill to make military or community service
mandatory for most ultra-Orthodox men.  The main plaza spreading out from the Western Wall, a
remnant of the biblical Jewish temple, is divided into gender-segregated sections, just as Orthodox synagogues are.  The Women of the Wall gather there on the first day of the
month in the lunar Hebrew calendar. Though they stay in the
women’s section, they perform male rituals, wearing skull caps
and small boxes called tefillin that contain scrolls inscribed
with verses from the Jewish holy book, the Torah.  Provocation Seen  Shmuel Litoff, an ultra-Orthodox man who has observed the
wall protests, sees the women as provocateurs.  “It’s not a question of Jewish law, it’s a question of
tradition,” he said. “If I go into a mosque wearing shoes, is
that a problem?” he asked, referring to the Muslim tradition of
removing footwear before entering a prayer site. “The wall is a
synagogue, and there was always a way to pray in a synagogue.”  A poll by the Israel Democracy Institute showed 48 percent
of Israeli Jews support the women’s quest, with 38 percent
opposed. The survey of 600 people in the last week of April had
an error margin of 4.5 percentage points.  The lack of religious pluralism in Israel drives a wedge
between the country and the non-Orthodox who constitute the
majority of the world’s Jews, said Gilad Kariv, a rabbi and
executive director of the Israel Movement for Reform and
Progressive Judaism.  “When they see women with prayer shawls prevented from
praying near the wall, it’s hard to identify with this holy
place,” he said.  ‘Local Custom’  Israel’s  Supreme Court  ruled in 2003 that the women had the
right to pray freely at the wall, if they don’t offend “local
custom” -- a phrase it didn’t define.  Over the past year, police arrested dozens of women on
grounds they disturbed the peace. The women scored a victory in
April, when an observant Jerusalem judge ruled they weren’t
causing unrest or violating the law by praying at the wall
“according to their custom.”  That was a red flag for some ultra-Orthodox. At the monthly
service May 10, thousands flooded the wall plaza, some spitting
and throwing chairs, and calling the women whores and lesbians.  On July 8, hundreds of black-hatted young men roared,
clapped and sang to drown out the women’s prayers. In a sign the
court ruling didn’t end the women’s battle, police barred them
from the women’s section at the plaza where they usually pray.  Too Dangerous  Police officer Hagit Rappaport Ben Hamo said thousands of
ultra-Orthodox girls had responded to their rabbis’ call to pack
the women’s section, making it too dangerous to let any more in.  “We’re at the back of the bus, and it’s not even
upholstered,” said Lesley Sachs, Women of the Wall’s director.
“It’s capitulation to hooliganism.”  Last year, Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  deputized
Natan Sharansky, the former Soviet dissident and current
chairman of the Jewish Agency for Israel, to find a way to hold
egalitarian worship at the wall. Sharansky proposed renovating
an adjacent area for pluralistic prayer and linking it
structurally to the main plaza.  The plan would require construction near a contested holy
site known to Jews as  Temple Mount  and to Muslims as Noble
Sanctuary. Past work there has provoked unrest by Palestinians
who lay claim to the compound, which Israel captured along with
the rest of east Jerusalem and the  West Bank  in 1967.  While obstacles remain, the women are cheered by the
positive momentum. Anat Hoffman, chairwoman of Women of the
Wall, said she thinks the group is “part of a bigger phenomenon
that is disturbing the Israeli public.”  “When I was arrested on Oct. 16, 2012, not one word of
this got into the Israel press,” Hoffman said. “Not a word.
Nothing. Now I can’t get the journalists out of my house.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
