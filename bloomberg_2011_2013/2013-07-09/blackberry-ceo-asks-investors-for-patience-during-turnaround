BlackBerry Ltd. (BBRY)  Chief Executive
Officer Thorsten Heins asked investors for patience at the
company’s annual meeting today, following a surprise quarterly
loss last month that raised concerns about its turnaround.  The company only introduced its new line of BlackBerry 10
devices about five months ago, and early sales aren’t an
indication of its long-term prospects, he said at the meeting,
held in BlackBerry’s hometown of Waterloo, Ontario. The new
flagship Z10 phone missed estimates in its first full quarter on
sale, contributing to a 28 percent stock plunge on June 28.  “BlackBerry is still in the early phases of our
transition,” Heins said. “This isn’t just the launch of a new
product but a whole new platform. While many will judge us on
the basis of one quarter of a single product, we are not a
devices-only product.”  While Heins returned the company to profit two quarters ago
by squeezing out more than $1 billion in operating costs,
BlackBerry swung back to a loss last quarter and expects more
red ink in the current period. The shares’ tumble after last
month’s earnings was the steepest drop in 13 years and reversed
a rally in the stock that began last September.  The Z10 -- more than two years in the making and designed
to win over the touch-screen users of Apple Inc.’s iPhone and
Samsung Electronics Co.’s Galaxy lineup -- sold almost a million
units fewer than analysts had projected last quarter. Now
BlackBerry is counting on the Q10, a model with a physical
keyboard that was introduced in the U.S. in June, to appeal to
the dwindling base of customers who favor that design.  Subscriber Decline  BlackBerry’s worldwide subscriber base slipped to 72
million last quarter, from 76 million and 79 million in the
preceding quarters. BlackBerry’s share of the global smartphone
market fell to 2.9 percent in March as it was bumped into fourth
place by Microsoft Corp.’s Windows Phone platform, according to
research firm IDC. Apple’s iOS and Google Inc.’s Android
operating system, used by Samsung, together accounted for 92
percent of the market.  At today’s meeting, shareholders also voted to officially
change the company’s name from  Research In Motion Ltd. (BB)  to
BlackBerry Ltd. -- a move intended to simplify its branding and
marketing.  BlackBerry shares rose 2.8 percent to $9.82 at 11:29 a.m.
in  New York . The stock had fallen 20 percent this year through
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
