Holdings in gold-backed exchange-traded products fell below 2,000 metric tons for the first time
since May 2010 after bullion slumped on expectations the Federal
Reserve will taper stimulus measures.  Assets declined 24 percent, or 638.2 tons, this year to
1,993.76 tons, heading for the first annual drop since the
products were introduced in 2003, and wiping $61 billion from
their  value , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Holdings
reached a record 2,632.52 tons in December as gold  climbed  for a
12th year, the data show.  Bullion slid 23 percent last quarter, the biggest loss
since at least 1920, as some investors lost faith in the metal
as a store of value and Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke indicated
the central bank may slow asset purchases if the economy
continues to improve. ETP assets may fall a further 500 tons in
the next 12 months, UBS AG estimates. Holdings in the SPDR Gold
Trust, the biggest such product, fell to a four-year low.  “A lot of investors are starting to exit their hedge
against unorthodox monetary policy in the U.S.,” Dominic Schnider, head of commodities research at UBS’s wealth-management unit in  Singapore , said in a phone interview today.
“As an insurance asset, gold, which worked out so well for
people in the past few years, is not attractive anymore.”  The decline in ETP holdings this year is equivalent to
about 22 percent of mined output in 2012, which was 2,847.7
tons, according to the World Gold Council. Total gold demand was
4,405.5 tons last year, comprising 1,534.6 tons of investment
demand in the form of bars, coins and ETPs.  Gold Slumps  At the peak in December, assets in gold ETPs were the
world’s third-largest hoard when compared with national
reserves. They have now fallen to fifth place behind the U.S.,
 Germany ,  Italy  and  France , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg and the council.  Prices plunged 25 percent in 2013 to $1,249.18 an ounce,
sliding into a bear market in April and heading for the worst
annual drop since 1981. The MSCI All-Country World Index of
equities climbed 6.4 percent and the dollar gained 5.6 percent
against a basket of six major currencies.  SPDR Gold Trust assets fell 1.6 percent to 946.96 tons, the
lowest since February 2009, according to  data  compiled by
Bloomberg. Billionaire investor  George Soros  joined funds run by
Northern Trust Corp. and BlackRock Inc. in cutting holdings in
the SPDR in the first quarter, U.S. government filings showed in
May. John Paulson, the biggest investor, kept his stake of 21.8
million shares.  Paulson, Goldman  Paulson’s PFR Gold Fund posted a 23 percent decline last
month, according to a letter to investors. The drop brings the
loss to 65 percent since the start of the year, the firm said in
a July 3 letter, a copy of which was obtained by Bloomberg News.
The fund, with about $300 million in assets, consists mostly of
Paulson’s own money and is the smallest at the firm, which
manages $19 billion.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its price target for the end
of 2013 to $1,300 from $1,435 and expects ETP holdings to
decline by about 1 million ounces a month, it said in June. The
bank joins analysts from Morgan Stanley to Credit Suisse Group
AG in trimming forecasts.  “The real story for owning gold from a kind of an
inflation protection perspective has just not materialized,”
Jeffrey Sherman, who helps manage more than $57 billion of
assets for DoubleLine Capital in Los Angeles, said in a
telephone interview. “You’ve got to think about why you own the
precious metal to begin with and right now it’s hard to make a
very bullish case for it.”  Coins, Jewelry  Sales of coins and jewelry surged around the world after
bullion plunged in April, spurring a 13 percent rebound in
prices in less than three weeks. There are now signs interest
has slowed, with the U.S. Mint selling 57,000 ounces of American
Eagle gold coins in June from 209,500 ounces in April, according
to data on its website. Sales from Australia’s Perth Mint
declined for a second month in June, it said last week  U.S. President Richard Nixon severed the dollar peg to gold
in 1971 and the government lifted curbs on citizens owning gold
at the end of 1974.  To contact the reporters on this story:
