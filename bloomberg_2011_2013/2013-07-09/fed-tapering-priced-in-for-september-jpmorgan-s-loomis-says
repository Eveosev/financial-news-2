U.S. bond yields suggest investors
anticipate the Federal Reserve will announce a reduction in
asset purchases at its September policy meeting, according to
JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Heather Loomis.  Tapering “does appear to be baked in,” with as much as 80
percent of the market expecting it, Loomis, director of fixed
income in San Francisco for JPMorgan Private Bank, said during a
television interview with Sara Eisen and  Erik Schatzker .  Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke “has effectively said
tapering will being and end within a year,” said Loomis, who
helps oversee $909 billion in assets. “The market is looking at
2014 as the start of rates hikes.”  Yields on  10-year notes,  the benchmark for everything from
home mortgages to car loans, have risen about 45 basis points to
2.64 percent since June 19, when Bernanke said policy makers may
begin reducing asset purchases this year and end them in 2014.
His comments were followed by two U.S. employment reports that
showed higher-than-forecast job gains.  The Fed is buying $85 billion of Treasuries and mortgage
bonds every month to put downward pressure on borrowing costs.
Policy makers have also kept their target rate for overnight
loans between banks at zero to 0.25 percent since 2008 to
support the economy.  “Over the longer term, interest rates are moving higher,”
Loomis said. “If you see changes in yields as a result of true
healing and true growth in both GDP and employment within the
economy,” both Treasury yields and the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index “can move up in tandem,” she said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
