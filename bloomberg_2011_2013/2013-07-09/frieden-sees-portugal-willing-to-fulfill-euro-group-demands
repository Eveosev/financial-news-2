Luxembourg Finance Minister Luc Frieden comments on  Portugal ’s new government and the
disbursement of the next international aid installment to
Greece.  He spoke to reporters before a meeting of European Union
finance ministers in Brussels today.  On Portugal:  “I do think that the  Portuguese government  can make a
fresh start. Not everything is in place yet, but I do think that
the Portuguese government wants stability and that it is also
willing to fulfill all that we in the euro group demand of
Portugal.”  On Greece:  “Yesterday’s decision was the right thing to do because we
are in a process and this process means that each side must
honor their commitments. Greece has said that some things still
have to be done. This will happen in the coming days, maybe even
today. We on the other hand will continue to help Greece.”  “I think it’s about paying these 6.8 billion euros to
Greece, as agreed, on the condition that  Greece  does its
homework and Greece has done a lot in the last few months and in
the last years. Some things still remain to be done.”  “We must make an effort to have fiscal consolidation and
structural reforms at the same time. It’s important that we
always see, also in our countries, that sound public finances
are the basis for growth, but also, above all, that structural
reforms are necessary.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
