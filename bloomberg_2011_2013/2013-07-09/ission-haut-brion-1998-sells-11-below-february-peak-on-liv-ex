Two cases of 1998 Chateau La Mission
Haut-Brion, a Pessac-Leognan vineyard in  Bordeaux ’s southern
suburbs, sold for 2,575 pounds ($3,850) each on the London-based
Liv-ex wine market, 11 percent below its February peak.  The price for yesterday’s deal was the lowest since Jan.
28, although 43 percent up from the level at which it traded as
recently as August, according to Liv-ex’s Cellar Watch website.  The London-based Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index has risen 5
percent this year, with a gain in the 10 weeks to mid-March
followed by a 3 percent drop since then. Restrained demand for
Bordeaux 2012 futures has weighed on prices of other vintages.  ”Demand remains reasonable, but participants have limited
appetite for taking positions,”  Chris Smith , investment manager
at The Wine Investment Fund in  London , wrote in his monthly
market report. “This seems unlikely to change over the
summer.” The fund, invested in Bordeaux, manages $50 million.  The 1998 La Mission ranks as the estate’s fifth highest-priced wine of the past 15 years, lagging those from 2010, 2009,
2005 and 2000, according to merchant prices collated by  Liv-ex 
on its Cellar Watch website.  The vintage was awarded a 98 rating on a 100-point scale by
U.S. critic  Robert Parker , below those for this century’s four
more expensive vintages, according to the  eRobertParker.com 
website. The 2009 and 2000 wines were awarded 100-point scores.  Chateau La Mission Haut-Brion has been owned since 1983 by
Domaine Clarence Dillon, proprietor of neighboring first-growth
wine estate Chateau Haut-Brion.  La Mission produces mainly red wine from  Cabernet
Sauvignon , Merlot and Cabernet Franc grapes. It also makes
smaller quantities of white wine, and traces the history of its
vineyards back to the early sixteenth century.  To contact the reporter on this story:
