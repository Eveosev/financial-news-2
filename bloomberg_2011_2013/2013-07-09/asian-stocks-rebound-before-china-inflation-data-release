Asian  stocks  rose, with the regional
equities gauge on course to rebound from its biggest drop in two
weeks, as a weakening yen pushed  Japan ’s Topix index to a seven-week high and industrial companies advanced.  Toyota Motor Corp., which gets 75 percent of its auto sales
outside Japan, gained 2.6 percent. BHP Billiton Ltd., the
world’s largest mining company, advanced 2.1 percent in Sydney
as metals prices climbed. Olympus Corp. sank 5.4 percent in
 Tokyo  after the biggest endoscope maker said it plans to sell as
much as 118 billion yen ($1.2 billion) of shares.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 1.6 percent to 131.44 as
of 7:34 p.m. in Hong Kong, with all 10 industry groups on the
gauge climbing. The measure fell 10 percent through yesterday
from a five-year high on May 20 amid concern the U.S. Federal
Reserve will begin tapering stimulus as China’s economy slows
and Japan puts off unveiling economic reform policies until
after upper house elections later this month.  “We are now tactically overweight on Japanese equities,”
 Binay Chandgothia , a fund manager at Principal Global Investors
in Hong Kong, where he helps oversee $280 billion, said by
telephone. “You want to be tilted toward developed markets
because although growth in the west isn’t great, economic
surprises have been decent and financial conditions are easier
than in  emerging markets .”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index yesterday fell 1.5 percent, the
most since June 24. That left the gauge trading at 12.7 times
average estimated earnings compared with 14.9 for the S&P 500
and 13 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Regional Gauges  Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  advanced 0.5 percent. The
measure fell 9.2 percent this year through yesterday, the worst
among 24 developed markets tracked by Bloomberg News.  The Shanghai Composite rose 0.4 percent, having swung
between gains and losses, as a report showed Chinese consumer
prices rose more than forecast last month.  Australia ’s S&P/ASX
200 Index advanced 1.5 percent and South Korea’s  Kospi index 
rose 0.7 percent.  Singapore ’s Straits Times Index added 0.7
percent and  Taiwan ’s Taiex Index increased 1.1 percent. New
Zealand’s NZX 50 Index gained 0.7 percent.  Japan’s  Topix index  added 2.1 percent to close at the
highest level since May 22. The gauge last week capped its
biggest increase across three weeks since April 2009, amid a
weakening yen and optimism Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will push
through economic reforms after winning upper house elections on
July 21. The yen slid 0.3 percent to 101.22 per dollar as of
5:11 p.m. in Tokyo.  Exporters Rise  Asian exporters gained. Toyota advanced 2.6 percent to
6,410 yen and  Nissan Motor Co. (7201)  climbed 4 percent to 1,090 yen in
Tokyo. Yue Yuen Industrial (Holdings) Ltd., which makes shoes
for Nike Inc., gained 1.4 percent to HK$19.78 in Hong Kong.  “Developed markets will have the upper hand for the next
three to six months,” Tai Hui, Hong Kong-based chief Asia
market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, which oversees
about $1.5 trillion globally, told Bloomberg TV. “If the U.S.
continues to grow, it’s demand for Asian exports is likely to
improve over time as well. In the short-term, developed markets
like the U.S. and Japan are going to outperform.”  Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and China
International Capital Corp. were among brokerages in the past
two weeks that reduced projections for Chinese economic growth
this year to 7.4 percent, below the government’s 7.5 percent
goal. Alcoa Inc. chief executive officer Klaus Kleinfeld told
CNBC he’s “really not concerned” about the expansion of
 China ’s economy.  China Inflation  China’s statistics bureau said today consumer prices rose
2.7 percent in June. That compares with a 2.1 percent gain in
May and a 2.5 percent median estimate of analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  Raw-material shares and industrial companies advanced. BHP
Billiton gained 2.1 percent to A$31.61 and  Rio Tinto Group (RIO) 
advanced 0.8 percent to A$52.04 in Sydney. The  London  Metal
Exchange LMEX Metals Index gained 1.2 percent, the most in a
week, in London yesterday. Komatsu Ltd., the world’s second-biggest maker of construction and mining equipment, added 3.5
percent to 2,335 yen in Tokyo.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  added 0.5
percent today. The gauge advanced 0.5 percent yesterday, a third
day of gains, as the start of corporate earnings season fueled
increased optimism about growth in the world’s largest economy.  Olympus (7733)  sank 5.4 percent to 2,928 yen. As many as 41
million shares will be sold in markets including the U.S. and
Europe, the Tokyo-based company said in a statement yesterday.
That amounts to 12 percent of the stock outstanding after the
sale. The proceeds will also be used for capital spending and
the remaining funds may be spent to repay debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
