Ascent Solar Technologies Inc. (ASTI)  agreed
to build a manufacturing plant in eastern  China .  Ascent will produce thin-film solar products in Suqian, in
Jiangsu province, the Thornton, Colorado-based company said
today in a statement.  In the first phase of the agreement, Ascent will own as
much as 80 percent of a joint venture it will form with the city
of Suqian. The solar company will provide $1.6 million in cash
and equipment and the municipal government will contribute $32.5
million and rent-free use of a 270,000 square-foot facility.  The budget for the first phase is about $160 million and
Ascent may purchase the plant anytime within five years at the
initial construction cost. The partners expect the agreement to
eventually include three phases.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
