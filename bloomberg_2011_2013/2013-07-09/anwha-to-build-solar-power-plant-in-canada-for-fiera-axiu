(Corrects to remove reference to Hanwha unit in third
paragraph.)  Hanwha Group, a closely held South
Korean industrial conglomerate, agreed to build a solar power
project in  Canada  for Fiera Axium Infrastructure Inc.  The Ontario Solar Photovoltaic Farm will be located at four
sites in Ontario and is expected to have 42.5 megawatts of
generating capacity, Seoul-based Hanwha said today in an e-mailed statement. It may produce enough energy to power 5,000
average Ontario homes a year, Hanwha said.  The projects will use solar panels manufactured in Ontario
by Hanwha. The company in August agreed to buy Q Cells SE, a
German solar cell manufacturer that was once the world’s
largest.  Hanwha expects to begin construction in Ontario this month
and complete the project in early 2014. The project’s cost
wasn’t disclosed.  Fiera Axium is a Toronto-based private-equity firm that
focuses on transportation and energy projects in Canada,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
