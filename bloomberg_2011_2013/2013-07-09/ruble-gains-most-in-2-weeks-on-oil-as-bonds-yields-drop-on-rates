The ruble strengthened the most in
more than two weeks as emerging-market currencies rallied and
government bonds rose on speculation the central bank may cut
rates at the end of the week.  The ruble appreciated 0.8 percent against Bank Rossii’s
basket of dollars and euros, the most since June 21, to 37.1837
by 6 p.m. in Moscow, when the central bank stops its trading
operations. The yield on benchmark OFZs due February 2027
declined eleven basis points, or 0.11 percentage point, to 7.77
percent, the lowest since June 19.  An index of emerging-market currencies compiled by
Bloomberg rose 0.3 percent to 93.35. Brent oil was little
changed in  London  at $107.47 per barrel. Bank Rossii may loosen
monetary policy at its next meeting with a 25 basis-point cut to
short-term rates after inflation slowed in June, Morgan Stanley
analysts said July 8.  “It looks like everybody’s preparing for the possible
central bank rate cut,” Mikhail Vashchenko, a money manager at
Kapital Asset Management LLC, said by e-mail. “There are a lot
of speculative positions around OFZs, especially by local
players.”  The Finance Ministry plans to offer 10 billion rubles ($303
million) of OFZ bonds due January 2018 at a proposed yield of
6.60 percent to 6.65 percent at an auction tomorrow, it said in
a statement on its website.  Fed Minutes  The finance ministry is also offering 10 billion rubles of
bonds due 2023 at a yield range of 7.38 percent to 7.43 percent.
It sold all 20 billion rubles of 2018 bonds offered in an
auction on July 3 at an average yield of 6.83 percent.  The ruble strengthened 0.8 percent against the dollar to
32.9505 and advanced 0.8 percent against the euro. While the
ruble is the fifth-best performer among 24 emerging currencies
tracked by Bloomberg today, it’s about 8 percent weaker against
the dollar since the beginning of the year.  “What’s happening, we view as a correction” after a
decline last week, Anton Zakharov, commodities and foreign
exchange analyst at OAO Promsvyazbank, said by e-mail.  The U.S. Federal Reserve will tomorrow release minutes of
its June 18-19 meeting, after which Chairman Ben Bernanke said
the central bank may taper its $85 billion in monthly bond
buying, causing the ruble to drop to a 20-month low. Bernanke
will also speak on economic policy in Boston tomorrow.  Raised Band  “The upward trend in the dollar was likely over on the day
after Bernanke announced the tapering,” Mikhail Palei, a
foreign-exchange trader at VTB Capital, said by phone from
Moscow. “Now we’ll likely see range-bound trading with the
ruble’s potential decline limited by the level where the central
bank sells a lot.”  Bank Rossii, which reports FX intervention data with a one-day lag, sold 6.65 billion rubles equivalent of foreign currency
on July 5, boosting the total amount spent since interventions
began on May 29 to 137.7 billion rubles.  The regulator has raised the band in which it allows the
ruble to trade against its target dollar-euro basket by 5 kopeks
to 31.75-38.75, according to a person familiar with the matter,
who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t
public.  The central bank moves the corridor by 5 kopeks when non-target currency interventions reach $450 million, according to
its website.  With non-target interventions at about 25 percent of the
total amount of currency sold, and “if the basket continues to
trade around 37.00-37.50, we should see a five kopeks shift up
every nine working days,” Vladimir Kolychev, chief economist
and strategist at OAO  Rosbank (ROSB) , said by e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
