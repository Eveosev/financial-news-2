The pound fell to a three-year low
against the dollar after U.K. manufacturing unexpectedly shrank
in May, casting doubt on the strength of the recovery.  Sterling weakened versus all but two of its 16 major peers
even as data showed a  house-price gauge  rose to the highest
since January 2010 last month and retail sales climbed.  Bank of
England  policy makers led by Governor  Mark Carney  signaled last
week they will keep U.K. interest rates at a record low. U.K.
government bonds advanced for a second day as investors sought
safer assets. The Debt Management Office sold index-linked gilts
maturing in 2029.  “The pound’s fallen after the data,” said Lee McDarby,
head of dealing on the corporate and institutional treasury desk
at Investec Bank Plc in  London . “We’ve had some fairly robust
data recently so for this to be negative is a little bit of a
punch in the stomach for the pound. It’s not looking
particularly great for sterling right now.”  The pound slipped 0.8 percent to $1.4832 at 4:42 p.m.
London time after dropping to $1.4814, the lowest since since
June 23, 2010. The U.K. currency was little changed at 86.08
pence per euro and touched 86.69 pence, the weakest level since
March 14.  Sterling pared its decline versus the euro after European
Central Bank Executive Board Member Joerg Asmussen signaled
monetary policy will remain accommodative for more than a year,
undermining demand for the 17-nation currency.  Sterling has weakened 1.4 percent in the past month,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track
10 developed-nation currencies. The dollar strengthened 4
percent and the euro was little changed.  Output Falls  Factory  output  fell 0.8 percent from April, when it
declined 0.2 percent, the  Office for National Statistics  said in
London. The median forecast of 25 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey was a 0.4 percent increase.  “We are sceptical that these data truly reflect the state
of the manufacturing sector,”  Brian Hilliard , a U.K. economist
at Societe Generale SA in London wrote in a note to clients.
“We look for a bounce in June.”  The housing-price index increased to 21 in June from 5 a
month earlier, the London-based  Royal Institution  of Chartered
Surveyors said, citing a monthly poll of property surveyors. A
positive number means more respondents saw values increase
rather than decline. The  British Retail Consortium  said like-for-like  retail sales  rose an annual 1.4 percent in June.  House Prices  U.K. data last week showed an index of manufacturing
expanded more in June than economists estimated and  house prices 
climbed to the highest level in almost three years.  “There is a lot of evidence that the U.K. economy is now
beginning to gather some momentum,”  Louise Cooper , an analyst
at CooperCity in London, said on Bloomberg Television’s
“Countdown” with Anna Edwards and  Mark Barton . “The problem
with economic data is that it is very difficult to pick a trend
out of it. What the economy desperately needs is growth.”  The benchmark 10-year gilt yield fell five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 2.43 percent after climbing to 2.59
percent on June 24, the highest since October 2011. The 1.75
percent security due September 2022 rose 0.39, or 3.90 pounds
per 1,000-pound face amount, to 94.42.  The U.K. sold 1.4 billion pounds of index-linked gilts due
in March 2029 at an average yield of minus 0.043 percent. The
securities were last auctioned on April 24 at minus 0.635
percent.  The 15-year break-even  rate , a gauge of market inflation
expectations derived from the yield difference between gilts and
index-linked securities, fell for a second day. It narrowed five
basis points to 3.17 percentage points after reaching 3.26
yesterday, the widest since April 12.  Gilts handed investors a loss of 3.8 percent this year
through yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes.
German bonds dropped 1.4 percent and Treasuries declined 3.5
percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
