Canadian investigators will examine
the design of the 111-class cars carrying the crude oil that
ignited after the derailment that killed at least 13 people in
Lac-Megantic,  Quebec , according to officials with the federal
Transportation Safety Board.  Ed Belkaloul, an investigator speaking to reporters at the
site of the July 6 accident, said the TSB will also examine
procedures the company, Montreal,  Maine  & Atlantic Railway Ltd.,
used to operate the train, and will seek to answer questions
such as whether the train should have been parked where it was.  Canada has sought improvements to the design of the DOT-111
cars, officials said.  “There’s a number of operational issues, including the
operation of the train, the requirements and company policies
regarding securement of trains,” said Donald Ross, the TSB’s
lead investigator.  “We’ve had a long record of advocating for further
improvements to many of these 111s because they are a very
common type of tank car, they carry very large volumes of
petroleum products,” he said.  The number of confirmed dead remains at 13, as officers
searching for bodies were forced out of part of the disaster
zone because of “hot spots,” according to provincial police
spokesman Benoit Richard.  Some officers were medically treated and released an hour
later in good condition, the Surete de Quebec’s Richard told
reporters at a separate press conference. Representatives from
 Montreal , Maine and Atlantic Railway, are co-operating with
police, Richard said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
