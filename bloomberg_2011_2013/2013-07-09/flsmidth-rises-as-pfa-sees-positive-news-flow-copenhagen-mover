FLSmidth & Co. A/S (FLS) , the maker of
cement and mining equipment, rose to its highest in more than
week as investors sought out stocks that give them exposure to a
turnaround in the global economy.  FLSmidth  rose  as much as 2.9 percent to 266.30 kroner, the
highest since June 28. Shares in the Copenhagen-based company
gained 2.7 percent to 265.70 kroner at 12:58 p.m. in the
capital. Volume was 81 percent of the three-month daily average  “The news flow is overall positive in both the U.S. and
the rest of world,” Henrik Henriksen, chief strategist for PFA
Pension, said in a note to investors. “We prefer still stocks
ahead of bonds in our portfolio for the next three to six
months.”  Global aluminum demand will rise by 7 percent this year,
led by 11 percent growth in  China , Alcoa Inc. said yesterday,
reiterating earlier guidance. The largest U.S. aluminum producer
also reported better-than-expected results, triggering gains in
mining companies BHP Billiton Ltd. and Anglo American Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
