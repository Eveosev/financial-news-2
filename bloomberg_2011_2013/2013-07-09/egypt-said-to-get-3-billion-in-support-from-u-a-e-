The  United Arab Emirates , the Arab
world’s second-biggest economy, pledged $3 billion in financial
aid to Egypt, less than a week after President Mohamed Mursi was
toppled, according to an Egyptian official.  The package includes $1 billion in aid and a $2 billion
interest-free deposit with the Egyptian central bank, the
official said, who asked not to be identified because the
details haven’t been made public yet. The U.A.E. had pledged a
similar amount in 2011 after long-serving President  Hosni Mubarak  was ousted, though Egyptian officials said the money
never came through.  Egyptian Central Bank Governor Hisham Ramez traveled to the
U.A.E. for talks this week, stoking speculation an aid package
would follow. The potential support reflects the unease with the
 Muslim Brotherhood , which has inspired similar Islamist
movements across the region.  The U.A.E. foreign ministry’s media relations department
didn’t respond to calls after working hours, and Egyptian
presidential adviser Ahmed El-Meslemani couldn’t immediately be
reached for comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
