The European Court of  Human Rights 
said that the U.K. life sentences for three convicted murderers
constitutes inhumane or degrading treatment because there is no
hope of release.  The Strasbourg, France-based court said a possible review
of the life sentences must be offered to Douglas Vinter, Jeremy
Bamber and  Peter Moore , who were all convicted of murder.  “Whole life orders should include the possibility of
review but this should not be understood as giving the prospect
of imminent release,” the Grand Chamber of the ECHR, which
hears appeals from the main court, said in a statement on
today’s ruling.  The ECHR had previously dismissed the three men’s appeals
last year on grounds that the murders were “particularly brutal
and callous.” This followed a similar ruling from the U.K.’s
High Court in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
