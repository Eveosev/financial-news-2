The U.K. markets regulator is
reviewing whether there is enough competition in insurance add-on products, which are sold along with purchases such as
vacations or a car.  The market study is looking at whether consumers understand
what they are getting and how firms respond to expectations,
Martin Wheatley, the chief executive officer of the Financial
Conduct Authority, will say in a speech later today.  “We’ve called for evidence and approached a number of
firms in the market for information,” Wheatley will say,
according to the FCA. “We are testing whether poor outcomes in
add-on sales could reflect particular consumer behavioral traits
and firms’ responses to them.”  The regulator is looking at several other areas of
insurance and has published its findings into car and mobile-phone insurance, and how firms handle claims.  To contact the reporters on this story:
