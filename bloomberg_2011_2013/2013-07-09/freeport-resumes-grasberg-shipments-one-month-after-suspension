Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) 
resumed concentrate shipments from its Grasberg complex in
 Indonesia  about a month after warning it may miss deliveries
from the world’s second largest  copper mine .  “We have resumed shipments but have yet to reach normal
level,” Rozik B. Soetjipto, president director at unit PT
Freeport Indonesia, said in mobile-phone text message yesterday.
He didn’t provide details.  Freeport on June 12 declared force majeure on shipments
from the mine in Papua province, a statement that allows it to
miss deliveries because of circumstances beyond its control.
Indonesia ordered the company to suspend work at the mine after
a tunnel collapse on May 14 that killed 28 workers.  The resumption of sales may increase copper supplies and
extend the 14 percent drop in prices this year. Copper for
delivery in three months rose 0.3 percent to $6,848.25 a metric
tons on the London Metal Exchange at 11:41 a.m. in Jakarta.  Phoenix, Arizona-based Freeport restarted Grasberg on June
22 after the government approved milling and open-pit
operations, Daisy Primayanti, a spokeswoman, said June 24. The
open pit has reached normal output, Freeport’s Soetjipto said on
July 1.  Freeport’s Indonesian unit lost about 115 million pounds
(52,000 metric tons) of copper and 115,000 ounces of gold
between May 15 and June 21, the company said in a statement June
24. The underground stoppage has reduced output by about 1
million pounds and 1,000 ounces of gold a day, it said. The
company needs clearance from the Energy and Mineral Resources
Ministry to resume underground operations, Soetjipto said then.  To contact the reporters on this story:
