Corn futures gained for a second day,
extending the steepest climb in almost three weeks, on
speculation the U.S. government may pare its crop estimate for
the world’s largest grower. Soybeans also increased.  The grain for delivery in December, after the U.S. harvest,
advanced as much as 0.9 percent to $5.05 a bushel on the  Chicago 
Board of Trade, after closing 1.9 percent higher yesterday, the
biggest rise since June 19. Futures, which traded at $5.04 at
9:33 a.m. in  Singapore , slumped to $4.895 on July 5, the lowest
level since October 2010.  The corn harvest in the U.S. will probably total 13.983
billion bushels this year, smaller than the 14.005 billion
predicted by the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  last month,
according to the average estimate of 20 analysts and trading
firms surveyed by Bloomberg. The USDA is due to update its
outlook on supply on July 11.  “The December contract has already hit a bottom,”  Tetsu Emori , a commodity fund manager at Astmax Asset Management Inc.,
said by phone from  Tokyo  today. “If the USDA reduces its supply
estimate as hot weather stresses crops, we’re looking at higher
prices. Weather conditions are uncertain.”  Soybeans for delivery in November rose as much as 0.9
percent to $12.635 a bushel in Chicago, extending yesterday’s 2
percent climb. They last traded at $12.5875. Soybean meal for
December delivery rose 0.9 percent to $371.40 per 2,000 pounds,
after yesterday climbing 2.9 percent, the biggest gain for the
most-active contract since June 11.  Port Strike  A sailor strike at Argentina’s Timbues/San Lorenzo port is
slowing grains and oilseed exports, Guillermo Wade, a port
official from Rosario said in a phone interview. Farmers in
 Argentina , the world’s largest soybean-meal exporter, also went
on strike last month, halting sales of grains and livestock to
protest government policies including a tax increase in grain
and oilseed exports.  “ China  is probably struggling to import soybeans and
soybean meal from the U.S. after the Argentine strike,” Emori
said. China is the largest consumer of soybeans and the meal
used to feed livestock and poultry, while the U.S. is the
world’s largest grower and exporter of the oilseed.  Wheat for delivery in September also rose for a second day,
adding 0.2 percent to $6.64 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
