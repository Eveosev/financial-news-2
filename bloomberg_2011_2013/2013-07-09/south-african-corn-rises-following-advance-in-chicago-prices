South African corn futures rose,
tracking prices that climbed for a second day in Chicago trading
on speculation the U.S. government may reduce its estimate for
the national crop.  White corn for delivery in December, the most active
contract, gained 0.4 percent to 2,282 rand ($227) a metric ton
by the noon close on the South African Futures Exchange in
Johannesburg. The yellow variety for delivery in September
increased 0.5 percent to 2,206 rand a ton.  Farmers in the U.S. will probably reap 13.983 billion
bushels of corn this year, less than the 14.005 billion
predicted by the Department of Agriculture last month, based on
the average estimate of 20 analysts and trading firms surveyed
by Bloomberg. The USDA is due to update its outlook on supply on
July 11.  “The Chicago market traded higher last night and today,”
Lindy van Blommestein, a trader at Johannesburg-based Farmwise
Grains (Pty) Ltd., said by phone.  South Africa  is the continent’s largest producer of corn.
Meal made from the white variety is a staple food, while yellow
corn is mainly used as  animal feed .  Wheat for delivery in December dropped 1 percent to 3,400
rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
