U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew
said China needs to move toward a more market-determined
 exchange rate , calling changes in the  yuan ’s value inconsistent.  “We have seen some movement, which is a good thing,” Lew
said on  CNN ’s Fareed Zakaria program, according to a transcript
the network released today. “But we’ve also seen that the
movement kind of comes and goes and it flattens out and there’s
still a gap.”  The U.S. and China start two days of strategic and economic
talks tomorrow in Washington. “We’ll continue to raise the
issue until we get to where we need to be, which is market-determined exchange rates,” Lew said.  He also urged China to stop stealing the intellectual
property of American companies.  “The cyber theft of  trade secrets  is a real form of
theft,” Lew said, according to the transcript. “And it’s
something that we’ve said has to stop.”  He said the theft of intellectual property is different
from the kind of surveillance that Edward Snowden leaked.  To contact the reporters on this story:
