Chase That Golden Thunder has
retrieved his last bat at home plate for Trenton, New Jersey’s
minor-league baseball team.  The Double-A affiliate of the  New York  Yankees said the 13-year-old golden retriever who made his debut with the team in
2002 died yesterday.  “Chase was such a tremendous part of the Trenton Thunder
identity,” General Manager Will Smith said in a statement.
“His presence was the epitome of the wholesome family
entertainment for which we strive.”  Chase’s death came three days after a celebration of his
life in what was a birthday and retirement party.  He leaves behind a legacy of bat-fetching golden
retrievers. Two of his sons, Derby, with the Thunder, and Ollie,
with the New Hampshire Fisher Cats, perform the same duties. The
Fisher Cats are the Double-A affiliate of Major League
Baseball’s Toronto Blue Jays.  Last month, Chase became the first dog honored on the field
at Yankee Stadium after a special invitation by Yankees General
Manager Brian Cashman, the Thunder said in their statement.  The team asked fans wishing to offer condolences to make a
donation in his name to Trenton Thunder Charities or a local
animal shelter or pet rescue.  To contact the reporters on this story:
