Australia  hired Ewen McKenzie as
national rugby coach after  Robbie Deans  quit following
the Wallabies’ series loss to the British and Irish Lions,
Australian Rugby Union Chief Executive Officer Bill Pulver said
today in a televised news conference in Brisbane.  Deans, a New Zealander who took over as Australia’s first
non-native coach in 2008, advised Pulver of his resignation late
yesterday, the ARU said in a statement earlier today. His
contract was due to expire at the end of this year.  Australia lost 41-16 to the Lions three days ago in their
series-deciding match.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
