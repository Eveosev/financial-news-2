President  Barack Obama  is nominating
campaign supporters to be the next U.S. ambassadors to the U.K.
and Italy, two sought-after posts, the White House said today.  Matthew Barzun, finance chairman of the president’s 2012
re-election campaign, is Obama’s choice as ambassador to  Great
Britain  and Northern Ireland, according to a White House
statement.  John R. Phillips, a Washington lawyer who’s married to
former Obama spokeswoman and strategist Linda Douglass, is being
nominated as ambassador to the Italian Republic and the Republic
of  San Marino .  Barzun is a former adviser to and investor in Internet
startups and previously served as U.S. ambassador to Sweden.
Phillips founded a Washington law firm and was founder of the
Center for Law in the Public Interest in Los Angeles.  The announcements came a day after Obama said he will
nominate his deputy chief of staff Mark Childress as ambassador
to Tanzania.  The nominations require Senate confirmation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
