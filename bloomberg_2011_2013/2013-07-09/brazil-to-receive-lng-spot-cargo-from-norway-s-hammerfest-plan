Petroleo Brasileiro SA,  Brazil ’s
importer of liquefied natural gas, is preparing to receive a
spot cargo from  Norway , ship-tracking data show.  The Excalibur, with a capacity of about 138,000 cubic
meters, is on its way to Pecem port in northeastern Brazil,
according to transmissions captured by IHS Fairplay on
Bloomberg. It was scheduled to arrive yesterday.  The tanker loaded the supercooled natural gas at  Statoil
ASA (STL) ’s Hammerfest LNG terminal in northern Norway and departed
June 17, according to the data.  Brazil doesn’t have long-term LNG supply contracts with
Norway, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Petroleo
Brasileiro, known as Petrobras, has a floating regasification
terminal at Pecem.  Rio de Janeiro-based Petrobras will import as many as 60
cargoes this year, up from 56 in 2012, Hugo Repsold, an
executive manager, said June 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
