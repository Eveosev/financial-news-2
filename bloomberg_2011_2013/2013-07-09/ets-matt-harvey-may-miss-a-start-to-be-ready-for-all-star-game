New York Mets pitcher Matt Harvey may
skip his next scheduled start on July 13 to be ready for his
first Major League Baseball All-Star Game three days later at
his home field.  Mets manager Terry Collins said yesterday that he may sit
the 24-year-old right-hander or put him on an abbreviated pitch
limit for his next start against the Pittsburgh Pirates.  The rest would benefit the pitcher as he prepares to play
in the All-Star Game on July 16 in front of home fans at Citi
Field in New York, Collins said at a news conference yesterday
at AT&T Park after the Mets beat the San Francisco Giants 4-3 in
16 innings.  Harvey also has a blister on his right index finger that he
said is affecting the feel of pitches. Collins said yesterday
that the blister isn’t a factor in determining how much Harvey
pitches in his next start, if he throws at all.  Voted to the All-Star Game in his first full major-league
season, Harvey is a candidate to start for the National League,
according to Bruce Bochy, the Giants’ manager who will lead the
NL squad. Collins will serve as a coach under Bochy.  Harvey is 7-2 this year with a 2.35 earned-run average, the
third lowest in baseball. His 147 strikeouts rank second behind
Texas Rangers starter Yu Darvish, who has 157.  In his three starts since developing the blister, Harvey is
0-1 with a 4.05 ERA. He threw 121 pitches last night against the
Giants, the fourth time in five starts that he topped the 100-pitch mark.  To contact the reporters on this story:
