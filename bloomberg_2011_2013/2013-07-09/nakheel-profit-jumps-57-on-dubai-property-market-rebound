Nakheel PJSC, the builder of
artificial islands off Dubai’s coast, said first-half profit
climbed 57 percent as the sheikhdom’s improving real estate
market fueled demand for the company’s properties.  Net income rose to 1.2 billion dirhams ($327 million) from
767 million dirhams a year earlier, Nakheel said in a statement
today. Revenue gained 36 percent to 4.23 billion dirhams.  The state-run company that was bailed out by Dubai’s
government in 2009 said it’s completing more residential and
retail projects as the  property market  recovers from a crash
that saw prices fall more than 65 percent. The company will be
able to pay or refinance as much as half of its $3 billion of
debt coming due in 2016 as it generates at least $1 billion from
new projects and land sales, JPMorgan Chase & Co. said in a July
4 research note.  Nakheel is “evaluating a number of additional projects
that will add value to its existing communities and result in a
more sustainable and long-term viable business post
restructuring,” the company said in the statement.  In the first half, Nakheel handed over about 1,400
properties, mostly in residential projects such as Palm Jumeirah
and  Al Furjan , to customers. The company said it estimates it
will deliver about 3,000 properties in all of 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
