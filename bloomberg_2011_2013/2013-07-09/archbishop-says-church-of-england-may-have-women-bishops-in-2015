The Church of  England  may have female
bishops within two years, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said after its governing body voted to restart work on
plans rejected last year.  “We’re at the very early stage, but there are good signs
at the moment,” Welby told BBC Radio 4 today. “Those who hold
a range of different opinions will still be able to flourish.”  Welby said approval may happen “sometime roundabout
2015,” adding “we’re trying to push it ahead as quickly as
possible but bringing everyone with us.”  The General Synod, the church’s governing body, voted
yesterday to move forward on a new draft law. In November, the
synod failed to reach a two-thirds majority in all three of its
houses to approve the consecration of women as bishops, 20 years
after they were allowed to become priests.  Welby said the new plan “goes about it a different way”
and would satisfy opponents of women bishops that their views
would be respected.  To contact the reporter on this story:
