Czech June inflation accelerated more
than the central bank forecast, boosted mainly by the cost of
food, as policy makers debate whether interventions to weaken
koruna are needed to maintain  price stability .  The  inflation  rate rose to 1.6 percent, from 1.3 percent in
May, the Prague-based Statistics Office said in a statement
today. The median forecast in a Bloomberg  survey  of 13 analysts
was 1.3 percent, while the central bank projected inflation at
1.4 percent in June. Consumer prices rose 0.4 percent from the
 previous month , the statistics office said.  The Ceska Narodni Banka in  Prague  is weighing inflation
trends as it debates whether the first currency interventions in
more than a decade are needed to fulfill its mandate of price
stability. Policy makers are in uncharted territory after
reducing rates three times last year to  effectively zero  in
reaction to a recession.  After cutting the benchmark  interest rate  to 0.05 percent
last year exhausted the scope for reducing borrowing costs, the
koruna assumed the central role in policy plans as its
depreciation helps boost competitiveness of exports and makes
imports more expensive, limiting deflation risks.  Central bank board members were split on the need for
immediate currency interventions at June 27 policy meeting, with
several of them calling for the start of koruna sales, according
to minutes from the meeting published yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
