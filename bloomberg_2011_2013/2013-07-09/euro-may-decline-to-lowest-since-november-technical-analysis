The euro may fall to its lowest
against the dollar since November if it breaks key technical
levels, according to Credit Suisse Group AG.  The 17-nation currency, which has fallen 1.5 percent versus
the greenback over the past week, is testing support in the
$1.2796-to-$1.2806 range, according to  David Sneddon , global
head of technical analysis at Credit Suisse in  London . If the
euro declines below that area, it will test medium-term support
at $1.2662, the November 2012 low and the 61.8 percent Fibonacci
retracement of its 2012-2013 rise, he said.  “Our bias is to sell euro-dollar on strength and for a
clear break below the $1.2796 support level,” Sneddon said in a
telephone interview. “The euro-dollar is suffering as a result
of a bullish dollar view, rather than a specifically weak euro
view.”  Europe ’s shared currency dropped 0.7 percent to $1.2786 at
11 a.m. in  New York  after rising 0.2 percent earlier. The euro
touched $1.2777, the lowest since April 4.  A break above the resistance level at $1.2910 may see a
rise to $1.2933, and then to the area from $1.3030 to $1.3040,
where it traded last week, Sneddon said. Credit Suisse has a
year-end forecast of $1.38, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “You need to get past that $1.3030-to-$1.3040 area, which
is a tough ask now,” Sneddon said.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index. Support refers to an
area on a chart where buy orders may be clustered. Resistance is
an area where there may be sell orders.  Fibonacci retracement is named after a 12th century Italian
mathematician and based on the theory that prices rise or fall
by predictable amounts after reaching a high or low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
