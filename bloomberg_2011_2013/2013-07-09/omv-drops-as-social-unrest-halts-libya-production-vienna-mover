OMV (OMV) , central  Europe ’s biggest oil
company, fell the most in two weeks after it said production in
 Libya  has been halted because of civil unrest.  The  shares  fell as much as 4.2 percent and traded 1.34
euros lower, at 34.33 euros a share, at 3:44 p.m. local time in
Vienna. It was the biggest intraday drop since June 24.  “Due to the current political situation in Libya, most of
OMV’s production in the country has been shut-in since June
25,” the company said in an e-mailed statement today. Libya
supplied about 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day in 2012,
equivalent to about a 10th of total production, OMV said.  Oil production in the North African country dropped 16
percent last month to the lowest level since January, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The decline is partly due to
power shortages, which, as of late, add to civil protests and
violent attacks the industry is facing since the overthrow of
Muammar Qaddafi in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
