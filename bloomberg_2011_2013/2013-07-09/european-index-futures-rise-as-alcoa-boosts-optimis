European stocks  rose to the highest
level in almost a month as Alcoa Inc. started the U.S. earnings-reporting season with results that beat analysts’ estimates.  Mining companies led gains after Alcoa said  China  will lead
an increase in global aluminum demand. Electricite de  France  SA
jumped the most since October 2008 after a report that the
utility will increase its tariff. LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis
Vuitton SA added 2.1 percent after it agreed to acquire 80
percent of Italian clothier Loro Piana SpA.  The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index gained 0.8 percent to 294.58,
its highest level since June 10. The equity benchmark has
rallied 6.9 percent since its 2013 low on June 24 as the
 European Central Bank  and the  Bank of England  pledged to keep
 interest rates  low for the foreseeable future.  “Earnings will increasingly come into focus this week,”
Witold Bahrke, who helps oversee $55 billion as a senior
strategist at PFA Pension A/S in Copenhagen, wrote in a message.
“But it’s still very much about monetary policy shaping
markets. There seems to be an element of realizing that Fed
tapering is not a disaster for equities as opposed to bonds, at
least in the long run, because it’s ultimately a sign of a more
resilient economy.”  Alcoa Results  Alcoa, the first member of the  Dow Jones Industrial Average 
to report quarterly results, said profit excluding some expenses
was 7 cents a share. That beat the 6-cent average of 15
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales fell to $5.85 billion,
still surpassing the $5.79 billion average projection.  National benchmark indexes advanced in 12 of the 18
western-European markets today. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 added 1
percent,  Germany ’s DAX climbed 1.1 percent, and France’s CAC 40
gained 0.5 percent.  A gauge of mining companies rose 2.4 percent, for the best
performance among the  19 industry groups  on the Stoxx 600.
Global aluminum demand will increase 7 percent this year, led by
an 11 percent growth in China, Alcoa said.  BHP Billiton Ltd. and Rio Tinto Group climbed 2.4 percent
to 1,729.5 pence and 2.5 percent to 2,736.5 pence, respectively.
Polymetal International Plc, which operates gold and silver
mines in  Russia  and a gold-and-copper mine in  Kazakhstan ,
advanced 6.7 percent to 506 pence. Anglo American Plc gained 3
percent to 1,282 pence.  EDF rallied 9.3 percent to 19.40 euros. France has
authorized the utility to raise its power prices for households
by 5 percent next month and by another 5 percent in August 2014,
 Le Parisien  reported. The newspaper cited a statement from
Ecology and Energy Minister Philippe Martin. Separately, UBS AG
upgraded the stock to neutral.  LVMH Acquisition  LVMH advanced 2.1 percent to 131.40 euros. The company
agreed to pay 2 billion euros ($2.55 billion) for 80 percent of
Loro Piana. The family owners of the maker of $1,385 cashmere
sweaters will retain a 20 percent stake in the business, Paris-based LVMH said.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  rose 5.4 percent to 304.4
pence, for its first back-to-back gains in almost a month.
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised its rating on the state-owned
lender to buy from neutral, saying a split of RBS would allow
the bank to focus on profitable operations while accelerating a
 privatization  of the bank.  Hikma Pharmaceuticals Plc rose 2.2 percent to 1,073 pence.
UBS upgraded its recommendation for the stock to neutral from
sell. The drugmaker jumped 5.6 percent yesterday to its highest
price since its initial public offering in 2005 after raising
its estimate for revenue growth this year to 17 percent, from a
previous forecast of 13 percent.  Siemens Unit  Osram Licht AG, the lighting company spun off by Siemens

its biggest gain since November 2011. The U.K. fund manager
forecast underlying profit of about 100 million pounds ($148
million) for the first half of the year.  Aveva Group Plc gained 14 percent to 2,578 pence, its
highest price since it sold shares to the public in 1996. The
computer software maker said it has seen a “good start” to the
financial year, with demand growth steady in Europe,  Africa  and
 Asia  and activity picking up in  North America .  “There are early signs that business activity is beginning
to pick up in  Brazil , where we have won strategically important
offshore and onshore contracts during the first quarter of the
financial year,” Aveva said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
