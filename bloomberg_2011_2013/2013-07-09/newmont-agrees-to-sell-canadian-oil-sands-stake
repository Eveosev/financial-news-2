Newmont Mining Corp., the biggest
U.S. gold producer, has agreed to sell its stake in  Canadian Oil
Sands Ltd. (COS)  for about C$608 million ($578 million.)  Newmont owns about 6.5 percent of Calgary-based Canadian
Oil Sands and will sell its stake to a banking syndicate that
will then offer the shares to various buyers,  Omar Jabara , a
spokesman for Greenwood Village, Colorado-based Newmont, said in
an e-mail today.  “Our investment in Canadian Oil Sands has returned a lot
of value for Newmont and its shareholders and this stake sale
also will help streamline and rationalize our portfolio of
assets,” he said.  Newmont is among gold companies that spent $195 billion on
acquisitions in a decade-long bull market, which are now selling
assets as the precious metal’s price tumbles. Whitecap Resources
Inc., a Canadian oil and natural gas producer, said on June 27
it agreed to buy energy assets from  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the
world’s biggest gold producer.  Gold declined 26 percent in 2013, sliding into a bear
market in April while equities and the dollar rose. Gold rallied
for 12 years through 2012 as the U.S. Federal Reserve cut
borrowing costs to a record to bolster the economy.  To contact the reporters on this story:
