Austrian Finance Minister Maria Fekter comments on  Portugal ’s new government, Slovenia and the
disbursement of the next international aid installment to
Greece.  She spoke to reporters before a meeting of European Union
finance ministers in Brussels today.  On Portugal:  “Portugal is doing very well in its program.”  “The economy is likely to grow in the next six months,
earlier than expected. We hope that unemployment will also
improve because of that.”  “At the moment, Portugal doesn’t have so much a problem
with the program and the stabilization of the country, but with
political tensions.”  “I am confident that this will be solved.”  “I’m confident that no major irritations will happen
there.”  On Slovenia:  “Slovenia needs to restructure the banking sector. But
we’re very cautious and careful that nothing happens that would
lead to a rising deficit or even more debt in Slovenia.”  On  Greece :  “We have pointed out to the Greeks that they must comply
with the requirements, that they have to make an effort to
implement the reforms by the end of July that have been delayed.
However, we will check the details and although we have released
the money, we didn’t do it all at once, but in tranches, in
order to have control.”  On the euro region economy:  “Youth unemployment and unemployment, not the banks, are
the biggest concerns in  Europe , when young people have no work
and a whole generation is left behind, that’s not acceptable.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
