The Irish government should stick to
its plan for 3 billion euros ($3.8 billion) of savings in its
budget for next year as the risks from easing up on austerity
soon are too high, according to the Economic & Social Research
Institute.  “The price of easing off too early if you get it wrong is
very high,” said John FitzGerald, a research professor at the
Dublin-based think tank, at a briefing for reporters on the
publication of its report on the Irish economy to 2020. The
disadvantage from being “tough” next year is “relatively
small,” he said.  The ESRI today outlined three potential scenarios for the
Irish economy to 2020: a recovery scenario, delayed adjustment
scenario and a stagnation scenario. In the recovery scenario
based on a return to growth in the European Union, the ESRI sees
no more government expenditure cuts from 2015.  By contrast, in the stagnation scenario where the EU
experiences little or no growth to 2020, Ireland would need to
continue with “tough budgets to 2020” even as the nation’s
debt level remained high and the economy vulnerable to shocks.  FitzGerald said the ESRI was uncertain which scenario was
most probable.  To contact the reporter on this story:
