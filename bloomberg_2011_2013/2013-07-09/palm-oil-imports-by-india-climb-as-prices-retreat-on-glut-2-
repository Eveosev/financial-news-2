Palm oil  imports by  India , the
world’s largest buyer, probably increased for a second month in
June as a decline in prices amid increasing global cooking oil
supplies spurred demand from processors and traders. Futures in
 Kuala Lumpur  climbed to a two-week high.  Inbound  shipments  increased 34 percent to 680,000 metric
tons last month from 505,738 tons a year earlier, according to
the median of estimates from five processors and brokers
compiled by Bloomberg. Imports rose 10 percent in May after
declining 4.8 percent in April. The  Solvent Extractors’
Association of India  will release the data next week. Total
 vegetable oil  imports, including for industrial use, gained 15
percent to 900,000 tons from 783,315, the survey showed.  Increasing demand from India may help limit losses in palm
oil futures in Kuala Lumpur, which have dropped for five
straight quarters. Stockpiles of the most-used cooking oil are
poised to jump 21 percent to a record 9.5 million tons in
2013-2014, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show. The glut
may widen as U.S. soybean growers are poised to reap their
biggest-ever crop when the harvest starts in September.  “Palm oil imports are rising as it is definitely cheaper
and that is why you are seeing so much of olein coming in,”
said  Atul Chaturvedi , chief executive officer of Adani Wilmar
Ltd., referring to an increase in shipments of refined, bleached
and deodorized palm olein.  Narrowing Premium  Palm oil’s  discount  to  soybean oil  was at $268.21 a ton
today after dropping to $253.44 a ton on June 27, the smallest
since August, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Imports
of RBD palm olein more than doubled to 373,837 tons in May, the
highest ever, extractors’ association data show.  India, the biggest cooking oil consumer after  China , meets
more than half of its demand through imports. It buys palm oil
from Indonesia and Malaysia and soyoil from the U.S.,  Brazil  and
 Argentina . Vegetable oil purchases in the seven months to May
rose 10 percent to 6.2 million tons, association data showed.  Inventories, including those at ports and in the pipeline,
probably tumbled to 1.55 million tons at the start of July from
1.98 million tons in June, said Sandeep Bajoria, chief executive
officer of Mumbai-based broker Sunvin Group.  Palm oil for delivery in September advanced 0.9 percent to
2,397 ringgit ($751) a ton on the  Malaysia  Derivatives Exchange,
the highest price at close for the most-active contract since
June 25. Prices fell 2.2 percent in June.  Stockpile Selling  “Imports could slow in July as many farmers are selling
their stockpiles now because planting has been very good this
year and they are expecting a better crop,” Ashok Sethia,
executive director of Sethia Oils Ltd., said by phone from
Kolkata. “Crushing will pick up.”  Planting of soybeans, the main crop sown in the monsoon,
climbed to 8.3 million hectares (20.5 million acres) as of July
5 from 1.9 million hectares during the same period a year
earlier, the  Agriculture Ministry  said. The total area under
oilseeds was 11 million hectares compared with 2.6 million
hectares in 2012, it said.  The slump in the rupee to a record low against the  U.S.
dollar  was unlikely to hurt imports because of sustained demand,
said Govindlal G. Patel, managing partner at GG Patel & Nikhil
Research Co. Cooking oil demand may surge to 23 million tons by
2020 from 17.5 million tons now, and imports will rise
significantly to meet this demand, according to India’s Food
Ministry.  The rupee fell 4.9 percent in June and reached a record low
of 61.2125 yesterday as global funds cut holdings of Indian debt
and equities.  Crude  soybean oil imports  probably declined to 135,000 tons
in June from 139,794 tons a year earlier, while  sunflower oil
purchases  may have risen 20 percent to 105,000 tons, the survey
showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
