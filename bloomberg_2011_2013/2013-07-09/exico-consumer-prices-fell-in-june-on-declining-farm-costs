Mexico ’s  consumer prices  fell in
June, supporting the central bank’s view that inflation will
revert towards its target in the second half of the year.  Prices slid 0.06 percent from May, the national statistics
agency said today on its website, compared with median forecast
of 22 economists surveyed by Bloomberg for a decline of 0.02
percent. Farm prices tumbled 3 percent. Annual  inflation  slowed
to 4.09 percent from 4.63 percent in May, heading toward the
central bank’s 2 percent to 4 percent target range. Core prices,
which exclude energy and farm costs, rose 0.13 percent in the
month, compared with the median forecast of 0.17 percent.  Threats to growth in  Latin America ’s second-largest economy
have “intensified” and inflation will slow toward the 3
percent target, central bank board members said in minutes of
their June 7 meeting. They left the key rate unchanged at a
record-low 4 percent after cutting it in March for the first
time since 2009. Economists expect the next rate move to be a
quarter-point increase in November 2014, according to the median
estimate in a July 5 survey by Citigroup Inc.’s Banamex unit.  A plunge in the peso in May on speculation the U.S. Federal
Reserve will scale back asset purchases eliminated the
possibility of a second rate cut this year and strengthened the
odds for an increase. In a June 5 poll, economists had forecast
a half-point cut in September.  The peso rose 0.4 percent to 12.8283 per dollar at 8:02
a.m. in Mexico City and has retreated 6.5 percent in the past
two months from an almost two-year high in May. The U.S. Fed
said in May that it may pare back monetary stimulus, damping
demand for emerging market assets.  The central bank will leave rates unchanged in its next
decision on July 12, according to the median estimate of all 23
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The July 5 survey also showed that economists cut their
median forecast for year-end inflation to 3.79 percent from 3.9
percent in the prior poll and left their annual growth
projection at 2.7 percent, down from 3 percent on June 5 and
less than the government’s 3.1 percent forecast. The government
cut its own prediction in May from 3.5 percent after expansion
slowed more than expected to 0.8 percent in the first quarter,
the least since the end of the 2009 recession.  To contact the reporter on this story:
