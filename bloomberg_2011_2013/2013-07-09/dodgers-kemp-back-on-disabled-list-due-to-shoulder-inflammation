The Los Angeles Dodgers placed
outfielder Matt Kemp back on the disabled list because of
inflammation in his left shoulder.  Kemp, 28, missed 24 games from May 30 to June 24 due to a
strained right hamstring. In 61 games this season, he’s
hitting .254 with four home runs and 24 runs batted in.  Kemp’s latest injury is to the same shoulder on which he
had surgery last October to repair a torn labrum. The two-time
All-Star has missed 81 games because of injuries since signing a
franchise-record eight-year, $160 million contract following the
2011 Major League Baseball season, when he was the runner-up for
the National League’s Most Valuable Player award.  The Dodgers also placed pitcher Stephen Fife on the 15-day
disabled list due to a recurrence of the shoulder bursitis that
sidelined him in May. He has a 3-3 record with a 2.76 earned run
average in eight starts this season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
