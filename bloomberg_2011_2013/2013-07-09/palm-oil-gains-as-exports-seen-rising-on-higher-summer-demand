Palm oil  gained on speculation that
exports from Malaysia, the second-largest producer, may increase
after climbing for the first time in three months in June.  The contract for September delivery advanced as much as 0.5
percent to 2,387 ringgit ($748) a metric ton on the Bursa
Malaysia Derivatives, and ended the morning session at 2,379
ringgit. Palm for local physical delivery in July was at 2,385
ringgit yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “It’s still summer in the northern hemisphere, so demand
should stay strong,” said Alan Lim Seong Chun, an analyst at
Kenanga Investment Bank Bhd. “Although production may increase
slightly, the increase in demand should be able to absorb the
higher production in July.” The tropical oil, used in
everything from noodles to soaps, clouds in colder temperatures.  Exports gained 4.1 percent to 1.47 million tons in June
from a month earlier, a Bloomberg survey published last week
showed. Output rose 6.2 percent to 1.47 million tons and
 reserves  fell 3.7 percent to 1.75 million tons, the least since
June 2012, according to the survey. Official data by the
Malaysian Palm Oil Board are scheduled for release tomorrow.  Soybean oil  for delivery in December was little changed at
45.88 cents on the Chicago Board of Trade, while soybeans for
delivery in November advanced 0.9 percent to $12.635 a bushel.  Refined palm oil for January delivery gained 0.3 percent to
5,868  yuan  ($957) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange , while
soybean oil for delivery in the same month climbed 0.6 percent
to 7,278 yuan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
