India will inject as much as 140
billion rupees ($2.3 billion) into state-run banks by the end of
September to strengthen their risk buffers and bolster credit
growth as the economy slows. Shares of banks rallied.  IDBI Bank Ltd. (IDBI) ,  Bank of Maharastra , Dena Bank and  Indian
Overseas Bank (IOB)  are among the government-controlled lenders that
will be provided with equity capital to bring their ratios above
8 percent, Rajiv Takru, banking secretary at the  Finance
Ministry , said in an interview today. The structure of the
transactions isn’t set yet, he said, declining to say how much
each bank will receive.  The fresh capital will increase the ability to withstand
risk at state-run banks, which account for three-fourths of
India’s lending, according to data compiled by the central bank.
That may boost credit growth, helping revive an economy that
grew at the slowest pace in a decade in the year to March 31.  “The government, as the largest shareholder, will step in
to boost  capital ratios  whenever required,” Takru, 57, said at
his office in New Delhi. “We don’t want Tier-1 capital at any
state-run bank to stay below 8 percent.”  IDBI  gained  3.8 percent to 73.4 rupees by 2:50 p.m. in
Mumbai,  Dena Bank (DBNK)   jumped  4.4 percent to 70.4 rupees, Indian
Overseas Bank advanced 3.2 percent to 49.85 rupees, while  Bank
of Maharashtra (BOMH)  gained 1 percent to 50.85 rupees.  The government will need to infuse as much as 910 billion
rupees into its majority-owned banks to comply with
international standards known as Basel III rules, if it wants to
maintain its stakes,  Reserve Bank  of India Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said last year. The banks will also need to sell 590
billion rupees of shares to other investors,  he estimated .  Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram announced in
Feburary a plan to boost state-owned banks’ capital by 140
billion rupees by March 2014.  Lending by banks in India grew at 13.7 percent, the lowest
rate in at least three years, in the twelve months to June 14,
data compiled by the RBI show, as slowing economic growth
curtailed demand for credit.  To contact the reporters on this story:
