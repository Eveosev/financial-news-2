The  New York Knicks  signed former
University of Michigan guard Tim Hardaway Jr., their first-round
pick in this year’s National Basketball Association draft.  Hardaway, the son of five-time NBA All-Star Tim Hardaway,
averaged 14.5 points, 4.7 rebounds and 2.4 assists as a junior
last season to help Michigan reach the championship game of the
National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament.  Hardaway agreed to a four-year contract worth $6.1 million,
ESPN New York reported, citing agent Mark Bartelstein. The
Knicks also signed free agent forward C.J. Leslie, who wasn’t
drafted after averaging 15.1 points and 7.4 rebounds as a junior
at North Carolina State last season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
