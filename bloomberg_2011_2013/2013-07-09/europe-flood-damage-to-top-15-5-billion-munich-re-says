Flooding in Europe last month will
cause more than 12 billion euros ($15.5 billion) of damage, the
year’s most expensive natural catastrophe, according to  Munich
Re , the world’s biggest reinsurer.  Insured losses will probably be at least 3 billion euros,
the majority of which are in  Germany , the Munich-based company
said in an e-mailed statement today. The damage costs will
approach the $16.5 billion of losses from the Elbe river floods
of 2002, of which $3.4 billion were insured, Munich Re said.  Germany and Austria were among the nations stricken after
unseasonably heavy rainfall caused the Vltava, Danube and Elbe
rivers and their tributaries to burst dams and breach their
banks. Insurers are counting losses after the waters retreated,
with  Swiss Re (SREN)  Ltd., the second-biggest reinsurer, saying
yesterday that it expects about  $300 million  of claims.  “The frequency of flood events in Germany and central
Europe has increased by a factor of two since 1980,”  Torsten Jeworrek , a management board member at Munich Re, said in the
statement. “Such a rise in losses can be prevented by better
flood control.”  Munich Re didn’t say what claims the company faces. About
45 percent of the total $13 billion in insured losses in the
first half were caused by inland flooding, the company said.  The natural disaster with the most severe humanitarian
consequences this year was flash flooding in northern  India  and
Nepal that killed more than 1,000 people, according to the
German reinsurer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
