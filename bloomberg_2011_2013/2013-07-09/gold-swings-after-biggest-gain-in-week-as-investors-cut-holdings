Gold futures climbed for the second
straight day as accelerating inflation in  China  boosted the
appeal of the metal as a hedge, while demand increased for
jewelry, coins and bars.  China’s  consumer -price index rose 2.7 percent from a year
earlier, government data showed today. That compared with a
median estimate of 2.5 percent in a Bloomberg survey. Demand in
 Asia  for gold has been underpinned by reports of purchases in
China, Standard Bank Plc said in a report.  “Prices got a boost on news that China’s inflation rate
heated up a bit,” Peter Hug, the global trading director of
Kitco Metals Inc., said in a report. “We are seeing some
continued physical demand from the  Far East .”  Gold futures for August delivery advanced 0.9 percent to
settle at $1,245.90 at 1:46 p.m. on the Comex in  New York . The
metal gained 1.8 percent yesterday.  The one-month lease rate for gold rose to 0.2988 percent,
the highest since December 2008, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The rate is derived by subtracting the gold forward
offered rate from the London Interbank Offered Rate. The higher
cost may indicate a scarcity of metal, according to the London
Bullion Market Association.  Gold has slumped 26 percent this year, wiping out $61.9
billion from the value of  exchange-traded products  backed by the
metal. Some investors lost faith in the commodity as a store of
value amid a rally in equities and low U.S. inflation.  Silver futures for September delivery climbed 0.5 percent
to $19.138 an ounce on the Comex. Yesterday, the price increased
1.6 percent.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery advanced 0.5 percent to $1,368.60 an ounce.  Palladium futures for September delivery gained 0.3 percent
to $697.35 an ounce. Earlier, the price reached $705, the
highest since June 19.  To contact the reporters on this story:
