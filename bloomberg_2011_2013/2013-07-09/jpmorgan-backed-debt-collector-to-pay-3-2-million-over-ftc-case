A debt-collection firm backed by
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s private equity unit agreed to pay $3.2
million to settle a Federal Trade Commission complaint that it
illegally harassed consumers.  The fine, the largest levied by the FTC against a third-party debt collector according to an agency  news release  today,
stems from charges that it used tactics including calling
consumers multiple times a day, calling them early in the
morning or late at night, and calling at consumers’ workplaces.
The company, Expert Global Solutions Inc., was also accused by
the FTC of continuing to call consumers who denied owing a debt
to its clients.  Under the settlement, if a consumer disputes the validity
of the debt, the company must either end collection efforts or
suspend them until they’ve conducted a “reasonable
investigation” to establish the debt’s validity. The agreement
also prohibits the company from treating consumers in the manner
outlined in the FTC’s charges, according to the agency’s
statement.  Tom Hoy, a spokesman for the Expert Global, did not
immediately respond to a request for comment. The FTC news
release describes the company as “the world’s largest debt
collection operation.”  JPMorgan’s stake in the firm  is held by its private
investment arm, One Equity Partners. According to the JPMorgan
investment unit’s website, Expert Global is based in Horsham,
 Pennsylvania , and has revenues of about $2 billion dollars, and
40,000 employees in 14 countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
