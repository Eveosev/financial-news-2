Fred Shero, who coached the
 Philadelphia Flyers  to consecutive Stanley Cup titles and led
the  New York  Rangers to the finals in 1979, was among five
people selected yesterday for the Hockey Hall of Fame.  National Hockey League defensemen Chris Chelios and Scott Niedermayer and right wing Brendan Shanahan also will be
inducted, along with Geraldine Heaney, a defenseman who won
seven world championship gold medals and one Olympic title with
the Canadian women’s national team.  Shero guided the Flyers during their Broad Street Bullies
era, with a roster that included captain Bobby Clarke and
players such as Dave “the Hammer” Schultz and Andre “Moose”
Dupont. The team, which won Stanley Cup titles in 1974 and 1975,
was known for intimidating opponents while defeating them.  The first coach to hire a full-time assistant, Shero also
was credited with creating a team system in which each player
had a specific role on the ice. He studied game films, traveled
to the  Soviet Union  in the 1970s and adopted aspects of that
country’s free-flowing offensive style into his coaching.  Shero, who played for the  New York Rangers  in 1947-50 and
coached them in 1978-81, died in 1990 of stomach cancer at the
age of 65.  Shero had 390 wins as a coach -- 308 with the Flyers and 82
with the Rangers. He will be inducted in the Builders Category.  Chelios, a U.S.-born defenseman who played 26 seasons in
the NHL, won the Norris Trophy as the league’s top defenseman
three times. Before retiring after the 2009-10 season at age 48,
he won Stanley Cups with the  Montreal Canadiens  in 1986 and the
 Detroit Red Wings  in 2002 and 2008.  Niedermayer’s Resume  Niedermayer was selected in his first year on the ballot.
The 2004 Norris Trophy winner was a four-time Stanley Cup
winner, and won two Olympic gold medals, a world championship
and a world junior championship for  Canada , as well as the
Memorial Cup, Canada’s top junior league title. He spent 18
seasons in the NHL with the New Jersey New Devils and the
Anaheim Ducks.  Shanahan, an eight-time NHL All-Star, ranks 13th in league
history with 656 goals over a 21-year career. He retired in 2009
after winning Stanley Cup titles with the  Red Wings  in 1997,
1998 and 2002.  Former coach Pat Burns, who died of cancer in 2003 at age
58, wasn’t selected. Players who failed to gain induction in
their first year on the ballot included Rob Blake, Mathieu Schneider, Sergei Zubov, Rod Brind’Amour, Paul Kariya and Markus Naslund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
