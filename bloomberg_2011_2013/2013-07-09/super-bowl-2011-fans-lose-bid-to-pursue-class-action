Football fans who sued over
obstructed views and other complaints with their seats at the
2011 Super Bowl game near Dallas lost a bid to pursue their case
as a group.  U.S. District Judge Barbara Lynn in Dallas today denied
class-action status in the case, which was brought against the
 National Football League .  “These issues are individualized,” Lynn wrote in her
ruling.  In previous rulings Lynn threw out all claims against the
 Dallas Cowboys  and owner  Jerry Jones . The judge ruled that the
NFL must defend fraud claims brought by fans whose seats had
obstructed views at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas. She
also ruled that breach of contract claims can go forward against
the NFL over the obstructed seats and other seating problems.  “We are disappointed with the court’s ruling but look
forward to representing hundreds of our clients this year in the
trials against the NFL,” Michael Avenatti of Eagan Avenatti
LLP, lead counsel for the ticketholders, said in an e-mail.
“During those trials we will prove that the NFL defrauded its
fans.”  Joanna Hunter, a spokeswoman for the NFL, said in an e-mail
the league is pleased with the court’s decision..  The case is Simms v. Jones, 3:11-cv-00248, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of Texas (Dallas).  To contact the reporter on this story:
