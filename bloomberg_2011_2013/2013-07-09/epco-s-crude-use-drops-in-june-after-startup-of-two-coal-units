Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501) ,  Japan ’s
biggest power company by generating capacity, used less crude
and fuel oil in June after starting two coal-fired units.  Tepco, as the company is known, consumed 65,000 kiloliters
of crude last month, down 72 percent from a year earlier,
according to  data  released on its website today. Fuel oil
consumption fell 55 percent, while the company’s use of coal
more than tripled, the data shows.  Tepco reduced generation using oil, which is more expensive
than other fuels, as the company’s two coal-fired units started
operations, company spokesman Yusuke Kunikage said by phone
today. The 1,000-megawatt, coal-fired unit at Tepco’s
Hitachinaka station and the 600-megawatt coal unit at the Hirono
plant began test operations in April, Kunikage said.  The following table shows Tepco’s consumption and purchases
of fuel oil, crude, LNG and coal for June. For fuel oil and
crude, the volume is in kiloliters, while LNG and coal are in
metric tons.  To contact the reporters on this story:
