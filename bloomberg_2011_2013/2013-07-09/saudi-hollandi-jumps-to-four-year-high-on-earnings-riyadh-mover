Saudi Hollandi Bank (AAAL)  gained to the
highest level in more than four years after the lender posted
second-quarter earnings that beat estimates, boosted by non-interest income.  The shares advanced 2.6 percent to 35.3 riyals, the highest
since May 2009, at the close in  Riyadh . About 471,000 shares
were traded, more than triple the three-month average, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The benchmark Tadawul All Share
Index climbed 0.2 percent.  Saudi Hollandi’s  quarterly net income  increased 13 percent
from a year earlier to 375 million riyals ($100 million),
beating the 340 million-riyal  average estimate  of seven analysts
compiled by Bloomberg. Commission and investment income advanced
19.8 percent. Loan growth in the kingdom accelerated to almost
17 percent in May, according to central bank data, as lenders
benefit from government plans to invest more than $500 billion
on infrastructure.  “Revenues improved strongly, driven by better net interest
spreads and strong non-interest income, which led to the
earnings beat,” Murad Ansari, an analyst at EFG-Hermes Holding
SAE in  Saudi Arabia , said by e-mail.  Seven analysts  recommend  investors buy the shares of Saudi
Hollandi, while three have a hold rating on the stock, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The stock has soared 30 percent
this year, outperforming the Tadawul’s 13 percent increase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
