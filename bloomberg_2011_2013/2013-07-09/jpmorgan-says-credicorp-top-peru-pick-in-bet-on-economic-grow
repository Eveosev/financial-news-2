Credicorp Ltd. (BAP) , owner of  Peru ’s
largest bank, may gain 32 percent by the end of the year as the
Andean nation’s economy grows, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  JPMorgan included Lima-based Credicorp, owner of Banco de
Credito del Peru, in its list of top picks for the region after
a  27 percent fall  since April 1, saying economic growth will
keep supporting earnings in the country’s banking industry,
according to an e-mailed note to clients dated yesterday.  “We like the long-term secular growth story for financial
services penetration in Peru,”  Saul Martinez , an analyst at
JPMorgan, said in the note. “Credicorp will sustain healthy
profitable levels, on average, in the coming years.”  JPMorgan maintained a year-end 2013 price target of $158
per share for Credicorp, according to the note. The stock rose
50 cents to $120 at 11:03 a.m. today in  Lima .  Credicorp is trading at 11.4 times its  estimated earnings 
for the current year, 15 percent below its average estimated
price-to-earnings ratio of the last four years.  Peru’s gross domestic product will grow 5.75 percent in
2013 and 6 percent in 2014, the fastest of any major Latin
American country after Panama, according to economists’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
