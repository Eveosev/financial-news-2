The Czech energy regulator will bring
charges against two solar producers it says benefited illegally
from subsidies as it carries out a widening probe into the
country’s renewable-energy compensation program.  The regulator found “shortcomings” with 30 of the largest
producers and plans to investigate as many as 180 providers,
Alena Vitaskova, chairwoman of the regulator, told reporters
today in Prague. She didn’t name the companies.  “We’ve found problems with all of the applications,”
Vitaskova said. “The cost of supporting renewable energy is
becoming unsustainable for Czech consumers.”  The Czech government is trying to rein in costs to
consumers of renewable energy after solar companies rushed to
obtain licenses before the end of 2010, when tariffs were
reduced. A law freezing subsidies at 583 koruna a megawatt-hour
from next year is awaiting approval by parliament.  Providers with combined capacity of 190 megawatts who have
received as much as 2.5 billion koruna ($124 million) in
subsidies are being investigated, Vitaskova said.  Milos Cihelka, a spokesman for the Czech Photovoltaic
Industry Association, said by phone that while his organization
welcomes the investigation, it’s hard to comment without more
details of the allegations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
