Former South African President  Nelson Mandela  remains in a critical yet stable condition after a month
in a Pretoria hospital to treat a recurring lung infection,
President  Jacob Zuma  said.  The nation’s first black president, who won a Nobel Peace
Prize in 1993, was hospitalized on June 8. Mandela, who spent 27
years in prison for opposing white-minority rule, turns 95 this
month. He contracted tuberculosis while imprisoned on Robben
Island.  Mandela’s health was downgraded to critical on June 24.
Crowds have posted signs of support, gathered in prayer and sung
outside the hospital to pay tribute to Mandela since last month.
This is his fourth, and longest, stay in the hospital since
December.  “We thank the public for the dignified gatherings outside
the hospital,” Zuma said in a statement posted on his office’s
website. “We thank the international community as well for
ongoing messages of support to Madiba and his family,” he said,
referring to Mandela’s clan name.  To contact the reporter on this story:
