Free-agent center Chris Kaman said
he’s returning to Los Angeles as a member of the Lakers, who are
seeking a replacement for  Dwight Howard .  The 7-foot (2.13-meter) Kaman spent his first eight
National Basketball Association seasons with the Los Angeles
Clippers after being selected with the sixth pick in the 2003
draft. He was with the  New Orleans Hornets  in 2011-12 and played
last season with the Dallas Mavericks, averaging 10.5 points and
5.6 rebounds a game.  “It’s true, I am going to be going back to LA and it’s to
play for the Lakers,” Kaman said last night on his  Twitter page .
“I am excited about this move and can’t wait to play.”  Kaman, 31, has averaged 11.8 points and 8.0 rebounds over
his 10-year NBA career.  Howard, a seven-time All-Star center and three-time NBA
defensive player of the year, announced last week that he’s
joining the  Houston Rockets  after one season with the Lakers.
NBA players can agree on contracts, though they can’t sign until
July 10, when the league’s moratorium on trades and signings is
lifted.  To contact the reporter on this story:
