The two pilots operating Asiana
Flight 214 when it crash-landed in San Francisco on July 6,
killing two, hadn’t flown together before, National
Transportation Safety Board Chairman  Deborah Hersman  said.  The flight was also the first as an instructor for the
pilot in command, Hersman said at a media briefing. Asiana
previously said it was the first time the pilot in control
during the approach had landed at San Francisco International
Airport in a Boeing 777 jet.  To contact the reporter on this story:
