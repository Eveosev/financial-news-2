The  Baltic Exchange , the London-based
shipping bourse, said it’s not holding “active” talks to sell
Baltex, a screen-based system for trading freight derivatives.  “The Baltic has business relationships with a number of
exchanges and clearing houses and therefore is often in dialogue
with them,”  Jeremy Penn , the exchange’s chief executive
officer, said in an e-mailed statement today. “Such dialogue of
course includes matters related to Baltex. This does not mean
that there are active negotiations under way.”  Reuters reported earlier that the exchange received
expressions of interest in Baltex from parties including the
London Metal Exchange and CME Group Inc. The LME is owned by
Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd., and Chicago-based CME Group
owns the world’s largest derivatives market.  Baltex, which handles derivatives tied to the cost of
transporting cargoes including coal, iron ore and grains, lost
682,093 pounds ($1 million) in the year through March, compared
with 704,166 pounds in the previous period, according to the
exchange’s annual report. The bourse doesn’t disclose the amount
of contracts traded using the system, external spokesman Ben
Stack said by phone.  The exchange, which traces its history back to 1744, said
in May 2010 it planned to introduce Baltex by the end of that
year. The first trade on the system was executed in June 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
