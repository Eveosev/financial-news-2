Delaware  will receive $2.8 million in
U.S. Department of Agricultural loans for Kent County to help
remove nutrients from wastewater that’s treated and then
discharged into a Murderkill River tributary, U.S. Senators Tom Carper and Chris Coons and Representative John Carney said.  The USDA Rural Development funds for aeration-system
improvements to the county’s regional wastewater-treatment
facility will reduce nutrient-loading that degrades water
quality and rein in pollution in the Murderkill River watershed,
they said today in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
