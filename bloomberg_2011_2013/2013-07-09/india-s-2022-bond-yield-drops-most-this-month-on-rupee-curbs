The yield on  India ’s government bonds
due 2022 dropped by the most this month as a rebound in the
rupee eased concern inflation will accelerate.  The Indian currency climbed as much as 1.5 percent against
the dollar today, rebounding from a record low of 61.2125
yesterday, after the central bank and the capital-markets
regulator announced steps to curb speculation in the  derivatives
market . A sustained 10 percent drop in the rupee adds 150 basis
points to 200 basis points to India’s  wholesale-price  inflation,
according to a research note released last month by Standard
Chartered Plc.  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 fell six
basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 7.65 percent as of
10:06 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. That is the biggest decrease since June 28. The yield
climbed 18 basis points last month, the most since the
securities were issued in June 2012.  “Everything seems to be moving in tandem with the rupee,”
said Arun Khurana, head of the global markets group at IndusInd
Bank Ltd. in Mumbai. “Still, we expect bond yields to stay
around current levels as the chance of a rate cut has diminished
quite significantly.”  Wholesale prices, more frequently used for policy decisions,
rose 4.7 percent in May from a year earlier, the least since
2009, official data show.  Reserve Bank  of India Governor Duvvuri Subbarao left the repurchase  rate  at 7.25 percent on June 17,
citing inflation risks.  U.S. Stimulus  The rupee weakened 4.9 percent last month, the most since
May 2012, on concern the U.S. Federal Reserve may reduce
monetary stimulus that has driven inflows to  emerging markets .
It fell to a record yesterday as a U.S. jobs report showing
companies hired more workers than economists forecast bolstered
the case for the Fed to pare its asset-buying program.  The  Reserve Bank of India  barred banks from proprietary
trading in currency futures and exchange-traded options,
effective immediately, according to a statement on the central
bank’s website after market hours yesterday. The  Securities and
Exchange Board of India  said in a statement today it will raise
margin requirements and curtail open positions from July 11.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell four basis
points to 7.52 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
