The cost of insuring corporate and

fell, according to credit-default swap traders.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  dropped 5 basis points to 154.5 basis
points as of 8:24 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. prices show. The measure is poised to close
at its lowest level since July 2, according to data provider
CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index decreased 3 basis points
to 131 as of 10:40 a.m. in Sydney, National Australia Bank Ltd.
prices show. The gauge, which has ranged from 96.1 to 149.5 this
year, is on track to reach its lowest close since June 19,
according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index declined 2.5 basis points to
103 basis points as of 9:18 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to
Citigroup Inc. The benchmark is on track for its lowest close
since July 2, CMA data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
