Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
widened as plants increased production rates to take advantage
of higher returns to make the biofuel.  The spread, or price difference, swelled 2.63 cents to 50
cents a gallon. Production rates have jumped 12 percent from a
record low in January, Energy Information Administration data
show. The corn crush spread, or the difference between of
ethanol and the corn needed to make it, was 28 cents a gallon
after being negative much of the year.  Ethanol is “up a little bit, but it’s certainly lost its
luster,” said Jim Damask, a manager at StarFuels Inc. in
Jupiter,  Florida . “It seems like people have a little bit more
to sell. They’re producing it.”  Denatured ethanol for August delivery advanced 1.6 cents,
or 0.7 percent, to $2.426 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of
Trade. Prices have gained 11 percent this year.  Gasoline for August delivery rose 4.23 cents, or 1.5
percent, to $2.926 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be blended
with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol companies battled higher manufacturing costs after
last summer’s U.S. drought reduced corn supply. Stockpiles of
the biofuel have dropped 24 percent to a record low 15.4 million
barrels from a year ago, data from the Energy Department’s
research arm show.  Planting Corn  Farmers responded to the drought by planting the most acres
of corn this year since 1936, according to U.S. Agriculture
Department forecasts. Corn for September delivery climbed 18.5
cents, or 3.5 percent, to $5.5175 a bushel in Chicago. One
bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of the renewable fuel.  “People feel a little more comfortable about the corn
situation,” Damask said.  Ethanol  production  last week averaged 863,000 barrels a
day, about 0.7 percent higher than the same period a year
earlier, EIA data show.  A 2007 energy law requires the U.S. to use 13.8 billion
gallons of the additive this year. Adherence to that law is
tracked by certificates attached to each gallon known as
Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs. Refiners can keep the
credits to show compliance or trade them among each other.  Corn-based RINs fell 1 cent to $1.03, while  advanced RINs 
declined 3 cents to $1.09, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Ethanol prices are above average for this time of year and
traders are awaiting tomorrow’s EIA report to determine whether
the higher prices are attracting Brazilian imports, said Justin
Dirico, manager of the biofuels desk at Eagle Energy Brokers LLC
in  New York .  The U.S. didn’t make any  foreign purchases  of the biofuel
from the week ended June 28, from 38,000 barrels a day the
previous week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
