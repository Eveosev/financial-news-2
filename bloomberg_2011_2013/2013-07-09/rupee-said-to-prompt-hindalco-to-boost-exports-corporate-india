Hindalco Industries Ltd. (HNDL) ,  India ’s
second-largest aluminum producer, is seeking to quadruple
exports of the lightweight metal to exploit the rupee’s plunge
to a record, said two people familiar with the strategy.  Billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla’s company expects to
increase overseas shipments to an unprecedented 130,000 metric
tons in the year through March, the people said, asking not to
be identified as they aren’t authorized to speak on the subject.
Output may rise 34 percent to 725,000 tons in the period after
the Mumbai-based company started a smelter in central India last
quarter, they said.  The rupee’s 9.8 percent slide this fiscal year against the
dollar is prompting Hindalco to accelerate capacity addition
plans and benefit from rising demand for the metal used to make
products from beverage cans to aircraft. Global consumption may
rise 7 percent this year, led by China, according to  Alcoa Inc. (AA) ,
the world’s largest producer, with a $250 a ton spot premium
over three-month London Metal Exchange contracts signaling
demand exceeding supply.  “The rupee’s fall is prompting companies to seek buyers
outside India,” Fitch Ratings Director Devendra Pant said in a
phone interview from New Delhi. “The extent of benefit they can
derive will depend on global demand for that product.”  Hindalco  fell  as much as 1.1 percent to 99.75 rupees and
traded at 99.90 rupees as of 10:45 a.m. in Mumbai. The stock has
declined 23 percent this year, compared with a 0.1 percent gain
in the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex.  Hindalco spokeswoman Pragnya Ram didn’t respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  Profit Outlook  First-quarter  profit may fall  19 percent to 3.46 billion
rupees ($58 million) from a year earlier, according to the
median of eight analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That
would be the lowest in three and a half years. Sales may drop to
the lowest in a year.  Hindalco, which added 359,000 tons of  smelting capacity  at
Mahan in Madhya Pradesh state, is ramping up output, while
scouting for buyers in traditional markets including South Korea
and  Japan , Asia’s biggest aluminum importer. A $250 spot market
premium suggests demand is strong and production will rise this
fiscal year, Managing Director Debnarayan Bhattacharya had said
on May 28, without giving details.  While contract prices of aluminum on the London Metal
Exchange have dropped, the high spot premium indicates physical
demand for the metal is surpassing supplies. That, combined with
the weakening rupee is spurring overseas sales.  Spending Plan  In 2009, Hindalco started a $5.5 billion capital
expenditure plan to double smelting and refining capacities to
1.3 million tons and 3 million tons respectively. Hindalco,
which is also building two power plants of 900 megawatts each in
Madhya Pradesh and Odisha, may start production at a 359,000 ton
plant in Odisha next quarter, Bhattacharya had then said.  Hindalco plans to raise about 50 billion rupees in loans
and bonds to refinance high-cost debt taken to build the 1.5
million ton Odisha refinery.  Group debt rose 37 percent to 563
billion rupees as of March 31, according to Bloomberg
calculations.  Higher Output  The company, which also owns  Novelis Inc. , the world’s
largest supplier of flat-rolled aluminum products to the
automobile industry, increased production of high value products
to 47 percent of total output in the last fiscal year from 43
percent in the year ago period. High-value product volumes will
continue to rise primarily on the back of increased output of
beverage cans, according to Bhattacharya.  Atlanta-based unit Novelis, which spent $775 million last
fiscal year, is increasing its aluminum rolling capacity in
Brazil and South Korea by 572,000 tons and building automotive
finishing lines in  China  and the U.S.  The rupee will drop to 62 a dollar by the end of this year,
according to Nomura Holdings Inc., the most accurate forecaster
for the currency in the last four quarters, based on data
compiled by Bloomberg. Second-ranked JPMorgan Chase & Co. shares
that forecast, while third-ranked Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce predicts 61.50.  New York-based Alcoa on July 8 reported earnings that beat
analysts’ estimates following a better-than-expected performance
at its unit that supplies components to aerospace and power
companies. It’s boosting sales at downstream divisions as
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Klaus Kleinfeld tries to
reduce reliance on aluminum smelting, which has been hurt by
lower metal prices.  Aluminum for delivery in three months, the most active
contract on the London Metal Exchange, has fallen 14 percent
this year. It traded at $1,788.50 a ton as of 10:29 a.m. in
Mumbai. The contract reached a four-year low of $1,765 a ton on
June 27.  “Global demand for aluminum may rise 6 percent this
fiscal year, driven mainly by higher demand for flat-rolled
products from the automotive industry and specialty products,”
said Abhisar Jain, an analyst at Centrum Broking Pvt. in Mumbai.
“The drop in the rupee and almost no possibility of a sharp
gain in local demand will also allow Hindalco to look at exports
market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
