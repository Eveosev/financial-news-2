(Corrects story published July 9 to say in third paragraph
that the fund is Goodman’s largest European real estate
investment vehicle.)  Goodman European Logistics Fund can
invest as much as 800 million euro ($1 billion) in prime assets
after completing a 550 million euro equity raising and a 500
million euro Eurobond sale, according to  Goodman Group. (GMG)   Goodman Group will sell down part of its holding in the
logistics fund to 20 percent in response to total demand of 900
million euro for the equity raising, the Sydney-based company
said in a regulatory filing.  The 1.9 billion euro-fund is the largest of Goodman’s
European real estate investment vehicle with a portfolio of 95
assets in 11 countries, Goodman Group said. The fund was the
third largest of the managed funds in which the group had a
stake as of the end of December.  “We intend to use the proceeds to further strengthen our
market position and the ongoing diversification of our
portfolio, with a focus on prime assets in key European
logistics locations.” Emmanuel Van der Stichele, the fund’s
director, said in the statement.  Shares in Goodman rose 1.4 percent to A$4.895 as of 11:30
a.m. in Sydney, while the S&P/ASX 200 Index climbed 1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
