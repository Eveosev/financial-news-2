President  Barack Obama  plans to
nominate retired Vice Admiral Dennis McGinn as assistant
secretary of the U.S. Navy for energy, installations and
environment.  McGinn is president of the American Council on Renewable
Energy, a Washington-based non-profit that promotes the use of
solar and wind power as well as biofuels. He served in the Navy
for 35 years where he was a test pilot and commanded an aircraft
carrier, the White House said today in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
