Hong Kong  doesn’t plan to withdraw a
funding application for a study to expand the Tuen Mun landfill,
Chief Secretary Carrie Lam told reporters today, according to a
statement on the government’s website.  “We need a way out for the waste produced by seven million
people,” she said, referring to Hong Kong’s population. She
added that the government will work with residents on requests
to improve a road leading to the landfill.  The plans to expand the landfill at Tuen Mun, located in
northwest Hong Kong, have drawn protests from nearby residents.  Hong Kong postponed a program to expand another landfill,
at Tseung Kwan O, to take measures to reduce odor as it is
closer to a residential area, the report cited Lam as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
