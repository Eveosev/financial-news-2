Oracle Corp. (ORCL)  issued $3 billion of
fixed- and floating-rate securities in its first dollar-denominated offering this year.  The company sold 5.5-year debt split between $500 million
of floating-rate bonds that yield 58 basis points more than the
three-month London interbank offered rate and $1.5 billion of
2.375 percent securities at 95 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Oracle, based in  Redwood City ,  California , also sold $1
billion of 3.625 percent, 10-year debt at a relative yield of
110 basis points, Bloomberg data show. The bonds are expected to
be rated A1 by Moodyâ€™s Investors Service, the data show.  The largest maker of  database software  last sold dollar
debt in October, raising $2.5 billion each of 1.2 percent, five-year securities to yield 45 basis points more than benchmarks
and 2.5 percent, 10-year debt at a spread of 68 basis points,
Bloomberg data show.  The bonds due 2022 traded at 92.1 cents on the dollar
yesterday to yield 3.51 percent, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority.  Proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, which
may include stock repurchases, dividend payments and future
acquisitions, the person said. Bank of America Corp., Credit
Suisse Group AG and HSBC Holdings Plc managed the offering,
Bloomberg data show.  Oracle is offering the debt after companies sold $55.5
billion of notes in the U.S. in June, the slowest period in 18
months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Yields on
dollar-denominated bonds rose to 4.25 percent as of yesterday
from an all-time low of 3.35 percent on May 2, according to the
Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate & High Yield index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
