SIG Plc (SHI) , a British distributor of
insulation to builders, said there are signs that the U.K.
construction market is starting to improve after being hampered
by prolonged winter weather at the start of the year.  First-half sales per day in the U.K. and Ireland increased
by 2 percent at constant currency, excluding energy management
operations, the Sheffield, England-based company said in a
statement today. SIG reiterated it will make further progress in
2013. Total revenue was 2.6 billion pounds ($3.9 billion) last
year.  A recovery in the U.K. is a boost for SIG as it grapples
with weakened construction markets in mainland Europe. Shares of
 Bovis Homes Group Plc (BVS)  rose to their highest price in almost six
years yesterday after the homebuilder reported a “significant
improvement” in first-half profit. The Bloomberg EMEA Home
Builders Index has advanced 37 percent this year.  “While SIG’s trading update is slightly behind our
expectations for the first half, driven by mainland  Europe , we
take comfort from the reiteration of guidance for a year of
progress,” Robert Eason, an analyst at Goodbody, said in a note
today.  Shares of SIG traded 1.6 percent lower at 168.6 pence as of
8:20 a.m. local time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
