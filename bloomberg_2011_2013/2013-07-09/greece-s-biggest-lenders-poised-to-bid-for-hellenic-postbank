Eurobank Ergasias SA (EUROB) , Alpha Bank SA,
 National Bank of Greece SA (ETE)  and  Piraeus Bank SA (TPEIR)  said they plan to
place separate bids for state-controlled  Hellenic Postbank SA. (TT)   Offers are due today and a sale must be agreed by July 15,
according to terms agreed with the  International Monetary Fund ,
European Central Bank and the European Commission, spokesmen for
the banks said.  Greece is seeking to sell the nation’s fifth-biggest lender
as part of an overhaul of Greek banking that has focused on
merging lenders and strengthening capital. By combining with
Hellenic Postbank, which received 4 billion euros ($5.2 billion)
in capital after splitting its bad assets, Greek lenders get
access to about 12 billion euros of deposits.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is advising the Hellenic Financial
Stability Fund on the sale.  Eurobank and National Bank of Greece earlier this year
postponed their planned merger after the banks were told to
raise capital separately. In the last year, Alpha bought
Emporiki Bank from  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  and Piraeus bought
Millennium Bank, Geniki Bank SA and Cyprus’s Laiki and Bank of
Cyprus Pcl.  To contact the reporter on this story:
