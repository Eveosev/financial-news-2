WikiLeaks is leaking cash.  Donations to the European anti-secrecy website initially
surged after it offered financial support for Edward Snowden,
the former U.S. National Security Agency contractor who revealed
secrets about American surveillance, the group’s sponsor says.
Contributions since have slid, according to the Hamburg-based
Wau Holland Foundation, main collector of funds for WikiLeaks.  Donations surged to 1,000 euros ($1,285) a day after
Snowden stepped forward as the source of June newspaper reports
about U.S. telephone and Internet surveillance, according to
Bernd Fix, a spokesman for Wau Holland. Daily contributions have
since dropped to about 100 euros ($128.50), or about three times
the rate before Snowden’s emergence, a level that is unlikely to
put WikiLeaks in the black again after two years of deficits,
Fix said in an e-mail.  The group has dramatically cut expenses as contributions
have dropped off, Kristinn Hrafnsson, a spokesman for WikiLeaks,
said by telephone from Reykjavik. He said the organization
should be able to survive at a lower level of activity.  “I’m fairly optimistic we’ll be able to raise enough funds
to continue our work,” he said. “We have adapted to the
situation and will carry on.”  The group, which published diplomatic and military
documents obtained by U.S. Army Pfc. Bradley Manning in 2010,
thrust itself into the news again this year by offering legal
and logistical help for Snowden. It put a chartered airplane on
stand-by after Snowden, who had worked as a government
contractor in  Hawaii , surfaced in  Hong Kong  following newspaper
reports of material he later acknowledged providing about
surveillance.  Plane Arranged  Olafur Vignir Sigurvinsson, an Iceland-based WikiLeaks
representative who arranged the plane for Snowden, said by phone
this week that the charter was made possible through outside
funds from “friends,” though Snowden eventually made it to
Moscow on a regular OAO Aeroflot flight. WikiLeaks “did have a
hand in financing” the flight to Moscow, said Hrafnsson,
declining to specify the cost.  Sigurvinsson said there are “currently” no plans to fly
Snowden from the international transit area of Moscow’s airport,
where he is seeking asylum in other countries. The U.S. has
accused Snowden of espionage and theft and revoked his passport.  WikiLeaks said yesterday on Twitter that Snowden had not
“formally” accepted asylum in  Venezuela , disputing earlier
reports. The group said “states concerned will make the
announcement if and when the appropriate time comes. The
announcement will then be confirmed by us.” WikiLeaks has 1.9
million followers on Twitter.  Assange At Bay  WikiLeaks has been struggling with financing and relevance
as founder Julian Assange is holed up at the Ecuadorian embassy
in  London  to avoid extradition to  Sweden . The group also lost
more than $50 million of potential donations after Visa  Europe ,
 MasterCard Inc. (MA)  and  American Express Co. (AXP)  stopped payments to the
WikiLeaks in 2010, according to Assange.  Rebecca Kaufman, a spokeswoman at Mastercard, and Jennifer
Doidge, a spokeswoman for Visa, didn’t immediately respond to
voicemails seeking comment.  Visa and MasterCard, along with PayPal, Bank of America and
Western Union had suspended processing payments for WikiLeaks
when the site published classified documents leaked by Manning,
who’s currently on trial in the U.S.  The blockade was lifted this year following a court battle
by Reykjavik-based DataCell, which processes WikiLeaks payments.  The  Supreme Court  of Iceland required the payment gateway
opened, according to an agreement made with DataCell, Visa
Europe said in a statement today, and  Visa Europe  hasn’t sought
to prevent compliance with that legal order.  ‘Blockade’ Effect  “The banking blockade has had a dramatic effect” on
WikiLeaks, Hrafnsson said. “The most serious aspect of the
banking blockade is that it stripped us of the ability to expand
and carry out the projects we had in mind.”  The group last year spent almost 400,000 euros after
receiving just 69,000 euros in donations, according to the Wau
Holland Foundation’s annual report. While Wikileak’s funding
comes “mostly from Wau Holland,” Hrafnsson said, he couldn’t
immediately say how much comes from other sources.  WikiLeaks can now process donations via MasterCard and Visa
through a payment gateway in  France , Hrafnsson said.  Other Assistance  The San Francisco-based Freedom of the Press Foundation is
raising money online for WikiLeaks and other journalism
organizations, according to executive director Trevor Timm. The
foundation has taken in more than $300,000 since fundraising
began in mid-December, with 40 percent going to WikiLeaks. The
money for WikiLeaks goes to Wau Holland, he said.  The press foundation also is raising money to hire court
stenographers for Manning’s military trial to make the
proceedings available to the public, Timm said.  Wau Holland reported collecting 1.5 million euros for
WikiLeaks from 2010-12, according to its annual report. It
raised 1.3 million euros in 2010, it reported, with collections
declining to 69,000 euros in 2012.  The foundation listed the main expenses for WikiLeaks as
178,000 euros stemming from “campaigns,” or from content
review, “journalist contextualization” and external
communications. It spent 134,000 euros on logistics, 37,000
euros on infrastructure and 18,000 euros on legal advice,
according to Wau.  Paring Expenses  “Development of donations over the past two years has
declined substantially, and is currently no longer able to
provide the earlier levels support for the project,” Wau stated
in the report. “Since January 2013 the foundation has only been
able to cover expenditures in essential infrastructure, such as
servers.”  Wau Holland was set up in memory of Herwart “Wau”
Holland-Moritz, who founded the Chaos Computer Club in 1981 and
died in 2001. The foundation’s aim is to “promote and pursue
his unique freethinking in relation to freedom of communication
and informational self-determination,” according to  its
website.   WikiLeaks seeks donations of 10 euros to 250 euros ($13 to
$319) on its website via  credit card  through a French bank, or
through PayPal or with Bitcoins. It also gets money from crowd
sourcing through the Freedom of the Press Foundation, asking for
donations from $25 to $5,000. The foundation also raises money
for the Center for Public Integrity.  Hrafnsson declined to comment on how much funding WikiLeaks
needs to keep up operations, which requires powerful computers
and large amounts of data storage. He also said he doesn’t have
an immediate overview of the incoming cash.  “We’re talking about tens of thousands of donors, giving
an average of 20 to 30 euros,” he said. “The highest donation
was 1,200 euros,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
