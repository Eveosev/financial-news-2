Qbotix Inc. , a closely held robotics
company, received $5 million in venture capital financing to
improve its systems that adjust solar panels to keep them facing
the sun.  The investment from New Enterprise Associates Inc.,
Firelake Capital Management LLC and Draper Fisher Jurvetson
brings the companyâ€™s total funding to $12.5 million, Qbotix said
today in a statement.  Qbotix uses mobile robots to rotate solar panels toward the
sun, an alternative to the dual-axis or single-axis tracking
systems that currently perform the same function.  The company, based in Menlo Park,  California , will use the
funding to develop more types of robots, Mike Merwin, a
spokesman, said by e-mail. Qbotix today introduced new robots
that each can service 340 kilowatts of panels, a 13 percent
improvement from its current systems, according to the
statement.  Its battery-powered robots ride on a monorail around arrays
of solar panels and link up with each to mechanically tilt them
toward the sun, similar to standard tracking systems but without
the need for extra steel and motors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
