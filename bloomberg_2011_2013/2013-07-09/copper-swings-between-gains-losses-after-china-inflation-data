Copper swung between gains and losses
after producer prices in  China , the world’s biggest user of
metals, extended their longest streak of declines in a decade
while consumer inflation stayed subdued.  Metal for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange was little changed at $6,829.50 a metric ton at 11:59
a.m. in  Shanghai  after trading between $6,781 and $6,858. Zinc,
tin and aluminum dropped while lead and nickel were little
changed.  Factory-gate prices fell 2.7 percent in June from a year
ago, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed today.
This compared with a median estimate of a loss of 2.6 percent in
a Bloomberg News survey and also marked the worst run since
2002. Data on July 1 showed two gauges of China’s manufacturing
fell in June, underscoring a sustained slowdown in the world’s
second biggest economy.  “The data affirmed traders’ views that the economy isn’t
doing well,” Jia Zheng, an analyst at East Asia Futures Co.,
said by phone from Shanghai. “But it didn’t give any further
negative surprises, so copper is likely to drift at this level
for a while.”  Copper for delivery in October on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange rose 0.8 percent to 49,020  yuan  ($7,995) a ton. Metal
for delivery in September on the Comex was little changed at
$3.098 a pound.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
