Ghana  arrested 1,568 foreigners and
51 nationals since June 1 in a bid to end illegal mining in
Africa’s second-biggest gold producer.  As many as 3,877 foreigners have been deported, including
those who volunteered for repatriation, Minister of Lands and
Natural Resources Inusah Fuseini told reporters today in the
capital, Accra. He didn’t disclose their nationalities.
President John Dramani Mahama formed a task force on unlawful
mining in May with the power to arrest illegal operators.  Ghana’s mining laws forbid foreigners from small-scale
mining, Fuseini said, while Ghanaians must obtain licenses to do
so.  “The resolve of the inter-ministerial task force to clean
out the small-scale mining sector is unwavering,” Fuseini said.
“We will pursue all violators of our mining laws.”  The minister said that lead, copper and zinc have been
discovered at Buem in the Nkwanta area of the country’s Volta
Region. Investigations are under way to determine their
commercial viability, he said.  Besides gold, diamonds, manganese and bauxite are also
mined in the country. Miners include Johannesburg-based
 AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (AU) ,  Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI)  and GreenWood Village,
Colorado-based  Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM)   To contact the reporter on this story:
