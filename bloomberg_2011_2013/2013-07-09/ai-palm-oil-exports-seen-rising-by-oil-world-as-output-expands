Thailand , the world’s third-largest
 palm oil  producer, may boost exports to a record this year as
output increases, Oil World said.  Thailand may export as much as 450,000 metric tons of palm
oil, up from 304,000 tons a year earlier, the Hamburg-based
researcher said today in an e-mailed report. Shipments totaled
227,000 tons from January through May, up 24 percent from the
same time in 2012. While production may “slightly exceed” 1.7
million tons, some analysts’ estimates are as high as 2 million
tons, Oil World said. Production five years ago was 1.3 million
tons.  “Latest export data confirm a pronounced further uptrend
of palm oil production in Thailand, owing to a larger mature
area and higher yields,” Oil World said. The European Union
“still was the largest destination, but in particular demand
from  India  increased sharply in recent months.”  Palm oil futures are down 1.7 percent this year on the
Bursa  Malaysia  Derivatives, after declining 23 percent in 2012
on rising output in Indonesia and Malaysia, the world’s top
producers.  U.S. palm oil imports were a record 145,000 tons in May, up
from 59,000 tons in the same month a year earlier, Oil World
said. Purchases in the first five months of the year were
575,000 tons, up 46 percent from the same period in 2012. Total
net imports of 17 oils and fats in the U.S. were 223,000 tons in
May, more than four times higher than last year, according to
the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
