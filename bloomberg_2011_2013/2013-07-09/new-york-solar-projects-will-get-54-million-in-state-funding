The  New York State Energy Research
and Development Authority , which administers incentive programs
for solar energy, is awarding $54 million to 79 projects in the
state.  The funds will be paired with $120 million in private
financing to support projects totaling 64 megawatts of capacity,
the authority said today in a statement on its website. Hanwha
Group and  SolarCity Corp. (SCTY)  were among the 20 recipients.  The program caps funding at $3 million a project and
requires private investments, according to the statement.
Today’s awards represent the second of three rounds for current
proposals under review, the authority said. It  awarded  $46
million for 76 project in March.  The incentives have been dropping as solar energy costs
have declined, the authority said. The “portfolio-weighted
average” incentive awarded today was 84 cents a watt, or about
31 percent of the cost to build the projects, down from $1.30 a
watt in 2011, 93 cents a watt in 2012 and 88 cents a watt in
March.  The installations will be located at businesses, factories,
municipal buildings, colleges and other commercial or industrial
sites in 26 counties, according to the statement.  New York  ranked 10th in the nation for new solar capacity
installed in 2012, according to the Solar Energy Industries
Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
