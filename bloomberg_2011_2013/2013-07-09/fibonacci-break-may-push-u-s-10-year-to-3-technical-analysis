U.S.  10-year note  yields are
approaching levels that could signal a rise to more than 3
percent for the first time in two years, according to Royal Bank
of Canada’s  RBC Capital Markets , citing technical analysis.  Pointing to an “uptrend that has been in place since early
May,”  George Davis , chief technical analyst at Toronto-based
RBC, wrote yesterday in a report to clients that a daily close
above 2.8 percent would expose the 61.8 percent Fibonacci
retracement level of 2.86 percent, adding to bearish sentiment
and a move up to the 3.04 percent level. Yields have risen as
investors have fled  U.S. debt  with the Federal Reserve
forecasting economic growth strong enough for the central bank
to begin tapering its monthly bond-buying program.  Failure to break the 2.80 resistance level could cause
yields to fall to support levels near 2.57 percent and 2.46
percent, the report said.  “We may be setting up for a scenario similar to that seen
in late June -- where a sharp upmove in yields was followed by a
corrective pullback,” Davis wrote.  The  10-year yield  fell 10 basis points, or 0.10 percentage
point, to 2.64, yesterday in  New York  after touching 2.75
percent, the highest since Aug. 1, 2011. It last touched 3
percent on July 27, 2011. Ten-year notes have lost 6.8 percent
this year, versus a 3.5 percent lost in the broader Treasury
market, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index. Resistance refers to an
area on a chart where sell orders may be clustered, and support
is an area where there may be buy orders.  Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that securities
tend to rise or fall by specific percentages after reaching a
high or low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
