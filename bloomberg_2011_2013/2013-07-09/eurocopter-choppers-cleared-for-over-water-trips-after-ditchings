Eurocopter (EAD)  SAS EC225 and AS332
helicopters, models used widely in the oil and gas industry, are
able to fly over water again after the lifting of restrictions
imposed following two crashes last year.  The European Aviation Safety Agency approved a compliance
regime developed for the Super Puma models, the Cologne,
Germany-based organization said in an airworthiness directive.
The order imposes power limits and demands regular inspections.  “Restrictions placed on the operation of an affected Super
Puma can now be lifted,” the U.K. Civil Aviation Authority --
which imposed over-water flight restriction together with
Norwegian and Danish authorities -- said separately.  Regulators imposed the restrictions following ditchings in
the North Sea in May and October 2012 subsequently linked to the
cracking of a shaft that drives the main rotor blades. While
flights will be permitted within specified limits following the
EASA directive, a permanent fix is due next year, Eurocopter
Chief Executive Officer Guillaume Faury said last month.  The 11-metric ton EC225 can transport 19 people as far as
800 kilometers (500 miles), making it a popular choice for the
servicing of oil rigs. Major operator  Bristow Group Inc. (BRS)  said
June 25 it expected revenue service with the model to resume in
the fourth quarter once personnel are trained to deal with the
inspection regime and customer confidence has been restored.  Eurocopter, the world’s biggest helicopter manufacturer, is
a unit of European Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
