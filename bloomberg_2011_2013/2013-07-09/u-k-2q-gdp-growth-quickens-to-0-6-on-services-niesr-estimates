U.K. construction output was unchanged in May from the previous month, according to new seasonally adjusted data released by the statistics office.  Construction, which accounts for 6.3 percent of the economy, fell 4.8 percent from a year earlier, the  Office for National Statistics  said in London. It’s the first time the ONS has published monthly seasonally adjusted construction data. In April, construction rose 4.6 percent from the previous month and declined 2.2 percent compared with a year earlier.  Today’s report also showed that on a non-seasonally adjusted basis, construction output rose 4.4 percent in May from April and declined 3.4 percent compared with a year earlier.  Construction was a drag on growth in the first quarter, when gross domestic product rose 0.3 percent. Construction fell 1.8 percent in that period.  The National Institute of Economic and Social Research has estimated that GDP rose 0.6 percent in the second quarter. It said the acceleration was “largely due to the performance of the private service sector. The ONS is scheduled to publish its first estimate of second-quarter GDP on July 25.
