Treasury three-year notes yielded
more than double their levels in May before the U.S. sells $32
billion of the securities amid speculation the  Federal Reserve 
is preparing to reduce debt purchases.  The three-year notes being sold today yielded 0.715 percent
in pre-auction trading, compared with a yield of 0.354 percent
at the May 28 auction of the securities. The U.S. is due to sell
$21 billion of 10-year notes tomorrow and $13 billion of 30-year
bonds on July 11. Yields have increased on bets the  U.S. economy 
is strong enough to allow Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  and
policy makers to start trimming the asset buying that has helped
cap borrowing costs. The Fed will release minutes of its June
18-19 meeting tomorrow.  “There’s demand for short-term Treasuries -- the auction
should do fairly well,” said Aaron Kohli, an interest-rate
strategist in New York at BNP Paribas SA, one of 21 primary
dealers obligated to bid at U.S. debt auctions. “People are
looking at what happens with Bernanke. Tapering may be done by
middle of next year. They are looking to him for dimensions on
how they plan to do it, and are they still as data dependent as
they were.”  The current three-year note  yield  was little changed at
0.68 percent at 11:18 a.m. in  New York , according to Bloomberg
Bond Trader prices.  The benchmark 10-year  yield  fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 2.62 percent. The 1.75 percent note
maturing in May 2023 rose 1/8, or $1.25 per $1,000 face value,
to 92 15/32.  Short Bets  Ten-year yields jumped 24 basis points on July 5 when the
government reported the economy added 195,000 jobs in June,
compared with the median forecast of 165,000 in a Bloomberg News
survey of analysts. Treasuries rose yesterday amid speculation
the yield surge had been too rapid.  The U.S. 10-year yield’s 14-day  relative strength index  was
at 67 after rising to 77 on July 5, above the level of 70 that
some traders see as a sign a reversal is imminent.  Investors in Treasuries remained net short this week even
as they trimmed the bets that prices of the securities will
drop, according to a survey by JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The  proportion  of net shorts was at 4 percentage points in
the week ending yesterday, down from 6 percentage points in the
previous week, according to JPMorgan.  Outright longs, or bets the securities will increase in
value, rose to 15 percent, from 13 percent, the survey said,
while outright shorts remained at 19 percent. Investors cut
neutral bets to 66 percent from 68 percent.  ‘Auction Play’  “I don’t think Treasuries are going to rally any
further,” said Barra Sheridan, a rates trader at Bank of
Montreal in  London . “We think they can cheapen up into the
three-year auction. There isn’t a lot of data so it’s really an
auction play this week. I’m a seller at 2.65 percent.”  U.S. three-year notes handed investors a loss of 0.5
percent this year through yesterday, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch indexes. Ten-year notes dropped 6.2
percent and 30-year bonds tumbled 11 percent, the data show.  At the previous auction of three-year notes on June 11,
investors  bid  for 2.95 times the amount available, the lowest
level since December 2010.  Indirect bidders, the investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 33.1 percent of the securities, the
most since September.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer
investors that place their bids directly with the Treasury,
purchased 8.4 percent, the lowest since August.  ‘Tremendous Move’  “You’ve had a tremendous move in three-year yields --
demand will be OK,” said  Dan Greenhaus , chief global strategist
in New York at broker-dealer BTIG LLC.  The bias is to the downside, Greenhaus said, adding that
Treasury yields may drop before ultimately moving higher again.  The central bank is buying $85 billion of bonds a month to
put downward pressure on borrowing costs. Bernanke said on June
19 that policy makers may begin slowing purchases this year
should the U.S. economy meet the central bank’s goals.  World economic growth will struggle to accelerate this year
as a U.S. expansion weakens,  China ’s economy levels off and
 Europe ’s recession deepens, the  International Monetary Fund 
said.  Global growth will be 3.1 percent this year, unchanged from
the 2012 rate, and less than the 3.3 percent forecast in April,
the Washington-based fund said today, trimming its prediction
for this year a fifth consecutive time. The IMF reduced its 2013
projection for the U.S. to 1.7 percent growth from 1.9 percent
in April, while next year’s outlook was trimmed to 2.7 percent
from 3 percent initially reported in April.  Reuters reported that European Central Bank Executive-Board
Member Joerg Asmussen said policy makers’ forward guidance, that
 interest rates  will stay low for an extended period, goes beyond
a year.  Target Rate  The Fed has kept its target for overnight bank lending in a
range of zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008. It has said
it will consider raising the  target  when unemployment falls to
6.5 percent, versus 7.6 percent as of June.  Thirty-day federal funds futures for delivery in March 2015
yielded 0.52 percent, indicating investors expect Fed rates to
be higher by then. The contract settles at the average overnight
fed funds rate for the delivery month.  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Merrill Lynch
Option Volatility Estimate MOVE Index fell to 107.78 yesterday
from 117.89 at the end of last week, which was the highest level
since December 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
