Professional gambler Mark Kroon leads
after opening-round play at the  World Series of Poker  main
event, a 12-day Texas Hold ’Em tournament that carries a purse
of almost $60 million.  Kroon, a poker pro from Madison,  Wisconsin , who has
finished in the money twice previously, took the lead on the
final hand yesterday and holds a chip count of 246,900 at the
Rio All-Suite Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas. He is followed by
Imari Love of  Chicago  (214,300), Clement Tripodi of  France 
(207,050) and Karlo Lopez of Puerto Rico (196,550).  Of the 6,352 entrants, the main event’s lowest total in at
least six years, 4,186 remain after the three-day first round.
The tournament has a $10,000 buy-in and carries a prize pool of
$59.7 million split among the top 648 finishers, with $8.4
million to the winner.  Action resumes today with the first installment of the two-day second round, when all remaining entrants will play either
today or tomorrow. The second round historically pares the field
in half, and about a third of those who survive the second round
typically finish in the money, according to the WSOP website.  Greg Merson, last year’s winner, has an above-average chip
count of 81,650. Other professionals remaining include Phil Ivey
(119,650), Phil Hellmuth (92,850) and Daniel Negreanu (15,000).  Huck Seed, Jonathan Duhamel and Robert Varkonyi, all former
champions, didn’t survive the first round. Others eliminated
included David Einhorn, president of New York-based Greenlight
Capital, and Bill Perkins, the founder of Houston-based Skylar
Capital Management, who won $2 million in a charity tournament
at this year’s WSOP.  The main event runs through July 15, when the field will be
narrowed to nine players to compete in the final table Nov. 4-5.  To contact the reporters on this story:
