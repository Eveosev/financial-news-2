Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  rose as a decline in inventories helped offset the
impact of increased output from mills.  Rebar for delivery in January on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange climbed as much as 0.4 percent to 3,624 yuan ($591) a
metric ton before trading at 3,618 yuan at 10:15 a.m. local time.
Futures fell yesterday for the first time in five days.  China ’s daily crude steel output in late June was rose
about 0.8 percent to 2.18 million tons from mid-June,
Custeel.com analyst Hu Yanping said yesterday, citing data from
the China Iron and Steel Association. Rebar  inventory  tracked by
Shanghai’s Steelhome Information Technology Co. fell 2.5 percent
last week after declining 26 percent last quarter.  “Stockpiles have been steadily decreasing for three months,
which is a positive sign despite the higher output,” Ren Xinlei,
an analyst at Luzheng Futures Co., said from Jinan today.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port in China
fell for the first time in eight days yesterday, by 0.6 percent
to $121.90 a dry ton, according to The Steel Index Ltd.  The average  spot price  for rebar in China was little
changed at 3,407  yuan  a ton yesterday, according to data from
