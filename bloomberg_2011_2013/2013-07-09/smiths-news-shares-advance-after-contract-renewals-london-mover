Smiths News Plc (NWS)  rose the most in 15
months after the U.K. distributor of newspapers and magazines
announced two contract extensions worth about 322 million pounds
($478 million) a year.  The  shares  climbed 7.7 percent to 168 pence, the biggest
advance since April 2012. The volume of trading was more than
twice the three-month daily average.  A wholesale deal with Associated Newspapers Ltd., worth
about 213 million pounds a year, has been extended to October
2021, while a wholesale agreement with Comag, valued at about
109 million pounds a year, has been extended to December 2020,
the Swindon, England-based company said in a statement today.
Smiths also said its “on track” to meet the market consensus
for pretax profit for the year to Aug. 31.  “Today’s contract renewals within News are clearly good
news for the medium term,” James Tetley, an analyst at N+1
Singer, said in a note. “We consider this a reassuring
update.” N+1 Singer raised its recommendation on the stock to
buy from hold and kept a price target of 185 pence a share.  Victoria Prior, an analyst at JPMorgan, reiterated an
overweight rating on the stock today and set a price prediction
of 213 pence, a 37 percent premium to yesterday’s closing price.  Total group revenue climbed 0.7 percent in the 44 weeks
ended July 6, compared with a year earlier, helped by the April
2012 acquisition of The Consortium, a distributor of educational
and care products, according to today’s statement. Sales dropped
3.2 percent at the Smiths News unit.  The Associated Newspapers contract covers 23 percent of the
national newspaper distribution market, including the  Daily
Mail . Comag is responsible for distribution of titles including
Cosmopolitan and GQ.  To contact the reporter on this story:
