Hog futures dropped on speculation
that U.S. demand is slowing because of high pork prices and amid
concern that the rising dollar is curbing exports. Cattle prices
rose.  Wholesale- pork  prices are up 29 percent this year and
reached $1.1133 a pound on June 26, the highest since at least
October 1997, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.
 Shipments  of the meat are down 13 percent in the five months
through May 31 from a year earlier, according to the USDA. The
 dollar  climbed to a three-year high against a basket of six
major currencies, reducing the appeal of U.S. supplies for
overseas buyers.  Wholesale pork reached “new record highs, which typically
would mean you’ll probably move some of your demand,” Mark Schultz, a chief analyst at Northstar Commodity Investment Co.
in  Minneapolis , said in a telephone interview. “Couple that
with the rising U.S. dollar, and it probably slows export demand
for a bit.”  Hog futures for August settlement fell 0.1 percent to
95.425 cents a pound at 10:28 a.m. on the  Chicago  Mercantile
Exchange. Prices were up 11 percent this year though yesterday.  Cattle futures for August delivery gained 0.2 percent to
$1.22275 a pound in Chicago.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement fell 0.2
percent to $1.5125 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
