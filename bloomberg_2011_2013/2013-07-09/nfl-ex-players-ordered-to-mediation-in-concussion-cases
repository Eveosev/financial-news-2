The judge overseeing litigation
brought by thousands of former National Football League players
over head injuries ordered the parties into mediation ahead of a
ruling on the league’s request to dismiss the lawsuits.  U.S. District Judge Anita Brody in Philadelphia ordered the
league and retired players to enter into settlement talks with
Layn Phillips, a former federal judge, as mediator. Brody
yesterday also ordered all parties and their lawyers not to
publicly discuss the mediation process.  The NFL is seeking to have lawsuits filed by more than
4,000 former players dismissed. In cases consolidated before
Brody, the athletes accuse the league of negligence and failing
to inform them of the link between repeated traumatic head
impacts and long-term brain injuries.  Brody was scheduled to rule on the league’s motion to
dismiss on July 22. She has now asked for a progress report on
talks by Sept. 3. An order on the NFL’s motion won’t be entered
until then, according to the filing.  The case is In re National Football Players’ Concussion
Injury Litigation, 12-md-02323, U.S. District Court, Eastern
District of  Pennsylvania  (Philadelphia).  To contact the reporter on this story:
