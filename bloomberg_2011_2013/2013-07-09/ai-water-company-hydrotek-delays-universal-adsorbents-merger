Hydrotek Pcl (HYDRO) , a Thai water company,
has indefinitely postponed its plan to merge with  Universal
Adsorbents & Chemicals Pcl (UAC) , citing unfavorable market conditions
at home and abroad.  The water-treatment company in a regulatory filing to the
Stock Exchange of Thailand said it agreed to delay the merger as
markets have “been fluctuating significantly” without saying
when they may resume. The stock has fallen five straight days,
trimming gains the past year to 76 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
