First Data  Corp., led by former
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  co-Chief Operating Officer Frank Bisignano,
hired the New York-based bank’s former Chief Information Officer
Guy Chiarello as president.  Chiarello, 53, will receive an annual base salary of $1
million and a bonus of no less than $2.5 million for 2013,
Atlanta-based First Data said today in a regulatory filing. He
will also be granted a signing bonus of $6.5 million that can be
clawed back if he quits or is terminated for cause within two
years, according to the filing.  First Data, owned by private-equity firm KKR & Co.,
recruited Bisignano in April from the biggest U.S. bank by
assets. First Data, the largest merchant acquirer in the U.S.,
helps retailers accept credit- and debit-card payments.  Chiarello was CIO of JPMorgan for about five and a half
years and held technology roles at New York-based Morgan Stanley
for 23 years, according to the filing. The Wall Street Journal
reported in May that Chiarello was leaving JPMorgan.  Technology and security were among Bisignano’s
responsibilities as co-COO, and he held executive roles within
the payments industry earlier in his career. Bisignano, 53, was
Citigroup Inc.’s CEO of global transaction services from 2002 to
2005 and executive vice president of consumer lending in the
early 1990s for First Fidelity Bancorp.  Matt Zames  became JPMorgan’s sole COO when Bisignano left
the bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
