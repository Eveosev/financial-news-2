Confidence among U.S. small
businesses cooled in June after reaching a one-year high the
prior month even as more companies said they plan to add jobs.  The  National Federation of Independent Business ’s optimism
 index  decreased to 93.5 last month from 94.4. The June figure
was the second-highest in a year. Five of the measure’s 10
components contributed to the decline, the Washington-based
group said.  The share of business owners expecting sales to increase
fell by 3 percentage points to 5 percent in June, and fewer
companies planned to increase inventories. At the same time, a
measure of  job creation  plans was the fourth-highest since 2007
and there was less pessimism about the outlook for the economy.  “The economy remains bifurcated, with the big firms
producing most of the GDP growth with little help from small
business,”  William Dunkelberg , the group’s chief economist,
said in a statement. “That balance is shifting, but
unfortunately because larger firms are losing ground, not
because small business is growing faster.”  The NFIB report was based on a survey of 662 small-business
owners through June 30. Small companies represent more than 99
percent of all U.S employers, according to the U.S. Small
Business Administration. A small business is defined as an
independent enterprise with no more than 500 employees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
