Gasoline rose as the U.S. government
increased its demand outlook and on concern that one of the
largest refineries along the North American Atlantic Coast will
slow output. Crack spreads widened.  Futures gained as much as 1.1 percent. The U.S. Energy
Information Administration boosted its outlook for 2013 gasoline
use to 8.67 million barrels a day. A train carrying crude to
Irving Oil Corp.’s 298,800-barrel-a-day Saint John refinery in
 New Brunswick  derailed and exploded in the Quebec town of Lac-Megantic early July 6, killing at least 13 people.  “Gasoline has been supported by concern that Irving might
have to cut back its crude runs as a result of losing some crude
supply,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Houston-based Lipow Oil
Associates LLC. “It’s not like that rail line is back in
service.”  August-delivery gasoline rose 2.57 cents, or 0.9 percent,
to $2.9094 a gallon at 1:04 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Trading volume was 19 percent below the 100-day
average.  Gasoline’s  crack spread  versus WTI widened 98 cents to
$18.96 a barrel. The fuel’s  premium  over Brent gained $1.04 to
$14.73.  The Saint John refinery sends more than half its refined
products to the U.S. Northeast, according to the company’s
website.  Rail Traffic  It was unloading 80,000 to 90,000 barrels a day of crude
from rail cars last month and planned to increase volumes, Gary
Weimer, quality assurance manager of Mid-Continent crude for the
company, said during an oil quality conference in  Seattle ,
 Washington , June 6.  “They’re ramping up to more,” Weimer said at the meeting
hosted by the Crude Oil Quality Association. “I know where they
want to go to, and that’s not the end-point for us. We have more
rail cars coming online.”  Irving has been bringing oil into the Saint John refinery
by rail for about a year and half, offloading oil from the
Bakken oil-shale formation and mixed-sweet crudes from western
 Canada , according to Weimer.  The EIA’s demand forecast in its  Short-Term Energy Outlook 
was up from 8.66 million barrels a day in last month’s estimate,
which was the lowest level since 2001.  Higher Demand  Implied demand  for the fuel increased 300,000 barrels to
9.29 million barrels a day the week ended June 28, according to
EIA data.  “The more the economy keeps moving forward, the more we’re
going to see demand start to rise,” said Carl Larry, president
of Oil Outlooks & Opinions LLC in Houston.  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, rose 0.9 cent to $3.483 a
gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said today on its website.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel, or ULSD, for August delivery
gained 0.02 cent to $2.9803 a gallon on volume that was 30
percent below the 100-day average.  ULSD’s  crack spread  versus West Texas Intermediate crude
narrowed 12 cents to $21.90 a barrel. Its  premium  to Brent was
little changed at $17.73.  To contact the reporter on this story:
