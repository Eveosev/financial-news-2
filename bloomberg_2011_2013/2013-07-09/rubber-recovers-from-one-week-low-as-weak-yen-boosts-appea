Rubber rebounded from the lowest
level in a week as  Japan ’s currency weakened below 101 per
dollar, raising the appeal of yen-denominated futures.  Rubber for delivery in December added as much as 0.4
percent to 241 yen a kilogram ($2,383 a metric ton) and was at
240.3 yen on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange at 12:11 p.m. Futures
slid to 237 yen earlier, the lowest level for a most-active
contract since July 1.  The yen declined to 101.24 per dollar, nearing a five-week
low reached yesterday. The most-accurate foreign-exchange
forecasters expect the currency to fall about 9 percent this
year to levels not seen since 2008.  “Futures in Tokyo were supported by speculation that the
 Federal Reserve  will curtail stimulus and boost the dollar
further against the yen,” Takaki Shigemoto, an analyst at
research company JSC Corp., said by phone today. Gains were
limited by concerns that  China’s economy  is slowing.  China’s producer prices fell 2.7 percent in June, adding to
signs of slowdown in the nation’s economy and raising concerns
demand may weaken from the world’s largest user. The decline in
factory-gate prices extended its longest streak in a decade amid
slowing economic growth and lower commodity costs.  Rubber for January delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange added 0.4 percent to 17,365  yuan  ($2,833) a ton.
Natural-rubber inventories climbed 125 tons to 114,121 tons,
based on a survey of nine warehouses in Shanghai, Shandong,
Yunnan, Hainan and Tianjin, the exchange said July 5.  Thai rubber free-on-board remained unchanged at 82.45 baht
($2.62) a kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research
Institute of  Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
