Chubb Corp., the insurer of high-end
homes, said catastrophe losses were $240 million before taxes in
the second quarter.  Costs were $175 million in the U.S., primarily tied to
severe storms, and $65 million outside the country, mostly from
storms and flooding in Alberta, Canada, the Warren, New Jersey-based insurer said today in a statement distributed by PR
Newswire.  To contact the reporter on this story:
