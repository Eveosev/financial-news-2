A measure of job prospects in the
U.S. in June held close to the prior month’s reading,
indicating the labor market will take time to pick up.  The Conference Board’s Employment Trends Index increased
0.05 percent to 111.64, the New York-based research group said
today. The measure was up 3.8 percent from the same month last
year.  “Acceleration in employment growth is unlikely in the near
future,”  Gad Levanon , director of macroeconomic research at the
Conference Board, said in a statement.  Today’s report follows Labor Department data last week that
showed payrolls increased more than forecast in June, with
employers adding 195,000 workers for the second straight month.
The  unemployment rate  held at 7.6 percent and hourly earnings in
the year ended in June advanced by the most since July 2011.  Improvements in four of the Conference Board index’s eight
components contributed to the reading, today’s report showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
