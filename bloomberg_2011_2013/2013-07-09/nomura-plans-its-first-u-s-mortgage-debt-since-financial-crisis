Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) ,  Japan ’s biggest
brokerage, plans to sell securities tied to $440.1 million of
new U.S. home loans without government backing, its first such
deal since the debt helped spark the financial crisis in 2008.  The transaction is tied to prime jumbo mortgages, all of
which were originated by  First Republic Bank (FRC) , Kroll Bond Rating
Agency said today in a pre-sale report. The ratings company
plans to assign top grades to most of the debt, with homeowner
equity averaging 34.4 percent providing “a substantial margin
of safety against potential home price declines.”  Neither Nomura nor First Republic, nor any of their
affiliates, “intend to retain any interest in the
securitization,” Kroll said in the report.  The securities are being sold with investors in the market
demanding safer bonds and higher yields relative to benchmark
interest rates as a potential slowing of Federal Reserve debt
buying roils credit markets. Jonathan Hodgkinson, a spokesman
for Nomura in New York, didn’t immediately return an e-mail
seeking comment.  Sales of bonds known as  non-agency mortgage securities  had
been recovering after freezing five years ago amid tumbling home
values and soaring defaults, following issuance of $1.2 trillion
in each of 2005 and 2006. Deals tied to new loans total about $8
billion this year, up from $3.5 billion in all of 2012,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Jumbo home loans are ones larger than allowed in
government-supported programs, currently as much as $729,750 for
single-family properties in some areas. For Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac loans with the lowest costs for borrowers using 20
percent down payments, limits range from $417,000 to $625,500.  To contact the reporters on this story:
