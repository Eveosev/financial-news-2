The rand gained for a second day as
an illegal strike at a South African platinum company ended and
the dollar weakened against major peers before Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke speaks tomorrow. Bonds advanced.  Anglo American Platinum Ltd. (AMS) , the world’s biggest producer
of the metal, said miners at two of its operations returned to
work today. Gold jumped to a two-week high as Bernanke prepares
to speak tomorrow amid speculation he will provide further
guidance on plans to scale back asset purchases.  “It looks like the strike news is starting to lose its
effect,” Jim Bryson, head of foreign-exchange trading at Rand
Merchant Bank, said by phone from Johannesburg. “The rand is
strengthening in line with everything else. With Bernanke
speaking tomorrow, the market is in wait-and-see mode.”  South Africa’s currency advanced 1.1 percent to 10.0513 per
dollar as of 10:26 a.m. in Johannesburg. Yields on benchmark
10.5 percent bonds due December 2026 dropped nine basis points,
or 0.09 percentage point, to 8.03 percent.  Bullion slid 23 percent last quarter as some investors lost
faith in the metal as a store of value and Bernanke said the Fed
may slow asset purchases this year if the economy continues to
improve in line with its projections. Gold and platinum together
account for about 20 percent of South Africa’s exports,
according to government data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
