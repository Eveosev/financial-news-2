Vanguard Group Inc., the biggest U.S.
mutual-fund firm, had its first monthly redemptions in
almost 20 years in June as investors sold bond funds in
anticipation of the  Federal Reserve  scaling back its asset
purchases.  Vanguard saw net withdrawals of $100 million from mutual
funds and exchange-traded funds for the month, the first since
December 1994,  John Woerth , a spokesman for the Valley Forge,
Pennsylvania-based firm, wrote in an e-mailed statement.
Investors pulled $9.7 billion from the company’s bond offerings,
while adding to stock funds and money-market products.  “All streaks must come to an end,” Woerth wrote in the e-mail. Vanguard attracted $76.8 billion in investor deposits in
the first half of 2013, he said.  The flight from bonds was triggered by Fed Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke , who told Congress on May 22 that the U.S. central bank
may start reducing its bond purchases. The yield on the  10-year
Treasury note  climbed to 2.64 percent today from 1.93 percent on
May 21, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Investors pulled about $60 billion from U.S. bond funds in
June, the biggest monthly redemptions in records going back to
1961, according to estimates from the  Investment Company
Institute . Pacific Investment Management Co., the world’s
largest active fixed-income manager, had a record $14.5 billion
in net redemptions.  Vanguard managed more than $2.2 trillion in U.S. fund
assets as of May 31, according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
