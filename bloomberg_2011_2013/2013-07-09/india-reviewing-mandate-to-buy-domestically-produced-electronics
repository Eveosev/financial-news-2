India  will review a policy preference
for domestically-manufactured electronic goods after business
groups called for it to be withdrawn and companies raised
concerns on procurement of security-sensitive products.  The so-called PMA policy will be recalibrated and presented
to the cabinet, according to a  statement  posted on Prime
Minister  Manmohan Singh ’s website yesterday. The Department of
Electronics and  Information Technology  will submit the revised
policy within four weeks, it said.  The American Chamber of Commerce in India, Japan
Information Technology Service Industry Association and the
U.S.-India Business Council were among 35 business groups that
asked the government in April to rescind the policy, saying it
may violate India’s obligations to the  World Trade Organization 
if applied to private companies.  “Concerns have been raised in many quarters on different
aspects of the PMA Policy, particularly policy relating to
procurement by the private sector for electronic products with
security implications,” according to the statement. “The
revised proposal on PMA in the private sector for security
related products will not have domestic manufacturing
requirements, percentage based or otherwise.”  The new proposal will include a detailed provision for
project and product sector specific security standards,
alternative modes of security certification, and a road map for
buildup of domestic testing capacity, the government said in the
statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
