Cocaine output in the Andes region
fell 10 percent last year as  Colombia  and Peru increased efforts
to eradicate production and enforce the law, the U.S. government
said today.  Pure cocaine production in  Bolivia  fell 18 percent to 155
metric tons (341,717 pounds) in 2012, the White House  Office of
National Drug Control Policy  said today in an e-mailed
statement. Colombian output dropped 7.9 percent to 175 metric
tons and Peru’s production slid 4.9 percent to 290 metric tons,
according to the statement. The three nations are the world’s
biggest producers of the drug, while the U.S. is its top
consumer. Cocaine production has dropped 41 percent in the past
decade, the U.S. report says.  The reductions can be traced to factors including the
strengthened partnership between the U.S. and Colombia and
Peruvian President  Ollanta Humala ’s increased commitment to
counter-narcotics cooperation and security, the office said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
