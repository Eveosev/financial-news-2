The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
approved new global capital rules and a proposal to boost
requirements for U.S. banks above the international standards.  The five-member FDIC board voted 4-1 today for the 3
percent leverage ratio mandated by the international Basel III
accord, and unanimously proposed to boost that minimum at eight
of the biggest U.S. lenders to 5 percent of assets for parent
companies and 6 percent for their banking units.  The FDICâ€™s action brings the U.S. closer to meeting global
agreements on bolstering banks. The 2010 Basel III rules are
designed to prevent a repeat of the 2008 crisis that almost
destroyed the financial system.  The changes would make lenders fund more assets with
capital that can absorb  losses  instead of with borrowed money.
Bankers say this could force asset sales and pinch profit. The
 Federal Reserve  approved the international standard last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
