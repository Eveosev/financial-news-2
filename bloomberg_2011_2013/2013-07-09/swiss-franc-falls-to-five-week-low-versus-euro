The Swiss franc fell to a five-week
low against the euro after euro-area governments approved
additional aid to  Greece , reducing demand for the relative
safety of  Switzerland ’s currency.  The franc weakened for a fourth day against the common
currency and declined versus all except one of its 16 major
counterparts as European finance ministers agreed to release 3
billion euros ($3.9 billion) of aid to Greece, seeking to
counter the region’s debt crisis.  “Sentiment remained quite upbeat this morning, with Greece
getting another aid tranche, which is contributing to the
calming of tensions,” Christian Rohrer at Luzerner Kantonalbank
AG based in Lucerne, Switzerland, wrote in an e-mailed research
note.  The franc declined 0.4 percent to 1.24544 per euro as of
12:36 p.m. in Zurich after depreciating to 1.24673, the weakest
level since June 3. The Swiss currency dropped 0.5 percent to
96.83 centimes per dollar.  Greece will get 2.5 billion euros of aid this month and the
rest in October, as long as Prime Minister Antonis Samaras’s
coalition delivers on economic reforms and cuts to spending.
Creditors approved the financing after the European Commission,
 International Monetary Fund  and  European Central Bank  worked
through the weekend to seal an accord with the Greek government
on deficit-reduction steps.  The  Swiss National Bank  set a cap of 1.20 per euro on the
franc in September 2011 after the currency surged as investors
sought a haven from the euro-area debt crisis. With European
tensions easing, the franc weakened beyond 1.26 per euro in May
for the first time since 2011.  Abolishing the currency ceiling is still a way off, SNB
President Thomas Jordan said at the central bank’s most recent
policy meeting on June 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
