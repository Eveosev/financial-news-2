Investor expectations for Mexico
cost-of-living increases through 2014 declined after the
national statistics agency said consumer prices fell in June,
pushing inflation toward the central bank’s target range.  Yields on inflation-linked debt maturing December of next
year rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 0.36
percent at 9:43 a.m. in Mexico City, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The yield gap between that CPI-linked debt and
similar-maturity fixed-rate debt, a gauge of investors’
expectations for cost-of-living increases, fell five basis
points today to 3.75 percentage points. The peso increased 0.1
percent to 12.8665 per  U.S. dollar .  Demand for inflation-linked bonds due next December fell
after the national statistics agency said consumer prices in
June slid 0.06 percent from May, compared with a 0.02 percent
drop that was the median forecast of 22 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. Farm prices tumbled 3 percent, helping push annual
inflation to 4.09 percent from 4.63 percent in May, heading
toward the central bank’s 2 percent to 4 percent target range.  “Everybody expects inflation to come down,”  Pedro Tuesta ,
senior Latin America economist for 4Cast Ltd, said by phone from
 Washington . “The breakevens should be reflecting that.”  The yield on government peso bonds due in 2014 fell four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 4.13 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
