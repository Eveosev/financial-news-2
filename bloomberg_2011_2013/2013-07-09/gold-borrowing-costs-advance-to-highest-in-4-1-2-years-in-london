The cost of borrowing gold climbed to
a 4 1/2-year high in  London  at a time when record sales by
investors mean prices are poised for the biggest annual decline
in more than three decades.  The  one-month  lease rate rose to 0.2988 percent, the
highest since Dec. 18, 2008, from 0.2578 percent yesterday,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The rate is derived by
subtracting the  gold forward offered rate , which turned negative
yesterday for the first time since November 2008, from the
London Interbank Offered Rate.  Gold slid 25 percent this year, wiping $61.3 billion from
the value of gold  exchange-traded product  holdings, after some
investors lost faith in the metal as a store of value. While
banks from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to Credit Suisse Group AG
forecast more declines, the drop to a 34-month low in June
spurred an increase in physical buying. A scarcity of metal
liquidity in leasing can lead to high lease rates and negative
forward rates, the London Bullion Market Association says.  “Part of it could be to do with availability of physical
metal owing to strong demand still seen in  Asia ,”  James Moore ,
an analyst at FastMarkets Ltd. in London, said today by phone.
“We’ve seen gold come under quite a considerable selloff and it
may be the fact that there are new shorts in the market and
those shorts need covering as they get rolled forward.”  Gold Price  Gold for immediate delivery rose 1.3 percent to $1,252.66
an ounce by 3:24 p.m. in London. It reached $1,180.50 on June
28, the lowest since August 2010, after rallying for 12
consecutive years. This year’s drop is set to be the most since
1981. It’s the third-worst performer this year in the Standard &
Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24 commodities, behind corn and silver.  Prices slumped a record 23 percent in the second quarter as
the  Federal Reserve  said it may slow bond buying this year.
Investors sold 638.2 metric tons of gold through ETPs this year,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. The 1,993.8 tons now held is
the lowest since May 2010.  Gold “has been supported by reports of strong physical
buying in  China ,” Marc Ground, a commodity strategist at
Standard Bank Plc in Johannesburg, said today in a report.
“Reportedly, some retailers ran out of gold bars and gold
jewelry over the weekend. This is encouraging news in a
beleaguered market and might see physical market buying re-establish the $1,250-an-ounce support level.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
