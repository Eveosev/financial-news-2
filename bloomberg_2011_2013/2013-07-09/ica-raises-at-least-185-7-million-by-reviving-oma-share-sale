Empresas ICA SAB (ICA*) , the Mexican
construction company seeking to cut debt after two ratings
 downgrades , said it’s raising at least $185.7 million by selling
part of its airports unit two weeks after postponing a similar
deal.  Pricing for the sale of 60 million “B” shares in  Grupo
Aeroportuario del Centro Norte SAB , the airport operator known
as OMA, was fixed at 40 pesos per share and $24.76 per American
Depositary Receipt, the companies said in statements today. The
Mexico City-based builder is selling a smaller stake after
pulling back from a plan to offer 24 percent of OMA on June 25.  The transaction may raise an extra $27.8 million for ICA if
the deal’s underwriters exercise an option to buy an additional
9 million shares, boosting the total sale to about 17 percent of
the airport operator. ICA, which had its  credit rating  reduced
by Moody’s Investors Service and  Standard & Poor’s  in May due to
falling revenue and delays in public-works spending by President
Enrique Pena Nieto, will retain control of OMA through another
class of shares.  “We believe that while this offering will aid ICA with its
short-term cash needs, it should be a non-issue for OMA’s
fundamentals as its status quo should prevail,” Corporativo GBM
SAB analysts Luis Willard and Bernardo Velez wrote in a note to
clients today. “Nonetheless, liquidity of the stock should
improve.”  ICA climbed 0.5 percent to 23.87 pesos at 10:45 a.m. in
Mexico City. OMA fell 2.6 percent to 40.61 pesos after earlier
tumbling as much as 5.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
