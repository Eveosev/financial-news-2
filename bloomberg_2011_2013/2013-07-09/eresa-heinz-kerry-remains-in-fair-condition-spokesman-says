Teresa Heinz Kerry, wife of Secretary
of State John Kerry, remains in fair condition at Massachussets
General Hospital where her health “continues to improve,”
according to a statement from Kerry’s personal spokesman.  “Teresa Heinz Kerry continues to improve and remains in
fair condition at Massachusetts General Hospital, while doctors
seek the cause of seizure-like symptoms she experienced on
Sunday,” spokesman Glen Johnson said in an email.  Johnson said doctors had ruled out heart attack, stroke, or
a brain tumor as causes of the seizure-like symptoms that sent
Heinz Kerry to Nantucket Cottage hospital on July 7 during a
family vacation. From there, she was transferred to  Boston .  Johnson said Kerry would travel “briefly” to  Washington 
today to open the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue
that begins tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
