Robusta coffee reached a one-month
high in  London  on speculation supplies will be curbed as farmers
in leading grower  Vietnam  hold back beans and Ramadan’s start
may slow sales from third-ranking  Indonesia . Cocoa gained.  Coffee exports from Vietnam were probably 91,000 metric
tons in June, below 141,000 tons a year earlier, the agriculture
ministry estimated. The Muslim fasting month of Ramadan begins
in July this year. Futures for September delivery became more
expensive than the November contract yesterday, a backwardation
that usually signals supply concern.  “In robusta, Vietnamese are likely to keep holding on to
what is left of the remaining 2012-13 coffee crop, causing
premiums to rise again against London futures,”  Kona Haque , a
London-based analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd.,  Australia ’s
biggest investment bank, said in a report e-mailed today.  Robusta coffee for delivery in September added 2 percent to
$1,858 a ton by 10:58 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in London. Prices
touched $1,861, the highest since June 7. Arabica coffee for the
same delivery month rose 0.6 percent to $1.2415 a pound on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York.  The September robusta contract was at a $6-a-ton premium to
November futures, exchange prices showed. That compares with
yesterday’s $1 premium and a discount of $8 a week ago.  Cocoa for delivery in September advanced 1.1 percent to
1,525 pounds ($2,267) a ton in London after sliding 1.2 percent
yesterday. Cocoa for the same delivery month gained 0.7 percent
to $2,189 a ton in  New York .  “We remain mostly friendly on cocoa prices for the third
quarter and beyond, as we believe that the bulk of the West
African selling is complete now,” Haque said. “Recent pod-counting results indicate some dry-weather risks for the new-season main crop and July-to-August rainfall patterns will need
to be watched closely.”  Refined, or white, sugar for delivery in October rose 0.1
percent to $475.10 a ton on NYSE Liffe. Raw sugar for the same
delivery month added 0.4 percent to 16.39 cents a pound on ICE.  Sugar buying is set to ease as demand fueled by Ramadan
slows and supplies increase amid drier weather in  Brazil , the
world’s leading producer, Haque said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
