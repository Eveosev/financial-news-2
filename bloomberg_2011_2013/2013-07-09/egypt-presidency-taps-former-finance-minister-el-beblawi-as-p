Egypt ’s presidency named former
Finance Minister Hazem El-Beblawi to serve as interim prime
minister, leading a government that will administer new
elections and work to revive a crumbling economy.  El-Beblawi served as a finance minister in the transitional
period after the 2011 removal of  Hosni Mubarak . He inherits a
polarized nation reeling from the ouster of Mohamed Mursi, an
Islamist who last year became Egypt’s first democratically
elected civilian president.  His appointment was announced by the presidency of Adly Mansour today in an e-mailed statement.  A critic of Mursi’s economic policies, El-Beblawi will take
ownership of an economy stuck in the worst slowdown in two
decades, record unemployment and the highest budget deficit in
the Middle East.  To contact the reporter on this story:
