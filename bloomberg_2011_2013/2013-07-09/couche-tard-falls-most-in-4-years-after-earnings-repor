Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc. (ATD/B) , the
largest public convenience-store operator in  North America ,
slumped the most in a year after reporting fourth-quarter
earnings and sales that fell short of analyst estimates.  Couche-Tard, based in Laval,  Quebec , plunged 5 percent to
C$58.35 at 4 p.m. in Toronto. The stock has climbed 19 percent
this year, the fourth-best gain in the Standard & Poor’s/TSX
Consumer Staples index of 11 stocks.  Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were 61 cents a
share, the company said in a statement today. That fell short of
analysts’ forecasts for 78 cents a share. Sales came in at $8.78
billion, short of analysts’ estimates of $8.83 billion.  Chief Executive Officer Alain Bouchard said the results are
partly explained by “less favorable weather conditions in
several of our markets, but especially by higher expenses in
Europe.”  The company said it paid restructuring costs of about $34
million in 2013 at Statoil Fuel & Retail, the former retail arm
of the Norwegian oil giant  Statoil ASA (STL)  acquired last year.
Couche-Tard, which means “night owl” in French, said it found
about $28 million in cost-savings and synergies from the Statoil
acquisition during fiscal 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
