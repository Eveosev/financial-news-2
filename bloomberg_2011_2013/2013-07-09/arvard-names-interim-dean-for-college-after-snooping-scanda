Harvard University  named  Donald
Pfister  interim dean of its undergraduate college after former
dean Evelynn Hammonds stepped down following an e-mail snooping
scandal.  Pfister is a botany professor who also serves on the
disciplinary committee for Harvard Extension School, the
Cambridge, Massachusetts-based university said today in a
 statement  on its website. The search for a permanent successor
to Hammonds will begin later this year, according to the
statement.  Hammonds resigned from the post at the end of a five-year
term after a report that she authorized e-mail searches to find
the source of press leaks regarding the school’s response to
widespread cheating on a government course exam last year. More
than half of the 125 students implicated in the cheating
imbroglio were forced to withdraw for as long as a year, Harvard
said in February.  “I am deeply grateful to Don for agreeing to take yet
another in a long line of important roles in the Faculty of Arts
and Sciences,”  Michael Smith , dean of the faculty, which
includes most of its undergraduate teachers, said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
