West Texas Intermediate crude
advanced to a 14-month high as U.S. equities rose amid optimism
about the economy and as analysts estimated that U.S. oil
inventories fell last week.  Prices gained 0.4 percent. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
rose for a fourth day. Crude supplies probably dropped to a
four-month low, according to a Bloomberg survey before a
government report tomorrow. Egypt appointed former Finance
Minister Hazem El-Beblawi as interim premier to lead a
government that will have to oversee elections following Mohamed Mursi’s ouster. Crude moved normally through the  Suez Canal .  “Equities are giving the market a little bit of a boost,”
said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at the Price Futures
Group in  Chicago . “We are looking for another draw in
inventories. People don’t want to be short ahead of the
report.”  WTI for August delivery rose 39 cents to $103.53 a barrel
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest settlement
since May 2, 2012. The volume of all futures traded was 37
percent above the 100-day average for the time of day at 5:14
p.m. in  New York .  Prices increased to a new 14-month high in electronic
trading after the  American Petroleum Institute  was said to
report that crude inventories dropped 9 million barrels last
week, according a person familiar with the report. The industry-funded API began releasing its weekly supply statistics on a
subscription basis with today’s numbers.  API Report  Gasoline stocks dropped 3.5 million barrels, according to
the person, who asked to not be identified because the report
was not publicly distributed.  Crude jumped $1.38, or 1.3 percent, to $104.52 a barrel at
5:14 p.m. It traded at $104.05 before the report was released at
4:30 p.m. and surged as high as $104.76 after the report.  Brent for August settlement increased 38 cents, or 0.4
percent, to end the session at $107.81 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures  Europe  exchange. Volume was 3.7 percent above
the 100-day average. Brent’s premium to WTI shrank 1 cent to
$4.28, the narrowest settlement level since January 2011.  The U.S. boosted its 2013 price forecasts for both WTI and
Brent today in the Energy Information Administration’s monthly
 Short-Term Energy Outlook . WTI will average $94.65 a barrel this
year, up from a June projection of $93.25 and near the year-to-date average of $94.60. Brent will average $104.68, up 3 cents
from last month’s prediction, the EIA said.  Equities Gain  The  S&P 500  jumped 0.7 percent to 1,652.32, capping the
longest winning streak since May 15. Equities increased amid
speculation that companies will report better-than-forecast
earnings and that growth is strong enough to withstand any
reduction in the  Federal Reserve ’s $85 billion in monthly bond
purchases aimed at stimulating the economy.  Job openings climbed in May and hiring picked up as U.S.
companies grew more upbeat about the economy’s prospects for the
second half of the year, a Labor Department report showed today.  Global economic growth will be 3.1 percent this year,
unchanged from the 2012 rate, and less than the 3.3 percent
forecast in April, the  International Monetary Fund  said today.
The  IMF  reduced its 2013 projection for the U.S. to 1.7 percent
growth from 1.9 percent in April.  Economic Outlook  “The earnings season is trumping the IMF data,” said
Jason Schenker, president of Prestige Economics LLC, an Austin,
Texas-based energy consultant. “The earnings expectation is
what’s supporting” equities and oil.  The U.S., the world’s biggest oil-consuming country,
accounted for 21 percent of global oil demand last year,
according to the  International Energy Agency ’s monthly oil
market report published on June 12.  Crude stockpiles decreased 3.2 million barrels to 380.6
million in the week ended July 5, based on the median of 11
analyst estimates before a report tomorrow from the EIA, the
Energy Department’s statistical arm. That would be the lowest
level since Feb. 22.  Supplies dropped as refineries used crude to boost gasoline
output to meet demand in the peak driving season. Refineries
raised their operating rate to 92.4 percent last week, the
survey showed. That would be the highest level since Aug. 10.
Motor-fuel demand is greatest from the last weekend in May to
the Labor Day weekend in early September, the prime vacation
season in the U.S.  Egyptian Transition  Egypt’s appointment of El-Bablawi, who headed the  finance
ministry  during part of the transitional period after the 2011
removal of  Hosni Mubarak , will bolster interim President Adly Mansour as he confronts growing violence since Mursi’s July 3
eviction. That culminated in the killing yesterday of dozens of
his supporters by the army.  Nobel laureate and anti-Mursi opposition leader  Mohamed ElBaradei  was named as vice president for foreign relations, the
presidency said in a statement today.  WTI jumped 6.9 percent last week, the biggest increase
since the five days ended Feb. 25, 2011, amid concern that
unrest in Egypt will disrupt oil supplies. About 10 percent of
Middle East crude moves through the Suez Canal and the Suez-Mediterranean Pipeline, both controlled by Egypt. Prices closed
at $103.22 on July 5, the previous 14-month high.  “As long as we don’t see civil war breaking out in Egypt,
I think the geopolitical risk has already been priced in,” said
 Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut .  Suez Shipments  The majority of crude oil transiting the Suez Canal travels
northbound toward markets in the Mediterranean and  North
America . A combined 2.24 million barrels a day of oil were
shipped from the  Red Sea  to Europe and North America in 2011 via
the Suez Canal and the Suez-Mediterranean, according to the U.S.
Energy Information Administration.  About 37 vessels with 2.22 million net tonnages moved
through the Suez Canal in both directions today, compared with
55 vessels with 2.76 million tonnages on July 8 and 39 ships
with 1.95 tonnages on July 7, according to the Suez Canal
 Authority .  Prices fell as much as 0.8 percent earlier as the Dollar
Index, which measures the greenback against six other major
currencies including the euro, climbed to a three-year high. An
advancing dollar reduces oil’s appeal as an investment
alternative.  WTI’s 14-day relative strength index closed above 70 for
the third consecutive time today, data compiled by Bloomberg
showed. Some investors start selling contracts when the reading
crosses that threshold, seen as a sign that speculative buying
has driven prices unreasonably high.  ‘Elevated’ Price  “The oil price is elevated,”  said  Kyle Cooper , director
of commodities research at IAF Advisors in Houston. “Without
any additional disruptions in Egypt, prices will probably come
back down.”  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
August was 24.9 percent, up from 23.5 percent yesterday, data
compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 742,580
contracts as of 5:14 p.m. It totaled 727,118 contracts
yesterday, 13 percent above the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.79 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
