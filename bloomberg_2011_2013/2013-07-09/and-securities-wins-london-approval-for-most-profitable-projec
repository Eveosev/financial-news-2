Land Securities Plc (LAND)  won local-government approval for what could be its most profitable
development project, a  plan  to turn an  office tower  in London’s
Victoria neighborhood into 206 apartments.  Home prices  in the borough of Westminster, where the local
council voted in favor of the project yesterday, have soared in
the past year. Prices in the U.K. capital rose 10.6 percent in
the year through March 13, led by a 38.7 percent gain in
Westminster, according to an Acadametrics Ltd. study released
May 10. The average home in the borough costs 1.26 million
pounds ($1.9 million), according to the research firm.  Land Securities, the U.K.’s largest real estate investment
trust, may make more than 230 million pounds of profit by
converting the 101-meter (330-foot) Portland House tower into
homes, JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts including Harm Meijer wrote
in a June 26 note to clients. That would make it the London-based REIT’s most profitable development, they wrote.  The “vast majority” of Land Securities’ residential
development sites by value run from central  London ’s affluent
Belgravia district through Victoria to St. James’s Park, Chief
Executive Officer Rob Noel told analysts on a May 15  call .  “We control that market and it’s prime and it’s very
attractive,” Noel said. “We’re absolutely in the right
location.”  The project was approved by a vote of five to one, subject
to Land Securities providing 63 homes in the district at below-market value, and a payment of about 12.5 million pounds toward
other affordable properties.  To contact the reporter on this story:
