The European Union is filing its
first dispute with  Russia  at the  World Trade Organization  over
fees imposed on used cars and trucks that the country imports.  The EU will file a request for consultations with Russia
today in Geneva, a European official said on condition of
anonymity, as per usual diplomatic procedure. The 28-nation bloc
claims the Russian fees are discriminatory.  Fees begin at about 420 euros ($541) for small cars and
increase with the size of the vehicle. Russia has defended the
tariffs on environmental grounds, noting that more than half of
the cars now on its roads are 10 years or older and will soon be
scrapped, according to the EU official.  It is the first EU complaint against Russia since its
eastern neighbor joined the WTO in August 2012. The two sides
will have 60 days to settle their differences. If no agreement
is reached in that period, the EU can request a WTO dispute
panel to rule on its claims.  “Our colleagues from the EU warned that they intend to
send these documents to WTO,” said Russian trade official
Ekaterina Mayorova in an e-mailed statement. “We have been
expecting this development.”  The EU had expected Russian lawmakers to equalize fees
between foreign and domestic carmakers, Mayorova said. The State
Duma adjourned July 5 for its summer vacation without enacting
the legislation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
