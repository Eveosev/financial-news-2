News Corp. Chairman  Rupert Murdoch 
has been asked to return before the U.K. Parliament’s Culture,
Media and Sport Committee, after a secret recording showed him
saying that bribery of police officers was routine practice for
journalists.  A spokeswoman for the committee said it had decided today
to write to Murdoch, without offering further comment. When he
appeared before the panel in 2011, he described it as “the most
humble day of my life.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
