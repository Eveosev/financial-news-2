London Mayor  Boris Johnson ’s proposal
to build a new hub airport in the Thames estuary is only backed
by one in five of the U.K. capital’s residents, a poll found.  The expansion of Heathrow or one of the other existing
London airports has the support of 53 percent of Londoners,
while 21 percent want Johnson’s proposed new four-runway hub
airport to the east of the city, the  survey  by  YouGov Plc (YOU)  found.  The potential expansion of Heathrow, Stansted or Gatwick
aiports is currently being reviewed as part of an investigation
into U.K. airport capacity led by  Howard Davies , a former
chairman of the Financial Services Authority. Prime Minister
 David Cameron  set up the inquiry, which will delay a decision on
the expansion of Heathrow until after the 2015 general election.  A panel of House of Commons lawmakers said May 10 that
Heathrow should be expanded with the addition of a third and
even a fourth runway, while they rejected Johnson’s proposal for
a new hub airport in the Thames estuary.  YouGov questioned 1,289 adult Londoners online between July
5 and July 8. No margin of error was given.  To contact the reporter on this story:
