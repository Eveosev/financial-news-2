U.S. apartment vacancies were
unchanged in the second quarter, after three straight years of
declines, as a wave of newly built units reached the market,
according to  Reis Inc. (REIS)   The national  vacancy rate  was 4.3 percent, the same as in
the first quarter, even as demand for leasing remained strong,
the New York-based real estate research firm said in a report
today. It was the first time without a decrease in vacancies
since the beginning of 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
