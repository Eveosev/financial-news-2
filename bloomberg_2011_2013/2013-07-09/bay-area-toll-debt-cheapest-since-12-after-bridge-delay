Bonds sold to finance the  San
Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge  and other structures near the
California cities traded at their widest penalty to benchmark
municipal debt since 2012 after the opening of the $6.3 billion
east span was delayed.  Tax-exempt Bay Area Toll Authority revenue bonds maturing
in April 2028 traded yesterday for the first time since May at
an average yield of 3.84 percent, the highest since the debt was
sold in September, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The penalty
relative to AAA rated munis is 1.26 percentage points, close to
the highest since issuance, the data show.  The Oakland-based Metropolitan Transportation Commission,
announced the setback in replacing the 2.2-mile (3.5 kilometer)
eastern section yesterday as it released a report explaining the
March failure of 32 seismic anchor rods. The project will make
the structure carrying  Interstate 80  over  San Francisco  Bay more
resistant to earthquakes.  Part of the bridge collapsed in the 1989 Loma Prieta
temblor that was centered about 60 miles (97 kilometers) south
of San Francisco and registered 6.9 on the Richter scale.  The Bay Area Toll Authority, the financing agency for the
commission, had about $7.7 billion of  municipal debt  rated by
Moody’s Investors Service outstanding as of April 12, according
to the New York-based company. It gives the bonds a grade of
Aa3, fourth-highest.  Construction of the eastern span linking Yerba Buena Island
and Oakland began in 2002, with completion forecast in 2007.
Delays ensued after contractor bids exceeded cost projections,
lawmakers fought over covering the expense and parts arrived 18
months late.  The discovery of defective welds and potentially phony
inspections also slowed the work. The cost has, meanwhile, more
than doubled.  To contact the reporter on this story:
