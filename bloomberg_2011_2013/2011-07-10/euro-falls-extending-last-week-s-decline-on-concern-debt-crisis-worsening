The euro fell against the dollar,
extending last week’s biggest slide in almost a month, as
European banks face more stringent stress tests.  The euro fell to $1.4209 as of 6:05 a.m. in  Tokyo , from
$1.4265 in  New York  on July 8, when it completed a 1.8 percent
weekly drop. The 17-nation currency weakened to 114.49 yen from
115.03 at the end of last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
