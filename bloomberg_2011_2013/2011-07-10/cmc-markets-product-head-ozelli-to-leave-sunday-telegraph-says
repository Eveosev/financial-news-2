Kerem Ozelli, CMC Markets Plc’s head
of product development, intends to leave the London-based
spread-betting firm later this year, the Sunday Telegraph
reported, citing an unidentified person.  Ozelli is leaving to set up a new business in an unrelated
industry, according to the U.K. newspaper. It will be the second
high-level departure from CMC Markets within six months,
according to the Sunday Telegraph.  CMC Markets was founded in 1989 by Peter Cruddas, who was
named co-treasurer of Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s
 Conservative Party  in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
