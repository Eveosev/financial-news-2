Israel  put 35 pro-Palestinian
activists on a Deutsche Lufthansa AG flight to Frankfurt after
denying them entry and detaining them at Ben-Gurion
International Airport, an official said.  The travelers, who include citizens of Germany, Belgium and
Spain, were among 120 people who woke up in Israeli jails today
after being intercepted by security officials on their way to
attend a series of Palestinian-sponsored events, Sabine Haddad,
an Interior Ministry spokeswoman, said. The activists had
planned to reach the  West Bank .  “We hope to send the rest of them back to their home
countries by Tuesday,” she said in a telephone interview.  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said last week
that the activists were “provocateurs” who were trying to
embarrass Israel by daring authorities to arrest them.
Participants who agreed to sign a statement pledging to refrain
from violent protest activities were allowed entry, Haddad said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
