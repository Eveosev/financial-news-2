Luke Donald , the world’s top-ranked
golfer, prepared for this week’s British Open with a four-shot
win at the Scottish Open.  The Englishman had a nine-under-par round of 63 today at
the Castle Stuart Golf Links near Inverness to finish on 19-
under 197 for the tournament, which was reduced to three rounds
after rain washed out yesterday’s play.  The 33-year-old, who moved into the top spot in the
Official World Golf Ranking on May 30 after capturing the
European Tour’s British PGA Championship, finished ahead of
Fredrik Andersson Hed of Sweden in second place.  Donald, who regularly competes on the PGA Tour in the U.S.,
collects a check for 550,249 euros ($785,000) for his seventh
title on the European Tour.  Former European Ryder Cup captain Colin Montgomerie needed
a top-five finish to make the British Open but finished down the
field on 10-under par. He’s competed in every Open since 1989.  The British Open takes place July 14-17 at Royal St.
George’s in Sandwich, England.  To contact the reporter on this story:
