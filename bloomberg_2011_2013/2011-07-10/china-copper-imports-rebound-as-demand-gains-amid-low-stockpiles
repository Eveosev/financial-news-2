Copper imports by  China  rose for the
first time in three months in June as buying from overseas
became profitable and supply tightened after consumers drained
local stockpiles in the world’s largest consumer.  Inbound shipments gained 10 percent to 280,009 metric tons
compared with 254,738 tons in May, the General Administration of
Customs said on its  website  yesterday. Imports were 15 percent
lower than 328,231 tons a year ago.  Increased demand may lift prices, which gained to an almost
three-month high in London on July 8 amid supply disruptions in
 Chile  and  Indonesia . Stockpiles in  Shanghai  have fallen by half
since reaching the highest level this year in March. China’s
copper purchases accelerated in the past three to four weeks and
the market “remains relatively tight”  Diego Hernandez , chief
executive officer of Codelco, said July 7.  “Starting from late-May, we’ve seen positive arbitrage for
most of the time,” said Wang Mingyi, an analyst at Galaxy
Futures Co. “As transportation takes one to two months,
arrivals in July should be even higher.”  Arbitrage traders seek to profit from price differences
between bourses by purchasing the metal in London and selling in
Shanghai. Total imports of unwrought copper and copper products
in the first half of this year fell 24 percent from a year
earlier to 1.7 million tons, according to customs.  Inventories Plummet  Stockpiles monitored by the Shanghai Futures Exchange have
fallen to 89,498 tons from this year’s high of 177,365 tons,
according to bourse data. Copper in bonded warehouses has
dropped to 350,000 tons to 400,000 tons from a record 600,000
tons at the end of March, according to Shenzhen Rongtuo Trading
Co. The warehouses located in Shanghai’s free-trade zones are
used to store arrivals that haven’t cleared customs.  Codelco, the world’s largest copper producer, sees “strong
signs” that Chinese buyers are resuming purchases after running
down stockpiles, Hernandez said. Hedge-fund managers and other
large speculators increased their net-long position in New York
copper futures in the week ended July 5, according to U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.  Copper for delivery in three months on the  London  Metal
Exchange last week climbed to $9,789.75 a ton, the highest level
since April 12, on reports of adverse weather in Chile’s copper-
producing northern region and a strike at the Grasberg mine in
Indonesia. The metal dropped 0.4 percent to $9,627.50 by 4:38
p.m. in Shanghai.  Copper on the Shanghai Futures Exchange, which includes 17
percent value-added tax, closed 0.6 percent lower at 71,470 yuan
($11,051) a ton.  More Imports  Scrap imports in June totaled 420,000 tons, up from 400,000
tons in May, and 350,000 tons in June 2010, customs data show.
Total arrivals in the first half of this year gained 8.2 percent
from a year ago to 2.2 million tons, according to customs.  “Both the scrap and refined metal are needed in the second
half to meet demand after domestic stockpiles were depleted,”
said Ren Gang, head of research department at Maike Futures Co.  Copper recyclers in southern China were forced to cut
output of refined metal on tight scrap supply, said Tao Yonghe,
general manager of Guangdong Qingyuan Yunnan Copper Nonferrous
Metals Co., which produces refined copper from the scrap. Scrap
imports are too expensive so traders are reluctant to buy, Tao
said in an interview on June 21.  China also imported 64,491 tons of unwrought aluminum and
products in June, compared with 74,880 tons in May and 74,582
tons in June 2010, according to customs. Exports of unwrought
aluminum last month were 59,166 tons.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
