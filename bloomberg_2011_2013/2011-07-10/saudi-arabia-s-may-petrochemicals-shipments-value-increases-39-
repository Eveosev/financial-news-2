Saudi Arabia ’s petrochemicals
exports increased 39 percent by value in May from a year earlier
because of higher prices and stronger demand from  Asia .  The kingdom, the holder of the world’s largest oil
reserves, shipped petrochemicals valued at 4.80 billion riyals
($1.28 billion) in May compared with 3.45 billion riyals a year
earlier, according to data from the Department of Statistics and
Information. Exports rose 26 percent on a month-to-month basis,
the department  reported  on its website.  Petrochemicals accounted for 34 percent of Saudi Arabia’s
non-oil exports valued at 13.9 billion riyals in May. Plastics
comprised 30 percent of the total, the data showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
