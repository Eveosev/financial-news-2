Japanese and Australian stock
futures fell as the weakest U.S. jobs growth in nine months
dimmed the outlook for a global economic recovery, pushing down
the price of metals and crude oil.  American depositary receipts of  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the
world’s biggest automaker that counts  North America  as its
largest market, dropped 1.2 percent from the closing share price
in Tokyo. Those of  Kyocera Corp. (6971) , a maker of solar panels which
gets 17 percent of its revenue in America, retreated 0.9 percent.
Those of  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s largest mining company
and Australia’s No. 1 oil producer, sank 0.6 percent after oil
and metal prices dropped.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average expiring in
September closed at 10,045 in Chicago on July 8, compared with
10,160 in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at
10,040 in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on  Australia ’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index fell 0.9 today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
slid 0.2 percent in Wellington.  “Investors had high expectations for the U.S. employment
data, but they were disappointed by the result,” said Toshiyuki Kanayama, a market analyst at Tokyo-based Monex Inc. “Investors
will be looking to take some risk off the table, so there’s no
way you’re not going to see some selling.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.6 percent
today. In  New York , the index dropped 0.7 percent to 1,343.80 on
July 8 as the weakest American job growth in nine months hurt
companies most-closely tied to the economy.  Yen Rises  U.S. payrolls increased by 18,000 in June, less than the
most pessimistic forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of
economists, which called for growth of 105,000 on average. The
jobless rate rose to a 2011 high of 9.2 percent.  The yen appreciated to 80.51 against the dollar, compared
with 81.27 at the close of stock trading in Tokyo on July 8.
Against the euro,  Japan ’s currency strengthened to 114.40 from
116.55. A stronger yen reduces income at Japanese companies when
overseas revenue is converted into their home currency.  Crude oil for August delivery declined 2.5 percent to
settle at $96.20 a barrel in New York on July 8, the biggest
drop since June 23. The London Metal Exchange Index of prices
for six industrial metals including copper and aluminum dropped
1.1 percent.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index increased 0.5 percent this year
through July 8, compared with a gain of 6.9 percent by the S&P
500 and a drop of 0.8 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 13.8 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 13.5 times for the S&P 500
and 11 times for the Stoxx 600.  In  China , the inflation rate accelerated to a three-year
high of 6.4 percent in June, a level that some analysts said may
be a peak as price gains moderate in the second half.  To contact the reporters on this story:
