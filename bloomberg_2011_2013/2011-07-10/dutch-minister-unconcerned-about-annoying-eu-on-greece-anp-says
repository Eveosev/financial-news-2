Dutch Finance Minister Jan Kees de Jager said he’s willing to make himself “immensely unpopular”
within the European Union for defending the Netherlands’
interests in the Greek debt crisis, ANP reported,  De Jager said in an interview that he is using the current
mood in the Dutch parliament to justify his unwillingness to
make any concessions in Brussels regarding the Netherlands’
position on financial guarantees and loans to  Greece , ANP
reported. Irritation among EU leaders isn’t a major concern, the
finance minister told the Dutch news service.  De Jager, who supports further aid to Greece only under
strict conditions, is dependent on opposition support, ANP said.
Geert Wilders’s  Freedom Party , which agreed to support the
Cabinet as part of last year’s governing coalition accord,
opposes any more financial aid to Greece.  To contact the reporter on this story:
