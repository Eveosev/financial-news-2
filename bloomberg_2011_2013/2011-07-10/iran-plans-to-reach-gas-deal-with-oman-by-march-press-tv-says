Iran aims to reach an agreement with
Oman to export natural gas by the end of March 2012,  Press TV 
reported, citing Javad Owji, managing director of National
Iranian Gas Co.  In 2009, the countries signed an accord to jointly develop
a 200-kilometer (124-mile) underwater pipeline to transport 1
billion cubic feet of gas a day from the Iranian island of Kish
to Oman, Owji said, according to the state-run news channel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
