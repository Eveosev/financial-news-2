Sports Direct International Plc (SPD) ’s
full-time employees will receive a bonus share package valued at
44,370 pounds ($71,000) when the retailer discloses that it has
met profit targets this week, the  Sunday Times  reported.  Eligible employees can redeem a quarter of the shares in
July 2012 and the remainder in 2013, the Sunday Times reported,
without saying where it got the information. The value of the
shares was calculated based on the company’s closing share price
of 261 pence on July 8, according to the report.  Sports Direct is expected to post a profit of 205 million
million pounds for its fiscal year, the Sunday Times reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
