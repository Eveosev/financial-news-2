Chelsea owner  Roman Abramovich  is
ready to bankroll moves for Manchester City striker Carlos Tevez
and Tottenham midfielder Luka Modric, the  Sunday Express
reported .  The Blues may have to spend up to 80 million pounds ($128.5
million) to land the pair from their Premier League soccer
rivals, the newspaper said.  New manager Andre Villas-Boas will be given “whatever it
takes” to sign the players he wants, the Express reported,
citing unnamed sources close to Abramovich.  City will want up to 50 million pounds for Tevez, who
originally requested a move to be closer to his daughters in
 Argentina , the newspaper added. A second bid of about 30 million
pounds is set to be made for Modric, the Express said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
