British Airways Plc pension-plan
trustees face increasing pressure to reverse a decision that
will reduce payments, the Sunday Telegraph reported, citing two
trustees who resigned over the matter.  As many as 2,000 BA pension-plan members, including retired
pilots and engineers, will confront trustees at Ascot Racecourse
tomorrow, the U.K. newspaper reported. Trustees decided to link
payments to a measure of inflation that is typically lower than
the current index, which may reduce them by as much as 20
percent, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
