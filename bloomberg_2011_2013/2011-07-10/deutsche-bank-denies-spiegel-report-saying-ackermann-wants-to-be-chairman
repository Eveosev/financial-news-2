Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , Germany’s biggest
bank, denied a  Der Spiegel  report that Chief Executive Officer
 Josef Ackermann  told management board members at a recent
meeting that he wants to become chairman.  “Deutsche Bank’s chief executive officer didn’t announce
his desire to become the head of the supervisory board at the
last management board meeting,” spokesman Michael Lermer said
in an e-mailed statement. “In fact, he clarified that his known
position toward a move to the supervisory board hasn’t
changed.”  Ackermann has previously said he doesn’t want to join the
supervisory board.  Der Spiegel reported in a pre-released  article  on its
website that he promoted the idea of becoming chairman at a
meeting with executives because international investors are
calling for him to stay on board. Most management board members
supported the proposal, the German magazine said in the story,
which didn’t say where the magazine got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
