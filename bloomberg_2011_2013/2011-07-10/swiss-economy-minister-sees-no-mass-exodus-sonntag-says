Swiss Economy Minister Johann
Schneider-Ammann doesn’t expect a “mass exodus” of companies,
even though some may move abroad because of the euro’s weakness
against the Swiss franc, Sonntag reported.  The government has a team studying possible scenarios and
measures that may be implemented to respond to the weak euro,
though it has no “wonder weapons,” Schneider-Ammann said in an
interview posted on the  newspaper’s website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
