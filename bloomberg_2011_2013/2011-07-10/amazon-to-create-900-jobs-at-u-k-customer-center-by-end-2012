Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) , the world’s largest
online retailer, plans to open its seventh logistics center in
the U.K., creating more than 900 jobs by the end of 2012.  The company will hire permanent and temporary workers at
the 700,000 square-foot site in Rugeley,  England , according to a
statement released today. The Rugeley site, north of Birmingham,
will handle global orders, Seattle-based Amazon said.  “We have a busy Christmas coming up and look forward to
assembling a team of talented people,” Arthur Valdez, vice
president of operations in the U.K., said in the statement.  Amazon already planned to add hundreds of jobs this year at
a customer fulfillment site in Dunfermline,  Scotland , and a
service center in Edinburgh. Employees from an existing site in
Glenrothes, Scotland, will move to Dunfermline after it opens,
spokesman Ben Howes said by mobile phone. Amazon has one other
logistics center in Scotland, three in England and one in Wales.  Ocado Group Plc, the U.K.’s biggest independent online
grocer, is also investing in distribution as sales rise.  To contact the reporter on this story:
