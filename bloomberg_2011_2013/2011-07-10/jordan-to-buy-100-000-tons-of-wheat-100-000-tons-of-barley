Jordan invited offers to buy 100,000
metric tons of wheat and reissued a tender for 100,000 tons of
barley, the Ministry of Industry and Trade said.  The ministry will accept bids for wheat until July 20,
Mohamad Malahmeh, head of the Ministry’s tenders department,
said by telephone today. Receiving bids from suppliers of barley
will close July 27.  “We are reissuing the tender for the 100,000 tons of
barley because the prices offered were too high,” he said. The
original tenders were issued June 20 and closed July 7.  Jordan bought 150,000 metric tons of wheat, including
50,000 tons from  Russia  at $289.90 a ton, Malahmeh said July 7.
The remaining quantity was bought at between $289.90 a ton and
$290.90 a ton from origins including the U.S., the European
Union,  Canada , Ukraine and  Argentina , he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
