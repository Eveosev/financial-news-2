Gulshan Bhatia may seek to regain
control of London’s Waldorf hotel, which the U.K. businesswoman
first purchased in 2007, the  Sunday Times  reported, without
saying where it got the information.  The hotel was put into administration two months ago, the
Sunday Times said. Bhatia has lined up financing to repay
 Barclays Plc (BARC) ,  Allied Irish Banks Plc (ALBK)  and  Credit Agricole SA (ACA) , the
banks that financed the original purchase, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
