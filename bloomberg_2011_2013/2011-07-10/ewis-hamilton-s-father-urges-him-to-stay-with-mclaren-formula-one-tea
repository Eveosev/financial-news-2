Lewis Hamilton ’s father today urged
him to stay with the McLaren Formula One team, amid speculation
the 26-year-old may be tempted to switch.  Hamilton, the 2008 series champion, has come under
criticism for his driving style after crashes with rivals, and
has been frustrated at his team’s lack of competitiveness with
the championship-leading Red Bull team. Yesterday, he criticized
McLaren over tire selection after he qualified only 10th for
today’s British Grand Prix at Silverstone.  Anthony Hamilton, who has guided his son’s career and was
formerly his manager, said it would be better in the long term
for Lewis to stay loyal to McLaren, whose former team boss Ron
Dennis had backed Lewis at an early age.  “It’s just something is missing and they’ll find it,”
Anthony Hamilton told the BBC Radio Five Live’s Sportsweek
program. “My advice to Lewis would be to stay at McLaren.
They’re going through a little bit of turmoil like you do in any
relationship. But it is going to be a happy marriage, I believe,
if he stays.”  Lewis Hamilton was linked with a move to  Red Bull  earlier
this season when he went to see the rival team’s Principal
Christian Horner at the Canadian Grand Prix in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
