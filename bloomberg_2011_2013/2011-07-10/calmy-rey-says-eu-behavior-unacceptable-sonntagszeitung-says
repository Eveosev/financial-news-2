Swiss President Micheline Calmy-Rey
said the European Union’s focus on tax issues in negotiations
between the two sides is “unacceptable,” SonntagsZeitung
reported.  Negotiators should also be talking about providing Swiss
companies with better access to the EU markets, Calmy-Rey said
in an interview with the Swiss  newspaper . Breaking off the
negotiations is “not a solution,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
