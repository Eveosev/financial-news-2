Dominique Strauss-Kahn , favored to
be the Socialist Party candidate in next year’s French
presidential elections before he was charged with assaulting a
hotel maid in New York, is now a “handicap” for his party, a
poll for the newspaper  Liberation  showed today.  Seventy-one percent of respondents overall and of those who
support the Socialists said Strauss-Khan’s image was detrimental
to the party, with news of his legal problems distracting from
the party nomination process, the survey found.  President  Nicolas Sarkozy  gained in popularity, with 34
percent saying they had a positive opinion of him, up from 30
percent in June. Socialist candidate  Francois Hollande  had the
highest positive ratings at 58 percent. Forty-one percent said
they would like to see him become president, and 52 percent said
he had the best chance to beat Sarkozy.  Strauss-Khan, who resigned as head of the  International
Monetary Fund  after the allegations, has pleaded not guilty. His
next court appearance is scheduled for July 18.  The poll was conducted by Viavoice for Liberation, and will
appear in tomorrow’s edition of the newspaper. Viavoice
questioned 1,007 people by telephone July 7 and July 8. For
questions with at least 1,000 respondents, the poll had a margin
of error of 1.8 to 3.1 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
