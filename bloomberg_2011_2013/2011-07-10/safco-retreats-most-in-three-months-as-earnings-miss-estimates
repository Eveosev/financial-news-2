Saudi Arabian Fertilizer Co. fell
the most in almost three months after second-quarter earnings
retreated 13 percent, missing analysts’ estimates.  The shares fell as much as 3.5 percent, the most since
April 13, to 182 riyals before trading at 184.75 riyals at 11:05
a.m. in Riyadh.  Net income fell to 790 million riyals ($211 million) from
907 million riyals a year ago, the Jubail-based company known as
 Safco (SAFCO)  said today. The mean estimate of four analysts was for a
profit of 987 million riyals, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Safco is a unit of  Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC) , the
world’s biggest petrochemicals maker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
