French President  Nicolas Sarkozy 
will revisit the issue of “exorbitant” executive pay because
companies haven’t heeded government warnings to rein in
salaries, Budget Minister Valerie Pecresse said, according to an
interview published in the  Journal du Dimanche  today.  Pecresse also said she will forward on a Finance Ministry
report on the cost of tax loopholes and shelters to the
Parliament and publish it by the end of the month, the newspaper
said.  The policy of replacing one of every two retiring civil
servants will cut 250 million euros ($357 million) from the 2012
government payroll, she said according to the newspaper.  The newspaper also quoted Pecresse as saying there need to
be “new ideas” to regulate rating companies, saying they were
too hasty in judging  Portugal ’s recovery plans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
