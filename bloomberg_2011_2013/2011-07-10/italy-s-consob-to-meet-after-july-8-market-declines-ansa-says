Italy’s financial-market regulator
will meet tonight to discuss irregularities and decide on
possible intervention after stocks and bonds fell last week,
Ansa reported, without saying where it got the information.  Commissioners at Consob may discuss measures including a
ban on naked short-selling in line with those in other European
countries, the Italian news service said.  Shares of the country’s biggest banks fell to the lowest in
more than two years on July 8, and  government bonds  dropped,
driving 10-year yields to a nine-year high.  To contact the reporter on this story:
