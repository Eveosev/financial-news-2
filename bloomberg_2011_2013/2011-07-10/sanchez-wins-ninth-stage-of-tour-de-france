Luis Leon Sanchez won the ninth
stage of cycling’s Tour de  France  as Thomas Voeckler took the
race lead after a second-place finish yesterday.  Thor Hushovd had held the leader’s yellow jersey for a week
before the crash-filled 208-kilometer (129-mile) trip from
Issoire to Saint-Flour.  France’s Voeckler of the Europcar team leads the overall
competition by 1 minute, 49 seconds from Sanchez of Spain. Two-
time runnerup  Cadel Evans  of Australia is third, 37 seconds
further back.  Alexander Vinokourov abandoned the race after crashing
halfway through the stage, and Jurgen van den Broeck, Frederik
Willems and David Zabriskie also exited the competition after
taking tumbles. Juan Antonio Flecha and Johnny Hoogerland
managed to stay in the race after a collision with an overtaking
television vehicle.  Voeckler was part of a five-man breakaway involved in the
incident, though avoided getting caught up in it. He was
outpaced by Sanchez at the finish, Sandy Casar coming third.  Among the race favorites,  Andy Schleck  is 11 seconds behind
Evans, with  Alberto Contador , seeking a third win in four years,
a minute and a half further back.  There is a rest day today, followed by a 158-kilometer
stage from Aurillac to Carmaux on July 12 as the race heads
toward the Pyrenees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
