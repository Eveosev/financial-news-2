French President  Nicolas Sarkozy 
would get enough votes in the first round of an election against
any of the three leading Socialist Party candidates to force a
second round, a poll by Yahoo! Inc. today said.  Francois Hollande would do best against Sarkozy, garnering
29 percent to Sarkozy’s 21 percent. Should  Martine Aubry  be
nominated, she’d receive 26 percent to Sarkozy’s 21.5 percent.
Only against Segolene Royal, his opponent in the 2006 election,
would Sarkozy lead the first round with Front National leader
Marine Le Pen advancing with him. Royal would come in third with
13.5 percent to Sarkozy’s 23 percent and Le Pen’s 15 percent.  Sarkozy would lose to either Hollande or Aubry in the
second round, the poll found. Should a Socialist win the
election and former party favorite Dominique Strauss-Kahn be
cleared of charges including attempted rape in  New York , 35
percent of respondents said they would like him to be named
prime minister.  The poll was conducted by Yahoo on behalf of Paris-based
opinion researcher LH2 on July 8 and July 9, with 957 adults by
telephone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
