Oil declined for a second day in  New
York  as investors bet that a slump in Chinese imports and rising
unemployment in the U.S. indicated that fuel demand may falter
in the world’s biggest crude-consuming nations.  Futures slipped as much as 0.9 percent after China’s net
oil imports shrank 10 percent in June to the lowest in eight
months, according to Bloomberg calculations based on General
Administration of Customs data released yesterday. Prices also
dropped after the Labor Department said on July 8 that employers
added the fewest workers in nine months and the  unemployment
rate  unexpectedly rose to the highest this year.  “The one thing that’s going to restrain the demand
recovery is this very high unemployment rate,” said  Ben Westmore , a minerals and energy economist at National Australia
Bank Ltd. in Melbourne, who predicts oil in New York will
average $113 a barrel in the third quarter. “It dims the
outlook on the second half of the year for demand.”  Crude for August delivery fell as much as 90 cents to
$95.30 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , and was at $95.44 at 1:08 p.m. Singapore time. The
contract dropped $2.47, or 2.5 percent, to $96.20 on July 8.
Prices are 28 percent higher the past year.  Brent oil for August settlement decreased 87 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $117.46 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The European benchmark contract was at a
premium of $22.06 to U.S. futures. The difference reached a
record $22.29 on June 15.  50-Day Average  Oil prices  may extend declines in New York after failing to
breach the 50-day moving average last week, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “Strength above the 50-day moving average of $98.80 should
send the bulls towards our $101.20 inflection high,”  Stephen
Schork , president of the Schork Group Inc. energy advisory
company in Villanova,  Pennsylvania  said in a daily report e-
mailed today. “All eyes will be on Thursday’s retail sales.”  A report this week may show sales at U.S. retailers
stagnated in June. Commerce Department data on July 14 may
indicate an unchanged reading in purchases after a 0.2 percent
May decrease, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg
News survey. U.S. payrolls increased by 18,000 in June, the
Labor Department data showed July 8. The median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey called for a gain of 105,000.  China  Imports  China imported 19.7 million tons and exported 270,000 tons
of crude, customs data showed. Net imports of fuel, including
gasoline and diesel, rose to 1.36 million tons last month from
930,000 tons in May, according to the data. Net purchases
reached a 29-month high of 2.07 million tons in December, the
data show.  Some refineries in China, including PetroChina Co.’s
largest facility at Dalian in the northeast, shut for routine
maintenance in June, leading to a decline in demand for crude.
About 600,000 barrels a day of capacity were taken offline last
month, Brynjar Eirik Bustnes, a Hong Kong-based analyst at
JPMorgan Chase & Co., said yesterday.  Net-long bets on crude gained by 12,343 futures and options
combined, or 8.1 percent, to 165,491, in the seven days ended
July 5, according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s
Commitments of Traders report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
