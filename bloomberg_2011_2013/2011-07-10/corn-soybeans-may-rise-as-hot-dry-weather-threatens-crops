Corn may gain for the second
straight week and soybeans may rise on concern that hot, dry
weather in July and August will reduce U.S. Midwest crop yields.  Eighteen of 32 traders and analysts surveyed from  Tokyo  to
Chicago on July 8 forecast that corn will rise, and 18 of 33
respondents said soybeans will gain for a third consecutive
week.  On the Chicago Board of Trade last week, corn futures for
December delivery rose 6.7 percent to $6.37 a bushel, snapping a
six-week decline, and soybean futures for November delivery
climbed 2.6 percent to $13.465 a bushel.  The gain in corn and soybeans last week was expected by the
majority of analysts and traders surveyed on July 1.  Bullish on corn: 18    Bullish on soybeans: 18
Bearish on corn: 14    Bearish on soybeans: 15  To contact the reporter on this story:
