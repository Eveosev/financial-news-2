International Atomic Energy Agency
Director General Yukiya Amano will meet with Iranian Foreign
Minister Ali Akbar Salehi on July 12 to discuss  Iran’s nuclear
program , state-run  Mehr  news reported, citing Iran’s IAEA envoy.  The meeting will take place in Vienna, the  news agency 
reported yesterday, citing Ali Asghar Soltanieh. Iran is in a
deadlock over its nuclear program, which the U.S. and its allies
believe is cover for the development of atomic weapons. The
Persian Gulf country rejects the allegation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
