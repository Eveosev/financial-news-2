Tokyo  Electric Power Co. reported
cooling operations at its crippled Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear
plant were proceeding without interruption after a magnitude 7.0
earthquake struck the region today.  The utility, known as Tepco, is assessing the impact of the
temblor at the plant and its other facilities in the region,
Satoshi Watanabe, a spokesman, said by phone.  Tsunami advisories, which indicate the possibility of
surges up to 50 centimeters (20 inches), were issued for  Japan â€™s
Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima prefectures by the  Japan
Meteorological Agency  after the quake, which measured as strong
as four on the Japanese intensity scale of one to seven.  Coastal communities in the three prefectures were
devastated on March 11 by a magnitude-9 quake and tsunami that
left more than 24,000 dead or missing.  Tohoku Electric Power Co. reported its facilities in the
region were undamaged, including the shut-down nuclear plants at
Onagawa and Higashidori, spokesman Seiichi Kato said by phone.  The  U.S. Geological Survey  reported the temblor struck at
10 a.m. local time, and revised data showed it hit 35 kilometers
(22 miles) deep offshore 409 kilometers northeast of Tokyo.  To contact the reporters on this story:
