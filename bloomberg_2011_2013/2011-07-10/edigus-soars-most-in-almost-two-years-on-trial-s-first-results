Medigus Ltd. (MDGS)  soared the most in
almost two years after saying it received the preliminary
results of the final clinical trial of its endoscopy system for
the treatment of gastro-esophageal reflux disease.  Medigus gained 19 percent to 0.97 shekel at 2:16 p.m. in
 Tel Aviv , the most since Aug. 3, 2009. The company hopes to
request U.S. Food & Drug Administration approval after analyzing
the results of the trial, according to a statement to the Tel
Aviv Stock Exchange today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
