South Korea , the world’s third-
biggest corn buyer, plans to secure more farmland overseas to
grow crops such as corn and wheat and secure a stable supply
amid surging food prices.  The North Asian nation wants to secure a total of 380,000
hectares of overseas farmland by 2018, the agriculture ministry
said in an e-mailed statement today, without giving a
comparative figure. That area can produce about 1.38 million
tons of corn, wheat and soybeans, or about 10 percent of the
nation’s annual imports of the three major crops, it said.  South Korea, which relies on imports for almost all its
corn and wheat while fully self-sufficient in rice, is seeking
to boost supplies as surging global food costs fuel inflation.
Corn futures prices have jumped 63 percent in  Chicago  in the
past year, while soybeans climbed 42 percent and wheat gained 22
percent.  The government will help the nation’s companies lease
arable land or buy stakes in overseas firms, the statement said.
It will prioritize countries such as the Philippines, Cambodia,
Ukraine,  Indonesia  and  Russia  for potential investments, it said.  South Korea also plans to expand its overseas grain trading
business into countries including Brazil, Russia and Ukraine
after a U.S. venture was set up earlier this year, the statement
said. State-run Korea Agro-Fisheries Trade Corp. in April
started a grain-trading venture in Chicago to help secure
supplies, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
