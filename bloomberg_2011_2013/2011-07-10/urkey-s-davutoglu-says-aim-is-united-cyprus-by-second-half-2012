Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said he wants an agreement on Cyprus by the end of
this year, leading to a referendum on the divided island early
next year and a united Cyprus by the second half of 2012,
 Hurriyet  newspaper reported.  The referendum should be held in the first few months of
2012 and a united Cyprus should take over the rotating
presidency of the European Union in the second half of the year,
the newspaper cited Davutoglu as saying.  Davutoglu said Turkey wants European support to help
persuade the Greek-led administration, which represents the
entire island in the EU, to back a unification plan, Hurriyet
said. He spoke after meeting officials in the Turkish-led north
of the island, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
