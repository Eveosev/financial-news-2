European Union regulators are
preparing to tell German states that their draft gambling rules
would violate EU rules and can’t be adopted as planned, Die Welt
reported, citing unidentified people at the EU.  The draft rules, intended to take effect at the beginning
of 2012, would limit the number of licenses for private sports
betting operators to seven and would impose an additional 16.66
percent sales tax. Both issues are problematic, the EU is
preparing to tell the states in a letter, according to the
preview of a story to be published in tomorrow’s newspaper.  -- Editors: Willy Morris, Jonas Bergman  To contact the reporter on this story:
