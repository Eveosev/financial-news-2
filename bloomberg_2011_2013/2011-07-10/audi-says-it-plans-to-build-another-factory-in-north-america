Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Audi unit plans to
build another plant in  North America , a company spokesman said,
confirming a report by  Automotive News Europe .  “The plan is as good as certain,” Audi spokesman Juergen
de Graeve said in an interview today.  Audi’s supervisory and management board still need to
approve the project and that decision will come “considerably
before 2015,” de Graeve said. He declined to provide further
details.  The carmaker may build an engine and transmission plant
which could be shared with the VW brand, Automotive News
reported, citing an unidentified person at Audi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
