European Union President  Herman Van Rompuy  called for an end to the “oligopoly” of credit-rating
companies, according to an interview in  El Pais  newspaper.  The EU already has taken measures and more needs to be done
in  Europe  and globally, the Madrid-based newspaper cited him as
saying. Measures being adopted by  Spain  are the best barrier
against contagion, the newspaper also cited him as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
