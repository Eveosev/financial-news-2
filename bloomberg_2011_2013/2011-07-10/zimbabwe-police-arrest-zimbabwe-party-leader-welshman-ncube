Welshman Ncube, leader of a splinter
movement of  Zimbabwe ’s Movement for Democratic Change, was
briefly detained with about 20 other party officials late
yesterday.  Ncube, who is one of three party leaders in the ruling
alliance, was returning from a meeting in the resort town of
Victoria Falls, the party said on its website. Police later
released the officials, who included Moses Mzila Ndlovu, a
cabinet minister.  “Our understanding is that they were held under the Public
Order and Security Act for allegedly holding an illegal meeting
and were arrested at a police roadblock,” MDC spokesman
Kurauone Chihwayi said in a telephone interview from the
capital, Harare today.  Zimbabwe’s state-controlled  Herald  said the MDC officials
hadn’t been arrested. The newspaper quoted Matabeleland North’s
most senior policeman, Edmore Veterai, as saying the officials
were asked what they were doing for their own security.  To contact the reporter on this story:
