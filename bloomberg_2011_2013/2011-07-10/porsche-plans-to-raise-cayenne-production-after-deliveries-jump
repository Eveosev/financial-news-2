Porsche AG will boost production of
the Cayenne sport-utility vehicle next year after surging
deliveries of the sports-car maker’s best-selling model spurred
a 37 percent sales gain in the first half.  Cayenne output will increase by 10 percent to 20 percent
starting in 2012, Bernhard Maier, Porsche’s sales chief, said in
an interview. Demand for the vehicle, which starts at $48,200,
caused delivery times to peak to as high as 12 months in markets
such as  China . Porsche wants waiting time to be no longer than
six months.  “We’re now looking into ways we can expand production
capacity to be able to serve our customers more quickly,” Maier
said at the Stuttgart, Germany-based automaker’s headquarters.
“First-half data show that we’re growing almost consistently in
all world markets and across all model lines.”  Porsche SE, which jointly owns the sports-car maker with
 Volkswagen AG (VOW) , plans to merge with the Wolfsburg, Germany-based
manufacturer. Backed by VW’s resources, the maker of the 911
aims to double sales to about 200,000 vehicles by 2018 by adding
a compact SUV and increasing sales in emerging markets. Porsche
should boost deliveries to more than 100,000 this year from
97,000 in 2010, Maier said.  Porsche, which also makes the $75,200 Panamera four-door
coupe, increased sales 29 percent to 10,670 models last month,
leading to sales of 60,650 units through June, Maier said. Six-
month orders rose 26 percent to 65,660. There was a 12 percent
decline in June orders to 10,450, because year-earlier bookings
were inflated by a revamped version of the Cayenne.  Second-Half Slowdown  The carmaker plans to release complete first-half sales
data on July 12, according to company spokesman Dirk Erat.  Panamera sales may rise to more than 28,000 units this
year, compared with more than 20,000 in the first year after the
model came to market in September 2009, Maier said.  Overall sales growth will slow in the coming months after
record deliveries in the second half of 2010. The forthcoming
overhaul of the 911 may also hamper sales, he said.  Prospects in the U.S., the company’s biggest market, are
“very positive,” said Maier, a former executive at Bayerische
Motoren Werke AG who took charge of Porsche’s sales operations
in April 2010. Its U.S. sales rose 42 percent, to 15,542
vehicles through the first six months of 2011, after a 19
percent June gain.  “The U.S. market is still characterized by a degree of
volatility that shouldn’t be underestimated,” Maier said in the
July 6 interview. “In the coming years, growth is conceivable
in the U.S. to help return to levels seen before the crisis.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
