Economic growth in emerging markets
slowed to its weakest level in two years in the second quarter
because of the fragile global economy, the Japanese tsunami and
the impact of inflation, according to  HSBC Holdings Plc. (HSBA)   The SABB HSBC Emerging Markets Index, a quarterly economic
gauge developed and published in Saudi Arabia by HSBC and the
 Saudi British Bank (SABB) , dipped to 54.2 from 55 in the first quarter
and dropped below the long-run series average of 54.8, Riyadh-
based Saudi British Bank said in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
