Italy was the victim of “irrational
speculation” in the financial markets last week, German Deputy
Foreign Minister Werner Hoyer told La Stampa, saying the country
can balance the budget by 2014 and its banks are sound.  Italy “approved an adjustment plan which will now be
debated in parliament,” Hoyer said in an interview with the
Turin-based newspaper.  Finance Minister  Giulio Tremonti  “wants to have a balanced
budget in 2014, an ambitious but fair goal,” Hoyer told La
Stampa. “For this reason, I can’t see any excuse for irrational
speculation of any kind.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
