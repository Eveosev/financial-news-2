     July 10 (Bloomberg)-- Three people were killed in a bomb
blast at a church near Abuja,  Nigeria ’s capital, police said.  The explosion occurred at All Christian Church in Suleja,
in Niger state, which borders the Federal Capital Territory,
Richard Oguche, police spokesman for the state, said by
telephone today. Investigations are continuing, he said.  Authorities in northern Nigeria have blamed a radical
Islamic sect known as Boko Haram for bomb attacks and killings
of government officials and security forces since last year.  The group, which draws inspiration from  Afghanistan ’s
Taliban movement, claimed responsibility for a blast on June 16
at Nigeria’s police headquarters in Abuja that killed at least
five people and injured 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
