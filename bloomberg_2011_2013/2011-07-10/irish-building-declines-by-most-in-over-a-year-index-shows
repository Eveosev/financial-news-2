Ireland’s building industry
contracted in June at the fastest pace in more than a year as a
housing slump persisted, according to an index.  An index of construction fell to 40.5 in June from 41.1 in
May, the steepest decline since May 2010,  Ulster Bank  Ltd. said
today in a report presenting its gauge. A reading below 50
indicates contraction.  House prices , which quadrupled in the decade through 2007,
have plunged about 40 percent as the economy shrank and banks
tightened lending criteria amid the worst recession in Ireland’s
modern history. Ireland has about 2,800 unfinished developments,
or so-called “ghost estates,” according to the government.  “As we look to the second half of the year, near-term
prospects for the sector as a whole don’t look too bright,”
Simon Barry, chief economist at Ulster Bank in Dublin, said in
the report. “Activity levels have now fallen in every month
since June of 2007, meaning that the construction slump has now
entered its fifth year.”  The measure of residential construction rose to 41 in June
from 37.6 in May, while commercial building climbed to 42.3 from
41.9. The index for civil engineering fell to 32.8 from 37.4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
