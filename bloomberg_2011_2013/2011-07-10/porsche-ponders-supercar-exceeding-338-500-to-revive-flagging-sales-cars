Porsche AG may develop a supercar
positioned higher than the 911 GT2 RS to broaden its line-up and
sustain growth as orders cool from record deliveries last year.  The car could be combined with additional variants of the
Cayman and Boxster as well as extended-wheelbase and convertible
versions of the Panamera four-door coupe, Bernhard Maier,
Porsche’s sales chief, said in an interview. It would aim to
fill the gap between the 237,600-euro ($338,500) GT2 RS, the top
end of the 911 line, and the 768,000-euro 918 Spyder hybrid.  “We’re currently examining what options can be derived
from this” hole in the product range, Maier said at the
manufacturer’s headquarters in Stuttgart,  Germany . “There
already are initial ideas that look very promising on paper.”  Porsche SE, which jointly owns the sports-car maker with
 Volkswagen AG (VOW) , plans to merge with the Wolfsburg, Germany-based
manufacturer. The combination will bolster VW’s luxury line that
already includes Audi, Lamborghini, Bentley and Bugatti as it
aims to topple Toyota Motor Corp. and General Motors Co. to be
the world’s largest carmaker by 2018. VW’s stock has more than
doubled since agreeing to the deal in August 2009.  Backed by VW, Porsche aims to double sales to about 200,000
vehicles by 2018 with the introduction of new models and
expansion in emerging markets. Porsche should boost deliveries
to more than 100,000 this year from 97,000 in 2010, Maier said.  Order Drop  The planned product expansion comes as growth slows from a
record pace for the past year. Orders fell 12 percent to 10,450
vehicles in June, as year-earlier bookings were inflated by a
revamped version of the Cayenne sport-utility vehicle. That cut
order growth this year to 26 percent. June sales rose 29 percent
to 10,670 autos, holding the first-half gain to 37 percent.  Sales increases “will turn out to be lower in the second
half of the year,” said Maier, a former executive at  Bayerische
Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  who took charge of Porsche’s sales operations
in April 2010. To sustain growth, Porsche plans to adjust model
rollouts to have at least one new product coming to the market a
year, he said.  The highlight in 2011 will be the seventh generation of the
911, which will debut at the Frankfurt motor show in September.
The revamped sports car will have sharper contours, more comfort
and better performance than the current model, Maier said. The
company will expand its range by introducing a compact sport-
utility vehicle in 2013.  Cayenne Queues  Porsche has struggled to meet demand for the Cayenne, the
brand’s sole SUV currently. Demand for the vehicle, which starts
at $48,200, caused delivery times to peak to as high as 12
months in markets such as  China . To lower this to less than six
months, it will increase production by between 10 percent and 20
percent from 2012, Maier said.  The automaker was emboldened to pursue a new supercar after
selling out all 500 units of the GT2 RS within two months of the
620-horsepower model’s premiere in Moscow in August 2010. The
car surges to 100 kilometers (62 miles) per hour in 3.5 seconds.
The 918 Spyder, also a limited series, will come to market in
2013. The super hybrid has a top speed of 320 kilometers per
hour and is equipped with a 500-horsepower V8 engine and
electric motors.  ‘Creative Mathematics’  “I’m not convinced this is the right course for Porsche,”
said  Stefan Bratzel , director of the Center of Automotive
Management at the University of Applied Sciences in Bergisch-
Gladbach, Germany. “Development costs for such showcase
vehicles are huge. It requires some very creative mathematics to
make a plausible business case for such a car.”  Porsche, which says it doesn’t have a timeframe for making
a decision on the new car, disagrees.  “It makes fundamental economic sense to serve demand that
exists in the marketplace in a wise way,” said Maier. “Between
the top 911 model and the 918 Spyder, there’s a price range that
we’re not serving, but where other manufacturers are selling one
or another product.”  Supercars have taken on an added value for luxury-car
makers as competition tightens.  Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Mercedes-Benz is
introducing the SLS roadster this fall and plans an electric
version of the gull-wing sports car. BMW is developing the i8, a
hybrid supercar that will be part of its new “i” electric-car
sub-brand.  “Supercars have great symbolic value,” said Bratzel.
“They polish the main brand, but I’m not sure an icon brand
like Porsche still needs that benefit.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
