The British Broadcasting Corp. plans
to cut a further 3,000 jobs over the next five years to lower
costs, the  Sunday Times  reported, without saying where it got
the information.  These reductions would be from the broadcasterâ€™s permanent
workforce of 17,000, the report said. The  BBC  previously
announced job cuts in January this year and in 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
