Emerging-markets stocks are likely
to rise less than previously forecast this year as weaker
sentiment means that developing-nation equities may be unable to
achieve a “clear valuation premium,” Citigroup Inc. said.  The brokerage cut its end-2011 forecast for the MSCI
Emerging Markets Index to 1,400, compared with an earlier
estimate of 1,500 and the July 8 close of 1,163.93, analysts led
by New York-based Geoffrey Dennis wrote in a July 8 report. They
reiterated their “bullish” stance on developing-nation shares.  Citigroup also cut its rating on Brazilian stocks to
“neutral” and lowered  Poland  to “underweight,” according to
the report. The brokerage raised Indonesia, Thailand and  Turkey 
to “neutral.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
