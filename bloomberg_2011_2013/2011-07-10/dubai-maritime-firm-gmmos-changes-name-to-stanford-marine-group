GMMOS Group, a Dubai-based service
provider to oil and gas companies, changed its name to Stanford
Marine Group to reflect its focus on offshore supply vessels.  The company has two divisions, Stanford Marine, which
charters vessels, and Grandweld, which builds and repairs ships,
it said in an e-mailed statement today. Stanford Marine will be
adding four vessels to its fleet between now and the end of the
year, while Grandweld recently secured three shipbuilding
contracts that increased its order backlog to $250 million,
according to the statement.  The company is 51 percent owned by Dubai-based Abraaj
Capital Ltd, while Abu Dhabi-listed  Waha Capital PJSC (WAHA)  holds the
remainder.  To contact the reporters on this story:
