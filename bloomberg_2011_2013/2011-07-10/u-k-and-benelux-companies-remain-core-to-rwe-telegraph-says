Britain remains “a core market”
for  RWE AG (RWE) , the Sunday Telegraph reported, citing Volker Beckers, chief executive officer of the Essen-based power
company’s U.K. unit, Npower Plc.  “We’re making a lot of investments which will go live in
the next few months,” Beckers told the U.K. newspaper. “There
are still commitments and no wobbling as far as the U.K. market
is concerned.”  RWE,  Germany ’s second-largest utility, is working with
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  as it considers a sale of Npower, a
person familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News on July 4.
The company is seeking to raise as much as 8 billion euros
($11.4 billion) through asset sales by 2013 to cut debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
