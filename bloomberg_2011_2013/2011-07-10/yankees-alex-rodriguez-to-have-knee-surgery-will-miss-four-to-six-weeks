Alex Rodriguez  of the  New York
Yankees  will probably be out four to six weeks after having
surgery today to repair torn cartilage in his right knee.  Rodriguez, 35, has been playing with pain since suffering
the injury on June 19 in Chicago. Tests revealed a slight
meniscus tear three days ago and the All-Star third baseman
opted for surgery after getting a second opinion from a doctor
yesterday in Miami, the Yankees said.  The American League’s three-time Most Valuable Player will
have the procedure in Miami and may be able to return in mid-
August. The Yankees are scheduled to finish the regular season
on Sept. 28 and 11 of their final 27 games are against the
 Boston Red Sox  or Tampa Bay Rays.  New York trails first-place Boston by one game in the
American League Eastern Division and is five games ahead of
Tampa Bay at Major League Baseball’s All-Star break.  “There are a very few people that can put up the numbers
that Alex does,” Yankees manager Joe Girardi said before
yesterday’s 1-0 win over the Rays. “You just have to
collectively find a way to get it done without him.”  Rodriguez is hitting .295 with 13 home runs and 52 runs
batted in for the Yankees this season. He’s gone 85 at-bats
since his last home run on June 11, the longest single-season
drought of his career, MLB.com said.  Eduardo Nunez  may fill in at third base in Rodriguez’s
absence. Nunez, 24, hit .339 while starting 17 games at
shortstop while  Derek Jeter  was on the disabled list.  To contact the reporter on this story:
