Swiss National Bank  President
Philipp Hildebrand said he sees “no need for action” to curb
the strength of the Swiss franc and that  price stability  is at
present “guaranteed,” SonntagsZeitung reported.  Swiss banks shouldn’t underestimate risks from the nation’s
property market, which are greater than those from the European
debt crisis, Hildebrand said in an interview with the Zurich-
based  newspaper . While property prices don’t indicate that the
market is over-valued, most indexes point to further gains, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
