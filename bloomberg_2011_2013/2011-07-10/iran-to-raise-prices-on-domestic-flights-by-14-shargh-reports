Iran  plans to raise prices on
domestic flights by about 14 percent after government energy
subsidy cuts last year increased jet fuel costs fourfold,  Shargh 
reported, citing a transportation official.  The higher prices will be applied in the “near future” in
line with the increase in jet fuel prices to 4,000 rials ($0.38)
a liter from 1,000 rials a liter, Shahriar Afandizadeh, deputy
minister of road and transportation, told the Tehran-based
newspaper.  Prices of a return flight from the capital, Tehran, to the
southern city of Shiraz will increase to 721,620 rials from
633,000 rials, while Tehran flights to the coastal city of
Bandar Abbas will increase to 1,081,860 rials from 949,000
rials, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
