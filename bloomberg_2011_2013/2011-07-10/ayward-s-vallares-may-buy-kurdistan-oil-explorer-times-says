Vallares Plc, the investment vehicle
led by BP Plc’s former Chief Executive Officer  Tony Hayward , is
in talks to buy Genel Enerji AS, the Sunday Times reported.  Talks with Genel, a Turkish oil-exploration business with
assets in the semi-autonomous Kurdish region of northern Iraq,
are at an early stage, the newspaper reported, without saying
where it got the information.  Vallares declined to comment on the report. Officials at
 Turkey ’s Cukurova Holding AS, which owns Genel, couldn’t be
reached for comment today when Bloomberg News telephoned the
parent’s headquarters in Istanbul.  To contact the reporter on this story:
