Zimbabwe â€™s diamond miners will earn
$334 million from the sale of the gems this year, the  Sunday
Mail  said, citing Goodwills Masimirembwa, chairman of the state-
owned Zimbabwe Mining Development Corp.  Half of the income will go directly to the Zimbabwe
government in the form of royalties, withholding tax on foreign
owners and dividends, the Harare-based newspaper said today.
Miners at Marange in eastern Zimbabwe are digging about 500
carats of the precious stones a month, the state-controlled
Sunday Mail added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
