Alexandria Mineral Oils Co. (AMOC)  surged
the most in almost a month after the Egyptian petroleum products
company said its fiscal year profit almost doubled.  The shares climbed 7.6 percent, the biggest intraday gain
since June 14, to 68.99 Egyptian pounds at 12:28 p.m. in Cairo.
That gave the company a market value of 5.94 billion pounds
($997 million). The benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  fell 0.2 percent.  Net income for the year ended June 30 was 1.05 billion
pounds compared with 557 million pounds a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
