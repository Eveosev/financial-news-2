Kuwait narrowed the discount for
August oil shipments to Asia to the slimmest margin in almost
two years after  Saudi Arabia  last week raised the price for its
comparable Arab Medium crude to refiners in the  Far East .  State-owned Kuwait Petroleum Corp. said today its Export
Crude will sell in August at a discount of 60 cents a barrel
below the average of Oman and Dubai crudes. The narrowest
discount since October 2009 comes after an increase in the cost
from the 85 cents below the Gulf benchmarks used by traders in
Asia for sales to long-term customers this month.  Persian Gulf oil producers such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait
sell the bulk of their crude to refiners under long-term
contracts. Most of the Gulf region’s state oil companies price
their crude at a premium or discount to a benchmark.  Saudi Arabian Oil Co., the world’s largest crude exporter,
last week cut official selling prices for August shipments of
light crudes to buyers in the U.S. and  Asia  and raised prices
for medium and heavy grades in those markets.  Saudi Aramco’s differentials, the first released each
month, influence regional pricing. Aramco’s Arab Medium crude is
rated at 31 degrees of gravity, a measure of how easily the oil
flows as defined by the  American Petroleum Institute , compared
with 30.5 degrees for Kuwait’s Export Crude.  To contact the reporters on this story:
