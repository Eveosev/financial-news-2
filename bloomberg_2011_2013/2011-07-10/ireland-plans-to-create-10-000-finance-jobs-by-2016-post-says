Irish Prime Minister  Enda Kenny  will
endorse a plan to create more financial services jobs in Dublin,
the  Sunday Business Post  reported, citing an unidentified person
familiar with the matter.  The strategy, jointly designed by the government and
Clearing House Group, aims to add 10,000 jobs in the next five
years, the Dublin-based newspaper said. The state will commit to
expanding its network of tax treaties, translate European law
quickly into Irish legislation and market Irish financial
services abroad, the Post reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
