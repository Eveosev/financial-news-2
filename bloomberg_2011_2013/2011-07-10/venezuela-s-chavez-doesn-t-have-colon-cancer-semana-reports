Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez ’s
cancer isn’t of the colon and isn’t “serious,”  Semana  magazine
reported, citing an interview with former Vice President and
Defense Minister Jose Vicente Rangel.  Chavez recently had a tumor removed by Cuban doctors and
the Venezuelan leader’s treatment doesn’t for now include
chemotherapy, Semana said, citing Rangel, who advises the
government.  Rangel didn’t say what kind of cancer Chavez has, Semana
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
