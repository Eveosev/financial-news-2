Copper imports by  China , the largest
consumer, rose 10 percent in June from the previous month as
buying from overseas became profitable and supply tightened
after consumers drained local stockpiles.  Inbound shipments were 280,009 metric tons compared with
254,738 tons in May, the General Administration of Customs said
on its  website  today. Imports were 15 percent lower than 328,231
tons a year ago.  Imports climbed for the first time in three months as
arbitrage traders sought to profit by purchasing the metal in
London and selling in  Shanghai . Copper stockpiles have fallen by
half since reaching the highest level this year in March amid a
seasonal increase in demand.  “Starting from late-May, we’ve seen positive arbitrage for
most of the time,” said Wang Mingyi, an analyst at Galaxy
Futures Co. “As transportation takes one to two months,
arrivals in July should be even higher.”  Copper for delivery in three months on the  London  Metal
Exchange climbed to an almost three-month high of $9,789.75 a
ton on July 8. The metal for delivery in September on the
Shanghai Futures Exchange, which includes 17 percent value-added
tax, closed 1.2 percent higher at 71,870 yuan ($11,118) a ton.  Stockpiles monitored by the Shanghai bourse have fallen to
89,498 tons, 50 percent less than this year’s high of 177,365
tons in March, according to exchange data.  Copper stored at bonded warehouses in Shanghai has dropped
to 350,000 tons to 400,000 tons from a record of 600,000 tons at
the end of March, according to Shenzhen Rongtuo Trading Co. The
warehouses located in Shanghai’s free-trade zones are used to
store arrivals that haven’t cleared customs. There is no
official data available on warehouse levels.  China also imported 64,491 tons of unwrought aluminum and
products in June, compared with 74,880 tons in May and 74,582
tons in June 2010, according to the customs. Exports of
unwrought aluminum were 59,166 tons.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
