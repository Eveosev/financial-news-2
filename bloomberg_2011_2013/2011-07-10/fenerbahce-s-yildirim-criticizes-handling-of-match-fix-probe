Fenerbahce Sports Club Chairman Aziz Yildirim denied involvement in a soccer match-fixing scandal and
criticized the leaking of his mug shots and other information to
the press, according to a statement.  The handling of the case by the police and press violates
the principles of secrecy in the investigation and the
presumption of innocence, he said, according to a  statement  on
the Istanbul-based club’s website.  Yildirim, 60, has been shuttling between jail and
hospitals, where he’s received treatment for heart troubles,
since he was detained by police last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
