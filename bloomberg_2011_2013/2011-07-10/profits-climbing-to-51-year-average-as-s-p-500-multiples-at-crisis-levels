Earnings growth in the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index is climbing back to the average rate since the
1960s as the  U.S. economy  recovers, even with equity valuations
stuck near credit-crisis levels.  Companies in the S&P 500 are poised to boost net income by
19 percent in 2011, including a 13 percent gain in the second
quarter, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
The gain will push profits back in line with their average
increase of 6.9 percent over the last 51 years, data compiled by
Brockhouse & Cooper Inc. and Bloomberg show. At the same time,
the index is trading for 13.5 times projected 2011 earnings, 7.8
percent less than the average since the start of 2006.  The gap between earnings and shares is bolstering bulls who
say equities will keep rallying as prices catch up to profits.
Skeptics say reduced stimulus spending,  Europe ’s debt crisis and
 China ’s efforts to curb inflation signal the 99 percent rally in
the  S&P 500  since March 2009 has gone too far. A report showing
employers in the U.S. added 83 percent fewer jobs in June than
economists projected heightened concern the economy is slowing.  “The fact that valuations have not returned to normal is
simply that people are prejudiced against stocks,” said  David Kelly , who helps oversee about $445 billion as chief market
strategist for JPMorgan Funds in New York. “Earnings growth has
been spectacular. People who are buying stocks today are buying
an undervalued asset.”  Revert to Mean  Profit growth is reverting to its mean rate even as
quarterly gains diminish. Projected earnings growth in the
second quarter would be the slowest since the recovery began,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It compares with a 49
percent advance in last year’s second quarter and a 29 percent
contraction in the same period in 2009, the data show.  Companies that posted some of the biggest profit declines
two years ago are forecast to generate gains that beat the
market in the quarter ended June 30.  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) , the
largest maker of construction equipment, and  Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) ,
the biggest U.S. chemical maker, will probably report 63 percent
and 42 percent growth, respectively, in second-quarter net
income. Caterpillar posted a 66 percent decrease during the same
period in 2009, while Dow reported a loss.  Stocks rose last week, pushing the S&P 500 up 0.3 percent
to 1,343.80, as gains in technology and commodity companies were
enough to overcome the worst monthly jobs report since
September. The advance extended the equity benchmark’s 2011 gain
to 6.9 percent. Since reaching a record of 1,565.15 on Oct. 9,
2007, the S&P 500 is down 14 percent.  No Agreement  The index dropped 1.8 percent to 1,319.49 at 4 p.m. in New
York today as concern grew that Europe’s debt crisis will spread
and American lawmakers failed to agree on cutting the deficit.  Alcoa Inc. (AA) , the largest U.S. aluminum producer, started the
second-quarter earnings season today. The New York-based company
said profit more than doubled as prices for the lightweight
metal rose. Excluding $38 million of one-time items, income was
32 cents a share, missing the 33-cent average analyst estimate
in a Bloomberg survey.  The worst recession in seven decades caused the biggest
interruption in a trend that had lifted earnings since 1960,
according to Montreal-based Brockhouse, an investment consulting
and securities trading firm owned by Pavilion Financial Corp.
S&P 500 profits fell for nine straight quarters starting in
2007, sending annual income to a five-year low of $60.59 a share
in 2008, Bloomberg data show.  Earnings Lift  The recovery since 2009 is poised to push earnings to a
combined $99.34 a share this year, according to estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Reaching that forecast would almost erase
the impact of the credit crisis on profits and push the rate of
expansion back to its historical average, according to
Brockhouse data.  “Earnings growth will continue to be positive,” said
Wayne Lin, a  money manager  at Baltimore-based Legg Mason Inc.,
which manages $671 billion. “Still, there’s been a fundamental
shift in psychology in terms of  risk aversion  after 2008. People
are a lot more cautious and react a lot more quickly to
uncertainty. That’s why you’re seeing attractive valuations that
seem to be persistent.”  Companies in the S&P 500 are trading near the average
valuation of 13.4 reached in the month after the benchmark gauge
sank to a 12-year low in March 2009. Should the multiple expand
to its five-year average of 14.7, the S&P 500 would climb to
about 1,460 based on its 2011 projected earnings.  Fed Program Ends  Investors are refusing to pay more for future earnings
because of concern the economy will slow after the  Federal
Reserve  ended its program of buying Treasuries, according to
Brian Jacobsen of San Francisco-based Wells Fargo Asset
Management. While profits may be rising, growth is slowing and
the economy may not support earnings at record levels, he said.  Economists’ median forecast for U.S. gross domestic product
in 2011 has dropped to 2.5 percent from 2.7 percent in May, and
the median for 2012 has declined to 2.9 percent from 3.1
percent, according to Bloomberg surveys. Earnings growth for S&P
500 companies may slow to 13 percent next year and 11 percent in
2013, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The S&P 500 dropped as much as 7.2 percent since reaching
this year’s peak on April 29 as S&P and Moody’s Investors
Service cut  Greece ’s credit rating.  Not Paying Up  “Valuations are still at a discount because investors
don’t just pay for the next quarter’s earnings,” said Jacobsen,
chief portfolio strategist for the mutual-fund division of Wells
Fargo Asset Management, which oversees more than $400 billion.
“They pay for the whole trajectory of earnings going into the
future. Though you can be optimistic about what will be reported
for the quarter that just ended, it’s hard to get too excited
about growth going forward.”  U.S. Treasuries are signaling the economic slowdown will
continue. The 3 percentage point gap between rates for three-
month and 10-year debt indicates the economy may grow 1.1
percent in the 12 months ending June 2012, a study by the
Federal Reserve Bank of  Cleveland  says. That’s less than half
the central bank’s current forecast.  The last time S&P 500 profits exceeded their trend level,
during the four years ended October 2008, the difference between
earnings and the trend averaged 14.5 percent, according to
Brockhouse. Should they overshoot by a similar margin this time,
earnings may reach $126.80 a share by 2013, Brockhouse
estimated. Analysts project $124.52 for that year, Bloomberg
data show.  Caterpillar, Dow  Caterpillar trades at 15.8 times its 2011 forecast earnings
excluding some items of $6.99 a share. That compares with the
average multiple of 16.4 in the past six years, Bloomberg data
show. Second-quarter earnings probably climbed to $1.75,
according to the average analyst estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  Dow Chemical will report 82-cents-a-share in profit
excluding some items on July 27, analysts estimated. Based on
its forecast 2011 earnings of $2.94 a share, the stock trades at
12.4 times earnings, 34 percent lower than its average since
2005, Bloomberg data show.  “The gap between good earnings growth and low stock
valuations will close over time,” said Paul Zemsky, the New
York-based head of  asset allocation  for ING Investment
Management, which oversees $550 billion. “It’s a combination of
time healing the wounds of the recession and the market putting
behind the memories of the financial crisis. Profit growth will
converge down to a still pretty good rate and people will move
money back into stocks because they are cheap.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
