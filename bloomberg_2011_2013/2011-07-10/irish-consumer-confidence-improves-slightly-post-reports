Irish consumer confidence improved
“slightly” in the past quarter, the  Sunday Business Post 
reported, citing a poll by Red C.  Almost a quarter of respondents expect the economy to
improve, with slightly more people expecting no change, the
Dublin-based newspaper reported. More than half of those polled
expect house prices to fall further.  The poll of 1,000 adults was conducted between June 20 and
June 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
