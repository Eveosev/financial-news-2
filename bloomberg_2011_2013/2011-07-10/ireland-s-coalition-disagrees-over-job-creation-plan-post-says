Ireland’s coalition government is
divided over a plan to stimulate the economy and create 100,000
jobs, the  Sunday Business Post  reported.  Fine Gael and the  Labour Party  disagree over the scale,
pace and level of investment for the plan, the Dublin-based
paper reported, citing unidentified government officials.  There are also “doubts” the European Union and
 International Monetary Fund  will sanction the use of 4 billion
euros ($5.7 billion) in the National Pension Reserve Fund to
finance the plan, the Post reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
