News Corp. (NWSA) , the media company
chaired by  Rupert Murdoch , had been considering closing the News
of the World for almost a year, the Sunday Telegraph  reported ,
without saying where it got the information.  New York-based News Corp. is still “relatively bullish”
about its planned 7.8 billion-pound ($12.5 billion) takeover of
British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc., the Sunday Telegraph
reported, after the U.K. Sunday tabloid published its final
issue today amid telephone-hacking allegations. News Corp.
accepts that its bid for full control of BSkyB may be delayed
until 2012 and has not changed its course of action, the Sunday
Telegraph reported, citing unidentified sources.  To contact the reporter on this story:
