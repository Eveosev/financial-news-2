The Kendal Group Ltd.  hired a
financial adviser to examine the possible sale of swimwear-maker
Zoggs International Ltd., the Sunday Telegraph  reported , citing
unidentified sources close to the situation.  A sale of Zoggs would probably generate a multimillion-
pound (multimillion-dollar) profit for Lightwater, England-based
Kendal, according to the U.K. newspaper. Kendal, controlled by
Daniel and Leo Gestetner, hired Livingstone Partners LLC as an
adviser, the Sunday Telegraph said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
