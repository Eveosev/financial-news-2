Japan  and Australia agreed on the
need for the United Nations Security Council to deliver an
effective response to North Korea’s rocket launch in December,
at a meeting of their foreign ministers today.  Japan’s Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida and Australian
counterpart Bob Carr agreed to step up cooperation on UN
peacekeeping, nuclear non-proliferation and to push forward an
arms trade treaty to reduce weapons supplied to rogue states and
terrorist groups, according to a joint statement released today.  Japan and Australia, in the midst of negotiating a free-
trade agreement, are strong allies of the U.S., which under
President  Barack Obama  is “pivoting” its military strength
toward the Asia-Pacific from the Middle East. The U.S. and
 Australia  have agreed to hold joint military exercises with
Japan, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in Perth in
November after a meeting with senior Australian government
ministers, including Carr.  The Sydney visit is the last leg of Kishida’s first
international tour since being appointed foreign minister by
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe last month. In the past week he’s been
to the  Philippines , where he discussed his nation’s territorial
disputes with China, as well as Singapore and Brunei.  To contact the reporters on this story:
