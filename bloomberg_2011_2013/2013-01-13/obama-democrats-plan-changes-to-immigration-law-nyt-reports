President  Barack Obama  and Senate
Democrats plan to seek changes to U.S. immigration law in a bill
that includes a way for undocumented immigrants to become
citizens, the  New York Times (NYT)  reported, citing unidentified
administration officials and lawmakers.  Obama and fellow Democrats will oppose efforts by some
Republicans to deal with immigration changes in smaller pieces
that might be easier for their party to support, the newspaper
reported, citing the officials. The president may begin laying
out his proposal in the State of the Union speech next month,
the Times said, citing the officials.  The plan would call for verification of legal status for
all new workers, more visas, permit skilled immigrants to stay
and create a guest-worker program for future low-wage
immigrants, the newspaper said.  Republican senators including Lindsey Graham of South
Carolina and  John McCain  and Jeff Flake of Arizona have been
meeting with Senator Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat, on
writing an immigration bill, the Times said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
