Isa Qambar, the Azeri opposition
leader who plans to run for president in October, was assaulted
by a mob during a visit today to a southern district near the
Iranian border, the party said in an e-mailed statement.  About 100 people attacked Qambar and fellow party members,
beating them and smashing their cars, said Musavat, or Equality,
 Azerbaijan ’s main opposition and oldest political party,
established in 1911. Police didn’t intervene, according to the
statement.  Ehsan Zahidov, a spokesman for the Ministry of Interior,
declined to comment immediately when called on his mobile.  President  Ilham Aliyev , who beat Qambar in disputed
presidential elections in 2003, is expected to run for a third
term in office this year. His father, Heydar Aliyev, had led
Azerbaijan for the better part of three decades before stepping
down in October 2003 and dying later that year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
