The nomination of former Senator
Chuck Hagel to be defense secretary could generate an important
debate over national security. That will only happen if critics
skip sideshows such as ridiculous accusations that he is anti-
Semitic or pro-terrorist and avoid cherry picking his votes.  The real debate is whether to return to the early foreign
policy of President  George W. Bush  -- a unilateral, aggressive
interventionism requiring a robust military machine -- or adopt
a more selective approach in which the U.S. is the dominant
force in the world but depends on alliances and sets priorities.  “This battle has not as much to do with Chuck Hagel or any
comments he made on Israel,” says Joseph Nye, a former top
Defense Department official who teaches at Harvard University’s
Kennedy School of Government. “This is about re-litigating
major changes in foreign policy.”  Senator Lindsey Graham , a South Carolina Republican who has
supported most Obama administration Cabinet nominees, should
have credibility when he assails the choice of his former Senate
colleague. “Chuck Hagel is out of the mainstream,” Graham
says, “on most issues regarding foreign policy.”  Nonetheless, Graham and other critics, in particular the
so-called neo-conservatives who dominated Bush’s first term,
obfuscate the central issues with dubious, duplicitous charges.  Anti-Israel  Hagel is accused of being anti-Israel. “He would be the
most antagonistic secretary of defense toward Israel in our
nation’s history,” Graham charges.  More antagonistic than the third defense secretary, George Catlett Marshall, who once told his commander in chief,
President  Harry Truman , that he’d vote against his re-election
if the U.S. recognized the state of Israel?  Hagel once carelessly referred to the “Jewish lobby” to
describe the powerful pro-Israel lobby in Washington. That
prompts neo-cons such as  Elliott Abrams , who served in foreign
policy positions for Presidents  Ronald Reagan  and George W.
Bush, to call him anti-Semitic, an outlandish fabrication.  In two Senate terms, Hagel voted for every measure
containing aid to Israel. He is a critic of some of Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin’s Netanyahu’s policies; so is President
 Barack Obama .  The Nebraska lawmaker’s conversion to opponent of the  Iraq
war  rankles neo-cons, especially his criticism of the troop
surge in 2007. “I’ll have a hard time supporting anybody to be
secretary of defense who believes the surge was a foreign policy
blunder,” Graham says.  Yet Graham says he supports the nomination of Senator  John Kerry  to be secretary of state. The Massachusetts Democrat
opposed the surge, as did Republican senators such as  Susan Collins  of Maine and Norman Coleman of Minnesota, as well as
Democrats such as  Joe Biden  of Delaware,  Hillary Clinton  of New
York and Barack Obama of Illinois.  As secretary, Hagel, a 66-year-old decorated Vietnam combat
veteran, will face huge budget and spending priorities
decisions; he’ll have to enlist deputies better versed in
Pentagonese.  That concerns Graham and other neo-cons who see America as
under siege and the only guarantor of freedom in a world beset
by a plethora of threats: Iran and North Korea developing
nuclear weapons; terrorism; Afghanistan hanging in the balance;
the unraveling of the Arab spring and the rise of China.  Interventionist Zeal  In contrast to Hagel -- or the president -- they express
few reservations about intervening in places such as Syria or
carrying out a military strike against Iran’s nuclear capacity.
In the  Middle East , they are unswervingly pro-Israel.  These policies require an ability to simultaneously take
action in multiple trouble spots, which means a beefed-up
Pentagon budget, and more forces and weapons.  Hagel and Obama aren’t completely in sync; the president
seems to take a harder line on dealing with Iran, though he also
believes sanctions and pressure might succeed. On Israel, both
are generally supportive, with reservations about the current
Israeli government’s policies.  Hagel and Obama believe that the U.S. can’t police the
world, that multilateral alliances are central to a successful
foreign policy and that new policy priorities -- foremost in
Asia -- and that a leaner military budget are inevitable.  “They believe in a more efficient, as opposed to just a
greater, use of American power,” says Nye, who supports Hagel,
with whom he served on the Defense Policy Board.  He sees the Nebraska Republican, out of sync with his own
party today, as emblematic of President Dwight Eisenhower’s
foreign policy of the 1950s. “Ike felt that forces of
occupation in poor countries where they are not welcome are
losing propositions,” Nye says. (Eisenhower’s granddaughter has
championed Hagel’s nomination.)  Graham’s charge that Hagel is “out of the mainstream” is
refuted by the nominee’s roster of supporters, including
prominent Republicans such as former Secretary of State  Colin Powell , former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, former
homeland security chief  Tom Ridge  and former Defense Secretary
Bob Gates. Hagel also has the backing of leading Democrats,
including former National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski,
former Secretary of State  Madeleine Albright  and top defense
experts in the Senate,  Jack Reed  of Rhode Island and  Carl Levin 
of Michigan, along with more than a dozen former top generals
and prominent ambassadors, including six who served in Israel.  The public, on issues ranging from the value of the Iraq
war to remaining in Afghanistan to the size of the  defense
budget , appears more in tune with Hagel than with the neo-cons.
Israel has strong support; an attack on Iran doesn’t.  The nominee will be confirmed and a healthy debate over
these matters might show the public who is the more mainstream:
Hagel or Graham.  ( Albert R. Hunt  is a Bloomberg View columnist. The opinions
