Lahiru Thirimanne scored his maiden
one-day century as Sri Lanka beat Australia by eight wickets in
Adelaide to tie their five-match limited-overs series at 1-1.  Thirimanne finished unbeaten on 102 as the tourists scored
172-2 in response to Australia’s 170 all out, with  Tillakaratne
Dilshan  adding 51 runs.  It was Sri Lanka’s first win against Australia on this tour
after slumping to a 3-0 defeat in the Test series and suffering
a 107-run loss in the opening one-day game.  Australia lost regular wickets in its innings, with only
four batsmen reaching double figures. Wicketkeeper Brad Haddin
top-scored with 50. Lasith Malinga claimed 3-32, with Angelo Mathews and Thisara Perera both taking two wickets.  The next match is in Brisbane on Jan. 18, followed by games
in Sydney two days later and Hobart on Jan. 23. The teams are
also scheduled to contest two Twenty20 internationals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
