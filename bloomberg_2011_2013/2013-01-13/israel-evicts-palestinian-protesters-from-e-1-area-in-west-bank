Israeli police overnight evicted
dozens of Palestinians who had set up a protest encampment in
E-1, a disputed area between east Jerusalem and the  West Bank 
settlement of Maaleh Adumim.  “We won’t permit anyone to endanger the contiguity between
Jerusalem and Maaleh Adumim,” Netanyahu told the weekly Cabinet
meeting in Jerusalem, according to a text message from his
office.  The Israeli government issued preliminary approval on Nov.
30 to build homes in E-1, sparking criticism from the U.S.,
 United Nations  and European Union that such a move could
endanger the  peace process . Palestinians say Israeli
construction in the area would disrupt the territorial viability
of their future state.  Israel’s eviction of peaceful demonstrators from E-1 is
“shameful,” Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said.
“Palestinians are not trying to build a settlement there,
Palestinians are trying to protect the land of their state,”
Erekat said in an interview on  Israel ’s Army Radio  Peace talks were suspended in 2010 after Netanyahu declined
to renew a freeze on settlement construction that Palestinians
say must be a pre-condition to renewing negotiations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
