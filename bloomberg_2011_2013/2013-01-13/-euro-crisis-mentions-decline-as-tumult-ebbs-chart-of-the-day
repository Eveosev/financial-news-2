The financial-market tumult that has
plagued the euro area for more than three years may be ebbing.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows the number references to
“euro” and “crisis” within three words of each other in
Bloomberg News stories since the Greek-led turmoil began in late
2009. The most recent day for which data is available shows that
pattern appearing 100 times.  That compares with a median of 314 and a high of 758 on
Dec. 8, 2011, the day of a European summit meeting.  “The worst probably is over, but what we still have to do
is difficult,” Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker ,
who has been head of the group of euro-area finance ministers
since 2005, said Jan. 10.  European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said the same
day that “we are now back in a normal situation from a
financial viewpoint.”  There have been false dawns before. References to euro and
crisis declined in early 2012 before surging anew to more than
700 in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
