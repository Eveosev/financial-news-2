The average price for regular
gasoline at U.S. pumps rose 6.68 cents a gallon in the past
three weeks to $3.3247 as a rally in crude prices led refiners
to boost costs for fuel marketers, according to Lundberg Survey
Inc.  The survey covers the period ended Jan. 11 and is based on
information obtained from about 2,500 stations by the Camarillo,
California-based company. The increase in the latest report is
the first in 11 weeks and the average is down 3.49 cents from a
year earlier.  “It comes mostly from higher crude oil prices,” Trilby Lundberg, president of Lundberg Survey, said yesterday in a
telephone interview. “U.S. refineries are paying more for crude
and now are passing along those costs to their marketers.”  West Texas Intermediate crude on the New York Mercantile
Exchange rose $4.90, or 5.5 percent, to $93.56 a barrel in the
three weeks to Jan. 11.  Crude inventories  rose 1.31 million barrels in the week
ended Jan. 4 to 361.3 million, according to data from the U.S.
Energy Information Administration. It was the first increase in
four weeks. Refineries ran at 89.1 percent of capacity, down 1.3
percentage points.  Gasoline futures on the Nymex rose 0.48 cent to $2.7395 a
gallon in the past three weeks. Futures have dropped 2.6 percent
since December.  Stockpiles Rose  U.S.  gasoline stockpiles  rose to the highest level since
February 2011 in the week ended Jan. 4, climbing 7.41 million
barrels to 233.1 million. Supplies, up 16 percent in seven
weeks, are the highest seasonally since the department began
reporting weekly data in 1990.  Oil may rise this week after  China ’s exports jumped more
than forecast last month, bolstering optimism that growth will
accelerate, a Bloomberg survey showed.  Fourteen of 28 analysts, or 50 percent, forecast crude will
increase through Jan. 18. Nine respondents, or 32 percent,
predicted a decline. Five forecast little change. Last week, 58
percent of analysts projected a gain. The European Central Bank
this month cut its 2013 euro-area economic forecast to a
contraction of 0.3 percent from 0.5 percent growth.  Regular gasoline on Long Island averaged $3.75 a gallon,
the highest in the lower 48 U.S. states among the markets
surveyed, Lundberg said. Salt Lake City posted the lowest
average price at $2.76 a gallon. Los Angeles-area retail
stations averaged $3.65.  To contact the reporters on this story:
