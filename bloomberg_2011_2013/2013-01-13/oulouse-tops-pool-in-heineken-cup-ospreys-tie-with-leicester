Toulouse beat Treviso 35-14 today to
move atop Pool 2 in European rugby’s Heineken Cup. Leicester
tied 15-15 at Ospreys and Munster won 26-17 at Edinburgh.  Four-time champion Toulouse scored five tries, all
converted by Luke McAllister, to  move on to 18 points , two ahead
of Leicester. Ospreys have 11 points and Treviso one after the
fifth round of games. Ospreys and Leicester each scored two
tries.  Leicester hosts Toulouse a week today in a match that will
decide the group winner. Munster’s victory means it moves up to
second in Pool 1, three points behind Saracens.  Earlier this weekend Harlequins, Toulon and Clermont
Auvergne maintained their perfect records to qualify for the
quarterfinals.  Harlequins routed Connacht 47-8 in Pool 3, Toulon beat
Cardiff Blues 45-25 in Pool 6 and Clermont won Pool 5 with a 46-
3 win over Exeter. Saracens are poised to advance after beating
Racing Metro 37-28, and last season’s runner-up Ulster goes
through after a 23-6 victory over Glasgow in Pool 4.  Defending champion Leinster beat the Scarlets 33-14 to stay
alive in Pool 5. There were also wins this weekend for
Northampton, Montpellier and Biarritz.  The six pool winners and two best second-place teams after
six games advance to the knockout rounds of  Europe ’s elite club
competition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
