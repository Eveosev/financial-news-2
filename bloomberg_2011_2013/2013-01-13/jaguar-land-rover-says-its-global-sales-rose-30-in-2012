Jaguar Land Rover’s global sales
rose 30 percent last year, with China surpassing the U.K. to
become the largest market for the unit of  Tata Motors (TTMT)  Ltd.  Jaguar Land Rover sales totaled 357,773 vehicles in 2012,
the company said in an e-mailed statement. It plans to add 800
jobs to support development of new models, according to the
statement.  “We will see sales increase quite significantly across all
our regions in 2013,” Phil Popham, Jaguar Land Rover’s director
of group sales operations, said at a press briefing ahead of the
North American International Auto Show in Detroit.  Tata Motors acquired the two brands from  Ford Motor Co. (F)  in
2008 for $2.5 billion. Under Tata, Jaguar and Land Rover have
targeted  emerging markets  such as China and  Russia  for growth.
The brands sold 71,940 vehicles in  China  last year, up 71
percent, surpassing sales in the U.K. at 68,333 and the U.S. at
55,675.  The brands have developed new models such as the Range
Rover Evoque sport-utility vehicle in 2011 and the upcoming
convertible Jaguar F-Type. The 800 additional jobs for new-model
development will be at Jaguar Land Rover’s Solihull plant in the
U.K., according to the statement.  Land Rover global deliveries rose 36 percent last year,
while Jaguar sales increased 6 percent, according to the
statement. In the U.S., Land Rover sales climbed 15 percent to
43,664 while Jaguar fell 2.2 percent to 12,011, the company said
