Saudi Investment Bank (SIBC)  reported a 67
percent rise in fourth-quarter profit, topping analysts’
estimates, as operating income increased and expenses dropped.  Net income climbed to 245.6 million riyals ($65 million),
from 147.4 million riyals in the year earlier period, the
Riyadh-based bank said in a  statement  to the Saudi stock market
today. The mean estimate of three analysts was for profit of 223
million riyals, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Acceleration in loan growth has been a key area of
positive surprise,” Murad Ansari, an analyst at EFG Hermes
Saudi Arabia, said today in an e-mailed response to questions.
“Non-interest income has jumped sharply, which along with the
fall in provisioning costs,” boosted profit, he said.  The bank, which posted a 26 percent increase in net lending
from a year earlier, is the latest Saudi lender to post an
increase in fourth quarter profit.  Saudi Hollandi Bank (AAAL)  reported
a 36 percent gain in earnings, while  Bank Albilad (ALBI)  had a 46
percent rise.  Banque Saudi Fransi (BSFR) ’s fourth-quarter net income
rose to 808 million riyals, from 661 million a year earlier.  Saudi Investment Bank  shares  climbed 12 percent in 2012
compared with a 6 percent increase for the  benchmark Tadawul All
Share Index .  To contact the reporter on this story:
