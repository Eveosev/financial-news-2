Unidentified gunmen opened fire on
the Italian consul’s convoy in the eastern city of Benghazi, in
the latest attack on foreign diplomats, a government official
said.  The attack yesterday came as  Libya ’s prime minister met
with his Algerian and Tunisian counterparts to discuss border
security amid concerns that armed groups and weapons are moving
freely through their shared borders.  The Italian diplomat, who was riding in an armored car,
escaped uninjured, Guma Meshery, an official with the  Interior
Ministry , said by phone late yesterday.  The attack took place in Benghazi, the birthplace of the
uprising that led to Muammar Qaddafi’s ouster and killing in
2011, and came four months after the U.S. ambassador to Libya
was killed during an attack in the same city.  To contact the reporter on this story:
