Defensemen Michael Del Zotto and
Matt Gilroy agreed to new contracts with the  New York Rangers  as
a week-long training camp gets under way ahead of the start of a
48-game shortened National Hockey League season.  Restricted free agent Del Zotto, 22, had a career-high 10
goals and 41 points with the Rangers in 2011-12. Gilroy returns
to New York after spending 2011-12 with the  Tampa Bay Lightning 
and Ottawa Senators. North Bellmore, New York, native Gilroy won
the 2009 Hobey Baker Award as college hockey’s top player.  Contract terms weren’t disclosed by the Rangers in a
statement on their website today. Del Zotto signed a two-year
deal worth $2.5 million, ESPN reported, while Gilroy penned a
one-year accord.  The NHL season will begin in six days after players
ratified a labor accord to end a 117-day lockout. The 30 teams
will play an average of 3.5 games each week leading up to the
start of the Stanley Cup playoffs on April 30.  The Rangers begin their season Jan. 19 at the  Boston
Bruins , with their home opener the following day against the
 Pittsburgh Penguins .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
