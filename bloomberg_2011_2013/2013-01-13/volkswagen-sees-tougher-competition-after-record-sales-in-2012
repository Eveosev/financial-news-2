Volkswagen AG (VOW) ,  Europe ’s largest
carmaker, debuted a concept sport-utility vehicle designed for
the U.S. market to challenge  Ford Motor Co. (F) ’s Explorer and
Chrysler Group LLC’s  Jeep Grand Cherokee .  VW today at the North American International Auto Show in
Detroit showed the Crossblue, which will be priced between the
smaller Tiguan and upscale Touareg. The SUV would seat as many
as seven passengers and compete against the Explorer, Grand
Cherokee and  Toyota (7203)  Motor Corp.’s Highlander, which all start at
about $29,000.  The new SUV could help Volkswagen reach its target of
increasing sales in the U.S., where it lags competitors, to 1
million Audi and VW vehicles by 2018 from 577,443 last year. The
SUV segment accounts for 29 percent of the U.S. market, trailing
only sedans, which have a 38 percent share, according to data
supplied by VW.  “The SUV segment is posting the strongest growth,” said
Frank Biller, an analyst with LBBW in Stuttgart, Germany. “This
is where the action is.”  VW, which today reported group deliveries rose 11 percent
in 2012 to 9.07 million vehicles, says it’s preparing for
tougher competition and more uncertainties in 2013 as its home
region slumps a sixth year. VW came in third globally for 2012,
being edged out by General Motor Corp.’s 9.2 million deliveries
and Toyota’s forecast sales of 9.7 million vehicles.  Record Results  Last year “was the best sales year ever,” Chief Executive
Officer  Martin Winterkorn  said in the statement. “This is
another big step forward in our strategy 2018.”  The new SUV may help VW catch up in North America, which is
crucial to the Wolfsburg, Germany-based automaker’s plan to
overtake  GM (GM)  and Toyota and become the world’s largest automaker
by 2018. VW is trying to compensate for the effects of the debt
crisis on European car demand, which has fallen more than 20
percent since the 2007 peak, by expanding in the U.S. and  China .  Volkswagen could build the car at its $1 billion plant in
Chattanooga,  Tennessee , where it started production of a U.S.
version of the mid-sized  Passat (PSAT)  sedan in 2011. The factory,
which can currently produce about 220,000 vehicles annually, was
VW’s first in the U.S. since it closed a facility in
 Pennsylvania  in 1988.  Producing vehicles in  North America  instead of importing
them from Europe has reduced Volkswagen’s exposure to currency
swings between the dollar and the euro, which have weighed on
profits in the past. Volkswagen has the goal of making its
money-losing U.S. operations profitable again in 2013.  Losing Momentum  Volkswagen said in its 2011 annual report that the company
globally targets increased deliveries this year and aims to top
last year’s  operating profit . The manufacturer’s ability to do
so will be challenged by slowing sales in Germany. Industrywide
registrations in VW’s home market tumbled 16 percent in
December, leading to a 2.9 percent drop in 2012.  “Many markets are losing momentum,” Winterkorn said at an
event in  Detroit  late yesterday. “If the European markets are
getting weaker, we need to expand abroad.”  VW’s growth last year was paced by the Audi luxury brand.
Sales at the carmaker’s biggest earnings contributor rose 12
percent to 1.46 million cars and sport-utility vehicles. The
Ingolstadt, Germany-based premium brand grew U.S. deliveries 19
percent to 139,310 vehicles led by gains for the Q5 and Q7 SUVs.  Enormous Potential  “The SUV market in the U.S. offers enormous
opportunities,” Audi CEO Rupert Stadler told reporters today in
Detroit. “We want to expand our SUV lineup globally.”  Audi’s deliveries in 2013 may stagnate, according to IHS
Automotive, with Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz set to gain ground
helped by the refreshed E- and S-Class sedans. Volkswagen’s
total sales are forecast to edge 0.7 percent higher to 9.15
million vehicles in 2013, its slowest growth pace since the
financial crunch in 2009, according to IHS Automotive.  Sales at the Stuttgart, Germany-based sports carmaker
Porsche, which was fully integrated into the company in August,
edged up 19 percent to 141,075 vehicles, also a record. All
regions posted more than 10 percent growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
