Egyptian Prime Minister Hisham Qandil said talks with the International Monetary Fund over a
possible loan would resume shortly.  “We are going to be back on track very soon,” Qandil said
today at a conference in Cairo.  Egypt  invited a mission from the
IMF “to again realign the program so we can move forward with
our national reform program.”  Egypt is seeking to secure a $4.8 billion IMF loan that the
government says will help boost investor confidence and
encourage other lenders and donors. Egypt asked for a delay last
month after President Mohamed Mursi suspended tax increases
linked to its IMF-backed economic plan amid political tensions.
An IMF team is due to come to Egypt in two to three weeks,
presidential spokesman Yasser Ali said on Jan. 8.  “We are committed to reform,” Qandil said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
