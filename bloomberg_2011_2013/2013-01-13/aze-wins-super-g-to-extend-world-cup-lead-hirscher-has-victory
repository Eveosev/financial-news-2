Tina Maze  won today’s super-G race
in St. Anton, Austria, for her first-ever victory in the
discipline as the Slovenian extended her overall lead in
skiing’s World Cup.  The 29-year-old now has at least one win in every World Cup
discipline, with 12 of her 17 victories in giant slalom. Maze
has six wins this season and has built a 545-point lead over her
nearest challenger, Maria Hoefl-Riesch of Germany, atop the
overall standings.  Today, Maze was 0.04 second faster than Austria’s Anna
Fenninger, with Switzerland’s Fabienne Suter in third.  Lindsey Vonn  of the U.S., who leads the super-G
competition, was fourth. Her lead over Maze is now cut to 20
points, and she’s fifth overall.  Austria’s Marcel Hirscher also increased his World Cup lead
following a victory in today’s men’s slalom in Adelboden,
Switzerland. The 23-year-old was only eighth after the first
run.  Hirscher has 855 points in the overall competition, a 126-
point lead over Norway’s Aksel Lund Svindal. In the slalom
standings he has a 134-point lead ahead of Germany’s Felix
Neureuther.  Today, Austria’s Mario Matt was second, ahead of Italy’s
Manfred Moelgg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
