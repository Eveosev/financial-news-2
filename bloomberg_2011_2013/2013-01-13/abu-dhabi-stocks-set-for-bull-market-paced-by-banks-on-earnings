Abu Dhabi  shares rallied to a 19-
month high on bets earnings of the emirate’s banks will improve
and as the measure’s equities offer cheaper valuations than
 Persian Gulf  and emerging-market peers.  National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC , which may post an 11
percent advance in 2012 profit, rallied to the highest level in
almost seven years.  Union National Bank (UNB)  PJSC, whose shareholders
include the governments of Abu Dhabi and Dubai, gained for a
second day. The  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  increased 0.5 percent to
2,741.83, the strongest level since June 2011, at the close in
the United Arab Emirates capital.  The index has gained 19.6 percent since a Jan. 17, 2012
closing low of 2,293.09, nearing the 20 percent threshold some
investors consider as the beginning of a  bull market . Abu Dhabi
banks and real estate companies are recovering from a credit
crisis that caused property prices in the U.A.E. to drop by as
much as 65 percent and slowed lending, bringing the neighboring
emirate of Dubai to the brink of default in 2009.  “The fundamentals support the rise as corporate profits
are growing while the valuation is still depressed compared with
regional stock markets,” said Nabil Farhat, a partner at Abu
Dhabi-based Al Fajer Securities. The rally will continue
“within the limits of the technical picture.”  The measure climbed 9.5 percent in 2012 after dropping the
previous two years. Abu Dhabi stocks trade at a price-to-book
ratio of 1.01 times, compared with 1.6 times for the  Bloomberg
GCC 200 Index (BGCC200)  and 1.7 times for  MSCI Emerging Markets Index. (MXEF)   Bank Earnings  National Bank of Abu Dhabi, the U.A.E.’s second-biggest
bank by assets, may post profit of 4.1 billion dirhams ($1.1
billion) versus 3.71 billion dirhams in 2011 when the lender
releases results on Jan. 31, according to the  average estimate 
of eight analysts on Bloomberg. The shares, which surged 27
percent last year, increased 3.6 percent to 11.45 dirhams.  Union National Bank ’s fourth-quarter net income may more
than double to 300 million dirhams, the median estimate of three
analysts on Bloomberg shows. The shares rose 0.9 percent to 3.32
dirhams, the highest level since September 2011.  Real estate shares in the emirate helped lead the
benchmark’s 2012 gain as the government said it would resume
stalled projects including branches of the Louvre and Guggenheim
museums and as  Aldar Properties PJSC (ALDAR)  and  Sorouh Real Estate Co. (SOROUH) 
negotiated a potential merger. Shares of the two Abu Dhabi
developers dropped 0.6 percent today after rallying more than 15
percent last week.  Qatar Drops  The ADX General Index’s 14-day  relative strength index  rose
to 74 today. A reading above 70 indicates to some investors that
