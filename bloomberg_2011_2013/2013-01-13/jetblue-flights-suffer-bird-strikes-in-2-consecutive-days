Two  JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU)  flights
suffered bird strikes during takeoff and had to return to New
York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport in consecutive
days, the company said.  Flight 721 bound for Nassau in the Bahamas took off at 9:59
a.m. today and returned to the airport after striking a bird,
said spokeswoman Tamara Bentham. The plane was scheduled to
arrive in the Bahamas this afternoon, according to the JetBlue
 website . Flight 831 bound for Santiago in the  Dominican Republic 
returned to JFK after striking a bird as it took off yesterday
afternoon.  “In my experience, this is not a common occurrence for
us,” Bentham said. There was no significant damage to either of
the planes, she said.  Four years ago this month, Captain Chesley Sullenberger III
safely landed a US Airways Group Inc. plane on the water in an
incident that became known as the “Miracle on the Hudson.” A
flock of geese struck the plane about 90 seconds after takeoff,
forcing an emergency landing on the  Hudson River . All on board
survived.  The New York Post first reported the JetBlue bird strikes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
