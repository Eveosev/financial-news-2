Two sinking vessels deposited oil
and  diesel fuel  in separate incidents this weekend on the West
Coast, according to filings with the U.S. National Response
Center.  One vessel released 50 barrels of diesel fuel while sinking
on Lake Union in Seattle yesterday. Another leaked oil after
sinking in San Francisco Bay near Brisbane, California, on Jan.
11. Booms were put in place in both cases to secure the
surrounding area.  Further details on both incidents werenâ€™t immediately
available.  To contact the reporter on this story:
