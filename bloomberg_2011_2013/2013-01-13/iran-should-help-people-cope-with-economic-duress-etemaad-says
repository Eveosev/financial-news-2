Iranian Parliamentary Speaker Ali
Larijani said government officials should take steps to offset
economic hardships,  Etemaad  newspaper reported.  Iranians are struggling with inflation and unemployment,
Larijani said. “It isn’t in the nation’s interest for people to
endure more economic pressure,” he said, according to Etemaad.  Iran ’s rial has lost as much as 40 percent of its value
against the U.S. dollar on the street market and costs have
soared as a result of tighter U.S. and European Union sanctions.  “Even at a time of sanctions, if we use all the existing
skills and aim for local production certainly inflation will
lessen and jobs will be created,” he told a rally in the
central city of Natanz, according to the Tehran-based newspaper.  Iranians will elect a new president in June and Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad is ineligible for a third consecutive term.
Larijani, who has been critical of the president’s policies, is
seen as a potential candidate in the race.  To contact the reporter on this story:
