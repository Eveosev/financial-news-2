Georgia  set free 190 political
prisoners who were incarcerated under the previous government
after a law pushed through by the country’s new parliament came
into effect.  Relatives and supporters gathered outside prisons today to
greet those who were amnestied, including political leaders from
Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili’s opposition coalition
Georgian Dream. Eka Beselia, the head of parliament’s Committee
for Human Rights, symbolically opened the doors of Gldani prison
in the capital, Tbilisi, and led prisoners out.  The amnesty bill was signed into law yesterday by
parliamentary Chairman David Usuphashvili after lawmakers
overturned President Mikheil Saakashvili’s veto on Dec. 28.  Billionaire Ivanishvili’s opposition coalition won
parliamentary elections on Oct. 1, defeating Saakashvili’s
United National Movement. Georgian Dream promised to restore
justice, raise living standards and improve relations with
 Russia . Georgia fought a war over its breakaway South Ossetia
region with its northern neighbor in August 2008.  The bill guarantees the release of 3,000 prisoners and a
reduction of sentences for thousands of other inmates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
