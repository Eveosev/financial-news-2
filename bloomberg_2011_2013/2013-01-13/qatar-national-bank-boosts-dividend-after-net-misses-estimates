Qatar National Bank SAQ (QNBK) , the largest
bank in the  Middle East  by assets, raised its dividend to 6
riyals a share as 2012 fiscal-year profit missed estimates.  The bank’s board recommended a cash dividend equal to 60
percent of the nominal share value, the lender said in an e-
mailed release. The bank paid a dividend of 40 percent of share
value in 2011 plus bonus shares of 10 percent. Full-year profit
rose 11 percent to 8.3 billion riyals, the bank said. The mean
estimate of 10 analysts was for a fiscal-year profit of 8.45
billion riyals, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Their were “no major surprises except sharp dividend
hike,”  Jaap Meijer , director of equity research at Dubai-based
Arqaam Capital Ltd., said today in an e-mailed note to
investors. The increased dividend was “well ahead” of their
forecast for payment of 4.64 riyals a share, he wrote.  Qatar National Bank, majority owned by the government, is
expanding overseas amid an economic slowdown at home. The lender
is set to become the first Middle East bank with assets over
$100 billion after agreeing to buy 77 percent of Societe
Generale SA’s  Egypt  unit for $1.97 billion last month. The bank
is looking for a majority stake in one of Turkey’s top ten
banks, Chief Financial Officer Ramzi Mari said Dec. 13. The
lender received approval this month to open an office in China.  Qatar National fell 1.7 percent to 138 riyals, the biggest
decline in more than a year, on the Qatar Exchange today before
results were released.  To contact the reporter on this story:
