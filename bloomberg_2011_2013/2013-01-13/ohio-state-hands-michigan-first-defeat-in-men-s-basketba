Ohio State University  defeated
archrival University of Michigan 56-53 to leave no unbeaten
men’s teams at college basketball’s top level.  The 15th-ranked Buckeyes, who led by as many as 21 points
at Value City Arena in Columbus, improve to 13-3 overall and 3-1
in Big Ten conference play. The second-ranked  Wolverines  drop to
16-1 and 3-1 in the  Big Ten  after a ninth straight loss at Ohio
State.  The defeat for the Wolverines comes after No. 1  Duke 
yesterday lost for the first time this season, 84-76 at No. 20
North Carolina State. The Wolverines haven’t been ranked No. 1
since the 1992-93 season.  Michigan was attempting to set a new school record for the
best start to the season after also beginning the 1985-86
campaign with 16 straight wins.  To contact the reporter on this story:
