Greek government spokesman Simos Kedikoglou condemned a fire bomb attack on his brother’s house
late yesterday in central  Athens .  “By targeting relatives and small children, the devotees
of violence only strengthen our will,” Kedikoglou said today in
an e-mailed statement.  Unknown assailants broke into the central Athens house of
George Kedikoglou at 11:15 p.m. yesterday, while he was at home
with his wife and three-year-old child, and threw Molotov
cocktails, causing material damage, state-run NET TV  reported .  “The entire political class must unequivocally condemn
without exception the attempt to propagate terror in our
society,” Simos Kedikoglou said.  In similar attacks early on Jan. 11, unidentified
perpetrators threw makeshift bombs made from propane gas
cannisters into the homes of five Greek journalists working for
national media. An anarchist group claimed responsibility,
saying it was to protest coverage of the country’s financial
crisis seen as sympathetic to the government, according to NET
TV. Simos Kedikoglou condemned the attacks at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
