The start of the women’s
quarterfinals tonight has been delayed by mist at the  U.S. Open .  Three-time champion  Serena Williams  of the U.S. and
Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, the 17th seed from  Russia , were about
to begin their match at Arthur Ashe Stadium when they were
called off the court.  Two men’s quarterfinals and four men’s four-round matches
were wiped out today, a day after all scheduled matches were
postponed by the rain.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
