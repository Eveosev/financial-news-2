ArcelorMittal (MT)  dismissed almost 5
percent of its workforce at a unit in the Brazilian state of
 Minas Gerais  because of reduced demand for domestically-produced
steel, O Estado de S. Paulo reported, citing a note from the
company.  ArcelorMittal dismissed 45 workers from the plant in Juiz
da Fora, citing foreign steel imports as one of the main reasons
for the fall in demand, O Estado said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
