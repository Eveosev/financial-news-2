Anglo American Plc (AAL)  decided against a
takeover offer for  Macarthur Coal Ltd. (MCC) , the Australian miner
that’s the target of a A$4.8 billion ($5.1 billion) bid from
 Peabody Energy Corp. (BTU) , said two people familiar with the process.  Anglo, part owner of the world’s biggest platinum and
diamond producers, weighed a bid for Macarthur and studied its
finances, said the people, who declined to be identified as
deliberations were private.  The decision increases the chance Peabody and its partner
ArcelorMittal will take control of Macarthur, whose board agreed
to a sweetened offer from the pair last week. They are pursuing
Brisbane-based Macarthur, the largest maker of pulverized coal
used by steelmakers, as prices for the material surge.  Martin Debelle, a partner at Sydney-based Citadel, the
media relations firm for Macarthur, declined to comment. Anglo
also wouldn’t comment in an e-mailed reply to a query today.  Anglo American gained 64 pence, or 2.7 percent, to 2,447
pence by 9:28 a.m. in London trading. Macarthur rose 0.1 percent
to A$15.97 by the 4:10 p.m. close in Sydney, below the current
offer of A$16 from St. Louis-based Peabody and  ArcelorMittal. (MT)   The companies originally offered A$15.50 a share for the
Australian miner in July, which Macarthur rebuffed as too low.  To contact the reporters on this story:
