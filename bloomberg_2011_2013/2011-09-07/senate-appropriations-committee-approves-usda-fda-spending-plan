The  Senate Appropriations Committee 
approved $19.8 billion in discretionary funding for agencies
including the Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug
Administration for the next fiscal year, a cut of 0.7 percent
from current spending.  The bill, which funds programs including food safety and
rural development, allots 16 percent more than the House of
Representatives called for in June. The cost estimate for the
measure doesn’t include funding for programs required by law.  U.S. spending bills are being constrained by concerns over
the size of the federal budget deficit. A 12-member
congressional supercommittee created in August as part of the
agreement to raise the national debt limit faces a Nov. 23
deadline to come up with recommendations for $1.5 trillion in
budget savings over 10 years.  “This is a very austere measure,” Committee Chairman
Herb Kohl, Democrat of Wisconsin, said at today’s meeting.  FDA spending for fiscal year 2012 was set at $2.497
billion, up 2 percent from this year. The USDA’s Food Safety and
Inspection Service, responsible for monitoring the nation’s meat
supply, would receive $1.007 billion, unchanged from 2011.  Savings came partly from the Women, Infants and Children
Program, which was cut 2.3 percent to $6.582 billion because of
lower projected participation rates, and from the National
Resources Conservation Service, where spending would decline 4.9
percent to $828 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
