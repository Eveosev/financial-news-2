Ukraine’s economy ministry wants the
government to extend duties on grain exports until the end of
the current marketing year, First Deputy Economy Minister Vadym Kopylov said.  The government will discuss an extension along with the
possible introduction of duties on exports of sunflower oil and
soybeans, Kopylov said in an interview with Ukrainian news
agency  Unian  published today on the government’s  website . The
minister gave no schedule for the Cabinet to make a decision.  The government imposed duties of 9 percent for outbound
wheat shipments, 12 percent for corn and 14 percent for barley
as of July 1 after lawmakers voted to scrap export quotas.  Ukraine may export 5 million metric tons of grain to the
European Union in the current marketing year, which began July
1, Kopylov said. The country may ship 2 million tons to Egypt
and an equal amount to Iran, 2.6 million tons to  Saudi Arabia , 1
million tons to Bangladesh and 1.5 million tons to  Israel ,
according to the minister.  Ukraine is also in talks with  Japan  concerning grain
exports, Kopylov said. The Asian nation is the top global corn
importer, and Egypt is the largest buyer of wheat.  To contact the reporter on this story:
