Peermont Global Holdings Ltd. is
part of a group bidding to buy the Royal Swazi Sun hotel chain
in  Swaziland , Peermont Chairman Paul Nkuna said.  “Peermont would like to manage the asset on behalf of the
consortium and take a minority stake for ourselves,” Nkuna said
in a mobile-phone interview today, declining to give more
details on the transaction.  Sun International Ltd. Chief Executive Officer David
Coutts-Trotter declined to comment when contacted on his mobile
phone today. Sun International will exit Swaziland because
refurbishment costs for its operations there “aren’t
justifiable,” Coutts-Trotter said in an Aug. 29 interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
