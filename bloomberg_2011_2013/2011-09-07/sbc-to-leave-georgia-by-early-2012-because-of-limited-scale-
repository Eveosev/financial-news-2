HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  said it will leave
Georgia’s banking market by early next year after carrying out a
strategic review.  “In Georgia we have limited size and scale,” Guy Lewis,
chief executive officer of HSBC Bank Georgia, said yesterday in
an e-mailed statement. “Despite considerable efforts in the
country, we feel now is the right time to withdraw from the
market.”  HSBC, which announced this year that it would exit retail-
banking operations in Russia and  Poland , began working in the
former Soviet republic in June 2008, Nutsa Datuashvili, a
marketing manager for the London-based bank said today by phone
from the capital, Tbilisi. It will continue operating in
neighboring Armenia, where it has been for 12 years, she added.  There are 19 commercial banks working in  Georgia ’s banking
industry, 15 of which are controlled by foreign lenders,
according to Aug. 1 figures from the central bank website. Their
combined assets are $6.8 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
