Flour Mills of Nigeria Plc (FLOURMIL) , which
processes grains and sells cement, plans to raise as much as 28
billion naira ($179.3 million) in a rights offer, according to
Chief Executive Officer Emmanuel Ukpabi.  The company received shareholder approval for the plan at
its annual general meeting held today in the commercial capital,
Lagos, he said from the city. Flour Mills will use the money to
diversify into new markets including power generation, Ukpabi
said, without commenting further.  Shares in the company were unchanged at 76 naira as of the
2:30 p.m. close in Lagos today, having gained 10 percent so far
this year. That compares with a 13 percent decline by the
Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share Index over the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
