France ’s  National Assembly , the
lower house of parliament, cleared a plan to offer Greece more
financial support and give the euro area’s stability fund more
flexibility in supporting financially distressed countries.  The Assembly is the first European parliament to adopt the
package, the  Finance Ministry  said in Paris. European Union
leaders agreed on the plan on July 21 in Brussels.  The package gives the European Financial Stability Facility
the power to buy government debt, help troubled banks and offer
credit lines to governments. It also sets aside 160 billion
euros ($225 billion) to support Greece and eases the terms of
that country’s bailout loans.  “The July 21 summit is historic because it provides a
second support package for  Greece ” and increases the
flexibility of the fund, Finance Minister  Francois Baroin  told
lawmakers when introducing the bill yesterday. “At France’s
side,  Germany  will soon begin the procedure of adopting the
decisions of the summit.”  Germany’s top court today cleared the way for Chancellor
Angela Merkel’s coalition to participate in the current euro-
area rescue plans, while saying it must seek some additional
parliamentary approval for payouts under the funds. The
Bundestag, Germany’s lower house, will begin debating the
package tomorrow and a vote is scheduled for Sept. 29.  The law passed by the Assembly will be discussed by the
French Senate tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
