Google Inc. (GOOG) , which moved its Chinese
search-engine service offshore last year to avoid the country’s
online censorship rules, said China’s government renewed the
company’s Internet license.  “We can confirm that the government has renewed our ICP
license,” Google said in an e-mailed statement today, without
elaborating. The company owns the world’s most popular search
engine.  Google has been losing market share in China’s search
market to Baidu Inc. since January 2010, when the Mountain View,
California-based company said it was no longer willing to comply
with China’s requirements for Websites to self-censor content.
Two months later, Google redirected Chinese users to an
unfiltered site in  Hong Kong .  China, the world’s largest Internet market with 485 million
Web users at the end of June, bans pornography, gambling and
content critical of the ruling Communist Party. It already
blocks Google’s YouTube site as well as social-networking
websites run by Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
