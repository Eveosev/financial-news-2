CityPlace Retail LLC, the developer
of a mixed-use condominium, restaurant and retail project in
West Palm Beach, Florida, was sued in a foreclosure action after
allegedly defaulting on a $150 million mortgage.  The partnership, one of whose partners is New York-based
Related Cos., has been in default since Feb. 22, according to a
lawsuit filed Sept. 1 in Florida state court in West Palm Beach.
The plaintiff is CSMC 2007-C1 South Rosemary LLC, which
represents a commercial mortgage-backed securities fund managed
by Miami Beach, Florida-based LNR Partners LLC, a special
servicer of the loan, according to the complaint.  “CityPlace is not immune to the issues that have affected
a large portion of the securitized commercial loans that were
made in the peak of the market,” Joanna Rose, a spokeswoman for
Related, said in an e-mailed statement on behalf of the
partnership.  CityPlace Partners hopes to continue discussions to ensure
the long-term success of the complex, according to the
statement.  The case is CSMC 2007-C1 South Rosemary LLC v. CityPlace
Retail LLC, 11-013227, Palm Beach County Court, Florida (West
Palm Beach).  To contact the reporters on this story:
