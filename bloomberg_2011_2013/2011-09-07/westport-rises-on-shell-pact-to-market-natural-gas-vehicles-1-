Westport Innovations Inc. (WPT)  rose the
most in almost three years after the maker of natural-gas
engines said it’s working with  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  to market
the benefits of liquefied natural gas-powered vehicles to
consumers.  Westport, which has not reported an annual profit since its
initial public offering in 1997, rose $4.42, or 19 percent, to
$27.24 at 4 p.m. in Nasdaq Stock Exchange composite trading, the
biggest gain since November 2008. The shares have risen 47
percent this year.  The companies said they will focus their marketing on  North
America  initially. Westport, based in Vancouver, develops truck
engines. Shell, based in The Hague, is Europe’s largest oil
company.  “As a result of this initiative, we believe the use of
natural gas as a fuel for transportation will accelerate,”
David Demers, Westport’s chief executive officer, said in the
statement.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
