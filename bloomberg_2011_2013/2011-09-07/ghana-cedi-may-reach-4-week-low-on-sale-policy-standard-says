Ghana ’s cedi may depreciate to the
lowest level in four weeks against the dollar by the end of this
week if the central bank doesn’t sell the U.S. currency,
Standard Bank Group Ltd.’s local unit said.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
is expected to lose as much as 0.4 percent by Sept. 9 from
yesterday’s close of 1.5330 per dollar, Chris Nettey, a currency
trader at Stanbic Bank Ghana Ltd., said by phone today from the
capital, Accra. A 0.4 percent decline would take the cedi to
1.5391 per dollar, the weakest level on a closing basis since
Aug. 12, when it closed at 1.5398 per dollar, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  This would be the third week in which the central bank has
refrained from selling dollars, Nettey said. Adams Nyinaku, head
of treasury at the central bank, didn’t answer a call to his
mobile phone today.  “I expect the cedi to lose grounds against the dollar if
the central bank should continue to stay out of the market, as
demand pressures have started picking up mostly by importers
ahead of the Christmas festivities, which has been the trend,”
Nettey said.  The cedi retreated for a third day, losing as much as 0.4
percent to 1.5395 per dollar, before trading 0.1 percent down at
1.5343 as of 12:43 p.m. in Accra.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
