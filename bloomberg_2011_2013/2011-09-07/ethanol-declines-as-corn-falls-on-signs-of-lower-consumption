Ethanol futures declined in  Chicago 
as corn fell on signs of slowing export demand.  Futures fell a second day as corn, the primary ingredient
used to make the fuel in the U.S. slid. Ukraine said today that
its August grain exports quadrupled from July. The report came a
day after Agritel said  France ’s corn harvest may rise to between
14.5 million and 15 million metric tons this year.  “Corn kind of broke that $7.50 level, but we had a very
strong day in energies,” said Justin Dirico, senior ethanol
trader at SCB & Associates LLC in Chicago.  Denatured ethanol for October delivery decreased 0.7 cent,
or 0.3 percent, to $2.809 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Futures have gained 48 percent in the past year.  Ethanol prices were buoyed by higher crude oil and
gasoline, Dirico said.  “We had some refinery issues,” he said. “So ethanol
remained strong.”  In cash market trading ethanol on the West Coast advanced 9
cents, or 3.1 percent, to $3.025 a gallon and in  New York  the
additive jumped 4 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $2.975, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf added 3 cents, or 1 percent, to
$2.975 a gallon and in Chicago the biofuel rose 2.5 cents, or
0.9 percent, to $2.85.  Crude oil for October delivery surged $3.32, or 3.9
percent, to $89.34 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
Prices have swelled 21 percent in the past year.  Gasoline for October delivery jumped 8.54 cents, or 3
percent, to $2.908 a gallon in New York. The contract covers
reformulated gasoline, which is made to be blended with ethanol
before delivery to filling stations.  Corn for December delivery fell 7.75 cents, or 1 percent,
to $7.48 a bushel in Chicago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
