Blackthorn Resources Ltd. (BTR) , an
Australian mining company, is considering more joint projects in
Africa with Glencore International Plc. as it expects supply
tightness in the next few years to boost zinc prices.  “We could considerably do some jointly funded operations
with Glencore,” in the area near the Perkoa zinc mine in
 Burkina Faso , Scott Lowe, chief executive officer of the Sydney-
based company, said in an interview in Melbourne today.  Zinc prices will increase as some mines in  Australia ,
 Canada  and Namibia are due to close in 2013 and 2014, Lowe said.
The Perkoa mine, 50 percent owned by Glencore and 40 percent by
Blackthorn, will start producing in June 2012, with an annual
capacity of 90,000 tons of contained metal, he said.  Glencore wants to increase the mine’s capacity by 40
percent and add silver and lead production, he said.  Blackthorn hasn’t held any talks with Glencore, its largest
shareholder with 13 percent ownership, about increasing its
stake, he said. “The company is not for sale,” Lowe said.  Glencore gained 2.3 percent to close at 385.2 pence in
London trading yesterday. Blackthorn shares rose 1 percent to
49.5 Australian cents in Sydney trading today. The stock has
fallen 20 percent this year.  The price of zinc, used to galvanize steel, has dropped 9.5
percent this year.  Barclays Capital  said last month global
production may exceed demand by 290,000 metric tons this year
and by 338,000 tons in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
