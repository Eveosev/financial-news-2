The following is a roundup of soccer
stories from U.K. newspapers, with clickable links to the Web.  Torres Worries  Chelsea coach Andre Villas-Boas said he’s warned striker
 Fernando Torres  that he’ll be dropped from the team should he
continue to struggle to score goals,  the Mirror said .  The London club spent 50 million pounds ($80 million) to
buy the Spaniard from Liverpool last season. The new manager
said Torres will be in the squad for tomorrow’s visit to
Sunderland, but must regain confidence to return to scoring, the
newspaper said.  Newcastle Criticism  Newcastle coach  Alan Pardew  said supporters are right to
criticize the team for its failure to sign a new striker after
selling Andy Carroll in January,  the Sun said .  The coach said the team’s board made a financial decision
after he presented them with several candidates, the newspaper
said.  Arsenal Target  Arsenal is looking at  Argentina  midfielder Lucas Biglia,
who joined Anderlecht in 2006,  the Daily Mail said.   The 25-year-old was a member of Argentina’s Copa America
team, and was watched during Anderlecht’s last match by scouts
for the Gunners, the newspaper said.  Carroll’s Lifestyle  Liverpool manager  Kenny Dalglish  defended Andy Carroll
after England coach Fabio Capello said the striker “needs to
improve, to drink less,”  the Mirror said .  Dalglish said the player, who was signed for 35 million
pounds from Newcastle, said it was unfair to discuss the
player’s lifestyle, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
