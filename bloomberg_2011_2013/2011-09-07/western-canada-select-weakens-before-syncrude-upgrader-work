The discount for Western  Canada 
Select weakened and the Syncrude’s premium strengthened before
the start of a turnaround at Syncrude Canada Ltd.’s  Alberta 
upgrader on speculation the work will boost heavy oil supplies.  Syncrude Canada will start about 45 days of planned coker
work tomorrow, according to a person with knowledge of the
plans. Output will be reduced by 4 million to 5 million barrels
during maintenance scheduled to begin in September or October,
Canadian Oil Sands Ltd Chief Executive Officer Marcel Coutu said
April 28.  The company is the largest stakeholder in the Syncrude
joint venture. Upgraders convert heavy oil into light, sweet,
synthetic crude.  Western Canada Select’s discount to West Texas Intermediate
widened $1 to $9 a barrel at 12:16 p.m. in  New York , according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The premium for Syncrude widened 50 cents to $12 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
 tar sands  in Alberta.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium was unchanged at $32 a
barrel, while Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium increased 10 cents
to $29.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend added 50 cents to $28 while Poseidon strengthened 15 cents
to $27.75 a barrel over WTI.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium added 50 cents to $26.50 a
barrel. West Texas Sour’s discount widened 10 cents to 80 cents.
Thunder Horse’s premium added 25 cents to $29.25 above the
benchmark.  To contact the reporter on this story:
