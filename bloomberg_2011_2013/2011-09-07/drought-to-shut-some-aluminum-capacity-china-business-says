Some Chinese aluminum smelters in
mountainous southwestern regions will partly closed because of
power shortages caused by a worsening drought, the China
Business News reported today.  Guangxi Baise Yinhai Aluminum Industry Co. has received
notice from the local government to partly shut down to save
energy, the report said, citing an official at the plant it
didn’t name. The company, with 200,000 metric tons of annual
capacity, has reduced output by 40 percent, it said. A call to
the company was not answered.  Guangxi Aluminum’s capacity accounts for 4 percent of the
national total, the report said. Smelters in Yunnan and Guizhou
provinces may also receive notices to cut output, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
