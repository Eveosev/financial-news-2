It’s “unclear” whether the Swiss
central bank’s move to cap the franc’s gains will be successful,
and it’s too early for  Japan  to follow suit, according to Mizuho
Corporate Bank Ltd.  The Swiss National Bank yesterday imposed a ceiling on the
franc of 1.20 versus the euro, the first such move in more than
three decades, and pledged to defend the target with the
“utmost determination.”  “The SNB’s fight has just begun,” said Daisuke Karakama,
a market economist in  Tokyo  at the unit of Japan’s third-largest
financial group by market value. “It’s unclear whether the bank
will be able to keep it up and end up being successful. Will the
SNB continue doing it no matter how much they incur in currency
losses? It will be a test of perseverance.”  It’s too early to expect that Japan will follow  Switzerland 
before the success of the Swiss central bank’s move has been
demonstrated, Karakama said.  The franc traded at 1.2041 per euro as of 2:08 p.m. in
Tokyo from 1.2069 yesterday in  New York .  The only option now remaining for the SNB to take is
capital control, Karakama said. “In a situation like this,
capital control would be possible,” he said.  It’s unlikely that Switzerland will abandon its own
currency and join the euro just to eliminate deflation risks in
the near term, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
