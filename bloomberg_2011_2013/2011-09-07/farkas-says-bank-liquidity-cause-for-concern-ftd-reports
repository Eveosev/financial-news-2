Adam Farkas, an  executive director 
at the European Banking Authority, said national banking
supervisors need to closely monitor lenders’ liquidity
positions, the  Financial Times Deutschland  reported.  Farkas said supply of liquidity is currently difficult for
a number of banks, though it’s not a risk or emergency at the
moment, the newspaper said, according to the e-mailed preview of
an interview that will appear in tomorrow’s edition.  The European Banking Authority won’t be in a position to
implement systematic liquidity stress tests of banks until 2013
at the earliest, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story: Ragnhild Kjetland in
