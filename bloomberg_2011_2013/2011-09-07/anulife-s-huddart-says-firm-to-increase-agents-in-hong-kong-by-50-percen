Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC) ,  Canada ’s
largest insurer, seeks to boost the number of agents selling
insurance, pension and mutual-fund products in  Hong Kong  by
about 50 percent.  The firm has about 4,600 independent agents exclusively
selling products in the city and wants to increase that to about
7,000 by 2015, said Executive Vice President Michael Huddart,
who heads the Hong Kong unit for Toronto-based Manulife.  “We’ve had a history of trying to grow that agency,
primarily through new people joining the industry,” Huddart,
54, said yesterday in a telephone interview from Hong Kong.
“We’ve also seen people move from other companies, and we’ve
been a net winner in that game.”  Huddart said Hong Kong is among the largest profit
contributors in Manulife’s  Asia  unit, which reported net income
of C$623 million ($630 million) last year. Chief Executive
Officer Donald Guloien, 54, aims for annual profit from Asia to
reach C$1.5 billion by 2015.  Hong Kong produced insurance sales of $50 million in the
second quarter, a 10 percent increase, while wealth-management
sales from the country were up 45 percent to $254 million,
Manulife said in August. The firm has operated in  Hong Kong  for
more than a century and has about 1.6 million clients there,
Huddart said.  Manulife also wants to “grow the relationships” with
about 200 advisers and financial companies it already does
business with in Hong Kong, Huddart said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
