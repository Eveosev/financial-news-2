European governments need to act on
pledges to aid  Greece  and strengthen the euro rescue fund
instead of picking them apart, European Union President  Herman Van Rompuy  said.  “Implementing rather than unpicking what we have agreed is
vital,”  Van Rompuy  said at the London School of Economics
today. Saying he believes in “quiet diplomacy,” he didn’t
accuse countries by name of dawdling on approval of the July 21
crisis-management agreements.  Finland’s insistence on collateral poses an obstacle to the
next set of Greek loans, and Slovakia’s backing of the enhanced
rescue fund may be delayed past Europe’s end-of-September target
by domestic politics.  Van Rompuy endorsed calls for more regular meetings of
euro-area leaders, noting that since the outbreak of the banking
crisis in 2008 the biggest decisions have been made at the top
level.  “It is a good idea to meet more regularly, and not only in
periods of tension,” he said.  The euro remains fundamentally sound, with the euro-area
economy marked by low inflation, an external balance and less
aggregate debt than the U.S. or  Japan , Van Rompuy said.  At the global level, he identified U.S. and Japanese debt
and China’s “undervalued exchange rate” as issues to tackle.  To contact the reporter on this story:
