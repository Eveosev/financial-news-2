Facebook Inc., the world’s most
popular social-networking service, named  Erskine Bowles , a
member of former President Bill Clinton’s  administration, as a
director, expanding the board to seven members.  Bowles, who most recently served as co-chair of President
Barack Obama’s bipartisan National Commission on Fiscal
Responsibility and Reform, was White House chief of staff under
Clinton from 1996 to 1998, the company said today. Bowles also
was president of the  University of North Carolina  system from
2006 to 2010.  “Erskine has held important roles in government, academia
and business which have given him insight into how to build
organizations and navigate complex issues,” said Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive officer of Facebook, in a statement.
“Along with his experience founding companies, this will be
very valuable as we continue building new things to help make
the world more open and connected.”  Facebook is expanding its board while preparing to either
disclose financial data or hold an initial public offering by
April. The company said in June that Reed Hastings, chief
executive officer of Netflix Inc., joined the board.  Bowles is also a director of bank holding company  Morgan
Stanley (MS) , rail transportation provider  Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC)  and
retailer  Belk Inc. (BLKIA)   To contact the reporter on this story:
