OAO Rosneft,  Russia ’s largest oil
producer, has gained approval from the antitrust regulator to
acquire two companies with licenses in the country’s southern
 Black Sea  and Arctic Barents Sea.  A Rosneft subsidiary was cleared to buy Russian billionaire
Vladimir Lisin’s Black Sea oil explorer ZAO Chernomorneftegaz
and Arctic explorer ZAO Sintezneftegaz, the Federal Anti-
Monopoly Service said today on its  website .  Both closely held oil explorers have faced limitations on
development since Russia introduced laws restricting offshore
oil and gas production to state-owned companies, such as Rosneft
and OAO Gazprom. Sintezneftegaz has spent $80 million on
exploration in the Arctic and in  Africa , according to the
company  website .  Rustam Kazharov, a Rosneft spokesman, was not immediately
available for comment when Bloomberg News phoned his mobile
phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
