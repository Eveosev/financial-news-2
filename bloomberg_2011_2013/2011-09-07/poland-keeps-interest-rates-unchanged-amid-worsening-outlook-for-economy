The Polish interest rates may remain
unchanged in the coming quarters as inflation slows amid
weakening economic growth, the central bank’s rate-setting
Monetary Policy Council said.  The  Narodowy Bank Polski  kept the seven-day  interest rate 
at 4.5 percent for a third meeting this month, relying on four
quarter-point rate increases in the first half of the year to
tame price growth. Policy makers said slowing economic growth
will help bring inflation to within the bank’s 2.5 percent
target in the medium term, according to minutes from the Oct. 4-
5 meeting.  Some council members argued that in subsequent quarters,
interest rate increases are more likely than cuts, especially if
inflation remains above the target for a period longer than
currently anticipated “due to the depreciation of the zloty
triggered by turmoil in international financial markets,”
according to the minutes.  Some indicated that a potentially “significant” slowing
of growth in  Poland  as a result of weaker economic activity
abroad may, given the expected decline in inflation, justify a
reduction of interest rates in the future, the bank said.  The inflation rate fell to 3.9 percent in September from
4.3 percent in August. That data were released after the Oct. 4-
5 rate-setting meeting.  To contact the reporters on this story:
