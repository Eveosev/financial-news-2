Indianapolis Colts quarterback
 Peyton Manning  will miss the first game of the season because of
slow progress in his rehabilitation from neck surgery, ESPN
Radio in New York is reporting, citing a taped interview with
team vice chairman Bill Polian.  Manning, 35, a four-time National Football League Most
Valuable Player who agreed to a five-year, $90 million contract
in July, has started 227 consecutive games, including the
postseason. That’s the second-longest streak in NFL history
behind  Brett Favre .  The Colts visit the Houston Texans on Sept. 11.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
