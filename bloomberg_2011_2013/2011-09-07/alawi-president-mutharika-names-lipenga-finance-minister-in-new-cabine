Malawian President Bingu wa Mutharika named Ken Lipenga as finance minister, replacing Ken Kandodo in a new, smaller cabinet, following protests demanding
a cut in state spending.  Mutharika also fired Vice President Joyce Banda and
included his wife Callista Mutharika in a 30-member executive,
the presidency said in a statement read out on Blantyre-based
Malawi Broadcasting Corp. radio. Lipenga was tourism minister in
the previous cabinet.  Mutharika disbanded his 42-member cabinet on Aug. 19, a
month after protests by civil society groups against his
government and shortages of fuel and foreign currency. Nineteen
people died in the southern African nation in clashes with
police during demonstrations on July 20 and 21.  The groups, including the Malawi Law Society and the
Council of Churches, called off a second round of demonstrations
planned for Aug. 17 to allow time for talks with the government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
