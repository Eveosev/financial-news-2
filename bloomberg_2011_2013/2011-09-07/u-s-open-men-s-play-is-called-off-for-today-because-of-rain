U.S. Open officials still aim to
play the four women’s quarterfinals scheduled for tonight after
today’s men’s matches were called off because of continuing rain.  Four men’s fourth-round matches and two quarterfinals were
scheduled for today. Rain wiped out play yesterday at the
season’s final Grand Slam tennis tournament.  “Due to the lingering rain, the day session has been
canceled,” the U.S. Tennis Association said in a statement.
“Every effort will be made to play tonight’s evening session,
which will feature all four women’s quarterfinals.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
