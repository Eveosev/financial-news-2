In May, almost 10 years after he engineered the bloodbath of Sept. 11, Osama bin Laden was finally hunted down and executed by U.S. forces in his hideout in Abbottabad,  Pakistan . The news had personal significance for  many in India . More than  30 Indians  were killed in the attack on the World Trade Center; some worked in the building, others were aboard the ill-fated airplanes that were flown into the towers. More generally, there was relief that the curtain had come down on the career of one of the world's most poisonous ideologues. Bin Laden's efforts to stoke a jihad among Muslims worldwide through a toxic cocktail of conspiracy theory, megalomanic fantasy, literal and reductive readings of Islamic scripture, and rabid anti-Americanism and anti-Semitism, had never found much currency in India. But there is no doubt that  India 's Muslim population, the world's third-largest, has suffered some of the ill-effects of the demonization of Islam across the world in the last decade, including hostility from the country's powerful Hindu right-wing. Last, there was little surprise in India that bin Laden had been discovered in a military town in Pakistan, so close to the shadowy halls of power. Indeed, the site of bin Laden's death was, if anything, even more meaningful than the fact of his death, and stripped bare the naivete of the U.S. decision to make Pakistan an ally in the "war on terror." In contrast to the U.S., the decade after the attacks has involved, for India, the protracted experience of terror. In the immediate aftermath of Sept. 11, it had been hoped in India that there would now be greater unity and coordination among the world's two largest democracies in fighting Islamist terrorism in all its forms. India also expected that Washington would take a tougher line with Pakistan in the effort to bring peace and stability to  South Asia , a dangerous flashpoint that is home to two nuclear powers. New Delhi also hoped Pakistan would end its practice of giving  safe refuge to terrorists  involved in acts such as the  Mumbai bomb blasts of 1993  and the  hijacking of an Indian airplane in 1999 . Instead, to borrow a phrase that has come into fashion in this decade, India's internal security has become part of the collateral damage of America's military and strategic response to the terror attacks. In a long, but not especially surprising, series of reverberations, the U.S. decision to use Pakistan as an ally to destroy the Taliban in  Afghanistan  and hunt bin Laden has greatly strengthened the army in Pakistan at the expense of the now-tottering state. It also has  supplied Pakistan with funds  that have been funneled not just into the war in Afghanistan, but into terror plots aimed at India with the cooperation of Islamist groups such as the  Lashkar-e-Taiba  and the Jaish-e-Mohammed that enjoy the patronage of the Pakistani establishment. As Joseph Fitsanikis wrote in a piece called " An Embrace Without Trust " in the Indian political journal Pragati last year: Thus it is that over the last decade, as Americans have absorbed -- and to some extent come to terms with -- the shock of Sept. 11, Indians have watched with dismay as their country suffered several major terrorist strikes with their origins across the border in Pakistan, including the attack on the  Indian Parliament  in December 2001; the Mumbai bomb blasts of 2003 and 2006; and the attacks in 2008 by armed gunmen, who were in  telephone contact  with their handlers in Pakistan, on Mumbai's Taj Mahal hotel, Trident hotel, and a crowded railway terminus. On each occasion, the Indian government eschewed a military response at the urging of the U.S. But it has become increasingly clear that, not for the first time, U.S. policy in the  Indian subcontinent  has been catastrophically self-involved and short-sighted. It might even be argued that Washington is fighting its "war on terror" by agreeing, effectively, to fund and then turn a blind eye toward terrorism against other targets. As Christopher Hitchens wrote in a characteristically plainspoken piece in  Vanity Fair  in July: Writing in the  Wall Street Journal  in June, the Indian foreign-policy analyst Nitin Pai succinctly summarized the case against the cosseting of Pakistan through financial aid in exchange for military support and intelligence. Pai wrote: India and Pakistan have been antagonists since they were carved out of the British empire in 1947. Yet they also share a great deal in terms of history, culture and language. Even when I was growing up in the 1980s and 1990s, both countries were obsessed with each other, as if unable to forget the bloodbath of Partition that marked both their founding and their fracture. This pride was also the reason that they were unwilling to budge an inch on the standoff over Kashmir. But as democracy has settled in India -- something that the military establishment has never permitted in Pakistan -- and Indians have seen the world open to them and the economy take off after the  liberalization of the economy in 1991 , Pakistan's hold on the Indian imagination has fallen away. Most Indians today genuinely desire, if only from self-interest, that their neighboring state become a stable and peaceful democracy, so that both countries -- which between them host a substantial chunk of the world's poorest people -- may turn their attention to the many challenges of economic development and social reform that lie before them. Yet Pakistan's establishment has much to gain by keeping a low-intensity war against India simmering, and India rightly holds that there can be no dialogue between the two countries as long as Pakistan continues to export terror across its borders. One of the legacies of Sept. 11 has been to exacerbate this state of affairs. The columnist Vir Sanghvi wrote in a piece in the  Hindustan Times  last year: This is an obsession often situated at a great distance from reality. Earlier this month, several Pakistani newspapers, including  The Dawn ,  The Daily Times , and  Pakistan Today  ran an Agence France-Presse piece from Abbottabad, " Pakistanis in denial 10 years after 9/11 ": So, if the world's largest democracy could say one thing to America about Sept. 11 and its aftermath, it would be a request for America not to penalize India for being a peaceful, multicultural democracy, and to practice a foreign policy more in keeping with America's purported antipathy to terrorism universally and commitment to political freedom. There would also be a warning from India about America's own  addiction to militarism , the subject of a perceptive piece in this month's  Atlantic Monthly . (India might consider a similar warning when it comes to the state of Kashmir, one of the world's most militarized zones.) It wasn't in America's power to prevent the Sept. 11 attacks, but when it comes to the matter of Washington's response to that cataclysm, most Indians, including a great number who would like democracy and the rule of law take root in Pakistan, would say that an urgent course correction is required.
