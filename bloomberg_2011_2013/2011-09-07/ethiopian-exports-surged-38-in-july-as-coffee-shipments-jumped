(Corrects period in headline, qhat production in second
last paragraph.)  Exports from Ethiopia,  Africa ’s
biggest coffee producer, surged 38 percent in the year through
July 7 as shipments of the beans jumped, the Trade Ministry
said.  Total exports amounted to $2.8 billion in the period, the
ministry said in a statement released yesterday in  Addis Ababa ,
the capital.  Coffee was the Horn of Africa nation’s biggest revenue
earner, raising $841.7 million from 196,118 metric tons of beans
shipped. Last year, the country exported 172,210 tons for $528.2
million, the ministry said. The increase was driven by a 40
percent rise in global coffee prices in the period, Helaway
Tadesse, senior vice president at Zemen Bank in Addis Ababa,
said in an e-mailed response to questions today.  Gold shipments increased by 75 percent, bringing in $485.3
million from 11 tons of the precious metal.  “Based on the direction of gold prices, and various
prospecting projects in the pipeline, mining exports could in a
couple years time eclipse coffee and other agricultural products
as  Ethiopia ’s primary exports,” Helaway said.  The third-largest earner was oil seeds, though the 323.9
million earned was a drop of 9.5 percent from the previous year,
according to the Trade Ministry. The narcotic leaf qhat, which
is popular in neighboring Somalia and Yemen, saw a 14 percent
increase in revenue, earning $238.4 million from shipments of
40,973 tons.  While Ethiopia’s exports are still an “unusually low” 8
percent of gross domestic product, the performance was “very
strong and one which played a key part in removing foreign
exchange shortages within the banking system last past year,”
Helaway said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
