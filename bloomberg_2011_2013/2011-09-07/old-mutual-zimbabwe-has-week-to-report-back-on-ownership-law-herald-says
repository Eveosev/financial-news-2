Old Mutual Zimbabwe Ltd. has seven
days to say how it will comply with the country’s new ownership
law, the Herald reported, citing Indigenization and Empowerment
Minister  Saviour Kasukuwere .  The insurer will face unspecified consequences if it
doesn’t meet the deadline, the Harare-based newspaper cited
Kasukuwere as saying.  Foreign companies are expected to sell a 51 percent stake
in local assets to Zimbabweans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
