Oil options volatility decreased as
the underlying futures erased two days of declines in  New York 
to climb the most in four weeks as a weather system threatened
to reduce U.S. production from the  Gulf of Mexico .  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
October, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 40.8 percent at 1 p.m. in New York,
down from 44.2 percent yesterday.  Oil for October delivery surged $3.35, or 3.9 percent, to
$89.37 a barrel at 2:06 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The futures have fallen 2.1 percent this year.  The most active contract in electronic trading today was
October $95 calls, with 2,279 lots changing hands. The options
rose 19 cents to 32 cents a barrel. October $90 calls, the next-
most active contract, gained $1.13 to $1.89 with 1,664 lots
trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  Puts outnumbered calls by 53 percent to 47 percent in
electronic trading on the Nymex.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information on floor trading, where the
bulk of options trading occur the next business day.  October $80 puts were the most active options traded in the
previous session, with 6,209 lots changing hands. They fell 6
