U.S. companies have reached a
“tipping point” that will shrink earnings growth and profit
margins, according to  Albert Edwards , a global strategist at
 Societe Generale .  The shift has occurred because labor costs have started
rising faster than prices as the economy struggles to expand,
Edwards wrote yesterday in a report.  The CHART OF THE DAY illustrates how he reached this
conclusion: by comparing the year-to-year percentage changes in
unit labor costs and a business-price deflator. Both indicators
are compiled by the Labor Department.  Average labor expense for every unit of output increased
1.9 percent last quarter from a year earlier, while the deflator
for businesses other than farms rose 1.8 percent. The labor-cost
gauge climbed more than prices for the first time since 2008.  “That is very bad news for profits,” Edwards wrote. It’s
also “bad news for equities” and for the  Federal Reserve ,
which may have to deal with accelerating inflation as companies
seek to maintain margins by raising prices, he added.  Edwards has predicted the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index will
drop to 400, a 66 percent plunge from yesterday’s close. He has
also called for the yield on 10-year Treasury notes to drop to
1.5 percent, down from 1.97 percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
