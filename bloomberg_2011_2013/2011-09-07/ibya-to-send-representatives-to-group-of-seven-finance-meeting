Libya ’s new leaders will send
representatives to a meeting of finance ministers from the Group
of Seven this week, seeking reconstruction help after ousting
dictator  Muammar Qaddafi , French officials said.  Libya will be an observer at the Sept. 10 meeting in
Marseille, the officials said. It is likely to be included in
the so-called “Deauville Partnership,” named after the French
town where the world’s leading industrial countries pledged in
May to help Arab countries build democratic societies.  Morocco and Jordan have joined initial members Tunisia and
Egypt since the initiative was launched at the summit at the
Normandy resort May 27.  Multilateral development banks such as the  World Bank  and
the  European Investment Bank  said then they would raise $20
billion for Tunisia and Egypt through 2013 to help underpin
their economies after popular revolutions ousted authoritarian
regimes.  Jordan and Morocco’s kings have announced steps toward
allowing more democratic representation. In Libya, Qaddafi was
overthrown after a six-month conflict in which North Atlantic
Treaty Organization fighter jets backed rebel forces.  The four countries, as well as development banks, will each
present “action plans” in Marseille. The meeting is not a
pledging conference, said the French officials, who briefed
reporters on the condition they not be named.  To contact the reporters on this story:
