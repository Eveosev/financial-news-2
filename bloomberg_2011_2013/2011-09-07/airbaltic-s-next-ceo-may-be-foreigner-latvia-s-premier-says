AirBaltic AS, the Latvian airline
majority owned by the state, may see its next chief executive
officer come from outside the country, Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis said.  “The next director could be from abroad,” said
Dombrovskis on the Latvian Independent Television program  900
Seconds  today. The next CEO has to be internationally known and
an industry professional who is ready to return the company to
profitability, said Dombrovskis.  The government yesterday reached a preliminary agreement
with the airline’s minority shareholder to increase the capital
of AirBaltic by as much as 70 million lati ($139 million) and to
change the management of the airline. The government had
demanded that current CEO Bertolt Flick, a German national, be
removed as a condition for any increase in capital.  Flick yesterday called a press conference for today in
Berlin, which he later canceled. The airline’s CEO left  Latvia 
after the company’s office was searched by the anti-corruption
bureau in May.  The increase in capital is needed after the airline lost
34.2 million lati last year and continued losses at the
beginning of this year. Latvia plans to lower its  budget deficit 
to 2.5 percent next year so it can adopt the euro in 2014.  The state owns 52.6 percent of AirBaltic while Baltic
Aviation Systems has 47.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
