Former Bank of England policy makers
Sushil Wadhwani and DeAnne Julius led calls for Prime Minister
 David Cameron  to scrap Britain’s top 50 percent income-tax rate.  A  letter  signed by 20 economists in today’s Financial Times
says the levy introduced by the previous Labour administration
to help cut the  budget deficit  is hurting economic growth by
discouraging entrepreneurs.  “We are concerned that Britain’s 50p income tax is doing
lasting damage to the U.K. economy,” they wrote. “It gives the
U.K. one of the highest personal tax regimes in the
industrialized world, making it less competitive internationally
and making us less attractive.”  Other signatories include Bob Rowthorn of the University of
Cambridge, Danny Quah of the  London School of Economics  and
Bridget Rosewell of Volterra Consulting.  Julius said the 50 percent rate risks leading to more firms
such as  hedge funds  moving to other countries. “It’s something
of a tipping point if you know that half the income you earn is
going to be taken by the government,” she said in an interview
with  BBC television .  Most British voters are opposed to scrapping the 50 percent
rate, which applies to annual incomes above 150,000 pounds
($240,000). A poll by ComRes Ltd. On Sept. 5 showed 57 percent
want the levy to stay. Sixty-seven percent of Liberal Democrats,
the junior partners in the coalition government, opposed
abolishing the rate. ComRes surveyed 1,000 adults by phone Sept.
