The politburo of Yemen’s ruling
party agreed that President Ali Abdullah Saleh can issue a
decree allowing the vice president to negotiate with the
opposition, a party member said.  The decree will give the “necessary constitutional power”
to Vice President Abduraboo Mansur Hadi to hold talks with the
opposition, which agreed to a Gulf Cooperation Council-brokered
plan on a  power transfer  in Yemen, Sultan al-Barakani, assistant
secretary general of the ruling General People’s Congress, said
in a phone interview today.  The transition plan is aimed at halting six months of
unrest and ensuing economic decline in the Arab world’s poorest
country, which has been used as a base by al-Qaeda.  The objective of the talks “is to agree on a timeline for
the GCC to implement a mechanism, under regional and
international supervision, to lead to an early presidential
election,” al-Barakani said. “The election date can be agreed
on in a way to ensure a peaceful and democratic transfer of
power.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
