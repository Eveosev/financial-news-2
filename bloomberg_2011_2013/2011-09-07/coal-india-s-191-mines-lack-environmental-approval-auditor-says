Coal India Ltd. (COAL) , the world’s largest
producer of the commodity, is operating 191 old mines without
environment approval, the country’s national auditor said.  The mines without approval are part of 239 mines that
existed before 1994, the Comptroller and Auditor General of
 India  said in a statement today. State-owned Coal India operated
470 mines as of March 31, according to the auditor.  Coal India Chairman Nirmal Chandra Jha could not be
immediately reached for comment.  The company is currently fighting a court battle with the
Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board, which last month
ordered closure of 22 mines that need environment approval from
the federal government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
