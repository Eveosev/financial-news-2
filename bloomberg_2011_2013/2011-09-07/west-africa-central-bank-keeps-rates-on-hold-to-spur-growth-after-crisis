The  Central Bank of West African
States  kept its key lending rates unchanged to help support
economic growth in the region following the end of the political
crisis in  Ivory Coast .  The marginal lending facility rate was held at 4.25
percent, the minimum open market rate at 3.25 percent and the
bank reserves requirement at 7 percent, the bank, based in
Senegal’s capital, Dakar, said in an e-mailed statement today.  “The recovery remains fragile,” given the “magnitude of
resources necessary for the recovery of activity” in Ivory
Coast, the bank’s Monetary Policy Committee said.  Ivory Coast is recovering from a violent post-election
crisis that ended in April, which may see its economy, the
biggest in the union, contract by 5.8 percent this year,
according to the  Finance Ministry . Growth in the eight-member
West African monetary union is expected to reach 1 percent this
year before recovering to 5.3 percent in 2012, the central bank
said today.  Inflation in the region is easing, giving the central bank
room to keep  interest rates  unchanged. The inflation rate will
probably average 3.6 percent in the third quarter, down from 4.8
percent in the previous three months, the bank said.  The union’s member nations, which includes Senegal, Ivory
Coast and Mali, expect the central bank to support “strong and
inclusive economic growth, indispensable for reducing youth
unemployment,” Governor Tiemoko Meyliet Kone said before the
MPC meeting.  Other members of the Economic and Monetary Union of West
Africa are Niger, Togo, Benin,  Burkina Faso  and Guinea-Bissau.  To contact the reporter on this story:
