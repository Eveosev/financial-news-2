Boiron SA (BOI) , a French maker of
homeopathic remedies, fell the most since at least 1989 in Paris
trading after reporting a slump in first-half earnings.  Boiron declined 6.80 euros, or 25 percent, to 20.10 euros.
The stock’s loss was the biggest since at least Nov. 17, 1989,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  First-half operating profit plunged 93 percent to 686,000
euros from 9.2 million euros a year earlier, the company said in
a statement late yesterday. Sales in the second quarter declined
3.3 percent.  “The uncertainties tied to the economic environment lead
us to being prudent as to the outlook for the year,” Boiron
said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
