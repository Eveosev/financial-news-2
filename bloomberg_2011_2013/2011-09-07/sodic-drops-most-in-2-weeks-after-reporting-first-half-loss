Six of October Development &
Investment (OCDI)  Co., an Egyptian luxury real-estate developer, fell
the most in almost two weeks after reporting a first-half loss
compared with a profit last year.  Shares of the Cairo-based company retreated 1.6 percent to
17 pounds at 12:55 p.m. in Cairo, the biggest intraday decline
since Aug. 25. The benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  was little changed.  The company also known as Sodic said today it had a first-
half loss of 120 million Egyptian pounds ($20 million), compared
with a 50.7 million-pound profit for the same period last year.
The company said Aug. 28 it plans to buy back 1 million shares
at 18 pounds each by Sept. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
