Japanese stocks rose for a second
day as the earnings outlook for Asian exporters brightened on
President Barack Obama’s plan to inject more than $300 billion
into the  U.S. economy  and signs Europe’s debt crisis is easing.  Inpex Corp. (1605) , the country’s No. 1 energy explorer, gained
4.5 percent as oil traded near the highest close in more than a
month.  Tokyo Electron Ltd. (8035) , the world’s No. 2 maker of
semiconductor equipment, gained 3 percent after a jump by the
Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, which tracks the performance
of 30 industry stocks.  Fanuc Corp. (6954) ,  Japan ’s biggest maker of
controls used to run  machine tools , dropped 3.4 percent after
Japan’s machine orders fell more than economists expected.  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average rose 0.3 percent to 8,793.12
at the 3 p.m. trading close in Tokyo, after rising as much as
1.3 percent. The broader Topix index gained 0.5 percent to
757.41, after gaining as much as 1.3 percent.  “People are boosting their expectations for whatever could
happen in the U.S.,” said  Kenichi Hirano , general manager and
strategist at Tachibana Securities Co. in  Tokyo . “The Nikkei
average has risen toward those expectations, but it’s unlikely
to move further until actual data comes out.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.4 percent
today. In  New York , the index rose 2.9 percent yesterday as
President Obama prepared to unveil proposals for promoting job
growth in an address to a joint session of Congress today. He
plans to propose injecting more than $300 billion into the
economy next year, mostly through tax cuts, infrastructure
spending and direct aid to state and local governments.  Bernanke ‘Outlook’  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  today is set to
speak to the Economics Club of  Minnesota  on “The U.S. Economic
Outlook.”  Stocks also rose after Italian Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  won a confidence vote on austerity measures and
 Germany ’s top court rejected challenges to the participation of
 Europe ’s largest economy in euro-rescue funds, easing concern
about Europe’s debt crisis.  “Concerns about the U.S. and Europe are easing for now,”
said  Mitsushige Akino , who oversees about $600 million in Tokyo
at Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co. “Foreign investors’ risk
sentiment is rebounding, judging from a sharp increase in oil
futures. The bias is for stocks dependent on foreign demand,
especially export-related ones, to be bought.”  The Topix has slid 16 percent this year with the price of
shares on the index falling to 0.89 times estimated book value,
near the lowest since March 2009. Concern the U.S. economy may
slip into a recession and Europe’s debt crisis is worsening have
damped demand in two of Japan’s largest export markets.  Miners Advance  Mining firms gained the most among the 33 groups on the
Topix Index as crude for October delivery traded at $89.44 a
