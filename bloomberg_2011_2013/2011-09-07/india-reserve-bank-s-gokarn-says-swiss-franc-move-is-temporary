Reserve Bank  of India Deputy
Governor Subir Gokarn comments on  Switzerland ’s central bank’s
move to cap the franc’s gains. The Swiss National Bank yesterday
imposed a ceiling on the franc of 1.20 versus the euro, the
first such move in more than three decades, and pledged to
defend the target with the “utmost determination.”  Gokarn spoke to reporters in Mumbai.  “Switzerland has decided that the burden of inflows as a
result of the turbulence around them is putting pressure on
their currency in a way that is disrupting their real sector. So
they have decided to react.  ‘‘The underlining view is that this is a transitory phase
and this is not in any way an abandonment of their fundamentally
floating  exchange-rate  system. It is an attempt to deal with
temporary factors.  ‘‘Our view on exchange rate management is essentially the
same. We are looking to not target the exchange rate.  ‘‘If there is pressure of any kind that disrupts the real
sector we would consider intervention. We have not faced that
situation so far, so our stance remains.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
