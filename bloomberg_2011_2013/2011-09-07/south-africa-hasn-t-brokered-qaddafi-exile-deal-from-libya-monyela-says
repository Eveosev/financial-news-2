South Africa  hasn’t brokered any
deal enabling Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi ’s exile,
International Relations Ministry spokesman Clayson Monyela said.  The London-based  Times newspaper  reported that the southern
African nation brokered an agreement where Qaddafi passed
through Niger to temporary exile in  Burkina Faso , citing an
intelligence official that it didn’t identify.  South Africa “doesn’t know what the Times is talking
about,” Monyela said by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
