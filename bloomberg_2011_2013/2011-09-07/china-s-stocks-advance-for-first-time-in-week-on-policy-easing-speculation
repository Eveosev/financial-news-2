Motor Corp., the nation’s biggest listed automaker, advanced 3.6
percent after sales increased. Baoshan Iron & Steel Co. jumped
the most in two weeks after the same newspaper said the
government will support parts of the  steel industry .  “The speculation on easing monetary policy is prevailing
in the market and caused the stock rebound,” said  Li Jun , a
strategist at Central China Securities Co. in Shanghai. “That
may get support from the inflation data later this week.”  The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of

bills from banks in open market operations or cutting the
required reserve ratio for banks, the China Securities Journal,
which is operated by the official Xinhua News Agency, said in a
commentary. Inflation may drop, reducing the need for reserve-
ratio increases, the newspaper said.  China will release inflation data for August on Sept. 9.

Management’s index of non-manufacturing businesses increased to
