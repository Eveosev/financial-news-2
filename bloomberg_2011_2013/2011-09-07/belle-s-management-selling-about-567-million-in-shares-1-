The chairman and management at  Belle
International Holdings Ltd. (1880) , China’s largest retailer of women’s
shoes, are selling about $567 million in shares.  The shares of the Hong Kong-listed company are being
offered at HK$15.28 to HK$15.70 apiece, according to a term
sheet for the sale obtained by Bloomberg News. That’s a discount
of as much as 6 percent from its last closing price.  Morgan
Stanley (MS)  is a joint bookrunner for the sale.  The retailer, whose brands include Joy & Peace and
Staccato, has gained about 24 percent in Hong Kong trading this
year, compared with a 13 percent drop in the city’s benchmark
 Hang Seng Index . Belle had more than 13,000 outlets in mainland
China at the end of June, and reported a 29 percent increase in
net income for the first half of the year last month.  The company also warned then that  China ’s increasing wages
and material costs may eat into profit margins. Net income in
the six months through June rose to 2 billion yuan ($310
million), while sales climbed 25 percent to 13.9 billion yuan.  The term sheet didn’t disclose the name of the chairman
selling Belle’s shares. Chief Executive Officer Sheng Baijiao
was appointed acting chairman of the company after Chairman Tang Yiu suffered a stroke in April. Representatives at the retailer
didn’t immediately respond to a call made outside regular
business hours.  Sheng said last month that Belle may increase the number of
stores by 15 percent this year. The retailer also had more than
160 stores in  Hong Kong  and Macau at the end of June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
