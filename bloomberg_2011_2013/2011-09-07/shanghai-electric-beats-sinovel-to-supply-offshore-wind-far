Shanghai  Electric Group Co., a maker
of electric equipment, won a bid to supply turbines to a 100-
megawatt offshore wind farm in the city, beating Sinovel Wind
Group Co.,  China ’s biggest producer of the equipment.  The winning bid involves supplying 26 wind turbines of 3.6
megawatts each at about 4,790 yuan ($749) a kilowatt, Zhang Bo,
senior commercial manager of unit Shanghai Electric Windpower
Equipment Co., said today in a phone interview. That’s 1.3 times
the average turbine price for onshore wind projects in China in
the second quarter, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  Sinovel offered to supply 6-megawatt turbines at 5,298 yuan
a kilowatt for the second phase of the East China Sea Bridge
wind farm, while XEMC Windpower Co., a unit of Xiangtan Electric
Manufacturing Co., bid 8,000 yuan a kilowatt, Zhang said.  China’s goal of installing 30 gigawatts of offshore  wind
energy  by 2020 has prompted turbine makers to develop larger
machines. Building work on the project by a unit of China Datang
Corp., the nation’s second-biggest power producer, is expected
to begin by the end of the year, Zhang said. Datang’s unit also
built the 102-megawatt offshore wind project near the East China
Sea Bridge in Shanghai, with 3-megawatt turbines from Sinovel.  XEMC’s press office and Wei Xiaojing, a spokeswoman for
Sinovel, didn’t respond to telephone calls seeking comment.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
