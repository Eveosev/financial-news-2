Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  partner
 Dinakar Singh  discovered in 2001 that his 19-month-old daughter,
Arya, had a crippling genetic disease called spinal muscular
atrophy.  The malady makes the nerve cells that control muscles
gradually deteriorate. There are no treatments, let alone a
cure, Bloomberg Markets magazine reports in its October issue.
Worse still, while the gene causing the ailment had recently
been discovered, nobody in the drug industry was doing much
about it, he says.  “I was fearful and anxious that treatments would be
developed, but far too late to save Arya,” says Singh, 42, who
founded and runs New York hedge fund TPG-Axon Capital Management
LP, which has $8.1 billion in assets. “We didn’t want to find
out 25 years later that the science was really there but there
isn’t a drug because nobody focused on it.”  Singh, who left Goldman in 2004, has spent almost $100
million of his own money to create and fund the Spinal Muscular
Atrophy Foundation. He wants to discover and develop a drug that
he hopes will help his daughter, who is one of 25,000 SMA
patients in the U.S. Children with severe forms often die within
a few years, while those with mild cases can live a normal life
span with supportive care. Arya, 11, and starting sixth grade,
uses a wheelchair.  ‘High-Speed Initiative’  Singh’s foundation is making progress. It’s collaborating
with  Novartis AG (NOVN) , which may bring a drug into human tests as
soon as 2013, says Mark Fishman, research chief for the Basel,
Switzerland-based drugmaker.  The foundation has pumped $13 million into PTC Therapeutics
Inc. in South Plainfield,  New Jersey , which has produced a pill
that increases the life span of mice with SMA. It also has
funded a scientist whose research has led to an injectable drug
developed by  Isis Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ISIS)  of Carlsbad,  California .
That treatment may enter human trials before year’s end. Singh
says he’ll enroll Arya if that drug gets to the testing phase
before others.  “The SMA Foundation has converted this from a slow-moving
exercise to a high-speed initiative,” says Darryl De Vivo, a
pediatric neurologist at  Columbia University Medical Center  in
 New York , who has overseen Arya’s care since her diagnosis.  Frustrated with the sluggishness, or nonexistence, of
medical research, Singh and a small band of wealthy parents
whose children have serious illnesses are spending millions of
dollars to fund drug development.  ‘Change the System’  These benefactors include hedge-fund managers, private-
equity investors and entrepreneurs, many of whom have made their
fortunes on  Wall Street . The principles they apply in their jobs
-- managing complicated tasks, making investments and expecting
positive results -- translate to their new endeavors, says Stacy Palmer, editor of the  Chronicle of Philanthropy .  “Business executives have a better understanding of how
markets work and have started to ask tougher questions,” Palmer
says. Their goal: “Change the system and whatever is slowing it
down.”  The new philanthropists are building on a foundation laid
by well-known predecessors. John D. Rockefeller in 1901 formed
the medical research institute that would become New York’s
 Rockefeller University  after his grandson died of scarlet fever.
Billionaire Michael Milken, who pioneered junk bonds, founded
the Prostate Cancer Foundation and FasterCures, a think tank to
speed progress toward cures in all medical fields.  ‘Lots of Shovels’  Microsoft Corp. co-founder  Bill Gates  and his Bill &
Melinda Gates Foundation have focused on malaria, polio and
other global health threats.  James Simons , founder of hedge fund
Renaissance Technologies LLC, and his wife, Marilyn, started the
Simons Foundation. It’s the second-biggest funder of autism
research, after the U.S. National Institutes of Health,
according to recent data.  Benefactors such as Singh are taking a direct role in early
drug research. They want to make it easier for companies to
produce a medicine or venture firms to fund it. They begin with
basic research discoveries, often in obscure illnesses, and
advance the work. Instead of handing money to scientists and
getting out of the way, they stay involved, hire experts and
push researchers to work together rather than compete.  “We have focused on having lots of shovels ready and
having the maps ready and having all the supplies ready, so
companies are willing to prospect for SMA drugs,” Singh says.
His idea: “Make it easy for companies, take the risk down for
them so they can get a sense cheaply and easily whether there is
something there.”  Arya’s Efforts  Even Arya is doing her bit. In her family’s 11th-floor
condominium that looks north over New York’s Central Park, she
says she’s excited about holding a bake sale to raise money for
SMA research. She has just returned from precautionary tests to
make sure a respiratory infection didn’t become serious. Her
mother pats her back when she coughs weakly. Then Arya scoots
off in her wheelchair to play with her younger brother and
sister.  James O’Sullivan , director of foundation services for
 Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors , says about half of his 25
medical philanthropy clients at any time are interested in the
hands-on approach Singh’s foundation is taking, up from a
handful 15 years ago.  “There is a world of difference between 10 years ago and
now,” says O’Sullivan, whose New York-based organization
advises wealthy patrons. “Today’s donors are much more
interested in seeing how their dollars make a difference in a
disease.”  New Breed  Victoria Jackson, a cosmetics entrepreneur whose husband,
Bill Guthy, co-founded direct marketer  Guthy-Renker LLC , is
among the new breed. Her daughter, Ali, came down with a central
nervous system disorder at age 14 called neuromyelitis optica,
which can cause blindness.  Since then, Jackson has spent more than $15 million on her
foundation to develop treatments. Ali, now 18, has avoided
severe complications by taking immunosuppressants.  Jackson says scientists often work independently with their
own agendas, wasting money.  “I manage where every dime goes and make sure there is
complete disclosure and collaboration among the researchers,”
she says.  Private Investors  Private investors may become crucial as drugmakers cut
research and close labs, O’Sullivan says.  Pfizer Inc. (PFE) , the
world’s largest drugmaker, will spend $6.5 billion to $7 billion
on research in 2012, down from $9.4 billion in 2010. That makes
working with a foundation that already has done some of the
grunt work attractive.  “Drug companies want to come in later in the R&D process
and provide backing for potential therapies that have more
evidence behind them than in the past,” O’Sullivan says.  Singh says his foundation can focus on the science because
it doesn’t have to invest huge amounts of time raising money.
And with no need to impress donors, the organization can spend
on the business of developing lab tests and building the pieces
that make it easier for companies to discover SMA drugs.  The foundation’s $16 million in research spending last year
almost equals the $19 million the NIH spent on spinal muscular
atrophy.  Novartis saved years by taking advantage of advances made
by foundation-backed scientists and the laboratory techniques
they developed to test compounds for SMA. The company was able
to focus on screening for drugs rather than diverting staff to
basic research, says Daniel Curtis, a research manager at
Novartis.  Rich Donors  The SMA Foundation and its academic partners may reap a
benefit if a Novartis drug reaches the market and sells well.
Singh’s foundation could get back a multiple of its spending on
the collaboration, says Karen Chen, the organization’s chief
scientific officer, who declined to give specifics. Any money
would allow the foundation to reinvest in science, she says.  As an incentive for Novartis to work quickly, an agreement
allows the company to repay nothing if it completes clinical
trials fast enough.  Rich donors with a personal stake in a disease, while well-
meaning, can divert resources from illnesses that may be closer
to a cure or afflict more people, says Arthur Caplan, a
bioethicist at the  University of Pennsylvania  in Philadelphia.  “There can be some kind of distortion of emphasis,” he
says.  SMA affects 25,000 Americans versus 5.4 million for
Alzheimer’s disease, according to the SMA Foundation and the
Alzheimer’s Association.  Head Start  Singh says spinal muscular atrophy is more likely to be
treatable than common neurological diseases such as  Alzheimer’s ,
whose origin is uncertain. He says he wouldn’t have spent as
much money if he thought an SMA treatment was a long shot.
Scientists already know what causes SMA, giving researchers a
head start, he says.  Garen Staglin, a senior adviser at San Francisco-based
private-equity firm FTV Capital, is tackling diseases that are
more widespread, including schizophrenia. Staglin’s
International Mental Health Research Organization has raised
$135 million for brain research during the past 17 years. It
hosts an annual music concert at his Napa Valley, California,
vineyard. Dionne Warwick was scheduled to headline a concert in
September.  Staglin’s son, Brandon, now 39, was diagnosed with
schizophrenia in 1990. Staglin was in  France  on business and got
a call that police had pulled Brandon over as he drove
erratically.  “He told me he felt like he had lost half his brain,”
Staglin recalls. “He just lost his ability to think
coherently.”  ‘Run Toward It’  Rather than hide Brandon’s situation, Staglin acted.  “We decided we had two choices: We could either run away
from the problem like too many families with these illnesses,”
he says. “We wanted to run toward it.”  Another effort, Staglin’s  One Mind for Research , is working
with former Rhode Island Congressman Patrick Kennedy to get drug
companies and brain researchers to collaborate on treatments for
Alzheimer’s, autism, schizophrenia and other conditions. This
effort is based on the joint-research approach that has long
been used in the semiconductor industry.  For Alexander Silver, the motivation is his 4-year-old son,
Jackson. Silver, a partner at New York-based private-investment
firm P2 Capital Partners, LLC, started the  Jackson Gabriel
Silver Foundation  in 2010 to find a treatment for a rare genetic
condition called epidermolysis bullosa. In the disease, a
protein that holds skin layers together is missing, and the skin
blisters and shears off with any friction. Half of Jackson’s
body is covered in high-tech bandages that cost $6,000 a month.  Cutting Red Tape  Silver, 34, who has raised more than $400,000 since 2008
and aims for $10 million or more, predicts a good treatment will
come if money flows without red tape to the right projects. His
foundation -- along with one run by Paul Joseph, a private-
wealth broker at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC whose 7-year-
old son has the condition -- has backed work at the University
of  Southern California  in  Los Angeles . The research has produced
a potential drug.  The approach has garnered $26 million in venture capital
from Boston-based Third Rock Ventures to form a company and move
the therapy in human trials.  No Budget on Life  “The skills I developed professionally matter a lot for
this,” Silver says. “Just like investing, you are allocating
capital to the projects that have the highest probability of
success and the lowest probability of failure in the quickest
time frame.”  For Singh, the effort to save Arya is a family affair, and
he promises to spend as much money as necessary. Singh’s wife,
Loren Eng, has a Master of Business Administration from  Stanford
University  and works fulltime leading the foundation.  The eight-member staff includes former researchers from
 Roche Holding AG (ROG)  and Pfizer.  While Arya has a mild form of SMA, she has gotten weaker.
She has trouble lifting her arms above her head and needs
fulltime nursing. Every cold is a threat because her frail lung
muscles put her at risk for pneumonia.  “I don’t think there is a budget on your daughter’s
life,” Singh says. “As long as there is a chance of doing
something and we have the ability to do it, we will do it.”  ‘In Tears’  Singh, who won’t disclose his compensation, says his fund
returned 60 percent in the six-and-a-half years since he started
it on Feb. 1, 2005. That’s more than double the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index’s 25 percent return during the period.  Arya, the oldest of Singh and Eng’s three children, was
born in March 2000 and developed normally at first. She was slow
to walk, however, taking her first wobbly steps at 15 months.
Within months, she began regressing. A doctor friend saw Arya’s
stiff gait at a party in August 2001 and told them to get it
checked out right away.  Eng had become pregnant again, and two days before her
delivery date, she got an abrupt call from the neurologist
confirming the worst about Arya.  “Loren called me in tears,” Singh remembers. “I was
saying: ‘What does it mean? What does it mean?’ She said the
doctor didn’t say anything. She has SMA. That’s it.” Singh and
Eng spent the next days in a frantic race to figure out the
prognosis -- and to discover whether their second child, Kiran,
also had SMA. He didn’t.  ‘Untreatable, Incurable, Fatal’  “When we found out about it, we were told it was
untreatable, incurable and fatal,” Singh says.  De Vivo, the Columbia University neurologist, met the
couple and explained that children like Arya have defects in or
are missing a gene called SMN, discovered only in 1995. It
directs cells to make a protein necessary for neurons that
control muscles.  He introduced them to Columbia colleague Thomas Jessell, a
motor neuron biology expert. They also met Gerald Fischbach, a
neuroscientist and then dean of Columbia’s health sciences and
medicine faculty. All three became key advisers to the SMA
Foundation.  “I met them and decided that SMA was a perfect disorder to
mount a major attack on,” says Fischbach, who’s now scientific
director for the  Simons Foundation  Autism Research Initiative.
“The science was ripe.”  ‘Truly Solve It’  At first Singh and Eng had planned to back existing
charities, such as  Families of Spinal Muscular Atrophy . They
gave $750,000 in May 2002 to fund a clinic at Columbia. In 2006,
they agreed to give as much as $15 million to help fund a motor
neuron research center at the university.  The more they learned, the more they became convinced that,
unlike most neurological diseases, SMA might be conquered.  “What struck us as different about SMA was that there
really seemed to be a chance to truly solve it -- and perhaps
even in a time frame that could really help Arya,” Singh says.  A quirk in the genetics of SMA increased their hope. In
many inherited diseases, a crucial gene is missing or defective
and the protein it makes is absent or doesn’t work. In SMA, the
body has a backup gene that produces small amounts of the SMN
protein. That’s why children with the disease live at all.  By the time Singh and Eng became involved, an idea with
potential to help SMA sufferers was already being discussed in
the medical literature: If someone could find a chemical that
could safely boost the availability of the backup protein, that
discovery could form the basis of a drug. Yet as far as they
could tell, no large drug or biotech company was focused on SMA.  ‘Terrible Gap’  “You had this terrible gap,” Singh says. “There was no
one saying, let us take these interesting discoveries and come
up with something that could be a drug.”  The couple started the foundation in 2003. Equipped with
PowerPoint presentations that showed why SMA was a lower
research risk than most genetic diseases that could yield a drug
with $1 billion in annual sales, they approached more than a
dozen companies. It was a hard sell.  At the  American Academy of Neurology  conference in 2004,
only three of seven biotech companies they invited showed up.  “There was never an outright no,” Eng says. Instead,
“polite conversations went nowhere or calls were not
returned.”  To her, it seemed drugmakers were focused on heart disease,
cancer or diabetes and their significant commercial markets. The
NIH alone spends $5.8 billion a year on cancer research.  ‘A Buzz’  Singh and Eng started paying small biotech companies to
screen for chemicals that might increase the supply of the SMN
protein. They, along with other SMA charities, also funded
Adrian Krainer, a researcher at  Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory  on
 Long Island  in New York. He was working on a technology that had
shown some promise, even though the foundation’s scientific
advisers said the approach was a long shot.  “There was a buzz; there was this new couple, they are
very wealthy, people thought they were in a position to make a
difference,” says Krainer, who met Arya in 2002 when she could
still walk.  For the next few years, the foundation backed research
testing dozens of existing drugs to see if any of them increased
the SMN protein. The scientific advisers got together in 2008
for a meeting at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Half Moon Bay,
California.  “It was the most-depressing meeting ever,” Eng recalls.
“It was clear we had nothing.”  ‘Huge Implications’  By then, Arya was in a wheelchair. At this point, the SMA
Foundation had captivated Novartis. In 2002, the company had
appointed Fishman, a scientist and former  Harvard Medical School 
professor, to direct research operations.  He says one idea was that success in treating rare genetic
diseases might pave the way for dealing with more-common ones.
Columbia’s Jessell and Fischbach pitched him on SMA in 2005.  “It seemed tractable from a scientific point of view, with
potentially huge implications on health,” Fishman says.
“Others weren’t working on it, which is another good reason to
do it.”  Still, it wasn’t until November 2007 that Novartis began
its effort. It started with neurobiologist Rajeev Sivasankaran
and a few assistants. Sivasankaran, 41, designed a quick way to
test the more than 1 million compounds in Novartis’s collection
of chemicals to see if any had potential for SMA. A compound
with some modest effect could become a starting point for a safe
and effective medicine.  ‘Full-Court Press’  Novartis was lucky. By December 2009, the researchers had
found a drug that improved motor function in mice with SMA.  “That got the whole group excited,” Sivasankaran says.
The SMA Foundation and Novartis scientists get together every
three months to review progress. At a June 1 meeting,
researchers from the foundation, Novartis, Columbia and Harvard
crowded into a conference room to hear the latest results.  “It is a full-court press,” Fishman says. “We are
pushing as hard as we can.”  Still, Novartis human trials are two years off at best,
Fishman says.  Meantime,  Repligen Corp. (RGEN) , a Waltham, Massachusetts-based
biotechnology company, in July began an initial safety test of
its SMA drug on people. It licensed this drug from the charity
Families of SMA, based in Elk Grove Village,  Illinois .  More Efforts  Singh’s foundation is closing in with two more efforts. PTC
Therapeutics last year found compounds that boost the life span
of mice with the disease. The company could begin human trials
in late 2012, Chief Executive Officer Stuart Peltz says.  “It is absolutely incredible,” he says. Mice that would
otherwise barely be able to move look normal with PTC’s drug, he
says.  Singh and Eng say they’re particularly excited by Isis
Pharmaceuticals’ progress, based on work by Krainer at Cold
Spring Harbor. Isis published data in March showing that its
drug could boost motor neuron levels -- and survival -- in mice
with SMA. The medicine, which is injected into spaces around the
spine, corrects the defect that causes the backup gene to
produce too little protein.  “I have been doing drug development half of my life,”
says Roy Vagelos, former Merck & Co. CEO, who has followed the
SMA Foundation’s research. “This will be the first time if it
works that a family had gotten behind a problem, a genetic
defect in their own family, and come up with a solution.”  Arya is very aware of her illness and the battles to
conquer it, even though she doesn’t like to talk about it, Singh
says. She often asks her parents what her adult life will be
like and why she has to be sick.  “Trying to understand what this all means is a big deal
now,” Singh says.  Arya’s Homework  For a homework assignment last year on Egyptian mythology,
Arya imagined a goddess of illness.  “She thinks of cures for sicknesses and puts hints for
these cures in people’s minds,” Arya wrote. “She has a puppy
face, puppy paws, human body and is always thinking of cures.”
Eng sent a copy of her daughter’s essay to Novartis’s Fishman.  “It hits you right where you live,” he says. “That kind
of innocent gratitude is the most wonderful reward you can
get.”  To contact the reporters responsible for this story:
