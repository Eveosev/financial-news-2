The ruble gained against the dollar
for the first time in five days, rebounding from its lowest
level in four weeks, as oil climbed.  Russia ’s currency added 0.4 percent to 29.5150 per dollar
by the 7 p.m. close in Moscow, its first gain in a week. It
added 0.3 percent to 41.4350 per euro.  “With oil above $100, Russia is looking pretty good,”
Anton Strouchenevski, a Moscow-based economist at Troika Dialog
said by phone today. “Emotions that prevailed in August are
giving way to reason.”  Crude, Russia’s main export earner, gained as much as 3.9
percent to $89.33 a barrel in  New York  after the National
Hurricane Center said a weather system over southwestern  Gulf of
Mexico  may become a tropical cyclone. Other storms have already
reduced crude stockpiles in the U.S.  The movements against the dollar and the euro left the
ruble 0.3 percent stronger at 34.8790 against the central bank’s
target currency basket, which is used to manage swings that hurt
Russian producers. The basket is calculated by multiplying the
dollar’s rate to the ruble by 0.55, the euro to ruble rate by
0.45, then adding them together.  The ruble weakened to an average of 34.3710 against the
basket in August from 33.2951 in July, as concern the global
economy is flagging pushed the oil price lower. Russia’s
currency is likely to strengthen to at least its July levels
versus the basket this quarter, Strouchenevski estimated.  Non-deliverable forwards show the currency at 29.8025 per
dollar in three months. The contracts provide a guide to
expectations of currency movements and interest-rate
differentials and allow companies to hedge against currency
swings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
