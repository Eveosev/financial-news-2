Nigeria ’s naira slipped to the
lowest in 11 weeks against the dollar after the central bank
failed to meet lender’s demand for dollars for the 17th straight
foreign-currency auction.  The currency of sub-Saharan Africa’s second-biggest economy
declined 0.2 percent to 153.15 naira per dollar at the auction,
its weakest level since an auction on June 22. It retreated 0.3
percent to 156.15 naira per dollar in interbank trading by 2.38
p.m. in Lagos, the lowest since Jun. 23, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The central bank sold $400 million, compared with $438
million demanded by lenders, the Abuja-based central bank said
in an e-mailed statement.  Africa’s biggest oil producer has used foreign currency
reserves to keep naira within a 3 percentage-point band above or
below 150 naira per dollar at its bi-weekly auctions to help
check inflation.  “Banks are demanding dollars for sale to customers and
foreign exchange bureaus above what is supplied by the central
banks, thereby weakening naira,” Babatunde Obaniyi, currency
analyst with Lagos-based Afrinvest West  Africa  Ltd, said in a
phone interview from Lagos.  The central bank of Africa’s most populous country said on
Aug. 19 it removed the $1 million weekly limit on currency sales
by banks to increase dollar supply and help stabilize the local
currency, the naira.  Nigeria’s annual inflation rate fell to 9.4 percent in
July, the lowest level in more than three years, the National
Bureau of Statistics said on Aug. 16. Central Bank Governor,
Lamido Sanusi said today, he is determined not to let inflation
get out of control and that the August rate was probably the
same as July’s 9.5 percent and below 10 percent.  Foreign-currency reserves stood at $32.3 billion by Sept. 2
compared with $36 billion a year earlier, according to central-
bank data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
