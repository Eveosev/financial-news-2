Chile reported an August trade
surplus of $491 million, the smallest since October, on record-
high imports, the central bank said.  Exports climbed 23 percent to $6.9 billion from the year
earlier, including $3.6 billion of copper, while imports leaped
28 percent to $6.4 billion, the bank said on its website today.
The median estimate of nine economists surveyed by Bloomberg was
for a surplus of $1.1 billion.  Oil imports rose 60 percent from a year earlier, and 16
percent from July, to $663 million. Imports of capital goods
increased an annual 37 percent and 8 percent from July to a
record $1.07 billion.  The world’s biggest copper producer posted an accumulated
trade surplus of $9.7 billion in the eight months through
August, the bank said. Chile will post a current account balance
of zero in 2011 and a trade surplus of $15 billion, the central
bank said in its June monetary policy report.  The peso climbed 0.4 percent to 462.03 per  U.S. dollar  at
7:34 a.m. New York time from 463.90 yesterday.  Chile’s copper output, which slipped 2.2 percent in the
first half to 2.57 million metric tons, will decline in 2011
after snowstorms and strikes hit mines owned by  BHP Billiton
Ltd. (BHP)  and state-owned Codelco, Mining Minister Hernan de Solminihac said in a Sept. 5 interview in Sydney.  Copper prices will average $4.15 a pound this year after
averaging $3.42 a pound in 2010, the central bank said in its
June report. Policy makers will publish new forecasts in a
report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
