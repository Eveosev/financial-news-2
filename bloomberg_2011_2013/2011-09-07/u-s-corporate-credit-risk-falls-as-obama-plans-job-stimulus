A benchmark gauge of U.S. corporate
credit risk fell for the first time this month as equities
rallied amid speculation President  Barack Obama ’s plan for more
than $300 billion in economic stimulus will boost growth.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, fell 4.8 basis points to a mid-
price of 121.8 basis points as of 3:55 p.m. in  New York ,
according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd.  Traders pushed the index lower and stocks higher as Obama
is seeking to spark job growth through proposed tax cuts,
infrastructure spending and direct aid to state and local
governments. The credit swaps index, which typically falls as
investor confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates,
reached 126.8 on Aug. 22, the highest level in more than a year.  “There is no conviction,”  Mikhail Foux , a credit
strategist at Citigroup Inc. in New York, said in a telephone
interview. “We’re bouncing in this trading range and trading off
economic data in the U.S. and further developments in  Europe ,”
Foux said.  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
