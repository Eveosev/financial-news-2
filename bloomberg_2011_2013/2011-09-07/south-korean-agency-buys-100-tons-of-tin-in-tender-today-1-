South Korea ’s Public Procurement
Service, a state-run body that manages strategic commodities,
bought 100 metric tons of tin ingots in a tender, according to a
notice on the agency’s website today.  The service bought the metal with purity of more than 99.9
percent from Korean trader  Hanwha Corp. (000880)  at $800 a ton more than
the London Metal Exchange official cash settlement price, the
notice showed. Shipment is due by Nov. 11.  Three-month delivery tin traded on the LME increased 1
percent to $24,095 a ton at 3:58 p.m.  Seoul  time. The industrial
metal used in soldering has declined 10 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
