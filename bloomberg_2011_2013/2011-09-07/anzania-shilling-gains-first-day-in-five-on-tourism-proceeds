Tanzania’s shilling strengthened for
the first time in five days as inflows of the dollar increased
because of tourism to the country.  The currency of  East Africa ’s second-biggest economy gained
as much as 0.7 percent to 1,613.8 per dollar and traded 0.4
percent up at 1,618.75 by 2:08 p.m. in Dar es Salaam, the
commercial capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “We have seen inflows of dollars coming in from the
tourism sector today which caused the slight appreciation,”
said Eric Chijoriga, a trader with National Bank of Commerce
Ltd., ABSA Group’s Tanzanian unit. “We however do not expect
the appreciation to stay a long time because we are seeing
customers position themselves to buy dollars,” he said.  Tourism’s total contribution to the country’s gross
domestic product is expected to increase to 13.4 percent by 2021
from 12.9 percent now, the World Travel & Tourism Council said
on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
