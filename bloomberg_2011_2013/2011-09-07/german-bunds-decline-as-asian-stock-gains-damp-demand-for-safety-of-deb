German bunds dropped the most in a
week as stocks rose and the nation’s top court backed the
government’s participation in euro-area bailouts, reducing
demand for the region’s safest assets.  Italian and Spanish bonds rallied, with Italy’s 10-year
yields falling the most since the  European Central Bank  began
buying the nation’s debt on Aug. 8. Greek 10-year bond yields
climbed above 20 percent for the first time as finance chiefs
from three of the region’s AAA rated countries failed to break a
deadlock over  Finland ’s demands for collateral in return for
aiding the nation.  “This could have been a hurdle for approval of the
European Financial Stability Facility,” said Norbert Aul, a
European interest-rate strategist at  RBC Capital Markets  in
London. The German court decision “offers short-term support to
peripherals,” he said, referring to bonds from the euro
region’s most indebted nations.  German 10-year bund yields climbed six basis points to 1.91
percent at 4:17 p.m. in London, the biggest increase since Aug.
31. They fell to a record 1.824 percent yesterday. The 2.25
percent securities due September 2021 dropped 0.590, or 5.90
euros per 1,000-euro ($1,404) face amount, to 103.045. Two-year
yields advanced six basis points to 0.49 percent. They slipped
to an all-time low 0.417 percent yesterday.  The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index added 2.6 percent and the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 1.9 percent.  Suits Rejected  The Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe threw out
suits targeting Germany’s share of the 110 billion euros in
loans for Greece from euro-region governments and the
 International Monetary Fund , as well as a separate 750 billion-
euro rescue fund approved last year to halt the spread of the
Greek debt crisis.  The court said the ruling shouldn’t be seen as “blanket”
approval for future rescue participation, and the government
must seek approval from the parliament’s budget committee for
new guarantees it assumes under the EFSF.  Spain ’s 10-year bond yields fell 18 basis points to 5
percent, and two-year rates dropped 24 basis points to 3.42
percent.  Italy ’s 10-year bond yields declined 26 basis points to
5.24 percent, while two-year yields dropped 33 basis points to
3.87 percent.  The ECB began purchasing Spanish and Italian bonds on Aug.
8 to curtail a surge in yields as contagion from the debt crisis
that engulfed Greece, Ireland and  Portugal  infected the euro
region’s third- and fourth-largest economies.  Italian Budget  Italy may need a new budget-adjustment plan next month
because a 54 billion-euro ($76 billion) austerity package to be
voted on today won’t convince the ECB to keep buying the
nation’s bonds, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee
said today.  “How long can the ECB continue to buy Italian Treasury
bonds?” Mario Baldassarri said in an interview in  Rome . “We
may need another adjustment in three, four weeks which will be
the real answer to the European Commission and to markets.”  Greek 10-year yields increased as much as 30 basis points
to a record 20.11 percent before settling 27 basis points higher
at 20.09 percent. Two-year yields jumped as much as 300 basis
points to 55.31 percent. The spread between 10-year Greek and
German bonds widened to a record 1,818 basis points, or 18.18
percentage points.  Trading Slumps  Trading in Greek  government bonds  on the electronic
secondary  securities market  slid 66 percent in August from July,
when it slid 64 percent, data from the Bank of  Greece  showed.  Volume on the so-called HDAT fell to 45 million euros from
131 million euros the previous month, and 819 million euros a
year earlier, the central bank said on its  website . The amount
of trading declined 99.9 percent from 30.76 billion euros in
August 2009, the data showed.  Europe’s leaders are scrambling to forge a deal that
balances Finnish demands for Greece to put up collateral without
derailing the second rescue aimed at stopping the debt crisis
from spreading to global markets.  Finnish Prime Minister  Jyrki Katainen  said his country may
not contribute to a second Greek bailout package if demands for
collateral in exchange for new loans aren’t met. Such an outcome
“remains a possibility,” Katainen told reporters after
delivering a speech in Helsinki today.  Stimulus Spending  The European Union said a joint mission of officials from
the European Commission, ECB and International Monetary Fund,
known as the troika, may return to Greece in mid-September. No
date has been set, EC spokesman  Amadeu Altafaj  said.  “The market is fearful that there might be some larger
disagreement between the Greek government” and the troika,
“which might prevent the next tranche of aid being paid out,”
said Marius Daheim, a senior fixed-income strategist at
 Bayerische Landesbank  in Munich. “The market is seeing the
German constitutional court ruling as opening the way for
 Germany  to continue on its path of rescuing the euro, so there’s
some relief.”  The cost of insuring Greek government debt rose 117 basis
points to a record 2,771 basis points, according to CMA prices
for credit-default swaps.  Portugal today sold 854 million euros of 105-day bills at
an average yield of 4.959 percent. Investors bid for 2.2 times
the amount on offer. That compares with a bid-to-cover ratio of
2.6 at a previous auction of the bills on Aug. 3, which were
sold at 4.967 percent.  Portugal’s two-year note snapped a three-day decline,
pushing the yield down five basis points to 14.34 percent after
rising as much as 15 basis points to 14.54 percent. The 10-year
yield added as much as 17 basis points to 11.03 percent, the
highest since Aug. 30.  German 10-year yields have declined more than 1 percentage
point in the past three months as a slump in shares around the
world and concern Europe’s debt crisis will intensify, increased
demand for the nation’s debt.  Bunds have returned 7.4 percent this year, according to
indexes compiled by the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies and Bloomberg. Treasuries gained 8.4 percent,
Italian debt lost 2.7 percent, Spanish bonds returned 4.3
percent and Greek bonds lost 28 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
