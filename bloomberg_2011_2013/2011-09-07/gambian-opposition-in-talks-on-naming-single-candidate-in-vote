Gambian opposition parties held
talks this week on uniting and naming a single candidate to
contest elections against President Yahya Jammeh on Nov. 24.  The Peopleâ€™s Democratic Organization for Independence and
Socialism proposed that a national convention be created to
include all opposition groups, Amie Sillah, an executive member
of the party, told reporters in the capital, Banjul, today.  Jammeh came to power in a bloodless coup in the West
African nation in 1994.  To contact the reporter on this story:
