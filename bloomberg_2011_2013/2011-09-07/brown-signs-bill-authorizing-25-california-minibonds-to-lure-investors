California, the nation’s largest
issuer of municipal debt, will sell so-called minibonds for $25
to individual investors in addition to conventional $1,000
amounts, under a bill signed by Governor Jerry Brown.  The lower-denomination bonds will attract a broader range
of investors, lowering interest rates for the state, according
to a legislative  analysis . The report said many investors have
fled the municipal market in the last six months.  State Treasurer Bill Lockyer, who developed the minibond
proposal, has no plans to sell the $25 bonds right away,
spokesman Tom Dresslar said. California is scheduled to go to
market Sept. 19 with a sale of as much as $2.6 billion in
general-obligation bonds, he said.  “We now have the flexibility to offer this product when it
makes sense for taxpayers in any given transaction,” Dresslar
said in a telephone interview yesterday.  Lockyer, a 70-year-old Democrat, oversaw more than $27
billion in bond sales in 2010. The minibonds, regular zero-
coupon and capital appreciation bonds, would be traded on the
New York Stock Exchange.  Lockyer developed the proposal after reviewing
solicitations from  Morgan Stanley (MS) ,  Citigroup Inc. (C) ,  Wells Fargo &
Co. (WFC)  and RBC Capital Markets in late 2009 and early 2010,
according to documents from the treasurer’s office. Banks
collect fees on bond transactions and would stand to profit if
California shifted a $1,000 bond sale into 40 sales of $25 each.  Other Issuers  A few other municipal issuers also have lowered
denominations to reach the retail market, according to research
by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, the industry’s
regulator.  Massachusetts sold $5 million of $490 million in debt in
$1,000 increments, rather than the usual $5,000, in May.
Minnesota sold bonds in $1,000 denominations in 2009 and 2010,
 according  to the Star Tribune newspaper. Bergen County, New
Jersey, sold bonds to individuals in denominations of $610 in
December 2008 to finance improvements to its parks system,
according to a county  statement .  To contact the reporter on this story:
