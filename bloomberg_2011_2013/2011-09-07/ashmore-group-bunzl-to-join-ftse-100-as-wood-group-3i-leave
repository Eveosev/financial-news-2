Ashmore Group Plc (ASHM) , a London-based
fund manager, and  Bunzl Plc (BNZL) , the worldâ€™s largest distributor of
disposable tableware, are being added to the  FTSE 100 Index (UKX) ,
while John Wood Group Plc and  3i Group Plc (III)  will be deleted.  FTSE Group, the index compiler in London, announced the
changes in a  press release  today. Wood Group is exiting the
benchmark gauge for U.K. equities after being added in March
this year. The oil-services provider active in Africa and the
 Middle East  will enter the FTSE 250 Index, as will 3i. Changes
will be implemented after the close on Sept. 16, according to
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
