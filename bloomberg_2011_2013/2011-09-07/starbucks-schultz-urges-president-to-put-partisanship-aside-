Starbucks Corp. (SBUX)  Chief Executive
Officer  Howard Schultz  urged President  Barack Obama  and Congress
to overcome party divisions to find solutions to the nation’s
budget deficit and unemployment.  “We urge you to put partisanship aside and put America
first,” Schultz wrote in a letter sent today. Congress should
move quickly to “pass a bipartisan long-term debt and financial
security plan that courageously addresses both entitlements and
revenues,” he said.  Schultz said he has personally committed to accelerating
growth and job creation at his company.  Last month Schultz, 58, enlisted business leaders and
fellow CEOs in a  pledge  to boycott campaign donations until
Congress finds a way to put the nation’s finances in order.
Among the 100 leaders who’ve taken the pledge are AOL Inc. CEO
 Tim Armstrong , Whole Foods Market Inc. Co-CEO Walter Robb and
Millard Drexler, CEO of J. Crew Group Inc.  Schultz helped to host a live webcast and teleconference
yesterday to discuss solutions to waning consumer confidence,
joblessness and growing debt in the nation. More than 100,000
Americans called into the 90-minute conference, according to
Seattle-based Starbucks.  Starbucks is the world’s biggest coffee-shop operator with
more than 17,000 cafes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
