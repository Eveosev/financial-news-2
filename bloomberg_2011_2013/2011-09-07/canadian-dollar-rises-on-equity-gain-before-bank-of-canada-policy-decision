Canada ’s dollar rose to its highest
level this week before today’s Bank of Canada policy meeting as
a gain in stock-index futures buoyed higher-yielding assets.  The currency, nicknamed the loonie, fell against the
commodity-linked Australian dollar and Swedish krone on
speculation the central bank may signal a possible reduction in
the target lending rate later this year. All 27 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey predict Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney will keep the rate at 1 percent today.  “The Canadian dollar is still waiting for Carney to give
clearer direction on rates,” said Firas Askari, head of
 currency trading  in Toronto at Bank of Montreal’s BMO Capital
Markets unit, by e-mail. “Equity futures look positive, so the
Canadian dollar is doing OK.”  The Canadian currency appreciated 0.4 percent to 98.66
cents per  U.S. dollar  at 7:36 a.m. in Toronto, from 99.05 cents
yesterday. It touched 98.51 cents, the strongest level since
Sept. 2. One Canadian dollar purchases $1.0136.  To contact the reporter on this story:
