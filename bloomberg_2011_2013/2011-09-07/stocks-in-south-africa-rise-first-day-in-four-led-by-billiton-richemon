The FTSE/JSE  Africa  All Share Index
rose for the first day in four, advancing 988.77, or 3.4
percent, to 30,514.6 by the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today.  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  , the mining company that makes
up about 9 percent of the benchmark  stock index , increased for
the first day in five, gaining 10.82 rand, or 4 percent, to
281.50 rand. Copper rallied the most in a week on concern
production may fall amid threats of strikes at mines in Peru and
 Indonesia .  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  , the world’s largest mining
group, climbed the most since November 2010, gaining 11.25 rand,
or 5.1 percent, to 231.25 rand.  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG)  , Africa’s biggest producer
of the metal, fell the most in two weeks, slipping 3.54 rand, or
1.1 percent, to 325.49 rand. Gold dropped for a second day in
 London  as rising equities curbed demand for an alternative asset
and spurred investors to sell the metal after its rally to a
record.  Cie Financiere Richemont SA (CFR)  , the world’s second-
biggest luxury-goods company, advanced the most since October
2008, gaining 2.76 rand, or 7.56 percent, to 39.25 rand. The
company reported a 29 percent jump in revenue in the five months
through August from the year-earlier period, beating the 18
percent average estimate of 15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Remgro Ltd. (REM)  , a diversified investment holding
company, rose a second day, adding 3.78 rand, or 3.4 percent, to
113.79 rand. The company said earnings per share excluding
extraordinary items rose as much as 60 percent in the 15 months
through June, adding the figure isn’t comparable with the year
through March 2010.  SABMiller Plc (SAB)  , the world’s second-largest brewer
by volume, gained for the first day in four, rising 6.71 rand,
or 2.7 percent, to 253.99 rand. Grupo Santander equity analyst
Anthony Bucalo initiated coverage of the brewer with a “buy”
rating and a 12-month price estimate of 25 pounds a share.  Sasol Ltd. (SOL)  , the world’s largest maker of motor
fuel from coal, advanced the most in seven months, adding 17.25
rand, or 5.5 percent, to 328.40 rand. Oil climbed the most in
three weeks in  New York  as a weather system in the  Gulf of
Mexico  threatened supplies in the U.S., where production halts
because of storms have already reduced crude stockpiles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
