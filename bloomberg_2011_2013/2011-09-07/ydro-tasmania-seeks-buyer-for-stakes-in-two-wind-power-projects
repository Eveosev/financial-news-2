Australia â€™s Hydro Tasmania plans to
sell off as much as 75 percent of its stakes in the 65-megawatt
Bluff Point and 75-megawatt Studland Bay wind farms, the company
said in a statement.  Hydro Tamsania has called for expressions of interest and
plans to complete the deal by the end of the year, it said. The
company will focus on building the 168-megawatt Musselroe wind
farm.   Chief Executive Officer Roy Adair said he expects the buyer
of the stakes in Bluff Point and Studland Bay, collectively
known as the Woolnorth project, to be a partner in the Musselroe
wind farm.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
