Benchmark European coal was little
changed, boosting profit at coal-fired plants in  Germany  as
power rose.  Thermal coal for delivery to Amsterdam, Rotterdam or
Antwerp with settlement next year was little changed at $128.60
a metric ton at 10:30 a.m. in  London , according to broker prices
compiled by Bloomberg. The clean dark spread for 2012 in
Germany, Europeâ€™s largest power market, rose 3.4 percent to 9.39
euros ($13.21) a megawatt-hour, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The spread estimates the profit from burning coal,
taking power and emissions costs into account.  Bloomberg tracks data from information supplied by ICAP
