New York  Life Insurance Co. and six
other insurance companies assailed the $1 billion settlement the
trustee liquidating  Bernard Madoff ’s firm forged with Tremont
Group Holdings Inc., saying it didn’t treat all of Tremont’s
funds equally.  As limited partners of the hedge fund’s Opportunity III
fund, they said they stand to lose if a court rules that trustee
 Irving Picard  erred in denying compensation to the Ponzi
scheme’s so-called net winners. While Picard’s deal with Tremont
protects the hedge fund’s other funds by letting them
recalculate claims in event of such a ruling, it doesn’t protect
the insurance companies, they said in a bankruptcy court filing
yesterday in New York.  “The agreement contains an ambiguity that may be used by
the trustee to refuse to recalculate,” they said.  A group of Madoff’s investors last week asked a U.S.
appeals court to review its Aug. 16 ruling that bars them from
calculating losses based on their account statements. The
court’s “general approval” of Picard’s method of calculating
who gets compensated may be “modified,” the insurers said.  As part of the Tremont deal, its funds will be allowed to
make claims on the Madoff estate of about $3 billion. The
insurers said the trustee needs to clarify their status in the
arrangement.  Amanda Remus, a Picard spokeswoman, declined to comment on
the insurers’ complaint.  The Tremont case is Picard v. Tremont Group Holdings Inc.,
10-5310,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New York
( Manhattan .)  To contact the reporter on this story:
