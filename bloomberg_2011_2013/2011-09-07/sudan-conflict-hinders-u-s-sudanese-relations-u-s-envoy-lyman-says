Fighting in  Sudan ’s Southern
Kordofan and Blue Nile states is hindering relations between the
U.S. and President Umar al-Bashir’s government in Khartoum, the
U.S. special envoy to the country, Princeton Lyman, said.  “The U.S. is urging parties to get back to negotiations,”
he told reporters in the capital today. “The two sides are
still not talking to each other and that makes the situation
more dangerous.”  Sudanese government forces and members of the northern
branch of the ruling party in neighboring South Sudan clashed
this month in the capital of Blue Nile state, Al-Damazin. The
fighting in the state forced at least 20,000 people to flee into
 Ethiopia , the United Nations Refugee Agency said on Sept. 6.  Sudan’s government has been trying to disarm fighters in
Blue Nile and Southern Kordofan states who fought during a two-
decade civil war with the forces of South Sudan, which gained
independence on July 9. Clashes first erupted on June 5 in
Southern Kordofan, Sudan’s main oil-producing state, forcing
more than 150,000 people to flee their homes, according to
 Amnesty International  and  Human Rights Watch .  Al-Bashir’s administration has fired the governor of Blue
Nile state and declared a state of emergency.  The U.S. can’t go forward on normalizing relations with
Sudan if there’s a serious conflict and humanitarian situation
in the two border states, Lyman said.  “Clearly, that makes it much more difficult than before,”
he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
