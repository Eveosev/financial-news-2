Former Finra Chief Counsel Linda Riefberg joined  law firm  Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver &
Jacobson LLP’s enforcement and investigations practice in  New
York .  Riefberg, 52, oversaw a broad range of investigations and
disciplinary actions while at the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority’s department of enforcement. She was a lawyer in the
enforcement division of the New York Stock Exchange, which
merged in 2007 with the National Association of Securities
Dealers to form Finra, the law firm said today in a statement.  “Linda’s wealth of knowledge coupled with her Finra and
NYSE expertise will be tremendously valuable to our clients,”
Carmen J. Lawrence and Dixie Johnson, co-chairs of Fried Frank’s
enforcement practice, said in the statement.  Finra is the largest independent securities regulator in
the U.S., overseeing more than 4,000 firms and more than 633,000
registered securities representatives, according to its website.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
