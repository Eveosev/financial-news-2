BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA, France’s largest
bank, said it has “an excess of short-term liquidity” in U.S.
dollars and it has to deposit the extra funds at the  Federal
Reserve .  BNP Paribas in August had “some decrease” in financing
from U.S. money-market funds, according a BNP Paribas note to
clients and investors dated Sept. 6 and obtained by Bloomberg.  The company has “very abundant” short-term funding in
euros, BNP Paribas also said. The interbanking market situation
“today is very different” compared with the crisis tied to the
collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
