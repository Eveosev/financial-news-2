Horst Seehofer , Bavaria’s prime
minister and  Christian Social Union  chairman, said  Greece ’s exit
from the euro is “possible,” though he would prefer it to
remain in the single currency by boosting efforts to cut debt,
 Bild  newspaper reported, citing an interview.  Seehofer, whose CSU is one of three parties in Chancellor
Angela Merkel’s coalition, said he has “considerable doubt”
that Greece and Italy have earnest intentions to cut spending,
according to Bild.  To contact the reporter on this story:
