Turkey  plans its own automobile
brand, to take a 20 percent market share in the country, or
200,000 vehicles initially, Industry Minister Nihat Ergun said.  About one-third of cars sold in Turkey are made in the
country by international manufacturers, Ergun said in a news
conference in Istanbul today, adding that 600,000 cars will
probably be sold in the country this year.  The Istanbul-based  Automotive Manufacturers Association , or
OSD, will submit a report to the government this month on local-
brand car production, he said. Production inside Turkey rose 26
percent last year to 1.1 million vehicles, making the country
the top producer in Eastern Europe outside  Russia , according to
the Automotive Distributors’ Association.  Turkey, which has no automotive brands of its own, has
become a production hub for  Ford Motor Co. (F) ,  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) ,
 Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  and  Renault SA. (RNO)   Fiat SpA (F) ’s Turkish unit,
 Tofas Turk Otomobil Fabrikasi AS (TOASO) , makes the Doblo minivan in the
country.  Car sales in Turkey will reach 1 million a year “in a few
years and the new Turkish brand can have 20 percent share from
the national sales,” Ergun said. “Already there are
businessmen who are very much interested in the manufacturing of
such cars.”  The brand may find a market abroad later, Ergun said.  A local brand must sell at least 400,000 to 500,000 cars to
justify the investment, Ali Pandir, chief executive officer of
Tofas, said Dec. 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
