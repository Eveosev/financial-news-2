London  police arrested six people
after a Wales soccer fan died following an assault outside
Wembley Stadium last night.  The attack took place before a qualifying match for next
yearâ€™s European Championship, which  England  won 1-0. Michael
John Dye died at a north London hospital, the  Metropolitan
Police  said in a statement. Officers from the Homicide and
Serious Crime Command are investigating.  The Cardiff resident suffered head injuries in the attack
and was pronounced dead at 8:50 p.m. local time last night,
about 90 minutes after police were called to the incident, the
statement said. The 44-year-old man suffered cardiac arrest
before being taken to the hospital, the  British Broadcasting
Corp.  reported, citing an unidentified spokesman for the  London
Ambulance Service .  The incident comes a month after two people were murdered
during riots in London that began in the northern district of
Tottenham after a local black man was shot and killed by police
who stopped his car intending to make an arrest. It was the
worst wave of violence in the capital since the 1980s as
authorities deployed 16,000 police in the streets and arrested
1,875 people.  Police said they arrested the six men in the Wales
supporters section of the stadium, and they remain in custody at
a north London police station.  To contact the reporters on this story:
