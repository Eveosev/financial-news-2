Lebanon’s trade deficit widened by 4
percent in the first seven months from a year earlier on higher
imports, the  Finance Ministry  said.  The shortfall was $8.37 billion from $8 billion, the
Beirut-based ministry said in an e-mailed statement late
yesterday.  Imports rose 5 percent to $10.9 billion, driven by a 52
percent gain in the cost of unwrought gold, un-mounted diamond
and precious metals, while pharmaceutical products increased by
19 percent, according to the ministry.  Exports increased 5 percent in the first seven months from
the year-earlier period to $2.5 billion as shipments to Arab
countries fell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
