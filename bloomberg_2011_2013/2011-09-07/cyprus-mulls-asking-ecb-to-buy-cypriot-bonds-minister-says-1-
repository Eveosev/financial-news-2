Cyprus is considering asking the
 European Central Bank  to buy Cypriot bonds to stem a surge in
yields, Finance Minister Kikis Kazamias said.  The matter was discussed “in the context of the regular
contacts between the  Finance Ministry  and the  Central Bank of
Cyprus  at the highest level,” Kazamias told reporters today in
Nicosia. The minister and central bank Governor Athanasios Orphanides “agreed that this is an issue that we have to look
into and take decisions,” he said.  Moody’s Investors Service, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch
Ratings have all lowered the credit rating of the euro area’s
third-smallest economy in the past two months amid concern the
east Mediterranean country may become the next victim of the
region’s debt crisis.  Kazamias is negotiating a second package of austerity
measures in an attempt to slash the  budget deficit  to 5.5
percent of the economy this year and below 2 percent in 2012.
“We do not have the luxury of being choosy about who is going
to lend us,” he said.  Cyprus has sufficient cash reserves until mid-December, the
 Finance Ministry  said on Aug. 1. The yield on the Cypriot 10-
year bond maturing in Feb. 2020 fell to 13.1 percent as of 1:21
p.m. in Nicosia, compared with 13.2 percent yesterday and 7.1
percent on June 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
