Indian jewels and photographs by
Robert Mapplethorpe are among items collected by a Scottish
aristocrat that are estimated to sell for as much as $1 million.  Colin Tennant, who died last year, gained notoriety for the
parties he hosted on Mustique in the Caribbean in the 1960s and
1970s. Princess Margaret, sister of the U.K.’s Queen Elizabeth,
Mickand Bianca Jagger, and  David Bowie  were among the guests.  Tennant, who lived to be 83, sold his private island and
moved to nearby  St. Lucia  with his pet elephant, Boopa, in 1992.
He was described by newspapers as an eccentric socialite who
collected widely and left his Indian-style “Beau House” to
Kent Adonai, his locally born servant and elephant-keeper.
Proceeds of the auction will benefit the Glenconner Estate, said
Bonhams.  “The collection is a wonderful mix,” said Charlie Thomas,
the Bonhams specialist in charge of the Sept. 28 London sale.
“There are serious academic pieces combined with fun lots.”  A gold pendant from the treasury of the Indian ruler Tipu
Sultan, set with a 38-carat emerald, is valued at 80,000 pounds
($127,600) to 120,000 pounds. It is the most expensive piece in
the 225-lot sale, which may raise 650,000 pounds. Tipu was known
as the “Tiger of Mysore” for his opposition to British rule.
He was killed, and his treasury looted, at the Siege of
Seringapatam in 1799.  Mapplethorpe photos of Princess Margaret and the Jaggers at
an Indian costume party for Tennant’s 50th birthday in 1976
carry low estimates of 300 pounds each.  Tennant inherited 1 million pounds in 1963 on the sale of
the family commodity trading business. He assumed the title Lord
Glenconner when his father died in 1983.  A pair of cufflinks and a silver snuff box, both gifted by
the princess to Tennant, are cataloged at 1,000 pounds to 1,500
pounds each. A late 17th-century marble bust symbolizing America
is priced at 3,000 pounds to 5,000 pounds.  Koons Collection  Three paintings from the collection of  Jeff Koons  will give
a contemporary twist to a new fair devoted to Old Masters in
Paris in November.  The U.S. artist will lend female nudes by Nicolas Poussin,
Jean-Honore Fragonard and Gustave Courbet to the first edition
of  Paris Tableau . The event, featuring 10 Paris galleries and a
further 10 international dealers, will be held in the Palais de
la Bourse from Nov. 4 through Nov. 8.  Koons has been an active buyers of Old Masters in recent
years, adding to his collection of contemporary pieces. A
retrospective show of his own works, including the signature
chromium steel sculptures “Rabbit” and “Balloon Dog,’’ was
held in the Chateau de Versailles from September 2008 to March
2009.  Artist Inspiration  “Jeff has been inspired by Old Master artists all his
life,” the Paris-based dealer Maurizio Canesso, president of
the fair, said in an interview. “Works from his collection will
show people that these paintings can be bought and don’t just
exist in the Louvre.”  Fragonard’s “Young Girl Holding Two Puppies,” Poussin’s
“Jupiter and Antiope” and Courbet’s “Femme Nue” were all
offered at auction between June 2007 and April 2008. They sold
for $1.4 million, $959,400 and 1.6 million pounds respectively.  Vase Fails  A Chinese porcelain vase has failed to sell at auction --
despite being almost identical to the 18th-century one bid to a
record 51.6 million pounds in November.  The lot at  Canterbury Auction Galleries  in Kent, entered by
a Chinese seller, was a recently-made copy, dealers said. It was
cracked and of unspecified date, according to the catalog. It
was valued at 5,000 pounds to 6,000 pounds and resembled the
record-breaking vase offered at Bainbridges in Ruislip, west
 London  last year.  (Scott Reyburn writes about the art market for Muse, the
