Ivory Coast ’s economy will contract
5.8 percent this year, less than an earlier forecast, as rising
cocoa and gold production eases the impact of a violent
political crisis, according to the  Finance Ministry .  The economy of the world’s biggest producer of the
chocolate ingredient may expand 8.5 percent in 2012, bolstered
by reconstruction efforts, according to the document, dated
Sept. 2 and obtained by Bloomberg News yesterday.  In June, the Abidjan-based ministry said the economy would
contract 6.3 percent because of the crisis that started when ex-
President  Laurent Gbagbo  refused to cede power to  Alassane Ouattara  after he lost an election in November. As many as 3,000
people were killed in the five-month conflict, according to the
 International Criminal Court , and activities ranging from cocoa
exports to gold mining were disrupted.  “The crisis has had serious consequences on the social,
humanitarian, security and economic situation,” the ministry
said in the document. Next year should bring “economic recovery
and social progress.”  Cocoa production in the calendar year will reach 1.34
million metric tons from an earlier forecast of 1.23 million
tons, the ministry said. In the harvest period, which started in
October, to Aug. 28, deliveries from farms to the ports of
Abidjan and  San Pedro  totaled almost 1.4 million tons, 22
percent higher than the same period a year earlier, according to
data from the industry’s regulator.  Gold,  Palm Oil   The resumption of production at  Randgold Resources Ltd. (GOLD) ’s
Tongon gold mine, which was halted during the crisis, will help
boost output of the metal to 10.1 metric tons this year from the
initial forecast of 7 tons, the document showed. Ivory Coast
produced 5.1 tons of gold in 2010.  Norbert Kobenan, a communications adviser at the ministry,
declined to comment on the forecasts when contacted yesterday.  “The economy appears to recover faster than expected
following the political and economic meltdown,” said  Samir Gadio , an emerging-markets strategist at Standard Bank Plc.
“Because the economy effectively shut down for about three
months, we however project growth in private consumption to be
negatively affected,” he said in an e-mailed note today.  Coffee output in  Africa ’s third-biggest grower of the crop
is expected to decline 74 percent in 2011 from a year earlier to
24,200 tons after many farmers deserted their plantations during
the crisis, the document showed. Palm oil production may fall 17
percent to 320,000 tons and output of bananas may drop 10
percent, to 336,000 tons it added.  Crude-oil production may slump 16 percent to 12.3 million
barrels while output of natural rubber may rise to 244,500 tons
from 231,500 tons a year earlier, the document showed.  Ivory Coast’s defaulted Eurobonds, due 2032, declined 0.6
percent to 54.16 cents on the dollar, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The damage to the economy caused by the political
crisis forced Ivory Coast to miss two interest payments and to
ask for a reassessment of the $2.3 billion debt, Finance
Minister Charles Koffi Diby said July 12.  To contact the reporters on this story:
