Indonesia ’s rupiah traded near the
weakest level in almost two weeks after international funds
reduced holdings of the nation’s stocks on concern a slowing
global recovery will damp demand for exports. Bonds rose.  Global investors sold $40 million more local shares than
they bought this week through yesterday, exchange data show. The
rupiah has lost 0.3 percent this month as economists predict
Bank Indonesia will leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged
at 6.75 percent during a policy meeting tomorrow.  “ Risk aversion  is playing a big part in deterring
investors from taking a position in the currency,” said
Saktiandi Supaat, head of foreign-exchange research at Malayan
Banking Bhd. in Singapore. “Investors are cautious before  Bank
Indonesia ’s policy decision.”  The rupiah was little changed at 8,558 per dollar as of
3:18 p.m. in Jakarta, from 8,559 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency touched 8,578 earlier, the
weakest level since Aug. 26.  Risks to the global economy are intensifying, with the euro
region’s outlook dependent on European leaders making the right
decisions, World Bank President  Robert Zoellick  said yesterday.  Indonesia’s 10-year bonds rallied after official data
showed global investors’ holdings of rupiah notes rose 26
percent this year through Sept. 5 to 247 trillion rupiah ($28.9
billion). Consumer prices climbed 4.79 percent in August from a
year earlier, compared with an increase of 4.61 percent in July
that was the least since May 2010, the government said this
week.  The yield on the 8.25 percent government securities due
July 2021 declined 10 basis points to 6.76 percent today,
according to midday prices from the Inter-Dealer Market
Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
