Lithuanian Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius said the country must be “extra careful” about
raising the minimum monthly wage.  The government is considering tensions in the global
markets when discussing an increase in the  minimum wage ,
Kubilius told a news conference in Vilnius today.  In May, the Baltic nation’s government had considered to
raise the minimum wage in 2012 as the economy expands at the
second-fastest pace in the European Union. The Cabinet aims to
narrow the  budget deficit  to 3 percent of gross domestic product
in 2012 from an estimated 5.3 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
