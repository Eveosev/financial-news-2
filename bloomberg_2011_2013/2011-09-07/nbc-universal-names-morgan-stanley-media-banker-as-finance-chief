NBC Universal, the entertainment
company controlled by  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) , named  Morgan Stanley (MS) 
investment banker Stuart J. Epstein as chief financial officer.  Epstein was the global head of media and communications at
Morgan Stanley and a managing director of the firm, New York-
based NBC Universal said today in an e-mailed statement.  Comcast is bringing aboard a longtime adviser, according to
the statement. Epstein played a key role in creating the venture
that gave Comcast, the largest U.S. cable service, a 51 percent
stake in NBC Universal, owner of the broadcast network, movie
studio and cable channels Bravo and USA.  “He is a smart, capable leader with a deep understanding
of the media business,” NBC Universal Chief Executive Officer
Stephen Burke said in the statement. “He will be a great
cultural fit for NBCU.”  Epstein replaces Lynn Calpeter, who returned to  General
Electric Co. (GE)  to become CFO of the company’s energy unit,
according to a July statement. GE, which once held the majority
stake in NBC Universal, is Comcast’s minority partner in the
media venture.  Comcast added 68 cents, or 3.3 percent, to $21.39 today in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares have declined 2.6
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
