Boston  Red Sox pitcher  Josh Beckett 
has no ligament damage in his sprained right ankle, which will
force him to miss at least one start.  Beckett returned to Boston for tests yesterday, a day after
leaving a 1-0 loss in Toronto during the fourth inning because
of pain in his ankle. The righthander said after the game that
he was concerned about the injury because he uses his right foot
to push off the pitching rubber when throwing.  “His examination was consistent with an ankle sprain,”
Red Sox medical director Tom Gill said yesterday in a statement.
“An MRI was performed that confirmed no other injury to his
ankle tendons, or his Achilles tendon. We will re-evaluate his
symptoms and availability later this week.”  Red Sox manager Terry Francona said Beckett will miss his
next scheduled start on Sept. 11 against the  Tampa Bay Rays .
Boston last night beat the Blue Jays 14-0 to improve to 85-56.  The 31-year-old Beckett has a 12-5 record with a team-
leading 2.49 earned run average in 27  Major League Baseball 
starts this season.  Boston trails the  New York Yankees  by 2 1/2 games in the
American League Eastern Division with three weeks left in the
regular season. The Red Sox lead Tampa Bay by eight games in the
race for the wild card playoff spot, which goes to the second-
place team with the best record.  To contact the reporter on this story:
