Kazakhstan ’s central bank may add
the Russian ruble, South Korea’s won and the Brazilian real to
its international reserves to diversify the Central Asian
nation’s holdings, Chairman Grigori Marchenko said.  The yuan may also be added after the  International Monetary
Fund  includes the Chinese currency in its Special Drawing Rights
valuation basket, Marchenko told reporters in Almaty today.  The Kazakh central bank isn’t planning a significant
decrease of its dollar and euro holdings, according to
Marchenko.  To contact the reporter on this story:
