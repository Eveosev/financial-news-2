Taiwan’s government bonds snapped a
three-day advance, lifting five-year yields from a 10-month low,
as demand for safer assets waned after  Greece  pledged to step up
efforts that will help ease  Europe ’s debt crisis.  The Taiex index of shares rose 2.2 percent after Greece
said it’ll accelerate austerity measures in return for
international aid as pressure mounted from European partners
before the payment of a sixth tranche of bailout loans. Global
funds pulled $1.1 billion from the island’s stock market in the
past three days as concerns over global growth and Europe’s debt
woes prompted investors to shun riskier assets.  “Bond movements have been very much dependent on stocks
recently,” said Ivy Leung, a Taipei-based fixed-income trader
at Polaris Securities Co. “Yields rose today, but overall
pessimism about the global economy hasn’t faded. Yields should
continue to go down.”  The yield on the 2 percent notes due July 2016 rose 1.5
basis points, or 0.015 percentage point, to 0.954 percent as of
the 1:30 p.m. close in Taipei, prices from Gretai Securities
Market show. Yesterday’s closing level of 0.939 percent was the
lowest for a benchmark five-year note since November, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Taiwan ’s dollar closed little changed at NT$29.12 versus
its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It touched
NT$29.130 earlier, the weakest level since Aug. 19.  The overnight money-market rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, was steady at 0.393 percent, according to
a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money
Center.  Taiwan’s central bank last boosted its benchmark rate on
June 30 by 12.5 basis points to 1.875 percent. The policy board
is set to meet again on Sept. 29.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
