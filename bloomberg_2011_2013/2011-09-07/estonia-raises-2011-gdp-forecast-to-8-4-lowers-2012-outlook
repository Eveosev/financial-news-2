Estonia’s  Finance Ministry  revised
higher its growth forecast for this year and reduced 2012
forecast as rising global uncertainty will cap boost from
stronger-than-expected exports and investment.  Gross domestic product will expand 7 percent this year and
3 percent in 2012, the ministry said in an e-mailed statement
today. The forecast is in line with comments from Prime Minister
 Andrus Ansip  last week. In April, the Tallinn-based ministry
forecast growth of 4 percent this year and next.  The $19 billion economy, the third in eastern  Europe  to
adopt the euro this January, is growing at the fastest pace in
the European Union this year. GDP rose 8.4 percent from a year
earlier in the second quarter, according to a preliminary
estimate on Aug. 11 by the statistics office.  “Estonian economy looks in a very good state against the
general background, but volatile external factors do not allow
for more than modest growth, scant budget and uncertainty about
the accuracy of forecasts,” Finance Minister Juergen Ligi said
in the statement.  The nation of 1.3 million has benefited from a 54 percent
jump in exports in the first half thanks to higher global demand
for goods from the local plant of Stockholm-based Ericsson AB,
which manufactures mobile network stations, and bigger shipments
of Russian oil products through its ports. Infrastructure
investments have also increased more than expected, according to
Swedbank AB, the largest Baltic lender.  Risk Scenario  The economy may grow 1 percent next year under a “risk
scenario” which foresees a global double-dip recession, Andrus Saalik, the head of the Finance Ministry’s economics department,
told a news conference today.  The country, the only one among the euro area members with
a  budget surplus  in 2010, sees a surplus of 0.2 percent of GDP
this year.  Next year, it plans a deficit of 2.1 percent, mainly due to
spending proceeds from selling its spare United Nations
emissions credits and due to fully resuming state pension
contributions after a temporary freeze in 2009, the ministry
said. Under the so-called risk scenario, the deficit could reach
2.9 percent next year.  Budget balance would improve in following years, with a
deficit of 0.1 percent seen in 2013, followed by a surplus of
0.5 percent in 2014 and 1 percent in 2015, Sven Kirsipuu, an
adviser with the ministry’s public finance department, told
reporters.  Estonia’s public debt is expected to decline to 5.3 percent
of GDP by 2015 from 6.6 percent last year, the lowest level in
the 27-member EU.  The ministry also raised its forecast for average annual
inflation to 4.9 percent this year, with price growth slowing to
2.8 percent in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
