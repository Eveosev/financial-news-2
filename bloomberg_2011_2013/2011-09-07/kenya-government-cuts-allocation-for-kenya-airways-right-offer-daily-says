Kenya’s Treasury cut by more than
half the funds allocated to  Kenya Airways Ltd. (KNAL) ’s planned $250
million rights offer, Business Daily reported, citing an
official it didn’t identify.  Finance Minister  Uhuru Kenyatta  had set aside 5.5 billion
shillings ($58.5 million) to participate in the offer to avoid
having its 23 percent stake diluted, the Nairobi-based newspaper
said. The amount was reduced to pay for famine-relief efforts
amid a drought in the north of the country, it said.  The Treasury will either pay for the shares in two
segments, with the balance of the payment being made in the next
financial year, or arrange a syndicated loan, the newspaper
said.  Kenya Airways hasn’t said when the rights offer will be
held, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
