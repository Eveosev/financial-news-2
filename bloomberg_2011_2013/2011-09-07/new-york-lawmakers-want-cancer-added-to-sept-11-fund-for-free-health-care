Federal lawmakers from New York are
pushing for cancer to be covered by a free-care fund for victims
of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks after a study linked exposure
to World Trade Center smoke and dust to the disease.  Democrats Carolyn Maloney and Jerrold Nadler and Republican
Peter King, all members of the House of Representatives, will
request that the  National Institute of Occupational Safety and
Health  consider a Lancet study that showed firefighters in the
terror attacks had a 19 percent higher risk of cancer than peers
who weren’t there. The study was published Sept. 1.  The research was the first to tie a higher cancer risk to
first responders. In a petition, the representatives are calling
for a review of a law that fails to include cancer in free care
provided for Sept. 11 victims.  “For us, the evidence is there,” Ilan Kayatsky, a
spokesman for Nadler, said in a telephone interview. “This is
the peer-reviewed study a lot of us were waiting for.”  In a  July report , NIOSH said there isn’t enough evidence to
link the World Trade Center’s smoke and dust to cancer. The next
time the evidence for including cancer would be reviewed is next
year, said Kayatsky.  To contact the reporter on this story:
