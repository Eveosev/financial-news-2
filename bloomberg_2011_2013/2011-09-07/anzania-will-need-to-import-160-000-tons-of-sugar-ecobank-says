Tanzania will need to import at
least 160,000 metric tons of sugar this year to meet a deficit
of the sweetener, Togo-based lender  Ecobank Transnational Inc. (ETI) 
said.  The government will import 120,000 tons of sugar duty-free
to ease shortages, The Citizen newspaper reported, citing the
Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Cooperatives. The country also
banned the re-export of sugar, according to the newspaper.  “They will need to import at least 160,000 tons in 2011 if
they are to meet the demand, but they may not be able to do so
because other countries in  East Africa  are also having a
shortage,” Edward George, a soft commodities specialist at the
bank, said today by phone from London.  Sugar production in the  East African Community , which
includes Tanzania, will lag behind demand in the 2010-11 season,
George said, adding that Kenya and  Uganda  were also facing
supply shortages due to a drought that hurt crops.  Production in the region will be 1.25 million tons in the
current season, while consumption is forecast at 1.7 million
tons, according to Ecobank’s estimates.  “The quota that some countries in East  Africa  have to send
to the EU has not been filled, partly reflecting that there
isn’t enough sugar being produced and consumption in Africa is
increasing,” George said.  Some nations in the region have preferential access to the
European Union market, with agreements that allow them to ship
some sweetener to the 27-nation bloc duty-free.  It’s “very likely” that other governments in the region
will take similar measures to those adopted by Tanzania if they
need to bring down local prices, though “this will only be
short-term,” George said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
