Indian stocks rose to the highest
level in four weeks amid speculation slowing growth may prompt
the central bank to halt its record series of interest-rate
increases and as Asian equities rebounded from a three-day drop.  Jaiprakash Associates Ltd. (JPA) , a builder of dams, surged 7.2
percent after a report said it is looking for a partner for its
cement business and is open to selling as much as a 26 percent
stake in the unit. Tata Power Co.,  India â€™s largest non-state
generator, climbed 4.3 percent, the most since March 2010.  The BSE India Sensitive Index advanced 187.10, or 1.1
percent, to 17,049.91, according to preliminary closing prices
at 3:30 p.m. in Mumbai, the highest level since Aug. 11. The
gauge fell 8.4 percent last month, the worst August in at least
10 years. The S&P CNX Nifty Index climbed 1.2 percent to
5,124.65. The BSE-200 Index rose 1.3 percent to 2,114.69.  Foreign funds bought a net 2.12 billion rupees ($46
million) of stocks on Sept. 5, taking their total investment in
equities this year to 19.4 billion rupees. They withdrew a net
$2.1 billion in August, the most since October 2008, data from
the market regulator show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
