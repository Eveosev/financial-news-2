     Sept. 7 (Bloomberg) --The European Banking Authority is
meeting to discuss strengthening bank capital,  Handelsblatt 
reported, citing a person familiar with the situation in
Brussels.  Banks can barely raise capital because the situation on the
 interbank market  is “horrible,” the newspaper said, quoting a
market participant on Tuesday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
