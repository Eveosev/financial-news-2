Federal law enforcement officials
charged 91 people with defrauding Medicare of about $295
million, said U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder at a news
conference in Washington.  The dollar value of the alleged frauds against Medicare,
the health-insurance program for the elderly and disabled, is
the largest prosecuted by the Justice Department, according to
the agency.  Those charged include doctors and nurses and health-care
clinic employees in seven states, the Justice Department said in
a statement today.  Strike forces, used by the Justice Department and Health
and Human Services Department to crack down on Medicare fraud
since 2007, have charged more than 1,140 people with falsely
billing Medicare for more than $2.9 billion, the statement said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
