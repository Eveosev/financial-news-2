FedEx Corp. (FDX)  is considering whether
to buy wide-body freighters from  Boeing Co. (BA)  and Airbus SAS to
update the fleet of the world’s largest cargo airline, three
people familiar with the matter said.  The order would involve about 50 planes, and discussions
center on Boeing’s 767 and Airbus’s A330, said one of the
people, who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly. While FedEx’s
board may consider an order at a meeting today, a final decision
may not come for several months, two people said.  Secondhand 767 passenger models may be part of a purchase,
allowing  Memphis , Tennessee-based FedEx to convert the planes to
fly cargo, two people said. The likely value of a deal may be
several billion dollars, based on list prices of $167.7 million
for a new  767-300 freighter  and $203.6 million for an A330-200
freighter, and the discounts customers receive.  A freighter order would be a boost for either planemaker.
Boeing is seeking sales to keep its 767 assembly line busy
before the company starts building U.S. Air Force tankers based
on the model, and Airbus has secured only 57 A330 freighter
orders since committing to the cargo version in 2007.  Twin-engine jets like the 767 or A330 would help FedEx cut
fuel costs, because its large planes include three-engine DC-10s
and MD-11s from Chicago-based Boeing. Some of the DC-10s are
more than 30 years old, according to data compiled by aviation
researcher Ascend Worldwide Ltd.  Order Timing  FedEx’s progress on an order decision may be slowed by
concern that the economic outlook is weak and the risk of losing
U.S.  Postal Service  business, two people said. FedEx is the
largest contractor for the Postal Service, which said this week
it is pressing suppliers for $1 billion in annual savings as it
faces possible insolvency as soon as Sept. 30.  Clay McConnell, a U.S. spokesman for Toulouse, France-based
Airbus, and Boeing’s Tim Bader declined to comment on any
conversations between the planemakers and FedEx.  “As a matter of policy, we don’t comment on market rumors
or speculation,” said Jim McCluskey, a FedEx spokesman.
“That’s all I can provide.”  FedEx rose $2.67, or 3.6 percent, to $76.27 yesterday in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading, while Boeing gained
$2.13, or 3.4 percent, to $64.90. Airbus parent European
Aeronautic Defence & Space Co. climbed 1.45 euros, or 7.1
percent, to 21.88 euros in Paris.  Secondhand Planes  For the used 767s, FedEx has discussed so-called Boeing-
converted freighters, in which the planemaker does the work to
reconfigure the aircraft, said one of the people familiar with
the discussions. Such conversions are cheaper than buying new
freighters, another person said.  FedEx has experience in acquiring secondhand passenger jets
to refit for freight duty. It has taken that approach with
narrow-body Boeing 757s, twin-engine planes that burn less fuel
and can carry about 20 percent more freight than the three-
engine 727s FedEx uses on short-haul routes.  The list price for refitting a smaller 757 is $4.8 million
to $5.5 million, according to Singapore Technologies, also known
as ST Aerospace, which has been doing such work for FedEx.  FedEx’s fleet totaled  688 planes  as of May, with 276 from
Boeing or its predecessor companies and 124 from Airbus,
according to the latest annual filing. The rest were smaller
aircraft such as Cessna 208B and ATR turboprops, FedEx said.  777 Purchase  The company’s last major aircraft purchase was from Boeing,
an order of 15 777 freighters in November 2006. FedEx said then
that it was canceling an order for 10 Airbus A380 freighters
after “significant delays” on the cargo version of the
superjumbo jet, which never went into production.  While Boeing has built more than 1,000 767s since the plane
entered service in 1982, the model has lost favor with airlines
as longtime customers focus on the new 787 Dreamliner, the
plastic-composite jet that promises greater  fuel efficiency . The
backlog of 767s was 52 through July, according to the company,
compared with 348 for the A330.  With Boeing assembling 767s at a rate of about two planes
each month, the current orders would amount to only about two
years of production for the commercial variant of the plane.  The 767-300 freighter can carry more than 59 tons (53,500
kilograms) of cargo and has a  maximum range  of about 3,700 miles
(6,000 kilometers), according to Boeing’s website.  An A330 freighter can fly as much as 70 tons of cargo for
almost 3,700 miles, according to Martin Fendt, an Airbus
spokesman.  To contact the reporters on this story:
