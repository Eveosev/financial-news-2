Boeing Co. (BA)  raised its 20-year
forecast for commercial-aircraft demand in  China  by 15 percent
as rising wages spur travel in the world’s fastest-growing
aviation market.  The country will need 5,000 new planes with a value of $600
billion through 2030, according to an annual forecast the
Chicago-based company released today in Beijing. Last year it
said China would need 4,330 new planes with a value of $480
billion over 20 years. Small and medium-sized twin-aisle planes
will make up more than 40 percent of total, the planemaker said.  China’s commercial fleet will more than triple to 5,930
planes in the period, Boeing said, as economic growth above 9
percent a year makes holidays and business trips affordable to
more people. That demand has prompted the nation to form a
state-backed planemaker to challenge Boeing and Airbus SAS’s
stranglehold on the global single-aisle aircraft market.  “Boeing expects strong, long-term growth in the China
market in the next 20 years,”  Randy Tinseth , the planemaker’s
vice president for marketing, said at a briefing. Boeing has no
plans currently to build a  production line  in China, he said.  Sixteen percent of the planes China buys in the next 20
years will be replacements, Tinseth said.  Air China Ltd. (753) , the world’s largest airline by market
value, aims to double its widebody fleet to 100 planes in the
five years through 2015, Vice President He Li said in July.
China Southern Airlines Co.,  Asia ’s biggest carrier by passenger
numbers, is due to begin flying its first Airbus A380 next
month. The company has also ordered 10 Boeing 787s.  Chinese-made Plane  Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China is set to introduce the
C919, the nation’s first large passenger aircraft, in 2014. The
planemaker has won orders for as many as 100 C919s from
customers including Air China, China Southern and China Eastern
Airlines Corp., the country’s big three carriers.  China plans to invest 1.5 trillion yuan ($235 billion) in
the aviation industry in the five years ending 2015,  Li
Jiaxiang , director of the Civil Aviation Administration of
China, said in a  statement  in March. The country expects to have
230 airports and 4,500 planes by the end of the period, he said.  China’s international passenger numbers will likely grow 11
percent a year through 2014, the fastest pace worldwide, the
 International Air Transport Association  said in February.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
