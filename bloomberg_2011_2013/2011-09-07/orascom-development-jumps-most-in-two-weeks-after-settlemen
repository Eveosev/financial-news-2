Orascom Development Holding AG (ODHN) , a
developer of resorts in  Europe  and the  Middle East , surged the
most on record after a prison sentence in Egypt against its
chairman was nullified.  The Egyptian depositary receipts, or shares of the company
trading in Cairo, climbed 9.3 percent, the biggest gain since
Bloomberg started tracking the shares in December 2009, to 6.97
Egyptian pounds at the 2:30 p.m. close in Cairo. The company’s
Swiss shares rose 12 percent to 19.15 francs.  The Altdorf, Switzerland-based developer said its Egyptian
subsidiary Orascom Hotels and Development reached a settlement
with the  Egyptian Financial Supervisory Authority , the market
regulator, scrapping a two-year prison sentence and fine against
Chairman  Samih Sawiris .  The settlement requires Sawiris to admit fault and pay a
fine of 20 million pounds ($3.3 million), according to an e-
mailed statement from EFSA today. The settlement scraps the
court’s sentence declared last month, EFSA said.  Sawiris had been sentenced to two years in jail, a fine of
6,780 Swiss francs and bail of 2,720 francs over disclosure
violations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
