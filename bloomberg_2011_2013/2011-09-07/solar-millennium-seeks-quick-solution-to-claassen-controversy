Solar Millennium AG (S2M) ’s executive 
board spoke out in favor of a quick legal clarification of the
affair surrounding former Chief Executive Officer Utz Claassen.  “Solar Millennium could suffer damages from this,'' said 
CEO Christoph Wolff. ``In the question of whether Mr. Claassen 
was lawful in resigning after 74 days as CEO and keeping his 
signing bonus of EUR 9 million, we hope to have this resolved 
as quickly as possible and without any further attacks on the 
company from the media.”   Solar Millennium said efforts to reach an out-of-court
settlement with Claassen had been rejected by him.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
