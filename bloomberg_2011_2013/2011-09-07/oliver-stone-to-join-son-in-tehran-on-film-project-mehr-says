U.S. film director  Oliver Stone  will
travel to Iran in “a few weeks” to join his son to make a
film, the  Mehr   news agency  reported.  Sean Stone is currently in Tehran and will be searching in
coming days for suitable locations for the film, according to
the state-run news agency.  The father and son visit to Iran visit follows an
invitation from “a number of Iranian film investors,” the
report said, without giving further details.  In 2007, Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s office
said it received a letter from Stone seeking “permission” to
make a movie about the president. The request was subsequently
rejected by the Iranian government, according to Mehr.  To contact the reporter on this story:
