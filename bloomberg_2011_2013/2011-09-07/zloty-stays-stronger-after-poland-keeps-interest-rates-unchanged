The zloty stayed stronger versus the
euro after the central bank kept the main interest rate
unchanged.  The zloty traded 0.1 percent stronger at 4.2272 per euro as
of 1:12 p.m. in Warsaw. The Narodowy Bank Polski kept the seven-
day interest rate at 4.5 percent, matching the expectations of
all 28 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Policy makers will
comment on the decision at a 4 p.m. conference in Warsaw.  To contact the reporter on this story:
