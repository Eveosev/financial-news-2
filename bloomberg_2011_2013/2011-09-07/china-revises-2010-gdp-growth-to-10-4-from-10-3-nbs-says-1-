China  raised its economic growth
estimate for 2010 to 10.4 percent from 10.3 percent.  The revision of gross domestic product was attributed to
higher growth in the secondary and tertiary industries, the
National Bureau of Statistics said on its  website  today.
Industries including manufacturing expanded 12.4 percent last
year compared with a previous estimate of 12.2 percent while
services grew 9.6 percent, 0.1 percentage points faster than
earlier data indicated, the NBS said.  Nominal GDP was revised to 40.1 trillion yuan ($6.27
trillion) from 39.8 trillion yuan, the bureau said.  --Victoria Ruan, Huiwen Yang. Editors: Nerys Avery,  John Liu   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
