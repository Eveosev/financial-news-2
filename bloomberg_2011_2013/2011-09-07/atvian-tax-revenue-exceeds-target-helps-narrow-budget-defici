Latvia ’s tax revenue was 2.56
billion lati ($5.07 billion) in the first eight months of the
year, 3.6 percent more than targeted, the  Finance Ministry  said.  The budget deficit may narrow to 4.5 percent of gross
domestic product this year from 7.7 percent in 2010 as a result
of the revenue increase, the ministry in the capital, Riga, said
in an e-mailed statement today.  Capital increases for state-owned companies and a possible
slowdown of economic growth in Latvia’s trading partners is a
risk to deficit-reduction plans, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
