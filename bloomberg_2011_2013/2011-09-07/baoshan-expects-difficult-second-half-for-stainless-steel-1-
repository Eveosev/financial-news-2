China ’s stainless-steel producers
may face a “difficult” second half because of overcapacity and
a global economic slowdown, said Baoshan Iron & Steel Co., the
country’s second-biggest maker of the alloy.  “We aren’t optimistic about the market,” Lou Dingbo,
general manager of Baoshan’s stainless steel division, said at a
conference in  Shanghai  today. “Economies, including China, are
slowing down and new capacities are ramping up supplies.”  Domestic producers including Lianzhong Stainless Steel
Corp., Jiuquan Iron & Steel Group Co. started new plants last
year, leading to lower prices. Baoshan’s stainless steel
division posted a profit margin of 0.9 percent in the first half,
compared with an average of 8.8 percent for all steel products,
the company said in its earnings report for the period.  China’s stainless-steel output may rise 6.2 percent to 12
million metric tons this year,  Li Cheng , the honorary chairman
of the Beijing-based Stainless Steel Council, said at the
conference.  By contrast, annual consumption will lag behind supply,
increasing as much as 7 percent to 10 million tons in 2011, Lou
said. Demand growth will remain at this pace in the next few
years, he said.  The country’s stainless steel exports may rise at least 30
percent this year to 2 million tons, after doubling to 1.5
million tons in 2010, according to Li.  Still, the order book for Baoshan’s stainless steel is full
in September, Lou said, without elaborating. The company’s
production base in Shanghai has a stainless steel output
capacity of 1.5 million tons a year, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
