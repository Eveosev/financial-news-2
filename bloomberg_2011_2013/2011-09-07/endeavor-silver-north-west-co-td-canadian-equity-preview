Canadian stocks declined for the
fourth time in five days, led by banks, after the  European
Central Bank  said economic risks intensified and U.S. jobless
claims increased.  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) , Canada’s second-largest lender by
assets, fell 1.7 percent after saying it will sell 8 million
shares at C$76.50 a share. Transat A.T. Inc., Canada’s largest
tour operator, slumped 9.3 percent after forecasting fourth-
quarter results would be “inferior” to last year.       Barrick
Gold Corp. (ABX)  climbed 1.7 percent, as the price of the metal
rebounded from a two-day slump on demand for a haven.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index fell 36.60
points, or 0.3 percent, to 12,683.96 at 4 p.m. in Toronto, after
rising as much as 0.2 percent earlier today.  “We’re at risk of considerable disappointment on the
economic front in  Canada  just because of what’s going on all
around us,” Danielle Park, a partner at Venable Park Investment
Counsel Inc. in Barrie, Ontario, said in a telephone interview.
Venable manages at least C$1 million ($1.02 million) each for
more than 250 families. “Gold’s been in a big bull run, and the
Canadian gold companies actually had a bit of a breakout last
week, which is potentially bullish for gold mining companies.”  The S&P/TSX has fallen 0.7 percent this month and 5.7
percent for the year. In the past week, the U.S. reported
employment didn’t increase in August and German Chancellor
Angela Merkel’s party was defeated in a state election as she
failed to sway voters with a campaign based on her handling of
the euro-area debt crisis.  Threats Worsen  ECB officials meeting in  Frankfurt  today kept the benchmark
 interest rate  at 1.5 percent, while saying risks to the economic
recovery have intensified. ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet 
said threats to the euro region have worsened and inflation
risks have eased, giving officials the option to take further
action should the debt crisis worsen.  U.S. claims for  unemployment benefits  rose by 2,000 to
414,000 in the week ended Sept. 3, the Labor Department said.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News projected a drop in claims
to 405,000, according to the median forecast.  President Barack Obama is scheduled to speak tonight to a
joint session of Congress on his package to spark more job
growth. His $300 billion plan includes an extension of a payroll
tax cut for workers, which expires at the end of this year, and
also would reduce the portion of the payroll tax paid by
employers.  Bernanke’s Statement  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said today policy
makers will discuss the tools they could use to boost the
recovery at their next meeting this month and stand ready to use
them if necessary.  Barrick rallied 1.7 percent to C$54.61 as the precious
metal climbed 2.2 percent in  New York  after a two-day decline of
3.2 percent.  Goldcorp Inc. (G)  advanced 1.6 percent to C$55.30,
while  Yamana Gold Inc. (YRI)  rallied 4.5 percent to C$17.20. A group
of Canadian gold companies climbed to its highest level since at
least January 1988.  Toronto-Dominion dropped 1.7 percent to C$76.31, leading an
index of banking shares on its fourth decline in five days.  Bank
of Nova Scotia (BNS)  declined 0.8 percent to C$52.81.  Bank of Montreal (BMO) 
dropped 1.2 percent to C$59.63.  NovaGold Resources Inc. (NG) , which is developing gold and base-
metals properties in Alaska and British Columbia, had its share-
price estimate lowered to C$10.50 from C$10.75 at National Bank
Financial Inc., which said the company’s “financing needs
continue to increase.” The shares slid 10 percent to C$9.44,
for the biggest decline in the benchmark equity index.  Revenue Miss  Transat, based in Montreal, lost the second-most, slipping
9.3 percent to C$7.25. In addition to its fourth-quarter
outlook, the company’s third-quarter revenue fell short of
analyst projections, Bloomberg data show.  Primero Mining Corp. (P) , the precious-metals producer based in
Vancouver, plunged 14 percent to C$3.07. The company cut its
forecast for gold production, citing a monthlong strike and
lower-than-estimated gold grades.  The Canadian benchmark equity index is trading at 16.3
times reported earnings, about 24 percent higher than the  S&P
500  in the U.S., and about 9.5 percent less than its 2011
average of 18, before today, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
