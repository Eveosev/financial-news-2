Coffee exports from Uganda,  Africa ’s
second-biggest producer of the crop, jumped 42 percent in August
amid an improved harvest in the southern and southwestern
regions, the Uganda Coffee Development Authority said.  Shipments climbed to 309,303 60-kilogram (132-pound) bags
from 217,284 bags a year earlier, the agency said in a statement
e-mailed yesterday from the capital, Kampala. Exports surpassed
an earlier forecast of 240,000 bags, though they were less than
the 375,843 bags shipped in July as the harvest draws to a
close, it said.  Exports in the 12 months through Sept. 30 may be as much as
12 percent higher than an April forecast of 2.6 million bags
because of the better harvest, the agency said in August. The
southern and southwestern regions gather their main crop from
April through August.  Uganda  ranks behind  Ethiopia  as the continent’s largest
exporter of coffee, according to the website of the
 International Coffee Organization . The robusta variety accounts
for about 85 percent of the East African nation’s annual
production of the beans.  Exports from the start of the season on Oct. 1 through
August climbed to 2.8 million bags, from 2.5 million bags a year
earlier, according a tally of the authority’s figures by
Bloomberg.  The East African nation, where yields declined from 4.4
million bags in 1996-97 partly because of crop damage caused by
the coffee wilt disease, plans to increase production to 4.5
million a season by 2015 through an ongoing replanting program,
according to the agency.  The country consumes less than 3 percent of its annual
output, according to the Eastern African Fine Coffee
Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
