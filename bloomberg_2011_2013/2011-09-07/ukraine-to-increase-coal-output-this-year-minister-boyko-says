Ukraine will increase coal output
this year by about 8 percent compared with 2010, said Yuriy Boyko, coal and energy minister.  Miners may raise production by 4.5 million to 5 million
metric tons, Boyko told reporters today at a weekly government
meeting in the capital, Kiev. He didnâ€™t give total production
figures for either this year or last. Coal output was 75.2
million tons last year, according to Energy and Coal Ministry
data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
