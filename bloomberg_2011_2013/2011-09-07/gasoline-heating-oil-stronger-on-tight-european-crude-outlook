Gasoline rose the most in a week,
following equities and crude higher, on speculation that U.S.
President Barack Obama will propose measures to boost the
economy.  Futures climbed as the Standard & Poor’s 500 stock index
gained 2.8 percent at 2:50 p.m. in New York. Obama may seek more
than $300 billion of tax cuts, infrastructure spending and aid
to state and local governments in an address to Congress
tomorrow.  “You’re basically seeing products being driven up by crude
and crude driven up by the equities going higher,” said Bill O’Grady, chief market strategist at Confluence Investment
Management in St. Louis.  Gasoline for October delivery rose 8.54 cents, or 3
percent, to settle at $2.908 a gallon on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.  Stocks and petroleum futures also gained as Germany’s top
court rejected challenges to the participation of Europe’s
largest economy in euro rescue funds.  “Both oil prices and stock markets rallied on the news
that the German court saying it was legal for that government to
assist in the bailout of other EU countries,” said Andy Lipow,
president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  Heating oil for October delivery gained 6.54 cents, or 2.2
percent, to settle at $3.0756 a gallon. It’s the biggest rise
since Aug. 10.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, fell 0.3
cent to $3.657 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA data. It’s
the second consecutive drop in price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
