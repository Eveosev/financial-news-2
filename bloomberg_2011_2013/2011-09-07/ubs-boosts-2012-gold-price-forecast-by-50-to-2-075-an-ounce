UBS AG (UBSN)  boosted its 2012 gold-price
forecast by 50 percent, citing “ongoing global macroeconomic
disappointments.”  The metal will average $2,075 an ounce next year, up from
an earlier estimate of $1,380, the bank said today in a report.
Prices will average $1,725 in 2013, compared with a previous
forecast of $1,200, UBS analysts led by London-based Edel Tully
said.  Bullion has surged 28 percent this year, touching a record
$1,923.70 an ounce in New York yesterday, as escalating debt
woes in Europe and the U.S. spurred concern that the global
economy will falter, lifting demand for haven assets. Gold is in
the 11th year of a  bull market  as record-low U.S. borrowing
costs boosted demand for an inflation hedge.  “The maintenance of U.S. rates close to zero means that
gold is not in competition with assets that offer yield,” UBS
said. “Economic growth expectations globally are declining,
high debt burdens in  Europe  will continue to hamper growth, and
the risk of a U.S. recession is rising. All of these factors are
individually positive for gold. Taken together, they are a
potentially explosive cocktail.”  Federal  Reserve Bank  of Chicago President  Charles Evans 
said that the central bank should move “aggressively” to
reduce unemployment and “seriously consider” further stimulus
measures. The Fed has pledged to hold rates low for about two
years. Unemployment has remained at around 9 percent or higher
since April 2009.  Gold futures for December delivery fell $55.70, or 3
percent, to settle at $1,817.60 on the Comex in New York.  The metal will be “increasingly used as the line of
defense against additional negative market outcomes,” UBS said.
“Money will likely flow into the gold market over the months
ahead and into 2012, and this should have significant price
implications.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
