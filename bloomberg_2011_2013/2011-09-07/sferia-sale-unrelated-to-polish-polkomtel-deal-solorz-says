Zygmunt Solorz-Zak sold telephone
operator Sferia SA, the Polish billionaire said today, declining
to comment on the price or the buyer’s identity.  The sale is unrelated to his application for antitrust
approval to buy mobile operator Polkomtel SA, Solorz told
reporters in Tarnow, denying a report in the Parkiet newspaper
today.  Solorz doesn’t plan to sell his stake in power plant ZE PAK
and is willing to share control of the Polsat pension fund, he
said. It’s too early to discuss an initial public offering of
Polkomtel, Solorz said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
