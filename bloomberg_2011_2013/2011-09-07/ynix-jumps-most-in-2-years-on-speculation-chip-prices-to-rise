Hynix Semiconductor Inc. (000660) , the
world’s second-largest maker of computer-memory chips, jumped
the most in more than two years on speculation that chip prices
will recover.  Hynix rose 14.7 percent to close at 19,500 won on the Korea
Exchange, the biggest gain since April 2009. The benchmark Kospi
index advanced 3.8 percent. Hynix dropped 21 percent last month.  The price of the benchmark DDR3 2-gigabit DRAM has fallen 3
percent this month after falling 14 percent in August, according
to data from Taipei-based Dramexchange Technology Inc., operator
of  Asia ’s largest spot market for semiconductors.  “There’s some consensus that the chip market is near its
bottom,” Ahn Seong Ho, an analyst at Hanwha Securities Co. who
covers technology stocks, said in  Seoul  today.  -- Editors: Shinhye Kang, Drew Gibson  To contact the reporter on this story:
