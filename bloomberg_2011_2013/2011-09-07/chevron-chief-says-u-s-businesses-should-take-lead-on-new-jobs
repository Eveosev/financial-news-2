Chevron Corp. (CVX)  Chief Executive
Officer John Watson urged President Barack Obama to cut
regulations and expand offshore oil drilling rather than use
subsidies to create jobs.  The administration should abandon efforts to repeal about
$4 billion a year in oil and gas tax breaks and reconsider an
Environmental Protection Agency rule on greenhouse-gas emissions
to control  climate change , Watson said today at a conference in
Washington. The EPA regulation will raise energy costs and
hinder growth, he said at the meeting sponsored by The Hill
newspaper and American Petroleum Institute industry group.  “I would be delighted to invest more in the oil and gas
industry,” Watson said. The industry responds to the “fiscal
and regulatory environment we are given,” he said.  Obama is set to outline his proposals to help lower
unemployment from 9.1 percent in an address to Congress tomorrow
night. Payroll growth stalled last month, the Labor Department
reported Sept. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
