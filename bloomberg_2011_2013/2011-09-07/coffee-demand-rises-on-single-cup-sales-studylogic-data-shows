(Corrects third paragraph to show Nespresso sales in in-
home coffee demand in story published Sept. 7.)  Coffee demand in the U.S., the
world’s biggest consumer, rose 2 percent in the year ended June
30 on rising sales of packages for single-serve, home-brewing
machines, according to research firm StudyLogic.  Americans drank 77.4 billion cups of coffee valued at
$35.79 billion during the 12-month period, Samuel Nahmias, chief
operating officer for the  Long Island , New York-based StudyLogic
said in an e-mailed statement.  At-work consumption increased 6.3 percent to 6.56 billion
cups, reflecting “new employees plus sales of new single-serve
machines,” including the Keurig unit of Waterbury, Vermont-
based  Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc. (GMCR) , Nahmias said. In-home
demand, including sales at supermarkets and groceries, rose 1.4
percent to 62.59 billion cups, also driven by single-serve
machines from Keurig and Nespresso, owned by Swiss-based food
company Nestle SA.  “Consumers are rapidly choosing single-serve machines over
regular drip and percolator-based beverages,” Nahmias said.  Away from home, including sales at restaurants, hotels and
coffee-shops, demand grew 2.4 percent to 8.26 billion cups,
lifted by sales of blended frozen coffee and iced espresso, the
StudyLogic data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
