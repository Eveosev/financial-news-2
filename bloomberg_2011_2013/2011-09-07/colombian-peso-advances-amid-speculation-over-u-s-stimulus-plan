Colombia’s peso rose, after four
days of declines, amid speculation U.S. President  Barack Obama 
plans to inject more than $300 billion into the world’s biggest
economy next year to bolster growth.  The peso gained 0.1 percent to 1,790.59 per dollar at 2:24
p.m. New York time, from 1,791.50 yesterday.  “Markets are reacting positively to news on U.S.
stimulus,” said Jose Luis Alayon, an analyst at Bogota-based
brokerage Acciones y Valores SA. “The measures will likely
boost liquidity in the market and so we’re seeing some appetite
for risk today.”  Obama is set to lay out his plans in an address to Congress
tomorrow as unemployment remains at 9.1 percent more than two
years after the recession’s official end. The U.S. is Colombia’s
biggest trading partner, buying about 40 percent of the South
American nation’s exports.  The yield on  Colombia ’s 10 percent bonds due in July 2024
fell five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 7.19
percent. The bond’s price rose 0.462 centavo to 123.060 centavos
per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
