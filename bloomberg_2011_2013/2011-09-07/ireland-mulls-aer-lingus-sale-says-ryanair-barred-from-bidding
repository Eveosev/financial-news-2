Ireland’s government said it may
dispose of its Aer Lingus Group Plc shares in a drive to raise
cash.  Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA)  said it may sell its own holding in
the smaller airline after being told it won’t be allowed to bid.  The state might sell its 25 percent stake in Dublin-based
Aer Lingus at the “right price to the right buyer,” Irish
Transport Minister Leo Varadkar said today in an interview,
while rejecting Ryanair as a buyer on competition grounds.  Ryanair won’t bid if an offer would be “unwelcome,” though
“this may result in the government realizing a lower price,”
 Europe ’s biggest discount airline said in a statement. The
company would welcome another financially strong airline or
investor taking the stake, and would not rule out entering talks
to sell its own 30 percent holding to that party, it said.  Varadkar said in the interview that the government has no
objection in principle to selling its  Aer Lingus (AERL)  stock, though
wouldn’t accept less than 1 euro per share.  Aer Lingus closed 6.3 percent higher at 67.5 cents in
Dublin today, paring the stock’s decline this year to 37 percent
and valuing the company at 357 million euros. Ryanair advanced
4.7 percent and is down 18 percent for the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
