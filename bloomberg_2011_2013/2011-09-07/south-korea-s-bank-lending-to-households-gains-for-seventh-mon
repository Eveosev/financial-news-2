South Korea ’s bank lending to
households rose for a seventh straight month in August, adding
pressure on the central bank to raise  interest rates  further.  Lending to households increased by 2.5 trillion won ($2.3
billion) last month to a record 448 trillion won, the Bank of
 Korea  said in an e-mailed statement today.  Central Bank Governor Kim Choong Soo and his board raised
borrowing costs three times this year in an attempt to curb
rising household debt and inflation that hit a three-year high
last month. The board will leave the policy rate at 3.25 percent
for a third month tomorrow as they gauge the global economic
recovery, according to 14 of 18 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News. The remaining four predict an increase.  Mortgage lending rose 1.2 trillion won to 298.6 trillion
won, today’s report showed. Loans to companies advanced 3.1
trillion won to 548.9 trillion won.  The broadest measure of  money supply , M2, gained 3.2
percent in July from a year earlier, compared with a 3 percent
increase in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
