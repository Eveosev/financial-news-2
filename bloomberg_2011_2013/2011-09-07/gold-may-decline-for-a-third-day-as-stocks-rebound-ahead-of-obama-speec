Gold futures gained for the first
time in three days after an unexpected rise in U.S. jobless
claims spurred demand for the metal as a haven asset.  Claims for  unemployment benefits  rose 2,000 to 414,000 in
the week ended Sept. 3, the government said. Economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News projected a drop to 405,000, according to the
median forecast. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said
policy makers will discuss this month the tools that they may
use to boost the recovery. Yesterday, gold tumbled 3 percent
after surging to a record $1,923.70 an ounce on Sept. 6.  “Things aren’t looking very positive, and the market
continues to remain skittish,”  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior
market strategist at MF Global Holdings Inc. in Chicago, said in
a telephone interview. “We need some results to show that jobs
will be created.”  Gold futures for December delivery gained $39.90, or 2.2
percent, to settle at $1,857.50 at 2:18 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. The metal has gained 31 percent this year as debt woes
mounted in  Europe  and the U.S.  Spot gold is in the 11th year of a bull market, the longest
winning streak since at least 1920, as investors seek to
diversify from equities and some currencies. European Central
Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said today that risks to the
economic recovery have intensified.  Yesterday, UBS AG boosted its forecast for the 2012 average
price of gold by 50 percent to $2,075. The bank cited a
“potentially explosive cocktail” for the metal amid low
 interest rates , escalating debt in Europe and the risk of a U.S.
recession.  ‘Poor’ Macro Trend  “The main trend is that things will remain poor from a
macro perspective, and that will support gold,”  Dan Smith , an
analyst at Standard Chartered Plc in London, said in a phone
interview. “We’re heading into a good period for seasonal
demand, and people are taking the opportunity to pick up gold on
these dips.”  Silver futures for December delivery rose 89.9 cents, or
2.2 percent, to settle at $42.53 an ounce on the Comex. The
price has gained 37 percent this year.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery rose $25.80, or 1.4 percent, to $1,854.50 an
ounce. Palladium futures for December delivery gained $12.60, or
1.7 percent, to $765.30 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
