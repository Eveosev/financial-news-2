Saudi Arabia , the world’s largest
importer of barley, reported a 3.2 percent increase in purchases
of foreign food in July as local demand climbed before the start
of the religious month of Ramadan.  Food shipments to the Arab world’s biggest economy rose to
1.78 million tons -- the highest since the start of the year --
from 1.72 million tons in July 2010, the Saudi  Port Authority  in
Riyadh said on its  website  today.  Saudi Arabia relies on imports to feed its population of 27
million. Food consumption reaches its peak in the Sunni-Muslim
kingdom during Ramadan, which began on Aug. 1.  Food imports in the first seven months of 2011 fell to 9.54
million tons from 11.7 million tons a year earlier, the data
showed. Saudi Arabia imported less barley this year as
stockpiles of grain that were bought in 2010, when prices were
low, were sold off.  New letters of credit for grain imports declined this year
compared with 2010, central bank data show. According to  Saudi
Arabian Monetary Agency  figures released on Aug. 25, new letters
of credit for grain importers were 270 million riyals ($72
million) in July compared 522 millions a year ago.  Saudi Arabia’s food imports are expected to rise in the
second half as the country imports between 7 million and 7.5
million metric tons of barley in 2011, Finance Minister Ibrahim al-Assaf told reporters today in  Abu Dhabi . The country seeks
long-term contracts for barley imports and is also looking at
agriculture investment in Ukraine, al-Assaf said. The government
is also increasing imports of wheat this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
