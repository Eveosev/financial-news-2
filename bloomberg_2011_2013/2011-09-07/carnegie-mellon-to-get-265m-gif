Carnegie Mellon University  will
receive a $265 million donation from retired steel executive
William S. Dietrich II, the largest gift in the school’s
history.  The gift, in the form of a fund, will become operational
upon Dietrich’s death, Pittsburgh-based Carnegie Mellon said
today in a statement. Its college of humanities and social
sciences will be renamed for his mother, Marianna Brown
Dietrich.  Dietrich, 73, is the former chairman of Dietrich Industries
Inc., a steel manufacturer in Pittsburgh, which was sold to
Worthington Industries in Columbus, Ohio in 1996. The source of
the fund is the Dietrich Charitable Trusts, whose assets were
generated primarily by that sale.  Carnegie Mellon “is one of a handful of universities in the
world that has the potential to become a truly global
institution,” Dietrich, a trustee, said in the statement. He
called the school “a great investment.”  Carnegie Mellon was established in 1900 by industrialist
and philanthropist  Andrew Carnegie . It also has campuses in
 California ’s  Silicon Valley  and in Qatar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
