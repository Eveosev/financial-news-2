Avusa Ltd. (AVU) , the publisher of  South
Africa ’s largest weekend broadsheet newspaper, ended talks with
a group of investors led by Capitau Holdings Ltd. after the
bidders failed to secure funding because of tax changes.  Backers of Capitau’s bid won’t provide funding commitments
until the South African Revenue Service and National Treasury
have confirmed that interest related to the deal is tax
deductible, Johannesburg-based Avusa in a statement today. A
panel appointed by Avusa was notified that Capitau “isn’t in a
position” to make a firm offer, it said.  The Treasury on  June 2  announced an 18-month suspension of
Section 45 of the Income Tax Act, a move that may tax some
inter-company transactions. The changes scuppered transactions
planned by Palabora Mining Co. and Mustek Ltd., which scrapped a
buyout by management and private equity investors. Avusa said it
couldn’t grant the bidders an indefinite period to make an
offer.  Capitau, in a group with funders, had on March 29 expressed
interest to buy all the shares in Avusa for 2.7 billion rand
($378 million). It was allowed four weeks to conduct a due
diligence on the company, and agreed to make a binding offer by
the close of business today. Avusa closed unchanged at 22.70
rand after falling 3.8 percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
