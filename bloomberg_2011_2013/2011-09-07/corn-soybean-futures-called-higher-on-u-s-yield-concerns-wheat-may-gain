What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 5 cents to 7 cents a bushel
higher on the  Chicago  Board of Trade after a government report
yesterday showed that U.S. crop conditions as of Sept. 4
deteriorated to the lowest rating since 2005,  Jim Gerlach , the
president of A/C Trading Inc. in Fowler, Indiana, said in a
telephone interview.  -- Soybean futures may open 6 cents to 8 cents a bushel higher
in Chicago on speculation that  dry weather  in the past month
stunted plant development, Gerlach said. Soybean-oil futures are
expected to open up 0.4 cent to 0.5 cent a pound, and soybean-
meal futures may open $2 to $3 higher for 2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open 6 cents to 9 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  on speculation that rising global equities and a
decline by the dollar will boost demand for grain from the U.S.,
Gerlach said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
