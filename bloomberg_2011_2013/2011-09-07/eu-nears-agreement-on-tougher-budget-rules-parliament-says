Euro-area budget-deficit rules are
set to be toughened under a tentative compromise by national
representatives and the European Parliament, lawmakers said.  The deal would make it easier to impose sanctions on
countries that let their budgets slip, even before the deficit
tops the euro-area limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product.  “We are not completely out of the tunnel yet but the end
is in sight,”  Guy Verhofstadt , head of the Liberals in the
parliament, said in an e-mailed statement in Brussels today.  The penalties are the keynote of a six-part legislative
package that includes closer monitoring of national economic
competitiveness as the European Union draws lessons from the
debt crisis.  France  had been the last holdout against the parliament’s
push for automatic “preventive” sanctions before deficits go
over the legal limit.  Details still being fought over include the parliament’s
call for surveillance of countries like  Germany  with trade
surpluses.  Negotiators from the parliament and national governments
will meet again in Strasbourg, France next week to try to make
further progress.  To contact the reporter on this story:
