VeriSign Inc. (VRSN)  rose 7.6 percent on
the Nasdaq Stock Market after canceling appearances at two
investment conferences, fueling speculation that the company is
in talks to be acquired.  Pulling out of two events without explanation suggests that
a “significant corporate action may be pending,” said Ed Maguire, an analyst at Credit Agricole Securities Inc. in New
York. While the company may be preparing to announce a new chief
executive officer, a management change alone wouldn’t warrant
the stock surge, he said.  The likely buyer would be a private-equity firm, which
could shake up the company to boost profit, Maguire said. There
have been more than 380 private-equity deals announced in the
U.S. technology industry in the past year, with an average size
of about $102 million and a premium of 48 percent, Bloomberg
data show. VeriSign, which operates computers that direct
Internet traffic, has a market value of $5.74 billion.  “VeriSign is an attractive (albeit expensive) target for
private equity, given the highly recurring cash flows and
untapped earnings leverage in the model,” Maguire, who
recommends buying the shares, said in a report to clients.  VeriSign rose $2.44 to $34.50 at 4 p.m. New York time,
following a jump of 6.8 percent yesterday. Before this week, the
shares had dropped 8.1 percent this year.  Canceled Appearances  VeriSign backed out of an appearance at a ThinkEquity LLC
conference next week, following a cancellation of its
presentation at a Citigroup Inc. gathering. Ben Petro, who runs
the company’s security services unit, had been scheduled to
appear at the ThinkEquity event, with Chief Financial Officer
Brian Robins handling the Citigroup meeting.  VeriSign has been without a CEO since Mark McLaughlin left
last month to take the top job at Palo Alto Networks Inc. Dan Cummins, an analyst at ThinkEquity in New York, said the
leadership change may be at the root of the cancellations.  The company didn’t give a reason for backing out of the
meetings. Jeannie McPherson, a spokeswoman for the Dulles,
Virginia-based company, didn’t respond to a call or e-mail
seeking comment. After the Citigroup cancellation yesterday, she
said “there is no reason to report.”  CEO Departure  After McLaughlin announced plans to leave VeriSign, founder
and Chairman Jim Bidzos took over as interim CEO. Bidzos also
served as interim CEO in July 2008, when former chief William Roper unexpectedly quit.  In May 2010, VeriSign canceled a presentation at a JPMorgan
Chase & Co. conference, citing a scheduling conflict. A day
later, it announced plans to sell its authentication-services
unit to Symantec Corp. for $1.28 billion.  VeriSign has unloaded about a dozen of its “non-core”
businesses since November 2007, an effort to focus on its main
operations. The company manages the Internet’s dot-com and dot-
net addresses.  Blackstone Group LP led the biggest private-equity
acquisition of a technology company in the past year, when it
agreed to buy  Emdeon Inc. (EM)  last month for $3 billion. Other deals
include Golden Gate Capital Corp.’s acquisition of Lawson
Software Inc. and Providence Equity Partners Inc.’s plan to
purchase  Blackboard Inc.  Private-equity firms often borrow funds to acquire company,
seeking to turn around the business and make a return on the
investment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
