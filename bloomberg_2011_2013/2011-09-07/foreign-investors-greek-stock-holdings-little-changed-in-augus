Foreign investors’ holdings in
companies listed on the Greek stock exchange were little changed
last month, according to data released by Hellenic Exchanges SA,
the operator of the Athens bourse.  Non-resident investors held 50.2 percent of the market
value of all stocks listed on the Athens Stock Exchange in
August, compared with 49.3 percent in August 2010. In July,
foreign investors owned 50 percent. The figure for June was 51
percent.  Greece ’s benchmark ASE share index has lost 36 percent this
year, as the country struggles to convince investors it will be
able to repay debt. Foreign investors accounted for 38.7 percent
of total turnover in August, according to today’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
