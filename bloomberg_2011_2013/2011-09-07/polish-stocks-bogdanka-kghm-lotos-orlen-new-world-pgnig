Poland ’s WIG20 Index rose for a
second day, adding 79.67, or 3.5 percent, to 2,369.75 at the
5:30 p.m. close in Warsaw.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  PKO Bank Polski SA (PKO PW), Poland’s biggest bank, rose
1.2 zloty, or 3.7 percent, to 33.39 zloty and  Bank Pekao SA (PEO)  , majority-owned by UniCredit SpA, climbed 5.8 zloty, or 4.2
percent, to 143 zloty.  Getin Holding SA (GTN)  , the financial-
services group controlled by billionaire Leszek Czarnecki,
increased 0.31 zloty, or 3.9 percent, to 8.34 zloty.  The zloty appreciated as much as 0.6 percent against the
franc, after yesterday’s 8.3 percent surge, easing concern
homeowners may default on their foreign-currency mortgage loans.
Franc-denominated mortgages totaled 162.2 billion zloty ($54.2
billion) in July, accounting for 54 percent of all home loans in
Poland, according to the country’s financial regulator.  Lubelski Wegiel Bogdanka SA (LWB)   jumped 4.3 zloty, or 4
percent, to 111.3 zloty, the highest close in more than a month
as Credit Suisse Group AG rated the coal producer “outperform”
in new coverage, setting its price estimate at 154 zloty a
share.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , the copper producer with the
biggest European mine output, gained 6.1 zloty, or 3.7 percent,
to 172 zloty, rising the most in a week as the price of the
metal advanced.  New World Resources Plc (NWR PW) climbed 1.9 zloty, or 7.1
percent, to 28.19 zloty in Warsaw trading, extending yesterday’s
8.6 percent increase. The Czech Republic’s largest coking-coal
producer was upgraded to “buy” from “sell” at Citigroup Inc.  PKN Orlen SA (PKN PW), Poland’s biggest oil company, rose
1.6 zloty, or 4.4 percent, to 37.8 zloty.  Grupa Lotos SA (LTS)  , the second-largest refiner, increased 0.79 zloty, or 2.9
percent, to 27.79 zloty. Oil advanced from the lowest in more
than a week in  New York  as a weather system in the  Gulf of
Mexico  threatened supplies in the U.S., where production halts
because of storms have already reduced crude stockpiles.  Polskie Gornictwo Naftowe i Gazownictwo SA (PGN)   fell
for the first time this week, losing 0.05 zloty, or 1.2 percent,
to 3.97 zloty. Poland’s biggest natural-gas company may need to
sell new shares to finance expansion, Chief Executive Officer
Michal Szubski told reporters today in Tarnow, southern Poland.  TVN SA (TVN)   climbed 0.44 zloty, or 3.4 percent, to 13.5
zloty, rising for the first time in four days. Poland’s largest
television network was upgraded to “buy” from “hold” at
Deutsche Bank AG.  To contact the reporter on this story:
