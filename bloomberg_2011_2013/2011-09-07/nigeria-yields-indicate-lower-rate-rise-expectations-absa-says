Nigerian yields, close to levels
reached at an auction last month, show the nation’s central bank
is less likely to raise  interest rates  as inflation remains
within the bank’s target, according to Absa Capital.  The yield on 10.7 percent government debt due 2018 rose
three basis points to 11.37 percent in the secondary market
yesterday, according to data on the  Financial Markets Dealers
Association  website. That compares with 11.39 percent at an Aug.
17 auction where the central bank sold 25 billion naira ($160
million) of the debt. The 10.5 percent bonds due 2014 climbed 11
basis points to 10.82 percent yesterday, compared with 10.75
percent at last month’s auction.  The Central Bank of  Nigeria  raised its benchmark rate to
8.75 percent last month, the fourth increase this year, to rein
in inflation. Price growth in  Africa ’s biggest oil producer
country decelerated to 9.4 percent in July, the lowest level in
more than three years. Governor Lamido Sanusi said in an
interview today in  Hong Kong  that the August rate was probably
the same as July’s 9.4 percent and below the bank’s 10 percent.  The last rate hike and lower inflation “brought real rates
across most of Nigeria’s yield curve into positive territory
which should be supportive of foreign inflows,” Dumisani Ngwenya and Ridle Markus, Johannesburg-based strategists at Absa
Capital, wrote in an e-mailed note today. “We see a lower
probability of a policy rate hike at this month’s monetary
policy committee sitting.”  Sub-Saharan Africa’s second-biggest economy will sell as
much as to 85 billion naira of bonds maturing in 2014, 2015 and
2018 on Sept. 14, according to an  issuance calendar  on the
website of the Abuja-based Debt Management Office.  The naira weakened for a third day in interbank trading,
retreating 0.4 percent to 155.35 per dollar as of 11:57 a.m. in
Lagos, the lowest level since Aug. 23, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
