U.K. stocks advanced for a second
day, with the  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  posting its biggest rally since May
2010, as banks and commodity companies rallied the most in a
week.  Barclays Plc (BARC)  and  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  both climbed more
than 6 percent, while  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  led mining companies
higher, jumping 4.8 percent.  SuperGroup Plc (SGP)  rallied 7 percent as
the owner of the Superdry clothing brand reported a 66 percent
gain in first-quarter sales.  The FTSE 100 rose 161.75, or 3.1 percent, to 5,318.59 at
the 4:30 p.m. close in London, extending yesterday’s 1.1 percent
advance. The gauge has climbed 6.2 percent from this year’s
lowest level on Aug. 10 after a 16 percent slump from the start
of July dragged equities to their lowest price-to-earnings ratio
since March 2009. The gauge has still fallen 13 percent from
this year’s high in February.  “We are not on the edge of Armageddon,” said Justin Urquhart Stewart, who helps oversee about $3.3 billion at 7

growing. We’re seeing a nice little relief rally.”  The  FTSE All-Share Index (ASX)  gained 3 percent today, while
Ireland’s ISEQ Index rose 2.8 percent.  The Federal Reserve will release its Beige Book survey of
U.S. economic conditions today after the close of European
trading. President Barack Obama will address Congress tomorrow
on his plan to boost job growth.  German Court Decision  In Germany, the top court rejected three constitutional
challenges to the country’s participation in the euro rescue
funds. The Federal Constitution Court dismissed lawsuits
intended to block Germany’s share of a loans package for Greece
and a separate fund approved last year to stop the sovereign-
debt crisis from spreading.  Barclays, the U.K.’s second-largest bank by assets, surged
6.1 percent to 159.95 pence, snapping a three-day selloff.

Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  soared 6.1 percent to 22.46 pence.  A gauge of U.K. banks rose 4.2 percent, paring this week’s
drop. The cost of insuring against default on European sovereign
debt and bank debt surged to a record earlier this week amid
signs that European lenders may be struggling to get funding.  BHP Billiton , the world’s biggest mining company, jumped
