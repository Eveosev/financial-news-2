U.S. gasoline consumption dropped
5.9 percent last week as  Hurricane Irene  made its way up the
U.S. East Coast, according to  MasterCard Inc. (MA)   Motorists bought 8.74 million barrels a day in the week
ended Sept. 2, the second-biggest payments network company said
in its SpendingPulse report, down from 9.29 million the previous
week. Demand fell 4.2 percent from a year earlier.  Hurricane Irene, which struck North Carolina Aug. 27 and
made landfall in New York City a day later, knocked out power to
6.69 million homes and businesses and flooded roads and highways
in its path. The premium for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline in
New York Harbor jumped almost 17 cents to 25.13 cents above
futures in the week ended Sept. 2.  Gasoline use in  New England  was down 9.2 percent from a
week earlier and in Central Atlantic states demand fell 13
percent. West Coast consumption rose 0.2 percent.  The average pump price was $3.63 a gallon, up 5 cents from
the previous week and up 36 percent from a year earlier.  Averaged over four weeks, gasoline consumption was 3
percent below a year earlier. It was the 24th week in a row that
demand fell on that basis, according to MasterCard.  The report from Purchase, New York-based MasterCard is
assembled by MasterCard Advisors, the companyâ€™s consulting arm.
The information is based on credit-card swipes and cash and
check payments at about 140,000 U.S. gasoline stations.  Visa Inc. (V)  is the biggest payments network company by
transactions processed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
