U.S. and Kenyan government officials
will hold talks this month on introducing direct flights between
the two countries, the  Daily Nation  reported, citing Tourism
Minister Najib Balala.  U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray Lahood will arrive in
Nairobi on Sept. 30 for what Kenya expects will be the final
meeting on the issue, the newspaper cited Balala as saying.  In June 2009, a plan to introduce direct flights was
shelved because the U.S. government said Kenya was unsafe, the
Nation said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
