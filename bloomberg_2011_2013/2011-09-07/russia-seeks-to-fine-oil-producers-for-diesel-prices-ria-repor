Russia ’s competition watchdog plans
to fine four of the country’s largest oil producers for
inflating diesel prices at the end of 2010 and beginning of
2011, RIA Novosti reported, citing  Igor Artemyev , the head of
the Federal Anti-Monopoly Service.  The regulator found that OAO Rosneft, OAO Lukoil, TNK-BP
and OAO Gazprom Neft sold oil products domestically at prices
higher than in global markets, the state-run news service said
today, citing Artemyev in Rostov-on-Don, southern Russia.  The watchdog claimed more than 26 billion rubles ($880
million) from  oil companies  during two waves of cases over
refined-product prices since 2008, while agreeing to lower the
fines to 15 billion rubles, the news service said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
