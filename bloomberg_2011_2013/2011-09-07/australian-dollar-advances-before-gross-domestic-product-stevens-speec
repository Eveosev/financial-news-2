The Australian dollar climbed for
the first time in four days against its U.S. counterpart after a
government report showed the economy expanded in the second
quarter at a faster pace than analysts had forecast.  The currency, called the Aussie, gained against most of its
major peers as  Reserve Bank  of Australia Governor  Glenn Stevens 
signaled a willingness to keep the developed world’s highest
interest rates on hold. New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the
kiwi, gained the most in a week versus the U.S. currency as
Asian stocks rose, supporting demand for higher-yielding assets.  “The Aussie is holding its gains because the RBA was quite
upbeat about the outlook for Australia,” said  Annette Beacher ,
head of Asia-Pacific research at Toronto-Dominion Bank’s TD
Securities unit. “That has been followed up pretty quickly by
strong GDP.”  Australia’s currency rose 1.2 percent to $1.0610 at 12:17
p.m. in  New York , from $1.0484 yesterday. It strengthened 0.9
percent to 82.18 yen, from 81.42.  The  New Zealand dollar  gained 0.8 percent to 82.89 U.S.
cents, after earlier climbing as much as 1.1 percent, the
biggest intraday jump since Aug. 30. The kiwi gained 0.5 percent
to 64.21 yen, from 63.89.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of stocks rose 2.2 percent,
rebounding from yesterday’s 1.5 percent decline. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 advanced 2.1 percent.  Australia ’s gross domestic product expanded 1.2 percent
from the first quarter, when it contracted a revised 0.9
percent, the Bureau of Statistics said today. The median
estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was for a 1
percent increase. The RBA’s cash target rate is 4.75 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
