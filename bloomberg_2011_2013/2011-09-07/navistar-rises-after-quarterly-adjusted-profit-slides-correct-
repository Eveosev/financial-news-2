(Corrects headline to say shares rose.)  Navistar International Corp. (NAV) , the
maker of International brand trucks, rose less than a percent
after its third-quarter profit slid, excluding some items, as
the results of its largest operating unit declined.  Navistar rose 32 cents to $39.12 at 4:03 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading.  The company reported a profit of $61 million, or 79 cents a
share, excluding an income tax allowance of $1.48 billion. On
that basis, the average estimate of analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was $1.26 a share. In the year-ago quarter, Navistar
had a profit excluding items of $107 million, or $1.44 a share.  The share of truck sales to fleet buyers also has been
increasing, which raises volume while cutting profit, Chief
Executive Officer Dan Ustian said on a conference call. Prices
of trucks sold to fleets may be as much 10 percent lower
compared with a single truck sale at a dealership, he said.  Navistar, based in Warrenville,  Illinois , reported a $75
million loss in its truck unit as more military truck orders
were shifted to the quarter ending Oct. 31. The unit’s
profitability will improve this quarter, Ustian said on the
conference call.  A decline in “higher revenue” defense business and
“higher costs associated with the supply chain” affected the
truck unit’s results, David Leiker, an analyst at Robert W.
Baird & Co. in  Milwaukee , wrote in a research note.  The company’s third-quarter revenue rose 9.8 percent to
$3.54 billion. Navistar’s net income rose to $1.4 billion, or
$18.24 a share, from $117 million or $1.56 a share, a year ago.  Navistar also said today it will buy back as much as $175
million of its shares. Navistar has dropped 32 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
