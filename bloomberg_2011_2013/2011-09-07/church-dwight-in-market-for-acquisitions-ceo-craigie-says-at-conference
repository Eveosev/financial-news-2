 Church & Dwight Co.’s best option
to create shareholder value is through acquisitions as consumer
spending remains weak, Chief Executive Officer James Craigie
said.  While the maker of Arm & Hammer baking soda and Trojan
condoms is well positioned to appeal to low-income and high-
income shoppers, the ailing economy provides deal opportunities,
Craigie told investors today at a conference hosted by Barclays
Capital in Boston.  “The absolute best way for us to create value for
shareholders is through acquisitions,” he said, noting that
Church & Dwight’s last large purchase was in July 2008 when it
paid $380 million for Del Pharmaceuticals Inc., maker of Orajel
baby teething products.  “As pessimistic as I am about the economy, I’ve never been
more optimistic about the M&A environment” as companies
anticipating a slump look to sell businesses, Craigie said.  Consumer spending power is “as bad as ever, and I think
it’s going to get worse,” Craigie said, with job losses
possibly climbing as governments cut back to balance budgets.  “I wouldn’t be surprised at all if unemployment goes over
10 percent within the next six to 12 months,” Craigie said.
“This is as ugly or uglier business environment I’m seeing than
ever in the past.”  Church & Dwight, based in Princeton, New Jersey, rose 25
cents to $43.11 at 4:03 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. The shares have advanced 25 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
