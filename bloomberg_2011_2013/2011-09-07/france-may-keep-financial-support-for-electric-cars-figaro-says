France  is likely to maintain
financial support for electric- and hybrid cars as the
government seeks to encourage their use, Le Figaro said.  Industry Minister Eric Besson is very optimistic about the
country maintaining payments of between 2,000 euros ($2,811) and
5,000 euros for such purchases in 2012, the paper cited the
official as saying.  Besson yesterday met with the top executives of car
companies, including  Carlos Ghosn  for Renault and Philippe Varin
for PSA Peugeot Citroen, to discuss ways of encouraging
electric-car sales and the executives signed a document with 10
points that favor development in that area, Le Figaro said,
without specifying where it got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
