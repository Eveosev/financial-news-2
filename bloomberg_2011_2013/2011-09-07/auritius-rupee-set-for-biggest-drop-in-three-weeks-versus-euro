Mauritius’s rupee headed for the
biggest drop in almost three weeks against the euro, the
currency of its main trading partners.  The Indian Ocean island nation’s currency depreciated as
much as 1.9 percent to 40.1456 per euro and traded 1.1 percent
down at 39.8232 by 1:04 p.m. in  Port Louis , the capital, heading
for the biggest decrease on a closing basis since Aug. 19,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Versus the dollar, the
rupee weakened 0.3 percent to 28.25.  “Entities holding foreign currency are very cautious in
selling today, adding upward pressure on the exchange rate,”
Fabien Gebert, treasurer at GML, which describes itself as
Mauritius’s largest investment company by assets, said by phone.  The dollar fell against the euro, snapping a six-day
advance, as stock gains and the  Swiss National Bank ’s decision
to set a currency ceiling yesterday damped demand for the
world’s main reserve currency. The euro extended gains after
 Germany ’s top court rejected constitutional challenges to the
nation’s participation in the region’s rescue funds. T  Europe  is the largest buyer of Mauritius’s manufactured
goods at 65 percent, the  Central Statistics Office  said on Aug.
30. Tourists from Europe account for almost two-thirds of
arrivals to the country, according to the Mauritius Tourism
Promotion Authority.  Buying prices for the dollar range ranged from 27.4027 to
27.5711 and the selling price rose to 28.8724 compared with
28.8101 yesterday, according to indicative exchange rates
published today on the  Bank of Mauritius’s website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
