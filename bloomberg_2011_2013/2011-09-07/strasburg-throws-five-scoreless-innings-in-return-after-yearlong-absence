Stephen Strasburg  struck out four in
five scoreless innings in his return to the  Washington Nationals 
after a yearlong injury layoff.  Strasburg, 23, threw 40 strikes and allowed two hits with
56 pitches in a 7-3 defeat to the  Los Angeles Dodgers  at
Nationals Park in  Washington  last night. The right-hander left
the mound with the Nationals leading 3-0.  Strasburg, who signed a record $15 million, four-year
contract with the Nationals, had so-called Tommy John surgery to
replace a ligament on Sept. 4, 2010, two weeks after he injured
his pitching arm in a win over Philadelphia.  Strasburg set a major league record with 41 strikeouts in
his first four starts last season and went 5-3 with a 2.92
earned run average and 92 strikeouts in 68 innings.  Strasburg scored his first career run as the Nationals took
a 3-0 lead in the second inning. The top pick in the 2009 Major
League Baseball draft reached second base on an error by Dodgers
starter Ted Lilly, went to third on Ian Desmond’s single and
darted home on Jayson Werth’s groundout.  The Dodgers tied the game with three runs in the sixth
inning.  Rain held up the seventh inning for 31 minutes and Rod Barajas hit a two-run double in the eighth to make it 5-3 to  Los
Angeles . Ethier doubled to add two more runs in the ninth.  Kenley Jansen (2-1) got the win after striking out three in
the seventh inning. Henry Rodriguez (3-3), one of six Nationals
pitchers, allowed two runs on three hits in one inning for the
loss.  To contact the reporter on this story:
