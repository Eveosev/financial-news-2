Mozambique will spend $54 million
upgrading two hydroelectric  power plants  in Manica province,
Agencia de Informacao de Mocambique reported, citing Energy

part of plans to provide electricity to all of the countryâ€™s 128
districts by 2014, the Maputo-based  news agency  reported. About
102 regionals are connected to the national grid, up from five
districts in 1974 at the time of independence from Portugal, it
