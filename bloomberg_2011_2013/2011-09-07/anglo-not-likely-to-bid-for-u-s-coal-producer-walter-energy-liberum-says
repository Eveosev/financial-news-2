Anglo American Plc (AAL) , a miner of coal
in Australia,  South Africa  and Colombia, is unlikely to make an
offer for U.S.-based  Walter Energy Inc. (WLT)  mainly because of the
location of its reserves, Liberum Capital Ltd. said.  “Anglo has negligible presence in U.S. coal markets, plus
landlocked U.S. coal is less exposed to export seaborne
markets,” London-based Liberum said today in a note. The
London-based  Times  newspaper reported earlier that Anglo may be
weighing an offer.  Walter Energy has slumped 41 percent in New York trading
this year amid management turmoil and disappointing earnings.
Investor Audley Capital Advisors LLP said in July the southern
Appalachia producer of steelmaking coal should explore a sale
following Chief Executive Officer Keith Calder’s resignation
after three months on the job.  Anglo may be considering a bid at $120 a share, the Times
said in its daily market report, without saying where it got the
information. The London-based miner could increase an offer to
$150 if needed, the newspaper said, adding that  BHP Billiton
Ltd. (BHP)  may also be interested in Walter.  Anglo declined to comment in an e-mail today. Kelly Quirke,
a spokeswoman for Melbourne-based BHP, also declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
