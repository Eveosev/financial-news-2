The Slovak government approved
strengthening powers of  Europe ’s bailout mechanism aimed at
stopping the region’s debt crisis from spreading.  The measures to boost powers of the European Financial
Stability Facility, a temporary bailout fund, were agreed on at
a summit of European leaders on July 21. The Slovak Cabinet
today backed the resolution of the summit, which includes a
possibility of to provide credit lines for distressed countries
and buy their bonds on the secondary market, according to the
government’s website.  The agreement still requires approval from the Slovak
parliament. SaS, one of the four coalition parties, has said it
won’t vote for the package. The administration of Premier Iveta Radicova will need to seek support from the opposition to push
through the measures, which must be ratified by all countries.  Smer, the largest opposition party headed by Radicova’s
predecessor  Robert Fico , has said it will vote for the change
only if all ruling parties pledge to support it.  To contact the reporter on this story:
