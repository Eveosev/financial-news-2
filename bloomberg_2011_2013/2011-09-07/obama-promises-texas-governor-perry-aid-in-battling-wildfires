President  Barack Obama  called Texas
Governor Rick Perry today and told him the federal government
will assist state and local emergency officials dealing with
wildfires sweeping the state, the White House said.  The men spoke hours before Perry was to make his debut
Republican presidential debate appearance in Simi Valley,
California, along with seven other contenders seeking the
nomination to challenge Obama in the 2012 general election.
Perry missed a candidate forum on Sept. 5 in South Carolina to
get back to Texas to deal with the wildfires that have scorched
thousands of acres in central Texas.  Obama offered condolences for Texans who died in the fires,
according to an administration statement. After the call, Obama
directed his national security staff to work with the  Federal
Emergency Management Agency , Forest Service and state officials
“to ensure we were making all resources available,” the
statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
