Gulf Keystone Petroleum Ltd. (GKP)  and  DNO
International ASA (DNO) , owners of oil and gas fields in Iraq, rose
after Vallares Plc announced a $2.1 billion deal to buy a
company for its fields in the Kurdistan region.  Gulf Keystone advanced 4.1 percent to 135 pence as of the
4:30 p.m. London close.  Heritage Oil Plc (HOIL)  rose 6.8 percent to 221
pence.  Afren Plc (AFR) , which said it will invest $1 billion in
Kurdistan in the next five years, gained 5.8 percent. Oslo-
listed DNO, the first foreign company to pump oil in Iraq since
the 1970s, climbed 8.3 percent.  “The deal is good for sentiment in the region,” said Doug Youngson, an analyst at Arbuthnot Securities Ltd. in London.  Vallares, led by former  BP Plc (BP/)  Chief Executive Officer  Tony Hayward , said today it will buy Genel Energy International Ltd.
in an all-share reverse takeover. Genel has proved and probable
reserves of 356 million barrels, a figure Hayward said would
rise quickly given the exploration potential of licenses held by
Genel. The cost of finding and developing the oil is low
compared with other regions of the world at between $2 and $4 a
barrel, he said.  “The Kurdistan region of Iraq is undoubtedly one of the
last great oil and gas frontiers,” Hayward said in a statement.
“Arguably, it is the last big onshore ‘easy’ oil province
available for exploration by private companies anywhere in the
world.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
