Chile ’s peso rose for the first time
in four days as commodities including copper, the country’s
biggest export, gained.  The peso strengthened 0.2 percent to 463.09 per  U.S. dollar 
from 463.9 yesterday. The peso lost 1 percent in the previous
three days.  Copper, which made up 52 percent of Chile’s exports last
month, gained on concern that strikes in Peru and  Indonesia  may
lead to shortages and on speculation that low interest rates
will boost global demand for raw materials.  “There are gains in commodities, a better atmosphere in
global stocks, and commodity currencies have gained,” said
Cristian Donoso, a currency trader at the brokerage unit at
Banco de Chile. “In that context the Chilean peso is trading
around 462 per dollar.”  Dollar selling by local institutional investors had slowed
the peso’s decline in the recent days, Donoso said.  Copper for December delivery climbed 1.9 percent to $4.1325
a pound as of 12:53 p.m. New York time.  The central bank bought $50 million at 462.18 per dollar
today as part of a $12 billion effort to limit the peso’s gains,
according to data published on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
