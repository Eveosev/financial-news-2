Pirate attacks on ships off  East
Africa  and in the  Indian Ocean  may increase in the next few
weeks as the monsoon season ends, according to AKE Group Ltd.  The season finishes this month, reducing the difficulty for
pirates of traveling to open waters and attacking vessels, Rory
Lamrock, a maritime analyst at the Hereford, England-based
security and risk assessment provider, said in an e-mailed
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
