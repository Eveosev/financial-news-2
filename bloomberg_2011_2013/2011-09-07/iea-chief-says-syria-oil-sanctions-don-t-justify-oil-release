A drop in Syrian oil exports as
sanctions clamp down on President Bashar al-Assad wouldn’t
justify another release of emergency stockpiles by International
Energy Agency members, according to the agency’s new head.  “ Syria ’s exports aren’t quite as large as some people
think,” Maria van der Hoeven, the 61-year old executive
director of the Paris-based IEA, said in an interview yesterday.
 Europe ’s decision to ban imports of Syrian crude “was a very
important political signal.”  Van der Hoeven, former Dutch minister of economic affairs,
began her four-year term as IEA chief on Sept. 1, succeeding
 Nobuo Tanaka  of Japan.  Syria will seek alternative buyers after the European Union
banned its member states from buying the Middle Eastern state’s
crude, Finance Minister Mohammad Al-Jleilati said.  The E.U. sanctions “shouldn’t be a problem” for the
country, Al-Jleilati said in an interview in  Abu Dhabi  today.
Syria hasn’t decided where to sell its crude, adding that
Russia, China and  Malaysia  are allies, Al-Jleilati said.  Sytrol, the country’s state-run oil company, will raise
daily exports of Souedie crude for loading in September by 30
percent, a shipping schedule obtained by Bloomberg News showed.
The program for Souedie, also known as Syrian Heavy, comprises
11 cargoes totaling 703,000 metric tons from the Mediterranean
port of Tartous. That’s equivalent to 162,159 barrels a day,
compared with 125,006 barrels a day in August.  To contact the reporters on this story:
