Bancolombia SA (BCOLO) , the nation’s largest
bank, said its President Carlos Raul Yepes is in “stable”
condition after intestinal surgery.  Yepes is recovering from a scheduled surgery in Medellin on
Aug. 31 followed by a second intervention on Sept. 5, according
to a bank spokesperson who can’t be identified because of
corporate policy. Bogota-based Radio Caracol said today Yepes is
in “delicate” health after surgery, without saying where it
obtained the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
