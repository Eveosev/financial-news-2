King Creosote  is playing in London.
It’s time to find out what all the fuss is about.  Kenny Anderson, a Scottish singer-songwriter, built up a
following as he released more than 40 CDs to mild praise. Under
the Creosote stage name, he joined with English musician Jon
Hopkins to make “Diamond Mine,” an album that was nominated in
July for the Barclaycard Mercury Prize and has now sold more
than 12,000 copies.  The duo’s hypnotic mix of folk and ambient music is
seductive on songs like “Bubble” and “Running on Fumes.”  Queen Elizabeth Hall, Southbank Centre, Belvedere Road,
SE1 8XX. Information:  http://www.southbankcentre.co.uk  or
+44-20-7960-4200.  Canteen is an informal all-day restaurant near Queen
Elizabeth Hall, serving British favorites such as sausage and
mash with onion gravy, and strawberry-and-almond trifle. It’s
unpretentious, inexpensive and also offers a range of ales.  Information: +44-845-686-1122 or  http://bit.ly/2fiywq   Saturday  It’s your last chance to catch a summer musical at Regent’s
Park Open Air Theatre. The outdoor arena is winding up its run
with George and Ira Gershwin’s “Crazy for You.”  The fun show, about a U.S. banker who loves Broadway, is
given bright direction by Timothy Sheader. Veteran Sean Palmer
leads an all-singing, all-dancing cast.  “Crazy for You” is at Regent’s Park Open Air Theatre,
Inner Circle, Westminster, NW1 4NS. The run ends on Saturday,
with performances at 2:15 p.m. and 7:45 p.m. Information:
 http://www.openairtheatre.org  or +44-844-826-4242.  Saturday Night  Let’s hope  Lang Lang  has a swift pair of running shoes.  The piano prodigy will become the first artist to perform
in both Hyde Park and the Royal Albert Hall for the last night
of the Proms. He’ll play Liszt’s Hungarian Rhapsody in A Minor
in the park, then sprint over to the hall to perform the
composer’s Piano Concerto No. 1 in E flat major.  Also on the program: Elgar’s “Land of Hope and Glory,”
the national anthem, and lots of jubilant flag waving.  Information:  http://www.bbc.co.uk/proms  or
+44-845-401-5040.  Sunday  Uniformed East German guards peer out from behind barbed
wire and a section of the  Berlin Wall .  The 1961 photograph by Don McCullin, taken at the height of
the  Cold War , is a stark reminder of the terrifying standoff
that long held the world on the verge of nuclear meltdown. It’s
part of a new display at Tate Britain.  Other highlights in the show, which is supported by  BP Plc (BP/) ,
are the hungry faces of the homeless in London’s now-fashionable
East End, and McCullin’s fine Somerset landscapes.  The display leaves you wanting more. The good news is, it’s
free, and runs through March 4, 2012.  Information:  http://www.tate.org.uk  or +44-20-7887-8888.  Tate Britain’s Rex Whistler restaurant has beautiful murals
and a wine list that’s among the best in the U.K. In fine
weather, al fresco dining here is a joy. The set lunch is 20.50
pounds ($32.80) for three courses. It’s worth having a meal
rather than just grabbing a snack in the cafeteria. Information:
