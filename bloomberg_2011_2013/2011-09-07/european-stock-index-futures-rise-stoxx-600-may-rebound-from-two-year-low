European stocks rose the most in
three weeks, rebounding from a two-year low, after three days of
losses dragged the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index near to the cheapest
since 2008.  Greek stocks gained as Germany’s top court rejected
challenges to the participation of Europe’s largest economy in
euro rescue funds. Cie. Financiere Richemont SA, owner of the
Cartier watch brand, climbed 7.3 percent after revenue topped
analyst estimates.  Scor SE (SCR) , France’s largest reinsurer,
increased 2.5 percent after confirming targets.  Renault SA (RNO)  led a
rally in automakers.  The Stoxx 600 rose 3.1 percent to 228.84 at the 4:30 p.m.
close in  London  as all 19 industry groups advanced, the largest
gain since Aug. 12. The gauge has still tumbled 21 percent from
this year’s high in February as concern grew that Europe’s debt
crisis is harming the economy. The decline cut the index’s
valuation to 10.4 times reported earnings, near the cheapest
since December 2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Valuations are attractive in the short term,” said
Guillaume Duchesne, an equity strategist at BGL BNP Paribas SA
in Luxembourg. “Some stocks have been massacred so there are
good entry points. Still, volatility remains significant and
it’s best to be cautious. Today looks like a technical
rebound.”  National benchmark indexes gained in all 18 western
European markets, except Iceland.  Germany ’s DAX advanced 4.1
percent and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 increased 3.1 percent, the
biggest jumps since May 2010. France’s CAC 40 rose 3.6 percent.  Fed, Obama  The  Federal Reserve  was due to release its Beige Book
survey of the U.S. economic conditions after the close of
European trading today. President Barack Obama will address
Congress tomorrow on his plan to boost job growth.  Obama plans to propose sparking job growth by injecting
more than $300 billion into the economy next year, mostly
through tax cuts, infrastructure spending and direct aid to
state and local governments. The main components of the jobs
plan, though not its scale, have been largely telegraphed by the
administration. For weeks, people familiar with deliberations
have said the White House is considering tax incentives,
infrastructure and assistance to local governments.  “We’re seeing a nice little relief rally,” said Justin Urquhart Stewart, who helps oversee about $3.3 billion at 7
Investment Management in London. “The market is being driven by
political sentiment. It’s going to be very volatile.”  Greek Banks Gain  Greek banks rallied, led by  National Bank of Greece SA (ETE) , the
country’s largest, which gained 23 percent to 3.41 euros.  EFG
Eurobank Ergasias SA (EUROB)  soared 15 percent to 1.33 euros and  Piraeus
Bank SA (TPEIR)  jumped 15 percent to 62 euro cents.  The Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe threw out
suits targeting Germany’s share of the 110 billion euros ($155
billion) in loans for Greece from euro-region governments and
the  International Monetary Fund  as well as a separate 750
billion-euro rescue fund approved last year to halt the spread
of Greece’s debt crisis.  Richemont jumped 7.3 percent to 47.05 Swiss francs after
the world’s second-biggest luxury-goods company reported sales
that beat analysts’ estimates as Asian consumers bought more
Vacheron Constantin timepieces and Cartier jewelry.  Revenue rose 29 percent in the five months through August
from the year-earlier period, the Geneva-based company said.
That beat the 18 percent average estimate of 15 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Confirmed Targets  Scor advanced 2.5 percent to 16.03 euros. The company
confirmed the targets in its strategic plan, saying gross
written premiums should rise to 10 billion euros in 2013.  Renault, France’s second-biggest carmaker, climbed 7.4
percent to 25.78 euros, the largest increase in 11 months.

Motoren Werke AG jumped 6 percent to 53.71 euros. A gauge of
auto stocks in the Stoxx 600 rallied 6.1 percent for the biggest
gain since May 2010.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s biggest mining company,

advanced 4.2 percent to 3,697 pence. Copper, lead and nickel

countries in Europe and  North America , soared 7.9 percent to
10.39 euros. The company will cut administration costs and
overheads, including discontinuing business segments where
target operating margins no longer appear likely to be attained
in the medium term, to boost operating income.  Temenos Gains  Temenos Group AG (TEMN) , the Swiss maker of banking software,
surged 11 percent to 17.25 francs. Morgan Stanley analysts held
a dinner with Chief Executive Officer Guy Dubois and wrote in a
report that they were “impressed” with his industry experience
and that the “pipeline remains solid and underpins guidance.”  Aegon NV (AGN) , the Dutch owner of Scottish Equitable, jumped 7.2
percent to 2.96 euros. The stock was raised to “buy” from
“accumulate” at KBC Group NV.  Kingfisher Plc (KGF)  gained 4.7 percent to 236.1 pence as Nomura

improvement retailer to “buy” from “neutral.”  Waertsilae Oyj, the Finnish maker of ship engines and power
