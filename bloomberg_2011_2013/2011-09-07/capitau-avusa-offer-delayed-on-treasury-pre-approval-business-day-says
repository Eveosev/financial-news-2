Capitau Holdings Ltd.’s offer for
 Avusa Ltd. (AVU) , publisher of  South Africa ’s largest weekend
broadsheet newspaper, will be delayed until it receives pre-
approval from South Africa’s Treasury on funding for the deal,
Business Day said, without saying how it got the information.  The Capitau-led consortium was given until today to make a
firm offer for Avusa, following completion of a due diligence
investigation on Aug. 24, the Johannesburg-based newspaper
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
