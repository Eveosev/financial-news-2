The euro, which dropped for six
straight days against the dollar before today, is oversold and
poised for a bounce, according to Bank of America Corp.  The 10-day relative strength index for the 17-nation
currency indicates that it has dropped too quickly and may be
poised to resume its bull trend against the dollar, said  MacNeil
Curry , head of foreign exchange and interest rates technical
strategy at Bank of America in New York.  “We have reached levels from the perspective of momentum
which have coincided with the lows made back on July 12,” Curry
said in a telephone interview. “There’s no indication that this
bull trend is about to break.”  The 10-day relative strength index for the euro versus the
dollar reached 21.4 yesterday, the lowest since Nov. 30, before
trading at 35.9 today. Readings below 30 indicate a currency’s
decline may have gone too quickly and may be due for a reversal.  The RSI last traded under 30 on July 12 and the euro
rallied 2 percent in the following month.  The shared currency rose 0.5 percent to $1.4070 at 11:31
a.m. in  New York , from $1.3998 yesterday. The euro has
strengthened 5.1 percent this year.  While the euro has remained in a range of $1.3837 to
$1.4578 since the beginning of July, the currency is still
within its larger bull trend, started last year, Curry said. The
euro is poised to rise to $1.52 in the medium term, unless it
breaks below $1.3863, he said.  To contact the reporter for this story:
