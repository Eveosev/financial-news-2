Danish lawmakers approved a bank
rescue package that allows the country’s lenders to sidestep the
European Union’s toughest resolution laws by spurring
consolidation.  Denmark ’s parliamentary finance committee today signed the
bill first presented by Economy Minister Brian Mikkelsen on Aug.
25, according to an e-mail from his ministry in Copenhagen.  Lawmakers had come under pressure to amend existing rules
after the failure of two regional lenders this year triggered
the EU’s first senior creditor losses within a resolution
framework.  Standard & Poor’s  said Aug. 26 the new package will
reduce the risk of more failures while Moody’s Investors Service
said four days later the measures were credit positive.  Under the proposal, the state’s winding-up unit Financial
Stability will take over bad loans from ailing lenders if
another bank wants to buy the healthy parts. Costs would be
carried by the banking industry.  Denmark’s banks need to refinance about $35 billion in
state-guaranteed debt in the next two years. Under the new plan,
a bank would get its guarantee extended in the event of a
takeover. The state will also identify too-big-to-fail banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
