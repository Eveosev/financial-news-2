The U.S. Transportation Security
Administration said it bought 300 body scanners that show less-
revealing images to airport screeners after travelers and
airline crews objected to so-called nude images.  The $44.8 million purchase from  L-3 Communications Holdings
Inc. (LLL) , which uses millimeter-wave technology, brings the number
of advanced imaging technology body scanners at airport
checkpoints to 800, the agency said today in a statement. Each
machine costs $130,000 to $170,000, said Greg Soule, a TSA
spokesman.  Software that makes passengers appear as generic outlines
is being used to upgrade the L-3 machines that are already in
airports, Soule said. Airline pilots are among those who have
protested the “nude” images generated by scanners.  The move to use less-graphic images is “a recognition that
we could do better,” TSA Administrator  John Pistole  said today
in  Washington  at a conference hosted by the Intelligence and
National Security Alliance and Center for Strategic and
International Studies.  TSA soon will begin testing software to make  OSI Systems
Inc. (OSIS) ’s Rapiscan passenger-screening equipment show less-
revealing images, Soule said. Those machines, which account for
about half of TSA’s body scanners, use backscatter technology to
see under a passenger’s clothes.  Millimeter wave scanners use radio-frequency energy, while
backscatter scanners use low-intensity X-ray beams.  To contact the reporter on this story:
