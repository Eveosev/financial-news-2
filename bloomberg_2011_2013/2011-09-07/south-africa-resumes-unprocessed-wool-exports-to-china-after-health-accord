South Africa  will resume shipments
of unprocessed wool to  China  for the first time in more than a
year after an agreement was reached on clearance certificates
related to Rift Valley Fever.  Wool shorn three months after the last outbreak of the
disease will be eligible for export from Sept. 15 following an
accord between South Africa’s Department of Agriculture,
Forestry and Fisheries and China’s General Administration of
Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine, industry body
 Cape Wools  said today in an e-mailed statement.  Raw-wool exports to China, the largest importer of South
African wool before Rift Valley Fever struck livestock, were
halted in August last year following the first outbreak of the
virus in South Africa since the 1970s.  The last incidence of the fever was reported in May, Ona Viljoen, a spokeswoman for Cape Wools, said by telephone from
 Port Elizabeth , South Africa’s main wool export harbor. Steve
Galane, a spokesman for the agriculture department, didn’t
immediately respond to a message left on his mobile phone.  “Thankfully, demand was very strong from  Europe  during the
last marketing season and that made up for the shortfall from
China,” Viljoen said. “We saw no stocks building up.” In the
2009/2010 marketing season, which ran from mid-August to mid-
June, sales to China totaled 933 million rand ($130 million),
according to Cape Wools.  To contact the reporter on this story
