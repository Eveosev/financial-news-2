Mozambiqueâ€™s Tax Authority collected
53 billion meticais in the first eight months of 2011, up 84
percent from the same period a year earlier,
independent daily O Pais reported, citing Rosario Fernandes,
chairman of the state run Tax Authority.  The Tax Authority plans to increase receipts by opening
more collections centers throughout the Southern African
country, the Maputo-based daily cited Fernandes as saying.   To contact the reporter on this story:
