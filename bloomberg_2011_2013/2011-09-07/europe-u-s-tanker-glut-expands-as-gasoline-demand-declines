A surplus of available tankers for
shipping gasoline to the U.S. from northwestern  Europe  expanded
for the third straight week, as demand for the auto fuel
collapsed, a survey showed.  Thirty-three ships, the most since July 6, were yet to be
assigned cargoes and available for hire until Sept. 21,
according to the median in a Bloomberg News survey of four
shipbrokers, one ship owner and two traders today. Ten vessels
are hired to load gasoline, with another 10 bookings yet to
come, the data show.  “U.S. product imports have fallen dramatically, down 29
percent in the third-quarter 2011 compared to third-quarter
2010,” Martin Korsvold, an analyst at Pareto Securities AS in
Oslo, wrote in an e-mail. “The driving season is over and U.S.
gasoline demand is 2 to 3 percent weaker than the same period
last year.”  U.S. gasoline demand tends to peak during summer’s so-
called driving season, extending from Memorial Day weekend at
the end of May to Labor Day in the first week of September.  Charterers will hire 20 medium-range tankers to transport
6.29 million barrels of gasoline across the Atlantic Ocean over
the next two weeks, according to the survey’s median estimate.
That’s three more total bookings than last week, when nine
bookings were made and eight more were expected. The 449,000
barrels-a-day rate is 53 percent of the 853,000 barrels the U.S.
imported last year, according to the Energy Department.  Daily rental income for tankers carrying gasoline across
the Atlantic Ocean fell 1.8 percent to $2,632, according to the
 Baltic Exchange  in London today. That’s the 11th straight day of
declines, and the lowest level since Nov. 10, 2010.  Ship Fuel  The price of ship fuel, or bunkers, declined 0.8 percent to
$649.60 a metric ton, data compiled by Bloomberg from 25 ports
worldwide showed. That’s up 28 percent from Jan. 3.  The survey is based on so-called single-voyage, or spot,
charters and excludes loadings under longer-term contracts. It
assumes shipments to the U.S. East Coast from northwestern
Europe. Each tanker would normally haul about 37,000 tons of
cargo, or 315,000 barrels.  Charter rates on the route fell 1.1 percent to 128.13
Worldscale points, according to the exchange. That’s a decline
of 3.3 percent from Jan. 4. The points are a percentage of a
nominal rate, or flat rate, for more than 320,000 specific
routes. Flat rates for every voyage, quoted in U.S. dollars a
ton, are revised annually by the Worldscale Association in
 London  to reflect changing fuel costs, port tariffs and exchange
rates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
