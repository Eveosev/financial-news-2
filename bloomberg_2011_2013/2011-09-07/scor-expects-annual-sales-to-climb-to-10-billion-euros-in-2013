Scor SE (SCR) ,  France ’s largest reinsurer,
expects annual sales of 10 billion euros ($14 billion) in 2013
after it acquired the mortality risk reinsurance business of
Aegon NV’s Transamerica unit this year.  Scor’s gross written premiums should rise by 14 percent a
year from 2010 to 2013, the Paris-based company said in a
statement today. The reinsurer also confirmed it aims for a
life-reinsurance operating margin of 7.5 percent in the period
“in spite of an evolving economic environment.”  Scor last month completed the $912.5 million acquisition of
Transamerica in a move that allowed Chief Executive Officer
Denis Kessler to expand its U.S. life-reinsurance business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
