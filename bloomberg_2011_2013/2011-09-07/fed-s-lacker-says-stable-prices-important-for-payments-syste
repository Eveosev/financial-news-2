Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond
President  Jeffrey Lacker  said central banks can help improve the
payments system by maintaining stable prices.  “Perhaps the most important thing a central bank can do to
promote efficient payments innovation is to provide an
environment of stable prices, so that the payments system
decision makers -- like other economic decision makers -- can
better judge the true costs and benefits of alternative
choices,” Lacker said today in remarks at a Chicago Fed
conference, posted on the Richmond Fed’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
