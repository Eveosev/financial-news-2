Greece  opened bidding for companies
to explore four areas for geothermal energy as it seeks to
become an exporter of renewable power.  Research and investigation will require about 100 million
euros ($141 million) of initial investment, according to an e-
mailed statement today from the Ministry for Environment, Energy
and Climate Change. The geothermal plants could cost at least 50
million euros per unit, it said.  Energy Minister  George Papaconstantinou  said in Hamburg
this week that there is a need for exports of renewable energy
from southern Europe given Germany’s vow to abandon atomic power
and the political turmoil in the  Middle East . Greece announced
bids it received in another geothermal power exploration tender
in March.  “In these difficult economic times investments in green
energy are a basic pillar for national economic growth and the
country’s exit from the crisis,”  Papaconstantinou said today
in the statement.  The four areas to be researched for geothermal potential
are Kavala, the Spercheios basin, Sousaki and Ikaria Island,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
