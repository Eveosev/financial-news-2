RWE AG (RWE)  and EON AG are preparing to
sell their holdings in U.K. nuclear power company Urenco Group,
 Handelsblatt  said, citing a person familiar with both companies.  Urenco is also part-owned by the U.K. and Dutch
governments, which must approve the sale. Britain has also
considered selling its holding, while the Dutch government wants
to retain its stake and may try to stop the transaction, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
