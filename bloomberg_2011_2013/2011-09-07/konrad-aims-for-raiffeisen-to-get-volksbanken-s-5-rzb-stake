Raiffeisen Zentralbank Oesterreich
AG Chairman Christian Konrad said he wants  Oesterreichische
Volksbanken AG (VBPS) ’s 5 percent stake in RZB to go to Raiffeisen
banks.  “I will make an effort to find a way that these 5 percent
stay in the country with us,” Konrad told reporters in Vienna
late yesterday.  RZB, the central institution of  Austria ’s Raiffeisen
banking group and the majority shareholder of listed  Raiffeisen
Bank International AG (RBI) , is 88 percent owned by regional
Raiffeisen banks. Volksbanken holds a 5 percent stake in RZB and
is seeking a buyer as part of its efforts to ramp up capital,
having failed this year’s European bank stress test and faced
with potential nationalization after announcing it may not pay
interest on 1 billion euros ($1.4 billion) of government aid for
the third consecutive year.  The regional banks, led by Raiffeisenlandesbank
Niederoesterreich-Wien AG, aren’t likely to reach an agreement
this year after they didn’t exercise their right to buy the
stake, Volksbanken Chief Executive Officer Gerald Wenzel said
last month.  “This is a process and we still are in the middle of it,”
Konrad said. “There definitely hasn’t been a decision yet.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
