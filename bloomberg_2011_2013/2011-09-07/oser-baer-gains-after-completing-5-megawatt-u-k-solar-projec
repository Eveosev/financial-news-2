Moser Baer Ltd., Indiaâ€™s second-
largest maker of solar cells, was headed for its highest in
almost two weeks after saying it completed a 5-megawatt solar
power plant in the U.K.  The New Delhi-based company and its German partner,  Hep
Capital AG , expect the photovoltaic plant in Trefullock,  England 
to generate about 5 million kilowatt-hours a year, Moser Baer
said in an e-mailed statement.  The shares surged as much as 8.6 percent in Mumbai trading
and were up 7 percent at 23.65 rupees as of 2:02 p.m. local
time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
