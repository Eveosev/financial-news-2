TrueCar Inc. , a U.S. provider of
automotive prices, raised $200 million to fund purchases of
other data companies and expand its vehicle sales-related
business, the company’s chief executive said.  TrueCar, based in  Santa Monica ,  California , last month
bought ALG, or Automotive Lease Guide, the main provider of
residual values to automakers. TrueCar also said in a statement
it acquired Carperks LLP, a Jacksonville, Florida-based operator
of vehicle-buying programs for employees of companies including
Coca-Cola Co. and Wells Fargo & Co.  “Over the next year, we’re going to buy a number of other
companies in our categories,” Scott Painter, TrueCar’s founder
and chief executive officer, said in a phone interview. He
declined to identify companies he plans to acquire or say how
much TrueCar paid for ALG or Carperks.  DealerTrak Holdings Inc., a provider of software and data
services for  car dealerships , is participating in the $200
million private placement, Painter said. DealerTrak sold ALG to
TrueCar. It also took a 15 percent stake in privately held
TrueCar as part of the agreement.  TrueCar is arranging for existing investors to exchange
preferred shares for common stock and new investors to buy
common shares. Participating investors include USAA Capital
Corp., Capricorn Investment Group LLC and GRP Partners.  TrueCar has no immediate plans for an initial public
offering of shares, Painter said.  “There’s no particular urgency on our part to do so,”
said Painter, who also founded online car-buying service
 Carsdirect.com  in 1998. “The motivation would be more about
creating brand awareness.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
