Two  suicide bombers  attacked a top
paramilitary official’s residence in  Pakistan ’s city of Quetta,
killing at least 15 people and injuring 40 others, police said.  Bombers targeted Brigadier Farrukh Shehzad’s residence,
Baluchistan police spokesman Shahzada Farhad said in a phone
interview. The attack follows the Sept. 5 announcement by
Pakistan’s army that it had arrested al-Qaeda’s leader for
international operations, Younis Al-Mauritani, in the city,
which is close to the Afghanistan border.  The brigadier’s wife was among those killed, as well as a
colonel in the Frontier Corps, a paramilitary force, Farhad said.  Pakistan’s Taliban movement and allied militant groups have
carried out scores of attacks on police, army and intelligence
facilities in big cities. Twin bombings at a paramilitary police
training center in northwest Pakistan killed 73 people on May 13
in what the Pakistan Taliban said was revenge for the death of
 Osama bin Laden  in a raid by U.S. Navy SEALs at a house in the
town of Abbottabad.  Pakistan’s  Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate  captured
al-Mauritani and al-Qaeda operatives Abdul Ghaffar al-Shami and
Messara al-Shami in Quetta with the help of the U.S.  To contact the reporters on this story:
