Mauritius’s annual inflation rate
fell to the lowest in seven months in August as a strengthening
of the rupee against the dollar helped curb import costs, adding
to expectations interest rates will be kept unchanged next week.  Inflation slowed to 6.5 percent from 6.7 percent a month
earlier, the Port Louis-based Central Statistics Office said in
a  statement  published on its website today. Prices rose 0.2
percent in the month, it said.  “There is a stability in July to August, which might be
attributed to our currency,” Eric Ng, director of economic
advisory company PluriConseil Ltd., said by phone.  Inflation in the Indian Ocean island nation has slowed from
an almost two-year high of 7.2 percent in March with the rupee
strengthening 8.5 percent against the dollar this year. The
currency gained 0.6 percent in August. A lower inflation rate
may add to expectations the central bank will keep its benchmark
 interest rate  unchanged on Sept. 12 after increasing the lending
rate at the last two meetings.  “Leaving the rate unchanged will be a good compromise,”
Ng said. While the inflation rate is still high, economic growth
will probably be curbed by weaker demand from  Europe ,
Mauritius’s main trading partner, he said.  The rupee weakened 0.3 percent to 28.25 per dollar by 12:15
p.m in  Port Louis .  The average inflation rate for the 12 months through August
rose to 5.8 percent from 5.5 percent a month earlier, the
statistics agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
