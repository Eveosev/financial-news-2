Turkey  is working on new regulations
that would ban brand names, logos and designs on cigarette
packaging and replace them with numbered black boxes,  Milliyet 
reported, without saying where it got the information.  The regulations would ban any imagery or text other than
health warnings and aims to reduce cigarette usage, the
Istanbul-based newspaper said. Smokers would be required to
order cigarettes by number, it said.  Health Minister Recep Akdag has asked officials from the
 World Health Organization  and Turkeyâ€™s Tobacco and Alcohol
Markets Regulation Board, or TAPDK, to coordinate on beginning
technical studies toward implementing the new regulations,
Milliyet said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
