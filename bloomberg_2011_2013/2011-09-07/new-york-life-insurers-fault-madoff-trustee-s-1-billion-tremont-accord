New York Life Insurance Co. and six
other insurance companies assailed the trustee liquidating
 Bernard Madoff ’s firm and his $1 billion settlement with hedge-
fund firm Tremont Group Holdings Inc., saying it didn’t treat
all the Tremont funds equally.  As limited partners of Tremont’s Opportunity III fund, they
said they stand to lose if a court rules that the trustee erred
in denying compensation to the Ponzi scheme’s so-called net
winners, according to a court filing yesterday.  A group of Madoff’s investors last week asked a U.S.
appeals court to review its Aug. 16 ruling that bars them from
calculating losses based on their account statements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
