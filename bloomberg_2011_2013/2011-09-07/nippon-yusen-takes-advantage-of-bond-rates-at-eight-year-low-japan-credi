Nippon Yusen  K.K. is taking
advantage of falling government note yields and a void in
corporate debt sales to borrow at the lowest rate in eight years
even as global trade growth slows.  The second-largest listed shipping line by sales plans to
issue 25 billion yen ($325 million) of bonds maturing in 2021
with a 1.218 percent coupon, the carrier’s lowest for a 10-year
security since February 2003, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S, the biggest shipping line,
issued seven-year debt in November with a 4.375 percent coupon.  Demand for corporate debt issues is rising as electric
companies retired 905 billion yen more in bonds than they issued
since the March 11 quake and nuclear crisis.  Japan ’s benchmark
10-year bond yield fell to the lowest this year in August,
reducing rates for corporate issuers such as Nippon Yusen as
investors fled to the safety of fixed-income securities as
equity markets plummeted.  “It’s good timing,” said Toshiyasu Ohashi, head of credit
research at Daiwa Securities Capital Markets Co. “Companies can
get very low rates by issuing bonds now. There’s a worldwide
slowdown in growth and a lack of sales by electricity companies
is making for very good supply conditions.”  Nippon Yusen’s debt has gained this year, pushing the yield
on the 1.782 percent bonds due in August 2019 down to 0.865
percent, the lowest since Oct. 12. The yield has fallen from
this year’s high of 1.37 percent on Feb. 16.  Bonds Rally  The decline in yields for the shipping line, rated Baa1 by
Moody’s Investors Service, has tracked a rally in  government
bonds . The yield on Japan’s 10-year sovereign debt fell to 0.97
percent on Aug. 19, the lowest since November, and lost 3 basis
points to 0.985 percent in  Tokyo  yesterday.  Sales of corporate bonds in the three months through June
30 fell 35 percent to 1.82 trillion yen from a year earlier,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Japanese companies
issued 5.33 trillion yen in bonds this year, that’s the lowest
amount since 2006. The power companies’ amount of net retired
debt is equivalent to 17 percent of corporate issuances this
year, according to Bloomberg calculations.  Nippon Yusen will issue 55 billion yen of debt, including
five-, 10- and 20-year securities, on Sept. 9, according to the
company. It has 305 billion yen of bonds outstanding, including
55 billion yen in convertibles and the new bonds being issued
this month, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Profit to Plunge  The company is raising money to help repay the convertible
bonds and to take advantage of low rates, according to a
spokesman for the Tokyo-based shipping line.  Nippon Yusen slashed its annual profit forecasts in July as
falling rates for transporting containers and commodities drove
down sales. The company expects net income to tumble to 5
billion yen for the year ending March 31, compared with 78.5
billion yen a year earlier.  U.S. payrolls were unchanged last month, the weakest
reading since September 2010, while the  International Monetary
Fund  on Aug. 29 cut its economic growth outlook for the world’s
largest economy to 1.6 percent from 2.5 percent this year.  Japan’s government bonds rallied in August, dragging yields
down for a fifth straight month. The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average
tumbled 8.9 percent in August. The Nikkei rose 1.4 percent
today, coming off the lowest close since April 2009 yesterday.  The worsening outlook for shipping rates helped push Nippon
Yusen’s shares down to 218 yen yesterday, the lowest level since
1984. The stock has dropped 39.4 percent this year.  Holders of the company’s convertible bonds asked for them
to be redeemed, in line with a  put option  on the securities,
after the shares tumbled.  The company had 149 billion yen in cash and equivalents as
of June 30, compared with 58 billion yen at Mitsui O.S.K. Lines
Ltd., Japan’s second-largest shipping line by sales.  Spreads Narrow  The premium investors demand to own Nippon Yusen’s 1.782
percent bonds maturing in August 2019 over similar-maturity
government debt shrunk to 19 basis points on Sept. 5, from a
peak this year of 24 basis points on June 6, according to Japan
Securities Dealers Association prices on Bloomberg.  Contracts to insure Nippon Yusen’s debt against default for
five years, known as credit default swaps, climbed to 105 basis
points yesterday from 97 at the end of August. Derivative prices
are down from this year’s peak of 119 basis points on Aug. 24,
according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. The cost to
protect Mitsui O.S.K. debt yesterday was 110 basis points and
110.8 for Japanese government debt.  Credit-default swap contracts pay the buyer face value in
exchange for the underlying securities if a borrower fails to
meet its debt agreements.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index of credit-default swaps fell
4 basis points to 151 today, according to the latest CMA prices.
The risk gauge advanced from 98 a day before the earthquake, the
data show.  The yen reached a post-World War II high of 75.95 versus
the dollar in New York trading on Aug. 19, spurring speculation
the  Bank of Japan  will move to weaken the currency. The yen
traded at 77.42 per dollar in Tokyo today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
