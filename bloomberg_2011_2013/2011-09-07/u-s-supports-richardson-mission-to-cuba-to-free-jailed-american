The Obama administration said it
supports former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson’s trip to
Cuba to try to secure the release of a jailed U.S. contractor.  “We are aware of Governor Richardson’s trip to Cuba and
have been in contact with him,” State Department spokeswoman
 Victoria Nuland  said in a statement today. “While Governor
Richardson is traveling as private citizen, we certainly support
his efforts to obtain Alan Gross’s release.”  Richardson is a former U.S. ambassador to the  United
Nations .  Cuban state media reported last month that the communist
island’s highest court had upheld a 15-year prison sentence for
Gross, who was accused of trying to establish illegal Internet
connections that the government said were aimed at promoting
dissent and democracy.  Former President Jimmy Carter visited Cuba earlier this
year and was unsuccessful in securing Gross’s release.  Gross, 62, a subcontractor for the U.S. Agency for
International Development who has been jailed since December
2009, has said he was trying to assist the Jewish community with
 Internet access .  U.S.-Cuban relations, which had shown signs of improvement
with talks on such issues as postal links and migration at the
start of President Barack Obama’s term, have been frozen since
Gross was detained.  To contact the reporter on this story:
