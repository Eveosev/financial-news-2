Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in  Vietnam  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the 11 a.m. local-time close.  The VN Index, the benchmark measure of the Ho Chi Minh City
Stock Exchange, gained 1.8 percent to 443.99, the highest level
since June 16. The gauge climbed for a ninth day, the longest
winning streak since 2009.  Rubber stocks: Saovang Rubber Joint-Stock Co. (SRC VN) rose
4.7 percent to 13,400 dong. Danang Rubber Joint-Stock Co. (DRC
VN) rose 3.7 percent to 22,300 dong. Phuoc Hoa Rubber Joint-
Stock Co. (PHR VN), the country’s biggest listed rubber company,
increased 1 percent to 30,600 dong.  Rubber advanced by the most in a week as a weaker Japanese
currency boosted the appeal of assets denominated in the yen and
a rally in Asian stocks eased concern that an economic slowdown
may curb demand.  Phu Nhuan Jewelry Joint-Stock Co. (PNJ VN), Vietnam’s only
listed jewelry manufacturer, jumped 4.9 percent to 34,000 dong,
the highest since Feb. 23. Gold may rebound after falling the
most in a week yesterday as investors sought to protect their
wealth against declining currencies and economic turmoil.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
