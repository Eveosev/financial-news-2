U.S. policy makers should put the
health of the banking system ahead of recovering losses in
demanding that lenders repurchase faulty mortgages, according to
analysts Paul Miller, of FBR Capital Markets & Co.  “They need to tell FHFA to back off on this,” Miller said
today in an interview on Bloomberg Radio, referring to the
 Federal Housing Finance Agency ’s suit against 17 banks to
recover losses on mortgage-based securities sold to  Fannie Mae 
and Freddie Mac. The FHFA is seeking to recoup losses on $196
billion spent on the securities, plus other damages including
civil penalties.  The demands by the FHFA, the conservator for the Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac housing finance agencies, “are draining
capital from the banks” and forcing lenders to restrict new
mortgages and refinancings, Miller said.  In a note to investors yesterday, Miller wrote that the
FHFA should “stop punishing banks” with the mortgage buybacks.
Repurchase losses may total $121 billion, he said. Miller
previously said the tally might range from $54 billion to $106
billion. Losses for  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  could reach $66
billion in some scenarios, he wrote.  The stock of Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of
America, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, has the most exposure
to the demand for mortgage repurchases and will continue to be
volatile, Miller said in the interview. San Francisco-based
 Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  and Cincinnati-based  Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB)  are
safer stocks, though their long-term returns might be lower,
Miller said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
