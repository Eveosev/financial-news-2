Hovnanian Enterprises Inc. (HOV) , the
largest homebuilder in  New Jersey , reported a narrower third-
quarter loss as it reduced writedowns on land amid slumping
demand for new houses.  The net loss was $50.9 million, or 47 cents a share, for
the period ended July 31, compared with a loss of $72.9 million,
or 92 cents, a year earlier, the Red Bank-based company said
today in a statement. The average estimate of 10 analysts in a
Bloomberg survey was for a loss of 51 cents a share.  Hovnanian, the worst-performing homebuilder stock in the
past 12 months, has been buying land at distressed prices in an
effort to boost margins. Tighter credit and a jobless rate above
9 percent are discouraging home purchases. Sales of new houses
fell 0.7 percent in July to a 298,000 annual pace, the lowest
level in five months, the Commerce Department said Aug. 23.  “Recently ‘less bad’ just hasn’t been good enough for
investors,” Megan McGrath, an analyst with MKM Partners LLC, in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut , said in an e-mail before the report.
“There is a concern that earnings may deteriorate from here.”  Hovnanian’s revenue declined to $285.6 million from $380.6
million a year earlier. Net orders increased 33 percent to 1,297
homes from a year earlier.  The results included $11.4 million in land-related
impairments, down from $49 million a year earlier.  ‘Appropriate Steps’  “We see very few indicators that any recovery in the
housing market has begun,” Chairman  Ara Hovnanian  said in the
statement. “As such, we are taking appropriate steps to run our
business based on current market conditions, with a focus on
maintaining adequate liquidity.”  The company spent about $105 million in the third quarter
to buy 1,200 lots and develop land, resulting in cash flow of
negative $76.2 million for the period.  Hovnanian’s loss was the company’s 19th out of the past 20
quarters. Its one profit, in the three months that ended in
January 2010, was the result of a federal tax break.  Hovnanian reported earnings after the close of regular U.S.
trading. The shares rose 16 cents to $1.65 as of 4:15 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. They have dropped 57
percent in the last 12 months for the biggest loss in the 13-
member Bloomberg homebuilder index, which is down 26 percent for
the period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
