How can we get America back to work? We've tried stimulus, tried tax cuts, tried boosting exports, tried readying our shovels -- but last month's zero-net-job-growth showed the depth of our employment woes. President Obama will share his latest ideas with a joint session of Congress, and anyone not watching the NFL pregame, on Thursday night. The Bloomberg View editors and columnists have been issuing sage advice, detailed prescriptions and, well, a few eccentric thoughts during our first three months. Now, readers, it's your turn. We invite you to share your ideas or raise questions in the comments section below -- both before and after the presidential address. My colleague George Anders and I will respond to them in the View's very first Twitter live chat, at 10:30 a.m. EST on Friday Sept. 9. Follow the action @bloombergview, and we also encourage you to Tweet questions and suggestions during the event. You can also follow us individually @GeorgeAnders and @tobinharshaw. Want to get up to speed? Here is a brief rundown of some things we've suggested so far: -- To forget the  cheap-money gambit -- To give hard workers  some debt relief  -- To  listen to Alan Krueger , the new head of the  Council of Economic Advisers -- To  ban the box -- To learn from Minnesota and Georgia about  helping the long-term unemployed -- To give  entrepreneurs a leg up -- To ditch the  Davis-Bacon act -- To create a  National Infrastructure Bank -- To shorten federal  unemployment benefits -- To cut back on  corporate welfare -- To  frack -- To stop  looking for the Fed  to come to the rescue -- To  pass trade pacts , but insist on concurrent job training And of course, our columnists have had an opinion or two on the matter. -- Alice Shroeder cautioned over  the rise of the temporary workforce -- Ezra Klein first called for  infrastucture spending ,  but then decided that the  best advice was no advice -- Ramesh Ponnuru blamed  high corporate taxes -- Jonathan Alter called for converting unemployment insurance payments into  vouchers that can be used by companies  to hire workers. -- Ron Klain called for  casting a wide net , and said that Obama should add a  "moral element"  to his wonkishness -- Virginia Postrel noted that  public-works spending  is hardly a panacea -- And  Caroline Baum  asked, bluntly,  "Since when is it government’s job to create jobs?"
