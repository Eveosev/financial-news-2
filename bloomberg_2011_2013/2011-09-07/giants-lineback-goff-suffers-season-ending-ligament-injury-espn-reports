New York Giants  lost a sixth
defensive player to a season-ending injury as starting middle
linebacker Jonathan Goff tore a knee ligament,  ESPN said .  Goff was injured in a knee-to-knee collision with a
teammate during practice two days ago and tests revealed a tear
of his right anterior cruciate ligament, ESPN said, citing an
unidentified person familiar with the situation.  Goff, 25, was a fifth-round pick of the Giants in the 2008
National Football League draft and started all 16 games for the
team last season. Former Giants linebacker Kawika Mitchell may
be re-signed to replace Goff, ESPN said.  The Giants already lost linebacker Clint Sintim, defensive
tackle Marvin Austin and cornerbacks Terrell Thomas, Bruce Johnson and Brian Witherspoon to season-ending injuries. The
team opens the NFLâ€™s regular season on Sept. 11 against the
 Washington Redskins .  To contact the reporter on this story:
