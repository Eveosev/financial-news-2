Representatives for the  National
Basketball Association  and its players’ union will meet today
for the fourth time since owners imposed a lockout July 1.  Both sides met yesterday for about five hours at a midtown
Manhattan hotel. Among those present were NBA Commissioner  David Stern , Deputy Commissioner Adam Silver, union Executive Director
 Billy Hunter , President Derek Fisher and lead outside counsel
Jeff Kessler.  Union Vice President Roger Mason Jr., a free agent who
played for the  New York Knicks  last season, said in a telephone
interview that he’s more optimistic an agreement can be reached.
The season is scheduled to begin Nov. 1.  “Seems like the league and the union understand how
pivotal the timing is,” he said. “It feels like the tone is,
‘Let’s try to get something done sooner rather than later.’”  The league and union are haggling over how to share more
than $4 billion in annual revenue.  Stern has said the teams lost a collective $300 million
last season and that a system is needed whereby a well-managed
club can compete for a championship and make money.  To contact the reporter on this story:
