The U.S. Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau is seeking public comment on financial
products aimed especially at members of the military.  The bureau, which is charged with educating consumers about
potentially fraudulent financial products, is seeking
information on services used by members of the military
including those “specifically tailored to their needs,”
according to a statement e-mailed today.  The agency is also seeking information on homeowner
assistance programs, such as those for mortgage modification,
and marketing and communications strategies aimed at members of
the military.  “Military families face unique challenges especially when
it comes to their finances,” Holly Petraeus, the bureau’s
assistant director for the Office of Servicemember Affairs, said
in the statement. “By identifying the products and services
that aim to assist their particular needs, our office will be
able to better serve service members and their families.”  Public comments will be due 14 days after a notice is
published in the Federal Register.  To contact the reporter on this story:
