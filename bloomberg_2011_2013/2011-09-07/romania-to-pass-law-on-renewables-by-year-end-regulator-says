The Romanian parliament may approve
a law on renewable energy by the end of this year which will
give incentives for investors, said Zoltan Nagy-Bege, the head
of the countryâ€™s energy regulator.  The government will amend the law, cleared by the European
Commission, by the end of September and then seek approval from
parliament, Nagy-Bege said today at an energy conference in the
southern Romanian city of Constanta.  Romania plans to generate 24 percent of its energy from
renewable sources and 42.62 percent of its gross domestic
electricity consumption from renewables by 2020. The European
Union has a target to get 20 percent of energy from renewables
within the same timeframe.  The law change may mean consumer electricity prices
increase by 10 percent next year to pay for renewable sources
such as the building of wind farms, Nagy-Bege told reporters in
Constanta, according to news service Mediafax.  To contact the reporter on this story:
