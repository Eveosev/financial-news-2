HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  has been told by
regulators in  Hong Kong  that it would be welcome if it decided
to leave Britain and re-domicile, City AM reported, without
saying where it got the information.  The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has informed the bank that
it would be implicitly backed by the Chinese government if it
decided to move to Hong Kong, the newspaper said.  The HKMA declined to comment, in an e-mailed statement
today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
