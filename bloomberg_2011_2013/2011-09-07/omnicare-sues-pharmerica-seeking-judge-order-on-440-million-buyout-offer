Omnicare Inc. (OCR)  sued PharMerica Corp.
in an attempt to force PharMerica directors to seriously
consider Omnicare’s $440 million purchase offer and to rescind a
poison pill anti-takeover defense.  Omnicare sued the directors after they rejected an Aug. 23
offer of $15 a share, 37 percent higher than PharMerica’s
previous closing price on Aug. 22, according to the complaint
filed today in Delaware Chancery Court in Wilmington.  “The director defendants’ actions have made clear that
they intend to protect their own individual positions even if
this deprives PharMerica’s stockholders of their right to decide
for themselves whether to realize an extremely valuable
opportunity,” Omnicare said in the lawsuit.  PharMerica directors “will review the offer to determine
the course of action that it believes is in the best interests
of the company and its stockholders,” the Louisville, Kentucky-
based company said in a statement today.  Thomas Caneris, PharMerica general counsel, didn’t
immediately return a call seeking comment on the lawsuit.  Omnicare, based in Covington,  Kentucky , began a tender
offer to buy  PharMerica Corp. (PMC)  for about $440.8 million in cash
to seize a majority of the market to distribute drugs to nursing
homes, hospitals and hospices.  The deal would combine the country’s two largest
institutional pharmacies and may spark scrutiny from antitrust
regulators, A.J. Rice, an analyst at Susquehanna Financial
Group, said when the offer was first announced.  The case is Omnicare Inc. v. PharMerica Corp., CA6841,
Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporters on this story:
