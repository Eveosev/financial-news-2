The U.K.’s opposition Labour party
has the broadest potential support among voters of any of the
three main parties, the  Observer  reported, citing a  YouGov Plc (YOU) 
poll.  The survey for the thinktank IPPR found 70 percent would
consider voting for Labour, with 64 percent for the Liberal
Democrats and 58 percent for the Conservatives, the newspaper
said.  In the south of England, 40 percent of people said they
would “never” vote for Labour, compared with 33 percent for
the Tories and 35 percent for the  Lib Dems , the poll showed.  The telephone survey was conducted among 2,474 adults, the
newspaper said. No margin of error was provided.  To contact the reporter on this story:
