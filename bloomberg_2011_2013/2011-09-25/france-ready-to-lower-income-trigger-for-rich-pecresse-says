French Budget Minister Valerie
Pecresse said the country is “ready” to lower the threshold
income from 500,000 euros ($673,500) to trigger the tax level on
high-earners.  Pecresse declined to specify what the new threshold should
be, saying it is up to the Parliament.  Pecresse spoke on the television program Le Grand Jury on
LCI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
