Ukraine achieved “substantial
progress” in natural gas talks with Russia as President  Viktor
Yanukovych  met Russian leaders this weekend, Interfax said,
citing his press office in Kiev.  Yanukovych met his Russian counterpart Dmitry Medvedev and
Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  near Moscow and discussed the
terms of gas transit and supplies, Interfax said.  Significant progress was made in determining terms of
Russian gas transit via Ukraine, the Moscow-based newswire
reported separately, citing Natalia Timakova, a spokeswoman for
the Russian president.  Ukraine and Russia decided to hold an inter-government
meeting in Ukraine in October, according to Interfax.  To contact the reporter on this story:
