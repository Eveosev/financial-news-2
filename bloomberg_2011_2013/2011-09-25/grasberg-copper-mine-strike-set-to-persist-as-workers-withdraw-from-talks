Workers at  Freeport-McMoRan Copper
& Gold Inc. (FCX)  in Indonesia’s Grasberg mine will rally on Sept. 29
after failing to agree on pay increases in government-brokered
talks last week, as the strike continues, a union official said.  About half of 8,000 non-staff workers at Grasberg in Papua
province, who have walked out of jobs since Sept. 15, will join
the protest, said Virgo Solossa, head of organizational affairs
at PT Freeport Indonesia’s labor union.  Workers in  Peru ,  Chile ,  Bolivia  and Indonesia have gone on
strike at copper, gold and zinc mines this year, seeking
improved conditions and a bigger slice of record profits after
metal prices more than doubled since the end of 2008. The strike
at Grasberg, which has the world’s largest recoverable reserves
of copper, has raised concern it may widen a global deficit and
boost prices.  “We have conducted a peaceful stoppage in the 12 days of
strike, but the management doesn’t appreciate that and has
declared that our activity is illegal,” Solossa said in a
telephone interview from Timika, the closest town to Grasberg.
“We want to show that we remain solid and will question the ‘no
work no pay’ note from management as well as sanctions against
several strikers, to the manpower office in the rally.”  Freeport, based in Phoenix, will uphold its legal right not
to pay employees on a day where workers do not report to work,
Freeport  Indonesia  said in an internal newsletter posted on its
website dated Sept. 22. The right is stated in the 2003 labor
law, Ramdani Sirait, a Jakarta-based spokesman at Freeport, said
in a mobile-phone text message today.  Freeport and the union at Grasberg ended 38 days of talks
over 2011-2013 contract terms on Aug. 26 after failing to agree
on wages. Negotiations started after the workers put down tools
for eight days in July. The mine is located in Papua province,
1,940 miles (3,120 kilometers) east of Jakarta.  Estimated Loss  Three-month delivery copper declined 4.6 percent to $7,020
a ton on the London Metal Exchange at 3:03 p.m. Jakarta time.
The metal fell as much as 7.6 percent earlier.  Freeport will lose 3 million pounds (1,361 metric tons) of
copper and 5,000 ounces of gold a day because of the strike, the
Phoenix-based company said Sept. 21. Indonesia’s government
estimated a potential loss of 230,000 tons of ore a day.  Copper production at the mine fell to 1.22 billion pounds
(553.4 million kilograms) last year from 1.41 billion pounds in
2009, according to Freeport’s website. Gold output declined to
1.79 million ounces from 2.57 million ounces.  Grasberg workers are seeking an increase in wages to
between $17.50 and $43 an hour from $1.50 to $3.50, Solossa said
Sept. 14. The union had initially sought a raise of $35 to $200
an hour. Freeport offered a compensation package that includes
an increase in basic wages of 22 percent over a two-year period,
Sirait said on Sept. 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
