Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) 
slumped to the lowest level since December 2006, narrowing the
gap with the U.S.-traded shares, after European regulators said
they need more time to review its bid for Cephalon Inc.  The stock of the world’s largest maker of generic drugs
declined 3.1 percent to 130.30 shekels, the equivalent of
$35.19, at the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv. The New York-traded
shares lost 8.6 percent last week to $35.26.  The European Commission on Sept. 23 extended its antitrust
review of Teva’s bid for Cephalon, setting a new deadline of
Oct. 13. Teva’s $6.8 billion acquisition of the U.S.
biotechnology company was supposed to be concluded by the end of
the third quarter, according to Natali Gotlieb, a Tel Aviv-based
analyst at IBI-Israel Brokerage & Investments Ltd.  “As long as the deal isn’t closed, it will take longer for
Teva to include Cephalon’s earnings,” Gotlieb said by
telephone.  Investors also are concerned that 2011 earnings may miss
forecasts, said Jonathan Kreizman, an analyst at Clal Finance
Brokerage Ltd. in  Tel Aviv . Teva is forecast to earn $4.84 per
share for the year, according to the median estimate of eight
analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  The shares of Petach Tikva, Israel-based Teva have tumbled
30 percent this year amid concern about the future of its best-
selling multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone, compared with a 20
percent drop for the benchmark TA-25 Index. Copaxone, an
injected treatment that accounted for 23 percent of Teva’s
second-quarter revenue, is facing competition from the first
approved multiple sclerosis pill from Novartis AG.  To contact the reporter on this story:
