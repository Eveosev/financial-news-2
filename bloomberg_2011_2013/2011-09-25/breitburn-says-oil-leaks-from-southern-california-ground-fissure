BreitBurn Energy Partners, the Los
Angeles-based energy producer, said a fissure opened in the
ground at one of its California oil fields, spilling crude down
a hillside.  The crack at the top of a hill near the town of Orcutt in
Santa Barbara County opened about 1:30 p.m. local time
yesterday, the company said in a filing with the California
Emergency Management Agency. The fissure “burped” and the leak
stopped, according to the filing.  An estimated two barrels, or 84 gallons, of crude leaked
from the crack, BreitBurn said in the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
