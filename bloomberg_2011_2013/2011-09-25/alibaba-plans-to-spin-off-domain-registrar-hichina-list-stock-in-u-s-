Alibaba.com Ltd. (1688) , the business-to-
business marketplace operator owned by China’s biggest e-
commerce company, plans to list its HiChina Group Ltd. domain-
name service unit in the U.S.  Alibaba has submitted its proposal to the exchange, the
company said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange
today. Details including the size, structure and price of the
listing are yet to be decided, according to the statement.  Alibaba bought 85 percent of HiChina in 2009 for about $79
million. HiChina, which provides domain-name services, is
expanding into website design and development, as well as
hosting services, the company said in its interim report in
August.  The International Financing Review reported in June that
Alibaba.com may spin off the unit in the U.S. and raise between
$200 million and $300 million. John Spelich, a Hong Kong-based
spokesman for Alibaba, said he couldn’t comment on how much the
sale may raise.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
