Clashes between cattle farmers and
nomads in a North  Darfur  village left five dead and two injured,
 United Nations  said today.  Tamaru village was the site of deadly clashes on Sept. 22
involving “disputes over animals grazing in the farms,” the UN-
African Union peacekeeping mission in Darfur (UNAMID) said in a
press release today. Three farmers and two nomads were killed in
the fighting that also left two farmers injured, according to
the report.  On Sept. 21, a military gunship helicopter was seen flying
at low altitude over the village of Khor Abeche, South Darfur,
the UN said. It fired two rockets in the area of Umgafala, about
9 kilometers (5.6 miles) north of Khor Abeche, the UNAMID added
in the statement.  The number of armed attacks in  Sudan ’s western region of
Darfur, which numbers more than 17,000 troops and 4,500 police
officers, has declined 70 percent in the past three years,
UNAMID joint special representative, Ibrahim Gambari, said on
Sept. 14.  Darfur’s nomads may number one million and make up some 60
percent of the state population, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
