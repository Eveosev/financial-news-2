The Chinese government is
investigating 31 officials as part of a probe into injuries
caused by forced evictions this year, the official Xinhua News
Agency reported, citing four government departments.  The cases comprise six illegal demolitions of homes and five
cases that were lawful but badly handled, the report said,
citing the State Council, the Ministry of Supervision, the
Ministry of Land and Resources, and the Ministry of Housing and
Urban-Rural Development. In one case on March 26 in northeast
 Jilin province , a woman died after she was buried by rubble
during an illegal forced demolition, Xinhua said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
