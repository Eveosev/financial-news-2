At least 19 protesters were
killed in central  Syria  as security forces fired at
protesters, activists said.  About 15 people were killed by gunfire during a
demonstration in Homs yesterday, and another four in the
suburbs of Damascus, Mahmoud Merhi, the Damascus-based head
of the Arab Organization for Human Rights, and Nitham al-
Siraj, a Homs-based human rights activist, said in
telephone interviews. More than 100 people were killed last
week, according to Merhi.  Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad, who inherited power
from his father 11 years ago, is facing increasing
international pressure to end the violence. More than 3,600
civilians have been killed since protests began in March,
according to Ammar Qurabi of the National Organization for
Human Rights in Syria. About 30,000 people have been
detained and 13,000 are still being held, he estimates.  “The government continues to take decisions that are
opposite from the democratic steps the protesters are
calling for,” Hasan Abdul-Azim, 81, a spokesman for the
opposition Democratic National Group, said in a telephone
interview.  The European Union and U.S. have imposed sanctions on
Syria, including banning oil imports, and called on Assad
to cede power.  France ’s ambassador to Syria, Eric Chevallier, was attacked with eggs and rocks by government
supporters in Damascus yesterday as he left a meeting,
 Agence France-Presse  reported. He was unharmed.  Bassam Najm el-Din Antakiali, the commander of Syria’s
armed forces, died of a heart attack, state-run  Syrian Arab
News Agency reported .  To contact the reporter on this story:
