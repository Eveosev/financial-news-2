The number of used-home
transactions in 10 of  Hong Kong ’s biggest private developments
fell from a week earlier amid homebuyers’ concern over slowing
global economic growth.  The number of deals recorded on Sept. 24 and 25 in projects
including Tai Koo Shing and Mei Foo Sun Chuen dropped to 10 from
22 a week earlier,  Centaline Property Agency Ltd. , Hong Kong’s
biggest closely held realtor, said in an e-mailed statement
today.  Hong Kong’s home sales have slowed on concern the city will
slip into a recession. Real estate prices, which have surged
over 70 percent since early 2009, fell for the first time in
seven months in July after the government introduced new housing
curbs in June, while banks increased  mortgage rates  this month.  The Hang Seng Property Index, which tracks the city’s seven
biggest developers, has fallen 27 percent this year, compared
with a 23 percent decline in the benchmark  Hang Seng Index .  To contact the reporter on this story:
