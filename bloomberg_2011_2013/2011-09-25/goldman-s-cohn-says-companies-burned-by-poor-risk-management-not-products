Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  President
 Gary Cohn  said poor risk-management, not sophisticated products,
is to blame for financial-company losses and failures.  “If you don’t invest in risk-management, it doesn’t matter
what business you’re in, it’s a risky business,” Cohn said
today at a panel discussion in  Washington  sponsored by the
 Institute of International Finance .  The cause of financial-company collapses dating back to
Barings Plc or Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. has “never been
sophisticated products, it’s been a risk-management issue or a
separation of duties problem” in which a trader was able to
manipulate operational controls in the back office, Cohn said.  Goldman Sachs has a “robust separation of duties in our
organization” between traders and back-office administrators so
that traders can’t manipulate operational controls, he said.
“We have just continuously reiterated a farther divide in how
those people interact to make sure we’re protecting the assets
of the firm.”  While Goldman Sachs allows employees to change jobs and
move into the trading business from the back office, Cohn said
the New York-based company ensures that those traders lose
access to administrative processes they had in the back office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
