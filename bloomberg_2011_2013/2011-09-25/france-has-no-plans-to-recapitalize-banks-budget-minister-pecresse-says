French Budget Minister Valerie
Pecresse said that the government has no plans for a
recapitalization of French banks and that the lenders are
“solid” and don’t need more funds.  The government is “working hand in hand with the banks”
and meets with the banks’ chiefs often, Pecresse said. The
minister declined to confirm whether a meeting took place on
Sept. 11 between the government and the heads of  France ’s five
biggest banks regarding an investment plan, as reported today by
Journal du Dimanche.  Pecresse spoke on the television program Le Grand Jury on
LCI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
