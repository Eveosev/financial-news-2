Paraguay  cattle suffering from
an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease are crossing the border
into neighboring  Brazil , O Estado de Sao Paulo  reported .  The Sao Paulo-based newspaper said its reporters drove
through 410 kilometers (254 miles) of frontier between the two
South American countries, and saw cattle crossing the border
freely.  Two inspection stations and no inspection crews were
found during a 12-hour drive, the newspaper said.  Brazil and Argentina suspended beef imports from landlocked
Paraguay on Sept. 21, after the outbreak. The disease is
considered one of the most contagious livestock illnesses in
cattle by the World Organization for  Animal Health , or OIE. The
virus affects cloven-hoofed animals such as cattle, pigs and
sheep and can kill young animals, according to the OIE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
