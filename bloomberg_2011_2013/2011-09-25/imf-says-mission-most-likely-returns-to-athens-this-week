The International Monetary Fund
said its mission will “most likely” return to  Athens  this
coming week.  “The managing director of the IMF,  Christine Lagarde , met
with  Greece ’s Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos today in
 Washington . They discussed the terms under which the IMF mission
would return to Athens to undertake the fifth review of Greece’s
economic program -- most likely this coming week,” the IMF said
in a statement sent by e-mail.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
