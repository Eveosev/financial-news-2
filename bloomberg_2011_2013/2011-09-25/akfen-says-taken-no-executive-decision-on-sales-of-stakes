Afen Holding AS, a Turkish builder
and energy company, said its excutive board took no decision to
review options for its stakes in companies such as airport
manager TAV Havalimanlari.  Akfen hasn’t authorised any investment bank to carry out
the review, the company said in a statement to the  Istanbul
Stock Exchange .  The company is in talks with as many as four
international banks to help advise on the possible sale of
stakes in airport-management units, said a person with knowledge
of the situation on Sept. 23.  The company, which has a 26 percent stake in TAV
Havalimanlari,  Turkey ’s biggest airport operator, is seeking
ways to raise financing to bid in sales of state assets, the
Akfen statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
