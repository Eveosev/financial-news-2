Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in  China  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the 3 p.m. close.  The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, fell 39.98 points, or 1.6 percent, to
2,393.18, the lowest close since July 5, 2010. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300) 
declined 2.2 percent to 2,610.92.  Developers: China Vanke Co. (000002 CH), the nation’s
biggest listed property developer, fell 3.4 percent to 7.15 yuan,
the lowest close since July 8, 2010. Poly Real Estate Group Co.
(600048 CH), the second largest, lost 4.3 percent to 9.10 yuan,
the lowest close since June 2.  China’s southwestern city of Chongqing will start imposing
a property tax on owners of existing villas from Oct. 1, the
first Chinese city to tax existing homes, China Business News
reported, citing an unidentified local tax bureau official. Some
developers, likely small- and medium-sized ones with over-
extended balance sheets, face bankruptcy in coming months as the
government tightens control on loans obtained from  trust
companies  and as sales slow, UBS AG said in a Sept. 23 report.  Beiqi Foton Motor Co. (600166 CH), China’s biggest
commercial-vehicle maker, climbed 3.7 percent to 7.48 yuan, its
highest close in almost two weeks. The company said it will
invest 2.13 billion yuan ($333 million) to build a machinery
plant in China.  Ping An Insurance (Group) Co. (601318 CH), China’s second-
biggest insurer, tumbled 9.6 percent to 34.37 yuan, its biggest
loss since November 2008. Its Hong Kong-listed shares plunged as
much as 15 percent on speculation shareholder HSBC Holdings Plc
sold shares of the company.  “There’s speculation that HSBC is selling Ping An’s shares
on the Hong Kong stock market,” said Cao Hengqian, an analyst
covering the  insurance industry  at GF Securities Co. in the
southern city of  Guangzhou . “Ping An’s Shanghai-listed shares
are simply following the slump on its underlying H-shares.”  Jessica Lennon, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman at HSBC,
declined to comment while Sheng Ruisheng, Ping An’s spokesman,
said the insurer had nothing to disclose on the share price
movement.  TCL Corp. (000100)  (000100 CH), China’s biggest publicly traded
consumer-electronics maker, jumped 4.8 percent to 2.20 yuan, its
largest gain since July 26. The company said third-quarter net
income may have risen as much as 720 percent from the same
period a year earlier to about 310 million yuan.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
