British police have charged a man
in connection with an investigation into allegations that packs
of the Nurofen Plus pain relief drug were tampered with.  Christopher McGuire, 30, will appear at  London ’s City of
Westminster Magistrates’ Court tomorrow charged with one count
of contamination of goods and two counts of administering a
noxious substance, the Metropolitan Police said in an e-mailed
statement late yesterday.  Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc (RB/)  recalled and halted
manufacturing and distribution of the Nurofen Plus painkiller in
August after boxes were found to have been tampered with.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
