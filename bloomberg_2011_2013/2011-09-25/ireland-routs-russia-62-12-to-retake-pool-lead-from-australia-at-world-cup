Ireland beat  Russia  62-12 to regain
the Pool C lead at the Rugby  World Cup  in  New Zealand .  Center Keith Earls touched down twice as Ireland outscored
Russia by nine tries to two at Rotorua International Stadium to
secure the bonus-point victory. Fly-half Ronan O’Garamissed
only one of his eight kicks at goal to finish with 15 points.  Ireland leads  Australia  by three points in their five-team
group with both nations having played three matches. The Irish
finish their pool schedule against  Italy  on Oct. 2.  Samoa earlier beat Fiji 27-7 to stay in contention of
winning Pool D.  Scotland  can clinch a place in the quarterfinals
with a win over  Argentina  in tonight’s Pool B match in
Wellington.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
