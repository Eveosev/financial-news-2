Greek Finance Minister Evangelos
Venizelos said that the main problem for his country is the
public sector.  “The main problem for my country is the public sector and
the capability of the public administration to offer the
necessary services to our people, to our society with a cheaper,
more clever way,” Venizelos said at an event in  Washington 
today.   To contact the reporter on this story:
