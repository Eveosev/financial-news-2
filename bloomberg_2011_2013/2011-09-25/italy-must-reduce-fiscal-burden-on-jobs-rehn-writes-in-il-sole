Italy needs to cut the tax burden
on jobs because high taxation is one reason for the countryâ€™s
low employment rate, European Union Economic and Monetary
Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  and EU Industry Commissioner
Antonio Tajani wrote in Il Sole 24 Ore today.  Italy should also limit spending on pensions and speed up a
move to raise the eligible  retirement age  for women at private
companies, the two added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
