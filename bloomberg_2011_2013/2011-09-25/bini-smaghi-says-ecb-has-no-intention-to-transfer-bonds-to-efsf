European Central Bank Executive
Board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi said the central bank has “no
intention to transfer” its governement bonds to “anybody
else.”  Bini Smaghi responded to a question in a panel debate in
 Washington  about whether the central bank would seek to offload
its existing government bond holdings to the European Financial
Stability Facility. He said the ECB will hold its bonds to
maturity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
