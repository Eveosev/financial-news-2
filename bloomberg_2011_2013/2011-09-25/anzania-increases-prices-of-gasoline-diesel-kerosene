Tanzania increased gasoline, diesel
and kerosene prices as the cost of petroleum products rose in
international markets.  The price of gasoline has been raised by 3.6 percent,
diesel by 2.4 percent and kerosene by 1.8 percent, the Energy
and Water Utilities Regulatory Authority said in an e-mailed
statement today. The changes will be effective for two weeks
starting Sept. 26.  The so-called indicative price for gasoline will be 2,102
Tanzanian shillings per liter, while the same measure of diesel
will be 1,999 shillings and kerosene 1,967 shillings in  Dar es
Salaam , the countryâ€™s commercial capital, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
