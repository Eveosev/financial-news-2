Societe Nationale des Chemins de
Fer Francais,  France ’s state-owned rail company, must find ways
to make its TGV high-speed rail service more efficient and may
regroup travelers on railways used by both high-speed and local
lines, Journal du Dimanche said today, citing an interview with
SNCF Chief Executive Officer Guillaume Pepy.  SNCF needs “to invest in a new generation” train to keep
the TGV program competitive internationally with Japanese,
Korean and German rivals, Pepy said, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
