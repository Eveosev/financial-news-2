Barclays Plc (BARC)  Chief Executive
Officer  Robert Diamond  said central banks are supposed to inject
liquidity into the financial system and shouldn’t be criticized
for doing so.  “It should not be looked at as a subsidy,” Diamond said
today at a panel discussion sponsored by the Institute of
International Finance. “It’s the role of central banks.”  Diamond also said no bank should be too big to fail and
that regulators must ensure they have plans to wind down
financial firms if necessary.  To contact the reporter on this story:
