The  New York Jets  suffered their
first loss of the season against the  Oakland Raiders , while the
 New York Giants  and  Buffalo Bills  ended losing streaks against
division rivals.  Darren McFadden rushed for a career-high 171 yards and two
touchdowns as the Raiders won 34-24 in their home opener at
Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum in  California . The Jets, who
fell to 2-1, had been one of seven undefeated teams entering
Week 3 of the National Football League season.  “You have 439 yards of offense and you lose the game,
that’s unbelievable,” Jets coach  Rex Ryan  said at a news
conference. “Our defense let us down clearly.”  The Giants beat the Eagles 29-16 at Lincoln Financial Field
in Philadelphia, where they knocked Eagles quarterback  Michael Vick  out of the game in the fourth quarter with a fractured bone
in his non-throwing hand. The Giants had previously lost six
straight games against their NFC East rivals.  The Bills ended a 15-game losing skid against the  New
England Patriots , rallying from a 21-0 first-half deficit to win
34-31 at home and improve to 3-0 on the season.  Ryan Fitzpatrick passed for 369 yards and two touchdowns,
while the Bills’ defense had four interceptions of New England’s
Tom Brady to give the Patriots their first loss. The Bills are
alone in first place in the AFC East, ahead of the Patriots and
Jets, who are both 2-1.  “There were probably very few believers going into this
game,” said Fitzpatrick, who won Buffalo’s starting quarterback
job last year. “In terms of what this means for the city of
Buffalo, it’s the biggest win since I’ve been here for sure.”  Unbeaten Lions  The  Detroit Lions  are 3-0 for the first time since 1980
after erasing a 20-0 first-half deficit to beat the Minnesota
Vikings 26-23 in overtime. Jason Hanson kicked his fourth field
goal of the game on the only overtime possession to send
Minnesota to its first 0-3 start since beginning the 2002 season
with four losses in a row.  The defending Super Bowl-champion Green Bay Packers remain
undefeated after a 27-17 win over the Bears at Chicago’s Soldier
Field.  Aaron Rodgers  threw three touchdown passes for the
Packers, all to tight end Jermichael Finley.  The Houston Texans fell short of their first 3-0 start
after allowing three fourth-quarter touchdowns in a 40-33 loss
to the Saints at the Superdome in  New Orleans .  The Indianapolis Colts remain winless without injured
quarterback Peyton Manning, losing 23-20 to the Pittsburgh
Steelers last night on a 38-yard field goal by Shane Suisham
with four seconds remaining. Pittsburgh, the defending AFC
champion, improved to 2-1, while the Colts fell to 0-3.  Cowboys vs Redskins  Week 3 concludes tonight with the  Dallas Cowboys  hosting
the 2-0  Washington Redskins  in a clash of NFC East rivals.  The Tampa Bay Buccaneers held off a fourth-quarter rally by
Atlanta in a 16-13 win over the Falcons, while the Baltimore
Ravens routed the St. Louis Rams 37-7 behind a 389-yard, three
touchdown performance by  Joe Flacco .  Also in Week 3, it was San Francisco 13, Cincinnati 8;
Cleveland 17, Miami 16; Tennessee 17, Denver 14; Seattle 13,
Arizona 10; and San Diego 20, Kansas City 17.  In Oakland, the Raiders overcame a 17-7 second-quarter
deficit as McFadden had a 70-yard scoring run and Denarius Moore
and Michael Bush added rushing touchdowns.  The Raiders improved their record to 2-1 and finished with
234 rushing yards against a Jets’ defense that ranked third
against the run last season.  New York ’s final drive ended with less than a minute left
as quarterback Mark Sanchez was stopped short of the goal line
on a fourth down. The Jets were initially given a touchdown
before the play was overruled by a replay review.  Sanchez’s Effort  Sanchez finished with a career-high 369 passing yards and
two touchdowns for the Jets.  The Giants opened a 14-0 lead in Philadelphia before the
Eagles rallied. After the home team took a 16-14 lead, the
Giants scored 15 unanswered points in the fourth quarter with
Vick on the bench with a fractured right hand.  Victor Cruz hauled in his second touchdown pass of the game
with 8:07 remaining and  Brandon Jacobs  added the two-point
conversion to give New York a 22-16 lead. Eli Manning then threw
his fourth touchdown pass for the Giants, an 18-yarder to  Ahmad Bradshaw  with 3:32 left, to cap the scoring.  The Giants improved to 2-1 with the win, while the Eagles
dropped to 1-2. New York lost 38-31 in the teams’ previous
meeting on Dec. 19 after giving up 28 straight fourth-quarter
points to blow a 31-10 lead.  “This year, unlike last year, we won the last eight
minutes of the game,” Manning said. “Guys stepped up, made
some big plays, defense got turnovers, and we were able to get
the victory, so that was a big win for us.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
