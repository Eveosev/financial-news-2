BAE Systems Plc (BA/) ,  Europe ’s largest
defense company, said it told staff it’s reviewing operations
amid media reports of as many as 3,000 job losses.  “We are reviewing our operations across various businesses
to make sure the company is performing as effectively and
efficiently as possible,” Leonie Foster, a spokeswoman for the
London-based company said in an e-mailed statement. “As the
outcome of this review becomes clear, we will, as always,
communicate to our employees as a priority.”  U.K. media said as many as 3,000 job cuts will be announced
this week. Foster wasn’t able to confirm the figure or comment
on any possible announcement. Unite, Britain’s second-biggest
workers union, said it’s seeking ‘urgent’ discussions with BAE
Systems.  “We will be seeking urgent talks with BAE Systems to try
and clarify where these jobs are under threat, and to work with
them to avoid compulsory redundancies wherever possible,” Ian
Waddell, Unite’s national officer for aerospace said in an e-
mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
