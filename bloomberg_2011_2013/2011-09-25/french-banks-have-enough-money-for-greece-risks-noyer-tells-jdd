French banks have enough capital to
withstand possible losses from Greece-related risks and have no
hidden problem assets, Bank of France Governor  Christian Noyer 
told Journal du Dimanche in an interview.  The banks can handle the risk with less than six months of
their profits, Noyer also told the newspaper.  He denied a report in the newspaper today that the Finance
Ministry and French banks are working on a plan to recapitalize
lenders with public money and said there is no need because the
banks have adequate capital, Journal du Dimanche reported.  “I don’t see any sign” that banks face a run by
depositors and the idea of one is “preposterous,” Noyer told
the publication.  The Journal du Dimanche reported Ramon Fernandez, head of
the French Treasury, met with the heads of  BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA,
 Societe Generale (GLE)  SA,  Credit Agricole SA (ACA) , BPCE SA and Credit
Mutuel SA at the Finance Ministry on Sept. 11 to propose a plan
for public investment similar to one implemented in 2008, citing
unidentified persons at the ministry and banks.  Societe Generale Chief Executive Officer Frederic Oudea
said all five would have to participate so none were
stigmatized, Journal du Dimanche reported. The plan fell through
when BNP Chief Executive Officer  Baudouin Prot  refused to
participate, the newspaper said.  President Nicolas Sarkozy’s office denied any such plan,
the newspaper said. An unidentified member of his office said
the banks were encouraged to raise capital on their own, Journal
du Dimanche said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
