An Israeli government-appointed
panel on consumer prices is likely to recommend cutting taxes on
imports to help bring down food prices, TheMarker reported,

likely to call for the formation of a committee to help boost

declined to comment on the report.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
