Roche Holding AG (ROG) ’s bone-
strengthening drug Boniva works as well as radiotherapy at
relieving pain associated with prostate cancer that’s spread to
the bones, a study found.  In a trial involving 470 patients, a single dose of Boniva
given intravenously was equivalent to a single dose of radiation
for pain relief a year after treatment, according to results of
the trial presented at a conference in Stockholm today.  As much as 70 percent of patients with prostate cancer
that’s spread to their bones get pain relief from radiotherapy,
said Peter Hoskin, a professor of clinical oncology at
 University College London . While Boniva isn’t likely to replace
radiotherapy, it offers patients another treatment option that
may be cheaper and easier to access, Hoskin said in an interview
in  Stockholm .  The drug, which is approved for osteoporosis, brought in 1
billion Swiss francs ($1.1 billion) in sales last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
