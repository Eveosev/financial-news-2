The Philippines is “making
headway” in discussions meant to ensure that competition will
thrive amid the plan of  Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. (TEL) 
to acquire Digital Telecommunications Phils. Inc., Transport and
Communications Secretary Mar Roxas told reporters today.  “There’s positive movement towards meeting the goals of
the government which is to preserve competitiveness of the
industry as well as the goals of the industry players to be able
to have economies of scale,” Roxas said in Manila before he
left for  Japan  to accompany President  Benigno Aquino . The
company known as PLDT announced the acquisition plan in late
March. Roxas said he’s “hopeful” the deal will push through.  To contact the reporter on this story:
