Kenya ’s Patrick Makau retained his
 Berlin marathon  title by winning today’s race in a world record
time. Florence Kiplagat of Kenya claimed the women’s race.  Makau, 26, completed the 26-mile (42.1-kilometer) course,
which finishes near the Brandenburg Gate, in 2 hours, 3 minutes
and 38 seconds. It shaves 21 seconds off the mark set by
Ethiopia’s Haile Gebrselassie in Berlin in 2008.  “At the 25-kilometer mark, I felt then I could break the
world record,” Makau told reporters. “It is the most beautiful
day of my career.”  It is the fifth time in 14 years that the men’s marathon
record has fallen in Berlin. Gebrselassie also set a record
there in 2007, while Kenya’s Paul Tergat and  Brazil ’s Ronaldo da
Costa did so in 2003 and 1998 respectively.  Gebrselassie, 38, failed to finish today, pulling out
before the 40-kilometer mark. He’d stepped off the road after 27
kilometers for about a minute before continuing. Kenya’s Stephen
Kwelio Chemlany and Edwin Kimaiyo were second and third.  Kiplagat, 24, won the women’s race in 2 hours, 19 minutes
and 44 seconds, ahead of Irina Mikitenko of Germany and
Britain’s Paula Radcliffe.  The 37-year-old Radcliffe, competing in her first marathon
since November 2009, achieved the qualifying time to race in
next year’s Olympics in  London .  “I’m not happy because I would have liked to have run
faster and I wanted to win the race,” Radcliffe told the
British Broadcasting Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
