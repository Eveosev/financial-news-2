Mellanox Technologies Ltd. (MLNX)  tumbled
for a sixth day, narrowing the gap with the U.S.-traded stock,
which last week retreated the most since July 2010 after the
company announced a share sale Sept. 19.  The shares of the adapter maker that’s part owned by Oracle
Corp. declined 2.7 percent to 113.40 shekels, the equivalent of
$30.62, at the 4:30 p.m. close in  Tel Aviv . The New York-traded
shares plunged 14 percent last week to close at $30.26 on Sept.
23. Israel’s benchmark TA-25 Index gained 2.1 percent today
after it fell 1.7 percent last week.  Yokneam Elit, Israel-based Mellanox said it would sell 3
million shares to the public and priced the offering at $31.75 a
share on Sept. 21. The Mellanox drop led the Bloomberg Israel-US
25 Index to a 7.6 percent loss last week. The gauge of the
largest New York-traded Israeli companies declined as concern
deepened the economic slowdown will overwhelm government efforts
to support growth.  The Bank of  Israel  cut its forecasts for economic growth
this year and next on Sept. 22, citing increased uncertainty
about the global economy. The economy will expand 4.7 percent in
2011 and 3.2 percent in 2012, the central bank said, compared
with its Aug. 2 predictions of 4.8 percent and 3.9 percent.  The shekel dropped 1.1 percent versus the dollar last week,
closing at 3.7032. The currency is down 4.8 percent this year,
which would be the worst annual performance since 2005 when it
lost 6.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
