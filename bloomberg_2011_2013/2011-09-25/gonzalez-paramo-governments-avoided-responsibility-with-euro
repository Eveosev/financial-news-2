European Central Bank Executive
board member Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Paramo said governments
avoided their responsibility with the Euro as they failed to
meet their fiscal and market flexibility commitments, ABC
newspaper reported in an interview.  “We would not have a sovereign debt crisis if we had not
confronted the crisis with such high public debt levels,”
Gonzalez-Paramo was quoted as saying by ABC.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
