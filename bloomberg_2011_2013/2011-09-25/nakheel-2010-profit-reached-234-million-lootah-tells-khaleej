Nakheel PJSC, the Dubai government-
owned developer that issued Islamic bonds last month, had a
profit of 860 million dirhams ($234 million) in 2010,  Khaleej
 reported, citing Chairman Ali Rashed Lootah.  Lootah added that earnings were likely to improve in 2011,
the newspaper reported.  Revenue rose 10 percent to 15 percent this year due to
greater occupancy in residential units and an increase of
20,000, or 70 percent, in housing units, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
