The New Zealand dollar held earlier
declines after a government report showed that the August trade
deficit was wider than economists had estimated.  The currency traded at 77.29 U.S. cents as of 10:48 a.m.
Wellington time, from 77.30 cents before the data and 77.66
cents on Sept. 23 in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
