Russia  established diplomatic ties
with Tuvalu, a Pacific island nation that became at least the
fifth country to recognize Georgia’s two breakaway regions,
Russia’s Foreign Ministry said on its  website  today.  Tuvalu, a nation of about 12,000 people located midway
between Hawaii and  Australia , recognized Abkhazia and  South
Ossetia  as independent last week, the governments of the two
territories said in separate statements  Sept. 20  and  Sept. 23 .  Abkhazia and South Ossetia declared independence after a
five-day war between Russia and the former Soviet republic of
Georgia in August 2008. Russia, Nicaragua, Venezuela and Nauru,
another country in the South Pacific, previously recognized
their independence. Georgia maintains Russia occupied the two
regions after the conflict.  Tuvalu, formerly known as the Ellice Islands, is a
constitutional monarchy that comprises four reef islands and
five coral atolls.  To contact the reporter on this story:
