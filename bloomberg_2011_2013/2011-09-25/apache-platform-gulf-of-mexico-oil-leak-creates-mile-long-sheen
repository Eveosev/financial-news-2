Apache Corp. (APA)  said an oil leak
aboard a Gulf of Mexico platform created a sheen on the water
that spread for one mile (1.6 kilometer).  The well beneath Apacheâ€™s South Cameron 49 installation was
shut after discovery of the leak, which began about 10 a.m.
local time yesterday, according to a filing with the U.S.
National Response Center. The leak was traced to a hole in a
tube on an oil treater. About 0.18 gallons of crude was
released, according to the filing.  The sheen on the water was about 15 feet wide, the NRC
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
