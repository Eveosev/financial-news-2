German Deputy Finance Minister
 Joerg Asmussen  said euro-region finance ministers won’t be in a
position to decide on the disbursement of the next tranche of
aid to Greece when they meet on Oct. 3 because a report by the
International Monetary Fund,  European Central Bank  and European
Commission has been delayed.  “This disbursement will not take place before the mission
finishes its review and it will not take place if the mission is
not convinced by the measures taken and implemented by Greece,”
Asmussen said in a speech prepared for delivery in Washington at
a KfW Group event. “Given the delay in the troika’s mission, I
do not see that the upcoming Eurogroup on Oct. 3 will decide on
the sixth tranche.”  Asmussen also said a date for a bond exchange to ensure
private-sector involvement in a new aid program for  Greece 
hasn’t been fixed yet, rejecting as “pure speculation” a
report that the exchange will take place in the middle of
October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
