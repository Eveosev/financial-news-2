Israel ’s benchmark government bond
climbed to the highest in two weeks on speculation the central
bank will hold borrowing costs tomorrow as growth falters.  The yield on the benchmark Mimshal Shiklit note due January
2020 fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 4.56
percent at 11:57 a.m. in  Tel Aviv , matching the level on Sept.
14. The  Bank of Israel  will maintain the benchmark lending rate
at 3.25 percent for a fourth month, according to 19 of 21
economists in a Bloomberg survey. Two predict Governor  Stanley Fischer  will lower the rate to 3 percent.  The central bank on Sept. 22 cut its growth forecasts to
4.7 percent in 2011 and 3.2 percent in 2012 from 4.8 percent and
3.9 percent, respectively, citing increased uncertainty about
the global economy and a decline in the rate of growth in world
trade. The bank’s staff forecast is for the benchmark interest
rate to fall to 3 percent from 3.25 percent in 12 months.  “The central bank will prefer to hold borrowing costs at
tomorrow’s meeting after the bank lowered its growth forecast
for the local economy,” Ori Greenfeld, an economist at Psagot
Investment House Ltd., said by telephone. “The market is
looking for direction today as there is uncertainty about the
global economic recovery and inflation prospects.”  Panel Recommendations  The two-year breakeven rate, which reflects market
expectations for inflation over the period, dropped for the
first time in six days, declining two basis points to 192,
implying an average annual inflation rate of 1.92 percent. The
yield on the CPI-linked bond due in June 2013 was little changed
at 1.14 percent.  A government-appointed panel on consumer prices may call
for cutting taxes on imports to help bring down food prices when
it makes its recommendations tomorrow, TheMarker reported today,
without saying where it got the information. The panel also may
call for the formation of a committee to help boost competition
in the banking sector, TheMarker said.  Two-year interest-rate swaps, an indicator of investor
expectations for  interest rates  in the next two years, retreated
one basis point to 2.93 percent on Sept. 23, the lowest in more
than a week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The yield
on the 5.5 percent bond due in January 2022 was little changed
at 4.75 percent.  The Tel Aviv Bond 40 Index, which measures inflation-linked
and fixed-rate corporate bonds, fell for a second day, slipping
less than 0.1 percent. The shekel gained 0.5 percent to 3.7032
against the dollar on Sept. 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
