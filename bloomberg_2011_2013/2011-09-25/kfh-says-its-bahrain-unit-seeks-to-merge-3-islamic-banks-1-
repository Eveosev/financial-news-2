Kuwait Finance House (KFIN) ’s unit in
Bahrain is leading efforts to merge three Islamic lenders into a
bank valued at $400 million, the Kuwait-based financial services
company said today.  The creation of the biggest Islamic bank in Bahrain and one
of the biggest in the region will “serve as a platform for
further merging operations in Bahrain and other markets in the
area,” Kuwait Finance said in an e-mailed statement, citing
KFH-Bahrain Chief Executive Officer Abdul Hakim al-Khayyat.  The banks to be merged will be named “in a few weeks”
when negotiations reach an advanced stage. The new Islamic bank
will have assets of $500 million and should take six to nine
months to form, Kuwait Finance said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
