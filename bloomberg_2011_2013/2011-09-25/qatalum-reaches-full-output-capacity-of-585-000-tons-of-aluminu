Qatalum, the joint venture smelter
of  Norsk Hydro ASA (NHY)  and  Qatar Petroleum , reached full production
capacity of 585,000 tons of aluminum on Sept. 21, the company
said in an e-mailed statement.  The owners of the Qatar-based plant said in June they
planned to reach full capacity by the end of the third quarter
after the target was pushed back from an initial January date.  To contact the reporter on this story:
