Greek Finance Minister Evangelos
Venizelos said his country will do “whatever it takes” to meet
its budget goals and cautioned against making  Greece  the
“scapegoat” of the global economy.  Venizelos, at an event in  Washington  today, pledged that
his country will always be a member of the euro area.  “Greece wants to make it and will make it,” he said.
“We are ready to take the necessary initiatives at any
political cost” to improve the economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
