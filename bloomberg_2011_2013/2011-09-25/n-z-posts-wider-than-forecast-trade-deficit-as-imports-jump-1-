New Zealand ’s trade deficit was
wider than economists forecast in August as purchases of fuel,
machinery and transport equipment boosted imports to the highest
since December 2008.  Imports exceeded exports by NZ$641 million ($496 million),
from a revised NZ$111 million surplus in July,  Statistics New
Zealand  said today in Wellington. Shipments abroad fell for a
fourth straight month. The median estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey of eight economists was for a NZ$321 million deficit.  New Zealand’s first trade shortfall in eight months shows
that signs of weaker global demand, lower commodity prices and
the end of the agricultural production season have curbed
exports, which make up 30 percent of gross domestic product.
Economists expect imports to expand over the next few years on
purchases of materials and equipment to rebuild the earthquake-
devastated South Island city of Christchurch.  “With the global economy looking progressively weaker, the
upshot is likely to be a further run of monthly trade
deficits,” said  Mark Smith , an economist at ANZ National Bank
Ltd. in Wellington.  The  New Zealand dollar  bought 77.74 U.S. cents as of 12:35
p.m. in Wellington from 77.30 cents before the data and little
changed from 77.66 cents on Sept. 23 in  New York . The currency
has dropped 7.5 percent against the  U.S. dollar  in the past
month.  Weaker Imports  Imports rose 15 percent in August from a year earlier to
NZ$4.08 billion. Economists predicted NZ$3.78 billion.  Imports were led higher by crude oil, mechanical machinery,
railway vehicles, sugar and electrical machinery, today’s report
showed. Crude oil imports gained 53 percent from August last
year after shipments rose by 102,000 metric tons.  Exports fell to NZ$3.44 billion, the lowest value since
January, today’s report showed. The result matched economists’
median expectation, according to the Bloomberg survey.  Exports dropped 27 percent in August from the year’s peak
in April, mirroring declines in the past two years, today’s
report showed. Still, they rose 10 percent from August 2010.  Dairy exports, which make up a fifth of overseas sales,
declined to NZ$567 million, the lowest since September 2010 as
the season for milk production ended. Dairy exports rose 14
percent from the year-earlier month. Overseas sales of meat,
crude oil and fruit also increased from the year earlier.  Commodity prices declined for a third month in August, down
1.2 percent from July, according to an index released Sept. 1
and calculated by ANZ  National Bank Ltd. (NBL)  From a year earlier,
the index jumped 22 percent.  New Zealand had a trade surplus of NZ$1.08 billion in the
12 months ended Aug. 31. The excess narrowed from a revised
NZ$1.3 billion in the year through July. Economists forecast a
12-month surplus of NZ$1.4 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
