Russia’s relations with western
nations won’t deteriorate if Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin 
becomes president again,  Dmitry Peskov , his spokesman, told
reporters today in Moscow.  “Saying relations are good and then will become bad isn’t
logical,” Peskov said.  Putin yesterday agreed to run for president in March 2012
after four years as prime minister. He served as president from
2000 to 2008, stepping down because of a constitutional
restriction to two consecutive terms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
