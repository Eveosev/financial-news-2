European Central Bank Governing
Council member Ewald Nowotny said today that he sees a
“tendency of downward revision of economic indicators.”  “The ECB always is in a position that we look at economic
developments and then we take our decisions,” Nowotny said
in an interview with Bloomberg News in  Washington .  Regarding lending, Nowotny said: “Banks do have enough
collateral so there is no perspective of a liquidity crunch.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
