Jonah Lomu, the leading try scorer
at Rugby World Cups, is in a stable condition after being
admitted to Auckland Hospital because of a kidney-related health
scare,  New Zealand ’s Herald on Sunday  reported .  The former All Blacks winger, who was diagnosed with
nephrotic syndrome in 1995 and had a kidney transplant nine
years later, is in the renal and liver transplant ward, the
newspaper said, citing the Auckland District Health Board.  “All I can say is my husband is stable and until we know
exactly what’s wrong, we are not prepared to comment,” the
Herald on Sunday cited Lomu’s wife, Nadene, as saying.  Lomu, who was the special guest at the World Cup opening
ceremony on Sept. 9, played 63 Tests for New Zealand and scored
37 tries, including a record 15 at the 1995 and 1999 World Cups.
All Blacks assistant coach Steve Hansen said at a news
conference today that the current squad wished Lomu, 36, a
“speedy recovery.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
