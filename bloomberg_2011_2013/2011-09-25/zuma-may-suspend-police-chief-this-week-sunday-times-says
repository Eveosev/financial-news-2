South African President  Jacob Zuma 
is expected to suspend National Police Commissioner Bheki Cele
this week over allegations of misconduct in the signing of
leases worth 1.7 billion rand ($209 million), the  Sunday Times
reported , citing two unnamed senior government sources.  Zuma’s office said last week Cele was served with a notice
of the intention to suspend him on Aug. 29 for his role in the
lease deals, the Johannesburg-based weekly newspaper said. A
report in July by public protector Thuli Madonsela concluded
that Cele and Minister of Public Works Gwen Mahlangu-Nkabinde
were guilty of “unlawful improper conduct and
maladministration.”  Cele’s spokeswoman, Nonkululeko Mbatha, didn’t answer phone
calls from Bloomberg News today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
