Ireland’s Finance Minister  Michael Noonan  said the deposit position of Irish banks covered by
government guarantee has “stabilized” and his nation hopes to
return to sovereign bond markets in 2013.  “I would hope they will put a toe in the water by next
summer to see what the possibilities are and how the pricing
would be,” Noonan said today in response to an audience
question following a speech to a banking conference in
 Washington . “It’s our intention to be back in the markets in
the middle of 2013.”  Noonan said the recent reductions in bond yields were a
“strong endorsement” of the cash-strapped government’s
policies and that data show the economy “has returned to
significant levels of growth, albeit with sharply divergent
sectoral trends.”  Ireland was forced to seek a rescue from the European Union
and the  International Monetary Fund  in November as a banking
crisis overwhelmed the government. The state hasn’t sold a
benchmark bond since August 2010.  Noonan said investor sentiment toward Ireland has improved
“noticeably,” and the nation will adopt “tough” budgets to
reduce its deficit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
