France  will meet its deficit-
reduction targets and maintains its 1.75 percent economic growth
forecast for 2011 and 2012, French Budget Minister Valerie
Pecresse said on the program Le Grand Jury on LCI television.  Pecresse reiterated government promises to reduce its
budget shortfall to 5.7 percent of output this year and 4.6
percent next year.  “We are prudent and realistic,” and “will keep our word
to reduce the deficit,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
