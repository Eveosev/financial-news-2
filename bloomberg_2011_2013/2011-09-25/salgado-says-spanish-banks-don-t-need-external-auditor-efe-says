Spanish Finance Minister Elena Salgado said Spanish banks don’t need an external auditor to
boost market confidence, EFE reported  The tests carried out by the Bank of  Spain  and the fact
that lenders have published their exposure to real estate in
detail should be enough to win back trust, Salgado said at a
press conference in Washington, according to the newswire.
Antonio Borges, the European director for the  International
Monetary Fund , suggested appointing an auditor as was done in
Ireland, EFE said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
