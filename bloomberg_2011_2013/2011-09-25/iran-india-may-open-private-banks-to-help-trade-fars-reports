Iranian and Indian private banks
may open branches in each other’s countries in the near future
to facilitate trade,  Fars  reported, citing Mehdi Nabizadeh,
Tehran’s ambassador to  New Delhi   Nabizadeh didn’t identify the banks, the state-run news
agency said. The news service also didn’t say if the moves were
intended to facilitate payments from  India  for oil imports from
Iran.  India cleared months of overdue debt to Iran earlier this
month when it paid the Persian Gulf country $5 billion for oil
shipments. Indian refiners said banks were unwilling to transfer
payments for oil purchases because of international sanctions
against Iran over the country’s nuclear program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
