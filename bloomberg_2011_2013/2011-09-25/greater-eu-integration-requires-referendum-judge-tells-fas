The chief justice of  Germany ’s top
court said the country’s constitution bars further steps toward
European Union integration unless they are approved in a
referendum, Frankfurt Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung reported.  The Federal Constitutional Court’s decision on the euro-
rescue earlier this month indicates that joint euro bonds might
be unconstitutional depending on how they are structured, the
newspaper cited court President Andreas Vosskuhle as saying in
an interview  The ruling means that under the existing constitution
Germany may not join a permanent mechanism that would require it
paying the bill for decisions made by other governments,
Vosskuhle told FAS.  -- Editors: James Kraus, Anthony Aarons  To contact the reporters on this story:
