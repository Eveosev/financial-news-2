Switzerland and Russia signed a
 memorandum of understanding  on financial matters, the Swiss
Finance Ministry said today in an e-mailed  statement  after a
meeting in  Washington  yesterday.  The memorandum “laid the foundation stone for intensive
dialog between the Federal Department of Finance and the Russian
Finance Ministry,” the ministry said.  The two nations also signed a protocol to amend a double
taxation agreement, the Swiss ministry said.  Russia’s authorities will be able to obtain some
information about money deposited by Russian nationals in Swiss
banks, Russian Economy Minister  Elvira Nabiullina  told reporters
in Moscow on Friday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
