Everton midfielder Ross Barkley is
a target for Premier League clubs Chelsea,  Manchester United  and
 Manchester City , who may all be prepared to pay a world record
fee for a teenager,  the Mail on Sunday reported .  Barkley, 17, may attract bids of 30 million pounds ($46.3
million), with Primera Liga soccer clubs Barcelona and Real
Madrid also monitoring the player, the newspaper said, without
citing anyone.  Everton will be reluctant to sell Barkley, though it may be
forced to accept a large bid because of its financial situation,
the Mail said. The Toffees sold striker  Wayne Rooney  to
Manchester United for 25.6 million pounds seven years ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
