Maridive & Oil Services SAE (MOIL) , an
Egyptian marine and oil support services company, tumbled to the
lowest level in more than two years after the price of oil
declined.  The shares of the Cairo-based company lost 8.7 percent to
$2, the lowest intraday level since February 2009, at 11:20 a.m.
in Cairo. That gave the company a market value of $614 million.
Egyptâ€™s benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  lost 1.1 percent.  Oil fell below $80 per barrel last week for the first time
since Aug. 9 amid concern the global economy is headed for
recession.  To contact the reporter on this story:
