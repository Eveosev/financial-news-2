Mark Cavendish  became the first
Briton to win the men’s cycling road race world title in 46
years after taking today’s event in a sprint finish.  The 26-year-old beat Australia’s Matt Goss and Germany’s
Andre Greipel in a bunch sprint at the end of the 266-kilometer
(165-mile) course near Copenhagen.  Cavendish, who won the green jersey for topping the points
competition at this year’s Tour de France, thanked his teammates
for setting up today’s victory.  “It’s been three years in the making and you just saw they
rode incredibly,” Cavendish told the British Broadcasting Corp.
“I’m just so proud.”  He was led through by Ian Stannard and Geraint Thomas in
the final stages, while world time trial silver medal winner
Bradley Wiggins was also among the eight-man British team.  The last Briton to take the title was Tom Simpson in 1965.  To contact the reporter on this story:
