U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer
 George Osborne  will press ahead with plans to introduce tax
reductions for investors in small high-tech start-ups after
getting approval from European competition authorities.  The European Commission endorsed a plan for the  Enterprise
Investment Scheme  to increase income-tax breaks to 30 percent
from 20 percent on investments made since April, when Osborne
proposed the measure in his annual budget. The program also
doubles the amount that can be invested to 1 million pounds
($1.5 million).  “These changes will give a bigger tax break for those who
take risks for jobs and growth,” Osborne said in a statement
released by his office today.  The concession will cost 100 million pounds a year, the
Treasury said. The program supported 1,800 projects and 500
million pounds of investments in the fiscal year that ended in
March 2009, the Treasury said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
