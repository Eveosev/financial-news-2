Europe  doesn’t have much time to
solve its crisis and policy makers should put aside their
differences and act for the “common good,” the head of the
International Monetary Fund’s European department Antonio Borges
said.  Policy makers “are too focused on their own particular
mandates,” Borges said in a panel debate in  Washington  today.
If “the downward spiral” continues the “consequences might be
quite devastating,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
