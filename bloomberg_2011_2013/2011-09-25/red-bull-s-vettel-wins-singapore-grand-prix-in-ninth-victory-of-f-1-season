Sebastian Vettel of  Red Bull  won
today’s Singapore Grand Prix to strengthen his grip on the
Formula One drivers’ title.  It was the ninth victory of the season for Vettel, from 14
races so far.  Jenson Button  of McLaren was second and  Mark
Webber  of Red Bull third.  Vettel could have clinched the drivers’ title today if his
main rivals had finished lower.  The next event, the 15th on the 19-race calendar, is the
Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka on Oct. 9.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
