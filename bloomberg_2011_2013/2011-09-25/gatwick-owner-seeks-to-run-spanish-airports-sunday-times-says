Global Infrastructure Partners,
which owns Gatwick and London City airports, has teamed up with
the owner of Charles de Gaulle airport and the insurer Allianz
SE to bid for Madrid and Barcelona airports, the Sunday Times
reported, without saying where it got the information.  The Spanish government is selling a contract to run the
airports as the country seeks to reduce its  budget deficit  and a
sale could raise nore than 5 billion euros ($6.74 billion), the
newspaper said. The next round of bids are due by the end of
October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
