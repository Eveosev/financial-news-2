Europe  staged a late comeback to
defeat the U.S. 15-13 and regain women’s golf’s Solheim Cup at
Killeen Castle, Ireland, today.  Suzann Pettersen rallied to defeat Michelle Wie on the
final green, Caroline Hedwall recovered to get a half-point
against Ryann O’Toole, and Azahara Munoz had a victory over
