The Philippines’ budget surplus
isn’t ideal if the government won’t be spending enough on roads,
schools and health care, President  Benigno Aquino  said in a
speech before Filipinos in Tokyo today.  The government had a surplus of 9.22 billion pesos in
August while state spending fell 8.1 percent in the first eight
months, according to a Sept. 22 report. Still, it’s better to
have excess than worry about lack of funds, Aquino said in his
speech posted on the government website. The president will be
in  Japan  until Sept. 28 for courtesy calls and to hold meetings
and briefings with investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
