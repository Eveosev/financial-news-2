The  New York Yankees  beat the Red
Sox 9-1 as a third straight loss cut Boston’s lead to one game
ahead of Tampa Bay in the American League wildcard race.  Derek Jeter hit a three-run home run to cap a six-run
second inning for the AL East champion Yankees, who played
before a record crowd of 49,556 in the Bronx.  Boston, which has lost 13 of its last 16, plays a
doubleheader in New York tomorrow before a season-ending three
game series at Baltimore.  Johnny Damon  hit a three run homer in the eighth inning to
help the Tampa Bay Rays beat the Toronto Blue Jays 6-2 and move
within a single game of capturing a postseason spot.  In the National League, the  St. Louis Cardinals  rallied in
the ninth inning to beat the Chicago Cubs 2-1 and pull to within
two games of the  Atlanta Braves  in the wildcard race. Atlanta
lost to the Washington Nationals 4-1.  The New York Mets beat the Philadelphia Phillies 2-1 and 6-
3 in a doubleheader, as the NL East champions’ losing streak
reached eight games, their longest in 11 years. The Milwaukee
Brewers beat the Florida Marlins 6-4, while the Pittsburgh
Pirates topped the Cincinnati Reds 4-3.  In other American League games, the Texas Rangers beat the
Seattle Mariners 7-3 a day after clinching the West division;
