The  New York Yankees  beat the
Boston  Red Sox  6-2 in the first game of a doubleheader.  Boston’s 18th defeat in 23 Major League Baseball games this
month follows a 9-1 loss to New York at Yankee Stadium
yesterday. Another defeat tonight, after Tampa Bay beat the
Toronto Blue Jays 5-2 today, will leave Boston and the Rays tied
in the chase for the American League’s wildcard berth.  The Red Sox are at the Baltimore Orioles for their last
three games of the regular season, while Tampa hosts the
Yankees, who reached the playoffs for the 16th time in 17 years
by clinching the AL East division title.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
