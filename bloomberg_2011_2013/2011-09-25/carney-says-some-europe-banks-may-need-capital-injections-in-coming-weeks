European banks need to move quickly
to shore up their capital, Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney 
said.  “Their banking system, it’s undercapitalized,” Carney
said in a televised interview with CTV News. “That may require
some injections, direct injections of capital to those banks in
the coming weeks.”  Carney also reiterated that  Europe ’s monetary union has
“flaws” that need to be fixed, and said 1 trillion euros
($1.35 trillion) may be needed to stem investor concerns about
the sovereign-debt crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
