told Journal du Dimanche in an interview, calling concern about
a run on the banks “preposterous.” He denied a report in the
newspaper yesterday that the Finance Ministry and French banks

capital, Journal du Dimanche reported. BNP shares rose 9.8

largest luxury goods company will own 98 percent of Bulgari SpA

a Sept. 23 statement through the Italian exchange. Shares fell
1.4 percent to 105.45 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
