Russian Finance Minister Alexei
Kudrin’s role in the government after the March 2012 election is
a question for his future “employer,” said  Dmitry Peskov ,
Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin ’s spokesman.  Kudrin said late yesterday he won’t serve in government if
President Dmitry Medvedev becomes the next prime minister.  Kudrin, a “professional with a capital letter,” never hid
his point of view on economic matters when it differed from
Putin’s or Medvedev’s and has a right to express his opinions,
Peskov said today at a United Russia forum in Moscow.  Medvedev, 46, backed Putin’s presidential bid yesterday,
ended speculation over whether he would seek a second term.  Presidential aide  Arkady Dvorkovich ’s comment via Twitter
Inc.’s website that “there is no reason to rejoice” is an
acceptable expression of opinion, although it wasn’t clearly
addressed to anyone or about any particular event, Peskov said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
