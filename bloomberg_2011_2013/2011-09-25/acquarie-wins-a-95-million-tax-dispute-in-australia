Macquarie Bank Ltd., a unit of
Australia’s biggest investment bank, won a A$95 million ($93
million) dispute with the Australian Tax Office over the 2004
sale of a stake in nickel producer  Minara Resources Ltd. (MRE)   Federal Court Justice Richard Edmonds in Sydney today
dismissed the tax office’s claim that Macquarie used a tax
avoidance scheme when it engineered the sale of 165.5 million
shares held by MatlinPatterson Global Opportunities Partners LP
at A$2.90 each.  The unit of the Sydney-based  Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG)  claimed
at a hearing in June that the government was attempting to
assess taxes against it on profit made by MatlinPatterson.  John Hurst, an outside spokesman for Macquarie, declined to
comment on the ruling.  MatlinPatterson, which was Minara’s second-biggest
shareholder, bought a 35.9 percent stake in 2003 in the mining
company as part of an attempt to take it over, according to
court documents. Macquarie arranged a “bought deal” in
February 2004 for the MatlinPatterson shares, purchasing them
for A$2.65 each and selling them on to institutions for A$2.90,
earning A$41.4 million on which the bank paid A$12 million in
taxes, according to the court papers.  The case is Macquarie Bank Ltd. v. Commissioner of Taxation.
