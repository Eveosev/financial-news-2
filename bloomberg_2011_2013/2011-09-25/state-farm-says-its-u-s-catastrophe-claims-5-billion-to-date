State Farm Mutual Automobile
Insurance Co. said it has paid $5 billion this year to repair,
rebuild and replace property damaged by flooding, tornadoes and
wildfires in the U.S., in what it expects to be one of its
busiest years.  Policyholders have filed more than 970,000 catastrophe
claims, the company said in a statement today. The claims donâ€™t
include the 11 to 12 million routine auto, home and business
ones it receives each year, the Bloomington, Illinois-based
insurer said.  State Farm said the $5 billion does include some residual
payments on natural disasters from previous years.  The closely held company is the largest U.S. home and car
insurer. Last month, State Farm reported it had received more
than 50,000 claims from home and car damage related to Hurricane
Irene.  To contact the reporter on this story:
