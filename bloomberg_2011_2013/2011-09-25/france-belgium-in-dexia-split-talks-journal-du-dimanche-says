French and Belgian government
officials are in talks on a possible split of  Dexia SA (DEXB) , Journal
du Dimanche said today, citing unnamed sources close to the
governments.  France’s Caisse des Depots et Consignations and the French
Treasury, both investors in the Franco-Belgian bank, met several
times last week to discuss the proposal, the paper said.  Bank of France Governor  Christian Noyer  said in an
interview with the newspaper that Dexia must continue to
restructure itself because its model is problematic.  Dexia Chief Executive Officer Pierre Mariani denied reports
of such a plan yesterday to Belgian newspaper De Tijd. Benoit
Gausseron, a Paris-based spokesman for the lender, didn’t
immediately return a message left on his mobile phone for
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
