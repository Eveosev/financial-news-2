Russian economic policy in the next
six years will be driven largely by global events, said Sergei
Naryshkin, President’s  Dmitry Medvedev ’s chief of staff.  Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who agreed yesterday to run
for president in the March 2012 election, set out a general
platform that will be followed in the next term, Naryshkin said
today at a forum for the ruling  United Russia  party.  “We don’t live in isolation,” Naryshkin said. “The
actions of the Russian leadership, the president, the government
will depend on very, very many circumstances, first of all the
conditions that form in the global economic situation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
