German  Chancellor Angela Merkel 
indicated that she’s being treated for high blood pressure,
saying the condition was discovered two decades ago when she
applied for a government job.  A medical exam related to her job application to the German
government’s press office “pointed out to me that I have to
watch my blood pressure a bit,” Merkel said in response to a
question by ARD television talk-show host Guenther Jauch in
Berlin late yesterday. “Since then, I’ve been getting good
medical treatment.”  While Merkel confirmed that elevated blood pressure led to
her rejection for the government job, she said she didn’t
challenge it because she won a seat in December 1990
parliamentary elections, the first after East and  West Germany 
reunited following the fall of the  Berlin Wall  in 1989.  Merkel, who was raised under communism in former East
Germany, said she applied for the job after acting as
spokeswoman for Lothar de Maiziere, the premier who emerged from
the country’s first and last free elections earlier in 1990.  To contact the reporter on this story:
