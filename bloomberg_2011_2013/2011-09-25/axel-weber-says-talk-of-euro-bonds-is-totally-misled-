Axel Weber, the former president of
the Bundesbank, said talk of joint euro region bond sales is
“totally misled” as euro region governments would be allowed
to take their own taxation and spending decisions while shifting
the burden of dealing with the consequences to the bloc as a
whole. It “just prolongs the pain” in countries that have to
reduce excessive debt, which is at “the root of the problem,”
he said.  Weber made his comments in  Washington  today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
