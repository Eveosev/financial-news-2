Finance Minister  Michael Noonan 
said the deposit position of the Irish banks covered by
government guarantee has “stabilized” and that investor
confidence in his economy has “improved noticeably.”   “Since the end of June, retail deposits are up while
corporate deposits are pretty flat,” Noonan said in a speech to
a banking conference in Washington today. “I’m informed that
August and September have been fairly good months for flows
within the banking system, which is reassuring given it was a
period of great strain for European and international markets.”  Noonan said the recent reduction in bond yields were a
“strong endorsement” of the cash-strapped government’s policies
and that data show the economy “has returned to significant
levels of growth, albeit with sharply divergent sectoral trends.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
