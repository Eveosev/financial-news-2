Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  said the European Union and international community
have been slow and divided in their reaction to the sovereign
debt crisis and decisions were needed now to shield European
countries from future such crises.  “Today, the global economic situation is becoming even
more fragile and the end of the crisis appears even more
distant,” Papandreou said in a written address to the Socialist
International group, according to a transcript from his Athens-
based office.  Resolving the issue of Greek debt, which represents just 3
percent of public debt in the euro area, isn’t enough to deal
with the wider consequences and roots of the problems in  Europe ,
he said. “There is a pressing need for strategic decisions
which will shield EU member states from future such crises,” he
said.  That requires radical institutional changes which will
gradually lead to deeper fiscal, economic and political union,
he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
