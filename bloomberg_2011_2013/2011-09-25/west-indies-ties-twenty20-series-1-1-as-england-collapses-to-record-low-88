West Indies beat  England  by 25 runs
to tie their Twenty20 series after the home team slumped to its
lowest score in cricket’s shortest format.  Spin bowler Garey Mathurin took three wickets for nine runs
in four overs as England, chasing 114 runs to clinch a 2-0
series win, was bowled out for 88 at the Oval last night.  England’s collapse came after it restricted West Indies to
113-5 -- the lowest score batting first in a Twenty20
international at the south London ground -- as Graeme Swann’s
team sought to follow up its 10-wicket win in the first match.  “I thought we did everything right for half the game and
everything wrong for the other half,” Swann said at the
presentation ceremony. “It was one of those nights when we just
panicked. It must be pressure.”  The match was England’s last in a home international
campaign in which it beat  Sri Lanka  and  India  to become the  No.
1-ranked  Test team. England next plays five one-day matches and
a Twenty20 game in India starting Oct. 14.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
