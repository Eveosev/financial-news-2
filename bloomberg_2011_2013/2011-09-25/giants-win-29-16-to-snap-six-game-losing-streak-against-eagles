The  New York Giants  won 29-16 to
snap a six-game losing streak against the Philadelphia Eagles.  Eagles quarterback  Michael Vick  left the game in the fourth
quarter with what game broadcaster Fox said was a fracture in
his right hand. Vick went for an X-ray on his non-throwing hand
at the end of the third quarter of the game at Lincoln Financial
Field in Philadelphia.  The Giants improve to 2-1 and the Eagles drop to 1-2 in the
National Football League.  Philadelphiaâ€™s unbeaten run against its National Football
Conference East division rival was its longest since a 12-game
streak from 1975-81.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
