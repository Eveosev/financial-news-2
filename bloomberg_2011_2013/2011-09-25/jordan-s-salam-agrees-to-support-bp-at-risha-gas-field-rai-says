Jordan’s  Salam International
Transport & Trading (SITT)  signed two agreements with  BP Plc (BP/)  to provide
logistical services for the British company at the Al Risha gas
field,  Al Rai  reported.  The contracts will last for three years each, the newspaper
said, citing Ghaleb Shalan, the Amman-based company’s chairman.
BP agreed in October 2009 to join Jordan’s National Petroleum
Co. to explore and develop the Risha field near the Iraqi
border. BP is to spend $237 million to increase output there
within three to four years, according to information compiled by
Bloomberg. Jordan imports most of its energy needs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
