Some Chinese developers face
bankruptcy in coming months as the government tightens control
on loans obtained from  trust companies  and sales slow, UBS AG
said.  Stricter controls on trust loans will add further financing
pressure for developers,  Wang Tao , a Hong Kong-based economist
at UBS, wrote in a report dated Sept. 23. “As property sales
weaken in the coming months, we think it is likely that some
developers, likely small and medium-sized ones with an over-
extended balance sheet, will face financial difficulties and may
go bankrupt.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
