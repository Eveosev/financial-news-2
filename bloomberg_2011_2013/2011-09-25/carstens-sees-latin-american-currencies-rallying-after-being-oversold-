Mexican central bank Governor
Agustin Carstens said the peso’s weakness is “transitory” and
the currency is likely to resume its upward trend, along with
other Latin American currencies.  Carstens met with central bank chiefs from  Latin America  in
 Washington  this week, where he’s attending the meetings of the
 International Monetary Fund , and said there was a consensus that
the recent selloff in the region’s assets would prove short-
lived.  “We think that our currencies have been oversold, and it’s
very probable there will be an important correction in the next
days,” Carstens told reporters in Washington today.  The Mexican currency appreciated 3.9 percent against the
dollar to 13.5600 on Sept. 23, after falling for 11 consecutive
days as investors dumped emerging market assets on concern
prospects for the global growth were worsening. Carstens said
the decline had nothing to do with  Mexico  itself, which has a
solid fiscal position and a sound banking system.  The peso has dropped 13.5 percent since the end of July,
the second-biggest fall of 7 major Latin American currencies
tracked by Bloomberg after the Brazilian real. The peso is
“clearly undervalued,” Carstens said in a Sept. 23 interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
