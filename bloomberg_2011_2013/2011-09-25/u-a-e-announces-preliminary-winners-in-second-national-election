The  United Arab Emirates  released a
preliminary list of winners for seats on a government advisory
council after citizens voted for the second time in the
country’s 40-year history.  Fewer than 28 percent of the 130,000 citizens entitled to
participate in yesterday’s vote for candidates to the Federal
National Council actually cast ballots, the National Election
Committee said in an e-mailed statement. The poll was held to
select half of the council’s 40 members. The other 20 seats are
chosen by rulers of the nation’s seven emirates.  The final list of winners will be announced on Sept. 28,
the statement said today. The U.A.E., founded in 1971 by the
late President Sheikh Zayed  Al Nahyan , held its first election
for the council in 2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
