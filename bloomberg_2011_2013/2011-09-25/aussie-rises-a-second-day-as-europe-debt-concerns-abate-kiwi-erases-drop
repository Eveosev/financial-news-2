New Zealand ’s currency fell to the
weakest in six months against the yen after a report showed the
country’s trade deficit was wider than estimated, adding to
signs of a slowdown in the South Pacific nation.  The kiwi, as the currency is nicknamed, dropped for a sixth
day against its U.S. counterpart, the longest losing streak
since September 2008. The Australian dollar slid to a nine-month
low against the greenback as investors sought safety on concern
European officials may fail to forestall a spiraling sovereign-
debt crisis.  “For both Aussie and kiwi, the bias is lower,” said
 Thomas Harr , head of Asian currency strategy at Standard
Chartered Plc in Singapore. “Aussie and kiwi are derivative of
global growth expectations and thereby also a lot of these
concerns, and it doesn’t seem to be going away any time soon.”  The  New Zealand dollar  dropped as much as 2 percent to
58.27 yen, the weakest since March 18, before trading at 59.01
yen at 1:22 p.m. in  New York , down 0.9 percent from 59.46 on
Sept. 23. It fell 0.6 percent to 77.19 U.S. cents, from 77.66
cents, after earlier touching 76.38 cents, the lowest level
since April 1.  The Australian dollar declined 0.6 percent to 97.25 U.S.
cents, from 97.79 cents at the end of last week. It earlier
touched 96.22 cents, the least since Dec. 1. The Aussie slumped
0.8 percent to 74.31 yen after falling to 73.39 yen, the weakest
level since July 6, 2010.  ‘Tough Times’  New Zealand’s imports exceeded exports by NZ$641 million
($492 million) in August,  Statistics New Zealand  said today.
That’s almost double the NZ$321 million median forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey of economists. Shipments abroad fell for a
fourth straight month.  New Zealand isn’t immune from the financial problems
affecting the U.S. and  Europe , and both regions are facing
“tough times,” Prime Minister John Key told reporters in
Wellington today. In an earlier interview with  Television New
Zealand  he said a weaker currency will help the export sector.  The euro dropped to a decade low against the yen after
finance ministers and central bankers who held weekend talks in
Washington urged European officials to intensify efforts to
contain their 18-month debt crisis as Greece teetered on the
edge of default.  To contact the reporters on this story:
