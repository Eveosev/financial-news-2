Greek Finance Minister Evangelos
Venizelos said today his country is not the euro area’s central
problem and that additional measures are needed to meet  Greece ’s
budget targets.  “Greece is not the euro area’s central problem, nor can it
be the catalyst” for a financial crisis, Venizelos said at an
event in  Washington  today. Greece “is not capable of causing a
domino effect of pan-European dimensions.”  Venizelos added: “The IMF is expected to extend the
maturity of the Greek loans to allow for a longer time” for the
lending to boost competitiveness.  To contact the reporter on this story:
