South Korea ’s energy demand may rise
3 percent this year, the slowest pace since 2009, as an economic
slowdown curbs consumption growth, the state energy policy
adviser said.  Asia ’s fourth-largest economy may use 279.6 million metric
tons of oil equivalent in 2012, compared with 271.4 million last
year, the  Korea Energy Economics Institute  said in a statement
today. Gross domestic product growth may slow to 3.7 percent,
from an estimated 3.8 percent last year, the institute said.  Demand for crude may rise 0.7 percent to 803.5 million
barrels and liquefied natural gas consumption may increase 5
percent to 38.2 million tons, the institute said. The use of
coal may gain 2 percent to 125.4 million tons, while demand for
nuclear power may increase 9.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
