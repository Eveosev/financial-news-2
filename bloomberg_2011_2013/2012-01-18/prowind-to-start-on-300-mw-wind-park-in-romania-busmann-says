Prowind GmbH, a German wind farm
developer, plans to start work on a 300 megawatt wind park in
 Romania  this summer, with plans to complete it by the end of
next year, managing director Johannes Busmann said.  Prowind, which is developing the wind farm in northeastern
Romania with General Electric Co., is looking for an investor to
buy the project, Busmann said in an interview in Bucharest
today. the company is also willing to keep a share in it
depending on the discussions, he said.  “We cannot operate this project on our own and that’s why
we are looking for an international investor,” Busmann said.
“We are negotiating with both new investors in Romania and with
the ones that are already present on the market.”  Prowind had planned to build a total of 760 megawatts of
 wind energy  in the Balkan nation, according to Busmann. “The
rest of 460 megawatts are uncertain because of the capacity to
connect them to the country’s power grid.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
