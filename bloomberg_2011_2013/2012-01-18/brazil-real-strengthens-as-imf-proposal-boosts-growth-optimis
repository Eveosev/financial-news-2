(Corrects proposed lending resources in third paragraph.)  Brazil ’s real gained after a report
that the  International Monetary Fund  is seeking to expand
lending resources to insulate the global economy from the
European debt crisis boosted demand for higher-yielding assets.  The real rose 0.4 percent to 1.7779 per U.S. dollar at 9:32
a.m. in  Sao Paulo , from 1.7873 yesterday.  The real strengthened with most other major and emerging-
market currencies following a report that the IMF is proposing a
$500 billion expansion of its lending resources to insulate the
global economy against any worsening of Europe’s debt crisis,
according to an official at a Group of 20 nation.  “The main news today is that the IMF is considering
increasing its rescue fund,”  Luciano Rostagno , chief strategist
at Banco West LB in Sao Paulo, said in a telephone interview.
“This helps reduce worry about a breakdown in Europe.”  Yields on the Brazilian interest-rate futures contract due
in January 2013 fell four basis points, or 0.04 percentage
point, to 10.02 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
