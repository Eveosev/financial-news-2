The euro pared gains versus the
dollar and yen amid reports that  Fitch Ratings  may cut  Italy ’s
credit rating by two levels by the end of January.  The 17-nation euro was within one yen of a 11-year low
against Japan’s currency. Fitch lowered the outlook on France’s
AAA credit rating last month and put countries including Spain
and Italy on review for downgrades, citing Europe’s failure to
find a “comprehensive solution” to the debt crisis. The cuts
for Italy may come by the end of the month, news agency Ansa
reported today, citing Alessandro Settepani, a senior Fitch
director, who spoke at a conference in Milan.  “There seems to be a reaction to the Fitch headline saying
the downgrade of Italy is an option,” and that is hurting the
euro, said  Chris Walker , a currency strategist at UBS AG in
London. “It is clearly a bit of an overreaction since these
cuts have been well flagged.”  The euro traded at 97.82 yen at 8:52 a.m. in London from
97.85 yen yesterday in  New York , after earlier rising as high as
98.24. The common currency fell to 97.04 yen on Jan. 16, the
weakest level since December 2000. The euro was at $1.2754 from
$1.2736. The dollar depreciated to 76.71 yen from 76.83 yen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
