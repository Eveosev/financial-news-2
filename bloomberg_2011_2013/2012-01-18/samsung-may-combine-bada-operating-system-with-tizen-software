Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , the world’s
largest smartphone maker, said it may combine its Bada mobile-
phone operating system with the Intel Corp.-backed Tizen
software under development.  “We are carefully looking at it as an option to make the
platforms serve better,” Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung said
in a statement today.  The comments follow a Forbes  report  that said efforts to
merge  Bada  with the open-source Tizen operating system are under
way, citing Tae-Jin Kang, senior vice president of Samsung’s
content-planning team. Tizen will support mobile applications
written with Bada’s software after the integration, the magazine
reported on its website.  Samsung, the biggest seller of mobile devices running
 Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s open-source Android software, uses Bada in some of
its lower-end smartphones.  Executives from companies including  Intel Corp. (INTC) , Samsung,
NTT DoCoMo Inc. and Vodafone Group Plc formed the  Tizen
association  on Jan. 1 to support development of the open-source
software. The software development groups LiMo Foundation and
Linux Foundation  said  in September they will jointly develop
Tizen for use in a range of devices from mobile phones to
televisions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
