Tullow Oil Plc (TLW) , the U.K. explorer
that operates  Ghana â€™s Jubilee oil field, fell to the lowest on
record in Accra after delaying the ramp up of production at the
site.  The stock fell 1 cedi, or 3.2 percent, to 30 cedis by the 3
p.m. close in the capital, the lowest since Aug. 3 when the
shares started trading on the Ghana Stock Exchange.  Jubilee production will average 90,000 barrels a day this
year, Tullow said in a statement, pushing peak production of
120,000 barrels that was expected this year to 2013.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
