Coffee shipments from  Uganda ,
 Africa ’s biggest exporter of the crop, may increase 6.9 percent
from a year earlier to 230,000 bags this month, the Uganda
Coffee Development Authority said.  Exports will probably be lower than the 242,301 bags
shipped in December because of the easing harvest, the Kampala-
based authority said in a report, details of which were provided
by phone today.  Uganda was Africa’s biggest coffee exporter and the world’s
ninth in the 12 months through September, according to the
London-based International Coffee Organization. Robusta beans,
which are used in espressos and instant drinks, account for
about 85 percent production, according to the Ugandan authority.  Exports from October to December, the first three months of
the season, declined 1.1 percent from a year earlier to 684,763
60-kilogram (132-pound) bags, according to a tally of the
authority’s figure compiled by Bloomberg News.  The country’s coffee exports in the 12 months through
September may rise to 3.3 million bags, from 3.15 million bags
in 2010-11, because of a bigger crop, the authority said on Oct.
10 without providing production forecasts. Exports in 2010-11
were worth $449 million, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
