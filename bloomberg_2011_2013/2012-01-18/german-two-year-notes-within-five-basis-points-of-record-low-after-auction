German two-year note yields were
within five basis points of a record low after borrowing costs
fell and demand rose at a sale of 3.4 billion euros ($4.4
billion) of the securities.  The two-year note yielded 0.18 percent at 10:56 a.m. London
time. It slid to its record low of 0.134 percent on Jan. 12.  Ten-year bunds declined, pushing the yield two basis points
higher to 1.81 percent.  Germany  got bids for 7.596 billion euros of two-year notes
at the sale, compared with a maximum sales target of 4 billion
euros, the Bundesbank said in a statement. The 0.25 percent
notes maturing in December 2013 were sold at an average yield of
0.17 percent compared to 0.29 percent when the securities were
sold on Dec. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
