The rupiah and  government bonds 
rallied on optimism inflows will increase after  Indonesia  was
awarded investment-grade status by Moody’s Investors Service.  The country’s foreign- and local-currency rating was
increased to Baa3, Moody’s lowest investment-grade level, the
company said in a statement released around 2:30 p.m. in Jakarta.
The rating has a stable outlook.  Fitch Ratings  raised Indonesia
to investment grade in December. Overseas investors bought $228
million more Indonesian shares than they sold this year through
yesterday, exchange data show.  “Now that Moody’s and Fitch have upgraded Indonesia, it
means more overseas funds will flow into the country,” said
Wiling Bolung, head of treasury at ANZ Panin Bank in Jakarta.
“There should be more demand for the currency and bonds.”  The rupiah gained 0.3 percent to 9,060 per dollar as of
3:59 p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency dropped as much as 1.3
percent earlier and was down 1 percent shortly before the
announcement by Moody’s. The benchmark share index rallied 0.4
percent after losing as much as 0.2 percent earlier.  Foreign ownership of government debt rose 14 percent last
year to 222.86 trillion rupiah ($24.6 billion), according to
finance ministry data. Holdings reached 222.93 trillion rupiah
as of yesterday.  Bank Indonesia  will buy more longer-term
government bonds as yields on short- and mid-term maturities
have stabilized, Governor Darmin Nasution said in Jakarta today.  Bond Yields Drop  The yield on the 4.875 percent bonds due 2021 fell six
basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 3.98 percent,
according to prices from Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.  Bank Indonesia widened the lower range of its interbank
lending rate yesterday in an effective easing of monetary policy.
The central bank said it would extend the bottom end of its
deposit facility to 200 basis points below its benchmark
interest rate from 150 basis points effective today. The central
bank held its  reference rate  at 6 percent on Jan. 12, as
predicted by 13 of 18 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.
Five forecast a 25 basis-point cut.  To contact the reporter on this story:
