US Bancorp (USB) ’s U.S. Bank National
Association sued a group of Nesbitt companies that own eight
Embassy Hotels in the U.S. over claims they defaulted on a
$187.5 million loan.  The loan, made by Greenwich Capital Financial Products to
Nesbitt in 2006, was assigned to U.S. Bank in January 2011 and
was in default by February, according to a complaint filed today
in federal court in  New York . Nesbitt owes $175 million in
principal plus interest, the plaintiffs said.  “Each of the eight hotels are being required by the
franchisor to undergo improvements for which defendants lack the
adequate funds to undertake,” the complaint states.  The hotels are in Bellevue, Washington; Blue Ash,  Ohio ;
Colorado Springs, Colorado; Denver; Livonia, Michigan; Lynwood,
Washington; Tigard, Oregon, and El Paso, Texas.  U.S. Bank asked the court to appoint a receiver to take
possession of the hotels. The Nesbitt companies are accused of
breach of contract.  Windsor Management Services, led by Patrick Nesbitt, is the
owner of the Embassy Suite Hotels named in the suit, according
to Windsor’s website. Bill Upshaw, Windsor’s chief operating
officer, didn’t immediately return a call seeking comment on the
suit.  The case is U.S. Bank National Association v. Nesbitt
Bellevue Property LLC, 12-0423, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
