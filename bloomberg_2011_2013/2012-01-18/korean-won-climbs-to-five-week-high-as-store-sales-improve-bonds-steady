South Korea ’s won rose to a five-
week high as data indicated demand is strengthening at home and
a U.S. manufacturing report brightened the outlook for exports.
 Government bonds  rose.  Sales (KODSDEPT)  at major South Korean department stores increased 11
percent from a year earlier in December, the most in eight
months, the Ministry of  Knowledge Economy  said today. Factory
output in the New York region expanded in January at the fastest
pace since April, a report yesterday showed. Spain’s borrowing
costs fell at a debt auction yesterday, damping concern Europe’s
debt crisis will worsen.  “Positive economic data in several countries are
supporting the won but gains are limited as importers demand
dollars to settle bills,” said Lee Jung Hyun, a Seoul-based
currency dealer at Industrial Bank of  Korea . “Positive
sentiment was already reflected in the won’s price and the
ongoing European crisis is also limiting the currency’s rally.”  The won strengthened 0.3 percent to 1,141.75 per dollar in
Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched
1,140.33 earlier, the highest since Dec. 12. Overseas investors
bought more South Korean shares than they sold for a seventh day,
building on net purchases of $1.35 billion this month through
yesterday, exchange data shows.  The yield on South Korea’s 3.5 percent bonds due September
2016 fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.49
percent, according to Korea Exchange Inc. prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
