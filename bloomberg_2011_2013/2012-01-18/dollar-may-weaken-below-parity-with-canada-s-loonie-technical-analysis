The dollar may weaken below parity
with the Canadian currency should it breach a key level of so-
called support, Commerzbank AG said, citing trading patterns.  The currency is nearing C$1.0052, the December low,  Axel Rudolph , a senior technical analyst at Commerzbank in London,
wrote today in a note to clients. This support level “is thus
still expected to give way with the 200-day moving average and
the October low at C$0.9932 and C$0.9892 then being back in
sight,” he wrote.  The dollar weakened 0.2 percent to C$1.0130 at 6:26 a.m. in
New York extending its decline in the past month to 2.4 percent.
The U.S. currency last traded at parity with the so-called
loonie on Nov. 1, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  exchange rate  may return to parity “within the next
month or so,” Rudolph wrote in an e-mail confirming the report.  Support refers to a level where analysts anticipate orders
to buy a currency and its related instruments. The stronger the
support, the more selling is needed to drop below that level.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
