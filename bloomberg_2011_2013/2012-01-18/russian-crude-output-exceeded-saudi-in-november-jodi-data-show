Russia ’s crude oil production rose
to 10.422 million barrels a day in November, exceeding  Saudi
Arabia  by 375,000 barrels a day, according to the Joint
Organization Data Initiative.  The November rate was the most since the late 1980s.
Russian output peaked at 11.48 million barrels a day in 1987
during the Soviet era, annual estimates by BP Plc show.  Russia, which had already replaced Saudi Arabia as the
world’s largest crude-producing nation, increased output during
the month from 10.35 million barrels a day in October, data
compiled by the initiative, or JODI, show. Saudi Arabia pumped
10.047 million barrels a day in November, the highest level in
three decades.  The JODI estimate for Russia is higher than figures
supplied by the Energy Ministry’s CDU-TEK unit, which said on
Jan. 2 that Russia pumped 10.35 million barrels a day in
November and 10.32 million in December.  JODI, supervised by the Riyadh-based  International Energy
Forum , said Russian production is calculated from data the
country submitted to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum
and compared with information from four other sources.  Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  has called for oil output,
Russia’s largest source of tax income, to remain above 10
million barrels for at least the next decade. Putin lowered the
 tax  rate on crude exports on Oct. 1 to spur investment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
