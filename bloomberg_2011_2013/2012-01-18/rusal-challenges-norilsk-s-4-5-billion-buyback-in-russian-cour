United Co. Rusal (486) , the world’s
largest aluminum producer, filed a claim in a court in  Russia ’s
Krasnoyarsk region challenging a $4.5 billion share buyback by
OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel.  The aluminum company wants the court to annul decisions by
Norilsk’s board on Sept. 13 and Sept. 21, a  statement  on the
court’s website shows. Norilsk’s board approved the start of the
buyback by unit Norilsk Nickel Investment Ltd. at these
meetings.  Norilsk completed the buyback in November, during which it
acquired 7.7 percent of the company from shareholders.
Billionaire Oleg Deripaska’s Rusal, which holds 25 percent of
Norilsk, opposed the deal, saying the program favored  Vladimir Potanin ’s Interros Holding Co., which controlled about 30
percent of the nickel producer before the buyback.  Rusal’s press-office confirmed that it filed the case,
without making any further comment.  “Norilsk does all its corporate procedures in accordance
with best practices,” Alisa Fialko, a Norilsk spokeswoman, said
by e-mail. “There is no way that the company breached any
rights of its shareholders.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
