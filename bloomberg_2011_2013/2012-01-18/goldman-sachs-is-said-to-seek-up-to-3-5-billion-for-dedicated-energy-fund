Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  is seeking
$2 billion to $3.5 billion for its first dedicated energy
private-equity fund, according to two prospective investors.  The fund, Broad Street Energy Partners, will invest
globally in areas such as oil, gas and power, said the
investors, who asked not to be named because the information is
private.  Goldman Sachs joins a growing lineup of firms raising pools
of capital to take advantage of increased demand for energy and
commodities. Barclays Natural Resource Investments, a unit of
 Barclays Capital , is raising its first dedicated private-equity
energy fund to make investments globally.  Blackstone Group LP (BX) ,
the largest private-equity firm, and  Apollo Global Management (APO) 
are also marketing debut energy funds.  Andrea Raphael, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, declined
to comment.  The new fund will be managed by the principal investment
team of the bank. Kenneth Pontarelli, head of natural resources
and a managing director in the merchant-banking division at
Goldman Sachs, is heading the effort, according to the
investors.  The Goldman Sachs merchant-banking division has made energy
private-equity investments in the past out of its global
private-equity funds, and Pontarelli managed those energy deals.  Past energy deals by  GS Capital Partners (PEF3383)  included the $45
billion buyout of electric utility company  TXU (TXU) , now called
Energy Future Holdings Corp.,  Cobalt International Energy Inc. (CIE) 
and Kinder Morgan Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
