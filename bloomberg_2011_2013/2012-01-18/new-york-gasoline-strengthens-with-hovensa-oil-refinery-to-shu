New York  gasoline gained after
Hovensa LLC announced it will shut the St. Croix refinery in the
 U.S. Virgin Islands  because of weak demand.  Hovensa, a partnership of Hess Corp. and Petroleos de
Venezuela SA, said it will shut the plant by mid-February and
convert it into an oil storage terminal. The refinery supplied
2.7 percent of U.S. East Coast gasoline demand in October.  The discount for conventional gasoline to be blended with
ethanol, or CBOB, in New York Harbor, narrowed 0.53 cent to 0.75
cent a gallon versus futures traded at 12:43 p.m. on the New
York Mercantile Exchange, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Prompt delivery rose 4.52 cents to $2.8038.  The 350,000-barrel-a-day refinery provided 83,000 barrels a
day of gasoline and 47,000 barrels of distillate in October to
the U.S. East Coast, according to the Energy Department.  Regular gasoline in the  Gulf Coast (MOSGC87P)  narrowed 0.7 cent to a
discount versus futures of 1.5 cents a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
