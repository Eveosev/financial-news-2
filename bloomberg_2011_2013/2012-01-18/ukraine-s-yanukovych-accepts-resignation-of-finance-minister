Ukraine’s Finance Minister Fedir
Yaroshenko resigned as the former Soviet republic seeks to
bolster its public finances after talks to resume a $15.6
billion international bailout loan stalled.  Yaroshenko, 62, said he decided to step down after
consulting with Prime Minister  Mykola Azarov , according to
comments posted today on President  Viktor Yanukovych ’s website.
The official, who was appointed in March 2010 after Yanukovych
won office, didn’t give a reason for his departure.  Ukraine’s current-account deficit has widened on increased
natural-gas imports, according to the central bank, which has
tapped reserves to support the hryvnia. A 2010 bailout loan from
the  International Monetary Fund  has been frozen since last March
because the government didn’t raise household gas tariffs, a
step the lender has demanded to trim losses at the state-owned
energy company. Ukraine wants cheaper gas from  Russia  instead.  Yaroshenko’s exit probably reflects “broader stresses” in
the economy, Tim Ash, head of emerging-market research at Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc in  London , said by e-mail. The
government is battling “against declining popular support, a
weakening budget and external financing position set against a
break in relations with the  IMF  and problems in closing an
agreement to deliver cheap gas from Russia.”  Bonds, Swaps  The yield on the government’s dollar bonds maturing June
2016 rose to 11.432 percent from 11.324 yesterday and 6.718 when
they began trading July 18, 2011, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Credit-default swaps that insure the country’s debt
against non-payment have jumped 74.77 basis points this year to
930 points on Jan. 18, according to data provider CMA.  Ukraine’s current-account deficit widened to $8.75 billion
in the first 11 months of last year compared with $2.13 billion
in the same period of 2010, the central bank said Jan. 4. Gold
and foreign-exchange reserves shrank to $30.4 billion at the end
of 2011 from $38.2 billion in August as the regulator supported
the hryvnia. The currency slid to 8.0494 per dollar at 3:23 p.m.
today in the capital, Kiev, from 8.0252 yesterday.  Yaroshenko’s resignation won’t weaken the government’s
ability to borrow and service its debt, Alexander Valchyshen,
head of research at Investment Capital Ukraine in Kiev, said by
e-mail.  The government faces $8.2 billion in debt payments in 2012.  Economy to Slow  Ukraine’s economy grew 5.2 percent in 2011, the fastest
pace since 2007, helped by a good harvest and exports, Azarov
said yesterday. Growth may slow to 3.9 percent this year, the
government forecasts. Erste Group Bank AG said Jan. 17 the rate
may be as low as 1 percent as export demand wanes.  Ukraine’s budget deficit reached 4.3 percent of gross
domestic product in 2011, swelled by a 20.6 billion-hryvnia
($2.6 billion) shortfall at state energy company NAK Naftogaz
Ukrainy and measures to recapitalize banks, according to the
 Finance Ministry . Excluding those effects, the gap was 2.7
percent, the ministry said Jan. 14 on its website.  Talks with Russia over cheaper natural-gas imports failed
to make a breakthrough yesterday, with negotiations to continue
at an unspecified date, Russia’s gas export monopoly OAO Gazprom
said.  Yanukovych wants gas costs cut to $250 per 1,000 cubic
meters from $400 in the fourth quarter to avoid implementing the
35 percent increase in household gas tariffs sought by the IMF,
which risks alienating voters. His ruling Party of Regions faces
parliamentary elections in October.  To contact the reporters on this story:
