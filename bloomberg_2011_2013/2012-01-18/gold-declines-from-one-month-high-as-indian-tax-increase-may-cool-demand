Gold rose for a third day, climbing
alongside other commodities including copper, as the dollar
weakened before data forecast to show signs of economic recovery.  Spot gold gained as much as 0.4 percent to $1,658.45 an
ounce and traded at $1,654.48 at 1:40 p.m. in Singapore. The
metal climbed to $1,667.90 yesterday, the highest since Dec. 13
and an increase of 6.7 percent this year. February-delivery
bullion was little changed at $1,655.20 on the Comex in New York.  The dollar dropped against most of its major counterparts
before U.S. industrial production and homebuilder confidence
data. It fell for a second day against the euro after a hedge-
fund manager on a creditors’ committee for  Greece  said the
country is nearing a deal on its debt. Greek Minister Prime
Lucas Papademos will resume talks with private bondholders today.  “Safe-haven investments have flowed into the dollar rather
than gold over the past few months, with gold being led by other
commodities, especially the industrial metals,” Qu Ying, an
analyst at Zhongzhou Futures Co., said from Shandong. “There
isn’t much impetus to drive gold past the $1,550 to $1,700 range
so you’ll get investors taking profits when prices climb and
entering the market when they drop.”  Global holdings in  exchange-traded products  backed by the
metal rose to a four-week high of 2,360.757 metric tons
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A report
yesterday showed manufacturing in the  New York  region expanded
in January at the fastest pace in nine months, while German
investor confidence advanced to the most on record in January,
helping to send copper prices up for a third day today.  Indian Taxes  Cash gold earlier fell 0.4 percent amid concern demand in
 India , the world’s biggest consumer, may cool after  import
duties  were raised. India raised the tax on imports of gold bars
and coins to 2 percent while silver now attracts a 6 percent
duty, the  finance ministry  said yesterday.  Overseas purchases of gold were taxed at 300 rupees ($5.9)
per 10 grams and of silver at 1,500 rupees a kilogram previously.
The increase means that gold importers may now pay about 540
rupees per 10 grams, said  Prithviraj Kothari , president of the
Bombay Bullion Association.  Imports by India were already poised to drop 48 percent in
the first quarter as a decline in the rupee boosts prices and
high borrowing costs cool demand, Kothari said on Jan. 3.
Purchases declined to between 875 tons and 880 tons last year
from 958 tons in 2010, according to the association.  Spot silver climbed for a third day, rising 0.4 percent to
$30.1950 an ounce. Cash platinum fell for the first time in
three days, dropping 0.4 percent to $1,516.13 an ounce.
Immediate-delivery palladium rose for a fourth day, gaining 0.2
percent to $653.50 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
