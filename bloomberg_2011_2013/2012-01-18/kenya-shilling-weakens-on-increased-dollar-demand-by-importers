Kenya ’s shilling depreciated for the
first day in three.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy weakened as
much as 0.5 percent to 86.58 per dollar and traded 0.3 percent
lower at 86.40 at 1:35 p.m. in Nairobi.  “The shilling has depreciated due to increased dollar
demand largely by the oil importers,” Duncan Kinuthia, a dealer
at Nairobi-based Commercial Bank of Africa Ltd., said in a phone
interview today.  The Central Bank of Kenya accepted 450 million shillings
($5.2 million) of bids for the 1 billion shillings of  repurchase
agreements  it offered at 17.833 percent, a bank official, who
declined be identified citing the bank’s policy, said in by
phone today from Nairobi, the capital.  Tanzania’s shilling appreciated for the first day in five
against the dollar as the  central bank  sold dollars in the
market. The currency of the second largest East African economy
climbed 0.8 percent to 1,581.85 and was trading 0.1 percent
higher at 1,593 at 1:06 p.m. in the capital  Dar es Salaam .  Uganda’s currency strengthened for the second day on
increased dollar inflows from coffee sales. The currency of the
third largest East African economy gained as much as 0.7 percent
to 2,392.50 and was trading 0.2 percent higher at 2,405 at 1:34
p.m. in Kampala the capital.  “The shilling is gaining on the back good dollar inflows
from commodity exports especially coffee and tight money market
following the payment of mid-month Value Added Tax by
businesses,” Taib Lubega, a currency trader at Stanbic Bank
 Uganda  Ltd., said by phone from Kampala.  To contact the reporter on this story:
