Vietnam ’s dong advanced to its
strongest level in a month after the central bank said inflation
would slow.  Government bonds  were steady.  Consumer prices will rise less than 12 percent at worst and
about 8.5 percent in a “good” scenario, central bank Governor
Nguyen Van Binh said on Jan. 12. Inflation in the $104 billion
economy was 18.1 percent in December. The dong will depreciate 2
percent to 3 percent this year, Binh said. That would be the
least since 2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “After the central bank governor said they would devalue
the dong by no more than 3 percent this year, demand for the
dollar has dropped as people may think keeping the foreign
currency won’t generate high returns,” said Cao Tan Phat, a Ho
Chi Minh City-based analyst at ACB Securities Inc.  The dong gained 0.3 percent to 20,935 per dollar as of 3:29
p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That was
its strongest level since Dec. 16. The central bank set the
currency’s reference rate unchanged at 20,828, its website
showed.  The dong declined 7.4 percent last year as policy makers
devalued the currency by about 7 percent in February to help
narrow the gap between the official and black-market rates.  The  yield  on the government’s five-year bonds was unchanged
at 12.46 percent, according to daily fixings from banks compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
