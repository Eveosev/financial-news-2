Mexico ’s benchmark peso bond yields
fell to a 10-week low as an improving global economic outlook
fueled investor demand for emerging-market assets.  The yield on Mexico’s benchmark peso-denominated bond due
in 2024 dropped nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to
6.38 percent in Mexico City, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The yield is the lowest since Nov. 8. The price of
the securities, known as Mbonos, rose 0.95 centavo to 131.72
centavos per peso. The peso posted its biggest gain in two
weeks.  The  International Monetary Fund  is proposing to raise its
lending capacity by as much as $500 billion to insulate the
global economy against any worsening of  Europe ’s debt crisis.
Confidence among U.S. homebuilders rose in January to the
highest level in more than four years as sales and buyer traffic
improved.  “Compared to where U.S. Treasuries are, Mbonos are still
trading pretty cheap because there’s quite a bit of  risk
aversion  priced in,” Ram Bala Chandran, a Latin American
currency and rates strategist at Citigroup, said in a telephone
interview from New York. “With global markets seemingly calm,
that premium is basically being taken out.”  Mexico’s peso bonds due 2024 yield 419 basis points more
than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The peso surged 1 percent to 13.3089 per  U.S. dollar , from
13.4381 yesterday. It’s appreciated 4.7 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
