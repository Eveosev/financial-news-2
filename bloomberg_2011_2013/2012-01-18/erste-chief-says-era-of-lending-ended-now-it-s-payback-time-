The era of unrestricted lending to
states and municipalities has ended and it is now “payback
time” for problems created as long as 30 years ago, Erste Bank
Group AG Chief Executive Officer Andreas Treichl said.  The central and eastern European countries are in a better
position to weather the crisis in the euro region as “in
reality the financial system in the region is pretty healthy,”
he told reporters today in Prague.  Hungary’s economic and political problems are
“unfortunate” and “bad for the region” although the country
could rekindle favor with investors within a year if it changes,
including going back to the  International Monetary Fund  for
funding, Treichl said.  Private initiatives to solve  Greece ’s debt burden will
“probably need a lot of luck,” the executive said.  The downgrade of  Austria  ’s sovereign rating on Dec. 13 by
 Standard & Poor’s  could trigger a similar downgrade of Erste
although it would have “little effect” on the financial group,
Treichl said. Erste will reach a new capital ratio requirement
of 9 percent by June unless something occurs that will prevent
it, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
