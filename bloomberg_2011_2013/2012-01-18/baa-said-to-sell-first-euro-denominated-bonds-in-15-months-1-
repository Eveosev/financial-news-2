BAA Ltd (BAA) ., Britain’s biggest airport
operator, is raising 700 million euros ($896 million) from its
first sale of debt in the currency since October 2010.  The five-year securities will be priced to yield 280 basis
points, or 2.8 percentage points, more than the benchmark swap
rate, according to a banker involved in the transaction. The
notes were initially marketed at a spread of 285 to 290 basis
points, said the banker, who declined to be identified because
the information is private.  BAA, which reported record passenger numbers for 2011 at
 London ’s Heathrow airport last week, postponed a sale of
subordinated bonds in pounds in November because of a
“significant” worsening in debt market conditions, it said at
the time. Since then, its only offerings have been two Swiss
franc-denominated bonds.  “The deal seems symptomatic of a more welcoming market,”
said Ian Robinson, a  fund manager  at F&C Asset Management Plc in
London, which oversees about 100 billion pounds ($154 billion.)  BAA last sold bonds in euros 15 months ago when it raised
500 million euros from 4.125 percent bonds due 2016, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The notes are graded A- by
Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings.  BNP Paribas SA, HSBC Holdings Plc, Lloyds Banking Group Plc
and  Banco Santander SA (SAN)  are managing the sale, which will be
issued through BAA Funding Ltd. The airport operator is owned by
Spanish builder  Ferrovial SA. (FER)   BAA didn’t immediately respond to an e-mailed request for
comment from Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
