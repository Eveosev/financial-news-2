Russian prosecutors charged 95
people for fraud during the parliamentary polls in December and
found about 3,000 violations of electoral law, according to a
 statement  on the Kremlin’s website today.  The abuses include signing blank protocols on results
before the polls, adding the names of people declared legally
incompetent to voter lists and using minors to canvas for
support, according to a preliminary report by Prosecutor General
Yuri Chaika to President  Dmitry Medvedev .  Opponents of Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  held two
demonstrations last month over alleged voter fraud in the Dec. 4
State Duma elections, each gathering tens of thousands of
protesters in the Russian capital and other cities.  Putin, 59, is seeking to return as president in the March 4
poll and may extend his time in power to almost a quarter of a
century if he wins that vote and is re-elected in 2018. Putin
served as president from 2000 to 2008.  Putin’s  United Russia  party inflated its share of the Duma
vote to about 50 percent from 30 percent, Communist leader
 Gennady Zyuganov  said Jan. 11. The Communists, the  Liberal
Democratic Party  and Just Russia said their candidates and
activists were beaten and arrested during the run-up to the
elections, while the authorities seized campaign materials and
distributed false literature. The government and United Russia
denied the accusations.  The statement on the Kremlin site didn’t identify party
affiliations of any of those charged.  To contact the reporter on this story:
