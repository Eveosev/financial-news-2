Bordeaux Winebank Group, a wine
trader that guarantees the origin and storage conditions of
wines it offers, started direct sales to businesses such as
hotel operators via the Internet.  Wine importers, distributors, hoteliers and restaurant
owners can buy vintages from Bordeaux-region producers including
Lafite Rothschild and Cheval Blanc via the Bordeaux Winebank
Exchange website that started yesterday, the Luxembourg-based
company said in an e-mailed statement today.  Bordeaux Winebank has about 80 million euros ($103 million)
of wine under management through units in  Luxembourg , Norway,
France, Singapore and  Hong Kong , according to the company. At a
December Sotheby’s auction in  New York , Bordeaux Winebank sold a
case of 2000 vintage Petrus for $72,600. Cheval Blanc is 750
euros ($962) a bottle for the 2000 vintage, according to the
statement.  The exchange “is a veritable filter against counterfeit
wines,” Bordeaux Winebank said. “100 percent of wines sold on
this platform are provenance guaranteed.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
