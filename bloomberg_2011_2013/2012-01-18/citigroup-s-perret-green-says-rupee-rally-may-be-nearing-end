Patrick Perret-Green, Singapore-
based head of foreign-exchange and rates strategy at Citigroup
Inc., comments on the outlook for  India ’s rupee in a note to
clients today.  The rupee advanced 0.3 percent to 50.585 per dollar as of
10:44 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency, which fell 16 percent last year in  Asia ’s worst
performance, has rallied 4.9 percent this month to be the
region’s biggest gainer.  Selling in the rupee “was overdone in November and
December and we said so. But with the currency now close to 50,
the juice is gone. Time to stand back and if feeling really
brave, try a bit of euro-rupee which has moved 7 percent since
Jan. 5.  ‘‘From a macro perspective, I remain fairly gloomy. Deficit
still out of control and the talk of bigger dividend payments
from state-owned companies looks like more of the usual pie-in-
the-sky stuff.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
