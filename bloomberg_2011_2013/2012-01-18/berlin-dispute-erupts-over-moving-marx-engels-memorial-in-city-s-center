Marx and Engels belong in the center
of Berlin, the city’s top culture official, Andre Schmitz, said
in a statement, rejecting a proposal by Construction Minister
Peter Ramsauer to banish the monument to the outskirts.  The bronze memorial to the pioneers of Communism was
erected in 1986 by the East German regime. It is located in a
park near where Berlin’s royal palace once stood, on Unter den
Linden, the main central boulevard.  The palace, once home to Prussia’s rulers, is to be rebuilt
from 2013 with government funding more than 60 years after the
communist regime demolished it. Ramsauer said the rebuilding of
the palace is a chance to restore Berlin’s historic core and
suggested shunting the memorial to the gardens of
Friedrichsfelde palace on the edge of the city in an interview
with the Morgenpost newspaper.  “History cannot be disposed of just like that,” Culture
Secretary Schmitz, a member of the  Social Democratic Party , said
in a statement sent by e-mail today. Ramsauer is a member of the
 Christian Social Union , the Bavarian sister party of  Angela Merkel ’s  Christian Democratic Union .  “As witness to a very particular era in Berlin’s history,
the Marx-Engels monument deserves a worthy place,” Schmitz said
in the statement.  Karl Marx  (1818-1883) was the author of “Das Kapital.”
Friedrich Engels (1820-1895) published volumes two and three
after Marx’s death.  To contact the writer on the story:
