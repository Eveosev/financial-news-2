Philippine 10-year bonds gained,
snapping a two-day decline, on speculation the central bank will
cut borrowing costs for the first time in two years. The peso
strengthened to a five-week high.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas will reduce its overnight
borrowing rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.25
percent tomorrow, according to 13 of 17 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. Four expect no change.  “Yields are reflecting a 25 basis-point rate cut,” said
Rafael Algarra, executive vice president and head of financial
markets at Security Bank Corp. in  Manila . “There may be limited
downside unless the market feels there will be more cuts.”  The yield on the 6.375 percent bond due January 2022 fell
three basis point, or 0.03 percentage point, to 5.17 percent, as
of 4:03 p.m. in Manila, according to Tradition Financial
Services. The peso rose 0.5 percent to 43.425 per dollar, after
climbing 0.6 percent yesterday, according to Tullett Prebon Plc.
It touched 43.41, the strongest level since Dec. 9.  Bangko Sentral may adjust policy this quarter to spur
investment, Governor Amando Tetangco said today. The bank’s
monetary-policy stance is “accommodative,” he said, adding
that the reserve-requirement ratio is a “blunt tool” with
which to guide the economy. Inflation slowed to an 11-month low
in December, with consumer prices rising 4.2 percent from a year
earlier, official data show.  Policy makers kept the  benchmark interest rate  unchanged for
a fifth meeting in December after two increases in 2011. They
also raised the reserve-requirement ratio for banks twice last
year to 21 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
