Liquidators of R. Allen Stanford’s
Antigua-based bank said investors who lost money in the alleged
$7 billion fraud should submit formal claims to creditors.  Grant Thornton LLP, appointed by an Antiguan court to wind
up Stanford International Bank, said creditors and victims
needed to complete and submit a claim form if they wanted to
receive distributions from the liquidators.  The firm hopes to release funds held in the U.K.,  Canada 
and  Switzerland  and proceeds from the sale of Stanford property
in Antigua.  “Today we can’t say that either is imminent, but we
continue pushing forward on both fronts as hard as we can to
make distribution to depositor victims,”  Grant Thornton
liquidator Hugh Dickson said in an e-mailed statement.  Liquidators in Antigua and the U.S. are seeking control of
Stanford’s assets to return money to his alleged victims,
including those who bought worthless certificates of deposit
from Stanford International Bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
