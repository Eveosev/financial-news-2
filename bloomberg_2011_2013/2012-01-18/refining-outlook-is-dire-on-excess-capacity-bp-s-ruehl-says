The outlook for oil refining in the
next two decades is “dire” given excess capacity in the
industry,  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Chief Economist  Christof Ruehl  said.  “Demand growth is expected to be weighted toward middle
distillates while fuel oil consumption declines,” Ruehl said
today at the company’s Energy Outlook 2030 presentation today in
London. “This will continue to put pressure on those refineries
with limited upgrading capacity.”  China’s strategy to build more refineries in order to
become self-sufficient in fuels would “severely curtail” the
growth in refinery utilization outside the country through 2030,
BP said in the  presentation .  Global refinery runs may also be limited by the increased
supply of products that don’t need to be processed at
traditional plants, such as biofuels and natural gas liquids,
which are expected to rise by a combined 6.5 million barrels a
day, it said. Output of crude-derived fuels is forecast to grow
by 9 million barrels a day in the next 20 years, BP said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
