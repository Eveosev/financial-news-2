The European Commission may rule
next week on whether state aid supplied to postal companies in
Germany, France, Belgium and Greece is in line with the region’s
competition rules,  Joaquin Almunia , European Union antitrust
chief, said in an interview with L’Echo.  “My intention is to have all the decisions on the four
operators approved by the college of commissioners next week,”
Almunia told the newspaper. He intends to announce the decisions
on Jan. 25, L’Echo cited him as saying.  The operators include Bpost SA, the mail company co-owned
by the Belgian state and CVC Capital Partners, and  Deutsche Post
AG. (DPW)   To contact the reporter on this story:
