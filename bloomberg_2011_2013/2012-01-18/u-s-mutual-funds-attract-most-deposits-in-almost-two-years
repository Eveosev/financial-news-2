U.S. mutual funds attracted the most
money in almost two years last week as investors poured cash
into bond funds and some returned to stock funds.  Funds had net deposits of $11.3 billion in the week ended
Jan. 11, the  Investment Company Institute  said today in an e-
mailed statement. The last time mutual funds took in that much
money was the week ended April 21, 2010, when they gathered
$12.6 billion in deposits, according to the Washington-based
trade group.  “If Europe and the U.S. do better, we may see some  money
flow  back into stocks,”  Russel Kinnel , director of mutual fund
research at Chicago-based  Morningstar Inc. (MORN) , said in a telephone
interview. “People seem to be responding to headlines.”  Investors put $753 million into funds that buy U.S. stocks
last week, the first time those funds had net deposits since
August, ICI data show. Funds that buy international stocks got
$681 million. Taxable bond funds won $6.12 billion and municipal
bond funds collected $1.74 billion, the most in any week since
October 2009.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has gained 4 percent this
year on better news about the  U.S. economy . Factory output
climbed 0.9 percent last month, the biggest increase since
December 2010, according to Federal Reserve data released today.
Confidence among U.S. homebuilders rose in January to the
highest level in more than four years as sales and buyer traffic
improved.  To contact the reporter on this story:
