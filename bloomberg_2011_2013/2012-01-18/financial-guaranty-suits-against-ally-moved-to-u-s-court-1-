Financial Guaranty Insurance Co.
lawsuits against  Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY)  over soured  mortgage loans 
backing securities sold to investors were moved to federal
court.  Financial Guaranty filed two lawsuits against Ally
Financial in  New York  state Supreme Court in  Manhattan  on Dec.
27, accusing Ally’s Residential Funding unit of making
“material misrepresentations” about the loans, which Financial
Guaranty said were riskier than promised. Ally said there was
“no merit” to it being named in the complaints.  The cases were moved to U.S. District Court in Manhattan on
Jan. 13, according to court documents filed in New York state
Supreme Court yesterday. Three other lawsuits filed by Financial
Guaranty against Ally Financial units in November were removed
to U.S. District Court earlier this month.  FGIC Corp., the holding company for Financial Guaranty
Insurance Co., sought bankruptcy protection from creditors in
August 2010 after suffering losses from the drop in the U.S.
housing market.  The cases are Financial Guaranty Insurance Co. v.  Ally
Financial  Inc., 653621-2011, and Financial Guaranty Insurance
Co. v. Ally Financial, 653623-2011, New York state Supreme Court
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
