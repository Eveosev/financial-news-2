The ruble appreciated for a third
day against the dollar and money-market rates rose the most in a
month as Russian companies converted overseas earnings into
local currency to pay taxes.  The ruble gained 0.5 percent to 31.5075 per dollar by the 7
p.m. close in Moscow, the strongest level since Dec. 27. The
overnight MosPrime rate banks say they charge to lend to each
other jumped 22 basis points to 4.93 percent, the biggest
advance since Dec. 22.  Companies are due to pay as much as 310 billion rubles
($9.8 billion) in taxes this week as the end-of-month payment
period begins, according to  Alfa Bank ’s estimates. Taxes support
the ruble as exporters convert revenue from abroad into the
Russian currency to pay the government.  “Tighter liquidity is always good for the ruble,” Alexei Moiseev, chief economist for VTB Capital in Moscow, said by e-
mail.  Lenders are due to repay as much as 171 billion rubles to
the Finance Ministry today, Natalia Orlova and Dmitry Dolgin,
Moscow-based analysts for Alfa Bank, wrote in an e-mailed
research note Jan. 12.  “Budget spending in December wasn’t enough to provide the
usual boost to liquidity,” Moiseev said. “It wasn’t even
enough to allow banks to repay loans from the Ministry of
Finance and the central bank.”  Oil,  Russia ’s chief export earner, climbed 0.2 percent to
$100.92 per barrel in New York futures trading. A U.S. Federal
Reserve report showed manufacturing in the New York region
expanded at the fastest pace in nine months yesterday, while
German investor confidence jumped the most on record in January,
according to the Mannheim-based ZEW Center for European Economic
Research.  OFZ Sale  “The environment so far has been good, with the oil-price
worries and better risk appetite overall,” VTB’s Moiseev said.  Investors pared bets on the ruble weakening further, with
non-deliverable forwards showing the Russsian currency at
31.9046 per dollar in three months. Russia’s dollar-denominated
bonds due in 2018 rose, pushing the yield down one basis point,
or 0.01 percentage point, to 4.233 percent.  The  Finance Ministry  sold 18.6 billion rubles of bonds due
June 2015 at an average yield of 7.67 percent, according to a
statement on its website. The yield on the notes was little
changed at 7.67 percent.  OFZs worth 45 billion rubles are due to be repaid today,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A total 401 billion
rubles’ worth are maturing this year, the most since at least
1996, when Bloomberg begain compiling the data.  After losing the most since 2008 last year, the ruble has
advanced 2 percent against the dollar in 2012. That compares
with a gain of 5.3 percent for  Brazil ’s real, a rise of 5.3
percent for  India ’s rupee and a drop of 0.3 percent for the
Chinese yuan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
