Georgia ’s central bank cut its main
interest rate for a fourth month, saying lower borrowing costs
will be sufficient to control inflation.  The bank, based in the capital, Tbilisi, lowered the rate
to 6.5 percent from 6.75 percent, according to a statement e-
mailed today.  Consumer prices advanced 2 percent from a year earlier in
December after rising at the slowest pace since 2009 the
previous month, the statistics office said this month.  Neighboring Armenia left its benchmark interest rate
unchanged at 8 percent for a fourth month on Jan. 10.
Azerbaijan’s rate is 5.25 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
