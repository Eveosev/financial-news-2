Croatia ’s  central bank  has the tools
it needs to keep the country’s currency stable, Deputy Governor
Boris Vujcic said.  “We have absolutely all tools in our hand to keep the
stability of the exchange rate as we did in the past year,”
Vujcic told reporters at a  Euromoney conference  in Vienna today.  The central bank intervened on the foreign-exchange market
yesterday for the second time this year, selling 130 million
euros at an exchange rate of 7.54 kuna. Policy makers in March
freed 6.3 billion kuna ($834 million) to ease credit for
economic development and help push Croatia out of recession by
cutting commercial banks’ asset-to-liability ratio to 17 percent
from 20 percent.  “So far we have intervened on the market, but we have also
worked on the kuna liquidity side,” Vujcic said. “After the
crisis had started, we created a structural excess of liquidity,
but we can always remove it and go back to tighter control of
liquidity conditions and  exchange-rate  movements.”  The next budget proposal, expected in February, may change
the bank’s negative economic forecast for this year, Vujcic
said. He said the economy will be bolstered by Croatia joining
the European Union in July 2013, adding that he expects the Jan.
22 referendum on the entry to pass, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
