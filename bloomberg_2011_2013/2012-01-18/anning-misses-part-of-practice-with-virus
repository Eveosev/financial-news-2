New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning missed part of today’s practice because of a stomach
ailment, coach  Tom Coughlin  said.  The Giants visit the San Francisco 49ers on Jan. 22 for the
National Football Conference championship, with the winner
advancing to the  Super Bowl .  Coughlin said during a news conference that Manning left
practice with a “stomach bug.” Manning passed for 4,933 yards,
29 touchdowns and 16 interceptions this season.  “Hopefully it’s a 24-hour deal and he’ll be better
tomorrow,” Coughlin said.  Manning, 31, has taken every snap at quarterback for the
Giants this season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
