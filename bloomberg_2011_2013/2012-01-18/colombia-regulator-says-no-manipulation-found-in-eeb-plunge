Colombia ’s securities regulator said
its investigation of last month’s three-day plunge in  Empresa de
Energia de Bogota SA  found no proof of “undue manipulation” by
traders or investors.  Colombia suspended trading of EEB, as Colombia’s second-
biggest electricity distributor is known, on Dec. 7 after the
sell-off. Shares plunged 17 percent over three days after
 Gustavo Petro , mayor-elect of the country’s capital, said he
would seek to merge the electricity company with other city-
controlled utilities.  The EEB share drop reflected “public information about the
company that was available to market agents,” the regulator
said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
