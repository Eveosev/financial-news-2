MEMC Electronic Materials Inc. (WFR) , the
second-largest U.S. maker of polysilicon, gained the most in a
week after reporting preliminary fourth-quarter revenue that
exceeded estimates.  MEMC climbed 7.9 percent to $4.92 at the close in New York,
the most since Jan. 11.  Revenue was $753 million to $792 million, the company said
in a statement today, compared with estimates of $755.3 million,
the average of 20 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. MEMC expects
to report a loss of 17 cents to 23 cents a share, compared with
an estimated 57-cent loss.  The company ended the quarter with about $586 million of
unrestricted cash and total liquidity of more than $800 million,
it said in the statement.  “MEMC is a 2012 story with the operational improvement
serving as a primary catalyst and market improvement serving as
a secondary catalyst,” Hari Chandra Polavarapu, an analyst at
Auriga USA LLC in  New York , wrote in a research note today.
“ Cash flow  is the focus and the company delivered on that
favorably.”  MEMC, based in St. Peters,  Missouri , said last month it
will fire 20 percent of its workforce and cut production as
prices plunged for polysilicon, the main raw material in solar
cells.  The  price  of polysilicon fell 64 percent last year to
$26.52 a kilogram at the end of December. It reversed this year,
increasing 4.9 percent to $27.83 on Jan. 9, the first time it
rose for two consecutive weeks since Aug. 8.  MEMC will report its fourth-quarter results Feb. 15 after
the close of regular trading in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
