Licensed exchange houses have
started selling the  U.S. dollar  on the black market, days after
Iran said its security forces will arrest illegal currency
traders as part of a crackdown aimed at stabilizing the  currency
market  and stemming the depreciation of the rial,  Mehr  reported.  Some exchange houses in the Iranian capital, Tehran, are
refusing to sell dollars at the official rate and are instead
offering it behind closed door to their customers at a higher
rate, the state-run  news agency  said.  The central bank’s official rate is 11,288 rials today,
according to its website. The dollar was sold on the black
market at a rate of 17,200 rials, Mehr said.  Ebrahim Darvishi, the central bank’s deputy governor of
supervision, said on Jan. 15 that only licensed exchange houses
and banks will be allowed to carry out currency transactions and
illegal traders will be punished.  Dollar transactions have been halted in  Iran ’s Bazaar Arz,
the center of the country’s foreign-exchange market, the state-
run Fars agency said in a separate report, citing an illegal
dealer. No one is buying or selling in the bazaar, he said,
according to Fars, adding that Iranian police arrested a few
traders today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
