OAO Sberbank said profit to Russian
accounting standards jumped last year as lending expanded.  Net income rose to 321.9 billion rubles ($10.2 billion),
not including events after the accounting period, the Moscow-
based bank said today on its website. That is 75 percent more
than the equivalent profit for the previous year, and 85 percent
more than the reported 2010 profit of 174 billion rubles that
included events after the end of 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
