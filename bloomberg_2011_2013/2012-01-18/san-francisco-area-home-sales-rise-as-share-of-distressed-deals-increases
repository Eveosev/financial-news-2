San Francisco Bay Area home sales
increased last month, driven by demand for distressed and
foreclosed properties,  DataQuick  said.  A total of 7,494 new and resale houses and condominiums
sold in the nine-county region last month, an increase of almost
19 percent from the previous month and 4.4 percent from December
2010, according to the San Diego-based data provider. The
increase from a year earlier was the sixth in a row.  Sales of foreclosed and other troubled properties, which
typically are discounted, made up almost 50 percent of
transactions, up from 46 percent in November and 48 percent a
year earlier, DataQuick said.  “Many of the deals that did make their way through the
system were in the distressed arena,” DataQuick President  John Walsh  said in the statement. “Much of it was deeply discounted
cash purchases, disproportionately at the lower end of the price
scale.”  The median Bay Area home price fell to $351,500 last month,
down 3.5 percent from November and 6.3 percent from a year
earlier, according to DataQuick. Sales for $500,000 or more
accounted for 31.4 percent of purchases, down from a revised 32
percent in November and 35 percent in December 2010, the data
provider said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
