Tim Martin, founder and chairman of
U.K. pub-chain  JD Wetherspoon Plc (JDW) , said the euro is “doomed”
and it’s better that governments accept the currency “isn’t
sustainable.”  “It is completely doomed, it has got no chance of
survival,” Martin said in a phone interview today. “It’s
better that everybody faces up to the reality that the euro
isn’t sustainable. We will have a much worse problem if we keep
propping it up with billions.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
