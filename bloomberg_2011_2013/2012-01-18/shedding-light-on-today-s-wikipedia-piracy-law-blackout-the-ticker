Hours after  Wikipedia  blacked out its 24-hour English-language site to protest legislation aimed at stopping online piracy, websites started publishing ways to get around it. Mashable offers  tips for the tech savvy  and the Atlantic has a  new tool  that lets users search Google’s cache of Wikipedia articles. The Washington Post, the Guardian and  National Public Radio  are responding to Twitter questions using the hashtag #altwiki. Congrats to those who have figured out a way to bypass the blackout, but is the emphasis on avoiding the inconvenience helping the case of Wikipedia,  Reddit ,  Boing Boing ,  Craigslist  and other websites blacking out their sites today? In the spirit of opposing the anti-piracy laws, alternative sites are highlighting what’s become inevitable online: the ease with which people can get around barriers to content. The blacked-out websites are protesting the Stop Online Piracy Act and its Senate version, the Protect Intellectual Property Act, which would give the government the power to limit websites that contain pirated content. Hollywood’s eager for more copyright protection, while Internet companies worry the legislation could damage a free and open Internet. In an increasingly interdependent Web, online news organizations rely on traffic from sites like Wikipedia and Reddit that could be limited if the legislation passes. A day without Wikipedia may be a nuisance, but it’s also a reminder of the importance of preserving Internet freedom,  David Carr writes  in the New York Times: Stu West, who is a board member of the Wikimedia Foundation, which runs Wikipedia,  estimates  that about 145 million people will be affected by the site’s 24-hour blackout. Instead of driving those visitors to alternate sources to avoid the problem, let’s use the opportunity of a black screen to pause and examine it.
