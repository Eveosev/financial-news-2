Norway ’s central bank will keep its
 benchmark rate  close to a record low for 12 months after cutting
it to 1.5 percent in March to protect the Nordic nation from
 Europe ’s worsening debt crisis, DNB ASA said in a report.  Norway’s biggest lender lowered its 2012 growth forecast
for Norway’s mainland economy, which excludes oil, gas and
shipping, to 2.4 percent from a December projection of 2.5
percent, citing weaker export demand. Growth next year is seen
at 2.7 percent, DNB said.  Norges Bank cut its benchmark rate by 50 basis points to
1.75 percent last month on concern that Europe’s debt crisis
will hurt the economy as exports wane. A worsening global growth
outlook has hurt  consumer confidence  in the world’s second-
richest nation per capita, pushing it to a 2 1/2-year low.  “The European sovereign debt crisis has already had
consequences for the Norwegian economy,”  Kyrre Aamdal , a senior
economist at DNB, wrote in the report. “The fear that the
crisis in Europe may have a dramatic outcome has made Norwegian
consumers more cautious.”  The Oslo-based bank forecast  Sweden ’s economy to grow 1.2
percent this year and 1.6 percent next year. The Riksbank will
cut its benchmark 50 basis points to 1.25 percent this year,
according to  DNB (DNB@NO) ’s forecasts. Denmark will expand 1.5 percent in
2012 and 1.7 percent next year, while  Finland  will grow 0.6
percent this year and 1.4 percent in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
