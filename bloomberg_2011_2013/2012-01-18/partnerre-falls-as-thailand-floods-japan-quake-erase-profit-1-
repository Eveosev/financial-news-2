PartnerRe Ltd. (PRE)  declined the most
since November after it said natural disasters including
flooding in Thailand wiped out fourth-quarter profit for the
reinsurer.  PartnerRe fell 2.6 percent to $63.29 at 4:03 p.m. in New
York. The Bermuda-based company has dropped about 22 percent in
the past year.  The fourth-quarter pretax operating loss was probably $110
million to $130 million, the company said in a statement late
yesterday. Costs include about $120 million from the Thailand
floods. The company said in December that it would take an $88
million fourth-quarter charge tied to the earthquake in  Japan 
after a fresh review of the disaster, which occurred in March.  “A series of complex catastrophe losses has proved
challenging to a management that had long been noted for
reliable loss estimates and good earnings visibility,” said
 Mark Dwelle , an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, in a note to
investors today. “Investors should focus on stories with better
near-term clarity.”  Dwelle lowered his  rating  on the stock to “sector
perform” from “outperform.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
