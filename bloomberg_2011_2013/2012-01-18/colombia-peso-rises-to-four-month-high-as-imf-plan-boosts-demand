Colombia’s peso gained to a four-
month high as the  International Monetary Fund  proposed raising
its lending capacity by $500 billion to safeguard the global
economy, fueling appetite for higher-yielding emerging-market
assets.  The peso jumped 0.8 percent to 1,823.10 per  U.S. dollar ,
from 1,837.40 yesterday. Earlier it touched 1,821.60, its
strongest intraday level since Sept. 16. The peso has jumped 6.3
percent this year, the best performance among world currencies
tracked by Bloomberg.  The Washington-based lender said it’s aiming to increase
its resources after identifying a potential need for $1 trillion
in financing in coming years. IMF Managing Director  Christine
Lagarde  said yesterday her staff is looking at ways to expand
the fund’s war chest, which has about $385 billion available.  “External markets started out this year on a more positive
note and news on the IMF is contributing to that,” said Juan
Camilo Santana, an analyst at Cia. de Profesionales de Bolsa SA
brokerage in Bogota.  The peso will continue to strengthen as companies exchange
dollars for the local currency to pay taxes in February and the
expanding economy attracts foreign investment, RBS Securities
Inc. said.  ‘Further Directional Gains’  “Comparatively high growth rates should sustain portfolio
and longer-term foreign direct investment flows into  Colombia ,
adding to our conviction for further directional gains in the
Colombian peso,” RBS strategist Flavia Cattan-Naslausky wrote
in a research note today.  Colombia’s central bank will likely wait for the peso to
strengthen further before announcing additional measures to ease
gains, Santana said.  Banco de la Republica announced on Oct. 28 it will sell
$200 million in dollar options to control the peso’s volatility.
The sale of the options will be triggered when the peso’s 20-day
moving average changes by more than 4 percent. No options have
been auctioned since the announcement.  The yield on the nation’s 10 percent bonds due in July 2024
fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.37
percent, according to the stock exchange. The bond’s price rose
0.197 centavo to 120.936 centavos per peso.  Colombia sold inflation-linked peso bonds due February 2023
today to yield 3.45 percent at the government’s first auction of
the indexed securities this year. The government also sold
inflation-indexed securities, known as TES UVR, due May 2017 to
yield 2.76 percent and due February 2015 to yield 2.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
