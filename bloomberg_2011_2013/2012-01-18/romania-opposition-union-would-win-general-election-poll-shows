Romania ’s two main opposition
parties, which are cooperating in an alliance, would take most
votes in a general election, followed by the ruling Democrat
Liberals, a poll showed.  The opposition Social-Liberal Union, formed by the  Social
Democrats  and Liberals, would get 48 percent of the vote, while
the ruling Liberal Democrats would garner 21 percent, according
to a poll conducted between Dec. 20 and Dec. 30 by Bucharest-
based pollster CSOP.  The  People’s Party , newly-founded by media owner Dan
Diaconescu, would also get 12 percent, while the Democratic
Union of Hungarians in Romania, an ethnic minority party which
is part of the current governing coalition, would win 6 percent,
according to the poll  published  by the Romanian newspaper
Evenimentul Zilei today.  Prime Minister Emil Boc’s coalition government faces
growing opposition to its austerity budget ahead of a general
election scheduled for later this year, as it froze wages and
pensions and plans to trim state jobs. Thousands have protested
across the country over the past six days against the government
and President Traian Basescu, who is backed by the Liberal
Democrats.  The poll is based on interviews with 1,033 people across
the country. No margin of error was released.  To contact the reporter on this story:
