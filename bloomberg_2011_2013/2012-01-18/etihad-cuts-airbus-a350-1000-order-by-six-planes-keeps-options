Etihad, the Abu Dhabi government-
owned airline, said it reduced orders of  Airbus (EAD)  A350-1000
aircraft to 19 planes from 25 while retaining options to buy
more of the wide-body jets.  “ Etihad Airways  has a great deal of confidence in the A350
XWB program and we are delighted we have been able to retain
attractive delivery positions for the -1000 derivative,” the
company said in an e-mailed statement today. “While we will be
reducing our firm orders, our 25 options and purchase rights for
this fleet remain in place and will no doubt play a crucial role
in the airline’s growth.”  Airbus’ latest order table dated Jan. 17 showed Etihad had
19 A350 planes remaining on order. Etihad has options for 25
more, the carrier said. The A350-1000 is part of the A350 XWB
program of twin-engine jetliners that Airbus is developing and
is the longest in the family.  Airbus is set to introduce in 2017 the A350 wide-body
airliner, its answer to  Boeing Co. (BA) ’s 777 planes. The French
planemaker had originally promised the largest variant of the
double-aisle A350-1000 for 2014 only to later delay its arrival
by three years. It has twice delayed the introduction of the
first A350-900, a smaller version, now set to enter operation
from the first half of 2014 instead of July 2013.  -- Editors: Tim Farrand, James Kraus  To contact the reporter on this story:
