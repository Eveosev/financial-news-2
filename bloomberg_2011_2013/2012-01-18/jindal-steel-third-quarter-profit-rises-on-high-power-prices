Jindal Steel & Power Ltd. ,  India â€™s
biggest producer of the alloy by market value, reported a 6.6
percent increase in third-quarter group profit, aided by a one-
time gain and higher demand for electricity.  Net income  rose to 9.97 billion rupees ($198 million) in
the three months ended Dec. 31 from 9.35 billion rupees a year
earlier, the company said today in a statement to the Bombay
Stock Exchange. The median of 14 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg was 10.3 billion rupees. Sales rose 37 percent to 43.5
billion rupees.  Total expenses, including raw material costs, for the
quarter jumped 58 percent to 29.5 billion rupees, the company
said. Jindal Steel made an exceptional gain of 259.4 million
rupees in the period, it said, without giving details.  The  stock  fell 0.2 percent to 510.55 rupees at the close of
trading today in Mumbai. The key Sensitive Index fell 0.1
percent.  Jindal Steel  plans to spend about 1 trillion rupees to
build a 5 million-ton steel plant and two  power plants  in the
east Indian state of Jharkhand. The company, scouting for coal
assets overseas to meet requirements for its blast furnace and
power plants, will start output at its mine in  Mozambique  this
year.  To contact the reporter for this story:
