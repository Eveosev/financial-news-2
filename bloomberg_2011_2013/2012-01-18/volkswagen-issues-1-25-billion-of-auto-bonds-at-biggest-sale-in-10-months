Volkswagen AG sold $1.25 billion in
bonds backed by auto loans in its largest sale in 10 months,
according to a person familiar with the sale.  The offering was increased in size from $1 billion, said
the person, who declined to be identified because terms arenâ€™t
public. A top-rated slice maturing in 2.4 years yields 22 basis
points more than the benchmark swap rate. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  The Wolfsburg, Germany-based automaker sold $1.5 billion of
similar asset-backed bonds in March, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. A portion carrying top grades with a 2.2 year
maturity priced to yield 25 basis points over the benchmark, the
data show.  Ford Motor Co. (F) , through its finance arm, today sold $1.6
billion of bonds backed by auto loans, a person familiar with
that sale said. The issue was increased from $1 billion. A top-
ranked slice maturing in 2.3 years yields 23 basis points more
than the benchmark swap rate.  Bond offerings linked to automobile loans and leases are
set to dominate sales of asset-backed debt for a fourth straight
year in 2012 as a strengthening U.S. economy spurs consumers to
buy vehicles. Sales of the securities may jump 11 percent to $63
billion this year, accounting for about 55 percent of bonds tied
to consumer borrowing, according to Wells Fargo Securities LLC
estimates. About $57 billion of bonds tied to auto debt were
sold in 2011, or 54 percent of new deals, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
