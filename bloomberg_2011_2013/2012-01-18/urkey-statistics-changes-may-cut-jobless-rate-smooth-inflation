Turkey ’s statistics agency plans
changes to data collection methods that may lower the
measurement of the jobless rate and reduce volatility in
 consumer price inflation .  The State Statistics Institute in Ankara plans to shift its
measure of the workforce in 2013 to meet European Union
standards, Enver Tasti, who heads the team compiling the labor
market data, told reporters in Ankara today. The agency will
class people as unemployed if they’ve sought work in the last
month, rather than the three-month period it uses now.  The  jobless rate  measured according to the Eurostat
standard is about 1 or 2 percentage points lower than the
Turkish measurement, Tasti said. Turkey’s jobless rate fell to
9.1 percent in October from 11.2 percent a year earlier,
according to figures announced Jan. 16.  The institute will also sample prices for 15 major
components of the food index four times a month, instead of
twice, in an attempt to reduce the impact of exceptional price
changes, Cengiz Erdogan, head of the inflation team, said at the
briefing. The institute is also examining other ways to reduce
volatility in its inflation measurement and may introduce them
next year, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
