Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  asked a New
York state court judge to order arbitration in a lawsuit against
the investment bank by Basis Yield Alpha Fund or dismiss the
complaint.  Basis Yield Alpha Fund, a unit of Australian hedge fund
Basis Capital Funds Management Ltd., sued Goldman Sachs in New
York State Supreme Court in October, accusing the bank of making
false and misleading statements and omissions in connection with
the sale of securities known as Timberwolf and Point Pleasant.  Basis Yield agreed that any disputes connected to the
investments would be subject to binding arbitration when it
opened its trading account, New York-based Goldman Sachs said in
court documents filed yesterday.  The case should be dismissed if arbitration isn’t ordered
because it lacks a “substantial nexus” to  New York , and
because the losses from the investments were caused by the
collapse of the mortgage market and not by misrepresentations,
Goldman Sachs said in the filings.  “Not only are subjective opinions as to market direction
inactionable, but defendants had no crystal ball as to market
direction any more than did BYAFM or any other investor,”
Goldman Sachs said in the court documents.  A June 2010 lawsuit by Basis Capital over the securities
was dismissed last year by U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones in
 Manhattan , who ruled the Australian fund couldn’t use U.S.
securities laws to pursue its claims against Goldman Sachs.  The case is Basis Yield Alpha Fund (Master) v. Goldman
