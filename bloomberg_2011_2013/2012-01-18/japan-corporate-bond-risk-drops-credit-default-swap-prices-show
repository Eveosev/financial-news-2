The cost of protecting corporate
bonds from default in  Japan  fell, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index fell 1.5 basis points to 182
as of 10:04 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG prices show. The
gauge is set for its lowest close since Dec. 8, according to
data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index was unchanged at 172
basis points as of 12:06 p.m. in Sydney, according to Credit
Agricole SA. The index closed yesterday at its lowest level
since Oct. 31, according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group
Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan rose one basis point to 200 as of 9:10
a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
