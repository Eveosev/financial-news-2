An inquiry into British complicity
in the torture of terrorism suspects will be scrapped as a
result of police starting a probe into allegations of
mistreatment in  Libya , Justice Secretary Ken Clarke said today.  London’s Metropolitan Police said Jan. 12 they will
investigate allegations that suspects were sent to Libya and
mistreated there. On the same day British spies were told by
police and the  Crown Prosecution Service  that they will not be
prosecuted over claims they were complicit in the torture of
Binyam Mohamed, a detainee held by U.S. officials.  “The government fully intends to hold an independent
judge-led inquiry once police investigations are concluded to
establish the facts and draw a line under these issues,” Clarke
told lawmakers in the House of Commons today. “We do want these
matters to be investigated thoroughly,” Clarke said, adding
that police will take “months at least” to conclude their
inquiries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
