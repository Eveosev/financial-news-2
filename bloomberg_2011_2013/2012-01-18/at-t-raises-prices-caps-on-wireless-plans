AT&T Inc. (T)  will raise data-plan
prices for smartphone and tablet users by $5 a month and
increase the usage allotment on each offer to address a 40
percent increase in traffic.  The nation’s second-largest wireless operator will increase
monthly fees Jan. 22, according to a statement today. The
revised charges, only for new customers, start at $20 for 300-
megabytes, $30 for 3-gigabytes and $50 for 5-gigabytes. The
previous plans  offered  200-megabytes for $15, 2-gigabytes for
$25 and 4-gigabytes for $45 a month.  AT&T says the move is not a reaction to the Federal
Communications Commission’s blocking of its planned T-Mobile
Inc. takeover last year, which CEO  Randall Stephenson  warned
would cause price increases if it failed. Mark Siegel, a
spokesman for the Dallas-based company, said the changes will
give people higher usage caps as data traffic climbs about 40
percent a year.  By comparison,  Verizon Wireless  charges $30 for 2
gigabytes, $50 for 5 gigabytes and $80 for 10 gigabytes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
