(Corrects first paragraph to surplus.)  Copper supply exceeded demand by
46,200 metric tons in the first 11 months of last year,
compared with a shortage of 61,900 tons for all of 2010, the
World Bureau of Metal Statistics said.  The aluminum market had a 859,900-ton surplus in the
period, the Ware, England-based company said. That compares with
a surplus of 825,900 tons during the same period a year earlier,
it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
