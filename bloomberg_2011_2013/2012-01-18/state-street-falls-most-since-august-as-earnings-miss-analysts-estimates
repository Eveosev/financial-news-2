  State Street Corp. (STT) , the third-
largest custody bank, fell the most in five months after fourth-
quarter earnings missed analysts’ estimates and Chief Executive
Officer Joseph Hooley said weak  capital markets  will probably
persist in 2012.  State Street dropped 6.6 percent to close at $39.95 in New
York trading, the most since Aug. 10, after the Boston-based
company missed the 94-cents-a-share average estimate of 21
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “I’m not trying to give necessarily a negative outlook,
just a realistic outlook,” Hooley said during a conference call
with investors. “I don’t think anybody’s ready to predict that
the most recent markets are going to sustain themselves.”  Custody banks, hurt by record-low  interest rates  that
reduce the return on investments and lending, and by a decline
in equity markets in 2011, have worked to buoy profits by
cutting expenses. State Street has eliminated 2,250 jobs in the
past 13 months as it aimed to reduce costs by at least $575
million annually by 2015.  Hooley said it would be difficult to create positive
operating leverage in 2012, referring to the ability of revenue
growth to outpace expense growth. He said he intended to
continue trimming expenses and hoped to increase dividends and
share buybacks this year.  ‘Not As Upbeat’  “State Street has been a strong stock and the commentary
from the company was not as upbeat today as it had been in the
past two quarters,”  Gerard Cassidy , an analyst with  RBC Capital
Markets  in Portland, Maine, said in a telephone interview.  Shares had been up 33 percent since the end of the third
quarter of 2011 through yesterday, compared with a 20 percent
gain by rival  Northern Trust Corp. (NTRS)  and 14 percent by  Bank of New
York Mellon Corp (BK)  over the same period.  State Street said profit on an operating basis rose 4.4
percent to $454 million, or 93 cents a share, from $435 million,
or 87 cents, a year earlier. State Street said revenue was $2.32
billion, compared with $2.41 billion expected by the  analysts,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
