Mitt Romney leads  Newt Gingrich  by
10 percentage points among likely voters in South Carolina’s
Jan. 21 Republican presidential primary, a drop in the margin he
had earlier this month, a CNN/Time/ORC International  poll  shows.  Romney, a former Massachusetts governor and business
executive, was backed by 33 percent, while Gingrich, a onetime
U.S. House speaker, had 23 percent, according to the poll
released today.  Taken Jan. 13-17, the poll shows former U.S. Senator Rick Santorum of  Pennsylvania  with 16 percent, followed by U.S.
Representative Ron Paul of  Texas  at 13 percent and Texas
Governor Rick Perry at 6 percent.  The survey had a margin of error of plus-or-minus 4.5
percentage points.  In a similar poll taken Jan. 4-5, Romney had 37 percent,
followed by Santorum at 19 percent and Gingrich at 18 percent.  Romney, 64, won the first two nominating contests in  Iowa 
and New Hampshire earlier this month.  In  Florida , site of a Jan. 31 primary, Romney has the
backing of 43 percent of likely voters, the CNN poll shows.
Santorum was next with 19 percent, followed by Gingrich at 18
percent and Paul at 9 percent. The margin of error for the
Florida survey was plus-or-minus 5 percentage points.  The contest in  South Carolina (STO1SC)  is playing out in an economic
environment that’s worse than the national average. The state’s
 unemployment rate  was 9.9 percent in November, the most recent
month available, compared with December’s  national rate  of 8.5
percent. That was high enough to put South Carolina in the top
10 states for the most unemployment in November.  The November  unemployment rate  in Florida was 10 percent.
Nevada had the nation’s  highest  unemployment rate in November at
13 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
