DZ Bank AG is “bullish” on Turkish
bonds and estimates a yield of 10.20 percent for the two-year
benchmark over the next three months.  “What favors Turkish bonds at the moment might be the fact
that the Turkish lira might have found its low against the
majors thanks to the support of the central bank,” Felix Herrmann, analyst at DZ Bank AG in  Frankfurt , said in e-mailed

again, it makes Turkish high yielding bonds interesting for
carry trade position.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
