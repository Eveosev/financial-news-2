Bang & Olufsen A/S , the maker of
luxury stereos and television sets, fell the most in two months
in Copenhagen trading after net income missed estimates.  B&O fell as much as 5.6 percent, the most since Nov. 15,
after reporting second-quarter net income of 28.8 million kroner
($4.94 million). That compares with an average estimate of 33.5
million kroner in a Bloomberg survey of four analysts. The stock
declined 1 krone, or 1.6 percent, to 62 kroner at 9:57 a.m. in
the Danish capital.  B&O, based in Struer,  Denmark , said revenue at its AV unit,
which includes its stereos and TV sets, declined 8.6 percent in
the second quarter as European sales slumped.  To contact the reporter on this story:
