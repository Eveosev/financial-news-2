Estonian hedge fund Gild Arbitrage
said its liabilities exceed assets after a writedown on its
Armenian assets,  Baltic News Service  reported, citing a note to
investors by fund manager Tonu Pekk.  Liabilities of the Tallinn-based fund, which froze
withdrawals in November 2008, exceeded assets by about 800,000
euros ($1 million) at the end of last year after assets were
revalued to 18.3 million euros from 25.1 million euros six
months earlier, BNS said. The fund wrote down the value of its
Armenian assets by more than 9 million euros, it added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
