Copper gained for a third day as
economic data from the U.S. and Germany yesterday beat
forecasts, and slowing  China  growth bolstered the case for
policy easing, improving the outlook for metal demand.  Three-month delivery copper on the London Metal Exchange
swung between gains and losses of 0.5 percent and traded 0.4
percent higher at $8,236 a metric ton by 12:24 p.m. Shanghai
time. The contract rose to $8,262 yesterday, the highest level
since Oct. 28. Copper for March-delivery on the Comex in New
York climbed 0.5 percent to $3.7490 a pound.  “Markets had factored in a slowdown in China and possible
defaults in Europe,” Zhang Tianfeng, an analyst at Dongxing
Futures Co., said by phone from Shanghai. “Going forward, we’re
more likely to see positive developments, such an easing in
China, or further improvement in the  U.S. economy .”  China’s economy  expanded at 8.9 percent in the last three
months of 2011, the slowest pace in 10 quarters as Europe’s debt
crisis curbed export demand and the  property market  weakened,
sustaining pressure on Premier Wen Jiabao to ease monetary
policy. A report yesterday showed manufacturing in the New York
region expanded in January at the fastest pace in nine months,
while German investor confidence advanced to the most on record
in January.  The  World Bank  cut its global growth forecast by the most
in three years, saying that a recession in the euro region
threatens to exacerbate a slowdown in emerging markets. The
Washington-based institution said the world economy this year
will rise 2.5 percent, less than a June estimate of 3.6 percent.  Copper for April-delivery on the  Shanghai  Futures Exchange
closed the morning session 0.4 percent lower at 59,710 yuan
($9,460) a ton.  Aluminum fell 0.2 percent to $2,222.75 a ton in London.
Zinc dropped 0.1 percent to $1,999.25 a ton, lead declined 0.2
percent to $2,103 a ton, and nickel rose 0.4 percent to $19,600
a ton. Tin hadn’t been traded.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
