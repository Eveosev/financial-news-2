Catalyst Paper Corp. (CTL) , a Canadian
newsprint maker, sought bankruptcy protection from U.S.
creditors requesting recognition of its main Canadian court
proceeding.  The company, based in Richmond, British Columbia, sought
bankruptcy protection under Chapter 15 of the U.S.  bankruptcy
code  listing assets and debt of more than $1 billion, according
to court documents filed yesterday in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in
Wilmington,  Delaware .  Chapter 15 of the bankruptcy code is used by foreign
companies to protect their assets from creditors and shield them
from lawsuits.  Catalyst reached an agreement with bondholders to be
implemented under the Canada Business Corporations Act, which
will cut debt by C$315.4 million ($310.6 million) while almost
wiping out shareholders, according to a Jan. 14 statement.  Under the plan, holders of Catalyst’s senior secured and
senior notes would own 99.5 percent of the company’s common
shares. The remaining 0.5 percent would be held by holders of
Catalyst’s existing common shares.  Catalyst would exchange $390.4 million of 11 percent senior
secured notes due in 2016 for $325 million of new 11 percent
first lien notes and 80 percent of the company’s common shares.
Catalyst would also swap $250 million of 7.38 percent senior
notes due in 2014 for 19.5 percent of its common shares, as well
as warrants giving bondholders the right to buy more shares.  The case is In re Catalyst Paper Corp., 12-10221, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
