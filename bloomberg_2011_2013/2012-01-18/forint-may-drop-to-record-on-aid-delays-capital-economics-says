The forint may weaken to a record
low before the Hungarian government ends its “game of chicken”
with the European Union and  International Monetary Fund  and
accepts conditions for a bailout package, according to  Capital
Economics .  “Until a deal is reached, the forint is likely to come
under severe strain, perhaps falling below 325 per euro,” Neil Shearing, London-based economist at the research company, and
colleagues said in an e-mailed report today. “A fully-blown
banking crisis, prompted by escalating problems in the euro-
zone, may be the deciding factor.”  Hungary’s currency appreciated 1.1 percent to 306.1 per
euro by 5:06 p.m. in Budapest, compared with a record low of
324.24 reached on Jan 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
