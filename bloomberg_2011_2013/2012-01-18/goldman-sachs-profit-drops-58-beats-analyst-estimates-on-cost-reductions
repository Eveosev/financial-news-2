Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  climbed 6.8
percent in New York trading after the bank reported profit that
exceeded analysts’ estimates, helped by a reduction in
compensation costs.  The shares rose $6.63 to $104.31 at 4:15 p.m., after
reaching $105.83 earlier today. Fourth-quarter net income at the
New York-based company dropped 58 percent to $1.01 billion, or
$1.84 a share, beating the $1.23 average  estimate  of 26 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 57, cut
compensation 21 percent in 2011 as he reduced costs and focused
on international growth to offset a slowdown in trading, which
contributes most of the firm’s revenue. Goldman Sachs’s higher-
than-estimated earnings contrasted with previous reports from
 Citigroup Inc. (C) , which fell short of analysts’ estimates, and
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. , which matched projections.  “When you do have challenges on the top line, the first
thing you look at as a securities analyst is ‘are you managing
your costs?’”  William Fitzpatrick , a Milwaukee-based financial-
services analyst at Manulife Asset Management, said on Bloomberg
Television’s “InsideTrack.” “We’ve seen a couple of the banks
who aren’t necessarily doing that very well, but Goldman Sachs
clearly has a good handle on that.”  Goldman Sachs reduced the amount of revenue it paid out in
compensation during the fourth quarter to 36.5 percent, while
analysts including Ed Najarian at International Strategy &
Investment Group Inc. were expecting a ratio closer to 43
percent. The company’s tax rate fell to 28 percent for the year,
compared with 30.3 percent for the first nine months.  Cost Cuts  The firm’s target is to reduce annual costs by $1.4
billion, more than the initial $1.2 billion goal set in the
middle of last year, David A. Viniar, Goldman Sachs’s chief
financial officer, said on a conference call with investors
today. The company eliminated 2,400 jobs last year and reduced
the size of its balance sheet to $923 billion at the end of the
year from $949 billion three months earlier, the first quarterly
decline since the end of 2009.  “While it is not possible to cut expenses as a means to
prosperity, we understand the benefits of a proactive and
disciplined approach particularly if the operating environment
remains challenging,” Viniar said.  At the same time, Viniar echoed recent comments by
Blankfein that the firm expects business to rebound. He compared
the current slowdown with the collapse of hedge fund Long-Term
Capital Management LP in late 1998, the decline in technology
stocks in 2000 and the credit crisis in 2008.  Different World  “We’ve seen downturns before,” he said. “Every time
you’re in one if feels like it’s never going to end and that the
world is different now. I wouldn’t say, for example, that the
environment feels worse than it felt in the fall of 2008 or
necessarily after the tech bubble burst, nor necessarily after
the fall of 1998.”  Net income for the year fell 47 percent to $4.44 billion,
the lowest since 2008. Return on average common  shareholders’
equity , known as ROE, was 3.7 percent for the year, down from
11.5 percent in 2010.  “Yes, we’re going to be prudent in managing our capital,
yes we’re going to be prudent in managing our expenses,” Viniar
said today. “But our ROE growth is going to largely be driven
by growing our revenues, expanding our footprint, expanding our
client base and growing the firm.”  Revenue Miss  Revenue for 2011 dropped 26 percent to $28.8 billion, the
lowest since 2008, and declined 30 percent in the fourth quarter
to $6.05 billion. The average estimate of 18 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg was for $6.39 billion in fourth-quarter revenue.  Compensation, the company’s biggest expense, decreased to
$12.2 billion for the full year and fell 2 percent to $2.21
billion in the fourth quarter. The cost was 42.4 percent of
total revenue for the full year. The total number of employees
fell to 33,300 at the end of December from 34,200 three months
earlier and from 35,700 a year earlier.  Discretionary compensation for 2011, which refers to cash
and equity bonuses, declined “significantly more” than revenue
on a full-year basis, Viniar said.  Goldman Sachs’s larger New York-based rivals have also
suffered from the decline in trading. Citigroup, the third-
biggest  U.S. bank  by assets, said yesterday that fourth-quarter
 net income  dropped 11 percent as lower revenue from advising
companies and trading securities led to the first quarterly loss
at its investment bank since 2008. JPMorgan, the biggest U.S.
bank, said last week that fourth-quarter net income slid 23
percent as investment bank earnings fell by half.  ‘Encouraging Signs’  “As economies and markets improve -- and we see
encouraging signs of this -- Goldman Sachs is very well
positioned to perform for our clients and our shareholders,”
Blankfein said in the company’s statement today.  In the last year Goldman Sachs lost about 50 partners, the
highest rank of employees who share in a special compensation
pool and are elected every two years. Among the departures were
six members of the management committee, including trading co-
heads Edward K. Eisler, 42, and David B. Heller, 44, last week.  Viniar said that fewer partners than normal left the firm
over the last four years because they wanted to remain loyal to
Goldman Sachs as it navigated the aftermath of the financial
crisis and blows to its reputation such as the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission’s 2010 lawsuit against the firm.  Partnership Turnover  “You tend to find 15 percent to 20 percent of our
partnership turning over every two years,” Viniar said. “It’s
been like that almost through our history, and you saw far less
than that turning over the last four years. And I think what
you’re seeing now is, as I said, normal progression.”  Institutional client services, the division that handles
sales and trading for customers, generated $3.06 billion in the
fourth quarter, down 16 percent from the same period of 2010.
The business, now supervised by Isabelle Ealet, Pablo J. Salame
and Harvey M. Schwartz, made $17.3 billion in full-year revenue,
down from $21.8 billion in 2010.  Fixed-income, currency and commodities trading contributed
$1.36 billion of revenue for the quarter and $9.02 billion for
the year, down from $1.64 billion in the fourth quarter of 2010
and $13.7 billion for that full year.  JPMorgan (JPM)  last week said
its investment bank produced $2.49 billion of fixed-income
trading revenue in the quarter and $15.3 billion for the year.  Accounting Gains  The company’s 2011 trading revenue included about $600
million in accounting gains related to the widening of the
company’s credit spreads during the year, Goldman Sachs said in
the statement. The effect of such adjustments in the fourth
quarter was “not material,” the company added.  Equities, the business that Heller supervised, made $1.69
billion in fourth-quarter revenue, down from $2 billion, and
$8.26 billion for the year, up from $8.1 billion in 2010. That
compares with JPMorgan’s $779 million in fourth-quarter equities
revenue and $4.83 billion for the year.  Goldman Sachs boosted its value-at-risk, the maximum amount
the company estimates it could lose from trading on 95 percent
of days, to $135 million in the fourth quarter -- the highest
level since the second quarter of 2010 -- from $102 million in
the prior quarter, the statement showed. The increase was driven
by “significantly greater volatility in the interest-rate
category,” Viniar said.  China Investment  Investing & Lending, which includes the firm’s gains and
losses on its own stakes in companies, funds and securities,
produced $872 million in fourth-quarter revenue, a 56 percent
drop, and $2.14 billion for the year, a 72 percent decline.
Gains from Goldman Sachs’s holding in  Industrial & Commercial
Bank of China Ltd. , the country’s biggest lender, jumped to $388
million in the quarter from $55 million a year earlier. The
investment recorded a loss of $517 million for the year,
compared with a $747 million gain in 2010.  Goldman Sachs’s investment-banking division, managed
worldwide by Richard J. Gnodde, David M. Solomon and John S. Weinberg, made $857 million in revenue for the quarter, down 43
percent from $1.51 billion a year earlier. Revenue for the full
year slid 9 percent to $4.36 billion. JPMorgan made $1.12
billion in fourth-quarter investment-banking fees and a full-
year total of $5.86 billion.  The company’s investment-banking transaction backlog, a
measure of assignments that haven’t yet been completed, fell in
the fourth quarter compared with the third and was higher than a
year earlier, according to the statement.  Financial Advisory  Revenue from financial advisory, which includes the mergers
and acquisitions business led globally by Gene T. Sykes in  Los
Angeles  and London-based Yoel Zaoui, decreased 25 percent in the
fourth quarter to $470 million and retreated 4 percent for the
year to $1.99 billion. Goldman Sachs ranked No. 1 among advisers
on global takeovers in 2011 for the first time since 2008,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Fourth-quarter revenue from equity underwriting, led by
London-based Matthew Westerman, decreased 66 percent to $191
million and declined 26 percent to $1.09 billion for the full
year. The bank ranked No. 1 in managing equity, equity-linked
and rights sales in 2011 for the first time since 2006, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Debt-underwriting revenue was down
40 percent in the fourth quarter to $196 million and was
virtually unchanged for the year at $1.28 billion.  Investment management, overseen by  Timothy O’Neill  and Eric S. Lane since the retirement of Edward C. Forst at year-end,
made $1.26 billion in fourth-quarter revenue and $5.03 billion
for the full year. That compares with $1.51 billion in the
fourth quarter of 2010 and $5.01 billion for the full year.
Assets under management climbed to $828 billion from $821
billion three months earlier and compared with $840 billion a
year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
