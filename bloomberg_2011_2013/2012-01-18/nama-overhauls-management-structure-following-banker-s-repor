Ireland’s National Asset Management
Agency is changing its management structure so that its lending
and corporate finance teams report to Deputy Head of Portfolio
Management Michael Moriarty rather than to the head of lending.  NAMA won’t appoint a new head of lending after Graham
Emmett leaves, spokesman  Ray Gordon  said by phone today. Emmett,
a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker, is leaving by “mutual
agreement” to return to the U.K., Gordon said Jan. 13.  The changes follow a review by former HSBC Holdings Plc
Chief Executive Officer Mike Geoghegan that recommended
restructuring NAMA’s portfolio management, credit and risk,
lending and legal departments. NAMA must be transformed into an
“entrepreneurial” business from a startup, otherwise it might
“cost the Irish taxpayer a number of billion euros,” he wrote
in the review sent to Finance Minister  Michael Noonan  Dec. 6.  NAMA was established to purge Ireland’s banks of 74.2
billion euros ($95 billion) of troubled commercial real-estate
loans, for which it paid 31.7 billion euros. The agency plans to
sell loan portfolios this year and it’s seeking to set up
mortgage REITs to help sell 25 percent of its loan book by 2013,
Chief Executive Officer  Brendan McDonagh  said in an October
interview.  Ireland appointed Geoghegan last month to head a group set
up to advise Noonan on NAMA’s strategy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
