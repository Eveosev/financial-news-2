U.K. 10- and 30-year gilt yields
fell to record lows after a government report showed the
nation’s jobless rate unexpectedly increased last quarter.  The extra  yield  investors demand to hold 10-year bonds
instead of two-year notes shrank to the narrowest since January
2009 after the World Bank cut its forecast for global economic
growth. The pound weakened for a second day against the euro
after a  fund manager  said Greece is close to a deal with its
creditors over its debt restructuring plan, spurring demand for
the 17-nation currency.  “The labor market in the U.K. is likely to deteriorate
further and that will be a drag on  consumer spending ,” said
 Nick Stamenkovic , a fixed-income strategist at RIA Capital
Markets Ltd. in Edinburgh. “Unless there is a sign of a
solution to the euro debt crisis or improvement in the U.K.
economy, 10-year gilt yields should remain below 2 percent.”  The yield on the 10-year bond was little changed at 1.96
percent at 4:51 p.m.  London  time after falling to 1.917 percent,
the lowest since Bloomberg began compiling the data in 1989. The
3.75 percent bond due September 2021 rose 0.025, or 25 pence per
1,000-pound ($1,536) face amount, to 115.64.  The 30-year  yield  was also little changed at 2.99 percent
after reaching an all-time low 2.93 percent.  The U.K. unemployment rate based on International Labour
Organization methods rose to 8.4 percent, the highest since
January 1996, from 8.1 percent in the three months through
August, the  Office for National Statistics  said in London. The
number of people claiming jobless benefits increased for a 10th
month to 1.6 million.  Spread Shrinks  The spread between two- and 10-year gilt yields shrank two
basis points to 154 basis points, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The difference was as wide as 256 basis points in
July last year.  The  World Bank  cut its forecast for global growth to 2.5
percent for 2012, from a June estimate of 3.6 percent. The euro
area may shrink 0.3 percent, compared with a previous estimate
of a 1.8 percent gain, the Washington-based lender said. The
U.S. growth outlook was cut to 2.2 percent from 2.9 percent.  The pound extended this year’s decline versus the euro as
Greece and its private creditors began a final push to
renegotiate debt.  “I’m highly confident the deal will get done,” Bruce Richards, chief executive officer of New York-based Marathon
Asset Management LP, said in a telephone interview yesterday
with Bloomberg Businessweek. Marathon is on the committee of 32
private creditors formed in November to negotiate with  Greece ,
the IMF and the European Union.  IMF Boost  The euro was boosted after the  International Monetary Fund 
was said to be proposing a $500 billion expansion of its
resources to safeguard the global economy. The funds will help
guard against any worsening of the euro-area debt crisis,
according to to a person familiar with the talks.  The pound declined 0.2 percent to 83.18 pence per euro
after dropping 0.5 percent yesterday. Sterling fell 0.2 percent
to 1.4535 Swiss francs, and climbed 0.5 percent to $1.5409.  Sterling has weakened 1.2 percent this year, the worst
performer among 10 developed-nation currencies after the euro,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.  Gilts have handed investors a 0.6 percent return in 2012,
beating the 0.2 percent gains from German bonds and  U.S.
Treasuries , according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
