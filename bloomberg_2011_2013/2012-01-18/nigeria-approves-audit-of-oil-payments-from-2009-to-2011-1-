Nigeria , Africa’s biggest crude
producer, will carry out an independent audit of payments in the
country’s oil and gas industry from 2009 to 2011, Information
Minister Labaran Maku said.  “This audit will allow issues of accountability in the oil
and gas industry to be brought to the fore,” Maku told
reporters today in Abuja, the capital. “The audits will also
provide relevant information and data for the government’s anti-
corruption agenda.” An review of Nigeria’s minerals industry
between 2009 and 2010 will also be done, he said.  Nigeria is part of the so-called Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative, which aims to increase transparency in
payments to governments from the natural resources industry. The
last audit of Nigeria’s oil industry was carried out between
2006 and 2008.  Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan said this week he
would tackle corruption in the oil and gas industry and
prosecute offenders as a week-long strike against a government
decision to scrap subsidies on gasoline came to an end.  Diezani Alison-Madueke, Nigeria’s oil minister, said on
Jan. 16 she would act to end corruption and speed up reforms of
the country’s oil industry. Alison-Madueke set up a panel to
investigate the management and controls in government companies
including Nigerian National Petroleum Corp., and report to her
within 30 days.  Nigeria,  Africa ’s most populous nation with more than 160
million people, depends on oil exports for more than 80 percent
of its revenue and 95 percent of foreign-exchange income. The
West African nation earned $196 billion from oil and gas
shipments in the four years through 2010, according to the
 National Bureau of Statistics .  To contact the reporter on this story:
