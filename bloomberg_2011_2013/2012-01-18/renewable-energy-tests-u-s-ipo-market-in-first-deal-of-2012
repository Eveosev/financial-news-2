Renewable Energy Group Inc. (REGI) , the
biodiesel maker that hasn’t posted an annual profit since 2008,
will test investor demand for new shares in the first U.S.
initial public offering this year.  The Ames, Iowa-based company, which turns ingredients
including  soybean oil  into biodiesel for cars and trucks, plans
to raise as much as $108 million offering 7.2 million shares for
$13 to $15 each today, according to a regulatory filing.
Renewable will use the proceeds to buy a factory it is currently
leasing and to invest in new processing technologies.  The biodiesel maker is one of at least eight companies that
have scheduled dates to complete U.S. offerings so far this
year, even as those that went public in 2011 fell an average of
5.9 percent through Jan. 13, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Renewable is attempting the first biofuel IPO since June, when
Kior Inc. raised $162 million and then lost more than 30 percent
of its value.  “The companies on the calendar are hoping for a better
risk appetite,” said  Peter Sorrentino , who helps oversee $14.5
billion at Huntington Asset Advisors in Cincinnati as a senior
portfolio manager. “It’s been quiet for some time now.”  Renewable’s Value  The midpoint of the IPO price range would value  Renewable
Energy  at $401 million, or about 0.6 times revenue of $627
million in the 12 months through Sept. 30. That’s about three
times the comparable ratio of 0.2 for  Archer-Daniels-Midland
Co. (ADM) , the world’s largest grain processor, which has a market
value of more than $19 billion and also makes biodiesel.  Renewable is a “pure commodity business,” whose
profitability depends on how it hedges against price changes,
said  Pavel Molchanov , an analyst at Raymond James & Associates
Inc. Prices for agricultural commodities such as soybeans are
tougher to predict than diesel prices linked to crude oil
because they are affected by factors such as weather and how
many crops farmers choose to plant, he said.  Renewable has been reducing its dependence on soybean oil
since 2009 after prices of the commodity increased almost
fivefold in seven years to 70 cents a pound, according to its
filing. About 9 percent of Renewable’s feedstock was soybean oil
in 2010, compared with 22 percent in 2009, with the remainder
comprising inedible animal fat, used cooking oil and inedible
corn oil, its filing shows.  Still, “the markets for used cooking oil and inedible corn
oil are in their nascent stages,” meaning Renewable can’t make
forward contracts for its ingredients at fixed prices, the
filing shows. Losses from hedging in 2010 were $1.2 million,
higher than the $1.1 million loss in 2009.  On-Road Vehicles  Most biodiesel in the U.S. is used as part of a  blend  with
petroleum-based  diesel fuel  for on-road vehicles, according to
the filing.  Oil companies  must blend 36 billion gallons of
biofuel by 2022, including 1 billion gallons a year of biodiesel
starting in 2012, according to a U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency  regulation .  Pilot Travel Centers LLC, the operator of highway truck
stops, is Renewable’s biggest customer, accounting for 29
percent of revenue in 2010, according to the filing.  The shares, which are scheduled to price today and begin
trading tomorrow, will list on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the
symbol REGI.  UBS AG (UBSN)  and  Piper Jaffray Cos. (PJC)  are leading the
offering. Alicia Clancy, a spokeswoman for Renewable, declined
to comment.  Kior,  Gevo Inc. (GEVO)  and  Amyris Inc. (AMRS) , all backed by billionaire
 Vinod Khosla , are developing so-called advanced biofuels,
including hydrocarbons that can be processed into replacements
for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel.  Gevo, which is valued at about 2.6 times sales in the 12
months through Sept. 30, dropped 59 percent in trading through
yesterday since its IPO in February 2011. Amyris is down about
33 percent since its debut in September 2010. None of the
companies is profitable.  Annual Losses  Renewable Energy’s net income in the first nine months of
2011 was $781,000, following annual net losses from 2008 through
2010 totaling $106.3 million. The price of U.S. biodiesel fell
starting in 2008 because of anti-dumping duties imposed by the
European Union, the global financial crisis, and a higher cost
of soybean oil, according to the filing.  The company itself is offering about 6.9 million shares,
and owners including U.S. Renewables Group LLC,  Bunge Ltd. (BG) , ED&F
Man Holdings Ltd. and NGP Energy Technology Partners plan to
sell about 343,000 shares, according to the filing.  To contact the reporters on this story:
