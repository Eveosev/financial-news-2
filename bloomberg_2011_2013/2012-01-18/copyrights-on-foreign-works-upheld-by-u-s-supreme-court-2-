The  U.S. Supreme Court (1000L)  upheld a
federal law that gave copyright protection to millions of
foreign-produced books, movies and musical pieces and may
undermine  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s effort to create an online library.  Today’s 6-2 ruling backs a law that took works by  Alfred
Hitchcock ,  Pablo Picasso , Igor Stravinsky and J.R.R. Tolkien out
of the public domain, barring use without permission of the
copyright owner. The decision is a victory for the film and
music industries and a setback for Google, which had said it
would lose access to many of the 15 million books it wants to
make available online.  The court rejected arguments from orchestra conductors,
educators, performers, film archivists and movie distributors.
They argued that the 1994 law violates the constitutional
provision that lets Congress set up a copyright system, as well
as the Constitution’s free-speech guarantee.  “We have no warrant to reject the rational judgment
Congress made,” Justice  Ruth Bader Ginsburg  wrote for the
majority. Justices  Stephen Breyer  and  Samuel Alito  dissented,
and Justice Elena Kagan didn’t take part in the case.  The statute aimed to harmonize U.S. copyright law with
rules in other countries. The measure applied to works that had
been excluded from the American copyright system for various
reasons, in some cases because the U.S. didn’t have copyright
relations with the author’s home country and in other cases
because the U.S. hadn’t yet recognized copyrights on sound
recordings.  Picasso and Stravinsky  The law gave rights-holders the copyright protection they
otherwise would have had. Affected works include Tolkien’s “The
Hobbit,” hundreds of Picasso paintings, several Hitchcock films
and the music of Stravinsky, Dmitri Shostakovich and other
Russian composers.  Congress approved the law to meet obligations stemming from
the so-called  Uruguay Round  of international trade talks. The
motion-picture and music industries pushed for the provision to
secure reciprocal copyright protection for American works
abroad.  Ginsburg said that was a legitimate goal under the
Constitution’s copyright clause, which she said lets Congress
focus on encouraging the distribution of existing works, as well
as the creation of new ones.  “Congress determined that U.S. interests were best served
by our full participation in the dominant system of
international copyright protection,” Ginsburg wrote. The Obama
administration defended the law.  No New Works  In dissent, Justice Stephen Breyer said the law would limit
the dissemination of works without creating any incentives for
new ones.  The law “does not encourage anyone to produce a single new
work,” Breyer wrote. “By definition, it bestows monetary
rewards only on owners of old works -- works that have already
been created and already are in the American public domain.”  Breyer said that copyright owners often would be difficult
or impossible to track down, particularly in cases involving
older and more obscure works that have minimal commercial value.  “How is a university, a film collector, a musician, a
database compiler or a scholar now to obtain permission to use
any such lesser known foreign work previously in the American
public domain?” he wrote.  Copyright Power  Even if would-be users can track down the copyright owners,
they may face other obstacles, said Anthony Falzone, the lawyer
who represented the challengers to the law.  “It’s not always just a matter of writing a check,”
Falzone said. “Copyright owners can say, ‘No, we don’t want you
to do that. Forget about price -- we don’t want you to do it.’”  Ginsburg said those issues were “hardly peculiar” to
works affected by the 1994 law. “It similarly afflicts, for
instance, U.S. libraries that attempt to catalogue U.S. books,”
she wrote.  Supporters of the law said the impact will be less than
opponents claim. The measure lets people who were using works
before enactment of the law continue to do so until notified
that a copyright owner intends to enforce.  ‘Low-Cost Accommodation’  The law also says that people who’ve created “derivative
works” -- those based on works that now have copyright
protection -- can continue to use their creations as long as
they pay “reasonable compensation.”  “For certain types of uses, there are provisions built in
that create incentives for the parties to reach a low-cost
accommodation for use,” said Eric J. Schwartz, a Washington
lawyer who helped draft the law as an attorney at the U.S.
Copyright Office.  A Google spokesman, Jim Prosser, didn’t immediately return
a phone call seeking comment. In court papers, Google said the
law might affect as many as a million books the company has
already scanned as part of its book project.  The  Motion Picture Association  of America, which represents
the  film industry , praised the ruling.  The ruling “demonstrates that the  United States  fulfills
its international copyright obligations and will remain a world
leader in protecting creative works, thereby helping foster
their continued creation and dissemination,” Fritz Attaway, the
group’s executive vice president, said in a statement.  The case is Golan v. Holder, 10-545.  To contact the reporter on this story:
