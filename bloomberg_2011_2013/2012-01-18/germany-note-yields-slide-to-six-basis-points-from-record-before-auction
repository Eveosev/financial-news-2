Italian bonds rose for a third day
after the  International Monetary Fund  was said to propose a $500
billion expansion of its lending resources, adding to optimism
the nation will overcome its debt crisis.  Germany’s two-year  yields  were within seven basis points
from a record low after demand increased at a 3.4 billion-euro
($4.36 billion) auction of the securities. Greek 10-year yields
fell as the nation prepares to resume talks with bondholders.
Portuguese bonds dropped as it sold 11-month bills, the longest
maturity it has auctioned since it sought a rescue last year.  “You’ve only got to look at the periphery markets to see
that general sentiment there is still improving,” said  Peter Chatwell , a fixed-income strategist at Credit Agricole Corporate
& Investment Bank in  London . “The yield on the Italian 10-year
continues to trend lower. Something along the lines of a big
capital increase for the IMF offers a glimmer of hope.”  Italy’s 10-year yield fell eight basis points, or 0.08
percentage point, to 6.42 percent at 4:42 p.m. London time. The
5 percent bond due March 2022 rose 0.57, or 5.70 euros per
1,000-euro face amount, to 90.25.  The Washington-based IMF currently has $385 billion
available and wants to lift that to $885 billion after
identifying the potential for a $1 trillion global financing gap
in the next two years, according to a person familiar with the
discussions.  German Auction  Germany’s two-year yield was little changed at 0.20 percent
after sliding to a record 0.134 percent on Jan. 12.  Germany  saw “a strong auction and one that shows how, at
least in some market segments, there is still interest in
parking money nearly interest-free until sovereign risk
elsewhere is perceived to have subsided,”  Luca Jellinek , head
of European interest-rate strategy at Credit Agricole Corporate
& Investment Bank in London, wrote in an e-mailed note.  Portugal sold the maximum target of 2.5 billion euros of
securities at its auction of three-, six- and 11-month treasury
bills. The nation issued 1.25 billion euros of securities due in
December 2012 at an average yield of 4.986 percent and investors
bid for 2.1 times the amount issued, the debt management agency
said.  The yield on  Portugal ’s 10-year bond climbed 29 basis
points to 14.54 percent.  Greek Debt Talks  The Greek security maturing in October 2022 advanced for a
seventh day, with the yield sliding 11 basis points to 33.70
percent, after earlier dropping to a six-week low. The price
rose to 20.99 percent of face value. Two-year Greek yields
surged 676 basis points to 170.71 percent.  Greek Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  will meet the
Institute of International Finance’s  Charles Dallara  and  Jean Lemierre  in Athens later today to resume talks on a voluntary
swap of Greek debt.  Greece  is close to a deal with private creditors that would
give them cash and securities with a market value of about 32
cents per euro of government debt, said Bruce Richards, a hedge-
fund manager on the creditors’ committee.  “The market is very closely looking for any headlines
coming out of these meetings” on the Greek debt exchange, said
 Karsten Linowsky , a fixed-income strategist at Credit Suisse
Group AG in Zurich. “Cautious optimism is maybe priced in but
we have to see what the details look like.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
