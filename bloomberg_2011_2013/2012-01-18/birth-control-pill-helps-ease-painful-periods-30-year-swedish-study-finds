Taking  birth-control  pills
alleviates menstrual pain, according to researchers who have
been studying the effect for 30 years.  Scientists at  Sweden ’s  Gothenburg University  surveyed 1,400
Swedish women who turned 19 in 1981, 1991 and 2001 on levels of
dysmenorrhea, or pain from menstrual periods, and questioned
them again when they turned 24. Oral contraceptives reduced pain
more than increasing age did, according to the study published
today in the journal  Human Reproduction .  Dysmenorrhea accounts for an estimated 600 million lost
working hours and $2 billion in productivity costs in the U.S.,
the researchers said. The combined oral contraceptive, or COC,
pill is approved as a method of birth control in the U.S. and
European Union. The regulatory agencies would require a
randomized controlled trial for manufacturers to be able to
market the pills for dysmenorrhea. Some doctors already
prescribe it “off-label” to help with painful periods.  Using the pill “was shown to reduce dysmenorrhea severity,
and this information is important for health providers when
informing women of the non-contraceptive benefits of COC during
contraceptive counseling,” Ingela Lindh, lead researcher of the
study, said in the article.  The study was funded by the Gothenburg Medical Society, the
Hjalmar Svenssons Fund and a Swedish government grant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
