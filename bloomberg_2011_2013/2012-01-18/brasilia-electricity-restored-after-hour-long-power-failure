Electricity in  Brazil ’s capital has
been fully restored after an hour-long failure that left part of
the city without power, an official at the Brasilia’s Energy
Company said.  The blackout, which affected three other cities in the
Federal District, was caused by a storm, said the press officer,
who asked not to be identified because of internal policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
