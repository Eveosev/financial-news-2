Crude oil inventories declined 4.81
million barrels to 330.1 million last week, the  American
Petroleum Institute  said.  Gasoline stockpiles  rose 4.31 million barrels to 225.3
million.  Distillate fuel inventories  declined 900,000 barrels to
145.3 million, the APIâ€™s weekly report showed.  Inventories at Cushing, Oklahoma , the delivery point for
futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, declined
819,000 barrels to 28.3 million.  The Energy Department is scheduled to release its inventory
report at 11 a.m. tomorrow in  Washington , a day later than usual
because of the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday.  The government report may show stockpiles of crude oil rose
3 million barrels last week, according to the median of 12
responses in a  Bloomberg News (DOEASCRD)  survey of analysts. Gasoline
inventories probably gained 2.35 million barrels, the survey
showed. Distillates were expected to grow by 1.38 million.  API collects stockpile information on a voluntary basis
from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines. The
government requires that reports be filed with the Energy
Department for its weekly survey.  Crude oil for February delivery gained 32 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $101.03 a barrel at 4:31 p.m. in electronic trading
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The contract, which settled
at $100.59, traded at $100.85 before the report was released at
4:30 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
