Tim Tebow  will become a part-owner
of  D1 Sports Training ’s facility in Tampa, Florida, the company
said in a news release yesterday.  The Denver Broncos quarterback will have an undisclosed
stake in the 28,000-square-foot center, which has a turf field,
a weight room and a sports therapy clinic run in conjunction
with Westchase Sports Medicine Orthopedics, D1 said.  Tebow, 24, trained at the company’s Nashville center four
months prior to the 2010 National Football League draft and
became a co-owner of the Savannah, Georgia, location in April,
D1 said. Tebow also has agreements with  Nike Inc. (NKE) , Jockey
International Inc. and FRS Co., which sells energy drinks.  Former fullback Will Bartholomew, 31, founded D1 in 2002, a
year after he had a career-ending knee injury during training
camp with the Broncos. Bartholomew, the company’s chief
executive officer, was a member of the University of  Tennessee 
team that won a national title in 1998, a year after  Peyton Manning  left the Volunteers for the NFL.  Former Tampa Bay Buccaneers linebacker Derrick Brooks,
Atlanta Braves third baseman Chipper Jones and pro wrestler
Chris Jericho also were announced as co-owners of the Tampa
facility, which opened Jan. 2. D1, which has 14 locations
nationwide, didn’t define the term co-owner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
