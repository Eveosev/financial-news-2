Warmer weather in December in  Europe 
masked falling North Sea gas output, setting the market up for a
tightening in the coming year, Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. said.  Europe may have a shortfall of 15 billion cubic meters in
the fourth quarter as North Sea production drops by 6.5 billion
cubic meters, spurring companies to expand inventories, imports
of liquefied natural gas and pipeline volumes from Russia, said
analysts led by Oswald Clint in a note today. Output fell by 22
percent last year as the U.K. raised taxes, Bernstein said.  “The U.K. North Sea has experienced its most rapid year of
production declines on record,” it said. “Winter of 2011 was
exceptionally warm across Europe. But by the fourth quarter of
this year, the mean-reversion of European temperatures to their
long-run average levels is expected to add 8 bcm to demand.”  BG Group Plc (BG/)  is most likely to gain from the shortfall near
term because it’s able to easily divert LNG cargo from Asia.  OAO
Gazprom (GAZP) ,  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ,  Eni SpA (ENI)  and  Total SA (FP)  are also in
a good position to profit from higher prices, Bernstein said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
