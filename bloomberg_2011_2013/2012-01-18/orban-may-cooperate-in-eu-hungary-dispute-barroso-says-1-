European Commission President  Jose
Barroso  said Hungarian Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  is willing to
cooperate to resolve a conflict over a new central-bank law that
has halted international talks on aid for the nation.  The commission, the European Union’s regulatory arm,
yesterday threatened a lawsuit against Hungary for encroaching
on the central bank’s independence and also began infringement
proceedings against Orban’s government for political meddling
with the judiciary and the data-protection authority.  After the announcement yesterday, “Prime Minister Orban
addressed a letter to us showing his willingness to cooperate to
find a solution,” Barroso told reporters today in Strasbourg,
 France .  Orban is trying to revive bailout talks with the EU and the
 International Monetary Fund  after discussions broke down in
December over the prime minister’s refusal to change the
central-bank law, which has been criticized for undermining
monetary-policy independence.  In a speech to the European Parliament today, Barroso
called on Orban to address concerns about new Hungarian laws “in
a determined and unambiguous way.”  “We will not hesitate to take further steps if deemed
appropriate,” Barroso said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
