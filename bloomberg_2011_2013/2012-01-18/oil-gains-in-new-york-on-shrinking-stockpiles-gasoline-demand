Oil rose in New York on speculation
that shrinking U.S. stockpiles and increasing gasoline
consumption indicate fuel demand is rising in the world’s
biggest crude-consuming nation.  Futures advanced as much as 1 percent after the  American
Petroleum Institute  said  crude inventories  slid the most in six
weeks in the seven days ended Jan. 13. Energy Department data
today may show supplies climbed for a fourth week, according to
a Bloomberg News survey of analysts. U.S. fuel use rose 4.1
percent last week while industrial output gained in December,
separate reports showed.  “We’re seeing a creeping risk-on situation in the markets
generally,” said Ric Spooner, a chief analyst at CMC Markets in
Sydney. “On the supply side, we’ve got a bit of a sentiment
boost from those API inventory figures.”  Crude for February delivery gained as much as $1.03 to
$101.62 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange and was at $101.16 at 3:58 p.m. Singapore
time. The contract, which expires tomorrow, dropped 12 cents to
$100.59 yesterday and is up 2.4 percent this year. The more
active March contract advanced 57 cents to $101.33 today.  Brent oil for March settlement rose 38 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $111.04 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The European benchmark contract’s premium to
West Texas Intermediate futures was at $9.71, compared with
$9.90 yesterday and a record $27.88 on Oct. 14.  Oil Supplies  U.S. crude inventories dropped 4.81 million barrels last
week, the most since the week ended Dec. 2, figures from the
industry-funded API showed. They are forecast to climb  3 million
barrels  in the energy department report, according to the median
of 12 analyst estimates in the Bloomberg News survey.  Gasoline supplies rose 4.31 million barrels, the API data
showed. They are projected to increase  2.35 million barrels  in
the government report, according to the survey. Distillate
inventories, a category that includes diesel and heating oil,
fell 900,000 barrels compared with an estimate for a 1.38
million barrel gain.  The API collects stockpile information on a voluntary basis
from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines. The
government requires that reports be filed with the Energy
Department for its weekly survey. The Energy Department is
scheduled to release its inventory report at 11 a.m. in
 Washington , a day later than usual because of the Martin Luther
King Jr. holiday on Jan. 16.  50-Day Average  U.S. drivers bought 8.37 million barrels a day of gasoline
in the week ended Jan. 13, up from 8.044 million a week earlier
that was the lowest level in more than seven years, according to
MasterCard’s SpendingPulse report yesterday. The company’s data
goes back to July 2004.  Oil in New York may rise to an eight-month high above
$103.74 a barrel after failing to settle beneath a support level
at the 50-day moving average, according to technical analysis by
IAF Advisors.  “I think there are signs we are bottoming,” said  Phil Flynn , vice president of research at PFGBest in  Chicago , in an
e-mail. “Gas demand bounced a bit,” he said, citing the
Mastercard report. “Still, don’t look for a demand surge. It’s
very modest.”  Prices slipped yesterday after President  Barack Obama 
denied a permit for TransCanada Corp.’s Keystone XL pipeline
that may have reduced inventories by carrying crude from
 Alberta ’s oil sands to refineries along the U.S. Gulf Coast.  The company said it will refile a revised route to avoid an
environmentally sensitive area in  Nebraska . The 1,661-mile
(2,673-kilometer) project planned to transport 700,000 barrels
of crude a day and cross six U.S. states.  To contact the reporter on this story:
