Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  scored a victory
in 2011 as U.S. deliveries of its Prius v wagon in 10 weeks
topped sales of  General Motors Co. (GM) ’s Chevrolet Volt plug-in
hybrid that was available all year.  Toyota sold 8,399 of the hybrid wagon, which didn’t arrive
at U.S. dealerships until the last week of October, said Carly Schaffner, a spokeswoman for the company. GM delivered 7,671
rechargeable Volts in 2011 and 7,997 in the model’s first 13
months on the market. The Japanese automaker hadn’t
distinguished Prius v sales from those of the original one.  “Prius v is off to a great start,”  Jim Lentz , president
of Toyota’s U.S. sales unit, said in an e-mail this week. The
hybrid wagon starts at $26,400, Toyota said on its website. The
Volt starts at $39,145 and is eligible for as much as $7,500 in
federal tax credits.  Toyota, the largest gasoline-electric auto seller, wants to
deliver more than 220,000 vehicles bearing the Prius name this
year to U.S. customers, a 60 percent increase from 2011. That’s
to be fueled by a four-car “family” consisting of the original
hatchback, the v, the Prius c subcompact arriving in March, and
a plug-in Prius that goes about 15 miles on battery power.  GM missed its goal of selling 10,000 Volts last year. A
slow production increase kept dealers for the Detroit-based
company in short supply until December, and a federal
investigation of three fires that occurred after Volt crash
tests lowered demand for the car, according to Bandon, Oregon-
based CNW Marketing Research Inc.  Powertrain Choices  Comparing the plug-in Volt with the hybrid wagon is
“ridiculous,” said  Rob Peterson , a GM spokesman.  “Consumers cross-shop vehicles with comparable
technologies or functionality, not a new name plate,” Peterson
said by e-mail. “Comparing Volt to Prius v is apples and
oranges.”  The range of alternative-power autos available to U.S.
drivers is mushrooming as manufacturers offer vehicles powered
wholly or in part by electricity, bio-fuels, natural gas and
even hydrogen. That number will jump this year with new
offerings required to meet clean air rules in California.  Bloomberg News tracked sales of 37 such vehicles in 2011,
up from only two in 2000. Offerings include the Prius, the Volt,
 Nissan Motor Co. (7201) ’s Leaf and Honda Motor Co.’s FCX Clarity fuel-
cell sedan leased in  California .  Hybrid sales accounted for only 2.2 percent of U.S. auto
sales last year, down from 2.4 percent in 2010, according to
researcher LMC Automotive. The decline was a result of reduced
production of the Prius, which accounts for half of all hybrid
sales, after  Japan ’s natural disasters cut the supply of parts,
said Lentz, who is based at Toyota’s U.S. sales office in
Torrance, California.  Hybrids Slip  The March 2011 earthquake and tsunami temporarily halted
Prius assembly in Japan, leaving U.S. dealers with little
inventory of the car for months. Overall Prius sales fell 3.2
percent last year to 136,463.  Toyota dealers in the U.S. also sold 9,241 hybrid midsize
Camry cars, 37 percent fewer than in 2010, according to Autodata
Corp., and the Toyota City, Japan-based automaker said it
delivered 14,381 Lexus CT200h gas-electric compact luxury wagons
in the model’s first calendar year.  Nissan sold 9,674 Leaf all-electric cars in the U.S. last
year, missing its target of 10,000 to 12,000. The company said
production lost to the tsunami limited availability. The Leaf
averages about 73 miles per charge, according to the  U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency .  The Prius v wagon, larger and heavier than a standard
Prius, averages 42 miles per gallon of gasoline in combined city
and highway driving, compared with 50 mpg for the main version.
The Volt, capable of going 35 miles on battery power, has two
U.S. fuel-economy ratings: 94 mpg-equivalent when both its
lithium-ion pack and gasoline engine are used, and a combined 37
mpg when powered solely by gasoline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
