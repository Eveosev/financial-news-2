Hong Kong   stocks  advanced, with the
 Hang Seng Index (HSI)  closing at a two-month high, as a cut in the
 reserve requirements  for some lenders in  China ’s poorest
province stoked speculation further monetary easing is likely.  China Overseas Land & Investment Ltd. (688) , a state-owned
developer, climbed 2.1 percent.  AIA Group Ltd. (1299)  gained 1.6
percent as the third-largest Asia-based insurer by market
capitalization is said to be seeking advice on a possible bid
for ING Groep NV’s Asian insurance business.  Brilliance China
Automotive Holdings Ltd. (1114) , a partner of Bayerische Motoren Werke
AG, slumped 9 percent after top company executives said they
sold shares in the carmaker.  “We expect there would be a few more cuts in reserve ratio
requirements for Chinese lenders,” said Terrace Chum, the Hong
Kong-based managing director of greater China equities for
Manulife Asset Management, which oversees about $199 billion.
“Overall the liquidity environment is still pretty tight.”  The Hang Seng Index added 0.3 percent to 19,686.92 at the
close, having swung between gains and losses more than 10 times.
About six shares rose for every five that fell in the 48-member
gauge. The index advanced 3.3 percent last week amid bets Europe
will manage its debt crisis and China will ease lending curbs in
the world’s second-largest economy. The  Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of mainland companies listed in Hong Kong slid
0.1 percent to 10,952.60.  To contact the reporter on this story:
