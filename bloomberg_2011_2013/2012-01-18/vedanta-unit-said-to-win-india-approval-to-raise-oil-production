Cairn India Ltd. (CAIR) , acquired by
London-based Vedanta Resources Plc in December, won approval to
raise output from Rajasthan, a government official with direct
knowledge of the matter said.  The operator of  India ’s biggest onshore oil deposit can
increase production by 25,000 barrels a day, the official said
in  New Delhi  yesterday on condition of anonymity. Output at the
block in the western state of Rajasthan will rise 20 percent
after remaining at 125,000 barrels a day since August 2010.  “That the approval has come after all this time is great
for sentiment on the stock,” said Niraj Mansingka, a Mumbai-
based analyst at Edelweiss Securities Ltd., who has a “hold”
recommendation on  Cairn India . “The higher production has
largely been factored into earnings estimates.”  Vedanta plans to double capacity at the Cairn India assets,
while India’s government seeks to raise output of oil and gas
from its biggest fields as import costs rise and demand
increases in the world’s second-fastest growing major economy.
The oil ministry allowed  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL)  and partner BP
Plc to spend $1.5 billion to develop a new  gas field  in the
nation’s largest deposit this month.  Cairn India  fell  0.5 percent to 343.8 rupees at close in
Mumbai yesterday. The benchmark Sensitive Index declined 0.1
percent. The shares have gained 9.4 percent this year after
dropping 5.6 percent in 2011.  The Mangala field in Rajasthan can increase production to
150,000 barrels a day after approvals, Manu Kapoor, a spokesman
for Gurgaon, India-based Cairn India, said in an e-mail.  Royalty Agreement  The Rajasthan block is operated by Cairn India with a 70
percent stake, while state-run  Oil & Natural Gas Corp.  owns the
remainder. Vedanta won approval for the acquisition from the
Indian government on June 30 on condition that it pays a share
of royalties from the fields. ONGC has paid all the royalties
since output started in August 2009.  The block has three fields that may produce a combined
240,000 barrels a day, which is about 30 percent of India’s
current crude output, according to Cairn India’s  annual report 
for the year ended March 31. Production from the Rajasthan block
may rise to 175,000 barrels a day by March 31, the company said
on Oct. 21.  Vedanta and its unit Sesa Goa Ltd. completed the
acquisition of a 59 percent stake in Cairn India from
shareholders, including  Cairn Energy Plc (CNE) , for $8.67 billion in
December, 16 months after the deal was announced in August 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
