German Economy Minister Philipp
Roesler said the costs of electrical energy for German companies
and households has increased due to the subsidization of solar
power plants.  Roesler said he’ll present a proposal by next week “how we
imagine keeping the costs of solar energy under control and
stabilize them,” Roesler said today on ARD public television.
“There must be no unlimited increase” in solar power plants in
 Germany .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
