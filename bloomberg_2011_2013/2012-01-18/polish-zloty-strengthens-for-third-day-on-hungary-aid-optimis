Poland’s zloty strengthened for a
third day against the euro and dollar as speculation  Hungary 
will secure an international bailout boosted investor demand for
assets across the European Union’s east.  The zloty appreciated as much as 0.8 percent to 4.3285 per
euro, its strongest since Nov. 4, before paring the gain to 0.4
percent as of 5:23 p.m. in Warsaw. The forint surged 1.1 percent
versus the euro and the Czech koruna added 0.4 percent.  The EU yesterday threatened to sue Hungary, its most-
indebted eastern member, for restricting the central bank’s
independence in a dispute that halted bailout talks with the
 International Monetary Fund . The row can be solved in an “easy,
simple and quick” way, Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  told the
European Parliament today.  “If the forint advances, the same happens to the zloty,”
Joanna Bachert, an analyst at PKO Bank Polski SA in Warsaw, said
by phone today. “While most people on the market don’t put the
two countries in the same basket, the biggest global banks do.”  Global stocks rose and the euro and most emerging-market
currencies strengthened as the IMF proposed boosting its lending
capacity by as much as $500 billion.  To contact the reporters on this story:
