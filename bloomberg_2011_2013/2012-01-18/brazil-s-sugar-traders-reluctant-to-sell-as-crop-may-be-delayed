Sugar traders in  Brazil , the world’s
largest producer, are reluctant to sell the sweetener for
loading in May as this year’s crop may be delayed, according to
Santos, Brazil-based broker SA Commodities.  Cane harvesting in the Center South, the country’s main
producing region, may be delayed this year because of rainfall,
according to Somar Meteorologia. The crop may start only at the
end of April or the beginning of May, Marco Antonio dos Santos,
an agronomist at the weather forecaster in  Sao Paulo , said in an
e-mailed report.  “It seems that everyone is careful about selling sugar for
the first half of May,” Luiz Carlos dos Santos Jr., head of
sugar brokerage and operations at SA Commodities, wrote in a
report e-mailed yesterday.  He added that traders feared facing the same situation as
last year, when vessels started arriving at ports in the Center
South at the end of April and had to line up for a long time
because of a lack of sugar.  Traders’ reluctance to sell was reflected in the premiums
buyers had to pay to obtain sugar in the earlier part of May,
data from SA Commodities showed.  Buyers were paying 0.38 cent a pound above the price of the
May contract on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York  for sugar for
loading in May at the port of Santos, the country’s biggest,
according to data from the broker. The sweetener for loading
from May 15 to June 15 at ports in the Center South, which
includes Santos, was being offered at a premium of 0.25 cent a
pound above the futures price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
