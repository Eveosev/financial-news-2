Oil declined in New York as the
Obama administration denied a permit for  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s
Keystone XL pipeline, which would have carried crude to U.S.
Gulf Coast refineries from Alberta’s oil sands.  West Texas Intermediate oil, the U.S. benchmark, retreated
after two people familiar with the matter said the rejection was
imminent. The announcement came after the close of floor
trading. Oil climbed earlier after the Federal Reserve figures
showed that U.S. industrial output rose 0.4 percent in December.  “Inventories are going to increase because of this,” said
 Stephen Schork , president of the Schork Group in Villanova,
Pennsylvania. “There was a bet that WTI would move closer to
the world price this year” and the Keystone rejection will end
that prospect, he said.  Crude oil for February delivery fell 12 cents to settle at
$100.59 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . It dropped
to $99.84 from $100.98 on the Keystone news before rebounding.  Futures rose from the settlement after the American
Petroleum Institute reported that  oil inventories  declined 4.81
million barrels to 330.1 million last week. February crude
increased 33 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $101.04 a barrel in
electronic trading at 4:32 p.m.  Brent oil for March settlement declined 87 cents, or 0.8
percent, to end the session at $110.66 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The European contract’s
premium to March crude on the Nymex narrowed 76 cents to $9.90 a
barrel at the close of trading. That’s down from a record high
of $27.88 on Oct. 14.  Supply Report  An Energy Department report tomorrow will probably show
that U.S. crude inventories grew 3 million barrels to 337.6
million in the seven days ended Jan. 13, according to the median
of 12 analyst estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. A gain would
be the fourth in a row.  The administration will let TransCanada submit a new
application for an alternate route that avoids an
environmentally sensitive area in  Nebraska . The 1,661-mile
(2,673-kilometer) pipeline would have carried 700,000 barrels of
crude a day.  In November the administration delayed approving the
project until after the 2012 election, saying it wanted to study
an alternate route. Last month, Congress set a 60-day deadline
for the administration to decide whether to issue a permit.  “We’ll be back to the old status quo of oil,” said Rich Ilczyszyn, founder and chief market strategist at Iitrader.com
in  Chicago . “Plenty of oil coming into the Midwest and there is
no way to get it anywhere else. Locally it will be very bearish
for WTI.”  Regional Stockpiles  Inventories in Padd 2 , which includes the Midwest, climbed
to a record 107.3 million barrels on April 1. The stockpiles
fell to 92.7 million in the week ended Jan. 6, according to the
Energy Department.  Gasoline  inventories  climbed 2.35 million barrels to 226.2
million last week, the survey showed. An gain of that size would
leave supplies at the highest level since March. Stockpiles of
 distillate fuel , a category that includes heating oil and
diesel, rose 1.38 million barrels to 148.9 million barrels.  The department is scheduled to release its weekly report at
11 a.m. tomorrow in  Washington  because the government and
financial markets were closed Jan. 16 for the Martin Luther King
Jr. holiday.  Crude rose earlier on the increase of U.S. industrial
output and rising tension between Iran and  Saudi Arabia , the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries’ two leading oil
producing countries.  U.S. Economy  “The numbers from the U.S. continue to look a little
better than expected,” said  David Greely , head of energy
research at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in  New York . “We’re still
looking for prices to rise this year.”  The  International Energy Agency  reduced its global oil
consumption forecast in a monthly report today. Worldwide oil
demand will increase by 1.1 million barrels a day this year, or
200,000 less than previously estimated, to 90 million barrels,
the Paris-based IEA predicted.  “There is a $10-to-$15 Iran premium already built into the
oil process,” said  Addison Armstrong , director of market
research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. “The
IEA’s cut of its demand doesn’t paint a promising picture for
the market.”  BP Plc cut its estimate of global energy demand growth
through 2030 to 1.6 percent annually from 1.7 percent a year
ago, according to a statement on its website. Consumption will
probably grow 40 percent in the next two decades, Chief
Executive Officer  Robert Dudley  said in  London  today.  Global Growth  The  World Bank  cut its global growth forecast by the most
in three years, saying a recession in the euro region may
exacerbate a slowdown in  emerging markets .  The global economy will expand 2.5 percent this year, down
from a June estimate of 3.6 percent, according to the World Bank
in Washington. Turmoil in  Europe  has the potential to trigger a
financial crisis reminiscent of 2008, it said.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 653,909
contracts as of 4:30 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 806,747
yesterday, the highest since Dec. 13 and 34 percent above the
three-month average. Open interest was 1.38 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
