RWE AG (RWE) ,  Germany ’s second-largest
utility, said while its “fundamental approach” to the Nabucco
pipeline project to ship natural gas from the Caspian to Europe
remains unchanged, an agreement between  Turkey  and Azerbaijan
for an alternative route creates a “new situation.”  RWE Chief Executive Officer  Juergen Grossmann  said the
company may scrap its Nabucco plans, according to an interview
with the Wall Street Journal yesterday. The company said in an
e-mailed statement today that other pipeline plans don’t imply
that RWE will withdraw from Nabucco.  Turkey and Azerbaijan signed a memorandum of understanding
on Dec. 26 to build a pipeline with a capacity of 16 billion
cubic meters a year, transporting natural gas to the European
Union border. Nabucco, which would cross Turkey and cross
eastern  Europe  to Austria, is competing for Azeri supplies with
smaller projects such as Interconnector Turkey-Greece-Italy and
the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline.  “We are open for any cooperation which helps to fulfill
our aims to bring Caspian and potentially Northern Arabian gas
to Europe in the most economic way, diversify the supply sources
and routes and help to even better utilize the existing
assets,” RWE said in the statement. The new plans between
Turkey and Azerbaijan may allow RWE to lower its capital
commitment and the option should be explored, it said.  Azeri plans to build a 7 billion-euro ($9 billion) pipeline
across Turkey bringing Caspian gas to Europe may require
additional guarantees for the Nabucco project designed to ship
the fuel further westward, RWE CEO for Supply & Trading Stefan Judisch said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
