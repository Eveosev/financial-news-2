U.S. companies that beat analysts’
earnings estimates are an exception, rather than the rule, for
the fourth-quarter reporting season getting under way.  Only 47.1 percent of companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index that posted quarterly results between Dec. 1 and yesterday
exceeded the average projection, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. are among
those that trailed estimates.  As the CHART OF THE DAY illustrates, so-called positive
surprises have surpassed 50 percent at a comparable point in
every other quarterly reporting period for the past four years.
The previous low was 51.5 percent in the third quarter of 2008,
when a global financial crisis was taking hold.  “Early reporters’ results” are one of two reasons to
expect the current earnings season to be disappointing, Thomas M. Doerflinger, a strategist at UBS AG, wrote yesterday in a
report. The other is that many companies are likely to cut
estimates for this year.  Doerflinger, based in  New York , drew the latter conclusion
from a survey of 406 UBS analysts worldwide. The results, which
were published last week, showed only 7 percent of the analysts
predict companies will raise their projections. Forty-six
percent were expecting reductions.  Earnings estimates for S&P 500 companies “should fall
substantially” in the next month as they provide more precise
guidance about their prospects, the report said. Doerflinger is
anticipating a combined $99 a share for 2012. That’s the lowest
projection among 11 strategists in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
