Compagnia Italiana di Navigazione
Srl faces an in-depth European Union probe into a plan to buy
Tirrenia di Navigazione SpA,  Italy ’s insolvent state-owned ferry
operator.  The European Commission said there were “serious
competition concerns” over the high market shares held by CIN’s
owners Marinvest Srl, Grimaldi Compagnia di Navigazione SpA and
Onorato Partecipazioni Srl, which has joint control over Italian
ferry company Moby SpA. It set a deadline of June 4 to rule on
the deal.  The companies “have very high, if not monopolistic,
combined market shares on a number of maritime routes in Italy,
and in particular on certain routes to and from Sardinia,”
regulators said in an e-mailed statement.  Grimaldi, Onorato and Moby didn’t respond to e-mails for
comment outside of usual business hours. Marinvest didn’t
respond to a call for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
