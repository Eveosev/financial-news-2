Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin 
criticized the wealthiest Russians for sports spending abroad
after profiting from state asset sales in the 1990s.  “When people see that after that unfair privatization
millions and billions are being spent on sports clubs overseas
instead of investing this money into Russian sports,” the
reputation of Russian private enterprise suffers, Putin said at
a meeting outside Moscow today.  The “unjust redistribution of state property” in the
1990s is seen as the basis of today’s injustices, Putin said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
