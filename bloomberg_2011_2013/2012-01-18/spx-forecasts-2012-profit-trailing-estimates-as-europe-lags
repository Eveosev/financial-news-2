SPX Corp. (SPW) , the maker of equipment to
charge electric cars, forecast 2012 profit trailing analysts’
estimates, citing a struggling European economy and slower
growth in the U.S.  SPX may post earnings per share of $4.70 to $5.10 this
year, including 30 cents from the ClydeUnion acquisition, the
Charlotte, North Carolina-based company said in a statement.
That’s lower than a forecast of $5.27 per share, according to
the average of 12 analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  “Our 2012 guidance reflects our view of continued above
average growth in emerging markets, a slow-growth  U.S. economy 
and a cautious outlook on the economic environment in Europe,”
the company said in the statement.  SPX forecast revenue of $6 billion to $6.25 billion for
2012, representing 9 percent to 14 percent growth from 2011.
That compares to $6.13 billion, according to the average
estimate of 9 analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
