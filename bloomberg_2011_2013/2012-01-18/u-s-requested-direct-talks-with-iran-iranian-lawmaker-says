The U.S. requested “direct talks”
with  Iran  in a letter sent earlier this month, Iranian
parliamentary member Ali Motahari said, according to the state-
run  Fars  news agency.  “In this letter, they said the closure of the Strait of
Hormuz is a red line as well as asking for direct talks with
Iran,” Motahari told Fars in an interview. President  Barack Obama  “has announced readiness to hold negotiations and resolve
mutual problems,” he said.  The Islamic Republic News Agency reported on Jan. 15 that
Iran had received a letter from the U.S. concerning the Strait
of Hormuz, which Iranian officials have threatened to close if
the U.S. and its allies impose sanctions on Iran’s oil sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
