Anne Sinclair , the wife of former
International Monetary Fund chief  Dominique Strauss-Kahn , was
named editor of the French version of the  Huffington Post .  Sinclair will unveil the French-language news and opinion
website at a Jan. 23 press conference in Paris with Huffington’s
founder  Arianna Huffington .  “I am very happy to go back to work,” Sinclair told  Elle
magazine  in an interview to be published tomorrow.  New York-born Sinclair, 61, helmed the most-watched
television show in  France  until she quit in 1997 after marrying
then Finance Minister Strauss-Kahn.  Strauss-Kahn was charged last year in a sexual assault case
by a maid at a Manhattan hotel. He denied the charges and the
case was thrown out in August even though police determined that
there had been a sexual encounter between him and his accuser.  “I’m not a saint, I’m not a victim, I’m a free woman,”
Sinclair said in the Elle interview, her first since the May
arrest of her husband in  New York .  Strauss-Kahn, or DSK, as he’s popularly known in France,
was a potential  Socialist Party  contender for the French
presidency. He called his encounter with the Manhattan Sofitel
hotel chambermaid a “moral failing” and apologized to his
family, friends, and to “the French people” in an interview on
TF1 television in September.  Sinclair is the granddaughter of Paul Rosenberg, France’s
biggest art merchant in the first half of the 20th century. In
the Elle interview she said, “no one knows what happens in a
couple’s private life and I deny anyone the right to judge
mine.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
