Ravi Ranjit, chief manager in Mumbai
at Federal Bank Ltd., comments on the outlook for  India ’s rupee
in the forward market.  The rupee advanced 0.2 percent to 50.62 per dollar as of
11:01 a.m. in Mumbai, taking this month’s gains to 4.8 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The one-year onshore
dollar-rupee forward contract traded at 53.45, or a 5.6 percent
annualized premium to the onshore rate.  “If exporters panic and begin selling dollars, then we
could see the one-year forward premium dropping to around 5
percent. The decline won’t be too large as the spot dollar
should see support around 50.  ‘‘After all the pain in 2011, the measures by the
authorities are finally bearing fruit but there are still
several uncertainties in the global environment and we are
unlikely to see a huge rupee rally.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
