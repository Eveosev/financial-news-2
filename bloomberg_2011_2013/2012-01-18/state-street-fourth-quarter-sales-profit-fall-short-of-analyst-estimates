State Street Corp. (STT) , the third-
largest custody bank, said fourth-quarter net income on an
operating basis rose 4.4 percent as the company won new
customers and cut costs.  Profit climbed to $454 million, or 93 cents a share, from
$435 million, or 87 cents, a year earlier, the Boston-based
company said today in statement. Excluding certain items, 21
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg  estimated  earnings of 94 cents a
share on average.  “The new business they’re bringing in, plus expense
savings, are what’s driving the year-on-year gains,” Brian Bedell, an analyst with ISI Group Inc. in  New York , said in a
telephone interview before results were released. Bedell
expected State Street to earn 94 cents a share.  Custody banks, hurt by record-low  interest rates  that
reduce the return on investments and lending, have worked to
buoy profits by cutting expenses. State Street and its largest
rival, New York-based  Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK) , have made
or planned a combined 3,750 job cuts in the past 13 months as
each company aimed to reduce costs by more than $575 million
annually by 2015. Northern Trust, the third-largest independent
U.S. custody bank, said today it will cut about 700 jobs as part
of expense-saving measures.  Custody Assets  State Street saved about $80 million last year through the
job cuts and investments in technology, and will reduce costs by
an estimated $170 million this year, Robert Lee, an analyst with
Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc. in New York, wrote in a research
note published Jan. 9.  Revenue increased 13 percent to $2.32 billion, led by a 30
percent rise in  securities lending , while expenses declined 0.4
percent from a year earlier. Compensation and employee benefits
declined 6.7 percent.  “Our results for 2011 also demonstrated the positive
impact of expense controls we put in place,” Chief Executive
Officer Joseph L. Hooley said in the statement.  Custody fees fell 0.7 percent to $1.06 billion. Assets
under custody were $15.9 trillion as of Dec. 31, little changed
from a year earlier, even as the MSCI ACWI Index of global
stocks declined 9.4 percent in 2011. State Street won about $825
billion in new custody assets through the first nine months of
2011, according to the company.  Investment management fees declined 8.6 percent to $202
million as the amount of money State Street manages for clients
fell 7.2 percent to $1.87 trillion.  ‘Turmoil in  Europe ’  The decrease in assets reflected customer withdrawals in
cash,  fixed income  and active equities “amid the turmoil in
Europe,” the company said in the statement.  Net income rose more than fourfold to $371 million compared
with the fourth quarter of 2010, when the company spent $500
million cutting jobs and restructuring its investment portfolio.  State Street’s operating profit excludes those items as
well as money earned from the sale or maturing of bonds whose
value was written down in May 2009, which the company records as
“discount accretion” within net interest income.  Custody banks keep records, track performance and lend
securities for institutional investors including mutual funds,
pension funds and  hedge funds . State Street also manages
investments for individuals and institutions.  Results were announced before the start of regular U.S.
trading. State Street declined 14 percent in the year through
yesterday, compared with the 21 percent decrease by the Standard
& Poor’s 20-company index of asset managers and custody banks.  BNY Mellon and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , both based in New
York, are the two biggest custody banks.  (State Street is scheduled to hold a conference call for
