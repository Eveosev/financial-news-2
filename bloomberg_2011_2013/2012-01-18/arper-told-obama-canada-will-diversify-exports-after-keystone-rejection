Canadian Prime Minister  Stephen
Harper  told President Barack Obama in a telephone call today
that Canada will seek to diversify its energy exports, after the
U.S. rejected a plan to build a pipeline to carry Canadian oil.  Obama called Harper to tell him the U.S. had denied a
permit for  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Keystone XL oil pipeline,
according to details of the call provided by Harper’s office.  Harper “expressed his profound disappointment with the
news,” according to the statement.  Obama told Harper the rejection was not based on the
project’s merit and that the company is free to re-apply. Harper
told Obama he hoped the project would continue given its
importance to growth in both countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
