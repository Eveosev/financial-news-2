The  European Central Bank  said it
will lend $5.9 billion to euro-area banks for seven days.  The Frankfurt-based central bank said it will provide the
funds tomorrow to 14 banks at a fixed rate of 0.59 percent. Last
week banks borrowed $5.7 billion. The ECB doesn’t disclose the
identity of the banks it lends to.  Demand for dollars from European banks surged last month
after the ECB coordinated with the  Federal Reserve  to cut in
half the cost of borrowing in the currency, as part of a global
effort to mitigate a credit shortage worsened by the euro
region’s sovereign debt crisis.  The cost for European banks to borrow dollars in the market
fell to the lowest in more than four months today. The three-
month cross-currency basis swap, the rate banks pay to convert
euro interest payments into dollars, was 79 basis points below
the euro interbank offered rate at 8:26 a.m. in  London . That’s
the lowest cost since Aug. 30 and compares with minus 83
yesterday.  European banks need dollars to fund their own lending in
the U.S. as well as to clients elsewhere doing business in the
world’s leading reserve currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
