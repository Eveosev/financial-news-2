Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , India’s
biggest company by market value, will consider buying back
shares for the first time in more than seven years after the
stock slumped 35 percent in 2011.  The plan will be discussed at the company’s board meeting
on Jan. 20, the Mumbai-based energy explorer and refiner said
today in a stock exchange filing. Reliance didn’t specify the
number of shares that may be repurchased or give a timeframe.  Reliance, controlled by billionaire  Mukesh Ambani , is
struggling to boost its share price as natural gas output from
its biggest field and profit from its refineries decline. The
company has sought ways to use the 614.9 billion rupees ($12.2
billion) in  cash  and equivalents it held as of Sept. 30.  “We now have some clarity on how it can use all this
money,” said  Deepak Pareek , a Mumbai-based analyst at Prabhudas
Lilladher Pvt. who has an “accumulate” rating for the stock.
“This is a good way to boost the share price.”  Reliance  shares  rose 5.1 percent to 779.75 rupees in Mumbai,
the biggest two-day gain since May 19, 2009. The stock has
gained 13 percent this year, compared with a 6.5 percent
increase in the benchmark  Sensitive Index. (SENSEX)   Profit Decline  Reliance, scheduled to announce third-quarter earnings on
Jan. 20, may report its first profit decline in more than two
years. Net income may fall more than 12 percent to  45.6 billion
rupees  in the three months ended Dec. 31 from a year earlier,
according to the median estimate of 23 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  The company last offered to repurchase shares in December
2004, spending 30 billion rupees to buy 10 percent of its equity
at 570 rupees apiece.  Natural gas output from  India ’s KG-D6 block, operated by
Reliance, declined to as low as 39 million cubic meters a day,
half of a target peak production rate of 80 million cubic meters
a day, Oil Secretary G.C. Chaturvedi said Dec. 21. The deposit
produced about 60 million cubic meters a day of the clean-
burning fuel in June 2010.  Reliance sold 30 percent stake in the block, along with 20
other fields in India, to BP Plc last year for $7.2 billion. It
expected to get the London-based company’s technology and
expertise to help raise output.  Reliance also operates two crude oil refineries with a
total capacity of 1.24 million barrels a day, making it the
world’s biggest such complex at a single location. The
refineries have the capability to turn cheaper, low-quality
crude oil into high-value products.  China  Capacity  Refineries in Asia Pacific will add the most capacity next
year as China brings 730,000 barrels a day of production online,
mainly for gasoline, according to a note by Bank of America Corp.
analyst Sabine Schels dated Oct. 5. Additional capacities will
shrink refining margins as fuel supplies rise.  Margins at refineries in Singapore processing Dubai crude
averaged $4.62 a barrel in the three months ended Dec. 31,
compared with $6.18 a barrel the previous quarter, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The margin expanded to $9.64 a
barrel of Oct. 5 and shrank to a low of $0.91 on Nov. 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
