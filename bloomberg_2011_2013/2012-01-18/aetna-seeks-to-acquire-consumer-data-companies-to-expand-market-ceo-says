Aetna Inc. (AET) , the third-largest U.S.
health insurer, will seek to buy consumer-data companies to help
find new customers who buy individual policies, Chief Executive
Officer Mark Bertolini said today.  The health-care overhaul calls for people without coverage
to shop in state-based exchanges for subsidized medical coverage
starting in 2014. The change will lead employers to shift more
medical costs to employees, and Hartford, Connecticut-based
Aetna will have to learn to market to those potential customers,
Bertolini said. Individual policies accounted for 2 percent of
Aetna’s  health-care membership  as of Sept. 30, the company said
Dec. 15 in a presentation.  “We need to be more of a retail-based company,” Bertolini
said in a telephone interview. “We’re not anywhere near where
we need to be.”  The insurer today unveiled a redesign of its company logo,
the seventh time the brand has been refreshed in 160 years,
Bertolini said. The change highlights a focus on individual
care, the company said in a statement.  “We need to think about the way people get consumer retail
products,” Bertolini said. With better data and analysis, Aetna
can target people by age group and other demographics, he said.  Aetna also will continue to consider purchasing providers
of Medicare and Medicaid, Bertolini said. Medicare is the U.S.
health program for the elderly and disabled and Medicaid is the
plan for the poor.  Aetna rose less than 1 percent to $44.91 at the close of
trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
