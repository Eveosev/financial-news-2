The  FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index (JALSH) 
advanced for a third day, climbing 0.4 percent to 33,550.09 by
the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg, reversing an earlier decline.  The following are among the most active equities in the
South African market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Blackstar Group SE (BCK)  (BCK SJ), an  investment company , rose
5.4 percent to 10 rand, its biggest gain since at least August.
Blackstar said it bought 28 percent of Mvelaphanda Group Ltd. a

investment company that would’ve been more expensive.  Clicks Group Ltd. (CLS)  , a retailer of toiletries, music
and pharmaceuticals, slid 3.3 percent to 42.20 rand, falling for

divisions held back revenue growth in the last weeks of 2011,
the company said yesterday.  Datatec Ltd. (DTC)  , a Johannesburg-based computer
services company, added 3.3 percent to 44.20 rand, the highest
level since 2007. The company expects to pay a final capital

Executive Officer  David Brown  resigned.  Grindrod Ltd. (GND)  ,  Africa ’s largest shipping company,
rose the most in two weeks, climbing 2.2 percent to 14.50 rand.

terminal concession in Mozambique to energy trader Vitol Group
for $67.7 million.  Taste Holdings Ltd. (TAS)  , a consumer brand holding
company, increased 7.6 percent to 2.12 rand, a record high. The
