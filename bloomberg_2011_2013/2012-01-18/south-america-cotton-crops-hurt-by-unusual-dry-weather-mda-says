Cotton farmers in Argentina,
 Paraguay  and Brazil will lose output after a prolonged dry spell
damaged some crops, according to MDA Information Systems.  “Dryness has certainly caused some notable stress and
losses on the cotton crops,” which got less than half their
normal rainfall, Don Keeney, a senior agricultural meteorologist
at Gaithersburg, Maryland-based MDA, said in an e-mail today.  Fields across the affected areas got about 124 millimeters
(4.9 inches) of rainfall from Nov. 19 to Jan. 17, compared with
an average of 259 millimeters for that period in the last 30
years, Keeney said.  Recent rains in western Brazil, the world’s fifth-largest
grower, were too late to help crops and may hurt plants because
“they are in open boll,” Keeney said. “The only area that did
not see significant stress this season was northwest  Argentina 
and northwest Paraguay.”  China is the biggest producer, followed by  India , the U.S.
and  Pakistan .  Cotton for March delivery declined 2 percent to 96.21 cents
a pound by 12:54 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. The price
tumbled 37 percent last year, its biggest annual slump since
2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
