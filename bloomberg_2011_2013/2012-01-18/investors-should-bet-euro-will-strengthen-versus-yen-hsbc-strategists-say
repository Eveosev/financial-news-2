The euro is poised to strengthen
about 4 percent against the yen, HSBC Holdings Plc strategists,
led by  David Bloom , wrote in an e-mailed report today.  “The balance of risks for the yen seems to have shifted
towards a retracement, especially against the euro,” they
wrote.  Investors should buy the euro at 98.40 yen and sell it once
it has appreciated to 102.50 yen, HSBC recommended. They should
exit the trade if  Europe ’s shared currency weakens to 95.95 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
