Ecorodovias Infraestrutura e
Logistica SA (ECOR3)  fell the most in five months on speculation the
Brazilian highway operator offered too big a discount to win a
concession.  Shares dropped 5.4 percent to 12.10 reais at 12:07 p.m. in
 Sao Paulo , the biggest intraday decline since Aug. 8. The
benchmark Bovespa index gained 0.4 percent.  Consorcio Rodovia da Vitoria, a partnership led by
Ecorodovias, won a 2.15 billion reais ($1.2 billion) contract to
operate a 476-kilometer highway on the Brazilian coast for 25
years after offering to charge 0.03391 centavos in tolls per
kilometer, a discount of 45.6% to maximum rate allowed by the
auction rules.  “The 46% discount proposed by ECOR looks too aggressive,”
analysts from BTG Pactual SA wrote in a note sent to clients
today.  Brazil  may auction licenses to operate two more highways by
May, Bernardo Figueiredo, head of the land transportation agency
ANTT, told reporters in Sao Paulo today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
