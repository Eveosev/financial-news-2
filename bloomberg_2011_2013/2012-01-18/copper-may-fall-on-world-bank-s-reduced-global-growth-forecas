Copper futures rose to a 17-week
high as reports showing gains in U.S.  manufacturing  and
homebuilder sentiment bolstered prospects for metal demand.  Factory output rebounded in December, climbing the most in
a year as production of business equipment, automobiles and
construction materials rose, figures from the  Federal Reserve 
showed today. A National Association of Home Builders/Wells
Fargo gauge showed homebuilder confidence rose in January to the
highest in more than four years. Stocks rose, driving the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to a five-month high.  “The U.S. economic data is supporting equities, and copper
is moving with that,”  Adam Klopfenstein , a market strategist at
Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago, said in a telephone
interview. “Any time you see positive news out of the housing
sector, that’s bullish for copper.”  Copper futures for March delivery gained 0.6 percent to
settle at $3.7525 a pound at 1:19 p.m. on the Comex in  New York .
Earlier, the price reached $3.7595, the highest for a most-
active contract since Sept. 21.  On the  London  Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months climbed 0.5 percent $8,239 a metric ton ($3.74 a pound).
Earlier, the price fell as much as 1 percent after the  World
Bank  cut its forecast for global economic growth.  Zinc, lead and tin also advanced in London, while nickel
and aluminum fell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
