Germany ’s policy of exempting power-
intensive industry from renewable-energy subsidies is increasing
costs for other users, an electricity-consumer lobby said.  Bund der Energieverbraucher e.V. filed a complaint with the
European Commission because the practice may violate European
Union law, it said in an e-mailed statement today. It plans to
meet with representatives of the EU’s regulatory arm on Feb. 2.  “The privileges of the industry have gotten out of hand at
the expense of the remaining consumers,” Aribert Peters, head
of the lobby organization, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
