Australia  is seeking to resume
shipments of kangaroo meat to  Russia , which imposed a ban in
2009 after cases of bacterial contamination were discovered.  Australia has also asked Russia to allow more meat
producers to ship other animal products to the newly formed
Customs Union of Russia, Belarus and  Kazakhstan , Russiaâ€™s
agricultural-safety watchdog said today in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
