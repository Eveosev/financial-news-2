Safaricom Ltd. (SAFCOM) , East Africa’s
biggest mobile-phone operator, closed unchanged after advancing
to its highest level in five months on increased demand from
foreign investors.  The stock gained as much as 3.1 percent to 3.35 shillings,
the highest since Aug. 17, before closing unchanged at 3.25
shillings.  “Demand is still very high, coming from foreign investors,
which is pushing the stock up,” Gregory Waweru, a research
analyst at Nairobi-based Kestrel Capital East Africa Ltd., said
in a phone interview today. “They want to invest in Safaricom
which is attractive compared to other telecom companies in
Africa”.  Safaricom has a price-to-earnings ratio of 10.03 compared
with South African mobile-phone company,  MTN Group Ltd. (MTN) , which
has a price-earnings-ratio of 16.72 and  Vodacom Group Ltd. (VOD) ,
which has a ratio of 13.49, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
