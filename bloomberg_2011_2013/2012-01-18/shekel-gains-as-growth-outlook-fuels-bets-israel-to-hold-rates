Israel ’s shekel strengthened for a
second day on investor speculation the central bank may hold off
cutting rates this month as the economy grows at a faster pace
than many advanced countries.  The shekel gained as much as 0.8 percent against the dollar
to 3.8032, the highest since Jan. 3. The currency was at 3.8046
at 5:55 p.m. in  Tel Aviv . The yield on Israel’s 5.5 percent
bonds due in January 2022 dropped for the first time in four
days, declining four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to
4.47 percent.  Israel’s economy will grow 3.2 percent in 2012, Finance
Minister Yuval Steinitz told a parliamentary committee in
 Jerusalem  today, while the  World Bank  expects global growth of
2.5 percent. The  Bank of Israel  kept its  benchmark rate 
unchanged at 2.75 percent in December, saying it wanted to
retain its ability to react to developments.  “The local economy is still expanding at a fairly good
pace and the central bank may wait and hold  interest rates  this
month to cut rates in coming months,” Eytan Admoni, head of the
international department at Bank of Jerusalem Ltd., said by
telephone.  Two-year interest-rate swaps, an indicator of investor
expectations for rates over the period, held at 2.54 percent,
the highest level since Dec. 14. The next rate decision is
scheduled for Jan. 23. Admoni expects the benchmark lending rate
will fall to 2 percent by year end.  Consumer Prices  The yield on inflation-linked bonds due June 2013 declined
for a second day, retreating less than one basis point to 0.48
percent. The two-year break-even rate, the yield difference
between the inflation-linked bond and fixed-rate government
bonds of similar maturity, increased seven basis points to 207,
implying an average annual inflation rate of 2.07 percent.  Consumer prices in Israel are “relatively high,” in
comparison with other members of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development, the Bank of Israel said today.
Prices may rise 2.3 percent in the next 12 months, according to
a survey of economists released by the central bank on Jan. 17.  The Bank of Israel’s composite state-of-the-economy index
rose a preliminary 0.2 percent in December, the central bank
said today.  The  Tel-Bond 40 index  of corporate bonds declined 0.1
percent to 263.76.  Mizrahi-Tefahot Bank Ltd. (MZTF)  said today it is more than
doubling the size of a bond offering to about 1 billion shekels
($263 million) after the institutional stage of the sale was
more than five times oversubscribed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
