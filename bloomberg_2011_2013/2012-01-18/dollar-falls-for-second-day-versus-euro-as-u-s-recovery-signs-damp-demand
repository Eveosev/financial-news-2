The dollar fell against the euro
before U.S. data today forecast to show industrial production
rose and confidence among homebuilders increased, reducing
demand for safer assets. The greenback slid 0.3 percent to
$1.2770 per euro as of 11:09 a.m. Tokyo time from yesterday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
