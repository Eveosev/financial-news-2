(Corrects first paragraph to remove reference to Google
shutting services.)  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) , the world’s largest
software maker, said it opposes an anti-piracy measure being
considered by the  U.S. Congress , though it won’t follow other
companies in shutting services to protest.  Microsoft said in an e-mailed statement that it opposes the
current version of the Stop Online Piracy Act, a bill before the
U.S. House of Representatives aimed at cracking down on the sale
of counterfeit goods.  “We oppose the passage of the SOPA bill as currently
drafted,” Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said. “Hundreds
of millions of customers rely on our services every day so we
don’t plan to shut those down to express our view.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
