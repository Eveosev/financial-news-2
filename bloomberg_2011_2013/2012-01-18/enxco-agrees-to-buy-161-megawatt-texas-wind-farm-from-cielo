Enxco, the North American renewable
energy unit of EDF SA, agreed to buy a 161-megawatt wind farm in
 Texas  from Cielo Wind Power LP.  The Spinning Spur wind project will cover more than 28,000
acres in Oldham County, and will have 70  Siemens AG (SIE)  2.3-megawatt
turbines, San Diego-based Enxco said today in a statement that
didn’t give a price.  The “fast-approaching expiration of the federal production
tax credit program opens new opportunities to partner with
strong developers like Cielo,” Enxco Chief Executive Officer
Tristan Grimbert said in the statement. “We believe now is the
right time to enter the Texas market.”  The production tax credit, which offers developers 2.2
cents a kilowatt-hour for electricity produced from wind, will
expire at the end of the year unless Congress extends it.  Cielo, based in Austin, Texas, has developed almost 1,400
megawatts of projects in Texas and  New Mexico , according to the
statement.  Electricity generated by Spinning Spur will be sold to
Southwestern Public Service Company, a subsidiary of  Xcel Energy
Inc. (XEL)   Wanzek Construction Inc. is scheduled to begin building the
project in June and complete it by December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
