Australia ’s dollar fell for the
first time in three days against its U.S. counterpart after a
government report showed the nation’s employers unexpectedly cut
jobs in December.  New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, slid from the
highest level in 11 weeks after consumer prices unexpectedly
dropped in the fourth quarter. The Aussie fell against all of
its 16 most-traded peers except the yen and kiwi before a Jan.
25 report on consumer prices that may prompt investors to
increase bets on an interest-rate cut next month from the
 Reserve Bank  of Australia.  “The knee-jerk reaction was to take the Aussie dollar
lower,” said  Mike Jones , a currency strategist at Bank of  New
Zealand  in Wellington. “We’ll probably need to see a weakish-
looking CPI number next week to really make the case for a cut
from the RBA.”  Australia’s dollar fell 0.2 percent to $1.0415 at 11:47
a.m. New York time. It rose 0.3 percent to 80.45 yen.  The  New Zealand dollar  fell 0.3 percent to 80.17 U.S. cents
from yesterday, when it climbed to as high as 80.82 cents, the
most since Nov. 1. It gained 0.2 percent to 61.95 yen.  The number of people  employed  in Australia fell by 29,300,
the statistics bureau said today. The median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey was for an increase of 10,000.  Traders are betting RBA Governor  Glenn Stevens  will lower
rates for a third straight meeting when policy makers meet on
Feb. 7, with a Credit Suisse Group AG  index  based on swaps
indicating an 86 percent chance the benchmark will be cut by a
quarter of a percentage point. The rate is 4.25 percent now.  New Zealand’s currency ended a two-day rally against the
greenback after a statistics bureau report showed consumer
prices declined 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter from the
previous three-month period, when they advanced 0.4 percent.-  To contact the reporter on this story:
