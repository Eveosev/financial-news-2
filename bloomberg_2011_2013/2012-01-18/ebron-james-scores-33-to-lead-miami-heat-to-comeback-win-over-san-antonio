LeBron James  had 33 points and 10
assists and the Miami Heat recovered from a 14-point halftime
deficit to defeat the San Antonio Spurs 120-98 in a National
Basketball Association contest.  The Heat (9-4), who were missing injured All-Star guard
Dwyane Wade, outscored the Spurs 39-12 in the third quarter last
night at AmericanAirlines Arena in Miami. Wade is sidelined with
a sprained right ankle.  Chris Bosh  added 30 points for Miami.  Tony Parker had 18 points for the Spurs, who have lost all
five of their road games this year while winning all nine of
their home contests.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
