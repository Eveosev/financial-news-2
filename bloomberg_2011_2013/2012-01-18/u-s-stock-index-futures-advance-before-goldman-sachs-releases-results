U.S. stocks rose, giving the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index its best start to a year since 1987,
after confidence among homebuilders topped forecasts,  Goldman
Sachs (GS)  Group Inc. rallied and concern about  Europe  eased.  Goldman Sachs climbed 6.8 percent as earnings beat
estimates amid lower compensation costs.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) 
and  JPMorgan (JPM)  Chase & Co. jumped at least 4.6 percent, leading
the gains in the  Dow Jones Industrial Average .  PulteGroup Inc. (PHM) 
and Lennar Corp. added more than 4.3 percent, pacing an advance
in homebuilders. A measure of  chipmakers  rose the most in the
S&P 500 among 24 industries, rallying 3.9 percent.  The S&P 500 increased 1.1 percent to 1,308.04 at 4 p.m. New
York time, closing above 1,300 for the first time since July.
The Dow advanced 96.88 points, or 0.8 percent, to 12,578.95. The
Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 1.5 percent to 2,769.71. The
Russell 2000 Index jumped 1.8 percent to 779.26.  “It’s great to see the market up,” John Carey, a Boston-
based  money manager  at Pioneer Investments, said in a telephone
interview. The firm oversees about $220 billion. “People are
realizing that Europe is important, but it’s not the whole
world. They are looking at the economic numbers in the U.S. and
seeing that we’re not going back into a recession. The economy
is still growing. We might be all right at the end of the day.”  The S&P 500 has risen 4 percent this year as  measures  of
commodity, financial and industrial shares rallied at least 6.4
percent. The Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index of companies most-
tied to the economy has surged 11 percent in 2012, with  Alcoa
Inc. (AA)  and  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  soaring at least 15 percent.  Highest Since 2007  Stocks climbed today as  confidence  among U.S. homebuilders
rose in January to the highest level since 2007. Equities
extended gains as an official told reporters that  Greece ’s
government could forge an agreement with private creditors by
the end of this week after talks resumed in Athens today. The
 International Monetary Fund  is proposing to raise its lending
capacity by as much as $500 billion to safeguard the economy.  “Investors need a new excuse to commit more capital,”
 Michael Shaoul , chairman of Marketfield Asset Management in New
York, which oversees $1.3 billion, said in a telephone
interview. “The acute stress of Europe has moderated. Given
that we already have good economic data, the most obvious new
excuse is earnings. I would expect a decent earnings season.”  Companies in the benchmark index, which beat  profit 
estimates in the previous 11 quarters, probably will report a
4.6 percent increase in per-share earnings during the September-
December period, analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg show.  Homebuilders Rally  Nine out of 10  industries  in the S&P 500 rallied as
financial and technology gauges advanced at least 1.6 percent. A
gauge of homebuilders in S&P indexes climbed 4.6 percent.
PulteGroup added 5.9 percent to $7.94.  Lennar (LEN)  jumped 4.4 percent
to $23.  Goldman Sachs rose 6.8 percent to $104.31. Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein cut compensation 21 percent in 2011
as he reduced costs and focused on international growth to
offset a slowdown in trading, which contributes most of the
firm’s revenue. Goldman Sachs’s higher-than-estimated earnings
contrasted with previous reports from  Citigroup Inc. (C) , which fell
short of analysts’ estimates, and JPMorgan, which matched
projections.  Some of the largest financial companies also climbed. Bank
of America advanced 4.9 percent to $6.80. JPMorgan added 4.7
percent to $36.54.  Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK)  fell 4.6 percent to $20.30.
The world’s biggest custody bank said fourth-quarter earnings
declined 26 percent on a  restructuring charge  and lower revenue
from businesses tied to financial markets.  Sales Forecast  The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index surged 5 percent as
all of its 30 stocks advanced.  Linear Technology Corp. (LLTC)  jumped 12
percent, the most in the S&P 500, to $33.32. The maker of
semiconductors for industrial equipment and cars forecast fiscal
third-quarter sales that would beat analysts’ estimates.  Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO)  gained 3.2 percent to $15.92 as Jerry Yang’s
exit may remove a barrier to find a buyer or negotiate a sale of
stakes in Asian assets valued at more than $10 billion. Now that
the co-founder and one-time chief executive officer has cut his
leadership ties to Yahoo, newly appointed CEO Scott Thompson has
freer rein to unwind the company’s part-ownership of Alibaba
Group Holding Ltd. and Yahoo Japan Corp.  U.S. companies that  beat  analysts’ earnings estimates are
an exception, rather than the rule, for the fourth-quarter
reporting season getting under way. Only 47.1 percent of
companies in the  S&P 500  that posted quarterly results between
Dec. 1 and yesterday exceeded the average projection, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Financial Crisis  So-called positive surprises have surpassed 50 percent at a
comparable point in every other quarterly reporting period for
the past four years. The previous low was 51.5 percent in the
third quarter of 2008, when a global financial crisis was taking
hold.  “Early reporters’ results” are one of two reasons to
expect the current earnings season to be disappointing, Thomas M. Doerflinger, a strategist at UBS AG, wrote yesterday in a
report. The other is that many companies are likely to cut
estimates for this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
