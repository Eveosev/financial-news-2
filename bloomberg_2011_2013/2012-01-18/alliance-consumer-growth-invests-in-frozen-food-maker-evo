(Corrects to remove reference to granola venture in second
paragraph of a story published Jan. 18.)  Alliance Consumer Growth , the New
York-based private-equity firm focused on consumer-products
brands, is making a minority investment in frozen-meal maker
Evol Foods.  The investment will help Boulder, Colorado-based Evol
increase distribution and add menu items, according to a
statement today. Founded in 2004 by Phil Anson, Evol counts
pizza and burritos among its products. Brendan Synnott and Tom
Spier also own part of the company and serve as executives.  ACG declined to disclose the terms of the investment. The
firm, co-founded by Trevor Nelson, Julian D. Steinberg and Josh
Goldin, raised $40 million for its first fund targeting emerging
consumer-product companies in September. The firm has invested
in cleaning-product company  KAS Direct LLC , which makes
BabyGanics and PawGanics, as well as pet-food maker The Honest
Kitchen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
