Taiwan ’s dollar strengthened and
 government bonds  were little changed before the week-long
Chinese New Year holiday starts on Jan. 23.  Global funds bought $112 million more local shares than
they sold today, the last session of stock and debt trading
before the holiday, exchange data show. A government report on
Jan. 20 will show export orders fell 0.5 percent in December
from a year earlier, after gaining 2.5 percent the previous
month, according to the median estimate of economists in a
Bloomberg survey. That would be the first decline since
September 2009.  “Trading volumes have significantly decreased due to the
holiday,” said  Henry Lin , a Taipei-based foreign-exchange
trader at Taiwan Shin Kong Commercial Bank. “Some exporters
sold the greenback today.”  The  Taiwan dollar  rose 0.1 percent to NT$29.978 against its
U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. The yield on
the 1.25 percent notes due September 2021 was steady at 1.285
percent, prices from Gretai Securities Market show.  The  overnight money-market rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, was little changed at 0.40 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
