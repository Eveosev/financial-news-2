OPEC’s December crude production
rose to the highest level in more than three years and is set to
climb further this month, the  International Energy Agency  said.  Daily supply from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries’ 12 members rose by 240,000 barrels a day last month
to 30.89 million barrels, on a “rapid recovery” in Libyan
supplies and higher output from Saudi Arabia and the  United Arab
Emirates , the Paris-based agency said today in its monthly oil
market report. That’s up from 30.64 million in November.  Production exceeded the group’s output ceiling of 30
million barrels a day, which was set at its Dec. 14 meeting in
Vienna, the IEA said. The new limit includes supplies from Iraq
for the first time in more than two decades. OPEC pumped 30.82
million in December, according to the group’s Jan. 16 report.  “OPEC supply is on course to rise further in January,” as
U.S. sanctions and a proposed European Union oil embargo
threaten purchases of Iranian oil, the IEA said. “As a result,
customers have been aggressively seeking alternative supplies
from other OPEC members, especially  Saudi Arabia .”  The kingdom, the world’s largest crude exporter, boosted
output last month by 100,000 barrels a day to 9.85 million
barrels a day, the agency said.  “Production may be closer to the 10 million barrels a day
mark in January, with an increase in shipments expected” to the
west, the IEA said, citing tanker data.  Libya  boosted shipments to 800,000 barrels a day in
December from 555,000 barrels in November as more fields started
operating after the country’s armed conflict last year.  In contrast,  Iran ’s average output dropped to 3.58 million
barrels a day last year, the lowest since 2002, the IEA said.  OPEC, provider of about 40 percent of the world’s crude,
set its biggest-ever supply cuts three years ago. Supply, from
all members excluding  Iraq , was cut by 4.2 million barrels a day
to 24.845 million. The group largely exceeded its quotas last
year as nations sought to take advantage of higher prices and to
make up for the lack of Libyan crude.  OPEC’s members are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya,  Nigeria ,  Qatar , Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.  To contact the reporter on this story:
