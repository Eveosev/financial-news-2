Global demand for U.S. financial
assets rose more than forecast in November, boosted by investors
seeking shelter from the European debt crisis.  Net buying of long-term equities, notes and bonds totaled
$59.8 billion during the month compared with net purchases of
$8.3 billion in October, the Treasury Department said today in
 Washington . Including short-term securities, foreigners bought a
net $48.6 billion compared with net selling of $39.6 billion the
previous month.  “Demand for U.S. treasuries continued strong amid stress
in  Europe ,”  Guy Lebas , chief fixed-income strategist at Janney
Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia, said before the data were
published. “It’s a desire for European banks and other
investors to reduce the risk of their portfolios.”  The U.S. Treasury data released today capture international
purchases of government notes and bonds, stocks, corporate debt
and other securities.  Economists had forecast net buying of $40 billion of long-
term assets, the median of five estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey before today’s report. Their estimates ranged from a net
buying of $20 billion in long-term assets to $75 billion.  To contact the reporters on this story:
