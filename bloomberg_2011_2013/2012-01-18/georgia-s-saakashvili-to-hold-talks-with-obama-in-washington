Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili will hold talks with his U.S. counterpart,  Barack Obama , in  Washington  on Jan. 30, his spokeswoman said.  The meeting will mark the 20th anniversary of diplomatic
relations between Georgia and the U.S., Saakashvili’s
spokeswoman Manana Manjgaladze said by telephone in the capital
Tbilisi today.  Obama “will reconfirm U.S. support for the integrity of
Georgia’s territory within its internationally recognized
borders,” the White House said in an e-mailed statement. The
two leaders will also discuss Georgia’s parliamentary elections
this year and a presidential contest scheduled for 2013,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
