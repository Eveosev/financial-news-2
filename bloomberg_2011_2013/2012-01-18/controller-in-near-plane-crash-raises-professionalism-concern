A government safety investigation
into a near mid-air collision in  Mississippi  is the latest to
show disciplinary problems at a U.S. air-traffic facility.  A controller who instructed two planes to take off toward
each other June 19 near Gulfport, Mississippi, had been
repeatedly disciplined and was described by another controller
as “unsafe,” the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board
said in a report released yesterday.  The  Federal Aviation Administration  has struggled at times
to discipline controllers through processes set out in the
workers’ union contract and by the Merit Systems Protection
Board for federal employees. More than four of every 10 air-
traffic workers the FAA tried to fire between October 2009 and
last May kept their jobs or were allowed to retire, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  “What is the ultimate goal here?”  Michael Barr , a pilot
and instructor at the University of Southern California’s
Aviation Safety and Security Program, said. “The goal isn’t to
protect people’s jobs. It’s to make sure we have the safest air
traffic system possible.”  While controllers who make safety errors rarely intend to
do harm, the agency needs to take action in extreme cases, Barr
said in an interview.  Attempting to Fire  In 2009, a controller at Teterboro Airport in  New Jersey 
was blamed in part for a fatal mid-air collision over the  Hudson
River  because he was joking with an airport employee about
barbecuing a dead cat while on duty. The controller in that
incident was among those the FAA tried and failed to fire,
according to agency data compiled by Bloomberg in July.  The FAA was also thwarted in attempts to fire a controller
at  John F. Kennedy International Airport  in  New York  who allowed
his children to make radio calls to aircraft.  After the incident in Mississippi last year, the FAA
suspended and decertified the controller who made the errors,
the agency said in an e-mailed statement. The agency also made
management changes at the facility.  The controller, identified by the NTSB as Robert Beck,
received retraining and was allowed to return to work, the
agency said in the statement.  Beck had been suspended from work two or three times prior
to the incident and had received “informal” discipline on
several other occasions. In one case, Beck had failed to
disclose a drunk-driving arrest, according to the NTSB report.  Not Properly Staffed  In its investigation, the NTSB found that the airport tower
wasn’t properly staffed, and the incident wasn’t initially
reported as required by the FAA.  “The investigation revealed a number of deficiencies
within the ATC facility that contributed to this incident,” the
NTSB said in its report.  Within 18 seconds, Beck cleared a privately owned Cessna
172 propeller plane and a JetLink  Embraer SA (EMBR3)  ERJ 145 regional
jet operated for  United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL)  to take off on
different runways. The planes lifted off and came within 300
feet of colliding, the NTSB said.  The regional jet was carrying 53 people and two people were
aboard the Cessna, the NTSB said.  An FAA manager at the airport tower, Ron Burrus, told
investigators “it was a miracle that no one died,” according
to the report.  Controller Dennis Hilton, who also worked at the tower,
said he rated Beck’s performance as a controller as “D-,” the
NTSB said.  “Mr. Hilton stated that he considered Mr. Beck unsafe and
that he avoided working with him when possible,” the NTSB
documents said.  Working With FAA  “We take reports like these very seriously,” Doug Church,
a spokesman for the National Air Traffic Controllers Association
union, said in an e-mail. “We welcome the examination of this
incident by federal officials and plan to work with the FAA to
continue to improve the safety of our aviation system.”  While there has been a history of cases in which
controllers flaunted management and committed safety errors, the
agency has made improvements in recent years, said Bill Voss,
president of the non-profit Flight Safety Foundation in
Alexandria,  Virginia , and a former controller.  “Overall, there is a higher level of self-reporting and
accountability than there has been in the past,” Voss said in
an interview.  The Mississippi incident underscored the NTSB’s decision
last May to raise the issue of “professionalism” among pilots
and controllers to its list of most-wanted safety enhancements,
NTSB Chairman Debbie Hersman said in an e-mailed statement.  “There is no substitute for professionalism at every level
of an air-traffic control facility, from the management to the
individual controllers, all of which are responsible for the
safety of the flying public,” Hersman said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
