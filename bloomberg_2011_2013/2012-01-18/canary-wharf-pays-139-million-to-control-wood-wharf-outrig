Canary Wharf Group Plc (CWG) , the
developer and manager of east  London ’s business district, agreed
to pay 90.4 million pounds ($139 million) to acquire outright
the leasehold for a development site adjacent to its estate.  The company bought Waterways’ 50 percent stake in the
leasehold to the 16.8-acre (6.8-hectare) Wood Wharf site for
52.4 million pounds, according to a statement. It also purchased
Ballymore Properties Ltd.’s 25 percent stake for 38 million
pounds.  Canary Wharf already owned 25 percent of the site, for
which there is planning consent to build 4.8 million square feet
(445,935 square meters) of apartments, shops, offices and a
hotel. It will own the site under a renegotiated 250-year
agreement with British Waterways, a state-owned company and to
which ownership will revert when the leasehold expires.  “Wood Wharf’s development will mark an important evolution
in the development of the  Canary Wharf  business, retail and
residential district,” said George Iacobescu, Canary Wharf’s
chairman and chief executive officer.  Canary Wharf is 69 percent owned by  Songbird Estates Plc (SBD) ,
which is controlled by a group of investors including Qatar
Holding LLC, New York-based investor Simon Glick, funds managed
by Morgan Stanley, and China Investment Corp.  Canary Wharf developed and runs the 97-acre estate of the
same name in London’s former docklands. It has also expanded to
develop office buildings in the City of London district and is
steering the redevelopment of the Shell Centre near Waterloo
railroad station.  To contact the reporter on this story:
