German lawmaker Michael Meister
ruled out an increase in the country’s guarantees for the
European Financial Stability Facility, which are capped at 211
billion euros ($270 billion), in an interview with  Die Welt .  The EFSF’s funding is sufficient until the permanent
financial backstop for the euro region, the European Stability
Mechanism, takes over from the EFSF from June, the finance
spokesman for  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s ruling Christian Union
bloc said, according to the German newspaper.  The next aid tranche for  Greece  will only be paid out if
that country’s debt sustainability is assured, Meister said. An
agreement with Greece’s private creditors on a voluntary debt
swap will probably be reached “in the last minute,” Die Welt
cited him as saying.  Germany  should meet its obligations toward Greece as long
as Greece keeps to its promises, Meister told the newspaper,
adding that he wants Greece to stay a euro-region member.  To contact the reporter on this story:
