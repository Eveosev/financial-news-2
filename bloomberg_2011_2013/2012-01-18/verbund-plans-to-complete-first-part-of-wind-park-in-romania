Verbund AG,  Austria ’s biggest power
company, plans to complete the first part of its 200 megawatt
wind park in Romania by the end of this year and will reach full
capacity by the end of next year, said Tudor-Ovidiu Pop, the
manager of the company’s local unit.  Verbund will start testing its first 10 turbines with a
total capacity of 23 megawatts in February and plans to have 100
megawatts installed this year in Romania’s southeastern Tulcea
county, Pop said in an interview in Bucharest today.  The company is also building a transformer station to help
it connect the wind turbines to the national  power grid , Pop
