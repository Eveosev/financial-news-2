Portugal  sold the maximum target of
2.5 billion euros ($3.2 billion) of securities at a sale of
three-, six- and 11-month treasury bills.  The nation issued 1.25 billion euros of 11-month bills, the
longest maturity it has auctioned since the nation sought a
rescue last year. The securities due in December 2012 were
issued at an average yield of 4.986 percent and investors bid
for 2.1 times the amount issued, the debt management agency
said.  The last time Portugal auctioned debt with a maturity of 11
months or longer was on April 6, when it sold 455 million euros
of 12-month bills at an average yield of 5.902 percent and a
bid-to-cover ratio of 2.6. The country requested a bailout later
the same day.  The IGCP, as the debt agency is known, said on Jan. 12 the
total indicative amount for today’s auctions was between 2
billion euros and 2.5 billion euros. The agency said it added
the 11-month bills to the maturities already scheduled for sale
today in its quarterly calendar due to “specific demand from
investors.”  Today’s auction was Portugal’s first debt sale since
 Standard & Poor’s  on Jan. 13 followed  Fitch Ratings  and Moody’s
Investors Service in downgrading Portugal’s credit rating to
non-investment grade.  Costs Decline  Portugal’s borrowing costs declined at the auction of 754
million euros of six-month bills. The securities due in July
were issued at an average yield of 4.74 percent, the debt
management agency said. That compares with an average yield of
5.25 percent at a previous auction of six-month debt on Nov. 16.
Today’s auction attracted bids for 3 times the amount sold,
versus a bid-to-cover ratio of 4.1 in November.  The debt agency also sold 496 million euros of three-month
bills at an average yield of 4.346 percent, attracting bids for
4.1 times the amount sold. That compares with an average yield
of 4.346 percent at a prior three-month auction on Jan. 4, with
a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.4.  Portuguese bonds were little changed with the 10-year yield
rising four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 14.28
percent at 11:30 a.m. London time. It reached at record 14.48
percent on Jan. 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
