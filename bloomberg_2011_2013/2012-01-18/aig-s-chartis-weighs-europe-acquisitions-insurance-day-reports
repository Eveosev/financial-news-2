American International Group Inc. (AIG) 
may expand by buying units in Europe where rivals are hobbled as
nations struggle to repay debts, Insurance Day reported, citing
the head of the firm’s property-casualty unit in the continent.  “We have interest in acquisitions and we think there will
be some element of opportunity presented by the crisis,” Robert Schimek told Insurance Day for an article on its website today.  Schimek was given responsibility for Europe, the  Middle
East  and Africa at the Chartis property-casualty insurance
division, New York-based AIG said yesterday in a statement.
Schimek was Chartis’s chief financial officer for six years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
