Companies and workers in the U.S.
will increasingly lose out to competition from overseas during
the next three years, according to a survey of Harvard Business
School alumni.  More than two-thirds of about 10,000 graduates of the
school in  Boston , said that U.S. companies will become less able
to compete internationally or pay high wages and benefits,
according to the  report  released today.  Other nations are challenging the U.S. with well-trained
workers who garner lower wages, the authors said. Survey
respondents in the manufacturing industry, who are in the prime
of their careers or are working in companies with international
rivals, were the most pessimistic about the U.S.’s prospects,
said the authors, Michael Porter and Jan Rivkin, both professors
at the business school.  “Business leaders and policy makers in America must find
ways for Americans to work smarter and more productively than
workers who are paid lower wages overseas,” they said in the
report.  Almost 80 percent of respondents said the U.S. is falling
behind other countries in the effectiveness of its political
system and primary and secondary education, the report said.
More than 60 percent said the U.S. is behind other nations in
the complexity of its  tax code  and its infrastructure.  The report summarized results from 9,750 respondents to a
survey conducted in October. It was designed as a census of
Harvard Business School alumni, and calculations of a margin of
error don’t apply to it, the authors said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
