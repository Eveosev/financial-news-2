Celanese Corp. (CE) , the world’s biggest
producer of acetic acid, rose the most in four weeks after
forecasting higher earnings for the next two years.  Celanese rose 5.3 percent to $49 in  New York , the biggest
gain since Dec. 20.  Celanese will earn more than $4.70 a share this year and
will achieve profit goals for 2013, when the company expects to
earn at least $6 a share, Chief Financial Officer Steven Sterin
said today on a conference call. The Dallas-based company may
earn $4.76 a share this year and $5.36 next, according to the
average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Celanese yesterday said 2011 earnings were about $4.45 a
share, less than the company had forecast, because of falling
demand in  Europe  at the end of the year. The gain in the
company’s stock price indicates investors are willing to look
past disappointing fourth-quarter results if it provides a
positive outlook,  Hassan Ahmed , a New York-based analyst at
Alembic Global Advisors, said in a phone interview today.  “Feedstock prices seem to be coming down and product
prices are going up, and that has people all bulled up since the
start of the year,” Ahmed said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
