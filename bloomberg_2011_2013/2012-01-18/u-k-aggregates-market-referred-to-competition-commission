The U.K. market for aggregates,
cement and ready-mix concrete used in construction may be
distorted and requires a full investigation by the  Competition
Commission , Britain’s antitrust regulator said.  The decision follows a probe started in 2010 over concerns
the biggest companies were barring smaller competitors from the
market and driving up prices, the U.K.  Office of Fair Trading 
said in a statement today. The five largest firms have more than
90 percent of cement sales in Britain, the watchdog has said.
The OFT’s referral to the  Competition Commission  doesn’t include
the market in Northern Ireland, it said.  The industry is “part of the larger construction industry
which provides vital inputs across the British economy,”  John Fingleton , the chief executive officer of the OFT, said in the
statement. “We continue to have concerns that these markets are
not working well.”  The British Aggregates Association trade group has said the
U.K. market is dominated by London-based  Anglo American Plc (AAL) ,
 Germany ’s  HeidelbergCement AG (HEI) , Switzerland’s  Holcim Ltd. (HOLN) , Paris-
based  Lafarge SA (LG)  and Mexico’s Cemex SAB. The Competition
Commission has authority to impose requirements that affect
markets, such as ordering divestments or creating restrictions
or new industry rules for companies to follow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
