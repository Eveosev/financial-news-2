Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ,  Europe ’s
largest oil company, joined  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW)  to explore for oil
and gas in new frontiers in the Atlantic Ocean.  The companies signed the memorandum of understanding after
making the first offshore oil discovery off French Guiana last
year with their Zaedyus well together with  Total SA. (FP)  Tullow
already has several exploration partnerships with  Anadarko
Petroleum Corp. (APC) ,  Statoil ASA (STL) , Total and  CNOOC Ltd. (883)  in Africa and
 Latin America  and plans to secure more in the future, said Chief
Operating Officer Paul McDade.  “We are looking at a certain number of areas,” McDade
said in a phone interview, declining to specify regions. “Shell
will be a very good technical partner.”  Tullow, which has been among the world’s most successful
explorers in recent years with discoveries in Ghana and Uganda,
has been looking for Equatorial Atlantic partnerships to reduce
risks and cut costs.  BP Plc (BP/)  Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley
said in October that the world’s largest oil companies had
overlooked some of the world’s biggest basins.  Tullow plans to drill about 40 exploration and appraisal
wells worldwide this year, it said today in a statement.  “We are planning in the future to be as aggressive as we
have been in the past in respect of big-impact exploration,”
McDade said.  Shell confirmed the deal in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
