Slovenia’s President Danilo Turk may
name Marko Voljc, the chief of  KBC Groep NV (KBC)  unit for Central and
Eastern Europe and  Russia , as the new premier that will seek to
form a government, Delo newspaper reported, without saying where
it obtained the information.  Turk will probably nominate Voljc, a former chief of Nova
Ljubljanska Banka d.d., at 5 p.m. local time in Ljubljana, the
Slovenian newspaper said on its website today.  Slovenian lawmakers on Jan. 11 rejected Zoran Jankovic to
form the new Cabinet after the former Ljubljana mayor’s party
won the most votes in an election last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
