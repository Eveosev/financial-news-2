Peruvian dollar bond yields headed
for the biggest drop in four weeks as reports bolstered optimism
about the outlook for the German and U.S. economies, shoring up
demand for higher-yielding, emerging-market assets.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 6.55 percent dollar-
denominated bond due March 2037 declined three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 4.85 percent at 12:15 p.m. in  Lima ,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The bond’s price rose
0.47 cent to 124.60 cents per dollar.  U.S. industrial production increased in December, after a
drop in November, reflecting demand for business equipment,
automobiles and construction materials. German investor
confidence jumped the most on record in January, the ZEW Center
for European Economic Research said yesterday. Peruvian yields
rose 13 basis points last week amid concern that  Europe ’s debt
crisis may curb global growth.  “People are taking solace from the level of investor
confidence in  Germany , and the U.S. industrial production
numbers were decent,” said Alberto Bernal, the head of fixed-
income research at Bulltick Capital Markets in Miami. “There’s
a risk-on attitude in the markets.”  The sol was little changed at 2.6920 per  U.S. dollar , from
2.6930 yesterday, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
