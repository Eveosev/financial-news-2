The European Commission should be
given more power to sanction euro-area countries that fail to
meet the region’s debt limits, the Dutch government said.  The Brussels-based commission’s ability to sanction such a
member state should only be blocked if a qualified majority of
countries reject it, Finance Minister Jan Kees  de Jager  and
Foreign Affairs Secretary Ben Knapen said in a letter sent to
the Dutch parliament.  Euro-area government representatives are fleshing out a
rulebook for budgetary discipline negotiated at a leaders’
summit in December that seeks to create a “fiscal compact” for
the region. EU President  Herman Van Rompuy  said he expects
leaders to sign an accord on the rules in early March.  The planned treaty already strengthens the commission’s
power to enforce deficit limits. The Dutch government will
continue to push for more automatic sanctions for excessive
debt, De Jager and Knapen wrote, adding there’s little support
among member states for such measures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
