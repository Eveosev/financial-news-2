Gold futures climbed to the highest
settlement price in five weeks as a slumping dollar boosted the
appeal of the precious metal as an alternative asset.  The greenback declined for the second day against a basket
of major currencies after U.S. factory output in December
climbed the most in a year as production of business equipment,
automobiles and construction materials rose, figures from the
 Federal Reserve  showed today. The  International Monetary Fund 
proposed boosting its resources by as much as $500 billion to
safeguard the global economy.  “The dollar’s weakness is supporting gold,” David Meger,
the director of metal trading at Vision Financial Markets in
Chicago, said in a telephone interview.  Gold futures for February delivery rose 0.3 percent to
close at $1,659.90 an ounce at 1:39 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York , the highest settlement since Dec. 13. Prices are up 5.9
percent this month.  “Gold is facing technical resistance at the $1,660
level,” Meger said.  Silver futures for March delivery rose 1.4 percent to
$30.543 an ounce in New York, climbing for the second straight
session.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
April delivery fell 0.2 percent to $1,525.30 an ounce. Palladium
futures for March delivery rose 2 percent to $668.50 an ounce,
the highest settlement since Dec. 9.  To contact the reporter for this story:
