J. Moses Harding, executive vice
president at IndusInd Bank Ltd., comments on the outlook for the
dollar-rupee forward premium in a telephone interview from
Mumbai. The rupee advanced 0.3 percent to 50.5850 per dollar as
of 10.47 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The three-month onshore forward traded at 51.61, with
the forward premium at 8.16 percent. The spot rate, which fell
16 percent last year in  Asia ’s worst performance, has rallied 5
percent this month to be the region’s biggest gainer.  “The high forward premium, with the three-month spiking
into 8 percent, has pushed the rupee from 51 a dollar into
50.70. Exporters who missed the spot rupee move into 54 are
leading dollar supplies, while importers who stayed uncovered
expecting a move into 51, are now holding on to dollars hoping
for 48.70.  ‘‘Now immediate support for dollar is at 50.50 ahead of
49.85. The dollar will find resistance in the near term at
51.00-51.20, attracted by the higher premium.  ‘‘Sell three-month forward dollars at 52.00-52.25, with
support at 50.75-51.00.’’
