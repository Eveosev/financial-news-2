Latin American companies will post
“modest” revenue gains this year as economic growth slows,
according to  Standard & Poor’s .  “We expect softer, but still positive, economic growth in
most countries in the region to support modest upticks in
revenue and stability in operating margins for most
industries,” Eduardo Uribe, a Mexico City-based analyst with
S&P, wrote in an e-mailed report today.  China’s economic slowdown may drive down prices on raw
materials, cutting into profits at companies that produce
commodities while benefiting those that buy them, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
