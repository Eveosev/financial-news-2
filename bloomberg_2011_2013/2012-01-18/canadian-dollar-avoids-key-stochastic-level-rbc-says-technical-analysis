Investors should bet the dollar will
weaken versus the Canadian currency after the greenback avoided
falling to a level considered unsustainable, according to RBC
Dominion Securities Inc., citing technical indicators.  The currency pair’s slow stochastic oscillator hasn’t
fallen below 25, indicating the  U.S. dollar  still has potential
to decline,  George Davis , chief technical analyst for fixed
income and currency strategy in Toronto at the Royal Bank of
 Canada  unit, said in a telephone interview.  “Price action yesterday eliminated the oversold nature of
the dollar, so that sets the stage for a continuation of the
overall downtrend,” Davis said. “A lot of the currencies that
are linked in with the risk trade like Canada have resisted a
lot of the potential negative headlines and been able to do
quite well. The psychology in the market is biased toward
risk-on right now.”  Davis recommended today in a research note that clients
sell the U.S. dollar at C$1.0160 and C$1.0195, taking profit at
C$1.0100 and ending the trade if it appreciates to C$1.0215.  A break in the greenback below C$1.0120 would make it
possible for the Canadian currency to strengthen to C$1.0078 and
then C$1.0055, Davis wrote. The U.S. dollar would have to rally
to C$1.0260 to signal the downward momentum is over.  Canada’s dollar appreciated 0.2 percent to C$1.0137 to the
U.S. currency at 11:11 a.m. Toronto time after earlier dropping
0.3 percent to C$1.0178. The loonie, as the currency is
sometimes known, gained 0.3 percent yesterday after rising as
much as 0.7 percent.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. A slow stochastic oscillator
measures the closing price of an asset relative to its highs and
lows during a particular period to help predict whether prices
will rise or fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
