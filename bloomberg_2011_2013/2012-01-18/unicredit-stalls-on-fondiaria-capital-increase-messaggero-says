UniCredit SpA (UCG) , Italy’s largest
lender, may not take part in  Fondiaria-SAI SpA (FSA) ’s capital
increase, daily  Il Messaggero  reported, without saying where it
got the information.  UniCredit has a 6.7 percent stake in the Italian insurance
company. Only foreign banks, including Morgan Stanley, are
willing to take part in a group to guarantee the
recapitalization of Fondiaria, Premafin SpA and  Unipol Gruppo
Finanziario SpA (UNI) , the daily newspaper reported. Unipol executives
will meet with Italian insurance regulator ISVAP today to
discuss a potential merger with Fondiaria and Premafin SpA
today, the daily reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
