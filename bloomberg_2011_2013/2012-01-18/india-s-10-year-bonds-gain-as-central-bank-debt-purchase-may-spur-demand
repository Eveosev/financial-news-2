India ’s 10-year  bonds  gained,
pushing yields toward a five-month low, after the central bank
said it will purchase sovereign debt at an open-market auction
this week.  The  Reserve Bank of India  will offer to buy 120 billion
rupees ($2.4 billion) of securities on Jan. 20, it said in a
statement yesterday. Bonds also rose on speculation the central
bank will cut the reserve-requirement  ratio  for banks by 50
basis points to 5.5 percent this month to free up cash at banks,
said R.S. Chauhan, chief currency and debt trader in Mumbai at
 State Bank  of Bikaner & Jaipur.  “Bond buying by the Reserve Bank may boost liquidity,”
said Chauhan. “People also think a reserve-requirement cut is
on the cards as cash conditions continue to be tight.”  The yield on the 8.79 percent bonds due November 2021 fell
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.21 percent as of
9:45 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. The rate touched 8.20 percent last week, the lowest
level for a benchmark 10-year bond since Aug. 10.  The  Reserve Bank  has bought 614 billion rupees of fixed-
income securities since it resumed so-called open-market
auctions in November to ease a cash crunch in the banking
system. Local lenders  borrowed  1.6 trillion rupees through
repurchase contracts from the monetary authority yesterday to
meet shortages, the most since Dec. 23. The RBI’s next monetary-
policy review is scheduled for Jan. 24.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in funding costs,
fell six basis points to 8.01 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
