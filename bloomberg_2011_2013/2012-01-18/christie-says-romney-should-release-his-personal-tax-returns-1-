New Jersey Governor  Chris Christie 
said Republican presidential candidate  Mitt Romney  should
release his personal tax returns.  Christie, a first-term Republican who has campaigned for
Romney, said he releases his tax returns and so should Romney.
He also said he hasn't discussed with Romney becoming his vice
presidential running mate.  “What I would say to Governor Romney is: If you have tax
returns to put out, you know, you should put them out,”
Christie said in an interview on The Today Show with NBC’s Matt Lauer. “You put them out sooner rather than later. It’s always
better, in my view, to have complete disclosure, especially when
you’re the front runner.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
