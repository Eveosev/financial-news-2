Hungary’s Semmelweis University will
set up a committee to investigate allegations that Pal Schmitt,
the nation’s President, plagiarized his doctoral dissertation in
1992.  The fact-finding committee will review the “circumstances
under which Pal Schmitt’s doctoral dissertation came into
being,” the university said in a  statement  on its website.  Local news website  Hvg  said Jan. 11 that Schmitt may have
copied word for word about 180 pages from the work of Bulgarian
sports researcher Nikolay Gueorguiev in his thesis. Schmitt’s
dissertation doesn’t contain footnotes, making it impossible to
judge whether the author cited from Gueorguiev’s book, whose
title Schmitt mentioned in the bibliography in its Hungarian
translation, the news website said, adding that the book hasn’t
been translated to Hungarian.  The President denied the accusation in a radio interview
today, saying he used a total of 21 sources in his work. “I
wrote that thesis using the best of my knowledge,” Schmitt told
public radio  MR1-Kossuth .  Schmitt, who has been a known sports administration
official since communist times and who served on the
 International Olympic Committee , was elected president last
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
