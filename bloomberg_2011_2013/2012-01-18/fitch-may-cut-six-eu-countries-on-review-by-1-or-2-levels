Fitch Ratings  will likely cut all
six euro-area countries currently on review by one or two levels
by the end of this month, Managing Director  Edward Parker  said.  “We do expect that the review will lead to downgrades of
one to two notches for all the countries under review,” Parker
said today in Milan.  Fitch placed Spain, Italy, Ireland, Cyprus, Belgium and
Slovenia on review in December for possible downgrades, citing
Europe’s failure to find a “comprehensive solution” to the
region’s debt crisis. Fitch also lowered the outlook on France’s
AAA rating at the time, though executives this month said
France’s rating would not likely be cut this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:  To contact the reporters on this story:
