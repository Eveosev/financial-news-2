The Autorite des Marches Financiers,
 France â€™s financial-markets regulator, will require the
declaration of certain over-the-counter derivatives
transactions, La Tribune reported, without saying where it got
the information.  The AMF has decided to broaden the application of an
existing rule which previously applied only to transactions that
took place on an organized market, the newspaper said. The rule
went into effect on Jan. 1, though some flexibility will be
permitted during the first quarter to allow computer systems to
be adapted, La Tribune reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
