A  California (STOCA1)  group financed by
billionaire investor Nicolas Berggruen will delay a proposed
ballot initiative to overhaul the state’s tax structure by
adopting a levy on services while lowering income taxes, a
spokesman said.  The  Think Long Committee for California , which includes
Google Inc. Chairman  Eric Schmidt , former U.S. Secretary of
State Condoleezza Rice and former  California  Governor Gray Davis, will aim to put its proposal before voters in 2014 rather
than this November, said Nathan Gardels, a senior adviser.  Governor  Jerry Brown  is pressing for a vote on the 2012
ballot to temporarily raise sales taxes and income taxes on
people earning more than $250,000. Think Long’s decision wasn’t
made to avoid competing with the governor, Gardels said.  “There are plenty of quick fixes out there,” he said by
telephone. “We’re not trying to make a quick fix. We’re making
fundamental reforms.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
