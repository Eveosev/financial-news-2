Japan  purchased 8 percent of the
debt issued by the European Financial Stability Facility
yesterday, according to a Japanese Finance Ministry official.  The Japanese government bought 120 million euros ($153
million) of the 1.5 billion euro of bonds sold, the official
said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the
ministry’s policy.  The EFSF, designed to finance rescue packages for Greece,
Ireland and Portugal, lost its top  credit rating  a day before
the auction. Finance Minister Jun Azumi said yesterday that the
downgrade won’t affect Japan’s support for the fund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
