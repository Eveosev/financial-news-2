Eiffage SA (FGR) ,  France ’s third-largest
construction company, is seeking to refinance about 4 billion
euros ($5.1 billion) of loans, according to three people with
knowledge of the matter.  The company hired Rothschild Group as an adviser on the
transaction, said the people, who declined to be named because
the information is private. The company is seeking to name
arrangers for the deal before offering it to a bigger group of
banks, said the people.  Eiffarie, the Eiffage unit that owns Autroutes Paris-Rhin-
Rhone, has about 3.8 billion euros of loans maturing February
2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Its Autoroutes
Paris-Rhin-Rhone unit, known as APPR, has a revolving credit
facility of 1.8 billion euros with a similar maturity.  Money in a revolving credit can be borrowed again once it’s
been repaid. APRR, rated at the lowest investment grade by
 Standard & Poor’s , sold 500 million euros of 2018 bonds last
week at spread of 415.5 basis points above German government
debt.  John Kiely, a spokesman for Rothschild declined to comment.
Sandra Weigand and Claudine Rolland, spokeswomen at Eiffage and
APRR didn’t returns a call and an e-mail requesting a comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
