U.S. gasoline use rose 4.1 percent
last week, rebounding from the lowest level in more than seven
years in the week earlier, according to  MasterCard Inc. (MA)   Drivers bought 8.37 million barrels a day of gasoline in
the week ended Jan. 13, up from 8.044 million, according to
MasterCard’s SpendingPulse report. The company’s data goes back
to July 2004.  Fuel demand fell below year-earlier levels for the 20th
consecutive time last week, declining 3.5 percent from 2011.
Gasoline use over the previous four weeks was 3 percent below a
year earlier, the 43nd consecutive decline in that measure.  Consumption in 2011 fell 1.6 percent from 2010, according
to MasterCard, the second-biggest payments network company. The

than a year earlier.  The report from Purchase, New York-based MasterCard is

check payments at about 140,000 U.S. gasoline stations.  Visa Inc. (V)  is the biggest payments network company by
