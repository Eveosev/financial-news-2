Societe Generale (GLE)  SA,  France ’s
second-largest bank, appointed Wee Kuo as  Asia  head of oil and
refined-products swaps trading based in  Singapore , according to
two people with direct knowledge of the matter.  Kuo reports to Alexander Werner, head of oil and refined-
products swaps trading for Europe and Asia, and Olivier Godin,
head of  commodities markets  for Asia-Pacific, according to the
people, who declined to be named because the appointment hasn’t
been publicly announced. Kuo was transferred from  London .  Kuo joined Societe Generale in London in 2009, and
previously worked for Dresdner Bank AG, according to the U.K.
