Russia  is resuming grain purchases
for state reserves from the 2011 harvest and will start buying
on Jan. 24, the National Commodity Exchange said.  The government plans to buy third- and fourth-grade milling
wheat grown in the Krasnodar, Altai and Novosibirsk regions when
purchases start, according to exchange figures.  Russia bought a total of 331,965 metric tons of 2011-crop
wheat from Nov. 29 through Dec. 27. The  Agriculture Ministry 
ordered a suspension of purchases on Jan. 12 after prices
stabilized in the domestic market and said today buying will
restart.  To contact the reporter on this story:
