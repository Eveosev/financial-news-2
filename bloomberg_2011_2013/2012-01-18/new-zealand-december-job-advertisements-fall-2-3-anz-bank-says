New Zealand job advertisements fell
2.3 percent in December from November, ANZ National Bank Ltd.
said in an e-mailed statement. The decrease was driven by a 4.5
percent fall in newspaper listings and a 1.8 percent fall in
internet advertising, the Auckland-based lender said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
