Billionaire Mark Cuban recruited
concert promoter AEG, talent agency CAA and reality-TV producer
Ryan Seacrest as investors in a rebranded HDNet cable channel
called AXS TV.  The switch will take place after midyear, HDNet said today
in an e-mailed statement. Financial terms weren’t disclosed.  Dish Network Corp. (DISH)  will expand its distribution of HDNet
after the change, bringing the channel’s total to 35 million
U.S. homes, the companies said. AXS TV will provide behind-the-
scenes coverage of live concerts and music festivals. Some
shows, including “HDNet Fights,” “Inside MMA,” “Dan Rather
Reports” and a Sunday concert series, will continue on AXS TV.  Dish will offer AXS TV concerts on-demand starting March
15, the companies said. AEG will offer concert deals to Dish
subscribers, including premium seating, private viewing areas
and food and beverage specials.  AXS TV will continue to be carried by HDNet’s existing pay-
TV distributors, including  DirecTV (DTV) ,  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ,  Verizon
Communications Inc. (VZ) , AT&T Inc. and  Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR) ,
the companies said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
