GAIL India Ltd. (GAIL) , the country’s
biggest natural gas distributor, said it’s dropped a plan to bid
for  BG Group Plc (BG/) ’s stake in Gujarat Gas Co.  “We are not interested,” GAIL said in an e-mailed
statement today.  The company is considering a bid, Chairman B.C. Tripathi
said Nov. 22. GAIL hasn’t had any discussions about the purchase
with BG, the U.K.’s third-largest gas producer, and hasn’t
appointed a bank to study a possible deal, Tripathi said at the
time.  GAIL shares fell 1.5 percent to 364.90 rupees at the close
in Mumbai today, the lowest level since Nov. 4, 2009. The
benchmark Sensitive Index declined 0.1 percent.  BG, the Reading, England-based company, bought shares in
Gujarat Gas in 1997 and is considering selling its 65 percent
holding as part of a global portfolio review.  To contact the reporter on this story:
