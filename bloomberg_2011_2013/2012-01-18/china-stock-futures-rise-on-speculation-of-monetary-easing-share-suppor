China’s stocks  dropped, after the
benchmark index rose the most since October 2009 yesterday, on
concern a property-market slowdown will damp demand for building
materials and  consumer goods .  China Vanke Co. (000002)  paced losses by property developers after
the nation’s home prices posted their worst performance last
year in December.  GF Securities Co. (000776) , the nation’s second-largest
listed brokerage, advanced 1 percent after the China Securities
Journal said the government may take steps bolster long-term
investor shareholdings. China’s markets are closed next week for
the Lunar New Year holidays.  “After the big rally yesterday and with next week’s
holidays coming up the market may take a pause here,”  said Wei Wei, an analyst at West China Securities Co. in  Shanghai .
“Though market expectations are high that the government will
encourage fresh money into stocks, it remains to be seen how
soon these support measures will materialize.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  fell 31.99 points, or 1.4
percent, to 2,266.38 at the close. The  CSI 300 Index  dropped 1.6
percent to 2,422.19. The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index , the
measure of the most-traded U.S.-listed Chinese companies, added
1.1 percent in  New York  yesterday.  Ten-day  volatility  on the Shanghai Composite rose to the
highest level today since November 2010, after the gauge rose or
fell by more than 1.3 percent on seven of the 11 trading days
this year.  Stock Support  The Shanghai Composite gained 4.2 percent yesterday, the
most since October 2009, as slowing economic growth boosted
expectations for monetary easing and the China Securities
Journal said the nation’s local pension funds may start
investing in domestic stocks this quarter.  The Shanghai index trades at 9.3 times estimated earnings,
near the record low of 8.9 times reached on Jan. 6, according to
weekly  data  compiled by Bloomberg. It was the worst performer
among the world’s 15 biggest markets in the two years through
2011 with a 33 percent drop.  A gauge of property stocks in the Shanghai Composite slid
1.7 percent today. Vanke, the nation’s biggest listed property
developer, fell 0.9 percent to 7.51 yuan. Poly Real Estate Group
Co., the second largest, lost 2.2 percent to 10.12 yuan.  RiseSun
Real Estate Development Co. (002146)  fell 1.3 percent to 8.60 yuan.  Prices in 52 of 70 cities monitored by the government
declined from the previous month, the National Statistics Bureau
said in a statement on its website today. New home prices in the
nation’s four major cities of Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen and
Guangzhou declined for a third month, it said.  Property Curbs  The government said last month it won’t back away from
curbs on the real-estate industry, with the financial center of
Shanghai and the capital of Beijing among Chinese cities that
have said they will continue to impose restrictions on home
purchases this year.  Building-material stocks dropped. Baoshan Iron & Steel Co.,
the listed unit of  China ’s second-biggest steelmaker, fell 1.7
percent to 5.10 yuan. Hebei Iron & Steel Co., the listed unit of
the biggest, lost 1.3 percent to 3.01 yuan.  China Shenhua Energy Co. dropped among coal producers after
Xinhua News Agency said prices of the raw material may fall in
the first half.  Shenhua, the nation’s largest coal producer, sank 1.8
percent to 26.88 yuan. China Coal Energy Co., the second
largest, lost 3.3 percent to 9.47 yuan.  GF Securities advanced 1 percent to 23.84 yuan. Huatai
Securities Co. added 0.4 percent to 8.22 yuan. Industrial
Securities Co. climbed 0.4 percent to 10.57 yuan.  Investment Quota  The government may introduce preferential policies for
institutional investors to encourage long-term stockholding, the
China Securities Journal said today, without saying where it got
the information.  China may also more than double the combined quota for its
qualified foreign institutional investor program from the
current $30 billion, the China Business News reported today,
citing an unidentified person close to regulators.  China’s economy  grew 8.9 percent last quarter, below 9
percent for the first time since mid-2009, based on previously
reported data, and compared with the 8.7 percent median forecast
in a Bloomberg News survey of 26 economists. Full-year economic
growth slowed to 9.2 percent from 10.4 percent in 2010,
yesterday’s report showed.  Chinese and  Indian (SENSEX)  equities may outperform other Asian
markets this year as slowing inflation allows the countries’
governments to ease monetary policies and spur growth, according
to  Manulife Asset Management .  Manulife has added more shares of Indian and Chinese
companies to its regional funds, said Linda Csellak, Hong Kong-
based head of Asia Pacific equities at Manulife, which has about
$199 billion of assets. Banks and property developers may lead
the rally as looser monetary policies will boost loan and
housing demand, she said in an interview in Bangkok yesterday.  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Richard Frost, Chan Tien Hin  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
