European  construction output  rose in
November after three months of contraction, led by  Germany ,
adding to signs that the euro-area economy may be stabilizing.  Construction (EUCPTSAM)  in the 17-nation single-currency region
advanced 0.8 percent from October, when it fell 1.4 percent, the
European Union’s  statistics office  in Luxembourg said today.
From a year earlier, November  output  was up 0.2 percent.  European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said on Jan.
12 that the  euro-area economy  is showing “tentative signs of a
stabilization in activity at low levels.” While Draghi still
warned of “substantial downside risks,” the central bank voted
to keep  interest rates  at a record low.  The euro-area economy may contract 0.3 percent this year,
compared with a previous estimate of a 1.8 percent gain, the
Washington-based World Bank said in its Global Economic
Prospects report released today in  Asia  and yesterday in the
U.S. The ECB forecasts expansion of 0.3 percent this year, while
the European Commission sees growth at 0.5 percent.  Construction output in Germany,  Europe ’s largest economy,
increased 4.5 percent from October, when it rose 1.6 percent,
according to today’s report. French construction was up 0.8
percent in the month, while in Spain, building fell 0.7 percent.  In the 27-nation European Union, construction output rose
0.4 percent in the month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
