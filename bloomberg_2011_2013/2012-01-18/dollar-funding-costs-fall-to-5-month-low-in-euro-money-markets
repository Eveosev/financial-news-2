The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars fell to the lowest in more than five months as
the  International Monetary Fund  proposed a $500 billion
expansion of its lending resources.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was at 78
basis points below the euro interbank offered rate at 11:29 a.m.
in London. That’s the lowest cost since Aug. 8 and compares with
minus 83 yesterday.  The IMF is considering boosting its war chest to shield the
global economy from any worsening of  Europe ’s debt crisis,
according to a Group of 20 nation official. Strains on dollar
borrowing have already eased this year as the  European Central
Bank  made available unlimited cash to lenders, cut the emergency
dollar-loan rate and relaxed rules on collateral.  “Sentiment is improving,” said  Orlando Green , a fixed-
income strategist at Credit Agricole CIB in London. “Today’s
move would have been helped by the announcement by the IMF.”  The one-year basis swap fell to 72 basis points less than
Euribor, from minus 74.5 yesterday, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  A measure of banks’ reluctance to lend to one another in
Europe fell to a two-month low. The Euribor-OIS spread, the
difference between the borrowing benchmark and overnight index
swaps, was at 84 basis points. That’s the narrowest since Nov.
17 and compares with 85 basis points yesterday.  Overnight deposits  at the European Central Bank rose to a
record, as lenders parked 528 billion euros ($673 billion) with
the Frankfurt-based ECB yesterday, compared with 502 billion
euros on Jan. 16.  Three-month Euribor (EUR003M) , the rate banks say they pay for three-
month loans in euros, fell to 1.204 percent, the lowest since
March, from 1.213 percent.  One-week Euribor (EUR001W)  dropped to 0.448
percent from 0.459 percent.  The  London  interbank offered rate, or Libor, for three-
month dollar loans fell to 0.561 percent from 0.562 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
