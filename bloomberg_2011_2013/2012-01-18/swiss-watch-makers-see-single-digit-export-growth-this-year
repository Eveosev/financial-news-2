Swiss watch exports will probably
climb to record levels this year, though growth may slow to a
“single-digit” pace, the head of the Federation of the Swiss
Watch Industry said.  “Growth will continue this year, though not with the same
rate,” Jean-Daniel Pasche said in an interview in Geneva. “It
will be more difficult and brands are cautious on Europe.”  While the market for Swiss timepieces will continue to
expand in Asia, Europe will still have “very low growth,”
according to Pasche. Swiss watch exports increased 19 percent to
17.4 billion francs ($18.5 billion) from January through
November. The rising number of millionaires in  China  is boosting
demand for  luxury goods  in the country.  Swatch Group AG, (UHR)  the biggest maker of Swiss watches, said
on Jan. 10 that 2012 will be a “major” challenge after revenue
reached a record last year. On the same day, New York-based
Tiffany & Co. cut its annual earnings forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
