Labor unrest that led to at least 16
deaths in Kazakhstan, the second-biggest oil producer in the
former  Soviet Union , could slow the pace of foreign investments
into crude production, according to the IEA.  “In addition to threatening domestic investment, strikes
and labor issues will complicate and continue to slow the pace
of billions of dollars of existing and planned foreign
investments,” the Paris-based organization said today in its
monthly market report.  The protests, which erupted in violence after months of
strikes in the western part of the central Asian country, are
unlikely to spread to the key crude-producing region of Atyrau,
where foreign operators are based, IEA said.  The Kazakh government reacted quickly to stem the fallout
from the riots by replacing key officials and creating temporary
jobs for the striking workers at newly created units at state
energy company KazMunaiGaz, which could add to the cost of
business in the country, according to the report.  Kazakhstan  produced about 1.6 million barrels a day in 2011
and is forecast to reach output of 1.8 million barrels by 2016,
the IEA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
