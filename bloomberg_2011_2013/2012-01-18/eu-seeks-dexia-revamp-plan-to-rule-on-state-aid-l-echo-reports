The European Commission won’t take a
decision on whether state aid for  Dexia SA (DEXB)  is in line with
competition rules until it has received new restructuring plans
for the bank,  Joaquin Almunia , the region’s antitrust chief,
said in an interview with L’Echo.  “We can’t make progress while we still don’t have these
proposals on the table,” Almunia said. The plans should cover
“Dexia and all of its parts,” he said.  Dexia, once the world’s largest municipal lender, won
temporary approval last month from EU regulators for as much as
45 billion euros ($57.41 billion) in guarantees from Belgium,
France and Luxembourg through May 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
