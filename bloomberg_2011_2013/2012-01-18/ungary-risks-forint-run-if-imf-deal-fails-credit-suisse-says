Hungary  risks facing a “run” on
the forint unless the government obtains a bailout from the
 International Monetary Fund  and the European Union, according to
Credit Suisse Group AG.  “Based on the weak fundamentals and unpredictable policies
our base case is that the forint will fall further,” and “we
would not rule out a run on the currency with very negative
implications on households and corporations,” Bernd Berg, a
currency strategist at Credit Suisse in Zurich, said in an e-
mailed response to questions from Bloomberg. “Only a deal with
the IMF/EU will avoid a run, further devaluation of the currency
in our view.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
