BP Plc (BP/)  cut its estimate of global
energy demand growth through 2030 to 1.6 percent annually from
1.7 percent a year ago, according to statements on its website.  The cut followed an increase in BP’s estimate of 2010
demand by 1.6 percent to 12 billion metric tons of oil
equivalent, said  Christof Ruehl , BP’s chief economist.  Demand will jump 39 percent by 2030, with the expansion
coming almost entirely from developing nations, to 16.6 billion
tons, the London-based company said in its Energy Outlook 2030
report. That’s 1.2 percent higher than last year’s estimate of
16.4 billion.  To contact the reporters on this story:
