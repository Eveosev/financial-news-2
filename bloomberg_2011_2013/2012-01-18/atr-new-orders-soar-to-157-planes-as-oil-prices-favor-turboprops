Avions de Transport Regional, the
turboprop-plane venture of  European Aeronautic, Defense & Space
Co.  and  Finmeccanica SpA (FNC) , had the highest order intake in its
30-year history as rising  oil prices  made the aircraft more
attractive than less-efficient jet planes.  The manufacturer won orders for 157 planes last year, as
well as options for 79 more turboprops, with the biggest portion
coming from carriers in the Asia Pacific region, including ATR’s
first order in  Australia , Chief Executive Officer Filippo Bagnato said at a briefing today. ATR delivered 54 planes and
had total revenue of $1.3 billion.  Demand for planes powered by turbo-propellers is soaring,
particularly for regional routes in developing markets such as
 Indonesia  and  Latin America , driven by deregulation and an
increase in  air travel . ATR plans to deliver 72 planes in 2012,
and “at least 80” in 2013, Bagnato said at the briefing in
Paris. It handed over 51 planes in 2010.  ATR’s sales growth is due to its efforts to refresh
offerings with upgraded models, Bagnato said. The venture sells
the 50-seat ATR 42-600 and the 74-seat ATR 72-600 turboprop
models and is evaluating prospects for a 90- to 100-seat model.
Its chief competitor is  Bombardier (BBD/B)  Inc.’s Dash 8, or Q Series
turboprop.  Longevity  “Airlines really appreciate the fact that ATR is investing
largely in the -600 models,” the CEO said. “It reinforces to
the customer, ‘Look, we’re here, ready to put our money into our
product because we want to be the best.’ And this is no small
detail for an airline that, when they buy a plane, expects to
keep it for 20 years.”  Interest from plane-leasing companies was “another good
surprise” in 2011, Bagnato said.  General Electric Co. (GE) ’s Gecas
unit ordered 17 ATR aircraft last year, while Steven Udvar- Hazy’s Air Lease Corp. and Nordic Aviation Capital each ordered
two.  Oil prices continue to play a role, he said. Fuel consumed
in a one-hour flight on an ATR aircraft is about half that used
by a comparably sized jet, he said.  The ATR 72-600 upgrade was certified in May 2011, with 10
delivered last year. The ATR 42-600 is set to be certified later
this year, with entry into service before the end of the year,
Bagnato said.  Competitors  Demand slowed to a trickle at the end of the 1990s as
commuter airlines, especially in the U.S., turned to  Embraer SA (EMBR3) 
of  Brazil  and Montreal-based Bombardier for planes seating fewer
than 100 passengers and providing faster, quieter flights. In
the middle of the last decade, delivery numbers slumped to fewer
than 20 planes a year.  Bagnato said ATR expects to discuss with its shareholders
this year whether investing in a larger model would make sense.
He declined to give specific targets or estimate costs.  The company’s backlog of planes on order is at 224 aircraft
worth $5 billion. ATR is based in Toulouse, France, which is
also home to EADS’s Airbus SAS unit, the world’s biggest
planemaker. Finmeccanica is based in Rome.  Bombardier has 29 Q Series turboprop models in its backlog
as of Oct. 31, less than a year’s production. The company
delivered 48 turboprops in the first 10 months of 2011, the
latest data available.  To contact the reporters on this story:
