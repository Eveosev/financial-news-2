A  Navigant Consulting Inc. (NCI) 
shareholder sued the firm’s top officers on the corporation’s
behalf, arguing that they received an “irrational” pay
increase last year in light of a falling stock price.  “For the past several years, the board has awarded
excessive  executive compensation  despite the fact that Navigant
 shareholders  have seen the value of their investment plummet,”
the investor, Natalie Gordon, said in a complaint filed today in
federal court in  Chicago .  Exercising their right to “say on pay” under the 2010
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, a
majority of company shareholders last year opposed an executive
pay raise later approved by Navigant’s board, she said.  She accused William M. Goodyear, the company’s chairman and
chief executive officer, as well as Chief Operating Officer
Julie M. Howard, Chief Financial Officer Thomas A. Nardi,
General Counsel Monica Weed and seven board  members  of breaching
their fiduciary duties to the Chicago-based company.  Gordon is seeking an award of unspecified money damages on
behalf of Navigant together with a court order compelling the
company to reform and improve its corporate governance.  Carrie Grapenthin, a spokeswoman for the company, didn’t
immediately reply to voice-mail and e-mail messages seeking
comment.  The case is Gordon v. Goodyear, 12-cv-00369, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of  Illinois  (Chicago).  To contact the reporter on this story:
