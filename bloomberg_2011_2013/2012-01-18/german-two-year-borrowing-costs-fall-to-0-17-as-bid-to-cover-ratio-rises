Germany  sold two-year notes at a
record-low yield after ratings action by  Standard & Poor’s  on
Jan. 13 left the nation holding the euro region’s only stable
AAA grade.  The 0.25 percent securities maturing in December 2013 were
sold at an average yield of 0.17 percent, down from 0.29 percent
when the debt was last offered on Dec. 14, and the least since
Bloomberg began collecting the data in 1996. The nation received
bids for 7.596 billion euros ($9.73 billion) of the notes,
exceeding the maximum sales target of 4 billion euros, the
Bundesbank said in a statement. The auction success rate was 190
percent, the most since July 2011.  “S&P’s recent vindication of Germany’s safest-haven status
in combination with the undiminished demand for safety are the
key reasons for today’s strong auction,”  Michael Leister , a
fixed-income strategist at DZ Bank AG in Frankfurt, wrote in an
e-mailed report.  The two-year notes were little changed in the secondary
market after the sale, with the yield at 0.18 percent at 11:59
a.m. London time. Ten-year bunds stayed were also little
changed, with the yield at 0.18 percent.  S&P removed  France  and Austria’s top ratings after
government-bond markets closed on Jan. 13. While Finland, the
Netherlands and Luxembourg kept their AAA ratings, they were put
on negative outlook. Spain and Italy were also among the nations
downgraded and  Portugal  was cut two steps to BB.  To contact the reporter on this story:
