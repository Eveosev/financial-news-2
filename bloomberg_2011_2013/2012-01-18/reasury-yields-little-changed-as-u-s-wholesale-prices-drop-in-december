Treasury yields were little changed
after a government report showed producer prices unexpectedly
dropped in December.  U.S. producer prices decreased 0.1 percent after a 0.3
percent gain in the previous month. That compared with a 0.1
percent median forecast of 74 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News. Consumer prices rose 0.1 percent last month after being
unchanged in November, according to a separate survey before the
data’s release tomorrow. The U.S. jobless rate has been more
than 8 percent for almost three years.  “We haven’t had any hints of inflation in the United
States in a couple months,” said  Mark Grant , a managing
director at Southwest Securities Inc. in  Fort Lauderdale ,
Florida. “The U.S. will be significantly affected by the
recession in  Europe  -- which is already on the way -- and
consequently producer and consumer prices in the U.S. will be
noticeably less, either neutral or slightly deflationary at
least, over the next quarter or possibly two quarters.”  Ten-year  yields  were little changed at 1.85 percent at 8:33
a.m. New York time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices.
The yield fell to 1.80 percent on Dec. 19, the least since Oct.
4. The two-year note yield was little changed at 0.22 percent.
That compares with a record 0.143 percent reached Sept. 20.  To contact the reporters on this story:
