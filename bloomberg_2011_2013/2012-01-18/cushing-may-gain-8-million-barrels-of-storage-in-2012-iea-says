Oil storage facilities in Cushing,
 Oklahoma , will gain 7 million to 8 million barrels of additional
capacity in 2012 as rising supply creates “bottlenecks” at the
pricing point for crude futures traded in  New York , the
International Energy Agency said.  The capacity to stockpile oil in tanks increased 11 to 14
million barrels last year after rising by no more than 5 million
barrels a year between 2005 and 2010, the Paris-based agency
said in a monthly report today.  “Storage capacity expansion may continue at an accelerated
pace until such time as pipeline capacity to evacuate crude to
coastal refining centers catches up,” the IEA said.  West Texas Intermediate crude on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  has traded at a discount of as much as $28 a barrel to
London-traded Brent over the past year as the volume of
inventories at Cushing rose.  “Thanks to technologies such as hydraulic fracturing,
output of light, tight oil from locations such as  North Dakota 
and Texas has surged, while output from the Alberta oil sands
also continues to ramp up,” the IEA said. “Amid bottlenecks in
the ability to ship crude onward to refining centers on the U.S.
Gulf and East coasts, storage build has become more of a
necessity than an option.”  The storing of crude was encouraged by so-called contango,
where oil for delivery several months in the future sells at a
higher price than oil for delivery at the end of the month, the
IEA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
