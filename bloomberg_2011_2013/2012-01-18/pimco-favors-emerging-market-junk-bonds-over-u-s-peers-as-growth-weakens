Bonds sold by non-investment-grade
companies in  emerging markets  are more attractive than debt from
junk-rated U.S. peers because the developing-nation borrowers
are better prepared to withstand a global economic slowdown,
according to Pacific Investment Management Co.  Emerging-market high-yield debt “looks attractive on a
relative basis,” Brigitte Posch, an emerging-markets portfolio
manager at Pimco, which operates the world’s largest bond fund,
wrote in a note on the  company’s website . Developing-nation
policy makers have more room for stimulus measures while the
companies have more cash reserves and lower debt levels than
their U.S. counterparts, she wrote.  At 10.26 percent, the average junk bond yield in emerging
markets was 232 basis points above U.S. high-yielding
securities, according to data compiled by Bank of America
Merrill Lynch. The gap widened from 88 basis points, or 0.88
percentage point, at the end of August.  To contact the reporters on this story:
