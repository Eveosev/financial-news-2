Elpida Memory Inc. (6665) , a Japanese
chipmaker reorganizing with government support, rose the most in
almost two months in Tokyo trading after the Yomiuri reported
it’s seeking a capital alliance with  Micron Technology Inc. (MU)   Elpida gained as much as 13 percent, the biggest intraday
advance since Nov. 25, before trading 7.6 percent higher at 327
yen as of 10:11 a.m. on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  The Tokyo-based company told lenders it intends to boost
its share in the market for dynamic random access memory chips
jointly with Micron, the Yomiuri newspaper reported today,
without saying where it got the information.  “The company isn’t the source of the information in the
report,” Elpida said in a statement. Elpida is “discussing
advanced payments and capital investments with customers and is
in talks with banks over refinancing its borrowing to ensure its
operations,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
