OPEC (OPCRTOTL)  members led by Saudi Arabia
increased exports of oil in November from a month earlier as
demand for the group’s crude increased, data submitted by
governments to the Joint Organization Data Initiative showed.  Saudi Arabia, the largest producer in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, raised exports by 721,000 barrels
a day to 7.8 million barrels a day in November from a month
earlier, according to  JODI  data.  Iran, the group’s second-largest producer, increased its
exports by 5,000 barrels a day in November to 2.02 million
barrels a day, the data showed. Iraq raised exports to 2.14
million barrels a day, while Ecuador boosted shipments by 8.2
percent and Qatar by 2.3 percent. Nigeria kept its deliveries
unchanged last month at 2.28 million. Venezuela and  Angola 
lowered exports during the month, while Kuwait,  United Arab
Emirates ,  Libya , and Algeria didn’t submit data for the month.  OPEC decided on Dec. 14 to increase its production ceiling
to 30 million barrels a day, the first change in three years,
moving the group’s target nearer to actual output as it sought
to accommodate rising exports from Libya.  OPEC, provider of about 40 percent of the world’s oil, will
need to produce 30.1 million barrels a day to balance global
crude supply and demand in 2012, the group’s secretariat said on
Jan. 16. That’s up 60,000 barrels from its forecast last month.  World oil consumption will advance 1.1 million barrels a
day, or 1.2 percent in 2012 to 88.9 million this year, OPEC said
in the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
