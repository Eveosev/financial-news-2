Grupo Bimbo SAB (BIMBOA) , the world’s largest
bread maker, plans to sell $800 million of 10-year notes today
in its first bond offering in more than 18 months.  Grupo Bimbo, based in Mexico City, plans to sell the bonds
to yield 270 basis points, or 2.7 percentage points, more than
similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries, down from a 287.5 basis-point
spread initially planned, said the person, who asked not to be
identified because final terms aren’t set.  Grupo Bimbo last issued debt in June 2010, when it sold
$800 million of 4.875 percent of senior unsecured notes due in
ten years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Yields on
investment grade corporate bonds in the U.S. have fallen to 3.74
percent, compared to 4.41 percent the last time Grupo Bimbo
issued a bond, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index
data.  The sale will be managed by Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria
SA, Citigroup Inc. and Banco Santander SA, the person said.
Proceeds of the offering may be used to refinance debt and for
general corporate purposes.  The company has 750 million pesos ($56.2 million) of debt
 maturing  on May 3, Bloomberg data show.  Grupo Bimbo is rated Baa2 by Moody’s Investors Service and
an equivalent BBB by  Standard & Poor’s .  To contact the reporters on this story:
