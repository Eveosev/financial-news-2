The dollar held a two-day decline
against the euro amid signs the  U.S. economy  is gaining momentum
and as Asian and European stocks extended a global rally,
damping demand for safer assets.  The Australian dollar weakened for the first time in three
days after a government report showed employers unexpectedly
reduced payrolls.  New Zealand ’s currency fell from an 11-week
high after a government report showed consumer prices declined.
Demand for the euro was tempered before  Greece  and its creditors
start a second day of talks between on a debt-swap plan.  “The U.S. recovery is the only reason that can justify the
current risk-on markets,” said Junichi Ishikawa, an analyst in
Tokyo at IG Markets Securities Ltd. “When stocks are higher,
investors tend to sell currencies” such as the dollar.  The dollar was little changed at $1.2846 per euro at 8:14
a.m. in  London  after sliding 1 percent yesterday the most since
Nov. 11. The greenback fell 0.1 percent to 76.77 yen. The euro
dropped 0.2 percent to 98.64 yen.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  of shares advanced 0.9 percent,
and the Stoxx Europe 600 Index gained 0.2 percent.  Jobless claims  in the U.S. fell to 384,000 last week from
399,000 the previous week, according to a Bloomberg News survey
before today’s report. Factory output climbed 0.9 percent last
month, the biggest increase since December 2010, the  Federal
Reserve  said yesterday.  Greek Talks  The Institute of International Finance, which represents
private creditors to Greece, resumed negotiations yesterday
after talks last week broke off over failure to agree with the
government about how much money investors will lose by swapping
their bonds. Greece could forge an agreement on a voluntary debt
swap with creditors by the end of this week, one finance
ministry official told reporters in  Athens  yesterday.  The European economy will probably contract 1.2 percent to
1.5 percent in 2012, Adam Gilmour, Citigroup Inc.’s Asia-Pacific
head of foreign-exchange sales and derivatives, said in
Singapore today. Gilmour said he is “quite bearish” on the
common currency.  The yen has advanced 8.7 percent in the past six months,
the best performance among the 10 currencies tracked by the
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar has risen 6.7
percent, while the euro has fallen 3.7 percent.  French Debt Sale  France  is scheduled to auction today bonds maturing in more
than a year for the first time since S&P stripped the nation of
its AAA credit rating on Jan. 13. The country will offer debt
whose maturities range from 2014 to 2040. Spain plans to sell as
much as 4.5 billion euros of notes and bonds maturing in 2016,
2019 and 2022 today.  “I’m very bearish about the euro,” said Kurt Magnus,
executive director of currency sales in Sydney at Nomura
Holdings Inc.,  Japan ’s biggest brokerage. “The situation in
 Europe  is still very, very poor.”  The Australian dollar weakened against all of its 16 major
counterparts after the statistics bureau said the number of
people employed dropped by 29,300 in December. Economists had
estimated an increase of 10,000.  “The knee-jerk reaction was to take the Aussie dollar
lower,” said Mike Jones, a currency strategist at Bank of New
Zealand in Wellington.  Australia’s currency dropped 0.5 percent to $1.0389, and
fell 0.6 percent to 79.73 yen.  New Zealand Dollar  New Zealand’s currency weakened after the statistics bureau
said consumer prices declined 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter
from the previous three-month period.  “There are no inflation pressures in New Zealand at the
moment and that means the  Reserve Bank  can do nothing for even
longer than it intended,” said  Imre Speizer , a strategist in
Auckland at Westpac Banking Corp., Australia’s second-largest
lender. “It’s kiwi dollar negative and also negative for
shorter-maturity yields.”  The New Zealand dollar slid 0.4 percent to 80.16 U.S. cents
after rising to 80.82 yesterday, the strongest since Nov. 1.  To contact the reporters on this story:
