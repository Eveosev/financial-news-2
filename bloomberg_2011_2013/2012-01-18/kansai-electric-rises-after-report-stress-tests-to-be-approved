Kansai Electric Power Co. (9503)  rose the
most in five months in Tokyo trading after NHK Television
reported  Japan ’s nuclear watchdog may approve the results of
stress tests on two of the utility’s reactors.  The shares rose as much as 5.2 percent, the biggest gain
since August, to 1,286 yen on the Tokyo Stock Exchange and were
quoted at 1,275 yen at the midday trading break.  The Nuclear and Industry Safety Agency may today announce
its approval of the outcomes of the first phases of stress tests
on the reactors at Kansai Electric’s Ohi plant in western Japan,
NHK reported, without saying how it got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
