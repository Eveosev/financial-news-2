Korea Electric Power Corp. (KEP)  plans to
build a 300 billion-CFA franc ($585 million) coal-fired power
plant in  Senegal , which will boost the West African nation’s
energy output by 250 megawatts.  The funding will come from the Korean  company  and the
Korean Development Bank, who will be able to sell the energy
solely to Senegal, Mamadou Diallo, spokesman for the country’s
energy utility, Societe National d’Electricite, said today by
phone from Dakar, the capital. The agreement was signed
yesterday, he said.  “The outcome of this project will allow us in the short
term to significantly reduce the cost of production of
electricity and subsequently the cost of the kilowatt hour to
our clientele,” Senelec said in an e-mailed statement.  In December, Energy Minister Karim Wade said the power
station would reduce the cost of electricity by 50 percent and
boost economic growth by 2 percentage points a year.  The power station will be in operation by 2015 and will be
built as two units generating producing 125 megawatts each at
Sendou, 32 kilometers (20 miles) from Dakar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
