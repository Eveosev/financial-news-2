German President  Christian Wulff  has
dropped tentative plans to attend the  World Economic Forum  in
Switzerland due to scheduling reasons, his spokeswoman said.  “There were ideas and discussions” about Wulff attending
the event in Davos, Switzerland, next week, spokeswoman Petra
Diroll said in a phone interview in Berlin today. “There never
was a firm trip schedule.”  Elected to the largely ceremonial post in 2010 with
Chancellor Angela Merkel’s backing, Wulff has been pilloried by
politicians and the public for trying to intervene in the
publication of a story about a private loan he used to buy a
house. He has called the attempt to influence Bild newspaper a
“terrible mistake.”  Wulff had planned to meet German company executives at the
annual gathering, according to  Bild  newspaper, which first
reported his decision not to attend. Diroll said she didn’t know
whom Wulff had intended to meet in Davos.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
