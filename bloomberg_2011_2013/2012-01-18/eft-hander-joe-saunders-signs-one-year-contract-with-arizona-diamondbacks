Former All-Star pitcher Joe Saunders
signed a one-year contract with the  Arizona Diamondbacks ,
General Manager Kevin Towers said.  Saunders, 30, was 12-13 last season with a 3.69 earned run
average, with 67 walks and 108 strikeouts in 212 innings, while
tying his career high with 33 starts.  “We’re confident his veteran leadership, familiarity in
the clubhouse and understanding of the culture we’ve built will
help us continue working towards a championship,” Towers said
last night in a statement. The team didn’t disclose terms.  During a career that spans parts of seven Major League
Baseball seasons with the Diamondbacks and Los Angeles Angels,
the left-hander is 69-52 with a 4.16 ERA in 161 starts.  Saunders, who was acquired by the Diamondbacks from the
