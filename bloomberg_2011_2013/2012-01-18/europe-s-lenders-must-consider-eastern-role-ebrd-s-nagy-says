Western European lenders must
consider their “systemic” role in the region’s eastern nations
as the financial industry responds to recent crises, said
 Piroska Nagy , director of country strategy and policy at the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.  “We are talking about change, accommodating and financing
change as opposed to maintaining support,” Nagy said today in
an interview in Vienna. “There’s deleveraging, there’s
recapitalization, regulatory changes, there’s a lot going on.
Change is fine and good, but it has to be managed in a way that
doesn’t cause systemic risks.”  Regulators and policy makers are trying to shield growth in
eastern Europe against contagion from the euro area’s deepening
debt crisis. New capital and liquidity requirements for the
western lenders that control three-quarters of eastern Europe’s
banking market threaten to curb credit needed to fund companies
and households in the region.  The  International Monetary Fund , the  European Investment
Bank , the EBRD and the World Bank “will engage at a heightened
level with the region,” Nagy said, without elaborating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
