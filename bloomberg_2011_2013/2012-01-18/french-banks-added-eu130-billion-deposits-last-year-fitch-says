French banks added about 130 billion
euros ($167 billion) in deposits last year and made their
funding “more robust” as funds flowed out from European money-
market funds,  Fitch Ratings  said.  “The banks have increased  interest rates  on their
deposits, especially for introductory periods,” Fitch said in
an e-mailed statement today. “This is a trend we have seen, to
a lesser extent, in several European markets.”  About 55 billion euros flowed out from European money-
market funds in 2011, Fitch said, citing data from Lipper
Investment Management. That includes about 31 billion euros from
French money-market funds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
