China Travel Service Holdings Ltd (CTSHHZ) .
plans to sign a club loan of more than HK$1.5 billion and less
than HK$1.8 billion this week with commitments from as many as
seven banks, said two people familiar with the matter.  The loan pays an all-in rate, which includes margin and
fees of more than 200 basis points more than the  Hong Kong 
interbank offered rate, said one of the people declining to be
identified because the details are private.  Proceeds of the loan will be used to refinance an earlier
facility, the people said. China Travel in 2007 signed a HK$2.2
billion five-year loan maturing in May that pays a margin of 36
basis points over the Hong Kong interbank offered rate,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A club loan is not
marketed to additional lenders in syndication.  To contact the reporter on this story:
