Proposed sanctions on Iranian oil
imports may tighten the global market from the middle of this
year, the  International Energy Agency  said.  A European Union ban could come into force within six
months, the Paris-based adviser said in its monthly report
today. EU foreign ministers are scheduled to meet on Jan. 23 to
discuss the issue.  “A target of six months is gaining traction, since it
would dovetail with the U.S. law,” the report said. “This
would tend to suggest a measure that would have a material
impact on physical supplies from  Iran  from mid-summer onwards.”  France,  Germany  and the U.K. have been pushing for an oil
embargo to increase pressure on Iran over its nuclear program. A
European embargo of Iranian oil will probably be delayed for six
months to let countries such as Greece, Italy and Spain find
alternative supplies, two EU officials with knowledge of the
talks said on Jan. 13. The U.S. tightened sanctions on Dec. 31,
denying access to America's financial system to any foreign bank
that conducts business with the Central Bank of Iran.  Iran (OPCRIRAN)  exported 2.5 million barrels a day of crude in the
first 10 months of 2011, including more than 200,000 barrels a
day of condensates, the IEA said.  The EU imported about 600,000 barrels a day of oil, while
 Japan  and  South Korea  bought a collective 550,000 barrels a day.
Deliveries into China and  India  were 550,000 barrels a day and
310,000 barrels a day respectively, according to the agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
