Australia (AUFAXCRP) , seeking to ease concerns
about foreign investment in the nation’s agricultural assets,
will conduct more surveys into overseas sales to improve
transparency, Assistant Treasurer Mark Arbib said.  The  Australian Bureau of Statistics  will collect data on
foreign investment every two years, Arbib  said  in a statement
today as the government released guidance on factors it
considers in assessing overseas applications.  “Australians can be confident that we have a strong and
robust system in place to protect the national interest while
also supporting the economy and jobs,” Arbib said. “The
government applies a rigorous national interest test to all
foreign investment applications.”  The report comes amid concern that overseas buyers, trying
to secure supply to meet surging demand for food, may boost
purchases of agricultural assets in a nation set to be the
world’s second-largest wheat exporter. About 89 percent of
Australia’s agricultural land and about 99 percent of
agricultural businesses are entirely  Australian owned , according
to the statistics bureau.  The government typically considers the effect of an
investment proposal on the quality and availability of
 Australia ’s agricultural resources, land access and use,
production, employment and the nation’s capacity to remain a
reliable supplier, according to today’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
