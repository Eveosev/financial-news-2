Argentina ’s Mendoza province plans
to sell 1.2 billion pesos ($280 million) in bonds in the second
quarter, Finance Minister Marcelo Costa said.  The bonds may be sold in local or global markets, Costa
said in an interview from the western province. Costa and
Mendoza Governor Francisco Perez plan to visit New York in
February to discuss the sale with potential investors.  Funds from the sale will be used to finance infrastructure
projects, Costa said. The minister said “it’s too early” to
discuss what the bonds may yield.  To contact the reporter on this story:
