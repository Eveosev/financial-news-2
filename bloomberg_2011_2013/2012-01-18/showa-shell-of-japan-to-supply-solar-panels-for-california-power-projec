Showa Shell Sekiyu K.K. (5002)  of Japan
will supply as much as 150 megawatts of thin-film solar panels
to a North American renewable energy unit of  EDF Energies
Nouvelles SA. (EEN)   The panel contract is worth more than 10 billion yen ($130
million), Akane Yamiya, a spokeswoman for Show Shell unit  Solar
Frontier K.K. (SOLARZ)  said by phone today in  Tokyo . She declined to give
further details.  Solar Frontier is supplying the panels to enXco Inc. for a
solar park project in Kern County, California, which will be
built in two phases, the companies said in a  statement 
yesterday.  About 60 megawatts of generation capacity is targeted to go
online by the end of the year and the rest of the project by
June 2013. The plant will generate enough power for about 35,000
homes a year, the companies said.  Solar Frontier will supply panels using copper, indium,
gallium and selenium, known as CIGS, produced at a factory in
Miyazaki prefecture in southwestern  Japan , according to Yamiya.  The company has annual capacity of about 1,000 megawatts at
its three factories, all in Miyazaki.  “We are considering increasing our capacity,” Yamiya
said, without commenting further.  To contact the reporter on this story:
