U.K.  unemployment  rose to the
highest rate in 16 years in the quarter through November,
deepening concerns Britain is heading for another recession as
turmoil in the euro area damps the global economic outlook.  The  unemployment rate  based on International Labour
Organization methods rose to 8.4 percent, the highest since
January 1996, from 8.1 percent in the three months through
August, the  Office for National Statistics  said today in London.
The number of people claiming  jobless benefits  rose for a 10th
month to 1.6 million, the most since January 2010.  Ernst & Young LLP’s ITEM Club said on Jan. 16 that Britain
has slipped back into a recession and  Europe ’s inability to end
the debt crisis has had a “debilitating effect” on the U.K.
Prime Minister  David Cameron  is counting on hiring at private
companies as his government axes hundreds of thousands of
public-sector jobs to tackle the  budget deficit . Firms from
banks to retailers are cutting jobs as the outlook deteriorates.  “The economy is not growing much and if you extrapolate
that over the next six months, jobs are going to pretty hard to
find,” said  Peter Dixon , an economist at Commerzbank AG in
London. “Unemployment could become one of the main economic and
political issues this year and may well be one of the triggers
for more stimulus from the Bank of England.”  The pound was trading at $1.5382 as of 10:12 a.m., up 0.2
percent from yesterday. The yield on the 10-year government bond
was little changed at 1.97 percent.  ‘Huge Priority’  Unemployment measured by ILO methods rose by 118,000 in the
three months through November to 2.69 million, the highest since
1994. The number of people in work increased 18,000 to 29.1
million, while the employment rate declined to 70.3 percent from
70.4 percent.  Employment Minister Chris Grayling said the increase in
employment showed private companies created jobs at a faster
pace than the government eliminated them.  “This a huge priority for us,” he told BBC television.
“Unemployment is much too high. There’s no question about that.
We are taking what measures we can in extraordinarily difficult
times.”  He said much of the increase in unemployment reflected
full-time students looking for part-time work and women
returning to the labor market after time out to look after
children. The number of people classified as economically
inactive fell by 61,000 to 9.29 million in the latest quarter.  ‘Not Looking Good’  The data for December show that jobless claims rose less
than economists forecast, jumping by 1,200 after a revised
increase of 200 in November. Economists had  forecast  an increase
of 7,000, according to the median of 25 estimates in a Bloomberg
News survey.  “Jobless claims may have not risen by as much as expected,
but it’s not looking good,” Dixon said.  While the economy grew at the fastest pace in a year in the
third quarter, the  Bank of England  has said the fourth quarter
will probably not see any expansion. The central bank is in the
final month of a 75 billion-pound ($115 billion) round of bond
purchases to boost growth, and economists at Citigroup Inc. and
Nomura International Plc expect a further expansion of stimulus
next month.  Premier Foods Plc (<PFD>) , the maker of Hovis bread, said yesterday
it plans to cut 600 jobs, 5 percent of its workforce, in a bid
to save 40 million pounds by next year while gift retailer Past
Times collapsed with the loss of more than 500 jobs.  Unemployment among 16-24-year-olds climbed by 52,000 to
1.04 million, or 22.3 percent, the highest rate since comparable
records began in 1992.  Pay Squeeze  Today’s report showed that annual pay growth slowed to 1.9
percent in the quarter through November from 2.1 percent in the
three months through October, remaining well below the pace of
inflation. Weekly pay excluding bonuses accelerated to 1.9
percent from 1.8 percent. Data yesterday showed inflation slowed
to 4.2 percent in December, compared with 4.8 percent the
previous month.  The data also showed that 988,000 workdays were lost in
November, the most since 1989. The loss was largely due to a
strike by public workers protesting government cuts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
