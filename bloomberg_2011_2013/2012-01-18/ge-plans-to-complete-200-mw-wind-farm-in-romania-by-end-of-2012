General Electric Co. (GE)  plans to
complete the installation of 200 megawatts of  wind turbines  in
Romania at a wind park developed by  CEZ AS (CEZ)  by the end of the
year as scheduled.  “The connection of the 200 megawatts to the country’s
power system, operated by Transelectrica SA, depends on the
grid’s capacity and functionality,” Carmen Neagu, a director at
GE’s Romanian unit, said in an interview in Bucharest today.  GE has already installed wind turbines with a combined
capacity of 400 megawatts in the project in Romania’s southern
Dobrogea region. The most recent installation will make it
Romania’s biggest wind park with a capacity of 600 megawatts.  Romania had an installed wind-energy capacity of about 982
megawatts at the end of last year, out of which about 850
megawatts were fully operational, Dana Duica, head of the
Romanian Wind Association, said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
