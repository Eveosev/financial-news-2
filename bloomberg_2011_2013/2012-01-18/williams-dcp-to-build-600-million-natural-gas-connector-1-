Williams Partners LP (WPZ)  and  DCP
Midstream Partners LP (DPM)  plan a $600 million expansion of the
Discovery natural-gas pipeline system in the deep-water  Gulf of
Mexico .  The pipeline will connect the Keathley Canyon, Walker Ridge
and Green Canyon, oil and gas-producing areas in the deep-water
Gulf, to the Discovery system, the companies said in a statement
today.  Construction is expected to begin in 2013 and the connector
will begin operation in mid-2014, according to the statement.
The 215-mile (345-kilometer) pipeline will be capable of
gathering more than 400 million cubic feet of gas a day.  “It will run in close proximity to several known
discoveries and numerous planned-to-be-drilled prospects,” Rory Miller, president of Tulsa, Oklahoma-based Williams Partners’
midstream business, said in the statement. DCP is based in
Denver.  To contact the reporter on this story:
