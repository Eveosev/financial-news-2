German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  will
open next week’s  World Economic Forum  in Davos, Switzerland,
which will be attended by policy makers and business leaders
including U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner.  Merkel’s speech will lead into a program that begins with a
debate on whether capitalism is failing society, with panelists
including  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  Chief Executive Officer Brian T. Moynihan and Sharan Burrow, general secretary of the
International Trade Union Confederation, the forum said today.  “We are in danger of completely losing the confidence of
future generations,” Klaus Schwab, founder of the World
Economic Forum, told reporters in Geneva. “We have the
impression of a global burnout.”  European Central Bank President Mario Draghi and
International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde
will mix with 1,600 executives from firms including  Citigroup
Inc. (C)  and Royal Dutch Shell Plc at the five-day meeting that
starts in the Swiss ski resort on Jan. 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
