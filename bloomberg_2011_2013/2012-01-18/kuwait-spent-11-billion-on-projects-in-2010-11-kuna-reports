Kuwait spent 3.19 billion dinars
($11.4 billion) in the 2010-11 fiscal year on projects for a
four-year development plan,  KUNA  reported, citing Adel al-
Wuqayan, secretary-general of the Supreme Council for Planning
and Development.  Spending came to almost 62% of the amount originally
allocated under the plan for that year, the state-run news
service said. Most of the money was assigned to energy projects,
followed by infrastructure investment, al-Wuqayan told KUNA.  Kuwait wants investors to meet almost half the cost of its
$110 billion development plan to modernize the oil-based
economy. The investments include increasing oil and gas
production, construction of a metro and rail network, the
expansion of the airport, new power stations, cities, hospitals,
roads and a port on Boubyan Island.  Kuwait had a budget surplus of 5.3 billion dinars in the
2010-11 fiscal year. Spending was 16.2 billion dinars, 7 percent
less than anticipated, according to Finance Ministry data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
