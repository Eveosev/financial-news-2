The former chief financial officer
of Columbus Hill Capital Management LP, an investment management
firm based in Short Hills,  New Jersey , pleaded guilty to
embezzling more than $10.4 million.  David Newmark, 39, admitted in federal court in Newark, New
Jersey, that he created a phony account to collect deposits that
he stole from the company. Newmark, who pleaded guilty to wire
fraud and  tax evasion , agreed to forfeit $10.4 million.  “Making personal use of company cash, it was only a matter
of time before he was caught with his hand in the piggy bank,”
U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman said in a statement.  Newmark, of Towaco, New Jersey, faces as many as 20 years
in prison on the fraud charge and five years on the tax evasion
count. U.S. District Judge William Walls set sentencing for
April 24.  Newmark’s attorney, Michael Himmel, didn’t immediately
return a call seeking comment on the plea.  To contact the reporter on this story:
