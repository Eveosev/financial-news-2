PPR SA (PP) , the French owner of the
Gucci luxury brand, is considering selling Redcats’ Avenue
clothing business in the U.S. as part of a bankruptcy filing for
the brand, according to a person with knowledge of the plan.  Two private-equity funds are interested in as much as 60
percent of the chain’s stores, while a third fund would consider
buying all of them, said the person, who declined to be
identified because the plans are private. Avenue sells women’s
clothing in sizes 14 and up in more than 500 stores. No decision
has been made, and continuing the business is another option PPR
is considering, the person said.  “The decision has been taken to focus Redcats USA’s growth
strategy on the Internet and to sell this brand,” Emmanuelle
Picard-Deyme, a spokeswoman for Redcats, said by e-mail.
“Redcats is concentrating on finding a new owner for Avenue and
will choose the best option for the brand and its development
outside of the group.”  PPR rose 15 cents to 116.20 euros as of 11:47 a.m. in Paris.
The company said in October that it would discontinue Avenue
within a few months. The Paris-based company was in talks with
investors interested in buying all of Redcats at the time, a
month after it suspended a formal process to sell the division.  Redcats’ brands include La Redoute and Castaluna in Europe
and BrylaneHome, KingSize and the Golf Warehouse in the U.S.  To contact the reporters on this story:
