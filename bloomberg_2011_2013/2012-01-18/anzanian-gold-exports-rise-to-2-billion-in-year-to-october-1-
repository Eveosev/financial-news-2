Gold exports from  Tanzania , which
vies with Mali for the title of  Africa ’s third-biggest producer
of the metal, rose by 33 percent in the year through October.  Shipments climbed to $2 billion from $1.5 billion in the
same period a year earlier, the Bank of Tanzania said in an e-
mailed report today on the country’s international trade.  The current-account deficit, the widest measure of trade in
goods and services, grew 65.4 percent to $4.08 billion, it said.
Exports rose to $6.7 billion from $5.5 billion on higher world
gold prices and imports were $11.2 billion, from $8.6 billion.  Oil imports, the most costly for the nation, increased 43.8
percent to $2.8 billion on higher global prices, the report
said. Shipments of most agricultural commodities fell. Foreign-
exchange reserves were $3.62 billion by October, enough to cover
four months of projected imports. The debt of East Africa’s
second-biggest economy grew to $12.5 billion in October.  Following are agricultural exports in the past three years
through October:
