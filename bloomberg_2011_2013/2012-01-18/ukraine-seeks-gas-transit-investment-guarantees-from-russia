Ukraine is asking Russia for
guarantees on natural-gas transit volumes and investments in
pipelines as it considers sharing management of the export route
to Europe and seeks a new supply contract.  “I’m sure we’ll find a compromise,” Ukrainian Energy and
Coal Minister  Yuriy Boyko  told reporters in Kiev today after
holding “constructive” talks yesterday with officials from the
Russian gas export monopoly,  OAO Gazprom. (GAZP)   Ukraine plans to cut Russian gas imports about 48 percent
from contracted volumes this year or agree to lower prices as it
seeks to revive a $15.6 billion bailout from the  International
Monetary Fund . Prices have climbed higher than $400 per 1,000
cubic meters, as Gazprom rejects Ukraine’s bid to revise the
contract.  The former Soviet republic may boost gas purchases if the
price drops, Boyko said. Ukraine, which holds parliamentary
elections in October, must agree on a lower price with Russia
within a month or bow to IMF demands for a 30 percent jump in
household gas fees.  Ukraine favors forming a group with the European Union and
 Russia  to manage its pipeline system, Boyko said. About 80
percent of Gazprom’s Europe-bound gas deliveries cross through
Ukraine. The Moscow-based producer supplies 25 percent of the EU
market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
