Doha Bank QSC (DHBK) , Qatar’s third-largest
bank by total loans, posted an 18 percent increase in 2011
profit to 1.24 billion riyal ($340 million), meeting analysts’
estimates.  Chief Executive Officer  Raghavan Seetharaman , who announced
the results in a news conference in Doha, said non-performing
loans were 3.3 percent of total loans. The mean estimate of nine
analysts was for adjusted net income of 1.24 billion riyals,
according to  data compiled by Bloomberg .  Banks are benefiting from an increase in lending in Qatar,
the world’s biggest producer of liquefied natural gas, as the
country spends on new roads, an airport and other
infrastructure. Qatar, which will host the  World Cup  in 2022,
had the world’s fastest growing economy for a second straight
year in 2011, according to the  International Monetary Fund .  “Infrastructure creation will give corporate and
commercial banking tender bonds, fee income,” Seetharaman said
in a Bloomberg TV interview. “That’s the driving force for
banks to have good revenue generation. Banking or insurance,
asset management or other sectors should get stimulated by
government expenditure.”  Qatar National Bank, the country’s biggest lender, reported
on Jan. 9 a better-than-expected 32 percent rise in full-year
profit. Qatar Islamic Bank said net income for the year rose 8
percent.  Doha Bank stock  fell 0.8 percent to 64.9 riyals a share on
the Qatar Exchange today, before the financial results were
posted.  To contact the reporter on this story:
