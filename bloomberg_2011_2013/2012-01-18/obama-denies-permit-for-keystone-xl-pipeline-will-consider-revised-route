The Obama administration denied a
permit for  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) â€™s Keystone XL oil pipeline and will
let the company file a revised route that avoids an
environmentally sensitive area in Nebraska.  The decision by the State Department today was praised by
environmentalists, who said the pipeline would add to U.S.
greenhouse-gas emissions, and was decried by the U.S. oil and
gas industry and Republian lawmakers, who had pushed President
 Barack Obama  to approve the project as a way to create jobs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
