France â€™s  upper house  of parliament
law committee rejected a bill that would make it a crime to deny
genocides, Agence France-Presse reported.  The committee, which reviews bills before they are voted
on, said the legislation would be unconstitutional, the  news
agency  reported. The full Senate, where a majority of lawmakers
are in favor of the bill, is still scheduled to vote on Jan. 23,
AFP said. It was approved by the lower chamber on Dec. 22.  Turkey froze political and military relations with France
in retaliation for the approval by the National Assembly of the
measure that would make it a crime to deny genocides, including
the genocide against Armenians a century ago.  To contact the reporters on this story:
