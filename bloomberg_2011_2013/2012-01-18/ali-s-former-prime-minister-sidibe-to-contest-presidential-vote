Mali’s former prime minister, Modibo Sidibe, will run for president in an election planned for April,
he said yesterday.  “I count on the support of all Malians to ensure a
harmonious development of the country,” said in a speech in
Bamako, the capital, adding that he will run as an independent
candidate.  Sidibe stepped down as prime minister in March last year,
according to a statement from President Amadou Toumani Toure,
which didn’t give a reason. Toure has served two terms in office
and is expected to step down.  To contact the reporter on this story:
