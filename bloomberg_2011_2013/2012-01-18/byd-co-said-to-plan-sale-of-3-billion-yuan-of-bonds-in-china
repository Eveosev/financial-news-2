BYD Co. (1211HK) , the Chinese automaker part-
owned by Warren Buffett’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , plans to sell
3 billion yuan ($475 million) of bonds, according to a person
familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because
the details are private.  The sale is part of the 6 billion yuan of note issues
approved in September by the securities regulator. The yield on
BYD’s 1 billion yuan of bonds sold in  Hong Kong  and due 2014 has
surged 1,539 basis points, or 15.39 percentage points, to 19.93
percent since the notes were issued in April, according to
Sinopac Securities Corp. prices.  BYD, which is investing in the development of electric
buses and cars, reported a 25 percent plunge in vehicle sales
last year as the popularity of its best-selling F3 sedan model
waned amid competition from rivals such as General Motors Co..
The company said on Oct. 28 its full-year profit may drop by as
much as 65 percent.  BYD has 16 billion yuan of bonds and loans outstanding,
including a 15 billion yuan loan maturing this year, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s five times the 3 billion
yuan of bonds from Dongfeng Motor Group Co. due in 2012.
Dongfeng operates ventures with Nissan Motor Co. and Honda Motor
Co. in  China .  Shares of BYD fell  59 percent last year  in Hong Kong,
compared with a 20 percent decline in the  Hang Seng Index .  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
