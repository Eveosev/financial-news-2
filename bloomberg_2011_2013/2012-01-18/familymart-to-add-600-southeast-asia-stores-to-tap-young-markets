FamilyMart Co. (8028) , Japan’s largest
convenience store operator in Southeast  Asia , plans to open 600
stores in Indonesia and the Philippines, tapping demand from
young people as an aging population saps growth at home.  The retailer intends to have 300 stores in each country by
2015, expanding on a network that includes more than 10,700
shops outside Japan, Masaaki Kosaka, director of overseas
operations, said in an interview. He declined to say how much
the expansion would cost.  FamilyMart joins larger Japanese competitors  Lawson Inc. (2651) 
and Seven & I Holdings Co. in planning to open more stores in
faster-growing Asian countries. The  International Monetary Fund 
forecasts 5.6 percent economic growth this year in  Southeast
Asia , double Japan’s 2.3 percent target, as relatively young
populations drive consumption.  Younger people “will definitely want the convenience of a
convenience store, and there is trust in things from Japan,
especially in Indonesia,” Kosaka said Jan. 13 in Tokyo.  FamilyMart has  targeted  an increase in the portion of
profit from overseas to 20 percent by 2015 and forecasts an 10
percent gain in operating income to 42.1 billion yen ($549
million) for the fiscal year ending Feb. 28.  The retailer got about 3.2 billion yen, 7.3 percent of
total operating income, from stores it operates in Asia outside
Japan and under ventures in  Thailand  and  Taiwan  last year.  The chain had 8,697 stores in Japan and 10,782 franchisers
in Taiwan,  South Korea , Thailand,  China , the  United States , and
 Vietnam  as of the three months ended Nov. 30, Junji Ueda, chief
executive officer, said on the company’s website.  ‘Right Strategy’  Expanding to Indonesia and the Philippines “is the right
strategy for them,” Mikihiko Yamato, an analyst at JI Asia,
said by telephone. “They are taking a long-term view and will
only see the results of the decision now reflected in their
bottom lines in about eight years.”  The population of Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam,
Thailand and Malaysia will expand by about 6.6 percent, or 14
million people, from this year to 553 million by 2016, according
to International Monetary Fund estimates. Japan’s will probably
contract 1.1 percent to 127 million in the same period, the data
show.  The growth has already attracted FamilyMart rivals
including Seven & I Holdings’ 7-Eleven franchise, which operates
in the Philippines and Indonesia and the Ministop Co. chain, 47
percent owned by Japan’s largest general retailer Aeon Co.,
which has stores in the Philippines.  Lawson, 7 Eleven  FamilyMart has gained 2.1 percent in  Tokyo  trading in the
past 12 months, lagging behind Lawson’s 14 percent advance and
compared with a 1.9 percent decline at Seven & I, which also
operates the Ito-Yokado supermarket chain. Japan’s benchmark
Nikkei 225 Stock Average dropped 19 percent in the period.  Lawson Chief Executive Officer Takeshi Niinami aims to open
almost 10,000 stores in China by 2020, a 30-fold increase from
2010, while Aeon President Motoya Okada said last year he
expects half of the company’s profit to come from China by 2020.  In Japan, Familymart estimates it controls 17 percent of
Japan’s 8.3 trillion yen convenience store market. The retailer
has said it plans to increase the proportion of customers
between 50 and 65 years old to 22 percent from the 18 percent
2010 target, matching the level in the overall population,
according to the 2010 annual report.  The company  aims  to have about 70 percent of its stores
overseas by 2020 by almost tripling outlets outside  Japan  to
29,000, compared with 11,000 in its home market.  “The average age of people in the Philippines is 22 or 23
and 27 in Indonesia, compared with 45 in Japan,” Kosaka said.
“There is no reason not to enter those markets.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
