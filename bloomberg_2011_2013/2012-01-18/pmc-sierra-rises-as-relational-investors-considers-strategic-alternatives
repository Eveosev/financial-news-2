PMC-Sierra Inc. (PMCS)  rose the most in
more than 2 1/2 years after Ralph Whitworth’s Relational
Investors LLC increased its stake and said it may push for
“strategic alternatives” aimed at lifting the stock price.  Shares of  Santa Clara , California-based PMC-Sierra, which
makes chips for computer networking and data-storage equipment,
gained 10 percent to $6.41 at the close, the biggest increase
since April 24, 2009.  The stock  fell 36 percent last year.  While PMC-Sierra has attracted new customers with chip
designs, it’s been slow to convert the business into sales,
Relational Investors said in a  regulatory filing . The firm said
PMC-Sierra’s board may need to consider “broader strategic
alternatives.” Those options include reducing PMC-Sierra’s
business lines or combining with other companies.  Relational Investors, based in  San Diego , boosted its
 ownership  to 16,495,777 shares, or 7.2 percent of outstanding
stock. The move makes Relational Investors the third-biggest
holder of PMC-Sierra stock, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  PMC-Sierra’s 2011 sales rose 4 percent to $659.2 million,
according to analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That
pace would be down from 28 percent the previous year. The
company is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results on Feb. 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
