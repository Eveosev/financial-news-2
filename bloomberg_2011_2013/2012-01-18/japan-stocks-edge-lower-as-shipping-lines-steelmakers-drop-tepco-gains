Japanese  stocks  rose, with the
Nikkei 225 Stock Average closing at its highest level in two
weeks, as brokerages and oil companies advanced amid signs the
global economy is recovering in the face of Europe’s debt crisis.  Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604)  paced gains among brokerages, which
rose the most among the 33 industry groups on the  Topix (TPX)  Index.
 Inpex Corp. (1605) , Japan’s top oil explorer, added 1.8 percent after
crude prices gained.  Fanuc Corp. (6954)  a maker of factory equipment,
climbed 4.2 percent after orders for Japanese machine tools
increased. Tokyo Electric Power Co. jumped after raising rates.  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  advanced 1 percent to 8,550.58
at the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo, the highest since Jan. 4. The
gauge traded within a narrow range during the morning session
and surged as much as 1.5 percent in the afternoon, boosted by a
large buy order for Nikkei futures, according to Toshiki Morimoto, head of  program trading  at Tokyo-based Okasan
Securities Co. The broader Topix finished the day up 0.5 percent.  “Concern about a slowdown in the global economy is
receding,” said Hiroichi Nishi, an equities manager in Tokyo at
SMBC Nikko Securities Inc.  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  advanced the most among the main Asia-
Pacific indexes today. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was little
changed, while Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 advanced 0.1 percent, and
South Korea’s Kospi Index slipped less than 0.1 percent.  Japanese shares rose today even after Fitch Ratings
Managing Director  Edward Parker  said Greece is insolvent and
probably won’t be able to honor a bond payment in March.  ‘Domino Effect’?  “The market has already priced-in a Greek default,” said
Hisakazu Amano, who helps oversee the equivalent of $29 billion
at Tokyo-based T&D Asset Management Co. “The concern is that
there will be a domino effect across the whole region.”  Stocks were buoyed by a report yesterday that signaled U.S.
manufacturing is expanding, while confidence among German
investors rose more than analysts estimated.  Brokerages, an industry group that dropped by half last
year, led gains today. Nomura,  Japan ’s biggest securities firm,
advanced 2.4 percent to 256 yen. SBI Holdings Inc., which
operates an online brokerage and an alternative trading platform,
climbed 6 percent to 5,620 yen after the securities regulator
said it may consider rule changes to make it easier for new
markets to compete with Japan’s traditional exchanges.  Inpex, Fanuc  Energy companies advanced after crude oil for February
delivery rose for a second day in  New York  to as high as $101.43
a barrel. Prices climbed after Iran advised  Saudi Arabia  against
replacing Iranian supplies if sanctions are enacted. Inpex
climbed 1.8 percent to 517,000 yen, while Japan Petroleum
Exploration Co. added 3.3 percent to 3,260 yen.  Makers of factory equipment gained after Japan Machine Tool
Builders’ Association said orders for  machine tools  rose 17.4
percent in December. Credit Suisse AG said the number was
“unexpectedly firm.”  Fanuc, Japan’s biggest maker of computers used to run
machine automated tools, advanced 4.2 percent. Okuma Corp.,
which manufactures lathes and grinders,  climbed 5.9 percent to
518 yen.  The  Topix (TPX)  has risen about 0.9 percent this year, compared
with a 2.9 percent gain by the  S&P 500  and a 3.6 percent
increase by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in Japan’s
broadest index are valued at 15.2 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 12.4 times for the S&P 500 and 10.2 times
for the Stoxx 600.  Tokyo Electric led gains on the Nikkei 225 after saying it
will raise power rates for companies by an average of 17 percent.
The utility said the higher rates will be used to cover costs
after the Fukushima nuclear disaster forced it to rely on more
expensive thermal power. Shares gained 7.8 percent to 221 yen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
