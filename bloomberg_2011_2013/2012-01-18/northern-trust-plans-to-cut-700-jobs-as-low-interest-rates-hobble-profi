Northern Trust Corp. (NTRS) , the third-
largest independent U.S. custody bank, will eliminate about 700
jobs to join its biggest rivals Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
and  State Street Corp. (STT)  in cutting costs as record-low  interest
rates  hobble profit.  The move brings cutbacks made or planned by custody banks
over the past 13 months to 4,450. BNY Mellon, the largest
custody bank, said last year it would eliminate 1,500 positions,
and State Street has planned 2,250 job cuts since November 2010.  The  Federal Reserve ’s decision to keep its main lending
rate close to zero has eroded margins on lending and investments
for custody banks and forced them to waive fees on money-market
funds. Volatility in global equity markets, which fell 9.4
percent in 2011 as measured by the MSCI ACWI Index, also hurt
profit.  “The banks had been in a growth mode for a while and now
all of them have recognized the fact that the environment isn’t
going to change quickly and they can’t continue to sit on the
cost burdens related to that growth,”  Marty Mosby , a Memphis,
Tennessee-based analyst with Guggenheim Securities LLC, said in
a telephone interview.  State Street fell 6.6 percent to close at $39.95 in New
York trading, the most since Aug. 10. Shares of  BNY Mellon (BK) 
dropped 4.6 percent to $20.30 and Northern Trust declined 1.7
percent to $41.22.  Restructuring Costs  Net income at Northern Trust and BNY Mellon tumbled in the
fourth quarter as both companies booked restructuring costs
associated with expense-cutting measures.  At State Street, Chief Executive Officer Jay Hooley said
today on a conference call with analysts that the company will
continue to cut expenses if weak  capital markets  persist this
year.  “We’re prepared to take expense action in order to make
sure that we calibrate to the environment from the standpoint of
generating earnings,” Hooley said. “Expect more of the same
for 2012.”  At Northern Trust, net income in the three months ended
Dec. 31 decreased 17 percent to $130.2 million, or 53 cents a
share, from $157.1 million, or 64 cents, a year earlier. Net
income at  BNY Mellon  fell 26 percent to $505 million, or 42
cents a share, from $679 million or 54 cents, a year earlier,
the New York-based firm said today in a statement.  Custody Business  New custody business and expense cuts helped State Street
increase fourth-quarter profit on an operating basis by 4.4
percent to $454 million, or 93 cents a share, from $435 million,
or 87 cents a share, a year earlier.  Northern Trust booked a $39.8 million after-tax charge, or
17 cents a share, in the fourth quarter to account for the cost
reductions, which are designed to lift pretax income by $250
million by the end of next year, the Chicago-based bank said
today in a statement. The restructuring charge includes
severance expenses, consulting costs, reductions in office space
and software write-offs, the firm said.  Revenue at Northern Trust rose 7 percent to $955.6 million,
driven mainly by an increase in trust, investment and servicing
fees. Assets under custody rose to $3.88 trillion from $3.71
trillion a year earlier, helped by Northern Trust’s takeover of
 Bank of Ireland  Plc’s securities-servicing unit in June for 60
million euros ($77.1 million), and the $100 million acquisition
of Chicago-based hedge-fund asset servicer Omnium LLC from
Citadel LLC in July.  Drop in Fees  BNY Mellon, led by Gerald Hassell since his predecessor,
Robert P. Kelly, stepped down at the end of August, booked a
charge of $107 million, or 6 cents a share, for operational
improvements designed to save as much as $700 million before
taxes by 2015.  Analysts had expected the company to report a profit of 52
cents a share, according to the average of nine estimates in a
Bloomberg survey.  BNY Mellon’s revenue fell 6 percent to $3.5 billion as both
of the bank’s main businesses, asset servicing and asset
management, reported a drop in fees. The bank cited higher
money-market fee waivers, weak international equity markets and
a seasonal dip in its depositary receipts business for the
decline.  State Street’s revenue rose 13 percent from the fourth
quarter of 2010 while expenses declined 0.4 percent.
Compensation and employee benefits fell 6.7 percent, a result of
the company’s decision to eliminate jobs over the past 13
months.  State Street saved about $80 million last year through the
job cuts and investments in technology, and will reduce costs by
an estimated $170 million this year, Robert Lee, an analyst with
Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc. in  New York , wrote in a research
note published Jan. 9. The company aims for at least $575
million in annual savings by 2015.  To contact the reporters on this story:
