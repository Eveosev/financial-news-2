Tullow Oil Plc (TLW) , the London-based
explorer with the most licenses in Africa, dropped after
delaying full production from its Jubilee oil field in  Ghana .  Tullow fell 4.2 percent to close at 1,394 pence in London.
The stock fell 3.2 percent to close at 30 cedis in Accra, the
lowest since Aug. 3, when the shares started trading on the
Ghana Stock Exchange.  Tullow and partners  Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC)  and  Kosmos
Energy Ltd. (KOS)  will need to invest about $400 million to fix
mechanical issues related to well designs, according to a Tullow
statement today. Jubilee will reach plateau output of 120,000
barrels of oil a day in 2013, at least a year later than
planned, Chief Operating Officer Paul McDade said.  “We see 2012 pretty much as a year when we will take our
time and resolve the issues,” McDade said today in a phone
interview. “We will get this production in 2013 and beyond and
there is no impact on reserves and resources.”  Kosmos Energy fell 3.5 percent to close at $13.42 in  New
York . Anadarko rose 1.3 percent to $80.24.  The Jubilee partners have already invested $3.4 billion to
develop Ghana’s largest deposit, which had been due to reach
plateau production in August. Gross output from the field
reached 88,000 barrels of oil a day last year, dropping to
70,000 barrels at year-end, according to the statement.  Total Decline  Tullow’s total output averaged 78,200 barrels of oil
equivalent a day in 2011, below the 79,000 to 81,000 barrels it
forecast in November. Daily output from Jubilee will range from
70,000 barrels to 90,000 barrels this year, Tullow said.  “The key drag on production appears to be the Jubilee
field where well-decline rates have been much higher than
expected due to a well completion design issue,” Sanjeev Bahl,
a London-based analyst at Numis Securities Ltd., wrote today in
an e-mailed report.  Separately, Tullow announced today a partnership with  Royal
Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  to explore for oil and gas in the Atlantic
basin. Tullow is already cooperating with Anadarko in
exploration off the coast of West Africa and plans to develop
Lake Albert oil fields with  Total SA (FP)  and  Cnooc Ltd. (883)  in  Uganda .  In March, Tullow agreed to sell one-third stakes in its
Ugandan oil discoveries to Total and Cnooc for $2.9 billion and
has been waiting for government approval.  The partners and the Ugandan government are “all working
hard to get things finalized before the end of January,” Tullow
Chief Financial Officer Ian Springett told analysts on a
conference call today. Uganda expects to approve the sale
“shortly,” Energy Minister Irene Muloni said Jan 12.  Tullow plans to increase investment in projects by 43
percent to about $2 billion this year from last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
