A strike by Cyprus’s air-traffic
controllers today will affect 38 flights, a spokesman for the
airports said.  The four-hour strike “will affect 20 departures, 18
arrivals and more than 5,000 passengers,” said Adamos Aspris,
spokesman for the Larnaca and Paphos airports, which are
operated by Hermes Airports. It isn’t yet known if any flights
will be canceled because of the strike, which was set to start
at 1 p.m. local time, Aspris said in a telephone interview.  Controllers have asked to be exempted from a blanket wage
freeze in the public sector for two years and cuts in overtime
pay. Fiscal-consolidation measures passed by the parliament in
2011 “translate cumulatively to a 40 percent pay cut,” Giorgos
Georgiou, president the air traffic controllers union, said in a
telephone interview today.  The strike, which follows a 12-hour stoppage Dec. 15, may
affect efforts to attract more airliners with special
incentives, Aspris said. The incentives, agreed to by Hermes and
the government on Dec. 28, are intended to boost tourism that
accounts for about a quarter of the Cypriot economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
