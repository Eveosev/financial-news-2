India  continues to buy oil from Iran
amid increasing international pressure on Asian buyers to cut
supplies from the world’s fourth-biggest producer, according to
Oil Minister S. Jaipal Reddy.  “But we have to be prepared for all eventualities,” Reddy
said in New Delhi today. India opposes sanctions on the Persian
Gulf nation from anyone other than the  United Nations , Ranjan Mathai, India’s foreign secretary, told reporters in New Delhi
yesterday.  Indian buyers are struggling to find lenders willing to
handle payments to their second-biggest crude supplier because
of international sanctions aimed at Iran’s nuclear program.
Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh discussed alternative
financial conduits with Russian officials during his visit to
Moscow in December.  U.S. President  Barack Obama  on Dec. 31 signed into law
measures that deny access to the U.S. financial system to any
foreign bank that conducts business with the central bank of
Iran. European Union foreign ministers are scheduled to meet
Jan. 23 to decide on proposed sanctions on Iran’s oil imports.  Turkiye Halk Bankasi AS (HALKB)  told  Indian oil  refiners it may no
longer be able to be an intermediary for their purchases of
 Iranian crude , four people with knowledge of the matter said
Jan. 10. Indian officials are scheduled to visit Tehran for
trade talks starting Jan. 16, two of the people said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
