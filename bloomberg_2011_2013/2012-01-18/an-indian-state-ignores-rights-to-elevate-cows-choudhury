In the great Indian novelist Yashpal's magnum opus about Partition,  Jhootha Sach  ("The False Truth"), one character swears that he is telling the truth -- and if not, "may the curse of spilling a cow's blood fall on me." This line may be taken as emblematic of one of the most special man-animal relationships in the world, that of Indian Hindus with the cow. Not only is the cow central to the Indian agricultural system -- supplying milk for family nutrition and for sale, and dung for manure and fuel -- it also has many sacred associations in Hindu mythology and everyday life. On street corners one can find a cow tethered by its owner to a tree or post, being fed grass paid for by passers-by, who consider the gift a small act of kindness and empathy for the day. Even the languages of India are rich with cow proverbs and metaphors. Cows, whether as living animals or symbols, are always within the field of vision. It is but natural then that the slaughter of cows for meat is a controversial subject in India, where such an act would horrify Hindus (the Bloomberg View columnist  Pankaj Mishra   quotes  the historian DD Kosambi as saying "a modern orthodox Hindu would place beef-eating on the same level as cannibalism") but seem perfectly normal to Muslims and Christians. Indian social history, especially in the modern period, is littered with accounts of clashes and disputes on  this subject . When the Constitution was framed in the years after independence in 1947, its makers offered some concession to Hindu sensitivities in offering a set of "directive principles of state policy" -- goals, rather than laws --  that included  "prohibiting the slaughter, of cows and calves" and other milk and draft cattle. Since then, despite many agitations by Hindu organizations, the government of  India  has resisted passing a nationwide law regulating cow slaughter, and instead allowed each state of the federation to pass its own law on the subject. A  recent survey  of laws about cow-slaughter in Indian states by the Indian Express revealed a great diversity of approaches, with each state having its own interpretation of "cow" (some take it for exactly what it means, while others extend it to mean all cattle, including the ubiquitous water buffalo), its own definition of "slaughter" (some allow old or diseased cows to be killed), and a range of punishments from simple fines to imprisonment. In states where beef is widely eaten, such as the northeast of the country and the southern state of Kerala, there is no law on cow slaughter. Indeed, beef is widely available around the country, but usually it is buffalo meat, referred to colloquially as "buff." Some commentators, such as Pratap Bhanu Mehta in his 2003 essay " Cows, Citizens and the State ," have argued that it is wrong to legislate on what might be seen as a matter of individual liberty: But even Mehta concedes that laws against cow slaughter are inevitable given the pressure of public opinion. He settles for a situation where it isn't the central government that forms such laws but the states. One might say that such solutions, worked out from state to state, represent an equilibrium-point between divergent social practices. But this balance was thrown completely out of kilter in the large central state of Madhya Pradesh last month when the government, run by the Hindu nationalist  Bharatiya Janata Party , received permission to  radically amend  an existing law from 2004 prohibiting cow slaughter. The  revised law  raises the term of imprisonment for cow slaughter to seven years, and makes even the transport of cows for slaughter in other states and the storing of beef punishable offenses. Clearly no legislator with any experience in law-making, much less an entire government, should be complicit in the lack of respect for due process and disregard for human liberty and dignity implicit in a set of clauses  that announce : In those airy, all-pervading words "has been, is being, or is likely to be committed" is a world of mischief -- but more on the part of the lawmaker than the notional lawbreaker. No democratic government can arrogate to itself powers that are warranted only in states of emergency, not for the ferreting out of contraband meat. The very nonchalance with which the government of Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan passed these sinister amendments, and the gloating phrase at the beginning declaring the act to be "in the interest of the general public and to maintain communal harmony and peace," is a clear indication that the government wishes not only to protect cows but to spite some of its own citizens -- the "others" within the fold -- in the bargain. As Javed Anand wrote in the Indian Express in a piece called " Using the Cow ": And an  editorial  in the Deccan Herald said: Traditionally a symbol of innocence, piety and peace, the gentle cow has been turned in  Madhya Pradesh  into an instrument of intimidation. In the language of those few arrogant clauses of the revised act prohibiting cow slaughter is a revealing glimpse of all the labor that has been, is being, or is likely to be required to make all adult Indians, and especially elected representatives of the people, arrive at a common minimum understanding of each other's needs, rights and liberties.
