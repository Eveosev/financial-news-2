The International Monetary Fund said
it aims to raise as much as $500 billion to be made available
for lending, including about $200 billion already pledged by
European nations.  “Based on staff’s estimate of global potential financing
needs of about $1 trillion in the coming years, the Fund would
aim to raise up to $500 billion in additional lending
resources,” the IMF said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
