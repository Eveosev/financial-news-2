China  “completely rejects” Iran
developing  nuclear weapons  and supports the so-called five-plus-
one talks to find a solution to the issue, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said at a press conference in Doha, Qatar.  The nation is implementing United Nations resolutions on
Iran, and opposes any “extreme” actions in the Strait of
Hormuz that would damage world interests, Wen said yesterday.
Still, China’s oil trade with Iran is “normal” and doesn’t
worry him, Wen said.  China, which counts Iran as one of its top petroleum
suppliers, last week snubbed U.S. efforts to tighten
restrictions on Iran, with a vice foreign minister saying his
nation “opposes imposing pressure and sanctions.”  Iranian Vice President Mohammad Reza Rahimi said Dec. 27
that his nation would block oil shipments through the  Strait of
Hormuz  if sanctions are imposed, the  Islamic Republic News
Agency  said. The Strait is a transit point for one-fifth of oil
traded worldwide.  The five-plus-one talks refers to negotiations between the
five permanent members of the UN -- the U.S., U.K., France,
Russia and China -- and Germany with Iran.  On Syria, Wen said yesterday that the killing of civilians
must stop and Syria needs to listen to the wishes of its people
and reform. China supports the empowerment of the Arab league to
mediate and find a peaceful solution to situation, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
