Tam SA (TAMM4)  of Brazil and  Lan Airlines SA (LAN) 
of Chile sought approval to swap shares and delist Tam’s, after
gaining antitrust clearance last month for a $3.2 billion
transaction creating the world’s second-largest carrier.  The companies took the first step toward delisting the
Brazilian airline from  Sao Paulo ’s stock exchange by seeking
authorization to swap shares from Brazil’s securities regulator,
known as CVM, according to a statement today. A Tam press
officer, who asked not to be named because of company policy,
declined to comment.  The plan by Santiago-based Lan to acquire Tam was cleared
in December by the Brazilian antitrust regulator, known as Cade.
The Chilean airline would swap each Tam share for 0.9 of its own
in the form of Brazilian depositary receipts, according to a
regulatory filing in August 2010.  A Lan-Tam combination would have a market value of $11.7
billion, overtaking Singapore Airlines Ltd. as the world’s
second-largest airline by market value, after Beijing-based Air
China Ltd., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. With Sao
Paulo-based Tam, Lan would be granted access to about half of
routes in  Brazil , Latin America’s largest economy, and a network
of more than 115 destinations in 23 countries.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
