Germany ’s Kiel Canal, the world’s
busiest artificial waterway, closed to shipping after two
vessels hauling fertilizers collided, leaving one listing at a
45-degree angle.  The Siderfly, a 100-meter (328-foot) ship flying the flag
of  St. Vincent  & the Grenadines, and the Netherlands-registered,
116-meter Coral Ivory collided at about 3 a.m. local time today,
the Central Command for Maritime Emergencies, part of Germany’s
coast guard, said in a statement. Marine diesel oil leaked from
the Siderfly, which is being stabilized by two tugboats after
listing, it said.  Nobody was injured in the collision, according to the
statement. The spill’s size is unknown for now and it’s too soon
to say how long the halt will last, Central Command spokeswoman
Ulrike Windhoevel in Cuxhaven, Germany, said by phone.  The canal enables ships to move between the Baltic and
North seas without having to voyage around the Jutland
Peninsula. Almost 35,000 vessels navigated the 100-kilometer
(62-mile) link last year, according to its website. The canal is
the busiest global artificial waterway, the website says.  To contact the reporters on this story:
