Electricite de France SA , the
world’s biggest operator of nuclear reactors, and  Veolia
Environnement SA (VIE)  said they are near an agreement to split their
Dalkia energy-services company.  EDF is in advanced talks to take control of Dalkia’s French
activities and Veolia would acquire the international
operations, the Paris-based companies said in a joint statement
yesterday. Veolia would pay 550 million euros ($758 million) to
EDF to make up the difference in value between the two stakes,
according to the statement.  The transaction will allow EDF, which owns 34 percent of
Dalkia, a bigger anchor in its home market for energy services.
Veolia will gain momentum in its plan to expand in growth
markets. Dalkia gets almost half its sales in  France . The
company, which has 49,800 employees in 35 countries, managed
revenue last year of 8.9 billion euros, according to its
website.  The completed transaction would end the litigation between
EDF and Veolia pending before the Paris Commercial Court,
according to the companies. EDF and Veolia’s boards of directors
have met and approved the continuation of the talks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
