A two-megawatt floating offshore
wind turbine in southwestern Japan began generating power, a
group led by  Toda Corp. (1860)  said today.  The turbine was set up near Nagasaki prefecture in a pilot
project for the Ministry of the Environment, the group said
today in a statement. The group installed a 100-kilowatt
floating turbine last year to experiment with a smaller one.  The project comes as Japan is exploring ways to
commercialize floating offshore technology. A group led by
 Marubeni Corp. (8002)  said earlier this month in a statement that it
has installed a floating turbine off the coast of Fukushima and
plans to start operations in November.  Hitachi Ltd., Fuyo Ocean Development & Engineering Co.,
 Kyoto University  and the National Maritime Research Institute
also take part in the Nagasaki project.  To contact the reporter on this story:
