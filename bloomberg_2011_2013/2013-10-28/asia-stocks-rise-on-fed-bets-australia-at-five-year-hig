Asian  stocks  rose, with the regional
equities gauge rebounding from last week’s decline, after
weaker-than-forecast U.S. consumer confidence spurred bets the
Federal Reserve will maintain stimulus.  CSL Ltd. (CSL) , a maker of blood-derived therapies that gets more
than a third of its sales in the U.S., advanced 3 percent in
Sydney. Toyota Motor Corp. gained 1.8 percent in  Tokyo  as the
yen weakened against the dollar, boosting the earnings outlook
for  Asia ’s largest carmaker. Kingsgate Consolidated Ltd. fell 5
percent in Sydney as the gold miner reported an 18 percent drop
in quarterly output.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 1.1 percent to 142.81 as
of 5:03 p.m. in Tokyo, with all 10 industry groups on the gauge
rising. Investors are awaiting industrial production data today
from the world’s largest economy, the next barometer for clues
as to whether the  Federal Reserve  will delay scaling back U.S.
monetary stimulus.  “We are in a liquidity-fueled stock boom,” Matthew Sherwood, head of investment markets research in Sydney at
Perpetual Investments, which manages about $25 billion, said in
an e-mail. “Rising valuations have never stopped overheating
markets, so the market rise could be extended, as long as
central-bank stimulus remains in place.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 1.5 percent last week,
curbing its October gain to 2 percent, with the measure on
course for a second monthly increase. That pushed its  price-earnings  multiple to 13.6 times estimated profit on Oct. 25 from
12.7 at the end of August, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That compares with 15.9 for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index and 14.8 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Regional Gauges  Japan ’s Topix index advanced 1.7 percent. Australia’s
 S&P/ASX 200 Index (AS51)  rose 1 percent, to the highest level since
June 2008, as CSL gained 3 percent to A$68.49.  South Korea ’s
Kospi index added 0.7 percent after a Bank of Korea survey
showed consumer sentiment rose this month to the highest level
since May 2012.  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index increased 0.5 percent and
 China ’s Shanghai Composite was little changed. Taiwan’s Taiex
Index advanced 0.7 percent and  Singapore ’s Straits Times Index
gained 0.2 percent.  Of the 108 companies in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index that
have provided quarterly results this  earnings season  and for
which Bloomberg compiles estimates, 57 posted profit that missed
expectations, the data show. Apple Inc. is due to report results
in the U.S. today.  Bank Profit  China Construction Bank Corp. advanced 1.1 percent to
HK$5.77 in Hong Kong after reporting growth in loan and fee
income that helped boost third-quarter profit at the nation’s
second-largest lender by 9.4 percent, matching analysts’
estimates.  Ping An Insurance (Group) Co. gained 1.7 percent to HK$58.
China’s second-largest insurer said profit more than doubled in
the third quarter as a stock-market rally boosted investment
returns and revenue from its banking unit expanded.  Japan’s Topix has climbed 39 percent this year, the largest
rally among 24 developed equity markets tracked by Bloomberg,
amid optimism Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s policies and
unprecedented monetary easing from the  Bank of Japan  will lead
the country out of deflation.  Chinese brokerages are betting the biggest jump in money-market rates since June’s record cash crunch is a sign of
strength in the nation’s economy rather than finance-industry
weakness. The central bank has refrained from injecting funds
into the banking system since Oct. 17, driving the benchmark
seven-day repurchase rate 138 basis points higher to 4.88
percent last week, the most in four months. It climbed 5 basis
points to 4.93 percent today.  U.S. Futures  S&P 500 futures rose 0.3 percent. U.S. stocks completed a
third straight week of gains on Oct. 25, sending the benchmark
gauge to a record, as earnings beat estimates and weak economic
data fueled speculation the Fed will delay reducing stimulus.
 Consumer confidence  in the U.S. dropped to a 10-month low, a
private report showed Oct. 25.  A two-day meeting at the  Federal Open Market Committee  will
start tomorrow after U.S payrolls rose less than projected last
month and the 16-day government shutdown took at least $24
billion out of the economy.  The Fed is likely to delay lowering its $85 billion in
monthly bond purchases until March, according to a Bloomberg
News survey of economists conducted Oct. 17-18.  Japanese exporters advanced as the yen fell 0.2 percent to
97.63 per dollar. Toyota added 1.8 percent to 6,310 yen.
Panasonic Corp., a Japanese home-appliance manufacturer that
gets almost half of its revenue abroad, rose 2.6 percent to 946
yen.  Australia  & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. gained 1.8
percent to a record A$33.24 in Sydney as investors await its
earnings release tomorrow. National Australia Bank Ltd. climbed
1.7 percent to A$36.68, a 5 1/2 year high.  Kingsgate sank 5 percent to A$1.53 after the company said
output for the September quarter dropped 18 percent to 50,786
ounces.  To contact the reporter on this story:
