The smart water-management market
that includes meters, network monitoring and water-efficiency
software is expected to more than double in five years to $12
billion from $5.4 billion, according to a study.  North America will be the leading revenue market for the
2013-2018 period as aging water and sewage infrastructure,
utilities suffering leak losses, irrigation projects and water
conservation measures get modernized, the Dallas-based
MarketsandMarkets research company said today in the report.  Companies that may benefit from what the report estimates
will be a compound annual growth of 17 percent for metering,
analytics and cloud-based solutions include  Oracle Corp. (ORCL) ,
 Siemens AG (SIE) , Schneider Electric SA, General Electric Co.,  ABB
Ltd. (ABBN) , IBM, Arad Group, Itron Inc. and TaKaDu Ltd., it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
