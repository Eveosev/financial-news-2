Most Chinese stocks fell as
disappointing earnings at liquor and health-care companies
overshadowed gains for energy shares. The benchmark index was
little changed after price swings approached a two-month high.  Wuliangye Yibin Co. (000858) , the nation’s second-largest liquor
maker, and Yunnan Baiyao Group Co., a producer of Chinese
medicine, both slid at least 6.8 percent after reporting third-quarter results.  China Oilfield Services Ltd. (601808)  jumped 7.4 percent
after the company said nine-month earnings rose 40 percent.  The Shanghai Composite Index added 0.9 point to 2,133.87 at
the close, with 473 stocks falling and 446 gaining, after
changing directions at least 16 times. Earnings at the 388
companies in the gauge tracked by Bloomberg that reported
results so far this quarter have trailed analyst estimates by
1.2 percent. Chinese Politburo member Yu Zhengsheng said reforms
to be discussed at a Communist Party meeting next month will be
“unprecedented,” according to an Oct. 26 report by Xinhua News
Agency that didn’t mention specific policies.  “The market is likely to remain weak,” said Mao Sheng, an
analyst for Huaxi Securities Co. in Chengdu. “We have a lot of
expectations for more reforms in November but investors will
need concrete announcements to boost the market forward.”  The CSI 300 Index lost 0.1 percent to 2,365.95. The  Hang
Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of mainland companies traded in
 Hong Kong  climbed 0.9 percent. The Bloomberg China-US Equity
Index, the measure of the most-traded U.S.-listed Chinese
companies, fell 1.2 percent in  New York  on Oct. 25.  Volatility Increases  The Shanghai index has fallen 6 percent this year on
concerns a slowing economy will hurt profit growth and the
government will introduce measures to curb gains in property
prices. Trading volumes were 41 percent below the 30-day average
today, while 30-day volatility was at 19.6, after hitting a two-month high on Oct. 25, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

since Dec. 3. Net income fell about 52 percent from a year
earlier as sales tumbled 40 percent, the company said. Yunnan
Baiyao sank 7.7 percent to the lowest level since Aug. 15.  China  Oilfield climbed for a second day, extending this
year’s gain to 34 percent. China Life Insurance Co. and Ping An
Insurance (Group) Co, the nation’s largest insurers, both
advanced 1 percent as stock-market gains lifted third-quarter
profits.  Reform Pledges  Zoomlion Heavy Industry Science & Technology Co. (000157)  jumped 6.2
percent to 5.79  yuan  after a Chinese daily newspaper apologized
for publishing unverified stories questioning the finances of
the construction-machinery manufacturer.  Xinkuaibao apologized for failing to verify stories by its
reporter Chen Yongzhou, following a report aired by state-run
 China Central Television  on Oct. 27 that showed footage of Chen
being interrogated by police in Changsha.  China’s leaders have pledged to cut the state’s role in the
economy, change the financial and fiscal systems, and overhaul
land and household registration rules to sustain growth.
Analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News  this month said policies
flowing from the meeting, called the third plenum, will reduce
the odds of a severe slowdown and help China become a high-income country by 2030.  The iShares China Large-Cap ETF, the largest Chinese
exchange-traded  fund  in the U.S., slipped 0.1 percent to $36.43
in New York on Oct. 25, for a weekly decline of 4.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
