Joseph Sitt, whose Thor Equities LLC
unsuccessfully tried to buy the Empire State Building to avert
its inclusion in an initial public offering, said he now owns
shares of the new company,  Empire State Realty Trust Inc. (ESRT)   “I bought it for a cheaper price than they would have sold
it to me for,” Sitt, the chief executive officer of New York-based Thor, said of the stock in an interview today on Bloomberg
Television’s “In the Loop with  Betty Liu .” He wouldn’t say how
many shares he owns.  Last month, Thor offered to buy the title to the Empire
State Building for $1.4 billion. The offer, supported by
dissident investors who opposed the inclusion of the Manhattan
skyscraper in a public company, was “materially greater” than
the $1.18 billion value of the building allocated to the company
in public filings, Stephen Meister, a lawyer representing those
investors, said at the time.  Malkin Holdings LLC, the Empire State Building’s
supervisor, rejected the bid and proceeded with a plan to form a
real estate investment trust including the landmark tower.
Empire State Realty began trading on Oct. 2 and has climbed 12
percent from its IPO price.  “I’m sure they will do well,” Sitt, speaking of the
REIT’s  shares , said in the interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
