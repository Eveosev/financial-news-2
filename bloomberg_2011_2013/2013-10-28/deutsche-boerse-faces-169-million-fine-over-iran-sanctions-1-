Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1)  said the fine its
Clearstream unit faces from U.S. government allegations that it
violated sanctions against  Iran  may be half the previously
disclosed amount.  The penalty totals $169 million, or only $152 million if
the Frankfurt-based company settles with the U.S. Treasury
Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, Deutsche Boerse
said in a statement yesterday. In January, Deutsche Boerse said
it might have to pay $340 million.  The Treasury investigation, which Deutsche Boerse said has
concluded, centered on securities transfers within the
Clearstream system in 2008, following the company’s decision in
2007 to close Iranian customers’ accounts. The company started
talks on a deal with the U.S. Treasury in 2008, the Frankfurt-based exchange said earlier this year.  Treasury spokesman John Sullivan declined to comment.  Standard Chartered Plc agreed to pay $327 million in fines
in December, including $132 million to OFAC, after regulators
said it violated U.S. sanctions with Iran. The British bank was
accused of helping Iran launder about $250 billion in violation
of federal laws, keeping false records and handling wire
transfers for Iranian clients.  “A settlement with OFAC would not constitute a final
determination that a violation has occurred,” Deutsche Boerse
said in yesterday’s statement. The exchange operator will now
decide whether to settle with U.S. regulators, it said. The fine
will be included as a provision in the company’s third-quarter
filing.  Deutsche Boerse shares slid 1.83 euros, or 3.2 percent, to
55.57 euros at 9:22 a.m. in  Frankfurt  today, the biggest drop in
11 weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
