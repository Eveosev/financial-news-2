Prime Minister David Cameron will
today unveil an apprenticeship program for young people
involving companies from  Barclays Plc (BARC)  to  Diageo Plc (DGE)  as he seeks
to foster Britain’s economic recovery.  Cameron will visit  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) ’s factory
for Mini cars in  Oxfordshire ,  England , to explain the initiative
in a speech. As part of the plan, 14 large employers will offer
as many as 100,000 vocational training places within two years.  “We know that the economy is turning a corner,” Cameron
will say, according to comments released by his office. “We
have record levels of employment. But we cannot for one moment
be complacent. I’m determined we finish the job we started.”  Data last week showed the economy grew 0.8 percent in the
third quarter, the  fastest pace  since 2010. The economy has
expanded 3 percent since Cameron took office in 2010 and he’s
counting on keeping the momentum as his Conservative Party
trails behind the Labour opposition with 1 1/2 years to go
before the next election.  “With around a million young people out of work, we hope
these programs will give them the work and training they need to
be able to get a full time job,” John Allan, chairman of the
Federation of Small Businesses, a lobby group with 200,000
members, said in a separate statement. “It is important the
government uses the supply chains of the 14 companies to help
find sustained employment for the U.K.’s young people.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
