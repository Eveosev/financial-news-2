Companies are more likely to make
larger, equity- and debt-funded acquisitions over the next year
as chief executive officers become more confident of an economic
recovery, according to consulting firm EY.  About 35 percent of global executives surveyed by the
company formerly known as Ernst & Young are planning
acquisitions in the next 12 months, up from 25 percent a year
earlier, EY said in a report published today. Just 11 percent of
those surveyed anticipate economic decline in the period, the
lowest proportion in two years.  About $1.85 trillion in takeovers have been announced this
year, led by  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) ’s $130 billion sale of its stake
in  Verizon Wireless , the largest U.S. mobile operator. That’s up
from about $1.77 trillion in the same period in 2012.  “Barring any further significant economic or geo-political
shocks, we should see the resuscitation of a global M&A
market,” Pip McCrostie, EY’s global vice-chair for transaction
advisory, said in a statement. “Sentiments are being buoyed by
a much more positive view of deal fundamentals.”  Some 19 percent of executives who responded to the survey
are interested in making deals valued between $501 million and
$1 billion, more than double the percentage who said the same
six months ago, EY said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
