Treasury 10-year note yields are
close to a one-week high as the U.S. gets ready to sell $96
billion of two-, five- and seven-year securities over the next
three days and Federal Reserve policy makers prepare to meet.  A measure of implied volatility on 10-year  interest-rate
swaps  dropped to the least since May as investors waited to hear
the Fed’s stance on its $85-billion-a-month debt-buying program.
The Federal Open Market Committee’s two-day policy meeting
starts tomorrow. The central bank won’t begin to slow the pace
of bond purchases until March, according to a Bloomberg News
survey of economists.  “The highlight is going to be what we get out of the
FOMC,” said Sean Murphy, a trader in New York at Societe
Generale SA, one of 21 primary dealers that trade with the Fed.
“The market is looking for more guidance on the timing of
tapering. There’s probably not enough data that gets them to
taper this year. This 2.50 percent on the 10-year is the center
point as we continue to be more data dependent.”  Benchmark 10-year note  yields  were little changed at 2.50
percent as of 11:07 a.m. New York time, according to Bloomberg
Bond Trader prices after rising to 2.53 percent, the highest
since Oct. 22. The price of the 2.5 percent note due August 2023
rose 2/32, or 63 cents per $1,000 face value, to 99 31/32.  The U.S. plans to sell $32 billion of two-year notes today,
$35 billion of debt due in October 2018 tomorrow and $29 billion
of seven-year notes on Oct. 30.  Debt Sale  The Treasury last sold two-year notes on Sept. 24 at a
yield of 0.348 percent. Investors  bid  for 3.09 times the amount
of debt available. The average over the past 12 of the monthly
auctions is 3.43.  Swings on 10-year interest-rate swaps were at 75.22, a
level not seen since May based on closing prices. The gauge is a
measure of projected yield fluctuations over the next 90 days
and has fallen from 116.91 in September when some investors
speculated the Fed would begin trimming its bond purchases.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s MOVE Index, another measure
of volatility in Treasuries, was as low as 61.14 last week, the
least since May.  U.S. central bankers will pare the monthly pace of asset
buying to $70 billion from $85 billion at their March 18-19
meeting, according to the median of responses in a Bloomberg
News survey of economists.  Factory production in the U.S. rose less than forecast in
September, indicating a pause in manufacturing leading into the
budget battle that partially closed the federal government.  Output at factories rose 0.1 percent after a revised 0.5
percent gain in August that was smaller than initially
estimated, figures from the Fed showed. The median forecast of
economists in a Bloomberg survey called for a 0.3 percent
September gain. Total industrial production, which also includes
output by mines and utilities, advanced 0.6 percent as higher
temperatures drove up electricity use.  Yield Forecasts  Ten-year note yields in the range of 2.474 percent to 2.399
percent are “poised to bottom and turn higher over the coming
sessions,” according to  MacNeil Curry , a technical strategist
at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. A move to the mid-October high
of about 2.759 percent is likely, New York-based Curry wrote in
a report yesterday.  Treasury trading  volume  at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of U.S. government debt, averaged $260.8 billion
last week. The average this year is $315.4 billion.  The  Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Bond Index (BUSY)  has declined 1.8
percent for the year through Oct. 25. Japanese bonds gained 2.5
percent, while  Germany ’s lost 1.4 percent.  “It makes sense to be rather short, and we expect yields
to be slightly higher by the end of the year,” said  Patrick Jacq , a senior rates strategist at BNP Paribas SA in Paris.
“The economy is improving even if it is not yet materializing
with strong job increases, and also even if the Fed remains
accommodative, the prospect of tapering next year is still there
and at some stage there will be a market reaction.” A short
position is a bet an asset will decline.  To contact the reporters on this story:
