Money managers’  bullish bets  on
cocoa traded in  London  returned to a record high in the latest
week, according to data from NYSE Liffe, the derivatives arm of
NYSE Euronext.  Investors were net-long, or betting on price gains, by
65,466 futures and options as of Oct. 22, the Commitments of
Traders report on the exchange’s  website  showed today. That was
up from 65,234 contracts a week earlier and compares with the
former record of 65,317 lots as of Oct. 8. Cocoa for delivery in
March retreated 1.4 percent in the latest period.  Futures gained 19 percent in London this year amid
forecasts for supplies to trail demand in the 2013-14 season
begun this month. The shortage will be 173,000 metric tons as
consumption builds and dry weather reduces crops in West Africa,
the world’s main growing region, estimates Macquarie Group Ltd.
Prices declined in the past two weeks.  “Cocoa prices, 2013’s star performer, may be running out
of steam,”  Kona Haque , a London-based analyst at Macquarie,
said in a report e-mailed today. “Still very much driven by
speculative long positions, the market may need a continued
influx of bullish news and data points to keep the momentum
going,” she said.  North America  Cocoa entered a  bull market  last month as demand improved.
Bean processing in  Europe , accounting for 40 percent of usage,
rose 4.7 percent in the third quarter, according to the European
Cocoa Association. The so-called grind advanced 12 percent in
Asia in the period and 8.2 percent in  North America , data from
the Cocoa Association of Asia and the  National Confectioners
Association  in  Washington  showed.  Lower prices would represent “a good entry position”
because fundamentals are still “compelling,” Haque said.  Bets on lower prices for robusta coffee soared, the data
showed. Money managers were  net-short  by 7,931 futures and
options in the latest week, from 483 contracts. The beans used
to make instant coffee and espresso slid 5.5 percent in the
period in anticipation of a record harvest in  Vietnam , the
world’s largest producer of the variety.  Investors boosted bets on rising white-sugar prices by 19
percent. They were net-long by 12,058 futures and options,
against 10,132 contracts a week earlier, exchange data showed.
The sweetener rose 2.7 percent in the period.  In feed wheat, money managers were net-short by 159
contracts, down from 331 lots a week earlier. The grain advanced
0.8 percent in the period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
