London  Mayor Boris Johnson needs to
devise a strategy for dealing with overcrowding on London buses
as use is set to increase by 167 million journeys a year by
2022, a panel of city lawmakers said.  The number of journeys has increased to 2.3 billion a year
from 1.4 billion in 2000 and is predicted to continue to rise as
the U.K. capital’s population expands, the London Assembly’s
Transport Committee said in a report published today.  “Despite forecasting 167 million more bus journeys by
2022, the mayor and Transport for London have not set out how
London’s bus routes will cope with extra passengers,” the head
of the committee, Val Shawcross, said in an e-mailed statement.
“They must ensure there are adequate plans to support the
capital’s growth.”  A quarter of 1,040 passengers surveyed on the assembly’s
website between May 30 and Sept. 10 said their buses were
already overcrowded, and more than half said they’d noticed an
increase in passengers in the past year, the committee said.  Johnson should publish a long-term strategy for the bus
network, develop a way of recording how crowded buses are so
they can be measured against performance targets and improve
services to hospitals and health centers, the report said.  “Bus users deserve to continue to enjoy a world-class bus
network rather than endure overcrowding,” Shawcross said.
“Without steps to address this, London passengers might soon
face a longer wait at bus stops while they watch full buses whiz
past unable to cope with more rush-hour commuters.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
