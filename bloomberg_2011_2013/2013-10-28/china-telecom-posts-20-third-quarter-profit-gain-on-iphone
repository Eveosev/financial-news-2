China Telecom Corp., the country’s
third-biggest mobile phone company by users, posted a greater-than-expected gain in quarterly profit as users of  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s
iPhone helped boost data  sales. (728)   Net income  rose 20 percent to 4.5 billion  yuan  ($740
million) in the three months ended Sept. 30 from 3.75 billion
yuan a year earlier, the Beijing-based company said in a
 statement  on its Website today. That beat the 4.41 billion-yuan
average of three analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Chairman Wang Xiaochu is seeing the benefit from being one
of two carriers to offer the iPhone, along with China Unicom
(Hong Kong) Ltd., in the world’s largest smartphone market. Both
companies beat earnings estimates for the period thanks to heavy
data usage, while  China Mobile Ltd. (941) , which has yet to reach an
agreement with Apple about offering the device, missed
estimates.  Sales in the third quarter rose 12 percent to 80.7 billion
yuan from 71.96 billion yuan. That compares with the average of
81 billion yuan in the Bloomberg survey.  China Telecom rose 0.3 percent to HK$4.05 at the close of
trade in  Hong Kong . The  stock  has dropped 6 percent this year,
compared with a 0.7 percent gain in the city’s benchmark  Hang
Seng Index .  New Subscribers  In the third quarter, China Telecom’s mobile unit added
9.15 million 3G users, bringing it to 96.5 million, the company
said today. Its total wireless subscriber base was 181.1 million
users at the end of the third quarter.  The company ranks behind China Mobile and China Unicom in
wireless users in the Asian nation. China Mobile has 755 million
wireless subscribers, while China Unicom has 273 million, the
carriers said this month.  China Telecom entered the wireless market in 2008 by
acquiring the smaller of China Unicom’s two mobile divisions in
a government-led revamp of the nation’s mobile-phone industry.  China Mobile on Oct. 21 posted an 8.8 percent drop in
 profit  to 28.4 billion yuan in the quarter. China Unicom on Oct.
25 posted  net income  that gained 51 percent to 3.06 billion
yuan.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
