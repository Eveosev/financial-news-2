Netflix Inc. (NFLX) , the biggest
subscription video-streaming service, reached an agreement with
 CBS Corp. (CBS)  to offer all eight seasons of “Dexter,” a popular
Showtime drama about a serial killer.  The first four seasons of the program from CBS’s premium
pay-TV network will become available to Netflix’s U.S. customers
on Oct. 31, the companies said today in a statement. Seasons
five through eight will start on Jan. 1.  The deal gives Netflix a high-profile cable show and
provides CBS with new revenue for a series that’s no longer in
production. It also gives CBS, owner of the most-watched U.S.
broadcast network, another online deal after  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) ’s
streaming service won rights to its shows, “Under the Dome”
and “The Good Wife.”  Episodes of “Dexter” will also be available on Showtime’s
website and mobile application, Showtime Anytime,  Dana McClintock , a CBS spokesman, said in an e-mail.  In “Dexter,” Michael C. Hall plays Dexter Morgan, a Miami
forensics expert who tracks and murders serial killers. The
final episode of the series aired Sept. 22.  “We’re thrilled to have ‘Dexter,’ one of Showtime’s
highest-rated shows, on Netflix and so quickly after it
completed its record-breaking run,” Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s
chief content officer, said in the statement.  Netflix, based in Los Gatos, California, fell 4.3 percent
to $314 at the close in New York. The shares have more than
tripled this year. CBS, controlled by Chairman Sumner Redstone,
declined 0.9 percent to $59.25 and has gained 56 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
