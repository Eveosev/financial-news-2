The pound was little changed against
the euro following last week’s drop as an industry report showed
U.K. house prices increased for a ninth month in October.  Britain’s currency was within two U.S. cents of a four-week
high versus the dollar as the data added to evidence the economy
is strengthening. Gross domestic product grew 0.8 percent in the
third quarter, the most since 2010, the government said last
week. British  government bonds  were little changed.  “The U.K. data should continue to be pretty good,” said
 Lutz Karpowitz , a senior currency strategist at Commerzbank AG
in Frankfurt. “The GDP data last week were pretty strong, so
this is something which could lead to some more sterling
strength.”  The pound traded at 85.45 pence per euro at 4:26 p.m.
London time, after depreciating to 85.55 pence on Oct. 24, the
weakest level since Aug. 29. It slid 0.9 percent last week.
Sterling dropped 0.2 percent to $1.6132 after rising to $1.6257
on Oct. 23, the highest since Oct. 1.  Average  home values  in  England  and  Wales  rose 0.5 percent
this month, matching September’s increase, Hometrack said in a
statement. They’ve climbed each month since stagnating in
January. Annual price inflation accelerated to 3.1 percent, the
 most  since November 2007, according to the London-based property
researcher.  Millions of U.K. commuters were told to stay at home and
more than 220,000 properties lost power as southern England’s
worst storm since 2008 blocked rail tracks, severed electricity
cables and closed a nuclear power plant.  Best Performer  The pound gained 3.1 percent in the past three months, the
best performer of 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, on optimism economic
growth was quickening. The euro rose 1.9 percent, while the
dollar weakened 2.3 percent.  Under its forward-guidance policy announced Aug. 7, the
 Bank of England  pledged to keep the benchmark  interest rate  at
0.5 percent at least until unemployment falls to 7 percent,
subject to caveats on inflation and financial stability.
Officials are preparing new quarterly forecasts for growth and
inflation, which Governor  Mark Carney  will present on Nov. 13.  “The forecasts that form the basis of the report appear
set to show an upgraded growth outlook and a bringing forward of
the unemployment rate threshold by one or two quarters compared
to the previous forecast,”  Paul Robson , a London-based foreign-exchange strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, wrote
in a note to clients today. “The focus now turns back to
whether this solid pace of expansion can continue.”  The pound will “benefit” from any significant change to
the BOE’s forecasts, he wrote.  U.K. Growth  The U.K. economy  expanded  0.8 percent in the third quarter,
up from 0.7 percent growth between April and June and the most
since the second quarter of 2010, the  Office for National
Statistics  said on Oct. 25.  The benchmark  10-year gilt yield  was at 2.61 percent after
falling 10 basis points, or 0.1 percentage point, last week. The
price of the 2.25 percent bond due in September 2023 was at
96.895.  The  extra yield  investors demand to hold 10-year gilts
instead of similar-maturity German bunds was 86 basis points, up
from 51 basis points at the end of 2012.  “We see gilts as likely to remain vulnerable to better
economic data,” Gary Dugan, Singapore-based chief investment
officer for  Asia  and the Middle East and Alan Higgins, London-based U.K. chief investment officer for Coutts & Co. wrote in a
note to clients today. “We continue to expect them to
underperform their peers in  Europe , where growth is more
sluggish.”  Gilts lost 2.2 percent this year through Oct. 25, according
to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Treasuries fell 1.8 percent and
German securities slid 1.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
