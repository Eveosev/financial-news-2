     Oct. 28 (Bloomberg) --The Treasury Department’s $32 billion
sale of two-year notes may draw a  yield  of 0.322 percent,
according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of
eight of the  Federal Reserve ’s 21 primary dealers.  The securities, which mature in October 2015, yielded 0.330
percent in pre-auction trading. Bids are due by 1 p.m.  New York 
time. Last month’s sale of the securities yielded 0.348 percent,
and the record auction low was 0.22  percent  on July 24, 2012.  The size of today’s offering was cut by $1 billion for the
third straight month, the  longest stretch  of reductions since
October 2010. The amount of the securities sold each month
peaked at $44 billion from October 2009 through April 2010.  The Sept. 24 offering’s  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges
demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was
3.09, down from 3.21 the previous month. The average ratio for
the past 10 auctions was 3.31.  Indirect bidders , a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 24 percent of the securities at
the September sale. The average for the past 10 auctions is 23
percent.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 21.8 percent of
the notes at the last sale, compared with an average of 22.4
percent at the past 10 sales.  Two-year notes have returned 0.3 percent this year,
compared with a loss of 1.8 percent by the broad Treasuries
market, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The
two-year securities gained 0.3 percent in 2012, while Treasuries
in total rose 2.2 percent.  Today’s offering is the first of three note auctions this
week totaling $96 billion. The government will sell $35 billion
in five-year debt tomorrow and $29 billion in seven-year
securities on Oct. 30.  The Fed’s primary dealers trade  government securities  with
the central bank and are obligated to bid in Treasury auctions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
