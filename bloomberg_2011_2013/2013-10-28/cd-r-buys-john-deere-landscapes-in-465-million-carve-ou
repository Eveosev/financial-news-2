Clayton Dubilier & Rice LLC agreed
to buy a majority stake in  Deere & Co. (DE) ’s landscaping business in
a transaction valued at $465 million, betting on a revival of
property construction.  CD&R will buy a 60 percent stake in John Deere Landscapes,
which will become a standalone company, according to a statement
today from New York-based CD&R. Deere will receive $300 million
in cash as part of the transaction, Moline, Illinois-based Deere
said in a separate statement.  “The new company should benefit from a recovery in
residential and commercial construction activity as well as
through the meaningful value-creation opportunities,” Ken Giuriceo, a partner at CD&R, said in the statement.  CD&R, run by Donald Gogel, has completed deals valued about
$90 billion since its founding as a leveraged buyout firm in
1978. Deere started its landscape business in 2001 to supply
turf, irrigation, lighting and other materials for outdoor
construction. John Deere Landscapes has more than $1 billion in
annual revenue, according to CD&R.  To contact the reporter on this story:
