Crude options volatility rose with
the underlying futures as Libyan output declined and on
speculation that the U.S. Federal Reserve would maintain the
pace of stimulus.  Implied volatility for at-the-money December options, a
measure of expected futures swings and a key gauge of value, was
19.56 percent at 3:05 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
up from 18.86 percent Oct. 25.  West Texas Intermediate crude for December delivery gained
0.8 percent to settle at $98.68 on the Nymex. Futures rallied
after National Oil Corp. said crude output in  Libya  fell to
250,000 barrels a day because of labor protests. The  Federal
Open Market Committee , which opens a two-day meeting tomorrow,
will probably delay the reduction of monthly bond purchases
until March, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists.  Puts, or bets that prices would fall, made up 57 percent of
volume in electronic trading today. The most active options were
December $87 puts, which slid 3 cents to 5 cents a barrel on
1,749 contracts at 3:11 p.m. December $86 puts followed with
1,700 lots. They dropped 2 cents to 4 cents a barrel.  In the previous session, bearish bets accounted for 57
percent of the 92,917 contracts changing hands. December $90
puts were the most-active options on Oct. 25, with 5,307
contracts. They fell 15 cents to 18 cents a barrel. December
$100 calls climbed 8 cents to 84 cents on volume of 4,833 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts, with
42,454 contracts. Next were December $90 puts with 42,145 lots
and December $85 puts with 37,637.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
