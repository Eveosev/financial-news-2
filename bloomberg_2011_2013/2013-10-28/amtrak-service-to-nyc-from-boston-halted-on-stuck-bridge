The  Amtrak  train service between 
 Boston  and New York City’s Penn Station is halted as the moving 
bridge at Pelham Bay in the Bronx north of Manhattan is stuck 
open, said Christina Leeds, an Amtrak spokeswoman.  Passengers on Amtrak train 165, halted near New Rochelle,
N.Y., are being transferred to the Metro North commuter rail
operated by the  Metropolitan Transportation Authority  to
complete their journey to Grand Central Station. They will then
be transported to Penn Station, where Amtrak originates, Leeds
said.  The bridge malfunctioned when operators attempted to close
it at 6:55 p.m. local time, she said. Repairs are under way with
no reliable estimate of when they’ll be complete.  Five trains in the Northeast corridor are held up by the
bridge. Three are waiting to cross the bridge and two more are
being held from departing at New York’s  Penn Station , Leeds
said.  Passengers who have paid for travel and elect to not do so
amid the disruption can receive a refund or voucher for future
travel, Amtrak said in an e-mail. Some online reservations can
be modified or canceled.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
