Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  swung between gains and losses today as investors
weighed a decline in inventory against weaker winter demand.  Rebar for delivery in May, the most-active contract by
volume on the Shanghai Futures Exchange, was little changed at
3,584 yuan ($589) a metric ton at 10:15 a.m. local time, after
gaining 0.3 percent and losing 0.2 percent.  Inventory of the building material in China fell 2.2
percent last week to 5.97 million tons, the lowest level since
the week ended Jan. 11, according to Shanghai Steelhome
Information Technology Co. Iron ore for May delivery, the most-active contract on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange , gained for the
first time in six days, adding 0.5 percent to 923  yuan  a ton.  “There were concerns about slowing demand in the winter
season, but rebar is still supported by low inventory and
relatively resilient iron ore prices,” said Wang Yongliang, an
analyst at Beijing Cifco Futures Co. in Tianjin.  The  spot  price of rebar was little changed at 3,480 yuan a
ton on Oct. 25, according to Beijing Antaike Information
Development Co.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port,
tracked by the Steel Index, lost 0.2 percent to $133.30 a dry
ton on the same day.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
