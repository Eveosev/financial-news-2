Six people were killed and four
injured after a suspected gas leak at a  coal mine  in northern
Spain, a spokesman for the regional government said.  The four injured are in hospital, and more people remain
inside the mine, said the spokesman for the Castilla-Leon
government, who declined to be named in line with policy. He
couldnâ€™t give more details on how many people may be missing.  The accident at La Pola de Gordon, at a mine owned by SA
Hullera Vasco-Leonesa, happened at about 1 p.m. local time
today, according to a spokesman for the operator, who also asked
not to be named. He confirmed at least five people were killed
and said the death toll may rise. There were no indications of
any potential failures before the accident, he said.  The accident is the worst mining disaster in  Spain  for 18
years, state news agency Efe reported.  To contact the reporters on this story:
