Australian Prime Minister  Tony Abbott  visited  Afghanistan  to mark the end of Australia’s
longest military commitment in a war.  The mission in the southern province of Uruzgan is drawing
down and 1,000 Australian troops currently serving in
Afghanistan will have returned home by the end of the year,
Abbott said in a ceremony. Forty Australians have been  killed  in
the conflict and another 260 wounded, according to the
 Department of Defense .  The mission in Afghanistan “has been critical to our
national security,” Abbott said in a statement after the visit,
where he was joined by opposition leader Bill Shorten. Australia
has worked to ensure the South Asian nation doesn’t again become
a haven for terrorists, he said.  Australia invoked its defense treaty with the U.S.
following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks triggered a worldwide
tightening of security. Dozens of Australian citizens have been
killed in attacks overseas since then, including 88 in bombings
on the Indonesian island of Bali in 2002, and three in an
assault by  suicide bombers  on two luxury hotels in Jakarta in
2009.  “It was important to reaffirm Australia’s ongoing
commitment to support Afghanistan’s security, governance and
development in 2014 and beyond,” Abbott said in the statement.
“Australia will not walk away from Afghanistan but it will be
for the Afghan people to determine their own future.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
