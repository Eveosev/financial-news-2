A gauge of Treasury market
volatility fell to a five-month low on speculation the Federal
Reserve will maintain its debt purchases at $85 billion a month
following a two-day policy meeting that ends Oct. 30.  Three-month implied volatility on 10-year  interest-rate
swaps  was 75.22, a level not seen since May. The average over
the past year is 81.41. The gauge is a measure of projected
yield fluctuations over the next 90 days. It has fallen from
116.91 in September when some investors speculated the Fed would
begin trimming its bond purchases that month. Treasury prices
slid as investors prepared to bid on $96 billion of debt over
three days starting today.  “The Fed is not tapering yet,” said Ali Jalai, a trader
in Singapore at Scotiabank, a unit of  Canada ’s  Bank of Nova
Scotia (BNS)  and one of the 21 primary dealers that trade directly
with the central bank. “For the next two months, I think
they’re going to buy. When the taper was on the table, people
were selling the bond market and it was causing a lot of
volatility.”  Benchmark 10-year  yields  rose two basis points to 2.53
percent as of 6:59 a.m. in  London , according to Bloomberg Bond
Trader prices. The yield is below its average over the past
decade of 3.52 percent. The price of the 2.5 percent note due
August 2023 declined 1/8, or $1.25 per $1,000 face amount, to 99
25/32. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The  Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Bond Index (BUSY)  has risen 0.7
percent in October, leaving it down 1.8 percent for 2013.  Japan ’s 10-year yield was little changed at 0.615 percent.
The nation’s government securities have returned 0.6 percent
this month and 2.5 percent for the year, based on the  Bloomberg
Japan Sovereign Bond Index. (BJPN)   Below Average  Treasury trading  volume  at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of U.S. government debt, averaged $260.8 billion
last week. The average this year is $315.4 billion.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s MOVE Index, another measure
of volatility in Treasuries, was as low as 62.05 last week, the
least since May.  U.S. central bankers will pare the monthly pace of asset
buying to $70 billion from $85 billion at their March 18-19
meeting, according to the median of responses in a Bloomberg
News survey of economists.  The Treasury plans to sell $32 billion of two-year notes
today, $35 billion of five-year securities tomorrow and $29
billion of seven-year debt the following day.  At the last two-year sale on Sept. 24, investors  bid  for
3.09 times the amount of debt available. The average over the
past 12 of the monthly auctions is 3.43.  Retail Stalling  U.S. retail sales probably stalled in September, analysts
said before economic reports this week.  Economists forecast no change in purchases, which would be
the worst reading in six months, after a 0.2 percent advance in
August, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey
of banks and securities companies before the Commerce Department
report Oct. 29.  Figures today will show industrial production climbed for a
second month and pending home sales were unchanged after falling
from June through August, based on separate surveys.  Ten-year yields in the range of 2.474 percent to 2.399
percent are “poised to bottom and turn higher over the coming
sessions,” according to  MacNeil Curry , a technical strategist
at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. A move to the mid-October high
of about 2.759 percent is likely, New York-based Curry wrote in
a report yesterday.  Ten-year yields will finish 2013 at 2.6 percent, Jay Barry,
Kimberly Harano, Bruce Sun and Devdeep Sarkar at JPMorgan Chase
& Co. in New York wrote in a report Oct. 25. Merrill Lynch and
JPMorgan are both primary dealers.  The 16-day government shutdown this month will help send
yields down, said Hiroki Shimazu, an economist in  Tokyo  at SMBC
Nikko Securities Inc., part of Japan’s second-largest publicly
traded bank by market value.  “Yields will continue to go lower,” Shimazu said. “The
Fed will continue its monetary policy. The government shutdown
will have a bad impact on the economy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
