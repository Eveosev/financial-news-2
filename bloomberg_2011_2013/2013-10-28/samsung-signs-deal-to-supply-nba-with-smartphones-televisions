Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , the world’s
largest maker of smartphones, signed a multiyear deal to supply
the  National Basketball Association  with mobile devices and
televisions.  Under the agreement with the NBA, the Women’s National
Basketball Association and the NBA Development League, referees
will use Samsung tablets courtside to review key plays,
according to a statement, which didn’t provide financial terms.
The deal is worth $100 million over three years, the Wall Street
Journal  reported , citing people familiar with the matter.  The NBA agreement also includes daily recaps and analysis
that fans can see on their Samsung devices.  Asia ’s biggest
technology company is seeking to deepen its footprint in the
Americas by pairing its smartphones and tablets with original
content. Today’s pact follows a deal earlier this year to
release rapper Jay-Z’s new album via an exclusive application on
Samsung handsets.  The NBA also plans to use Samsung devices during key
events, including playoffs and All-Star functions.  The agreement is the biggest collaboration between a North
American sports league and Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung,
according to the statement. It’s also the NBA’s most extensive
tie-up with a consumer electronics company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
