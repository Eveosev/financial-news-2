The New York Islanders acquired left
wing Thomas Vanek, the fifth pick in the 2003 National Hockey
League draft, from the Buffalo Sabres for forward Matt Moulson
and two future draft selections.  The Islanders gave up their first-round pick in 2014 and a
second-round choice in 2015 for Vanek, who recorded 254 goals
and 243 assists in 598 NHL games with the Sabres and was
selected as an All-Star in 2009. He had four goals and five
assists in 13 games for Buffalo this year.  The Islanders have a 4-4-3 record this season and are tied
for second place in the Eastern Conferenceâ€™s eight-team
Metropolitan Division. Moulson, 29, had six goals and three
assists in 11 games this year after collecting 30 or more goals
in three of the past four seasons in New York.  The 29-year-old Vanek, who is in the last year of a seven-year, $50 million contract, was a co-captain for the Sabres, who
are off to a 2-10-1 start.  To contact the reporter on this story:
