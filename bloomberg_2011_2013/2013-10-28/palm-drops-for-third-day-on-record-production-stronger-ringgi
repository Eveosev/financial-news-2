Palm oil  fell for a third day after
Malaysia, the second-largest producer, estimated its output
would reach a record and the country’s currency rose to a four-month high, reducing the appeal of ringgit-denominated futures.  The contract for delivery in January slid as much as 0.7
percent to 2,426 ringgit ($774) a metric ton on the Bursa
Malaysia Derivatives, and was at 2,438 ringgit at the midday
break in Kuala Lumpur. Palm for physical delivery in November
was at 2,450 ringgit, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Production will probably expand 3.3 percent to 19.4 million
tons this year as yields increase, more trees begin production
and oil extraction rates improve, Malaysia’s finance ministry
said Oct. 25 in its Economic Report for 2013-2014. The ringgit
was at the strongest level against the dollar since June, after
the government laid out plans to cut the fiscal deficit in the
2014 budget announced Oct. 25.  “When the ringgit is higher, palm becomes expensive for
importers like India and  China ,” said Prathamesh Mallya, an
analyst at AnandRathi Commodities Ltd. Weather conditions
indicate that the government’s production forecast is achievable
and that would be “bearish for prices,” he said by phone from
Mumbai. India and China are the world’s largest consumers.  Refined palm oil for May delivery was little changed at
6,078  yuan  ($999) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange  and
 soybean oil  was also little changed at 7,130 yuan.  Soybeans for delivery in January fell 0.4 percent to
$12.8825 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, while soybean
oil for December gained 0.3 percent to 40.85 cents a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
