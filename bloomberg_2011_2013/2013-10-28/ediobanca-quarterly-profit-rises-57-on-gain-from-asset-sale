Mediobanca SpA (MB) ,  Italy ’s biggest
publicly traded investment bank, said fiscal first-quarter
profit rose 57 percent, boosted by the sale of a stake in
 Telecom Italia SpA. (TIT)   Net income rose to 171.2 million euros ($236.4 million) in
the three months ended Sept. 30 from 109 million euros a year
earlier, the Milan-based bank said in a statement today.
Earnings include a 58.8 million-euro gain from the sale of part
of its holding in Telco SpA, the vehicle that controls Telecom
Italia, the country’s biggest phone company.  Chief Executive Officer Alberto Nagel is planning to sell
stakes in companies including  Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G)  and  RCS
Mediagroup SpA (RCS)  to boost profit. The firm will focus on its main
business and forecasts revenue from banking activities of 2.1
billion euros by 2016 under a three-year plan announced in June.  “The transformation story and market positioning are
unique in the Italian banking space,” Azzurra Guelfi, a London-based analyst at Citigroup, wrote in a note on Oct. 23. “We see
management’s strategy as ideal for the company’s development.”  Revenue in the quarter fell to 416.3 million euros from
453.4 million euros a year earlier on lower income from fees and
trading. Mediobanca’s loan-loss provisions increased to 128.9
million euros in the quarter from 111.4 million euros a year
ago, and operating costs fell 2.9 percent to 168.6 million
euros.  The core Tier 1 capital ratio, a key measure of financial
strength, fell to 11.5 percent as of Sept. 30 from 11.7 percent
at the end of June, Mediobanca said.  Mediobanca rose as much as 3.2 percent to 6.53 euros in
Milan after the earnings report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
