Cerberus Capital Management LP, the
$20 billion New York-based firm focused on distressed assets,
started a fund to invest in commercial mortgage debt, according
to a letter to investors obtained by  Bloomberg News .  The Cerberus CMBS Opportunities Fund, which began Oct. 7,
can bet on and against senior and subordinated commercial
mortgage-backed securities, interest-only securities, commercial
real estate collateralized-debt obligations and mezzanine loans,
according to the letter.  The “new issue market has grown steadily since 2009 with
2013 issuance ahead of last year’s pace,” the firm wrote.  CMBS issuance is poised to double to $70 billion in 2013,
according to Credit Suisse Group AG. Moody’s Investors Service
is boosting the level of credit protection required to achieve
investment-grade rankings on newly issued commercial-mortgage
bonds as loans get risker.  The fund’s investment team is composed of Scott Stelzer,
head of commercial mortgage trading; Kyle Schneider, managing
director; Ross Feldman, senior vice president; and Matthew Waldenberg, assistant vice president, who all started at
Cerberus in 2008, according to the letter.  Peter Duda , a spokesman for Cerberus with  Weber Shandwick ,
declined to comment on the letter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
