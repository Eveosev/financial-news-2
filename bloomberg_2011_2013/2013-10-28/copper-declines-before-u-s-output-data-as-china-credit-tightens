Copper dropped before industrial
output data from the U.S. and on concern that credit is
tightening in  China . Lead and zinc fell for the first time in
three days.  The contract for copper delivery in three months on the
London Metal Exchange dropped 0.2 percent to $7,171.25 a metric
ton at 11:47 a.m. in  Tokyo . Futures lost 0.8 percent last week
and are down 1.8 percent this month. Lead fell 0.5 percent to
$2,193.50 a ton and zinc slid 0.3 percent to $1,948.75 a ton.  The U.S. will report industrial output today that may be
unchanged from a month ago and after orders to manufacturers
unexpectedly dropped in September and as households were more
glum in October for a third consecutive month. Copper futures in
 Shanghai  slid 2.1 percent last week after China’s money-market
rates jumped the most since June.  “Concern about the U.S. economy and China’s credit
tightening put downward pressure on metals,” said Chae Un Soo,
a metals trader at Korea Exchange Bank Futures Co. in  Seoul .
Shrinking LME copper stockpiles would limit any further decline
in prices, he said.  Metal for delivery in January on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange rose 0.5 percent to 51,410  yuan  ($8,453) a ton. Futures
for delivery in December dropped 0.3 percent to $3.26 a pound on
the Comex in New York.  LME copper stockpiles fell for the 37th straight session to
480,875 tons, exchange data showed Oct. 25.  Nickel futures dropped, while aluminum and tin were little
changed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
