Copper prices in London rose for the
third straight session amid speculation that the  Federal Reserve 
will maintain economic stimulus in the U.S., the second-biggest
consumer of the metal.  Fed policy makers, who begin a two-day meeting tomorrow,
will wait until March to scale back on debt purchases of $85
billion a month, a Bloomberg survey showed this month.
Stockpiles of copper monitored by the London Metal Exchange
posted the longest slump since July 2009.  “The Fed has put a tailwind behind these markets,”
 Michael Smith , the president of T&K Futures & Options in  Port
St. Lucie ,  Florida , said in a telephone interview. “It’s just a
matter of time before we start to see more inflation in
commodities, including copper. Once we start to see more steady
growth worldwide, you’re going to see copper going higher.”  Copper for delivery in three months gained 0.1 percent to
settle at $7,190 a metric ton ($3.26 a pound) at 5:50 p.m. local
time on the LME. The metal rose 0.2 percent in the previous two
sessions.  Inventories monitored by the LME declined 0.6 percent to
478,200 metric tons, the lowest since March. They dropped for
the 38th straight session.  China  is the top consumer of copper.  In New York, copper futures for December delivery closed
unchanged at $3.269 a pound on the Comex. The metal pared gains
after reports showed slowing factory output and a drop in home
purchases in the U.S. The price has declined 11 percent this
year.  Aluminum, lead, nickel and zinc gained in London. Tin fell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
