Ethanol tumbled, widening the
discount to gasoline, as cheaper corn enabled distillers to
boost production of the biofuel.  The spread widened 7.38 cents to 79.99 cents a gallon, the
biggest one-day expansion since Oct. 4. Pratt Energy said Oct.
24 that it restarted operations at a plant that was idle for
more than five years.  “There’s been news of plants coming back online,” said
Will Babler, a broker at Atten Babler Risk Management in Galena,
 Illinois . “It seems like production is trending higher.”  Denatured ethanol for November delivery fell 3 cents, or
1.6 percent, to $1.831 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Futures are down 16 percent this year.  Gasoline for November delivery rose 4.38 cents, or 1.7
percent, to $2.6309 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol is made primarily from corn in the U.S. About 59
percent of the crop was  harvested  as of yesterday, up from 39
percent the previous week, the Agriculture Department said
today.  Farmers planted a record number of acres as they sought to
recover from last summer’s drought that destroyed yields and
raised prices for the grain.  Corn for December delivery dropped 9.25 cents, or 2.1
percent, to $4.3075 a bushel in Chicago. The December corn crush
spread of corn to ethanol was 11 cents, up from 10 cents Oct.
25, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Production Rising  Production jumped 3.2 percent to 897,000 barrels a day in
the week ended Oct. 18, the highest since June 2012, Energy
Information Administration data show. Stockpiles climbed 0.5
percent to 15.5 million barrels, according to the Energy
Department’s statistical arm.  Inventories are  below average for this time of year . Babler
said more production is needed to replenish supply.  The EPA tracks compliance with the federal ethanol-use
mandate with Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs, tradable
certificates that are attached to each gallon of biofuel.  Corn-based RINs fell 1.5 cents to 21 cents, the lowest
since Jan. 24. Advanced RINs, which cover biodiesel and
Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol, decreased 5 cents to 28
cents, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The U.S. hasn’t made any  foreign purchases  of the biofuel
since Sept. 27, according to EIA data.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  rose 3 cents to
$2.155 a gallon; on the West Coast prices gained 2.5 cents to
$2.185; in  Chicago  the additive lost 2.5 cents to $2.035; and in
the U.S. Gulf the biofuel dropped 1.5 cents to $2.125 a gallon,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The West Coast’s premium to  Gulf Coast  expanded 4 cents to
6 cents, while Chicago’s discount to New York widened 5.5 cents
to 12 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
