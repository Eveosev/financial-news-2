LDK Solar Co.,  China ’s second-biggest maker of solar wafers, said it won agreement from
noteholders for a 30-day reprieve from having to pay interest
that was due Aug. 28.  The extension arrangement for payments owed on the
company’s 2014 securities will expire on Nov. 26, the company
said today in a  statement  on its website. LDK Solar said Sidley
Austin LLP is acting as counsel.  The company, based in Xinyu, China, said last month it
delayed $13 million of interest payments on the notes. It has
hired Jefferies Group LLC to advise on its offshore debt
obligations.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
