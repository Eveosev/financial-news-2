World wine production is forecast to
climb 8.8 percent to the highest in seven years as grape
harvests rebound in  Spain ,  Argentina  and  France , according to
the International Organisation of Vine and Wine.  The 2013 vintage is seen rising to 281 million hectoliters
(7.4 billion gallons) from 258.2 million hectoliters in 2012,
the OIV, as the Paris-based industry group is known, wrote in e-mailed  documents  today. Last year’s output was raised from a
March estimate of 250.9 million hectoliters.  Volumes are projected to climb for the eight largest
producers, leaving enough wine to fully cover distilling-industry requirements for the first time since 2007, according
to the OIV.  Italy  is poised to remain the largest producer ahead
of France and Spain, according to the industry group, which has
45 member nations from  Australia  to  Turkey .  “After five modest harvests in a row and an exceptionally
weak 2012 harvest, wine production in 2013 can be qualified as
relatively high,” the OIV wrote. “The wine world this year
returns to the levels of 2006.”  Consumption is forecast to be around 245 million
hectoliters, leaving about 35.7 million hectoliters for the
distilling industry and vermouth makers.  World wine production by volume is expected to jump by 22.8
million hectoliters, equivalent to 3 billion bottles. Spanish
output may rise to 40 million hectoliters from 32.5 million
hectoliters after vineyards recovered from drought last year,
the documents showed.  France, Italy  Argentina is estimated to produce 15 million hectoliters
this year from 11.8 million hectoliters in 2012, the OIV said.
France’s 2013 vintage may increase to 44.1 million hectoliters
from 32.5 million hectoliters.  Italy’s production is expected to climb to 44.9 million
hectoliters from 43.8 million hectoliters last year, while U.S.
volume may climb to 22 million hectoliters from 20.5 million
hectoliters, according to the organization.  Among major producers,  Romania  is expected to post the
biggest gain, lifting output 79 percent to 5.94 million
hectoliters after a heat wave last year, followed by Hungary
with a 44 percent jump to 2.62 million hectoliters and  New
Zealand  with a 28 percent increase to 2.63 million hectoliters.  Italy was the world’s largest wine exporter by volume in
the first half of 2013 with 20.9 million hectoliters, followed
by Spain with 17.3 million hectoliters and France with 14.9
million hectoliters. By value, France took the biggest share of
exports with 7.86 billion euros ($10.8 billion), followed by
Italy with 4.87 billion euros and Spain with 2.41 billion euros,
OIV data show.  The U.S. was the biggest importer at 4.04 billion euros,
followed by the U.K. at 3.86 billion euros and  Germany  with
inbound shipments valued at 2.47 billion euros, the industry
group reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
