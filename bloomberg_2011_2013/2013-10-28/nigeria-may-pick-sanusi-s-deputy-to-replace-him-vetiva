Vetiva Capital Management Ltd. said
four deputy governors of the  Central Bank of Nigeria  may be
among the front-runners to succeed Governor Lamido Sanusi when
his five-year term ends next year.  The deputies are Sarah Alade, Suleiman Barau, Tunde Lemo
and Kingsley Moghalu, Vetiva, a brokerage based in  Nigeria ’s
commercial capital, Lagos, said in an e-mailed report today.
Aigboje Aig-Imoukhuede, chief executive officer of  Access Bank
Plc. (ACCESS) , is also a contender, Adedayo Idowu, an economist at
Vetiva, wrote in the report.  Sanusi, 52, said in March he won’t renew his contract when
it expires in June 2014. He helped to clean up the banking
industry during a debt crisis in 2009 and has left  interest
rates  at a record high for almost two years to bolster the
currency and keep inflation under control.  President Goodluck Jonathan may name Sanusi’s replacement
in the first quarter, Idowu said. All those listed by Vetiva as
possible successors share similar views to Sanusi on monetary
policy, she said.  “We believe that the president will attempt to seek
consistency and reassure markets by nominating someone who will
be guided by a sensible economic framework,” Idowu said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
