Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU)  bought a
stake in a California solar power project from closely held U.S.
power generator Tenaska Inc.  Prudential Capital Group bought a minority interest in the
130-megawatt Tenaska Imperial Solar Energy Center South project
near El Centro, California, the Omaha, Nebraska-based company
said today in a statement. Terms of the transaction are
confidential, according to the statement.  Imperial Valley will produce enough electricity once
completed for about 44,000 California homes at peak times
through a 25-year power contract with  Sempra Energy (SRE)  utility San
Diego Gas & Electric, Tenaska said. The project’s  website  states
that the project will be completed before the year’s end.  Tenaska is developing a separate 150-megawatt project
called Imperial Solar Energy Center West near El Centro that
will also sell its power to SDG&E.  To contact the reporter on this story:
