Emerald Biogas Ltd. today began
operating a facility in northeast  England  that will use food
waste to generate enough energy for about 2,000 homes a year.  The heat and power plant in County Durham cost about 8
million pounds ($13 million) to build, the Newton Aycliffe-based
company said in a  statement  on its website. It will process
cardboard, plastic and waste from supermarkets, fast-food
outlets, schools and businesses, it said.  Supermarkets and businesses are being pushed to send food
waste to anaerobic digestion facilities such as Emeraldâ€™s by a
landfill tax that makes it increasingly expensive to bury waste.
It was introduced in April 2012 at 64 pounds a metric ton and
rose to 72 pounds this April.  Planning consent already has been granted for Emerald to
expand the processing capacity of the plant to four times its
current size.  To contact the reporter on this story:
