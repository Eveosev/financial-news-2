Moscow will attract double the
foreign direct investment this year as the Russian capital
promotes plans to become a regional financial hub and expand the
 subway system , according to a minister in the city’s government.  FDI in Moscow could reach as much as $10 billion a year in
2013 and 2014 compared with $4.2 billion in 2012, said Sergey Cheremin, head of the city’s department for economic and
international relations. Investments totaled $5.2 billion
through June 2013, he said.  “We are seeing positive trend of increasing foreign direct
investments in Moscow,” Cheremin said on the sidelines of a
conference in New York yesterday. “Investors are beginning to
believe in the stability of the Moscow market. The market is
growing and they see a lot of opportunities there.”  Moscow, whose $350 billion gross domestic product is
similar to that of  Austria ’s economy, is targeting more foreign
investment as the Russian economy is experiencing the worst
slowdown since the 2009 recession. Prosperity Capital Management
said this month that Russian minority investors are enduring the
worst year for corporate governance scandals since 2009 with
disputes at OAO Rosneft, OAO Pharmstandard and OAO Uralkali.  “We still suffer from a lot of stereotypes,” Cheremin
said. “There is a strong perception that Moscow is a very
corrupt city. The perception is absolutely wrong and the reality
is totally different.”  Moscow needs more than $100 billion in infrastructure
investments by 2030, he said. As much as 40 percent of the funds
will come from private local and foreign companies, according to
Cheremin. The city plans to add 150 kilometers of tracks to its
subway system by 2020, increasing it from about 300 kilometers
currently, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
