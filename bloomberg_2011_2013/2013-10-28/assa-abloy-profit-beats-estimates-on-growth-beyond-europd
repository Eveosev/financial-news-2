Assa Abloy AB (ASSAB) , the world’s largest
lockmaker, posted third-quarter profit that beat analysts’
estimates as growth in the U.S. and  Asia  helped offset weak
sales in  Europe .  Net income rose to 1.47 billion kronor ($232.6 million)
from 1.31 billion kronor a year earlier, the Stockholm-based
company said in a statement today. Analysts on average predicted
profit of 1.42 billion kronor, according to 13 estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue increased 5.1 percent to 12.1
billion kronor.  “Americas, Asia-Pacific and Global Technologies all had
strong organic growth,” Chief Executive Johan Molin said in the
statement. “The group’s earnings reached a record level,
largely due to good growth arising from new products.”  Assa Abloy is countering weakening European demand by
expanding in  emerging markets , and has a target of doubling the
proportion of sales coming from developing economies to about 50
percent of the total by 2025. The company agreed to buy the
fire-door business of Gdansk, Poland-based Mercor SA in
September, and to acquire Chinese fire- and security-door
producers Harbin Xinmao Burglarproof Door Manufacturing Co. and
Yantai Huasheng Industrial Co Ltd. this month.  The Swedish company said today that it will close about 30
production units and offices over three years as part of a 1
billion-krona reorganization starting this quarter. Savings
generated from the measures will help earnings in about three
years, Assa Abloy said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
