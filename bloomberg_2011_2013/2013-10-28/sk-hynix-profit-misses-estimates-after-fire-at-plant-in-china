SK Hynix Inc. (000660) , the world’s second-largest maker of memory chips, posted profit that missed analyst
estimates after a fire at a factory last month crimped output
during the period when demand is typically strong.  Net income, excluding minority interest, rose to 958.3
billion won ($903 million) in the three months ended September
from 1.9 billion won a year earlier, Icheon, South Korea-based
SK Hynix said today. That compares with the 988 billion-won
average of 22  analysts’ estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  SK Hynix, a  supplier  to  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and Sony Corp., will cut
its NAND flash capacity as much as 30 percent in the fourth
quarter to boost output of dynamic random-access memory chips
and counter the impact of the Sept. 4 blaze in Wuxi,  China . The
fire pushed prices of DRAM chips to a more than two-year high
and restoration of the factory may be delayed a month beyond the
November target date.  “Potential delay of restoration at the fire-damaged plant
signals the overall memory chips will remain in shortage in the
fourth quarter and well into the first quarter,” Nam Dae Jong,
a Hana Daetoo Securities Co. analyst, said in  Seoul  today. “SK
Hynix’s earnings will deteriorate in the fourth quarter due to
the fire.”  SK Hynix fell 3.5 percent to close at 31,950 won in Seoul,
the lowest in almost a month. The shares have gained 24 percent
this year compared with the benchmark Kospi index that has added
2.7 percent in 2013.  Operating Profit  Operating profit, or sales excluding the cost of goods sold
and administrative costs, was 1.16 trillion won on revenue of
4.08 trillion won.  DRAM chips, along with NAND memory, are needed in handsets
and tablet computers made by Apple,  Samsung Electronics (005930)  Co. and
 HTC Corp. (2498)  for functions from playing video and multitasking to
storing books and photographs.  SK Hynix shipments of DRAM chips are expected to fall about
10 percent this quarter and deliveries of NAND will drop by
about 15 percent from the period ended September, said Kim Joon
Ho, President and Head of Corporate Center.  The benchmark DDR3 2-gigabit dynamic random-access memory
chip  rose  to $2.34 on Oct. 4, the highest level since it touched
$2.37 in November 2010. It stood at $1.60 on Sept. 4 when the
fire hit Hynix’s factory, according to DRAMeXchange, Asia’s
largest market for the components.  Worldwide PC shipments fell 8.6 percent in the third
quarter. The decline, the sixth consecutive drop, was tempered
by growth in the U.S., where shipments climbed 3.5 percent,
market researcher  Gartner Inc. (IT)  said earlier this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
