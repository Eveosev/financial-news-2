 William Susman, managing director 
at Threadstone Partners, says deal volume will remain at recent 
highs thanks to cheap debt for financing, tremendous private 
equity funding and strategic companies which need growth 
opportunities. Susman says deals are being made across all 
sectors from luxury department stores to specialty retail. He 
says brand deals, too, are at a record. Susman talks with 
Bloomberg's  Kathleen Hays  and Vonnie Quinn from the 17th annual 
WWD CEO Summit at The Pierre in New York on  Bloomberg Radio 's 
"The Hays Advantage." They are joined by guest co-host Ken 
Natori, vice president at The Natori Company. (Source:
