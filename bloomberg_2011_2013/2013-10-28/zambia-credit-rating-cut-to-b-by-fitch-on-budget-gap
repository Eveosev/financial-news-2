Zambia’s credit rating was cut by
 Fitch Ratings  after Africa’s largest copper producer said that
spending on wages and subsidies will widen the  budget deficit 
more than forecast.  The rating was lowered to B, five levels below investment
grade, from B+, Fitch said in a report today. Fitch said the
outlook was stable. Zambia is rated one level higher by  Standard
& Poor’s , which cut its outlook to negative last week, and
Moody’s Investors Service.  “Spending will over-run again in 2014, reflecting the cost
of the wage increase and higher debt service costs,” said
 Carmen Altenkirch , an analyst at Fitch. “Wider deficits will
place upward pressure on key debt ratios.”  Zambia’s budget gap will probably widen to 9 percent of
gross domestic product this year, exceeding Finance Minister
Alexander Chikwanda’s target of 8.5 percent, Altenkirch said.
That’s more than double the government’s 4.3 percent estimate
earlier this year, as falling copper prices hurt revenue.  The kwacha dropped 0.8 percent to 5.395 per dollar today.
The yield on the 2022 dollar bond rose 2 basis points to 6.724
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
