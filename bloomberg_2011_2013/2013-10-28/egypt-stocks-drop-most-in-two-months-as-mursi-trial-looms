Egyptian stocks slid the most since
August on concern the trial of former President Mohamed Mursi
will trigger the return of political instability and after the
benchmark jumped to the highest level in more than two years.  The EGX 30 Index lost 1.6 percent, the most since Aug. 28,
to 6,097.24 at 1:04 p.m. in Cairo, trimming the measure’s gain
since Mursi’s ouster in July to 23 percent. Last week, the
measure advanced to the highest since January 2011. Global
Telecom Holding, formerly known as Orascom Telecom Holding, led
a list of 27 decliners. Luxury property company  Palm Hills 
Developments SAE tumbled 4.8 percent.  Mursi’s Islamist backers have called for demonstrations on
Nov. 4, the day the former leader is set to go on trial, on
charges that include inciting violence that led to the killing
of opposition protesters during his time in office.  Egypt ’s
economy is stuck in the worst slowdown in two decades since the
2011 uprising that toppled President  Hosni Mubarak .  “Investors are becoming increasingly concerned before the
start of Mohamed Mursi’s trial and the instability that may
surround it,” Tamer Nigm, head of sales trading at Cairo-based
Watheeqa Securities, said by phone. “We’re seeing a healthy
correction after the gains over the last couple of weeks.”  About 266 million Egyptian pounds ($39 million) of shares
traded, compared with a one-year daily average of 342 million
pounds. Global Telecom fell 1.7 percent to 4.75 pounds, while
Palm Hills was poised for the biggest loss since June, dropping
to 2.59 pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
