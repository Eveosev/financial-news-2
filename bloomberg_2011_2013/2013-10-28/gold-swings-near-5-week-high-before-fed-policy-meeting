Gold gained for the third straight
session after factory production in the U.S. rose less than
forecast, reviving prospects for an extension of economic
stimulus by the  Federal Reserve .  Output at factories rose 0.1 percent in September, trailing
the 0.3 percent estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists,
figures from the Fed showed today. The central bank starts a
two-day meeting tomorrow. Gold tumbled 19 percent this year amid
concern the Fed would slow its $85 billion in monthly debt
purchases as the economy strengthens.  “The market expects the Fed to postpone tapering for a few
months at least,”  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior market strategist
at Archer Financial Services Inc. in  Chicago , said in a
telephone interview.  Gold for immediate delivery gained 0.3 percent to $1,354.50
an ounce at 1:52 p.m. in New York. Bullion climbed 2.6 percent
last week, the second straight advance.  On the Comex in New York, gold futures for December
delivery settled little changed at $1,352.20. Prices are poised
for the first annual drop in 13 years as some investors lost
faith in the metal as a store of value.  The 16-day U.S. government shutdown probably trimmed 0.25
percentage point from fourth-quarter economic growth and cost
120,000 jobs this month, according to  Jason Furman , head of the
president’s  Council of Economic Advisers .  ‘Lack Support’  “With the recent shutdown, fiscal brinkmanship and modest
employment numbers, there is little reason to taper,”  Suki Cooper , an analyst at Barclays Plc in New York, wrote in a
report today. “Prices lack support from the physical market for
sustained gains.”  Russia’s central bank sold gold for the first time in a
year. Its reserves fell about 0.37 metric ton to 1,015.1 tons in
September, data on the International Monetary Fund’s website
showed. Mexico reduced holdings for a 17th straight month, while
Kazakhstan expanded assets for a 12th successive month, the data
showed.  Silver futures for December delivery lost 0.4 percent to
$22.538 an ounce on the Comex.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
January delivery gained 1.2 percent to $1,472.90 an ounce, the
biggest advance for a most-active contract since Oct. 17.
Palladium futures for December delivery rose 0.3 percent to
$750.45 an ounce on the Nymex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
