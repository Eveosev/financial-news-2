Indian stock-index futures rose
before companies from Maruti Suzuki  India  Ltd. to Dabur India
Ltd. report earnings.  SGX CNX Nifty Index futures  for October delivery climbed
0.6 percent to 6,188.5 at 10:49 a.m. in  Singapore . The
underlying CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index fell 0.3 percent to 6,144.90 on Oct.
25. The S&P BSE Sensex declined 0.2 percent to 20,683.52. The
gauge lost 1 percent last week.  Profits at 12 of 13 Sensex companies that have reported
earnings so far this season have beaten or matched estimates,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. India’s central bank
will probably raise its benchmark interest rate tomorrow for the
second straight month, stepping up the fight against the fastest
consumer-price inflation in Asia, according to economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  “The first half of the earnings season has been good and
is supporting investor sentiment,” Vaibhav Sanghavi, a director
at Ambit Investment Advisors in Mumbai, said by e-mail.  Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL) , India’s biggest carmaker by
volume, may report second-quarter profit of 5.48 billion rupees,
according the median estimate of 43 analysts compiled by
Bloomberg. Dabur India, a household-products maker, is also
scheduled to release results today.  Hindustan Unilever Ltd., the Indian unit of the world’s
second-biggest consumer-goods company, may be active after
posting profit that beat analysts’ estimates on higher sales of
skin creams and cosmetics.  Rajan Rates  Net income rose 13 percent to 9.1 billion rupees ($148
million) in the three months to the end of September, the
company said in an Oct. 26 statement. Profit exceeded the 8.6
billion-rupee median of 34 analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan, who vowed to
quell price pressures when he took over at the central bank in
September, will boost the repurchase rate by 25 basis points to
7.75 percent, 20 of 24 analysts said in a Bloomberg News survey.
The majority in another Bloomberg poll said he’ll further ease
liquidity curbs that were imposed in July to support the rupee.  Global investors bought a net $162 million of  Indian (SENSEX)  stocks
on Oct. 24, a 15th day of purchases, data from the markets
regulator show. That took this year’s inflows to $15.5 billion,
the second highest after  Japan  among 10 Asian markets tracked by
Bloomberg.  The Sensex has risen 6.5 percent this year and is  valued  at
14 times estimated 12-month profits, compared with the MSCI
 Emerging Markets  Index’s 10.6 times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
