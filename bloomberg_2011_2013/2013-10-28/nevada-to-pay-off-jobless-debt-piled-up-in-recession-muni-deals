Nevada , whose 9.5 percent
 unemployment rate  is the nation’s highest, plans to sell $572
million in bonds this week to repay the federal government for
jobless benefits. It’s the state’s biggest sale since 2008.  The borrowing would pay down the $520 million Nevada owes
the U.S. for bolstering its unemployment fund after the longest
recession since the 1930s pushed the jobless  rate  to a record 14
percent in 2010. That debt peaked at $846 million in 2012.  Sixteen states and the Virgin Islands collectively owe the
federal government $21.3 billion for boosting jobless funds as
the national unemployment  rate  reached a 26-year high of 9.9
percent, Labor Department figures show. Nevada is the eighth-most indebted, with California leading at $9.5 billion.  “What we’ve seen over the last years is what we think is
more of a sustainable road to recovery,” Mark Mathers, senior
deputy state treasurer, said in an interview from Carson City,
Nevada.  States from  Michigan  to Illinois and  Pennsylvania  have
issued jobless debt in the last two years. The revenue bonds are
backed by assessments from employers. Nevada, with a population
of 2.8 million, has a taxable wage base of $23 billion to back
the bonds.  Top Grade  The securities, which will price tomorrow and mature in
five years, received the highest grade of Aaa from Moody’s
Investors Service, two steps above the state’s general-obligation rank.  Paying down the debt with the proceeds will save the state
about $24 million if current  interest rates  hold, Mathers said.
Five-year benchmark yields were at 1.4 percent as of Oct. 25,
the lowest since June 20, according to  data  compiled by
Bloomberg.  The offering is among $5.6 billion of long-term municipal
issues scheduled for this week, down from $7.8 billion last
week, which was the busiest since July.  Individuals pulled $746 million from muni-focused mutual
funds in the week through Oct. 23, according to Lipper US Fund
Flows data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
