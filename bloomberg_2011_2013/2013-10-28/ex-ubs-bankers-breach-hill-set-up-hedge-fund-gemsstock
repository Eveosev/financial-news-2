Al Breach, former  Russia  strategist
at  UBS AG (UBSN) , is setting up a hedge-fund firm with ex-colleague
Charles Hill and UFG Asset Management’s Florian Fenner.  Breach is combining with Hill, former head of trading at
UBS’s joint venture in Russia, and Fenner, managing partner at
Russia’s UFG for the past 11 years, according to filings made
this month at U.K.’s Companies House. Mayumi Yamaguchi, who
previously worked at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in sales before
being employed at several hedge-fund firms, is also listed as a
director, the filings show. The firm, Gemsstock Ltd., was
incorporated in September.  Breach declined to comment by phone from  Switzerland , where
he has run his own fund, Furka Advisors AG, since 2010. Fenner
said he “will remain principal at UFG Asset Management” as
well as a director of Gemsstock, according to e-mailed responses
to questions. Hill couldn’t be reached by phone.  Breach, 43, left Russia after quitting in 2007 as head of
research at UBS, where he was also a strategist and economist.
He joined what was then the UBS Brunswick joint venture in 2003
after four years as Russia economist at  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (G) 
He has since set up an Internet venture,  The Browser , and a fund
for family and friends, which is up 50 percent over the past
three years, according to his resume posted online.  To contact the reporters on this story:
