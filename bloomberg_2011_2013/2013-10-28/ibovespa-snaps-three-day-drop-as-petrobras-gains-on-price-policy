The Ibovespa gained for the first
time in four sessions as state-controlled  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) 
rallied after its chief executive officer said the company is
asking the government to raise domestic fuel prices.  Iron-ore producer  Vale SA (VALE5)  followed metals higher. Suzano Papel & Celulose SA rose after the pulp producer posted third-quarter earnings that exceeded analysts’ estimates.  The Ibovespa climbed 0.2 percent to 54,246.41 at 10:42 a.m.
in Sao Paulo, with 60 of its 73 member stocks rising. Petrobras,
as Petroleo Brasileiro is known, jumped 3.5 percent to 19.13
reais after saying it has asked for policy changes that would
allow prices in  Brazil  to more closely follow international
levels after third-quarter earnings trailed analyst estimates by
41 percent.  “Investors are thinking that, given how horrible
Petrobras’s third-quarter earnings were, an increase in fuel
prices is imminent,”  Pedro Galdi , head strategist at Sao Paulo-based brokerage SLW Corretora, said in a telephone interview.
“After three straight losses, the Ibovespa may now go back to a
more positive trend.”  The real was little changed at 2.1868 per dollar. The
Bloomberg Base Metals 3-Month Price Commodity Index rose 0.3
percent. Suzano added 1.2 percent to 9.02 reais. Vale climbed
0.6 percent to 32.45 reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
