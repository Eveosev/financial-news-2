Rubber swung between gains and
losses as optimism over improving demand from  China , the largest
user, weighed against increasing supply from producer countries.  The contract for delivery in March on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange traded at 256 yen a kilogram ($2,624 a metric ton) at
12:05 p.m. after climbing 1.6 percent and dropping 0.6 percent.  China’s economy  may grow about 7.5 percent as long as
macroeconomic policies remain stable, the People’s Daily
reported today, citing Pan Jiancheng, a deputy director of the
China Economic Monitoring and Analysis Center of the National
Bureau of Statistics. Global output will expand 4.5 percent next
year from an estimated 11.7 million tons in 2013 as plantings
between 2006 and 2008 become ready for tapping, according to
Lekshmi Nair, a senior economist at the International Rubber
Study Group.  “Prospects for stronger Chinese demand provided support to
the rubber market, while global supplies are still increasing,”
said Ryuta Imazeki, an analyst at Tokyo-based Okachi & Co.  China’s rubber industry urged the National Development and
Reform Commission to scrap a 20 percent tax on natural rubber
imports, the National Business Daily reported today.  Rubber for January delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange lost 0.6 percent to 19,295  yuan  ($3,172) a ton. Thai
rubber free-on-board was unchanged at 79.15 baht ($2.55) a
kilogram on Oct. 25, according to the Rubber Research Institute
of  Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
