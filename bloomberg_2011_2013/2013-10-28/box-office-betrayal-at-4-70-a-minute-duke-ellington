Pop music was a fine draw on
Broadway last week, as shows devoted to  Janis Joplin  and Harlem
jazz added good news to a down week at the box office.  After weeks of saturation advertising, the Mike Nichols-
directed revival of “Betrayal” with  Daniel Craig ,  Rachel Weisz 
and Rafe Spall opened to a wild range of reviews, from five
stars in Bloomberg to a withering pan from the New York Times.  The reviews are likely to have little impact on the show’s
limited run, which is all but sold out even with premium tickets
going for $423.00 (or $4.70 for each of the show’s 90 minutes).  The critics were mostly positive about the star of “A
Night With Janis Joplin,” at the Lyceum, sending it to a
respectable $433,141 -- just shy of 85 percent of its seats,
according to figures released Monday by the producers’ trade
group, the Broadway League.  In previews, “After Midnight,” a newcomer celebrating
Duke Ellington’s years at Harlem’s Cotton Cub, filled close to
93 percent of the seats at the Brooks Atkinson.  Another revival, “The Glass Menagerie,” had its best week
yet, selling $734,661 of tickets and leaving no seats to be had.  The addition of two new shows didn’t help the Broadway cash
register. Total receipts were $23,158,295, down $880,000 from
the week before, according to the league.  Off-Broadway  “Spider-Man, Turn Off the Dark” dropped $67,438 to
$789,538, the tenth consecutive week below its $1 million
running costs. “Big Fish,” the biggest new musical of the
season to date, fell $90,172 to $751,326 -- more evidence that
the show has an uphill battle to survive.  Same goes for John Grisham’s Broadway debut with the
adaptation of his courtroom thriller “A Time to Kill.” The
Rupert Holmes play opened to mediocre reviews and dropped $3,611
to $247,168, slightly more than  one-third of its potential.  Off-Broadway saw the much-lauded opening of John Kander and
Greg Pierce’s new musical, “The Landing” at the  Vineyard
Theatre .  Coming a day after another musical -- “Fun Home” at the
 Public  -- also had audiences scooping up tickets, the shows
served as a reminder that some of the most interesting work is
happening far below 42nd Street.  Muse highlights include  Greg Evans  on TV and Washington
 Scene .  To contact the writer of this column:
