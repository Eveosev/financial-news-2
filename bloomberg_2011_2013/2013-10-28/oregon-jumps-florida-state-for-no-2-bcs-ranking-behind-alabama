The University of Oregon jumped over
Florida State to take the No. 2 spot in college football’s Bowl
Championship Series standings behind top-ranked  Alabama .  Oregon improved its record to 8-0 two days ago by scoring
28 straight second-half points to pull away for a 42-14 victory
over then-No. 12 UCLA.  The win helped the Ducks move past Florida State, which is
7-0 after a 49-17 win over North Carolina State. The Seminoles
held the second spot in the first BCS standings of the season a
week ago thanks to their No. 1 ranking in the computer polls.  Florida State this week is collectively ranked third by the
six computer polls, which determine the BCS standings along with
the Harris Interactive Poll and the USA Today coaches’ poll.  Alabama, the two-time defending BCS national champion, is
8-0 after a 45-10 rout of Tennessee two days ago.  The Crimson Tide have a  .994 rating  out of 1.000 in the BCS
standings, which determine the two teams to play for the
national championship on Jan. 6 in  Pasadena ,  California . Oregon
is at .952, followed by Florida State at .921.  Ohio State (8-0) is fourth in the BCS rankings, with
Stanford (7-1), Baylor (7-0), Miami (7-0), Clemson (7-1),
Missouri (7-1) and Oklahoma (7-1) rounding out the top 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
