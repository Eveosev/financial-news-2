The cost of insuring corporate bonds
in  Japan  against non-payment dropped, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell 1.5 basis points to 86.5
basis points as of 9:28 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup
Inc. prices. The gauge, which has ranged from 85 basis points to
95.5 basis points this month, is set for its biggest daily drop
since Oct. 16, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan was little changed at 133 basis points
as of 8:27 a.m. in Hong Kong, Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. prices show. The gauge rose by 1 basis point last
week, snapping three straight weeks of decline, according to
CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices
quoted by dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index was also little changed
at 107 basis points as of 11:26 a.m. in Sydney, according to
Westpac Banking Corp. prices. The benchmark rose for the past
three trading days and is at a level unseen since Oct. 16,
according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
