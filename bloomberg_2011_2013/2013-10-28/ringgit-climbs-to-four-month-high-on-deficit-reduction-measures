Malaysia ’s ringgit rose to the
highest level since June and 10-year bond yields held at a
three-month low after Prime Minister Najib Razak announced a
goods and services tax to help cut the fiscal deficit.  The government plans to introduce a 6 percent GST rate in
April 2015 and is seeking to shrink the shortfall between
revenue and spending to 3.5 percent of gross domestic product
next year from 4 percent in 2013, Najib said in his annual
budget on Oct. 25. The economy will expand 5 percent to 5.5
percent in 2014 from an estimated 4.5 percent to 5 percent in
2013, according to the  finance ministry ’s economic report issued
the same day.  “The goods and services tax is being seen as a fiscally
responsible move and this will enhance the investment appeal of
Malaysia,” said Nick Verdi, a foreign-exchange strategist at
Barclays Plc in  Singapore . “The budget was taken pretty
favorably by markets.”  The ringgit rose 0.7 percent to 3.1355 per dollar in Kuala
Lumpur, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, the biggest
increase since Oct. 17. It earlier touched 3.1232, the strongest
level since June 17. The yield on the sovereign bonds due March
2023 held at 3.59 percent, the lowest level since July 8.  The government also cut subsidies on sugar last week after
raising fuel prices in September to rein in the deficit that’s
been running since 1998.  Fitch Ratings  lowered the outlook on
Malaysia’s A- ranking, the fourth-lowest investment grade, to
negative from stable in July, citing rising debt levels and a
lack of budgetary reform.  Current Account  Malaysia’s debt-to-GDP level may rise to 54.8 percent this
year from 53.3 percent in 2012, according to the finance
ministry’s report. Foreign holdings of the nation’s government
bonds climbed to 31 percent as of June from 11.4 percent at the
end of 2008, the report said.  “The measured action plans demonstrate the government’s
conviction to strengthen its fiscal health to avoid the risk of
ratings downgrades” and should help to ease concerns about the
nation’s financial position, Lee Heng Guie, an economist at CIMB
Group Holdings Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur, wrote in an Oct. 26
research note.  The government’s restatement of its commitment to lowering
the deficit and the introduction of GST are potentially
constructive steps, although execution is key, Fitch analyst
 Andrew Colquhoun  said in a statement today. The measures would
be credit positive if fully implemented, although structural
fiscal weaknesses and policy execution risks remain, Moody’s
Investors Service analyst Christian de Guzman wrote in a report
today.  ‘Bullish Outlook’  The current-account surplus may narrow to 26.6 billion
ringgit ($8.5 billion) this year from 57.3 billion ringgit in
2012, according to the finance ministry report.  One-month implied volatility in the ringgit, a measure of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, fell
42 basis points, or 0.42 percentage point, to 7.9 percent. The
cost to insure Malaysian government debt using five-year credit-default swaps was little changed at 108.8, the lowest level
since Oct. 17, CMA prices show. That’s down from 131.5 at the
end of last month.  The government will cap debt service charges at below 15
percent of revenue and total federal government debt within 55
percent of GDP to make sure its finances remain healthy, the
finance ministry said in its report.  The budget “will translate to a bullish outlook for the
ringgit,” Malayan Banking Bhd. analysts led by Saktiandi Supaat
in  Kuala Lumpur , wrote in an Oct. 25 research note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
