Volkswagen AG (VOW)  faces 162 lawsuits in
a German court by  MAN SE (MAN)  minority shareholders who want  Europe ’s
largest carmaker to pay more than what they’re offering for the
truckmaker.  The court won’t identify any of the plaintiffs at this
stage, Stefanie Ruhwinkel, a spokeswoman for the Munich Regional
Court, said in an interview today. The first two cases over the
price VW offered under the agreement for the deal were filed in
August.  “The court will allow the defendant to comment now on the
suits,” Ruhwinkel said. “This will take some time so we expect
that hearings will only take place next year.”  After VW won approval for the plan at a shareholder meeting
in June,  Ferdinand Piech , chairman of both companies, said he
expected a lengthy legal battle over the offer price. In a
related lawsuit, MAN provided investors with data about the
valuation of the company that might be used to force a price
increase in the new cases.  Volkswagen generally doesn’t comment on pending
proceedings, company spokesman Marco Dalan said in an interview.
The offer price was determined by two auditors and backed by a
court-appointed expert, he said.  VW, which is required under German law to offer to buy out
minority owners, proposed purchasing the truckmaker’s remaining
stock for 80.89 euros ($111.51) a share. Investors who don’t
accept the cash deal will receive an annual dividend of 3.07
euros per share.  The cases are LG Muenchen, 5 HKO 16371/13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
