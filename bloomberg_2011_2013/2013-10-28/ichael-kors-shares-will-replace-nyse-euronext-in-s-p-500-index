Michael Kors Holdings Ltd. (KORS) , the
luxury-goods company founded by the designer of the same name,
will replace  NYSE Euronext (NYX)  in the Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index,
S&P said in a statement today.  The change will take place after the close of trading on
Nov. 1, S&P said. The revisions in the benchmark equity index
may prompt money managers to shift holdings to match the index.
About $5.14 trillion was benchmarked to the S&P 500, according
to the S&P website.  NYSE Euronext, the biggest U.S. stock exchange owner, is
being acquired by Atlanta-based IntercontinentalExchange Inc. in
a deal valued at $10.3 billion. IntercontinentalExchange plans
to close the deal on Nov. 4, the company said earlier this
month. The 12-year-old energy and commodity futures bourse,
known as ICE, is buying the 220-year-old exchange operator as
the profitability of equities trading declines and derivatives
generate more income.  Michael Kors, based in Hong Kong, has a market
capitalization of $15.5 billion. Shares of both NYSE and Michael
Kors were little changed in trading after the close of U.S.
exchanges.  To contact the reporter on this story:
