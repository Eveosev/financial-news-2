The Senate Banking Committee plans
to hold a nomination hearing for Federal Reserve Chairman
candidate  Janet Yellen  on Nov. 14, according to a Senate aide.  Yellen, the current vice chairman of the Fed, was nominated
by President Barack Obama to succeed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ,
whose term ends Jan. 31. Yellen’s nomination must be approved by
the committee before it moves to the Senate floor. Democrats
control 12 of the committee’s 22 votes, enough to advance her
nomination without any Republican support.  Before her hearing, Yellen will meet with committee members
one-on-one, beginning this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
