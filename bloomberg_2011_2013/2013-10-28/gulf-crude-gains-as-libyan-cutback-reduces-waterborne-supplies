Heavy Louisiana Sweet oil
strengthened relative to West Texas Intermediate as Libyan crude
production fell, reducing supplies that compete with  Gulf of
Mexico  grades.  HLS’s premium over the U.S. benchmark widened by $1.10 to
$1.50 a barrel at 1:38 p.m., according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It’s the largest one-day gain since Oct. 18.  The state-run National Oil Corp. said crude output in  Libya 
declined to 250,000 barrels a day because of labor protests.
Brent, the European benchmark, strengthened to a $10.80-a-barrel
premium over WTI as 4:08 p.m. in  New York , the first time the
premium has widened in four days.  HLS and other Gulf crudes compete with foreign oils priced
against Brent for space in refineries in the U.S. Gulf Coast,
home to  45 percent  of the country’s processing capacity.  Light Louisiana Sweet crude strengthened by 70 cents to a
premium of $2.10 a barrel relative to WTI.  Thunder Horse , a
heavy, sweet crude, gained 30 cents to a premium of 75 cents.  Mars Blend, a medium, sour grade, strengthened by 30 cents
to a discount of $3.20 a barrel. Poseidon crude gained 15 cents
to a $3.85 discount. Crude from the Southern Green Canyon
narrowed its discount by 15 cents to $4.85 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
