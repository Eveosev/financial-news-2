The shekel weakened for a fourth day
on increased bets the  Bank of Israel  will lower borrowing costs
in coming months to boost economic growth and stem the rally in
this year’s best-performing major currency.  The  exchange rate  depreciated as much as 0.4 percent to
3.5421 a dollar and was trading at 3.5295 by 1:16 p.m. in Tel
Aviv, trimming this year’s gain to 5.8 percent, the most among
31 major peers tracked by Bloomberg.  One-year interest rate
swaps , an indicator of investor expectations for rates over the
period, fell 1 basis point to a 0.91 percent, below the current
base rate of 1 percent.  The Bank of  Israel , led by Karnit Flug, who was approved
yesterday as the new governor, will probably leave  interest
rates  unchanged at a meeting today, according to 23 of 24
analysts in a Bloomberg  survey , after a cut last month. Central
bank one-year  Makam bills , which are sensitive to expected
changes in rates, fell to 0.86 percent on Oct. 27 after Finance
Minister Yair Lapid said Oct. 24 the shekel was “too strong.”  “The comments made by Lapid increased expectations in the
market for measures to weaken the currency and boost growth
including another interest-rate cut in coming months,” Rony Gitlin, head of spot trading for Tel Aviv-based Bank Leumi Le-Israel, said by phone today. “The outlook is deterring some
investors, prompting them to buy dollars and sell shekels.”  The central bank reduced the key rate from 3.25 percent in
2011 and bought $835 million in September to curb the currency
and bolster the country’s export-driven economy. The bank
expects economic growth to slow to 3.4 percent this year from
3.6 percent this year.  Flug met with Lapid yesterday for their first working
session since her appointment on Oct. 20, the  Finance Ministry 
said in an e-mailed statement. Lapid said their talk underscored
the necessity for the two to cooperate to tackle the economy’s
challenges.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark bonds due March 2023
gained one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.56
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
