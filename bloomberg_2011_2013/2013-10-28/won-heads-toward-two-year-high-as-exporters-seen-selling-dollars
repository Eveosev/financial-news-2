South  Korea ’s won headed toward a
two-year high on speculation exporters are converting overseas
income to pay for month-end expenses. Sovereign bonds fell.  The government will strengthen efforts to limit the won’s
rise because its recent rally weakens the competitiveness of the
nation’s exports, Yonhap News cited an unidentified finance
ministry official as saying. The nation’s  consumer confidence 
rose to the highest level this month since May 2012 while
department store sales gained 2.8 percent from a year ago in
September, official data showed today.  “We expect exporters to sell dollars to cover month-end
expenses,” said Cho Young Bok, a currency trader at Daegu Bank
in  Seoul . “As the authorities have shown a firm stance on
curbing the won’s rise, investors are cautious about betting
aggressively on the currency.”  The won gained 0.1 percent to 1,061.23 per dollar as of
10:02 a.m. in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency reached 1,054.35 on Oct. 24, the highest level
since August 2011. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options,
climbed three basis points today to 6 percent.  Overseas investors have pumped some $12.8 billion into
South Korean stocks since Aug. 22 through Oct. 25, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The “unprecedented” level of
foreign inflows is unsustainable,  Jonathan Cavenagh , a
Singapore-based currency strategist at Westpac Banking Corp.
wrote in a research note today. A fairly aggressive intervention
stance from the Bank of Korea may weaken the currency, he added.
The currency has gained 4.8 percent in the past six months,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on South Korea’s 2.75 percent sovereign bonds due
June 2016 rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to
2.82 percent, according to Korea Exchange Inc. prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
