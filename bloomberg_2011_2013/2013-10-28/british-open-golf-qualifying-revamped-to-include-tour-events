British Open organizers have
overhauled the qualification process for golf’s oldest major
championship to make it tougher and ease a congested golfing
calendar.  The Royal & Ancient Golf Club, which governs the sport
outside the U.S. and  Mexico , is moving away from its 36-hole
qualifying events so that players can instead secure their
berths via 72-hole tournaments on the  PGA Tour , the European
Tour, the PGA Tour of Australasia, the Japan Golf Tour and the
Sunshine Tour.  “The new Open Qualifying Series will create an exciting
build-up to the Open as players bid to secure their places in
the weeks leading up to the championship,”  Peter Dawson , chief
executive of the R&A, said on the competition’s  website .  “We believe it will enhance the qualification process by
giving players the opportunity to qualify at 72-hole
championships as well as being more convenient in terms of their
scheduling,” he added.  As many as 32 players will qualify from the 14 Open
Qualifying Series tournaments, which begin with the Australian
Open at the end of next month and end with the John Deere
Classic next July.  A further 12 spots are available in final qualifying, held
at four 36-hole events in Scotland and  England .  Past champions, the top 50-ranked players in the world and
the top 30 on the money list on the U.S. and European tours will
be among 112 players exempt from qualification,  Next year’s Open will take place July 17-20 at the Royal
Liverpool Golf Club, Hoylake.  To contact the reporter on this story:
