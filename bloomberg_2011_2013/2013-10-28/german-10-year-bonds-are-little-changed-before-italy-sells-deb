Spanish bonds rose, pushing 10-year
yields to the lowest since May, before the nation makes interest
and repayments of about 21 billion euros ($28.9 billion) this
week and amid optimism the economy is gaining strength.  Spain ’s securities advanced for the first time in three
days as El Mundo newspaper said the government is predicting the
economy will grow as much as 1.5 percent next year, citing
internal state documents. Italy’s bonds also gained as borrowing
costs declined at an auction of zero-coupon debt. German bunds
were little changed before the country sells 4 billion euros of
10-year debt on Wednesday.  “Spanish bonds are supported by re-investment from the
cash flows,” said Soeren Moerch, head of fixed-income trading
at  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE)  in Copenhagen. “There are generally good
bids for peripherals. We are bullish on Spain as things seem to
have improved there on many fronts.” Peripheral refers to the
debt of the euro area’s lower-rated nations.  Spain’s 10-year yield fell seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 4.09 percent at 4:26 p.m.  London  time, the
lowest level since May 9. The 4.4 percent bond maturing in
October 2023 climbed 0.575, or 5.75 euros per 1,000-euro face
amount, to 102.51.  The nation will pay out 16.2 billion euros of a maturing
bond on Oct. 31 and 4.9 billion euros of interest, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Spanish Growth  El Mundo said the 1.5 percent growth rate cited in internal
government documents was double the official prediction. Spain’s
 gross domestic product  expanded 0.1 percent in the third quarter
after shrinking 0.1 percent in the previous three months,
according to a Bloomberg News survey before the data is released
on Oct. 30.  Italy’s Treasury sold 2.25 billion euros of a zero-coupon
notes maturing in June 2015 at 1.392 percent, the lowest since
May 28 and down from 1.623 percent at the previous auction of
similar-maturity debt on Sept. 25.  Investors bid for 1.78 times the amount offered, compared
with 1.77 times last month. Italy also sold 750 million euros of
inflation-linked bonds due in 2023 at a yield of 2.73 percent.  The Treasury returns to the market tomorrow with the sale
of as much as 8 billion euros of six-month bills, followed the
following day by an auction of five- and 10-year bonds.  Italy’s  10-year yield  fell three basis points to 4.19
percent after dropping to 4.09 percent on Oct. 23, the lowest
since June 5.  German Sale  Germany  last sold 10-year bunds on Oct. 2 at an average
yield of 1.79 percent, down from 2.06 percent on Sept. 11.  The benchmark 10-year bund yield fell one basis point to
1.75 percent after falling to 1.74 percent on Oct. 24, the least
since Aug. 13.  “The market might be preparing some room for new supply,
but the impact should be limited,” said  Peter Chatwell , a
fixed-income strategist at Credit Agricole Corporate &
Investment Bank in London. “German bonds will be underpinned by
month-end index-extension demand.”  Volatility on Austrian bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today, followed by those of Finland and Spain, according
to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between two- and
10-year securities and credit-default swaps.  Belgium  sold 1.08 billion euros of 10-year bonds at a yield
of 2.493 percent, compared with 2.731 percent at the previous
auction of the maturity on Aug. 27. It also sold debt due in
March 2018 and September 2019.  Finland will auction as much as 1.5 billion euros of debt
due in 2018 and 2042 tomorrow.  Spanish securities returned 10 percent this year through
Oct. 25, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Italy’s
gained 6 percent, while Germany’s fell 1.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
