Natural gas futures in  New York 
slumped the most in almost five months as meteorologists
predicted milder weather that would limit heating fuel demand.  Gas tumbled 3.7 percent, the biggest drop since June 6. MDA
Weather Services said temperatures would be average or above in
most of the Northeast and Midwest through Nov. 11. Last week’s
forecasts were for colder-than-usual weather in the central U.S.
A gas  surplus  to the five-year average widened to 2.1 percent
from 1.6 percent in the seven days ended Oct. 18 from a week
earlier, government data showed.  “We have mild weather out on the horizon and heating
demand is waning,” said Tom Saal, senior vice president of
energy trading at FCStone Latin America LLC in Miami. “The
market is putting an ample amount of gas in storage for this
time of year.”  Natural gas for November delivery fell 13.8 cents to $3.569
per million British thermal units on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the lowest settlement since Oct. 4. Trading volume was
1.2 percent below the average at 2:47 p.m. Prices have climbed
6.5 percent this year.  The discount of November to December futures narrowed 1.3
cents to 9.2 cents. November gas traded 17 cents  below  the
January contract, compared with 17.9 cents on Oct. 25.  Active Options  November gas options expire today. November $3.60 calls
were the most active options in electronic trading. They were
11.5 cents lower at 0.2 cent per million Btu on volume of 2,000
at 3:02 p.m. Calls accounted for 55 percent of trading volume.
Implied volatility for December at-the-money options was 30.59
percent, compared with 31.19 percent on Oct. 25.  The low in  Chicago  on Nov. 5 may be 40 degrees Fahrenheit
(4 Celsius), compared with an average of 39, according to
 AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College ,  Pennsylvania . About 49
percent of U.S. households use gas for heating, data from the
Energy Information Administration, the Energy Department’s
statistical arm, show.  “The far end of the 14-day forecasts now show a warmer-than-normal start to November, which indicates short-term
weakness ahead,” Soozhana Choi, a strategist at Deutsche Bank
AG in  Washington , said in a note to clients today.  Gas stockpiles totaled 3.741 trillion cubic feet in the
week ended Oct. 18, the EIA reported. Supplies were 2.4 percent
below year-earlier inventories, compared with 3.1 percent in the
prior period.  Gas Output  The Marcellus shale formation is driving gas production
growth in the U.S., the EIA said Oct. 22 in the first edition of
its  Drilling Productivity Report.  Output from the region may
increase by 408 million cubic feet per day, or 3.3 percent, to
12.6 billion from October to November, according to the report.  Marketed gas production may climb 1.2 percent this year to
a record 70 billion cubic feet a day, the EIA said Oct. 8 in its
monthly Short-Term Energy Outlook. The U.S. met 87 percent of
its own energy needs in the first six months of 2013, on pace to
be the highest annual rate since 1986, the EIA said.  The number of rigs drilling for natural gas in the U.S.
rose by four to 376, data released Oct. 25 by Baker Hughes Inc.
in Houston showed. The total is down 13 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
