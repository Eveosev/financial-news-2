BRF SA (BRFS3) ,  Brazil ’s largest food
company, fell the most in seven months as profit missed
analysts’ estimates for a second straight quarter.  The  shares  dropped 3.8 percent to 53.01 reais at the close
of trading in Sao Paulo, the biggest decline since March 11. The
Ibovespa equity benchmark  gained  1.7 percent.  While BRF’s adjusted net income tripled to 287 million
reais ($131 million) in the three months through September from
a year earlier, it trailed the average estimate of 362 million
reais among 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Third-quarter results exert downward pressure on our
estimates for 2013, and short-term results might continue to
suffer because of cautious consumers in the domestic market,”
Giovana Araujo and Antonio Barreto, analysts at the investment
bank Itau BBA, wrote in a research note to clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
