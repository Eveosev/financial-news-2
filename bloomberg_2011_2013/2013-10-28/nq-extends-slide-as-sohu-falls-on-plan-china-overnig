Chinese equities sank in  New York  as
 NQ Mobile Inc. (NQ)  extended its three-day plunge to 62 percent after
 Muddy Waters LLC  accused it of fabricating revenue, while
 Sohu.com Inc. (SOHU)  tumbled on plans to boost marketing expenses.  The Bloomberg China-US Index of the most traded Chinese
stocks in the U.S. dropped 1.2 percent to a seven-week low of
100.87 yesterday. NQ sank 17 percent to a three-month low while
Sohu retreated the most in five years.  Phoenix New Media (FENG)  Ltd.
slumped 15 percent while Suntech Power Holdings Co. led declines
among solar manufacturers.  NQ Mobile fell the most on record last week after Muddy
Waters said the company inflated revenue and lied about cash
balances in an Oct. 24 report. NQ denied the allegations,
holding a two-hour conference call on Oct. 25 to discuss details
of its financial statements. In an earnings call yesterday, Sohu
said its games unit  Changyou.com Ltd. (CYOU)  will “significantly ramp
up” marketing expenses this quarter to expand its user base.  “Sohu’s game revenue growth is declining as users are
leaving desktop computers to mobile devices, which forced the
company to increase marketing spending,” Tian X. Hou, the
founder of T. H. Capital LLC, said in a telephone interview from
Beijing. “Its video business will continue burning money on
content acquisition and market share in the fourth quarter.”  The iShares  China  Large-Cap  ETF (FXI) , the largest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., climbed 0.3 percent to $36.55
in New York. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.1 percent
as weaker-than-forecast data on factory output and housing
fueled bets the  Federal Reserve  will maintain stimulus at its
policy meeting.  Marketing Expenses  Sohu tumbled 16 percent to $68.11, sinking the most since
November 2008. Trading volume was 4.6 times the three-month
average compiled by Bloomberg. American depositary receipts of
Changyou plunged 20 percent to $28.50, slumping the most since
its U.S. listing in April 2009.  Beijing-based Sohu will increase marketing spending on its
Changyou unit by $53 million in the final three months to expand
the user base of its online games, Chief Executive Officer
Charles Zhang said on a conference call yesterday.  Sohu reported net loss of $65 million for the third quarter
because of a special dividend paid to certain shareholders of
its Sogou search engine business, the company said in a
statement yesterday. Operating profit fell 18 percent to $52
million, compared with the average $56 million estimate of nine
analysts compiled by Bloomberg. Sohu forecast fourth-quarter
revenue of as much as $390 million, compared with $375.9 million
average of seven analyst projections.  Total Downloads  NQ Mobile’s American depositary receipts sank to $8.80, the
lowest level since July 3. Trading volume was 8.2 times the 90-day average compiled by Bloomberg.  NQ Mobile may have 1.15 percent share of total downloads of
mobile security software in China, T.H. Capital wrote in a note
yesterday, citing its data. The company may have 13 million
downloads out of a total 1.1 billion in the industry, according
to the report.  Muddy Waters  said in the Oct. 24 note NQ Mobile’s
market share in China is about 1.5 percent, versus the
approximate 55 percent it reported.  “So far responses from NQ haven’t been convincing enough
and there are still many questions raised by Muddy Waters that
need to be answered,” Henry Guo, an analyst at ABR Investment
Strategy LLC in  San Francisco , said by phone yesterday.  Phoenix New Media, a TV and Internet news outlet based in
Beijing, slid to $9.06 in New York, slumping the most since
August 2011. Thirty-day volatility on its ADRs surged to 86
yesterday, compared with a six-month average of 58, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Solars Drop  NetEase Inc. (NTES) , a web games developer based in Beijing,
slumped 10 percent to $65.36, losing the most since August 2012.
The company is scheduled to report third-quarter results on Nov.
13 after U.S. markets close.  Suntech Power Holdings Co., which China unit was forced
into bankruptcy in March, lost 9.6 percent to $1.22 in a fourth
day of declines.  Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL)  sank 8 percent to $14.81, the
largest retreat since Aug. 7.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  was little changed at 2,133.87
yesterday, after sinking 2.8 percent last week. The Hang Seng
China Enterprises Index in  Hong Kong  advanced 0.8 percent
yesterday to 10,258.42, following a 4.4 percent drop last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
