Brazil ’s real climbed to a one-week
high as the central bank prepared to hold the first of three
auctions this week to extend maturities on foreign-exchange
swaps that supported the world’s biggest two-month rally.  The real advanced 0.2 percent to 2.1833 per dollar at 10
a.m. in Sao Paulo, the strongest level on a closing basis since
Oct. 22. Swap rates on the contract due in January 2017 fell
four basis points, or 0.04 percentage points, to 11.24 percent,
the lowest level since Oct. 11.  Policy makers said in a statement last week that they plan
to offer foreign-exchange swaps in rollover auctions over three
days beginning today. The real posted its first weekly decline
this month after the central bank extended the maturities in
sales Oct. 22-24 on only about one-third of the $8.9 billion of
swap contracts maturing Nov. 1.  “The central bank is using currency swaps to manage the
market,” Jose Carlos Amado, a currency trader at Renascenca
Corretora in  Sao Paulo , said in a telephone interview. “People
are getting used to this situation. Whenever the dollar gets
close to 2.15 reais, people buy it, and when it rises to 2.20
reais, they sell.”  The currency has gained 12 percent since Aug. 22, when
policy makers announced a $60 billion program of swaps and
credit lines to buoy the currency and curb import price
increases. The rally also makes the country’s factories less
competitive by boosting export prices.  To contact the reporters on this story:
