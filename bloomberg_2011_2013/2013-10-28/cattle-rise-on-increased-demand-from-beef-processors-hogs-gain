Cattle futures rose for the third
straight session, the longest rally in two weeks, on signs that
improved demand from U.S. beef processors is tightening supplies
of the animals. Hog prices also advanced.  Meatpackers processed 618,000 cattle in the week ended Oct.
26, up 0.2 percent from a week earlier, U.S. Department of
Agriculture data show. Wholesale-beef  prices  are up 9.2 percent
since the end of July, and cattle futures last week touched a
nine-month high. The U.S. herd as of Jan. 1 was the smallest for
that date since 1952 after last year’s drought destroyed
pastures and forced ranchers to send animals to slaughter sooner
than normal, according to the USDA.  “Meatpackers still want to buy cattle,” even after the
rally in prices,  Lane Broadbent , the president of KIS Futures
Inc., said in a telephone interview from Oklahoma City. “Long-term, this supply issue is not going to get any better.”  Cattle futures for December delivery gained 0.5 percent to
$1.33625 a pound at 11:21 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, heading for the longest rally since Oct. 14. Prices
are up 11 percent since the end of May, and on Oct. 25 touched
$1.347, the highest for a most-active contract since Jan. 15.
Feeder-cattle futures for January settlement rose 0.4 percent to
$1.6665 a pound.  Beef exports climbed 3.3 percent to 1.69 billion pounds
(767,777 metric tons) in the eight months through Aug. 31,
compared with the same period a year earlier, according to the
USDA. Wholesale beef fetched $2.0341 today, the highest since
June 6, government data show.  Hog futures for December settlement advanced 0.7 percent to
91.05 cents a pound on the CME. The most-active contract
increased 2.8 percent last week and is up 5 percent this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
