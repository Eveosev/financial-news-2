General Electric Co. (GE) , the largest
U.S. producer of wind turbines, agreed to supply 22.8 megawatts
of systems to Toto Costruzioni SpA for a power plant in southern
Italy.  The order is the first for the company’s 2.85-megawatt
turbines in Italy, according to a statement today on Fairfield,
Connecticut-based GE’s  website . Terms weren’t disclosed. Italy
plans to install 560 megawatts of wind power a year through 2020
to meet the European Union’s goal of generating 20 percent of
its electricity from renewable sources.  The project in Italy’s Puglia region will generate enough
power for about 15,000 homes, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
