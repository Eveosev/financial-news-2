Senegal ’s economy will expand 6
percent a year through 2017, helping the West African nation
narrow its  budget deficit , Prime Minister Aminata Toure said.  “Senegal is committed to set its average growth rate to 6
percent,” Toure told the national assembly in the capital,
Dakar, today. She was appointed Sept. 1.  The government wants to improve the business climate for
private investors by simplifying customs procedures before the
end of the year, she said. Senegal fell four spots this year to
166 out of 185 nations in the  World Bank ’s Doing Business
 report , which ranks countries on how easy it is for a company to
operate there.  “By 2015, reforms will be completed in order to improve
Senegal’s score at Doing Business and create a more favorable
environment for the private sector,” she said.  Gross domestic product is set to expand 4 percent this
year, Finance Minister Amadou Ba said last month. Efforts
undertaken to consolidate public finances enabled growth to
recover to 3.5% in 2012 from 2.1% in 2011, she said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
