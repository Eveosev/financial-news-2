Dendreon Corp. (DNDN) , the maker of the
prostate-cancer drug Provenge, gained the most in nine months
after Bloomberg News reported the company is seeking a buyer.  Dendreon jumped 13 percent to $2.85 at 9:44 a.m. New York
time after reaching $3.02 in its biggest intraday increase since
Jan. 11. The shares of the Seattle-based company had fallen 52
percent this year through Oct. 25.  Dendreon is working with  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  to find
suitors, according to a person familiar with the matter,
Bloomberg News reported Oct. 25. The company, whose market value
once topped $7 billion, has failed to meet expectations for
sales of Provenge, and its market capitalization hovered at
about $400 million before the report.  “We view this as both plausible and sensible, as the
company seeks a way out of the $647 million convertible debt
noose tied around its neck,” Lee Kalowski, an analyst with
 Credit Suisse (CSGN) , wrote in an Oct. 27 research note. “But Dendreon
is facing notable commercial and financial struggles and we
don’t foresee a big bidding war.”  Dendreon said in early August that sales of Provenge, its
sole marketed product, wouldn’t increase this year as forecast.
When the treatment won approval in 2010, analysts projected the
drug could generate $4.3 billion in sales by 2020. Today the
estimate for that period has shrunk to $476.5 million.  Dendreon, led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Johnson, has burned through money for at least six straight
quarters. Cash and short-term investments had dropped to $207.4
million as of June from $538.6 million at the end of 2011.  Andy Brimmer, a spokesman for Dendreon with Joele Frank
Wilkinson Brimmer Katcher, on Oct. 25 declined to comment on any
sale process. A JPMorgan spokeswoman also declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
