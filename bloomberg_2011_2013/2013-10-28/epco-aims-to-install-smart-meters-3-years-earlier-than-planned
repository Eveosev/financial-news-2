Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501) ,  Japan â€™s
largest power utility, plans to install smart meters for all
customers in its service area three years earlier than planned.  The Tokyo-based company intends to install about 27 million
smart meters for customers, mainly for residential use, it said
in a  statement  today. Installations will begin in the first half
of fiscal 2014 and will be completed by March 2021.  Services using smart meters will be rolled out in July 2015
to enable remote metering and to provide users with detailed
data on power use, according to the statement.  Tepco plans an auction next month to pick suppliers of
about 1.14 million smart meters for fiscal 2014, it said on its
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
