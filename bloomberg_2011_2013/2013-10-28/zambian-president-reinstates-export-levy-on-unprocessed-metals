Zambia, Africa’s biggest copper
producer, will restore a 10 percent export tax for unprocessed
metals less than a month after the government removed the levy.  President  Michael Sata  ordered the government yesterday to
repeal the law that removed the tax in comments broadcast on
state-owned ZNBC. Treasury Secretary Fredson Yamba confirmed the
decision early by phone.  “In 49 years of independence, you are exporting soil,”
Sata said. “If not for the forefathers who died on the mines in
the 1943 mines strikes, you would not be where you are today.”  Finance Minister Alexander Chikwanda halted export taxes on
Oct. 4 for unprocessed metals including copper, nickel, zinc,
lead, silver and uranium, after mining companies complained
Zambia lacked smelting capacity. African Rainbow Minerals Ltd.,
 First Quantum Minerals Ltd. (FM)  and  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX)  have
operations in the country.  The Chamber of Mines of  Zambia  is “extremely concerned”
about recent policies targeting the industry, President Emmanuel Mutati said in an e-mailed statement on Oct. 23.  “If not urgently addressed, the combined effect of the
measures threatens the viability of the mining sector and makes
it extremely vulnerable to collapse in the current volatile
commodity cycle,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
