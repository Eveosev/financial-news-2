Denmark ’s central bank will cut its
workforce by about 10 percent as the need for extra resources
created by the financial crisis fades.  The Copenhagen-based central bank will cut 55 positions
through the first quarter of 2015, it said in a statement on its
website today.  “The extraordinary strain on the central bank’s resources
that came with the financial crisis is diminishing,” the bank
said in a statement. As a consequence, “the central bank has
been able to reduce its resources,” it said.  Denmark, which uses monetary policy to defend the krone’s
peg to the euro, extended its lending facilities during the
crisis, easing collateral requirements and giving banks access
to three-year credit at its benchmark rate. GovernorLars Rohde
cut the bank’s lending rate to 0.2 percent in May, matching a
record low.  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE) , the largest Danish lender, saw profit rise
46 percent in the second quarter to a five-year high, after loan
losses shrank. Shares in the bank have jumped 31 percent this
year, while credit-default swaps have eased. Five-year default
swaps on Danske’s senior unsecured bonds traded at 90 basis
points this week, from 178 a year ago, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The central bank is also cutting staff as new technology
systems reduce the need for employees, it said. Most of the job
cuts will be frontloaded, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
