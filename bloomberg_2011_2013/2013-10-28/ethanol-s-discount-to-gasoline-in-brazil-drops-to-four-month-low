Ethanol’s discount to gasoline in
 Brazil , the world’s second-largest producer of the biofuel after
the U.S., dropped to the lowest since June after rain delayed
harvesting and millers slowed sales.  The discount narrowed to $1.63 a gallon in October through
the 26th, according to information on the Rio de Janeiro-based
 ANP  oil regulator’s website. The average price for gasoline was
2.83 reais a liter ($4.92 a gallon) and ethanol was 1.91 reais.  “Rains have slowed harvest and millers are holding more
ethanol than usual, betting on a gasoline price increase,”
Renato Dias, an analyst at Intl FCStone in Campinas, Brazil,
said in a telephone interview.  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , the state-controlled  oil company ,
is asking the government for authorization to raise local fuel
prices in a bid to curb import losses. The Brazilian government,
which controls the company’s board, caps the price of gasoline
at the refinery as part of a policy to keep inflation in check.  Ethanol consumption in  Latin America ’s largest economy
jumped to a two-year high in August amid a record sugarcane crop
that spurred output of the biofuel, data on ANP’s website show.  About 57 percent of passenger cars in Brazil are
flexfueled, allowing ethanol to compete with gasoline on the
basis of price. The remainder of the fleet runs on pure ethanol
or on E25,  a mix of gasoline and 25 percent of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
