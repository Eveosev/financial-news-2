Fighting between  Mozambique ’s army
and militia loyal to the opposition Mozambique National
Resistance Army, or Renamo, has led to 58 deaths, a military
official said.  The clash at Maringue in central Mozambique resulted in the
deaths of 17 soldiers and 41 members of the militia, the
official said, asking not to be named because the death toll
hasn’t been released. The government wasn’t aware of any
casualties, Manuel Mazuze, deputy national director for defense
policy, said at an earlier press conference in Maputo, the
capital, yesterday.  “I confirm there were clashes today but no victims to
report, at least on our side,” he said.  Renamo, once backed by the white-minority governments of
Rhodesia, which is now Zimbabwe, and  South Africa , fought a 17-year civil war against the Front for the Liberation of
Mozambique, or Frelimo, until signing a peace agreement in  Rome 
in 1992. It has served as the main opposition party for two
decades. The clashes are the worst since the signing of the
peace agreement.  The army attacked Renamo’s main base on Oct. 21 after a
series of attacks on public transport and a government arms
depot this year led to the temporary closure of rail lines used
by  Rio Tinto Plc (RIO)  and  Vale SA (VALE5)  to export coal. Renamo said the
1992 peace agreement was over following the attack on its base.  “We will no longer show off numbers as in no case does it
make us proud,” Fernando Mazanga, a spokesman for Renamo, said
when asked about the casualties. He confirmed the clashes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
