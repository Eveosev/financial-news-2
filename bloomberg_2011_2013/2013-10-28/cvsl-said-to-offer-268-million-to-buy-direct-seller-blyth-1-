CVSL Inc., a direct-selling company
run by Mary Kay Inc.’s former chairman, has offered to buy Blyth
Inc. for about $268 million, two people with knowledge of the
matter said.  CVSL offered to pay $16.75 a share for Blyth, which sells
candles, fragrances and ViSalus weight-loss products, said the
people, who asked not to be identified because the information
is private. The offer, which was extended last week in a letter
to Blyth, could be made public by CVSL as soon as today, one of
the people said. Blyth rose 21 percent to close at  $15.50 (BTH) 
yesterday, giving it a market value of $248.2 million.  CVSL is run by John Rochon, who was chairman of Mary Kay --
the cosmetics seller known for giving pink Cadillacs to top
sales representatives -- until 2001. Last year he took over
 Computer Vision Systems Laboratories Corp. (CVSL)  to create a new
direct-selling company. The Plano, Texas-based company’s other
acquisitions this year include Tomboy Tools Inc. and Agel
Enterprises LLC, which makes nutritional and skin-care products.  Jane F. Casey, Blyth’s vice president of  investor
relations , didn’t return calls seeking comment on the offer.
John Rochon Jr., chairman of CVSL’s investment committee,
declined to comment.  Blyth, based in Greenwich,  Connecticut , reported revenue of
$211.7 million for the second quarter, down from $309.5 million
a year earlier, because of slumping sales of ViSalus, and the
company cut its full-year earnings outlook in August. Ahead of
yesterday’s gains, the shares had fallen 18 percent this year.  Rochon, 62, oversaw a sixfold increase in revenue at Mary
Kay from the time he led its leveraged buyout in 1985 to about
$3 billion when he left in 2001. As the founder and chairman of
Dallas-based Richmont Holdings Inc., he also mounted takeover
attempts for competitor  Avon Products Inc. (AVP)  in the late 1980s and
early 1990s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
