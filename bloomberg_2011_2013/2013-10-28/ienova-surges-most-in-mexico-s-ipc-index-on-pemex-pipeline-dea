Infraestructura Energetica Nova SAB,
the Mexican unit of natural-gas utility  Sempra Energy (SRE) , led gains
in the country’s benchmark IPC index after winning a pipeline
contract from the government-controlled energy company.  Ienova, as the Mexico-City based company is known,  jumped 
4.4 percent to 50.43 pesos as of 11:59 a.m. local time, the most
since Aug. 2. It has rallied 48 percent since its initial public
offering in March. The stock was the  best performer  among the 35
members of the IPC index, which climbed 0.6 percent.  Petroleos Mexicanos , or Pemex as the government’s oil and
gas producer is also known,  said Oct. 25  that it would build a
441-kilometer pipeline stretch in partnership with Ienova. The
project will have an initial investment of $1.05 billion,
according to a Pemex statement. The pipeline will run south from
the northern Mexican state of Nuevo Leon to San Luis Potosi.  The deal could raise Ienova’s share price by as much as 9
pesos, with a target price of 55 pesos in 12 months, according
to a Credit Suisse Group AG report today. Ienova may have a
stake of 25 percent to 50 percent in the project, Credit Suisse
analyst  Vanessa Quiroga  wrote in the report.  Ienova is scheduled to  report  third-quarter earnings at 5
p.m. Mexico City time today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
