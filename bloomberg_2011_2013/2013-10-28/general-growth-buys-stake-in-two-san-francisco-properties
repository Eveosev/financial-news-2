General Growth Properties Inc. (GGP) , the
second-biggest U.S. mall owner, bought stakes in two San
Francisco buildings as it adds urban stores to its holdings.  The company acquired a 50 percent interest in the two
properties, an  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  flagship store at 1 Stockton St. and a
Bulgari store at 1  Union Square , the Chicago-based company said
today in a statement. The Union Square portfolio has 58,703
square feet (5,453 square meters) of space, according to a
quarterly supplemental report.  General Growth, which owns 123 regional malls across the
U.S., has been expanding into urban markets, and last month
agreed to buy 200 Lafayette St. in  Manhattan ’s Soho neighborhood
for $150 million. It plans to convert much of the 116,000-square-foot property into retail space, according to a
presentation to investors. The building is now 100 percent
leased to J.C. Penney & Co.  “In the case of urban retail, we are focused on flagship
locations that are complementary to the mall business, and of
the highest quality,” General Growth Chief Executive Officer
Sandeep Mathrani said on a conference call with analysts in
July. “There are only a handful of locations within the U.S.
that have such packages.”  General Growth is buying the interest in the two buildings
for about $82 million, according to the supplemental report
filed with regulators.  Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG) , based in Indianapolis, is the
largest U.S. mall owner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
