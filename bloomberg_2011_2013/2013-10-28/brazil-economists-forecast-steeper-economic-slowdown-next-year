Brazil economists cut their 2014
economic growth forecast to the lowest all year, as inflation
pressured by a weaker real saps purchasing power in the world’s
second-biggest emerging market.  Brazil’s gross domestic product will expand 2.13 percent
next year, compared with the previous week’s forecast of 2.20
percent, according to the Oct. 25 central bank survey of about
100 analysts published today. Economists maintained their 2013
growth forecast from the previous week at 2.50 percent.  President  Dilma Rousseff ’s administration is seeking to
rein in consumer price increases while sparking economic growth
that has trailed economists’ estimates in five of the last six
quarters. Near-record low unemployment and government stimulus
have been undercut by flagging  confidence  and inflation running
above target for the third straight year. Central bankers on
Oct. 9 raised the benchmark rate by 50 basis points to 9.50
percent and later signaled in the meeting minutes that they will
extend world’s biggest tightening cycle.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2015, the most
traded in  Sao Paulo  today, fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 10.46 percent at 9:02 local time. The real
strengthened by 0.22 percent to 2.1823 per  U.S. dollar , and has
weakened 6 percent this year.  Above Target  Brazilian consumer prices in mid-October accelerated for
the third straight  month , even as annual inflation slowed to
5.75 percent, the lowest since November. Inflation has remained
above the central bank’s 4.5 percent target every month since
August, 2010.  The bank has raised the benchmark Selic by 50 basis points
in the past four monetary policy meetings following a 25-point
boost in April. In a statement published after their Oct. 9
monetary policy meeting, central bankers said the decision will
help stem inflation.  Economists in the central bank survey forecast inflation
will accelerate to 5.92 percent in 2014 from 5.83 percent this
year, compared with last week’s estimates of 5.94 percent and
5.83 percent, respectively.  Total  economic activity  in August rose 0.08 percent,
compared with analysts’ estimates of 0.2 percent growth, the
central bank said on Oct. 16. While retail sales that month
surpassed economists’ estimates, industrial output unexpectedly
was flat.  The central bank expects gross domestic product to expand
2.5 percent this year.  Brazil ’s economy grew by 0.9 percent last
year and 2.7 percent in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
