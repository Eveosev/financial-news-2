Renewable Energy Generation Ltd. (WIND) , a
developer of low-carbon assets backed by  BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , plans
to build a 5 million-pound ($8 million) solar park in southwest
England with Juwi Renewable Energies Ltd.  The project will be located next to the company’s Goonhilly
Downs wind farm in Cornwall and have 4.5 megawatts of capacity,
Guildford, Surrey-based Renewable Energy, said in a statement
today. It will be the company’s first ground-mounted solar farm
and is expected to begin working in the first-quarter.  “We’ve been looking into the merits of leveraging our
existing grid connections for some time,” Chief Executive
Officer Andrew Whalley said in the statement. The company said
this month it may spend as much as 300 million pounds on onshore
wind, solar and bioenergy in the next three to four years.  Renewable Energy  seeks to exploit demand for green power in
the U.K. The country seeks to get 15 percent of its energy from
clean sources by 2020, from about 9.4 percent now. BlackRock in
January bought wind farms from Renewable Energy and agreed on a
five-year partnership to buy more plants from the developer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
