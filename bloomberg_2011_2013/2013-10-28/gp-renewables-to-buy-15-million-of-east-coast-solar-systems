GP Renewables & Trading LLC , a New
York-based energy-services company, plans to purchase as much as
$15 million in commercial solar projects in  New Jersey  and
 Maryland  before a federal tax incentive expires at the end of
the year.  GP Renewables will acquire solar systems from businesses
and municipalities, Gabe Phillips, chief executive officer of
the closely held company, said today in an interview. The
sellers will buy electricity from GP under 10- to 20-year
agreements, according to a statement.  Owners of rooftop solar projects may apply to earn
incentives, known as solar renewable energy credits, that they
sell to utilities. Increased solar installations drove down the
price of the credits, prompting owners of some commercial
projects to consider selling their systems, Phillips said.  “We’re offering liquidity to people who want it,”
Phillips said today in an interview. “In most instances, the
end user is able to get out either flat or with a moderate
gain” on a per-watt basis, including system costs, SRECs and
other incentives.  GP Renewables has evaluated systems ranging in size from
109 kilowatts to 3.3 megawatts, Phillips said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
