Zambia , Africa’s biggest copper
producer, will restore a 10 percent export tax for unprocessed
metals less than a month after the government removed the levy.  President Michael Sata ordered the government to repeal the
law that removed the tax, Fredson Yamba, the treasury secretary,
said today by mobile phone from Lusaka, the capital. The law had
abolished the tax for about a year.  The reinstatement will be effective “when the finance
minister signs it,” Yamba said.  Finance Minister Alexander Chikwanda halted export taxes on
Oct. 4 for unprocessed metals including copper, nickel, zinc,
lead, silver and uranium, after mining companies complained
Zambia lacked smelting capacity.  African Rainbow Minerals Ltd. (ARI) ,
 First Quantum Minerals Ltd. (FM)  and  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX)  have
operations in the country.  The Chamber of Mines of Zambia is “extremely concerned”
about recent policies targeting the industry, President Emmanuel Mutati said in an e-mailed statement on Oct. 23.  “If not urgently addressed, the combined effect of the
measures threatens the viability of the mining sector and makes
it extremely vulnerable to collapse in the current volatile
commodity cycle,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
