The Treasury sold $32 billion of
two-year notes at the highest demand since April, less than two
weeks after a partial government shutdown raised concern of a
U.S. default.  The notes were sold at a yield of 0.323 percent, the lowest
level at an auction of the security since May. The  bid-to-cover 
ratio, which gauges demand by comparing total bids with the
amount of securities offered, was 3.32, compared with an average
of 3.3 for the past 10 sales and the highest since April.
Federal Reserve policy makers begin a two-day meeting tomorrow
amid forecasts they will refrain from cutting stimulus.  “It’s an indication that Treasury debt is still of
interest, particularly at this part of the curve,” said
 Christopher Sullivan , who oversees $2.2 billion as chief
investment officer at United Nations Federal Credit Union in  New
York . “It is representative still of uncertainty over the
direction of the economy in general, and Fed monetary policy and
the uncertainty ahead, the political issues that we still
face.”  The  yield  on the current two-year note maturing in
September 2015 was steady at 0.303 percent, as of 5 p.m. in New
York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader Prices. The price of
the 0.25 percent security was little changed at 99 28/32,.  The  yield  on the benchmark 10-year  note  rose one basis
point to 2.52 percent, Bloomberg Bond Trader data showed. The
price of the 2.5 percent note due in August 2023 fell 1/8, or
$1.25 per $1,000 face amount, to 99 25/32.  The seven-day  relative strength  index for the Treasury 10-year note yield rose to 35 from 29.9 on Oct. 25, according to
Bloomberg data. A reading lower than 30 or above 70 suggests the
security may be poised for a change in direction.  Volatility Falls  Treasury trading volume at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , was at $204 billion,
below the 2013 average of $314 billion. Volume reached a 2013
high of $662 billion on May 22 and a low of $147.8 billion on
Aug. 9.  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the MOVE index
dropped to 58.54, the lowest level since May. It climbed on
Sept. 5 to 114.2, the highest level in two months. It touched a
record low 49 on May 9.  The bid-to-cover was 3.09 on the Sept. 24 auction of two-year notes, the last sale of the securities before the 16-day
partial government shutdown that began on Oct. 1.  Dealer Demand  Investors dumped the shortest maturity U.S. government debt
during the shutdown as lawmakers were at odds over extending the
nation’s debt ceiling on concern principle and interest payments
would be delayed or defaulted on if a budget agreement wasn’t
reached.  “There was a strong reception to the auction, with strong
nondealer demand,” said  Ian Lyngen , a government-bond
strategist at CRT Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .
“We have ongoing uncertainty, policy still headed into the end
of the year, and the economic data, while delayed, certainly
hasn’t been robust, which continues to underpin demand in the
front end.”  Today’s auction yield compared with a forecast of 0.322
percent in a Bloomberg News survey of eight of the Fed’s 21
primary dealers.  Indirect bidders,  an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 29 percent of the notes, the most since
July, compared with an average of 23 percent for the past 10
sales.  ‘Good Start’  Direct bidders,  non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 31 percent of
the notes at the sale, the most since February, compared with an
average of 22 percent for the past 10 auctions.  “The auction went quite well,” said  Ray Remy , head of
fixed income in New York at Daiwa Capital Markets America Inc.,
one of 21 primary dealers that trade with the Fed. “It’s a
really good start to the week.”  The U.S. will sell $35 billion in five-year debt tomorrow
and $29 billion in seven-year securities on Oct. 30.  Two-year notes have gained 0.3 percent this year, compared
with a decline of 1.8 percent by Treasuries overall, according
to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The two-year notes
returned 0.3 percent in 2012, while Treasuries overall rose 2.2
percent.  “Yields have richened pretty significantly, we’ve had a
good run, and now investors are waiting for better prices to
jump back in with gusto,” Thomas Simons, a government-debt
economist in New York at Jefferies LLC, one of the primary
dealers required to bid at Treasury auctions, said before the
results were final.  U.S. central bankers will pare the monthly pace of asset
buying to $70 billion from $85 billion at their March 18-19
meeting, according to the median of responses in a Bloomberg
News survey of economists.  The  Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Bond Index (BUSY)  has declined 1.8
percent for the year through Oct. 25. Japanese bonds gained 2.5
percent, while  Germany ’s lost 1.4 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
