National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC , the
 United Arab Emirates ’ biggest bank, plans to focus on five main
industries as it seeks to tap into an estimated $137 billion
banking-revenue pool in the Middle East, Asia and  Africa .  The state-controlled lender will concentrate on financial
institutions, energy and resources, transport, real estate and
family conglomerates as well as trade and retailers, Chief
Executive Officer Alex Thursby said on an analyst call today.  The lender reported yesterday an 8 percent decline in
third-quarter profit to 1.04 billion dirhams ($282 million),
missing analyst estimates. Profit fell as one-off gains from
hedging strategies last year were not repeated. Lending grew 5.2
percent in the quarter from the preceding three months.  Thursby estimated annual spending in the  Middle East , Asia
and Africa on wholesale banking products like managing equity
and debt issues, merger advisory, cash management and trade
finance at $137 billion. The bank plans to strengthen offices in
London and Singapore to help capture more business, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
