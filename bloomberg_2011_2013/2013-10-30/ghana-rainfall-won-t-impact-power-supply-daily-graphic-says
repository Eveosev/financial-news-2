Poor rainfall in  Ghana  won’t limit
the amount of power produced by the Volta River Authority, the
nation’s largest generator, the Daily Graphic reported.  The water level at the Akosombo dam, also known as the
Volta dam, was at 260.75 feet on Oct. 28, within the authority’s
operational limit of 245 feet to 278 feet, the Accra-based
newspaper said, citing Sam Fletcher, a spokesman. The level is
3.6 percent lower than last year, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
