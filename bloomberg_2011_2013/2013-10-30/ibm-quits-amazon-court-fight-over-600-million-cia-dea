Corp. (IBM)  abandoned its court fight with  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  over
a $600 million cloud computing contract for the U.S. Central
Intelligence Agency, citing the government’s urgency to begin
work on the project.  IBM withdrew its bid for a stay of U.S. Court of Claims
Judge Thomas Wheeler’s Oct. 8 ruling in favor of Amazon after
the  Justice Department  said in court papers that further delay
in resolving the contract would bring “harm to the United
States” and create “significant challenges” for the CIA.  Amazon sued the U.S. in July after the  Government
Accountability Office , the agency that makes recommendations on
challenges to contracts, sided with IBM and agreed that the CIA
had failed to properly evaluate prices and had waived a contract
requirement only for Seattle-based Amazon.  “In light of the government’s recent submissions
emphasizing its need to move forward on the contract, IBM has
withdrawn its motion,” Clint Roswell, an IBM spokesman, said in
a statement. “IBM maintains its position that the GAO’s
findings were appropriate.”  Roswell declined to say what further action on the
contract, if any, Armonk, New York-based IBM would pursue.  Mary Osako, a spokeswoman for Amazon, didn’t immediately
respond to a request for comment.  The case is Amazon Web Services Inc. v. U.S., 13-cv-00506,
U.S. Court of Federal Claims ( Washington ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
