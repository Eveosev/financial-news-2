India ’s commodities futures market
regulator has sought an audit of the  Multi Commodity Exchange of
India Ltd.  after a related spot bourse failed in August.  The  Forward Markets Commission  wants to examine large
expenditures by the MCX and related-party transactions, Ramesh Abhishek, chairman of the regulator said in an interview. The
MCX has set up a panel to run the bourse after the government in
July ordered the National Spot Exchange Ltd., founded by MCX
Vice Chairman Jignesh Shah, to halt trading.  Volume at MCX, India’s biggest platform for commodities
which counts NYSE Euronext and Fidelity International Ltd. as
investors, is set to plummet to a five-year low this month as
authorities widen their probe of the NSEL. The regulator has
asked MCX’s largest investor, which is backed by Shah, to prove
that it is qualified to operate the bourse. It also tightened
rules for selecting directors for all futures exchanges.  “There have been complaints and concerns that a lot of
money was frittered away on donations,” Abhishek said in an
interview in his Mumbai office. “All these things are being
audited now.”  MCX is in the process of hiring an external auditor, Suman
Das Sarma, a spokesman for the exchange, said in an e-mail. The
bourse isn’t aware of the regulator’s concern about “wasting
money on donations,” he said.  MCX’s Chief Executive Officer Shreekant Javalgekar, its
chairman, and three directors quit over the past month after the
regulator tightened rules. Investors have been calling for the
resignation of MCX founder and vice chairman Shah.  Accounts Frozen  The Mumbai police has frozen bank accounts of Shah and
Joseph Massey, former chief executive officer of the MCX Stock
Exchange Ltd., the Economic Times reported today, citing
Rajvardhan, additional commissioner of police at the economic
offences wing. MCX’s Sarma declined to comment on the report.  The turmoil at MCX, which controls about 90 percent of the
country’s $2.8 trillion commodities futures market, began with
the government seeking details on NSEL’s settlement cycle on
July 14, and deepened with the suspension of most contracts on
the NSEL on July 31. The bourse was banned from introducing new
obligations without prior approval on Aug. 6.  MCX’s shares plummeted 41 percent in August, after falling
17 percent in July. The stock’s 30-day  volatility  is at 60,
compared with 20 for the CNX Nifty index. The shares rose 1.2
percent to 473.40 rupees the close.  Financial Technologies
(India) Ltd. (FTECH) , which owns 26 percent of MCX, has sunk 68 percent
since July 31. It fell for the first time in four days.  ‘Pushed to Wall’  The regulator Oct. 5 questioned  Financial Technologies ’
ability to manage MCX. According to the FMC, a person shall be
deemed “fit and proper” to run a bourse if the person has a
general reputation and record of fairness, integrity and is not
involved in any action of fraud and dishonesty. MCX has until
the end of today to reply to the notice, Abhishek said.  The exchange appointed Pravir Vohra and G. Ananth Raman as
independent directors to the board on Oct. 23, and named Parveen
Kumar Singhal, a deputy managing director, as the chief
executive until a managing director is named.  “If the regulator thinks that Jignesh Shah is not fit and
proper, he won’t put up a fight; he has been pushed to the
wall,” Gnanasekar Thiagarajan, a director at Commtrendz Risk
Management Services Pvt., said by telephone. “The MCX is an
institution now. Even if it changes hands, it will be taken over
by professionals.”  Volumes Falling  The number of contracts traded on the MCX fell 31 percent
in September from July, with volume this month totaling 11.5
million contracts, the least since December 2008, MCX data show.
Volumes on the rival  National Commodity & Derivatives Exchange
Ltd.  have declined 6.3 percent since July.  “Volumes have been falling because of the higher margins
imposed in August and declining investor confidence after what
happened at NSEL,” Aurobinda Prasad, head of research at Karvy
Comtrade Ltd., said from Hyderabad. “The government will first
have to sort out the NSEL story.”  The NSEL provided an electronic platform for farmers and
traders to buy and sell about 53 commodities on an immediate
delivery basis. The bourse broke rules by allowing settlement
longer than 11 days and permitting sale of goods traders didn’t
keep in its warehouses, according to the regulator.  NSEL’s former Chief Executive Officer Anjani Sinha was
arrested on Oct. 17 after an investors’ group complained the
executives diverted funds and failed to settle about 56 billion
rupees ($912 million) in dues to investors.  Empty Warehouses  NSEL was not a spot bourse as trades were being settled
after 35 days, Himanshu Roy, joint commissioner of police in
Mumbai, told reporters on Oct. 25. “It’s not even an exchange;
It’s more like a finance scheme where people invest, square up
and the money keeps rolling.”  Dilip Tambe, a spokesman for NSEL, declined to comment for
the report.  A Bloomberg TV India report broadcast on Aug. 14 showed a
warehouse owner in  New Delhi  say that they had no inventories of
sugar even as NSEL data showed a stockpiles of more than 100,000
tons. Another storage facility, which according to NSEL data
held 9,632 metric tons of steel coils, was found to have been
shut for two years, according to the report.  The FMC is working with exchanges to strengthen rules and
revive investor confidence, Abhishek said. The regulator is
asking futures bourses to audit their warehouses and margin
systems, he said.  “We have asked warehouses to register with the  Warehousing
Development and Regulatory Authority  by the end of the year,”
Abhishek said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
