Panasonic Corp. (6752) , the biggest
supplier of lithium-ion batteries used in electric cars, won a
new contract to supply cells to  Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA) ’s Model S and
Model X in a deal that may generate $7 billion in revenue.  Panasonic will supply 2 billion lithium-ion battery cells
to the  Palo Alto , California-based automaker in the four years
through 2017, the Osaka-based company said in a statement today.
That compares with about 200 million units shipped for Tesla in
the past two years, according to Chieko Gyobu, a Panasonic
spokeswoman.  President Kazuhiro Tsuga is trying to boost Panasonic’s
earnings from business-use products amid slowing demand for its
Viera TVs and Eluga handsets. The contract may add about $7
billion sales and cement Panasonic’s position as the largest
supplier for electric cars, said Ali Izadi-Najafabadi, a
Bloomberg New Energy Finance analyst.  Tesla, led by billionaire Elon Musk, plans to sell 21,000
Model S sedans this year, priced from $70,000 to more than
$100,000. The Model X sport-utility vehicle are set to be
offered in late 2014.  Panasonic’s Gyobu declined to comment on battery revenue
from Tesla.  To contact the reporter on this story:
