A U.K. government program that
forced unemployed people to work for free was found to be
illegal by the country’s  Supreme Court .  Guidelines for giving jobs to the short-term and long-term
unemployed subsidized by state payments didn’t “contain a
sufficiently detailed” description of how the programs
operated, the court said in an e-mailed statement today.  “The courts have no more important function than to ensure
that the executive complies with the requirements of Parliament
as expressed in a statute,” Judge David Neuberger said in the
written ruling today.  The government, which appealed a lower court’s ruling, had
also failed to give participants enough information about the
work they were required to do, the court said in  London . The
U.K. unemployment rate fell to 7.7 percent from 7.8 percent this
year, according to the  Office for National Statistics .  One of the cases covered by today’s ruling was filed by
former museum curator Caitlin Reilly, who was made to stack
shelves in a Poundland store for two weeks.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
