Zambia,  Africa ’s biggest copper
producer, must consider its revenue requirements when
determining tax policy for the mining industry, Finance Minister
Alexander Chikwanda said.  “The taxation arrangement must take into account the
country’s revenue needs, but also the viability of the mines,”
Chikwanda told reporters today in Lusaka, the capital.  Lower than expected revenue collection contributed to the
sharp deterioration in Zambia’s finances that led Fitch Ratings
to cut its rating on the country’s debt this week. The
government has resisted calls for a windfall tax on mining
companies based on revenue instead of profit.  Chikwanda said mining companies should pay tax “whether
they have made profit or not,” the Lusaka-based Post newspaper
reported today, citing comments made in a parliamentary
committee meeting.  He declined to comment on whether he supports a windfall
tax, which a parliamentary committee last proposed in December
2011. The country is losing as much as $2 billion a year in
revenues because of tax avoidance from mining companies, Miles Sampa, then deputy finance minister, said in November.  There must be a “critical examination of all the
variables” in formulating mining tax policy, Chikwanda said.
Mining accounts for more than 70 percent of Zambia’s export
earnings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
