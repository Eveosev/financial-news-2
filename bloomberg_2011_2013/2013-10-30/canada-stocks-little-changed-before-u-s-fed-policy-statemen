Canadian  stocks  rose, erasing
earlier losses, as earnings from Yamana Gold Inc. pushed gold
shares higher and investors analyzed a statement from the U.S.
Federal Reserve for clues on when it may scale back stimulus.  OceanaGold Corp. climbed 16 percent after raising its
copper production target and cutting its cost estimates. Yamana
Gold gained 4.8 percent as earnings topped forecasts.  Wi-Lan
Inc. (WIN)  jumped 6.5 percent as the company considers strategic
options including a sale after losing a patent case. B2Gold
Corp. fell 1.1 percent as third-quarter revenue declined amid
rising costs.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  rose 14.72
points, or 0.1 percent, to 13,455.33 at 4 p.m. in Toronto,
erasing earlier losses of as much as 0.6 percent. The benchmark
Canadian equity gauge has advanced 5.2 percent in October,
heading for the biggest monthly gain in two years.  “The tension is going to shift back to the economy and the
Fed is clarifying further that what they do will be very
dependent on economic data,” Youssef Zohny, portfolio manager
with Stenner Investment Partners of Richardson GMP Ltd., said
from  Vancouver . Richardson GMP manages about C$16 billion ($15.3
billion). “It seems like the Fed decision was being
anticipated. Investors are going to be keeping an eye out for
the data starting next week, which will likely be more important
than this announcement.”  The U.S. central bank said it sees improvement in economic
activity even as it maintained its $85 billion in monthly
purchases. The Fed said it needs to see more evidence that the
economy will continue to improve. The central bank will keep
stimulus measures at the current level until March 2014,
economists forecast in a Bloomberg survey this month.  Gold Earnings  OceanaGold soared 16 percent to C$1.71 and Yamana rallied
4.8 percent to C$10.71 to pace gains among raw-materials stocks
as five of 10 industries in the S&P/TSX advanced. Trading volume
was in line with the 30-day average.  OceanaGold raised its 2013 copper production guidance to
18,000 to 20,000 tons from 15,000 to 18,000 tons. The company
produced 6,150 tons of copper in the third quarter and 74,697
ounces of gold.  The company also lowered its cash costs forecasts for the
year to $550 to $650 an ounce from $650 to $800 an ounce
earlier.  Yamana reported adjusted earnings of 9 cents a share in the
third quarter, compared with analysts’ estimates for 8 cents.
Production climbed 4 percent from the second quarter and revenue
increased, the company said.  Cameco Corp. (CCO)  increased 4.6 percent to C$19.87. The company
said revenue this year is now forecast to grow 30 percent to 35
percent, compared with earlier projections of 25 percent to 30
percent.  Cameco  reported  third-quarter adjusted earnings of 53
Canadian cents a share, ahead of analysts’ estimates of 18
cents.  Copper Rally  Copper Mountain Mining Corp. (CUM)  jumped 5.3 percent to C$1.78
as revenue climbed 42 percent compared with a year ago. Copper
rose the most in five weeks in  New York  as inventories tracked
by the London Metal Exchange shrank for a 40th straight session.  B2Gold dropped 1.1 percent to C$2.69 after reporting third-quarter revenue of $128.7 million, short of analysts’ estimates
for $134.7 million. The company now forecasts 2013 cash costs of
$675 to $690 an ounce, compared with $630 to $660 earlier.  Wi-Lan, the Ottawa-based patent licensing company, climbed
6.5 percent to C$3.30. Wi-Lan will consider changes to dividend
policy or other forms of return of capital, as well as “the
acquisition or disposition of assets, joint ventures, the sale
of the company, alternative operating models or continuing with
the current business plan,” it said today in a statement.  The company lost a patent-infringement trial against Apple
Inc. on Oct. 23 in which Wi-Lan was seeking $248 million in
royalties for wireless technology used in mobile devices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
