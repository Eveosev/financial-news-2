Leighton Holdings Ltd. (LEI)  was sued by
shareholders who claim they were misled in 2011 before
Australiaâ€™s biggest construction company reversed a profit
forecast.  Maurice Blackburn Lawyers, a Melbourne-based class action
firm, filed the suit in federal court in Sydney today on behalf
of more than 2,000 shareholders who bought Leighton shares
between Aug. 16, 2010, and April 11, 2011, the lawyers said in
an e-mailed statement.  In February 2011, Leighton forecast net income for the
fiscal year of A$480 million ($454 million). Two months later,
on April 11, 2011, the builder projected it would have a loss of
A$427 million for the year as it wrote off A$1.1 billion
relating to the Brisbane Airport Link project, a Victorian
desalination plant project and a Dubai-based joint venture.
Shares slumped as much as 15 percent on April 14, the first day
of trading following the statement.  Leighton, in a statement to the Australian Stock Exchange
today, said the claim had no basis and would be contested.  Leighton had reduced its unpublished, private profit
forecast for the Brisbane Airport Link, its biggest project, to
A$133 million from A$407 million around November 2010, according
to the statement of claim. On March 18, 2011, Leighton
executives were told at a meeting that the Brisbane Airport Link
would generate a loss of A$182 million to A$610 million,
according to the statement of claim.  The case is Inabu Pty as Trustee for the Alidas
Superannuation Fund v. Leighton Holdings Ltd. NSD2244/2013.
