Russian stocks  rose for a fourth
day, led by VTB Group, the nation’s second-biggest lender, amid
speculation the U.S. will maintain stimulus.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  added 0.5 percent to 1,523.29 as of 11:54
a.m. in Moscow. VTB rallied 2.3 percent, the most since Oct. 10,
to 4.437 kopeks. Power companies OAO Inter RAO and OAO RusHydro
gained more than 1.4 percent. Utilities had the biggest increase

meeting concludes today. Russian equities have the cheapest
 valuations  among 21 emerging economies monitored by Bloomberg
and the index trades at 4.4 times projected 12-month earnings,

global markets encourage them to buy developing-nation assets,

said in e-mailed comments.  The Micex has climbed 4.3 percent this month versus a gain
of 5.5 percent for the MSCI  emerging markets  gauge. VTB has
fallen 17 percent this year, compared with an 11 percent advance

sustaining margins in the short term.  Economists expect the Fed will maintain its $85 billion in
monthly bond purchases at a meeting ending today. Spain’s
economy emerged from a two-year recession last quarter, data
today may show, according to a Bloomberg News survey of
