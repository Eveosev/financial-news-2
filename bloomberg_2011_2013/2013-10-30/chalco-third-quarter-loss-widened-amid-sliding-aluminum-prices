Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd., the
nation’s biggest producer of the lightweight metal, said a loss
in the third quarter widened from a year earlier as prices
dropped.  Net loss was 1.22 billion  yuan  ($200 million) in the three
months ended Sept. 30, compared with a loss of 1.08 billion yuan
a year earlier, the Beijing-based company said today in a filing
to the Shanghai stock exchange. Sales climbed 22 percent to 45.4
billion yuan.  Aluminum Corp., known as Chalco, is seeking to trim losses
by controlling costs and disposing of unprofitable assets. It
sold its aluminum fabrication business in June to its parent and
said this month it plans to sell its stake in an African iron
ore venture for about $2.07 billion.  The  stock  gained 2 percent to HK$3 in Hong Kong at the
close, matching the 2 percent gain on the benchmark  Hang Seng 
index, before the announcement today. The stock has declined 15
percent this year.  Aluminum in  London  has fallen 9.2 percent this year through
yesterday and average 6.2 percent lower in the third quarter
from a year ago.  Chalco’s disposal of its fabrication unit would allow the
company to avoid 500 million yuan of operating losses, Standard
Chartered Plc said in an Oct. 18 report. Its proposal to sell
its share of the Simandou iron-ore project in  Guinea , a venture
with Rio Tinto Group, to its parent will reduce Chalco’s capital
expenditure burden, the bank said in the report.  To contact the reporters on this story:
