Demand for renewable-energy credits
in  India  jumped threefold in October as regulators cracked down
on companies ignoring government-mandated clean-power targets.  Bids to buy wind, hydro and biomass credits numbered
150,640, compared with 49,831 the previous month, according to
data from trader REConnect Energy Solutions Pvt.  The government requires electricity distributors and large
industrial companies including  Coal India Ltd. (COAL)  and  Tata Power
Co. (TPWR)  to get as much as 10 percent of their energy from
renewables. Those unable to source enough locally must comply by
purchasing credits from clean-power plants.  The surge in demand indicates companies are responding to
efforts by state regulators in Punjab, Uttarakhand, Maharashtra
and Chhattisgarh to enforce the rules, REConnect said in a note
to clients. On Sept. 11, Uttarakhand’s electricity watchdog
threatened to fine the local state-run power distributor for
failing to meet its targets in the last financial year.  In this month’s session, wind, hydropower and biomass
credits traded at their floor price of 1,500 rupees ($24). Solar
credits, which trade separately, also cleared at their minimum
price of 9,300 rupees. Each credit represents 1 megawatt-hour of
electricity fed into the grid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
