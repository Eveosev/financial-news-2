Barcelona won 3-0 at Celta Vigo to
stay unbeaten in Spanish soccer’s La Liga and move four points
clear of  Atletico Madrid  atop the standings.  Alexis Sanchez  got the opener in the ninth minute last
night and Barcelona doubled its lead three minutes into the
second half when Cesc Fabregas’s shot went in off Celta
goalkeeper Yoel after hitting the crossbar. Fabregas slipped the
ball past Yoel six minutes later to make it 3-0.  Defending champion Barca, which beat archrival Real Madrid
last weekend, moved to 31 points through 11 games. Atletico
visits Granada tomorrow.  In Italy,  Inter Milan  missed the chance to get within a
point of a top-three spot in Serie A by drawing 1-1 at Atlanta
last night. Ricardo Alvarez put Inter ahead before German Denis
tied it for the home team.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
