Brown University  canceled a speech
by  New York  Police Commissioner Ray Kelly after students and
community members shouted him down in protest of the NYPD’s
stop-and-frisk policy.  The auditorium on the campus of the Providence,  Rhode
Island , Ivy League school was cleared after almost a half hour
of shouting and interruptions that made it impossible for the
lecture to take place, the university said in a  statement  late
yesterday. Kelly was to deliver a speech entitled “Proactive
Policing in America’s Biggest City.”  “Not only was Commissioner Kelly denied the right to
speak, members of our community were denied their right to
challenge him,” Brown President Christina Paxson said in a
 letter  to students, faculty, staff and alumni. “That is unfair
to everyone involved and disrespectful to the rights we all
embrace and should be vigilant in upholding as members of an
academic community.”  Paxson called it a “sad day” for the Brown community.  To contact the reporter on this story:
