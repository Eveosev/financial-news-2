European  stocks  were little changed
at a one-week high as companies from  Eni SpA (ENI)  to Volkswagen AG
posted profit that exceeded estimates, while a gauge of
telecommunications companies retreated.  Eni,  Italy ’s biggest oil company, climbed 1.3 percent.
Volkswagen posted its biggest gain in 15 months as Europe’s
largest carmaker said cost cutting contributed to higher
earnings. TomTom NV added 3.4 percent after the Dutch maker of
navigation systems raised its forecast for 2013. Belgacom SA
dropped 5.3 percent as a competitor cut the price of its mobile-phone plans.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index added less than 0.1 percent to
320.8 at the close of trading, after earlier climbing as much as
0.7 percent. The equity benchmark has  advanced 3.3 percent  this
month as U.S. lawmakers agreed to lift the federal debt ceiling
and investors speculated that a worse-than-forecast payrolls
report would delay a reduction in the Fed’s bond-buying program.  “Investors are pricing in an earnings recovery for 2014,”
said Francois Savary, who oversees about $9.5 billion as chief
investment officer at Reyl & Cie. in Geneva. “People are buying
European equities because of future expectations.  Still, if
there is no recovery in the U.S. and the economy continues to
lose momentum, don’t expect a revival in Europe any time soon.
This could be dangerous.”  U.S. companies added 130,000 workers in October, fewer than
the 150,000 median projection in a Bloomberg survey of
economists, according to a report from the ADP Research
Institute today. That was the lowest reading since April.
Businesses hired a net 145,000 people in September.  Fed Meeting  The Federal Open Market Committee meets for a second day to
discuss monetary policy. The 16-day shutdown of the U.S.
government earlier this month will reduce economic growth by 0.3
percentage points this quarter at an annual rate, according to a
Bloomberg News survey of economists. The central bank will
probably delay lowering its $85 billion in monthly bond
purchases until March 2014, economists forecast in the survey.
The Fed announces its decision after European markets close.  National benchmark indexes dropped in nine of the 18
Western-European markets. The U.K’s FTSE 100 rose less than 0.1
percent, while  France ’s CAC 40 and  Germany ’s DAX Index dropped
0.1 percent.  Eni rose 1.3 percent to 18.35 euros after the Italian oil
producer posted adjusted  net income  of 1.17 billion euros ($1.6
billion) for the third quarter, more than the 998 million euros
that analysts had predicted for the period.  Volkswagen Rallies  Volkswagen gained 5 percent to 183.50 euros after posting
quarterly earnings before interest and taxes that jumped 20
percent to 2.78 billion euros. That exceeded the average  analyst
estimate  of 2.72 billion euros.  TomTom advanced 3.4 percent to 6.10 euros. The company
forecast adjusted earnings of 25 euro cents a share this year.
It had projected 20 euro cents apiece. TomTom also said that
this year’s sales will approach the upper end of its 900 million
euros to 950 million euros range.  Orkla ASA rallied 4.9 percent to 48.45 kroner. Operating
profit for the Orkla Foods business rose to 364 million kroner
($62 million) in the period from 312 million kroner in 2012.  Belgacom declined 5.3 percent to 20.51 euros. Telenet Group
Holding NV, which competes with Belgacom in  Belgium , cut its
prices for mobile-phone tariffs. A gauge of telecommunications
stocks fell 0.8 percent for the second-worst performance among
19 industry groups on the Stoxx 600.  Standard Life  Standard Life Plc slipped 4 percent to 354.5 pence after
reporting that its asset-management business received net
inflows of 1.2 billion pounds in the three months through
September, less than half the 2.6 billion pounds that it
reported during the same period last year.  Fiat SpA (F)  fell 2.2 percent to 5.70 euros, its lowest price
since July. The Italian carmaker lowered its forecast for
trading profit this year to 3.5 billion euros to 3.8 billion
euros. It had projected earnings on that measure of as much as
4.5 billion euros. The company also posted third-quarter profit
in Latin America that tumbled 52 percent to 165 million euros.  Pearson Plc declined 3.6 percent to 1,316 pence after
forecasting that the margins for its education unit will drop in
2013 because of weaker demand for college textbooks. The
publisher had forecast in July that the margins would be similar
to those in 2012.  Viscofan SA  sank 7.7 percent to 39.51 euros, its biggest
drop since January 2008, after the Spanish maker of sausage
casings said it will probably miss its targets for 2013 because
of weak currencies. The company in July predicted net income of
107 million euros to 108 million euros and earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of as much as 195
million euros for this year.  Piraeus Bank SA slid 9.8 percent to 1.48 euros after Banco
Comercial Portugues SA sold 235 million shares in the Greek
lender for 1.50 euros apiece. The Portuguese bank also sold the
same number of warrants at 60 euro cents each.  To contact the reporter on this story:
