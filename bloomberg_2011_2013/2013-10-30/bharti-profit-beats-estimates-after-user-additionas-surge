Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI) ,  India ’s largest
mobile-phone operator, posted profit that missed analyst
estimates after customers spent less time talking on the
company’s network and interest costs climbed.  Net income fell 29 percent to 5.12 billion rupees ($83
million) in the three months ended September from 7.21 billion
rupees a year earlier, New Delhi-based Bharti said today in a
statement. That trailed the 7.9 billion-rupee median of 31
analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Billionaire Chairman  Sunil Mittal ’s flagship company saw
subscriber call minutes drop, resulting in the 15th consecutive
quarterly decline in profit, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Nationwide, gross customer additions have fallen 66
percent to 33 million, eroding revenue at carriers even as call
rates rise, according to Praveen Menon and John Butler, analysts
at Bloomberg Industries.  “There will be hiccups when margins in India fall during
difficult quarters or volatility strains African business,”
Harit Shah, a Mumbai-based analyst with Nirmal Bang Equities,
said before the announcement. “This happened to be one of those
soft quarters in India. It will get better, soon.”  Revenue rose to 213.2 billion rupees from 194 billion
rupees, beating the 209.3 billion-rupee median of analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
