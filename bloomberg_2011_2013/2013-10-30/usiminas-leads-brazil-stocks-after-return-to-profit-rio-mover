Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais
SA , Brazil’s second-largest steelmaker by output, led gains
among Brazilian stocks after reporting its first net income in
almost two years.  Preferred shares of Usiminas, as the  Belo Horizonte ,
Brazil-based company is known,  advanced  3.7 percent to 11.73
reais at 12:15 p.m. in  Sao Paulo , heading towards its highest
close since Oct. 16. Volume was 60 percent of the 3-month daily
average for today’s closing. Usiminas  advanced  the most in
Brazil’s benchmark Ibovespa index.  Usiminas said in a  statement  today it had third-quarter net
income of 70.5 million reais ($32.2 million) compared with a
loss of 143.3 million a year earlier, the first profit since
2011’s fourth quarter. That met a 71.2 million-real adjusted net
income average estimate by nine analysts  compiled  by Bloomberg.
Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, or Ebitda, rose to 537.6 million reais, the
highest result in three years, according to Bloomberg  data .  “Usiminas again posted a positive performance by
controlling costs and expenses,” Itau BBA analysts Marcos Assumpcao and Andre Pinheiro said in a note to clients today.
“The strong third quarter results could lead to a positive
earnings revision by those who were skeptical about the
potential turnaround.”  Gerdau SA is  Brazil ’s largest steelmaker by output.  To contact the reporter on this story:
