Jason Armstrong , a 13-year veteran
of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. who oversaw analysis of phone and
cable companies, is leaving to become  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s head of
 investor relations , according to a person with knowledge of the
matter.  Armstrong starts in late January, said the person, who
asked not to be identified because the move hasn’t been publicly
announced. Comcast, based in Philadelphia, is the largest U.S.
cable company.  As the  lead analyst  for the investment bank’s North
American communications equity research group, Armstrong covered
the pay-TV industry, including Comcast, Dish Network Corp. and
Time Warner Cable Inc., as well as their competitors in the
phone industry, such as AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications
Inc. He joined Goldman in 2000 and was previously with Ernst &
Young LLP in  Chicago , according to Goldman’s website.  Leslie Shribman, a spokeswoman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment, as did John Demming, a spokesman for
Comcast. Armstrong couldn’t be reached for comment through his
Goldman Sachs office and e-mail address.  Armstrong had a buy rating on Comcast for most of the past
four years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
