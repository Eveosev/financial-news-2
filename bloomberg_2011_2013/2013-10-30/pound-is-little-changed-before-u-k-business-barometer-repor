U.K. government bonds rose for a
fourth day, the longest streak of gains in a month, as
speculation the  Federal Reserve  will maintain stimulus spurred
demand for fixed-income assets.  Ten-year  gilt yields  slid to the lowest level since August
after Bank of England Governor  Mark Carney  said central-bank
officials won’t tighten monetary policy until the recovery gains
traction. The pound headed for its biggest monthly decline
versus the euro since January as economists said data this week
will show U.K. house-price growth and manufacturing expansion
slowed in October.  “Gilts are trading rather well,” said  John Wraith , a
fixed-income strategist at Bank of America Corp. in  London . “As
long as the Fed is printing money then there’s a tendency for
prices to just keep pushing higher, in line with all the other
core markets.”  Benchmark 10-year gilt yields slid six basis points, or
0.06 percentage point, to 2.54 percent at 4:30 p.m. London time,
the lowest since Aug. 13. The 2.25 percent bond maturing in
September 2023 rose 0.48, or 4.80 pounds per 1,000-pound
($1,607) face amount, to 97.455. Two-year gilt yields dropped
three basis points to 0.39 percent.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  will maintain its $85
billion in monthly bond buying when it concludes its two-day
policy meeting today, according to a Bloomberg survey. The U.S.
central bank last month refrained from reducing the stimulus to
await further evidence of an economic recovery. Policy makers
will slow the pace of buying by $15 billion at their March
meeting, a separate survey on Oct. 17-18 showed.  Fewer Workers  Gilts stayed higher as U.S.  yields  dropped toward a three-month low after ADP Research Institute said U.S. companies added
130,000 workers last month, the fewest since April. Treasury 10-year yields fell three basis points to 2.48 percent after
sliding to 2.47 percent on Oct. 23, the lowest since July 22.  U.K. gilts returned 1.2 percent in the month through
yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes, as
European  government bonds  rallied. Treasuries advanced 0.7
percent and German securities returned 0.1 percent.  “We’re not going to look to tighten monetary policy until
we see real traction and momentum in this recovery that has been
sustained for some time,” Carney said in an interview with
Cardiff, Wales-based newspaper Western Mail. “Most of the
growth in momentum is coming from the household sector and
there’s a pick-up in the housing market from quite low levels.”  Pound Weakens  The pound was little changed at 85.66 pence per euro after
depreciating to 85.85 pence yesterday, the weakest since Aug.
29. It has lost 2.5 percent this month versus the common
currency. Sterling gained 0.2 percent to $1.6075 after rising to
$1.6257 on Oct. 23, the highest level since Oct. 1.  A gauge of U.K.  home prices  rose 0.7 percent after
increasing 0.9 percent in September, according to a Bloomberg
survey before the report from the  Nationwide Building Society 
tomorrow. An index based on a survey of purchasing managers in
the  manufacturing  industry fell to 56.4 from 56.7, a separate
survey showed before London-based Markit Economics releases the
data on Friday. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  “The pound remains overextended” versus the dollar,
Morgan Stanley analysts led by  Hans Redeker , the bank’s London-based head of foreign-exchange strategy wrote in a note to
clients today. “We suggest caution with Friday’s U.K. PMI,
which has generated strong positive signals recently, but now
has the potential to deliver a negative surprise.”  The pound gained 3.3 percent in the past three months, the
best performer among 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro rose 1.5
percent, while the dollar fell 2.7 percent.  Gilt Futures  The price on gilt futures climbed to the highest level
since August. The contract expiring in December rose 0.5 percent
to 111.99 after reaching 112.01, the most since Aug. 5.  The contract will meet resistance at 112.10, the 38.2
percent retracement of its decline from May to September, Credit
Suisse Group AG technical analysts including  David Sneddon  in
London wrote in a note to clients, citing Fibonacci analysis.  “Should strength directly extend, we would target
113.45,” the analysts wrote. The gilt contract last reached
that level on Aug. 1, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  In technical analysis, resistance refers to an area on a
price chart where sell orders may be clustered, and a break
indicates an asset may rise to the next level. Fibonacci
analysis is based on the theory that prices rise or fall by
certain percentages after reaching a high or low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
