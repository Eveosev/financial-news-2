Spain may allow banks to keep
counting about 30 billion euros ($41 billion) of deferred tax
assets as capital to help the financial system adapt to new
regulations, said three people with knowledge of the matter.  The government still hasn’t made a final decision, said the
people, who asked not to be identified because the information
isn’t public. One person said the amount will probably be about
28 billion euros. Officials for the Budget Ministry, the  Economy
Ministry  and the Bank of Spain declined to comment.  Spanish banks have been pushing to keep using deferred tax
assets, which were built up during the country’s financial
crisis and must be deducted over time from capital ratios under
Basel III regulations. The International Monetary Fund has
recommended steps to allow Spanish banks, which have about 50
billion euros of the assets, to use them to improve the quality
of their capital by converting them into transferable tax
claims.  Deferred tax assets arise from carrying over losses and may
be used to reduce future tax expenses. El Pais newspaper
reported today that Spain would allow banks to count from 25
billion euros to 30 billion euros of deferred tax assets as
capital.  To contact the reporters on this story:
