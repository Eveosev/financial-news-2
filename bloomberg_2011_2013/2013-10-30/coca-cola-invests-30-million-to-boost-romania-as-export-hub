Coca-Cola Co. and  Coca-Cola HBC AG (CCH) 
invested 22 million euros ($30 million) in a new  production line 
at a Romanian bottling plant to help transform the Balkan state
into an export hub for 100 million consumers in eastern Europe.  In addition to the new line, which was completed in July,
the company has built a new warehouse and a power plant in 2009,
investing 45 million-euros, Coca-Cola HBC Chief Executive

about 525 million euros in Romania since 1991, he said.  “This wonderful investment is growing this business and it
will be a center of export to a group of countries that together
