Thailand’s  Ananda Development Pcl (ANAN)  is
planning the Dim Sum market’s first sale of notes without a
fixed maturity.  The Thai builder, which hasn’t previously issued foreign-currency bonds, expects to sell the yuan-denominated notes
offshore in the near future, subject to market conditions, a
person familiar with the matter said, asking not to be
identified because the details are private.  Issuers from outside  China  and  Hong Kong  cut sales of Dim
Sum bonds this year, offering 23.6 billion  yuan  ($3.9 billion)
since December, 29 percent less than issuance in the first 10
months of 2012, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The Chinese
sovereign sold securities due 2043 in June, the longest-dated
notes in the market so far, paying 3.95 percent, the data show.  “The market is actually quite keen to see new bonds these
days,” said Becky Liu, a Hong Kong-based senior rates
strategist at Standard Chartered Plc. “Anything higher yielding
would be interesting. Private banks would be likely to get a
good, if not a majority, share.”  Private banks bought 47 percent of  Aluminum Corp of China
Ltd. (2600) ’s dollar-denominated perpetual bonds at 6.625 percent last
week, a person familiar with the matter said at the time. By
contrast, China Petrochemical Corp. allocated 7 percent of its
30-year notes which offered a 5.417 percent yield to the wealth
managers.  Dim Sum bonds yield an average 4.17 percent, 15 basis
points less than Asian issuers pay for debt in the U.S.
currency, HSBC Holdings Plc indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
