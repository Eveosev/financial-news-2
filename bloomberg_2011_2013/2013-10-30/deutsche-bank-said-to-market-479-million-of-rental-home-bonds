Deutsche Bank AG (DB)  is marketing $479.1
million of bonds backed by mortgages on 3,207 single-family
rental homes owned by  Blackstone (BX)  Group LP, according to two
people with knowledge of the offering.  A $278.7 million portion of the deal is rated AAA, the top
credit rating, by Moody’s Investors Service, Kroll Bond Rating
Agency and Morningstar Inc. The deal is the first of its type as
Blackstone leads a $20 billion buying spree of single-family
homes to rent by institutional investors.  Private equity firms, hedge funds and real estate
investment trusts started buying homes to rent after prices
plunged 35 percent from the 2006 peak. New York-based
Blackstone, the world’s largest private equity firm, has been
spending about $100 million a week on properties across the U.S.
since the start of this year, when  Wall Street  increased lending
to the sector.  Institutional investors have purchased as many as 200,000
homes during the past two years, seeking to profit from
rebounding prices and rising demand for rentals among millions
of Americans who went through foreclosure or can’t qualify for a
mortgage. The firms are looking to the bond market for capital
to buy more properties and increase returns with borrowed money.  To contact the reporters on this story:
