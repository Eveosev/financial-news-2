Fossil-fuel assets such as coal
mines and gas wells may lose value if  climate change  prompts
tougher regulations, according to a report from  Al Gore  and
David Blood’s Generation Investment Management.  About two-thirds of the fossil fuels still underground must
remain there if the planet is to meet a United Nations target of
limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees
Fahrenheit). That means assets such as coal mines and gas wells
may have to reduce production, cutting profits,  according to
the paper.  “It is no longer prudent for investors and asset owners to
treat climate change as a peripheral issue,” Blood, co-founder
of Generation Investment, said in the statement. “Investors and
asset owners should capitalize on the opportunities emerging
from the transition to a low-carbon economy. The competitive
landscape for fossil fuel-intensive companies is losing its
attractiveness at an accelerated rate.”  Social, scientific and political pressure to switch to
renewables may be buoyed by efforts to conserve more of the
water used in conventional  power plants , the paper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
