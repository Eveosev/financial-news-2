Chancellor Angela Merkel  and
Germany’s  Social Democrats  meet today for their second full
round of coalition talks as the main rival parties stitch
together their first agreements to form a new government.  The 75 negotiators from Merkel’s  Christian Democratic
Union , its CSU Bavarian sister party and the Social Democrats
meet at SPD headquarters in central Berlin at noon. The talks
will focus on European policy.  In the first week of substantive talks on a prospective
government, negotiators reached an initial accord to renew a
push for a broad-based European financial-transaction tax.
Issues on which the sides disagreee, such as the SPD’s demand to
establish a nationwide statutory  minimum wage , have not yet been
broached.  More than five weeks after Merkel’s bloc won its largest
share of the vote since German reunification, negotiators aim to
keep talking for another month.  After that, the SPD must put a coalition agreement to a
vote of the party’s 470,000 members. SPD Chairman  Sigmar Gabriel 
won the endorsement by a party delegation 10 days ago to enter
talks, with a list of 10 “essential” Social Democratic
conditions to join a government with Merkel, who oversaw a
“grand coalition” with the SPD from 2005 to 2009.  Two days ago, a working group negotiating European policy,
one of at least 12 meeting after talks began a week ago, agreed
to give the financial transaction tax new impetus.  To contact the reporters on this story:
