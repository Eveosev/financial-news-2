The barn is no longer relegated to your grandfather’s farm or that rustic wedding venue you saw in a magazine. Whether a converted barn or a new construction infused with reclaimed barn materials, post-and-beam details are popping up in homes across the country. “In general, people want the mix,” said  Anita Oates  of Raliegh, NC-based interior design firm  Otrada LLC . “They’re trying to keep some of the original architectural features — whether stair rails or beadboard — and mix it up with modern elements that might work better, like lighting or plumbing.” When it comes to barn renovations or barn-inspired homes, Oates says people ultimately want a space that reflects their passions — from an equestrian pursuit to country living, or simply being inspired by nature. To fuel your own passions, we’ve gathered a few rustic barn retreats currently on the market. Jamaica, Vermont 816 Black Bear, Jamaica, VT  For sale: $2.795 million A timber-frame house seems right at home in scenic Vermont. Overlooking the green valley below, the barn-inspired home was built in 2010 combining rustic elements — antique floors, a masonry fireplace and built-ins — with luxe amenities such as radiant heat, a steam room, wine cellar and home theater. Nashville, Tennessee 4001 Estes Rd, Nashville, TN  For sale: $1.399 million “This renovated barn is rustic luxury at its best,” says the listing description for this property. Originally built in 1937, the country-chic space now includes a downstairs master and 2 upstairs bedrooms. The main floor was designed with lots of open space and a bar for entertaining. Islesboro, Maine 270 W Bay Rd, Islesboro, ME  For sale: $950,000 A converted and restored 1872 post-and-beam barn, this home sits on 13 acres overlooking Penobscot Bay. The interior, which includes 3 bedrooms, a cook’s kitchen and art studio, comes to life with pops of color and eclectic furnishings framed by exposed beams. Sherwood, Oregon 18480 SW Courtney Rd, Sherwood, OR  For sale: $739,000 It may not play host to Robin Hood and his merry men, but Sherwood, OR has a forest of its own with views of the Chehalem Mountains. On more than 4 tree-lined acres, this custom farm house provides an artsy retreat from the city. A vaulted living room ceiling with antique barn beams is a selling point along with a 900-foot deck connecting the main house to the garage.
