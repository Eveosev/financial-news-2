The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region against non-payment
fell, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  dropped 1 basis point to 133 basis
points as of 9:03 a.m. in Hong Kong, Westpac Banking Corp.
prices show. The gauge is poised to decline 23.4 basis points
since Sept. 30, its biggest monthly drop since June 2012,
according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index slid 1 basis point to 105
as of 11:52 a.m. in Sydney, according to Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. prices. The benchmark is set to fall for a
third day and is at a level unseen since Oct. 22, according to
CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices
quoted by dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index declined 1 basis point to
86.75 basis points as of 9:47 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to
Citigroup Inc. prices. The measure is on track to post its first
decline since Oct. 23, CMA data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
