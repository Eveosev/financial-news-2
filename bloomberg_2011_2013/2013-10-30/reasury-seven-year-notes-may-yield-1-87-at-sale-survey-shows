The Treasury Department’s $29
billion sale of seven-year notes may draw a  yield  of 1.87
percent, according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey of seven of the Federal Reserve’s 21 primary dealers.  The securities, which mature in October 2020, yielded 1.87
percent in pre-auction trading. Bids are due by 1 p.m. New York
time. Last month’s sale drew a yield of 2.058 percent.  The size of today’s offering is the same as the past 39
sales of seven-year notes after peaking at  $32 billion  from
November 2009 through April 2010.  The Sept. 29 offering’s  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges
demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was
2.46. The average for the past 10 auctions was 2.6.  Indirect bidders , a class of investor that includes foreign
central banks, bought 42 percent of the notes at the September
sale. The average for the past 10 auctions is 40.5 percent.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 17.8 percent of
the notes at the last sale, compared with an average of 19.3
percent at the past 10.  Seven-year notes have lost 2.2 percent this year, versus a
drop of 1.8 percent for Treasuries overall, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch indexes. The seven-year securities
returned 3.9 percent in 2012, while Treasuries overall gained
2.2 percent.  Today’s offering is the last of three note auctions this
week totaling $96 billion. The government sold $32 billion in
two-year debt on Oct. 27 and $35 billion in five-year securities
yesterday.  The Fed’s primary dealers trade government securities with
the central bank and are obligated to bid in Treasury auctions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
