Odontoprev SA (ODPV3) , a dental benefits
company, climbed the most in three weeks after profit beat
analysts’ forecasts as the company increased the number of plans
sold to individuals.  The shares  rose  1.1 percent to 9.01 reais at 2:02 p.m. in
Sao Paulo, the biggest gain on a closing basis since Oct. 8. The
BM&FBovespa Small Cap Index fell 0.4 percent.  Odontoprev is focusing on selling dental plans to consumers
and smaller businesses through bank branches after forming a
partnership with  Banco do Brasil SA (BBAS3) , founder Randal Zanetti said
in an interview June 11. The company bolstered its ability to
pursue the strategy when  Banco Bradesco SA (BBDC4)  agreed Oct. 14 to
raise its stake in Odontoprev to 50.01 percent.  “Growth is more dependent on contracts (primarily small
and medium enterprises) that could bear worse economics than
large corporate plans,” Thiago Macruz and Felipe Cruz, analysts
at Itau BBA, wrote in a research note to clients yesterday.  Odontoprev’s adjusted net income rose 22 percent in the
third quarter to 43.2 million reais ($19.8 million) from a year
earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares
with an average estimate of 41.9 million reais among five
analysts. The company released its results after the market
closed yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
