Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
widened after the U.S. reported  production  rose to a 16-month
high and inventories dropped to the lowest level on record.  The spread expanded 4 cents to 84.88 cents a gallon after
 output  increased 1.6 percent to 911,000 barrels a day in the
week ended Oct. 25, the most since June 8, 2012, according to
the Energy Information Administration. That was above the
907,000-barrel average of 11 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Inventories fell 3.5 percent to 15 million barrels,
the least in EIA data going back to 2010.  “In the end, concerns over low inventories prevailed,”
Chris Krukowski, an ethanol broker at SCB & Associates LLC, said
in a telephone interview from  Chicago . “Fuel demand is good,
and we’ve seen some activity in exports, too.”  Denatured ethanol for November delivery rose 0.1 percent to
$1.802 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Futures are down
18 percent this year.  November-delivery gasoline advanced 4.1 cents to close at
$2.6508 on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The contract covers
reformulated gasoline, made to be blended with ethanol before
delivery to filling stations.  RINs, certificates attached to each gallon of corn-based
ethanol that are submitted to the government and can be traded
among companies, gained 0.5 cent to 23 cents a gallon. Advanced
RINs, which cover biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-based
ethanol, rose 1 cent to 29 cents.  Corn for December delivery declined 1.75 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $4.3025 a bushel in Chicago, as U.S. output may soar
to a record 14 billion bushels from a year earlier, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said Sept. 12. The December crush
spread of corn to ethanol was 10 cents, up from 9 cents
yesterday.  In cash market trading, ethanol declined 4 cents to $1.89 a
gallon in Chicago, 3 cents to $2.015 in  New York , and 3 cents to
$1.97 on the  Gulf Coast , while it rose 4 cents to $2.075 a
gallon on the West Coast, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  West Coast ethanol’s premium to the Gulf rose by 7 cents to
10.5 cents, while Chicago’s discount to New York Harbor declined
1 cent to 12.5 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
