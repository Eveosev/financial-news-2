Sherwin-Williams Co. (SHW) , the largest
U.S. paint retailer, said  Mexico ’s antitrust regulator rejected
its appeal against an earlier ruling that blocked its bid for
paint maker Consorcio Comex SA.  Sherwin-Williams is reviewing the Federal Economic
Competition Commission of Mexico’s decision and is considering
its options, including possibly refiling with the regulator, the
Cleveland-based company said today in a statement.  Sherwin-Williams dropped 5.2 percent to $184.25 at 9:02
a.m. before the start of regular trading in New York.  The regulator voted three to two in July to reject Sherwin-Williams’ application, saying the combined company would be able
to set artificially high prices. If the takeover proceeded,
Sherwin-Williams would have had a market share of 48 percent to
58 percent in Mexico, depending on the product, or as much as 10
times the share of its closest competitor, the regulator said at
the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
