(Corrects gain in restaurants index in fifth paragraph.)  Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) , the world’s largest
coffee-shop chain, repeated a forecast for fiscal 2014 profit
that was lower than analysts’ estimates after sales gains slowed
in  Asia .  Profit excluding certain items will be as much as $2.65 a
share in the year ending in September, the Seattle-based company
said today in a statement, repeating guidance it gave in July.
Analysts projected $2.67, on average. Starbucks also said full-year sales will rise 10 percent or more, compared with a
previous forecast for growth of 10 percent to 13 percent.  Chief Executive Officer  Howard Schultz  has been expanding
in  China  to tap growing demand from coffee drinkers in the
world’s most-populous nation. Sales at Starbucks stores open at
least 13 months rose 8 percent in its China and Asia Pacific
region in the fiscal fourth quarter ended Sept. 29. That was
slower than the 9 percent gain in the third quarter and trailed
analysts’ average estimate for a 9.1 percent increase.  “Expectations were high going into the quarter,” Sharon Zackfia, analyst at William Blair & Co. in Chicago, said today
in an telephone interview.  Starbucks fell 2.2 percent to $79.08 at 5:45 p.m. in  New
York  after gaining 1.5 percent during regular trading. The
shares  climbed  51 percent this year through the close of regular
trading today, compared with a 21 percent gain for the  Standard
& Poor’s  500 Restaurants Index.  Net income  in the quarter increased to $481.1 million, or
63 cents a share, from $359 million, or 46 cents, a year
earlier, Starbucks said. Analysts estimated 60 cents a share,
the average of 27 projections compiled by Bloomberg.  Store Sales  Comparable-store sales rose 7 percent globally, topping the
6.7 percent average estimate of analysts surveyed by Consensus
Metrix, a researcher owned by Wayne, New Jersey-based Kaul
Advisory Group. Sales on that basis increased 8 percent in the
Americas and 2 percent in  Europe , the  Middle East  and Africa.
Analysts projected gains of 7.1 percent in the Americas and 1.7
percent in Europe.  “The U.S. has been consistently, phenomenally strong for
us,” Chief Financial Officer Troy Alstead said today in an
interview.  Same-store sales are considered an indicator of a
retailer’s growth because they include only older, established
locations.  Starbucks said today it plans to add 1,500 new locations in
its fiscal 2014, up from a previous projection for 1,400 new
stores. The company raised its quarterly dividend 24 percent to
26 cents a share from 21 cents.  To contact the reporters on this story:
