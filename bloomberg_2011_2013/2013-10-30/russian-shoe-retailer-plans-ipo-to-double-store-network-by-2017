Obuv Rossii , a Russian shoe
retailer, plans to sell up to 25 percent of its shares on the
Moscow Exchange as it raises funds to help double its store
network.  The company plans to raise as much as 2 billion rubles ($62
million) selling shares as soon as this year, owner and Chief
Executive Officer Anton Titov told reporters in Moscow today.
The IPO should help Obuv Rossii to increase its network to more
than 640 stores in 2017 from 260 now, he said.  Obuv Rossii, based in the Siberian city of Novosibirsk,
produces shoes in  China  and  Russia . The company operates stores
under the Westfalika brand and seeks to become the Russian
market leader in the mid-price segment, Titov said.  The Russian shoe market reached $30.7 billion last year and
will grow as the country is lagging behind others in per-capita
consumption, according to Discovery Research Group. Russians buy
three pairs of shoes a year versus as many as six pairs in
Europe and eight in the U.S., Discovery’s data shows.  Obuv Rossii’s sales rose 61 percent in the nine months
through September to 2.97 billion rubles, while its margin on
earnings before taxes, interest, depreciation and amortization
was 18 percent, according to a statement handed out today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
