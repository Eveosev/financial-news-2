The World Federation of Exchanges,
the trade group for 62 markets, will leave Paris for London to
boost its clout with investors, regulators and financial
services firms.  WFE, which has been based in  France  since 1961, will move
by the end of the year, Chief Executive Officer Huseyin Erkan
said in an interview. Members of the association voted to
approve the change at its annual convention in Mexico City
yesterday.  The lobby group represents the world’s largest exchanges,
including  Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1)  and CME Group Inc., and emerging-market bourses such as the Kazakhstan Stock Exchange. The agency
has sought to increase its influence with regulators as market
structure comes under greater scrutiny after the global
financial crisis.  “Our ultimate goal is to transform WFE into a more
outward-looking organization, actively engaged with the
financial industry,” Erkan said. “The WFE’s presence in London
will place us in close proximity to many of our members’
operations, as well as to the global financial media, and will
facilitate our interactions with the major sell side and buy
side of the markets as well as other stakeholders of our
industry.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
