Ports dating back to the Napoleonic
campaigns go on sale at a Christie’s International Plc auction
in Geneva next month, along with bottles from the First and
Second World Wars and more recent vintages from the 1960s.  A bottle of Macedo Porto Vieux Garrafeira 1808, from the
period when the Portuguese royal family was exiled in Brazil and
French forces were fighting in  Spain , carries a top estimate of
4,500 Swiss francs ($5,000), according to Christie’s  catalog . A
bottle of Manoel Beleza de Andrade 1812, dating from the year of
Napoleon’s retreat from Moscow, carries the same price tag.  The sale includes more than 50 bottles of port spanning
every decade of the 19th century, as well as a similar range
from the first half of the 20th century, amid demand from
collectors for historic ports with established provenance. While
prices of younger wines from the 1980s and 1990s have been
capped at auction by the financial crisis since 2008, older
vintages can command a rarity premium.  “There’s a steady throughput of vintage ports from the
’60s, from the ’40s, from the ’50s,” Paul Symington, Chairman
of Symington Family Estates, said in an interview. “Those
prices have been rising steadily of the very rare, old wines.
They’ve definitely stabilized out.” Symington owns Cockburn’s,
Warre’s, Graham’s and Dow’s and traces its roots back to 1652.  Waterloo Vintage  Five bottles from 1815, the year of Napoleon’s defeat at
Waterloo, carry an upper estimate of 4,500 francs each, three
from F. Chamisso Filho et Silva, Porto Rex and two from Antonia
A. Ferreira, Porto, according to Christie’s.  A two-bottle lot from 1917, one a Cockburn’s vintage and
the other a Quinta Da Faisca, Porto Favios, has a top estimate
of 800 francs while a bottle of Real Royal Companhia Velha,
Porto 1945 is priced to fetch as much as 500 francs.  More recent vintages include a three-bottle lot from 1963,
one a Taylor’s Fladgate & Yeatman, a second a Niepoort Vintage
and a third a Niepoort Colheita, with a combined top estimate of
550 francs, according to Christie’s.  The sale comes as demand for mature Port vintages has been
evident at auctions, with cases of Dow’s ’63 selling in  London 
this year at 1,092 pounds ($1,760) at Bonhams in July, according
to the Liv-ex market’s Cellar Watch website.  2011 Vintage  A case of Graham’s ’77 sold at Bonhams in London in July
for 517 pounds while three cases of the same vintage fetched
between 585 pounds and 702 pounds at Christie’s in London in
May, according to Cellar Watch data.  The port market this year has been focused on the sales
campaign for 2011 ports, which “sold particularly well,”
according to a July report by London wine merchant  Fine+Rare .
That may give the vintage a boost in the auction market in
coming years as supplies dwindle.  “One of the results of the recession was that the vintage
ports from the ’80s and ’90s have not increased in value at
auction,” Symington said. “The 2011’s over the next five to 10
years will strengthen quite significantly because we have none
left. It’s all sold out.”  Port shippers declare vintage years such as 2011 and 2007
approximately three times a decade, based on the quality and
aging potential of the wines, with past vintages including 1963,
1977, 1983 and 1992.  Apart from rare ports, the Christie’s sale in Geneva, on
Nov. 12 and Nov. 13, includes historic Madeira wines as well as
magnums of Bordeaux, including Chateau Lafite Rothschild 1947
and Chateau Haut-Brion 1929, according to the auction house.  Here is a list of global wine auctions scheduled so far
this year. Dates may be subject to revision, and links are to
