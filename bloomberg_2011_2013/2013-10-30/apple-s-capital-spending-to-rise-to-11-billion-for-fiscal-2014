Apple Inc. (AAPL)  plans to increase
spending on manufacturing equipment, product testing and retail
stores by 57 percent in fiscal 2014 as it ramps up the output of
iPhones, iPads and potential new products.  Capital expenditures will jump to $11 billion in the
current year, which ends in September 2014, from $7 billion last
year, Apple said yesterday in a  regulatory filing . About $550
million of the spending will go toward retail operations,
including the opening of 30 new stores and remodeling 20 others.  The higher spending suggests Apple may exceed some
analysts’ sales estimates in 2014 amid strong demand for updated
versions of the iPhone and iPad, according to  Ben Reitzes , an
analyst at Barclays Plc. Revenue growth may top 8 percent this
year, he wrote in a note. That would indicate more than $184.6
billion in sales, compared with $170.9 billion last year.  Apple has been known to spend on customized equipment and
tools needed to add new features to its products. In one  example 
reported in Bloomberg Businessweek in 2011, Apple used lasers to
make a green light illuminate through its Mac computers’
aluminum case to indicate when the camera is on.  In recent years, the company’s capital expenditures have
provided a window into how many iPhones and iPads it will sell,
according to Horace Dediu, who has studied the trend on his
market-analysis website, Asymco.com. If the  pattern  holds, Apple
will sell 250 million to 285 million iPhones, iPads and iPod
Touches for the year, according to Dediu.  New equipment also may be used for unreleased products.
Earlier this week, Apple Chief Executive Officer  Tim Cook  said
the company is working on new releases in technology categories
where it doesn’t yet compete.  Capital spending is separate from research and development
costs, which Apple said were $4.5 billion last year, up from
$3.4 billion in 2012 and $2.4 billion in 2011.  In the filing, Apple also said it had 80,300 full-time
employees as of Sept. 28, with almost 43,000 of those in retail.
The company had 72,800 full-time employees a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
