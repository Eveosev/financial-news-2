IDB Holding Corp. (IDBH) ’s 2020 bonds
climbed to a 17-month high before a court deadline next week to
submit bids for the company whose estimated asset value was
increased.  The yield on Tel Aviv-based IDB’s 1.07 billion shekels
($304 million) of 5.1 percent bonds due in December 2020 slumped
224 basis points, or 2.44 percentage points, to 43.28 percent at
3:43 p.m. in Tel Aviv. The yield has dropped 924basis points
this month, headed for the biggest monthly decline since
January.  Debtholders have until Nov. 3 to put in proposals for a
debt repayment plan as Israeli businessman Nochi Dankner
struggles to repay 2 billion shekels. The controlling
shareholder is seeking to retain his grip on the company he
spent 15 years building as rivals, including Argentine Eduardo Elsztain and an investor group led by  George W. Bush ’s brother
Neil, seek to wrest control.  “The fate of IDB is approaching and even if Dankner
doesn’t remain within the group, there are investors lined to
take control of the group’s good companies,” Avihay Hermon, a
trader at  Israel  Discount Bank Ltd. in Tel Aviv, said by phone.
“This week’s improved company valuation is also positive ahead
of the deadline for the submission of bids.”  The average net asset value of IDB’s unit, IDB Development
Corp., was raised to as much as 1.1 billion shekels from 944
million shekels, according to an updated valuation report filed
by a court-appointed official. The holding company indirectly
controls Israel’s biggest supermarket chain,  Shufersal Ltd. (SAE) , and
largest mobile operator,  Cellcom Israel Ltd. (CEL)   Dankner turned a family business that made its fortune in
table salt and real estate into a sprawling holding company. The
combination of unprofitable investments and regulations to boost
competition, cut IDB’s market value to 302 million shekels from
5.06 billion shekels at the end of 2010, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
