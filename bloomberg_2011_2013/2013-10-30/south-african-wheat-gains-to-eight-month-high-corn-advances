South African wheat futures rose to
the highest level in more than eight months by the noon close on
the South African Futures Exchange. Corn also gained.  Wheat for December delivery, the most active contract,
climbed 0.5 percent to 3,500 rand ($354) a metric ton in
Johannesburg, the highest level for the contract since Feb. 5.  South Africa , a net importer of wheat, is sub-Saharan
 Africa ’s largest producer of the grain after  Ethiopia  and the
region’s biggest buyer after Nigeria and Sudan, according to
U.S. Department of Agriculture data.  Yellow corn for delivery in December surged 1.4 percent to
2,286 rand a ton and the white variety for the same delivery
month rose 0.3 percent to 2,386 rand a ton.  The nation is the continent’s biggest corn producer. A meal
made from white corn is a staple food in the nation and the
yellow variety is mostly fed to animals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
