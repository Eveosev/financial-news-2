Genel Energy Plc (GENL) , the biggest oil
producer in the Kurdistan region of northern  Iraq , said output
will rise more than 50 percent when a new export pipeline to
Turkey becomes operational next year.  “If we had the pipeline immediately, we could get to
80,000 barrels” a day, Chief Financial Officer Julian Metherell
said in a telephone interview. Output was about 53,000 barrels a
day in the third quarter, the company said today in a statement.  The new pipeline, undergoing commissioning, will give
Kurdistan unhindered access to international markets for the
first time after years of disputes with the government in
 Baghdad  over export revenue. Genel has so far had to use trucks
to send oil into neighboring  Turkey , where it receives higher
prices than in Iraq.  Genel will be able to increase production further once its
two biggest fields, Taq Taq and Tawke, ramp up to 200,000
barrels a day each, of which 140,000 barrels are net to Genel,
Metherell said. The Jersey, Channel Islands-based company
maintained its forecast for 2013 production of 45,000 barrels to
55,000 barrels a day.  Genel has $805 million in cash on its books that may be
returned to shareholders once the pipeline starts, depending on
whether the company finds a partner for its Miran gas
development and whether it raises debt, Metherell said. Genel is
currently debt-free.  While the company may also consider acquisitions, the
returns on its current assets are “difficult to beat in the
mergers and acquisitions market,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
