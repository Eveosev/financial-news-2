South Korea’s won closed 0.6 percent
off a two-year high before a Federal Reserve meeting to review
its record monetary stimulus.  Government bonds  rose.  Industrial output fell 3.6 percent last month from a year
earlier, compared with the median estimate of a 1.9 percent gain
in a Bloomberg survey, official data showed today. The pace of
the nation’s economic recovery is weak, Finance Minister Hyun Oh
Seok said in Seoul. The  Federal Open Market Committee , which
will meet later today, will start paring its $85 billion of
monthly bond purchases only in March, according to a Bloomberg
survey of analysts.  “Investors are not making any risky moves before the
FOMC,” said Son Eun Jeong, currency analyst at Woori Futures
Co. in Seoul. “The expectation that tapering will be delayed is
already priced in, and more clear direction will be set after
the meeting.”  The won closed at 1,060.30 per dollar in  Seoul , compared
with 1,060.62 yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency touched 1,054.35 on Oct. 24, the
strongest level since August 2011. One-month implied volatility,
a measure of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price
options, dropped three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point,
to 5.87 percent.  Industrial output declined in September due to strikes at
Hyundai Motor Co. and Kia Motors Corp., and a reduced number of
working days because of the Chuseok holidays, said Lee Hyoung
Il, director at the  Finance Ministry ’s Economic Policy Bureau.  The yield on the government’s 2.75 percent sovereign bonds
due June 2016 fell three basis points to a four-month low of
2.78 percent, according to Korea Exchange Inc. prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
