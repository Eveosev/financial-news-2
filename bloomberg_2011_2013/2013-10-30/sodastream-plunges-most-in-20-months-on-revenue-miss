SodaStream International Ltd. (SODA) , the
Israeli maker of home soda machines, plunged the most since
February 2012 after the company reported third-quarter sales
that trailed analyst estimates.  Shares of Lod, Israel-based SodaStream sank 10 percent to
$57.16 at 2:14 p.m. in New York. About 2.9 million shares
traded, more than three times the average volume during the last
90 days. Ten-day  volatility  on the stock tripled to 57.6 today,
the highest since August.  Revenue for the three-month period ending Sept. 30 was
$144.6 million, SodaStream said today, below the $145.2 million
mean estimate of nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. It was the
first time that SodaStream missed analyst  estimates  on on
revenue since the company’s initial public offering in November
of 2010. Net income fell 2.2 percent to $16.39 million from a
year ago, the company said.  “The stock will be weak today given the lack of a beat on
the top line and the lack of a raise to guidance,” Wendy Nicholson, an analyst at Citigroup Global Markets Group Inc.,
wrote in a note to clients today. “For a company that is
putting up such strong growth, we think the stock deserves to
trade even higher than its current valuation. We would take
weakness in the stock today as a buying opportunity.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
