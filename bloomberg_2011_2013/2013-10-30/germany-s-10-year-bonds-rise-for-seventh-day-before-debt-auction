Germany ’s government bonds rose,
with 10-year securities gaining for a seventh day, as economists
predicted the U.S. Federal Reserve will maintain debt purchases
at a policy meeting ending today.  Benchmark bunds  extended their winning streak to the
longest in more than two years as a report showed Germany’s
annual inflation rate slowed to the least since April. German
borrowing costs fell to the lowest since July at a sale of 10-year debt. Italy’s  bonds  dropped as the nation sold 6 billion
euros ($8.25 billion) of five- and 10-year securities. Spanish
securities also declined, reversing gains that were spurred by
data showing the economy exited recession last quarter.  “We’ve seen the highs for core rates this year and the
path of least resistance is lower,” said  Padhraic Garvey , head
of developed-market bonds strategy at ING Groep NV in Amsterdam.
“The situation in the euro zone has improved but remains weak.
U.S. tapering is not really a story for this year.”  Germany’s 10-year yield fell five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 1.69 percent at 4:30 p.m. in London, the
lowest level since Aug. 12. The 2 percent bund due in August
2023 rose 0.465, or 4.65 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to
102.775. The winning streak is the longest since the period
ended Aug. 4, 2011.  The benchmark yield has dropped eight basis points this
month, extending a decline from 2.09 percent on Sept. 11, which
was the  highest  since December 2011.  Fed Decision  The Fed will keep purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities at $85 billion a month until March, according
to a Bloomberg News survey of analysts on Oct. 17-18. The
Federal Open Market Committee refrained from reducing stimulus
last month, saying it was waiting for further evidence of
economic recovery.  Germany’s annualized  inflation rate , calculated using a
harmonized European Union method, dropped to 1.3 percent this
month from 1.6 percent in September, the Federal Statistics
Office said. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey was for
1.5 percent. Slower inflation helps preserve the purchasing
power of the fixed payments from bonds.  Germany’s 10-year  break-even rate  narrowed two basis points
to 1.63 percentage points. The rate, a gauge of inflation
expectations that is derived from the yield difference between
bunds and index-linked securities, has averaged 1.7 percentage
points this year.  Germany allotted 3.41 billion euros of bonds maturing in
August 2023 at an average yield of 1.71 percent, the lowest
since an auction on July 17. The nation last sold 10-year debt
on Oct. 2 at 1.79 percent.  Most Volatile  Italy  sold 3 billion euros of bonds maturing in March 2024
at an average yield of 4.11 percent, down from 4.50 percent at a
previous auction on Sept. 27. The Rome-based Treasury also sold
billion euros of five-year notes at 2.89 percent, versus 3.38
percent last month.  Italian 10-year yields climbed four basis points to 4.18
percent after falling to 4.09 percent on Oct. 23, the lowest
level since June 5.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Italy’s 10-year
bonds over German bunds widened nine basis points to 249 basis
points after expanding beyond 250 basis points for the first
time since Oct. 10.  Spanish Bonds  Spanish bonds advanced in earlier trading after the Madrid-based National Statistics Institute said  gross domestic product 
rose 0.1 percent from the second quarter, when it fell 0.1
percent, matching the central bank’s Oct. 23 estimate.  Spain’s  10-year yield  dropped as much as two basis points
to 4.02 percent, the lowest since May 6, before rising two basis
points to 4.06 percent.  The Spanish government pays interest and bond maturities of
about 21 billion euros tomorrow.  “Looking forward is not as benign as we’ve had it over the
last couple of days when we were still waiting for the
redemption and coupon payments to be recycled,” said  David Schnautz , a fixed-income strategist at Commerzbank AG in New
York. Spain’s GDP data showed “no upside surprise to what we
were expecting in terms of growth. We are certainly not yet out
of the woods.”  Volatility on Finnish bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today, followed by those of Germany and  Austria ,
according to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between
two- and 10-year securities and credit-default swaps.  German securities handed investors a loss of 1.3 percent
this year through yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond
Indexes. Spain’s gained 11 percent and Italy’s rose 6.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
