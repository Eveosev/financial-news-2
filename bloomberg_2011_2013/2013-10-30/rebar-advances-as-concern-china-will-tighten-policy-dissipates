Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  climbed as concern that  China ’s central bank would
start tightening monetary policy abated.  Rebar for delivery in May, the most-active contract by
volume on the Shanghai Futures Exchange, rose as much as 0.4
percent to 3,622 yuan ($595) a metric ton and was at 3,614 yuan
at 10:41 a.m. local time.  The nation’s benchmark  equity index  sank to a seven-week
low yesterday as higher short-term borrowing costs sparked
speculation the People’s Bank of China was tightening policy.
The concern appears to be overblown, said Lilian Leung, who
manages almost $1 billion at JPMorgan Asset Management Ltd. in
Hong Kong. China is stabilizing and the rise in money-market
rates to three-month highs reflects end-of-month cash demand and
tax payments, Leung said.  “More investors jumped back into rebar and iron ore
futures as concern about policy tightening seems to have
dissipated,” said Wang Yongliang, an analyst at Beijing Cifco
Futures Co. in Tianjin.  Iron ore futures for May delivery on the Dalian Commodity
Exchange fell 0.1 percent to 920  yuan  a ton.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port, tracked by
the Steel Index, lost 0.4 percent to $131.30 a dry ton
yesterday.  The spot price of rebar was little changed at 3,483 yuan a
ton yesterday, according to Beijing Antaike Information
Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
