Germany ’s grid would be stable even
if renewables were the only sources of energy, a clean-power
group said.  A research project that combined wind, solar and biogas
plants into one virtual 80-megawatt power station showed the
grid would be able to maintain a constant flow of electricity,
the  Renewable Energies Agency  said today in a statement.  Germany is seeking to get 80 percent of its power from
renewables by 2050 from about 23 percent now, helping to counter
a decline in electricity supply as nuclear reactors close
following the Fukushima disaster in Japan. The shift to clean
energy has raised concern that the intermittent power provided
by wind and solar parks would destabilize the grid.  “Renewables will, together with storage units, be able to
meet demand at any time and ensure a stable frequency and
voltage if linked and steered via combined-cycle power plants,”
said Kurt Rohrig, deputy head of Germany’s Fraunhofer IWES
science center, which took part in the research project.  The Renewable Energies Agency is funded by clean-energy
companies and two federal ministries.  Siemens AG (SIE) ,  SMA Solar
Technology AG (S92)  and  Solarworld AG (SWV)  were also participants in the
three-year research program.  Germany’s future energy mix is a key topic in talks between
 Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s conservative bloc and the Social
Democrats as they negotiate a possible coalition following Sept.
22 elections.  To contact the reporter on this story:
