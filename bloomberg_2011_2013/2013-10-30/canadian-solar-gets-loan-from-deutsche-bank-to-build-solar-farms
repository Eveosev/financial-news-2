Canadian Solar Inc. (CSIQ) , North Americaâ€™s
biggest solar manufacturer, secured a C$104 million ($99
million) loan from Deutsche Bank AG to build three solar farms
in  Canada .  The non-recourse, construction financing will fund the 30
megawatts of projects that are expected to be built and
connected in Ontario through 2014, the Guelph, Ontario-based
company said today in a statement.  The projects will sell electricity to the Ontario Power
Authority under 20-year contracts, Canadian Solar said. The
company got a C$139 million loan from the bank last year.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
