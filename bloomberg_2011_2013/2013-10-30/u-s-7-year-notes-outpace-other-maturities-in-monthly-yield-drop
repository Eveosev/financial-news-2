Treasuries rose, with seven-year
yields falling to the lowest level in four months, amid
speculation subdued inflation and slowing growth will boost
demand at a sale of $29 billion of the securities today.  Benchmark  10-year yields  dropped toward a three-month low
after ADP Research Institute said U.S. companies added the
fewest workers this month since April and the  consumer price
index  in September gained the least year-to-year in five months.
Federal Reserve policy makers end a two-day meeting today at
which they will maintain monthly asset purchases at $85 billion,
according to a Bloomberg News survey of economists.  “The ADP gave us an excuse to break through the 2.50
percent level, the CPI data was generally bond friendly,” said
Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income strategist at Janney Montgomery
Scott LLC in Philadelphia, which oversees $11 billion in fixed
income assets. “Every market participant knows that October was
a tough month for the jobs market.”  The  seven-year yield  declined three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 1.85 percent at 11:57 a.m. in  New York ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices, the least since June
21. The 2 percent note due in September 2020 rose 5/32, or $1.56
per $1,000 face amount, to 100 30/32.  The U.S.  10-year yield  fell two basis points to 2.48
percent. It dropped to 2.47 percent on Oct. 23, the lowest level
since July 22.  ‘Macroeconomic Disappointments’  The median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg is
for 10-year yields to rise to 2.76 percent by Dec. 31.  The seven-day  relative strength  index for the Treasury 10-year note yield was at 28.7 today, down from 31.3 yesterday,
according to Bloomberg data. A reading lower than 30 or above 70
suggests the security may be poised for a change in direction.  The seven-year notes scheduled for sale today yielded 1.90
percent in pre-auction trading, compared with 2.058 percent at
the previous auction on Sept. 26. Investors bid for 2.46 times
the amount available last month, versus 2.43 times in August.  Today’s sale of seven-year securities is the last of three
note auctions this week totaling $96 billion. Auctions of  two- 
and  five-year  debt drew the lowest yields since May.  “We’re in a period where we could see macroeconomic
disappointments, and tapering has been also moved further out by
the market in their pricing,” said Niels From, chief analyst at
Nordea Bank AB in Copenhagen. “It’s an environment that is
supportive for Treasuries.”  Job Gains  Treasuries returned 1.8 percent since Sept. 17, according
to Bloomberg World Bond  Indexes. (BUSY)  That’s the day before the
 Federal Open Market Committee  unexpectedly refrained from
reducing stimulus, saying it needed more evidence of lasting
improvement in the economy. The securities have lost 1.7 percent
this year through yesterday.  The 130,000 in jobs gains was down from 145,000 in
September, which was revised lower, figures from Roseland, New
Jersey-based ADP showed. The median forecast of 39 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg called for an advance of 150,000, and the
average for the past 10 months is 157,200.  The Fed will maintain monthly purchases of Treasuries at
$45 billion and mortgage-backed securities at $40 billion until
its March meeting, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists
on Oct. 17-18.  Ben S. Bernanke ’s term as Fed chairman ends on Jan. 31, and
President  Barack Obama  has nominated Vice Chairman  Janet Yellen 
as his successor.  ‘Baseline Scenario’  “As Yellen is about to chair the FOMC from January 2014,
the option to hold both MBS and Treasury securities until they
mature seems to be the baseline scenario as of now,”  Vincent Chaigneau , head of fixed-income and foreign-exchange strategy at
Societe Generale SA, wrote in a research note today about the
Fed meeting.  The consumer price index increased 0.2 percent, matching
the median forecast of 86 economists surveyed by Bloomberg,
after rising 0.1 percent the prior month, Labor Department data
showed in  Washington . Stripping out volatile food and fuel, the
so-called core measure climbed 0.1 percent for a second month,
less than projected.  Overall consumer prices increased 1.2 percent in the 12
months through September, the smallest gain since April, after a
1.5 percent year-over-year advance the prior month  Price swings in Treasuries as measured by Bank of America
Merrill Lynch’s MOVE Index dropped to 58.54 on Oct. 28, the
lowest level since May 16. It climbed to 58.81 yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
