West Texas Intermediate crude’s
discount to Brent reached the widest point in almost seven
months on rising U.S. inventories and declining Libyan output.  WTI fell to a four-month low after the Energy Information
Administration said  supplies  rose 4.09 million barrels to 383.9
million last week. A 2.4 million-barrel  gain  was the  median
estimate  of 11 analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Stockpiles at
Cushing,  Oklahoma , where WTI is delivered, advanced 2.18 million
barrels to 35.5 million, a two-month high. Brent oil traded in
 London  extended its premium to the U.S. grade by more than $2.  “We’re actually moving on the fundamentals,” said  Kyle Cooper , director of commodities research at IAF Advisors in
Houston. “There’s an awful lot of crude in the U.S. as a whole
and at Cushing, which is putting pressure on WTI, while the
problems in Libya are pushing Brent higher.”  Brent for December delivery settled $13.09 higher than WTI,
the most since April 2. WTI for December delivery declined
$1.43, or 1.5 percent, to $96.77 a barrel on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The European benchmark rose 85 cents, or
0.8 percent, to end the session at $109.86 a barrel on the
London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  ‘Seems Excessive’  The $2.28 widening of the spread was the biggest movement
in Brent’s direction against WTI in two years. The price
difference in 2013 has ranged from a $23.44 premium for Brent to
an 8-cent advantage for WTI.  “The WTI-Brent spread widened because of the backup in
supply at Cushing and the problems in  Libya ,” said Tom Finlon,
director of Energy Analytics Group LLC based in Jupiter,
 Florida . “A move of more than $2 seems excessive, though.”  Nationwide crude supplies gained 7.9 percent in the six
weeks ended Oct. 25, according to the EIA, the Energy
Department’s statistical arm. The U.S. will account for about 21
percent of global oil demand this year, almost double the
estimate for  China , the second-largest consumer, according to
forecasts from the  International Energy Agency  in Paris.  Crude production  declined 43,000 barrels a day to 7.85
million. Output has surged to the highest level since 1989 as
the combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing,
or fracking, has unlocked supplies trapped in shale formations
in the central U.S.  Refinery Operations  Refineries operated  at 87.3 percent of capacity, up 1.4
percentage points from the prior week. Utilization rates usually
peak during the summer months when U.S. gasoline demand rises
and decline in September and October.  “The outsized crude builds should moderate as refinery
activity rises in November,” said  John Kilduff , a partner at
Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund that focuses on
energy.  Gasoline stockpiles dropped 1.71 million barrels to 213.8
million, the least of 2013. Supplies of  distillate fuel , a
category that includes heating oil and diesel, declined 3.06
million barrels to 122.7 million.  Total  fuel supplied,  a measure of demand, climbed 10
percent to 20.1 million barrels a day last week, the most since
June, the report showed. Distillate consumption surged 25
percent to 4.16 million barrels a day, the biggest one-week gain
since January 2004, while gasoline demand increased 2.9 percent
to 9.05 million barrels a day.  “The demand numbers look much stronger than a week ago,”
said  Tim Evans , an energy analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in
New York. “I don’t see this rate of increases continuing.”  Fuel Prices  Gasoline for November delivery gained 4.1 cents, or 1.6
percent, to settle at $2.6508 a gallon in New York. Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for November delivery rose 1.45 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $2.9786 a gallon.  The profit from making fuel has gained after the report’s
release. The  margin  as expressed by the so-called crack spread
climbed to the highest level since August. The profit to process
three barrels of oil into two of gasoline and one of heating
oil, based on New York futures, rose $2.425 to $18.238 a barrel
at 3:41 p.m.  “This is a mixed report,” Kilduff said. “The report is
bullish for the crack spread, which should induce refiners to
step up refinery utilization rates. This should lead to an end
of the precipitous declines in product supplies.”  Libyan Production  Libya can’t restart its 350,000-barrel-a-day Sharara field,
Moftah Alamin, a spokesman for Tuareg protesters, said by phone
yesterday. Tuareg nomads pressing for official recognition of
their language and greater political rights have halted flows
from the field, one of Libya’s biggest.  Production in the African country fell to less than 300,000
barrels a day from more than 600,000 on Oct. 21, Mohamed El
Elharari, a spokesman for Tripoli-based National Oil Corp., said
in a phone interview on Oct. 28.  The  Federal Reserve  decided to press on with $85 billion in
monthly bond purchases, saying it needs to see more evidence
that the economy will continue to improve. The Fed’s buying will
remain divided between $40 billion a month of mortgage bonds and
$45 billion in  Treasury securities .  The central bank left unchanged its statement that it will
probably hold its target interest rate near zero “at least as
long as” unemployment exceeds 6.5 percent, so long as the
outlook for inflation is no higher than 2.5 percent.  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
December was 19.7 percent, up from 19.5 percent yesterday,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 576,333
contracts as of 3:40 p.m. It totaled 361,410 contracts
yesterday, 38 percent below the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.77 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
