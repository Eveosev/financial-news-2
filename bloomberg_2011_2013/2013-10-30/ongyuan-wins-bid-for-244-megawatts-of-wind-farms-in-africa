China Longyuan Power Group Corp. (916) ,
the nation’s biggest wind farm operator, won a bid to jointly
develop two projects totaling 244 megawatts in South Africa with
local companies.  Longyuan will be the controlling shareholder of a 100-megawatt wind farm and another 144-megawatt project in the
African nation, according to a  statement  on its website. The
projects will use turbines with unit capacity of 1.5 megawatts
from unit Guodian United Power Technology Co.  The bid is part of the Beijing-based company’s strategy of
“going global.” Longyuan said in August that it will start
construction of a 100-megawatt wind farm in Ontario,  Canada , in
the second half and advance preliminary work for projects in
countries such as the U.S.,  South Africa  and Australia.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
