InterOil Corp. (IOC)  founder and former
Chief Executive Officer Phil Mulacek was sued in Singapore and
accused of failing to pay for private jet services for the
natural gas explorer’s use in  Papua New Guinea  and  Indonesia .  Danial Higgins claimed in a lawsuit filed in Singapore High
Court that Mulacek and Carlo Civelli, managing director of
Clarion Finanz AG, owe him $451,025 and interest for consulting
and piloting work. A closed hearing is scheduled for today.  Mulacek and Civelli bought a used Gulfstream jet for $2.26
million through AirLNG Ltd., a company owned by Civelli, to meet
the travel requirements of InterOil, Higgins said in court
documents. The three men struck an oral agreement in January
2012 for Higgins to service and operate the aircraft, according
to court documents.  Mulacek and Civelli denied Higgins’s claims in court
filings. The fees Higgins is seeking to recover were included in
an aircraft management service agreement they had with Higgins’s
company, they said.  Higgins’s incompetence and negligence had caused the
aircraft to be deregistered, Mulacek and Civelli said in their
papers, resulting in the plane having to be re-registered.  Higgins denied that, and claimed that Mulacek had told him
the plane’s ownership shouldn’t be associated with InterOil due
to concerns shareholders may raise over unnecessary expenses.  InterOil Uninvolved  “It’s a matter between Mr. Mulacek and Mr. Higgins and
doesn’t involve InterOil,” said John Hurst, a spokesman for
InterOil, based in Whitehorse, Yukon Territory and run from
Cairns,  Australia . “InterOil has not used aircraft services
involving Mr. Higgins.”  Salem Ibrahim, a lawyer representing Mulacek and Civelli,
declined to comment as the case is before the courts. Higgins’s
lawyer, Peter Low, declined to comment.  InterOil said in August its discussions with  Exxon Mobil
Corp. (XOM)  to develop natural gas discoveries in Papua New Guinea
were continuing.  InterOil has been searching for international partners to
help fund a Papua New Guinea natural gas project since 2009,
when  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) ’s Merrill Lynch sold its 35 percent
stake in the venture.  Mulacek retired in April and remains on the  board  of
InterOil.  The case is Danial Patrick Higgins v Phil Emanuel Mulacek,
S244/2013.  Singapore  High Court.  To contact the reporter on this story:
