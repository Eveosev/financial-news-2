Russian soccer club CSKA Moscow must
play its next Champions League game in a partially empty stadium
after its fans racially abused  Manchester City ’s Yaya Toure
during a match last week.  UEFA, European soccer’s governing body, said in a statement
on its website that the sanction was issued because of the
“racist behavior of CSKA supporters” during City’s 2-1
Champions League win. CSKA hosts  Bayern Munich  in its next
Champions League home match on Nov. 27.  UEFA also said a separate investigation found referee
Ovidiu Hategan’s handling of the matter followed the governing
body’s procedure for dealing with racist incidents.  Hategan heard the chants and requested the fourth official
ask for an announcement to be made to the fans.  The fourth official then made the request to the venue
director, who hadn’t heard the chanting and didn’t make the
announcement, UEFA said. As the chants had stopped, Hategan
resumed the match.  UEFA said the venue manager acted inappropriately, though
in good faith, and has been relieved of his duties.  Sepp Blatter, the president of soccer’s global governing
body FIFA, told an audience in  London  on Oct. 26 that banning
fans from stadiums is “nonsense” and an ineffective way of
fighting racism. FIFA General Secretary  Jerome Valcke  told
reporters he would question 2018 World Cup host  Russia  about the
issue during meetings in Moscow this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
