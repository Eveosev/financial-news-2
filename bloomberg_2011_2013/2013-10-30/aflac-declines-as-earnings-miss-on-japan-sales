Aflac Inc. (AFL) , the largest provider of
supplemental health insurance, declined the most in six months
after third-quarter profit fell and sales disappointed analysts.  Aflac dropped $2 or 3 percent to $65 at 9:36 a.m. in New
York. The slump pared the Columbus, Georgia-based insurer’s gain
for the year to 22 percent.  Third-quarter net income dropped 31 percent to $702
million, the company said in a statement late yesterday.
Operating profit, which excludes some investment results, was
$1.47 a share, missing by one cent the average estimate of 21
analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  The insurer has been hurt by “the lack of a new,
blockbuster product that can propel growth in  Japan  for several
quarters more,” RBC Capital Markets analysts led by  Eric Berg 
said today in a note to investors. “It is also discouraging
that there does not seem to be any turnaround under way in the
U.S business despite the sluggish but nonetheless real
improvement in the U.S. economy.”  New annualized premium sales in Japan fell 42 percent in
the quarter to 32.4 billion yen ($330 million). In the U.S.,
sales fell 1.5 percent to $330 million. The insurer reached a
deal in July with Japan Post to sell policies in as many as
20,000 post offices.  “It will take time for sales volumes to be meaningfully
impacted” by the arrangement in Japan, the company’s largest
market, Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP analysts led by Ed Shields
said in a note yesterday.  Aflac yesterday projected 2014 earnings of $6.28 to $6.52 a
share. That compares with the Sandler analysts’ estimate of
$6.50.  “This guidance may disappoint investors,” they wrote.  To contact the reporters on this story:
