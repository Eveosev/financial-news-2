LeBron James scored 17 points to
lead the two-time National Basketball Association champion  Miami
Heat  to a 107-95 victory against the Chicago Bulls, while the
Indiana Pacers topped the Orlando Magic 97-87.  In last night’s other season-opening game, the Los Angeles
Lakers defeated the Los Angeles Clippers 116-103 as Xavier Henry
came off the bench to score 22 points and reserve Jordan Farmar
added 16 at Staples Center. Blake Griffin scored 19 and DeAndre Jordan had 17 points and 11 rebounds for the Clippers.  The Heat jumped out to a 54-33 halftime lead at
AmericanAirlines Arena in Miami. Shane Battier’s 3-pointer late
in the first quarter started a 13-point run for the hosts and
the Heat had a 17-point run later in the half.  “It’s a team game,” James told reporters. “That’s what
this team is put together for.”  Chris Bosh  scored 16 points, followed by Battier with 14
and Mario Chalmers and  Dwyane Wade  with 13 points each for the
Heat, who received their championship rings during a pregame
ceremony.  The Bulls were led by  Carlos Boozer  with 31 points and 20
by Jimmy Butler. Derrick Rose, who was the NBA’s Most Valuable
Player three years ago and missed all of last season following
knee surgery, was 4-for-15 from the field and scored 12 points.  At Bankers Life Fieldhouse in Indianapolis,  Paul George 
scored 24 points and Lance Stephenson added 19 for the Pacers,
who trailed by four points at halftime before outscoring the
Magic by 14 points in the second half.  Andrew Nicholson came off the bench to score 18 points for
the Magic, Maurice Harkless had 14 points and  Jameer Nelson  and
Victor Oladipo, the second overall selection in the 2013 NBA
draft, each added 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
