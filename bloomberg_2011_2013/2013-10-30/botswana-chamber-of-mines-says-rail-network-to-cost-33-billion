Botswana’s Chamber of Mines said a
planned heavy-haulage railway network to ship coal from the
landlocked country to ports will cost about $33 billion.  “The railway lines are very, very important to us,”
Charles Siwawa, the chamber’s chief executive officer, said
today in an interview in Johannesburg. “They will take us to
the next level of our development.”  Southern African countries are investing in rail to meet
growing global demand for coal, led by  China . Botswana, with
about 200 billion metric tons of the resource in its central
region, is in talks with South Africa,  Namibia  and  Mozambique  to
build about 3,700 kilometers (2,300 miles) of rail lines to
ports at Richards Bay, Walvis Bay and Maputo.  Namibia is leading the talks, Siwawa said. Botswana’s mines
are large enough to require all three planned lines, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
