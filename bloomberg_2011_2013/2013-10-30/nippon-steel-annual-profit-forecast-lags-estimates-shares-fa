Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp. (5401) ,
the world’s larger steelmaker by market value, forecast full-year profit that lagged analyst estimates. Its shares fell.  Net income  may be 200 billion yen ($2.04 billion) in the 12
months ending March 31, the Tokyo-based company said today in a
statement. That compares with the  average  estimate of 232
billion yen from 18 analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  Shares of Nippon Steel, formed by the merger of Nippon
Steel Corp. and Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd. on Oct. 1, 2012,
pared earlier gains, dropping as much as 11 yen, or 3.2 percent,
to 329 yen in Tokyo trading after the release.  “Our second-half results will be affected by plans to
reline the No. 4 blast furnace at the Yawata Works and the non-recurrence of valuation gains booked on foreign currency-denominated assets due to currency fluctuation,” according to a
statement released by the company.  Chairman Shoji Muneoka has vowed to accelerate cost cutting
targets by reorganizing its inherited steelworks in  Japan  as it
seeks to fend off competition from Asian rivals. That push will
continue, according to today’s statement.  On a current profit basis, the company raised its forecast,
saying it now expects full-year current profit of 340 billion
yen, up from an earlier 300 billion yen outlook. Annual sales
are forecast at 5.45 trillion yen.  Posco (005490) , South Korea’s biggest steelmaker, last week cut its
2013 sales forecast for a second time after reporting a 22
percent decline in third-quarter profit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
