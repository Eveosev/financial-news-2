The dollar rose to the strongest
level in almost two weeks against the yen after the  Federal
Reserve  said it sees economic improvement even as it plans to
maintain stimulus while it awaits evidence of further gains.  The Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Index touched the highest since
Oct. 17, erasing an earlier loss, after policy makers issued a
statement following a two-day meeting. The greenback fell
earlier amid bets the central bank would keep buying $85 billion
of bonds a month under quantitative easing.  New Zealand ’s dollar
rose as the central bank said interest-rate increases are likely
next year.  Fed officials “said they’re still seeing improvement in
economic activity and labor-market conditions, which is why we
saw the dollar rebound,” Eric Viloria, a senior currency
strategist at Gain Capital Group LLC in  New York , said in a
phone interview. “But the trend is still for dollar weakness as
they maintain the pace of QE.”  The dollar strengthened 0.3 percent to 98.51 yen at 5 p.m.
New York time after touching 98.68, the highest since Oct. 17.
It rose 0.1 percent to $1.3736 per euro after gaining as much as
0.4 percent and weakening 0.3 percent.  Japan ’s currency declined
0.3 percent to 135.32 per euro after reaching 135.51 on Oct. 22,
the weakest level since November 2009.  The Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Index, which monitors the
greenback against 10 major counterparts, rose 0.1 percent to
1,007.37 and reached 1,009.13, the highest in almost two weeks.
The gauge fell 0.3 percent earlier.  Higher Volatility  A measure of price swings among the currencies of Group of
Seven nations has gained this week. The JPMorgan G7  Volatility
Index  increased to as high as 7.84 percent today after sliding
on Oct. 28 to 7.48 percent, the lowest since Dec. 21. The 2013
average is 9.38 percent.  New Zealand’s dollar rose from a six-week low against its
U.S. counterpart, erasing earlier losses, after the nation’s
central bank kept its benchmark rate at 2.5 percent while saying
“increases will likely be required next year.” The currency,
nicknamed the kiwi, gained 0.1 percent to 82.66 U.S. cents after
sliding 0.8 percent earlier to 81.93, the weakest level since
Sept. 17.  Brazil ’s real declined versus most major peers as slower-than-forecast  inflation  damped speculation the country’s central
bank will raise borrowing costs next month. The currency lost
0.2 percent to 2.1904 to the greenback.  Rupiah Drops  The Indonesian rupiah sank versus all of its 31 most-traded
counterparts on speculation companies stepped up dollar
purchases to meet month-end payments. It decreased 0.7 percent
to 11,175 per dollar after earlier sliding 1 percent, the most
since Sept. 30.  Economists forecast no change to the Fed’s bond buying
today. The policy-setting  Federal Open Market Committee  won’t
reduce the pace of purchases until its March 18-19 meeting,
according to an Oct. 17-18 Bloomberg News survey.  The Fed buys $45 billion of Treasuries and $40 billion of
mortgage-backed securities each month to push down borrowing
costs and spur growth, a move that tends to debase the dollar.  “Taking into account the extent of federal fiscal
retrenchment over the past year, the committee sees the
improvement in economic activity and labor market conditions
since it began its asset purchase program as consistent with
growing underlying strength in the broader economy,” the FOMC
said in a statement.  It repeated it will “await more evidence that progress
will be sustained before adjusting the pace of its purchases.”  ‘Slightly Hawkish’  The market “sees this in a slightly hawkish light and the
 Dollar Index  rebound continues,” Kit Juckes, global strategist
at Societe Generale SA in  London , wrote in an e-mail. “This is
the most dovish central bank out there simply failing to surpass
expectations.”  The cost of living rose 1.2 percent in the 12 months
through September, the least since April, the Labor Department
reported. The Fed’s inflation target is 2 percent.  American companies hired fewer workers than projected this
month, another report showed. Businesses added 130,000 jobs, the
Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP Research Institute said, versus a
Bloomberg forecast of 150,000.  The euro strengthened versus the yen after  Spain ’s National
Statistics Institute said  gross domestic product  grew 0.1
percent in the third quarter compared with the previous three
months, when it declined 0.1 percent.  Options Trading  Trading in over-the-counter foreign-exchange options
totaled $32 billion, from $48 billion yesterday, according to
data reported by U.S. banks to the Depository Trust Clearing
Corp. and tracked by Bloomberg. Volume in options on the euro-dollar  exchange rate  amounted to $6.6 billion, the largest share
of trades at 21 percent. Options on the dollar-yen rate totaled
$6.3 billion, or 20 percent.  Euro-dollar options trading was 12 percent more than the
average for the past five Wednesdays at a similar time in the
day, according to Bloomberg analysis. Dollar-yen options trading
was 11 percent below average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
