Weir Group Plc (WEIR) , the U.K.’s biggest
supplier of pressure pumps, will invest 70 million pounds ($112
million) on new plants in Malaysia as part of its strategy to
expand into  emerging markets .  The three-year project to build a campus to the south east
of  Kuala Lumpur  will expand Weir’s production of high quality
castings and Linatex, a resilient natural rubber product used in
the  mining industry , the company said in a statement after the
London market closed yesterday.  “This represents an important step in the development of
our global supply chain capability and builds on the success of
our 2010 acquisition of Malaysia-based Linatex,” Weir Chief
Executive Officer Keith Cochrane said. “Since then, production
has more than doubled.”  Weir is seeking to increase capacity in the Asia-Pacific
region to widen its supply chain and offset slow economic growth
at home. The region contributed about 20 percent of the Glasgow,
Scotland-based company’s revenue in 2012, compared with about 12
percent from Europe.  The new campus, which will include a foundry, a machine
shop and a second Linatex continuous rubber processing plant,
will be built on a 55 acre site and have the capacity to produce
6,000 tons. The investment will support Weir’s valve
manufacturing facility in Elland, West Yorkshire, which is
expected to double production in 2013, the company said.  The project was announced during a meeting between
Cochrane, U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron  and Malaysian Prime
Minister Najib Razak.  To contact the reporter on this story:
