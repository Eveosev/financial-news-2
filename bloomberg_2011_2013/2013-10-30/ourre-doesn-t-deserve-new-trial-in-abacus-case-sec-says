Fabrice Tourre, the ex- Goldman Sachs (GS) 
Group Inc. vice president found liable for his part in a failed
$1 billion investment, should be denied a new trial, the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission said.  “A wealth of evidence supports the jury’s correct
conclusion that Tourre violated the securities laws,” the SEC
said today in a filing in  Manhattan  federal court. “Tourre has
identified no missing fact, legal flaw, or miscarriage of
justice that would warrant the extraordinary relief he seeks,
setting aside a jury’s verdict.”  Tourre, 34, on Sept. 30 asked for judgment in his favor or
a new trial, arguing that the jury’s verdict wasn’t supported by
the evidence.  The SEC accused New York-based Goldman Sachs and Tourre, a
native of  France , of intentionally misleading investors in a
subprime mortgage entity called Abacus about the role played by
Paulson & Co., the hedge fund of billionaire  John Paulson , which
helped choose the portfolio of securities, then made a billion-dollar bet it would fail.  Goldman Sachs settled with the SEC for $550 million in July
2010.  Jurors in the case determined on Aug. 1 that Tourre
couldn’t hide behind his age and relative lack of status within
Goldman Sachs to avoid responsibility. He faces unspecified
fines and potential exclusion from the securities industry.  The case is SEC v. Tourre, 10-cv-03229, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
