Next Plc (NXT) , the U.K.â€™s second-largest
clothing retailer, raised its full-year profit target as it
reported higher third-quarter sales growth than analysts had
anticipated.  Total sales under the Next brand, excluding value-added
taxes, rose 4.3 percent in the third quarter, the Leicester,
England-based company said in a statement today. The median of
16 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg was for a 2.9 percent
gain.  Next now forecasts full-year brand sales may increase by as
much as 3.75 percent, having previously anticipated an increase
of as much as 3.5 percent. The retailer expects full-year profit
before tax will be as much as 680 million pounds ($1.1 billion),
up from a previous forecast of as much as 675 million pounds.  The company last month said it planned to plough ahead with
store expansion despite a tough consumer climate and a booming
online market. Store expansion has helped the company with
online sales as well, as more than a third of orders are
collected there, the company said at the time.  The company, with more than 500 stores across the U.K. and
Ireland, has seen its shares gain 40 percent so far this year,
giving it a market capitalization of 8.1 billion pounds.  evious  To contact the reporter on this story:
