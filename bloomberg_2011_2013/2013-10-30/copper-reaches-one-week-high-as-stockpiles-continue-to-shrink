Copper futures rose the most in five
weeks as inventories capped the longest slump since 2009 and on
signs of increasing demand in  China , the world’s biggest user.  Stockpiles tracked by the London Metal Exchange dropped for
the 40th straight session to the lowest since March. China’s
refined copper consumption will probably rise 6.5 percent in
2014, and demand will exceed supply by 1.9 million metric tons,
Yang Changhua, an analyst at Beijing Antaike Information
Development Co., said yesterday.  Copper is “clearly finding support at present from robust
demand,” Commerzbank AG analysts including Frankfurt-based
Daniel Briesemann said in a report. “Stocks in the warehouses
of the LME are declining continuously.”  On the Comex in  New York , copper futures for December
delivery climbed 1.4 percent to settle at $3.3255 a pound at
1:19 p.m, the biggest gain for a most-active contract since
Sept. 19. Trading was 35 percent above the average in the past
100 days for this time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ,  Europe ’s largest carmaker, said vehicle
 deliveries  to customers are set to climb this year. The
International Copper Study Group says an average mid-size auto
contains about 50 pounds of the metal.  On the LME, copper for delivery in three months rose 1.3
percent to $7,290 a metric ton ($3.31 a pound). Aluminum, lead,
nickel and zinc also advanced. Tin declined.  To contact the reporter on this story:
