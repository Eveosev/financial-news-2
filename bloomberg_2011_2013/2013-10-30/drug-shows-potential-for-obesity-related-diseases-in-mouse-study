Obese, diabetic mice given an
experimental drug designed to mimic a hormone with antidiabetic
effects improved the health of the animals and extended their
lifespan, a study found.  The compound, called AdipoRon, improved sensitivity to
insulin and lowered blood sugar levels in mice fed a high-fat
diet and in genetically obese mice, according to the study by
scientists including Miki Okada-Iwabu, Toshimasa Yamauchi and
Masato Iwabu at  University of Tokyo . The research is published
today in the journal Nature.  AdipoRon, discovered at a University of Tokyo drug library,
acts on two receptors of a fat-derived  hormone  called
adiponectin that is decreased in obesity. The findings in mice
may point to a new approach for treating obesity-related
diseases, such as Type 2 diabetes, researchers said.  “AdipoRon shifts the physiology of mice fed excess calorie
towards that of mice fed a standard diet, modulates known
longevity pathways and improves health and prolongs lifespan,”
the authors wrote.  Overweight and obese people face  greater risk  of heart
attacks, strokes and diabetes than those with less body mass,
according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, based in Atlanta.  Obesity has nearly  doubled  since 1980 and 500 million
adults, or more than 10 percent of the world’s adult population,
were obese in 2008, according to the Geneva-based World Health
Organization. In the U.S. more than a third of adults, and  17
percent  of children and adolescents aged 2 to 19 years, are
obese, according to the CDC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
