Conergy AG (CGYK) , a German solar company,
won its first order to build a photovoltaic plant in the
Philippines.  Conergy will install 22 megawatts of solar panels for
investor San Carlos Solar Energy Inc. in San Carlos City, the
Hamburg-based developer said today in an e-mailed statement. The
project is scheduled to start operating in the first half and
will produce enough power for 13,000 homes, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
