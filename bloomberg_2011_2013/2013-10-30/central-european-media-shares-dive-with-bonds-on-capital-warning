Central European Media Enterprises
Ltd. (CETV)  shares had their biggest drop in almost 13 years and bond
yields surged to an 18-month high as the broadcaster said it may
fail to meet debt obligations without additional funding.  The stock plunged 55 percent to $2.76 by 12:40 p.m. in New
York, the worst intraday retreat since December 2000, with share
turnover at more than 20 times the three-month daily average.
Yields on the euro-denominated notes due September 2016 jumped
418 basis points, or 4.18 percentage points, to 13.84 percent.  The operator of TV channels partially owned by  Time Warner
Inc. (TWX)  is evaluating options including debt and equity financing
and asset sales to help service its liabilities and fund
operations, the Bermuda-registered company said in a statement
today. It cut its full-year forecasts after the third-quarter
operating earnings swung to a loss, according to the statement.  “We expect rating agencies to cut the debt rating and we
also expect a share issue with a dilution effect on existing
shareholders,” Pavel Ryska, an analyst at J&T Banka AS in
 Prague , wrote in report to clients today. “We consider the
results negative for shares and bonds.”  The company’s secondary listing in Prague fell 51 percent
to 56.75 koruna, with traded volume about 26-times average.  The operating loss before depreciation and amortization, or
Oibda, for the three months ended Sept. 30 was $32.4 million,
after income of $3.5 million a year earlier, the company said.
Net revenue fell 3 percent to $135.8 million in the period.  Oibda Loss  CME, as the company is known, now expects a full-year Oibda
loss of $40 million to $30 million and revenue between $640
million and $650 million. It also said it is in talks with Time
Warner on a possible capital transaction to boost its liquidity.  “If we are unable to secure additional financing, we will
be unable to meet our debt-service obligations and generally
fund our operations sometime within the next 12 months,” the
company said in the earnings statement.  Moody’s Investors Service downgraded CME’s bond rating
Caa1, seven notches below investment grade, from B3 on Sept. 10
after the company cut its 2013 Oibda target to between $50
million and $70 million from $100 million to $120 million.  CME will need a financial injection in the first quarter of
2014 at the latest, most likely through a rights issue to Time
Warner, according to J&T’s Ryska.  A share sale would probably be priced below the current
market level,  Josef Nemy , an analyst at Komercni Banka AS in
Prague, wrote in a report to clients today.  “We will have to significantly reduce our estimates” for
CME’s performance after “very weak earnings and a shocking
guidance revision,” Nemy said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
