Gold fell as the dollar rebounded
after the U.S. Federal Reserve cited “improvement in economic
activity and labor market conditions.”  The greenback gained as much as 0.3 percent against a
basket of 10 currencies, eroding gold’s appeal as an alternative
investment. Earlier, the metal rose as much as 1.1 percent,
while the dollar dropped 0.3 percent. Fed policy makers said
today they will press on with $85 billion in monthly bond
purchases to bolster the economy.  “The dollar strength is keeping gold under pressure,”
Michael Gayed, the chief investment strategist who helps oversee
$270 million at New York-based Pension Partners LLC, said in a
telephone interview. “The safe-haven premium is diminishing as
the Fed sees signs of economic improvement.”  Gold for immediate delivery fell 0.2 percent to $1,342.95
an ounce at 3:07 p.m.  New York  time. The metal traded around
$1,355 prior to the Fed statement at 2 p.m.  This year, gold has slumped 20 percent, heading for the
first annual drop since 2000. Some investors lost faith in the
metal as a store a value amid a U.S. equity rally to a record
and tame inflation.  Gold rose 70 percent from December 2008 to June 2011 as the
Fed pumped more than $2 trillion into the financial system.
Policy makers will delay scaling back the pace of debt purchases
until March, according to economists surveyed last week by
Bloomberg.  On the Comex in New York, gold futures for delivery in
December rose 0.3 percent to settle at $1,349.30 an ounce at
1:41 p.m. The price fell as low as $1,334.50 in electronic
trading after the Fed announcement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
