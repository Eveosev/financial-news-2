Gersson Rosas resigned as general
manager of the Dallas Mavericks three months after he was hired
by the National Basketball Association team.  Rosas, 35, ended his tenure yesterday on the eve of the
team’s season opener.  “I made the personal decision to resign as general manager
of the Dallas Mavericks after determining that the position was
not the best fit for me at this point in my career,” Rosas said
in a statement. “The decision was made solely by me, as I
firmly believe this change is in my best interest.”  Owner  Mark Cuban  said he was “disappointed” with Rosas’s
decision.  The Mavericks open their NBA season tonight hosting the
 Atlanta Hawks .  To contact the reporter on this story:
