Mexico’s peso-denominated bonds fell
after the  Federal Reserve  said it saw improvement in the  U.S.
economy , a sign the central bank may soon taper stimulus that
has pushed investors to higher-yielding  emerging markets .  Yields on peso bonds due in 2024 rose three basis points,
or 0.03 percentage point, to 5.94 percent today in Mexico City,
the third straight yield increase, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The price fell 0.33 centavo to 132.94 centavos per
peso. The currency fell 0.1 percent to 12.9349 per U.S. dollar
at 3 p.m. in Mexico City.  While the Fed said it would maintain $85 billion of monthly
bond purchases, the central bank saw signs of “underlying
strength” in economic activity. The Fed was expected to
maintain asset purchases until its March meeting, according to a
Bloomberg survey of analysts.  “People thought they would say something about how the
economy was weak, but they said the opposite, Roberto Ivan Garcia Castellanos, a bond trader at Casa de Bolsa Finamex SAB,
said in a telephone interview from Guadalajara.  To contact the reporters on this story:
