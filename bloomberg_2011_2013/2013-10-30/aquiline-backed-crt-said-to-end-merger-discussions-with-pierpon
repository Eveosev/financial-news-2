CRT Capital Group LLC and Pierpont
Securities LLC have ended talks to combine the brokerage firms
after failing to reach an agreement, according to two people
with knowledge of the matter.  Pierpont and CRT, backed by Aquiline Capital Partners LLC,
had been negotiating terms for a merger since August and called
off negotiations this week, said the people, who asked not to be
identified because the discussions are private.  Pierpont, which expanded its debt-trading unit with $200
million from Stone Point Capital LLC and General Atlantic LLC in
2010, exited its high-yield bond and loan business as 11 people
resigned, Karen Ogden, the firmâ€™s chief administrative officer,
said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
