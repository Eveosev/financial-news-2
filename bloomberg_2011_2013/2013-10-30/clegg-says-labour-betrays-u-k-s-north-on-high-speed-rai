U.K. Deputy Prime Minister  Nick Clegg  accused the opposition  Labour Party  of betraying the north
of  England  by equivocating about its support for a planned high-speed rail line from  London  to Manchester and Leeds.  “It just beggars belief that a party that constantly
parades itself as the authentic voice of the north of England is
now prepared to turn its back on the businesses, the
communities, the families which I think all the evidence shows
will benefit disproportionately” from the proposed link, Clegg,
who leads the Liberal Democrat party, told reporters at a news
conference in London today. “I just think it is miserable, it’s
pathetic.”  The deputy prime minister’s comments suggest he would
insist on continued government support for the line in any
coalition negotiations after the May 2015 general election,
should neither Labour nor the Conservatives be able to form a
single-party government. Clegg represents a district in
Sheffield, one of the northern cities on the planned route.  While Labour still officially supports the high-speed line
and will vote for it in Parliament tomorrow, its Treasury
spokesman  Ed Balls  has warned that this backing is conditional
on costs staying under control. At his party’s annual conference
last month, he publicly discussed alternative uses for the 50
billion pounds ($80 billion) set aside for the line and trains.  To contact the reporter on this story:
