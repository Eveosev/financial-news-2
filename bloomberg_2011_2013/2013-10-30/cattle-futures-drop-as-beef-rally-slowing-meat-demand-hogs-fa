Cattle futures fell for the first
time in a week on speculation that surging U.S. beef prices will
erode demand at grocery stores and restaurants. Hogs also
decreased.  Wholesale  beef  rose yesterday to the highest price since
early June and is up 5.7 percent in October, heading for the
biggest monthly rally in more than a year, U.S. Department of
Agriculture data show. In a sign of slowing demand, meat plants
slaughtered 245,000 cattle this week through yesterday, down 0.4
decline from a week earlier, according to the USDA.  “Meatpackers are slowing down because of high prices,”
Troy Vetterkind, the owner of Vetterkind Cattle Brokerage in
Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “Packers are going to
have an increasingly harder time selling beef at these high
prices around Thanksgiving.”  Cattle futures for December delivery fell 0.2 percent to
$1.33975 a pound at 11:10 a.m. on the  Chicago  Mercantile
Exchange, halting a four-session rally that sent prices to a
nine-month high on Oct. 25. Wholesale beef reached $2.0424 a
pound yesterday, the highest since June 5.  Feeder-cattle futures for January settlement dropped 0.2
percent to $1.666 a pound.  Hog futures for December settlement declined 0.8 percent to
90.575 cents a pound on the CME, after touching 92.3 cents, the
highest for the contract since it began trading in June 2012.
The price is up 4.6 percent this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
