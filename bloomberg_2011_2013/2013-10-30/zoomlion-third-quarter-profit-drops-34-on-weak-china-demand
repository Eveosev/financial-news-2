Zoomlion Heavy Industry Science &
Technology Co. (1157) , China’s biggest construction equipment maker,
posted a 34 percent drop in third-quarter profit amid weak
demand and excess market capacity.  Net income fell to 889 million  yuan  ($146 million) from
1.34 billion yuan a year earlier, Zoomlion said in a  filing  to
the Shenzhen stock exchange today. Daiwa Capital Markets HK Ltd.
 estimated  profit of 900 million yuan. Sales fell 13 percent to
8.73 billion yuan.  Zoomlion rose 2 percent to HK$7 at the close in Hong Kong
trading, boosting its gain to 4.5 percent since Xinkuaibao, a
Chinese daily, apologized on Oct. 27 for publishing unverified
stories questioning the company’s finances. The apology came
after the reporter who wrote the stories told police that he
fabricated the news, following his detention on Oct. 18.  “It will take time for investors to rebuild confidence in
the company and the industry,” Daiwa analysts led by Li Xiong
wrote in a note on Oct. 23. “We do not see any near-term upside
catalysts, but sentiment may start to bottom out after 3Q
results.”  Sany Heavy Industry Co. (600031) , China’s second-largest
construction equipment maker, reported third-quarter net income
slumped 54 percent to 326.4 million yuan, according to a
statement to the  Shanghai Stock Exchange  today.  Zoomlion’s account receivables rose to 25.6 billion yuan at
the end of September, the statement showed.  Zoomlion, based in Changsha city in  Hunan province , central
China, rose 2.1 percent to 5.72 yuan in Shenzhen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
