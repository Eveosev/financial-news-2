Japanese  shares  rose, with the  Topix (TPX) 
index reversing this month’s loss, as a weaker yen boosted
exporters and corporate earnings cheered investors.  Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s largest carmaker, jumped
1.1 percent. SoftBank Corp. added 2.7 percent after a report the
mobile carrier may post a record operating profit. Japan Tobacco
Inc., Asia’s biggest listed cigarette maker, climbed 3.9 percent
after NHK, Japan’s public broadcaster, said it may cut workers
and close plants. Advantest Corp. fell the most on the  Nikkei
225  Stock Average as its net loss was wider than estimated.  The Topix climbed 0.8 percent to 1,202.87 as of 9:20 a.m.
in  Tokyo , with all but one of the 33 industry groups rising. The
measure is headed for a 0.8 percent gain this month. The Nikkei
225 increased 0.9 percent to 14,453.15. The  Federal Reserve 
concludes a policy meeting today. The yen slid 0.5 percent
against the dollar yesterday and traded at 98.25 today.  “So far, most earnings for Japanese companies have been
favorable and it’s starting to breed confidence,”said  Hiroichi Nishi , an equities manager in Tokyo at SMBC Nikko Securities
Inc., a unit of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc., Japan’s
second-biggest lender by market value. “As long as central
banks in the world’s major countries maintain their strong
stance to not let the economy slip, the market won’t break down
and that’s reassuring investors.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
