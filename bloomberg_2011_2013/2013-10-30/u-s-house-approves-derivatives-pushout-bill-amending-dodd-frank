Legislation to undo a Dodd-Frank Act
measure requiring banks such as  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and
Citigroup Inc. to separate swaps trading from deposit-taking
units was advanced by the U.S. House with bipartisan support.  The revision approved today in a 292-122 vote would upend
the 2010 law’s pushout provision by allowing trades of almost
all types of derivatives by lenders with access to deposit
insurance and discount borrowing. A companion bill has failed to
gain traction in the Democrat-controlled Senate, which would
have to agree with the change for it to become law. The House
bill received 70 votes from Democrats.  The White House issued a statement on Oct. 28 opposing the
bill, saying legislation to amend the derivatives provisions of
Dodd-Frank are “premature and could be disruptive and harmful
to the implementation of these critical reforms.”  Lawmakers included the original measure as a way to limit
risk-taking by banks that got federal bailouts during the 2008
credit crisis. The pushout provision was faulted by banks and
also by regulators including Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke , who expressed concern that it could drive swaps
trading to less-regulated entities.  The Fed earlier this year granted certain banks two-year
extensions to comply with the requirement to move derivative
trading from deposit-taking units. The central bank has said in
letters to banks that they must determine whether to halt the
swaps activity or move it to properly capitalized affiliates.  The House bill is H.R. 992.  To contact the reporter on this story:
