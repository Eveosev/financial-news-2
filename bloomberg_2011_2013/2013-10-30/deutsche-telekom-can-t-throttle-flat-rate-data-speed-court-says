Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) ’s plan to
throttle the speed of fixed-line  Internet access  when customers
on flat-rate plans surpass a certain data volume was struck down
by a German court.  The standard terms are unfair on customers, the Cologne
Regional Court said in an e-mailed statement today. The case was
brought by a consumer protection association. Deutsche Telekom
shares fell 1.7 percent to 11.585 euros at 15:59 in  Frankfurt .  “The average customer understands ’flat-rate’ to mean a
fixed price for a certain access speed and doesn’t expect any
limitations,” the court said. “The relationship between
service and payment would be palpably disturbed.”  Deutsche Telekom said in April it would limit access speed
to 384 kilobits per second after users reached a maximum data
volume, citing increasing traffic and network-rollout costs as
the reason. The move caused a public outcry and the company
later raised the limit to 2 megabits per second. The policy was
planned to be implemented in 2016.  The ruling is “incomprehensible” and Deutsche Telekom is
likely to appeal, company spokesman Philipp Blank said in an e-mailed statement.  The case is LG Koeln, 26 O 211/13.  To contact the reporters on this story:
