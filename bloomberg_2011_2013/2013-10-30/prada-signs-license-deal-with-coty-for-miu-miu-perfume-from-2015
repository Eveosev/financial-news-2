Prada SpA (1913) , the Italian seller of the
namesake luxury bags, rose the most in more than a month in Hong
Kong trading after signing a licensing deal for  Coty Inc. (COTY)  to
create and distribute perfumes under the Miu Miu brand.  Prada rose as much as 3.2 percent to HK$76 in Hong Kong
before trading at HK$75.90 as of 11:22 a.m. local time, headed
for the biggest gain since Sept. 16. The  Hang Seng Index  fell
0.3 percent.  Prada is seeking to develop Miu Miu as global demand for
luxury goods cools. The 20-year-old fashion and accessories
label, named after Prada Chairman  Miuccia Prada , had sales of
512.8 million euros ($706 million) in the year ended Jan. 31, or
16 percent of total company revenue. The deal with Coty would
allow Prada to expand its second-largest unit in the $60 billion
luxury beauty industry.  The agreement with Coty “marks a major step forward in Miu
Miu’s development plan,” Prada Chief Executive Officer Patrizio Bertelli said in the statement.  The Miu Miu fragrance line is expected to be introduced in
2015, the Milan-based company said yesterday in a statement.  Sales of luxury goods are set to expand 2 percent this year
to 217 billion euros, according to Bain & Co. Spending on beauty
products, which accounts for about a fifth of the total, will
grow in line with the market, Bain estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
