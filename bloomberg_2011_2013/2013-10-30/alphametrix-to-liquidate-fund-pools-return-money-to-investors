AlphaMetrix Group LLC, which directs
investor money to accounts run by money managers, will begin an
“orderly liquidation” of its sponsored funds tomorrow, the
firm said in an e-mailed statement.  “In light of recent redemption requests, AlphaMetrix has
determined that its sponsored funds will no longer be able to
effectively trade the investment strategy employed by each
trading adviser,” the company said in the statement. About 90
percent of proceeds will be distributed to investors around Nov.
21, with the balance coming following a final audit, it said.  AlphaMetrix, based in  Chicago , said in an Oct. 10 letter to
clients that it had discovered “significant cash-flow issues.”
The firm, which had marketed itself as a haven for investors
from fraudsters such as  Bernard Madoff , fired its chief
financial officer and hired accounting firm Arthur F. Bell Jr. &
Associates LLC to review internal controls and recordkeeping.  To contact the reporter on this story:
