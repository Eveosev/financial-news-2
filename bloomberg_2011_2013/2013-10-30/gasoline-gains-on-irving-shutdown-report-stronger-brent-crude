     Oct. 30 (Bloomberg) --Gasoline rose on concern a unit
shutdown at Irving Oil Corp.’s refinery in  New Brunswick  may
further reduce U.S. East Coast supplies that fell last week.  Futures climbed as Irving’s Saint John plant shut the
larger of its fluid catalytic crackers yesterday, Genscape Inc.
reported. Stockpiles in PADD 1 sank 1.11 million barrels to 56.1
million last week, the Energy Information Administration said.
Gasoline’s premium to West Texas Intermediate jumped 18 percent
as the WTI-Brent spread neared the widest level since April.  The EIA report “set a positive tone and we’ve got reasons
for gasoline to be up,” said  Tim Evans , an energy analyst at
Citi Futures Perspective in  New York . “Some of the gain in the
crack spread is gasoline’s strength but the majority is due to
WTI’s weakness.”  Gasoline for November delivery rose 1.92 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $2.629 a gallon at 2:01 p.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Trading volume was 10 percent below the

cent to 2.46 cents a gallon. November gasoline and diesel
contracts will expire at the end of floor trading tomorrow.  The WTI-Brent spread widened $1.80 to $12.61 a barrel  The Irving Saint John refinery is “a major supplier into
the New England market,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow
Oil Associates LLC in Houston. “This is the cat cracker they’ve
had trouble with all year long.”  Gasoline Supplies  Total  gasoline inventories  fell 1.71 million barrels to
213.8 million in the week ended Oct. 25. Analysts in a survey by
Bloomberg estimated a decline of 200,000 barrels.  The motor fuel’s  crack spread  versus WTI widened $1.92 to
$12.57 a barrel. The fuel’s  discount  to Brent narrowed 12 cents
to a 4 cents.  U.S. retail  pump prices , averaged nationwide, rose 0.1 cent
to $3.279 a gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said today on
its website. Prices are 25.5 cents below a year ago.  Distillate inventories  fell 3.06 million barrels to 122.7
