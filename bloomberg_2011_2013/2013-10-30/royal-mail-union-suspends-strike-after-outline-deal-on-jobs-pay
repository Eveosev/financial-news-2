Royal Mail Group Plc said the
 Communication Workers Union  agreed to suspend strike plans
following an outline agreement on pay and  job security  beyond
the three years previously offered.  The CWU has agreed to “stand down” a 24-hour walkout
planned for Nov. 4, London-based Royal Mail said in an e-mailed
statement today. The company agreed to extend the validity of a
ballot in favor of industrial action while talks continue.  A final deal should be reached by Nov. 13, offering
lengthier legal protections for staff, improved pay and a new
pensions agreement, Royal Mail said in the joint statement with
the union. Other terms will include clarifying the company’s
parcels and letters strategy, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
