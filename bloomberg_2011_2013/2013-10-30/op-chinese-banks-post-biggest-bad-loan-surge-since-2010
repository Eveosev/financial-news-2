China’s top four  banks  posted their
biggest increase in soured loans since at least 2010 as a five-year credit spree left companies with excess manufacturing
capacity and slower profit growth amid a cooling economy.  Bad debts at  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. (1398) ,
 China Construction Bank Corp. (939) ,  Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. (601288) 
and  Bank of China Ltd. (3988)  rose 3.5 percent in the third quarter to
a combined 329.4 billion  yuan  ($54 billion), data compiled from
earnings reports shows. Profit rose to 209 billion yuan while
their average bad-loan ratio widened to 1.02 percent.  The rise in defaults adds to concern bank profitability may
slip as policy makers trim output at cement plants to paper
makers that have gorged on credit since 2008, while urging
lenders to build buffers to cover loan losses. China’s biggest
banks are trading near record-low valuations as investors brace
for a surge in defaults, and ICBC fell in Hong Kong today.  “Against the backdrop of a slowing economy and
overcapacity problems in some industries, some loans are
gradually going bad,” said May Yan, a Hong Kong-based analyst
at Barclays Plc. “We will see more bad loans forming because of
the legacy of over expansion.”  The top four banks have set aside an average 279 percent of
the value of their soured debt as provisions, up from 272
percent at the end of June and ahead of a regulatory requirement
of 150 percent. China also requires banks to set aside 2.5
percent of total credit as reserves.  Record Profit  While the lenders’ 10.8 percent profit growth in the three
months ended in September was the slowest pace in seven
quarters, the state-run banks are headed for at least their
eighth straight year of record earnings, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  ICBC fell 0.7 percent to close at HK$5.43, after dropping
as much as 1.8 percent, while Bank of China gained 0.3 percent
and  Agricultural Bank (1288)  added 1.1 percent, the day after the three
reported earnings. The benchmark Hang Seng Index fell 0.4
percent.  China in July ordered more than 1,400 companies in 19
industries to cut excess capacity after Premier Li Keqiang
pledged to boost efficiency. Rising interest payments are
driving some debtors to default on loans taken out during an
unprecedented $6.6 trillion credit increase from late 2008
through September.  Slower Growth  ICBC, the world’s most profitable lender, reported
yesterday its weakest profit gain in more than four years as
lending and fee income growth moderated. Net income rose 7.7
percent to 67.2 billion yuan in the third quarter, missing the
69.4 billion-yuan average  estimate  of 10 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  Agricultural Bank, the third-largest lender, posted a 15
percent increase in profit for the period to 45.6 billion yuan,
in line with the 44.1 billion-yuan average  estimate .  Bank of
China , the fourth-biggest, reported quarterly net income of 39.5
billion yuan, while Construction Bank said Oct. 28 its profit
rose 9.4 percent to 56.8 billion yuan.  “There are intensifying profitability pressures for the
sector on a quarter-on-quarter basis” amid slower lending
growth, margin pressure and higher bad debt, said Ismael Pili,
head of Asia bank research at Macquarie Group Ltd. in Hong Kong.
“Bigger banks such as ICBC and CCB will fare better, with the
smaller banks potentially having a harder time.”  Bond Yields  Shares of the four banks are trading at an average 0.93
times their estimated book value for 2014, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  The  yield  on AAA-rated five-year commercial bank bonds has
climbed 86 basis points since the end of June to 5.61 percent,
according to an index from Chinabond, the government debt
clearinghouse, signaling growing concern that  defaults  may rise.  China ’s top leaders will meet next week to map out economic
policies. Gross domestic product growth may slow to 7.1 percent
in 2014 from 7.6 percent this year as the government focuses on
rebalancing the economy and implementing reforms, Barclays Plc
estimated on Oct. 18.  “There’s a lot of uncertainty on where policy will be
heading next year,” said Liu Jun, a Wuhan-based analyst at
Changjiang Securities who has a “hold” recommendation on the
industry. “That will reduce the appeal of banking shares even
though their earnings growth is quite stable and valuations are
low.”  Chinese banks advanced 2.2 trillion yuan of new loans in
the third quarter this year, 18 percent higher than a year
earlier, according to  data from the central bank . Nonperforming
loans rose for seven straight quarters through June, data from
the banking regulator showed.  ‘Overwhelm Borrowers’  Interest owed by borrowers has risen to 12.5 percent of
Chinese gross domestic product in 2013 from 7 percent in 2008,
Fitch Ratings estimated in a report last month. The figure may
rise to as high as 22 percent by the end of 2017, which could
“ultimately overwhelm borrowers,” the agency said.  The nation’s debt-to-GDP ratio, excluding central
government and financial debt, widened to 207 percent at the end
of the third quarter from 190 percent a year earlier as credit
growth continued to outpace productivity gains,  Mike Werner, a
Hong Kong-based analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said this
month.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
