Oil and natural gas wells in  Canada 
are expected to fall 1.5 percent in 2014 as increased use of
hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling reduces the number
of wells producers require.  Canadian drilling next year will total 10,800 wells versus
the 10,960 expected this year, the Petroleum Services
Association of Canada said in an e-mail today.  “Large-scale use of these kinds of technologies is
creating a trend to fewer wells overall,” Mark Salkeld, chief
executive officer of the Calgary-based industry group, said in
the statement.  The association, which represents about 260 oilfield-service companies, forecasts  gas prices  will average C$3.50 per
thousand cubic feet next year and oil will cost about $95 a
barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
