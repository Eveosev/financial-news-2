South African protesters demanding
faster delivery of public services looted shops in  Cape Town ’s
central business district, police said.  Police at the scene tried to evacuate people involved in
the march of about 3,500 that was organized by the Informal
Settlements Organization, Captain Frederick van Wyk said by
phone.  “As I am walking down the street I can see shops that have
damaged windows,” van Wyk said.  Discontent with the failure of the national and provincial
governments to provide services to the poor has sparked protests
across the country. The Democratic Alliance, which governs
Western Cape province and is South Africa’s main opposition
party, blamed the protests on leaders of the Youth League of the
ruling  African National Congress .  “What happened during the protest march, namely the
looting of shops and informal vendors in the City center, was
shocking,” the  Democratic Alliance  said in a statement. “It is
a clear proof that these thugs have no real service delivery
concerns and their actions are all part of the ANC’s ongoing
ungovernability campaign in the Western Cape.”  South Africa’s unemployment rate is 24.7 percent, the
highest of more than 40  emerging markets  tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
