Shares in  National Australia Bank
Ltd. (NAB)  are on course for the biggest fall in four months after the
lender’s expenses climbed even as it posted a record second-half
cash profit on higher mortgage lending.  NAB’s cost-to-income ratio climbed 130 basis points to 42.6
percent in the year reflecting compensation paid to U.K.
customers, a restructuring of its Australian businesses and
costs related to a reduction in U.K. and Australian employees,
the bank said.  Chief Executive Officer Cameron Clyne is paring the U.K.
unit where mounting bad debts last year triggered NAB’s first
profit drop since 2009.  Australia ’s largest lender by assets set
aside A$165 million ($156 million) after tax in the year to
Sept. 30 to meet possible compensation payouts to U.K. customers
who were wrongly sold payment-protection insurance.      “Costs
were complicated,” Michael Wiblin, Sydney-based analyst at
Macquarie Group Ltd. said in an e-mail. “Having said that, we
expect that much of these additional costs this year will not
reappear next year and in concert with lower impairment, NAB is
set for sector leading earnings growth.”  NAB  shares , which fell as much as 3.5 percent in early
trading in Sydney, were 2.3 percent lower at A$35.40 at 11:38
a.m., trimming gains for the year to 42 percent. The benchmark
S&P/ASX 200 index  was  little changed and has risen 17 percent
this year.  Higher Dividend  NAB’s  cash profit , which excludes one-time items, climbed
to A$3.02 billion in the six months ended Sept. 30 from A$2.61
billion a year earlier, on higher mortgage lending and lower bad
debt charges That met the A$3.01 billion median estimate of nine
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Net income rose to A$2.93
billion from A$2.03 billion.  The bank boosted its final  dividend  to 97 Australian cents
a share from 90 cents a share a year earlier. The median
estimate of nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for a
dividend of 96 cents.  The lender is seeking a bigger share of Australia’s
mortgage lending by offering a home-loan rate matched only by
 Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)   Mortgage Growth  NAB’s mortgage market share grew to 15.3 percent in August
from 15 percent in September 2012, making it the third-largest
home lender in Australia. Mortgage lending in the country
climbed 4.7 percent in August from a year earlier, up from a
record low of 4.4 percent in the 12 months to March, Reserve
Bank of Australia data show.  “The pleasing result of the personal bank is a reflection
of the consistent strategy for nearly five years now,” Clyne
told reporters. It isn’t just interest rates “but a whole
variety of things in terms of lower fees, rejuvenation in the
distribution network that is being reflected in continued
acquisition of customers.”  Demand for mortgages is increasing after the central bank
dropped its benchmark interest rate by 225 basis points since
late 2011 to a record 2.5 percent and banks cut mortgage rates
to a four-year low.  NAB’s 7.2 percent increase in mortgage volumes in the year
to Aug. 31 was the most among the big four Australian lenders,
according to Australian Prudential Regulation Authority data.  Retail Banking  The bank’s cash profit in the year ended Sept. 30 rose to a
record A$5.94 billion from A$5.43 billion a year earlier, NAB
said. That was in line with the A$5.9 billion median  estimate  of
analysts. Net income rose to A$5.45 billion in the year from
A$4.08 billion.  NAB’s retail banking unit posted a 17.5 percent increase in
cash profit in the year to A$1.23 billion while business banking
cash profit expanded 3.3 percent to A$2.49 billion. NAB is the
country’s largest business lender. It’s U.K. unit recorded cash
profit of A$150 million, a turnaround from a A$213 million loss
for the previous year. U.K. lenders have set aside 11 billion
pounds ($17.6 billion) to cover the compensation payouts.  The bank moved 5.6 billion pounds of U.K. commercial real
estate on to its own balance sheet a year ago and said in March
that the remaining U.K. operations had become profitable. The
value of the real-estate portfolio fell to 4 billion pounds at
Sept. 30 from 4.4 billion pounds as at June 30, it said.  Job Cuts  NAB’s employee count fell 2.7 percent to 42,164 in
September from a year earlier, the lender said. Australian banks
are focusing on cost cuts to maintain profits.  The bank’s net-interest margin, a measure of lending
profitability, dropped 9 basis points from a year earlier to
2.02 percent. Customer deposits climbed 8 percent, outpacing
lending growth of 4 percent.  Charges for bad debts in the year fell to A$1.93 billion
from A$2.62 billion, the bank said. Trading income increased 75
percent on year due to higher sales of risk management products
to customers, NAB said.  NAB’s Tier 1  capital , a measure of its ability to absorb
future losses under the local regulator’s Basel III guidelines,
was 8.43 percent compared with 7.97 percent as of June 30.  The lender is the second of the country’s so-called four
pillar banks, named after a law that prohibits merging with each
other, to announce earnings. ANZ posted a 13 percent gain in
second-half cash profit Oct. 29.  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  reports
Nov. 4.  Commonwealth Bank (CBA) , the nation’s largest lender by market
value, reports first-quarter earnings on Nov. 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
