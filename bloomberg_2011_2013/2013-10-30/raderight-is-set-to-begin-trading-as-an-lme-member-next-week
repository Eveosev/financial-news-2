Traderight Ltd., founded as a
commodity trading adviser in 1997 and now expanding into raw-materials brokerage services, is poised to start making trades
next week as a member of the London Metal Exchange.  Traderight will begin trading and clearing contracts as of
Nov. 6, the LME said today in a notice e-mailed to members. The
exchange, the world’s biggest marketplace for industrial metals,
approved Traderight in April as a so-called category 2 member.  “We hope to be an alternative to the big players in the
market in providing bespoke services to clients,” Steven Spencer, managing director at London-based Traderight, said by
telephone today. “New independent brokers are really needed on
the LME, and that’s been lacking.”  Category 2 membership, or associate broker clearing status,
authorizes companies to trade electronically and by phone on the
LME. They also belong to the exchange’s clearinghouse and can
issue contracts for clients. Excluding Traderight, the LME has
29 category 2 members from Deutsche Bank AG to Merrill Lynch
International, its  website  shows.  Traderight stopped acting as a CTA “about three years
ago,” Spencer said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
