Crude options volatility rose to a
four-day high as underlying futures tumbled 1.5 percent.  Implied volatility for at-the-money December options, a
measure of expected futures swings and a key gauge of value, was
19.68 percent at 3:30 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
up from 19.53 percent yesterday. Puts protecting against a 10
percent drop in prices climbed to 27.88 percent from 27.1
percent.  West Texas Intermediate crude for December delivery fell
$1.43 to settle at $96.77 a barrel on the Nymex, the lowest
level since June 28. Prices have dropped 5.4 percent this month.  Puts, or bets that prices would fall, accounted for four of
the five most-popular options and 53 percent of electronic
trading volume today.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
December $105 calls, which fell 5 cents to 5 cents a barrel with
3,414 lots trading as of 3:41 p.m. December $95 puts rose 34
cents to 96 cents with volume of 2,532 lots.  In the previous session, 10 of the 11 most active options
