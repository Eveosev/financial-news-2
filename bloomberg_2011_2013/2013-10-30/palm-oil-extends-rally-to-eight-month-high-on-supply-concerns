Palm rallied to the highest level in
eight months on speculation that output in  Malaysia , the world’s
second-largest producer, will drop starting next month because
of growing cycles and the onset of monsoon.  The contract for delivery in January advanced as much as
2.3 percent to 2,555 ringgit ($810) a metric ton on the Bursa
Malaysia Derivatives, matching the intraday high for futures on
Feb. 22, before trading at 2,551 ringgit by the midday break.
Palm for physical delivery in November was at 2,540 ringgit,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  While  palm oil  is produced year-round,  output  peaks from
July to October, before tapering off. Prices are heading for a
10 percent gain this month, the most since December 2010, on
expectation that the monsoon season that usually begins in
November would slow production. The 14-day relative strength
index for futures was at 73.5, the highest since Aug. 28. Some
traders see readings above 70 as a sign that a drop is imminent.  “The market does look a little bit overbought,” said
 Carey Wong , an analyst at OCBC Investment Research Pte in
Singapore. “It could stay overbought for a while, before we
have another spate of news which could justify taking profits.”  Isolated showers and thunderstorms are predicted over
Sabah, Sarawak and Johor, the biggest palm oil producing states,
according to a seven-day outlook on the Malaysian Meteorological
Department’s  website .  Refined palm oil for May delivery jumped 3.7 percent to
6,332  yuan  ($1,039) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange  and
soybean oil climbed 2.3 percent to 7,220 yuan.  Soybeans for delivery in January climbed 0.6 percent to
$12.78 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, while soybean oil
for December gained 1.5 percent to 41.59 cents a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
