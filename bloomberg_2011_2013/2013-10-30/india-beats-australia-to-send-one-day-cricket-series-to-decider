Centuries by Virat Kohli and Shikhar
Dhawan helped  India  beat Australia by six wickets in their sixth
one-day cricket match, sending the series to a deciding game.  India won the toss and put Australia into bat in the day-night match in Nagpur. Captain George Bailey scored 156 and
 Shane Watson  made 102 to give the visitors a total of 350-6 off
its allotted 50 overs. Bailey’s innings makes him the leading
scorer in one-day internationals this year with 1,094 runs, an
average of 68.  A score of exactly 100 by opener Shikhar Dhawan got the
home team off to a good start, before Kohli’s 115 from 66 balls,
his 17th century in ODIs, guided India to victory with three
balls to spare. India’s score was the third-highest successful
run chase in the history of international one-day cricket.  The series is tied 2-2, with two previous games abandoned
because of rain. The final match, on Nov. 2 in Bangalore, is
 Australia ’s last international game before taking on  England  in
the first of five Ashes tests in Brisbane on Nov. 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
