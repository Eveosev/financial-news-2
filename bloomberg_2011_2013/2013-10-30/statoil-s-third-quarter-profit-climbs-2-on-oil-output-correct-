Statoil ASA (STL)  isn’t wedded to a target
for production that it affirmed today as Norway’s biggest energy
company seeks to balance the need to replace dwindling North Sea
reserves with its obligation to create value for shareholders.  “Our investors make their living not from volumes but from
value,” Chief Executive Officer  Helge Lund  said in an interview
in Oslo after the company posted higher output in the third
quarter that topped analyst estimates. “We’re in a privileged
position where we can choose between good projects.”  Statoil,  67 percent-held  by the state, has been expanding
abroad to compensate for shrinking North Sea reserves. Today it
reiterated a goal of  increasing production  by a quarter to more
than 2.5 million barrels of oil equivalent a day by 2020, with
the U.S. expected to contribute more than half of that gain.  Third-quarter output rose to 1.852 million barrels a day
from 1.811 million a year earlier, beating the 1.844 million
average of 28 estimates compiled by Statoil. Production outside
 Norway  expanded by 13 percent to a record 728,000 barrels on
increased output from U.S. onshore assets, Angola and  Brazil .  At the same time, earnings were little changed.  Adjusted net income, which excludes financial items, rose
to 12.1 billion kroner ($2.1 billion) from 11.9 billion kroner a
year before, Stavanger-based Statoil said today in a statement.  The result compared with the  11.9 billion kroner  average of
20 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Net income slid to
14.3 billion kroner in the quarter from 14.4 billion kroner.  Terrorist Attack  “We will continuously consider what creates most value,”
Chief Financial Officer Torgrim Reitan said. “We’re not married
to” the current 2020 production forecast, Reitan said.  Statoil says output will fall in 2013 from an average 2.004
million barrels of oil equivalent a day last year because of the
sale of Norwegian offshore assets, lower than anticipated growth
in U.S. shale gas, reduced Norwegian gas sales within  Europe  and
maintenance. Capacity has also been reduced following a January
terrorist attack on the In Amenas facility in  Algeria .  Production in 2014 will be curbed by as much as 120,000
barrels a day because of asset sales to OMV AG and Wintershall
AG and a redistribution of ownership at the Ormen Lange field,
Lund said, declining to say whether total output would expand or
shrink. Growth from so-called unconventional U.S. assets will be
“relatively low” in 2014 compared with now, he said.  Maintenance will reduce output about 30,000 barrels a day
this quarter, Statoil said. For the full year, such work will
cut “equity production” about 45,000 barrels a day, it said.  Brent Crude  The company earned an average $102.9 a barrel for oil in
the quarter, up from $99.9 a year earlier, and 1.97 kroner a
cubic meter for natural gas, down from 2.16 kroner.  The price for Brent oil averaged $109.7 a barrel in the
third quarter, compared with $109.2 a year earlier.  Statoil booked a 4.2 billion-kroner impairment loss on its
Mongstad and Kalundborg refineries, with “lower margins and a
challenging outlook.” Total impairment losses of 6 billion
kroner were countered by a gain on sale of assets.  The company reiterated that it will keep spending at about
$19 billion in 2013, while raising exploration expenditure to
$3.75 billion from $3.5 billion. Statoil plans to complete 60
wells this year, up from an earlier forecast of 50.  To contact the reporter on this story:
