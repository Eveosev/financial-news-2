Mexico ’s central bank shouldn’t cut
the key  interest rate  any lower than the current 3.5 percent as
tax increases give a temporary boost to inflation, Governor
Agustin Carstens said.  “Taking into consideration the impact of the fiscal
reform, a rate below 3.5 percent at this time, is not necessary,
adequate for the convergence” of inflation to the central bank
target of 3 percent, Carstens said in an interview.  Carstens comments echo those by policy makers when they cut
the benchmark rate by a quarter point to a record low on Oct. 25
and said that reducing borrowing costs beyond this level
wouldn’t be advisable. Speaking during The Economist’s
Buttonwood Gathering in  New York , Carstens defended the decision
on the basis of a moderate inflation.  “We are going to have a transitory shock in part from the
fiscal measures” being discussed in congress, Carstens said.
“Therefore, in a scenario of 18 months, there shouldn’t be any
problem with the convergence” of inflation.  Mexico’s inflation rate fell to 3.27 percent in mid-October, the slowest pace since January and close to the central
bank target of 3 percent.  Mexico’s senate gave  preliminary approval  late yesterday to
the tax initiative submitted by President Enrique Pena Nieto
that would boost the income tax ceiling to 35 percent from 30
percent and impose a new 10 percent tax on  capital gains .  To contact the reporters on this story:
