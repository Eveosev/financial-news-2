Treasury seven-year notes remained
higher after the U.S. sale of $29 billion of the securities
before the Federal Reserve’s decision on monetary policy.  The notes drew a yield of 1.87 percent, the same as the
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of seven of the Fed’s
primary dealers and the lowest since May.  Direct bidders , non-primary dealer investors that place their bids directly with the
Treasury, purchased the highest percentage on record. Treasuries
rose earlier after U.S. companies added the fewest workers this
month since April and inflation in September rose the least in
five months.  “It was another strong auction -- it came right on the
screws,” Said Thomas di Galoma, head of U.S. rates sales at
ED&F Man Capital Markets in New York. “It looks like the Fed
will be leaning dovish today and that propels the market to
lower yields over the near term. I don’t think the Fed’s going
to disappoint with tapering or some kind of hawkish statement.”  The yield on the current  seven-year note  fell four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 1.84 percent at 1:25 p.m.
in New York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader Prices, the
lowest level since June 21.  The yield on the benchmark 10-year  note  fell three basis
points to 2.48 percent.  Fed policy makers end a two-day meeting today at which they
will maintain monthly asset purchases at $85 billion, according
to a Bloomberg News survey of economists.  Bidder Participation  Direct bidders purchased 23.9 percent of the notes,
compared with an average of 19.3 percent at the last 10
auctions. The previous high was Dec. 21, 2012.  Indirect bidders , an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 42.3 percent of the notes, compared
with an average of 40.5 percent for the past 10 sales.  The  bid-to-cover ratio , which gauges demand by comparing
total bids with the amount of securities offered, was 2.66, the
highest since May and compared with an average of 2.6 for the
previous 10 sales.  Primary dealers  bought 33.8 of the securities, the lowest
since December 2010  Seven-year notes have lost 2.2 percent this year, versus a
drop of 1.8 percent for Treasuries overall, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch indexes. The seven-year securities
returned 3.9 percent in 2012, while Treasuries overall gained
2.2 percent.  Strong Demand  Today’s offering was the last of three note auctions this
week totaling $96 billion. The government sold $32 billion in
two-year debt on Oct. 28 and $35 billion in five-year securities
yesterday at the lowest yields since May.  Investors bid $2.87 for each dollar of the $1.785 trillion
in U.S. government notes and bonds sold at auction this year,
according to Treasury data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s down
from the record $3.15 for the $2.153 trillion sold at last
year’s offerings.  The bid-to-cover ratio at the October auctions of 2.85
times was the highest since May, and has risen for two
consecutive months for the first time since the September-October period a year ago.  The $167 billion of notes and bonds was the fewest sold by
the Treasury at auction in a month since it sold $165 billion of
debt in December 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
