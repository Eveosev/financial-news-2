Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  won a London lawsuit
against Taiwanese phonemaker  HTC Corp. (2498)  over patent rights
concerning the transmission of data over mobile networks.  Judge Richard Arnold said that HTC products had infringed
Nokia’s patent EP 0 998 024. Nokia said in a statement it would
seek compensation and an injunction against the sale of HTC
products in the U.K.  Nokia, the Finnish company selling its handset business to
Microsoft Corp, has filed more than 50 lawsuits in Europe, Japan
and the U.S. in its patent fight with HTC.  “HTC is disappointed by the decision that the U.K. court
has reached in this case and we will be seeking to appeal the
finding immediately,” the company said in an e-mailed
statement.  The case is: Nokia Corporation v HTC Corporation,  High
Court  of Justice. Chancery Division, HC12C02909; and HTC
Corporation v Nokia Corporation, High Court of Justice, Chancery
Division, HC12A02048  To contact the reporter on this story:
