Italy  may propose the first cost
cuts in a 3.5 billion-euro ($4.8 billion) plan to reign in
public spending as early as March, a government official said.  The review of public spending will range from procurement
of goods and services to ministry budgets and will include an
examination of costs at some state-controlled companies such as
national television company RAI, according to a Treasury
official who spoke on condition of anonymity.  Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta is trying to balance a
commitment to keep Italy’s public finances in check with the
need to boost the country’s economy, which has been shrinking
for almost two years. Letta, who wants to reduce fiscal
pressure, is trying to shift the burden of austerity away from
taxpayers.  Italy passed budget measures worth 11.6 billion euros
earlier this month, including 3.7 billion euros in tax cuts
which will be partly financed by the cost reductions identified
by the spending review.  To contact the reporter on this story:
