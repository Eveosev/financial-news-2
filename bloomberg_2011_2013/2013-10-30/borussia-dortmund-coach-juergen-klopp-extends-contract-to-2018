Borussia Dortmund coach Juergen Klopp signed a two-year contract extension until 2018, the
German  soccer club  said on its website.  Klopp’s current deal was signed in January 2012. The
contracts of assistant coaches Zeljko Buvac and Peter Krawietz
also were extended to 2018,  Dortmund said . Financial terms
weren’t disclosed.  “As you shouldn’t separate things that belong together, we
have once again extended the contracts of our head coach and his
team,” Dortmund Chief Executive Hans-Joachim Watzke said.  Klopp, 46, is in his sixth season as Dortmund manager and
has won two Bundesliga titles, along with the 2012 German Cup.
Dortmund reached last season’s all-German  Champions League 
final, where it lost to  Bayern Munich .  The U.K.’s Daily Mail newspaper reported two days ago that
Klopp was the top choice to succeed Joachim Low as coach of the
German national team. Low reached agreement last week on a new
contract until 2016, the Mail said.  Dortmund is second in the Bundesliga this season, one point
behind Bayern Munich. The club is also tied for first place in
its Champions League group with Arsenal and Napoli.  To contact the reporter on this story:
