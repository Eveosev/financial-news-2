Rubber advanced for a third day as
Japan’s currency weakened against the dollar, raising the appeal
of yen-denominated futures, amid expectations the  Federal
Reserve  will maintain economic stimulus.  The contract for delivery in April, the most active by
volume on the  Tokyo  Commodity Exchange, advanced as much as 1.4
percent to 264.8 yen a kilogram ($2,697 a metric ton) and traded
at 263.8 yen at 10:20 a.m. The yen weakened to 98.27 per dollar
today before trading little changed. It dropped the previous
three sessions.  The Fed began its two-day meeting yesterday as data showed
 consumer confidence  in the U.S. fell and an Oct. 22 report
revealed growth in American jobs slowed in September. The
central bank’s purchases of mortgage-backed securities will be
held at $40 billion and Treasury buying maintained at $45
billion, according to Bloomberg surveys of economists.  “Investor appetite for riskier assets increased on
expectations that the Fed will maintain stimulus, leading to
purchases of the commodity,” said Hideshi Matsunaga, an analyst
at broker ACE Koeki Co. in Tokyo. “Futures in Tokyo also drew
support from the  currency market .”  Rubber for January delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell 0.1 percent to 19,445  yuan  ($3,193) a ton. Thai
rubber free-on-board was unchanged at 78.15 baht ($2.52) a
kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research Institute
of Thailand.  Low prices prompted farmers in Thailand’s southern
provinces, a key plantation area, to stage a new round of
protest. The government ruled out buying rubber from farmers as
it will distort the market, and it will maintain direct subsidy
payments to growers, agriculture minister Yukol Limlamthong said
