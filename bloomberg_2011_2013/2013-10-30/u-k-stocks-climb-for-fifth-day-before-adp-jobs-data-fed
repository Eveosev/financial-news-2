U.K. stocks  climbed for a fifth day
as  Barclays (BARC)  Plc posted quarterly profit that met estimates while
investors awaited a U.S. private-payrolls report and the outcome
of a two-day Federal Reserve policy meeting.  Barclays advanced 2.9 percent after posting third-quarter
pretax profit.  Next Plc (NXT)  rallied to its highest price in at least
25 years after third-quarter sales growth topped projections.
Petrofac Ltd. increased 3.8 percent after winning a $650-million
contract from Algeria’s state-run energy company Sonatrach.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  added 36.06 points, or 0.5 percent, to
6,810.79 at 8:47 a.m. in London, its highest level since May 23.
The equity benchmark has rallied 5.4 percent in October as U.S.
lawmakers reached a last-minute deal to increase their
government’s borrowing authority. The broader FTSE All-Share
Index advanced 0.5 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index
rose 0.4 percent.  A report from the ADP Research Institute at 8:15 a.m.  New
York  time will probably show that U.S. companies added 150,000
workers in October, economists predicted. That would be the
lowest reading since May. Businesses hired a net 166,000 people
in September.  The Federal Open Market Committee meets for a second day to
discuss monetary policy. The 16-day shutdown of the U.S.
government earlier this month reduced economic growth by 0.3
percentage points this quarter, according to a Bloomberg News
survey of economists. The central bank will probably delay
reducing its $85 billion in monthly bond purchases until March
2014, economists forecast in the survey. The Fed announces its
decision at 2 p.m. in Washington.  To contact the reporter on this story:
