Andre Meyer joined ACT Currency
Partner AG to run its foreign exchange structured products
operations as the Swiss currency and precious metals fund
manager expands its business for wealthy investors.  Meyer is responsible for originating and distributing
currency-linked derivatives and structured products, he wrote in
an e-mailed response to questions. He was hired from  UBS AG (UBSN) ,
where he was managing director of the foreign exchange and
precious metals structured products unit.  Meyer is the  seventh  person to be hired by the Zurich-based
company this year, joining former Citigroup Inc. bankers Thomas Walcher and Patrick Haberstock, who previously advised wealthy
investors at the  U.S. bank , according to ACT’s  website . ACT was
founded in 1992 by Felix Adam, a former foreign exchange banker
at JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup.  Structured notes package debt with derivatives to offer
customized bets to investors while earning fees and raising
money. Buyers of the securities, which include institutional
investors as well as individuals, bear the risk both of the bank
selling the securities and of the underlying assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
