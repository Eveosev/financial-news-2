CVC Capital Partners Ltd. is nearing
an agreement to buy a majority stake in Chinese restaurant chain
South Beauty Group for about $300 million, according to a person
familiar with the matter.  The private equity firm is raising $140 million in loan
financing for the deal, the person said, asking not to be
identified because the discussions are confidential. Beijing-based South Beauty, which operates a chain of restaurants
serving spicy Sichuan-style food, had previously sought an
initial public offering.  The  China  Securities Regulatory Commission rejected South
Beauty’s application for an IPO in February last year, according
to a statement on the regulator’s website. South Beauty had
almost 70 restaurants last year throughout China, its website
shows.  A spokeswoman for CVC didn’t immediately return a phone
call seeking comment. Ivy Zhao, a spokeswoman for South Beauty,
couldn’t immediately comment. Reuters, which reported the CVC
deal earlier today, said South Beauty founder Zhang Lan will
retain a 31 percent stake in the business, citing people it
didn’t identify.  To contact the reporter on this story:
