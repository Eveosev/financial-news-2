T-Hrvatski Telekom d.d. , the
Croatian unit of  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) , said net income for the
first nine months declined 30 percent to 964 million kuna ($174
million) as crisis continues in European Union’s newest member.  Revenue decreased 8 percent to 5.2 billion kuna, while
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization,
or Ebitda, declined 19.5 percent to 2.1 billion kuna, the
country’s biggest communications services provider said in a
statement on the Regulatory News Service today.  “During the third quarter of 2013 there was again no
improvement in  Croatia ’s national economy,” Chief Executive
Officer Ivica Mudrinic said in the statement. EU accession and
and the related adoption of the EU regulatory framework also
impacted the company’s performance, forcing it to amend its
full-year Ebitda, before exceptional items margin, to between 42
percent and 43 percent. The rest of the outlook is unchanged.  The phone company faces increased pressure on disposable
income by rising unemployment and faster inflation, as the
Adriatic nation struggles to revive foreign investment after
four years of contraction or stagnation.  HTRA CZ <Equity>
