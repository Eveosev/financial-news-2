German stocks  were little changed
from a record as investors awaited the outcome of a two-day
Federal Reserve policy meeting, and a report showed U.S.
companies added fewer workers in October than forecast.  Linde AG retreated 2.9 percent, for the biggest drop on the
benchmark index. Deutsche Telekom AG followed its European peers
lower. Volkswagen AG advanced 5 percent after  Europe ’s largest
automaker posted third-quarter operating profit that beat
estimates. Vossloh AG climbed 5.8 percent as  Germany ’s biggest
supplier of concrete railroad ties reported higher net sales.  The  DAX Index (DAX)  fell 0.1 percent to 9,010.27 at the close of
trading in  Frankfurt  after finishing at a record 9,022.04
yesterday. The gauge has rallied 4.8 percent in October as U.S.
lawmakers agreed to end a fiscal impasse and investors
speculated that a worse-than-forecast payrolls report would
delay a reduction in the Fed’s stimulus program. The broader
HDAX Index was little changed today.  “Traders are a bit nervous before the results of the FOMC
meeting,” Stephane Ekolo, chief European strategist at Market
Securities in  London , said by phone. “Tapering expectations
have been pushed to next year, but the Fed may surprise, even
though the ADP data suggest a status-quo in the Fed monetary
policy for the time being.”  Companies in the U.S. boosted payrolls by 130,000 in
October, figures from Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP Research
Institute showed today. The median forecast of 39 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg called for an advance of 150,000.  The volume of shares changing hands in DAX-listed companies
was 23 percent lower than the average of the past 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Fed Meeting  The  Federal Open Market Committee  concludes a two-day
meeting today. Policy makers will hold off paring the $85
billion of monthly bond purchases until their March 18-19
meeting, a Bloomberg survey showed. The central bank will
announce its decision at 2 p.m. in  Washington .  Linde declined 2.9 percent to 141.05 euros, bringing its
two-day drop to 3.3 percent, the most in a year. The industrial-gases company yesterday cut its full-year profit outlook as the
strengthening euro damped foreign earnings.  Deutsche Telekom, Europe’s second-biggest telephone
company, slipped 2.2 percent to 11.53 euros. A gauge of
telecommunications stocks posted the second-worst performance of
the 19 industry groups on the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Volkswagen Gains  Volkswagen advanced 5 percent to 183.50 euros, its biggest
gain since July 2012. Earnings before interest and taxes
increased 20 percent to 2.78 billion euros ($3.82 billion). That
beat the 2.72 billion-euro average estimate of 10 analysts.  A gauge of carmakers posted the  best performance  on the
Stoxx 600, rising 1.1 percent. Porsche AG climbed 5.9 percent to
67.86 euros and Continental AG gained 2.2 percent to 134.05
euros. Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, the largest manufacturer of
 luxury vehicles , added 0.6 percent to 82.69 euros.  Vossloh jumped 5.8 percent to 76.85 euros as third-quarter
net sales rose to 350 million euros from 320 million euros a
year earlier. The company also confirmed its forecast for an
earnings before interest and tax margin of 4 percent to 5
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
