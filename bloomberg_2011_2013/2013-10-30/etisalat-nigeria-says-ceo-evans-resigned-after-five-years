Emirates Telecommunications Corp. (ETISALAT) ’s
Nigerian unit said Chief Executive Officer Steven Evans resigned
last month and returned home to the U.K. after leading the
company for most of its five years in existence.  Chief Commercial Officer Matthew Willsher was appointed as
acting CEO in his place, Chineze Amanfo, a Lagos-based
spokeswoman for Etisalat Nigeria, as the company is known, said
by phone today. Willsher didn’t immediately respond to an e-mailed request for comment and Evans’ Etisalat e-mail bounced
back. Abu Dhabi-based parent Etisalat didn’t immediately respond
to calls and e-mails seeking comment.  Evans was appointed in December 2008, two months after
Etisalat began full commercial operations in Nigeria, according
to Etisalat Nigeria’s website. Prior to that he was chief
executive officer of London-based  BT Group Plc (BT/A) ’s mobile unit.  Etisalat is the fourth-largest mobile phone operator in
Nigeria,  Africa ’s biggest oil producer and most populous nation
with more than 160 million people. The company had 15.3 million
subscribers as of June 2013, according to the  Nigerian
Communications Commission . Johannesburg-based  MTN Group Ltd. (MTN)  is
the biggest mobile company in Nigeria.  To contact the reporters on this story:
