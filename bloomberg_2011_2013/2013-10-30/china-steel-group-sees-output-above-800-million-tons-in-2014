China ’s steel output will exceed 800
million metric tons next year as fixed-asset investment and
economic growth remains steady, according to Li Xinchuang, vice
secretary-general at the China Iron and Steel Association.  Crude steel production will rise from an estimated 780
million tons this year, Li, also head of the Metallurgical
Industry Planning & Research Institute, said in an interview
from Beijing today.  “Steel output is likely to rise as long as China’s fixed
asset investment can meet 17 percent growth and the gross
domestic product can expand 7.4 percent next year,” Li said.  The world’s second-largest economy will probably grow 7.6
percent this year and 7.4 next year as the nation tackles local-government debt and financial reforms, according to the median
of 52 economists’ forecasts survey by Bloomberg this month.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
