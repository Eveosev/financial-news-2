PKP Cargo SA, the European Union’s
second-largest rail freight company, jumped on its first day of
trading in Warsaw after demand in its $467 million share sale
this month was almost six times higher than offer.  The stock climbed 18 percent to 80.51 zloty at 9:02 a.m. in
Warsaw, valuing the company at 3.5 billion zloty ($1.15
billion). Warsaw-based Cargo, Deutsche Bahn AG’s largest
competitor, is the EU’s first listed rail-freight company.  Its 1.42 billion zloty ($467 million) initial public
offering was the biggest in  Poland  since Alior Bank SA’s 2.1
billion-zloty sale in December and among the largest in central
 Europe  this year. Polskie Koleje Panstwowe SA, the nation’s
state-owned railway known as PKP, sold 20.9 million shares in
Cargo at 68 zloty each to raise funds for cutting its own debt.
The price range was set at between 59 zloty to 74 zloty apiece.  Foreigners bought 20 percent of Cargo while demand at 68
zloty a share was almost six times higher than the number of
shares for sale, PKP Chief Executive Officer Jakub Karnowski
said on Oct. 25.  First-half net income at Cargo, which cut its workforce by
39 percent since 2008, slumped 44 percent to 76.8 million zloty
as revenue fell 9.2 percent to 2.29 billion zloty, it said in an
IPO prospectus. Its management will propose spending 35 percent
to 50 percent of consolidated profits on dividends.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley and PKO Bank
Polski SA were joint global coordinators and joint bookrunners
in the IPO. Ipopema Securities SA, Raiffeisen Centrobank AG and
UniCredit SpA were joint bookrunners while Dom Inwestycyjny
Investors SA and Mercurius Dom Maklerski SA acted as domestic
co-bookrunners.  To contact the reporter on this story:
