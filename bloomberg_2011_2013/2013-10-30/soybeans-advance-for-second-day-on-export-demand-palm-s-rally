Soybeans climbed for a second day as
demand for U.S. supplies increased and palm oil, crushed to make
an alternative used in foods and fuel, rallied to the highest
level in eight months. Corn rose.  The contract for January delivery gained as much as 0.5
percent at $12.765 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and
was at $12.755 at 10:59 a.m. in  Singapore . Prices are still
headed for a second monthly loss in October.  Soybeans fell 9.5 percent this year on expectations that
U.S. output will recover from last year’s drought-affected
harvest and  Brazil ’s crop will climb to a record, according to
U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates. U.S. exporters  shipped 
83.6 million bushels overseas in the week to Oct. 24, the
second-most ever, the USDA said Oct. 28. Palm rose to the
highest since February in  Malaysia  as rain may disrupt output.  “We’re continuing to see strong demand for U.S. soybeans,
and that factor remains supportive for prices,”  Luke Mathews , a
commodity strategist at Commonwealth Bank of  Australia , said by
phone from Sydney. “The strength that we’re seeing in Malaysian
palm oil” is also supporting prices, he said.  Palm oil for delivery in January advanced as much as 1.4
percent to 2,533 ringgit ($803) a metric ton on the Bursa
Malaysia Derivatives, the highest since Feb. 22. Prices are
heading for the biggest monthly increase since December 2010.  U.S. farmers may harvest 3.149 billion bushels of soybeans,
4.4 percent more than last year, the USDA said on Sept. 12.
Production in Brazil, last year’s biggest exporter, may total 88
million tons, it forecast.  Corn for delivery in December gained 0.2 percent to $4.33 a
bushel after touching $4.2825 yesterday, the lowest since August
2010. Wheat for December delivery advanced 0.3 percent to
$6.8325 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
