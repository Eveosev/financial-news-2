Student protests broke out across
 Egypt  today, hours after security forces arrested a Muslim
Brotherhood leader in an extension of the crackdown against the
group.  Police entered the campus of Al-Azhar in Cairo today at the
request of its administration after Islamist students attacked
university offices, the  Interior Ministry  said in an e-mailed
statement. At least 14 students were arrested, state-run Ahram
Gate reported. Footage on state TV showed windows of the
adminstration building smashed, and documents and equipment
looted.  At Alexandria University in Egypt’s second-largest city, 15
students were injured in clashes between supporters and
opponents of the Brotherhood, Mohamed Abo Seliman, the Health
Ministry’s under-secretary in the province, said by phone. Army
and police forces arrived outside the campus, Ahram Gate said.
There was also fighting at universities in Daqahliya and
Sharqiya provinces in the  Nile Delta .  The protests followed the overnight arrest of Essam el-Erian, the deputy leader of the Brotherhood’s political arm. He
was the latest senior Brotherhood figure to be detained since
the army toppled Islamist President Mohamed Mursi, the country’s
first freely elected civilian leader, in July. Security forces
have killed hundreds of Mursi supporters and jailed hundreds
more during the crackdown.  Mursi has been held at an undisclosed location and is due
to go on trial Nov. 4 on charges of inciting violence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
