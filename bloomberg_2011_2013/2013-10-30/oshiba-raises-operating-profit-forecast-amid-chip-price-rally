Toshiba Corp. (6502) , the Japanese maker of
products from televisions to nuclear reactors, raised its full-year operating income forecast by 12 percent amid a rally in
memory-chip prices.  Operating profit will be 290 billion yen ($2.9 billion) in
the 12 months ending March 31, compared with a previous
projection of 260 billion yen, the Tokyo-based company said in a
statement today. The company kept its net income forecast at 100
billion yen.  Toshiba is restructuring its TV business by outsourcing
production after the  division  lost about 100 billion yen in the
past two years, hurt by competition from other makers including
 Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  President Hisao Tanaka is seeking to
expand in health-care and power generation as he boosts the
semiconductor unit to tap higher prices.  The company also reported first-half earnings today, with
net income falling 14 percent to 21.5 billion yen in the six
months ended Sept. 30.  Toshiba said it found improper accounting at its medical
systems unit. A director of the business was fired and an
accounting manager is suspended from working as the company
improves internal controls, it said in a statement.  In August, Toshiba said operating earnings would rise to
400 billion yen for the year ending March 2016 from 193.4
billion yen last fiscal year. The company is targeting sales of
600 billion yen from health-related businesses in the year
ending March 2016. It plans to raise sales from the division to
1 trillion yen in the year ending March 2018.  Toshiba this month said it wants to buy a majority stake in
the British nuclear venture NuGeneration Ltd. and plans to make
a decision before the end of 2013. NuGen is owned by European
utilities  GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA and  Iberdrola SA (IBE)  and plans to develop a
nuclear plant at Moorside in northwest  England .Â   A Sept. 4 fire that cut production at an SK Hynix Inc. chip
factory in Wuxi,  China , may lead to higher earnings for other
producers, Nam Dae Jong, a Seoul-based analyst at Hana Daetoo
Securities Co., said Oct. 29.  To contact the reporters on this story:
