Canadian Oil Sands Ltd. (COS) , owner of
the largest stake in closely held Syncrude  Canada  Ltd., said
third-quarter profit fell on lower production as maintenance
work took longer than expected.  Net income declined to C$246 million ($235 million), or 51
cents a share, from C$336 million, or 69 cents, a year earlier,
the Calgary-based company said in a statement on Marketwired
today. Cash flow from operations declined to C$339 million from
C$470 million.  Canadian Oil Sands said June 10 that a Syncrude coker,
which heats bitumen so it can be refined for commercial use,
would be shut 50 days for maintenance work. Instead, the
shutdown lasted 78 days and affected September production, Chris Feltin, a Calgary-based analyst at Macquarie Capital Markets,
wrote in an Oct. 10 note to clients.  “We believe that Canadian Oil Sands will not be able to
achieve the low end of its full-year production guidance,” he
said in the note. The company already lowered its target twice
this year, he said.  The company today lowered its production target for
Syncrude for the year to between 97 million barrels and 100
million barrels. The company’s sales volume declined to 84,300
barrels per day in the quarter from 113,300 barrels a day in the
year-earlier period.  “Healthy crude oil prices have facilitated funding of
these major projects and our dividend while maintaining a very
strong balance sheet, despite lower than expected production at
Syncrude,” said Chief Executive Officer Marcel Coutu, in the
statement today.  Crude Rises  The price of Canadian heavy crude rose 8.3 percent to an
average of $83.10 a barrel in the third quarter from a year
earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Syncrude is one of the largest oil-sands projects in Canada
with a capacity of 350,000 barrels a day. Canadian Oil Sands
owns 36.74 percent of Syncrude, which held an estimated 4.6
billion barrels of proved and probable reserves at the end of
2012, according to its  website . The other venture partners
include  Imperial Oil Ltd. (IMO)  and  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (386)   Canadian Oil Sands fell 1.1 percent to C$20.56 at the close
in Toronto. The stock has two buy, 13 holds and three sell
 recommendations  from analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
