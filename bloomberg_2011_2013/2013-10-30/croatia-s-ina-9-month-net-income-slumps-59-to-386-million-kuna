INA Industrija Nafte d.d. , the
Croatian oil refiner controlled by Hungary’s Mol Nyrt., said
nine-month profit slumped 59 percent as the European Union’s
newest member state struggles to exit a recession.  Net income fell to 386 million kuna ($70 million) from 933
million kuna a year earlier, the Zagreb-based company said in a
regulatory statement today. Sales dropped 8 percent to 20.7
billion kuna, while earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization fell 24 percent to 2.8 billion
kuna.  INA’s profit last year slumped 62 percent after the company
halted its profit-driving gas and oil plant in  Syria  to comply
with European Union policy on the middle Eastern country,
wracked by a civil war.  “Despite the economic slump and mixed external
environment, INA continues to significantly contribute to the
domestic economy at the time of a crisis,” Zoltan Aldott, the
head of the management board, said in the statement.  Mol owns 49.1 percent of the Zagreb-based refiner, while
the government holds a 44.84 percent stake.  Croatia  in the last
two years has attempted to increase its influence in INA, after
Mol won controlling rights to Croatia’s largest refiner in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
