Saudi Telecom Co. (STC) , the kingdom’s
largest telecommunications provider, advanced the most in almost
five years on a 73 percent gain in quarterly profit after
cutting costs with the sale of an Indonesian unit.  The  stock advanced  8 percent to 48 riyals as of 1:30 p.m.
Riyadh time, the highest level since April 2010. The stock has
gained 11 percent this year. That compares with a 17 percent
increase at the Tadawul All Share Telecommunications Index.  Third-quarter net income rose to 3.39 billion riyals ($900
million) from 1.95 billion riyals in the year ago period as an
improvement in operation efficiencies lowered service costs and
operating expenses, the company  said yesterday . That beat the
mean estimate of nine analysts for profit of 1.97 billion
riyals.  Saudi Telecom, the  Persian Gulf ’s second-biggest phone
company, agreed last month to sell PT Axis Telekom  Indonesia  to
PT XL Axiata Tbk., a unit of  Malaysia ’s largest mobile-phone
operator. XL Axiata, a 66.5 percent-owned subsidiary of Axiata
Group, agreed to settle $865 million of Axis debt.  “There is bigger story here than their earnings,” Asim Bukhtiar, senior analyst at Riyad Capital, said by telephone
today. “They reached an agreement last quarter to sell Axis,
their Indonesian operations. Our calculations indicate that it
was a very costly venture for STC.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
