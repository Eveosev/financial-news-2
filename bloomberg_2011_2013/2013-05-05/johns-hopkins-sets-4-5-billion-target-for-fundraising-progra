Johns Hopkins University seeks to
raise $4.5 billion to endow professorships and generate funds
for undergraduate financial aid and graduate fellowships, the
biggest effort in the institution’s history, the school said.  The university has already raised $1.94 billion from more
than 150,000 donors since it began a “quiet phase” of the
fundraising in January 2010, Johns Hopkins said in an e-mailed
statement.  The Baltimore-based university plans as many as 300 endowed
professorships and about $700 million for undergraduate aid and
graduate fellowships, it said. The university’s health system is
slated to get $2.4 billion of the intended funds, with the rest
of the institution slated for $2.1 billion, it said.  Johns Hopkins, which opened in 1876, plans to create
institutes for the American City, a global health initiative, a
Science of Learning institute, an institute for water and an
individualized health initiative, the university said. Nine
percent of the campaign’s funds are intended for buildings and
other capital needs, compared with the 18 percent in a previous
fundraising effort in 2008, the school said.  Graduates include Woodrow Wilson, the 28th president of the
U.S., who received his Ph.D. from the university in 1886. John Malone, the billionaire chairman of  Liberty Media Corp. (LMCA) ,
received a master’s of science degree in industrial management
and a Ph. D. in operations research from Johns Hopkins.  New York  Mayor Michael Bloomberg, founder and majority
owner of Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, committed
$350 million in January, the university said. Bloomberg is a
1964 graduate of the school.  To contact the reporter on this story:
