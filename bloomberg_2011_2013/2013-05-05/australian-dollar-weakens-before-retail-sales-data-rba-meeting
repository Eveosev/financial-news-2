Australia ’s dollar fell after data
showed  retail sales  unexpectedly contracted in March, adding to
speculation a weakening economy will prompt the central bank to
cut  interest rates  to a record low.  The so-called Aussie dropped to its weakest since October
2009 versus  New Zealand ’s dollar amid prospects monetary policy
will  diverge  in the two nations over the coming year. There is a
53 percent chance that the  Reserve Bank  will lower its 3
benchmark rate tomorrow, according to Bloomberg calculations
based on overnight-index swap rates.  “The Aussie will remain heavy and probably gravitate
toward the downside following the retail sales number,” said
Jim Vrondas, the Sydney-based chief currency and payment
strategist at OzForex Ltd. “The RBA is unlikely to cut
tomorrow, though they’ll probably maintain an easing bias. That
should give the Aussie some support.”  The Australian dollar declined 0.5 percent to $1.0271 as of
5:4 p.m. in Sydney. It fell 0.1 percent to 102.03 yen. The
Aussie slid to as low as NZ$1.2016, the weakest since October
2009, before buying NZ$1.2034, 0.5 percent lower than the May 3
close. New Zealand’s dollar rose 0.1 percent to 85.41 U.S.
cents. The currency advanced 0.5 percent to 84.85 yen.  Policy Rates  Australia’s retail sales fell 0.4 percent in March,
compared with the median forecast of economists for a 0.1
percent gain, data from the statistics bureau showed today.  RBA Governor  Glenn Stevens  will keep rates unchanged
tomorrow, according to the median forecast of economists
surveyed by  Bloomberg News . Policy makers have left borrowing
costs at 3 percent since December, when they made the last cut.  “Most economists are predicting no change, but they agree
the odds have increased and many now say it’s another line ball
decision,” wrote Greg Gibbs, a Singapore-based senior currency
strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc. “An important
consideration in assessing the balance of risks is the
resilience of the Aussie notwithstanding the weaker commodity
prices and increased speculation about potential rate cuts.”  The currency will probably fall toward NZ$1.15 over the
next six months, he wrote.  Swaps traders are betting on 57 basis points of reductions
over 12 months, according to a Credit Suisse Group AG  index .  The nation’s three-year  bond yield  rose five basis points,
or 0.05 percentage point, to 2.58 percent. The 10-year  rate 
gained eight basis points to 3.12 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
