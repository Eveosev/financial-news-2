LeBron James of the Miami Heat became
the fifth four-time winner of the National Basketball
Association’s Most Valuable Player award and will receive the
trophy before tonight’s playoff game against the Chicago Bulls.  James received 120 of 121 first-place votes and missed
becoming the first unanimous winner as Carmelo Anthony of the
 New York  Knicks topped one ballot. Anthony was third in the
voting behind Kevin Durant of the Oklahoma City Thunder.  “I just try to be the best player on the court every
single night when I step on the floor,” James said yesterday at
a news conference.  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar won the NBA MVP a record six times.
Michael Jordan and Bill Russell claimed it five times and Wilt Chamberlain is the only other four-time recipient.  James was named MVP in 2009, 2010 and 2012, making him and
Russell the only players to earn the honor four times in a five-
season span. James and Abdul-Jabbar are the only players to
twice win the award in back-to-back seasons.  At 28, James is seven years younger than Jordan was when he
received his last MVP award in 1998. Abdul-Jabbar won for the
last time at 33, while Chamberlain and Russell were 31.  James averaged 26.8 points, 8.0 rebounds and 7.3 assists
this season while shooting a career-best 56 percent. He was the
only player in the league to lead his team in scoring, rebounds
and assists, as the Heat ended the regular season with a league-
best 66 wins and 16 losses.  During the first round of the playoffs, in which the Heat
swept the Milwaukee Bucks, James averaged 24.5 points and 7.8
rebounds per game. He’ll be presented with the MVP trophy
tonight before Miami hosts the Bulls in Game 1 of their Eastern
Conference semifinal series.  James joined the Heat in July 2010 when he was traded by
the Cleveland Cavaliers, who drafted him first overall in 2003,
and led Miami to an NBA title last season.  Voting for the MVP was conducted by a panel of 120
sportswriters and broadcasters through the U.S. and  Canada , with
one ballot representing a combined fan vote. James totaled 1,207
points and was followed by Durant with (765), Anthony (475),
Chris Paul of the Los Angeles Clippers (289 points) and Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers (184 points).  To contact the reporter on this story:
