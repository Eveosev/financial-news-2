Most U.S. stocks rose, led by
financial shares, as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index extended
its rally past 1,600. The euro fell as European Central Bank
President Mario Draghi said policy will remain accommodative and
the ECB will act again to boost growth if needed.  The S&P 500 climbed 0.2 percent to 1,617.50 at 4 p.m. in
New York. The 17-nation euro lost 0.3 percent to $1.3076 and
 Japan ’s currency fell 0.4 percent to 99.36 per dollar. Ten-year
Treasury yields rose two basis points to 1.76 percent. Oil
gained, while corn and wheat lost more than 2 percent.
Malaysia’s benchmark stock index jumped to a record and the
ringgit rallied as the ruling coalition won elections.  The euro extended losses as Draghi said the ECB is ready to
cut interest rates again if needed after reducing them to a
record last week. The yen’s decline came as last week’s drop in
the U.S. jobless rate to a four-year low reduced demand for
Japan’s currency as a haven. The S&P 500 topped 1,600 and the
Dow Jones Industrial Average traded above 15,000 for the first
time on May 3 following the employment report.  “Central banks are on the side of equity markets,” Paul Zemsky, the New York-based head of asset allocation for ING
Investment Management, which oversees $180 billion, said by
telephone. “There’s a lot of pessimism still. People don’t
think this rally’s for real and are fighting it. Overall, I
still think there’s room to go.”  The S&P 500 jumped 2 percent to a record  last week  after
U.S. payrolls expanded by 165,000 workers in April and revisions
to the prior two months added a total of 114,000 jobs to the
employment count. The median forecast of economists in a
Bloomberg survey called for an increase of 140,000 positions.
Global equities also rose last week as the ECB cut its main
refinancing rate.  U.S. Movers  About three stocks advanced for every two that fell in the
U.S. and trading of S&P shares stocks was about 10 percent below
the 30-day average.  Financial shares rallied the most out of 10 groups in the
S&P 500, gaining 1 percent. Bank of America Corp. climbed 5.2
percent. MBIA Inc. will get about $1.6 billion as part of a deal
to end five years of litigation against Bank of America and its
Countrywide unit over claims of defective securitized mortgage
loans, a person familiar with the matter said. MBIA jumped 45
percent, the most since 2008.  U.S. banks eased standards and terms on loans to businesses
as commercial lending led a credit thaw, according to a Federal
Reserve survey.  ‘Stronger Demand’  “Domestic banks, on balance, reported having eased their
lending standards and having experienced stronger demand in
several loan categories over the past three months,” the
central bank said in its quarterly survey of senior loan
officers released in  Washington  today. The fraction of banks
easing standards for business loans was described as
“relatively large.”  Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. (CLF)  added 5.5 percent after being
raised to outperform from market perform by FBR Capital Markets.
 Humana Inc. (HUM)  climbed 2.1 percent as its  rating  was boosted by
JPMorgan Chase & Co.  Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN)  slumped 3.3 percent after
posting second-quarter profit and sales that missed estimates.  Birinyi Associates Inc., whose prediction the S&P 500 would
reach 1,600 came true last week, purchased options betting on
more gains. Birinyi said the S&P 500 may climb 18 percent to
1,900 should it conform to bull markets that began in 1982 and
1990. The Westport, Connecticut-based firm run by Laszlo Birinyi
bought an unspecified amount of  $170 calls  on the  SPDR S&P 500
ETF Trust (SPY) , according to a report e-mailed to Bloomberg News
today. They will become profitable if the S&P 500 gains more
than 5 percent by December.  Currencies  The euro weakened against nine of 16 major peers, while the
dollar gained against 13 of 16. The Dollar Index, a gauge of the
currency against six major peers, added 0.2 percent to 82.31
after slumping for two straight weeks. The yen was lower against
12 of 16 major peers.  The world’s biggest currency dealers expect the dollar’s
weakness will prove temporary as U.S. growth accelerates in the
second half of the year. Deutsche Bank AG, Citigroup Inc., UBS
AG and Barclays Plc predict an advance of as much as 9 percent
versus the euro by Dec. 31, even as the potential for more
quantitative easing spurs concern that additional stimulus will
debase the world’s reserve currency.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index was little changed and the
number of shares changing hands was 67 percent less than the 30-
day average, data compiled by Bloomberg showed, as markets in
U.K., Ireland and  Greece  closed for holiday.  Linde AG (LIN)  rose 2.8
percent after the German maker of industrial gases reported
first-quarter profit that beat analyst estimates.  Spain, German Yields  Spain’s 10-year  bond yield  rose seven basis points to 4.11
percent after dropping to 3.94 percent on May 3, the lowest in
almost three years. German 10-year bonds were little changed,
with the yield at 1.24 percent.  Retail sales in the euro area fell 0.1 percent in March
from the previous month, in line with a Bloomberg survey of
analysts.  The MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index gained 0.4 percent to a
seven-week high as benchmark gauges in  China  and  Poland  rallied
more than 1 percent.  The FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index jumped 3.4 percent to a
record and the ringgit rose 1.9 percent versus the dollar after
the ruling coalition won elections. The jump in Malaysian stocks
was the most since November 2008, and the ringgit rallied to
2.9793 per dollar, its biggest advance since June 2010.
Malaysia’s Prime Minister Najib Razak won a majority in the
nation’s election, allowing him to continue his economic
reforms.  Syria, Israel  Oil pared gains following an earlier rally triggered when
 Syria ’s state news agency said Israeli aircraft attacked a
military research center yesterday, renewing concern that
supplies in the Middle East would be disrupted.  West Texas Intermediate crude for June delivery gained as
much as $1.56 to $97.17 a barrel in electronic trading on the
New York Mercantile Exchange before trimming the advance to
settle at $96.16 a barrel, up 55 cent on the day. Brent crude
for June settlement increased 1.3 percent to $105.46 a barrel on
the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  The air attack on Syria was a “declaration of war,”
Syria’s Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal al-Mekdad told  CNN .
 Israel  didn’t confirm involvement.  “If the geopolitical events between Israel and Syria start
to escalate, the market will automatically write in a premium
and you should see a spike in the price of oil,” said  Jonathan Barratt , the chief executive officer of Barratt’s Bulletin, a
commodity newsletter in Sydney.  Corn, Copper  Corn slumped 3.7 percent, the most in five weeks, on
forecasts parts of the U.S. will turn drier after excessive
rains, helping farmers in the world’s largest producer to
accelerate planting and rebuild global inventories. Copper for
July delivery fell 0.1 percent to $3.3105 a pound on the Comex
in New York after jumping 6.8 percent on May 3, the most since
October 2011.  Australia ’s dollar fell against 15 of 16 peers as an
unexpected contraction in retail sales in March added to
speculation a weakening economy will prompt the central bank to
cut interest rates to a record. The Australian dollar declined
0.6 percent to $1.0253 and slipped 0.3 percent to 101.86 yen.  The offshore  yuan  declined 0.4 percent to 6.1755 per dollar
in Hong Kong. China’s currency regulator said it will increase
scrutiny of cross-border capital flows by importers and
exporters to prevent speculative funds entering the country
disguised as trade bills.  To contact the reporters on this story:
