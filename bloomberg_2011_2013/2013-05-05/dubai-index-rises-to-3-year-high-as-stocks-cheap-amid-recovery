Dubai’s benchmark stock index rose to
the highest level in more than three years as investors sought
cheap valuations amid an economic recovery in the emirate.  Dubai Islamic Bank PJSC (DIB) , the United Arab Emirates’ biggest
Shariah-compliant lender, soared 3.1 percent while  Emaar
Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , developer of the world’s tallest skyscraper,
gained the most in a week. Dubai’s  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  climbed 1.9
percent to 2,168.80, the highest since November 2009, at the
close in the emirate. The measure has surged 34 percent this
year, making it the best-performing index in the Persian Gulf.  “Dubai’s valuations were and are still very undemanding
compared to regional markets, and this is particularly apparent
in the real estate and the banking sectors,” Amer Khan, a
Dubai-based fund manager at Shuaa Asset Management, said in an
e-mail today.  Dubai stocks trade at a  price-to-book ratio  of 0.9 times.
That compares with 1.9 times for Saudi Arabia’s  Tadawul All
Share Index (SASEIDX) , the  Persian Gulf ’s largest bourse. The second-
biggest sheikhdom in the U.A.E. is recovering from a property
crash and a debt crisis helped by a rebound in the tourism,
trade and retail industries. Investor confidence in the emirate
has also improved after three state-linked companies paid or
refinanced $3.75 billion of debt in 2012.  Rapid Growth  Dubai’s economy is set to expand 4.6 percent, on average,
between 2012 and 2015, more than twice the growth of the
previous four years, according to government forecasts. The
emirate’s government said today it’s committed to honoring all
financial obligations on time after it redeemed 3.3 billion
dirhams ($898 million) of bonds due in April.  Dubai Islamic Bank, whose  first-quarter profit  beat
estimates, jumped to 2.99 dirhams, the highest since October
2009. Emaar rose 1.3 percent, the most since April 28, to 5.54
dirhams.  Air Arabia PJSC (AIRARABI) , the region’s biggest budget airline,
surged 5.8 percent to 1.03 dirhams, a three-year high.  Dubai plans to double the number of visitors to 20 million
by 2020 and triple annual revenue from the industry to 300
billion dirhams, the government said in an e-mailed statement,
citing a tourism plan to build developments and infrastructure.  Elsewhere in the Middle East, Kuwait’s  SE Price Index (KWSEIDX) 
soared 1.6 percent as it gained an 11th day, bringing the rally
in 2013 to 30 percent.  Abu Dhabi ’s  gauge  increased 0.8 percent,
Qatar’s  QE Index (DSM)  advanced 0.4 percent, Oman’s  MSM30 Index (MSM30)  rose
0.5 percent and Bahrain’s  gauge  climbed 0.6 percent. Saudi
Arabia’s Tadawul All Share Index fell 0.1 percent. Egypt’s stock
market is closed for a holiday.  Israel’s  TA-25 Index (TA-25)  slipped 0.1 percent. The yield on the
government’s benchmark 4.25 percent bonds due 2023 rose 11 basis
points, or 0.11 percentage point, to 3.62 percent after Standard
& Poor’s lowered the country’s credit rating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
