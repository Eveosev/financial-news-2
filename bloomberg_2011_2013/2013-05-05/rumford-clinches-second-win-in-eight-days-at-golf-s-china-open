Australia’s Brett Rumford clinched a
second win in eight days with victory in golf’s China Open
today.  Rumford, 35, who won the Ballantine’s Championship in South
Korea last weekend, had a final-round 68, 4-under par, to finish
on 16-under at Binhai Lake Golf Club. He won by four strokes
from Mikko Ilonen of  Finland .  It was Rumford’s fifth win on the European Tour and the
winner’s check for 407,900 euros ($535,000) takes him to the top
of the Race to Dubai standings.  “As with last week, I am kind of speechless at the moment,
it’s quite surreal,” Rumford told  Sky Sports . “It’s really
hard to try and go back-to-back, it’s the first time I’ve
actually played the week after a win so I am more than pleased.
It’s quite a feat, it’s very special.”  Chinese 12-year-old Ye Wocheng, who became the youngest
golfer to play a European Tour event, missed the cut after two
rounds of 79.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
