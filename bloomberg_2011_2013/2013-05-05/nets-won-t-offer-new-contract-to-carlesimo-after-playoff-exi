The Brooklyn Nets said P.J. Carlesimo
won’t return as coach next season, a day after the team was
eliminated from the National Basketball Association playoffs.  Carlesimo was named interim coach on Dec. 28 after  Avery
Johnson  was fired following 10 defeats in 13 games.  “The Brooklyn Nets organization would like to thank P.J.
for his efforts with the team in his roles as both head coach
and assistant, and for his contributions to the team’s success
both on and off the court,” Nets General Manager Billy King
said in an e-mailed news release today.  Carlesimo had a 35-19 record as interim head coach. The
 Chicago Bulls  last night beat the Nets 99-93 in a decisive
seventh game to advance to the second round of the playoffs. It
was Brooklyn’s first trip to the postseason since 2007.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
