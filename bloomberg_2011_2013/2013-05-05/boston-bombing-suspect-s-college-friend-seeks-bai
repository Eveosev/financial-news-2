Robel Phillipos, a 19-year-old college
friend of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev
charged with lying to federal investigators, is seeking release
on bail, claiming undue government pressure on him and his
innocence in the bombing itself justify his release while
awaiting trial.  To contact the reporter on this story:
