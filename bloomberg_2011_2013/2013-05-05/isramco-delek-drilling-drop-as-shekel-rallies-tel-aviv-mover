Delek Drilling-LP (DEDRL) ,  Avner Oil
Exploration LLP (AVNRL)  and Isramco Negev 2 LP, partners in the Tamar
offshore natural gas field, declined on concerns the shekel’s
rally could hurt revenues.  Delek Drilling slid 1.4 percent, the most since April 29,
to 15.15 shekels at 2:29 p.m. in Tel Aviv, trimming the 12-month
gain to 12 percent. Avner  retreated  0.7 percent to 2.62 shekels,
and Isramco dropped 1.3 percent to 0.63 shekel. The  TA-25
benchmark (TA-25)  equities index was little changed.  “The declines may be linked to the strengthening of the
shekel against the dollar,” Noam Pincu, an analyst at Psagot
Investment House Ltd. in Tel Aviv, said by telephone. “All the
operations of these companies are in dollars and when revenues
are translated into shekels these are lower.” He has a hold
rating on Delek and Avner while he rates  Isramco (ISRAL)  a buy.  The shekel strengthened for a 12th day on May 3, adding 0.4
percent to 3.5549 per dollar and capping the longest stretch of
daily gains since at least April 1981, when Bloomberg started
compiling data.  The currency has rebounded 15 percent from a
three-year low reached on July 26, leading gains among 31 major
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  The partners in the Tamar gas field, which started
production on March 30, have signed 15-year dollar contracts
with Israeli customers, including an agreement for at least $14
billion with Israel Electric Co., and for $700 million with Paz
Oil Co. The country’s off-shore energy assets are also valued in
dollars. Pincu estimates Tamar’s value at $14 billion and
Leviathan at $6.7 billion.  “The shekel value of these projects and that of the
contracts drop as a result of the stronger shekel,” Pincu said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
