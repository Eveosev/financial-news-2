Jauan Salem Al Dhaheri, a board member
of the  Abu Dhabi  Investment Authority and secretary general of
the emirate’s Supreme Petroleum Council, has died, according to
a condolence message on the ruler of Dubai’s website.  Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum offered condolences
to the Al Dhaheri family on April 30, according to the
statement. Dubai and Abu Dhabi are two of the seven sheikhdoms
comprising the  United Arab Emirates .  Al Dhaheri served on Abu Dhabi’s main advisory body for oil
policy, the Supreme Petroleum Council. The council is
responsible for awarding the emirate’s largest onshore oil-
production concession, which expires in January. He was also
deputy chairman at  National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC , according to
the lender’s 2012 annual report.  ADIA is the sovereign wealth fund of Abu Dhabi, the capital
and largest emirate of the U.A.E. The Persian Gulf sheikhdom
holds about 6 percent of global crude reserves.  To contact the reporter on this story:
