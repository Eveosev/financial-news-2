Billionaire investor  Warren Buffett , the chairman and chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., comments on the investment appeal of gold. He spoke to reporters in Omaha,  Nebraska , on May 2.  Gold rallied 4.9 percent in the past two weeks after entering a bear market April 12. Futures in New York are still down 13 percent this year to $1,464.20 an ounce.  On whether he would buy gold after recent declines:  “No. Gold’s not reproduced or anything since I wrote about it a year or two ago. It just sits there, and you hope somebody pays you more for it.  ‘‘If gold went to $1,000 I wouldn’t be a buyer. If it went to $800, I wouldn’t be a buyer. It’s never interested me. If you go back to 1965, Berkshire was at $15 and gold was at $35, so you could’ve bought two shares of Berkshire for an ounce of gold, a little more than two shares. And so far, two shares of Berkshire’s been better.”  To contact the reporter on this story: Margaret Collins in  New York  at  mcollins45@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: Steve Stroth at  sstroth@bloomberg.net
