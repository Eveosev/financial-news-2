A Datanalisis poll shows that 58
percent of Venezuelans disapprove of the electoral council’s
refusal to allow opposition candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski’s request for votes cast in the April 14 election to be
cross checked against voter registry books, El Universal
reported.  The April 27-30  survey  found that 39.7 percent of winning
candidate Nicolas Maduro’s supporters disagreed with the
electoral council’s decision and 46 percent of his followers
disagreed with him being proclaimed the winner by the council,
according to El Universal.  The Caracas-based pollster found that 55.7 percent of
Venezuelans agreed with Capriles’s decision to contest the
results of the election at the  Supreme Court , El Universal said.  The telephone poll of 528 people had a margin of error of
4.27 percent, according to El Universal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
