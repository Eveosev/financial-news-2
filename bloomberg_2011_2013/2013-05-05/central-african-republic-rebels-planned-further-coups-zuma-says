 South African President  Jacob Zuma 
said rebels who ousted his counterpart in Central African
Republic were foreign-backed and planned to later topple
governments in  Chad  and  Democratic Republic  of Congo.  “They wanted to establish themselves there and then from
there target any country they wanted to target,” Zuma said
yesterday in an interview with the state-owned South African
Broadcasting Corp. “We cannot allow it.”  The so-called Seleka rebel alliance killed 14 South African
soldiers on March 24 as they stormed the Central African
Republic capital, Bangui, and ousted President Francois Bozize.  Zuma initially withdrew South African military trainers
from Bangui along with the combatants sent to protect them. He
has since endorsed the Seleka’s transitional government, which
has committed to holding elections within 18 months, and has
indicated he would support redeploying South African troops to
support the transition.  Seleka were backed by powers from outside the African
continent, Zuma said.  Authorities in Chad, the northern neighbor of landlocked
 Central African Republic , arrested two generals on May 1 for
their alleged role in what the government said was a failed coup
attempt in which at least eight people died.  Congo lies to the south of Central African Republic.  To contact the reporter on this story:
