Zimbabwe’s army chief, a key ally of
President  Robert Mugabe , said he won’t meet the prime minister
to discuss plans to reform the country’s security forces, state
media reported, a move that may affect elections scheduled for
this year.  “We have no time to meet sellouts,” Commander of Zimbabwe
Defence Forces, General Constantine Chiwenga, was cited as
saying in the Sunday Mail.  Prime Minister  Morgan Tsvangirai  last month said the
security forces need to be reformed before elections, planned to
take place before October, can be held. The prime minister’s
Movement for Democratic Change has accused the military and
police of supporting the Zimbabwe African National Union-
Patriotic Front party led by Mugabe.  The 15-nation  Southern African Development Community 
brokered a 2009 power-sharing agreement between Zimbabwe’s main
political parties after it ruled a presidential election the
previous year was void. The ballot, held concurrently with
parliamentary polls, led to the deaths of about 200 MDC
supporters, according to Tsvangirai.  Elections scheduled for this year will end a five-year
power-sharing agreement implemented by SADC, which brought an
end to a decade of political and economic crises that saw
inflation rise to 500 billion percent, according to the
 International Monetary Fund .  Tsvangirai’s spokesman couldn’t be reached for comments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
