Hideki Matsui, Most Valuable Player in
the 2009  World Series , and his former manager Shigeo Nagashima
received Japan’s People’s Honor awards at a ceremony today in
Tokyo, public broadcaster NHK reported.  Matsui  set a record for Japanese players with 175 home runs
in 10 Major League Baseball seasons, seven with the  New York
Yankees , after smashing 332 homers in 10 seasons with the
Yomiuri Giants in Japan. Nagashima, who managed the Giants for
much of Matsui’s tenure, was the team’s third-baseman from 1958
to 1974.  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe presented the awards at  Tokyo
Dome , home field of the Giants, NHK reported on its website.
Today’s date was chosen to honor Matsui’s longtime uniform
number 55, NHK said.  “We are honored and humbled to receive this award,” NHK
quoted Matsui as saying. “I’m going to do what I can to keep
supporting people in Japan who love baseball.”  Matsui, 38, announced his retirement as a player in
December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
