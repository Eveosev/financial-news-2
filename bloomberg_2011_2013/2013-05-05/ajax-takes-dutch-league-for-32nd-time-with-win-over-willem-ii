Ajax won the Dutch soccer league for a
record-extending 32nd time today with a 5-0 home victory over
the Eredivisie’s bottom team, Willem II.  Kolbeinn Sigthorsson and Christian Eriksen put Amsterdam-
based Ajax 2-0 up by halftime and the team added goals by Viktor
Fischer, Siem de Jong and Danny Hoesen after the break.  Ajax has 73 points, four more than second-placed PSV
Eindhoven with one game left. PSV had a 4-2 home win over NEC
while Feyenoord lost 2-0 at ADO Den Haag and has 66 points.  Coach Frank de Boer has now won three consecutive
titles with Ajax, a feat previously achieved only by Rinus
Michels and Louis van Gaal. The title means Ajax clinches a
place in  Europe ’s elite Champions League.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
