President  Barack Obama  will make the
first of a series of tours of U.S. towns and cities designed to
pressure Congress to move forward on second-term priorities
including the expansion of early childhood education and
infrastructure spending.  Obama will travel to Austin, Texas, on May 9 to visit high
school students and technology entrepreneurs as he seeks to
refocus on the initiatives laid out in his February  State of the
Union  address.  The events will resemble previous White House efforts
“that directly engage the American people and effectively
pushed Congress to act,” Obama spokesman  Josh Earnest  said
today in a statement.  Almost five months into his second term, Obama has been
bolstered by positive economic news that has sent the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average to record
highs. Still, his push to enact laws to expand background checks
on gun purchasers was defeated in Congress and lawmakers remain
in the early stages of changes in U.S. immigration laws.  To contact the reporter on this story:
