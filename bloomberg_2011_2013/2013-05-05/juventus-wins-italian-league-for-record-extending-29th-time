Juventus won the Italian soccer league
today for a record-extending 29th time with a 1-0 home victory
over Palermo. Ajax clinched the Dutch title.  Juventus, which also won the league last year, scored with
a 59th-minute penalty by  Arturo Vidal . The Turin-based team took
the championship with three games to spare. It has an unbeatable
14-point lead over Napoli, which hosts  Inter Milan  later today.  Juve’s Paul Pogba was red-carded after 83 minutes for
spitting at Salvatore Aronica.  Ajax won the Dutch league for a record-extending 32nd time,
and the third straight year, with a 5-0 home victory over the
Eredivisie’s bottom team, Willem II.  Kolbeinn Sigthorsson and Christian Eriksen put Amsterdam-
based Ajax 2-0 up by halftime and the team added goals by Viktor
Fischer, Siem de Jong and Danny Hoesen after the break.  Ajax has 73 points, four more than second-placed  PSV
Eindhoven  with one game left. PSV had a 4-2 home win over NEC
while Feyenoord lost 2-0 at ADO Den Haag and has 66 points.  Coach Frank de Boer is the third man to lead Ajax to
three consecutive league titles, after Rinus Michels and Louis van Gaal.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
