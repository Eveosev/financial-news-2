Explosions in Baghdad killed at least
six people including an official from the coalition that opposes
the Shiite-led national government, Al-Mada newspaper reported.  Mazin Abu Kalal, a member of former Iraqi Prime Minister
 Ayad Allawi â€™s opposition al-Iraqiya voting bloc, was killed as
he left his office in Kirkuk when two bombs were detonated
remotely, according to the newspaper.  Abu Kalal, head of the al-Iraqiya bloc in the province of
Kirkuk, was killed immediately and two of his guards were
wounded, the newspaper said.  Tensions have been on the rise since Sunnis began anti-
government protests in December to demand that Shiite Muslim
Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki share more power. They worsened
on April 23 when troops backed by helicopters stormed a plaza in
Hawija, killing at least 20 protesters.  Explosions in two Sunni neighborhoods of Baghdad yesterday
killed at least five people and injured more than 30, according
to Al-Mada.  Two people died and 13 were wounded when a bomb hidden in a
bag went off inside a cafe in Ameriyah, in western  Baghdad , the
newspaper said, citing security officials.  Three people were killed and 19 were injured by mortar
shells in Swaib, also in western Baghdad, the newspaper said,
citing a source in the interior ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
