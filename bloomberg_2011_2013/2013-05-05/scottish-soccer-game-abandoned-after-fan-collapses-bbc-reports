A Scottish Premier League soccer game
was abandoned today after a spectator collapsed and was
hospitalized, the British Broadcasting Corp. reported.  The incident happened at the start of the second half of
Kilmarnock’s home match with Hibernian. The game was halted by
referee Kevin Clancy with the scores tied at 1-1.  Medical staff attended to the man at the side of the field
before an ambulance arrived and he was taken to the hospital,
the  BBC  said. After the initial delay the game was abandoned.  “The length of time the players were off the park was a
problem but the overriding factor was respect for the fan and
his family,” Kilmarnock Chairman Michael Johnstone was cited as
saying by the BBC.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
