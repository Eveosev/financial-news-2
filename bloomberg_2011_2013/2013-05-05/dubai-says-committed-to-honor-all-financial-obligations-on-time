Dubai’s government redeemed 3.3
billion dirhams ($898 million) of bonds due in April and said it
was committed to repay obligations on time as it faces what
Moody’s Investors Service described as a “debt wall” in 2014.  The repayment “strengthens the government’s resolve to
honor all its financial obligations on time,” Department of
Finance Director General Abdulrahman Saleh Al Saleh said in an
e-mailed statement. The bonds were issued under the emirate’s 15
billion dirham medium-term note program in April 2008. The
government and its entities have $31 billion of debt due next
year, according to International Monetary Fund data.  Investor confidence in Dubai has improved after three
state-linked companies paid or refinanced $3.75 billion of debt
in 2012, helping the emirate’s bonds rally. The economy is set
to expand at an average rate of 4.6 percent between 2012 and
2015, more than twice the average of the previous four years,
according to government forecasts. The  benchmark stock index  has
surged 34 percent this year.  “Dubai’s economy is showing some strength, and that
indicates higher potential for the government to manage its
debt,” said Tariq Qaqish, head of asset management at Dubai-
based Al Mal Capital PSC. Still, “Dubai has a lot to repay,”
he said.  Moody’s said in March that Dubai, which almost defaulted on
debt in 2009, faces a “pivotal year” in 2014 when $20 billion
of direct government debt becomes due.  The emirate’s credit default swaps, which at  192 basis
points  are at the lowest since 2008, are still 127 basis points
higher than the contracts of  Abu Dhabi , its oil-rich neighbor,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Even though the repayment will have an impact on investor
confidence, it doesn’t reduce the emirate’s risk,” said Qaqish.
“There’s a long way between repaying 3.3 billion dirhams and
the billions of dollars outstanding.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
