Israel ’s Cabinet today approved
Finance Minister Yair Lapid’s proposal to raise the government’s
budget deficit limit to 4.65 percent of gross domestic product
from an initial 3 percent target.  The decision comes just three days after Standard & Poor’s
lowered the country’s local currency rating to A+/A-1 from AA-
/A-1+, citing “recent fiscal slippage.” The S&P downgrade came
hours after Lapid’s proposal to raise the deficit to 4.9 percent
was reported. Lapid backpedaled following the downgrade and
criticism from analysts.  Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  called early elections in
October after concluding he would not win government approval
for the budget cuts necessary to reach the 3 percent deficit
target. Parliament has less than three months to approve the
spending plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
