Floyd Mayweather Jr., fighting for the
first time since serving two months in jail for domestic
violence, won a unanimous decision again Robert Guerrero to
remain undefeated in 44 bouts and retain his World Boxing
Council welterweight title.  Mayweather, 36, went 12 rounds with the 30-year-old
Guerrero at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in  Las Vegas , winning by
117-111 on each of the three judges’ cards.  “It was an amazing night,” Mayweather said in a televised
interview. “He was a true warrior.”  Mayweather landed 153 of 254 power punches for 60 percent
compared with 81 of 290 for Guerrero.  “The less you get hurt in this sport, the longer you
last,” said Mayweather who wore yellow snakeskin trunks. “I
feel bad I didn’t get a knockout tonight, but I hurt my hand
midway through the fight.”  Mayweather, who was named Forbes magazine’s highest-paid
athlete after receiving $85 million for two fights in 2011,
earned $32 million to take on Guerrero who got $3 million.  The winner still has five fights ahead of him on Showtime,
although his next opponent in September has not been named.  “I had good work for this fight,” Mayweather said.  Mayweather, who weighed 146 pounds, has 26 knockouts in his
44 fights. Guerrero, fighting at 147 pounds, has 18 knockouts in
31 wins, two losses and one draw.  “He was barely slipping by punches,” Guerrero said.
“He’s a great fighter. He was on his game tonight.”  Since Mayweather’s last fight a year ago against  Miguel
Cotto , he spent more than two months in jail for assaulting the
mother of his children.  “I wouldn’t wish being locked up 23 hours a day with one
out on anyone,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
