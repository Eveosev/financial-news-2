Sinopec Engineering Group Co. , a unit
of  China ’s biggest refiner, and China Galaxy Securities Co. plan
to raise a total of as much as $3.6 billion in  Hong Kong ’s two
biggest initial public offerings this year, according to people
familiar with the matters.  The Beijing-based unit of China Petrochemical Corp. plans
to offer 1.33 billion shares at HK$9.8 to HK$13.1 each, raising
a potential HK$17.4 billion ($2.24 billion), two of the people
said. Galaxy Securities, a brokerage controlled by China’s
sovereign wealth fund, may sell 1.57 billion shares at HK$4.99
to HK$6.77 apiece, raising as much as HK$10.6 billion, according
to two separate people. They asked not to be identified because
the information is private.  The share sales may help Hong Kong IPOs recover after their
value dropped to the lowest in four years in the first quarter.
Companies raised $1.1 billion from initial share sales in the
city in the first three months, the least since early 2009,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Sinopec Engineering builds facilities and provides oilfield
services, according to Sinopec Group’s website. The  price range 
values the company at nine to 12 times estimated 2013 earnings,
according to the two people with knowledge of the matter.  Wison Engineering Services Co. (2236) , a Chinese provider of
engineering and construction services for the petrochemical
industry, raised $239 million from a Hong Kong IPO in December.
The company has gained 37 percent from its offer price, trading
at  10.1 times  estimated 2013 profit, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  An external spokeswoman for Sinopec Engineering declined to
comment on the offering.  Galaxy Valuation  Galaxy Securities’s price range values the company at 1.19
to 1.49 times estimated 2013 book value, according to the two
people with knowledge of the matter. The valuation is lower than
those of the biggest publicly traded brokerages from China, they
said.  Cornerstone investors of the offer include insurer  AIA
Group Ltd. (1299)  with an investment of $50 million and Khazanah
Nasional Bhd,  Malaysia ’s sovereign wealth fund, with $100
million, the people said. Cornerstone investors typically agree
to hold their stock for six months in return for guaranteed
allocation in an IPO.  Founded in January 2007, Galaxy Securities is controlled by
Central Huijin Investment Ltd., a unit of China Investment
Corp., according to the brokerage’s  website .  An external spokeswoman for Galaxy Securities declined to
comment on the share offering.  To contact the reporters on this story:
