Saudi Arabian Oil Co., the largest
crude exporter, raised the premium used to determine June
official selling prices for its Arab Light blend for customers
in Asia and cut premiums for other light grades to the  Far East .  The state-owned producer, known as Saudi Aramco, increased
the monthly premium for the  Light blend  by 20 cents a barrel to
$2 more than the average of Oman and Dubai grades, the company
said today in an e-mailed statement. The discount for Arab Heavy
to Asia narrowed by 70 cents a barrel to 70 cents a barrel less
than the Gulf benchmarks.  The Light blend’s increase met the median expectations of
five refiners in China and Japan surveyed by  Bloomberg News  last
week. The spread between Light and Heavy crudes fell to $2.70 a
barrel, according to Bloomberg calculations.  Persian Gulf oil producers such as  Saudi Arabia  sell most
of their crude under long-term contracts to refiners. Most of
the region’s state oil companies price their oil at a premium or
discount to a benchmark.  Saudi Aramco  cut the premium for the Super Light grade to
Asia by $1.10 a barrel, to $3.70 a barrel more than the
benchmarks, and cut Extra Light by $0.25 a barrel, to a $2.65 a
barrel premium.  Arab Light crude to the U.S. was cut $0.25 a barrel, to a
$0.35 a-barrel premium to the Argus Sour Crude Index, according
to the statement. The discount for June shipments of Arab Light
crude to Northwest  Europe  narrowed by $1.45 a barrel, to $1.65 a
barrel less than the Brent benchmark, according the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
