Treasury 10-year yields soared the
most since March in the first week of the year after the U.S.
avoided the so-called fiscal cliff and Federal Reserve minutes
showed policy makers differ over the scope of asset purchases.  The 10-year yield reached 1.97 percent yesterday, its
highest level since April 26, before dropping after the Labor
Department released a report showing the U.S.  unemployment rate 
was unchanged at 7.8 percent in December. Several policy makers
thought the Fed should curb its asset purchases, a policy known
as quantitative easing, “well before the end of 2013,”
according to a record of the central bank’s Dec. 11-12 meeting.
The U.S. will sell $66 billion of notes and bonds next week.  “We’re past the fiscal cliff,” said Donald Ellenberger,
who oversees about $10 billion as co-head of government and
mortgage-backed securities at Federated Investors in Pittsburgh.
“The Fed told us they might be ending quantitative easing
sooner than I and many other market participants were expecting.
When you look at the bigger landscape, the market does seem to
be setting up for a move higher in yields.”  The benchmark  10-year note yield  rose 20 basis points, or
0.20 percentage point, to 1.90 percent this week in  New York .
The price of the 1.625 percent note due in November 2022
decreased 1 3/4, or $17.50 per $1,000 face amount, to 97 17/32,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices.  The jump in yield was the biggest since a 27-basis-point
rise the week ended March 16, on expectations the economy was
gaining strength.  Three Days  A separate report showed payrolls rose by 155,000 workers
last month, following a revised 161,000 advance in November that
was more than initially estimated, the Labor Department said in
 Washington . The median estimate of 82 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg called for an increase of 152,000.  The 10-year yield rose 21 basis points in three days, Dec.
31-Jan. 3 -- the market was closed New Year’s Day -- the largest
three-day rise in yield since the period from March 13-15, after
the central bank raised its assessment of the economy and said
strains in global financial markets had abated.  Treasury yields climbed on Dec. 31 on increasing optimism
that Congress would reach a deficit deal and again on Jan. 2
after the  House of Representatives  voted in favor of the
Senate’s budget legislation.  ‘Rough Response’  U.S. government debt  declined Jan. 3 after minutes of the
Fed’s last meeting showed “several” policy makers thought the
central bank should end its $85 billion monthly bond purchases
before the end of 2013.  “The market had a very, very rough response to those FOMC
minutes,” said  David Ader , head of U.S. government-bond
strategy at CRT Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “It
causes technical damage, people find themselves under water and
a mortgage market that was 100 percent confident they’d have a
full year worth of buying has to wonder about that.”  The central bank on Dec. 12 said it would hold borrowing
costs low “at least as long” as the  unemployment rate  remains
above 6.5 percent and inflation projections are for no more than
2.5 percent. The jobless rate had stayed above 8 percent since
February 2009 until it broke the trend in September.  The central bank bought $2.3 trillion of Treasury and
mortgage-related debt from 2008 to 2011 in two rounds of
purchases, known as quantitative easing, or QE.  Budget Deal  Risk appetite rose after Congress approved the deal to
avoid raising taxes on 99 percent of Americans, averting $600
billion in automatic tax increases and spending cuts would have
started this month, moves that the  Congressional Budget Office 
said might lead to recession this year.  While Congress’s budget measure averts most of the
immediate pain of more than $600 billion in tax increases and
federal spending cuts, it is only one step toward controlling
the federal deficit, an issue that will return with a February
fight over whether and how the  debt ceiling  should be raised.  Volatility in Treasuries reached the highest level in
almost two months on Jan. 3. Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s
MOVE index, which measures price swings of U.S. government
securities based on options, rose to 63.5 basis points, the most
since Nov. 6. The 2012 average was 69.8 basis points.  Yields on 10-year debt gained 14 basis points in December,
the biggest monthly increase since a 24-basis-point jump in
March, as better-than-forecast economic data led to a 3.1
percent annual gross domestic product growth rate in the third
quarter, beating the 2.8 percent forecast, the Commerce
Department reported Dec. 20.  Term Premium  U.S. government securities traded this week close to the
least expensive levels in eight months. The 10-year term
premium, a model created by economists at the Fed that includes
expectations for  interest rates , growth and inflation, touched
negative 0.67 percent yesterday, the least costly since May.  A negative reading indicates investors are willing to
accept yields below what’s considered fair value. The average
last year was negative 0.77 percent.  The Fed will sell $32 billion of three-year notes, $21
billion of 10-year notes and $13 billion of 30-year bonds over
three days starting Jan. 8. The amounts are the same as at the
previous auctions of the securities in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
