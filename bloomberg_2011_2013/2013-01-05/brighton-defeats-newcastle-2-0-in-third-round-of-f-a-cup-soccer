Brighton beat 10-man Newcastle 2-0,
knocking the Premier League club out of English soccer’s F.A.
Cup for the second straight year.  Andrea Orlandi opened the scoring in the 33rd minute at
Brighton’s Amex Stadium. Newcastle’s Shola Ameobi was sent off
in the 63rd minute for a second yellow card and Will Hoskins
clinched the victory with three minutes remaining.  Brighton, which is ninth in the second-tier Championship,
beat Newcastle 1-0 in the fourth round last season.  Chelsea opens its F.A. Cup title defense later today at
Southampton as Premier League clubs enter the competition. In
other matchups involving top-flight teams, West Ham hosts
Manchester United and West Brom visits Queens Park Rangers.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
