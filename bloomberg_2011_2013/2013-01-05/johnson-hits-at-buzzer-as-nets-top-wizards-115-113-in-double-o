Joe Johnson  hit an 18-foot jump shot
with seven-tenths of a second left in the second overtime to
give the Brooklyn Nets a 115-113 victory over the  Washington
Wizards .  Washington’s Bradley Beal tied the double overtime 113-113
on two free throws with nine seconds left. Johnson put the Nets
ahead and Jordan Crawford missed a 25-foot three-pointer at the
buzzer for the loss on his home court at Verizon Center.  “That’s what big-time players do,” Nets interim coach
P.J. Carlesimo, who is 4-1 with the team, said about Johnson.
“We put him in a good position to make the play, and he made
the play.”  At the end of the first overtime,  Deron Williams  gave the
Nets a 104-101 lead with three seconds left before Beal sunk a
27-foot three-point jumper at the buzzer to force the second
overtime.  “Just went down to the wire,” Beal said. “There was
nothing they were really doing that was killing us. We were
neck-and-neck the whole time.”  The Wizards had a 10-point lead after the first quarter and
owned a 55-52 halftime advantage. Crawford tied the game 91-91
with 56 seconds left in the game. Brook Lopez gave the Nets a
93-91 lead with three seconds left before Nenê tied the game at
93-93 with a nine-foot basket.  Lopez had 27 points and 13 rebounds, Williams added 24
points and 10 assists and Johnson contributed 18 points for the
Nets.  Beal scored 24 points, Crawford had 23 points and Nenê
added 20 for the Wizards, who have lost four straight games.  Brooklyn (18-15) is in second place in the Eastern
Conference’s five-team  Atlantic Division , 4 1/2 games behind the
 New York Knicks  (22-10). Washington (4-27) is in last place, 18
games behind the  Miami Heat  (22-9) in the five-team Southeast
Division.  To contact the reporter on this story:
