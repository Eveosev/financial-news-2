Romanee-Conti Burgundy underpinned
wine and spirit sales at Bonhams last year as prices for top
Bordeaux wines including Chateau Lafite-Rothschild fell and
total auction volumes declined.  Top lots sold in 2012 included a case of Romanee-Conti
1985, which fetched 92,000 pounds ($148,600) in  London  in July,
and 12 bottles of Romanee-Conti 1988 Domaine de la Romanee-
Conti, which sold for HK$1.05 million ($135,100) in Hong Kong in
November, according to e-mailed data from Bonhams.  Bonhams wine and spirit sales fell 11 percent globally to
$15.1 million last year from $17 million in 2011, after gains of
36 percent in 2011 and 41 percent in 2010. The drop, reflecting
lower Bordeaux prices, came as the Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index
fell 9.7 percent last year. Last year’s sales, which included
whisky auctions, were still 21 percent above 2010 levels.  “We are in for a period of stable prices for some time,
except for the very rare and unique,” Richard Harvey, Senior
International Director of Bonhams wine department, said. “I
believe that there will be significant selling of stock by some
of the wine investment funds over the next three years. If large
amounts come onto the market, that can only depress prices.”  The biggest decline came in the U.S., where sales fell 26
percent. Wine and spirits auctions in the U.K., the London-based
house’s biggest market, dropped 7 percent while those in  Hong
Kong  fell 1 percent. The U.K. accounted for 49 percent of wine
and spirit sales, the U.S. 29 percent and Hong Kong the rest.  Top Bordeaux wines sold by Bonhams during 2012 included a
case of Chateau Petrus 1982, which fetched 43,700 pounds in
London last month, and 12 bottles of Lafite, which sold for
HK$368,900 in May.  Following are principal wine auction results last year from
