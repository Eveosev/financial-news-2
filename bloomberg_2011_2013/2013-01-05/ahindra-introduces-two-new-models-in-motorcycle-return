Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. (MM) ,  India ’s
biggest sport-utility vehicle maker, unveiled two motorcycle
models as it plans to reenter the market two years after
withdrawing its debut model because of a flawed gearbox.  The company will introduce the Centuro and Pantero models
with 110 cc engines, it said in a statement today, without
saying when the models will go on sale or how much they would
cost. Mahindra introduced the Stallio in September 2010 and
withdrew it in 2011 after discovering the gearbox glitch, The
Economic Times reported at the time.  Mahindra, also India’s largest tractor maker, began making
scooters in 2008 after buying Kinetic Motor Co. to increase
sales in the world’s second-biggest two-wheeler market, where
the vehicles outsell cars more than seven-to-one. Indian two-
wheeler sales grew 4 percent to 9.24 million units in the eight
months through November, compared with a 1.3 percent increase in
passenger car sales, according to data from the  Society of
Indian Automobile Manufacturers .  The company had said in July 2010 that it aimed to make its
two-wheeler business as large as its tractor and sport-utility
vehicle businesses within seven years. Mahindra Two Wheelers
Ltd., which is 88.5 percent owned by Mahindra, lost 2.4 billion
rupees in the year ended March 31, 2012, according to the
company’s annual report.  China  is the world’s largest market for two-wheeled
vehicles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
