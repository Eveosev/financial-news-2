The U.S. defeated Sweden 3-1 to win
the world junior ice hockey championship for the third time.  Rocco Grimaldi scored twice in the second period in Ufa,
 Russia , and Vince Trocheck clinched the victory with an empty-
net goal in the final minute. U.S. goaltender John Gibson made
26 saves, allowing only a power-play goal to Filip Sandberg in
the second period.  The U.S. had previously won the title in 2004 and 2010.
Sweden was the defending champion.  Russia beat Canada 6-5 in overtime earlier today in the
bronze-medal game.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
