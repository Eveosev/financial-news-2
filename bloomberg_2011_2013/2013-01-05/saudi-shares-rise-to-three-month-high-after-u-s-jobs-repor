     Jan. 5 (Bloomberg) -- Saudi Arabia ’s benchmark stock index
rose to the highest in more than three months after a U.S. jobs
report beat an estimate and boosted global markets while
investors await domestic fourth-quarter earnings.  Al Rajhi Bank, the kingdom’s biggest bank by market value,
climbed the most since Nov. 21, while  Etihad Etisalat Co. (EEC) , the
country’s second-largest telecommunications operator, increased
to the highest level in six years. Saudi Basic Industries Corp.,
known as Sabic, advanced to the highest since Dec. 22.  The  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  gained 1 percent to 7,010 by
the close in Riyadh. That’s the highest since Sept. 22,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Saudi Arabia’s stock
exchange is the only Persian Gulf bourse that trades on
Saturdays.  The  S&P 500 (SPX)  rose to the highest since December 2007
yesterday, gaining after a U.S. Labor Department report showed
155,000 jobs were added last month. That was higher than a
median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg, which
called for a 152,000 increase.  “The market reacted to positive jobs numbers out of the
U.S. and the S&P hitting a five-year high,” Asim Bukhtiar,
senior analyst at Riyad Capital, said in an e-mailed response to
questions. “Domestically, the earnings season kicks off this
week and investors are positioning ahead of results
announcements.”  Al Rajhi Bank increased 1.1 percent to 67.5 riyals ($18),
while Etihad Etisalat climbed 2.3 percent to 78.5 riyals. Sabic,
the world’s largest petrochemical maker, rose 0.8 percent to
92.25 riyals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
