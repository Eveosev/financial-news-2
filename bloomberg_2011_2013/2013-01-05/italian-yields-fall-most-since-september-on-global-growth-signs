Italian and Spanish notes advanced
this week, with yields dropping the most since September, as
signs the global economy is recovering spurred demand for
higher-yielding assets.  Italy ’s  two-year yields  fell to the lowest in more than two
years as U.S. lawmakers agreed a budget deal to avoid the so-
called fiscal cliff and reports showed the American job market
and German retail sales improved. German 10-year yields climbed
to the highest in three months as investor appetite for safer
assets waned. Economists predict the  European Central Bank  will
keep its key rate at a record low next week to encourage growth.  “The removal of the fiscal-cliff uncertainty was positive
for risky assets and that led to a rally in peripheral bonds,”
including those from Italy and  Spain , said Mohit Kumar, London-
based head of European  interest-rate  strategy at Deutsche Bank
AG,  Germany ’s biggest bank. “In  Europe , expectations for
economic data are so low that there is some room for some upside
and Spanish and Italian data has been surprising.”  Italy’s two-year yield fell 32 basis points, or 0.32
percentage point, this week to 1.68 percent, the biggest decline
since the period ending Sept. 7. The 6 percent note due November
2014 rose 0.53, or 5.30 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,305) face
amount, to 107.835. The rate dropped to 1.62 percent yesterday,
the lowest since October 2010.  The yield on similar-maturity Spanish notes declined 46
basis points this week to 2.43 percent.  Service Industries  A gauge of Italy’s  service industries  climbed to 45.6 in
December from 44.6 the previous month, London-based Markit
Economics said yesterday. An index of Spanish services rose to
44.3 from 42.4, a separate report from Markit showed. Readings
below 50 indicate contraction.  The data “are clearly signs that activity has bottomed,”
 James Nixon , chief European economist at Societe Generale SA in
 London , wrote in a note to clients. “The pace of the recession
is not getting any worse.”  German, Dutch and Austrian bonds all declined this week as
the U.S. House of Representatives voted in favor of the Senate’s
budget legislation. The 257-167 bipartisan vote on Jan. 1 ended
a yearlong impasse over how to avert $600 billion in tax
increases and spending cuts that were due to take effect at the
start of the year.  German  10-year yields  climbed 23 basis points over the week
to 1.54 percent after rising to 1.56 percent yesterday, the
highest since Oct. 26.  The ECB will leave its key interest rate at 0.75 percent on
Jan. 10, according to the median estimate of 55 economists in a
Bloomberg survey. Five predict the central bank will lower the
benchmark to 0.5 percent.  Spain plans to sell debt maturing in March 2015, January
2018 and July 2026 on the same day.  German bonds returned 4.5 percent last year, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Italy’s debt gained 21 percent and
Spain’s returned 6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
