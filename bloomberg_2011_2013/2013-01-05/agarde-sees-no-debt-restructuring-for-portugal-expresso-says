International Monetary Fund Managing
Director  Christine Lagarde  said debt restructuring is not on the
table for  Portugal  and the country’s authorities are determined
to continue their aid program to regain access to bond markets,
Expresso reported, citing an interview.  Portugal’s aid program is on the “right path” and a
significant part of the adjustment has been carried out, Lagarde
was cited as saying by the newspaper. The IMF is worried about
the increase in  unemployment , she said in the interview, carried
out in mid-December.  The IMF chief also said it’s a matter for the  European
Central Bank  whether it decides to buy the government bonds of
countries such as Ireland and Portugal under its Outright
Monetary Transactions program.  Lagarde said  Greece  must focus on its reform program as its
European partners and other creditors have gone “very far”
with their support, according to the newspaper.  The IMF says the focus of budget cuts should be structural
targets and not nominal targets, Lagarde told Expresso. Fiscal
policies should be accompanied by accommodative monetary
policies, she said.  Lagarde also said she doesn’t expect a hard landing for the
Chinese economy at this time, according to Expresso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
