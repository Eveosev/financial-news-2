Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Janet Yellen said Fed communication of its policy aims plays a “big
role” in supporting the economy now that the central bank’s
benchmark interest rate is close to zero.  The Federal Open Market Committee last month linked its
policy to economic indicators for the first time, saying it will
keep rates low as long as the  unemployment rate  is above 6.5
percent and the outlook for inflation is no more than 2.5
percent. The Fed previously said it will maintain  low rates 
through at least mid-2015.  “Communications play a big role” in monetary policy,
Yellen said.  The Fed can change the interest it pays on excess bank
reserves when it comes time for the Fed to begin withdrawing its
record stimulus, Yellen said on a panel today at the American
Economic Association’s annual meeting in San Diego.  To contact the reporter on this story:
