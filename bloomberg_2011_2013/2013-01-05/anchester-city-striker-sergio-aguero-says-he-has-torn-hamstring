Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero
said he has a torn hamstring and is being treated in  Italy .  Aguero sat out today’s 3-0 F.A. Cup win over Watford after
suffering the injury in a Premier League victory against Stoke
on New Year’s Day.  “The studies confirmed I have a torn muscle,” Aguero
posted on his Twitter account today. “We have to keep on
thinking positive and try to recover in the best way possible.
For that, I’ve travelled to Italy where a specialist is treating
me.”  Aguero has scored 10 goals this season and is tied for the
team lead with Edin Dzeko.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
