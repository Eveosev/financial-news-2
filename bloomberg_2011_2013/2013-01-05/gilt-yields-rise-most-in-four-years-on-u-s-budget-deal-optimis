U.K.  government bonds  fell, pushing
10-year yields to the biggest weekly gain in four years, as U.S.
lawmakers reached a deal to avert automatic tax increases and
spending cuts, curbing demand for the safest assets.  The drop sent 10-year rates above 2 percent for the first
time since May 10. German bunds and U.S. Treasuries slid and
stocks rose as economic data added to evidence the U.S. recovery
is being sustained. The  Bank of England  said on Jan. 3 its
Funding for Lending credit-boosting program had increased
mortgage and company loan availability. Policy makers meet Jan.
10 to consider extending quantitative-easing stimulus measures.
The pound fell for a third week against the dollar.  “There has been a big improvement in risk appetite after
U.S. fiscal negotiations seemed to go the right way and that has
been the principal mover of gilts,” said Jason Simpson, a
fixed-income strategist at Banco Santander SA in  London . “We
are bearish on gilts because we don’t think the BOE is going to
come back in with more asset purchases. The Funding for Lending
scheme seems to be gaining a bit of traction.”  Benchmark yields rose 30 basis points, or 0.30 percentage
point, since Dec. 28, the biggest weekly gain since January
2009. They touched 2.14 percent yesterday, the most since April
30. The yield fell to a record 1.41 percent on July 23. The 1.75
percent bond maturing in September 2022 fell 2.58, or 25.80
pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,603) face amount, to 96.78 at 5 p.m.
London time yesterday.  Pound Decline  The pound fell 0.7 percent to $1.6036. It touched $1.6010,
the lowest level since Dec. 7, after a report yesterday showed
U.K. services unexpectedly shrank for the first time in two
years in December, clouding the economic outlook as Britain
struggles to avoid a triple-dip recession. Sterling gained for
the first week in four against the euro, appreciating 0.5
percent to 81.36 pence.  Gilts have underperformed their counterparts in  Germany  and
 France  since  Standard & Poor’s  lowered the outlook on Britain’s
top credit rating to negative on Dec. 13, citing weak economic
growth and a worsening debt profile.  The  extra yield  investors demand to hold 10-year gilts
instead of bunds widened to 59 basis points on Jan. 3, the most
since September 2011. Yields on the U.K. bond climbed above
those of its French equivalent for the first time since April
2011 yesterday.  The Bank of England will announce its latest decision on
monetary policy next week, with all economists in a Bloomberg
survey forecasting asset purchases will be kept at 375 billion
pounds and a separate survey forecasting interest rates will
remain at a record-low 0.5 percent. The Debt Management Office
plans to sell as much as 1.5 billion pounds of securities
maturing in 2030 on Jan. 8.  Gilts lost 2 percent in the week through Jan. 4, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Germany’s bonds dropped 1 percent
and those of France slid 0.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
