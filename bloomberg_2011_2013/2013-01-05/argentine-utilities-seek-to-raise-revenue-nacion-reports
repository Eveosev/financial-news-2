Some Argentine power companies sent
letters to the government last month asking for a change in the
regulatory framework which caps rates, the newspaper La Nacion
reported, without saying how it obtained the information.  Electricity companies including  Central Puerto SA (CEPU2) , Endesa
Costanera S.A. and Central Termica Loma de la Lata SA told
Deputy Economy Minister Axel Kicillof they need higher revenue
to afford salary increases for their unions, La Nacion reported.  The Argentine government has kept caps on utility rates
since the countryâ€™s 2002 financial crises, La Nacion said.
Companies filed for bankruptcy protection and others left the
country as inflation at an estimated 25 percent caused costs to
rise faster than revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
