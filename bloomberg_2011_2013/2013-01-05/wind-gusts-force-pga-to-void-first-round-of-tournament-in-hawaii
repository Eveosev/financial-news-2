The opening round scores from the  PGA
Tour ’s Hyundai Tournament of Champions were voided when gusting
winds created unplayable conditions in Maui.  The first round will be repeated today by players who will
start on No. 1 and No. 10 tees. Officials plan to complete
rounds one and two today.  Golfers yesterday played through frequent rain squalls as
wind gusts topped 40 miles per hour (64 kph) and the temperature
reached 72 degrees Fahrenheit (22 Celsius). Twenty-four of the
30-player field had teed off before the round was canceled.  Play was suspended for seven minutes shortly after noon
with wind gusts of 41 mph and again 20 minutes later when winds
blew at 45 mph, which prompted the cancellation of the round.  The last time the PGA Tour declared “play null and void”
and restarted a round came in the second round at the 2005
 Players Championship . The last time wind was a factor was during
the 2012 AT&T National when overnight damage caused the start of
the round to be delayed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
