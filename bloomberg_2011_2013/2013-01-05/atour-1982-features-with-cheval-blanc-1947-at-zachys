Bordeaux wines from the 1982 vintage,
including a case of  Chateau Latour  and a six-liter imperial of
Chateau Mouton-Rothschild, will go on sale at Zachys  Hong Kong 
auction later this week as auctions resume after the New Year.  Wines for sale also include 12 bottles of Chateau Cheval
Blanc 1947 from Saint Emilion and Burgundies including a case of
Romanee Saint Vivant 1996 Domaine de la  Romanee Conti  and 12
bottles of La Tache 2005 DRC, according to New York-based Zachys
 website .  Wine sales by the biggest auction houses plunged 19 percent
in 2012 as economic and political uncertainty in  China  cooled
demand for trophy-name Bordeaux. The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index
fell 9.7 percent last year as buying from China, the main driver
of growth in the international trade for investment wines, was
sluggish in the first three quarters.  New York-based  Acker Merrall & Condit  also has an auction
scheduled in Hong Kong for late January while  Sothebyâ€™s (BID)  has a
London sale in the wake of its U.K. auction last month, which
fetched $1.39 million and featured wines from Burgundy producer
Henri Jayer.  Following is a list of global wine sales taking place this
weekend and scheduled for the rest of this year. Dates may be
subject to revision, and links are to auction house sale
catalogs and websites.
