(Corrects to say annual inflation slowed in the second
paragraph of story published on Jan. 5.)  Colombia ’s consumer prices rose 0.09
percent in December from a month earlier, the national
statistics agency said.  Annual  inflation  slowed to 2.44 percent, according to the
report posted on the agency’s website. Economists expected
monthly inflation of 0.26 percent and annual inflation of 2.61
percent, according to the median estimates of analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg.  Colombia targets inflation of 2 percent to 4 percent.
Policy makers last month lowered the target lending rate by a
quarter-percentage point to 4.25 percent to revive a slowing
economy. Central bank chief Jose Dario Uribe has said the
economy likely grew less than 4 percent in 2012, after expanding
5.9 percent in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
