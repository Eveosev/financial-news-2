Johnny Manziel ran for two touchdowns
and passed for two scores as ninth-ranked  Texas A&M University 
defeated No. 11 University of  Oklahoma  41-13 in college
football’s Cotton Bowl.  The Heisman Trophy freshman quarterback set a Cotton Bowl
record with 516 total yards, including 287 passing yards last
night at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington,  Texas .  “There wasn’t anything holding us back,” Manziel said.
“No rust, there was no nothing. We played as a unit. To go out
and win 11 games and do what we’ve done, is impressive.”  Manziel ran 23 yards for a touchdown on the Aggies’ first
drive, and ran five yards for a second score for a 14-13
halftime lead.  Michael Hunnicutt kicked back-to-back field goals of 23 and
24 yards, and Landry Jones connected with Justin Brown on a six-
yard pass in the first half for the Sooners’ only points.  Jones completed 35 of 48 passing attempts for 278 yards,
one touchdown and one interception for Oklahoma (10-3).  Texas A&M  (11-2) scored 27 points in the second half on Ben
Malena’s seven-yard dash, Trey Williams’s 30-yard run, and
Manziel’s two touchdown passes to Ryan Swope and Uzoma
Nwachukwu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
