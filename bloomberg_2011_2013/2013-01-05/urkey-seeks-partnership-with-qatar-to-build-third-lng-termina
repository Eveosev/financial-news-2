Turkey is seeking investment from
Qatar to build the country’s third liquid natural-gas terminal,
which may be located close to the country’s borders with Greece
and  Bulgaria , Turkish Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said.  “It will help meet the needs of Greece and Bulgaria and
reduce shipments through the straits” of the Bosporus and the
Dardanelles, Yildiz told reporters today while flying to
 Algeria . The terminal would handle at least 5 billion to 6
billion cubic meters, he said.  Qatar, the world’s biggest LNG producer, may carry out a
feasibility study for the project and private Turkish companies
will probably be involved in its development, according to the
minister.  “There are companies that already have licenses and there
are some new companies that may also apply for licenses” to
build and operate LNG terminals, Yildiz said. “If there is no
interest,  Turkey  is ready to do it.”  The subject will be discussed for the first time during a
visit to Qatar on Jan. 7, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
