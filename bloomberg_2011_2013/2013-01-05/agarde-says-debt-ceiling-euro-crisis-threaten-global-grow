Failure to find a solution to the
U.S. debt-ceiling debate and matters in Europe will result in a
“major world economic crisis,” International Monetary Fund
Managing Director  Christine Lagarde  said.  Without a resolution, there will be a crisis “due to the
size of the economies of these two and their relationship with
other countries in terms of trade and investment,” she told
reporters in the Malawian capital, Lilongwe, today.  While the  U.S. Congress  approved a deal to avoid raising
taxes on most Americans in the so-called fiscal cliff, policy
makers need to agree on raising the $16.4 trillion debt ceiling,
which it reached on Dec. 31, according to the Treasury
Department. Extraordinary measures the agency is taking will be
exhausted as early as mid-February, the  Congressional Budget
Office  said.  In Europe, growth has weakened as a crisis over debt levels
among some member nations continued into a third year.  The U.S. and European issues will affect  developing
countries  including African nations, which also face risks from
rising food prices, Lagarde said.  “In this context, it will be essential for African
countries to have strong macroeconomic frameworks, improve
institutional capacity, and ensure sustainable and inclusive
growth in order to maintain the impressive economic performances
of the last 10 years,” she said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
