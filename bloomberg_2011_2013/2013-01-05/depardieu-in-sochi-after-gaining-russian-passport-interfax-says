Gerard Depardieu , the French actor
who was granted Russian citizenship two days ago, has flown to
the Black Sea resort of Sochi, Interfax reported, citing
unidentified airport officials.  Depardieu, who said heâ€™s moving to Belgium to flee taxes
imposed on the wealthy by Socialist President  Francois Hollande ,
may be formally handed his passport while there, the Moscow-
based news service said.  Russian President Vladimir Putin on Jan. 3 toured skiing
facilities near Sochi, which will host the 2014 Winter Olympics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
