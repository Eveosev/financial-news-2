Sonova Holding AG (SOON)  was fined 2
million Swiss francs ($2.1 million) by Zurich’s stock exchange
for not announcing a reduced profit forecast immediately after
learning that sales figures had missed company estimates.  Sonova’s statement on March 16, 2011, that earnings
wouldn’t meet its forecast came 12 days after it should have
been issued, the SIX Swiss Exchange said in a  statement .  The company, the world’s biggest hearing-aid maker by
sales, cooperated with the exchange’s Sanction Commission in
submitting information for the investigation, the exchange said.  Sonova “accepts the decision, even though we do not agree
with every aspect of the assessment and reasoning by the
Sanction Commission,” Robert Spoerry, chairman of the board at
Staefa, Switzerland-based Sonova, said in a separate statement.
“We will not appeal against this decision.”  Sonova is also under investigation by the Zurich
prosecutor’s office over whether executives used prior knowledge
of the warning to sell 2.4 million shares before the stock
plummeted 23 percent on the day of the announcement.  Former finance chief Oliver Walker is no longer being
investigated for  insider trading , Corinne Bouvard, a spokeswoman
for the prosecutor’s office, said in an e-mail yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
