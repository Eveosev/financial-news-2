Bouygues SA (EN)  Chief Executive Officer
Martin Bouygues asked French lawmakers to block  Iliad SA (ILD)  from
renewing its mobile-phone roaming agreement with the former
state monopoly  France Telecom SA (FTE) , Le Figaro reported.  Iliad also should be stopped from extending a six-year
agreement signed last year and worth a billion euros in revenue
for France Telecom over the first three years for new ultra-fast
4G wireless technology, Figaro said, citing a letter from
Bouygues to lawmakers.  The French market had become unbalanced due to Iliad’s
limited investments in its mobile network, since it became
France’s fourth wireless service provider and started selling
discounted phone packages in January, Bouygues also told the
newspaper.  If nothing is done to restore balance, the French State,
which owns 27 percent of  France Telecom , should consider
splitting the company’s retail business from its networks so
that all carriers can share the infrastructure and limit their
investments, Figaro cited Bouygues as saying.  Iliad spokeswoman Isabelle Audap didn’t immediately respond
to a request for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
