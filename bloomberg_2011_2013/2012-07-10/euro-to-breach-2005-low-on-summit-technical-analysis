The euro will fall below an almost
seven-year low after breaching a level of so-called technical
support this week on investor concern European leaders will fail
to tackle the debt crisis, High Frequency Economics predicted.  The company expects the 17-nation currency to weaken past
$1.1967 this week. From there it will reach its 2005 “nadir,”
 Carl Weinberg , chief economist in Valhalla,  New York , wrote in a
note to clients yesterday. The euro touched $1.1640 on Nov. 15,
2005, according to Bloomberg data, 5.4 percent below its current
level.  European Union leaders agreed at a summit last month to use
the region’s bailout funds to recapitalize  Spain ’s ailing
lenders and to set up a banking supervisory body.  “The euro-phoria that emerged after the June 28 summit has
been replaced by gloom,” Weinberg wrote in the note.
“Investors have lost confidence in the capacity of the
political process to generate executable and appropriate
solutions to the banking and financial crises.”  The euro was little changed at $1.2295 at 8:21 a.m. London
time today.  European finance ministers are gathering in Brussels for
the second day of discussions on crisis-fighting measures
adopted by heads of government at last month’s summit.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. A support level is an area on a
price graph where economists anticipate orders to buy a
security.  To contact the reporter on this story:
