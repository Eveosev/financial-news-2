Poland’s  WIG20 Index (WIG20)  climbed 0.2
percent to 2,247.02 in Warsaw.  The following were among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Bomi SA (BMI)  , a Polish grocery-store chain, slumped 26
percent to 0.32 zloty, a record low, after Bank Pekao SA and BRE
Bank SA stopped lending to the company. The loan freeze “poses
risk to the company’s continuing current operations,” Bomi said
in a statement today.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , Poland’s only copper miner,
slid 1.2 percent to 146.3 zloty as the metal declined after
imports into China slumped to the lowest since August, adding to
concern that demand is slowing in the world’s largest metals
consumer.  Polimex-Mostostal SA (PXM)  , the country’s second-largest
construction company, rose 1.2 percent to 0.83 zloty, climbing
to the highest level in more than two weeks after saying it’s in
talks with the Polish state fund and a bank over obtaining aid.  Polskie Gornictwo Naftowe i Gazownictwo SA  (PGN PW), the
nation’s largest natural gas distributor, lost 0.7 percent to
4.06 zloty, falling to a one-week low as the country’s antitrust
regulator imposed a 60 million-zloty ($17.6 million) fine.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
