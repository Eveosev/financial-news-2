Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) , the
world’s biggest luxury-car maker, intends to continue hybrid-
vehicle research on its own as it holds talks with  PSA Peugeot
Citroen (UG)  about breaking up a joint venture.  Operations of the BMW Peugeot Citroen Electrification
partnership, established in October to develop, purchase and
produce electric powertrains and components, will be retained by
BMW, Micaela Sandstede, a spokeswoman for the Munich-based
carmaker, said by telephone.  “Whether that means the joint venture’s employees move to
BMW is undecided,” Sandstede said. “We are still in
discussions with PSA over the dismantling of the joint
venture.”  BPCE comprises a research and development center in Munich
and a manufacturing plant in Mulhouse,  France , where 250 workers
would be employed to electrify about 10,000 vehicles starting in
2015. BMW and Paris-based Peugeot said on June 21 that they were
looking at the venture’s future after  General Motors Co. (GM)  bought
a stake in the French carmaker.  The German manufacturer signed a memorandum of
understanding on June 29 with  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the maker of
the Prius hybrid car, to collaborate on the development of fuel
cells, lightweight materials and electric powertrains.  BMW will buy Peugeot’s 50 percent stake in BPCE, France’s
La Tribune newspaper reported today.  Pierre-Olivier Salmon, a Peugeot spokesman, declined to
comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
