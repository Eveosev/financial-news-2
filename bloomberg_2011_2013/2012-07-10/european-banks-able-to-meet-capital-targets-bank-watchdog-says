European banks  reached a target of
raising 114.7 billion euros ($141 billion) in fresh capital by
the end of June, according to a European Union document.  The “capital shortfall” has “been largely raised from
private sources and where necessary public backstops were
activated,” according to a memorandum prepared for EU finance
ministers for a Brussels meeting today that was obtained by
Bloomberg News.  The  European Banking Authority  told lenders to meet a core
Tier-1 capital ratio of 9 percent by the end of June, and hold
additional reserves, called a sovereign buffer, against the debt
of weaker euro-area countries, based upon the market price of
the bonds. The measures were part of a response to the sharp
fall in the value of securities issued by euro-area governments.  “The EBA exercise was a necessary step on the road to
repair banks’ balance sheets and strengthen their capital
base,” the document said. “The recommendation will remain in
force until the normalization of risks.”  A preliminary report will be released tomorrow, according
to the document, with more detailed results to be published in
September.  Franca Rosa Congiu, a spokeswoman for the EBA in  London ,
didn’t immediately return a telephone voice-mail message seeking
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
