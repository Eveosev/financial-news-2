HRT Participacoes em Petroleo SA ,
the  oil company  exploring  Brazil ’s Amazon and offshore Namibia,
fell the most in about two weeks after failing to find
commercial volumes of crude and natural gas at its most recent
well.  HRT, as the Rio de Janeiro-based company is known, fell 1.8
percent to 6.14 reais, the most since June 27. The stock has
fallen 46 percent this year, more than the 5.4 percent drop in
Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa index.  HRT abandoned a well in the Solimoes basin after a
reservoir had less natural gas than expected, HRT said in a
statement today. HRT has found commercial volumes of natural gas
in Solimoes to date, which is more expensive to transport and
sells for a lower price than oil.  “Investors are worried the company will continue to spend
capital on uneconomic prospects,” Matthew Portillo, an analyst
at Tudor Pickering Hold & Co., said in a telephone interview
from Houston.  To contact the reporter on this story:
