Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ’s German
client’s homes were searched by tax agents probing the possible
use of so-called “ Bermuda  products” involving several billion
euros to hide funds from the tax authorities,  Handelsblatt 
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Some 7,000 customers, mainly German, that used accounts in
Bermuda disguised as tax-free insurance products are affected,
the newspaper said, citing unidentified banking officials. The
investments averaged about 500,000 euros with individual cases
of 12 million euros and more, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
