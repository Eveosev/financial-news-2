Portugal ’s central bank said the
 economy  will contract less than previously forecast in 2012 as
exports grow faster.  Gross domestic product will fall 3 percent this year after
declining 1.6 percent in 2011, the Bank of Portugal said today
in its summer economic bulletin. In March, the bank forecast GDP
would decrease 3.4 percent in 2012 and also predicted no growth
for 2013.  Exports will grow 3.5 percent in 2012 and 5.2 percent in
2013, more than estimated in March.  Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  is facing a recession
and rising unemployment as he cuts spending and raises taxes to
meet the terms of a 78 billion-euro ($96 billion) aid plan from
the European Union and the  International Monetary Fund . As the
country’s borrowing costs surged, Portugal last year followed
Greece and Ireland in seeking a bailout and now aims to return
to bond markets in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
