Hungary  will probably need to have
its 2013 budget approved by the  International Monetary Fund  and
the European Union in order to qualify for a loan, HVG.hu
 reported , citing a European Commission document.  The EU executive, which considers the draft budget to be
based on overly optimistic forecasts, may ask that Parliament
delay approving the plan until after consultations with the
lenders, the weekly newspaper’s website reported today. Prime
Minister  Viktor Orban  wants the budget framework approved on
July 12, before the summer recess, HVG.hu said.  The EU may ask Hungary to strengthen the Fiscal Council,
reduce the tax burden on low-income workers, increase energy
levies, introduce a real estate tax and cap an extraordinary
bank tax while phasing out other industry levies, HVG.hu said.  Several hundred billion forint of tax cuts may not be
covered in next year’s budget, HVG.hu said, citing commission
concerns. One hundred billion forint is $428 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
