Canadian  housing starts  rose in
June, an unexpected gain led by work on multiple-unit projects
in British Columbia and  Quebec , government figures showed.  Construction of new homes rose 2.4 percent to a 222,700
seasonally adjusted annual pace, Ottawa-based Canada Mortgage &
Housing Corp. said today, exceeding all 21 responses in a
Bloomberg News survey that had a median  forecast  of 205,000. The
agency also boosted its May estimate to 217,400 from an initial
reading of 211,400.  Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  tightened mortgage
regulations for a fourth time last month on concerns that some
families were taking on debts that will become unaffordable when
 borrowing costs  increase. The pace of housing starts has almost
doubled from the low of 111,800 units in 2009 during the last
recession, and starts in the April-June period were the
strongest since the third quarter of 2007.  “Homebuilding is showing no signs of cooling off yet,”
said Emanuella Enenajor, an economist at Canadian Imperial Bank
of Commerce in Toronto, in a note to clients.  Canada’s dollar was little changed at C$1.0189 per  U.S.
dollar  at 8:49 a.m. in Toronto, after gaining as much as 0.2
percent. One Canadian dollar buys 98.15 U.S. cents.  Multiple-unit starts  in urban areas rose 4.1 percent to
132,000 units. Single-family starts fell 0.3 percent to a pace
of 67,500 units.  To contact the reporter on this story:
