Chelsea captain  John Terry  started
testifying to counter charges he racially abused an opposing
player after a judge rejected his lawyer’s motion to dismiss the
case.  Terry, 31, told the court in  London  that he was “very
angry and I was upset as well” when he heard the other player,
 Anton Ferdinand , accuse him of making the racial slur. Terry
said he repeated the words “black c---” because that’s what he
thought Ferdinand accused him of saying during the game.  The case came to court after an off-duty policeman who
watched video replays of an Oct. 23 match suggested Terry used a
racial slur to abuse Queens Park Rangers player Ferdinand.
Ferdinand testified yesterday that he saw video footage showing
Terry calling him a “black c---.”  Terry was dropped as captain of  England ’s national soccer
team ahead of the European Championship after Chief Magistrate
Howard Riddle delayed the trial. Terry faces a maximum fine of
2,500 pounds ($3,875) and may face further sanctions from
English soccer’s governing body.  Before Terry took the witness stand, his lawyer, George
Carter-Stephenson, asked the judge to dismiss the case, saying
prosecutors’ arguments were “weak and tenuous.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
