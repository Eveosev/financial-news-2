auction on the European Energy Exchange AG, according to the
bourse’s website.  The country is selling as many as 21 million tons of spot
and 32 million tons of December futures contracts in weekly

2008 to the end of this year.  EEX has also auctioned Phase 2 permits on behalf of the
Netherlands and  Lithuania , and is selling Phase 3 allowances for
delivery in 2013 for the  European Investment Bank .  To contact the reporter on this story:
