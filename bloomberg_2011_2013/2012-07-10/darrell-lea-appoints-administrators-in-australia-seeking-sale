Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty, an
85-year-old Australian confectionery retailer, appointed
administrators to prepare the company for a sale.  The appointment of administrators in  Australia  is similar
to a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in the U.S., designed to
protect a company from lawsuits as it reorganizes and keeps
operating.  “We are undertaking an urgent review of the business with
a view to preparing Darrell Lea for sale,”  Mark Robinson  from
PPB Advisory LLC, one of the administrators, said in a statement
today. “The owners of the business have agreed to provide some
short-term financial support whilst we undertake this process.”  Darrell Lea,  based in Sydney, sells its products through 69
owned and licensed stores and about 1,800 retail outlets across
Australia,  New Zealand  and the U.S., according to the statement
from PPB Advisory. The company employs about 700 people.  Details on the value of the company’s assets and
liabilities won’t be released, Ben Jarvis of Six Degrees Media,
an outside spokesman for PPB Advisory, said today in a phone
interview.  PPB Advisory was appointed following a review of the
business by Darrell Lea’s directors and concerns about the
company’s ability to meet financial obligations, the
administrators said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
