A fourth cargo of Russian Urals
crude was dropped from the July loading program, according to
three people with knowledge of the shipping schedule.  The 80,000 metric-ton consignment was originally planned
for July 13 to July 14 shipment from Novorossiysk on the  Black
Sea , said the people, who declined to be identified because the
information is confidential.  All four of the canceled cargoes were owned by TNK-BP, the
Russian oil producer half-owned by  BP Plc (BP/) , according to a
shipping plan. Loading programs are schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  Details of the cancellations were as follows. The volume is
in tons.  To contact the reporters on this story:
