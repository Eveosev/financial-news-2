Hans Kristian Rausing, the son of
Swedish billionaire and former Tetra Pak chairman Hans Rausing,
was arrested after police found the body of his wife Eva at
their London home, the  Daily Mail  newspaper reported.  A police spokesman confirmed that a 49-year-old man was
arrested yesterday on suspicion of possessing drugs, and that
officers searching his Chelsea home found a body. The spokesman
wouldn’t identify the man or the deceased. The death is being
treated as unexplained and the man is being held at a South
London police station, he said.  Jorgen Haglind, a spokesman for Tetra Pak’s parent company,
said the Rausings divested their interests in the business in
1995.  “As this tragic event has no connection to Tetra Pak it
would be fully inappropriate for us to comment,” Haglind said
in an e-mailed statement.  Efforts to reach the elder Rausing were unsuccessful.  To contact the reporter on this story:
