The naira weakened, snapping three
days of gains against the dollar as crude, Nigeria’s key export,
retreated in New York and London.  The currency of Africa’s biggest oil producer depreciated
0.1 percent to 160.84 per dollar as of 2:57 p.m. on the
 interbank market  in Lagos, the commercial capital, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The naira has gained 0.9 percent
against the dollar this year and 1.1 percent last week.  Oil fell after Norway ended a strike that threatened to
halt output by western Europe’s largest crude exporter and as
China reduced purchases of the raw material. The naira hit a
one-month high yesterday after the  Central Bank of Nigeria  sold
foreign currency at its first of two regular weekly auctions. It
isn’t scheduled to sell dollars today.  “Recent naira weakness reflects the fall in global  oil
prices ,”  Ecobank Transnational Inc. (ETI)  strategists, led by Paris-
based Paul-Harry Aithnard, wrote in a note to clients today.
Last week’s “appreciation was due to month-end sales from  oil
companies  and increased foreign exchange supply from the CBN.”  Nigeria’s  foreign currency reserves  have fallen $1.1
billion since the end of May to $36.5 billion, according to July
6 data compiled by the Abuja-based central bank. Nigerian
benchmark  Bonny Light crude  has declined 3.9 percent since the
end of May.  The yield on Nigeria’s domestic 15.1 percent bonds due 2017
fell eight basis points to 15.94 percent, according to July 9
data on the Financial Markets Dealers Association website.
Yields on the nation’s $500 million of Eurobonds due 2021 rose
one basis point to 5.5 percent today.  Ghana’s cedi rose 0.1 percent to 1.951 per dollar in Accra,
the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
