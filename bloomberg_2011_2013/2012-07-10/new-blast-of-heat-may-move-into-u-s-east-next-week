A quick blast of heat may return to
Chicago,  Washington  and  New York City  next week, pushing
temperatures into the 80s and 90s and sending people to their
air conditioners for relief.  The mid-Atlantic and Northeast may have temperatures 5 to 7
degrees Fahrenheit (2.8 to 3.9 Celsius) above normal from July
15 to July 19, according to  MDA EarthSat Weather  in
Gaithersburg, Maryland. It may be hotter in the western Great
Lakes and Chicago.  “The forecast has shifted hotter today to include
widespread mid-90s across the Midwest and mid-Atlantic, and
upper 80s or greater in the Northeast,” MDA said. “At this
point, the next round of heat doesn’t appear as strong as the
last, but there may still be some upside from the current
forecast.”  Natural gas futures climbed 3.9 percent yesterday, the
biggest increase since June 18, on the possibility of higher
temperatures in the U.S. large cities. Heat increases
electricity demand, and that can boost prices on the spot energy
markets. Gas makes up about 32 percent of U.S. electricity
generation.  Forecasters are split on what sort of conditions may
prevail later in July.  MDA predicts temperatures in the Midwest and Northeast will
stay about 4 degrees above normal from July 20 to July 24.
Commodity Weather Group LLC President  Matt Rogers  forecast that
the eastern U.S. will be primarily seasonal during the period,
while Chicago and the Great Plains may be about 5 degrees above
normal.  For July 10, the normal average temperature in  New York 
City is 77, according to MDA. It’s 73 in Boston; 80 in
Washington; 80 in Atlanta; 75 in Chicago; 84 in Houston; 65 in
 Seattle  and 74 in  Burbank , California.  To contact the reporter on this story:
