Russia is considering Fabio Capello,
Pep Guardiola and  Harry Redknapp  among possible successors to
Dick Advocaat, who quit as national soccer coach after Euro
2012.  The Russian Football Unionâ€™s  website  listed 13 foreign and
domestic candidates with whom it said talks will be held.  They include former England coach Capello and Guardiola,
who quit Barcelona in April. Ex-Tottenham manager Redknapp and
Marcello Lippi, who coached Italy, are also named along with ex-
Liverpool Rafael Benitez and Marcelo Bielsa of Athletic Bilbao.
He previously led Argentina and Chile.  Russia failed to reach the quarterfinals at Euro 2012 and
won only one game, against the  Czech Republic .  To contact the reporter on this story:
