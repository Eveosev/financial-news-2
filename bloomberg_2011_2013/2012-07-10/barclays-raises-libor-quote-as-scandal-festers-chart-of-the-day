Barclays Plc (BARC) ’s estimates of its
borrowing costs show the lender reacting to the scandal around
the London interbank offered rate.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows that the spread between
Barclays’s Libor submission and the composite rate narrowed
yesterday the most since May 2009, adding to the gains it’s
turned in since June 6. The bank has the second-lowest
contributions after HSBC Holdings Plc.  The increase mirrors the situation in 2009 when Barclays’s
quotes plunged toward the composite after a call between former
Chief Executive Officer  Bob Diamond  and the Bank of England’s
 Paul Tucker , now the central bank’s deputy governor. Tucker
yesterday rejected lawmakers’ suggestion that he had pressured
the London-based lender to “join the pack.”  “It’s interesting that the Barclays Libor submission is so
low,” said Steve Hussey, a London-based financial institutions
analyst at AllianceBernstein Ltd., which oversees about $400
billion. “The recent jump is a little odd.”  Diamond will forgo any deferred bonus he might be entitled
to after his July 4 resignation, valued at as much as 20 million
pounds ($31 million), Barclays Chairman Marcus Agius told the
House of Commons Treasury Select Committee today. That follows
the 290 million-pound fine imposed on Barclays and the opening
of a criminal probe by the U.K. Serious Fraud Office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
