Aamal Co’s (AHCS)  City Center mall in Qatar
reopened after being shut on June 15, the mall’s management said
in a text message sent late yesterday.  The mall was shut after a May 28 fire in another Qatari
mall called Villaggio which killed 19 people, including 13
children in a play area. City Center and Villaggio are the two
largest malls in the country. Villaggio remains closed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
