Mako Surgical Corp. (MAKO)  plunged 43
percent after cutting its sales forecast for the RIO robotic arm
system for the second time in two months.  Mako dropped $10.60 to close at $14.01 in New York, its
biggest one-day decline since the shares began trading in
February 2008. The stock has fallen 57 percent this year.  Based on results from the first six months, 42 to 48 of the
systems may be sold this year, the  Fort Lauderdale , Florida-
based company said in a statement yesterday. On May 7, Mako
trimmed the forecast to 52 to 58 systems from as much as 62.  “I think it’s an issue of management credibility and of
growth,” said Michael Matson, a New York-based analyst with
Mizuho Securities USA, in a telephone interview. “The growth is
not as strong as people had thought.”  Matson reduced his rating on Mako to neutral after the
company missed forecasts for the first quarter. He has a price
target of $15 on the stock.  The RIO robotic arm system is a tool that helps surgeons to
plan and execute surgical implants. It includes software that
maps out surgeries and a tracking system that allows the surgeon
to make adjustments during surgeries. The system’s goal is to
make technically difficult procedures possible through better
visualization.  Mako said yesterday that 15 RIO systems were sold worldwide
in this year through the end of June.  “I think demand is just not at the level that people
thought,” Matson said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
