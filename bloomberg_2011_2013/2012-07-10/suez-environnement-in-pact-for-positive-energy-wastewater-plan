Suez Environnement,  Europe ’s second-
largest water utility, signed an agreement with the Danish
Hydraulic Institute and Nanyang Technological University in
 Singapore  to help make wastewater treatment plants “positive
energy” facilities that produce more energy than they consume.  The 3-year research program under the auspices of the Public
Utility Board of Singapore hopes to test a wastewater treatment
line that links systems based on activated sludge with increased
biogas production via anaerobic digestion, the Paris-based
utility said today in a statement.  The project, combining lower energy consumption in the
water line and higher energy production in the sludge line, will
be based on semi-industrial scale pilot tests at the Kranji
water reclamation plant that belongs to PUB, Suez said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
