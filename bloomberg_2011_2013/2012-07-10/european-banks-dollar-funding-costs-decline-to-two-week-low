The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars dropped to a two-week low, according to a
money-markets indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 55 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 8:30 a.m. in
London from minus 59 yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The cost has declined from a three-month high of 69
basis points on July 5.  The one-year basis swap was little changed at 56 basis
points, or 0.56 percentage point, below Euribor. Euribor is the
rate  banks  say they see each other lending in euros and is
derived from a survey by the European Banking Federation.  The Euribor/OIS spread was little changed at 40 basis
points, the lowest since June 14.  The Eonia OIS swap, an estimate of average overnight
borrowing costs in euros over the next three months, was little
changed at 13 basis points.  Lenders cut  overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-based ECB
yesterday, placing 791 billion euros ($972 billion) from 795
billion euros on July 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
