BP Plc (BP/)  said it will cancel a
contract with a company following allegations of fraud related
to a project in  Azerbaijan .  “A contractor told BP that it violated BP’s rules of
behavior in the past,” Tamam Bayatli, a BP spokeswoman in the
Azeri capital of Baku, said by telephone today. “We are now in
the process of terminating our contract with that contractor
company.”  She gave no details of the contractor or the project
involved in the case.  The Telegraph reported at the weekend that BP is part of a
U.K. Serious Fraud Office investigation over bribery allegations
filed against one of its engineering contractors in Azerbaijan.  The unnamed contractor reported the allegations itself to
the SFO last year, while there are no suggestions that BP
employees paid bribes, the newspaper said.  David Jones , a spokesman for the SFO, declined to comment.  BP is leading oil and gas projects in Azerbaijan, including
the Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli, or ACG, and Shah Deniz developments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
