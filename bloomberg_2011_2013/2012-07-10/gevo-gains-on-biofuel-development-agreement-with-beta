Gevo Inc. (GEVO) , the U.S. biotechnology
company backed by the French oil company  Total SA (FP)  and the
specialty chemicals maker Lanxess AG, rose the most in two weeks
after announcing an agreement to develop biofuels with Beta
Renewables.  Gevo advanced 4.6 percent to $4.37 at the close in New
York, the most since June 26.  The companies plan to produce isobutanol from cellulosic,
non-food biomass including switchgrass, miscanthus and
agricultural residues, according to a statement today from
Englewood, Colorado-based Gevo.  Beta Renewables is a joint venture of the the private
equity company TPG Capital and the Chemtex unit of the Italian
chemical company Gruppo Mossi & Ghisolfi.  Gevo makes isobutanol from corn and non-food crops.
Isobutanol may be blended with gasoline or refined into jet
fuel, specialty chemicals or other products that are typically
derived from petroleum.  To contact the reporter on this story:
