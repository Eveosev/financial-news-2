Mexico ’s peso rose to a two-month
high after European officials moved to shore up  Spain ’s banks,
easing concern the debt crisis will further slow global growth.  The peso appreciated 0.4 percent to 13.3003 per dollar at
9:21 a.m. in Mexico City. It touched 13.2404 in intraday
trading, the strongest level since May 8.  The currency rallied as European finance ministers agreed
to make 30 billion euros ($37 billion) in emergency loans
available to Spanish banks by the end of the month. The peso is
gaining on speculation that European officials will put in place
“effective firewalls” for bank bailouts, according to  Ramon
Cordova , a currency trader at Banco Base SA.  While the loans to Spain will go via the government’s bank-
restructuring agency, the aim is to convert them into direct
European cash injections once the setup of a single European
bank supervisor makes that approach feasible, Luxembourg Prime
Minister Jean-Claude Juncker said after chairing a meeting of
euro-region finance ministers.  “One of these firewalls is that bank bailouts won’t be
carried out by the government,” Cordova said by phone from San
Pedro Garza Garcia, Mexico. “This is the reason we’re seeing
some positive sentiment.”  The yield on Mexican local-currency bonds due in 2024 fell
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 5.34 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price rose 0.18
centavo to 142.34 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
