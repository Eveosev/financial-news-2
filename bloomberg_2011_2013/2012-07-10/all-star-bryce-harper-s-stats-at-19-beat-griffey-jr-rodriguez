Bryce Harper, the youngest non-
pitching All-Star in Major League Baseball history, has hitting
statistics that so far exceed Ken Griffey Jr. and  Alex Rodriguez , two potential Hall of Famers who also entered the big
leagues before they turned 20.  Harper, the Washington Nationals’ 19-year-old outfielder,
replaced injured Giancarlo Stanton of the  Miami Marlins  on the
National League roster for tonight’s game in Kansas City. He
enters the All-Star break with a .282 batting average, eight
home runs and a .354 on-base percentage in 248 at-bats.  Harper, who turns 20 on Oct. 16, was told he was an All-
Star by Nationals manager  Davey Johnson  and General Manager Mike
Rizzo on July 7. Though  Dwight Gooden  and Bob Feller were
younger All-Stars, he’ll surpass Minnesota Twins catcher Butch
Wynegar as the youngest non-pitcher.  “When Davey called me over, I was thinking I was either
going down (to the minor leagues), because Rizzo and everybody
was over there, or the All-Star Game,” Harper told reporters.
“Good thing it was the All-Star Game.”  Harper’s slugging percentage -- total bases divided by at-
bats -- is .472, higher than that of Griffey, Rodriguez,  Adrian Beltre  and Edgar Renteria for their complete rookie seasons as
19-year-old major leaguers, according to  Bloomberg Sports  data.  Griffey, who reached the majors in 1989 with the  Seattle
Mariners , had a .264 batting average and a .420 slugging
percentage with 16 homers in 455 at-bats. The 13-time All-Star
averaged a home run every 28.4 at-bats as a rookie, slightly
better than Harper’s 30.5. Griffey became an All-Star at the age
of 20 and retired in 2010. His 630 home runs are sixth most in
major league history.  A-Rod Numbers  The  New York Yankees ’ Rodriguez, whose 642 home runs are
fifth on the major league career list, is a 14-time All-Star who
first saw big-league action as an 18-year-old with the Mariners
in 1994. At 19 he had 142 at-bats, posting a .232 batting
average with five home runs, a .264 on-base percentage and a
slugging percentage of .408.  Beltre, the  Texas Rangers ’ third baseman who will start for
the American League tonight, entered the majors in 1998 as a 19-
year-old with the  Los Angeles Dodgers . He hit .215 that season
with seven homers, an on-base percentage of .278 and a slugging
percentage of .369. Beltre didn’t become an All-Star until 2010.  All-Star Renteria  Renteria, a five-time All-Star who retired in 2011, joined
the  Florida Marlins  as a 19-year-old in 1996. He had 431 at-bats
that year, hitting .309 with five homers, a .358 on-base
percentage and a .399 slugging percentage. Renteria was named to
his first All-Star Game at age 21.  “I’m excited to be out there with those kinds of guys,”
said Harper, baseball’s No. 1 draft pick in 2010 who was called
up from Triple-A Syracuse in April and helped lead the Nationals
to an NL-best 49-34 record at the break. “I’m going to take it
all in and try to enjoy it with my family and just be as mellow
and calm as I can.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
