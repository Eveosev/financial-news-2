U.K. Immigration Minister Damian
Green, speaking to reassure foreign visitors coming to London
for the  Olympic Games  that they will not have to queue for long
periods at passport control at  Heathrow airport , said 500 extra
staff are on standby.  “In a matter of days there will be more than 500 extra
staff at Heathrow,” Green told lawmakers in Parliament in
London today. From July 15 every passport control desk will be
staffed during busy periods, he said.  The U.K. expects “more than 100,000 transactions a day”
at passport control during the games, Green said. “Every desk
at Heathrow will be staffed at busy periods,” and staff “leave
will be canceled” he said.  Green was responding to criticism of immigration staff
working at London’s Heathrow, run by BAA Airports Ltd, for long
queues.  To contact the reporter on this story:
