Est Media Vagyonkezelo Nyrt. (ESTMEDIA) , a
Hungarian entertainment company, rose the most in three weeks as
a technical indicator signaled its decline was overdone.  The shares increased 10 percent to 23 forint by 9:36 a.m.
in Budapest, the biggest gain in the 11-member benchmark BUX
index. The stockâ€™s 13 percent plunge to a record low yesterday
pushed its 14-day relative strength index to 17. RSI levels
below 30 indicate to some analysts that a security is oversold.
The RSI last traded at 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
