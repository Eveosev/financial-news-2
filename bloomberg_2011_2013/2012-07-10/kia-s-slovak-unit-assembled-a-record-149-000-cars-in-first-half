The Slovak unit of  Kia Motors Corp. (000270) 
assembled a record 149,000 cars in the first half of the year,
boosted by rising demand for sport-utility vehicles produced by
the South Korean carmaker.  Production of cars rose 11 percent from 134,000 units
shipped in the same period last year, Dusan Dvorak, the
spokesman for the Slovak factory, said in an e-mailed statement
today from Zilina, Slovakia. The company also produced 237,000
engines, representing a 22 percent increase from the first half
of 2011.  Demand for SUVs help Kia and its affiliate Hyundai Motors
Co. weather the economic slowdown in western  Europe , where sales
of all new cars dropped 8.4 percent in May from the previous
year. Kia’s total European sales rose 29.8 percent from a year
earlier in May.  Kia-brand Sportage SUVs accounted for almost half of cars
produced in the east European country. The carmaker, which also
makes the Venga subcompact and cee’d compact models in Zilina,
said it maintained its forecast to produce 285,000 vehicles at
the plant this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
