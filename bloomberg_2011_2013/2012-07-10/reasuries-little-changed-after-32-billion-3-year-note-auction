Treasuries were little changed after
the U.S. sale of $32 billion of three-year notes.  The securities, which mature in July 2015, drew a  yield  of
0.366 percent, compared with the average forecast of 0.367 in a
Bloomberg News survey of seven of the  Federal Reserve ’s 21
primary dealers. The  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges demand by
comparing total bids with the amount of securities offered, was
3.52, compared with an average of 3.45 for the past 10 sales.  “From a value perspective, I don’t see any reason to buy
the front end of the curve,” Larry Dyer, a U.S. interest-rate
strategist in New York with HSBC Holdings Plc, a primary dealer
obligated to bid in U.S. debt auctions, said in a telephone
interview before the auction. “It’s just not giving much of a
premium over ultra-safe, short-term assets.”  The yield on the current three-year note rose one basis
points, or 0.01 percentage point, to 0.36 percent, at 1:06 p.m.
in  New York , according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The
yield on the benchmark 10-year note was little changed at 1.52
percent.  Indirect bidders , an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 30 percent of the notes, compared with
an average of 35.5 percent for the past 10 sales.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 10.2 percent of
the notes at the sale, compared with an average of 9.9 percent
for the past 10 auctions.  Week’s Auctions  The Treasury is selling $66 billion in notes and bonds this
week. The government will sell $21 billion in 10-year debt
tomorrow and $13 billion in 30-year securities on July 12.  Three-year notes have returned 0.3 percent this year,
compared with a 2.5 percent gain for Treasuries overall,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The three-
year securities returned 3.4 percent in 2011, while Treasuries
overall gained 9.8 percent.  Ten-year note yields pared gains today after  Bank of
England  Governor  Mervyn King  said the U.K. economy doesn’t show
“great signs” of recovering from recession. Yields rose
earlier as European officials took actions to speed up loans for
Spanish banks.  Spanish bond yields fell below 7 percent after euro-region
finance chiefs meeting in Brussels agreed to  make available  30
billion euros ($37 billion) by the end of this month to shore up
 Spain ’s banks. The aim is to eventually use the region’s bailout
money to recapitalize banks directly instead of weighing the
government with the debts.  European governments will provide as much as 100 billion
euros in emergency loans to Spain’s banks and may move the costs
off the balance sheet of the government in  Madrid  to shield the
euro region’s fourth-largest economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
