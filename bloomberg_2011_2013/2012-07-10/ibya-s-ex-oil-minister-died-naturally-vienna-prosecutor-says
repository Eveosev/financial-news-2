Libya ’s former top oil official,
 Shokri Ghanem , whose body was found in the Danube River in
April, probably died from a heart attack, according to final
autopsy results, the Vienna prosecutors’ office said today.  While Ghanem probably wasn’t dead when he fell into the
river, he still died from heart failure and not from drowning,
Thomas Vecsey, the prosecutors’ spokesman, said by telephone.
The autopsy produced no signs for unnatural causes of death, he
added. No harmful substances other than “normal levels” of
nicotine and caffeine were found in Ghanem’s blood.  Austrian police are still investigating the circumstances
of Ghanem’s death on April 29, Vecsey added. That’s why the file
isn’t closed yet for the Austrian authorities, he said.  Ghanem, 69, was previously chairman of Libya’s state-run
National Oil Corp., a role equivalent to oil minister in other
OPEC nations. An uprising against former Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  broke out in February 2011, and Ghanem left the
government about four months later, the rebel National
Transitional Council said last June in a statement. He didn’t
join the post-Qaddafi administration, and the rebel council
picked Nuri Berruien to head the NOC in September.  Libya has the largest oil reserves in  Africa  and has been a
member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
since 1962.  To contact the reporter on this story:
