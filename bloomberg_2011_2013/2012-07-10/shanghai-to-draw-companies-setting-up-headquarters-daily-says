Shanghai  will encourage
multinational companies to set up their regional headquarters in
the city as it seeks to draw foreign investment, the Shanghai
Daily reported, citing Vice Mayor Ai Baojun.  The city will provide benefits for newly established
headquarters and international firms that upgrade their China
bases into regional ones, the newspaper  cited  Ai as saying,
without providing further details. The city plans to introduce
the rule “soon,” making it more convenient and cheaper for
these companies to set up their headquarters.  In the first half of the year, contracted foreign direct
investment in the city climbed 15.8 percent from a year earlier
to $11.2 billion, according to the newspaper.  As of end-June, 380 multinational companies have set up
regional headquarters in Shanghai, including Kubota China
Holdings Co., while another 348 have started research and
development centers in the city, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
