Boeing Co. (BA)  racked up deals with
leasing companies for a second consecutive day, as a  General
Electric Co. (GE)  unit and  Kuwait ’s Alafco agreed to buy 120 of the
planemaker’s top-selling 737 single-aisle model.  GE Capital Aviation Services committed to take 75 of the
upgraded Max version and 25 of the current model of the top-
selling 737, Boeing said today in a statement at the Farnborough
air show outside  London . Alafco will acquire 20 planes, all the
737 Max version, Boeing said in a separate statement.  Gecas’s transaction would have a list value of $9.25
billion, based on Chicago-based Boeing’s retail prices for the
737 Max 8 and the 737-800 planes in the agreement, while the
Alafco deal would be valued at $1.9 billion. Airlines typically
buy at a discount.  Boeing opened the Farnborough show, the year’s highest-
profile trade event for the  aerospace industry , with an order
yesterday for 75 737s from Steven Udvar-Hazy’s  Air Lease Corp. (AL) 
That sale included 60 Max planes in the first such deal with a
lessor.  Both of today’s accords are still being completed, and will
be logged in Boeing’s official order tally once they’re final,
according to the planemaker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
