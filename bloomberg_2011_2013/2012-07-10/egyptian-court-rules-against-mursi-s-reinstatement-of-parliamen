Egypt ’s constitutional court ruled
to halt President Mohamed Mursi’s July 8 decree that reinstated
parliament.  The court’s chief judge, Maher El-Behery, issued the ruling
today in Cairo. The court had ruled in June that the law
governing the parliamentary election was unconstitutional,
prompting the ruling military council at that time to dissolve
the legislature.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
