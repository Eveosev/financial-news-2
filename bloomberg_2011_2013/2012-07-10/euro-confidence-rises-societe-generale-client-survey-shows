Societe Generale SA said a customer
survey found that foreign-exchange research clients have more
confidence in the resilience of the euro area than a year ago.  A survey of 6,700 people showed 99 percent expected the 17-
nation currency bloc would exist in its current form in two
years. That compares with 95 percent of 6,600 respondents in a
May survey, the Paris-based bank said in a report today.  Asian clients were the most willing to buy the euro, with
the median value seen as attractive to buy the currency at
$1.18. U.S. clients would be willing to purchase at $1.05 and
Europeans at $1.12, the survey showed.  Globally corporate clients said they would become buyers of
euro at $1.17 compared with “bank” and “real money clients”
at $1.15.  Hedge funds  would become buyers at $1.05, the survey
showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
