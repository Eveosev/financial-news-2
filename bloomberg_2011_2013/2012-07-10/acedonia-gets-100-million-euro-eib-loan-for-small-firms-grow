The Former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia got 100 million euros ($122.8 million) in loans from
the  European Investment Bank  to bolster private businesses and
create jobs.  The funds will be transferred to the Macedonian Bank for
Development and onto local banks at “lower rates” as financial
support for small and medium enterprises in the energy,
environment protection and services sector, the European Union’s
lending arm said in an e-mail today.  The loans will help “reduce unemployment levels and
improve the quality of life of the country’s citizens,” the
lender said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
