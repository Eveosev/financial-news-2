PDG Realty SA Empreendimentos e
Participacoes (PDGR3) ,  Brazil ’s largest homebuilder by revenue, led
declines among the nation’s real estate companies after posting
an 80 percent drop in new projects and revising its target.  PDG fell 4.1 percent to 3.24 reais at 11 a.m. in Sao Paulo.
It was the  worst performance  among members of the Bovespa Real
Estate index, which fell 0.3 percent.  The company said new projects fell to 404 million reais
($199.1 million) in the second quarter from 2.05 billion a year
earlier, according to a regulatory filing today. Contracted
sales fell 32 percent to 1.24 billion reais in the period. PDG
also cut its new-project target for 2012 to a range of 4 billion
reais to 5 billion reais, from 8 billion reais to 9 billion
reais.  New projects reached 34 percent of the new target for 2012
at the end of the first half, PDG said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
