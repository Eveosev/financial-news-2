Syria ’s main opposition group said a
delegation headed by its leader, Abdulbaset Sieda, will travel
to Russia tomorrow for talks on the Syrian crisis.  The Syrian National Council said it remains committed to
its basic principles, which include bringing down President
Bashar al-Assad’s government before starting to prepare for a
transition. Russia, along with China, stands by Assad and says
he should be involved in the transition.  “Our commitment to the revolution and the will of the
people has no limits,” the Syrian National Council said in a
statement on its Facebook page.  RIA Novosti reported on July 2 that Russia invited Sieda
for talks in Moscow and that he may meet Russian Foreign
Minister  Sergei Lavrov .  The Syrian uprising that began peacefully 16 months ago has
evolved into a deadly confrontation that has left the
international community at odds over how to persuade Assad,
whose family has held power for four decades, to leave.  The violence has claimed more than 17,000 lives since the
conflict began in March 2011, according to Rami  Abdel Rahman ,
head of the Syrian Observatory for  Human Rights . He said the
casualties include 4,348 members of Assad’s security forces.  About 4,000 Syrians have been killed since United Nations
special envoy  Kofi Annan  took on the peacemaking mission in
February, according to the Local Coordination Committees, an
activist group. At least 19 were killed today, the LCC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
