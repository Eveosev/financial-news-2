President  James Bullard  said the U.S. central bank would
consider more stimulus if the economy slows significantly.  “If things slow down a lot more and the  U.S. economy 
looked like it was going back into recession or there were risks
of deflation then we would consider more action,” Bullard told
reporters in London today. “But I don’t think we’re at that
juncture.”  Bullard added that inflation rates in the U.S. are “around
target” and the situation isn’t similar to that of 2010.  “I don’t think we can look at any more extension of
operation twist beyond the end of this year,” Bullard added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
