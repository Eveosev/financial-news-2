Oil rebounded from the lowest close
in more than a week in  New York  on speculation declines may have
been excessive amid shrinking stockpiles in the U.S., the
world’s biggest crude consumer.  Futures climbed as much as 1 percent after slipping 2.4
percent yesterday. U.S. inventories fell 695,000 barrels last
week, the  American Petroleum Institute  said after the
settlement. A  Department of Energy  report today will probably
show supplies slid  1.38 million barrels , according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  China  reported passenger-
vehicle sales that beat analysts’ forecasts.  “The market will want to see crude stockpiles continuing
to decline now that we’re into the driving season,” said Ric Spooner, a chief market analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney. “If
things do settle down a bit we may just see some modest increase
in confidence levels and activity levels generally, which would
be supportive of prices.”  Oil for August delivery gained as much as 84 cents to
$84.75 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  and was at $84.62 at 2:35 p.m. Singapore time. The
contract fell $2.08 yesterday to $83.91, the lowest close since
July 2. Prices are down 14 percent this year.  Brent crude  for August settlement climbed 55 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $98.52 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
 Europe  exchange. The European benchmark’s premium to West Texas
Intermediate was at $13.90, from $14.06 yesterday.  Bollinger Band  Oil in New York has technical support along the middle
Bollinger Band on the daily chart, around $83.40 a barrel today,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Futures rebounded
yesterday after trading near that indicator. Buy orders tend to
be clustered close to chart-support levels.  The so-called driving season in the U.S. runs from Memorial
Day at the end of May to Labor Day in early September.  U.S. gasoline inventories gained  2.5 million barrels  last
week, the API figures show. They are projected to rise 500,000
barrels in the government report, according to the survey.
Distillate supplies, a category that includes heating oil and
diesel, dropped 717,000 barrels compared with a forecast
625,000-barrel increase.  The API collects stockpile information on a voluntary basis
from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines. The
government requires that reports be filed with the Department of
Energy for its weekly survey.  Refineries  ran  at 91.8 percent of capacity, the highest for
that week since 2006, the API data show. The government report
will probably show  utilization  rates rose 0.2 percent to 92.2
percent, according to the Bloomberg survey.  China Autos  “If the DOE reports similar numbers, they will likely be
bullish enough to send WTI higher,”  Stephen Schork , president
of Schork Group Inc., a consulting firm in Villanova,
 Pennsylvania , said in an e-mailed report.  China’s wholesale deliveries of passenger vehicles rose 16
percent to 1.28 million units last month, the China Association
of Automobile Manufacturers said in a statement today. That
compares with the 1.27 million average estimate of 14 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Crude prices have experienced widening swings over the past
month. The 10-day historical volatility for New York oil futures
is at 65.13 today compared with 16.3 on June 15. It reached
65.89 on July 3, the highest since May 17, 2011.  Prices slumped yesterday after Norway ended its longest-
ever energy strike. Europe’s second-biggest oil and natural-gas
exporter warned the industry not to use ultimatums that risk
cutting supply. The government announced a plan to resolve the
dispute, which started June 24, with compulsory arbitration
minutes after a deadline at midnight on July 9 that would have
triggered a lockout.  To contact the reporter on this story:
