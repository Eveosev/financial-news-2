Hungaryâ€™s forint strengthened for a
second day against the euro and government bonds gained.  The forint appreciated 0.6 percent to 287.04 per euro by
10:53 a.m. in Budapest. Yields on the benchmark 10-year note
fell five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 7.947
percent.  European stocks advanced for the first time in a week as
U.K. manufacturing unexpectedly gained and euro-area governments
moved to support Spanish banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
