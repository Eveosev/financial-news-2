Abu Dhabi National Energy Co. (TAQA)  said
it’s not in talks about buying a controlling stake in a Dutch
wind farm, denying a media report that the government-run
utility known as Taqa was close to signing an agreement.  Taqa was ready to agree to buy 85 percent of a project to
generate electricity using wind-powered turbines from a Dutch
 investment company  called Typhoon Capital BV,  De Telegraaf 
reported today, without citing anyone. Investment in the project
would total 5.5 billion euros ($6.76 billion), according to the
Amsterdam-based newspaper.  Allan Virtanen, an Abu Dhabi-based spokesman for Taqa,
denied the report, speaking today by telephone from the capital
of the United Arab Emirates.  Taqa owns shares in businesses that generate power or
produce oil and natural gas in the  Middle East , North America,
the North Sea and India and has allocated about $10 billion to
expand those operations or acquire new ones from 2010 through
2014. It borrowed $1.4 billion last month to enlarge a power and
water plant in Morocco. The utility agreed in April to acquire
half of a generator in  Iraq  and is boosting electricity output
in Ghana.  To contact the reporter on this story:
