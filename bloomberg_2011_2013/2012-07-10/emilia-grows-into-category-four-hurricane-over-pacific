Hurricane Emilia grew into a 140
miles (220 kilometers) per hour storm 680 miles south-southwest
of  Mexico â€™s Baja California as it moves west-northwest over
Pacific waters, a Category 4 hurricane on the five-step Saffir-
Simpson scale. Emilia is no threat to land, the National
Hurricane Center said today.  The Miami-based center also said in a 2 a.m. Pacific time
advisory that Daniel had weakened to a tropical storm with 70
mph winds as it sped west at 16 mph about 1,440 miles east of
Hilo,  Hawaii , the center said in a separate advisory.  To contact the reporter on this story:
