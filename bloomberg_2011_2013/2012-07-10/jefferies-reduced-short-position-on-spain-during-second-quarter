Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF) , which faced
investor concern that its European holdings would cause losses
last year after the collapse of MF Global Holdings Ltd., cut a
bet against Spanish debt in the fiscal second quarter.  Jefferies’s so-called net exposure to  Spain  was negative
$31.9 million when the quarter ended May 31, according to a
report filed yesterday by the New York-based firm with U.S.
regulators. That figure reflects ties to sovereign issuers,
corporations, financial institutions and mortgage- and asset-
backed securities and derivatives. The company previously said
it had a net short position -- or bets asset prices will decline
-- of $58.8 million on April 5.  Jefferies’s shift on Spain lowered its total net short
position on five European nations -- also including Portugal,
Ireland, Italy and Greece -- to $125.4 million at the end of the
second quarter, according to the filing. The investment bank had
reported a $192.8 million net short position the previous
period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
