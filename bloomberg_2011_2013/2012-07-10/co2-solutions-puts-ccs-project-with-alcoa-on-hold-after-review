Co2 Solutions Inc. said it and  Alcoa
Inc. (AA)  put on hold plans to develop  carbon capture  and storage
facilities because they couldn’t meet U.S. Department of Energy
targets to finish the work by 2014.  The companies since April 2011 had been studying how to
sequester industrial Co2 emissions from aluminum production
using Alcoa’s technology scrubbing the gases from the aluminum
manufacturing process, Co2 said in a statement today.  “While the project will not proceed as planned, the
technical results validate our belief that our enzyme-enabled
carbon capture technology will become commercially viable for
both carbon dioxide capture and sequestration,” said
Glenn R. Kelly, president and chief executive officer of Co2.
“The positive results from this program have already led to
evaluations of our technology being undertaken with other
industrial partners.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
