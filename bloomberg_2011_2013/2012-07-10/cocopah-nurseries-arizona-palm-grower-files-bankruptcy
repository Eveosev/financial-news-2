Cocopah Nurseries of  Arizona , Inc.,
which grows palm trees and citrus in the desert, filed for
bankruptcy, blaming a slowdown in demand for landscaping from
builders.  The Indio, California-based company said it was forced into
bankruptcy after an out-of-court restructuring failed.  Cocopah and its bankrupt affiliates “remain caught
between, and impacted by the prepetition lenders’ intercreditor
disputes to some degree,” Duane Young, company vice president,
said in court papers filed yesterday in Yuma, Arizona.  The filing comes after new-home sales have begun to grow.
Sales increased 7.6 percent in May to their highest level since
the spring of 2010, mostly on gains in the South and Northeast,
the U.S. Commerce Department reported June 25.  The company owes RaboBank NA $70 million and  Wells Fargo NA (WFC) 
$65 million, according to court papers.  Cocopah plans to use the bankruptcy to keep operating while
it tries to reorganize, according to court papers.  Andy Frokjer, a spokesman for RaboBank, didn’t immediately
return a phone call seeking comment on the bankruptcy. Elise
Wilkinson, a spokeswoman for Wells Fargo, didn’t immediately
return an e-mail seeking comment.  Cocopah has about 250,000 palm trees growing on 14,000
acres in Arizona and 9,000 acres in California.  The case is In re Cocopah Nurseries of Arizona Inc.,
12-15292,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court , District of Arizona (Yuma).  -- With assistance from Bill Rochelle in New York. Editors:
