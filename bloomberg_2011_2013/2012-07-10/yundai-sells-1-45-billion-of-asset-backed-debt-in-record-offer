Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  sold $1.45 billion
bonds backed by auto loans, its largest offering on record of
the debt, after increasing the size of the transaction by $200
million, according to a person familiar with the transaction.  The top-ranked portion from the Seoul-based automaker sold
yesterday and maturing in 2.1 years yields 10 basis points more
than the benchmark swap rate, said the person, who asked not to
be identified because terms aren’t public.  Hyundai raised the size of its transaction as asset-backed
deals soar to $114 billion in the first six months of this year,
a 66 percent increase from the same period in 2011, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Issuance has is being helped by
rising automobile sales, with car companies accounting for about
$54 billion of the transactions.  Investors are snapping up the debt with delinquencies
holding under 1 percent, according to  Fitch Ratings . Payments
more than 60 days late from borrowers with the best credit stood
at 0.33 percent in April, Fitch said in a May 31 report.  Hyundai’s previous asset-backed sale was a $1.35 billion
offering issued Feb. 28, Bloomberg data show. The company paid
16 basis points more than the benchmark  interest rate  on a top-
ranked slice maturing in two years.  U.S. auto sales for June topped analysts’ estimates,
accelerating to a 14.1 million seasonally adjusted annualized
rate, researcher Autodata Corp. said in a July 3 statement. The
pace topped the 13.8 million light-vehicle rate that was the
average estimate of 15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
