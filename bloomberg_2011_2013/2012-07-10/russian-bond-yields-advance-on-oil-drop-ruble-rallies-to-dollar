Yields on  Russia ’s domestic debt
rose for the first time in four days as oil, the country’s main
export, declined. The ruble appreciated against the dollar and
the euro.  Russia’s 138 billion rubles ($4.2 billion) of local OFZ
bonds due July 2015 fell, increasing the yield by two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.41 percent. The ruble
weakened as much as 0.2 percent before trading up 0.3 percent at
32.895 per dollar by the close in Moscow.  Brent crude  slumped 1.6 percent to $98.73 per dollar after
Norway ended an energy strike that threatened to halt production
by western  Europe ’s largest crude exporter and  China  curbed
purchases of the commodity. Oil and gas together provide about
50 percent of Russia’s state revenue, according to the
government’s estimates.  “The current strengthening of the ruble is artificial,”
Igor Akinshin, a Moscow-based currency trader at  Alfa Bank , said
by e-mail. “Oil quotes are still very weak and I don’t believe
in the continuation of this temporary trend.”  The currency may be rallying after last week’s 1.2 percent
loss against the dollar was seen as overdone, he said.  Renaissance Capital  cut its forecast for the average ruble
rate against the dollar this year by 10 percent to 32.5, the
Moscow-based brokerage said in an e-mailed note today. The ruble
has traded at an average 30.7238 per dollar this year, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Current-Account Deficit  “The key to a structurally weakening ruble is the expected
fundamental transition to a current-account deficit that we
expect over the next couple of years,”  Ivan Tchakarov , the
brokerage’s Moscow based chief economist for Russia and the
 Commonwealth of Independent States , said by e-mail. “In 2000
the current-account surplus was 18 percent of gross domestic
product, in 2005 10 percent, this year probably 3 to 4 percent,
so the trend is quite clear.”  The Russian currency will average 34.2 against the dollar
next year, RenCap said.  The ruble strengthened 0.5 percent to 40.3475 per euro and
0.4 percent to 36.2486 against the central bank’s target dollar-
euro basket. Investors pared bets on the currency weakening,
with non-deliverable forwards showing the ruble at 33.3628 per
dollar in three months, compared with expectations of 33.4975
per dollar yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
