Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-
bank lending  rate , opened at 0.17 percent, within the Federal
Reserve’s target of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.28 percent yesterday after trading
from 0.1 percent to 0.28 percent and averaging 0.16 percent,
ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker, said in an e-
mailed statement.  The central bank will acquire $1 billion to $1.5 billion of
Treasury Inflation Protected Securities maturing from July 2018
to February 2042. The purchases are part of the Fed’s program to
replace $267 billion of short-term debt in its portfolio with
longer-term Treasuries in an effort to keep borrowing costs low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
