OAO Mechel,  Russia ’s largest
producer of coal for steelmakers, tumbled for the fourth day
after Chinese trade data stoked concern demand for the commodity
will drop.  Mechel declined 0.8 percent to 201 rubles by the close in
Moscow, the lowest level since June 28.  China ’s imports increased 6.3 percent from a year earlier,
the customs bureau said in a statement today in Beijing, missing
the 11 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 32
economists. Overseas sales gained 11.3 percent, compared with a
15 percent increase the previous month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
