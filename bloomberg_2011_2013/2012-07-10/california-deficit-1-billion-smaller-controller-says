California ended its fiscal year
with a shortfall that was $1 billion less than Governor  Jerry Brown  estimated in May, after the most-populous U.S. state
collected more taxes and spent less in June than projected.  The state spent $89.2 billion in the fiscal year ended June
30 even though it only collected $87.8 billion, Controller John Chiang  said  today. The state also ended the fiscal year with a
$9.6 billion cash deficit, a shortfall covered with internal
borrowing and accounting maneuvers.  June revenue came in about 2 percent, or $247 million,
above what Brown estimated in May, Chiang said, led by personal
income taxes that beat projections by about 8 percent, or $496.3
million. Sales levies were ahead $1.3 million, while corporate
taxes came in at $305.7 million, or about 16 percent below
projections.  Brown and Democrats passed a budget for this fiscal year
that spends $91.3 billion and counts on voters approving higher
taxes in November. Standard & Poor’s rates  California ’s general-
obligation debt A-, the fourth-lowest investment grade. The
company said the budget’s “realistic” solutions to a $15.7
billion deficit warrant a positive outlook on California debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
