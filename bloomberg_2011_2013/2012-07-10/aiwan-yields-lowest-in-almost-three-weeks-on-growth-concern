Taiwan’s government bonds gained,
pushing the benchmark 10-year yield to the lowest level in four
weeks, as a fourth month of falling exports added to signs the
island’s economy is slowing. The local dollar was steady.  Overseas sales dropped 3.2 percent in June from a year
earlier, official data showed yesterday. Economists in a
Bloomberg survey expected a 2.3 percent increase. Spanish 10-
year bond yields climbed above 7 percent on concern euro-area
finance ministers meeting in Brussels this week will fail to
find ways to help governments in the region pay their debts.  “The bad export data adds to pessimism on our economic
outlook,” said  Albert Lee , a Taipei-based fixed-income trader
at Cathay United Bank Co. “The next psychological level for 10-
year yields will be 1.185 percent.”  The yield on the 1.25 percent bonds due March 2022 dropped
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 1.19 percent,
according to Gretai Securities Market. That’s the lowest level
for the benchmark 10-year yield since June 13.  The  Taiwan dollar  traded at NT$29.985 against its U.S.
counterpart, compared with NT$29.975 yesterday, according to
Taipei Forex Inc. It touched NT$30.010 yesterday, the weakest
level since June 26. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, was unchanged at
3.84 percent.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  was steady at 0.509
percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Centre.  To contact the reporter on this story:
