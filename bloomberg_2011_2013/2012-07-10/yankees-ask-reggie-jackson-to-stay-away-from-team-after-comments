The  New York Yankees  have asked
 Reggie Jackson  to stay away from the team after his recent
comments in a Sports Illustrated article that included doubts
about the legitimacy of  Alex Rodriguez ’s home run total.  Jackson, 66, threw out the ceremonial first pitch before
last night’s Major League Baseball Home Run Derby in Kansas City
and said the Yankees told him not to attend last weekend’s four-
game series in Boston. Jackson, a special adviser for the
Yankees, said he hasn’t been suspended from his role.  “It was just a mutual thing where it was best,” Jackson
said, according to  MLB.com . “The clubhouse (at Fenway Park) is
small, a very small place. All the media is there. I didn’t want
to be a disruption.”  Jackson is a Hall of Fame player who spent five of his 21
major league seasons with the Yankees and ranks 13th on the
career list with 563 home runs.  In his comments to  Sports Illustrated , Jackson said he has
an issue with players who used performance-enhancing drugs and
that there are “real questions” about Rodriguez’s home run
totals because he admitted to using such substances while with
the  Texas Rangers  from 2001-03. Rodriguez, the Yankees’ third
baseman, ranks fifth on the MLB career list with 642 homers.  “As much as I like him, what he admitted about his usage
does cloud some of his records,” Jackson was cited as saying.  Jackson also discussed players he believes to be unworthy
of being in the Baseball Hall of Fame, a group that includes
former New York Mets catcher Gary Carter, who died in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
