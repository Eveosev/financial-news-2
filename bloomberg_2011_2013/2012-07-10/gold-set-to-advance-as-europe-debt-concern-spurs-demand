Gold may decline as slowing
inflation from China to the U.S. and gains in the dollar damped
demand for the metal as a hedge.  Spot gold was little changed at $1,586.32 an ounce at 9:10
a.m. in  Singapore , after climbing yesterday for the first day in
four. Holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest exchange-
traded product backed by bullion, fell to a one-month low of
1,275.46 metric tons yesterday, the company’s website showed.  China’s inflation  eased to a 29-month low in June, rising
2.2 percent, data yesterday showed, while U.S. consumer prices
fell in May by the most in more than three years, a report
showed last month. Global inflation may ease to 2.1 percent by
the end of 2012, half a percentage point less than the average
central-bank target, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  “As global growth slows and central banks ease monetary
policy further, this will bring inflation back and benefit gold,
but till then, gold will continue to drift and take direction
from the dollar,” said Xiang Nan, an analyst at CITICS Futures
Co., a unit of  China ’s biggest listed brokerage.  The dollar gained to a two-year high against the euro
yesterday before a meeting today of European Union finance
ministers in Brussels to address the debt crisis. Bullion tends
to move inversely to the greenback, which has gained 3.8 percent
this year against a six-currency basket.  August-delivery gold fell 0.2 percent to $1,586 an ounce on
the Comex in  New York , after advancing 0.7 percent yesterday.  Spot silver dropped as much as 0.3 percent to $27.2575 an
ounce and traded at $27.295. Cash platinum was at $1,444.25 an
ounce compared to yesterday’s close of $1,443.50. Palladium was
little changed at $584.25 an ounce, after a 1.2 percent rise
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
