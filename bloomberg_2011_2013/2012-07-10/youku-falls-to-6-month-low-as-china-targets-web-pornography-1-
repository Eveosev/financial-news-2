Youku Inc. (YOKU) , owner of  China ’s most
popular online video site, tumbled to a six-month low as a new
government campaign targeting online video content considered
pornographic heightened concern of further Internet curbs.  Beijing-based Youku sank 5.1 percent to $19.07 at the close
of trading in New York, its lowest price since Jan. 17.
Shanghai-based  Tudou Holdings Ltd. (TUDO) , an online video operator
which Youku plans to  acquire , lost 4.6 percent to $29.33.  China’s National Office Against Pornographic and Illegal
Publications is planning an anti-pornography campaign, scheduled
from mid-July to the end of November, focused on videos, books,
magazines and online content, Xinhua News Agency said yesterday.
Website operators will be responsible for reviewing online
content before it’s posted on the Internet, said Andy Yeung, a
New York-based analyst for Oppenheimer & Co.  “Operators will have to screen user-generated content for
violence and sexually inappropriate video,” Yeung said in a
phone interview in  New York . “Investors are nervous about the
impact on costs, on the user experience and whether there will
be other regulations in the future.”  Youku said on March 12 that it plans to acquire smaller
rival Tudou in a stock deal  valued  at $737 million.  Phone and e-mail messages to Youku media relations director
Jean Shao in Beijing were not immediately returned after
business hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
