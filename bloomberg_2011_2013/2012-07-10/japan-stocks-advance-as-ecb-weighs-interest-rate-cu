     July 10 (Bloomberg) --　The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  fell a
fourth day, the longest losing streak in a month, after  China ’s
imports grew at about half the pace economists expected, fueling
concern a slowdown is deepening in Japan’s biggest overseas
market.  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , a machinery maker that gets 14 percent of its
sales in China, lost 3.5 percent. Nikon Corp. lost 7 percent
after  Intel Corp . said it will invest in a rival of the Japanese
chip-equipment maker.  Sharp Corp. (6753)  lost 4.2 percent after the
maker of liquid crystal displays agreed to pay almost $200
million to settle a price-fixing suit.  The Nikkei 225 dropped 0.4 percent to close at 8,857.73 in
 Tokyo , capping a four-day loss, the longest streak since June 4.
The broader Topix Index lost 0.7 percent to 758.60, with about
two stocks sliding for each that rose.  “I don’t think China is serious about economic stimulus
because it focuses on cracking down on high property prices
rather than shoring up growth,” said Koichi Kurose, chief
economist in Tokyo at Resona Bank Ltd., which oversees about 15
trillion yen ($189 billion). “I have been saying for a while
that the Nikkei’s upper limit is 9,000.”  The Topix  rebounded  about 9 percent since June 4, when it
closed at its lowest since 1983, after euro leaders agreed to
ease banks’ access for bailout funds and as speculation mounted
central banks around the world will ease policy.  The advance has boosted the average price of shares on the
Japanese gauge to 0.9 times book value, compared with 2.1 times
for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.4 times for the  Europe 
Stoxx 600 Index. A number below one means investors can buy
companies for less than the value of their assets.  China Trade  Stocks lost early gains after a report China’s customs
bureau said imports increased 6.3 percent in June from a year
earlier.  Analysts had expected an 11 percent gain, according to
a Bloomberg survey.  Exporters to China fell. Komatsu lost 3.5 percent to 1,818
yen.  Fanuc Corp. (6954) , which supplies robots for mainland factories,
slid 1.5 percent to 12,550 yen.  Stocks started the day higher after Europe agreed to speed
loans to Spain’s troubled banks. Finance ministers from the 17
euro zone nations reached an agreement to make 30 billion euros
($37 billion) available by the end of the month, Luxembourg
Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  said.  European policy makers “come out with nice, encouraging
things, and the market has a bit of rally,” said Matt Riordan,
who helps manage about $6.5 billion at Paradice Investment
Management Pty. in Sydney. “Then, immediately it becomes clear
that there’s a long-term timeframe and you tend to find
disagreements among different countries.”  Spanish Yields  Futures on the  S&P 500 Index (SPXL1)  slid 0.4 percent today. The
gauge fell 0.2 percent in New York yesterday after yields on
Spain’s 10-year bond rose above the 7 percent threshold that
prompted bailouts in Greece, Ireland and Portugal.  Trading volume on the Nikkei 225 was about 20 percent below
the 100-day average ahead of  Bank of Japan  policy decision July
12.The  Nikkei 225 Volatility Index (VNKY)  fell 2 percent to 19.80,
indicating traders expect a swing of about 5.7 percent on the
benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  Nikon, Japan’s biggest maker of chip lithography equipment,
dropped 7 percent to 2,336 yen. Intel, it’s second-biggest
customer, said it will invest as much as $4.1 billion in ASML
Holding NV.  “We interpret the move as Intel throwing in the towel on
Nikon,”  Pierre Ferragu , a London-based analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein Ltd., wrote in a note.  Sharp lost 4.2 percent to 362 yen after agreeing to pay
$198.5 million to Dell Inc. and two other companies to settle a
price-fixing suit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
