OAO Raspadskaya rose for a second
day after Deutsche Bank AG lifted the Russian coal producer to
buy from hold, citing a stronger price forecast.  Raspadskaya jumped 4 percent to 86.03 rubles by the close
in Moscow, the strongest advance in a week. The stock has lost
13 percent this year and  trades  at 7.5 times estimated earnings,
the highest level since May 6. The Micex Index added 0.6 percent
to 1,422.58.  The upgrade was due to “a combination of higher
metallurgical coal price forecasts, superior production growth
profile, robust free cash flow generation, good scope for
dividends distribution and fading corporate risks,” Deutsche
analysts led by  George Buzhenitsa , said in an e-mailed research
note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
