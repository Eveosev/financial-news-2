BAE Systems Plc (BA/)  and  Dassault
Aviation SA (AM)  are taking longer than they had aimed to secure a
contract for an armed, unmanned drone for the U.K. and France as
the new French government assesses spending priorities, two
people familiar with the negotiations said.  The two countries had aimed to approve the development
contract, valued at about 1 billion euros ($1.23 billion) at
this week’s Farnborough air show, and those plans have now been
canceled, said the people, who asked not to be identified
because the negotiations are private.  The Telemos unmanned aircraft program is one of the
industrial cornerstones of a 2010 agreement between France and
the U.K. on defense cooperation. The medium-altitude, long-
endurance drone would replace the U.K.’s Reaper unmanned
aircraft fleet around 2020 and  France ’s Harphang unmanned
aircraft, based on the Israel Aerospace Industries Heron.  A BAE spokeswoman said an announcement would occur in the
“near term,” while a Dassault spokesman said his company had
no comment.  The French government is considering whether to acquire an
interim unmanned aircraft to replace the Harphang before Telemos
is fielded or whether to try to extend the service life of the
current system that has been used in  Afghanistan .  New French Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian has said he
would take decisions on the country’s unmanned air vehicle plans
by July 14, a date the people said may not be met.  To contact the reporter on this story:
