Oesterreichische Volksbanken AG (VBPS) ’s
regional banking owners, which hold the majority in the
partially nationalized lender, have rejected Stephan Koren
assuming the post of chief executive officer, Der Standard
newspaper reported, without saying where it got the information.  Koren, who is favored by the Austrian Finance Ministry, has
asked for the right to intervene in Volksbanken’s structure,
which has alienated the regional lenders, the Vienna-based
newspaper said. At a supervisory board meeting yesterday they
instead proposed deputy CEO Michael Mendel for the top job,
according to the report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
