Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA (ELET6) 
expects the Brazilian government to decide on the renewal of
hydroelectric licenses this quarter, according to an e-mailed
statement.  The company in the next few years will start operating
plants with similar capacity to those with expiring concessions,
according to an e-mailed statement sent by the companyâ€™s press
office in response to questions.  The licenses that Eletrobras, as the company is known,
expects to be renewed expire in 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
