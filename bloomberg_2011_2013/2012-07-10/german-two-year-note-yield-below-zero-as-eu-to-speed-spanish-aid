Spain ’s  10-year bonds  rose for the
first time in five days, pushing the yield to less than 7
percent, as euro-region leaders agreed to accelerate rescue
loans for the nation’s banks.  Italian securities also advanced on speculation the
measures will stem the spread of the debt crisis. Finance chiefs
agreed to lend 30 billion euros ($36.8 billion) by the end of
this month. German  two-year note  yields fell below zero for the
third consecutive day and the Netherlands sold 2.55 billion
euros of three-year notes at a record-low yield. Greece
auctioned six-month bills.  “Spanish and Italian bonds have picked up a little bit of
a bid,” said  Peter Chatwell , a fixed-income strategist at
Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in  London . “The
market was positioned for a slightly worse outcome from the
summit, and there’s been some unwinding of short positions,” he
said, referring to bets that an asset price will fall.  Spanish 10-year yields fell 24 basis points, or 0.24
percentage point, to 6.82 percent at 4:29 p.m. London time. The
5.85 percent bond due January 2022 gained 1.58, or 15.80 euros
per 1,000-euro face amount, to 93.31. The rate on similar-
maturity Italian debt dropped 15 basis points to 5.96 percent.  Euro ministers gave Spain an extra year to cut its  budget
deficit  to less than 3 percent of gross domestic product after a
meeting in Brussels ended today. Loans to the nation will
average 12.5 years and run as long as 15 years, with the goal of
eventually using the euro-area bailout fund to recapitalize
banks directly instead of burdening the Spanish government.  ‘Some Hope’  “The outcome of the euro group meeting could have been
worse,” said Norbert Aul, a rates strategist at Royal Bank of
Canada in London. “At least we have some hope that we have the
potential mutualization of financial liabilities in the medium-
to-long term.”  Spanish banks will receive European rescue-fund bonds that
can be turned into cash at the  European Central Bank , according
to Economy Minister Luis de Guindos.  Spain’s FROB rescue fund will distribute bonds issued by
the European Financial Stability Facility to the banks, which
“can use them at the ECB if they need the liquidity,” de
Guindos told reporters in Brussels today.  German Debt  The EFSF sold 6 billion euros of bonds due in September
2017 to yield 1.65 percent in an offering via banks today.  The rate on  Italy ’s two-year note fell as much as 39 basis
points to 3.75 percent before climbing back to 3.98 percent. The
yield on similar-maturity Spanish debt dropped 33 basis points
to 4.75 percent after sliding as low as 4.63 percent. Those are
the biggest intraday declines since June 29, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Germany ’s  borrowing costs  have plunged to records as
investors sought havens from  Europe ’s financial turmoil. The
nation will auction an additional five billion euros of 10-year
bonds tomorrow. It sold six-month bills yesterday at a record-
low yield of minus 0.0344 percent, while  France  auctioned
similar-maturity debt at a negative yield for the first time.  The German two-year note yield was at zero after dropping
to minus 0.016 percent, approaching the all-time low of minus
0.018 percent set on July 6. The 10-year yield was little
changed at 1.32 percent, after reaching a  record-low  1.127
percent on June 1.  Dutch Auction  The Netherlands allotted 2.55 billion euros of 0.75 percent
notes due in April 2015 at a yield of 0.218 percent, the lowest
rate on debt with a similar maturity since Bloomberg began
tracking the data in 1999.  Greece  sold 1.625 billion euros of
six-month bills at a yield of 4.7 percent, compared with a rate
of 4.73 percent at an auction of similar debt on June 12.  Volatility on Spanish government debt was the highest in
developed markets today, followed by Belgium and  Austria ,
according to measures of 10-year bonds, the spread between two-
and 10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  The rate on Austrian two-year notes fell as much as eight
basis points to a record 0.112 percent, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  German debt returned 3.6 percent this year, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish securities lost 6.5
percent, with Italian bonds making 7.2 percent.  The yield difference, or  spread , between German 10-year
bunds and two-year notes may slip to the lowest in almost six-
weeks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, based on
technical indicators.  The spread, currently at 132 basis points, is below its 50-
data moving average of 137 basis points and may target a move
toward the June 1 low of 113 basis points, the data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
