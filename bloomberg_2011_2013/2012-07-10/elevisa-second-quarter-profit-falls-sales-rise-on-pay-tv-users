Grupo Televisa SAB, the world’s
largest Spanish-language broadcaster, said second-quarter profit
fell 16 percent on a reduction in the value of its wireless
investment. Sales beat analysts’ forecasts.  Net income slid to 1.4 billion pesos ($105 million), from
1.66 billion pesos a year earlier, Televisa said today in a
filing to  Mexico ’s stock exchange. Sales rose 12 percent to 17
billion pesos, topping the average estimate of 16.6 billion
pesos by seven analysts tracked by Bloomberg.  Televisa recorded financial costs of 945 million pesos in
the quarter, double last year’s total, mostly for a reduction in
the value of its $1.6 billion investment in Grupo Iusacell SA,
Mexico’s third-largest wireless carrier. The writedown for
accounting purposes didn’t involve a cash expense. The
broadcaster, based in Mexico City, acquired a 50 percent stake
in the mobile-phone company last month.  Advertising for Televisa’s over-the-air channels was little
changed from a year earlier at 5.57 billion pesos, even after a
Mexican law banned government advertising before the nation’s
presidential elections on July 1.  “Despite the impact that the electoral campaign had in
Mexico during the quarter, and consequently the temporary
absence of certain advertisers, sales growth beat our
expectations,” Julio Zetina, an analyst at Vector Casa de Bolsa
SA in Mexico City, said today in a research note. “This was a
good report.”  Sales Forecast  Televisa boosted its forecast for 2012 sales in the content
unit, which includes broadcast advertising, syndication revenue
and sales from Televisa’s cable channels. Content revenue will
rise 7 percent to 8 percent in 2012, compared with an earlier
forecast for growth of 6 percent to 7 percent, said Alfonso de Angoitia, executive vice president, today in a conference call.  The company added 267,090 satellite TV subscribers for a
total of 4.55 million. Its three cable units, all controlled by
Televisa, added more than 14,500 video subscribers, 36,100
Internet customers and 15,400 phone lines.  Televisa rose 0.9 percent to 57.06 pesos at the close in
Mexico City. The shares have dropped 2.8 percent this year.  (Televisa held a conference call today to discuss second-
