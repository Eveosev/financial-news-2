The Australian dollar climbed to a
record high against the euro as investors used the shared
currency to buy higher-yielding assets.  The Aussie fell for a third day against the greenback amid
concerns  China ’s economic slowdown may be worse than perceived
and Europe’s debt crisis remains unresolved. New Zealand’s
dollar rose against the euro and fell against the  U.S. dollar .
China,  Australia ’s biggest trading partner, said inbound
shipments rose less than expected.  There is “less demand” for commodity currencies,  Fabian Eliasson , head of U.S. currency sales at Mizuho Financial Group
Inc. in  New York , said in an interview. “Overall fear that
global growth is slowing down -- China coupled with Europe --
doesn’t give much hope.”  The Australian dollar gained as much as 0.6 percent to
A$1.1988 per euro yesterday in New York before trading at
A$1.2020, up 0.4 percent. The Aussie declined 0.2 percent to
$1.0192 and fell 0.3 percent to 80.95 yen. The  New Zealand’s currency, nicknamed the kiwi, rose 0.2
percent to NZ$1.5430 per euro. The kiwi fell 0.3 percent to
79.40 U.S. cents and depreciated 0.5 percent to 63.06 yen.  A report today may show Australia failed to gain jobs in
June and the  unemployment rate  rose to 5.2 percent, from 5.1
percent the previous month, according  surveys  of economists
Bloomberg News.  China’s  imports  rose 6.3 percent from a year earlier, the
customs bureau said in a statement yesterday in Beijing,
compared with the 11 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey. Exports climbed 11.3 percent.  The world’s second-largest economy is projected to report a
slowdown in the second quarter when it releases gross domestic
product data on July 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
