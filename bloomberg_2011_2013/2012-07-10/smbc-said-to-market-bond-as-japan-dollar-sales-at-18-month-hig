Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. sold
$3 billion of dollar-denominated bonds in a three-part offering
as Japanese borrowers issue the most notes in the U.S. currency
in any week since January 2011.  The lending unit of  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316) 
sold $1 billion of 1.35 percent, three-year notes that yielded
100 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, $1.25
billion of 1.8 percent, five-year debt with a 120 basis-point
spread and $750 million of 10-year bonds with a 3.2 percent
coupon that yielded 170 more than benchmarks, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. (4502)  and  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058)  raised $3.75
billion yesterday, making it the busiest week for Japanese
corporate bonds in 18 months.  Companies in the world’s third-biggest economy are taking
advantage of a drop in costs this year as perceptions of
Japanese corporate creditworthiness reached a two-month high
last week.  Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411)  is also meeting investors
about a possible 10-year subordinated dollar bond, according to
a different person.  “Banks are trying to expand their overseas operations to
counter the weak borrowing demand that the poor economy has
prompted in Japan,” said Tetsuya Yamamoto, a senior analyst at
Moody’s Investors Service in Tokyo. “They need foreign currency
to meet the funding needs of Japanese companies overseas and to
fund their own overseas operations,” he said by phone
yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
