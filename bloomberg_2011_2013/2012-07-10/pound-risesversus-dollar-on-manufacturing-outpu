The pound strengthened to the
highest level in more than three-and-a-half years against the
euro as a report showed U.K. manufacturing unexpectedly surged
in May.  Yields on the 10-year gilt climbed the most in a week after
the  Office for National Statistics  said factory output rose 1.2
percent from April versus economists’ forecast of a 0.1 percent
drop. The pound fell versus the dollar after Bank of England
Governor  Mervyn King  said he saw no “great signs” of a
recovery. The central bank said on July 5 it would inject an
extra 50 billion pounds ($77.7 billion) of so-called
quantitative easing to boost the economy.  “The U.K. numbers were better than expected and that is
providing sterling with some relief,” said Ankita Dudani, a
foreign-exchange strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
in  London . “Our economists believe there is still more QE to
come. Today’s data doesn’t mean the economy is returning to
growth.”  Sterling rose for a fifth day against the common currency,
climbing 0.3 percent to 79.04 pence per euro at 4:54 p.m. London
time. It touched 79 pence, the strongest level since November
2008. The pound fell 0.2 percent to $1.5502, after gaining to
$1.5549.  The U.K. currency has advanced 4.3 percent in the past
year, the third-best performer after the yen and dollar among
the 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes.  The  Bank of England ’s King said the pound’s appreciation on
exports may further dent prospects for the U.K. economy.  Strength Challenge  “I am worried because sterling has risen over the past
year -- that’s going to be a challenge -- and because of the
state of the euro area,” King said in an interview broadcast on
BBC Radio 4 today. “The economy has basically been flat for two
years.”  The economy shrank for a third quarter in the three months
through June as the first double-dip recession since the 1970s
deepened, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research
said today.  Sterling has support at $1.5469, the 61.8 percent Fibonacci
retracement of its rally in June, as well as the July low at
$1.5461, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Support refers to an area on a price graph where analysts
anticipate orders to buy a security. Fibonacci analysis is based
on the theory that prices rise or fall by certain percentages
after reaching a high or low.  Haven Flows  Ten-year gilt yields were little changed at 1.59 percent
after rising to 1.61 percent. The 4 percent gilt due March 2022
fell 0.04, or 40 pence per 1,000-pound face amount, to 121.54.  U.K. government debt has returned 3.1 percent this year,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds have
handed investors a return of 3.6 percent, while Spanish bonds
have lost 6.5 percent.  Gilts have benefited from haven flows as investors sought
alternatives amid a deepening of the euro-area crisis. Demand
for higher-rated European assets declined after euro-region
leaders agreed to disburse 30 billion euros ($36.8 billion) by
the end of July as part of a 100 billion-euro plan to strengthen
 Spain ’s ailing banks.  “The Spanish agreement is a step in the right direction
and the market took it positively,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a
fixed-income strategist at RIA Capital Markets Ltd. in
Edinburgh. “We still need details, but it’s enough to support
risk appetite for now. That’s why bonds in the core market have
lost their shine.”  The government sold 900 million pounds of inflation-
protected bonds maturing in March 2050 to yield 0.11 percent.
The difference in yields between 10-year gilts and index-linked
securities narrowed three basis points to 241 basis points, the
least since June 22.  To contact the reporters on this story:
