Vietnam ’s five-year government bonds
fell for a third day, pushing the yield to the highest level
this month, on speculation banks will reduce holdings so they
can lend more this half. The dong was steady.  The government is targeting 2 percent credit growth per
month in the second half, Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc
said in June. The  overnight interbank deposit rate  rose for the
first time in four days, signaling increased demand for funds in
the banking system.  “Banks will be trying to lend money out, so they will have
less money to buy bonds,” said Nguyen Tan Thang, head of fixed-
income research at  Ho Chi Minh City Securities Corp. (HCM)   The yield on the government’s benchmark  five-year bonds 
rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 9.79 percent,
according to a daily fixing rate from banks compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s the highest level since June 27.  The dong was little changed at 20,880 per dollar as of 3:49
p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
 State Bank  of Vietnam set its reference rate at 20,828,
unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its website. The currency
is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either side of the
fixing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
