Hellenic Exchanges Holdings SA (EXAE) , the
operator of Greek financial markets, said it plans to revise
bourse indexes as of Dec. 3 to boost trading.  The changes will include increasing the number of companies
in the FTSE/ASE 20 index of large companies to 25 from 20 and
changing the index’s name to FTSE/ATHEX Large Cap to improve
liquidity, the market operator said today in an e-mailed
statement.  Fears that  Greece  would leave the euro area have dissuaded
investors from adding to their holdings of Greek companies,
while the biggest sovereign-debt write off in history earlier
this year hurt banks listed on the exchange, including  National
Bank of Greece SA , the country’s largest lender.  Turnover on the  Athens exchange  fell to 1.04 billion euros
($1.3 billion) in June, the bourse said yesterday, down 43
percent from a year earlier. The value of all stocks on the
exchange now is 24.5 billion euros, half the 49 billion euros at
the end of June last year.  The FTSE/ASE index of mid-cap companies will be cut to 20
from 40 to increase the tradability of the index, according to
the statement. A new index for small companies, based on factors
including fundamentals, will replace the FTSE/ASE Small-Cap
Index that is based only on market capitalization, Hellenic
Exchanges said.  The market operator also plans to ease free-float rules so
that companies whose free float falls below the minimum
requirement of 15 percent following a restructuring, such as
receiving a capital injection by way of an equity issue from the
government, will be accepted into indexes with its actual free
float.  To contact the reporters on this story:
