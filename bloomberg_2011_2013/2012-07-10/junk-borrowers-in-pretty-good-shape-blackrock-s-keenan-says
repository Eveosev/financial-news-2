James Keenan, the New York-based
head of leveraged finance and high-yield at  BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , said
that junk-rated corporate borrowers are in “pretty good
shape.” Keenan spoke today in an interview with  Stephanie Ruhle 
and  Erik Schatzker  on Bloomberg Television’s “Market Makers.”  With companies using credit markets to finance debt
extensions, there is not that much maturing in the next few
years, Keenan said. “It’s hard to see a lot of defaults without
a significant recession.”  The global trailing 12-month speculative-grade default rate
increased to an estimated 2.7 percent in June, from 2.6 percent
a month earlier, according to Standard & Poor’s report. The U.S.
economy grew 1.9 percent in the first quarter, according to
figures from the Commerce Department.  “We are seeing a global growth slowdown,” Keenan said.
“Not just in the United Sates, but in Europe and Latin America,
as well.”  The world’s biggest money manager has targeted sectors such
as autos, hospitals, natural gas and U.S. chemicals, as well as
infrastructure surrounding broadband, Keenan said.  High-yield investors are picking up an extra 7 percentage
points of yield relative to Treasuries, said Keenan. “The
excess spread you’re getting is pretty significant.”  Speculative-grade debt is rated less than Baa3 by Moody’s
Investors Service and below BBB- by Standard & Poor’s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
