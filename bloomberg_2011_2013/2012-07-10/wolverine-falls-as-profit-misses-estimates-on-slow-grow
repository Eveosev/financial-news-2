Wolverine World Wide Inc. (WWW) , owner of
the Hush Puppies shoe brand, fell after second-quarter profit
missed estimates and sales were little changed.  Wolverine  declined  2.8 percent to $37.25 at 8:58 a.m. in
 New York  before the start of regular trading. The shares had
gained 7.5 percent this year through yesterday.  Net income for the quarter ended June 16 declined 14
percent to $20.5 million, or 42 cents a share, from $24 million,
or 48 cents, a year earlier, the Rockford, Michigan-based
company said in a statement today. Excluding some items, profit
was 41 cents. Analysts projected 44 cents, according to
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Sales rose 0.8 percent to $312.7 million as markets in
 Europe  underperformed, the company said. Analysts on average had
estimated $314.6 million, according to the data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The company reiterated an annual sales forecast of as much
as $1.5 billion. That trailed analystsâ€™ average estimate of $1.6
billion.  Wolverine said its purchase of four brands from  Collective
Brands Inc. (PSS)  will close in the third or fourth quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
