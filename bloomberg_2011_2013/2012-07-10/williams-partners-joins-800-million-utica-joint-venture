Williams Partners LP (WPZ)  is joining with
Caiman Energy II LLC and private-equity firms EnCap Flatrock
Midstream and Highstar Capital to invest $800 million in
pipelines and processing facilities for oil and natural-gas
production in the Utica Shale.  Williams will contribute about $380 million in the next
several years to the venture, according to a statement from the
Tulsa, Oklahoma-based company today. The funds will be used to
build pipelines to gather and process oil, gas and petroleum
liquids in Ohio and Northwest Pennsylvania.  “Our producer customers will benefit from introducing the
kind of comprehensive large-scale midstream solutions to the
area that will make their positions in the liquids- and oil-rich
Utica Shale even more valuable,” Alan Armstrong, chief
executive officer of Williams Cos., said in the statement.  The Utica shale formation in  Ohio  may hold as much 5.5
billion barrels of oil and 15.7 trillion cubic feet of natural
gas, according to the state’s Department of Natural Resources.
Shale is a dense rock into which drillers shoot water, chemicals
and sand to release oil or gas.  Williams Cos. owns the general partner of Williams
Partners.  To contact the reporter on this story:
