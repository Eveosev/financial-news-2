U.S. corn and soybean acreage will
be lower than previously expected as farmers abandon more fields
due to drought, according to Michael Cordonnier, the president
of Soybean & Corn Advisor Inc.  The outlook for corn harvested acreage was cut by 200,000
acres to 88.3 million acres and the estimate for soybeans was
lowered by 200,000 acres to 73.8 million acres, Cordonnier wrote
in a report on the company’s website today.  “If this weather pattern doesn’t change soon, the corn
harvested acreage will continue to decline,” Cordonnier wrote.
“If the corn crop continues to suffer, more farmers may opt for
insurance payments instead of the risk for very low yields.”  About 40 percent of the U.S. corn crop was in good or
excellent condition as of July 8, down from 48 percent a week
earlier, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  reported yesterday.
An estimated 40 percent of soybeans got the top ratings, down
from 45 percent a week earlier.  For soybeans, “the biggest risk is for increased
abandonment of the late-planted double crop soybeans which are
certainly getting off to a poor start,” Cordonnier wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
