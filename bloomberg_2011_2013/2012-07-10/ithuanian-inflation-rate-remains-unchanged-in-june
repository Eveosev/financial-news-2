     (Corrects monthly figure in second paragraph.)  Lithuanian  inflation  remained
unchanged in June at the lowest level in 21 months.  Consumer prices rose 2.5 percent in June, the  statistics
office  in the capital, Vilnius, said today in an e-mailed
statement. Prices fell 0.1 percent from the previous month.  Slowing inflation is helping shore up the Baltic nationâ€™s
domestic consumption and economic expansion, which slowed to 3.9
percent in the first quarter. Improving inflation expectations
helped raise  consumer sentiment  to the highest in 11 month in
June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
