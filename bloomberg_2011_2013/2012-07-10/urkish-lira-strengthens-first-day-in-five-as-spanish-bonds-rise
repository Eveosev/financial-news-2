The lira appreciated for the first
time in five days, reversing earlier losses, as a rebound in
 Spain ’s bonds lifted risk appetite for emerging-market assets.  The lira appreciated 0.2 percent to 1.8168 against the
dollar at 12:54 p.m. in Istanbul, extending its gain this year
to 4.1 percent. It weakened as much as 0.3 percent in earlier
trading. Yields on two-year benchmark debt were unchanged at
8.02 percent.  Spain’s 10-year yield slid 17 basis points to 6.90 percent,
the lowest level since July 6. European governments will jump-
start as much as 100 billion euros ($123 billion) in loans to
shore up Spain’s banks, Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  said after chairing a nine-hour meeting of euro-region
finance ministers. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose 0.8 percent
at 9:50 a.m. in  London , and Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures
added 0.2 percent. Turkey sells almost 40 percent of its exports
to the European Union, which it seeks to join.  “The global markets are recovering and we are seeing
buying in Spanish and Italian bonds after statements from
European officials,” Suha Yaygin, deputy head of trading for
 emerging markets  at Toronto Dominion Bank in London, said in e-
mailed comments.  The cost of insuring against default on European sovereign
debt fell for the first time in five days.  Output Expansion  Industrial production in  Turkey  expanded in May from a year
ago at almost triple the pace that analysts expected as capital
goods and non-durable goods output surged.  Output grew 5.9 percent from May 2011, the statistics
office in Ankara said on its website yesterday. It was expected
to rise 2 percent, according to the median estimate of six
economists questioned by Bloomberg. Production expanded an
annual 1.8 percent in April.  The central bank lent today at its minimum 5.75 percent
policy rate for a 26th consecutive day, the longest stretch of
funding at the lowest policy rate since March 21, reducing
borrowing costs.  The overnight cost of borrowing dropped to 6.34 percent in
the Turkish  interbank market , the least on a closing basis since
Oct.17 and down from 10.5 at the beginning of this year.
