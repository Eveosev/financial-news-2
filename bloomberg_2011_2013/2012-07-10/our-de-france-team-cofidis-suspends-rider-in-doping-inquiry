Tour de France  team Cofidis said it
suspended rider  Remy di Gregorio  as it investigates whether he
tried to take performance-enhancing drugs.  The French team said in an e-mailed statement the case was
an “isolated” incident and it will continue competing in the
cycle race, which resumes tomorrow after a rest day. Di
Gregorio, a 26-year-old Frenchman, was 35th overall, 18 minutes,
7 seconds behind race leader Bradley Wiggins of Britain.  Earlier today,  Agence France-Presse  reported that police
raided the  Cofidis team  hotel in Bourg-en-Bresse in eastern
France, and arrested Di Gregorio in connection with an inquiry
that was opened last year.  “We have very little information at the moment about the
events that are said to have taken place,” Cofidis said in the
statement. Di Gregorio will be fired if found to have breached
team rules on ethics, it said.  The team is named after main sponsor Cofidis SA, a French
consumer credit company that earlier this year agreed to extend
its backing through 2016.  In 2007, the Cofidis team withdrew from the Tour de  France 
after one of its then riders, Italy’s Cristian Moreni, failed a
drug test for synthetic testosterone.  To contact the reporters on this story:
