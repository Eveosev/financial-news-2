With just weeks left until the
 London 2012 Olympics  start on July 27, chefs and restaurateurs
are divided on what the Games will mean for business.  Some fret that regular diners will work from home and avoid
the center of the city, while road closures mean that deliveries
will have to be made during the night. Others expect an influx
of visitors keen to explore  London ’s culinary landscape.  Here’s what 40 industry insiders had to say:  Tom Aikens  (Tom Aikens): “We expect to be busy. We’re
supporting the  London Fair Practice and Pricing Charter , which
commits us to maintaining our usual prices and working in an
ethical, environmentally sustainable way.”  Joel Antunes (Kitchen Joel Antunes): “I was in Atlanta
during the 1996 Olympics and business was not good. This time,
my plan is to take the opportunity to visit family in  France .”  Jason Atherton (Pollen Street Social): “The Olympics will
be amazing for London and I’m proud we are hosting them. London
will be tough for a few weeks regarding deliveries and also
transport for staff getting into central London.”  Pascal Aussignac (Club Gascon): “The Olympic time may
bring more business but certainly more difficulties. I hope the
Olympic buzz will become a good souvenir for us.”  Will Beckett (Hawksmoor): “Our Seven Dials restaurant will
be rammed; Spitalfields: no change; Guildhall: quieter. My guess
is that the City will be quiet with office workers staying at
home and not being replaced by tourists.”  Vineet Bhatia (Rasoi): “We are expecting a lot more people
coming in but as ours is a small restaurant, we will always have
a problem fitting them in. A lot of dignitaries and hotel guests
will keep the restaurant busy.”  Claude Bosi (Hibiscus): “Expect nothing momentous from the
outset, but prepare for being slammed on the day. We’ve extended
our opening hours -- last orders now 11 p.m. -- to allow our
guests to get back from the events. We’ve picked up on corporate
bookings. But we’re expecting delivery costs to go up.”  Richard Corrigan (Corrigan’s Mayfair): “We’re hugely
looking forward to the Games. With all the attention on London,
and the influx of visitors, it’s an opportunity to showcase all
that is good from these islands. We look forward to welcoming
visitors to a taste of seasonal British and Irish produce.”  Chris Galvin (Galvin La Chapelle): “Our plans are to be
super-flexible. We’ve cross-trained so that we can send staff
from one restaurant to another if one gets busy. We want to show
the world how good the food and service is in London.”  Alexis Gauthier (Gauthier): “We already have a 50 percent
increase in bookings for the Olympics compared to the same
period last year. Most are for private rooms, which is unusual
for this time of the year. We are not doing anything special for
the Games other than accepting euro and dollar notes.”  Stuart Gillies ( Gordon Ramsay ): “It’s an opportunity for
one of the greatest food cities in the world to showcase what we
are all about. We are expecting a certain amount of disruption
during an unpredictable period but we’ll manage as best we can,
and take it all in the spirit of the event.”  Brett Graham  (The Ledbury): “The Olympics won’t affect
business levels as we are in the fortunate position of being
fully booked for every service. The only way it could change
things is if customers have a hard time getting here due to
public-transport problems.”  Trevor Gulliver (St John Hotel): “Every single sports
federation across all sports across the world, every event
organizer, politician, agent, sponsor, sponsors’ client, sports
lobbyist, celebrity -- if they are on expenses -- they will be
here. I’d like to think that some will cross our threshold.”  Des Gunewardena ( D&D London ): “We’ve already taken lots of
bookings from sponsors, national Olympic committees and
corporations. It’s clear that we will get a boost to our
revenues and I think that this will outweigh the loss of
business due to companies advising their staff to stay home.”  Henry Harris  (Racine): “It’s not going to be the savior of
the restaurant economy that a lot of people think. Many people
will be entertained corporately and have their dining taken care
of. It will be of assistance but how much, I don’t know. Many
people are just going to want a slice of pizza somewhere.”  Sam Hart  (Fino): “The Olympics is anyone’s guess. We have
no idea what’s going to happen.”  Anna Hansen  (Modern Pantry): “Loads of Londoners are going
away because they don’t want to be around all the traffic jams
and we’ll also have deliveries in the middle of the night. But,
because we are a bit East side and because of our price point,
I’m hoping we’ll be pretty busy.”  Angela Hartnett  (Murano): “I am really excited about the
Olympics as I will be working with Smart Hospitality catering to
the corporate sponsors. London is going to be buzzing, with the
whole world focusing on us, which can only be a good thing for
the restaurants, not just this summer but in the future.”  Mark Hix (Tramshed): “It could go either way. The road
closures are going to be a nightmare and at each site we are
going to have to employ someone to accept deliveries. If the
Jubilee is anything to go by, then business will be down.”  Niall Howard (Hakkasan): “It will probably be like the
royal wedding last year, when the expectations were high and the
reality was mediocre. A lot of people will come to London but
others will go away, so it will be neutral.”  Philip Howard  (The Square): “I think the Olympics will
boost all businesses, but particularly restaurants in the mid-
priced bracket.”  Soren Jessen (1 Lombard Street): “A lot of people expect a
negative effect, with regulars fleeing town. The sports tourists
are not the normal type of clients. We’re lobbying embassies,
Olympics committees, sponsors, etc., because if we don’t attract
Olympics visitors there will be no business.”  Atul Kochhar (Benares): “The Olympics should be great for
the hospitality industry. We are positive about the business
during this period.”  Pierre Koffmann (Koffmann’s): “We hope we will be busy but
we’ll see. We’re just crossing our fingers. Some places have
been booked by big companies so they will be full every day but
for us, I don’t know.”  Jeremy Lee (Quo Vadis): “Hopefully, being in Soho, we will
see tired and hungry adventurers returned from the easterly
Olympic marvels needing a restorative glass and a plate of
invigorating sustenance while the few remaining in town carry on
as the much ado in the East remains just that.”  Bruno Loubet (Bistrot Bruno Loubet): “Nobody knows. We
think breakfast will be popular and then during the day,
visitors will be watching the Olympics or walking about the
city. The restaurant is likely to get busier again late evening.
We are looking to open the kitchen earlier and stay open
later.”  Francesco Mazzei (L’Anima): “We believe that the Olympics
will have a positive effect on our business. We have some
corporate bookings for the period. Also, we’re near Liverpool
Street station, which is a short ride to the Games.”  Nuno Mendes (Viajante): “The Olympics will, hopefully,
have a positive impact on our business. We are expecting to be
busy and we also plan to be open for lunch during this time.
There is a great deal of attention in East London and we are
right in the middle of it, so it should be fun.”  Russell Norman (Polpo Soho): “Because roads are closed to
normal traffic for weeks, we will be employing extra staff at
each site to take deliveries. I’m not sure that a sporting event
in East London will furnish us with any extra custom and I also
fear that our regular customers will get away from London.”  Simon Rogan (Roganic): “It won’t affect Roganic very much
as it is tiny and can’t do any more covers than we do already.”  Michel Roux Jr. (Le Gavroche): “We are hoping for the best
and expecting the worst as chefs are pretty pessimistic. But I
am overjoyed that the Olympics are coming to London. It will be
a showcase for  Great Britain  and a huge success, like the
Jubilee.”  David Strauss  (Goodman City): “Most visitors may be here
just to soak up the atmosphere, which is enjoyable, but results
in less profit. The Manchester United versus Barcelona Champions
League Final last year was one of the busiest, noisiest, most
enjoyable lunches we’ve had and the average spend was rubbish.”  Aggi Sverrisson (Texture): “We expect to be busy. We
usually close on Mondays and for the first two weeks in August,
but we’re postponing that this year. We already have several
private parties booked so we think it will pay off. However, we
expect our 28-50 restaurant in Fetter Lane to be fairly quiet.”  Jun Tanaka (Pearl): “The ( Chancery Court ) hotel has been
fully booked during the Olympics for two years. We expect the
restaurant to be extremely busy. All the suppliers are
delivering before 6 a.m. so I will have one of my chefs working
a night shift to check the deliveries and to stay on top.”  Ben Tish (Salt Yard): “We have extra staff around and we
have had to look at our delivery times. We hope it’s going to be
busy but we already are and we only have so many seats and hours
in the day. There could be a lot of people staying and working
from home, so this might have a negative effect.”  Ewan Venters (Ex-Selfridges): “We’re enthusiastic about
what the Olympics and post-Olympics will do for the city. It
will encourage a great number of visitors from across the U.K.
and internationally, so we’re optimistic there will be a good
volume, which is great for the hospitality industry.”  Marcus Wareing  (Marcus Wareing at the Berkeley): “We
believe we will definitely see a positive impact, which is why
we will be open for lunch on Saturdays throughout the Olympics.
This is something we have never done before.”  Alyn Williams (Alyn Williams at the Westbury): “We expect
to see an increase in business. Many Olympians and their
managers are staying at the Westbury. We have plans for a quick
light lunch menu for visitors to eat between events.”  Bryn Williams (Odette’s): “We are a neighborhood
restaurant with regular customers, so we are not relying on
bookings just because of the Olympics. We have also been
approached to cater for large private events taking place during
the Games, away from the restaurant.”  Jad Youssef (Yalla Yalla): “The Olympics will keep us
busy, especially when people come to celebrate the victory of
their countries.”  (Richard Vines is the chief food critic for Muse, the arts
