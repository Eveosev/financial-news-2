 The benchmark  BUX (BUX)  index climbed 0.4
percent to 17,182.22 by the close in Budapest.  The following were among the most active shares in the
Hungarian market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Mol Nyrt. (MOL)  ,  Hungary ’s largest refiner, advanced 2.8
percent to 16,540 forint. Emerging-market stocks rose for the
first time in five days as European leaders moved to strengthen
Spanish banks, easing concern the region’s debt crisis will hit
economic growth and demand for developing nations’ exports.  Est Media Vagyonkezelo Nyrt. (ESTMEDIA HB), a Hungarian
entertainment company, rallied the most in a month as a
technical indicator signaled its decline was overdone. The
shares increased 14 percent to 24 forint. The stock’s 13 percent
plunge to a record low yesterday pushed its 14-day relative
strength index to 17. RSI levels below 30 indicate to some
analysts that a security is oversold. The RSI last traded at 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
