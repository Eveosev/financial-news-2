Investec Plc (INL)  increased the size of a
loan it will sign this week by 50 percent to 180 million pounds
($279 million) after lenders offered more money than was sought,
according to a person with direct knowledge of the deal.  The three-year term loan, which will be used for general
corporate purposes at London-based Investec Bank Plc, was
arranged by Lloyds Banking Group Plc and attracted 13 lenders to
the syndicate, said the person, who asked not to be identified
as the terms are private. The deal is expected to sign tomorrow.  The bank will pay interest of 200 basis points, or 2
percentage points, more than the  London  interbank offered rate
on the debt, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The loan
will be repaid in three equal installments starting two years
after it’s signed, the person said.  Investec, founded in  South Africa  in 1974 and listed in
London since 2002, reported on May 17 a 41 percent drop in full-
year profit after costs rose and trading income slumped amid
 Europe ’s debt crisis. Investec  rose  1 percent to 385.5 pence at
10 a.m. in London, extending its yearly gain to 14 percent and
boosting its market value to 3.4 billion pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
