India’s benchmark stock index rose,
tracking gains in European equities, as the biggest drop in
three weeks lured investors and after the weather bureau said
monsoon rains may cover the entire nation sooner than expected.  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , the owner of Jaguar Land Rover, climbed
2.4 percent to the highest in two weeks, pacing gains among
other auto stocks.  Larsen & Toubro Ltd. (LT) , the largest engineering
company, gained 2 percent, and cigarettes-to-hotels group  ITC
Ltd. (ITC)  jumped 2.7 percent, the most since June 29.  The  BSE India Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, rose 1.3 percent
to 17,618.35, its highest close since March 15. The gauge lost
0.7 percent yesterday, the steepest loss since June 18. Monsoon
rains, the main source of irrigation for India’s 235 million
farmers, may cover the entire country in 24 hours, sooner than
the usual July 15 date, the weather office said. Bumper crops
stoke demand for vehicles,  consumer goods  and appliances.  “Investors sought bargains after yesterday’s declines,”
Jitendra Panda, head of sales broking at Mumbai-based Future
Capital Holdings Ltd., said by phone. “The news on the monsoon
too helped lift sentiment.”  Stocks also rose as euro-area finance chiefs made progress
on finalizing Spain’s bailout. European governments will  jump-
start  as much as 100 billion euros in loans to shore up Spain’s
banks, Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  said in
Brussels. The region is India’s largest trading partner.  European stocks  gained for the first time in a week, with
the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  climbing 1.1 percent.  The 30-stock Sensex has climbed 14 percent this year and is
valued at 13.8 times estimated  profits , compared with 10.2 times
for the  MSCI Emerging Markets Index. (MXEF)   ‘Better Story’  Sensex earnings, excluding those of  oil companies , likely
grew 12 percent from a year ago in the June quarter, compared
with 7 percent in the March quarter, according to Citigroup Inc.
 Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS)  and  Infosys Ltd. (INFO) , India’s biggest
software exporters, release results on July 12 to start the
results season, followed by  HDFC Bank Ltd. (HDFCB)  the next day.  “While the GDP outlook continues to look more down than
up, earnings are turning out to be a better story, albeit only
slightly,” Citigroup analysts Aditya Narain and Jitender Tokas
said in a note dated yesterday. “First-quarter Sensex (ex-oil)
earnings growth should be 12 percent.”  Profit for 30 percent of Sensex companies missed estimates
in the March quarter, compared with 47 percent in the period to
December, as growth in Asia’s third-largest  economy  slowed to a
near-decade low and Europe’s debt crisis crimped exports.  Auto Stocks  Tata Motors climbed for a fourth day, gaining 2.4 percent
to 246.50 rupees, its highest level since June 26.  Maruti Suzuki
India Ltd. (MSIL) , the country’s largest carmaker, jumped 2.8 percent
to 1,220.55 rupees and motorcycle-maker  Hero MotoCorp Ltd. (HMCL) 
gained 1.9 percent to 2,064.75 rupees.  ITC jumped 2.7 percent to 258.40 rupees. Larsen & Toubro
advanced 2 percent to 1,417 rupees, the most since June 29.
Tamco Switchgear, its Malaysian unit, bought Henikwon Corp., a
busduct-systems maker, according to an exchange filing today.  HDFC Bank Ltd., India’s second-largest private lender,
rallied 1.8 percent to a record 588.65 rupees.  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) ,
the largest private lender, gained 1.4 percent to 942.9 rupees.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. advised investors to stay invested in
Indian banks’ stocks. The “strong” momentum will sustain in
the second half of calendar year 2012, the brokerage said.  India VIX, which measures the cost of protection against
losses in the S&P CNX Nifty Index, slid 4.8 percent to 17.83.
The Nifty added 1.3 percent to 5,345.35, while its July futures
settled at 5,358.15. The  BSE-200 Index (BSE200)  climbed 1.3 percent to
2,168.84. Combined trading volume on India’s top two exchanges
was 842.8 million shares yesterday, compared with a 12-month
daily average of 903.8 million.  Overseas  investors  bought a net $59.9 million of Indian
stocks yesterday, taking their investment this year to $9.6
billion, according to the Securities & Exchange Board of India,
the market regulator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
