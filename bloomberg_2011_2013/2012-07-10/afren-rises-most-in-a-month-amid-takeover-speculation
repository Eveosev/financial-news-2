Afren Plc (AFR) , a U.K.-based oil and gas
company focused on Nigeria and Iraq, rose the most in a month in
London trading on speculation it may get a takeover offer.  Afren jumped 9.1 percent to close at 114.3 pence. That’s
the biggest one-day gain since June 6 and the most among
companies on the FTSE All-Share Index. The stock has risen 33
percent this year, valuing the company at 1.2 billion pounds
($1.9 billion).  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  and  Eni SpA (ENI)  are examining possible bids
for Afren, the U.K.’s  Daily Mail  said yesterday. Either one
could offer at least 200 pence a share, the newspaper reported,
without saying where it got the information.  Afren could be a potential target,  Andrew Whittock , a
London-based analyst at Liberum Capital Ltd., said by phone.
Some companies may be put off by the operating environment in
Nigeria and Iraq, where Afren is operating in the northern
Kurdistan region, he said.  An official at Eni, who asked not to be identified citing
company policy, declined to comment. Patrick McGinn, a spokesman
for Exxon, also declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
