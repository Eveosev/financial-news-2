Spain’s jobless rate will continue
to rise to include more than a quarter of the workforce before
it peaks early next year, the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development said.  The  unemployment rate  will climb to 25.4 percent in the
first quarter of 2013 from 24.6 percent in May, the Paris-based
OECD said today in a report. Joblessness will begin to decline
in the second half of next year as the economy starts to
recover, it said.  The OECD urged its 34  member states  to do more to combat
unemployment in the face of a slowing world economy and
recessions in European countries including Spain and Italy. The
jobless rate in the euro area reached 11.1 percent in May and
will probably stay there until the end of 2013, the OECD said.  “The recent deterioration in the economic outlook is very
bad news for the labor market,” OECD Secretary-General  Angel Gurria  said in a statement. “It is imperative that governments
use every possible means at their disposal to help job seekers,
especially young people, by removing barriers to  job creation 
and investing in their education and skills.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
