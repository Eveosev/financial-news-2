OAO RusHydro rose to a three-week
high after President  Vladimir Putin  said Russia’s largest
hydropower company is undervalued and the state won’t sell its
stake at the current price.  The stock advanced 4 percent to 86.07 kopeks by the close
in Moscow, the strongest level since June 18. RusHydro is down
11 percent this year, compared with a 1.5 percent rise for the
Micex Index. The company’s London-traded shares were up 4.1
percent at $2.567.  Putin’s “comments about RusHydro being undervalued remove
the near-term risk of stock overhang,”  Bruce Bower , a partner
at Moscow-based hedge fund Verno, which manages more than $200
million in Russian equities, said by e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
