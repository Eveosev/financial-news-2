Jack Dorsey, chief executive of
mobile-payments startup Square Inc., said the company will
expand and make its device available outside the U.S.  Dorsey, one of the founders of Twitter Inc., was invited to
speak on a panel about innovation at the Allen & Co. media
conference in  Sun Valley , Idaho.  “I don’t know what I’ll be talking about exactly,” he
told reporters as he unpacked his bags from his rental car as he
arrived at the Sun Valley Resort yesterday.  “We’re having a lot of fun,” at Square, he said. “We
just keep building, and we’re excited because we’re going
outside the U.S. soon.”  Square, based in San Francisco, is a maker of credit-card
readers for tablets and smartphones and charges a fee of 2.75
percent on every transaction. The company has received funding
from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers,  Sequoia Capital  and
Khosla Ventures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
