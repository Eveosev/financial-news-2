Gasoline weakened in the  Gulf of
Mexico , the U.S. refining hub, on speculation that inventories
of the fuel rose for a fourth week.  Gasoline stockpiles probably gained 500,000 barrels last
week, according to a  median estimate  of 10 analysts in a survey
by Bloomberg. Total U.S. inventories of the motor fuel increased
to 205 million barrels for the week ended June 29, the Energy
Department reported.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
 Gulf Coast  widened 2.75 cents to 16.63 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 12:29
p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery
fell 2.66 cents to $2.5941 a gallon.  Exxon Mobil Corp. expected some impact to production at its
Beaumont refinery in Texas after emissions, the company said in
a filing with the state.  Flint Hills Resources LLC flared gases from its Corpus
Christi West refinery in Texas because of equipment failure,
according to a  filing  with the National Response Center.  The differential for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in
New York Harbor weakened 0.25 cent to a discount of 1.5 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
