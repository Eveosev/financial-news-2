Ethanol futures fell the most in
three weeks as lower corn prices reduced costs for distillers.  Futures dropped on speculation that a 13 percent gain in
corn prices this month eroded demand for the grain. Ethanol is
made from corn in the U.S. and producers have responded to the
more expensive feedstock costs by tempering output 11 percent
this year.  “They’re tracking each other,” said Will Babler, a broker
at First Capitol Risk Management Inc. in Galena,  Illinois .
“You’re starting to have rationalization by end-users here.
Everyone on the demand side has been squeezed pretty hard.”  Denatured ethanol for August delivery slipped 3.6 cents, or
1.4 percent, to $2.468 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the steepest decline since June 21. Prices have increased 12
percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in  New York 
at $2.58 a gallon and in Chicago the additive dropped 2 cents,
or 0.8 percent, to $2.46, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf sank 1.5 cents, or 0.6 percent, to
$2.525 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel added 1 cent,
or 0.4 percent, to $2.67.  Corn for December delivery slid 12.5 cents, or 1.7 percent,
to $7.175 a bushel in  Chicago .  To contact the reporter on this story:
