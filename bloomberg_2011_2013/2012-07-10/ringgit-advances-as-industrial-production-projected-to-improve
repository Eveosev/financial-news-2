Malaysia’s ringgit strengthened for
the first time in five days ahead of government data forecast to
show factory output rose in May.  Industrial production  gained 4.6 percent from a year
earlier after increasing 3.2 percent in April, according to the
median forecast of 12 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
before official figures due tomorrow. Domestic demand will
continue to support Malaysia’s economy due to stable employment
conditions and income growth, the central bank said after its
policy meeting on July 5.  Bank Negara Malaysia  left its
benchmark interest rate at 3 percent at the review.  “Malaysian fundamentals are reasonably solid,” said
 Thomas Harr , the Singapore-based head of Asian foreign-exchange
strategy at Standard Chartered Plc. “But obviously there are a
lot of concerns about the global slowdown.  The ringgit advanced 0.2 percent to 3.1820 per dollar as of
9:23 a.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-
rate swings used to price options, held at 6.80 percent.  Government bonds  were little changed. The yield on the
3.704 percent Islamic notes due September 2019 held at 3.45
percent, according to Bursa Malaysia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
