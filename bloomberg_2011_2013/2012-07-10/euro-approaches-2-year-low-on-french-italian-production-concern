The euro declined to within 0.4
percent of its lowest level in two years versus the dollar as
industrial production shrank in France and was forecast to fall
in Italy as Europe’s debt crisis undermined growth.  Europe’s 17-nation currency weakened most against the yen
among its 16 major peers after European Union Economic and
Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said Spain will soon
have to take additional measures soon to meet budget targets.
The dollar strengthened versus most of its most traded
counterparts as Asian stocks declined.  Australia  and New
Zealand’s currencies dropped after data showed growth in exports
and imports slowed in China.  “The euro is going to stay quite weak, particularly
against the  U.S. dollar  and the yen,” said  Joseph Capurso , a
strategist in Sydney at  Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) , the
nation’s biggest lender. “The euro zone is still in recession
and it’s probably getting even deeper.”  The euro lost 0.1 percent to $1.2297 at 8:15 a.m. London
time after sliding to as low as $1.2251 yesterday, the weakest
since July 2010. The shared currency fell 0.3 percent to 97.62
yen. It touched 97.43 yesterday, the least since June 5.  French output fell 1.9 percent from a month earlier, Insee,
the Paris-based statistics office, said today. April’s
production increase was revised down to 1.4 percent. Economists
had forecast a decline of 1 percent in May, according to the
median estimate of 21 forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey.  The dollar slid 0.2 percent to 79.40 yen. The so-called
Aussie dropped 0.2 percent to $1.0187, while the  New Zealand 
currency weakened 0.2 percent to 79.46 U.S. cents.  To contact the reporters on this story:
