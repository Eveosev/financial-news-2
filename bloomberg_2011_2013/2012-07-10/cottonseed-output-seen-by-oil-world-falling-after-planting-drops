World production of cottonseed, used
to make cooking oil and as a supplement in livestock feed, may
drop to a three-year low on smaller plantings, Oil World said.  Global  cottonseed  output may be 43 million metric tons, or
600,000 tons less than estimated last month and 3.9 million tons
lower than the previous season, the Hamburg-based researcher
said today in an e-mailed report. Cotton futures were down 37
percent from a year ago by yesterday on ICE Futures U.S. in  New
York . Lower prices encouraged farmers in North and South
America,  Africa  and  Asia  to cut plantings in favor of other
crops, Oil World said. In the U.S., acreage fell 14 percent.  “Smaller supplies are expected to enforce a decline of
world cottonseed crushings in the vicinity of 2.5 million tons
in October-September 2012-13,” Oil World said. “This will
reduce production of cotton oil and meal correspondingly,
aggravating the supply shortage stemming from the likely decline
of global soybean crushings anticipated for the remainder of
2012.”  Rallies in oilseed prices including soybeans, which
surged 16 percent since the start of June by yesterday on dry
U.S. weather, may increase demand for cottonseed, Oil World
said. World cottonseed exports may rise to 1.14 million tons in
2012-13, up 3 percent from a year earlier and nearly double the
size of shipments three years before, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
