Morocco ’s combined production of
soft wheat, durum wheat and barley fell 39 percent in the 2011-
12 crop year after dry weather hurt yields, the Agriculture and
Fisheries Ministry reported.  The harvest of the country’s three main grains slid to 5.1
million metric tons after a lack of rain in February and March,
the ministry wrote in an  online report  yesterday. Average yields
dropped 38 percent to 1.01 tons a hectare (2.47 acres).  Morocco is North Africa’s third-biggest wheat importer
behind Algeria and  Egypt . The country is a net buyer of grain
even in good years, and the poor harvest means cereal imports
will probably increase, according to the  United Nations ’ Food &
Agriculture Organization.  “The low temperatures that characterized the months of
February and March nonetheless contributed favorably to
attenuating the negative effects of the lack of rains,” the
ministry wrote.  Weather conditions that improved at the end of March and in
April, with cumulative rainfall of 62 millimeters (2.4 inches),
had a “very beneficial” effect on production and grain
quality, according to the ministry.  Soft-wheat production was 2.74 million tons, the durum-
wheat harvest amounted to 1.13 million tons and farmers reaped
1.2 million tons of barley, the ministry wrote. The FAO in May
had forecast the wheat crop would fall to 2.7 million tons and
barley output to 900,000 tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
