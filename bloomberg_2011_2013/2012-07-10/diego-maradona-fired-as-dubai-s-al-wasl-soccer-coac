Diego Maradona , who led Argentina to
the 1986 World Cup title as a player, was dismissed as manager of 
Al Wasl soccer club in Dubai.  “Diego Maradona and his coaching team have been fired,”
Al Wasl reported today on its Twitter account, without providing
further details. Maradona had signed a two-year contract with
the Dubai club when he was hired in May 2011.  Maradona, 51, led Al Wasl to the eighth position in the 12-
team  2011-2012  Etisalat Pro-League, with eight losses and 10
wins. It was the Argentine’s longest tenure as a club coach.  Maradona went to Dubai after his contract wasn’t renewed to
manage Argentina in July 2010, after the national team was
knocked out of the  World Cup  on a 4-0 defeat to  Germany  in the
quarterfinals.  He was captain of Argentina’s team in 1986 when the South
American country beat West Germany 3-2 in the World Cup final.
Maradona was voted player of the century in 2000 in a poll
organized by soccer governing body FIFA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
