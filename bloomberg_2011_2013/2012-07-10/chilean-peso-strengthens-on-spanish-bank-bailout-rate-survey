Chilean inflation-linked bond yields
increased to a three-year high after a report showed last week
that consumer prices unexpectedly fell in June.  The yield on  two-year  inflation-linked bonds rose 13 basis
points, or 0.13 percentage point, to 2.91 percent. The one-year
swap rate in unidades de fomento, the Andean country’s
inflation-linked accounting unit also known as UF, advanced to
2.79 percent. Both levels were the highest on a closing basis
since February 2009. Consumer prices fell 0.3 percent in June,
confounding economists whose median estimate was for a 0.1
percent advance in prices.  “Clearly no one wants UF,” said Felipe Alarcon, an
economist at  Banco de Credito e Inversiones (BCI)  in Santiago.
“‘There’s a lot of selling, but the inflation being priced in
is very unlikely. If I were a buy-and-hold investor, I would buy
UF deposits right this minute. It’s a sure thing.”  Chile’s peso appreciated 0.3 percent to 493.06 per  U.S.
dollar . Its 1.1 percent gain over the past two days is the most
among six major Latin American currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
