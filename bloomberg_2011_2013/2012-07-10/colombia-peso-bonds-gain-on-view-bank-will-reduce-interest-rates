Colombia ’s peso bonds rose, pushing
yields to a record low, after central bank chief Jose Dario Uribe said policy makers will probably reduce their forecast for
the country’s 2012 growth.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent peso-denominated debt
due in 2024 fell four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to
6.91 percent, according to the central bank. That is the lowest
level on a closing basis since the securities were first issued
in 2009. The bond’s price rose 0.341 centavo to 124.671 centavos
per peso.  Colombia’s central bank will probably reduce its forecast
for the economy’s expansion from the current range of 4 percent
to 6 percent, Uribe said in a July 6 interview, without saying
what the new projection will be. The outlook for slower growth
signals policy makers are more likely to reduce the benchmark
 interest rate , said Daniel Velandia, the head analyst at the
Correval SA brokerage in Bogota.  “People are pricing in greater chances of a cut this
year,” Velandia said in a phone interview. “Some are even
starting to bet on two cuts.”  The central bank held the  overnight lending rate  at 5.25
percent for a fourth straight month on June 29 as growth cooled
and prices of the country’s commodity exports dropped.
Government reports in June showed industrial output and retail
sales unexpectedly fell in April and the economy expanded 4.7
percent in the first quarter, the slowest pace since 2010.  Reports on industrial output and retail sales in May,
scheduled to be released July 19, “will be key in providing a
clearer picture of the likelihood of rate cuts,” Velandia said.  Colombia’s peso rose from a one-week low as concern over
 Europe ’s debt crisis eased after the region’s finance ministers
took steps to protect Spanish banks.  The peso appreciated 0.1 percent to 1,786.88 per dollar
after touching 1,794.25 yesterday, the weakest since June 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
