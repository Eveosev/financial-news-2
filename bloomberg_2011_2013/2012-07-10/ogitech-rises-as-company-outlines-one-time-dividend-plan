Logitech International SA (LOGN)  surged the
most in eight weeks in Zurich trading after the world’s biggest
maker of computer mice outlined plans for a one-time dividend,
the first payment to shareholders since 1996.  Investors will be asked at the annual shareholders meeting
Sept. 5 to approve a dividend of 81 centimes a share, Morges,
Switzerland-based Logitech said in a  statement  yesterday. The
shares rose as much as 6.2 percent to 10.30 francs, the biggest
intraday gain since May 16, and were up 4 percent as of 11:06
a.m., valuing the company at 1.93 billion francs ($2 billion).  The manufacturer cut jobs to save about $80 million a year
and revamped its sales organization to simplify and speed up
product development and revive revenue growth. The proliferation
of tablet computers that don’t need mice has eroded the
traditional desktop and notebook business of Logitech, which
hasn’t been able to exceed the sales  record  set in 2008.  “We determined that we could best reward our shareholders
by taking advantage of our strong cash position to offer a one-
time distribution that is not subject to Swiss withholding tax
for any of our shareholders,” Chief Executive Officer Guerrino De Luca said in the statement. The payment is supposed to make
up for Logitech’s “poor financial performance” in the 12
months through March.  The stock has  risen  38 percent this year, beating a 4.2
percent gain for the Swiss Market Index. Logitech stock slumped
59 percent in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
