The euro stayed weaker against the
dollar and the yen after a report showed French industrial
output dropped in May.  The 17-member currency fell 0.2 percent to $1.2292 as of
7:46 a.m. London time and declined 0.3 percent to 97.63 yen.  Output fell 1.9 percent from a month earlier, Paris-based
statistics office Insee said today. Aprilâ€™s production increase
was revised down to 1.4 percent. Economists had forecast a
decline of 1 percent in May, according to the median of 21
estimates gathered by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
