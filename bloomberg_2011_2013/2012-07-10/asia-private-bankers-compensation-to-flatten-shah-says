Asian private bankers’ compensation
will level off as firms begin to recognize that the costs don’t
“make economic sense,” according to  Citigroup Inc. (C) , the
second-largest private bank by assets in the region.  “In the last five years, there’s been a tendency for new
entrants to pay over the top” to hire bankers, Akbar Shah, head
of Southeast  Asia  and  Australia  for New York-based Citigroup’s
private banking unit, said in an interview in  Singapore . “That
will stabilize. In Asia, it will flatten and I don’t see it
going the way it has.”  Competition to hire bankers has escalated along with the
demand for private banking services in a region which last year
surpassed North America as home to the most millionaires. That
pushed costs as a percentage of income in Asia, excluding  Japan ,
to as much as 80 percent last year, compared with 65 percent for
European firms,  Boston Consulting Group  said in June.  Directors and managing directors in Singapore last year
were paid salaries of as much as S$400,000 ($316,000) on
average, excluding bonuses, with sign-on bonuses being
“multiples” of that, Shah said. Vice presidents and assistant
vice presidents made about S$130,000 while junior bankers were
paid S$100,000, he said, commenting on data provided by London-
based recruitment firm  EMA Partners International .  Senior bankers in Singapore earn S$200,000 to S$500,000,
EMA estimated in July 2011. Mid-level bankers get paid S$100,000
to S$160,000, and junior-level staff earn S$70,000 to S$100,000,
the firm said at that time.  Salaries Outlook  Those salaries probably won’t decline, especially for
senior bankers, as the region’s wealth grows and the banks try
to attract staff, Shah said.  Senior private bankers in Asia are also paid as much as
three times their annual salaries in bonuses if they
“deliver,” Shah said. That compares with about three or four
months of pay in Switzerland, which, according to BCG estimates,
is the world’s largest offshore wealth management center with
$2.1 trillion in assets.  Asia-Pacific millionaires outnumbered those in  North
America  for the first time last year, according to a report in
June from Capgemini SA and Royal Bank of Canada’s wealth
management unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
