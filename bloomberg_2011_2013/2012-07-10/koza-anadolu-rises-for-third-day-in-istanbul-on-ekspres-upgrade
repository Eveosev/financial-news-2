  Koza Anadolu Metal Madencilik
Isletmeleri AS (KOZAA) , a Turkish miner, rose for a third day after
Ekspres Invest put the company on its recommended stocks list,
saying new projects offer high growth potential.  The shares climbed 2.7 percent to 3.86 liras at 10:10 a.m.
in Istanbul, the biggest jump on a closing basis since June 29.
Istanbul-based brokerage Ekspres added Koza to its “long ideas
list” while cutting  Bizim Toptan Satis Magazalari AS (BIZIM) , a
discount retailer, according to an e-mailed report today.  Koza Anadolu will benefit from “the exploration of new
copper minerals through two new projects, which will diversify
the holding portfolio with well-positioned and high-growth
promising mining assets,” Ekspres said.  The 12-month price estimate for the share is 5.12 liras,
according to Ekspres.  To contact the reporter on this story:
