Yields on benchmark 10-year Treasury
notes may drop as low as 1.25 percent if the  Federal Reserve  is
slow to provide more stimulus as the  U.S. economy  weakens,
according to Bank of America Corp.’s Priya Misra.  “Markets are obsessed with QE3 right now. They expect QE3
the next bad data print. Everyone expects the Fed to jump in.
What if the Fed wants to wait?” Misra, head of U.S. rates
strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said on Bloomberg
Television’s “Surveillance” in an interview with  Tom Keene .
“If we continue to get weak data and the Fed doesn’t jump in
right away, that is when markets panic.”  The Fed bought $2.3 trillion of securities in two rounds of
so-called quantitative easing, known as QE1 and QE2, from 2008
to 2011 to support the economy. In September it embarked on a
plan to replace $400 billion of short-maturity Treasuries in its
portfolio with longer-term debt to cap borrowing costs. It
expanded the effort, known as Operation Twist, on June 20 by
$267 billion and extended it until year-end.  Some investors are speculating the central bank, which has
said it will hold the rate low through at least late 2014, will
consider a change in its so-called forward guidance and more
debt purchases after employment growth was less-than-forecast in
June for a fourth consecutive month.  “The Fed is telling us they don’t expect to hike rates
until late 2014. I suspect they will move to 2015, potentially
in the August policy meeting,” said New York-based Misra, who
predicts that the 10-year note will yield between 1.75 percent
and 2 percent a year from now.  ‘Aftermath of 2008’  Ten-year note yields fell to a record low of 1.4387 percent
on June 1 amid concern  Europe ’s two-year debt crisis is
worsening and U.S. employment growth is slowing. The yield on
the security was little changed at 1.51 percent at 10:38 a.m.
 New York  time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices.  “We are still dealing with the aftermath of 2008, when the
markets broke down and needed immediate short term relief,”
said Misra of Bank of America Merrill Lynch, one of the 21
primary dealers that trade with the Fed. “Now we are dealing
with these longer-term structural problems.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
