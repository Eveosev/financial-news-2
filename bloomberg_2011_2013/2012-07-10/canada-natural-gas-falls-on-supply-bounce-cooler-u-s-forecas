Canadian natural gas fell as
supplies increased and U.S. weather moderated, signaling less
demand for fuel to run air conditioners.  August gas in  Alberta  declined 2.7 percent as Canadian
 inventories  for the week ended June 29 grew by 9.26 billion
cubic feet to 599.5 billion, according to Canadian Enerdata Ltd.
MDA EarthSat Weather of Gaithersburg, Maryland, predicted
temperatures would decrease in the U.S. Midwest and Northeast in
the second half of the month.  “We’ve had some of the weather moderate over the last few
days out east,”  Martin King , an analyst with FirstEnergy
Capital Corp., in Calgary, said in a telephone interview.
“We’ve had a little bit of a supply bounce-back in Alberta.”  Alberta gas for August delivery decreased 6.25 cents to
C$2.225 per gigajoule ($2.09 per million British thermal units)
as of 1:15 p.m.  New York  time on NGX, a Canadian Internet
market. Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada 
and the U.S. and priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.  Alberta gas has fallen 14 percent this year, from C$2.58 on
Dec. 31, and risen 37 percent from C$1.625 at the end of March.  Natural gas for August delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  slid 11.1 cents, or 3.9 percent, to $2.772 per million
Btu at 1:22 p.m.  Cooler Weather  The high in Chicago on July 21 may be 74 degrees
Fahrenheit, 10 below normal, according to AccuWeather Inc. in
 State College ,  Pennsylvania . A day earlier, New York may reach
83, 1 less than usual.  “Extremes appear to be less of a threat by this period
given the increase in variability,” MDA said in a forecast
today for July 20-24. “The South remains near normal.”  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta system , which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.4 billion cubic
feet at 1 p.m. New York time.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 1.9 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 1.99 billion cubic feet.  The available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia
system at  Kingsgate  was 687 million cubic feet. The system was
forecast to carry 1.93 billion cubic feet today, or 74 percent
of normal capacity of 2.62 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.73
billion cubic feet at 12:05 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
