India ’s 10-year  bonds  advanced for a
third day on speculation the central bank will ease monetary
policy to arrest an economic slowdown.  A government report this week will show  industrial  output
rose 1.8 percent in May from a year earlier, compared with an
average gain of 2.6 percent in the previous 12 months, according
to a Bloomberg survey of economists. The  Reserve Bank  of India
cut its  repurchase rate  by 50 basis points to 8 percent in
April, after raising it by a record 375 basis points through
2010 and 2011 to curb inflation. The monetary authority will
review its policy next on July 31.  “Yields will have a tendency to drop from here given the
weak economic outlook,” said  Anoop Verma , a fixed-income trader
at Development Credit Bank in Mumbai.  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 fell one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.14 percent as of
9:50 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. That’s the lowest level since June 28.  Central bank Governor Duvvuri Subbarao kept the repo  rate 
unchanged at 8 percent at a meeting on June 18.  One-year  interest-rate swaps , or derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, were little
changed at 7.76 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
