Italian industrial  output 
unexpectedly rose in May.  Production gained 0.8 percent from April, when it dropped
1.9 percent, national statistics office  Istat  said in  Rome 
today. Economists forecast a decline of 0.6 percent, according
to the median of 20 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.
Production fell 6.9 percent from a year ago on a workday-
adjusted basis.  The economy entered its fourth recession since 2001 in the
fourth quarter and will likely contract 2.4 percent in 2012,
employer’ lobby  Confindustria  said last month. Prime Minister
 Mario Monti  is implementing austerity measures passed last
December aimed at containing the country’s financing cost and
public debt,  Europe ’s second-biggest. His Cabinet also approved
last week 26 billion euros ($32 billion) of spending cuts over
the next three years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
