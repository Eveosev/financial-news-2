The Scottish Green Party may come
out in favor of putting a single “yes” or “no” question in
the independence referendum planned for the fall of 2014, the
 Scotsman  reported, citing Patrick Harvie, the party’s co-leader.  The idea of giving people the option of voting for greater
tax-raising powers for the Scottish parliament, while keeping
the country in the U.K., lacks clarity and political momentum,
Harvie told the newspaper.  A poll yesterday showed a 20 percentage-point lead for
voters wanting to stay in the U.K. over those who want to leave.
More supported unspecified additional powers for the Scottish
parliament than leaving things unchanged or quitting the U.K.  To contact the reporter on this story:
