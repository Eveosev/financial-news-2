Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  should be
barred from drilling in Alaska’s Beaufort Sea and the  Gulf of
Mexico  because its oil-spill plans are inadequate, Greenpeace
Inc. and other environmental groups said in a lawsuit.  The groups sued the U.S. Interior Department, which
approved Shell’s spill-response plans earlier this year, saying
the agency violated the  Clean Water Act  by failing to ensure the
plans can address a “worst case oil spill.”  The approvals for Shell’s response plans for the Gulf of
Mexico’s Chukchi Sea and Alaska’s Beaufort Sea should be thrown
out, and offshore oil and gas activity blocked, until the
Interior Department complies with the law, the groups said in a
complaint filed today in federal court in Alaska. The filing
couldn’t be confirmed in electronic court records.  Curtis Smith , a spokesman for Shell, said the company is
confident the approved spill plans “will withstand legal
review.”  “If regulators did not have confidence in every aspect of
our oil spill response plans, we would not have the permits that
we do and we would not be as close to drilling as we are,” he
said.  Adam Fetcher, an Interior Department spokesman, declined to
comment on the lawsuit. A call to Shell’s media line wasn’t
immediately returned.  The case is Alaska Wilderness League v. Salazar, U.S.
District Court, District of Alaska.  To contact the reporter on this story:
