Wage increases for Belgian employees
should be more firmly linked to productivity and not driven by
“inflexible” indexing,  Olli Rehn , the European Union’s
economic and monetary affairs chief, said in an article
published in  L’Echo .  The European Commission, the 27-nation EU’s executive arm,
has “confirmed the importance of seeing to it that salary
increases better reflect work productivity and
competitiveness,” Rehn said in the article published today.  The commission is not opposed to salary indexing in
principle, Rehn said. “However, if the indexing method remains
inflexible, that will represent a danger for cost-
competitiveness,” he told L’Echo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
