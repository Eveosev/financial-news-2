Rolls-Royce Plc (RR/)  plans an upgrade to
the Trent 1000 engine used on  Boeing Co. (BA) ’s 787 Dreamliner that
would cut fuel consumption and power a future stretched version
of the plane.  The Trent 1000-TEN, for thrust efficiency new technology,
will deliver 3 percent better fuel burn than the current model,
Robert Nuttall, vice president of strategic marketing, said
today at a briefing at the Farnborough air show outside London.
The Trent 1000-TEN would be fielded in 2016, he said.  The engine would be available for the 787-8 variant of the
Dreamliner and the 787-9 that’s now under development, along
with the longer 787-10 that Boeing is studying. London-based
Rolls-Royce and Boeing signed a memorandum of understanding last
month to use the Trent 1000-TEN on the 787-10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
