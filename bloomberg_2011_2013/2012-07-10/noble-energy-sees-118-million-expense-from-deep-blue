Noble Energy Inc. (NBL) , the U.S. oil and
natural-gas producer with operations from Colorado to the
 Mediterranean Sea , will record a $118 million exploration
expense in the second quarter related to its Deep Blue prospect
in the  Gulf of Mexico .  The expense comes after Noble and its partners decided to
suspend appraisal work at the prospect, the Houston-based
company said in a statement today. Some hydrocarbons were found
in initial exploration and in later activity, Noble said.  The company’s deep-water Gulf of Mexico output has climbed
to about 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, the company
said. Oil comprises more than 80 percent of that. Three wells at
the Galapagos project in the deep-water Gulf are producing at
rates higher than in an earlier forecast, according to today’s
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
