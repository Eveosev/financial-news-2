Serbia must approve a program by the
end of the third quarter to stave off bankruptcy amid a record-
high  budget deficit , Finance Minister-Designate Mladjan Dinkic
said.  The Balkan nation’s fiscal position is “very difficult”
and the government needs to embark on fiscal consolidation, draw
up anti-crisis measures to safeguard liquidity and investment
and speak with international lenders, Dinkic told reporters
today in the capital, Belgrade.  Serbia has been struggling to dodge a new recession and
attract outside investment after inconclusive elections May 6
triggered a two-month stalemate over the make-up of a coalition
government. The country may need to ask the  International
Monetary Fund  to allow it to reschedule or write off debts,
Stojan Stamenkovic, the chief economist at the state Economics
Institute, said today.  “We need to prepare a program which will enable Serbia to
avoid the situation of bankruptcy,” Dinkic said. “We will
certainly adopt the program before the end of September and talk
with the IMF and the  World Bank  but we’ll try to work out
measures on our own.”  Three Serbian political groups signed a pact today that
paves the way for a new coalition government to take office
later this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
