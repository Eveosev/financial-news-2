Tanzania’s  National Social Security
Fund  said its assets will expand 29 percent in the 12 months
through June 2013 as investments surge.  The state-run fund will grow to 2.2 trillion Tanzanian
shillings ($1.3 billion) from 1.7 trillion shillings a year
earlier “due to increasing contributions from members and
investment income,” Director of Finance Ludovick Mrosso said in
an interview today in  Dar es Salaam , Tanzania’s commercial
capital.  The fund, the biggest in the country, had 550,000 members
as of March and the number may have risen to 600,000 by June,
Mrosso said.  Investments, which include a power plant and a bridge, will
rise to 2.85 trillion shillings from 1.6 trillion shillings, he
said. Investment income is expected to climb 52 percent to 147.6
billion shillings, while annual contributions are seen rising 23
percent to 594.1 billion shillings, he said.  The fund has called for bids to develop a 200-megawatt
power plant in Mkuranga, 21 miles south of Dar es Salaam, which
will supply the capital.  “We expect to procure a consultant for the project by
August,” Mrosso said. The plant will use natural gas from
Mtwara, 228 miles south of Dar es Salaam, once the offshore
terminus there is operational, he said.  The China Railway Construction Engineering Group and China
Major Bridge Engineering Co. are jointly building a bridge that
will cost 214 billion shillings. When completed it will link Dar
es Salaam to Kigamboni island east of the city.  To contact the reporter on this story:
