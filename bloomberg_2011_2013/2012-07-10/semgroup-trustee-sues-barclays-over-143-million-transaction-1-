A trustee representing the creditors
of  SemGroup Corp. (SEMG)  sued  Barclays Plc (BARC)  over a $143 million deal to
offload the oil and natural gas pipeline company’s commodities
trading positions the month before it filed for bankruptcy in
July 2008.  SemGroup, which lost $2.4 billion shorting oil as prices
rose in 2007 and 2008, emerged from bankruptcy in November 2009,
according to a complaint filed yesterday in Manhattan federal
court.  The trustee, Bettina Whyte, is seeking a return of the
$143 million SemGroup paid Barclays to take over its trading
book on the New York Mercantile Exchange. She claims Barclays
forced a “huge and unjustified” fee on SemGroup, with no
benefit to the company or its creditors.  “Under the circumstances, the size of the fee was
unconscionable and SemGroup did not receive reasonably
equivalent value,” Whyte claimed in the complaint.  Mark Lane , a spokesman for Barclays in New York, said he
hadn’t seen the complaint and had no immediate comment.  The case is Whyte v. Barclays Bank Plc, 12-CV-5318, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
