Britain’s  economy  shrank for a third
quarter in the three months through June as a recession
deepened, according to the National Institute of Economic and
Social Research, which said an extra holiday skewed the data.  Gross domestic product fell 0.2 percent from the first
quarter, Niesr, whose clients include the  Bank of England  and
the U.K. Treasury, said in a statement in London today. The data
are “distorted” by the additional public holiday in June for
the queen’s Diamond Jubilee and underling growth “was more
robust than these headline estimates suggest,” it said.  Bank of England Governor  Mervyn King  said in a BBC
interview broadcast today that he’s worried about the outlook
for U.K. exports and the economy “doesn’t show a great deal of
signs of impending recovery.” The central bank increased its
 bond-purchase target  by 50 billion pounds ($78 billion) to 375
billion pounds last week to help revive the economy.  Underlying growth for the three months to June was around
0.2 percent, Niesr said, adding that these figures “suggest
that the U.K. economy remains broadly flat.” GDP fell 0.3
percent in the first quarter of 2012 after a 0.4 percent drop in
the final three months of 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
