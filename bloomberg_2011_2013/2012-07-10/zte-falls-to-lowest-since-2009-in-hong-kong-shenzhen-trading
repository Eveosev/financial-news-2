ZTE Corp. (000063) , China’s second-biggest
maker of telecommunications equipment, tumbled to the lowest
level since March 2009 in Hong Kong and Shenzhen trading.  China is said to plan retaliation if the European Union
investigates government subsidies to ZTE and Huawei Technologies
Co., the Financial Times reported yesterday, citing a person
briefed on the meeting. Both companies have denied receiving any
improper subsidies, the FT reported.  “ZTE has sales exposure in the EU,” Leping Huang, analyst
at Nomura International Hong Kong Ltd., said in a telephone
interview. “All major stakeholders including Ericsson
and Nokia don’t want the EU to go through with this. No one
benefits.”  ZTE slid for a second day, losing 5.9 percent to 13  yuan  at
11:18 a.m. local time in Shenzhen, while the Hong Kong-traded
shares fell 7.2 percent to HK$13.12.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
