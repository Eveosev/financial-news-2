The euro fell against the yen as
reports showed industrial output shrank in France and exports
and imports growth slowed in China, adding to concern Europe
will struggle to avoid a recession.  Europe’s 17-member currency was within 0.5 percent of its
lowest level in two years versus the dollar. It weakened against
most of its 16 major peers after European Union Economic and
Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said  Spain  will soon
have to take additional measures soon to meet budget targets.  “It essentially boils down to growth,” said  Derek Halpenny , European head of global markets research at Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in London. “When you look at the
Chinese data today it’s looking like the whole slowdown story
could be spreading into the third quarter. My fear now is that
we see confidence ebb away.”  The euro fell 0.3 percent to 97.66 yen at 9:54 a.m. London
time. It touched 97.43 yesterday, the least since June 5. The
shared currency was little changed at $1.2316 after sliding to
$1.2251 yesterday, the weakest since July 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
