Muenchener Rueckversicherungs AG (MUV2)  is
studying lending directly to companies to access new sources of
revenue, Financial Times Deutschland reported, citing an
interview with Chief Financial Officer Joerg Schneider.  The re-insurer faces conflicting demands from regulators
and rating companies demanding conservative investments, while
clients of the company’s life insurance unit are entitled to a
guaranteed interest of 3.4 percent that’s hard to earn in the
current low interest-rate environment, FTD said.  Munich Re  wouldn’t need a banking license, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
