China ’s southern  Guangdong province 
discharged billions of tons of raw sewage last year into the
 Pearl River Delta  that supplies  Hong Kong  and Macau, the China
Daily newspaper reported today.  About 9.5 billion tons of raw sewage, or three-fourths of
Guangdong’s output, flowed untreated into local rivers, the
newspaper said, citing findings published by the province’s
Department of Water Resources. More than half of that amount
went into the Pearl River Delta, it said.  The report said that 30 percent of rivers in eastern
Guangdong are polluted, threatening the health of people who
live along their banks. Guangdong, with a population of 104
million people, has China’s largest economy and is one of the
world’s biggest manufacturing centers.  Environmental contamination has fueled social unrest in
China as three decades of growth transformed the nation into the
world’s second-biggest economy and its largest polluter.
President  Hu Jintao  and other senior officials have repeatedly
pledged to reduce pollution.  Officials in southern China said last week that the city of
Shifang stopped construction of a copper plant after protesters
fearful of its potential impact on the environment clashed with
police. Twelve industrial plants in the country’s east were
temporarily closed after more than 12 children were found to
have high levels of lead in their blood, the state-run Xinhua
News Agency reported July 8.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
