Hungarian commercial banks cut 537
jobs in the first six months of the year, boosting  workforce
reduction  to 9.1 percent since 2008,  Vilaggazdasag  reported,
citing its own survey.  Banks are seeking to cut costs as lending has declined and
after the government levied a special tax on banks and forced
them to swallow losses on foreign-currency mortgages, the
business newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
