Capital Dynamics AG, a Swiss
private-asset manager, closed a $282 million fund to invest in
commercial solar projects in the U.S.  Sixty percent of the fund is already destined for at least
50 projects in Massachusetts,  New Jersey , Pennsylvania and
California, and the company expects it will be fully allocated
by early 2013, David Scaysbrook, Capital Dynamics’s managing
director, said in an interview today.  The investments will support more than $500 million of
solar projects that Scaysbrook said will deliver stable returns
to investors by selling electricity.  “Solar is a low-risk asset, has long-term contracted cash
flows and is an attractive investment,” Scaysbrook said.  The fund has 15 institutional investors from the U.S.,
U.K., Australia, Germany,  South Korea  and Japan as well as high
net-worth individuals and families, according to an e-mailed
statement from Zug, Switzerland-based Capital Dynamics.  “I think with some of the educated investors we deal with,
they understand solar as a low risk or one of the lowest risk
technologies in clean energy,” Scaysbrook said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
