Turkey ’s central bank may lower its
maximum 11.5 percent lending rate and become more open to lira
weakness over the rest of 2012,  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  said.  The outlook for inflation is becoming more favorable,
helping the central bank,  Gillian Edgeworth, chief economist
for eastern  Europe  and the  Middle East  at UniCredit AG in
 London , said in an e-mailed report to clients today.  “It seems to make sense at this stage that the bank
gradually lowers the overnight lending rate from the 11.5
percent,” Edgeworth said.  The central bank lends to banks at rates between 5.75
percent and 11.5 percent under its variable monetary policy
framework. Inflation has slowed from a three-year high of 11.1
percent in April to 8.9 percent in June and Basci said last week
he may revise down his inflation forecast of 6.5 percent for the
end of the year.  The lira fell less than 0.1 percent to 1.8218 per dollar at
11:43 a.m. in Istanbul. It’s averaged 1.8028 since the end of
February, reaching a low of 1.8673 for the period on May 31.
Yields on  two-year benchmark bonds  were unchanged at 8.02
percent and have declined 299 basis points this year, the most
among major  emerging markets .  Central bank governor Erdem Basci may elect to bolster his
foreign currency reserves should the lira strengthen, the report
said.  “The lira trades at the strong end of the range
established since February,” Edgeworth said. “Should this
strong end of the band be tested in a meaningful manner over the
coming weeks and months, we would see a policy of renewed
gradual foreign exchange reserve accumulation as sensible.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
