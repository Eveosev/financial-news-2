South and  North Korea  can cooperate
on issues including education and climate change, Park Geun Hye,
a former head of South Korea’s ruling New Frontier Party, told
reporters in Seoul today.   A new direction is needed for building trust with North
Korea, and issues over the communist nation’s nuclear program
shouldn’t halt all activity between the two countries, Park
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
