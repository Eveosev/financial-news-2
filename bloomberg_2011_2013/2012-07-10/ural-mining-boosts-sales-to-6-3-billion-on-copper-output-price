Ural Mining & Metallurgical Co.,
 Russia ’s largest copper producer, said sales rose about 23
percent last year after output increased and prices gained.  Revenue totaled 185.4 billion rubles, or $6.3 billion based
on the average  exchange rate  for 2011, the company said today in
an e-mail. That compares with $5.13 billion in 2010, according
to UMMC’s  website .  Copper earnings climbed last year as rising prices drove
output. Antofagasta Plc reported an 18 percent profit gain,
while Xstrata Plc had a 12 percent increase. UMMC, controlled by
billionaire  Iskandar Makhmudov , became Russia’s largest copper
miner in 2011 after boosting production by almost 3 percent.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization were 44.8 billion rubles in the period, while net
debt was almost 114 billion rubles, UMMC said, without providing
comparative figures for 2010.  Average copper prices on the London Metal Exchange rose 17
percent from a year earlier to $8,828 a metric ton.  To contact the reporters on this story:
