Crude-oil options volatility rose as
underlying September futures slid 2.4 percent after  Norway  ended
a strike that had threatened oil production and China reduced
purchases of raw materials.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
September, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 35.56 percent at 3:40 p.m. on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange , up from 35.34 percent yesterday.
September options are now more active than August.  Crude oil for September delivery declined $2.07, or 2.4
percent, to settle at $84.30 a barrel on the Nymex, the third
loss in four days.  Futures fell as Norway’s government ordered compulsory
arbitration in the labor dispute, preventing a platform workers’
lockout scheduled to start at midnight yesterday.  China ’s net
crude imports slid to the lowest level this year, according to
customs data today.  The most active options in electronic trading today were

3:47 p.m. with 2,012 lots trading. August $82 puts were the
second-most active options, with 1,946 lots changing hands as
they gained 39 cents to 90 cents a barrel.  Bearish Bets  Puts accounted for 57 percent of total electronic trading
