U.S. stock-index futures advanced,
erasing earlier losses, after a report showed U.K. manufacturing
unexpectedly rose in May, easing concern  Europe  will be a drag
on the global economy.  Futures on the Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index expiring in
September gained 0.2 percent to 1,352.4 at 9:51 a.m. in  London .
The benchmark gauge slipped 1.6 percent in the past three
trading days as jobs data heightened concern about a slowing
economy and optimism faded that Europe will resolve its debt
crisis. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures climbed 36 points,
or 0.3 percent, to 12,721 today.  U.K. factory output rose 1.2 percent from April, the  Office
for National Statistics  said today in London. The median
forecast of 26 economists in a Bloomberg News survey called for
a decline of 0.1 percent. Overall industrial output increased 1
percent. The statistics office said both May and June data may
be distorted by the movement of the public holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
