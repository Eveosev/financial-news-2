Ameriprise Financial Inc. (AMP)  said it
plans to change the status of its banking unit by the end of
this year so that the parent firm will no longer be regulated as
a savings and loan holding company.  The transition will lead to a $20 million  expense , most of
it to be incurred this year, Minneapolis-based Ameriprise said
today in a statement. The subsidiary will become a non-
depository trust bank, subject to regulatory approval, the
company said, and clients will have banking access through
third-party providers.  Ameriprise, which provides financial planning and
annuities, joins some of the largest U.S. insurers in distancing
themselves from deposit-gathering operations as federal
regulators increase oversight. MetLife Inc. is seeking to exit
from banking and Hartford Financial Services Group Inc. and
Allstate Corp. have also retreated from the business.  “Transitioning our federal savings bank subsidiary to a
non-depository national trust bank will ensure we are regulated
consistent with our capabilities, strategy and growth
opportunity,” said  Paul Johnson , a spokesman for the company,
in an e-mailed statement.  A “small number” of jobs will be affected by the move,
Johnson said without elaborating. Ameriprise  slipped  16 cents to
$50.23 at 4:01 p.m. in  New York . The company is up about 1.2
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
