Indonesia ’s rupiah fell the most in
two weeks and government bonds declined on concern Europe’s debt
crisis slowed the nation’s growth last quarter.  Southeast Asia’s largest economy may have expanded 6.3
percent or less in the three months through June, President
 Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono  said in Jakarta yesterday. That
compares with the central bank’s June 12 forecast of 6.3 percent
to 6.7 percent this year.  Bank Indonesia  will keep its  reference
rate  at 5.75 percent when it meets on July 12, according to all
20 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Growth is a concern, but any stimulus will probably come
from the fiscal side instead of the monetary side,” said  Gundy
Cahyadi , an economist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. in
Singapore. “In the next one to two months, the rupiah may
continue to be under pressure due to the trade deficit and
persistent dollar demand onshore.”  The rupiah dropped 0.4 percent to 9,445 per dollar as of
9:17 a.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg. That was the biggest decline since June
26. One-month implied volatility, which measures exchange-rate
swings used to price options, held at 8.25 percent.  The nation recorded a trade deficit of $486 million in May,
official data showed last week.  The  yield  on the government’s benchmark 10-year bonds
climbed one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 6.11
percent, the highest level since June 29, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
