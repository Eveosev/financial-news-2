Total SA (FP) , Europe’s third-biggest
energy company, took control of an offshore oil block in Brazil
from  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  as it seeks to expand its operations
in the South American country.  “Our decision to assume operatorship of Xerelete is part
of the group’s strategy to strengthen its exploration and
production activities in Brazil,” Ladislas Paszkiewicz, senior
vice president for exploration and production in the Americas,
said in a statement.  Petrobras, as the Brazilian state-owned company is known,
is focusing its exploration and production activities on the so-
called pre-salt reserves and on newer areas such as the
country’s northern coast as it tries to compensate for dwindling
output from aging wells in the Campos Basin, where Xerelete is
located. The pre-salt reserves are trapped under the ocean bed
beneath layers of salt up to 3,000 meters (9,800 feet) deep.  Total, which owns 41.2 percent of the 2,400-meter deep
Xerelete block, plans to start drilling in 2013. Petrobras owns
another 41.2 percent while  BP Plc (BP/)  holds the remaining 17.6
percent of Xerelete, which was discovered in 2001 and under
which a “pre-salt prospect has also been identified,”
according to Total’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
