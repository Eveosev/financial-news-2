Air Berlin Plc (AB1) , Europe’s third-
biggest discount carrier, will stop flying from Hamburg to
Zurich, Barcelona and Karlsruhe beginning in October.  The carrier will also reduce flights to Nuremberg, Hamburg
airport spokeswoman Stefanie Harder said by telephone today. Air
Berlin will still operate 19 routes to Hamburg, which is
 Germany ’s fifth-biggest passenger airport, she said.  Germany’s second-biggest airline lifted its cost-cutting
targets to 225 million euros ($276 million) in May after
exceeding its savings target in the first quarter. The carrier
has put on hold 19 planes due for delivery this year and next,
and is closing bases in Erfurt and Dortmund, Germany, to
eliminate a further $508 million from spending.  To contact the reporter on this story:
