The U.S. Energy Department  reduced
its crude-oil price projection for 2012 as production increases
and slower economic growth curbs fuel use.  West Texas Intermediate oil will average $92.83 a barrel
this year, down 4.1 percent from the June forecast of $96.80,
the department’s Energy Information Administration said in its
monthly  Short-Term Energy Outlook . The U.S. benchmark crude
grade will average $88.50 in 2013, down 8.8 percent from last
month’s estimate of $97. The 2011 average was $94.86.  The average cost of domestic and imported grades used by
U.S. refiners will be $97.89 a barrel in 2012, down from last
month’s projection of $102. The estimate for 2013 is $93.08,
down from $101.56.  Global oil production will rise 2.1 percent from last year
to 89.05 million barrels a day in 2012, down from the June
estimate of 89.06 million. The 2013 estimate is 89.47 million,
down from the previous estimate of 89.92 million.  Iran ’s oil output will fall by about 1 million barrels a
day by the end of 2012 as a result of the European Union
sanctions that became effective on July 1, the EIA predicted.
Output from the country will fall by 200,000 more barrels a day
in 2013. Iran production levels stood at 3.6 million barrels a
day at the end of 2011, according to the report.  Regular gasoline, averaged nationwide, will average $3.49 a
gallon at the pump this year, down 2 percent from a projection
of $3.56 in June, the report showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
