YPF SA (YPFD) , Argentina’s largest oil
company, denied a newspaper report that said its Chief Executive
Officer Miguel Galuccio attempted twice to resign.  “The information provided by La Nacion is false,” said
YPF’s Communications Director Alejandro Di Lazzaro in a
telephone interview.  Differences between Galuccio and Planning Minister Julio De
Vido were among the reasons for the decision reported by the
Buenos Aires-based La Nacion earlier today. Argentina’s Planning
Ministry issued a statement refuting a La Nacion story published
today, without identifying which one it was.  Galuccio is scheduled to travel to Argentina’s Mendoza
province tomorrow to unveil an educational program for YPF
employees, Di Lazzaro said. Next week, Galuccio will announce
investments at YPF’s Refineria La Plata refining division, Di
Lazzaro said.  Galuccio was appointed YPF’s CEO and chairman by Argentine
President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner on May 4 after the
country nationalized 51 percent of the oil producer from Spain’s
 Repsol YPF SA. (REP)   To contact the reporter on this story:
