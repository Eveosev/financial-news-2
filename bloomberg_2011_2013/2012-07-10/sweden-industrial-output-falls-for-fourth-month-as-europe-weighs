(Corrects monthly production figure in second paragraph)  Swedish industrial production fell
for a fourth month in May as the  European debt crisis  continues
to hurt demand for the export-dependent Nordic country’s
 exports .  Industrial production  fell an annual 2.3 percent in May
after falling 6.4 percent the previous month, Stockholm-based
Statistics  Sweden  said today. Production was  estimated  to fall
6.9 percent, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg
survey of nine economists. Output rose a  monthly  3.5 percent
after falling 0.2 percent the previous month and compared with
0.4 percent growth  predicted by analysts .  Sweden’s government last week cut its forecast for economic
growth next year to 3 percent from 3.3 percent as spending cuts
in  Europe  is reducing demand for exports. About 70 percent of
Swedish output is sold abroad, of which about 70 percent is
bound for Europe, where countries are cutting spending to reduce
private and public debt.  Sweden’s central bank, the Riksbank, last week pushed back
the timetable for when it will next raise its benchmark lending
rate and said it may even have to cut the rate for a third time
since December later this year if the situation in Europe
develops worse than forecast.  Industrial orders for Swedish companies fell an  annual  3.3
percent and rose a  monthly  4.5 percent in May,  Statistics Sweden 
said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
