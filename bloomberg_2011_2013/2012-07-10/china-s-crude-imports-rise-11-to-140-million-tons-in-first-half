Crude imports in June by  China , the
world’s second-biggest oil consumer, fell to the lowest level
this year as the country’s refineries cut their utilization
rates amid an economic slowdown.  China bought 21.6 million metric tons, or 5.28 million
barrels a day, more than it exported last month, according to
 data released  on the website of the Beijing-based General
Administration of Customs today. That’s the least since net
imports of 5.1 million barrels a day in December and compares
with a record high of 5.98 million barrels a day in May,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The country’s biggest refineries, accounting for almost
three-quarters of nationwide capacity, cut their operating rates
to 81.5 percent of the maximum in mid-June compared with 86.3
percent at the end of May, according to Oilchem.net, an industry
website in Shandong province. China is expected to report on
July 13 that economic growth fell to 7.7 percent in the second
quarter, the slowest pace in more than three years, according to
a Bloomberg survey of economists.  The nation reduced oil purchases even as the average
monthly price of Brent oil slid below $100 a barrel in June for
the first time since January 2011. China’s net imports in the
first six months averaged 5.59 million barrels a day compared
with 5.06 million a year earlier, according to Bloomberg
calculations from customs data.  Crude Surplus  China built up the biggest surplus of crude in the first
five months of this year since the run-up to the 2008 Beijing
Olympics, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The oil was
probably stored in commercial and emergency stockpiles, the
 International Energy Agency  said in a June 13 report.  Crude imports were 21.72 million tons in June while exports
were 110,000 tons. The overseas purchases cost an average $111 a
barrel compared with $120 in May, Bloomberg calculations from
the customs data showed.  Imports of fuel including gasoline and diesel were 2.93
million tons while outbound shipments were 2.07 million in June,
according to the report.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
