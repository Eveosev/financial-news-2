MagicJack VocalTec Ltd. (CALL)  surged the
most in three months in New York trading after the Israeli maker
of phone-over-Internet technology raised its 2012 guidance.  MagicJack, based in Netanya,  Israel , jumped 9.2 percent to
$20.44 in New York, the sharpest climb since April 9. The shares
have added 50 percent in 2012 and trade at a multiple of 15.1
times estimated earnings, compared with the average of 15.4 for
companies traded on the Nasdaq Composite Index.  The technology company boosted its 2012 earnings-per-share
outlook to between $1.50 and $1.80, compared with a previous
forecast of $1.25 to $1.70, according to a statement today.
MagicJack said second-quarter sales will be between $37.5
million and $38.5 million, up from a previous estimate of $36
million.  “It looks like sales of devices and renewals are strong,
which bodes well for future growth,” Tim Horan, a
communications and cloud services analyst at Oppenheimer & Co.,
wrote in an e-mail to Bloomberg today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
