Romania ’s domestic borrowing costs
rose “slightly” in the past few weeks pushed up by the
European sovereign-debt crisis and political tensions in the
country, Ziarul Financiar  reported today , citing Deputy Finance
Minister Cristian Sporis.  Sporis reiterated that the  Finance Ministry  frontloaded the
borrowing program in the first half of the year, when it
benefited from record-low yields, according to the newspaper.
He also said the liquidity structure of the banking industry
pushed borrowing costs higher on the domestic market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
