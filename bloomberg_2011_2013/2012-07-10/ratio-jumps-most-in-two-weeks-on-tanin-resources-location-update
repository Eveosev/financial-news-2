Ratio Oil Exploration 1992 LP (RATIL)  jumped
the most in more than two weeks after the Tel Aviv, Israel-based
company said a report found some of the resources of the Tanin
field are in the Amit/350 license in which it has a stake.  The  shares  rose 3.6 percent, the most since June 25, to
0.259 shekel at 2:29 p.m. in Tel Aviv.  Avner Oil Exploration LLP (AVNRL)  and  Delek Drilling-LP (DEDRL) , partners
in the Tanin field, said consultants Netherland, Sewell and
Associates, Inc. provided an update amending the location of
resources.  -- Editors: Robert Lakin, Claudia Maedler  To contact the reporter on this story:
