The German government decided to let
 Deutsche Post AG (DPW)  retain its monopoly, calling off plans by
Economy Minister Philipp Roesler to liberalize postal services,
Financial Times Deutschland reported, without saying where it
got the information.  Deutsche Post retains its dominance over the business with
a 90 percent market share that provides 8.1 billion euros ($9.9
billion) in annual revenue, FTD said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
