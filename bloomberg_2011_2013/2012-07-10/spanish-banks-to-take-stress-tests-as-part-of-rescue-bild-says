The 14 biggest Spanish banks have to
undergo a  stress test  as a condition for the aid from the
European Financial Stability Fund,  Bild  reported citing a
memorandum of understanding without clarifying the nature of the
document.  Bank restructuring plans will be set up by November on the
basis of the results of the test, enabling the banks to live
without aid in the medium term, the newspaper said. Banks that
receive money from the rescue fund will face pay caps for their
board members, the newspaper added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
