Luxembourg Finance Minister Luc Frieden said one of his ministry officials could replace central
bank President Yves Mersch, who was yesterday named to the
European Central Bank’s Executive Board.  Gaston Reinesch, director general at the Luxembourg finance
ministry, would be “a good candidate” to head the country’s
central bank, Frieden told reporters in Brussels today. The
final decision will be taken by the government, which hasn’t
discussed the appointment yet.  “We have good people in Luxembourg that could fill this
post and I could well imagine a person such as Gaston Reinesch
in it,” said Frieden after a meeting of European Union finance
ministers. “Mr Reinesch is experienced in European and national
affairs, which would qualify him for such a post.”  Mersch,  Europe ’s longest-serving central banker, will take
the position vacated by  Spain ’s Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Paramo on
the Frankfurt-based ECB’s six-member board. Mersch defeated a
Spanish nominee, Antonio Sainz de Vicuna, head of legal services
at the ECB, as well as Mitja Gaspari, former head of Slovenia’s
central bank.  Mersch will start in  Frankfurt  in September or October at
the earliest and by then a successor will have been found, said
Frieden. Mersch got the endorsement of the 27 EU finance
ministers today. He still needs final confirmation from euro-
area leaders after a European Parliament hearing and a non-
binding vote before he can start an eight-year term.  “Luxembourg has many good people and it won’t be very
complicated to find someone good to take over as head of the
central bank,” said Frieden.  To contact the reporter on this story:
