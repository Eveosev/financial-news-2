Heavy Louisiana Sweet advanced to a
one-month high against the U.S. benchmark West  Texas 
Intermediate as refineries in the U.S.  Gulf Coast  increased
crude runs following scheduled maintenance and repairs.  Total refinery input  in the Gulf Coast, known as the Padd 3
region, climbed for the second week, data compiled by the
 American Petroleum Institute  showed. Plants in the region
processed 8.57 million barrels in the week ended July 6, up from
8.56 million a week earlier, the industry-funded group said.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet gained for the third straight day,
rising $1.80 to a premium of $15.05 a barrel against WTI at 4:27
p.m. in New York, the highest level for the oil since June 8,
data compiled by Bloomberg shows. Light Louisiana Sweet advanced
for the sixth day, increasing 25 cents to $14 a barrel above
WTI, the highest level since June 22.  “It could only be refineries kicking up crude runs,” said
 Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston,
said by telephone. “Maintenance is over, and Tropical Storm
Debby is no longer a threat.”  Poseidon strengthened 15 cents to $8.90 a barrel above WTI,
and Southern Green Canyon rose 25 cents to a premium of $8.50.
Mars Blend added 25 cents to $10 a barrel over WTI.  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower sulfur content than
Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon, increased 80 cents to
a $12.50-a-barrel premium versus WTI.  Western  Canada  Select, a heavy, sour Canadian-blended
crude, strengthened 50 cents to $22 a barrel under WTI. The fuel
weakened 75 cents earlier after  Phillips 66 (PSX) ’s Ponca City
refinery in  Oklahoma  started planned maintenance.  The plant, which processes crude from Canada, Oklahoma and
Texas, shut the coker for seven to 10 days of work, a person
familiar with operations there said.  Rich Johnson , a Phillips 66 spokesman at the company’s
headquarters in Houston, said in an earlier e-mail that the
187,000-barrel-a-day refinery was performing planned
maintenance. He declined to say which units are involved in the
work or how long the maintenance will last.  Syncrude, a synthetic oil upgraded from tar-like bitumen in
 Alberta  into refinery-ready crude, gained 60 cents to $2 a
barrel below WTI.  Bakken oil advanced $1.25 to a discount of $5.75 a barrel
against the U.S. benchmark.  To contact the reporters on this story:
