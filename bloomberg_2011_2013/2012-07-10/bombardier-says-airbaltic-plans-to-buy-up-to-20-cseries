Bombardier Inc. (BBD/B)  said Latvian carrier
AirBaltic AS signed a letter of intent to buy as many as 20
CSeries jets, the Canadian planemaker’s first entry into the
market for narrow-body airliners.  The agreement calls for Riga-based AirBaltic to order 10 of
the CS300 model and get purchase rights for 10 more, Bombardier
said today in a statement at the Farnborough air show outside
 London . A firm order for the first 10 planes would be valued at
about $764 million, Bombardier said.  Bombardier has struggled for orders in its bid to crack
 Airbus SAS (EAD)  and  Boeing Co. (BA) ’s airliner-building duopoly, with most
purchases at about 10 planes while the competitors sell scores
or even hundreds of jets at a time. Bombardier said July 8 it
won a conditional order for 15 CSeries planes valued at $1.02
billion from a buyer that asked to remain unidentified.  CSeries orders totaled 138 heading into the Farnborough
International Air Show. Montreal-based Bombardier is trying to
carve out a market for a plane able to seat 100 to 149 people,
the smaller end of the narrow-body aircraft segment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
