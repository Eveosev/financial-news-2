Barclays Bank Kenya Ltd. (BCBL) , the
countryâ€™s second-biggest lender by market value, climbed to a
seven-week high on speculation lower lending rates will boost
demand for loans.  The stock rose 1.1 percent to 13.65 shillings by the 3 p.m.
close in Nairobi, the strongest level since May 18, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Barclays will cut its base lending rate by 1.5 percentage
points to 21 percent, effective Aug. 1, Chief Executive Officer
Adan Mohamed said July 6. The  Central Bank  of  Kenya  reduced its
 benchmark lending rate  to 16.5 percent, from a record 18 percent
on July 5.  Lower rates will result in increased lending to different
sectors of the economy gaining momentum from the next quarter of
the calendar year, Kestrel Capital East Africa Ltd. said in an
e-mailed note to clients yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
