EnBW Energie Baden-Wuerttemberg AG (EBK) 
was worth at least 840 million euros ($1.03 billion) less at the
time the government bought back a stake in the utility,
 Stuttgarter Zeitung  reported, citing a legal opinion by the
auditing company Warth & Klein Grant Thornton commissioned by
the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg.  The takeover premium of 18.6 percent on the share price
wasn’t justified because the government didn’t get control over
the company, Stuttgarter said. The description of the deal by
 Morgan Stanley (MS)  was “misleading,” according to the assessment,
the newspaper added. EnBW officials couldn’t immediately be
reached for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
