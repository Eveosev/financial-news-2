Piraeus Port Authority SA (PPA)  (PPA),
which operates  Greece ’s biggest port, said the number of new car
imports handled in the second quarter rose 29 percent.  The port’s car terminal handled 125,069 vehicles in the
three months to June 30, the authority said in a  statement  on
its website. The number of so-called transit cars, which are
imported via Piraeus for Balkan markets, increased 58 percent to
111,106, while vehicles destined for the home market fell 47
percent to 13,963.  Piraeus expects to handle more than 400,000 transit cars in
2012 based on first-half figures, according to the statement.
The authority will start working this year on an investment plan
to build a new car terminal at Irakleous, west of Piraeus.  Large international transport companies have expressed
investment interest in the terminal, which would enable the
transit of cars to eastern Mediterranean,  Black Sea  and North
African markets, chief executive Yiorgos Anomeritis said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
