Minor changes to Transportation
Security Administration management practices could change its
poor image and improve travelers’ airport experience, former
agency officials told a U.S. House panel.  Giving local TSA airport managers more authority to
intervene when children or elderly passengers are singled out
for patdowns would restore credibility with the flying public,
said Tom Blank, a senior agency official during President  George W. Bush ’s administration.  “If TSA can significantly reduce adverse experiences, the
agency’s overall credibility as a bulwark of post 9/11  homeland
security  will go up markedly,” said Blank, now an executive
vice president with Gephardt Government Affairs, a  Washington 
lobbying firm.  The TSA has come under increasing criticism from Congress
after reports of patdowns of senior citizens, young children and
celebrities spread on social media and employees in several
cities were arrested.  TSA has more than 3,000 managers at most large U.S. airport
checkpoints, and they could be empowered to intervene in
sensitive situations without setting aside security procedures,
Blank said.  More Training  TSA Administrator  John Pistole  has said the agency is
providing more training for those managers yet doesn’t have
enough funding to go faster. That training should be expedited,
Blank said. It should be relatively simple to find the money in
an agency as large as the TSA, he said.  “Working with the  U.S. Congress , TSA remains committed to
providing the traveling public the most effective transportation
security in the most efficient way possible,”   David Castelveter , an agency spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement.
“We continue to work closely with industry stakeholders and
value their input.”  House Transportation Security Subcommittee Chairman Mike Rogers, who called the hearing, said he was looking for ideas on
how to streamline the screening process and make TSA smarter,
leaner and more professional.  “TSA’s poor conduct is sending a strong message to
American taxpayers,” Rogers, an Alabama Republican, said. “TSA
doesn’t care or doesn’t know how to best serve and protect the
traveling public.”  TSA has an inherent conflict of interest when it comes to
airport screening, as it’s both the operator and the regulator,
said Robert Poole, director of transportation policy at the
Reason Foundation, a Los Angeles-based group that supports free
markets. That leads the agency to reflexively defend itself
after mistakes, he said.  Good Government  “Arm’s-length regulation is a basic good-government
principle,” Poole said. “Self-regulation is inherently
problematic.”  TSA should speed up efforts to allow airports to use
private-company screeners, such as the ones employed at  San
Francisco International Airport , Poole said. A recent study
found San Francisco screeners performed at a higher level than
TSA screeners in  Los Angeles  International Airport. If private
screeners were used in Los Angeles, the workforce would be 867
persons smaller, saving $33 million a year, Poole said.  Some of TSA’s problems stem from its creation by Congress a
few months after the September 11 terrorist attacks, said Rick “Ozzie” Nelson, director of homeland security and
counterterrorism at the  Center for Strategic and International
Studies  in Washington.  Congress gave the agency a “zero-failure” mandate while
expecting it to protect the civil liberties of 2.2 million U.S.
airline passengers every day, Nelson said.  ‘Impossible’ Goal  “It is impossible for any agency to completely mitigate
all risk to our transport system, yet we have been forcing TSA
to operate under a model that promotes this goal, fueling bad
policy and practice,” Nelson said.  Security problems continue to occur, including an attempted
hijacking in  China  a week ago, said Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, a Texas Democrat. In May, an  AMR Corp. (AAMRQ)  American
Airlines flight from Paris to  Charlotte ,  North Carolina , was
diverted to  Maine  after a passenger claimed, falsely, that she
was carrying an implanted explosive device, she said.  “I will be continuously committed to the security we put
in place,” Jackson Lee said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
