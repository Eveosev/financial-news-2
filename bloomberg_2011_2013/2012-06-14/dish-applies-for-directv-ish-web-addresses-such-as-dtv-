Dish Network Corp. (DISH) , the second-
largest U.S. satellite-TV provider, applied for the Web-address
suffixes “.direct” and “.dtv” -- names that relate more
closely to the brand of its chief competitor,  DirecTV. (DTV)   A nonprofit Web-management group released a list yesterday
of  1,930 applications  of new Internet domain suffixes, which
companies can use to market their brands and operations. The
idea is to go beyond the typical dot-com addresses that are
common today. Dish applied for 13 of the names, with two
appearing to reference its larger rival.  Aaron Johnson , a spokesman for Englewood, Colorado-based
Dish, said the names have nothing to do with DirecTV. Dish is
applying for the suffixes to potentially attach them to
marketing, strategic and competitive services, Johnson said. He
declined to cite specific products or programs that the suffixes
may relate to.  “We see these names serving a variety of applications,”
Johnson said.  DirecTV doesn’t plan to challenge the applications, which
cost $185,000 each. El Segundo, California-based DirecTV didn’t
apply for any of the suffixes itself because the company isn’t
intending to use them, said Darris Gringeri, a spokesman.  U.S. regulators blocked a proposed merger between Dish and
DirecTV in 2002. Dish Chief Executive Officer Joseph Clayton
said last year he wouldn’t discount the possibility of a future
merger between the two companies.  Dish shares  rose 1 percent to $27.22 at the close today in
 New York . DirecTV climbed 2.3 percent to $43.97.  To contact the reporter on this story:
