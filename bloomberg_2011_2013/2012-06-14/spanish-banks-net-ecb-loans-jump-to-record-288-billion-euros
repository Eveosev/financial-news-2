Spanish lenders’ net borrowings from
the ECB jumped to a record 287.8 billion euros ($361.4 billion)
in May, highlighting the thirst of the financial system for
funding before the country’s banking bailout.  Net average ECB borrowings climbed from 263.5 billion euros
in April, the  Bank of Spain  said on its website today. Gross
borrowing was 324.6 billion euros in May, up from 316.9 billion
euros in April.  Spain  on June 9 became the fourth euro member to seek a
bailout since the debt crisis began almost three years ago,
asking for as much as 100 billion euros to rescue lenders
pummeled by a real estate slump now in its fifth year.  The increase in ECB borrowings “conveys the severity of
the predicament some banks found themselves in ahead of last
week’s bailout,” Martin van Vliet, an economist at ING Bank in
Amsterdam, said in an e-mailed comment. “Now that concerns
about the solvency of Spain’s banks will be addressed, financing
difficulties should gradually start to ease. But we should
expect the Spanish banking system to remain heavily dependent on
central bank funding for quite some time.”  The net amount subtracts the average amount parked by
Spanish banks at the overnight deposit facility, van Vliet said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
