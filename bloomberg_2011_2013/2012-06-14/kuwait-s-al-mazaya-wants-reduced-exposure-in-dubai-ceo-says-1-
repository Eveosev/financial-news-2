Al-Mazaya Holding Co. (MAZAYA) , a Kuwait-
based property developer, plans to reduce its business in Dubai,
Chief Executive Officer Nayef Mohammed Al-Awadi said, citing
difficulties.  “We want to reduce our exposure in Dubai because of
difficulties with existing infrastructure and master
developers,” Al-Awadi said in an interview today in  Kuwait .  Construction companies in the  United Arab Emirates  are
searching for work in other markets after $964 billion in
projects were halted or canceled in the country as of last
November, Citigroup said in a Jan. 6 report.  Al-Mazaya, which posted a  profit  of $3.4 million in the
first quarter of this year, is “doing well from an operational
point of view but unfortunately, the decline of our assets in
Dubai has affected us,” Al-Awadi said. Growth in 2012 will
depend on the value of assets at the end of the year, he added.  The company isn’t planning any projects until 2013 and is
occupied with existing projects, mainly in Dubai, Al-Awadi said.
Al-Mazaya plans to focus on  Saudi Arabia ’s residential market,
where it sees strong demand, he added.  Al-Mazaya  shares  were unchanged at 70 fils ($0.25) at the
close in Kuwait today. The stock has gained 13 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
