Joe Torre, who led the  New York
Yankees  to four  World Series  titles, is making his managerial
return with Team USA at the 2013  World Baseball Classic .  Torre, 71, won 2,326 games -- the fifth-most in  Major
League Baseball  history -- over 29 seasons with the Yankees, New
York Mets, Atlanta Braves, St. Louis Cardinals and Los Angeles
Dodgers before joining baseball’s front office. He’s been MLB’s
executive vice president for baseball operations since 2011.  “I have been fortunate to have many different experiences
throughout my career, but being a part of Team USA will be a
first, and I am very excited,” Torre said in a statement.  The U.S. team, which has featured major league players
including All-Stars  Derek Jeter , David Wright, Dustin Pedroia
and  Evan Longoria , finished sixth at the inaugural WBC in 2006
and was fourth in 2009. Buck Martinez managed the first U.S.
team in the WBC, while current Washington Nationals manager
Davey Johnson led the 2009 squad.  The schedule and venues for the 2013 WBC will be released
in the coming weeks, Major League Baseball said. The U.S. is
among 12 teams that have qualified for the event, while other
nations will advance through regional qualifiers to be held in
September and November at four international venues.  Torre played in the majors from 1960-77 and was the
National League’s Most Valuable Player in 1971.  He managed the Mets from 1977-1981, the Braves from 1982-
1984 and the Cardinals from 1990-95 before joining the Yankees
in 1996. He made 12 postseason appearances in as many seasons
with the Yankees, winning World Series in 1996 and from 1998 to
2000, before leading the Dodgers to consecutive appearances in
the NL Championship Series in 2008 and 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
