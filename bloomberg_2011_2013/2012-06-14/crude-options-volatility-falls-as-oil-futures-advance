Crude-oil options volatility fell as
underlying futures rose from an eight-month low on speculation
that the  Federal Reserve  will act to stimulate growth.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
August, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 34.35 at 1:15 p.m. on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange, down from 35.76 yesterday. It was the third
consecutive decline. Volatility reached 40.6 on June 1, the
highest since Oct. 20.  Crude oil for July delivery rose $1.02, or 1.2 percent, to
$83.64 a barrel at 1:16 p.m. on the Nymex. Oil for delivery in
August advanced $1 to $83.92.  Speculation that the Fed will act rose after the Labor
Department reported that consumer prices sank in May by the most
in more than three years and claims for jobless benefits climbed
by 6,000 to 386,000 in the week ended June 9.The policy-setting
 Federal Open Market Committee  is scheduled to meet June 19-20.  The most active oil options in electronic trading today

1:44 p.m. with 4,539 lots trading. July $80 puts were the
second-most active options, with 2,289 lots changing hands as
they declined 14 cents to 6 cents.  Calls accounted for 53 percent of electronic trading
volume. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
