Turkey ’s  parliament  passed a draft
law allowing the government to make contributions to private
pension plans.  The measure, which also widens tax breaks for pensions,
needs the approval of President  Abdullah Gul  before becoming
law. It stipulates that the government will match 25 percent of
contributions to pension plans that pay in full only on
retirement, according to the state-run Anatolia news agency.  The government’s contributions will be withdrawn if a
client cancels membership before three years, Anatolia said. The
law also exempts all pension contributors from the 15 percent
withholding tax on financial gains. Previously, only savers who
contributed for at least 10 years were exempt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
