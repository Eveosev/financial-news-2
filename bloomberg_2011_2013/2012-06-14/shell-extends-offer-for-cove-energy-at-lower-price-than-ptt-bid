Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  extended its
offer to buy  Cove Energy Plc (COV) , an oil explorer focused on  East
Africa , without matching  PTT Exploration & Production Pcl (PTTEP) ’s
higher bid for the firm.  Cove shareholders now have until June 27 to agree to
Shell’s bid, a second extension after the offer of 220 pence
offer was made on April 24. Shell has received 4.8 percent of
the shareholders’ acceptances so far, it said today. On May 23,
Thailand’s PTT made an offer of 240 pence, valuing Cove at 1.22
billion pounds ($1.9 billion).  Shell Chief Executive Officer Peter Voser declined to
comment on the prospect of a  higher bid in a Bloomberg
Television interview today.  Cove shares are trading above PTT’s offer price, indicating
investors expect an improved bid. The stock closed up 0.6
percent at 265.5 pence in London today.  Cove’s largest asset is a 8.5 percent holding in
Mozambique’s Rovuma Area 1, where a group led by  Anadarko
Petroleum Corp. (APC)  has found as much as 60 trillion cubic feet of
recoverable natural gas, or more than six times the U.K.’s
existing reserves. Cove increased its estimate of the find
earlier this week, and Mozambique approved PTT’s bid last month.  The discoveries open the way for Mozambique to become an
exporter of liquefied natural gas, shipping fuel to Asian
economies including India and China. For state-controlled PTT,
the purchase of Cove offers Thailand a secure source of gas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
