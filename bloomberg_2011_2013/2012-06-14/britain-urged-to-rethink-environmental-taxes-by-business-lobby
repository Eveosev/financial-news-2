The  Confederation of British
Industry , the U.K.’s biggest business lobby, has urged the
government to revamp its environmental taxes to make them
simpler.  The number of green levies has tripled in the last two
decades and contribute about 8 percent of the country’s total
tax revenue, the CBI said in a report published today.  “Well-designed, environmental taxes can be a useful tool
to help firms improve their performance and unlock significant
business investment,”  Ian McCafferty , chief economic adviser at
the CBI, said in an e-mailed statement. “However, poorly
planned environmental taxes have damaged businesses and made the
U.K. tax system less attractive to would-be investors.”  The CBI set out six recommendations about how the
government can improve environmental taxation. Those include
ensuring simple regimes that provide certainty to business. It
also urged the government to scrap its tax known as the Carbon
Reduction Commitment, and instead oblige companies to report on
 carbon emissions .  To contact the reporter on this story:
