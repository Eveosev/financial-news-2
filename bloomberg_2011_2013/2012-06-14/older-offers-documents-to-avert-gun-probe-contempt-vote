The U.S.  Justice Department  is
offering to provide some documents requested by House
Republicans related to a federal gun investigation in an effort
to avoid a vote on whether Attorney General Eric Holder should
be held in contempt of Congress.  Holder made the offer in a letter today to Darrell Issa,
the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform
committee, which scheduled a contempt vote for June 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
