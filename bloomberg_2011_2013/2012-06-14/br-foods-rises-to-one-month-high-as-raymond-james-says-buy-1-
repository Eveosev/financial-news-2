Brasil Foods (BRFS3)  SA, the world’s biggest
poultry exporter, rose to a one-month high after  Raymond James 
raised its recommendation, citing valuation, and the company
confirmed it will transfer control of a unit to  Marfrig
Alimentos SA. (MRFG3)   Brasil Foods advanced 2.7 percent to 33.50 reais at the
close in Sao Paulo, the highest since May 11. The benchmark
Bovespa index slid 0.5 percent.  “The recent selloff in shares appears overdone, and we
believe that this now offers an attractive entry point, despite
our forecast for weak second quarter of 2012 results,” Raymond
James analysts Daniela Bretthauer and Joseph Giordano wrote in a
note dated yesterday. “Shares have also underperformed other
Brazilian food companies year to date, which we find unwarranted
given its solid long-term fundamentals.”  Brasil Foods lost 8 percent this year, while competitor
Marfrig rose 14 percent. The benchmark index fell 2.5 percent in
that period.  Brasil Foods will transfer 65 percent of its  Excelsior
Alimentos SA (BAUH4)  unit to Marfrig on July 2, according to a
regulatory filing after the market closed yesterday. The deal is
the result of an exchange agreement between the companies that
was already approved by Brazil’s antitrust regulator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
