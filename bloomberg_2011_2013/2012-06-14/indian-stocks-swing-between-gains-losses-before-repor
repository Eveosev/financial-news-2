Indian stocks dropped for the first
time in three days after data showed inflation quickened faster
than estimated in May and as a downgrade in Spain and Cyprus’
credit ratings threatened to deepen  Europe ’s debt crisis.  Larsen & Toubro Ltd. (LT) , the nation’s largest engineering
company, tumbled 3.9 percent, ending a two-day advance. The
benchmark wholesale-price index climbed 7.55 percent, after
rising 7.23 percent in April, the government said today. The
median of 37 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey was for a 7.5
percent gain.  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) , the second-largest lender,
retreated 3.3 percent, pacing losses among peers.  The  BSE India Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, lost 1.2 percent
to 16,672.39, according to preliminary closing prices. Asian and
European stocks declined as Moody’s Investors Service cut
Spain’s rating by three steps late yesterday, citing increased
debt burden and weakening economy.  “While inflation exceeded expectations, weakness in global
markets is also keeping investors jittery,” Sandip Sabharwal,
head of portfolio management services at Prabhudas Lilladher in
Mumbai, said by phone.  Moody’s also lowered Cyprus’s bond rating to Ba3 from Ba1,
attributing the downgrade to the increased likelihood of  Greece 
leaving the euro area. The country’s government may have to give
more support to Cypriot banks as a consequence.  Policy makers globally are being pressed into action to
boost the global economy that is suffering its worst slowdown
since the recession ended in 2009. On the heels of a June 5
interest-rate cut by  Australia , China two days later unveiled
its first reduction in borrowing costs in more than three years.  Policy Gridlock  India ’s economic  growth  in the first quarter was the
weakest in almost a decade as a policy paralysis in the ruling
coalition undermined Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh ’s efforts to
revitalize the economy and the debt crisis in Europe, India’s
top trading partner, crimped exports.  “Growth numbers are overshadowing inflation data and in a
scenario where government policy isn’t spurring expansion, the
RBI has to take steps to boost growth,” said Sabharwal.  Data earlier this week showed India’s factory output
expanded less than analysts estimated in April, adding to the
case for a cut in  interest rates . The  Reserve Bank  of India may
lower its benchmark rate to 7.75 percent from 8 percent at its
June 18 review, according to 17 of 23 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News. Two expect a cut to 7.5 percent, while the rest
predict no change.  The Sensex rallied 4.7 percent last week, its best weekly
advance this year, amid speculation of a rate cut. The 30-stock
gauge has climbed 8.2 percent this year and  trades  at 13.1 times
estimated earnings, near the lowest in more than three years.
The MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index trades at 9.9 times.  Foreign Funds  Larsen tumbled 3.9 percent to 1,296.90 rupees, poised for
the steepest decline since May 4. ICICI Bank retreated 3.3
percent to 821.65 rupees while larger rival  State Bank of India 
declined 3 percent to 2,158.8 rupees.  India VIX, which measures the cost of protection against
losses in the S&P CNX Nifty Index, jumped 5 percent to 25.57.
The Nifty fell 1.1 percent to 5,063.65 and the  BSE-200 Index (BSE200) 
lost 1.1 percent to 2,049.03. Combined trading volume on India’s
top two exchanges was 810.99 million shares yesterday, compared
with a 12-month daily average of 906.87 million.  Overseas  investors  were net buyers of local shares for a
fifth day on June 12, purchasing a net  $4.25 million  of stocks
and taking their total investment this year to $8.51 billion,
data from the regulator show. Foreigners had cut holdings by
$273 million in May, a second straight month of net sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
