(Corrects production capacity in second paragraph of story
published June 14.)  Celanese Corp. (CE) , the world’s largest
maker of acetic acid, plans to produce methanol outside Houston
to supply its plants with the material derived from low-cost
natural gas.  The factory at the company’s site in Clear Lake,  Texas ,
would be capable of producing 1.3 million metric tons of
methanol a year when operations begin after July 1, 2015,
Dallas-based Celanese said today in a statement. Celanese, which
uses methanol to make acetic acid, plans to sign up a partner to
take some of the supply.  Celanese is the latest chemical maker to announce new
factories aimed at taking advantage of inexpensive U.S. gas,
which hit a 10-year low in April, providing a cost advantage
over regions that rely on oil-based raw materials.  Methanex
Corp. (MX) , the world’s biggest methanol maker, is relocating a
Chilean factory to  Louisiana , and Chevron Phillips Chemical Co.
is spending $5 billion to make plastics in Texas.  “The positive developments in the U.S. energy complex and
the current and emerging natural-gas surplus make it
advantageous for us to produce our own methanol requirements for
U.S. acetyl production,” Mark Rohr, Celanese chairman and chief
executive officer, said in the statement.  Acetyls, including acetic acid, are used in paints,
adhesives and polyester. The company isn’t disclosing the cost
of the project, said Linda Beheler, a Celanese spokeswoman.  Methanol is made from methane, the largest component of
gas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
