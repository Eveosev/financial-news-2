Volksbank International AG, the
Austrian lender bought by Russia’s  OAO Sberbank (SBER)  this year, swung
to a 160.4 million-euro loss ($201 million) under its previous
owners as it wrote down its Hungarian unit due to bad loans.  VBI, which owns nine banks in eight eastern European
countries, wrote down Hungary’s Magyarorszagi Volksbank Zrt and
units in Serbia and the Serbian part of Bosnia and Herzegovina
by 158.6 million euros, it said in its annual report, published
in Austria’s official gazette today. That compares with a 15.1
million-euro profit a year earlier.  Sberbank lowered its bid for the company twice in the
course of takeover talks that started last year with the
previous owners, which were led by  Oesterreichische Volksbanken
AG. (VBPS)  Russia’s biggest lender also demanded that the previous
owners replenished VBI’s reserves, depleted by the losses in
 Hungary , and that they carve out the money-losing Romanian
business, which Sberbank didn’t want to buy.  In the end, Sberbank paid 505 million euros for the bank,
which it plans to use as a springboard for expansion in eastern
Europe and  Turkey .  Today’s VBI annual report is for the Vienna-based holding
company and follows Austrian accounting standards. Under those
rules, subsidiaries’ assets, revenues and earnings aren’t
consolidated, as they are under international accounting
standards.  To contact the reporter on this story:
