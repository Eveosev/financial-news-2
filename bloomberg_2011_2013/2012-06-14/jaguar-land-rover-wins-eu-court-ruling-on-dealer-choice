Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) ’s Jaguar Land Rover
unit won a European Union court challenge over limiting its
sales network for luxury cars.  The  European Court  of Justice ruled Jaguar Land Rover, the
maker of the  XK sports car  and Discovery SUV, doesn’t have to
follow specific rules or disclose its reasons for choosing car
dealers in a dispute with Auto 24 SARL, which had sought
unsuccessfully to distribute the cars in France.  “It is not necessary for such a system to be based on
criteria that are objectively justified and applied in a uniform
and non-differentiated manner,” the Luxembourg-based tribunal
said in its judgment. Companies also don’t have to publish their
selection criteria which may compromise business secrets or aid
collusion.  The ruling has implications for other luxury goods makers
such as  LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC)  and  Chanel SA  which
want to limit some distributors’ sales. They argue that their
brands can be harmed if they are sold by unauthorized retailers,
particularly online resellers.  Jaguar Land Rover, a U.K.-based unit of India’s largest
carmaker, didn’t immediately respond to a call and an e-mail
seeking comment. Auto 24’s lawyer in Paris didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  Rulings from the European Union’s highest court are
binding. The Luxembourg-based tribunal rules on points of law
and final decisions on the details of the case are left to
France’s Cour de Cassation, the country’s highest appeals court.  The case is:  C-158/11  Auto 24 SARL v Jaguar Land Rover
