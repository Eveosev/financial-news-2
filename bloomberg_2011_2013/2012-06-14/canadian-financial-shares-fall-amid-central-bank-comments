Canadian stocks  fell as financial
shares retreated after the central bank said the country faces a
“major shock” if  Europe ’s crisis worsens.  Royal Bank of Canada (RY)  and  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD)  dropped 0.3
percent.  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM)  fell 3.6 percent after Nokia
Oyj, another phone manufacturer that’s lost market share to
Apple Inc. and Google Inc., reduced its earnings forecast and
announced as many as 10,000 job cuts. Oil and natural gas
exploration companies  Crew Energy Inc. (CR)  and  Celtic Exploration
Ltd. (CLT)  soared at least 7.9 percent.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index declined 31.45
points, or 0.3 percent, to 11,466.42. The benchmark gauge is
down 0.3 percent this week before Greece’s weekend election that
may determine whether the nation stays in the euro.  “Every rational person knows what the politicians need to
do and that is get as much ink and paper as they can and print
money,” said Keith McLean, a managing partner at GMP Investment
Management LLC. in Toronto. The firm manages C$650 million ($634
million). “That will be a boon for oil, a boon for gas, a boon
for gold and all commodities. The Canadian market will be a
great one to get back to once they act.”  Canadian shares briefly erased losses after Reuters
reported that central banks were prepared to coordinate their
actions to boost liquidity to financial markets bracing for the
Greek elections.  Stocks in  Canada  swung between gains and losses throughout
the day, as European stocks fell for a fourth day. Borrowing
costs surged for Italy at its first bond auction since Spain
requested a 100 billion euro ($126 billion) bank rescue. U.S.
jobless claims climbed by 6,000 to 386,000 in the week ended
June 9. Economists projected claims would fall to 375,000,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  ‘Very Stimulative’  Financial shares in the S&P/TSX fell 0.4 percent. While
Canada’s financial system has fared well and conditions in the
country remain “very stimulative,” deepening turmoil in Europe
may boost funding costs for the nation’s banks and generate
losses from assets linked to the  euro zone , the  Bank of Canada 
said today in its semi-annual Financial System Review. Non-
performing loans at Canadian banks would also increase if growth
slows.  Royal Bank of Canada, the nation’s largest lender, declined
0.3 percent to C$50.85, snapping two days of gains. Toronto-
Dominion Bank, the second-largest lender, lost 0.3 percent to
C$78.79. Manulife Financial Corp. dropped 2.1 percent to
C$10.57.  Research In Motion declined 3.6 percent to C$10.61 and is
down 28 percent for the year.  Energy companies advanced as oil rose as much as 2.2
percent on speculation the worse-than-forecast U.S. report on
jobless claims would prompt the  Federal Reserve  to loosen
monetary policy to spur growth. Crew Energy rose 9.3 percent to
C$6.45. Celtic Exploration advanced 7.9 percent to C$11.96.  Dollarama Inc. (DOL)  jumped 3.1 percent to C$62.47, bringing its
two-day gain to 9.9 percent after the discount retailer reported
first-quarter earnings that beat analysts’ estimates. The stock
has surged 40 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
