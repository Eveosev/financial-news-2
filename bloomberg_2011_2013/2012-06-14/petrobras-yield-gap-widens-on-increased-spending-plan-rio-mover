Bonds sold by  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) 
fell, sending the yield gap relative to benchmark government
debt to the widest since October, after the state-controlled
producer increased its spending plan.  The yield on Petrobras debt due 2041 rose four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 5.62 percent at 5:35 p.m. 
in  Sao Paulo , putting it 138 basis points above similar maturity
bonds sold by  Brazil , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The spread was the biggest since Oct. 6.  Petrobras will borrow as much as $18 billion a year through
2016 to finance its $236.5 billion investment plan, the biggest
in the industry and an increase from the most recent $224.7
billion estimate, the company said today. The companyâ€™s outlook
assumes average Brent oil prices of $90 a barrel to $100 a
barrel through 2016, the company said.  Petrobras also cut its oil and natural gas production
target 11 percent to 5.7 million barrels a day in 2020 amid
delays in acquiring drilling equipment and production platforms,
it said.  Petrobras shares fell 2.8 percent to 18.37 reais. Earlier
they fell as much as 3.7 percent to the lowest since May 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
