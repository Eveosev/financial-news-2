Centrotherm Photovoltaics AG (CTN) , a
German maker of machines for the solar-power industry, slumped
to a record in Frankfurt trading after insurers cut off cover
for deliveries because of a “poor market environment.”  Centrotherm  plunged  as much as 40 percent to 3.08 euros,
the lowest since the shares first started trading in 2007. The
shares were at 3.57 euros as of 9:50 a.m. local time.  The company said late yesterday that merchandise credit
insurers said they will no longer cover deliveries to
Centrotherm as a result of the “strained financing situation.”
That will hurt liquidity in a “low double-digit” amount in
millions of euros.  Centrotherm said it hired a management-consulting firm it
didn’t identify to prepare a reorganization plan that would
provide the basis for further talks with its banks to secure
financing. “Until further notice, open credit and guarantee
lines can no longer be utilized given current financing
discussions with banks,” the company said.  Solar-cell and panel makers, Centrotherm’s clients, are
under pressure after governments in  Europe  and the U.S. trimmed
subsidies, worsening a glut of the devices that has already
slashed margins at the top five manufacturers. Centrotherm last
month posted a 42.9 million-euro ($54 million) loss before
interest and tax in the first three months of 2012 and said it
sees no improvement in the first half.  To contact the reporter on this story:
