ABN Amro Bank (Ireland) Ltd. asked a
judge to dismiss a lawsuit by the liquidator of Bernard Madoff’s
firm, saying it lost $490 million in the Ponzi scheme, out of
$725 million it invested. As one of the con man’s biggest
losers, “it is simply not plausible” that the bank suspected
fraud, as the trustee alleged, it said in a federal court filing
in Manhattan yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
