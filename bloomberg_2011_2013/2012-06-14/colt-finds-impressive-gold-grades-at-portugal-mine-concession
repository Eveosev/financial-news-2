Colt Resources Inc. (GTP) , an explorer of
gold in  Portugal , found “impressive” mineral grades at Boa Fe
in the south of the country, it said in a  website  statement.  Colt signed a three-year exploration deal with the
government in November to look for gold at Boa Fe, near the town
of Montemor, and plans to start production in early 2014, Chief
Executive Officer Nikolas Perrault said in April.  “Drilling at Boa Fe continues to deliver impressive gold
grades close to surface,” the Montreal-based company said in
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
