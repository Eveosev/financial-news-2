The  New York Knicks  won dismissal of
a lawsuit by Cuttino Mobley, who claimed the team violated laws
against discrimination on the basis of disability when it had
him declared medically ineligible to play.  Mobley, who was diagnosed with a congenital heart defect in
1999, claimed in a suit filed in  Manhattan  federal court that
the  National Basketball Association ’s Knicks should have cleared
him to play or accommodated his condition. The team saved about
$19 million by having him declared ineligible during the 2008-
2009 season, Mobley said in a complaint filed last year.  U.S. District Judge Deborah Batts today dismissed the suit,
ruling that Mobley hadn’t alleged sufficient facts to support
the claim. Batts said Mobley may file an amended complaint.  “Plaintiff has not alleged sufficiently that he was
qualified to perform the essential tasks of a professional
basketball player for the Knicks, and has thus failed to state a
claim upon which relief can be granted,” Batts said in her
opinion.  The case is Mobley v. Madison Square Garden LP, 11-CV-8290,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
