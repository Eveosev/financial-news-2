Indonesia ’s rupiah was steady after
demand for the central bank’s dollar term deposits, which are
aimed at supporting the local currency, fell short of market
expectations.  Government bonds  advanced.  Bank Indonesia accepted $700 million of seven- and 14-day
deposits yesterday at 0.17 percent and 0.18 percent, it said in
a statement, compared with  rates  in the U.S. of 0.22 percent for
one week and 0.23 percent for 15 days. The measure was predicted
to provide an avenue for lenders to bring back an estimated $2
billion a day on average that is now being kept in overseas
banks and reduce volatility in the local currency, Deputy
Governor Halim Alamsyah said May 29.  “Demand was not too strong,” said Klara Pramesti, a
research analyst in the treasury division at PT Bank Negara
Indonesia in Jakarta. “Investors still tend to seek safe havens
so whatever instruments we introduce will not see much effect
until global conditions stabilize.”  The rupiah traded at 9,421 per dollar as of 4:50 p.m. in
Jakarta, having closed at 9,420 yesterday, after earlier
touching an almost one-week low of 9,480, according to prices
from local banks compiled by Bloomberg. One-month implied
volatility, which measures exchange-rate swings used to price
options, lost 50 basis points, or 0.5 percentage point, to 12
percent.  Bank Indonesia  continues to focus on stabilizing the rupiah
and will push for increasing foreign-currency supply in the
market to keep the rupiah in line with regional currencies, it
said in a statement on June 12.  DBS Group Holdings Ltd. lowered its forecast for the
currency to 9,800 for the third quarter, from 9,200 previously
because of  Europe ’s debt crisis, analysts led by  David Carbon 
wrote in a research report today.  The  yield  on the government’s 7 percent bonds due May 2022
dropped one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 6.43
percent, the lowest since May 15, according to prices from the
Inter Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
