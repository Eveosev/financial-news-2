OAO MegaFon,  Russia ’s second-largest
mobile-phone operator, retained six banks for its London initial
public offering this year, which could raise as much as $4
billion, said two people with knowledge of the matter.  The IPO of MegaFon, owned by Russian billionaire  Alisher Usmanov ’s AF Telecom Holding and  Sweden ’s  TeliaSonera AB (TLSN) , could
start as early as September, said the people, who declined to be
identified because the plans are private. Morgan Stanley and
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  have been hired as IPO managers, along
with OAO Sberbank, VTB Group,  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  and
Citigroup Inc., said the people.  At $4 billion, MegaFon’s IPO would be the biggest in  Europe 
since July, when  Spain ’s  Bankia SA (BKIA)  raised $4.4 billion,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. AF Telecom obtained
majority control of Moscow-based MegaFon in April, buying part
of TeliaSonera’s stake and Altimo’s entire shareholding.  Shareholders will sell about 20 percent of MegaFon in the
IPO, one of the people said. The company had 61.6 million
subscribers in Russia at the end of last year, as well as units
in Tajikistan, Abkhazia and Ossetia. It reported net income of
43.6 billion rubles ($1.3 billion) on sales of 242.6 billion
rubles last year.  Pyotr Lidov, a spokesman for MegaFon, declined to comment,
as did spokesmen for  Morgan Stanley (MS)  and Credit Suisse. Spokesmen
for Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Sberbank and VTB were not
immediately available to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
