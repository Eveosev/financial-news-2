The  European Investment Bank  granted
a 350 million-euro ($441 million) loan to Acuamed for water and
sanitation improvements along Spain’s Mediterranean coast, the
first installment of as much as 500 million euros in financing.
The funds will help improve water supply systems, develop
desalination plants, re-use wastewater, improve irrigation and
boost environmental protection in Spain’s five Mediterranean
river basins, including the Ebro, the EIB said today on its
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
