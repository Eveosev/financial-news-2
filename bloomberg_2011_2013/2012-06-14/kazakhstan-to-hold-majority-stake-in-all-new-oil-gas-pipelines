Kazakhstan, the second-biggest oil
producer in the former  Soviet Union , will hold majority stakes
in new, large oil and natural-gas pipelines, according to a law
adopted by parliament.  “The government must have no less than 51 percent in any
new pipelines,” Oil and Gas Minister Sauat Mynbayev told
reporters today in the capital, Astana. The legislation must be
signed by the president before coming into force.  Resource-rich nations are seeking more control over their
energy wealth as international companies flock to tap their oil
and gas fields. The Kazakh law may affect the $39 billion
Kashagan project being developed by  Eni SpA (ENI) ,  Royal Dutch Shell
Plc (RDSA)  and  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  because the partners plan a pipe to
link a treatment plant in Atyrau with Kuryk port, Mynbayev said.  Russia  is the biggest oil producer in the former Soviet
Union.  To contact the reporter on this story:
