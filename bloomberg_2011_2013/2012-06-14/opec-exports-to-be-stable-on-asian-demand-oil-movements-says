Oil exports from the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries will be little changed this month
as Asian refiners increase production, according to tanker-
tracker Oil Movements.  OPEC will ship 23.96 million barrels a day in the four
weeks to June 30, compared with 24.06 million in the period to
June 2, the researcher said today in an e-mailed report. The
data exclude  Angola  and Ecuador. Exports in the period are 5
percent higher than a year, Oil Movements said.  “It is all going east now Asian refineries are out of
maintenance,”  Roy Mason , the company’s founder, said by
telephone from Halifax,  England . “The long-haul eastbound
sailings are aimed at the summer peak of mid-August while
westbound sailings have tailed off.”  Exports from the  Middle East , including non-OPEC members
Oman and Yemen, will slip 0.8 percent to 17.66 million barrels a
day in the four-week period, according to Oil Movements.  Crude on board tankers will average 487.76 million barrels,
up 1.3 percent from the month to June 2, the researcher said.
Oil Movements calculates shipments by tallying tanker-rental
agreements. Its figures exclude crude held on board ships used
as floating storage.  OPEC, which pumps 40 percent of the world’s oil, comprises
Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria,
Qatar,  Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela. The
organization met today in Vienna.  To contact the reporter on this story:
