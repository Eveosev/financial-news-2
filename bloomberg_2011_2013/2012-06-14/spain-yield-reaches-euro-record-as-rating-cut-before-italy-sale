Spain ’s bonds fell, with 10-year
yields rising to a  euro-era record , after Moody’s Investors
Service cut the nation’s credit rating, citing its rising debt
burden and weakening economy.  Spain’s securities extended this week’s decline after the
nation requested as much as 100 billion euros ($126 billion)of
aid for its banks last weekend and after Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  said he would “battle” the  European Central Bank  for
cheap loans to avoid a sovereign bailout. Italy’s bonds rose
after the nation raised its maximum target at a sale of 4.5
billion euros at an auction even as its borrowing costs surged.  The “markets are telling us that they’re unconvinced by
the bank bailout and that the next step is that the government
will have to concede, capitulate, and go for a sovereign loan,”
 James Stewart , head of macro research at AX Markets in London,
said in an interview with  Mark Barton  on Bloomberg Television’s
“Countdown.” “That seems to me quite likely, and even now I
think it’s moving on from Spain to Italy.”  Spain’s 10-year yield climbed 16 basis points, or 0.16
percentage point, to 6.92 percent at 5 p.m. London time after
rising to 6.998 percent, the highest since the  euro was
introduced  in 1999. The 5.85 percent bond due in January 2022
fell 1.07, or 10.70 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 92.64.
The yield has jumped 70 basis points this week.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Spanish 10-year
bonds instead of similar-maturity bunds widened 16 basis points
to 543 basis points after reaching 551 basis points, also a
euro-era record.  Moody’s Cuts  Moody’s lowered Spain’s credit rating to Baa3, one step
above junk, from A3 and put it on review for a further
downgrade. The request for aid from the European Union to
recapitalize its banking system adds to the government’s debt
load, the rating company said yesterday.  Moody’s also lowered Cyprus’s bond rating, saying there was
a rising likelihood of a Greek exit from the euro area, and a
increase in the probable amount of support the government may
have to extend to Cypriot banks.  Greece  will hold an election on June 17 that may lead to it
becoming the first nation to exit the 17-nation currency union.  Rajoy yesterday called for the ECB to buy Spanish
government debt to ease the government’s interest costs in a
letter to European Commission President  Jose Manuel Barroso .  “That is the battle we have to wage in  Europe ,” Rajoy
told Parliament in  Madrid . “I am waging it.”  German  10-year yields  were little changed at 1.49 percent.
They dropped to a record 1.127 percent on June 1.  Bank Borrowing  Spanish lenders’ net average borrowings from the ECB rose
to a record 287.8 billion euros in May from 263.5 billion euros
in April, Bank of Spain data showed today.  While a 10-year yield of seven percent “is a
psychologically significant level for the market, it isn’t
necessarily for Spain’s funding program,” Lyn Graham-Taylor, a
fixed-income strategist at Rabobank International in  London ,
said in an interview with  Guy Johnson  on Bloomberg Television’s
“The Pulse.” “It only reinforces a further selloff when
people see a 7 percent level.”  Italy’s  10-year yield  fell nine basis points to 6.13
percent, after advancing to 6.34 percent, the highest level
since Jan. 20.  The nation sold 3 billion euros of three-year notes at an
average yield of 5.30 percent, up from 3.91 percent at the
previous auction on May 14. Investors bid for 1.59 times the
amount allotted, versus 1.52 times last month. It sold 4.5
billion euros of debt in total, meeting its maximum target.  Yield Trend  “These auctions will be judged a success in the short
term, but the trend in yields and spreads is something which
requires something from the policy-maker level to reverse,”
said  Peter Chatwell , a fixed-income strategist at Credit
Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in London.  The trend in  Italy ’s government bond futures is “bearish
while they trade below the 99.32 mid-point” of their decline
from 102.21 on June 7 and the low of 96.43 on June 12,  Richard Adcock , head of fixed-income technical strategy in London at UBS
AG in London, wrote in a note to clients. “As long as this
remains the case the expectation is for limited bounces and
further price weakness.”  The contracts rose 0.8 percent to 97.84 after dropping as
much as 0.9 percent to 96.21.  Spanish bonds have handed investors a loss of 5.6 percent
this year, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German debt
returned 2.5 percent, and Italian bonds rose 5.4 percent.  Volatility of French bonds was the highest in the euro-area
markets today followed by Spain and  Austria , according to
measures of 10-year debt, the spread between two- and 10-year
securities and credit-default swaps.  To contact the reporters on this story:
