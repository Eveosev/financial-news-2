South Korea ’s  National Pension
Service  plans to spend 6.6 trillion won ($5.7 billion) buying
more of the nation’s stocks next year, signaling its support for
equities amid  Europe ’s worsening debt crisis.  The nation’s biggest investor will increase the weighting
of domestic stocks in its holdings to 20 percent of assets in
2013, the  Ministry of Health and Welfare , which oversees the
fund, said in an e-mailed statement today. That compares with
its 2012 target of 19.3 percent. The fund aims to pare its
domestic bond weighting to 56.1 percent of assets in 2013, less
than the 59.3 percent it targeted for this year.  The pension fund, which had about $300 billion of assets at
the end of March, is boosting investments in equities even as
investors favored less risky assets at a time of increasing
concerns over Europe and the strength of the global economy. An
index of South Korean  government bonds  compiled by HSBC Holdings
Plc returned 2.59 percent this year through yesterday, outpacing
a 1.8 percent gain in the benchmark  Kospi index  of stocks.  “The higher weighting in stocks is of course positive
given that the fund’s investment is serving as a good support to
the market amid ongoing volatility in financial markets stemming
from Europe,” Kim Jae Dong, head of equities at SEI Asset  Korea 
Co., which manages about $5.3 billion in assets, said by phone
today. “Compared with other overseas pensions, NPS’s stock
weighting is still low and I think it’s taking a right approach
to continue diversifying its assets.”  Europe Turmoil  The Kospi slumped 7 percent last month, the most since
August, amid growing concern the debt crisis in Europe will hurt
overseas shipments. The European Union accounts for 10 percent
of South Korean exports, government data show. The Group of 20
nations will meet in  Mexico  on June 18-19 to discuss the crisis,
which deepened after Moody’s Investors Service downgraded Spain
and Cyprus’s credit ratings.  The  International Monetary Fund  this week lowered its 2012
forecast for South Korea’s economic growth to 3.25 percent from
3.5 percent, citing “substantial” uncertainty due to Europe’s
deepening debt turmoil. The  Bank of Korea  kept borrowing costs
unchanged for a 12th straight month on June 8.  The Kospi closed 0.7 percent higher at 1,871.48 today,
paring its slump in the past three months to 8.5 percent.  The gauge trades for 9.6 times estimated profit, below its
four-year average of 10.9 times, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That compares with a multiple of 9.9 for the MSCI
 Emerging Markets  Index and 8.4 for the MSCI BRIC Index, which
tracks  Brazil ,  Russia ,  India  and China.  Overseas Investments  The National Pension Service plans to have 9.3 percent of
assets in overseas equities next year, the welfare ministry
said, up from the 8.1 percent targeted for 2012. The fund’s size
is expected to grow to 430 trillion won by the end of 2013 from
365 trillion won as of March.  The service aims to have 4 percent of assets in overseas
bonds next year, the ministry said, down from 4.1 percent in
2012. The pension fund plans to raise its weighting of so-called
alternative investments to 10.6 percent of assets in 2013, from
its target this year of 9.2 percent.  “We will keep our management direction of diversifying
assets and expanding overseas investments,” according to
today’s statement from the welfare ministry.  National Pension’s overseas investments include stakes in
Colonial Pipeline Co. in the U.S., Berlin’s Sony Center,
 London ’s Gatwick Airport, and HSBC’s London headquarters. The
fund was set up in 1988 to manage pensions for private-sector
employees and the self-employed.  -- Editors: Darren Boey, Richard Frost  To contact the reporter on this story:
