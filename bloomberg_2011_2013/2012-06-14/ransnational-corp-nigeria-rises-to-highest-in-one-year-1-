Transnational Corp. of Nigeria Plc ,
which has investments in hotels, agriculture and oil, rose to
its highest price in more than one year.  The stock gained a ninth day, rising 2.2 percent to 1.42
naira by the close in Lagos, the commercial capital, its highest
since April 27, 2011.  Transcorp, as the company is called, has more than doubled
in price this year, compared with a 2.2 percent rise in the
Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share Index over the same period.  The Lagos-based company plans to build eight hotels that
trade under the Hilton brand in  Africa â€™s most populous country
to take advantage of a surge in business visitors, Chief
Executive Officer Obinna Ufudo said in an interview on May 25.
The company, which runs the Transcorp Hilton Hotel in Abuja, is
expanding a partnership in which McLean, Virginia-based Hilton
Worldwide Inc. provides its brand names and management for
hotels built by Transcorp, said Ufudo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
