The wholesale premium gasoline price
in Santiago will drop 20.2 pesos, or 2.5 percent, per liter in
the week through June 20, according to Bloomberg calculations
based on prices distributed by the state-owned oil refiner.  Low-octane gasoline will fall 2.1 percent. Refiner Empresa
Nacional del Petroleo released prices by e-mail yesterday.  The price of a liter of low-octane gasoline has declined 50
pesos since April, which is “very good news for consumers,”
Finance Minister Felipe Larrain said in an e-mailed statement.  The forwards market for unidades de fomento,  Chile ’s
inflation-linked accounting unit, was yesterday pricing in a
0.03 percent increase in consumer prices in June and 2.4 percent
annual inflation in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
