The EU Commission plans tougher CO2
emission target caps for new cars from 2020 onwards,  Die Welt 
reported, citing a guideline draft by EU Climate Commissioner
Connie Hedegaard,  Heavy car producers will be affected most as the draft
foresees a smaller factor accounting for the weight of the car,
the newspaper said. As a result, producers of heavy cars will
have to reduce their CO2 emission more than previously
anticipated, Die Welt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
