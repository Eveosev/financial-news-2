JA Solar Holdings Co. (JASO) ,  China ’s
largest solar-cell maker, rose after announcing it may
repurchase as much as $100 million worth of its American
depository receipts.  JA Solar’s ADRs advanced 13 percent to $1.06 at the close
in New York, paring gains after earlier rising as much as 25
percent, the most intraday since Jan. 11. Each ADR is worth one
ordinary share.  The buyback is effective immediately and lasts through
Sept. 30, 2012, according to a company statement today.  Chief Executive Officer Peng Fang said June 12 the company
may produce outside of China to avoid U.S. anti-dumping tariffs.
The U.S. Commerce Department, in preliminary findings announced
May 17, said Chinese companies must pay solar-product import
tariffs of 31 percent to 250 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
