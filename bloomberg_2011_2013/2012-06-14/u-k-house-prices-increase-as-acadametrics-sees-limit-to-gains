U.K. house prices rose the most in
nine months in May, according to Acadametrics Ltd., which said
the gain may not signal the start of a rebound by the country’s
property market.  The average price of a home in England and  Wales  climbed
0.5 percent from April to 223,207 pounds ($347,100),
Acadametrics and  LSL Property Services Plc (LSL)  said in a report in
London today. From a year earlier, values gained 1.9 percent.  Further gains may be limited by higher  mortgage rates  as
banks’ funding costs increase and by mounting threats to the
economy from the sovereign debt crisis in  Europe . Acadametrics
Chairman Peter Williams said the housing market may struggle to
return to a “more buoyant state” as banks curtail lending to
improve their balance sheets.  “Given the very considerable uncertainty that now exists
around the euro and is feeding into wider global financial
markets, it is hard to anticipate when a more positive home
ownership market may exist,” he said in the report.  Out of the 10 regions tracked by Acadametrics and LSL, all
apart from  London , Wales and East Midlands saw their average
values decline in the last three months compared with the same
period a year earlier.  Acadametrics and LSL said the number of transactions in May
was probably 60,000, which is 67 percent of the long-term
average for the month. The groups combine initial transaction
data from the  Land Registry  and results from other price
measures for their index of values.  To contact the reporter on this story:
