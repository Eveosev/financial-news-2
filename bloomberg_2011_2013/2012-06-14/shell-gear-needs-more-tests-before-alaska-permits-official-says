Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  must complete
more tests of its safety equipment before the U.S. lets the
company drill for oil off the north coast of  Alaska , a regulator
said.  The examinations, which will verify whether Shell is able
to stop the flow of oil in case of a blowout, will take place in
coming weeks,  James Watson , director of the Interior
Department’s Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement,
said today during a conference call.  “These tests must be successful before we approve any
drilling activities, because safety is a must and it’s our No. 1
priority,” Watson said in Portland, Oregon, after looking over
equipment to be used when a well fails.  “There are still a
number of inspections by BSEE and the U.S. Coast Guard” on
Shell’s equipment.  Shell, based in  The Hague , is counting down the weeks or
days as it awaits the final of 35 permits needed to start
exploration in Alaska’s Chukchi and Beaufort seas. Due to ice,
the company can only drill in the Arctic when ice has cleared,
typically from July until October.  Steve Phelps, Shell Alaska manager for exploration and
appraisal, told reporters June 12 that thick ice has formed in
the region and will delay the start of any drilling by about two
weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
