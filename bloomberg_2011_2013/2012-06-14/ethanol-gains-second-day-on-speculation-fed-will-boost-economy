Ethanol gained for a second day in
 Chicago  on speculation that a sputtering  U.S. economy  will lead
the  Federal Reserve  to loosen monetary policy.  Futures rose after the Labor Department said jobless
benefit claims climbed by 6,000 to 386,000 in the week ended
June 9 and consumer prices fell by the most in three years.
Ethanol followed equities higher on predictions that the Fed
will act to stimulate growth.  “That’s what we’ve been conditioned to think,” said
Peyton Feltus, president of Randolph Risk Management Inc. in
 Dallas . “Not just the Fed, but central banks in general. That’s
what everybody thinks will happen.”  Denatured ethanol for July delivery gained 1.5 cents, or
0.7 percent, to settle at $2.065 a gallon on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Prices have fallen 6.3 percent this year.  In spot market trading, ethanol in  New York  soared 7 cents,
or 3.4 percent, to $2.115 a gallon and in Chicago the additive
rose 5.5 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $2.045, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf gained 4.5 cents, or 2.2 percent,
to $2.105 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel increased 2
cents, or 0.9 percent, to $2.175.  The biofuel is made from corn in the U.S. and blended with
gasoline to stretch supply and meet federal mandates to decrease
consumption of fossil fuels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
