Peru’s dollar-denominated bonds
rose, pushing yields to a record low, amid speculation the
 Federal Reserve  may take further measures to spur growth,
boosting demand for higher-yielding, emerging-market debt.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 6.55 percent bond due
in March 2037 declined one basis point, or 0.01 percentage
point, to 4.30 percent at 12:32 p.m. in Lima. The bond’s price
rose 0.25 cent to 134 cents per dollar.  “Peru is still a very solid and relatively low-risk
investment and its bonds have a higher yield than U.S.
Treasuries,” said Juan Pablo Fuentes, a Latin America economist
at Moody’s Analytics Inc. in  West Chester , Pennsylvania. “Some
people don’t think the situation in Europe is going to get worse
and are ready to invest in  emerging markets .”  U.S. stocks rose as investors increased bets Fed policy
makers meeting next week will take additional steps to spur
growth after initial claims for jobless benefits unexpectedly
increased last week.  Peru’s sol rose 0.3 percent to 2.6685 per  U.S. dollar ,
according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
