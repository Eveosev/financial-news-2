Canadian natural gas jumped the most
in more than four years after a U.S. government report showed a
smaller-than-expected gain in supplies last week.  July gas in  Alberta  surged 15 percent, the most since at
least Dec. 19, 2007, when NGX, a Canadian internet market, began
detailed records. The Energy Department said U.S.  stockpiles 
expanded by 67 billion cubic feet to 2.944 trillion. Analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg showed an expected increase of
75 billion. The five-year average stockpile gain for the week is
88 billion cubic feet.  “It was storage-initiated and then you had various short-
buying over the next three hours,” Carl Neill, a consultant
with Risk Management Inc. in Atlanta, said in a telephone
interview. “The market has been in a down trend where it lost
over 70 cents, so it was a little oversold.”  Alberta gas for July delivery gained 24.25 cents to C$1.92
a gigajoule ($1.78 per million British thermal units) as of 3:45
p.m. New York time. Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to
users in  Canada  and the U.S. and priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s
Alberta system. NGX gas is down 27 percent this year.  Natural gas for July delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  gained 31 cents to settle at $2.495 per million Btu.  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near  Chicago  rose
1.75 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $2.2128 per million Btu on the
 Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an express line that can
carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day from western Canada.  Spot Prices  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas advanced 6.18 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $2.0198
per million Btu. At Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded
for California markets, prices gained 4.99 cents, or 2.4
percent, to $2.1111.  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta system , which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.4 billion cubic
feet at 3:30 p.m.  New York  time.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.08 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 1.82 billion cubic feet.  The available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia
system at  Kingsgate  was 723 million cubic feet. The system was
forecast to carry 1.83 billion cubic feet today, or 72 percent
of normal capacity of 2.55 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy ’s British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.78
billion cubic feet at 2:50 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
