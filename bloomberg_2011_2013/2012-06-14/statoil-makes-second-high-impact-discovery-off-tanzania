Statoil ASA (STL) ,  Norway ’s largest oil
and gas producer, said it made a second “high-impact” gas find
off Tanzania.  The Lavani discovery contains an estimated 3 trillion cubic
feet of gas, or 530 million barrels of oil equivalent, Statoil
said in a statement today. The company also said a side-track
well to its recent Zafarani discovery had added 1 trillion cubic
feet to reserves estimated at 5 trillion cubic feet in February.  “The results so far mark an important step towards a
possible natural gas development in Tanzania,” Statoil’s
executive vice president for exploration Tim Dodson said in the
statement. Lavani, 16 kilometers (10 miles) south of Zafarani,
“confirms the high potential in Block 2,” he said.  Statoil, which is 67 percent owned by the Norwegian
government, is expanding abroad in a bid to boost reserves as
output dwindles at aging offshore fields at home. The Lavani
discovery is Statoil’s seventh high-impact find, defined as
containing more than an estimated 250 million barrels of oil
equivalent, in the last 14 months.  Statoil operates Block 2 off Tanzania with a 65 percent
interest, while  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  holds the remaining 35
percent. Tanzania  Petroleum Development Corp. (PETD)  has a right to a
10 percent working interest if the project moves to development.  To contact the reporter on this story:
