German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  will
meet the country’s state premiers today to try to break an
impasse on Europe’s fiscal pact caused by clashes over budgets,
 Sueddeutsche Zeitung  reported, without citing anyone.  North Rhine-Westphalia and Rhineland-Palatinate are leading
states that want the federal government to gradually assume an
annual 12.5 billion euros ($15.7 billion) in aid for disabled
people currently paid by municipalities and to temporarily allow
German states to run higher budget deficits, the Munich-based
newspaper said.  While German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble opposes
those demands, failure to meet them could delay approval of the
fiscal pact in the upper house of parliament rather than cause
it to fail, Sueddeutsche reported, citing unidentified people
close to governments in states run by the opposition  Social
Democratic Party .  To contact the reporter on this story:
