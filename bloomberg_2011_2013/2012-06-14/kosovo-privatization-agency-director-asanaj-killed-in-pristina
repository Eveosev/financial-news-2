Dino Asanaj, director of the  Kosovo
privatization agency , was stabbed to death by unknown assailants
in the capital Pristina.  Asanaj, who was also a U.S. citizen, died of knife wounds
after the attack in his office in the so-called international
village in the city, medical doctor Mehmet Maxhuni said today in
a phone interview. Police confirmed the attack, without
providing details.  The privatization agency, established in 2008 when the
former Serbian province declared independence, is governed by
the Kosovo assembly and is in charge of selling state assets to
investors, according to its website.  “I condemn this brutal act, which is an attack on overall
security and rule of law in Kosovo,” Samuel Zbogar, the
European Union’s special representative to  Kosovo , said in an e-
mailed statement. “I call on judiciary and security authorities
to do their utmost and bring the perpetrators in front of
justice.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
