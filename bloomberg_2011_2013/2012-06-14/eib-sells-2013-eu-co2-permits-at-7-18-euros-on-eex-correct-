(Corrects name of exchange in headline.)  The  European Investment Bank  sold
625,000 European Union carbon permits for 2013 delivery at 7.18
euros ($9.05) a metric ton in its fifth auction on the European
Energy Exchange AG, according to data on the bourseâ€™s website.  EEX is hosting four auctions per week for the EIB in June
and July, selling a total of 20 million allowances from a
special post-2012 reserve known as the NER300. Revenue from the
sales will aid clean-energy projects in the 27-nation bloc.
Until the end of May the EIB had sold NER300 permits in over-
the-counter and exchange-based trades.  To contact the reporter on this story:
