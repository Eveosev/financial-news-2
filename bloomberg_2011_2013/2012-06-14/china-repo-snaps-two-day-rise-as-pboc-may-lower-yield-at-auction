China ’s benchmark money-market rate
was little changed, halting a two-day advance, as the central
bank lowered  yields  on  repurchase agreements  for the second sale
this week.  The People’s Bank of China sold 15 billion  yuan  ($2.4
billion) of 91-day repos at 3.05 percent today, according to a
trader at a primary dealer required to bid at the auctions. The
yield was 3.14 percent a week ago. The monetary authority cut
the rate on 28-day repos by five basis points to 2.75 percent on
June 12.  “As the liquidity outlook remains bumpy ahead of the half-
year end, the repo curve will struggle to go down much
further,” said Weisheng He, a fixed-income strategist at
Citigroup Inc. in Shanghai. “I feel the market is still looking
for a reserve-requirement cut in the near term.”  The  seven-day repurchase rate , a gauge of funding
availability in the financial system, traded at 2.70 percent in
 Shanghai , according to a weighted average compiled by the
National Interbank Funding Center. It earlier fell as much as
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point.  Slowing inflation will provide room for the PBOC to lower
its 28- and 91-day repo rates in open-market operations, Jiang Fei, an analyst at China Merchants Securities, wrote in a note
to clients today. In 2008, the central bank cut the 28-day repo
rate to 0.9 percent, below banks’ funding costs, in order to
force lenders to extend loans or buy bonds amid deflation.  The People’s Bank of China will auction 60 billion yuan of
three-month treasury deposits to commercial banks on June 19,
according to a statement on its website today. The  finance
ministry  said it will sell 30 billion yuan of 10-year  government
bonds  on June 20, according to its website.  The one-year swap rate, the fixed cost needed to receive
the seven-day repurchase rate, fell two basis points to 2.57
percent in Shanghai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The yield on 2.87 percent government bonds due February 2013
declined one basis point to 2.158 percent.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
