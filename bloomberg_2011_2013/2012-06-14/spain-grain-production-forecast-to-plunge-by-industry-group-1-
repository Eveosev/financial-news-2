Spain ’s barley and soft-wheat
production is forecast to plunge 32 percent this year after dry
weather hurt the crops, farm and food-industry group
Cooperativas Agro-Alimentarias forecast.  Total winter-grain output may fall 33 percent to 11.4
million metric tons from 17.1 million tons in 2011, the Madrid-
based group  reported  on its website today. The soft-wheat
harvest will slip to 4.12 million tons from 6.1 million tons in
2011, while barley is predicted to fall to 5.67 million tons
from 8.3 million tons, the group said.  Spain is the European Union’s second-largest grain
importer, behind  Italy , data from the International Trade Center
show. The Spanish grain harvest fluctuates depending on weather
conditions.  “This big decline reflects the difficult agronomic cycle
from which grains suffered this season, with an excessively dry
winter, somewhat late rain in April and too much heat in the
months of May and June,” Cooperativas Agro-Alimentarias wrote.  Castilla-Leon, the biggest wheat-growing region in Spain,
is also expected to show the biggest drop in production, with
the soft-wheat crop slumping 41 percent to 1.71 million tons.
The biggest drop in barley production is forecast for
Extremadura, with output slumping 57 percent to 48,263 tons.  The production slide will make for a “very complicated”
grains balance sheet in 2012-13, according to the group.  “As Spain is a country with a grain deficit, any decline
in our harvest will complicate the supply of grain to meet
demand,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
