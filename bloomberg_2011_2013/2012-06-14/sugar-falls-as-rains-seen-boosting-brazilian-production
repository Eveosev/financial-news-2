Sugar fell for a third day in  New
York  on speculation that rains causing harvest delays in Brazil
will help boost production later in the season. Cocoa advanced,
and coffee declined.  Rainfall delayed harvesting and shipments last week from
the main growing areas in Brazil, the world’s largest sugar
grower and exporter, sending prices up 4.7 percent.
Precipitation may be beneficial to cane fields in the long-run
because the plants will grow more, Naim Beydoun, a broker at
Swiss Sugar Brokers, said by telephone from Rolle, Switzerland.  “The upside momentum has seemingly stalled,”  Thomas Kujawa , the co-head of soft commodities at Sucden Financial
Ltd., wrote in a report e-mailed today. “The trades seem to be
all gearing up for a strong  Brazil  tail to the crop.”  Raw sugar for October delivery fell 0.9 percent to settle
at 19.51 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York. Refined-sugar futures for August delivery dropped 0.3
percent to $566.70 a metric ton on NYSE Liffe in  London .  Cocoa futures for September delivery advanced 0.2 percent
to $2,263 a ton in New York.  Arabica-coffee futures for September delivery slid 2
percent to $1.5105 a pound on ICE.  In London, cocoa rose, and robusta coffee was little
changed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
