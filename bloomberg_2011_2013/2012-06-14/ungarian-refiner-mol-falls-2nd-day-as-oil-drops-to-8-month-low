Mol Nyrt. (MOL) , the biggest oil refiner
in Hungary, fell for a second day as the commodity traded close
to its lowest price in eight months and a three-notch downgrade
of Spainâ€™s credit rating drove investors from riskier assets.  The stock dropped 1.1 percent to 15,970 forint as of 12:25
p.m. in Budapest, adding to a 2.1 percent retreat yesterday. The
 BUX (BUX)  index of 11 equities, where Mol has a 32 percent weighting,
declined 0.2 percent today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
