Suntech Power Holdings Co. and  Trina
Solar Ltd (TSL) , the largest and fourth-biggest solar-panel makers,
said  Germany  may install as much as seven gigawatts of the
devices this year.  “Our numbers say that somewhere between 6 and 7 gigawatts
is still achievable this year in Germany,” Jerry Stokes,
Suntech’s European unit president, said today in an interview in
Munich. Trina Chief Executive Officer Jifan Gao said in a
separate interview that “it’s possible” the market in Germany
will reach that level.  Germany, the world’s second-biggest solar market in 2011
behind  Italy , installed about 2.3 gigawatts in the first four
months of the year.  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s government wants
to reduce the pace of annual installations by about half after
new projects peaked at 7.5 gigawatts last year.  The government and the country’s 16 federal states are in
talks over proposed cuts to solar subsidies after state leaders
last month blocked a plan for aid reductions of as much as 29
percent on concern the legislation will hurt domestic
manufacturers including  Solarworld AG (SWV)  that are already suffering
from Chinese competition.  “As the feed-in tariffs become clear, and one element
almost certainly will be that large ground-mounted projects will
be discouraged, it will grow people’s confidence in the
residential sector,” Suntech’s Stokes said.  The BSW-Solar industry lobby said in April it expected an
installation rally that may last through September developers
try to beat planned subsidy cuts.  To contact the reporters on this story:
