Tsugami Corp. (6101)  fell the most in
almost five years in Tokyo trading after Citigroup Inc. said
orders for the company’s machine tools are slowing since peaking
in March.  Tsugami shares fell as much as 12 percent, the most since
Aug. 17, 2007, to 479 yen on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The stock
fell 11 percent to 485 yen as of 10:39 a.m. The Topix Machinery
Index declined 0.8 percent.  Demand has slowed from most customers, including suppliers
to Apple Inc., Graeme McDonald, a Tokyo-based analyst at
Citigroup Global Markets Japan Inc., wrote in a report dated
yesterday. Orders for machinery tools used in the car industry
have slowed, while demand for machines used to make hard-disk
drive components have yet to materialize, McDonald wrote, citing
Tsugami’s chief executive officer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
