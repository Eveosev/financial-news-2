Treasuries fell as the U.S. sold $13
billion of 30-year bonds at a record low yield and traders
speculation whether global central banks will coordinate
assistance if Greek elections increase financial market turmoil.  Yields climbed after Reuters reported that policy makers
are preparing for unified action as they gather this weekend for
a summit in  Mexico , citing officials linked to the Group of 20
nations. Prices have swung between gains and losses as investors
debated whether the refuge appeal of U.S. government debt
outweighs buying with yields close to record lows.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
