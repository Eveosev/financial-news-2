The U.K. offshore wind industry
attracted 1.95 billion pounds ($3 billion) of investment in the
last financial year as the government boosted the technology to
curb emissions and secure energy supplies, Energy Secretary Ed
Davey said today.  The minister, speaking at an offshore wind conference in
 London , said the U.K. was on track to meet a target of getting
15 percent of its energy from renewable sources by 2020. More
wind power was needed to help bring the cost of clean
electricity for consumers down, he said.  A “truly competitive” cost of offshore wind power
electricity was less than a decade away, he said. “It is time
for us to see what it is,” Davey said. “An industry of
strategic national importance, one that can help us secure our
energy supplies, reduce our dependence on imported fossil fuels
and protect our environment -- an industry on which our clean
energy future rests.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
