Loyola University Maryland lacrosse
player Adam Pomper died two days ago, the Baltimore-based school
said. He was 18.  The Suffolk County,  New York , police department
investigated the freshman’s death on June 12 and ruled it was
non-criminal, the Baltimore Sun reported, citing a department
spokesman. Pomper lived in Huntington, New York.  Pomper, a member of the class of 2015, was a communications
major. He played in one game for the Greyhounds, who won their
first national championship this season, appearing in a 17-6 win
over Hobart on April 21.  “As a coach and father, my heart goes out to Adam’s family
and friends,” coach Charley Toomey said on the school’s
website. “I don’t know that there are words adequate to
describe the feelings of loss and grief we feel in the Loyola
lacrosse family.”  Loyola went 18-1 this season and last month beat Maryland
9-3 to win the title.  To contact the reporter on this story:
