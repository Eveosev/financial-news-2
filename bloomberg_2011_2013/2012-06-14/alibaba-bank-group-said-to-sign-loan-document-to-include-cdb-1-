Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. asked the
group of 19 banks providing a $3 billion loan to sign a version
of the inter-creditor agreement that includes  China  Development
Bank Corp., three people familiar with the matter said.  A second version allows for the later inclusion of funding
from unspecified additional lenders, the people said, asking not
to be identified because the details are private.  Alibaba, China’s largest e-commerce provider, will tell the
banks tomorrow which version of the agreement will be used, the
people said. The funding will be used for Alibaba to privatize
its Hong Kong-listed unit,  Alibaba.com Ltd. (1688) , and to help it buy
back a stake of about 20 percent owned by Yahoo! Inc., another
person familiar with the matter said May 23.  John Spelich, a spokesman for Alibaba, was unable to
immediately comment when asked about the financing today. Feng
Qihua, a Beijing-based spokeswoman for CDB, couldn’t be reached
when called on her mobile phone today.  Alibaba signed the $3 billion loan with a syndicate of 19
banks yesterday. The facility is split into $2 billion of bridge
lending and a $1 billion three-year term loan.  The borrower is seeking as much as $2 billion of funding
from CDB, said the person who spoke on May 23. The loan from CDB
may be used to replace all or part of the bridge lending, the
person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
