Dubai’s benchmark  DFM General Index (DFMGI) 
fell 1 percent to 1,463.73 at the close in the emirate, the
lowest since June 7. The gauge was little changed this week.
Qatar’s  QE Index (DSM)  slipped 0.1 percent as Saudi Arabia’s market
was closed for the weekend.  The following shares were active in the Persian Gulf
region. Stock symbols are in parentheses.  Emirates Telecommunications Corp. (ETISALAT)   rose 0.7
percent to 9.24 dirhams, the highest since March 26. The stock
rallied 4.8 percent this week, the biggest such gain since March
2011. The largest publicly-traded company in the United Arab
Emirates rose on bets the government may permit foreigners to
buy the shares after Emarat Alyoum reported on its website that
a law that governs Etisalat may be amended.  The company on June 7 said it’s not aware of any such
decision.  Industries Qatar QSC (IQCD)  , the second-biggest
petrochemicals maker in the Middle East, rose 1.2 percent, the
most since May 22, to 133.6 riyals. Crude for July delivery rose
as much as 0.6 percent to $83.08 a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
