Light-distillate stockpiles in
Singapore,  Asia â€™s biggest oil-trading, refining and storage
center, rose to the highest level since February, according to a
unit of the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore stockpiles of naphtha, gasoline and reformate
gained 1.45 million barrels, or 15 percent, to 11.46 million
barrels in the seven days ended June 13, International
Enterprise Singapore said in an e-mailed statement today. That
was the third weekly increase and the highest level since the
week ended Feb. 29.  Supplies of gasoil and kerosene increased for a second
week, climbing 364,000 barrels, or 4.1 percent to 9.33 million
barrels, according to the data.  Residual-fuel inventories, including  fuel oil  and low-
sulfur waxy residue and excluding bitumen, fell for a second
week, dropping 148,000 barrels, or 0.7 percent, to 19.6 million
barrels.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
