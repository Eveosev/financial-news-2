The following table shows  China ’s
emergency-crude storage sites.  The country plans to build reserves in three phases to hold
the equivalent of 100 days of net imports by 2020. That’s about
600 million barrels, based on China’s  imports  of 6 million
barrels a day last month. The U.S. held 696 million barrels in
its Strategic Petroleum Reserve as of June 1, Energy Information
Administration data show.  China finished building the first phase of its storage in
2009 and spent an average $58 a barrel buying crude for the
stockpiles in 2008, according to the National Energy
Administration in a statement on June 1, 2009. Construction of
the second phase will be completed this year, China National
Petroleum Corp., the nation’s biggest oil company, said January.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
