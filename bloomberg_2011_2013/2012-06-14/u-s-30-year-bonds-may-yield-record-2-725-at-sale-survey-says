The Treasury’s $13 billion sale of
30-year bonds may draw a record low  yield  of 2.725 percent,
according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of
eight of the  Federal Reserve ’s 21 primary dealers.  The securities, which mature in May 2042, yielded 2.725
percent in pre-auction trading. Bids are due by 1 p.m.  New York 
time. The yield at last month’s long-bond auction was 3.09
percent. The record low was 2.925 percent at the Dec. 14 sale.  The May 10 offering’s  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges
demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was
2.73, versus an average of 2.66 at the past 10 sales.  Indirect bidders , a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 33.8 percent of the bonds at the
May sale, compared with 30.7 percent at the April auction. The
average for the past 10 offerings is 29.6 percent.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 15.4 percent at
last month’s sale. The average at the past 10 auctions is 16.9
percent.  Thirty-year bonds have returned 5.1 percent this year,
compared with a 1.9 percent gain in the broader U.S. Treasuries
market, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  Today’s auction is the last of three Treasury note and bond
offerings this week totaling $66 billion. The U.S. sold $21
billion of  10-year debt  yesterday at a record low yield of 1.622
percent and $32 billion of three-year notes on June 12.  The sales will raise $35.3 billion of new cash as maturing
securities held by the public total $30.7 billion, according to
the  U.S. Treasury .  Primary dealers trade  government securities  with the
central bank and are obliged to participate in Treasury sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
