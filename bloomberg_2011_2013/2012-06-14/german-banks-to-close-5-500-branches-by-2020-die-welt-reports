Germany â€™s banks will close 15
percent of their branches, or about 5,500 outlets, by 2020 as
more customers use the Internet for banking,  Die Welt  reported,
citing a study by Investors Marketing Services.  The closing of 464 branches by private lenders, savings
banks and building societies in 2011 means the number of outlets
has been cut to 37,719, from 67,920 in 1995, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
