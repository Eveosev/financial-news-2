Total  Nigeria  Plc, which distributes
and markets fuel and petroleum products, fell to its lowest
price in almost three years on concern profit growth will trail
other industries as demand wanes, Vetiva Capital Management
said.  The stock fell 5 percent, the daily limit, to 125.41 naira,
the lowest since August 2009, by the close in Lagos.  “Investors who hold positions on that stock may have
decided to sell to seek more lucrative returns in other
attractive sectors,” Pabina Yinkere, head of research at
Vetiva, said by phone from Lagos today. “It will take some time
for petrol demand to ramp up to where it was.”  The government raised the price of gasoline on Jan. 1 to 97
naira a liter from 65 naira, saying the move was necessary to
end a subsidy on local consumption that was costing about 1.7
trillion naira a year. Government’s initial effort to double the
price was resisted by labor and civil society organizations that
organized a nationwide strike. Despite this, the government says
the price will be raised further.  Only  oil companies  that are “well-diversified” can still
show growth, according to Yinkere. “But for those that are
purely in petrol marketing, the outlook is not great,” he said.
Total is not one of the diversified oil marketing companies in
Nigeria, he said.  Total Nigeria forecast profit of 1.8 billion naira ($293
million) for the nine months through September on revenue of
54.5 billion naira, according to a statement by the Lagos-based
unit of  Total SA (FP)  published on the  Nigerian Stock Exchange 
website June 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
