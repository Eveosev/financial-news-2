Russia ’s Stavropol region may have
lost 2.5 million to 3 million metric tons of grain crops due to
frost and drought, the local farm ministry said.  The loss is estimated at 17.4 billion rubles ($530
million), the ministry said on its website, citing Anatoly
Kutsenko, first deputy agriculture minister. Stavropol’s harvest
area this year will decline 111,000 hectares (about 274,300
acres) from a year earlier, Kutsenko said in the statement
without giving last year’s reaping area figure.  Stavropol had Russia’s second-biggest regional grain crop
last year after gathering 8.2 million tons of cereals, or 8.7
percent of the national harvest, according to state statistics.  Rain is forecast in Stavropol tomorrow and hail on
June 16 and June 17, according to Russia’s Federal
Hydrometeorological Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
