Skanska Financial Services AB, a
unit of the Nordic region’s biggest construction company  Skanska
AB (SKAB) , said it signed a 600 million-euro ($755 million) revolving
credit facility to refinance existing debt.  The five-year loan will replace the Stockholm-based
company’s 750 million-euro facility signed in 2007 and due to
mature in June 2014, facility agent SEB AB said in an e-mailed
statement.  Nordea Bank AB (NDA)  and Svenska Handelsbanken AB arranged the
debt as bookrunners, along with SEB, the banks said. Nine
additional lenders participated in the loan syndicate as
mandated lead arrangers.  In a revolving credit, money can be borrowed again once
it’s repaid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
