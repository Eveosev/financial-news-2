EON AG (EOAN)  has missed out on potential
savings by slowly integrating its accounting and personnel
management units, the Financial Times Deutschland reported,
citing an internal document from Hackett Benchmarking.  EON lags behind competitors in centralizing operations in
the units, the newspaper said. The company plans to concentrate
accounting and personnel management in Berlin by 2015 and in
Cluj, Romania.  To contact the reporter on this story:
