Algeria plans to spend 3 billion
dinars ($38.6 million) on improving its wheat storage capacity,
the state-run APS news agency reported today, citing Agriculture
Minister Rachid Benaissa.  The improvements are needed to deal with an anticipated
gain in the crop, the minister was cited as saying. The country
will produce about 6.5 million metric tons of wheat this year,
surpassing the record 6.1 million tons reaped in 2009, the state
grains office said May 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
