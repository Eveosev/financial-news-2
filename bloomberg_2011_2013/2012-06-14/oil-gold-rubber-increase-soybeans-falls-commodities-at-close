The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities rose 0.1 percent to 577.70 at 4:30 p.m.  Singapore 
time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials rose 0.08
percent to 1421.66.  CRUDE OIL  Oil traded near the lowest close in eight months in  New
York  before OPEC meets to discuss potential changes to its
production quotas.  Oil for July delivery was at $82.63 a barrel, up 1 cent, in
electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:43
p.m. Singapore time. It earlier fell 0.4 percent. The contract
slid 0.8 percent yesterday to $82.62, the lowest close since
Oct. 6. Prices are down 16 percent this year.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas traded near the lowest close in seven weeks in
New York on forecasts for cooler weather that would reduce
demand for the fuel at  power plants .  OIL PRODUCTS  Asia fuel oil’s premium to crude increased, signaling
rising profit for refiners making residual products. Naphtha
swaps extended a decline.  Naphtha swaps for July decreased $6.50, or 0.9 percent, to
$732.50 a ton, according to PVM. The petrochemical and gasoline
feedstock is down for the fifth day in six.  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures lost
$4.62 to $2.61 a ton, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
This crack spread, a measure of processing profit, narrowed for
a third day.  The premium of gasoil, or diesel, to Dubai crude dropped 13
cents to $15.62 a barrel, according to PVM. The difference, also
known as the crack spread, narrowed for the third day this week.  Gasoil swaps for July slid $1, or 0.9 percent, to $109.65 a
barrel, PVM data showed. That’s the lowest since June 4. Jet
fuel’s premium to gasoil gained 5 cents to $1.05. That’s the
highest regrade so far this month, signaling it is more
profitable to produce  aviation fuel  over diesel.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold advanced for a fifth day in the longest winning streak
since April on speculation the  Federal Reserve  will take more
steps to buoy the economy, potentially hurting the dollar.
Platinum rose to a one-month high.  Spot gold rose as much as 0.4 percent to $1,623.98 an ounce
and was at $1,620.87 3:27 p.m. in Singapore. August-delivery
bullion was little changed at $1,621.40, paring gains of as much
as 0.3 percent on the Comex in New York.  BASE METALS  Copper climbed for the first time in three days on
speculation that the U.S. Federal Reserve will take more steps
to safeguard the economic recovery, boosting demand for
industrial metals.  Three-month delivery metal rose 0.5 percent to $7,424.75 a
metric ton on the London Metal Exchange at 1:58 p.m. in  Tokyo ,
reversing an earlier loss. Copper touched $7,233.25 on June 8,
the lowest level since Dec. 19. The July-delivery contract rose
0.3 percent to $3.3351 a pound on the Comex in New York.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Soybeans dropped for a second day as rains in parts of the
Midwest reduced concern that dry weather will hurt crops in the
U.S. and a deepening  European debt crisis  damped investors’
appetite for commodities.  November-delivery soybeans lost as much as 0.8 percent to
$13.095 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the lowest level
since June 7. Futures were at $13.115 at 3:14 p.m. in Singapore.  Corn for December delivery gained as much as 0.6 percent to
$5.135 a bushel in  Chicago , before trading at $5.11. The most-
active contract declined yesterday by as much as 2.5 percent.
Wheat for December delivery was little changed at $6.595 a
bushel.  Rubber climbed to a one-week high on concern that rains in
 Thailand , the largest producer, will cut supplies and as a
rebound in crude oil boosted the commodity’s appeal as an
alternative to synthetic products.  The November-delivery contract rose as much as 2 percent to
247.4 yen a kilogram ($3,115 a metric ton), before trading at
244.8 yen on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange at 2:40 p.m. local
time. Futures fell 1 percent earlier today and have declined 7.1
percent this year.  Palm oil  tumbled to the lowest in more than seven months on
speculation that rain forecast in the soybean-growing areas of
the U.S. may boost crops, while the deepening European crisis
reduces demand for commodities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
