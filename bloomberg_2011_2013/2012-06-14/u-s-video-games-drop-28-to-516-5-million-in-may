U.S. sales of video-game hardware,
software and accessories tumbled 28 percent in May to $516.5
million from a year earlier, amid a shift by consumers to
Internet-based games.  Retail sales totaled $718.9 million a year ago, when the
industry benefited from a Nintendo Co. price cut on its 3DS
handheld console, researcher NPD Group Inc. said today in an e-
mailed statement. Nintendo’s 3DS handheld was the only game
console to see a sales increase from year-ago results, according
to  Port Washington , New York-based NPD.  Annual sales of packaged video games have fallen for three
years as consumers move their purchasing to digital downloads
and games played on  Facebook Inc. (FB)  and other social sites. About
36 percent of the total $1.17 billion in games sold last month
were probably on a digital format, NPD said.  Nintendo’s sales of its 3DS handheld rose 17 percent over a
year earlier, NPD said, without citing figures. Sales of older
Nintendo handheld models rose 35 percent from a month earlier
after the company discounted the product price on May 20, NPD
reported.  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) , with 160,000 Xbox 360 consoles sold, led
the industry for the 15th consecutive month as it continues to
deliver features that expand beyond gaming into movies, music
and other forms of entertainment, the Redmond, Washington-based
company said in a separate statement.  Video-game makers voluntarily report their sales tallies.
Nintendo and  Sony Corp. (6758)  often don’t report monthly figures, and
they didn’t for May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
