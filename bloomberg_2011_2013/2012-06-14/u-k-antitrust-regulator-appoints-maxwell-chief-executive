The  Office of Fair Trading  appointed
Clive Maxwell as its new chief executive officer, the regulator
said today in a statement.  Maxwell, who has been on the OFT’s board since September
2010, replaces  John Fingleton , who has been in the role for
seven years. The U.K. antitrust regulator said Maxwell will be
paid 135,500 pounds ($209,000) a year.  “Clive is already a highly effective member of the OFT
leadership team and has been instrumental in forging strong
relations with government and the Competition Commission,”
Vince Cable, the U.K. business secretary, said in a statement.  The U.K. government announced in March that it planned
beginning in April 2014 to bring together the antitrust
functions of the OFT and the  Competition Commission  to create
the Competition Markets Authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
