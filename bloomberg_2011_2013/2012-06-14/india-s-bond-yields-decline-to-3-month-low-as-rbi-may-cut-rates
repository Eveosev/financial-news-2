India ’s bonds rose for a fourth day
on speculation the central bank will reduce borrowing costs to
bolster the slowing economy.  The  Reserve Bank  of India will lower the benchmark
 repurchase  rate by 25 basis points to 7.75 percent on June 18,
according to 17 of 23 economists in a Bloomberg survey. Four
predicted the central bank will leave the rate unchanged and two
forecast a 50 basis-point cut. Inflation accelerated to 7.5
percent in May from 7.23 percent in April, according to a
Bloomberg survey before data due today.  “India’s bigger concern now is to ensure that growth
doesn’t slow too rapidly,” said  Vishnu Varathan , a Singapore-
based economist at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. “The inflation
print will be higher, but with global  oil prices  receding and
growth concerns intensifying policy rates are likely to go
lower.”  The yield on the government’s 8.79 percent bonds due
November 2021 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point,
to 8.27 percent as of 9:39 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the
central bank’s trading system. That was the lowest level since
March 7.  Factory output increased 0.1 percent in April from a year
earlier after a revised 3.2 percent drop in March, the  Central
Statistical Office  said in a statement this week. Gross domestic
product  rose  5.3 percent in the first quarter from a year
earlier, the least in nine years, official data showed on May 31.  One-year  interest-rate swaps , or derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell three basis
points to 7.47 percent, the lowest level since April 2011,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
