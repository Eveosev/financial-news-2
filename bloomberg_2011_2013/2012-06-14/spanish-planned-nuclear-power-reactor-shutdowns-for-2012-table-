Following is a table of shutdowns at
nuclear power plants in  Spain  for 2012, according to data from
Madrid-based utilities lobby Unesa.  Five of the nation’s eight reactors were operating today,
according to the website of  Consejo de Seguridad Nuclear , the
country’s nuclear regulator. Vandellos II, Almaraz-2 and Trillo
are halted for planned maintenance. Spain produces about 20
percent of its electricity from atomic energy.  The table lists halts for plants owned by  Endesa SA (ELE) ,
 Iberdrola SA (IBE) ,  Gas Natural SDG SA (GAS)  and Nucleanor SA. No halts are
planned this year for the 1,092-megawatt Cofrentes, 1,027-
megawatt Asco-2 or 466-megawatt Santa Maria de Garona reactors,
Unesa said.  An asterisk highlights a change from the last version of
the table.
