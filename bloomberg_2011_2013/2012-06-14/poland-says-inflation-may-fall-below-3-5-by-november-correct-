     (Corrects year of budget target in first paragraph.)  Recent data show that  Poland ’s
inflation rate may drop below 3.5 percent on a sustained basis
in November or December, indicating that the 2012 budget target
of 4 percent average inflation isn’t at risk, the Warsaw-based
 Finance Ministry  said today in an e-mailed statement.  Consumer price growth may fluctuate over the next few
months due to the base effect of year-earlier inflation, the
ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
