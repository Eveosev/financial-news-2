Conergy AG (CGYK) , a German solar-panel
maker, is in “promising” talks with local partners to develop
power plants in southeastern Asia, Chief Executive Officer
Philip Comberg said.  Conergy is also looking to expand in markets in eastern
Europe, North Africa and the  Middle East , Comberg said in an
interview in Munich this week.  Conergy, once Germany’s largest solar company, and its
domestic counterparts are under pressure as subsidies fall at
home amid competition from Chinese competitors that has
depressed margins and panel prices. The Hamburg-based company is
cutting jobs, halting production of wafers and cells, and
focusing on end-product modules, project development and
services in a bid to become profitable.  While the Japanese solar market is buoyed by an
“attractive” feed-in-tariff due to start July 1, “you need a
local partner” to succeed in  Japan , Comberg said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
