Schaeffler AG, the German bearing
manufacturer that’s the biggest investor in tiremaker
 Continental AG (CON) , has expanded the number of creditors for an 8
billion-euro ($10 billion) refinancing package to 11 banks.  Barclays Plc (BARC) ,  Bayerische Landesbank  and  Citigroup Inc. (C)  have
joined  BNP Paribas SA (BNP) ,  Commerzbank AG (CBK) ,  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , HSBC,
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg,  Royal Bank
of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  and  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  as lenders, the
Herzogenaurach-based company said in a statement today.  The step completes the company’s effort to refinance debt
accumulated from taking a majority stake in Hanover-based auto-
parts supplier Continental in 2009. In February, Schaeffler
placed 2 billion euros in bonds and about 1.4 billion euros in
loans with institutional investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
