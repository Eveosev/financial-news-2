World fertilizer demand is expected
to climb an average 2.1 percent a year by the 2016-17 season to
193 million metric tons, the International Fertilizer Industry
Association said.  Global demand for fertilizer is expected to climb 2.5
percent in 2012-13 to 181 million tons of nutrients, after
growing 2.8 percent in 2011-12, the Paris-based IFA wrote in an
e-mailed report yesterday.  Average annual growth in potash demand is seen at 3.7
percent, compared with 2.3 percent for phosphates and 1.5
percent for nitrogen fertilizer, according to the group. Demand
for fertilizer is rising steadily as tight market conditions for
oilseeds and corn giving farmers an incentive to boost
production, the IFA said.  “In the next five years, reduced inventories and strong
crop prices are expected to persist in the agricultural
commodity markets,” Patrick Heffer, director of the IFA’s
agriculture service, was cited as saying. “This is anticipated
to stimulate fertilizer demand, but high crop-price volatility
could result in significant year-on-year variations.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
