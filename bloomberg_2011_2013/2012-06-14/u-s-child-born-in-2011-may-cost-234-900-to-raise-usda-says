A middle-income family may spend
$234,900 to raise a child born in 2011 to the age of 18, a 3.5
percent increase in a year, according to a government report.  Expenses for child care and education, transportation and
food represented the biggest jumps, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said today in a  report . Adjusted for anticipated
inflation, a child in a middle-class family would cost $295,560
to raise, the department said.  “It’s not just the cost, it’s the pressure,” said Ellen Galinsky, president of the Families and Work Institute based in
 New York . Competitive educational environments and an awareness
of what it takes for children to succeed are prompting more
spending, she said in a telephone interview.  The typical two-parent middle-income family spent $12,290
to $14,320 in 2011 on each child, the study found. Households
that make less spend less, USDA researchers said. A family
earning less than $59,410 a year will probably spend $169,080 in
2011 dollars to rear a child, while parents earning more than
$102,870 may pay $389,670, according to the study.  “Families receive little support as they navigate” the
child-rearing process, Galinsky said. The USDA report includes
an online  calculator  to help figure out costs.  Expensive Northeast  Expenses were highest for children raised in the urban
Northeast, followed by cities in the West and Midwest, the USDA
said. The urban South and rural areas were the least expensive.
Housing accounts for the biggest portion of expenses, averaging
30 percent over 17 years, the USDA said. Child care and
education costs at 18 percent and food, at 16 percent, are the
next biggest costs. The estimates don’t include college
expenses.  The study, published each year since 1960, helps courts and
government agencies estimate child-support costs, the USDA said.
In the first study, housing accounted for 31 percent of the cost
to raise a child, then estimated at $25,230 -- the equivalent of
$191,720 in 2011 dollars. Food was the second-biggest component,
at 24 percent, with transportation at 16 percent, compared with
14 percent in 2011.  Health care was 4 percent of the cost of raising a child in
1960, half the 2011 level. Education and child care accounted
for 2 percent of costs. Two-income families have raised the cost
of day care and other forms of child care, while changes in
agriculture have lowered food expenses, the USDA said.  “In 1960, child-care costs were negligible, mainly
consisting of in-the-home babysitting,” the USDA researchers
said in the report. “Since then, the labor force participation
of women has greatly increased, leading to the need for more
child care.”  Such demands are only increasing as families look at
quality education and child care as essential for success,
Galinsky said. “People want to equip their children with what
they need.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
