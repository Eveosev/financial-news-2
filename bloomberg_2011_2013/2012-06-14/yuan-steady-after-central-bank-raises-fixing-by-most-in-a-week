The  yuan  was little changed on
concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will worsen, even as the central
bank strengthened the currency’s reference rate by the most in a
week.  The People’s Bank of China raised the daily  fixing  by 0.13
percent, the most since June 7, to 6.3191 per dollar today. That
was 0.8 percent stronger than yesterday’s closing spot price.
Moody’s Investors Service cut Spain’s credit rating by three
steps yesterday and lowered Cyprus’s bond rating to Ba3 from
Ba1, ahead of Greece’s elections on June 17.  “China hopes to signal through the fixing that it favors a
stable currency to attract capital inflows,” said Banny Lam,
chief economist at CCB International Securities Ltd. in Hong
Kong, a unit of  China ’s second-largest bank. “As risk sentiment
and economic data are bleak, the yuan is unlikely to appreciate
much in the near term.”  The yuan traded little changed at 6.3703 per dollar in
 Shanghai , compared with 6.3691 yesterday, according to the China
Foreign Exchange Trade System. The currency is allowed to trade
as much as 1 percent on either side of the daily fixing. Its
one-month volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to
price options, fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, to 2.17 percent.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan was little changed
at 6.3690 per dollar. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards
declined 0.02 percent to 6.4195, a 0.8 percent discount to the
onshore spot rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
