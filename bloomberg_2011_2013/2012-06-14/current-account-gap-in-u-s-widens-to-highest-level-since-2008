The  current-account deficit  in the
U.S. widened in the first quarter to $137.3 billion, the biggest
in three years.  The gap, the broadest measure of international trade because
it includes income payments and government transfers, grew 16
percent from a revised $118.7 billion in the prior quarter, the
Commerce Department reported today in Washington. The median
forecast of economists in a Bloomberg News survey called for the
deficit to widen to $131.9 billion.  The  European debt crisis  may limit growth overseas more than
it hurts the world’s largest economy, signaling the deficit may
continue to climb as U.S. exports cool faster than  imports . A
yawning imbalance is also a reminder the U.S. remains dependent
on foreign investors for funding.  “We’re seeing a substantial disruption in  Europe  and the
Asian economies,”  Michael Englund , chief economist of Action
Economics in Boulder,  Colorado , said before the report. “Clearly
there’s a slowing under way. Our balance has been steadily
widening with China and OPEC.” Englund projected a gap of $137
billion.  Estimates of the 37 economists in a Bloomberg survey ranged
from deficits of $123.8 billion to $139.5 billion. The fourth-
quarter gap was revised down from a previously reported $124.1
billion.  The shortfall last quarter was the biggest since the last
three months of 2008. It was equivalent to 3.6 percent of gross
domestic product, up from 3.1 percent the prior quarter. The
deficit reached a record high of 6.5 percent of GDP in the fourth
quarter of 2005.  Trade Gap  The trade deficit in goods and services, which accounts for
most of the current-account gap, climbed to $151 billion from
$146.3 billion in the fourth quarter, today’s report showed.  The monthly  trade gap  narrowed to $50.1 billion in April,
down 4.9 percent from the prior month, the Commerce Department
reported earlier this month. American exports to the European
Union fell 11 percent as a sovereign debt crisis pushed the
region to the brink of recession.  U.S. income on overseas assets fell by $4.39 billion to
$182.5 billion in the first quarter, today’s report showed.
Foreign earnings on U.S. assets, including wages and
compensation, increased by $7.91 billion to $134.9 billion.  That left a $47.6 billion surplus on income payments, down
from a $59.9 billion surplus in the prior quarter and the
smallest in a year. U.S. investments overseas generally yield
more than the  Treasury securities  that foreign investors prefer
to buy, helping maintain the income surplus.  Government Payments  Payments by the U.S. government to foreigners and other
private transfers abroad exceeded inflows from overseas by $33.9
billion last quarter, compared with $32.2 billion in the last
three months of 2011.  Media and advertising company  Interpublic Group of Cos . Inc.
has seen some clients trim spending in Europe, which accounts for
12 percent of the company’s business, Chief Financial Officer
Frank Mergenthaler said.  Europe “is problematic,” Mergenthaler said at a June 13
conference. “I think you’re seeing multinational clients move
money out of Europe to go to some of the high-growth markets and
you see domestic clients just pulling back on spending.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
