Casino executive Sheldon Adelson and
his wife Miriam have given $10 million to a political action
committee supporting presumptive Republican presidential nominee
 Mitt Romney , according to a person familiar with the donation
who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly about it.  The donation to Restore Our Future came after Romney met
with Adelson last month during a fundraising visit to Las Vegas.  Adelson, chief executive officer of the  Las Vegas Sands
Corp. (LVS) , and his family earlier gave $21.5 million to a super-PAC
supporting one of Romney’s rivals in the Republican presidential
race, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. He also donated the
maximum $30,800 to the  Republican National Committee  in each of
the last two years and $2.5 million to a super-PAC formed to
elect House Republicans.  The Adelsons are the largest donors to super-PACs, which
can take in unlimited amounts of money and can spend it to help
elect candidates, as long as they don’t coordinate with the
campaigns.  Harold Simmons, chairman of Dallas-based Contran Corp., and
his wife Annette are second, giving $15 million, including
$800,000 to Restore Our Future, according to the Center for
Responsive Politics, a Washington-based research group that
tracks campaign donations.  To contact the reporters on this story:
