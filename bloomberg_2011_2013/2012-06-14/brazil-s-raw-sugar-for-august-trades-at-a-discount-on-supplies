Buyers of raw sugar from  Brazil , the
world’s largest producer, are getting a discount for the
sweetener loading in August at ports in the country’s main
growing region, according to Swiss Sugar Brokers.  Sugar for loading at ports in the center south in August is
at a discount of 0.2 cent a pound to the price of the July
contract on the ICE Futures U.S. exchange in New York, Naim Beydoun, a broker at the Rolle, Switzerland-based company said
by phone today. On June 10, the sweetener in the physical market
was at the same price as on the exchange, he said in a report
that day.  “We will have plenty of sugar in August,” Beydoun said.
“The rains have been delaying harvesting, crushing and
shipments but, on one hand, they will be more beneficial later
for the cane and less for the sucrose.”  Buyers wanting to ship sugar in July have to pay a premium
of 0.3 cent a pound to the exchange price because of harvest and
export delays, he said.  Raw sugar for October delivery was 0.2 percent lower at
19.64 cents a pound by 9:26 a.m. in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
