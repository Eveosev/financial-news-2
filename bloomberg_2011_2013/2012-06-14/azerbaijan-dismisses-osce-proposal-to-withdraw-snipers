Azerbaijan  spurned a proposal by the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to halt
shooting in its territorial dispute with  Armenia , saying it
would do so only if its neighbor did the same.  “We would be ready to withdraw snipers if Armenia started
withdrawing from Azerbaijan’s occupied territory,” Foreign
Minister Elmar Mammadyarov told reporters today in Baku, the
capital. “In the current circumstances, however, that would
strengthen the status quo.”  Azerbaijan and Armenia fought over Nagorno-Karabakh, a
mostly ethnic Armenian region that broke free of Baku’s control
after the disintegration of the former  Soviet Union  in 1991. The
war left Nagorno-Karabakh and seven surrounding Azeri districts
under Armenian control. Hostilities largely ended with a Russia-
brokered cease-fire agreement in 1994, though a peace agreement
has never been signed.  Eamon Gilmore, deputy prime minister and foreign minister
of Ireland, which holds the OSCE rotating chairmanship in 2012,
told the same press conference that withdrawal of snipers is
important to prevent the conflict from escalating.  At least nine soldiers were killed in border clashes
between the Azeri and Armenian forces last week as visiting U.S.
Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  warned of a broader regional
conflict with “disastrous and unpredictable” consequences.  Azerbaijan is the third-largest oil producer in the former
Soviet Union after Russia and Kazakhstan.  BP Plc (BP/)  and its
partners have invested $35 billion in Azerbaijan’s energy
projects since 1992.  To contact the reporter on this story:
