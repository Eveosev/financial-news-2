Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  said the
Bank of England is likely to ease policy again in response to
the mounting euro-area crisis, changing its previous forecast.  “The probability of further easing in the U.K. has
increased markedly with the rapid escalation of the euro area
crisis,” economist  Kevin Daly  in London said in a note today.
“We expect the bank to supplement ‘conventional’ QE with
specific actions to alleviate the funding conditions of U.K.
banks. The question of how much the bank eases by is
intrinsically linked to the question of how it eases.”  On the timing of any move, Daly said there “is a case for
waiting until the August Inflation Report, but we think a July
move is marginally more likely.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
