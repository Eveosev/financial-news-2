Canadian industrial companies made
the most use of their production capacity since 2007 in the
first quarter on increased demand for cars and machinery,
government figures showed.  The share of plant  capacity  in use increased to 80.7
percent in the January-March period, the highest since the
fourth quarter of 2007, from 80.5 percent in the previous
quarter,  Statistics Canada  said today in Ottawa. Economists
surveyed by Bloomberg forecast the rate would remain unchanged
at 80.5 percent, based on the median of 12 estimates.  Manufacturing  capacity use  rose to 81.3 percent in the
first quarter from 80.6 percent in the fourth quarter, the
highest since the third quarter of 2007, Statistics Canada said.  Capacity use in the oil and gas extraction industry rose to
90.2 percent, from 89.6 percent, while forestry and logging fell
to 88 percent, from 91.7 percent. Mining dropped to 60.3 percent
in the first quarter, from 64.2 percent during the last three
months of 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
