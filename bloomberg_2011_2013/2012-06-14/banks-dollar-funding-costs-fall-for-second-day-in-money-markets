The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars declined for the second day, according to a
money-markets indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 54 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 8:55 a.m. in
London, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s from
minus 55 basis points yesterday and compares with minus 59 on
June 4, which was the most expensive in three months.  The one-year basis swap was 58 basis points below Euribor
from minus 57 yesterday. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Prices in the forward market for three-month Euribor
relative to overnight indexed swaps -- known as the FRA/OIS
spread -- rose to 39.5 basis points from 38.  The Euribor/OIS spread was little changed at 38 basis
points. The measure has ranged from 37 basis points to 42 basis
points since the end of March.  Lenders cut  overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-based
European Central Bank yesterday, placing 704 billion euros ($886
billion) from 798 billion euros the day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
