Harvard University  is aiming to
resume construction of its science center in the Allston section
of Boston in 2014, stalled after its endowment shrank in the
wake of the credit crisis that began in 2008.  Work on the science center, once planned to cost more than
$1 billion, came to a halt more than two years ago. Harvard
Executive Vice President Katherine Lapp announced the
construction timeline in a report dated yesterday.  The science center is slated to house expanded laboratories
for Harvard’s stem cell scientists and biological researchers
from its School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. President
Drew Faust called the temporary construction halt in December
2009, after the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based University’s
endowment dropped by about a third, to $26 billion from $36.9
billion the previous year. As of June 30, 2011, the fund had $32
billion, making Harvard the world’s richest school.  The building will range in size from 500,000 square feet to
600,000 square feet, and start with about 500 scientists and
support staff, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
