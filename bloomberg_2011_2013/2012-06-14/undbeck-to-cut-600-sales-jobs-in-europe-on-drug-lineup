H. Lundbeck A/S (LUN) , the Nordic region’s
second-largest drugmaker, said it’s eliminating 600 sales jobs
in  Europe  as it prepares new products that will lead to a change
in its lineup.  Reorganization costs may total as much as 500 million
kroner ($85 million) this year, the Copenhagen-based company
said in a statement today. The job cuts will affect sales
personnel who work with general practitioners, said Mads Kronborg, a spokesman.  Lundbeck expects European approval of its alcoholism
treatment nalmefene by the end of 2012. It’s also planning to
submit a new antidepressant, known as LU AA21004, for regulatory
clearance in the U.S. and Europe later this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
