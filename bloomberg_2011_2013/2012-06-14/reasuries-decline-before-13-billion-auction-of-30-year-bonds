Treasuries fell before the U.S.
auctions $13 billion of 30-year bonds at what may be a record
low yield amid speculation the  Federal Reserve  may take further
measures to spur economic growth.  U.S. government securities earlier pared losses after
reports showing weekly claims for U.S. jobless benefits
unexpectedly rose and inflation remained subdued. An auction of
10-year notes yesterday drew a record low yield as investors
sought a refuge from Europe’s financial crisis.  “The street is more concerned about supply than the
numbers for the data,” said  David Coard , head of fixed-income
trading in New York at Williams Capital Group, a brokerage for
institutional investors. “It’s always tricky with the 30-year,
but we’ll probably see good sponsorship.”  The  30-year yield  increased two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 2.73 percent at 12:19 p.m.  New York  time
after falling one basis point earlier, according to Bloomberg
Bond Trader prices.  The  10-year note yield  climbed three basis points to 1.62
percent after touching 1.59 percent earlier.  As the Treasury prepares to auction long bonds, the Fed
purchased $2.04 billion of Treasuries today due from February
2036 to February 2042 as part of its Operation Twist program.
The central bank is replacing $400 billion of shorter-term
securities in its holdings with longer-term bonds through this
month to keep borrowing costs down.  Policy Function  “It’s not a situation where the Treasury is selling
directly to the Fed, thereby printing dollars to fund government
consumption, but rather a function of the Fed’s easy monetary
policy as it manifests itself in buying to flatten the Treasury
curve,” said  Ian Lyngen , a government bond strategist at CRT
Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .  The U.S. 30-year bonds being sold today yielded 2.74
percent in pre-auction trading, compared with 3.09 percent at
the previous sale on May 10 and a record auction low of 2.925
percent in December.  Treasuries pared losses after data showed claims for
 jobless benefits  in the U.S. unexpectedly climbed by 6,000 to
386,000 in the week ended June 9 from a revised 380,000 the
prior week that was more than first estimated, Labor Department
figures showed today in Washington. Economists projected claims
would fall to 375,000, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey.  CPI Slides  The cost of living in the U.S. fell in May by the most in
more than three years as fuel prices retreated, buttressing Fed
projections that cheaper commodities will help reduce inflation.
The consumer-price index declined 0.3 percent, more than
forecast and the biggest drop since December 2008, after no
change the prior month, the Labor Department reported today in
 Washington . Economists projected a 0.2 percent decrease.  “It’s going to help the case for the doves that want to
build accommodation,” said Jacob Oubina, a senior U.S.
economist at Royal Bank of Canada’s RBC  Capital Markets  unit in
New York, one of 21 primary dealers that trade Treasuries with
the Fed. “Headline CPI is decelerating at a faster pace than
even we had anticipated.”  The  difference in yields  between 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a measure of traders’
expectations for inflation known as the break-even rate, touched
2.09 percentage points from this year’s high of 2.45 percentage
points in March. It dropped to 2.01 percentage points on May 30,
the lowest since Jan. 17. The gap has averaged 2.15 percentage
points in the past decade.  Fed Measure  A  measure  of price-increase predictions used by the Fed to
set policy, the five-year, five-year forward break-even rate,
which gauges the average inflation rate between 2017 and 2022,
was 2.52 percentage points on June 11, down from a 2012 high of
2.78 percentage points on March 19 and a five-year average of
2.8 percent.  Treasuries rose yesterday as  Europe ’s worsening debt crisis
spurred investor demand for safety.  Moody’s Investors Service cut  Spain ’s credit rating
yesterday by three steps to Baa3, citing the nation’s increased
debt burden, weakening economy and limited access to capital
markets. The  yield  on Spain’s 10-year note climbed to 6.998
percent, the highest ever. Greeks will vote again this weekend
after a May election failed to produce a coalition government.  ‘Significant Risks’  “The situation in Europe poses significant risks to the
U.S. financial system and economy and must be monitored
closely,” Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told lawmakers on June
7. “As always, the Federal Reserve remains prepared to take
action as needed to protect the U.S. financial system and
economy in the event that financial stresses escalate.”  The Fed opens a two-day policy meeting on June 19.  The central bank bought $2.3 trillion of bonds from
December 2008 to June 2011 in two rounds of a tactic called
quantitative easing, seeking to cap borrowing costs and
stimulate the economy.  The U.S. auctioned $21 billion of 10-year notes yesterday
at a record-low yield of 1.622 percent. The  bid-to-cover  ratio,
which gauges demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount
offered, was 3.06, versus 2.9 at the previous auction on May 9.  Treasuries have returned 3.2 percent this quarter through
yesterday, Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes showed. The
 MSCI All Country World Index (MXWD)  of stocks has lost 9.3 percent,
including reinvested dividends.  To contact the reporter on this story:
