U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of  Florida 
doesn’t stand out as a member of Congress with a law degree. He
does as a lawmaker who is still paying for it.  Annual financial disclosure reports released today show
that the first-term Republican owes at least $100,000, and as
much as $250,000, in student loans through Sallie Mae incurred
in 1996, the year he earned a law degree from the University of
Miami. He reported the same range of outstanding student loans
last year.  Also owing money on their student loans are Representative
Linda Sanchez, a five-term California Democrat, and four-term
Republican Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers of  Washington .  Sanchez owes more than $15,000, and may owe as much as
$50,000, on the student loan she took out in 1992 to attend law
school at the  University of California  at  Los Angeles . Rodgers
owes more than $10,000 on a student loan she took out in 2003,
and earned a master’s of business administration from the
University of Washington in 2002.  They’re the exceptions, according to lawmakers’ financial
disclosure forms. As Congress considers whether to allow a
temporary reduction in student-loan  interest rates  to expire,
lawmakers generally are not among the Americans with student-
loan debt that lingers long after they are established in their
careers.  6.8 Percent  Unless Congress intervenes, on July 1 those who take out
new student loans will pay an interest rate of 6.8 percent. The
current rate is 3.4 percent.  Total student loan debt reached $904 billion in the first
quarter, up from $874 billion three months earlier, according to
the  Federal Reserve Bank of New York . Student loan debt totaled
more than credit card debt nationally. Student loan debt rose by
$64 billion from last year, even as all other forms of  household
debt  fell by $383 billion.  Rodgers, vice chairwoman of the House Republican
Conference, was the only member of the House leadership to
report a student loan liability. Members were required to
disclose any debts greater than $10,000.  To contact the reporters on this story:
