AOL Inc. (AOL)  dropped the most in more
than two months as traders anticipated activist shareholder
Starboard Value LP may sell its stake in the  Internet company 
after failing today to shake up the board.  AOL fell 5.6 percent to $25.57 at the close in New York,
for the biggest drop since April 10. The stock has gained 69
percent this year.  Starboard, AOL’s fifth-largest shareholder, fought to
install three directors, saying existing members supported a
failing strategy. AOL’s slate of board nominees won support from
investors at the annual meeting in  Boston , the company said in a
statement today. The vote count is preliminary.  “Event-driven traders are exiting ahead of Starboard’s
likely exit,”  David Joyce , a New York-based analyst with Miller
Tabak & Co., wrote in an e-mail.  Starboard, had a 5.3 percent  stake  in the New York-based
company as of April 26, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Daniel Gagnier, a spokesman for Starboard, declined to
comment on whether the fund will sell down any of its stake in
AOL.  To contact the reporter on this story:
