Russian Foreign Minister  Sergei Lavrov  didn’t accuse the U.S. of arming Syrian rebels, as an
Iranian translation of remarks he made at a media briefing had
indicated, according to an audio recording of the event.  The Russian-to-Farsi translation of his remarks made in
Tehran yesterday, reported by Iranian state news agencies and
television, had Lavrov accusing the U.S. of helping to arm
Syrian insurgents.  The Russian foreign minister, who was giving a joint press
conference with his Iranian counterpart  Ali Akbar Salehi , was
asked by a Russian reporter to comment on U.S. Secretary of
State Hillary Clinton’s accusations that Russia is fueling the
Syrian conflict by delivering attack helicopters to Syria.  “We aren’t shipping to  Syria  or anywhere else things that
can be used against peaceful demonstrators,” Lavrov  said ,
according to a recording of his remarks in Russian provided by
the Foreign Ministry. “Unlike the  United States , for example,
which regularly delivers such special equipment to the region,
including a recent delivery to one of the countries of the
Persian Gulf.”  The translation of his remarks by Iran’s state-run Mehr
news agency had Lavrov saying: “Unlike the U.S., which supplies
arms to the Syrian opposition that can be used against the
Syrian government, we don’t take such action.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
