Mortgage rates  in the U.S. rose from
a record low, breaking a seven-week streak of declines that
fueled demand for home loans.  The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage increased to
3.71 percent in the week ended today from 3.67 percent, the
lowest level in records dating to 1971, according to a statement
from McLean, Virginia-based  Freddie Mac. (FMCC)  The average 15-year
rate climbed to 2.98 percent from 2.94 percent.  Low borrowing costs are pushing homeowners to reduce their
monthly payments while also helping to stabilize the housing
market. Mortgage applications surged 18 percent in the week
ended June 8, the Washington-based Mortgage Bankers Association
said yesterday. An index measuring refinancing increased 19
percent to the highest level since 2009, while the purchase
gauge climbed 13 percent.  “Mortgage rates are just very low right now, and that’s
causing some strengthening in demand,” said  Celia Chen , a
housing economist at Moody’s Analytics in West Chester,
Pennsylvania. “The refis have been rising consistently for a
while now. On the purchase side, I guess people are starting to
feel more confident in the housing market.”  Home prices advanced for a second straight month in April,
rising 1.1 percent from a year earlier,  CoreLogic (CLGX)  said on June
5. It was the first consecutive increase since June 2010,
according to the Santa Ana, California-based data provider.  To contact the reporter on this story:
