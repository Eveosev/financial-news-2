Japanese  stocks  fell, reversing
yesterday’s advance, as U.S. and European data added to concern
the global economy is slowing and after borrowing costs climbed
in  Italy  ahead of a Greek election this weekend that may
determine the nation’s future in the monetary union.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , which gets 21 percent of its sales in
 North America , fell 1.2 percent.  Nippon Sheet Glass Co. (5202) , which
depends on Europe for 39 percent of its revenue, fell 1.3
percent. Tsugami Corp. slumped 5.9 percent after Citigroup Inc.
said order growth is declining for the maker of automated
machine tools.  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  dropped 0.2 percent to 8,568.8
at the 3 p.m. trading close in Tokyo. The broader  Topix (TPX)  Index
lost 0.1 percent to 725.66, fluctuating between gains and losses
over the past five trading days. Volume on the index was 31
percent below the 100-day average before Greek polls on June 17.  “Europe is sliding further into a recession and the global
and U.S. economies are still slowing down, and so I think this
is a soft patch,” said  Shane Oliver , Sydney-based head of
investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which has
almost $100 billion under management. “It’s still the time for
caution on the short-term view. There’s a lot of event risk
around.”  The Topix fell 17 percent from this year’s high on March 27
as China’s economic growth slowed and on concern Europe’s debt
crisis is spreading. Shares on the index are valued at 0.86
times book value, near levels seen in 2008 after the collapse of
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. A number below one means investors
can buy a company for less than the value of its assets.  Low Turnover  The value of shares traded on the first section of the
 Tokyo  Stock Exchange was 860 billion yen ($10.8 billion) today,
about two-thirds of this year’s daily average of 1.13 trillion
yen.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.3
percent today. The gauge fell 0.7 percent yesterday in New York
after a Commerce Department report showed U.S.  retail sales  fell
in May for a second month. Weaker economic data adds pressure on
the  Federal Reserve  to take further steps to spur growth, and a
policy-setting meeting is scheduled June 19-20.  Toyota fell 1.2 percent to 3,015 yen. Canon Inc., the
world’s biggest camera maker, slid 0.2 percent to 3,210 yen.  Shares also fell today as euro-area industrial production
slid for a second month in April, the European Union’s
statistics office said yesterday.  “Everyone knows the risks associated with the economies in
 Europe ,” said Cameron Peacock, a Melbourne-based analyst at IG
Markets Ltd., a provider of trading services for stocks, bonds
and currencies. “Ahead of the weekend’s election in Greece, no
one wants to be on the wrong side of the bet and take on risk.”  Italian Bonds  Ten-year yields on Italian  government bonds  rose to the
highest since Jan. 25. Spain’s credit rating was downgraded
three steps to Baa3 from A3 by Moody’s Investors Service, citing
the nation’s increased debt burden, weakening economy and
limited access to  capital markets .  Nippon Sheet Glass lost 1.3 percent to 78 yen. Shimano Inc.,
a manufacturer of bicycle parts that counts Europe as its
biggest market, dropped 1.3 percent to 4,865 yen.  European yields are rising as Spain seeks a banking rescue
of as much as 100 billion euros ($126 billion), following Greece,
Ireland and Portugal in taking bailouts.  “Obviously, the Spanish bank bailout on the weekend didn’t
help matters and probably increased the focus on Italy,” AMP
Capital’s Oliver said. “It’s also made investors worry about
investing in Spanish bonds.”  The  Nikkei 225 Volatility Index (VNKY)  rose 4 percent to 27.73,
indicating traders expect a swing of about 8 percent on the
benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  Tsugami slumped 5.9 percent to 515 yen after Citigroup Inc.
said in a report growth in the firm’s machine tool orders has
declined since peaking in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
