Coal of Africa Ltd.  rose the most in
almost seven months in Johannesburg trading after estimated coal
resources at a reserve in  South Africa ’s Limpopo province
increased more than fivefold.  The stock advanced for a second day, climbing 9.2 percent
to close at 5.33 rand, the biggest one-day gain since Nov. 24.
Estimated resources in the Greater Soutpansberg area expanded to
8 billion metric tons from 1.5 billion tons, the company said in
a statement yesterday.  The increase in available coal is a boon for Coal of
Africa, whose shares have slumped 41 percent in a year as
environmental concerns stalled the development of its Vele
colliery near the Mapungubwe Hill ruins in Limpopo. The Perth,
Australia-based company acquired rights to some of the Greater
Soutpansberg coking- and thermal-coal assets earlier this year.  Coal of  Africa  plans to dig an annual 10 million tons of
coking coal in Limpopo province, adding revenue of $2 billion to
$3 billion in the next 10 years, Chief Executive Officer John Wallington said March 12. The company is building mines in an
area that, together with neighboring Zimbabwe and  Mozambique ,
may be as rich in coal as  Australia ’s Bowen basin, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
