European Central Bank council member
Erkki Liikanen declined to comment on the outlook for interest
rates, saying only that policy makers will take the latest data
into account when they meet on July 5.  “As you all know, we don’t comment on monetary policy
decisions,” Liikanen, who heads  Finland ’s central bank, said at
a press briefing in Helsinki today. “We will discuss these
issues based on the most recent data when we look at both
economic factors and factors of money and credit.”  While the ECB last week held its benchmark  interest rate  at
1 percent, President  Mario Draghi  said “a few” policy makers
called for a cut, fueling speculation the bank could act as soon
as next month as the sovereign debt crisis curbs growth and
damps price pressures.  Asked if the ECB could lower its deposit rate to zero from
its current level of 0.25 percent, Liikanen said: “We will have
our policy meeting in early July, as you already know, and will
make decisions based on the most recent information. I don’t
pre-commit, that is, I don’t give any guidance for it.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
