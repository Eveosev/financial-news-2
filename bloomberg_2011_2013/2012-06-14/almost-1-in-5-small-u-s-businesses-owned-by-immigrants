Immigrants own almost one of every
five of the small businesses in the U.S., accounting for more
than their share of the nation’s total population, according to
a report by the Fiscal Policy Institute.  The study released today found that immigrants own 18
percent of businesses with fewer than 100 people working for
them, while U.S. residents born outside the country account for
13 percent of the nation’s population, based on the U.S. Census
Bureau’s 2010 American Community Survey.  The number of small businesses climbed to 4.9 million in
2010, a 58 percent increase from 3.1 million in 1990, when
immigrants owned 12 percent of such companies, the Fiscal Policy
Institute found. They were responsible for 538,551 new small
businesses during the two decades, or about one-third of the
total created in that period, the Latham, New York-based
research organization reported.  “I don’t think immigrants are ‘super-entrepreneurs,’”
said David Dyssegaard Kallick, director of the institute’s
Immigration Research Initiative and author of the report. “But
I do see that immigrants are playing an important and growing
role. Immigrant businesses often bring new energy to the urban,
suburban and rural landscape of America.”  The institute also found regional and national patterns,
with Mediterranean and Middle Eastern people being more likely
to own a small business than other immigrants. Sixteen percent
of the Greek-born  labor force  owned a small business. Only 1
percent of Mexican immigrants were small business owners.  Motel Owners  Foreign-born entrepreneurs owned 28 percent of small
businesses in the leisure and hospitality fields, the largest
percentage of any broad industry. Immigrants constituted a
majority of small taxi, dry cleaning and gas station owners.
They also made up 43 percent of hotel or motel owners and 37
percent of restaurant operators.  Immigrants also operated a substantial share of doctors’
offices, owning 26 percent of the nation’s 143,433 physician
offices.  Immigrant-owned small businesses appear to have rebounded
from the 2007-09 recession. Their ranks fell to 842,000 in 2009,
down from 868,000 in 2007 before rebounding to 900,000 last
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
