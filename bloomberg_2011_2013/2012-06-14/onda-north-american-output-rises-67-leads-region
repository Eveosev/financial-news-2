Honda Motor Co. (7267)  has raised output at
North American plants by the fastest pace of any carmaker in the
region this year as the company pushes to reclaim U.S. market
share lost to competitors and natural disasters in 2011.  Honda plants in the U.S., Canada and Mexico built 748,217
cars and light trucks in the year’s first five months, a record
for the period and 67 percent more than a year earlier,
according to the company.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , Asia’s biggest
automaker, followed with a 64 percent North American increase to
787,777 vehicles.  “We’ve been doing everything we can to make up for lost
time,” Tom Lake, Honda’s head of North American purchasing,
said last month in an interview in Raymond,  Ohio .  Honda, the third-largest Japanese carmaker, and Toyota are
targeting gains of 10 percent or more in U.S. sales this year
after losing ground to  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  and  Kia Motors Corp. (000270) ,
both based in Seoul. Honda, Toyota and  Nissan Motor Co. (7201)  are also
racing to limit exposure to a sustained rise in the yen against
the dollar by shifting output and parts purchases from Japan.  The Japanese currency last traded at about 79.4 yen to the
dollar, compared with 91.7 yen to the dollar two years ago and
122.7 yen five years ago.  “Long before the yen became as strong as it is today we’d
identified plans for localizing certain specialized parts or
materials we’re buying from Japan,” Lake said. “The shift in
the  exchange rate  increased the urgency in getting that done.”  Record Pace  Nissan, tapping alternative supply sources through its
alliance with  Renault SA (RNO) , was able to rebound faster from
Japan’s earthquake and tsunami in 2011 and lost less production
in  North America  from parts-supply issues.  Nissan, based in Yokohama, Japan, increased output at U.S.
and Mexican plants by 23 percent this year to 562,971, said
David Reuter, a company spokesman.  The high exchange rate means Japan’s automakers are also
limiting export, Alec Gutierrez, Kelley Blue Book’s auto market
analyst, said in a statement June 13.  “Although exports will be managed to limit losses,
Japanese manufacturers will continue to do whatever is necessary
to maintain share,” he said.  Production of cars and light trucks in North America by all
manufacturers increased 22 percent through May to 6.57 million
vehicles from 5.38 million a year earlier, according to trade
magazine Automotive News.  Rising Production  Among the region’s largest automakers,  General Motors Co. (GM) ’s
output is up 5.4 percent to  1.41 million  through May;  Ford Motor
Co. (F) ’s grew 4.4 percent to 1.15 million; and Chrysler Group LLC
had a 23 percent increase to  1.02 million , according to company
statements.  Japan’s three largest automakers are also producing
vehicles in North America at a rate indicating each will set
records this year.  Sustaining the current pace means Tokyo-based Honda will
produce more than 1.7 million Honda and Acura brand autos in the
region this year, topping its best-ever 1.43 million in 2007.  Honda’s U.S. market share slid to 9 percent last year from
10.6 percent in 2010, according to researcher Autodata Corp.
Honda’s share is 9.6 percent this year through May, down from
9.9 percent a year earlier. Honda’s light-vehicle sales rose 10
percent during the first five months, trailing the industrywide
13 percent gain.  Toyota, which made an average of 157,555 vehicles each
month this year, may produce more than 1.89 million, surpassing
its previous record of 1.67 million in 2007. The company is
based in Toyota City, Japan.  Nissan made 1.18 million in the U.S. and  Mexico  last year,
its highest volume to date, and may make as many as 1.35 million
at the current rate.  Honda’s U.S. headquarters are in Torrance, California. The
stock fell 0.1 percent 2,544 yen in Tokyo yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
