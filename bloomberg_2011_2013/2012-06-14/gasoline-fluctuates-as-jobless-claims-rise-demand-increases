Gasoline rose along with equities on
speculation that the  Federal Reserve  will act to stimulate the
economy as jobless claims increased and consumer prices fell by
the most in three years.  Futures gained as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed
0.6 percent at 3:03 p.m. in  New York . Consumer prices sank in
May by the most in more than three years as fuel prices
declined, and claims for jobless benefits climbed by 6,000 to
386,000 in the week ended June 9, two reports from the  Labor
Department  showed.  “This increases the likelihood that the Fed will do more
quantitative easing,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at
Price Futures Group in  Chicago .  Gasoline for July delivery rose 2.1 cents, or 0.8 percent,
to $2.6764 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the
highest settlement this week.  The policy-setting  Federal Open Market Committee  is
scheduled to meet June 19-20.  There is a 60 percent chance the FOMC will announce more
stimulus efforts at the meeting, Newedge Strategy analyst
Annalisa Piazza said in a note to clients today.  “We’re riding a wave of some hopes on the stimulus and
equities are up,” said Fred Rigolini, vice president of
Paramount Options Inc. in New York.  The Energy Department reported yesterday that  deliveries  of
gasoline to wholesalers increased 5.6 percent, to 9.13 million
barrels a day, the highest level since August. Prices at the
pump are the lowest since February.  “The drop in gasoline prices means people are going to
drive a little bit more but if the jobs market continues to be
weak, that rebound in gasoline will be limited,” Flynn said.  Heating oil for July delivery rose 1.69 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $2.6278 a gallon, after settling yesterday at the
lowest level since January 2011.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, fell 0.7
cent to $3.532 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA. It was the
lowest price since Feb. 16.  To contact the reporters on this story:
