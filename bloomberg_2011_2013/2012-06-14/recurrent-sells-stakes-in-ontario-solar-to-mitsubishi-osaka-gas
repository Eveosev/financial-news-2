Recurrent Energy LLC, the U.S. unit
of  Sharp Corp. (SHCAY)  that develops solar-power plants, sold to
 Mitsubishi Corp. (8058)  and Osaka Gas Co. a majority stake in nine of
its projects in the Canadian province of Ontario.  Mitsubishi and Osaka Gas each bought 45 percent of
Recurrent’s Smiths Falls I-VI and Waubaushene III-V projects,
according to Recurrent’s Chief Executive Officer Arno Harris.
San Francisco-based Recurrent will own the remaining 10 percent.  The deal is “a sign of how deep the capital pool is for
solar and how established solar is now as an asset class,”
Harris said today by telephone. “This is exactly the kind of
thing that we anticipated would happen as solar begins to enter
the mainstream,” he said.  The  projects  total about 100 megawatts in capacity, or half
of Recurrent’s  contracted capacity  in the province, and are
expected to be completed next year, the company said in an e-
mailed statement. The purchase price wasn’t disclosed.  Recurrent has 200 megawatts of 20-year  feed-in tariff
contracts  with the Ontario Power Authority, which will pay
C$0.44 ($0.43) a kilowatt hour.  To contact the reporter on this story:
