Treasuries fell as the U.S. sold $13
billion of 30-year bonds at a record low yield and traders
speculated whether global central banks will coordinate
assistance if Greek elections increase financial-market turmoil.  Yields climbed after Reuters reported policy makers are
preparing for unified action as they gather this weekend for a
summit in  Mexico , citing officials linked to the Group of 20
nations. Prices have swung between gains and losses as investors
debated whether the refuge appeal of  U.S. government debt 
outweighs buying with yields close to record lows.  “The market’s on eggshells here,” said  Brian Edmonds , New
York-based head of  interest rates  at Cantor Fitzgerald LP, one
of 21 primary dealers that trade with the Federal Reserve. “It
doesn’t take much to move the market either way.”  The yield on the  30-year bond  increased three basis points,
or 0.3 percentage point, to 2.74 percent at 5:13 p.m. New York
time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader Prices. The price of
the 3 percent security maturing in May 2042 dropped 22/32, or
$6.88 per 1,000 face amount, to 105 1/4. The yield climbed
earlier as much as four basis points and fell one basis point.
It touched a record low of 2.5089 percent on June 1.  The benchmark 10-year note  yield  rose five basis points to
1.64 percent. It touched a record low of 1.4387 percent June 1.  The long bonds sold today  yielded  2.720 percent, versus a
forecast of 2.725 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of eight of
the Fed’s 21 primary dealers.  ‘Not Surprised’  “It wasn’t the best auction we’ve seen,” said  Dan Greenhaus , chief global strategist at the broker-dealer BTIG LLC
in New York. “Yields are at extraordinarily low levels, and
with equities pushing higher, we’re not surprised to see yields
move a bit higher.”  The previous record low yield at a 30-year bond auction was
2.925 percent at the Dec. 14 sale. Last month’s sale drew a
yield of 3.09 percent.  “We are in a low interest-rate environment for a longer
period of time, and investors are now understanding that,”
Wilmer Stith, a portfolio manager in a group that oversees $14
billion at Wilmington Trust Investment Managers in Baltimore,
said in a telephone interview.  The auction’s  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges demand by
comparing total bids with the amount of securities offered, was
2.40, the lowest since November, versus an average of 2.66 at
the past 10 sales.  Indirect bidders , an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 32.5 percent of the bonds today,
compared with 33.8 percent at the May sale and an average of
29.6 percent at the past 10 offerings.  Direct bidders , non-
primary dealer investors that place their bids directly with the
Treasury, bought 24 percent, versus an average of 16.9 percent
at the past 10 auctions.  Volume Falls  Trading volume dropped. About $271 billion of Treasuries
changed hands through ICAP Plc, the world’s largest interdealer
broker, as of 5:01 p.m. in  New York . Volume was $284 billion
yesterday and $396 billion on May 31. The five-year average is
$268 billion.  Primary-dealer holdings of U.S. government debt rose to a
record $136.4 billion in the week ending June 6, from $100.1
billion in the week ended May 30. Holdings of  coupons  maturing
in less than three years rose to a record $65.6 billion from
$47.8 billion as the Fed sells shorter-term securities.  Treasuries pared losses earlier after data showed claims
for  jobless benefits  in the U.S. unexpectedly climbed by 6,000
to 386,000 in the week ended June 9 from a revised 380,000 the
prior week that was more than first estimated, Labor Department
data showed. Economists in a Bloomberg News survey projected a
decline to 375,000.  Consumer Prices  The cost of living in the U.S. fell in May by the most in
more than three years as fuel prices retreated, buttressing Fed
projections that cheaper commodities will help reduce inflation.
The consumer-price index declined 0.3 percent, more than
forecast and the biggest drop since December 2008, after no
change the prior month, the Labor Department reported.  “The recent data makes it less difficult for the Fed to do
something as growth and inflation have been lackluster,” Stith
of Wilmington Trust said. “The drumbeat is getting louder for
more easing with weak data and the speed  Europe  is unraveling.”  U.S. stocks rose, with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
advancing 1.1 percent.  Treasuries gained yesterday as Europe’s worsening debt
crisis spurred investor demand for safety.  Spain, Greece  Moody’s Investors Service cut  Spain ’s credit rating
yesterday by three steps to Baa3, citing the nation’s increased
debt burden, weakening economy and limited access to  capital
markets . Greeks will vote again on June 17 after a May election
failed to produce a coalition government.  “The situation in Europe poses significant risks to the
U.S. financial system and economy and must be monitored
closely,” Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told lawmakers June 7.
“As always, the  Federal Reserve  remains prepared to take action
as needed to protect the U.S. financial system and economy in
the event that financial stresses escalate.”  The Fed opens a two-day policy meeting on June 19.  The central bank bought $2.3 trillion of bonds from
December 2008 to June 2011 in two rounds of a tactic called
quantitative easing, seeking to cap borrowing costs and
stimulate the economy.  The U.S. sold $21 billion of 10-year notes yesterday at a
record-low yield of 1.622 percent. The bid-to-cover ratio, which
gauges demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount
offered, was 3.06, versus 2.9 at the previous auction on May 9.  Today’s offering was the last of three Treasury note and
bond auctions this week totaling $66 billion. The government
sold $32 billion in three-year securities on June 12.  TIPS Sale  The Treasury said it will sell $7 billion in 30-year
Treasury Inflation Protected Securities on June 21. The previous
auction of the security on Feb. 16, a $9 billion offering, drew
a record low yield of 0.77 percent.  The Fed purchased $2.04 billion of Treasuries today due
from February 2036 to February 2042 as part of its Operation
Twist program. The central bank is replacing $400 billion of
shorter-term securities in its holdings with longer-term bonds
through this month to keep borrowing costs down.  To contact the reporters on this story:
