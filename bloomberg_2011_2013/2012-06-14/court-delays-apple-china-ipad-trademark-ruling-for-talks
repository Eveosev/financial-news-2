A Chinese court will delay its
decision on  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s appeal of a ruling denying its
ownership of the iPad trademark in  China  to let the company
pursue mediation with Proview Technology (Shenzhen) Co.  The Higher People’s Court of Guangdong won’t release a
ruling on Apple’s Feb. 29 appeal so long as both parties
continue talking, Zhao Le, a spokesman at the court’s foreign
affairs office said in a phone interview today.  Apple revenue in China tripled to $7.9 billion last
quarter, helped by surging demand for products including the
iPad tablet computer. The Cupertino, California-based company
has said it acquired rights to the iPad trademark in China from
 Proview International Holdings Ltd. (334)  in 2009. A lower court ruled
last November the agreement was invalid because Proview’s
Shenzhen-based unit owned the mark and wasn’t represented.  While a ruling on an appeal would normally be issued within
three months, the clock hasn’t been running while the two
companies are in court-sponsored mediation, said Roger Xie, a
Proview Technology lawyer.  “The mediation will continue,” Xie said in a phone
interview today. “There is no specific deadline.”  Xie declined to provide details on the status of talks with
the Cupertino, California-based company. Apple spokeswoman
Carolyn Wu didn’t immediately return calls.  Apple has offered compensation to resolve the dispute,
though a “big gap” remains between the two sides, Xie said in
May.  Shares of Hong Kong-listed Proview International have been
suspended from trading since 2010.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
