Canadian Prime Minister  Stephen Harper  has been stressing with his counterparts from the Group
of 20 nations the need to be ready for all possible outcomes
following the June 17 Greek elections, a spokesman said.  Asked about reports that the G-20 is ready to take steps to
stabilize financial markets if needed in the immediate aftermath
of the election, Andrew MacDougall said “it’s incumbent for any
government in this environment to be ready to deal with all
eventualities.”  “The G-20 showed it was able to act quite nimbly in the
original downturn,” MacDougall said at a briefing for reporters
in Ottawa ahead of the June 18-19 summit in  Mexico . “If there’s
one thing experience has taught us, it’s you have to be ready
for these eventualities as they come up.”  G-20 leaders start arriving in the resort of Los Cabos on
June 17, the same day as parliamentary elections in  Greece , with
the threat of Greece exiting the euro currency union hanging
over the summit. MacDougall said the debt crisis in  Europe  will
be the main focus of discussions.  Harper will urge his colleagues to follow through on
earlier policy pledges, according to a statement issued by his
office. “ Canada ’s message at the G-20 will be that economic
growth and fiscal discipline are not mutually exclusive, they go
hand in hand,” Harper said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
