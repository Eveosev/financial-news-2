Uganda , Africa’s biggest coffee
exporter, expects shipments of the beans to drop 33 percent this
month, the Uganda Coffee Development Authority said.  Shipments of the crop may slump to 250,000 60-kilogram
(132-pound) bags from 370,924 bags a year earlier, the Kampala-
based agency said in an e-mailed report today, without providing
details. The country exported 252,548 bags registered last
month, the most this season, the authority said.  A prolonged rainy season in the harvesting regions is
hampering drying and deliveries of the beans, David Muwonge, an
official of the National Union of Coffee Agribusiness and Farm
Enterprises, said by phone from Kampala, the capital.  The European Union,  Sudan , U.S., India, Morocco,  Ecuador ,
 Switzerland , Japan and  South Africa  are some of the major
importers of Uganda’s coffee, according to the authority.  Uganda may export 3.1 million to 3.2 million bags in the
2011-12 season, which started on Oct. 1 and runs through
September, according to the authority. This compares with the
forecast of 2.8 million to 2.9 million given by National Union
of Coffee Agribusinesses and Farm Enterprises on May 8.  Shipments from October through May, the eighth month of the
season, dropped to 1.74 million bags valued at $256.98 million,
from 1.75 million bags worth $242.37 million a year earlier, the
authority said.  Exports in Season  The nation exported 3.15 million bags worth $448.89 million
in 2010-11, according to the authority. Eastern  Africa  Fine
Coffee Association says Uganda consumes about 3 percent of its
annual crop.  Uganda was Africa’s biggest coffee exporter and the world’s
ninth-largest in the 12 months through last September, according
to the London-based International Coffee Organization. Robusta

85 percent of Ugandan production, according to the authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
