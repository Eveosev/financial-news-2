The ruble depreciated for the first
day in three after Moody’s Investors Service downgraded the debt
ratings of Spain and Cyprus.  The Russian currency lost 0.5 percent to 32.5975 per dollar
by the close in Moscow. The ruble lost 0.7 percent to 41.0502
per euro and 0.6 percent to 36.4012 against the central bank’s
target dollar-euro basket.  Moody’s cut Spain’s rating three steps to Baa3 yesterday,
two levels below  Russia ’s level of Baa1, signaling  Europe ’s debt
crisis is deepening. The ratings service lowered Cyprus’s rating
to Ba3 from Ba1.  Brent crude  dropped 0.5 percent to $96.62 per
barrel, its sixth day of losses.  “The ruble’s weakness mainly came from oil falling,” Igor Akinshin, a currency trader at  Alfa Bank  in Moscow, said by e-
mail. “The fundamentals are not looking good.”  The ruble’s declines were limited today by companies
preparing for monthly tax payments, Akinshin said. Exporters
convert revenue from abroad into rubles to pay the Russian
government in the second half of every month, boosting the
currency.  Investors increased bets on the currency weakening, with
non-deliverable forwards showing the ruble at 33.1250 per dollar
in three months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
