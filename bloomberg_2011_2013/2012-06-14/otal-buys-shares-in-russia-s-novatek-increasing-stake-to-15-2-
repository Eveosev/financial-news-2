Total SA (FP)  acquired additional shares
in OAO Novatek,  Russia ’s second-biggest natural-gas producer,
bringing its stake to 15.16 percent.  The French energy producer added 5 million shares as of May
24, Novatek said today in a regulatory filing. Based on the
closing price in  London  that day, the stake would have cost
about $48.5 million.  Novatek dropped 39 percent to an 19-month low on May 30 of
$92.45 from this year’s high in March as Russia’s government
debated raising its gas extraction tax rate to the level of gas
exporter OAO Gazprom in 2015. The global depositary receipts
fell 1 percent to $105.80 at 1:41 p.m. in London.  Following the slump, Novatek said June 7 that it plans to
buy back as much as $600 million of stock in the next 12 months.  In April, Total said it had increased its Novatek stake to
15 percent after buying 0.3 percent of Novatek on the market for
about $120 million. The Paris-based company agreed in March 2011
to buy 12 percent of Novatek for about $4 billion, with the
right to build its holding to 19.4 percent in three years.  Novatek referred questions on Total’s purchase to the
French company. The company didn’t say in its filing whether the
stock was bought in the market. Anastasia Zhivulina, a Total
spokeswoman, wasn’t immediately available for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
