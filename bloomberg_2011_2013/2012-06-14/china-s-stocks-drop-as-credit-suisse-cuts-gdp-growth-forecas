China’s stocks  fell the most in more
than a week as Credit Suisse Group AG and Deutsche Bank AG
lowered their Chinese economic growth forecasts and a Moody’s
Investors Service cut of Spain’s debt rating hurt prospects for
a resolution to  Europe ’s debt crisis.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd.  and  China
Construction Bank Corp. (939)  paced declines for banks on concern
slowing growth will sap demand for loans. Anhui Conch Cement
Co., China’s biggest cement maker, slid to a two-month low after
Macquarie Group Ltd. cut its recommendation on the stock. Liquor
maker  Kweichow Moutai Co. (600519)  led a gauge of consumer staples stocks
to the biggest gain among industry groups on expectations their
earnings will better withstand the decelerating economy.  “Major risks still come from overseas and that’ll raise
the  risk premium  for equities,” said  Wang Zheng , Shanghai-based
chief investment officer at Jingxi Investment Management Co.,
which manages about $120 million. “Earnings have yet to hit a
bottom because a slowdown in economic growth isn’t over.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  slid 22.98 points, or 1
percent, to 2,295.95 at the close, the biggest slide since June
4. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  lost 0.8 percent to 2,560.42. The  Bloomberg
China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) , the measure of the most-traded U.S.-listed
Chinese companies, retreated 0.9 percent in New York yesterday.  Concerns that a growth slowdown is deepening and  Greece 
will leave the euro area have pushed the Shanghai index down 6.7
percent from this year’s high set on March 2. Stocks in the
measure are valued at 9.95 times estimated earnings, compared
with the five-year average of 17.8, Bloomberg weekly  data 
showed.  Lower Growth  Thirty-day  volatility  in the gauge was at 15.42 today,
compared with this year’s average of 18.56. About 7.9 billion
shares changed hands in the  Shanghai Stock Exchange  yesterday,
10 percent lower than the daily average this year.  ICBC, the nation’s biggest listed lender, dropped 1.2
percent to 3.95  yuan . Construction Bank, the second largest,
fell 0.5 percent to 4.42 yuan. Bank of China Ltd., the third
biggest, slipped 1.1 percent to 2.83 yuan.  The China Banking Regulatory Commission is preparing to
ease restrictions on bank lending to local government finance
vehicles and the property industry, the  China Daily  reported
today, citing an unidentified official at the regulator.
Stabilizing economic growth has become the government’s top
priority, it said.  Credit Suisse cut China’s growth forecast for 2012 to 7.7
percent from 8 percent and for 2013 to 7.9 percent from 8.2
percent, while Deutsche Bank lowered its 2012 estimate to 7.9
percent from 8.2 percent.  European Risk  A “meaningful” investment rebound is unlikely in the
“foreseeable future,” Tao Dong, an economist at Credit Suisse,
wrote in a note to clients. He also lowered his 2012 inflation
forecast to 3.1 percent from 3.7 percent, while the 2013
estimate was halved to 2.3 percent on the risk of deflation.  Moody’s downgraded  Spain ’s credit rating by three steps to
Baa3 from A3 yesterday, citing the nation’s increased debt
burden, weakening economy and limited access to  capital markets .
Europe is China’s largest export market, making up about 18
percent of the nation’s overseas shipments, according to Shenyin
& Wanguo Securities Co.  “For the next several months, we are still going to be
overshadowed by the macro economic background in Europe,”  Sam Mahtani, who oversees about $5 billion as director of  emerging
markets  at F&C Asset Management Plc in London, said by phone
yesterday. “China will roll out incremental measures to help
the economy and can manage to engineer a soft landing, while
what happens in Greece, Spain and Italy will obviously have a
very significant impact on sentiment toward emerging markets
like China.”  Cement Cut  Anhui Conch dropped 1.5 percent to 15.87 yuan, the lowest
close since March 30. Gansu Qilianshan Cement Group Co. lost 5
percent to 12.09 yuan.  Huaxin Cement Co. (600801) , the Chinese affiliate
of Holcim Ltd., fell 2.7 percent to 14.31 yuan.  Anhui Conch was downgraded to underperform from outperform
amid weaker prices and likelihood that the consensus earnings
estimates for the cement industry will be reduced, Pelen Ji, an
analyst at Macquarie, wrote in a note dated yesterday.  Macquarie lowered the 2012 earnings estimates for most
cement producers by between 10 percent and 25 percent and
expected prices of the building material to fall between 6
percent and 14 percent, according to the note.  A measure tracking 23 consumer staples stocks on the CSI
300 climbed 1.3 percent, the most among the 10 industry groups.  Kweichow Moutai, China’s biggest producer of baijiu liquor
by market value, rose 2.3 percent to 244.59 yuan.  Wuliangye
Yibin Co. (000858) , the second biggest, advanced 1.8 percent to 32.94
yuan. Luzhou Laojiao Co., a sprits producer in southwest
province of Sichuan, gained 1.4 percent to 41.34 yuan.  No Hard Landing  Chinese consumer goods producers posted 18 percent earnings
growth on average in the first quarter of this year, compared
with a 3.6 percent gain for all companies on the Shanghai
Composite, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  “I believe there will not be any hard landing,” Agnes Deng, the Hong Kong-based head of  Hong Kong  and China equities
for Baring Asset Management, which oversees $48.1 billion, said
in a briefing in Hong Kong yesterday. “Stocks valuation has
already priced in the risk of a potential hard-landing. I remain
optimistic towards China’s equities market.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
