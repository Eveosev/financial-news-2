New York  gasoline weakened against
futures as shipments from Europe are expected to gain.  Twenty-three  oil tankers  were hired, or are expected to be
chartered, in the period to June 27, according to the median
estimate in a survey yesterday of seven shipbrokers, traders and
owners who specialize in shipping gasoline. Thatâ€™s up from 17 in
the prior two-week period.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in New York Harbor slipped
1.13 cents to a discount of 0.25 cent to futures traded on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange  at 11:44 a.m., according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery fell 0.06 cent to $2.6636
a gallon.  Total gasoline imports  to the East Coast dropped 18 percent
last week to 607,000 barrels a day, according to the Energy
Department.  The premium for ultra-low-sulfur  diesel  at the New York hub
held at 9.38 cents versus Nymex heating oil futures.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
 Gulf Coast  widened 0.87 cents to 10.5 cents a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
