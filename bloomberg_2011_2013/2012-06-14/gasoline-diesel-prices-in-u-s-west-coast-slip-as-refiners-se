Gasoline and diesel in the U.S. West
Coast weakened for the first time in three days as refiners were
seen selling on the spot markets and after fuel inventories in
the region grew last week.  Gasoline supplies on the West Coast, or Padd 5, rose 4.6
percent to 27.1 million barrels in the week ended June 8, the
highest level since April, the Energy Department said yesterday.
 Tesoro Corp. (TSO)  finished work at the 97,000-barrel-a-day  Los
Angeles  refinery last week.  California-blend, or Carbob, gasoline in Los Angeles
dropped 3.5 cents to 7 cents a gallon below futures traded on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 4:44 p.m., according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Carbob in  San Francisco  also slipped 2
cents to trade even with Los Angeles. Retail gasoline prices in
 Southern California  tumbled 12.6 cents to $4.057 per gallon, AAA
said in an e-mailed statement.  “This is the first time since the financial meltdown of
2008 that Southern California has experienced two consecutive
weeks of double-digit gas prices declines,” said Jeffrey
Spring, a Costa Mesa, California-based spokesman for the
motoring group. “Prices have returned to levels not seen since
mid-February because of the rapid drop in wholesale prices.”  California-blend, or CARB, diesel in Los Angeles slipped
0.25 cent to 4.13 cents a gallon above Nymex heating oil
futures. The same fuel in San Francisco fell 1 cent to a 5.5-
cent premium.  Low-sulfur diesel in  Portland ,  Oregon , fell 1.5 cents to a
premium of 8.5 cents a gallon above futures. Conventional, 87-
octane gasoline in  there  tumbled 4 cents to 16 cent below  New
York  gasoline futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
