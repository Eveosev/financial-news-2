France ’s credit rating was cut one
step to BBB+ from by Egan-Jones Ratings Co., citing
“deterioration” in the nation’s credit metrics and the need
for support of the country’s banks.  Yields on French government bonds due in 10 years have
fallen 47 basis points, or 0.47 percentage point, since the end
of last year.  Francois Hollande , who defeated French President
Nicolas Sarkozy last month to become the first Socialist in 17
years to control Europe’s second-biggest economy, pledged to
push for less austerity and more growth in the region.  “As the crisis evolves, we expect that France will be
pressured,” the Haverford, Pennsylvania-based company said
today in a statement. “Hollande will be under pressure to keep
campaign promises, which will ultimately hurt credit quality.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
