Investors want global leaders
meeting in Mexico next week to take action on reviving economic
growth, the  Institute of International Finance  said.  “Markets will be looking expectantly for evidence of a
globally coordinated policy response targeted to revive growth
prospects worldwide on a sustainable basis,” IIF Managing
Director  Charles Dallara  said in a letter today to leaders
attending the Group of 20 summit in Los Cabos, Mexico, on June
18-19.  The summit will give European leaders a chance to discuss
economic concerns with heads of other major economies, including
U.S. President  Barack Obama . European governments are more
focused on building a consensus for another summit they are
holding later this month, a U.S. official said yesterday on
condition of anonymity.  Europe’s 100 billion-euro ($126 billion) bailout last
weekend of Spain’s banks showed “evidence of a willingness to
take collective and coordinated action,” Dallara said. The
bailout was a “vital near-term crisis-fighting measure” and
highlights the potential benefits of allowing the European
Stability Mechanism, or ESM, to recapitalize banks when needed,
he said.  French President  Francois Hollande  has called for the ESM
to be used to recapitalize banks, the French daily Le Monde
reported.  Greek Election  Dallara said a new Greek government following June 17
elections should “reaffirm its commitment to the central tenets
of its reform program -- liberalizing labor and product markets,
advancing privatization, and strengthening the competitiveness
of the economy with a greater focus on fiscal and structural
reforms.”  Greece  votes a second time in six weeks after a May 6
ballot failed to yield a government. The Syriza party has
promised to abrogate the terms of the 240 billion-euro ($303
billion) bailout from the European Commission,  European Central
Bank  and  International Monetary Fund , which calls for cuts that
risk deepening the country’s worst recession since World War II.  “ Europe  absolutely needs to chart a course” to be able to
“move out of this lurch, crisis-to-crisis mode,” Dallara said
at a news conference in Washington today.  The IMF “is likely going to have to play a more active
role in supporting the European efforts,” he said. “A bit of
ingenuity and creativity may be needed because the IMF remains
well-positioned to play a supportive role.”  The Washington-based IMF could coordinate a fund to help
countries provide job training to reduce unemployment, Dallara
said.  Dallara said last week that he plans to step down as
managing director this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
