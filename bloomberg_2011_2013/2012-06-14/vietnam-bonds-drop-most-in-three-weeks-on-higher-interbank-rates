Vietnam ’s benchmark bonds dropped,
pushing the five-year yield up by the most in three weeks, as
higher rates for loans between banks sapped demand for debt. The
dong was little changed.  “Interbank rates have increased recently and spurred
investors to seek higher return in bonds,” said Do Hoang Quynh Trang, a fixed-income trader at Hanoi-based Ocean Commercial
Joint-Stock Bank. “The increases in bond yields are probably
just temporary.”  The  overnight interbank deposit rate  rose 16 basis points,
or 0.16 percentage point, to 4.29 percent today, according to
data from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The  yield  on the five-year notes climbed for a third day,
adding six basis points to 9.57 percent, according to a daily
fixing rate from banks compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the biggest
increase since May 22.  The dong traded at 20,958 per dollar as of 3:53 p.m. in
Hanoi, compared with 20,965 late yesterday, according to data
from banks compiled by Bloomberg. The central bank set the
 reference rate  at 20,828 per dollar, unchanged since Dec. 26,
according to its website. The currency is allowed to fluctuate
by as much as 1 percent on either side of the official rate.  --Nguyen Dieu Tu Uyen. Editor: James Regan  To contact the reporter on this story:
