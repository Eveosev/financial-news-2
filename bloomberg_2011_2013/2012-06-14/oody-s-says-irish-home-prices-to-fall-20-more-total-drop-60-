Irish home prices will fall a
further 20 percent, taking the total drop to 60 percent from
their 2007 peak, Moody’s Investors Service said.  “It will be difficult for distressed borrowers to
significantly increase their debt servicing capabilities and so
arrears are likely to continue increasing,” Moody’s said in
an analysis of Irish Prime RMBS performance.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
