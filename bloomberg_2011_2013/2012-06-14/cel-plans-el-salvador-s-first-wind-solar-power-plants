Comision Ejecutiva Hidroelectrica
del Rio Lempa ,  El Salvador ’s state-owned utility, is planning
the nation’s first utility-scale solar and wind projects to
diversify its energy mix.  CEL, as the company is known, will auction development
rights for a 14.2-megawatt solar farm in 2013 and for a 42-
megawatt wind farm the following year, Ramon Moreno, a spokesman
for the San Salvador-based utility, said today in an e-mail.  A shortage of new sites for large hydroelectric dams in El
Salvador prompted CEL to consider alternative sources of
electricity, Moreno said. The country has no large wind or solar
projects connected to its  power grid  now.  “Wind and solar energies offer a good potential and allow
a way to diversify the electric generation mix in the country,”
Moreno said.  CEL is seeking a consulting company to draft auction
documents for the solar farm, which will be financed by KfW
Bankengruppe,  Germany ’s state development bank, he said. It’s
expected to go into operation in 2014.  The wind project in the northern city of Metapan will cost
about $110 million and is expected to start producing power in
2015, he said.  CEL, which  operated  four hydroelectric dams with 472
megawatts of generation capacity in 2009, is still deciding
whether it will own the projects or sign long-term contracts to
buy the electricity they produce, he said.  El Salvador generated about 70 percent of its electricity
from oil and hydroelectric dams in 2009, according to the
 International Energy Agency ’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
