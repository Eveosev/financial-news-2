Chinese officials are investigating
reports that a woman who was seven months pregnant was forced to
have an abortion because she couldn’t pay a 40,000  yuan  ($6,300)
fine for violating the national one-child policy.  The Shaanxi provincial branch of  China ’s  family-planning
agency  sent a team to investigate the claim after reports about
it surfaced online, according to a  statement  released yesterday.
The agency urged officials to “enforce the law civilly, and
resolutely put an end to late-term induction of pregnancy.”  The allegations about the forced abortion sparked outrage
on Chinese microblogging services about the methods used by
local officials to control growth in the country’s population of
1.3 billion. The Communist Party has said in the past it may
consider easing the policy as the size of China’s working-age
population declines.  The woman, identified as 23-year-old Feng Jianmei, agreed
to have the abortion after officials in Zhenping County
repeatedly gave her “ideological and counseling services,”
according to a  statement  published June 11 on the county family
planning agency website. It said the abortion was done “in
accordance with law.”  In a front-page article today, the state-run Global Times
newspaper contradicted that account, saying that local officials
detained Feng, blindfolded her and then forced her to sign an
agreement to have the abortion. It quoted her husband, Deng
Jiyuan.  Photos showing Feng lying in bed next to the dead baby were
posted online a week after the abortion, the newspaper said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
