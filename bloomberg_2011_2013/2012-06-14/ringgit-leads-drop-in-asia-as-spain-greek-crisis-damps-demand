Indonesia ’s rupiah and Malaysia’s
ringgit led declines in Asian currencies after  Spain ’s credit
rating was cut and data in the U.S. renewed concern the global
economic recovery is faltering.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of shares fell after Moody’s
Investors Service lowered ratings on Spain and Cyprus, citing
increased debt burdens. Greece will hold elections this weekend,
which may determine if the country stays in the euro. The
Philippine peso reached a one-month high after exports climbed
more than economists predicted in April.  “The general weakness story on Asian currencies is still
there,” said Saktiandi Supaat, head of foreign-exchange
research at  Malayan Banking Bhd. (MAY)  in Singapore. “Fiscal
austerity is dragging down  Europe ’s growth outlook. There’s a
bit of caution ahead of the Greek elections.”  The rupiah weakened 0.6 percent to 9,480 per dollar as of
3:40 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg. The ringgit fell 0.2 percent to 3.1862
and India’s rupee lost 0.2 percent to 55.79. The peso advanced
0.2 percent to 42.558.  Moody’s yesterday cut Spain’s rating three steps to Baa3
from A3, and lowered Cyprus’s bond rating to Ba3 from Ba1,
attributing the downgrade to the material increase in the
likelihood of a Greek exit from the euro area. Retail sales in
the U.S. fell for a second month in May, Commerce Department
figures showed yesterday. Euro-area industrial production
declined for a second month in April, the European Union
statistics office said yesterday.  Retail Sales  The rupiah dropped for a second day, capping a 2.5 percent
slide in the past one month, after demand at the central bank’s
dollar term deposit offering was below expectations.  Bank Indonesia  accepted $700 million of seven- and 14-day
deposits yesterday at 0.17 percent and 0.18 percent,
respectively. That compared with rates in the U.S. of 0.23
percent for one week and 0.24 percent for 15 days. The auction
was expected by the central bank to tempt local lenders to bring
home about $2 billion a day on average, bolstering the rupiah.  “The demand was not too strong,” said Klara Pramesti, a
Jakarta-based treasury analyst at PT Bank Negara Indonesia.
“Investors still tend to seek safe havens so whatever
instruments we introduce will not have much effect until global
conditions stabilize.”  The peso reached the highest level since May 11 after
overseas shipments rose 7.6 percent in April from a year
earlier, following a 0.8 percent contraction in March.
Economists predicted a 0.5 percent gain in a Bloomberg survey.  The central bank held its benchmark  interest rate  at 4
percent today, joining counterparts in Thailand,  South Korea  and
Indonesia in leaving borrowing costs unchanged this month.  Yuan Advances  China’s  yuan  declined 0.02 percent to 6.3703 per dollar in
Shanghai, according to China Foreign Exchange Trade System. The
central bank set its  reference rate  0.13 percent stronger at
6.3191.  Credit Suisse Group AG cut China’s economic growth forecast
for 2012 to 7.7 percent from 8 percent and that for 2013 to 7.9
percent from 8.2 percent, economist Tao Dong wrote in a June 13
note to clients.  Elsewhere, Taiwan’s dollar gained 0.1 percent to NT$29.954
and South Korea’s won gained 0.2 percent to 1,166.35. Thailand’s
baht was little changed at 31.57 versus U.S. currency and the
Vietnamese dong was steady at 20,958.  To contact the reporters on this story:
