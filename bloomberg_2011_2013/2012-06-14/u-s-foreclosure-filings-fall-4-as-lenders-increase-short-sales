Foreclosure filings in the U.S. fell
4 percent in May from a year earlier as lenders disposed of more
properties through short sales, where the price is less than the
amount owed, according to  RealtyTrac Inc.   Default, auction and repossession notices were sent to
205,990 properties, or one in every 639 households, the  Irvine ,
California-based data firm said today in a  report . The decline
was the 20th straight on a year-over-year basis.  Home seizures plunged 18 percent from a year earlier even
as initial notices of  foreclosure  increased, indicating that
lenders are turning to alternatives to repossessions as they
work through delinquent mortgages. Properties sold in short
sales fetched $27,000 more than bank-owned homes in the first
quarter, according to RealtyTrac.  “More banks are now recognizing that treating the problem
of  delinquent  mortgages with short sales rather than bank
repossessions can help them minimize their losses,” RealtyTrac
Chief Executive Officer Brandon Moore said in the statement.
Short sales reduce the cost to lenders to “manage, maintain and
market for sale” seized homes, he said.  Total filings last month increased 9 percent from April.
First-time filings totaled 109,051, up 12 percent from April and
16 percent from a year earlier and the most since October 2011,
according to RealtyTrac. A “higher percentage” of foreclosure
starts will probably end up as short sales as lenders realize
the economic advantage, Moore said.  Highest Rates  Georgia had the highest rate of foreclosure filings per
household last month, at one in every 300, the first time since
February 2006 that the state has led the nation. Filings there
jumped 33 percent from April and 30 percent from May 2011.  Arizona  ranked second, at one filing for every 305
households, and  Nevada  was third at one in 313. California
ranked fourth at one in 324, followed by Illinois at one in 325
and Florida at one 340.  Ohio ,  Michigan , South Carolina and  Utah 
rounded out the top 10 highest rates, RealtyTrac said.  Among the 20 largest metropolitan areas, Riverside-San
Bernardino in California had the highest foreclosure rate, even
as filings fell 3 percent from a year earlier. Atlanta ranked
second, with filings up 28 percent, and Phoenix was third, with
filings down 30 percent.  Chicago had the fourth-highest foreclosure rate, with a 56
percent jump in filings. Tampa, Florida, where filings more than
doubled, ranked fifth.  RealtyTrac sells default data from more than 2,200 counties
representing 90 percent of the  U.S. population .  To contact the reporter on this story:
