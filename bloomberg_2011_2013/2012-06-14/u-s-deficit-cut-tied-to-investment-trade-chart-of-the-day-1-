More business investment and a
narrower current-account gap are necessary for “a credible
reduction” in the  U.S. budget deficit , according to Andrew Smithers, chairman of the Smithers & Co. advisory firm.  The CHART OF THE DAY displays corporate spending on
buildings and equipment as a percentage of gross domestic
product in the top panel and the current-account balance, the
broadest gauge of international trade, in the bottom panel. The
data is compiled by the Commerce Department.  Investment generated 10.4 percent of first-quarter GDP,
below an average of 10.8 percent for the past six decades. Last
quarter’s gap in the current account widened to $137.3 billion,
exceeding a median estimate of $131.9 billion among economists
in a Bloomberg survey.  Cutting the government’s trillion-dollar deficit hinges on
business and trade because households are in “very poor” shape
financially, Smithers wrote yesterday in a report. The savings
rate in April was 3.4 percent, trailing the 7 percent average
since 1959, Commerce Department figures show.  “An improvement in the trade account is likely to bring
with it a rise in business investment,” wrote Smithers, based
in London, who provides institutional investors with advice on
 asset allocation .  The federal deficit for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30
will be $1.17 trillion, according to a March projection by the
 Congressional Budget Office . While the gap would be 10 percent
narrower than last fiscal year’s $1.3 billion, it would be the
fourth straight annual shortfall of more than $1 trillion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
