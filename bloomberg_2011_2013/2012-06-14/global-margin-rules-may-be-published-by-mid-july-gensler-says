Global regulators may propose
international swap-collateral standards by mid-July to prevent
financial firms from exploiting rule differences between
countries, said Gary Gensler, chairman of the U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission.  The CFTC,  Federal Reserve , Securities and Exchange
Commission and international regulators have been seeking
consensus on margin policy standards for the  $648 trillion  over-
the-counter swap market. The standards would apply to direct
trades between buyers and sellers instead of derivatives
guaranteed by central clearinghouses.  “Look forward to seeing this margin release in the next
two or three weeks,” Gensler said today during a speech at an
 Institute of International Bankers ’ conference in New York.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and other
U.S. banks have told regulators that differences between
countries could hurt their ability to compete with overseas
rivals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
