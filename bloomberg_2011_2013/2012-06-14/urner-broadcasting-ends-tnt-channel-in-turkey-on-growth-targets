Turner Broadcasting System Inc., a
unit of  Time Warner Inc. (TWX) , closed its TNT television operations
in Turkey after failing to meet performance and growth targets.  The company provided no further details about the reasons
for the closure in an e-mailed statement today. Turner will
continue to run the Cartoon Network and the CNN Turk news
channel and is looking for other opportunities in the country,
it said. Turner said it’s committed to its relationship with
 Dogan Sirketler Grubu Holding AS (DOHOL)  in CNN Turk.  Time Warner, also owner of Hollywood’s Warner Bros.
studios, is among foreign media companies that have invested in
Turkey, along with  News Corp. (NWSA)  and  Axel Springer AG. (SPR)  Time Warner
started the TNT channel in Turkey in 2008 as a network for
premier films and relaunched it last year as a general
entertainment channel, according to Turner’s website.  Spending on advertising in  Turkey  surged 20 percent last
year to $2.4 billion, of which 57 percent was for television
commercials, the Turkish Association of Advertising Agencies
said in March. The market may grow 15 percent this year, the
group said.  Time Warner is competing with Dubai-based buyout firm
Abraaj Capital Ltd. to purchase the ATV news channel in Turkey,
two people with direct knowledge of the situation said on May
30. Both companies placed binding bids, they said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
