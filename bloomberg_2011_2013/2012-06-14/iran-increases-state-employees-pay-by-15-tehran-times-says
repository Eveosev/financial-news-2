Iran ’s government approved a 15
percent increase in state employees’ salaries for the Iranian
year that began on March 20, the  Tehran Times  reported, citing a
top official.  The new salary levels will apply from this month, the
newspaper said, citing Behrouz Moradi, the vice president for
planning and strategic supervision.  Workers paid on a daily basis will get 18 percent
increases, the Times said.  Iran’s government has to increase pay in line with the
country’s inflation rate, which is above 20 percent, according
to official figures, the newspaper said.  The report didn’t specify minimum pay rates for salaried
employees or workers on wages.  To contact the reporter on this story:
