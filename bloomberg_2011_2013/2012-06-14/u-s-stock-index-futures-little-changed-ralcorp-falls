U.S. stocks advanced, erasing a
weekly loss for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, amid reports
policy makers may take steps to assist economies battered by
Europe’s sovereign debt crisis.  All 10 groups in the S&P 500 rose, led by telephone service
providers. Home Depot Inc. and  Walt Disney Co. (DIS)  added at least
2.1 percent after data on inflation and jobless claims fueled
bets the  Federal Reserve  will act to spur growth.  Exxon Mobil
Corp. (XOM) , the largest energy producer by market value, increased
1.9 percent as oil rallied. Travelers Cos. and  Bank of America
Corp. (BAC)  gained at least 2.1 percent as financial companies jumped.  The S&P 500 gained 1.1 percent to 1,329.10 at 4 p.m. in New
York. The benchmark index for American equities is up 0.3
percent for the week. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose
155.53 points, or 1.2 percent, to 12,651.91 today. Trading
volume for exchange-listed stocks in the U.S. was about 6.6
billion shares, 2.5 percent below the three-month average.  “It’s a sign that they’re talking and that’s good,” Rod Smyth, the Richmond, Virginia-based chief investment strategist
of Riverfront Investment Group, which manages $3 billion, said
in a telephone interview. “Equity investors are poised with the
knowledge that if European policy makers can figure out a way to
stem the vicious cycle that’s been building, then stocks look
really cheap and bonds look expensive.”  The  S&P 500  tumbled as much a 9.9 percent from a four-year
high in April through June 1 amid lower-than-forecast economic
data and concern Europe’s debt crisis was spreading. The index
has rebounded 4 percent since, and trades at 13.4 times its
companies’ reported earnings, below the average of 16.4 since
1954, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The S&P 500 fell
yesterday as borrowing costs rose in Italy and Germany before
elections in Greece on June 17 that may determine whether the
Mediterranean nation will leave the euro area.  Central Banks  Stocks extended gains today amid reports of plans by
central banks. Bloomberg News reported that U.K. Chancellor of
the Exchequer  George Osborne  and  Bank of England  Governor Mervyn King are preparing two programs to increase the flow of credit.
Reuters said that central banks are prepared to take action if
needed to boost liquidity in financial markets if the Greek
elections cause tumultuous trading, citing officials linked to
the Group of 20 nations.  Speculation grew that the Federal Reserve will discuss
stimulus efforts at its meeting next week after reports showed
 jobless  claims unexpectedly climbed by 6,000 to 386,000 last
week and the cost of living fell by the most in more than three
years.  ‘Good Stage’  “Good inflation data and weak employment is a good stage
for a Fed policy response,”  Kevin Shacknofsky , who helps manage
about $5 billion for Alpine Mutual Funds in Purchase, New York,
said in an e-mail. “We are at the stage where bad news is good
news in terms of a policy response. Jobs will be the critical
factor that influences the Fed.”  Home Depot (HD) , the largest U.S. home-improvement retailer,
climbed 2.3 percent to $52.16 and Disney, the world’s largest
entertainment company, advanced 2.1 percent to $47.18. Exxon
Mobil increased 1.9 percent to $82.13 and  Cabot Oil & Gas Corp. (COG) 
jumped 8.6 percent to $35.04 as energy shares in the S&P 500
gained 1.7 percent as a group.  Travelers added 2.4 percent to $63.12, the biggest gain in
the Dow, while Bank of America, the second-biggest U.S. lender,
climbed 2.1 percent to $7.66 as financial stocks rallied 1.3
percent.  Telephone companies jumped 1.9 percent as a group. Consumer
discretionary stocks, which include retailers, hotel chains and
restaurant companies, climbed 1.4 percent. An S&P index of
homebuilders advanced 4.1 percent, as  Lennar Corp. (LEN)  increased 3.6
percent to $25.55 and  PulteGroup Inc. (PHM)  added 5.2 percent to
$8.85.  Casino Machines  International Game Technology (IGT)  rose 14 percent,  the most  in
the S&P 500, to $15.12. The maker of casino machines announced a
share buyback plan of as much as $1 billion in an effort to
reward investors after a 23 percent stock drop this year.  Kroger Co. (KR)  climbed 6.1 percent to $22.58. The largest U.S.
grocery-store chain said  profit  for the year ending Jan. 31 will
be as much as $2.40 a share, up from a prior forecast of as much
as $2.38. Kroger also said its board approved a new $1 billion
share buyback program, replacing an authorization that was
exhausted on June 12.  Family Dollar Stores Inc. (FDO)  advanced 4 percent to a record
$72.85. The discount retailer was raised to buy from neutral at
Cleveland Research Co. on expectation new merchandising is
driving up sales.  Edwards Lifesciences Corp. (EW)  rose 7 percent to $96.88 for the
third-biggest advance in the S&P 500. The company won the
backing of U.S. advisers for an expanded use of its Sapien heart
valve as an alternative to open-heart surgery.  Fed Meeting  The Fed, which will gather two days after the Greek
election, has identified the country’s exit from the euro as an
outcome that would deepen the crisis and threaten the U.S.
expansion. The central banks bought $2.3 trillion of bonds in
two rounds of so-called quantitative easing from 2008 through
2011 to stimulate growth through lower borrowing costs.  Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told lawmakers last week the
“central question” confronting the Fed at its June 19-20
meeting is whether growth is fast enough to make “material
progress” reducing unemployment. Fed officials, including Vice
Chairman  Janet Yellen , have said there’s scope for further
easing at some point to reduce a jobless rate persisting above 8
percent.  “We’re still on the fence right now whether there is going
to be another round of quantitative easing,” Michael Mullaney,
who helps manage $9.5 billion as chief investment officer at
Fiduciary Trust in Boston, said in a phone interview. “We’re
going to be cautious for the foreseeable future. There’s so many
banana peels on the floor right now you can slip on any one of
them at any time.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
