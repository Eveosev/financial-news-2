Finland’s economy will contract less
than previously forecast this year after household spending
spurred growth in the first quarter, Tapiola Bank said.  Gross domestic product will shrink 0.5 percent in 2012,
less than the 1.5 percent drop forecast on Dec. 15, the Espoo,
Finland-based bank said in an e-mailed statement. Next year, the
Nordic country’s GDP will increase by 0.5 percent.  Finland’s economy tracks the other developed nations with
about a six-month lag, Tapiola said. Finland’s economy, which
relies on exports for 40 percent of its output, is vulnerable to
the deepening debt crisis in  Europe .  To contact the reporter on this story:
