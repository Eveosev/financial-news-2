Citadel Capital SAE  said it closed
financing for a $3.7 billion petroleum refinery near Cairo, a
project it said will cut the country’s diesel imports by half.  The financing package for Egyptian Refining Co. includes
$2.6 billion of debt, already finalized in August 2010, and $1.1
billion of equity from investors led by Qatar Petroleum
International with $363 million, or a 27.9 percent holding, and
Egyptian General Petroleum Corp. with $270 million, or a 23.8
percent stake, the Cairo-based firm said in an e-mailed
statement today.  The project is planned to produce more than 4.1 million
tons of petroleum products annually, including more than 2.3
million tons of Euro V diesel, Citadel said, helping reduce
imports. The announcement comes the same day Egypt’s
constitutional court issued rulings that dissolved parliament
and allowed Ahmed Shafik, former president  Hosni Mubarak ’s last
prime minister, to remain in the final round of the presidential
vote due to start June 16.  “The financial close of ERC confirms to international
investors and the global community that Egypt is open for
business,” Citadel Chairman Ahmed Heikal said in the statement.
“The signal this sends is huge. ERC is a key component of
Egypt’s energy security going forward.”  The loan package for ERC has $2.35 billion of senior debt
and $225 million of subordinated debt from institutions
including  Japan Bank for International Cooperation , Nippon
Export and Investment Insurance, the Export Import Bank of
Korea, the  European Investment Bank  and the  African Development
Bank , Citadel said.  Construction is due to start at the end of 2013 when
engineering works are completed.  Shares of Citadel  were unchanged at 2.56 Egyptian pounds at
the close in Cairo today, valuing the company at 2.12 billion
pounds ($351 million). The stock is up 0.4 percent this year,
compared with a 22 percent advance for the benchmark  EGX 30
Index. (EGX30)   To contact the reporter on this story:
