SG-SSB Ltd. (SGSSB) , the Ghanaian unit of
Societe Generale SA, gained the most in almost seven months as
investors bet the company’s earnings will increase after it
bought Treasury bills with higher yields.  The stock gained 7.9 percent to 41 pesewas by the close in
Accra, the capital, the biggest increase since Nov. 23.  “The shares were bought by non-resident institutional
investors that have confidence in the bank’s future earnings
ability,” Anastacia Arko, a stock analyst at Databank Financial
Services Ltd. in Accra, said by phone. “We expect the bank to
deliver better second-quarter results as it rightly invested in
 government securities  to take advantage of rising yields,” she
said, declining to give a specific forecast.  Ghana ’s central bank has been accepting higher yields on
its benchmark 91-day Treasury bill  yield  in a bid to remove
excess cedis from the local  currency market . The rate was 20.2
percent at the most recent auction on June 8 and may climb to 25
percent by the end of the year, Databank’s head of asset
management, Daniel Ogbarmey Tetteh, said on June 11.  Arko said SG-SSB’s “fundamentals” are strong and the
stock price may rise to as much as 63 pesewas by the end of
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
