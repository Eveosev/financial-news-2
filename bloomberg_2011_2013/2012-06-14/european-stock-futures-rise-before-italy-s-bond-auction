European stock-index futures climbed
as investors awaited Italy’s first bond sale since Spain was
offered as much as 100 billion euros ($126 billion) to bail out
its banks. U.S. index futures rose, while Asian shares fell.  British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc (BSY)  may decline after
winning the bidding to show 116 English Premier League soccer
matches starting in the 2013-14 season.  Futures on the Euro Stoxx 50 Index expiring this month
advanced 0.4 percent to 2,145 at 7:12 a.m. in  London . Contracts
on the U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index dropped 0.1 percent. Futures on the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in September rose 0.4
percent. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index slipped 0.3 percent.  European stocks decreased 0.4 percent yesterday as
borrowing costs increased at debt auctions in Germany and Italy.  Moody’s Investors Service yesterday cut Spain’s rating by
three steps to Baa3 from A3, citing the nation’s increased debt
burden, weakening economy and limited access to  capital markets .
Moody’s also lowered Cyprus’s bond rating to Ba3 from Ba1,
attributing the downgrade to the increased likelihood of  Greece 
leaving the euro area. The country’s government may have to give
more support to Cypriot banks as a consequence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
