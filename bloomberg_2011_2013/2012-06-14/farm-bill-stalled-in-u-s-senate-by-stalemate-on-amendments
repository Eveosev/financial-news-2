The  U.S. Senate  has delayed
consideration of a farm bill that would cut agricultural
programs by $23.6 billion over 10 years because lawmakers
couldn’t agree on how many amendments may be offered.  The bill may be picked up again next week if a deal on
amendments is reached, Majority Leader  Harry Reid , a Nevada
Democrat, said today in remarks on the Senate floor. The chamber
will have no more votes this week, he said. The delay in the
bill, which is being criticized in the  House of Representatives 
for cutting farm payments too deeply, complicates efforts to
pass a five-year reauthorization of all Department of
Agriculture programs before they expire Sept. 30.  The bill, which would end direct payments to growers as
part of the biggest change in U.S. farm-subsidy policy in
decades, is a target for budget cutters because of farm profits
and the highest-ever expenditures on  food stamps . Net  farm
income  this year will be $91.7 billion, the second-highest ever,
according to the USDA. Spending on the Supplemental Nutrition
Assistance Program, or food stamps, the department’s biggest
expense, reached a record $75.7 billion last year, double the
level of four years ago.  The bill is S. 3240.  To contact the reporters on this story:
