Kenya Airways Ltd. (KNAL) , sub-Saharan
 Africa ’s third-biggest airline, extended its decline after
saying full-year profit plunged on higher fuel costs, missing
analyst estimates.  The stock fell 0.4 percent to 13.95 shillings as of 11:30
a.m. after having remained unchanged in the two previous trading
sessions. In the five days prior to that, the shares retreated
7.3 percent.  Net income slumped 53 percent to 1.66 billion shillings
($19.5 million) in the 12 months through March from 3.54 billion
shillings a year earlier, Financial Director Alex Mbugua said at
a briefing today in Nairobi. The mean estimate of five analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg was for a fall to 1.94 billion shillings.
This is another challenging year, the  International Air
Transport Association , which represents 240 carriers, said on
its website, referring to 2012. “We expect revenues of $631
billion but a profit of just $3.0 billion. That’s a 0.5% net
margin.”  “The issue in our lives is fuel,” Mbugua said. “The
total fuel cost is now 40 billion shillings.”  Full-year revenue climbed 26 percent to 107.9 billion
shillings, while costs jumped 45 percent to 77.2 billion
shillings, Mbugua said.  “At least they have remained profitable and they have
alluded to major changes on procurement of oil which may have a
major positive impact,” Eric Musau, a research analyst at
Nairobi-based Standard Investment Bank Ltd., said in a phone
interview today.  KQ, as the airline is known, plans to raise $3.6 billion
over the next 10 years to fund an expansion that includes
expanding the fleet to 107 aircraft from 34 and more than
doubling its routes to 115 from 55, according to a company
statement March 12.  Stock Sale  “We have already started the negotiations on funding and
we should be able to conclude in the next month or two,” Chief
Executive Officer Titus Naikuni told reporters in Nairobi today.  The airline, based in Nairobi, said June 8 it received 14.5
billion shillings through a stock sale after having sought to
raise 20.7 billion shillings to fund its expansion.
 International Finance Corporation  spent 2 billion shillings to
acquire a 9.56 percent shareholding in the airline, Mbugua said
today.  KQ traded unchanged at 14 shillings by 10:42 a.m. in
Nairobi. The stock has fallen 29 percent this year, the worst-
performing company on the Nairobi Securities Exchange, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Kenya Airways ranks behind  South African Airways  and
Ethiopian Airlines Enterprise, which are sub-Saharan Africa’s
two biggest carriers, according to IATA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
