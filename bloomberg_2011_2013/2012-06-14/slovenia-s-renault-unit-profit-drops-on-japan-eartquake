Revoz d.d., the  Renault SA (RNO)  unit in
Slovenia, said profit last year dropped 25 percent due to a
shortage of parts as a consequence of the earthquake in  Japan  in
March 2011.  Net income fell to 13.9 million euros ($17.5 million) from
18.6 million euros the previous year, the Novo Mesto, Slovenia-
based company said in an e-mailed statement today. Revenue at
Slovenia’s second-biggest exporter after appliance maker Gorenje
Group d.d. dropped 15 percent to 1.13 billion euros in 2011.  The company’s supervisory board extended the mandate of the
three-member executive board, including its president Ales
Bratoz, until June 2016. The company said it will pay no
dividend from last year’s earnings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
