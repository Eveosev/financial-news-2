Italy  sold 4.5 billion euros ($5.6
billion) of debt, matching its maximum target for the auction,
as Spain’s request of external assistance for its banks
heightened pressure on Italy.  The Treasury sold 3 billion euros of its 3-year benchmark
bond to yield 5.3 percent, from the 3.91 percent at the last
auction on May 14 and the highest paid since December. Italy
also sold 627 million of a 4.25 percent 2019 bond at 6.1 percent
and 873 million euros of bonds due in 2020 at 6.13 percent.  After Spain requested 100 billion euros to recapitalize its
banks, becoming the fourth euro member to need a rescue since
the start of the region’s debt crisis, concerns have grown that
Italy may follow. The relief rally after the aid request was
short-lived, with  Spain ’s 10-yield reaching a euro-era record
6.974 percent today.  At the Italian sale, investors bid for 1.59 times the
amount of three-year bonds on offer, up from 1.52 times last
month.  The yield on Italy’s 10-year bond rose 7 basis points to
6.285 percent after the auction at 11:25 a.m. in  Rome , pushing
the difference with similar-maturity German debt to 478 basis
points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
