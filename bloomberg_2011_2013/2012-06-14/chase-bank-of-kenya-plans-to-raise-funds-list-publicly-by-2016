Chase Bank Kenya Ltd., a closely
held private lender, is seeking debt and equity investment for
expansion as it targets a  Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSEASI)  listing by
2016, Managing Director Zafrullah Khan said.  Chase is negotiating with development lenders to raise
additional capital, after getting the final portion of a $10
million loan in May from Deutsche Investitions und
Entwicklungsgesellschaft mbH, a unit of  Germany ’s state bank
KfW, Khan said yesterday in an interview in Nairobi.  “Our intention is to list, and our strategy says that
around 2015 or 2016 we will look at it very closely,” he said.  Kenyan bank  earnings  grew at a slower pace last year,
rising 21 percent to 89.5 billion shillings ($1.1 billion)
before taxes, compared with 52 percent  growth  in 2010, as
borrowing costs rose to a record, inflation soared and economic
growth slowed.  Chase Bank’s pretax income of 850 million shillings made it
the country’s 17th most profitable bank out of 42, according to
a report on the central bank’s website.  Chase plans to sell $24 million in shares to existing and
new shareholders through private placements this year, after
raising $11 million last year, Zafrullah said.  The lender is looking to support revenue growth by
increasing lending, deposit-holding and other services to small-
and mid-sized companies, expanding agency banking, and doubling
the number of branches to 45 over two years, he said.  The bank isn’t affiliated to U.S.-based lender JPMorgan
Chase & Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
