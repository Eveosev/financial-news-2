U.S. Gulf Coast oils weakened after
the premium for  Brent crude  over West Texas Intermediate
narrowed.  The gap between Brent and WTI, based on July futures
prices, narrowed $1.32 to $13.19 a barrel at 2:35 p.m. in  New
York . When Brent falls versus WTI, it typically decreases the
value of low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African
oil priced against the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium lost 35 cents to $11.80 a
barrel at 2:10 p.m. in New York, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet decreased 70 cents to $12 over
WTI. Poseidon’s premium to WTI sank 25 cents to $8 a barrel,
while Southern Green Canyon’s increased 40 cents to $7.50.  Mars Blend’s premium narrowed 20 cents to $9.10 a barrel.
 Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower sulfur content than Mars,
Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon, lost 30 cents to $10.90 a
barrel over WTI.  Western Canada Select’s discount to WTI narrowed $1.35 to
$22.25 a barrel. Syncrude’s discount narrowed $2.65 to $3.10.
Bakken oil’s discount narrowed 50 cents a barrel to $8.50.  To contact the reporter on this story:
