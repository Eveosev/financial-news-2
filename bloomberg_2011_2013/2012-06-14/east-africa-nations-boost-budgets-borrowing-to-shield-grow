Kenya , Uganda and Tanzania boosted
spending in their budgets for the next financial year as they
seek to shield their economies from Europe’s debt crisis, adding
to pressure on government debt and borrowing costs.  Kenyan Finance Minister Robinson Githae yesterday raised
spending by 25 percent in the year through June 2013 and
increased the target for the  budget deficit  to 6.5 percent of
gross domestic product from 4.3 percent previously. Uganda and
Tanzania plan to boost state expenditure by 12 percent each,
while Rwanda will lift its budget by 16 percent.  The four nations, members of the East African Community,
are investing in roads,  power plants  and railways to bolster
economic growth and offset the impact of a possible recession in
Europe, East Africa’s main trading partner. That may force
governments to increase bond sales and seek alternative funding
sources.  “By spending more, fiscal authorities are taking out
insurance, as they have concerns about the global slowdown,”
 Stuart Culverhouse , chief economist at investment bank Exotix
Ltd., said by phone from  London . “If there is an increased
supply of debt offerings, that will drive up yields and put
further pressure on their budgets to service that debt.”  The  East African Community  has a combined gross domestic
product of $79.2 billion and a population of 133.1 million
people. The five-nation group includes Burundi.  Unsustainable Deficit  Kenya’s budget will reach 1.5 trillion shillings ($17.7
billion) in 2012-2013 as the government prepared to hold
elections in March, pays for 10,000 more teachers and boosts
security. Borrowing on the domestic market will climb 72 percent
to 106.7 billion shillings next year, Githae said in a speech to
Parliament in the capital, Nairobi yesterday.  “At 6.5 percent of GDP, the deficit in Kenya is not
sustainable going forward and will clearly have to go down in
the coming years,” Phumelele Mbiyo, an analyst at  Standard Bank (SBK) 
Group Ltd. in Nairobi, said in a phone interview.  Kenya will raise 143.6 billion shillings from external
sources, Githae said. Revenue is forecast to increase 19
percent, helping to finance rising spending, he said.  The yield on Kenya’s 91-day Treasury bill rose for the
second consecutive sale yesterday, jumping to 10.537 percent
from 9.801 percent the previous week.  Uganda ’s three-month
borrowing costs increased to 18.546 percent yesterday from
17.978 percent at the previous auction. The yield on Tanzania’s
91-day Treasury bill was at 13.47 percent at the last auction on
June 6.  Slowing Growth  State revenue in Uganda is expected to climb to 11.2
trillion Ugandan shillings ($4.5 billion) in the year through
June 2013, with a quarter of that coming from donor aid, Finance
Minister Maria Kiwanuka told lawmakers yesterday in Kampala.  Uganda’s economy may struggle to recover after growth
slowed to a 25-year low of 3.2 percent this fiscal year,
President  Yoweri Museveni  said in Kampala yesterday. Uganda is
set to start pumping its first crude oil later this year.  Tanzania,  Africa ’s third-largest gold producer, will boost
domestic borrowing by a third to 1.6 trillion Tanzanian
shillings ($1 billion), Finance Minister William Mgimwa told
parliament in the capital, Dodoma.  Government spending  is
forecast to reach 15.1 trillion shillings in 2012-13.  Rwanda will increase spending to 1.4 trillion francs ($2.3
billion) in the year through June 2013 as it invests in
electricity, road and technology projects, according to the
 Finance Ministry . A slowdown in Europe will probably curb export
earnings, slowing economic growth to 7.7 percent this year from
8.6 percent in 2011.  Burundi announced its budget in December for the 2012
calendar year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
