CME Group Inc. (CME) ’s Black Sea wheat
contract is “more of a long-term bet” and will take time to
build liquidity, said Tim Andriesen, the managing director of
agricultural commodities and alternative investments.  “Black Sea wheat is going to be a long-term investment
from our standpoint in terms of getting a product that’s going
to ultimately be very valuable to market participants,”
Andriesen said today during a media roundtable with reporters in
Chicago. CME is the owner of the world’s largest futures
exchange and grain markets.  The Black Sea contract, which started trading on June 6,
reflects the price of grain from a part of the world where
production and exports are rising, he said. It will “take time
to get traction,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
