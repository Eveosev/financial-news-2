An unidentified man won  China ’s
biggest-ever lottery jackpot, worth 570 million  yuan  ($89
million), and has yet to come forward to claim the prize, the
country’s  lottery agency  said yesterday.  The man bought 110 tickets for the “Dual-Colored Ball”
game at a shop in Beijing’s Sanlitun neighborhood, according to
a statement on the website of the China Welfare Lottery Issuing
and Management Center. It cited a salesperson identified as Hou.  The winning numbers were drawn June 12 and the man has 60
days to claim the jackpot, the English-language  China Daily 
reported today. The newspaper said the lottery was begun in the
1980’s to raise money for public welfare projects.  The previous record for the Chinese lottery was set last
July, when a 565 million yuan jackpot was awarded to a “Dual-
Colored Ball” player in Zhejiang province, according to the
website.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
