PBG SA (PBG) , Poland’s third-largest
construction company, extended its gains after a Polish court
gave it the go-ahead for bankruptcy yesterday, which included an
arrangement with creditors.  The shares jumped as much as 6.2 percent, and traded 4.9
percent stronger to 7.25 zloty as of 12:17 a.m. local time,
rising for the fourth day. The builder has slumped 90 percent
 this year , underperforming the WIG20 Index, which rose 2.8
percent.  A Poznan, western Poland-based court agreed to declare
bankruptcy of PBG which will include an arrangement with its
creditors, a spokeswoman for the court, Joanna Ciesielska-
Borowiec, said by phone yesterday. The company filed for
bankruptcy after talks with banks remained at an “impasse,”
preventing the company from the fulfilling its contracts, the
company said in a statement on June 4.  “PBG now has a few extra months left to obtain new
financing ,‘‘ Piotr Nawrocki, a Warsaw-based analyst at Wood &
Co. Financial Services AS wrote in a research note to clients
today. ‘‘However, the company’s main problems, in the long run,
are not going to be solved by the court’s decision as it still
cannot finance its working capital to finish its current
projects.’’  The builder, which specialized in oil and gas engineering,
ventured out of its core business to bid on arena and highway
construction deals after Poland was selected to co-host the Euro
2012 soccer championship, only to see its debt swell on falling
margins.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
