Commerzbank AG (CBK) ,  Germany ’s second-
largest lender, agreed to improve its anti-money laundering
program after Federal Reserve examiners determined the bank
failed to establish internal controls in its New York branch.  Commerzbank will submit a plan to the Fed within 60 days
detailing how it will revise its program for monitoring bulk
cash transactions and improve due diligence on customers,
according to an enforcement action the regulator released today.  The bank will also hire a consultant to perform a review of
transactions going back to September 2010 and report any
suspicious activity. The German lender will review currency
transactions in that period to ensure proper reports were filed
with regulators.  “Commerzbank has committed to take all necessary measures
to comply with the additional compliance and reporting
requirements agreed with U.S. regulators,” Margarita Thiel, a
spokeswoman for the Frankfurt-based bank, said in an e-mailed
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
