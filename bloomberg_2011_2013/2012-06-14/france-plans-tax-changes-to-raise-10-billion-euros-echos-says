The French government plans to
propose revisions in tax laws to raise an additional 10 billion
euros ($12.6 billion) in revenue to reduce the countryâ€™s budget
deficit,  Les Echos  reported.  Changes to the law will include higher inheritance taxes,
an end to exemptions for payroll taxes on overtime the
reestablishment of the wealth tax schedule and measures to
reduce tax loopholes used by large companies, the newspaper
said, without saying where it got the information.  A proposed adjustment in capital taxes to the same level as
salaries is planned for the fall, Figaro said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
