Tropical Storm Carlotta formed early
today off  Mexico â€™s southwest coast and may grow into a hurricane
within a day, the National Hurricane Center said in a 2 a.m.
Pacific time advisory. The storm is about 430 miles (695
kilometers) south-southeast of the Mexican beach resort of
Puerto Angel, moving northwest at 10 miles per hour.  A  hurricane watch  is in effect for Barra de Tonala to Punta
Maldonado, meaning hurricane conditions are possible in that
area, the Miami-based center said. The forecast track for the
storm, now bearing 40 mph winds, shows a potential landfall late
tomorrow and skirting along the Pacific Coast with tropical-
storm force winds and heavy rain over the weekend.  To contact the reporter on this story:
