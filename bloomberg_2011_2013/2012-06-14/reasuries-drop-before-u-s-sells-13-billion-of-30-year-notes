Treasury 30-year notes declined as
the U.S. prepared to auction $13 billion of the securities today
following sales of three- and 10-year debt earlier this week.  Losses in U.S. government securities were limited before
data forecast to show U.S. consumer prices fell, providing the
 Federal Reserve  room to take further steps to spur the economy.
The  gap  in yields between 10-year notes and Treasury Inflation
Protected Securities, which represents traders’ expectations for
inflation over the life of the debt, was 2.1 percentage points,
down from 2012 high of 2.45 percentage points in March.  “Investors may be taking a little breather from buying
Treasuries,” said  Masaru Hamasaki , chief strategist in Tokyo at
Toyota Asset Management Co., which oversees the equivalent of
$24 billion. “The flight-to-quality amid concern over the
 European debt crisis  and U.S. slowdown has already sent bond
prices to an expensive level.”  The  30-year yield  rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 2.73 percent at 6:33 a.m. in  London , according to
Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 3 percent bond due May 2042
fell 3/8, or $3.75 per $1,000 face amount, to 105 18/32.
Benchmark  10-year yields  gained two basis points to 1.61 percent
after dropping to a record 1.4387 percent on June 1.  Japan ’s  10-year rate  added one basis point to 0.865
percent.  The 30-year Treasuries on offer today yielded 2.735 percent
in pre-auction trading, compared with 3.09 percent at the
previous offering on May 10. Investors  bid  for 2.73 times the
amount for sale last month, versus an average of 2.67 for the
previous 10 auctions.  Treasury Auctions  At a $21 billion auction of 10-year securities yesterday,
the so-called  bid-to-cover  ratio was 3.06, versus 2.9 percent at
the May offering and an average of 3.08 at the past 10 sales.  Indirect bidders , an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 42 percent of the securities at the
offering, the most since December. That compared with an average
of 41.5 percent for the past 10 sales of 10-year notes.  Direct bidders, non-primary dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 20.8 percent,
compared with an average of 14.7 percent at the past 10 sales.
Their share yesterday was the highest since August.  U.S. government securities gained 3.2 percent this quarter
through yesterday, Bank of America Merrill Lynch data showed.
The  MSCI All Country World Index (MXWD)  of equities handed investors an
8.8 percent loss including reinvested dividends over the same
period, as concern that the European debt crisis is spreading to
the region’s larger economies from  Greece  prompted investors to
seek safer assets.  Debt Crisis  Greeks will vote again this weekend after a May election
failed to produce a coalition government. Moody’s Investors
Service cut  Spain ’s credit rating by three steps to Baa3
yesterday, citing the nation’s increased debt burden, weakening
economy and limited access to  capital markets .  “The relentless purchasing of Treasuries astounds me,”
said Paul Montaquila, head of fixed-income trading at Bank of
The West in  San Ramon ,  California . “The uncertainty in Europe
is an ever-lingering backdrop.”  The U.S. consumer-price index probably fell 0.2 percent in
May, after no change in April according to the median estimate
of economists in a Bloomberg News survey before the Labor
Department releases the figures today. That would be the biggest
decline since December 2008.  Retail Sales  A report yesterday showed  retail sales  in the world’s
largest economy decreased for a second month in May. The
smallest wage gains in a year and unemployment exceeding 8
percent are taking a toll on the  consumer spending  that accounts
for about 70 percent of the economy, leaving it more vulnerable
to shocks from the European crisis.  “The situation in  Europe  poses significant risks to the
U.S. financial system and economy and must be monitored
closely,” Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told lawmakers on June
7. “As always, the Federal Reserve remains prepared to take
action as needed to protect the U.S. financial system and
economy in the event that financial stresses escalate.”  The Fed, which meets June 19-20, bought $2.3 trillion of
bonds in two rounds of so-called quantitative easing, or QE,
from December 2008 to June 2011, seeking to cap borrowing costs
and stimulate the economy.  The central bank plans to buy as much as $2.25 billion of
Treasuries due from February 2036 to May 2042 today under its
program known as Operation Twist, which aims to replace holdings
of shorter-term securities with longer-term bonds, according to
the Fed Bank of  New York ’s  website .  Cooling Inflation  “Falling inflation coupled with the weaker retail sales
data, at the margin, may bolster the argument for a change in
monetary policy toward further quantitative easing at the
upcoming” Federal Open Market Committee meeting, Ellen Zentner,
a senior economist at Nomura Holdings Inc. in New York, wrote in
a note to clients yesterday.  A  measure  of price-increase predictions used by the Fed to
set policy, the five-year, five-year forward break-even rate,
which gauges the average inflation rate between 2017 and 2022,
was 2.52 percent on June 11, down from a 2012 high of 2.78
percent on March 19 and a five-year average of 2.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
