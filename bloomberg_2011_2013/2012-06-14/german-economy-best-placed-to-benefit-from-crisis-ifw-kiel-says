Germany  is better placed than most
of its euro-area partners to exploit the debt crisis to bolster
its economy, the IfW-Kiel economic institute said in its latest
outlook report.  Low interest rates and price pressures, the relative
weakness of the euro and the country’s “safe haven” status for
investors are helping it weather the crisis better than its
European partners, the IfW said today in an e-mailed report. The
institute raised the growth outlook for  Europe ’s biggest economy
this year to 0.9 percent from 0.7 percent forecast in March.  By keeping its benchmark  interest rate  at 1 percent, the
 European Central Bank  handed German banks and companies a crisis
tool that is “extremely beneficial,” said the IfW.  German
 government bonds  are in demand and foreign investors are showing
heightened interest in taking company stakes, it said.  At the same time, Germany can draw little succor from the
crisis that is steadily eroding its economic outlook, said IfW.
“The headwind from abroad is so strong at the moment that a
major reversal or at least a significant setback for the German
economy has become more probable,” said the IfW economists.  The IfW is a contributor to a group of institutes that
Chancellor Angela Merkel consults for independent forecasts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
