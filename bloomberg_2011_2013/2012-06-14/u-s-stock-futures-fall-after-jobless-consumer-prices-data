U.S. stock futures retreated,
signaling the market may drop for a second day, after government
reports showed jobless claims increased and consumer prices fell
more than forecast.  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures expiring in September
lost 0.2 percent to 1,305.7 at 8:33 a.m. in  New York .  Claims for jobless benefits unexpectedly climbed by 6,000
to 386,000 in the week ended June 9 from a revised 380,000 the
prior week that was more than first estimated, Labor Department
figures showed today in Washington. Economists projected claims
would fall to 375,000, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey.  The consumer-price index declined 0.3 percent, more than
forecast and the biggest drop since December 2008, after no
change the prior month, the Labor Department reported today in
Washington. Economists projected a 0.2 percent decrease,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. The
so-called core measure, which excludes more volatile food and
energy costs, increased 0.2 percent for a third month.  The  S&P 500 Index  fell yesterday following a decrease in
U.S. retail sales and higher borrowing costs at elections ini
Italy and Germany.  Investors were also waiting an election in  Greece  this
weekend that may indicate whether the nation will remain in the
 euro zone .  The  S&P 500  tumbled as much a 9.9 percent from a four-year
high in April through June 1 amid lower-than-forecast economic
data and concern Europe’s debt crisis was spreading. The index
has rebounded 2.9 percent since.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
