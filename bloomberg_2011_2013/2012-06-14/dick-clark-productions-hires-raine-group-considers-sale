Dick Clark Productions Inc., owned
by RedZone Capital Group LP and Six Flags Entertainment Corp.,
said Raine Group LLC has been hired to advise the company on a
possible sale.  The producer of the Golden Globes and the Academy of
Country Music Awards has regularly received expressions of
interest in acquiring the company over the past several years,
Los Angeles-based Dick Clark Productions said today in an e-
mailed statement.  “We’ve recently hired Raine to help us think through our
options and to organize any conversations with any interested
parties,” the company said. “At this point, no decision has
been made to enter into a transaction of any kind and it’s not
clear whether any transaction will happen at all.”  Dick Clark Productions decided to pursue a sale after
receiving interest from a Chinese media company, the  New York 
Times reported earlier today. RedZone is an investment fund of
Washington Redskins owner Daniel Snyder.  To contact the reporter on this story:
