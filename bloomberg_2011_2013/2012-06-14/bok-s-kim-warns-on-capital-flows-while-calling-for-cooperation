Bank of Korea Governor Kim Choong Soo called for global cooperation on reducing risks posed by
central-bank easing and urged emerging countries to prepare for
volatile capital flows.  “Coordinated global efforts to rein in the excessive
global liquidity and cross-border spillovers have fallen short
of expectations,” Kim said according to prepared remarks for a
speech in  Seoul  today. “A global solution is needed more than
ever to overcome the current crisis, which is a global
problem.”  Kim’s comments follow an International Monetary Fund report
on June 12 that urged  South Korea  to enhance contingency
planning, citing its exposure to foreign money flows. Kim said
today that his country’s measures such as implementing
adjustable caps on banks’ foreign currency derivative positions
could be a model for other countries.  U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  on June 7
said that policy makers will discuss whether to boost measures
to support growth even as he foresees “diminishing returns,”
should they pursue further easing.  South Korea has deployed a number of steps since 2010 to
smooth hot money flows that often cause sharp swings in the won.
The  Finance Ministry  capped banks’ currency forward positions
and imposed a levy on non-deposit foreign-currency liabilities
held by domestic and foreign banks. It also revived a tax of as
much as 14 percent on interest income from treasury bonds held
by foreigners, as well as a 20 percent levy on  capital gains 
from their sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
