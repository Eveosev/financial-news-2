Braskem SA (BRKM5) , Latin America’s largest
petrochemicals maker, is interested in constructing an ethylene
and polyethylene plant in Bolivia, according to state-oil
producer Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales Bolivianos.  “We understand YPFB has a project to develop ethylene and
polyethylene, which interests us,” Braskem Project Director
Javier Quipusco Escobedo said in a YPFB statement today.  YPFB said it wants to form a partnership with a foreign
company to finance the planned petrochemical complex, which will
produce 600,000 metric tons of polyethylene annually. Nine
companies including KBR Inc. of the U.S., Germany’s  Linde AG (LIN)  and
Italy’s  Saipem SpA (SPM)  must submit engineering proposals by July 23
for the plant called Gran Chaco, YPFB said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
