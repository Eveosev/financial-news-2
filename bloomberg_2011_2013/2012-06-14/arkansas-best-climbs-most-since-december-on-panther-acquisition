Arkansas Best Corp. (ABFS) , a trucking
company, rose the most in almost six months after saying it will
purchase Panther Expedited Services Inc. to expand its logistics
and high-speed delivery businesses.  Arkansas Best climbed 6 percent to $11.62 at the close in
New York, the biggest gain since Dec. 20. The  Fort Smith ,
Arkansas-based company will acquire Panther from Fenway Partners
LLC, a private-equity firm, for a transaction valued at about
$180 million, it said in a statement today.  Arkansas Best, which hauls goods from more than one
customer in each trailer, is looking to expand its business by
offering additional shipment arrangements, Chief Executive
Officer Judy McReynolds said today in a conference call. The
company will fund the acquisition with $80 million in cash and a
$100 million senior secured-term loan, she said.  Arkansas Best needs to offer customers “a full suite of
end-to-end logistics solutions,” McReynolds said. “If we have
more services to offer them, they will continue to use us in
more ways.”  Panther reported about $215 million in unaudited revenue
and $24 million of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization in 2011. The deal will be
accretive to Arkansas Best’s earnings per share beginning in the
third quarter, according to the statement.  The acquisition is scheduled to close on or about June 15,
subject to conditions, Arkansas Best said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
