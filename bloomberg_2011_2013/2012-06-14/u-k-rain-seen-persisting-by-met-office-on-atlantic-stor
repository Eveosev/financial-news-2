The U.K. may have heavy rains and
strong winds starting tonight as an “unseasonable” Atlantic
storm extends the wetter-than-normal pattern parts of the
country have experienced this month, the  Met Office  said.  Widespread rains of as much as 40 millimeters (1.6 inches)
may fall tonight, while upland parts of Wales and  Northern
Ireland  may receive as much as 60 millimeters, the U.K.’s
weather forecaster said today in a  statement  on its website.
Wind gusts may reach 50 miles an hour, the Met Office said.  Rains may persist tomorrow in areas of northern  England  and
southern Scotland, with a risk of spreading into southeastern
England later in the day, according to the report. The forecast
for June 16 “looks rather unsettled, with most places seeing
showers or longer spells of rain,” the Met Office said.  Parts of southeastern England have received as much  rain 
this week as they normally would have in the entire month of
June, the Met Office said June 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
