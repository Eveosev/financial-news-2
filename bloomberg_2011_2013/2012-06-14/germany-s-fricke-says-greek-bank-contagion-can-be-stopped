German Free Democratic Party
lawmaker Otto Fricke said it’s possible to stop financial-
industry contagion from an eventual Greek euro exit, though he
doesn’t want  Greece  to leave the single currency.  “It’s a Greek decision,” Fricke, the FDP’s budget
spokesman in parliament, said today in a Bloomberg Television
interview in Berlin. “If the voters, and they’re the boss in
that game, if they decide that they want to have a parliament
that is not willing to fulfill the austerity measures, it’s
their choice.”  Asked how much more money  Germany  would willing to give to
help Greece, Fricke said: “at some point there is an end.”
Financing a country that doesn’t change its structures isn’t the
solution, he said.  While contagion is the biggest concern related to a
possible Greek euro exit, Fricke said he doesn’t expect
“panic” or a “bank run.”  Rifts in the 17-nation euro region are deepening with Greek
elections on June 17 risking the first exit from the single
currency as voters buckle under the continent’s most severe
austerity program. Spanish bond yields reached a euro-era record
after the nation’s request for aid for its banks fueled
speculation the world’s 12th-biggest economy may need a full
rescue.  To contact the reporters on this story:
