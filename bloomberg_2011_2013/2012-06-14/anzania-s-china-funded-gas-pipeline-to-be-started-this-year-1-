Tanzania  will borrow the money it
needs so that it can start construction in the next year on a
natural gas pipeline, for which China has already offered a $1.2
billion loan, Finance Minister William Mgimwa said.  Tanzania will use part of 1.2 trillion shillings ($757.1
million) in non-concessional loans it expects to take in 2012-13
to pay its portion of the construction cost, Mgimwa said in his
annual budget presentation today in parliament in Dodoma, the
capital. He didn’t give further details.  “The government will implement the gas pipeline
construction project from Mtwara to Dar es Salaam,” he said,
referring to the southern coastal town where the facility will
start and its terminus in Tanzania’s commercial capital.  Statoil ASA (STL) , Norway’s biggest energy company, today said it
found an estimated 3 trillion cubic feet of gas off Tanzania’s
Indian Ocean coast. Some of the world’s largest explorers have
been lured to  East Africa , where companies including  BG Group (BG/) 
and  Eni SpA (ENI)  have found more than 100 trillion cubic feet of gas.  The  Export-Import Bank of China  last year agreed to finance
most of the construction, according to Tanzania’s government.
The loan is being given at a non-concessional rate, Mgimwa said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
