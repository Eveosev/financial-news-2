Ar Tarim Organik Gida AS (ARTOG) , an organic
agriculture company, rose for a third day after saying any
potential income from a new oil exploration unit would belong to
the listed company.  The stock jumped 10 percent to 5.41 liras at 11:40 a.m. in
Istanbul.  Ar Tarim announced after the market closed on June 12 that
it was setting up a new unit to explore oil in southeastern
 Turkey , sending its shares soaring 16 percent yesterday.  The new unit will not be funded by the proceeds of the
companyâ€™s May 31 initial public offering and any income from the
unit will belong to the parent, Ar Tarim said in a statement to
the exchange today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
