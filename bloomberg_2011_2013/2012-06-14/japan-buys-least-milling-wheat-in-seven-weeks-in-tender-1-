Japan  bought 147,118 metric tons of
milling wheat from the U.S. and  Australia  in a regular tender
today, said the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries.  It was the smallest purchase since April 26, when the
government bought 106,200 tons, according to Toshiki Toji at the
ministry’s grain-trade division. The ministry, which controls
overseas purchases and domestic sales of wheat to stabilize
supply, has bought 1.18 million tons through regular tenders
this fiscal year, compared with 4.65 million tons in the year
ended March 31. Details of this week’s tender are listed below:  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
