Ivory Coast  is seeking 46 billion
CFA francs ($88 million) to stop the spread of swollen-shoot
disease on cocoa farms, according to a government statement
published in Fraternite Matin.  A preliminary survey shows the disease has affected 12
percent of cocoa farms across Ivory Coast, the worldâ€™s biggest
grower of the crop, according to the statement in the state-
owned newspaper, which was signed by government spokesman Bruno Kone.
