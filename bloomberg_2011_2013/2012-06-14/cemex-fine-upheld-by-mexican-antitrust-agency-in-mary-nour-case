Cemex SAB (CEMEXCPO) , the largest cement maker
in the Americas, said Mexico’s antitrust agency upheld a fine of
10.2 million pesos ($729,000) against the company for blocking a
2004 cement shipment from Russia.  Cemex sees the fine as unfounded and will seek an
injunction against it, said  Jorge Perez , a company spokesman.
The Monterrey, Mexico-based company appealed the fine, which the
nation’s Federal Competition Commission imposed in February.  The blocked delivery occurred when a group of competitors
tried to import 26,000 metric tons of cement on the ship Mary
Nour. The vessel was held in port for months and later turned
away. Ricardo Alessio Robles, one of the people who tried to
import the cement, wasn’t immediately available for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
