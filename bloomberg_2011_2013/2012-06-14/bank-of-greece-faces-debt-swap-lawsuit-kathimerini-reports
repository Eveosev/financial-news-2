Two Greek industry bodies took legal
action against the  Bank of Greece  on the ground that it
mismanaged their financial assets,  Kathimerini  reported, without
saying how it got the information.  The Athens Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Athens
Chamber of Tradesmen said they weren’t consulted on the central
bank’s decision to invest part of their cash reserves in Greek
 government bonds , which were subsequently tendered into the
country’s sovereign debt swap, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
