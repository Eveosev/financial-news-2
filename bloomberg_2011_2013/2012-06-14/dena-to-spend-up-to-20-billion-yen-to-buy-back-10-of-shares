DeNA Co. (2432) ,  Japan ’s biggest social-
gaming operator, rose the most in more than two years in Tokyo
trading after saying it will spend as much as 20 billion yen
($254 million) buying back up to 10 percent of its stock.  DeNA gained 12 percent, the most since February 2010, to
1,993 yen on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The company plans to make
the purchase between today and July 31 as part of measures to
reward shareholders, Tokyo-based DeNA said in a statement after
the market closed yesterday.  The operator of the Mobage gaming site had fallen 23
percent in Tokyo trading this year through yesterday and joins
Japanese companies including  Canon Inc. (7751)  and  Sega Sammy Holdings
Inc. (6460)  in buying back shares. DeNA’s stock had dropped as
government scrutiny led the company and domestic rivals to
abandon a sales method said by regulators to cause excessive
charges for users.  “The size of buyback is a positive surprise,”  Mitsuo Shimizu , an analyst at Iwai Cosmo Securities Co. in Tokyo, said
by phone. “The stock may perform well for a while on this.”  Gree Inc. (3632) , DeNA’s closest domestic rival, and other social-
game providers also gained on hopes they may follow DeNA in
buying back shares, Shimizu said.  Gree jumped 8.4 percent to 1,710 yen.  CyberAgent Inc. (4751) ,
operator of the  Ameba  site, rose 5.8 percent and Square Enix
Holdings Co. gained 2.1 percent.  Canon, the world’s largest camera maker, said June 4 it
plans to spend as much as 50 billion yen on a buyback. Sega
Sammy, a Japanese pachinko and video-game software maker, said
May 31 it plans to spend 17 billion yen on stock repurchases.  DeNA also released its earnings forecast. Net income may be
9.05 billion yen in the three months ending June 30, it said in
a separate statement yesterday. The forecast compares with the
9.35 billion-yen average of three analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  DeNA provided the forecast under international accounting
standards. The company had net income of 9.5 billion yen a year
earlier under the Japanese standard.  To contact the reporter on this story:
