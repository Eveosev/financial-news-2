Taiwan’s dollar advanced amid
speculation exporters are repatriating income before this
weekend’s Greek elections, which may lead to a breakup of the
euro.  Government bonds  declined.  Greece  will vote June 17 on whether to back the Syriza
party, led by Alexis Tsipras, who wants to renegotiate the terms
of a European Union-led bailout. Taiwan’s dollar slumped 1.5
percent in the past month as Europe’s debt crisis worsened and
signs of cooling demand in  China  and the U.S. dimmed the outlook
for the island’s overseas sales. Data on June 20 may show export
orders fell for a third month in May, according to the median
estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey.  “Exporters are selling the greenback before the Greek vote
this weekend that may have a huge effect on the currency,” said
Tarsicio Tong, a foreign-exchange trader at  Union Bank of Taiwan (2838) 
in Taipei. “Also, it looks like there’s resistance at NT$30. It
would be difficult for it to weaken beyond that level.”  Taiwan’s dollar strengthened 0.1 percent to NT$29.954
against its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It
touched NT$30.070 on June 5, the weakest level since Jan. 17.
One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings
used to price options, was little changed at 5.5 percent.  The yield on the 1.25 percent notes due March 2022 rose to
1.193 percent from 1.186 percent yesterday, according to Gretai
Securities Market.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  was little changed at
0.51 percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the
 Taiwan  Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
