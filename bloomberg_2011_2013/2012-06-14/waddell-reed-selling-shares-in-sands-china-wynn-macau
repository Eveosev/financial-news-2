Waddell & Reed Financial Inc. (WDR) , a
U.S. mutual fund company, is selling shares in two Macau, China-
based casinos,  Sands China Ltd. (1928)  and  Wynn Macau Ltd. (1128) , raising
about $250 million, according to terms obtained by Bloomberg
News.  A total of 41 million shares in Sands China are being
offered for HK$24.18 to HK$24.68 each, representing a discount
of as much as 5 percent to today’s closing price, the terms
show. Waddell & Reed is also offering 55.5 million Wynn Macau
shares for HK$17.53 to HK$17.90 apiece.  UBS AG (UBSN)  is managing both
processes, according to the terms.  Waddell & Reed is selling stock in the casino operators as
revenue growth slows and the companies expand in Macau, a former
Portuguese colony and the only city in China with legalized
casino betting. Macau has become a global gambling hub, with $34
billion in gaming revenue last year.  Macau’s casino revenue grew 7.3 percent in May from the
same period a year earlier, the slowest rate since the collapse
of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008. That compares with
growth of 22 percent for April and 24 percent for March.  Wynn Macau , the Asian unit of Steve Wynn’s Las Vegas
company, plans to invest $4 billion in a new resort in the
Chinese city. Sheldon Adelson, chairman of  Las Vegas Sands
Corp. (LVS) , which controls Sands China, opened the $5 billion Sands
Cotai Central in April.  Shares of Hong Kong-listed Wynn Macau have fallen 5 percent
this year, while Sands China shares have risen 16 percent.  Waddell & Reed bought a stake in Formula One from CVC
Capital Partners Ltd. for $1.1 billion this year, a person with
knowledge of the matter said in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
