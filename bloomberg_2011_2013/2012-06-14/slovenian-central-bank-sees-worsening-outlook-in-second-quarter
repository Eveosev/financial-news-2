Slovenia’s  economy  will probably
shrink in the second quarter as confidence drops and austerity
measures cut demand, the country’s central bank said.  “The outlook for the second quarter is unfavorable for the
moment as confidence indicators remain low, uncertainties in the
international environment have increased and fiscal austerity
measures will have an impact on consumption as early as June,”
Ljubljana-based Banka Slovenije said in a report today.  Gross domestic product rose 0.2 percent in the first
quarter from the previous three months as household and
government consumption offset slowing exports and a decline in
investment. GDP shrank 0.2 percent in the period compared with a
year earlier.  The country’s banks are relying on financing from the
 European Central Bank  as record losses and uncertainty in the
European banking industry limits access to wholesale funding.  Lending to the economy stagnated and the Slovenian banking
industry’s assets rose 1.4 billion euros ($1.76 billion) in
March after lenders took out 2 billion euros of loans from the
ECB, the report said. Banks, including Nova Ljubljanska Banka
d.d. and  Nova Kreditna Banka Maribor d.d.  used the loans to
repay maturing debt.  The banking industry reported a loss of 19.7 million  euros
in the first quarter on high impairment and provisioning
charges, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
