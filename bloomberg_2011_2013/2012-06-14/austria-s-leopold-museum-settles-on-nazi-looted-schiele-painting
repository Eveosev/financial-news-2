Vienna’s Leopold Museum agreed to
settle with the remaining claimants of Jenny Steiner to keep in
its collection Egon Schiele’s “Houses by the Sea,” that was
stolen by the Nazis.  The 1914 painting belonged to Steiner until she fled
 Austria  in 1938, shortly after the Nazis marched into Vienna.
She escaped to Paris and later emigrated to the U.S. with her
two daughters. The painting was seized and sold by the Nazis,
then later auctioned. Rudolf Leopold, the founder of the Leopold
Museum, acquired it in 1955.  After a $5 million settlement with Steiner’s granddaughter
last year, the museum settled with the claimants for the
remaining two-thirds of the painting, Leopold Museum said in a
statement today.  The Leopold Foundation will finance the settlement by
selling paintings, Peter Weinhaeupl, the managing director of
the museum, told Austria Press Agency.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
