CNO Financial Group Inc. (CNO) , the
insurer that counts John Paulson’s hedge fund as its biggest
investor, rose the most this year after the company’s chief
executive officer said repurchases are attractive.  CNO jumped 6 percent to close at $7.20 in New York, the
biggest gain since Dec. 20. The Carmel, Indiana-based insurer
advanced 1.6 percent yesterday after analysts at  Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS)  added the company to its “conviction buy” list on
the prospect of more stock buybacks.  CEO Edward Bonach said yesterday after the market closed
that repurchases are a priority for the company, based on the
share price. The insurer trades for less than half its book
value, a measure of assets minus liabilities.  “We think it’s a screaming buy from the standpoint of our
capital deployment,” Bonach said at an investor conference in
 New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
