The  European Central Bank  said
downside risks to the economic outlook have increased.  “Economic growth in the euro area remains weak, with
heightened uncertainty weighing on confidence and sentiment,
giving rise to increased downside risks to the economic
outlook,” the Frankfurt-based ECB said in its monthly bulletin
today, echoing President  Mario Draghi ’s June 6 policy statement.
“The Governing Council will monitor further developments
closely and ensure medium-term  price stability  for the euro area
by acting in a firm and timely manner.”  While the ECB last week held its  benchmark interest rate  at
1 percent, Draghi said “a few” policy makers called for a cut,
fueling speculation the bank could act as soon as next month as
the sovereign debt crisis curbs growth and damps price
pressures.  Greece  holds elections on June 17 that may hand power
to parties opposed to the country’s bailout conditions and
trigger its exit from the monetary union.  At the same time, euro-area inflation remains above the
ECB’s 2 percent limit.  “While inflation rates are likely to stay above 2 percent
for the remainder of 2012, over the policy-relevant horizon the
Governing Council expects price developments to remain in line
with price stability,” the ECB said in today’s bulletin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
