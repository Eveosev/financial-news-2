World Bank  President  Robert Zoellick 
said his institution has tried to keep some distance from
Greece, which is receiving a bailout from countries in the euro
region and the  International Monetary Fund .  Zoellick, whose five-year mandate at the head of the bank
ends at the end of the month, said he is more focused on any
aftershocks of the European debt crisis for southeastern Europe,
the Balkans as well as North and West Africa.  “These are the political judgments that you make” when
you have limited resources, Zoellick said at an event in
Washington today where he was asked about potential involvement
of the bank to help Greece make in-depth changes to its economy.
He said his concern was, “given the political tensions, that it
might not be as productive for  Greece  as it would be harmful to
the bank.”  Greece, which has struggled to meet targets for narrowing
its  budget deficit  while receiving aid pledges of 240 billion
euros ($302 billion) over the past two years, is having
elections on June 17 for the second time in six weeks, after a
May 6 ballot failed to result in a government.  Mexico’s Central Bank Governor Agustin Carstens in April
said he was  “surprised” the World Bank hasn’t sent a mission
to Greece to help the government design policies to strengthen
competitiveness and privatize services that are a drain on
public finances.  Asked about the European debt crisis that has engulfed four
countries in the monetary union, Zoellick said he still sees a
set of potential solutions.  “It requires taking steps that don’t just give money away
but that would show countries such as Spain and  Italy  that if
they undertake these serious reforms, they will be backed and
supported,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
