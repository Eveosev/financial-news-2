OAO Gazprom,  Russia ’s natural-gas
export monopoly, has begun to fill the first link in a pipeline
connecting the Yamal Peninsula in Arctic Siberia to the
company’s transportation network near a hub at Ukhta.  The pipeline will be ready for use “in the near future”
as it is being filled with gas from both the Bovanenkovo deposit
in the north and from fields in the south, the Moscow-based
company said in an e-mailed statement today, citing Deputy Chief
Executive Officer Vitaly Markelov.  To contact the reporter on this story:
