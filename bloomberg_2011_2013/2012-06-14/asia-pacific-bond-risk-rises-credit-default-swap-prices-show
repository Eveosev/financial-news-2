The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from non-payment increased,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan gained 1 basis point to 190 basis points
as of 8:37 a.m. in  Hong Kong ,  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  prices show.
The gauge is poised for the first daily increase since June 8,
according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index advanced 1.5 basis points
to 194 as of 10:09 a.m. in Sydney,  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  prices
show. The benchmark is down about 17 basis points from a six-
month high of 211 reached on June 4, according to CMA, which is
owned by CME Group Inc. and compiled prices quoted by dealers in
the privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index rose 1 basis point to 181 as
of 9:16 a.m. in Tokyo, Deutsche Bank AG prices show. The index
has traded between 181 and 204 basis points this month, CMA
prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
