European stocks  dropped for a second
day as Moody’s Investors Service downgraded Spain and Cyprus,
while Switzerland’s central bank said that  Credit Suisse Group
AG (CSGN)  must increase its capital this year.  Credit Suisse slumped 10 percent to its lowest price since
1992.  British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc (BSY)  and  BT Group Plc (BT/A) 
tumbled 3.5 percent each, after winning the rights to show live
English Premier League soccer matches by paying an extra 70
percent.  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  plunged 18 percent after reducing its outlook
for the second quarter.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  dropped 0.3 percent to 241.84 at
the close of trading, extending its  slide from this year’s high
on March 16 to 11 percent .  “The big news obviously is Spain is ticking up, so the
question is how long can they sustain this before having to go
back for more funds,” said Chris Beauchamp, a market analyst at
IG Index in  London . “It’s the rising yields and then you factor
in the Italian yields and then obviously you have the Greek
elections so you’ve got a perfect storm brewing.”  The VStoxx Index, a measure of Euro Stoxx 50 Index options
prices, slipped 2.5 percent to 33.01, snapping three days of
gains. The volume of shares trading on the Stoxx 600 today was
18 percent higher than the average of the last 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  National benchmark indexes gained in 10 of the 18 western-
European markets today. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 0.3 percent
and Germany’s DAX slipped 0.2 percent. France’s benchmark CAC 40
added 0.1 percent.  Greece ’s ASE Index rallied 10 percent for its
biggest climb since August.  Spain’s Credit Rating  Moody’s cut  Spain ’s rating by three steps to Baa3 from A3
late yesterday, citing the nation’s increased debt burden,
weakening economy and limited access to  capital markets . Moody’s
also lowered Cyprus’s bond rating to Ba3 from Ba1, attributing
the downgrade to the increased likelihood of Greece leaving the
euro area. The country’s government may have to give more
support to Cypriot banks as a consequence.  The yield on  Spain’s 10-year debt  rallied as high as 6.998
percent today, the highest since before the Mediterranean nation
started using the euro in 1999.  Italy sold 4.5 billion euros ($5.7 billion) of debt,
matching its maximum target, at an auction. The country’s
Treasury sold 3 billion euros of its three-year benchmark bond
to yield 5.3 percent. That compared with a yield of 3.91 percent
when it last sold the securities on May 14.  Credit Suisse reduced its estimate for  China’s growth  to
7.7 percent from 8 percent, while Deutsche Bank AG lowered its
forecast to 7.9 percent from 8.2 percent, according to research
notes. The predictions indicate that  China’s economy  will expand
at the slowest pace since 1999.  Credit Suisse Plunges  Credit Suisse tumbled 10 percent to 17.01 Swiss francs, its
biggest decline since 2008, as the  Swiss National Bank  said it
needed a “marked increase” in capital this year to prepare for
risks from a possible escalation of the euro area’s sovereign-
debt crisis.  BSkyB sank 3.5 percent to 671 pence, the biggest plunge
since November, after its pay-TV Sky channel increased its
spending to retain the rights to show most Premier League games.
Sky will show 116 matches out of 154 available from the 2013-14
season. The company will pay 760 million pounds ($1.2 billion)
for each of the three years of the new Premier League agreement.  BT lost 3.5 percent to 201.7 pence, its largest drop since
November, after the phone and broadband company won the rights
to show 38 matches for 246 million pounds per season.  Nokia, BMW, Daimler  Nokia slumped 18 percent to 1.83 euros, its lowest price
since 1996 and its biggest tumble since 2001. The mobile-phone
maker struggling to recover lost market share predicted that
 second-quarter operating margins  at its devices unit will
worsen. The company plans to cut as many as 10,000 jobs and
close facilities.  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) , the  world’s biggest maker of
luxury vehicles , dropped 2.6 percent to 56.29 euros.  Daimler AG (DAI) ,
the  third-largest maker of luxury autos , decreased 2 percent to
33.60 euros. Morgan Stanley reduced its earnings-per-share
prediction for the carmakers by 5 percent to 10 percent for 2012
to 2014.  Glencore International Plc (GLEN)  and  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  slipped 3.8
percent to 341.7 pence and 2.2 percent to 899.6 pence,
respectively, as a gauge of mining companies lost 1.1 percent.  Teleperformance, Umicore  Teleperformance SA (RCF) , a French call-center company, fell 1.4
percent to 17.77 euros, its third day of losses. The stock was
cut to underperform, meaning investors should sell the shares,
from outperform at CA Cheuvreux.  Umicore SA (UMI)  declined 3.1 percent to 36.37 euros. The world’s
largest recycler of precious metals was downgraded to neutral
from outperform at Credit Suisse, meaning that investors should
not buy more of the stock.  National Bank of Greece SA (ETE) , the  country’s largest lender ,
soared 26 percent to 1.31 euros as bets showed that  New
Democracy , the party that backs the terms of both bailouts from
the European Union, may win the election on June 17.  Petropavlovsk Plc (POG)  surged 14 percent to 469.9 pence, its
largest rally since October 2009. The Russian gold producer
