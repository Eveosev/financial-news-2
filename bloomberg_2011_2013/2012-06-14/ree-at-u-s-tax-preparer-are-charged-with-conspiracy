Three executives of United Revenue
Service Inc., a U.S. tax-preparation business, were charged with
helping clients avoid taxes by setting up undeclared accounts at
Luxembourg and Switzerland branches of Israeli banks.  David Kalai, the founder and former chief executive officer
of United Revenue Service, his son Nadav Kalai, who was the
company’s president, and David Almog, the head of the company’s
New York branch, were charged with conspiracy in a grand jury
indictment filed today in federal court in  Los Angeles .  From about April 2000 to March 2011, the three men
allegedly advised and assisted clients in setting up undeclared
accounts at the branches of two Israeli banks, identified in the
indictment as Bank A Luxembourg and Bank B Switzerland-
Luxembourg. The three created offshore companies in Belize and
elsewhere under whose names the accounts were held, according to
the indictment.  Names of lawyers representing the three men weren’t
immediately available from court records. David and Nadav Kalai
don’t have listed phone numbers and a number for David Almog in
New York was disconnected.  The numbers for the United Revenue Service main office in
Bethesda,  Maryland , and its office in  New York  were also
disconnected.  Sandra Brown, head of the tax division at the U.S.
attorney’s office in Los Angeles, didn’t immediately return a
call for comment on the charges.  The case is U.S. v. Almog, 11-00930, U.S. District Court,
Central District of  California  (Los Angeles).  To contact the reporter on this story:
