The  International Monetary Fund 
raised its growth forecasts for Ethiopia this year and next, and
said inflation in Africa’s second-most populous nation may fall
below 10 percent next year.  The economy may expand 7 percent in the fiscal year to July
7, compared with an April estimate of 5 percent, the Washington-
based lender said in an e-mailed statement today. Growth in the
2012-13 fiscal year may be 7 percent, against a prior forecast
of 5.5 percent, it said.  “A similar growth rate and single-digit inflation are
achievable in 2012-13 if implementation of tight monetary and
fiscal policies is maintained,” it said.  Inflation that was 25.5 percent in May is expected to reach
22 percent by the end of the fiscal year, the IMF said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
