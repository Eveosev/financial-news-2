Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  dropped to
its lowest price in more than 19 years after the Swiss central
bank urged  Switzerland ’s second-largest lender to increase its
capital this year.  The stock slumped as much as 8.8 percent to 17.32 Swiss
francs, its  lowest intraday price  since December 1992.  Credit
Suisse, based in Zurich, traded 7.8 percent lower at 17.51
francs at 11:35 a.m., giving it a market value of 22.5 billion
francs ($23.5 billion).  “For Credit Suisse, given the low starting point and the
risks in the environment, it is essential that it already
substantially expand its loss-absorbing capital base during the
current year,” the  Swiss National Bank  said in its annual
financial stability  report .  The central bank, which also recommended  UBS AG (UBSN)  boost
capital, said improvements can be achieved by suspending
dividend payments or selling new shares in addition to the
banks’ plans for cutting assets.  This is the first time since the SNB began publishing the
financial stability report in 2002 that it singled out Credit
Suisse as needing a bigger improvement in capital than UBS and
putting a time frame on its recommendation.  “The third dividend cut in three years may be a precursor
to significant management changes, which will cause further
uncertainty,” said  Christopher Wheeler , an analyst with
Mediobanca SpA. “In addition, while the bank has been vigorous
in de-leveraging, it may have to do more and reduce its credit
trading risk appetite.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
