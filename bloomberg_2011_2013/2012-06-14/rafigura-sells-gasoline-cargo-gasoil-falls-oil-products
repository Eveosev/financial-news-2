Trafigura Beheer BV sold a cargo of
gasoline for delivery to  Italy . OAO Lukoil’s Litasco sold for a
fifth day on the barge market.  Morgan Stanley bought jet fuel and  diesel  barges for a
second day. Gasoil fell on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in
London for a second day.  Light Products  Vitol Group bought the shipment of as much as 33,000 metric
tons of gasoline for delivery to Santa Panagia, Italy, according
to a survey of brokers and traders monitoring the Platts pricing
window. The trade was priced at $897 a ton, which is lower than
a June 7 deal to the same port at $910.  Gasoline barges for immediate loading in Amsterdam-
Rotterdam-Antwerp traded from $924 to $934 a ton, according to a
similar survey of both the Platts window and the Argus Bulletin
Board. That compares with deal from $921 to $926 yesterday.  BP Plc and Cargill Inc. were the buyers the Eurobob grade,
to which ethanol is added to make finished fuel. Barge deals are
usually 1,000 or 2,000 tons.  Gasoline’s  premium  to Brent, or crack, climbed to $12.11 a
barrel as of 2:07 p.m. local time, according to data from PVM
Oil Associates Ltd., a broker in  London . That’s up from $11.47
in the previous session.  Naphtha’s crack, or discount to Brent, narrowed to $15 a
barrel, from $15.62 yesterday, which was the most since Dec. 17,
2008, PVM data show.  Middle Distillates  Jet fuel, which trades at a differential to the ICE gasoil
contract, was little changed as Morgan Stanley and Royal Dutch
Shell Plc bought for a second day, the Platts survey showed.
Four lots traded at $59 and $60 more than July gasoil, according
to the survey.  On diesel, about 16,400 tons changed hands on the barge
market with Vitol the largest buyer for a second day, the survey
showed. Premiums to July gasoil were little changed from $24 to
$26 a ton.  ConocoPhillips sold two barges of low-sulfur heating oil at
$22 and $24 a ton more than July gasoil, according to the Platts
survey. That’s up from $17 on June 12.  Gasoil for July delivery fell 0.4 percent to $844 a ton on
ICE as of 5:22 p.m. The August contract was at $839.75 a ton,
widening the spread between the two contracts to $4.25 a ton
from $3.75 yesterday.  Gasoil’s  crack  rose to $16.44 a barrel from $15.93
yesterday. Brent was little changed at $97.07 a barrel on ICE.  Refineries  A Russian company is in talks to buy the Coryton oil
refinery in the U.K., a union official said.  The purchaser would upgrade the facility to produce more
diesel, Russ Ball, an official at Unite, the U.K.’s largest
labor union, said today by mobile phone from London, declining
to identify the company.  The Coryton refinery, owned by Petroplus Holdings AG before
it filed for insolvency this year, can process 175,000 barrels a
day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Gasoline accounts
for 36 percent of production, while diesel makes up 27 percent,
according to the U.K.’s Petroleum Industry Association. The
refinery was to have halted by yesterday, Ball said on June 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
