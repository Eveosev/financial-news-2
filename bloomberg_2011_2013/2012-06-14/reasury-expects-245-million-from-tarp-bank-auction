The U.S. Treasury Department
announced pricing for public offerings of preferred stock in
seven banks in the Troubled Asset Relief Program. The Treasury
said it expects the proceeds from the auction to be
approximately $245 million.  ”We’re pleased with the results of today’s auction, which
enabled these community banks to replace temporary government
support with new private capital, and keeps us on track to earn
a positive return for taxpayers from Tarp’s bank programs in
excess of $20 billion,” Tim Massad, Treasury assistant
secretary for financial stability, said in a statement.  The Treasury said in the statement the auction was for
preferred shares of the following banks: Ameris Bancorp of
Moultrie, Georgia; Farmers Capital Bank Corp. of Frankfort,
Kentucky; First Capital Bancorp Inc. of  Glen Allen , Virginia;
First Defiance Financial Corp. of Defiance,  Ohio ; LNB Bancorp
Inc. of Lorain, Ohio; Taylor Capital Group, Inc. of Rosemont,
Illinois; and United Bancorp Inc. of  Ann Arbor , Michigan.  The stock offerings began June 11 and are expected to close
on June 19, the Treasury said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
