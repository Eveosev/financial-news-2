Two decades into their country's  post-liberalization new economy , many Indians, especially the sizeable middle-class, have substantially revised ideas about  government spending  that were accepted without question in the old days of socialism. But the drift rightward is a slow one. If pressed for a "yes" or "no"' answer, most Indians today might still be sympathetic to the current government's adherence to welfarism and subsidies in the sectors of agriculture, education, food and labor. Increasingly, though, what the average Indian would cede to the government on the ground he would take away in the air. In the last decade India's moribund state-owned airline,  Air India , has succeeded in  leaching an astonishing amount of money  from the pockets of taxpayers even as it has had its  market share cut  to 17 percent from 60 percent by more efficiently run private airline companies. A remarkable decade of democratization -- domestic traffic rose five-fold between 2003 and 2012, making  India  the world's  fastest-growing  domestic aviation market -- has also proved to be the sorriest span in the history of the company that was for long the face of Indian aviation. Two recent episodes exemplify all that is wrong today with Air India, which held a monopoly in domestic aviation until 1990. In April, Civil Aviation Minister Ajit Singh announced that the Cabinet had approved a  bailout package  of $300 billion for the airline, subject to certain performance milestones being reached over the next decade -- a move decried by most observers as a textbook example of throwing good money after bad. Worse was to come. In May, several hundred  Air India  pilots went  on strike , protesting differential treatment within the company as a result of the  merger in 2007  of Air India, the state-owned international airline, with  Indian , the state-owned domestic one. The matter still hasn't been resolved, many of the airline's operations have been disrupted, some of the pilots have been  dismissed , and losses have spiraled, thereby defeating any turnaround that the bailout might have created. A list of the problems afflicting the airline would require a book and not a column. They include the lack of a clear center of authority (the airline has a chief executive, but many decisions are also made by the civil aviation minister -- a post that changed hands twice in 2011), a fatal culture of entitlement on the part of employees and indifference on the part of the bureaucrats who manage daily operations, massive outlays on a new fleet without a clear plan for a corresponding expansion in business, mismanagement of  flying rights , troubles with reconciling the methods of the two companies  after the merger , and even a tendency on the part of Indian politicians to see the airline as a kind of private taxi service. (Earlier this year it was revealed that last-minute changes were made to the airline's schedules in April 2010 so that the  family of Praful Patel , the then aviation minister, could fly business class.) As civil aviation minister from May 2004 to May 2011,  Patel  managed to successfully finesse the contradictions of trying to direct the country's general aviation policy even as he tried to plot the future of Air India, and of overseeing the largest expansion in the airline's history even as he agreed that the airline was loss-making and should be sold. As Praveen Donthi, who published a long essay on the recent problems of the airline in the Indian monthly The Caravan last year, reported in " Praful Patel and the fall of Air India ": And in a piece called " India Doesn't Air-India ," the columnist Vir Sanghvi supplied a history of the Indian government's flirtation over two decades with the idea of selling the airline, arguing it was time to finally cut the losses and move on: True, but as Indians have repeatedly  discovered  in recent times, political calculation is much more short-termist and selfish in its approach than economic calculation. Among the marvelous but depressing quotes about the airline and the lobbies that influence its day-to-day operations is one reported last month by  Heather Timmons in the New York Times : And an editorial last month in the Indian Express  said bluntly : If Air India was shut down, it would certainly provoke deep nostalgia among hundreds of thousands of Indians, including myself, who knew no other way to fly in the first blush of our youth, and to whom it once seemed self-evident that a country had to have a "national airline." My first-ever flight was in 1998, from Delhi to  Mumbai  on the former Indian Airlines. I was 18, and just the giddy rush of being airborne for the first time made me look past any problems that my co-passengers might have noticed. The last time I flew Air India, though, in January 2012, I felt differently. Checking in took ages, it was clear that the airline was massively overstaffed and inefficient, not a word of apology was offered for the flight (predictably) being late, the air hostesses did a nice line in grumpiness bordering on contempt, and -- well before takeoff -- I'd decided that I'd had enough, both as taxpayer and consumer, of socialism in the skies.
