Asia  fuel oil  extended gains over
crude, signaling increased profit for refiners making residual
fuels. Hin Leong Trading Pte bought and sold gasoil cargoes in
Singapore, the region’s largest oil-trading center.  Fuel Oil  Fuel oil’s  premium  to Asian benchmark Dubai crude widened
46 cents to 83 cents a barrel at 6:07 p.m. Singapore time,
according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. The
difference widened for a seventh day, the longest rising streak
since December 2008.  Hin Leong bought two 20,000 metric-ton cargoes of 380-
centistoke fuel oil from PetroChina Co., according to a
Bloomberg News survey of traders who monitored transactions on
the Platts window. One shipment, for July 4 to July 8 loading,
changed hands at $3.50 a ton over benchmark quotes, and the
second traded at a $3.75 premium for July 9 to July 13.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade declined 25 cents to $11.75 a ton, PVM said. A narrowing
 viscosity spread  means bunker, or marine fuel, fell less than
fuel oil used in power stations.  Middle Distillates  Hin Leong bought two 150,000-barrel cargoes of  gasoil , or
diesel, with 0.5 percent sulfur at 30 cents a barrel above July
prices, according to the Bloomberg survey. China International
United Petroleum & Chemical Co., or Unipec, sold one shipment
for July 1 to July 5 loading and Glencore International Plc sold
the other for July 4 to July 8.  Hin Leong sold 240,000 barrels of the same grade of gasoil
to Brightoil Petroleum Holdings Ltd. for June 29 to July 3
loading, the survey showed. The transaction was at a 30-cent
premium to prices for June 28 to July 4.  Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude dropped 7 cents to $15.68 a
barrel at 2:07 p.m. Singapore time, PVM data showed. This  crack
spread , a gauge of refining profit, narrowed for the third day
this week.  Jet fuel ’s premium to gasoil climbed 10 cents to $1.10 a
barrel, PVM said. That’s the highest  regrade  so far this month,
indicating it is more profitable to make  aviation fuel  over
diesel.  Light Distillates  Japan naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude
futures fell $4.72 to $2.51 a ton at 5:11 p.m. Singapore time,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This crack spread, a
measure of the profit from making the petrochemical and gasoline
feedstock, dropped for a third day, the longest losing streak
since June 4.  Glencore sold 25,000 tons of open-specification  naphtha  for
first-half August delivery to Noble Group Ltd. at $740 a ton,
according to the Bloomberg survey. Total SA bought a similar
cargo from Royal Dutch Shell Plc at the same price.  Total also bought 50,000 barrels of 92-RON gasoline for
July 10 to July 14 loading from Vitol Group at $102.50 a barrel,
the survey showed. BP Plc sold a similar-sized cargo of 95-RON
grade for July 5 to July 9 to Shell at $105.10 a barrel.  Refinery News  China Petroleum and Chemical Corp., or Sinopec, shut 16
units at its Wuhan refinery for maintenance as of June 12,
parent China Petrochemical Corp. said in an online newsletter.
These include the No. 2 crude distillation, No. 1 catalytic and
No. 2 coking units. The repair work is the only one planned in
the five years through 2015.  Tenders  Qatar International Petroleum Marketing Co., known as
Tasweeq, offered to sell about 30,000 tons of 97-RON gasoline
for July loading from Mesaieed, according to a notice sent to
potential buyers.  Formosa Petrochemical Corp. offered to sell 480,000 barrels
of gasoil with 500 parts-per-million of sulfur for July loading
from Mailiao, an official said today, asking not to be
identified because of internal policy.  Formosa Petrochemical sold 12,000 tons of low-sulfur fuel
oil for June loading at a premium of $65 to $75 a ton to
 Singapore  prices, according to three traders with knowledge of
the transaction.  To contact the reporters on this story:
