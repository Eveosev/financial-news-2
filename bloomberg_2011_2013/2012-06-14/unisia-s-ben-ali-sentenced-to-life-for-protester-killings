A Tunisian military court sentenced
former President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in absentia to life in
prison for his role in the deaths of protesters in several towns
during last year’s uprising that pushed him from power.  The ruling handed down late yesterday was the second in the
same day by a military court against Ben Ali, the official TAP
news agency reported. Earlier, another military court sentenced
him to 20 years in prison for inciting violence that led to the
death of four protesters in the town of Ouardanine. The
demonstrators were trying to stop his nephew from leaving the
country.  Ben Ali and his wife fled the country in mid-January 2011
and are living in  Saudi Arabia . Ben Ali has also been convicted
in civilian courts in other cases. The latest sentence is the
most severe to be handed down against him.  To contact the reporter on this story:
