Greece faces the risk of a
disorderly bankruptcy if it drops its commitment to reform and
the austerity plan after the elections, former  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) 
chief economist  Thomas Mayer  told Rheinische Post in an
interview.  If Greece renounces reform and austerity, the International
Monetary Fund most likely would suspend payments to the country,
the newspaper said, citing Mayer.  To avoid a collapse of Greeceâ€™s economy, the European Union
should continue to provide the money to service Greek debt and
recapitalize its banks, Rheinische Post cited Mayer as saying in
a preview of an article to appear today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
