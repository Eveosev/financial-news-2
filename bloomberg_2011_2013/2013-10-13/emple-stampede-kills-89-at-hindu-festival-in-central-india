At least 89 people, including women
and children, were killed and over 100 injured in a stampede
near a temple in central  India  where about half a million
devotees had converged for a Hindu festival.  Rumors that a bridge they were crossing was about to
collapse triggered panic, causing the worst tragedy in two years
as many jumped into the river to their deaths. About 25,000 were
crossing the bridge at the time of the incident and they were on
their way to the Ratangarh temple in Datia district of  Madhya
Pradesh , D.K. Arya, a deputy inspector general of police in the
state, said in a telephone interview.  Television images showed bodies and clothes strewn on the
bridge as relatives tried to identify the victims. Ten of the
injured were in a serious condition, Arya said, suggesting the
death toll may climb.  Stampedes during mass gatherings aren’t uncommon in the
country with a population of more than 1.2 billion. Government
data show about 102 people were killed in January 2011 at a
Hindu shrine in the southern state of Kerala. A crowd surge at a
 railway station  in northern India killed at least 36 people in
February as Hindu devotees drawn by one of the holiest days of
the world’s largest religious gathering rushed to board trains.
In 2010, 76 people died in four incidents.  To contact the reporters on this story:
