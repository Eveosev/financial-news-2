Egypt ’s benchmark stock index
climbed to the highest level since before the ouster of  Hosni
Mubarak  in early 2011 on speculation political stability will
spur economic growth. Israeli stocks snapped a five-day advance.  The EGX 30 Index rose 0.9 percent to 5,986.8, the highest
close since Jan. 26, 2011, as about 468 million Egyptian pounds
($68 million) of shares traded, compared with a one-year daily
average of 340 million pounds. Orascom Telecom Media &
Technology Holding SAE jumped the most in a month, while
Commercial International Bank Egypt SAE contributed the most to
the index’s gain.  Israel ’s TA-25 Index fell 0.6 percent.  The gauge has rallied 26 percent in the second half of the
year after the military ousted President Mohamed Mursi. The
bourse closed for almost two months in 2011 as a popular
uprising forced Mubarak out of power. The current government is
overseeing constitutional amendments that should lead to
parliamentary elections in the first quarter of 2014. The
economy may grow 2.1 percent this year and 2.9 percent in 2014,
according to the median of 16 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  “The situation now is better than at the end of 2011 and
when Mursi left in July,” said Hisham Metwalli, a trader at
Cairo’s Arab Finance Brokerage. “Investors believe the index
deserves to break the 6,000 point level.”  Holiday  Orascom Telecom Media gained 3.3 percent to 0.63 Egyptian
pounds and Commercial International Bank Egypt SAE, the
country’s biggest publicly traded lender, rose 1.1 percent to
40.07 pounds. The bourse will follow most other exchanges in the
 Middle East  and close from tomorrow for the rest of the week for
the Eid religious holiday.  Oman’s  MSM 30 Index (MSM30)  increased 0.3 percent, while Bahrain’s
measure lost 0.2 percent. Markets in the  United Arab Emirates ,
 Saudi Arabia , Kuwait and Qatar are closed this week, Oman’s
bourse is shut from tomorrow, while Bahrain’s will close after
tomorrow’s trading session.  Israel’s  benchmark index  slid to 1,285.16, led by Israel
Corp., the holding company controlled by Israeli billionaire
Idan Ofer, and Gazit-Globe Ltd. The gauge climbed every day last
week, adding 2.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
