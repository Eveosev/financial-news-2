OZ Minerals Ltd. (OZL) , Australia’s third-largest copper producer, fell the most in almost six months in
Sydney trading as it cut its output forecast by as much as 20
percent and raised its production cost estimate.  The Melbourne-based company  dropped 9.3 percent  to A$3.99
at the close in Sydney, the most since April 22, taking its
decline for the year to 40 percent. Australia’s benchmark
S&P/ASX 200 Index fell 0.4 percent.  Copper production will be 70,000 metric tons to 75,000
metric tons in 2013, lower than an April forecast of 82,000
metric tons to 88,000 metric tons, the company said today in a
statement. Cash costs will be $1.90 a pound to $2.05 a pound,
compared with the earlier forecast of $1.65 a pound to $1.80 a
pound.  The cut is the second this year, after OZ Minerals in April
revised down an earlier forecast of 90,000 tons to 95,000 tons.
The drop reflects lower-than-expected ore recovery at the
eastern end of the Prominent Hill mine in South  Australia , the
company said.  OZ Minerals, which wrote down the value of Prominent Hill
by A$231.9 million ($219 million) in the first half, said copper
production was 17,390 metric tons in the three months to
September 30, from 25,738 metric tons in the same period a year
earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
