The African qualifiers from the 2010
soccer  World Cup  are on track for a repeat in Brazil next year
following the continent’s opening playoff matches.  Nigeria and Ivory Coast secured victories at the weekend,
while Cameroon drew at Tunisia and Algeria scored two away goals
in losing at Burkina Faso. Ghana, the fifth African team to
qualify for the previous edition in South Africa, hosts  Egypt 
tomorrow in the opener of their two-match series.  “We still have to go play Ethiopia at home as if we never
played them, and we’ll take it from there,” Nigeria coach
Stephen Keshi, whose team hosts Ethiopia on Nov. 16, said in
comments on FIFA’s website. “We have to go to  Brazil .”  The return games will be played next month with the five
playoff winners advancing to the 32-nation global championship.
The group-stage draw is Dec. 6 in Costa do Sauipe, Brazil.  Emmanuel Emenike scored two second-half goals, including a
last-minute penalty kick, to give African champion Nigeria a 2-1
win against Ethiopia in Addis Ababa.  Behailu Assefa gave the home team a 57th-minute lead as
Nigeria goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama misjudged a cross. Emenike
tied it 10 minutes later and got the winner from the penalty
spot after he was fouled.  Tunisia drew 0-0 with visiting Cameroon in Rades in
yesterday’s other playoff game. Aristide Bance’s 86th-minute
penalty gave Burkina Faso the win against Algeria in Ouagadougou
two days ago, while Ivory Coast beat Senegal 3-1 at home on
goals by  Didier Drogba , Lamine Siane and  Salomon Kalou .  To contact the reporter on this story:
