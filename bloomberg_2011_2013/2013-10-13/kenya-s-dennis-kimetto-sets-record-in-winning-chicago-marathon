Dennis Kimetto set a course record
for the  Chicago Marathon  men’s race, while fellow Kenyan Rita Jeptoo was the women’s winner in the first 26.2-mile road race
through a major U.S. city since April’s Boston bombings.  Kimetto, who won the Tokyo marathon in February, ran the
42-kilometer course in 2 hours, 3 minutes, 45 seconds, shaving
53 seconds off the mark set a year ago by Tsegaye Kebede of
 Ethiopia . Kimetto finished seven seconds ahead of Emmanuel Mutai
(2:03:52), while Sammy Kitwara was third (2:05:16) to complete a
sweep of the top three places for Kenyan runners.  Jeptoo, who won the Boston marathon in April, finished in
2:19:57. Jemima Sumgong Jelegat, also of  Kenya , was second
(2:20:48), with Maria Konovalova of  Russia  third (2:22:46).  A 30-second silence preceded the start to honor the victims
of the April 15 Boston bombings. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev may face the
death penalty if he’s convicted of killing three marathon
spectators and injuring 260 others in the first deadly terrorist
bombing in the U.S. since Sept. 11, 2001. A date hasn’t been set
for the 20-year-old naturalized American citizen’s trial.  Each of the winners earned $100,000, with Kimetto receiving
an additional $75,000 for setting a course record and Jeptoo
getting a $40,000 bonus for finishing under 2:20:00.  Ernst Van Dyk of South Africa won the male wheelchair
division with a time of 1:30:37 and Tatyana McFadden of the U.S.
won the women’s wheelchair race with a time of 1:42:37.  To contact the reporter on this story:
