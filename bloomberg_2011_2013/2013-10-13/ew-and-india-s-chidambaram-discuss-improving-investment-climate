U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew
and Indian Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram discussed
ways to improve the investment environment in both countries
during a bilateral meeting today.  “We discussed the importance of investment for driving
 economic growth  and  job creation  in our economies and ways to
improve our enabling environments to mobilize investment,
especially for the financing of infrastructure,” Lew and
Chidambaram said in a joint statement released by the U.S.
Treasury Department.  U.S. and Indian officials also discussed “recent economic
and financial developments in our two economies, and in the
world at large, including U.S. fiscal policy,” according to the
statement, which said Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
and  India ’s central bank chief Raghuram Rajan also participated
in the meeting.  U.S.-India bilateral trade in goods and services grew to
$92.5 billion in 2012, from $59.9 billion in 2009, according to
the joint statement. Indian foreign direct investment in the
U.S. increased to almost $5.2 billion in 2012, from $227 million
in 2002, the statement said.  Some areas of tension between the countries include U.S.
complaints about trade barriers in India. Indian businesses that
rely on the U.S. for a large part of their revenues are
concerned about proposed changes to immigration laws that would
restrict the ability of Indian companies to bring workers from
India into the U.S.  To contact the reporters on this story:
