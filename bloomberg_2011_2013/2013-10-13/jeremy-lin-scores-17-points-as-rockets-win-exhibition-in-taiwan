Jeremy Lin scored 17 points as the
Houston Rockets beat the Indiana Pacers 107-98 in an exhibition
game in Taiwan, his parents’ native country.  Lin made three of four 3-point attempts and went 6-for-8
from the floor while also converting both his free-throw
attempts at Taipei Arena last night.  James Harden  led Houston
with 21 points.  Lin, a Harvard University graduate and the first Chinese-or
Taiwanese-American to play in the  National Basketball
Association , joined the Rockets from the  New York Knicks  in July
2012. His parents emigrated to the U.S. from Taiwan in the
1970s.  Houston is seeking to parlay interest in Lin in Asia into
merchandise sales and sponsorship income to help it recoup the
$25 million it has promised to pay the 25-year-old point guard
over three years.  The Rockets, who built a following in China during Yao
Ming’s nine seasons with the team, beat the Pacers 116-96 Oct.
10 in Manila.  To contact the reporter on this story:
