The  New England Patriots  denied the
 New Orleans  Saints their third 6-0 start in franchise history,
rallying for a 30-27 win as Tom Brady threw a 17-yard touchdown
pass to rookie Kenbrell Thompkins with five seconds left.  Brady’s first touchdown pass of the game came on the
Patriots’ last play in Foxboro, Massachusetts, and after the
Saints had scored 10 points in a 65-second span in the closing
minutes of the fourth quarter to grab a 27-23 lead.  “What a football game,” Patriots coach  Bill Belichick 
said at his postgame news conference. “I feel like that took
about five years off my life.”  With the Saints falling to 5-1, the Denver Broncos and
Kansas City Chiefs are the  National Football League ’s only teams
with 6-0 records after both had home wins yesterday.  Knowshon Moreno rushed for three second-half touchdowns as
Denver pulled away for a 35-19 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars
(0-6) after leading 14-12 at halftime.  Peyton Manning  threw two first-quarter touchdown passes for
the Broncos, yet also had an interception returned 59 yards for
a score. The Broncos, who were averaging a league-leading 46
points, failed to cover a point spread that was as high as 28
points, the biggest in NFL history.  “We certainly started well up 14-0 and then just hit a
little lull there,” Manning said. “Sometimes you score a lot
of points and people take it for granted.”  The Chiefs were 24-7 winners over the  Oakland Raiders  (2-4)
as  Jamaal Charles  ran for two scores. Kansas City is the NFL’s
most-improved team this season under new coach  Andy Reid , having
tied for the league’s worst record a year ago at 2-14.  First Win  The Pittsburgh Steelers beat the  New York  Jets 19-6 to
avoid an 0-5 start for the first time since 1968. Emmanuel Sanders scored the only touchdown on a 55-yard third-quarter
reception as Pittsburgh (1-4) sent the Jets (3-3) to their first
loss in three games this season at MetLife Stadium in East
Rutherford, New Jersey.  The Seattle Seahawks (5-1) rebounded from their first
defeat of the season with a 20-13 win over the Tennessee Titans
(3-3) behind a pair of rushing touchdowns from Marshawn Lynch.  Minnesota Vikings running back  Adrian Peterson , playing two
days after the death of his 2-year-old son, had a season-low 62
yards on 10 carries and a fumble in a 35-10 home loss to the
Carolina Panthers (2-3).  “I never thought about not playing,” said Peterson, whose
son died of head injuries sustained while in the care of a man
identified by police as the boyfriend of the child’s mother.  Newton’s Touchdowns  Panthers quarterback Cam Newton ran for a seven-yard score
and threw three touchdown passes, including a 79-yarder to
Brandon LaFell, as Carolina dropped the Vikings to 1-4.  The Green Bay Packers held on to beat the Baltimore Ravens
(3-3) 19-17 in a matchup of two of the past three  Super Bowl 
champions to improve to 3-2. The Dallas Cowboys evened their
record at 3-3 with a 31-16 win over the Washington Redskins
(1-4), while the San Francisco 49ers improved to 4-2 as  Vernon Davis  had 180 receiving yards and two touchdowns in a 32-20 win
against the Arizona Cardinals (3-3).  The Houston Texans (2-4) suffered their fourth straight
defeat, 38-13 at home to the St. Louis Rams (3-3) and lost
quarterback  Matt Schaub  to an ankle injury in the third quarter.
Some Texans fans cheered after the injury to Schaub, who had an
interception returned for a touchdown each of the previous four
games. Schaub’s replacement, T.J. Yates, threw interceptions on
his first two drives, including one that was returned 98 yards
for a touchdown by Alec Ogletree.  Tactless Fans  “That is just tactless and tasteless,” Texas running back
 Arian Foster  told reporters when asked about the home fans
cheering Schaub’s injury. “I don’t care how you feel about a
man. You don’t kick him when he is down.”  The Philadelphia Eagles (3-3) beat Tampa Bay 31-20 as
backup quarterback Nick Foles threw three touchdown passes and
also ran for a score in place of an injured  Michael Vick  to drop
the Buccaneers to 0-5. The Detroit Lions (4-2) were 31-17
winners over the Cleveland Browns (3-3) as  Matthew Stafford 
threw four touchdown passes, including three to Joseph Fauria.  The Cincinnati Bengals (4-2) blew a 14-point fourth-quarter
lead in Buffalo before pulling out a 27-24 win over the Bills
(2-4) on Mike Nugent’s 43-yard field goal in overtime.  Week 6 play -- which began Oct. 10 with the Chicago Bears
(4-2) winning 27-21 to leave the New York Giants 0-6 for the
first time since 1976 -- wraps up tonight with the Indianapolis
Colts (4-1) at the San Diego Chargers (2-3). The  Atlanta Falcons 
and the  Miami Dolphins  had byes.  Patriots’ Win  The Patriots, coming off a 13-6 loss to the Bengals in
which Brady was held without a touchdown pass for the first time
in 53 games, opened a 17-7 halftime lead as Stevan Ridley rushed
for two second-quarter touchdowns.  After New Orleans tied the score 17-17 in the third
quarter,  Stephen Gostkowski  kicked a pair of field goals,
including a 54-yarder, to put the Patriots back in front.  Trailing 23-17 in the closing minutes, the Saints went
ahead as Brees’s 34-yard pass into the end zone on a 3rd-and-20
play was pulled down by Kenny Stills for his first career NFL
touchdown.  Rookie Aaron Dobson dropped a fourth-down pass that would
have given the Patriots a first down on the ensuing drive,
giving the Saints the ball back at the New England 24-yard line
and setting up a 39-yard field goal by Garrett Hartley.  Brady had a deep pass intercepted on the Patriots’ next
possession, yet the Saints weren’t able to run out the clock.
New England got the ball and Brady marched the Patriots
downfield with no timeouts left before tossing the winning score
to Thompkins in the back of the end zone.  “Lord knows we had our chances at the end there,” Brees
said. “You can’t give  Tom Brady  and that offense three chances
at a two-minute drill.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
