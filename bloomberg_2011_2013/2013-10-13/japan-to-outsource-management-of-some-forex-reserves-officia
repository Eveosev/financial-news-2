Japan  plans to let private-sector
financial institutions manage part of its $1.27 trillion in
foreign exchange reserves, a finance ministry official said
today.  The government will introduce a bill to a Diet session
beginning this week that would lift a ban on outsourcing the
management of the reserves, said the official, who asked not to
be named. Japan will continue to buy U.S. Treasuries and other
assets that are perceived to be safe, retaining its investment
stance, the official said.  Japan’s stockpile doubled in the past decade after series
of currency-market interventions to curb a rise in the yen to a
postwar record of 75.35 per dollar in October 2011 that undercut
earnings of exporters from Toyota Motor Corp. to Sony Corp.
Japan is the second largest foreign holder of Treasuries as
 Washington  tries to reach a deal to lift the U.S. debt ceiling
and prevent a default that could shake global financial markets.  The Nikkei newspaper reported today the government’s plans
to outsource management of part of its reserves.  To contact the reporters on this story:
