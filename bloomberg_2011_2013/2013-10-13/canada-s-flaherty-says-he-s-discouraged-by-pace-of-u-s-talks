Canadian Finance Minister Jim
Flaherty said today he’s discouraged by the lack of progress in
talks between U.S. President  Barack Obama  and Republican
lawmakers in Congress to lift the country’s debt ceiling and
avoid a default.  “I was discouraged,” Flaherty said, speaking on Question
Period on the CTV television network, when asked about the
talks. “The U.S. economy is the biggest in the world and it
affects all of us.”  Flaherty also said he hoped a temporary solution could be
reached that would allow negotiations on a longer-term
resolution of U.S. fiscal challenges. “We have some serious
economic problems in the world, and we need to be mindful of
that,” he said.  Speaking of the Canadian economy, Flaherty said he doesn’t
anticipate “huge economic growth in  Canada  in the next few
years.”  Flaherty has been in  Washington  to attend meetings of
finance officials from the Group of 20 nations and the
International Monetary Fund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
