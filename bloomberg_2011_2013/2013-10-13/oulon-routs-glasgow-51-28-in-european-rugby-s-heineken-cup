Toulon opened the defense of its
Heineken Cup rugby title with a 51-28 home win against Glasgow
Warriors. Racing Metro beat last season’s runner-up Clermont
Auvergne 13-9 and Exeter Chiefs defeated Cardiff Blues 44-29.  Centers Maxime Mermoz and Matt Giteau each touched down
twice in Toulon’s six-try haul yesterday. After trailing 34-0 at
half time, Glasgow fought back with two tries by DTH van der
Merwe and one apiece by Niko Matawalu and Jonny Gray. Jonny Wilkinson kicked nine points for the French club before leaving
the game with a hand injury.  In Paris, three Morgan Parra penalties to one from
Jonny Sexton put Clermont 9-3 up at the interval. Marc Andreu
got a second-half breakaway try for Racing which Sexton
converted and the Ireland fly-half added another penalty to
stretch the lead to four points.  Exeter outscored a Cardiff team featuring five British and
Irish Lions by six tries to four.  Edinburgh defeated two-time European champion Munster 29-23
two days ago, when three-time winner Leinster beat the Ospreys
19-9. There were also wins for record four-time champion
Toulouse, Scarlets, Castres, Montpellier, Gloucester, Saracens
and Ulster.  England  and  France ’s top clubs have proposed a breakaway
European tournament to replace the Heineken Cup from next
season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
