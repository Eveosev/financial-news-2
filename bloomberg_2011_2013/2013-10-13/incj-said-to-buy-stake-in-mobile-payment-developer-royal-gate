Innovation Network Corp. of Japan 
agreed to buy a minority stake in Royal Gate Inc., a developer
of mobile payment devices and systems, three people with
knowledge of the matter said.  Government-backed INCJ plans to invest as much as 1 billion
yen ($10 million) for a minority stake in the Tokyo-based
company, said the people, who asked not to be identified before
an announcement scheduled for tomorrow. Shareholders of the
company, including Mizuho Capital Co., may make an additional
investment, the people said.  Royal Gate ’s devices allow credit card charges to be made
to smartphones and other mobile devices. The market for tools
that help consumers buy goods using handsets is projected to
reach  $235.4 billion  in global transaction value this year, up
44 percent from 2012, according to a June 4 report from
researcher Gartner Inc. That includes money transfers, bill
payments and merchandise purchases.  INCJ expects to profit from the investment if Royal Gate
has an initial public offering, one of the people said. INCJ was
formed in July 2009 by then-Prime Minister Taro Aso’s
administration to invest in technology that would make  Japan 
more globally competitive.  An INCJ spokesman declined to comment. Akira Fujii, a
spokesman for Royal Gate, declined to comment.  Royal Gate will use the new funds to hire additional staff
and for expansion into Southeast Asian countries including
 Indonesia , one of the people familiar said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
