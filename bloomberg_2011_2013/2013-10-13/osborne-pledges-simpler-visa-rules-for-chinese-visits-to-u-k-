Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  said the U.K. will simplify the visa application process
for Chinese visitors.  Britain will start a pilot program to allow some Chinese
travel agents to apply for a visa by submitting the same form
they’ll use for a visit the European Union’s passport-free
Schengen Zone, according to a statement.  Osborne is leading a five-day visit to  China  to promote
economic links between the two countries, starting in Beijing.
Among the delegates are London Mayor  Boris Johnson  and
representatives of British technology companies.  “These changes will streamline and simplify the visa
application process for Chinese visitors, while ensuring the
system is strong and secure,” Osborne said in an e-mailed
statement.  Other visa measures include creating a “super priority”
service that will start about the middle of next year. A “VIP
mobile visa” service now operating in Beijing and  Shanghai ,
that reduces the collection process to about five minutes, will
be expanded to other parts of China.  Earlier today, Beijing Construction Engineering Group Co.
and Manchester Airports Group said they’ve formed a venture with
other partners to build an international business district in
Manchester, the U.K.’s second-biggest city. The buildings will
be worth about 800 million pounds ($1.3 billion) when they’re
completed and fully leased, the partners said in a statement.
