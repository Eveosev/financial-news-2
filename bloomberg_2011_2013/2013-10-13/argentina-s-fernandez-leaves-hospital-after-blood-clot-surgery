Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner left a Buenos Aires hospital today after
an Oct. 8 surgery to remove a blood clot close to her brain.  Fernandez left the Favaloro Foundation clinic in Buenos
Aires in good spirits, spokesman Alfredo Scoccimarro said in a
televised address on state-run news agency Telam. Fernandez, 60,
was diagnosed with a subdural hematoma on Oct. 5, eight weeks
after sustaining a blow to the head.  Fernandez first took power in 2007, succeeding her husband
 Nestor Kirchner , who died in 2010. Before the surgery, doctors
had advised that she rest for a month, which would have blocked
her from campaigning with candidates before the Oct. 27 midterm
congressional elections.  To contact the reporter on this story:
