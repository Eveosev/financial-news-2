England’s David Lynn came from six
shots behind to win golf’s Portugal Masters today after a final
round of 63, 8-under par,  Lynn finished on 18-under at Vilamoura, one shot ahead of
South Africa’s  Justin Walters .  Scott Jamieson of Scotland, who tied the European Tour
record by shooting 60 yesterday, had a round of 72 today and
finished on 13-under.  “I must admit I was thinking of Scott Jamieson’s 60,”
Lynn said in remarks on the European Tour  website . “If I could
do something like that, who knows? The wind was up quite a bit
today so 8-under is a really good score.”  Lynn picked up a check for 333,330 euros ($451,000) after
his second victory on the European Tour. His previous win came
at the KLM Open in 2004.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
