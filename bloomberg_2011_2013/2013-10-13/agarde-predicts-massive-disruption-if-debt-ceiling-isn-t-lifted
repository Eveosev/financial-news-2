International Monetary Fund Managing
Director  Christine Lagarde  said the congressional deadlock over
the U.S. debt ceiling is threatening the U.S. and world
economies and cautioned against “creative accounting” to avoid
default.  “If there is that degree of disruption, that lack of
certainty, that lack of trust in the U.S. signature, it would
mean massive disruption the world over,” Lagarde said in an
interview with NBC’S “Meet the Press” program about the impact
of not raising the borrowing limit. “And we would be at risk of
tipping, yet again, into recession.”  Lagarde said the U.S. stalemate “transformed” the
discussions of global finance officials gathered in Washington
this weekend at the  IMF annual meetings .  U.S. Senate leaders of both parties began negotiations to
avert a default even as senators blocked legislation to prevent
one and talks between the White House and  House Republicans  hit
an impasse.  With a partial government shutdown in its 13th day and a
lapse in borrowing authority four days away, the best prospects
for a deal shifted from the House to the Senate, where Majority
Leader  Harry Reid  and Minority Leader  Mitch McConnell  held their
first negotiating session since the shutdown began Oct. 1.  The U.S. is the IMF’s largest  shareholder  with 17.7 percent
of so-called quotas, which determine a country’s voting power
and the amount a country can borrow from the fund.  Japan  is next
largest with 6.56 percent of the quota, followed by Germany at
6.12 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
