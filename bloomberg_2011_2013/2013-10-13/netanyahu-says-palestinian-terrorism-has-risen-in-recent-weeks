Israel  is experiencing a surge in
Palestinian terrorism in what had been the quietest year in more
than a decade, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said today at
the weekly cabinet meeting in Jerusalem.  Netanyahu praised the military’s efforts at thwarting
terror operations, including the discovery last week of a tunnel
dug from the Gaza Strip that officials said was designed to
carry out attacks in Israel. “With this, we see a rise in
terrorism activity during the last few weeks,” the prime
minister said, according to a text message of his remarks sent
by his office.  The Israeli military is checking the circumstances behind
the Oct. 11 killing of an army reserves colonel outside his home
in the northern Jordan Valley, Netanyahu said. Palestinian
suspects have been taken into custody.  A 9-year-old girl was injured by a suspected Palestinian
attacker in the Psagot settlement on Oct. 5. An Israeli soldier
was shot and killed by a sniper while on patrol in the West Bank
city of Hebron on Sept. 22. A day earlier, the army said an
Israeli man was murdered by a Palestinian co-worker who had
planned to use the body to negotiate the release of his brother,
a security prisoner held by Israel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
