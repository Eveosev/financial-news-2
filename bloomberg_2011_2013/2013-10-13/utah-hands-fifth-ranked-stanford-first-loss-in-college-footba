 Stanford University  its first loss of the college football
season and break the Cardinal’s 13-game winning streak.  In other games involving top ten teams in the Associated

first quarter to tie the game 14-14. He added a three-yard
scoring run in the second quarter to give Utah a 21-14 halftime
lead.  “Great win,” Wilson said. “Our plan was perfect
tonight.”  Andy Phillips kicked field goals of 23 and 48 yards in the
second half for the Utes who are 4-2 overall and 1-2 in the
Pacific-12 Conference.  Wilson completed 23 of 34 attempted passes for 234 yards,
two touchdowns and one interception.  “They’re good,” said Stanford coach  David Shaw . “They’ve
always been good and we just weren’t good enough. This is as
well as I’ve seen Utah play on the offensive side. They really
strung things together.”  Stanford (5-1, 3-1 Pac-12) quarterback Kevin Hogan
connected on 15 of 27 passing attempts for 246 yards and one
touchdown.  Tyler Gaffney sprinted one yard for a touchdown while Ty
