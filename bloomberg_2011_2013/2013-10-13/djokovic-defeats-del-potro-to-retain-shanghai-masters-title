World No. 2 Novak Djokovic defeated
Juan Martin  Del Potro  in a third set tie-break today to retain
his Shanghai Masters tennis title.  Serbia’s Djokovic beat the Argentine 6-1, 3-6, 7-6 (7-3) in
two hours, 33 minutes for his 15th ATP Masters crown.  Del Potro saved two match points at 5-4 before the match
went into the tie-break.  “He’s a fantastic player and a great person,” Djokovic
said of his opponent in remarks on the  ATP website . “All the
way up to the last point, I didn’t know if I was going to win
the match. It was a very even match. My motivation is there
always, especially when I’m playing finals of such a big
event.”  Fifth-ranked Del Potro had beaten  Rafael Nadal  of  Spain  in
the semifinals. Nadal replaced Djokovic at the top of the
rankings last week.  “It’s a really bad loss for me now,” Del Potro said. “I
was really close to beating him after beating Nadal.”  In Osaka, Australia’s Samantha Stosur recovered to defeat
Eugenie Bouchard of Canada 3-6, 7-5, 6-2 in the final of the
Japan Women’s Open.  Angelique Kerber of  Germany  beat Serbia’s Ana Ivanovic 6-4,
7-6 (8-6) in the final of the Generali Ladies tournament in
Linz, Austria.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
