A case of 2006 Chateau Mouton-Rothschild, a Medoc first-growth wine estate, sold for 3,715
pounds ($5,930) on the Liv-ex market in the past week, near a
seven-month low amid weakening demand for top  Bordeaux  vintages.  The transaction on Oct. 11 was 0.9 percent down from a
trade at 3,750 pounds the previous day, and just 1.8 percent
above the 3,650 pounds at which it sold on Oct. 3, the lowest
level on Liv-ex for the vintage since February, according to
data on the London-based market’s Cellar Watch website.  The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index, a benchmark for top Bordeaux
wines, has fallen 6 percent since mid-March after gains of 8
percent in the first 10 weeks of this year, leaving it up less
than 2 percent since the end of 2012. Collectors’ reluctance to
buy Bordeaux 2012 wine futures has combined with a sterling
rally against the dollar since July to discourage investors.  “There’s been quite a big exchange effect in the last
month,”  Chris Smith , an investment manager at The Wine
Investment Fund in London, said by telephone. “It’s pretty
striking.” The fund, invested in Bordeaux, manages $50 million.  Mouton ’06 is 12 percent below this year’s March peak of
4,240 pounds and is 37 percent down from its record 5,935 pounds
reached in April 2011 at the height of Chinese demand for
Bordeaux first growths.  Chicago Sale  The vintage is still up 6 percent for this year, and is 13
percent above the 3,300 pounds at which it traded in July 2007
soon after its release to the market.  In the auction rooms,  Hart Davis Hart Wine Co.  sold one
case for $6,572.50 and six others for $5,975 each in  Chicago  in
June, while a separate 12-bottle lot fetched $7,767.50 including
fees at a Hart sale last month, according to its online results.  The 2006 Mouton still ranks as the Pauillac estate’s fourth
most-expensive wine of the past 10 years, lagging only the 2010,
2009 and 2005, according to merchant prices collated by  Liv-ex 
on its Cellar Watch website.  The 2006 Mouton was given a rating of 98+ points on a 100-point scale by U.S. wine critic  Robert Parker , putting it among
the estate’s top five wines of the past half century, according
to data on the  eRobertParker.com  website.  Parker said in a February 2009 tasting note that only 44
percent of the Mouton harvest that year went into its main wine,
the lowest percentage in more than 50 years, boosting quality.
“The selection process has been ratcheted up to the level of
other first-growths, and that is reflected in what is clearly
the greatest Mouton produced since 1982 and 1986,” he wrote.  Cabernet Sauvignon  Parker also said the wine would need “at least 20 years to
reach a teenage status, and probably will not hit its plateau of
maturity for three decades.”  Chateau Mouton-Rothschild  has 84 hectares (208 acres)
planted with red-grape vines.  Cabernet Sauvignon  accounts for 83
percent of the vineyard, Merlot 14 percent and Cabernet Franc
the remaining 3 percent.  The average age of the vines is 44 years and they are
planted at a density of 10,000 per hectare on gravel. The wine
is fermented in oak vats for 15 to 25 days, and then matured for
as long as 22 months in barrels, according to Mouton-Rothschild’s  website .  The vineyard, owned by Baron Philippe de Rothschild SA, was
promoted in 1973 to the ranks of the top Bordeaux first-growth
estates on the left bank of the Gironde estuary, joining the
four other estates designated in the classification drawn up for
Napoleon III’s 1855 Paris Exhibition.  Mouton has been under the control of the Rothschild family
since being acquired by Baron Nathaniel de Rothschild in 1853.
The property was developed extensively by Baron Philippe, who
ran the estate from 1922 until his death in 1988, and since then
has been managed by his daughter Philippine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
