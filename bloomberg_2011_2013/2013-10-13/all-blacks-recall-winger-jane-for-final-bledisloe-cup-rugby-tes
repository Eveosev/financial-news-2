New Zealand included  Cory Jane  in
its 29-man squad for next week’s final Bledisloe Cup rugby Test
against Australia after the winger recovered from a knee injury.  Jane ruptured knee ligaments in pre-season training with
his Hurricanes Super Rugby team in January and had to have
surgery. He made his comeback last week for Wellington in New
Zealand’s ITM Cup national provincial championship.  Jane’s return may allow All Blacks coach Steve Hansen to
move winger  Ben Smith  into the outside center position to
replace regular starting No. 13 Conrad Smith, who is taking a
break from rugby.  Fly-half Dan Carter and tighthead prop Owen Franks weren’t
considered for the Oct. 19 game against Australia in Dunedin
because of injury.  Top-ranked New Zealand already secured the Bledisloe Cup
contested annually with Australia for the 11th straight series
by winning both of their matches in the southern hemisphere’s
Rugby Championship.  ALL BLACKS SQUAD:  Forwards: Dane Coles, Andrew Hore, Keven Mealamu, Ben
Afeaki, Wyatt Crockett, Charlie Faumuina, Ben Franks,  Tony
Woodcock , Brodie Retallick, Jeremy Thrush, Sam Whitelock, Sam
Cane, Steven Luatua, Richie McCaw, Liam Messam, Kieran Read.  Backs: Tawera Kerr-Barlow, Aaron Smith,  Piri Weepu , Beauden
Barrett, Aaron Cruden, Tom Taylor, Ma’a Nonu, Francis Saili,
Israel Dagg, Cory Jane, Charles Piutau, Julian Savea, Ben Smith.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
