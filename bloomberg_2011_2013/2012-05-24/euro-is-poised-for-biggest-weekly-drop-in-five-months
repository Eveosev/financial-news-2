The euro touched its lowest level
since July 2010 against the dollar amid concern the bloc’s
sovereign-debt crisis was deepening in  Spain .  The shared currency erased earlier gains against the dollar
and yen after Catalan President Artur Mas repeated his call for
Spanish central government to help regions access funding and
remained lower after  Standard & Poor’s  cut the credit ratings of
five Spanish banks. Brazil’s real rose against all its most-
traded counterparts as the central bank said it will offer
currency-swap contracts at auction.  “Catalonia reinforces the firmly negative sentiment that
is in place in the investor mindset across asset classes,” said
 Samarjit Shankar , a managing director for the foreign-exchange
group in  Boston  at Bank of New York Mellon. “The specter of
uncertainty will continue to dangle over  market sentiment  and,
in that backdrop, it’s difficult to call a break in the euro
downtrend.”  The euro fell 0.1 percent to $1.2517 at 5 p.m.  New York 
time after touching $1.2496, the least since July 6, 2010. It
was little changed at 99.75 yen. The Japanese currency traded
0.1 percent weaker at 79.68 per dollar.  Hedge funds  and other large speculators  increased wagers 
the euro will decline versus the dollar to a record high for a
second consecutive week. So-called net shorts increased for a
third week, totaling 195,361 in the period ended May 22 compares
to 173,869 for the week before, according to the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission.  Regional Budgets  Catalonia is complying “strictly” with its budget program
and will honor its commitments, according to a statement.
Spain’s government is analyzing “with all caution” requests
from regional governments to help them regain access to  capital
markets , Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria said.  The Bankia group, a Spanish lender nationalized earlier
this month and one of three banks cut to junk today, will seek
19 billion euros ($23.8 billion) of government funds as it
provisions against real estate and non-property loans, according
to a regulatory filing.  Spanish 10-year yields rose 15 basis points, or 0.15
percentage point, to 6.31 percent. They touched 6.51 percent on
May 16, the highest since November.  The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield fell four basis points to
1.74 percent. Cumulative net inflows in to U.S. Treasuries were
more than twice as strong today as average in the past year,
according to BNY Mellon data.  Currency Swaps  Brazil ’s real rose for a third day against the dollar,
trading 2.1 percent stronger at 1.9874. The central bank sold
14,000 currency-swap contracts at auction today, it said in a
statement.  Swaps were offered a fourth consecutive day in a bid to
stem the real’s decline. Brazil’s currency headed for a 1.3
percent weekly advance, its first since April 6 and the most
against the greenback among major peers.  Australia ’s dollar was 0.1 percent weaker at 97.58 U.S.
cents and New Zealand’s dollar gained 0.1 percent to 75.40 U.S.
cents as technical indicators signaled the South Pacific
currencies had fallen too quickly.  “There is a lot of short interest in the currencies and it
doesn’t matter how bad the news is,” said  Richard Franulovich ,
a senior currency strategist at  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  in New
York. “They are probably going to withstand the news and we’ll
see some short covering today.” Short covering is when
investors end bets an asset will decline.  Amid heightened uncertainty in the euro bloc, offshore
investors in the Chilean peso forwards market increased their
bearish bets a record $9.8 billion this week. The peso declined
0.2 percent to 509.56 per  U.S. dollar .  Greek Elections  Europe ’s shared currency was 2.1 percent lower versus the
dollar this week, taking its decline this month to 5.5 percent,
after a Greek opinion poll showed an anti-bailout party gaining
support before June 17 elections. It’s down 1.2 percent versus
the yen in the past five days, leaving it down 5.9 percent in
May.  The  Dollar Index (DXY) , which IntercontinentalExchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six U.S.
trading partners, rose 0.1 percent to 82.402, after climbing as
high as 82.461, the most since September 2010.  The euro declined 1.2 percent this week, the biggest loser
along with the Swiss franc among 10 developed-market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar
added 1.1 percent, the biggest gain, and the yen rose 0.2
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
