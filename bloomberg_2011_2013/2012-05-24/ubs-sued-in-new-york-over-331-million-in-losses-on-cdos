UBS AG (UBS) , Switzerland’s biggest bank,
was sued for fraud in  New York , accused of misleading investors
in a group of collateralized debt obligations.  UBS made misrepresentations about the CDOs’ risk, leading
to losses of at least $331 million, a group of special purpose
entities that made the investments said in a complaint filed
yesterday in New York State Supreme Court.  “Aware that the end of its lucrative CDO business was fast
approaching, UBS resorted to increasingly aggressive tactics to
ensure that the CDOs it was creating could be sold to investors,
even if this required concealing the true nature and risk of the
CDOs’ portfolios,” the plaintiffs said.  Christiaan Brakman, a spokesman for Zurich-based UBS,
declined to comment on the complaint.  The case is Loreley Financing (Jersey) No. 4 Ltd. v. UBS
Ltd., 651785-2012, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
