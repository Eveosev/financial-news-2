Spanish and Italian  government bonds 
declined, increasing the additional yield investors demand to
hold the securities instead of benchmark German bunds.  The yield on 10-year Spanish securities increased five

the rate spread with bunds six basis points wider to 4.88
percentage points.  Italyâ€™s 10-year yield climbed four basis points to 5.71
percent. The yield gap to bunds increased five basis points to
4.34 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
