A Turkish court sentenced Kurdish
lawmaker Leyla Zana to 10 years in jail for nine speeches that
prosecutors say were supportive of a terrorist organization,
Haberturk newspaper  reported .  The punishment by a criminal court in Diyarbakir follows an
appeals court ruling last year that dismissed the case on
procedural grounds and asked for a re-trial, according to the
Istanbul-based newspaper.  Zana won’t serve the sentence unless her parliamentary
immunity is lifted. That happened when she was jailed in 1994
for being a member of an illegal organization. The European
Union frequently called for her release, and she was freed in
2004 and regained her seat in parliament in last year’s
election.  To contact the reporter on this story:
