The cost of insuring against default
on European sovereign and corporate debt rose.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 15 governments climbed three basis points to
318 at 8:30 a.m. in London. An increase signals deterioration in
perceptions of  credit quality .  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings rose three basis
points to 746. The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies
with investment-grade ratings was up 0.5 basis point at 182.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers increased 4.5 basis points to 303 and the
subordinated index rose five to 507.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($12.5 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
