Indian stocks advanced for the first
time in three days after the first increase in gasoline prices
in almost seven months eased reduced concern on the shortfall in
the government’s finances.  Oil & Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC)  the country’s largest state-owned
oil explorer, rose the most in three weeks. Indian Oil Corp.,
the biggest refiner, paced gains among its peers.  Maruti Suzuki
India Ltd. (MSIL) , the biggest carmaker, dropped to its lowest level
since January. The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, gained
0.2 percent to 15,975.10 at 9:30 a.m. in Mumbai. The gauge has
lost 13 percent from a recent high on Feb. 21, exceeding the 10
percent slump that signifies a correction to some investors.  Indian Oil increased gasoline prices by 11 percent as the
rupee slumped to a record low and increased the cost of buying
crude oil. Higher fuel prices will cut losses at state refiners
and help reduce government expenditure on subsidies.  Foreign  investors  sold a net $10.7 million of local shares
on May 21, paring their investment this year to $8.69 billion,
according to the nation’s market regulator. That’s a record for
the period, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Still, overseas  funds  have pulled out a net $71 million
from local shares this month, after becoming net sellers in
April for the first time in 2012, data from the regulator show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
