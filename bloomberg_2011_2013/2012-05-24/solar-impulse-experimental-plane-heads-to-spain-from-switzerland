The experimental sun-powered Solar
Impulse airplane departed from the Swiss airfield of Payerne en
route tonight for  Madrid ’s Barajas Airport, piloted by Andre
Borschberg, the flight organizers said today in an e-mail.  The lightweight plane has almost 12,000 solar cells,
 lithium batteries  powering four engines and a wingspan about
that of an Airbus 340. At least a three-day stop is planned in
Madrid before the craft is piloted on May 28 at the earliest to
Rabat, Morocco, by Swiss adventurer Bertrand Piccard, the
organizers said.  Sponsors of the 100 million-franc ($115 million) project to
fly day and night using no fuel include  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ,  Solvay
SA (SOLB)  of Belgium,  Schindler Holding AG (SCHP)  and Swatch Group’s Omega
brand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
