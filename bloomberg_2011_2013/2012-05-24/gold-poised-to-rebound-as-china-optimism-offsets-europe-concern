Gold futures advanced for the first
time this week in  New York  as central banks increased their
holdings.  Central banks, the world’s biggest holders of gold,
continued to buy bullion in April as  Turkey  raised its reserves
by 29.7 metric tons and Ukraine, Mexico and Kazakhstan boosted
their holdings, International Monetary Fund data show.  “Reports about central banks buying are helping gold,”
 Frank McGhee , the head dealer at Integrated Brokerage Services
LLC in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “We are also
seeing some technical buying.”  Gold futures for June delivery rose 0.6 percent to settle
at $1,557.50 an ounce at 1:46 p.m. on the Comex in New York.
Prices have slumped 6.4 percent this month.  Holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest bullion-backed
exchange-traded fund, expanded 0.2 percent to 1,268.15 tons
yesterday, after sliding 17.5 tons on May 22, the biggest such
drop since Aug. 24, according to figures on the company’s
website.  “Gold ETF investors have responded with remarkable calm to
the price turbulences,” Commerzbank AG said in a report today.
“A number of them already appear to be taking advantage of the
weak price to expand their positions.”  Silver futures for July delivery jumped 2.3 percent to
$28.157 an ounce on the Comex, the first gain since May 18.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
July delivery advanced 0.6 percent to $1,422.40 an ounce, the
biggest gain since May 17. Palladium futures for June delivery
slipped 0.6 percent to $587.50 an ounce, after touching $584.25,
the lowest since Nov. 30.  To contact the reporters on this story:
