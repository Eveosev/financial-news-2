Colombia’s peso rose from a four-
month low as companies bought the currency before local tax
payments due next month and as oil, the nation’s biggest export,
rebounded in  New York .  The peso advanced 0.5 percent to 1,835.45 per  U.S. dollar 
at 10:40 a.m. in Bogota. Yesterday it touched 1,853.95, the
weakest level since Jan. 11. The peso is up 5.6 percent this
year, the second-best performance after the Madagascar ariary
among all currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  “We have big tax payments coming up next month so
companies are taking advantage of these levels to bring in
dollars,” said Jorge Cardozo, an analyst at Bogota-based
brokerage Corredores Asociados. Companies are scheduled to pay
taxes between June 8 and June 25, he said. “Oil is also helping
sustain the peso.”  Oil rebounded from a seven-month low as world powers and
 Iran  struggled to overcome disagreements at their second round
of meetings on the country’s nuclear program. Oil accounts for
about 40 percent of  Colombia ’s sales abroad.  The yield on the country’s 10 percent peso-denominated debt
due July 2024 fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
7.17 percent, according to the central bank. The price rose
0.107 centavo to 122.387 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
