Sava Group d.d., a Slovenian rubber
maker with interests in tourism and real estate, said its first-
quarter loss narrowed on increased sales in the rubber division.  The net loss shrank to 5.8 million euros ($7.3 million)
from 22.4 million euros in the same period a year ago, the
Kranj, Slovenia-based company said in a regulatory  statement .
Revenue advanced 7 percent to 45.4 million euros, it said.  Sava wants to lower its debt load with banks in Slovenia by
yearâ€™s end, which amounted to 372.4 million euros at the end of
March, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
