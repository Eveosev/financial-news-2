India ’s benchmark bonds gained,
pushing yields to a one-week low, on speculation debt purchases
by the central bank will spur demand.  The  Reserve Bank  of India will offer to buy 120 billion
rupees ($2.2 billion) of securities tomorrow, according to a
statement on May 23. Sovereign notes rallied for a third day
even after Indian Oil Corp., the nation’s biggest refiner,
increased  gasoline  prices for the first time in almost seven
months yesterday. The move will help reduce the government’s
subsidy bill, according to Krishnamurthy Harihar, treasurer at
 FirstRand Ltd. (FSR)   “Bond buying by the RBI is a positive,” he said. “The
increase in gasoline prices will be perceived as a reform move,
helping balance the fiscal situation.”  The yield on the 8.79 percent notes due November 2021
dropped one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.50
percent in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. That was the lowest level since May 17.  The central bank has bought 209 billion rupees of notes so
far this month as its dollar sales aimed at stemming the slide
in the rupee drained funds from the financial system. The rupee
touched a record low of 56.3875 per dollar today.  Lenders  borrowed  1.05 trillion rupees from the central
bank’s overnight repurchase-auction window yesterday, the most
since May 14, according to RBI data.  One-year  interest-rate swaps , or derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, were little
changed at 8.02 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
