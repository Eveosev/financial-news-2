A unit of Japan’s  Astellas Pharma
Inc. (4503)  sued  Hospira Inc. (HSP) , accusing the generic pharmaceutical
company of infringing a patent for the drug adenosine, used to
diagnose heart blockages.  Astellas contends  Lake Forest , Illinois-based Hospira is
planning to market its own version of the drug before the patent
expires in 2015, according to a complaint filed yesterday in
federal court in Wilmington, Delaware.  Astellas “will be substantially and irreparably damaged
and harmed” if a judge doesn’t stop the infringement,
plaintiffs’ lawyers said in court papers.  Full-year profit for Astellas, Japan’s third-largest
drugmaker, will rise by 25 percent because of lower taxes and an
absence of costs related to last year’s earthquake and tsunami,
the company said May 10. Astellas  reported  about $12 billion in
revenue for the most recent fiscal year.  “As the world leader in generic injectable drugs, we
remain committed to bringing high-quality, low-price products to
market as soon as possible,” said Hospira spokesman  Daniel Rosenberg  in an e-mailed statement commenting on the lawsuit.  Adenosine is injected to help diagnose coronary artery
disease in patients who can’t exercise adequately during cardiac
 stress tests .  The case is Astellas v. Hospira, 12cv652, U.S. District
Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To see the patent, click: 5,731,296.  To contact the reporter on this story:
