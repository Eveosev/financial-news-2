New Zealand ’s dollar gained against
all of its major counterparts after Moody’s Investors Service
reaffirmed the nation’s AAA credit rating.  Australia’s currency rose for first time in three days
against the  U.S. dollar  as commodities and stocks  advanced .
Moody’s cited New Zealand’s deficit and debt trajectories in
supporting its top rating. Gains were limited as three officials
said loan demand from China’s biggest banks is drying up.  “Commodities are a little higher today, so you can see
Aussie, kiwi higher, but really it’s just about a search for
something better than the euro,” said Eric Viloria, senior
currency strategist for Gain Capital Group LLC in New York.  New Zealand’s currency gained 0.5 percent to 75.34 U.S.
cents as of 5 p.m. in New York. The kiwi traded at 59.98 yen,
0.6 percent stronger.  Australia ’s dollar added 0.2 percent to 97.63 U.S. cents.
It rose 0.3 percent to 77.71 yen.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.1 percent yesterday
and the S&P GSCI World Index of 24 raw materials advanced 0.4
percent.  China’s loan shortfall would be the first in seven years,
according an exclusive Bloomberg News report. A decline in
lending in April and May means it’s likely the banks’ total new
loans for 2012 will be about 7 trillion  yuan  ($1.1 billion),
less than the government goal of 8 trillion yuan to 8.5 trillion
yuan, said one Chinese bank official who declined to be
