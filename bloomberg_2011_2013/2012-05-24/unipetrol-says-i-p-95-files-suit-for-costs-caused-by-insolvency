Unipetrol AS (UNIP) , the biggest Czech oil
refiner, said company I.P.-95 s.r.o filed a suit seeking damages
of 1.79 billion koruna ($88.7 million).  Unipetrol received a notification from the district court
in Ostrava that I.P.-95 claims it suffered damages related to an
“unjustified” and “unfounded” insolvency filing made by its
Unipetrol RPA s.r.o unit, the Prague-based company said in an e-
mailed statement today.  The refiner rejects the claim and will take legal action to
defend itself, Unipetrol said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
