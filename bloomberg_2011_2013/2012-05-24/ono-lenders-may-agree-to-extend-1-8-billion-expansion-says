Grupo Corporative ONO SA is close to
reaching agreement with its banks on extending the duration of
about 1.4 billion euros ($1.8 billion) of loans, Expansion
reported, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter.  Loans currently due mostly in 2013 will be extended to 2017
and 2018, the newspaper said. The number of banks taking part in
the financing will decline to about 12 from 100 at present,
Expansion said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
