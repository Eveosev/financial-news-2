A military prosecutor called for the
death penalty for former Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali over the killing of demonstrators who helped oust him, a
lawyer representing some of the families of those killed said.  The killings took place in the towns of Tala and Kasserine,
lawyer Charfeddine Quillil said by phone today.  The trial is one of a number of legal cases against Ben Ali
who is being tried in absentia after fleeing the country to
 Saudi Arabia  in January 2011.  Ben Ali’s ouster helped inspire uprisings in the region
that have unseated leaders in  Egypt , Yemen and Libya.  To contact the reporter on this story:
