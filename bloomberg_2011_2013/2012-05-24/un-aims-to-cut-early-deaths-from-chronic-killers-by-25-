The  United Nations  may adopt a target
for reducing premature mortality from non-communicable diseases
by 25 percent by 2025 to combat illnesses that account for about
two in three deaths worldwide.  The goal is part of a draft decision of the World Health
Organization’s member states published today at the agency’s
 World Health Assembly  in Geneva. The proposal, led by countries
including the U.S., Russia and  Brazil , may be formally adopted
by the WHO’s decision-making body as early as tomorrow.  The move follows a meeting of the UN General Assembly in
September that agreed on the need to fight the rising tide of
non-communicable diseases such as  heart disease , cancer and
diabetes, without setting specific targets.  The draft decision omits targets proposed in earlier WHO
documents such as cutting global tobacco use and salt intake by
30 percent each by 2025. Instead it says the countries express
“strong support” for setting goals on fighting tobacco,
alcohol, unhealthy diets and physical inactivity, calling for
another meeting by October to finalize a set of global voluntary
goals.  Productivity losses and medical treatment for non-
communicable diseases will total  $47 trillion  through 2030, the
 World Economic Forum  and  Harvard University  said in a study last
year.  The WHO previously set a target in 2007 to reduce deaths
from non-communicable diseases by 2 percent a year by 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
