Fewer tropical storms than normal
will swirl across the Atlantic this year because of the El Nino
effect, the U.K.’s  Met Office  said today.  Seven to 13 tropical storms will develop in the 2012 storm
season that runs from June through November, with 10 the most
likely outcome, the government weather forecaster said in an e-
mailed report. The average from 1980 to 2010 is 12, it said.  “El Nino conditions in the Pacific can hinder the
development of tropical storms in the Atlantic, so how this
develops will be important for the storm season ahead,
particularly from August onwards, which is normally the most
active time for tropical storms,” Joanna Camp, a climate
scientist at the Met Office, said in the report.  The Atlantic will have an average hurricane season this
year, with 12 named storms, AccuWeather Inc. said a month ago.
 Colorado State University  said April 4 that there will be 10-11
storms. WSI Corp., a forecaster serving energy traders, said
this  hurricane season  will be “relatively tame” with 12 named
storms, including seven hurricanes.  The Met office prediction of a “quieter tropical storm
season” occurred the same day that Hurricane Bud with 85 miles
per hour (140 kilometers per hour) winds moved northward off
 Mexico ’s southwest Pacific coast, the National Hurricane Center
said, and may approach land tomorrow night.  To contact the reporter on this story:
