Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) ,
Spain’s second-largest lender, will take non-binding bids for
five portfolios of real estate and loans until May 29, two
people with knowledge of the matter said.  The assets for sale include homes, non-performing loans and
consumer loans, according to the people, who asked not to be
identified because the information is private. A spokesman for
BBVA declined to comment or disclose the nominal value of the
portfolios.  BBVA needs to set aside 1.8 billion euros ($2.3 billion)
excluding tax to cover real-estate losses under new government
rules aimed at bolstering the financial-services industry, the
Bilbao-based bank said on May 14.  Banco Santander SA (SAN) , the
country’s biggest lender, sold two portfolios of non-performing
loans with a nominal value of 1.5 billion euros earlier this
year to meet the rules on provisions.  “We are going to see more and more of these types of
operations in the banking sector,” said Juan Jose Fernandez Figares, chief analyst at Link Securities in  Madrid . “Lenders
on the one hand aim to reduce their exposure to real estate and
on the other hand try to meet new provisioning requirements
established by the government.”  Bankia SA (BKIA) , which has more real estate on its books than any
other Spanish bank, said on Feb. 2 that it would meet
provisioning rules for property assets in part through sales and
leasebacks of loan portfolios and  real estate .  To contact the reporters on this story:
