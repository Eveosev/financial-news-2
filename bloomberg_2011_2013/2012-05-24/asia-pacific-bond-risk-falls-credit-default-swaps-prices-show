The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default fell, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan decreased 1 basis point to 198 basis
points as of 8:59 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc prices show. The index rose 8.5 basis points yesterday
to 201.6 basis points, the highest since Jan. 16 and its biggest
one-day increase since March 20, according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index was little changed at 198
basis points as of 11:00 a.m. in Sydney, Credit Agricole SA
prices show. The gauge rose 5.6 basis points to 198.8 yesterday
after closing as high as 201 on May 18 and as low as 128.2 on
March 19, according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated
market.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index fell 1 basis point to 208.5
basis points as of 10:08 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup
Inc. The benchmark rose 2.7 basis points to 209.7 basis points
yesterday, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
