Juan Cruz has left  Barclays Plc (BARC) ,
where he helped oversee emerging-market corporate credit
research, according to a person with direct knowledge of the
move who asked not to be identified because he isn’t authorized
to speak publicly on the matter.  Brandon Ashcraft, a spokesman for Barclays, declined to
comment. Cruz, who was based in  New York  and responsible for
Latin America, Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa, didn’t
immediately return a telephone call seeking comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
