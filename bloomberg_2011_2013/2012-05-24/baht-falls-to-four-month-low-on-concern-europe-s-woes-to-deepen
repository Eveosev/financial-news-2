Thailand ’s baht dropped to a four-
month low as concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will worsen damped
appetite for emerging-market assets.  Global funds sold $112 million more local shares than they
bought in the first three days of this week, bringing this
month’s net sales to $349 million, according to exchange data.
The currency dropped for a fourth day after  Chancellor Angela
Merkel  said  Germany  has “huge difficulties” with France’s call
for joint borrowing by euro governments.  “Lingering concerns about Greece and Europe’s debt problem
are making investors stay away from riskier assets,” said
 Hideki Hayashi , a researcher at the Japan Center for Economic
Research in Tokyo. “Asian currencies are under growing pressure
to depreciate.”  The baht declined 0.4 percent to 31.64 per dollar as of
3:45 p.m. in Bangkok and touched 31.66, the weakest level since
Jan. 20, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency
may slide to around 32 in the next two weeks, Hayashi said.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, climbed 109 basis points, or 1.09
percentage point, to 5.6 percent.  Exports increased 6.4 percent in April from a year earlier
after falling 6.5 percent in March, according to the median
estimate of economists in a Bloomberg News survey before a
government report due tomorrow.  The yield on the government’s 3.25 percent bonds due June
2017 fell one basis point to 3.57 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
