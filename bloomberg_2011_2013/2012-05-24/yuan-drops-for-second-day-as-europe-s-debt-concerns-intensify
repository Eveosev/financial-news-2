The  yuan  declined for a second day on
concerns divisions among European leaders will frustrate efforts
to avoid a default by Greece, overshadowing the prospect of more
stimulus measures from China.  European Union chiefs clashed at a regional summit over
joint debt sales and called on Greece to adhere to austerity
measures to stay in the euro. The Chinese government said
yesterday it “must proactively take policies and measures to
expand demand and create a favorable policy environment for
stable and relatively fast economic growth.”  The yuan reached
7.97 against the euro today, the strongest level since June 2002.  “Risk sentiment is still poor because of what’s going on
in  Europe ,” said Tommy Ong, senior vice-president of treasury
and markets at DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Ltd. “The yuan will trade
weak against the dollar until we see a rebound in  China ’s
economy in the third quarter.”  The yuan fell 0.05 percent to 6.3379 per dollar as of 10:05
a.m. in  Shanghai , according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade
System. One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, was unchanged at 2.14 percent.  The People’s Bank of China set the reference rate 0.06
percent lower at 6.3247, the weakest level since March 15. The
currency is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either side
of the daily fixing.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan slipped 0.04
percent to 6.3358 per dollar. Twelve-month non-deliverable
dropped 0.03 percent to 6.3970, a 0.9 percent discount to the
onshore spot rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
