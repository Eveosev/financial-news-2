The cost for European banks to borrow
in dollars declined to a two-week low, according to a money-
market indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 47 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 9 a.m. in  London 
from minus 49.5 yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The measure was minus 41.5 basis points on May 4, the
cheapest level since July.  The one-year basis swap was little changed at 68 basis
points below Euribor. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Prices in the forward market for three-month Euribor
relative to overnight indexed swaps -- known as the FRA/OIS
spread -- declined to 33 basis points from 34 yesterday. A fall
signals banks are more willing to lend.  The Euribor/OIS spread held near 38 basis points for the
15th day.  Lenders increased  overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-
based  European Central Bank  yesterday, placing 766 billion euros
($963 billion) from 764 billion euros the day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
