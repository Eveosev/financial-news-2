The U.S. designated the Abdullah
Azzam Brigades, a Lebanese militant group, as a global terrorist
organization.  AAB carried out a July 2010 attack on the Japanese-owned
oil tanker M/V M.Star in the  Strait of Hormuz , the State
Department said today in an e-mailed statement. AAB claimed that
the attack was carried out by its Arabian Peninsula Branch,
according to the State Department.  “AAB has repeatedly articulated its intent to carry out
attacks against Western interests in the  Middle East ,”
according to the statement. “In 2010, for instance, the group
expressed an interest in kidnapping U.S. and British tourists in
the Arabian Peninsula.”  Further, the statement said, AAB is responsible for
numerous indiscriminate rocket attacks from Lebanon against
population centers in northern  Israel .  The State Department took similar action Dec. 15 against
 a leader of the group, Saleh al-Qarawi, a Saudi citizen.  The designation imposes financial sanctions and prohibits
knowingly providing material support.  To contact the reporter on this story:
