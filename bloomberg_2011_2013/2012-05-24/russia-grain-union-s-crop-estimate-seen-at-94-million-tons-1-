Russia’s Grain Union expects the new
season crop starting July 1 to be at least 94 million metric
tons, unchanged from 2011, Arkady Zlochevsky, union president,
said.  The harvest will probably be the same size as last year
even though the southern regions have been dry for a month,
Zlochevsky said today in his Moscow-based office. The new crop
outlook improved as rain began to fall in Krasnodar region and
other areas which needed it this week, he said.  The wheat crop is forecast to be at least 56 million tons
next season, and barley may reach 17 million to 18 million tons,
Zlochevsky said. Sunflower seeds aren’t expected to reach last
year’s record of 9.6 million tons.  The country has shipped 25 million tons of grain and
exports may reach 26 million to 27 million tons this season, he
said. Russia’s carry-over stocks are seen at 20 million tons by
July 1.  Grain shipments may drop to as low as 20 million tons next
season if the margin between domestic and world prices is
narrow, Zlochevsky said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
