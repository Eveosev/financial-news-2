OCC , an organization that clears and
settles all trades on U.S. options exchanges, has been
designated by U.S. regulators as systemically important to the
financial system, according to spokesman Jim Binder.  Chicago-based OCC, formerly known as the Options Clearing
Corp., joins clearinghouses owned by  CME Group Inc. (CME) ,
Intercontinental Exchange Inc. and the Depository Trust and
Clearing Corp. in receiving the designation from the Financial
Stability Oversight Council. The label moves the clearinghouses
closer to heightened supervision under the Dodd-Frank Act. The
designation is subject to appeal and may be completed “as early
as this summer,” according to Anthony Coley, a U.S. Treasury
Department spokesman.  The Clearing House Payments Co. LLC, which operates a
cross-border and domestic wire-transfer system, also received a
letter of designation this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
