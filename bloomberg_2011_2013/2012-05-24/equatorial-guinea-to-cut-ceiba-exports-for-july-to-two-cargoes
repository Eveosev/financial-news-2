Equatorial Guinea  will reduce exports
of its Ceiba crude for July to two cargoes of 1 million barrels
each, one less than in June, a loading program obtained by
Bloomberg News showed.  The west African nation will also export two 950,000-barrel
consignments of its Aseng crude, one less than in June,
according to a separate plan.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
