Air France-KLM Group (AF)  told labor
representatives that its short-haul operations will be reduced
to three businesses following an amalgamation of regional
divisions that’s aimed at cutting costs, a union official said.  The Brit Air and Regional units, which use smaller planes
than Air France’s main operation, will be combined under the
leadership of Lionel Guerin, founder of Airlinair, which will
also be folded into the new business, CFDT union representative
Michel Salomon said following a briefing from the carrier.  A second short-haul arm will be operated by a French
division of Dutch low-cost unit Transavia, Salomon said. Focused
on Paris Orly airport and using as many as 22 planes, up from
about eight today, the business may also perform some flights at
Air France’s main Charles de Gaulle hub, he said.  Air France’s mainline short- and medium-haul business,
based at CDG, will also create a new passenger class offering
discounted fares which will exclude checked luggage, frequent
flyer miles and flexible ticketing, the union official said.  Some 34 aircraft are likely to be cut from the short- and
mid-range fleet, with capacity pared to 2011 levels, he said.  Europe ’s biggest airline will also seek to boost
producivity in its long-haul fleet through increased utilization
while seeking to improve service quality to the level of some
Persian Gulf carriers, Salomon said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
