New stadiums for the Euro 2012 soccer
tournament in Ukraine cost double those in co-host Poland as the
former Soviet republic overtook Togo, Uganda and Tajikistan in a
ranking of corruption.  The CHART OF THE DAY compares Transparency International’s
gauge of perceived corruption with the cost per seat of building
and renovating venues for the June competition in the two
countries. It also shows measures for  South Africa , site of the
2010  World Cup , and Brazil, host of the 2014 competition.  “It’s not surprising to expect significant abuse of power,
embezzlement and corruption in public procurement, which can
include financing of public infrastructure, such as stadiums,”
Olga Savran, manager of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development’s Anti-Corruption Network for
eastern  Europe , said in a May 16 e-mail. “The government
doesn’t have real political will to act against corruption.”  Since Viktor Yanukovych took over as Ukraine’s president in
2010, the country has slipped to 152nd from 134th in
Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index where
a lower rank indicates higher perceived corruption.  Yuriy Hromnytskyi, a spokesman for Borys Kolesnikov, the
deputy prime minister responsible for Euro 2012 preparations,
didn’t answer five calls to his office and mobile phones or a
written request for comment. The government agency managing the
tournament project didn’t respond to a written inquiry.  Officials, including European Commission President  Jose
Manuel Barroso , have pledged to skip matches in protest at the
imprisonment of opposition leader  Yulia Tymoshenko .  To contact the reporters on this story:
