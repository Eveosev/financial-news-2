The pound fell against the dollar and
gilts advanced after a report showed the U.K. economy shrank
more than initially estimated in the first quarter.  The pound fell 0.2 percent to $1.5662 at 9:38 a.m.  London 
time, and was little changed at 80.12 pence per euro, after
earlier strengthening as much as 0.2 percent.  The nationâ€™s 10-year  gilt yield  was two basis points lower
at 1.76 percent after earlier falling to a record 1.738 percent.  Gross domestic product  fell 0.3 percent, compared with a
0.2 percent decline estimated last month, the Office for
National Statistics said today in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
