The Czech Republicâ€™s  PX (PX)  stock index
rose 0.1 percent to 879.20 at its close in Prague.  The following were among the most active  equities  in the
Czech market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  New World Resources Plc (NWR)  , the biggest Czech coking-
coal producer, rose 2.8 percent to 104.9 koruna, rebounding from
its lowest in almost three years. The stock fell 19 percent in
May through yesterday, sending its 14-day relative strength
index to 25. Readings below 30 suggest in technical analysis
that an asset may gain.  Pegas Nonwovens SA (PEGAS)   climbed 0.3 percent to 419.40
koruna, after earlier increasing as much as 2.4 percent, the
biggest intraday jump in three weeks. The Czech maker of
textiles used in hygiene and healthcare said today its first-
quarter net income jumped 36 percent from a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
