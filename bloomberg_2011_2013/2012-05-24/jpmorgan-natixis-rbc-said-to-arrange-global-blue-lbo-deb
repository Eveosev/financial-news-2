Silver Lake  Partners LP and Partners
Group AG hired  Royal Bank of Canada (RY) ,  JPMorgan (JPM)  Chase & Co., and
Natixis to arrange debt financing for the acquisition of Global
Blue, a travel-related tax-refund services provider.  Silver Lake and Partners Group said today they agreed to
buy the Nyon, Switzerland-based company from Equistone Partners
Europe Ltd. for about 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion).  “In this challenging environment we were very fortunate to
work with RBC who led the financing effort, along with JPMorgan
and Natixis, to secure the debt for this investment,” Joe
Osnoss, a London-based managing director at Silver Lake, said in
an e-mail to Bloomberg News.  The acquisition loans will account for 3.5 times Global
Blue’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization, or about 40 percent of the company’s value,
according to three people who declined to be identified because
the deal is private.  A spokeswoman in  New York  for Silver Lake declined to
comment on the financing.  Equistone, which was spun off from Barclays Plc last year,
bought Global Blue in 2007 for 360 million euros. Since then,
the company has doubled its revenue and increased Ebitda to
about 97 million euros from about 35 million euros, according to
Equistone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
