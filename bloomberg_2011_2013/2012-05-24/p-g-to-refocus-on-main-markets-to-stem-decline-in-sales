Procter & Gamble Co. (PG) , the world’s
largest consumer-products company, will pull back spending on
its plan to expand into emerging markets in order to focus on
the largest regions where sales are declining.  “We may have overextended ourselves a bit with the pace of
our portfolio and geographic expansions,” Chief Financial
Officer Jon Moeller said today at a conference hosted by
Citigroup Inc. in New York. The Cincinnati-based company will
make sure areas such as  North America  and China have enough
investment and “will not spend a dollar outside these core
businesses until we are broadly sufficient to win in these
markets,” Moeller said.  Since becoming chief executive officer in 2009,  Robert McDonald  has pushed P&G to invest more in  emerging markets  to
tap a projected growth in middle-class consumers. Last month the
company cut its earning forecast for the fiscal year ending June
30 as declining sales in developed markets like North America
forced it to reduce prices.  The company considers its core businesses to be the 40 with
the most sales, which make up more than 50 percent of its total
revenue, Moeller said. The company has no plans to pull out of a
market, he said.  In January, McDonald called Africa “the next frontier”
for the company. P&G still expects strong sales growth in
emerging markets, Moeller said.  P&G fell 1.2 percent to $62.39 at the close in  New York .
The shares have declined 6.5 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
