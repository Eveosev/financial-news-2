JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s, trading loss
in its London unit is an example of “bad risk management,”
 Andrew Bailey , head of banking supervision at the U.K. financial
services authority, told reporters today.  Bailey said he didn’t “see a conduct issue for the
moment” in the U.K. for the bank.  “It’s a very salutary lesson about the use of models and
the dangers of over-reliance on single models,” Bailey said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
