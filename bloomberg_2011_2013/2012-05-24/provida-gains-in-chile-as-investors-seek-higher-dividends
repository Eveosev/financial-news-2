AFP Provida SA, a unit of  Banco
Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) , rose to a record in Santiago
trading as investors bought to qualify for a dividend payment
and BBVA said it may sell assets in Latin American.  Provida, Chile’s largest pension fund manager, gained 2.7
percent to 2,701 pesos, the highest closing price since at least
June 1994, when Bloomberg records begin.  “The book to receive Provida’s next dividend payment
closes tomorrow and investors are seeking shares that are about
to pay,” said Alfredo Parra, an analyst at Euroamerica
Corredores de Bolsa SA in Santiago. “A BBVA sale would surely
be done through an auction and that may boost liquidity and
attractiveness of the stock.”  Provida will pay a special cash dividend of 167 pesos per
share to holders of record May 25, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The stock’s dividend yield is 13 percent, the fourth
highest among 57 Chilean financial companies, the data show.  BBVA is considering selling all or part of its pension
units in  Chile ,  Colombia , Peru and  Mexico  as there isn’t a big
enough overlap between them and its consumer-banking operations
in those countries,  Spain ’s second-biggest lender said in a
filing to regulators today. Any sale probably won’t happen this
year, the Bilbao-based company said.  Provida had 21.4 trillion pesos ($42.1 billion) under
management as of April, according to data on the website of
Chile’s securities regulator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
