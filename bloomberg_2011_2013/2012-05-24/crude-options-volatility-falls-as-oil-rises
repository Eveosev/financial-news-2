Crude-oil options volatility fell as
underlying futures rebounded from a seven-month low.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
July, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 26.2 percent at 3:55 p.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Volatility rose for the first time in three
days yesterday, to 27.6, when futures slipped below $90 for the
first time since November.  “Volume is definitely down today because we’re back above
$90,” said Fred Rigolini, vice president of Paramount Options
Inc. in  New York . “We’re seeing a little bit of a stabilization
going into the weekend.”  The market is closed on May 28, the U.S. Memorial Day
holiday.  Crude oil for July delivery rose 76 cents to settle at
$90.66 a barrel on the Nymex, after closing yesterday at $89.90,
the lowest price since Oct. 21.  Oil gained as world powers and  Iran  held their second round
of meetings on the country’s nuclear program.  Catherine Ashton ,
the European Union’s foreign policy chief, said in  Baghdad  that
negotiations are “moving forward” even as “obstacles” stand
in the parties’ way.  “Volatility is trading opposite the direction of the
market,” said  James Cordier , portfolio manager at
OptionSellers.com in Tampa,  Florida . “If crude continues to
trade higher the next couple of sessions, we’ll see volatility
come in even more.”  Most-Active Options  The most active oil options in electronic trading today
