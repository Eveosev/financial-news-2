Repsol YPF SA (REP)  said an area off the
coast of  Brazil  it’s exploring with partner  China Petroleum (386)  and
Chemical Corp. contains the equivalent of at least 1.25 billion
barrels of oil.  The BM-C-33 block of the Campos Basin, where the Repsol
Sinopec venture has already drilled three wells, contains at
least 700 million barrels of light crude and 3 trillion cubic
feet of gas, Repsol said in a filing today. Repsol’s stake in
the block is 21 percent. Sinopec, as the Chinese company is
known, has 14 percent,  Statoil ASA (STL)  has 35 percent and  Petroleo
Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  has 30 percent.  Repsol has discovered 14 new deposits of oil and gas in
Brazilian territory since 2008 as it ramped up exploration work
to reverse a decline in reserves. The company’s first Brazilian
well, Guara, is due to start pumping next year and output will
peak at as much as 270,000 barrels a day.  “Brazilian offshore is one of the areas with the highest
hydrocarbon reserves growth in the world,” Repsol said today.  Repsol rose as much as 3.5 percent in Madrid and traded 2.2
percent higher at 13.64 euros at 1:25 p.m. local time. Statoil
gained as much as 2.4 percent to 139.80 krone in Oslo.  Another Giant  Repsol is hunting for oil in 31 countries around the world
including the U.S.,  Russia , Venezuela and Algeria. It is
drilling exploratory wells in  Bolivia , Guyana,  Sierra Leone  and
Alaska. The company plugged wells off the coast of Cuba and
abandoned exploration work there after failing to find oil,
Repsol said last week.  With its most recent Brazilian well, Pao de Acucar, Repsol
tapped a column of oil 500 meters tall beneath the Atlantic
seabed -- that’s more than twice the height of the skyscrapers
opposite the company’s Madrid headquarters. The well lies
beneath 2,800 meters of water some 120 miles off the coast
within the BM-C-33 block.  “We’re very happy to have made another giant discovery,”
Statoil’s Executive Vice President for Exploration Tim Dodson
said in an interview today. “Pao came as a very positive
surprise. The reservoir quality, the light oil and the column
height, all of those three things are moving things in a
positive direction.”  Increase Production  New discoveries at Repsol overtook production in 2010 and
last year the excess rose to 62 percent from 28 percent the year
earlier. The company plans to increase production pumping oil
and gas from new deposits in Spain, Peru, Bolivia and  Venezuela 
over the next three years.  Deutsche Bank AG analyst Mark Bloomfield this month
forecast output may increase by 9 percent a year through 2016,
reaching about 500,000 barrels a day compared with about 300,000
a day last year. He said production may reach 581,000 barrels a
day by 2020.  To contact the reporters on this story:
