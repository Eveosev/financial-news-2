Ozak Gayrimenkul Yatirim Ortakligi
AS, a Turkish real-estate investment trust, gained after signing
an agreement with  Emlak Konut Gayrimenkul (EKGYO)  Ortakligi AS, the
country’s biggest developer.  The shares added 0.4 percent to 2.58 liras at the close in
Istanbul, after earlier gaining as much as 2 percent.  Ozak will pay Emlak Konut 52.2 million liras ($28 million),
or 36 percent of 145 million liras of revenue it expects from
office and commercial buildings it will construct on land owned
by Emlak Konut in Istanbul’s Atasehir district, Ozak said in a
statement to the  Istanbul Stock Exchange  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
