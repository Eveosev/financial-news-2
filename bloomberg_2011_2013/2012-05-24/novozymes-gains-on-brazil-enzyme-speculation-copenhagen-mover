Novozymes A/S (NZYMB) , the world’s largest
maker of enzymes, traded at the highest price in a month in
Copenhagen on speculation it will boost sales in  Brazil .  Novozymes rose as much as 3 percent to 159.20 kroner, the
highest since April 24. The stock advanced 2.9 kroner, or 1.9
percent, to 157.50 kroner at 10:01 a.m. in the Danish capital.  Graal Investimentos SA’s biofuel unit said yesterday it
will build five plants in Brazil to produce ethanol from sugar-
cane residues. Bagsvaerd, Denmark-based Novozymes said it will
also build new facilities in the South American country because
it will supply the five plants with enzymes.  Novozymes reported on April 25 a 9 percent decline in
first-quarter sales, measured in local currencies, in part
because its ethanol-producing clients used fewer enzymes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
