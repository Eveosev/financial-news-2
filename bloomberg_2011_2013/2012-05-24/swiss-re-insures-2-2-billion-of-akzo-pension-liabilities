Swiss Re Ltd. (SREN) , the world’s second-
biggest reinsurer, sold  Akzo Nobel NV (AKZA)  a longevity insurance
contract to cover the risk that 17,000 British pensioners live
longer than expected.  The contract that takes effect from Aug. 1 covers 1.4
billion pounds ($2.2 billion) of liabilities and is the third-
biggest sold by Zurich-based Swiss Re, said Rolf Tanner, a
spokesman for the reinsurer. Swiss Re, which sold the world’s
first longevity bond in December 2010, plans to hold the Akzo
Nobel contract on its balance sheet, the company said.  “This is potentially very profitable but comes with an
above-average risk,” according to  Christian Muschick , a
Frankfurt-based analyst with Sylvia Quandt Research, adding that
Swiss Re has “solid expertise” in the field. “Many reinsurers
are still very wary regarding longevity. Small mistakes can make
a huge difference.”  Pension funds sitting on more than $23 trillion of assets
are buying insurance against the risk their members live longer
than expected. Swiss Re’s previous longevity contracts include
$3.4 billion of liabilities for  Friends Provident  and 1 billion
pounds at the Royal County of Berkshire Pension Fund.  “This transaction supports our ambition to de-risk our
pension liabilities over time, at an attractive price without
requiring additional funding from Akzo Noble,” said Keith Nichols, chief financial officer of the Amsterdam-based
specialty chemical and coatings maker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
