Spending on  luxury goods  in the U.S.
has slowed since the end of the year, with jewelry putting in a
worse performance, MasterCard Advisors SpendingPulse said.  Luxury sales, excluding jewelry, climbed 1.8 percent in
April from a year earlier, after gaining 6.7 percent in the
first quarter and 13 percent in the fourth quarter, Purchase,
New York-based SpendingPulse said. Jewelry sales fell 3.7
percent in April.  Tiffany & Co. (TIF)  today cut its profit and sales
forecasts amid weaker-than-expected results in the U.S.  Sales growth in luxury goods is slowing amid restrained
spending from tourists after posting strong gains in 2011,
 Michael McNamara , a SpendingPulse vice president said. Luxury
sales occur in large cities, particularly  New York , and demand
is dropping because of the stronger dollar and Europe’s economic
troubles, he said. Stock market gains that bolster the
confidence of affluent consumers also haven’t been enough, he
said.  “The environment is getting more difficult,” McNamara
said in a telephone interview today. “It doesn’t seem that the
wealth effect is enough to hold the sector up against economic
headwinds.”  Jewelry sales turned downward last month after a 5.3
percent increase in the first quarter and a 7.4 percent gain in
the fourth quarter.  The figures include sales at the top 10 percent of prices.
