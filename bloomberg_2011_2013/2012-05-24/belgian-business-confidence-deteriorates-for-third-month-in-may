Belgian business confidence worsened
for a third month in May to the lowest since November, led by
deteriorating sentiment in construction.  The  confidence index  for  Belgium  declined to minus 11.2
from minus 10.7 in April, the Brussels-based  National Bank of
Belgium  said today in an e-mailed statement. Economists
projected a drop to minus 11, the median of 16 forecasts
compiled by Bloomberg.  “The decline in May is to be attributed exclusively to a
marked deterioration of the business climate in the building
industry, mainly due to a lower utilization of the equipment and
to a drop in orders received,” the central bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
