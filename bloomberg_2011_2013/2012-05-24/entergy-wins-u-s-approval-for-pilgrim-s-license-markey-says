Entergy Corp. (ETR)  won U.S. Nuclear
Regulatory Commission approval to renew the operating license
for its Pilgrim power plant, with agency Chairman  Gregory Jaczko 
the lone dissenter, Representative  Edward Markey  said.  Pilgrim’s license is scheduled to expire on June 8 after 40
years, according to the NRC’s website. The plant is in Plymouth,
Massachusetts, about 38 miles (61 kilometers) southeast of
Boston.  Markey criticized the decision, saying the agency
“shouldn’t be short-circuiting the process and short-changing
residents by moving forward with license approval before all the
efforts to improve nuclear and environmental safety at Pilgrim
Nuclear Power Station have been resolved,” Markey, a
Massachusetts Democrat, said today in an e-mail.  Jaczko, who is resigning from the commission, said in his
vote posted on the agency website that his colleagues support a
renewal process that is “unprecedented in license renewal
proceedings and provides little basis for action.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
