month, dimming the outlook for exports.  Government bonds  were

shrank in April amid waning global demand. An HSBC Holdings Plc
and Market Economics report today showed an index tracking
manufacturing in China fell to 48.7 from 49.3 in April, signal a
seventh straight month of contraction. China is Taiwan’s biggest
overseas market.  The survey outcome “is negative for sentiment in China and
 Asia ,” Credit Agricole CIB wrote in a note to clients today.
