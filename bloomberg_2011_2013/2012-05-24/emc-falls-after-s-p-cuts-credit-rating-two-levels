MEMC Electronic Materials Inc. (WFR) , the
second-largest U.S. polysilicon maker, fell to its lowest price
in more than a decade after Standard & Poor’s Rating Services
cut its corporate credit rating two levels to B+ from BB.  MEMC, based in St. Peters, Missouri, fell 6 percent to
$1.58 at the close in New York, the lowest since September 2001.  S&P cited “the continued weakening of the solar power
sector,” in a statement today. The B+ rating is four levels
below investment grade.  Polysilicon is the main raw material in solar cells. The
solar industry is facing oversupply and may see the first drop
in demand this year in more than a decade, according to a
Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
