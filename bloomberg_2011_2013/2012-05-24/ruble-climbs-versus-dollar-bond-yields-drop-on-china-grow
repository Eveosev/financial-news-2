The ruble weakened for a second day
against the dollar on bets  Russia ’s exports to its biggest trade
partner will be hurt as Europe’s debt crisis deepens.  The Russian currency lost 0.2 percent to 31.755 per dollar
by the 7 p.m. close in Moscow, after falling the most since
November yesterday. The country’s 28 billion rubles ($882
million) of local OFZ due 2027 also declined, increasing the
yield by four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 8.86
percent.  A six-hour European summit ended early today with an
exhortation to Greek voters to elect a pro-austerity government
on June 17 that makes the budget cuts needed to keep the
financially ravaged country in the euro. The European Union is
Russia’s largest trading partner.  “The main focus is  Europe ,” Dmitry Sinitsyn, head of
foreign exchange in Moscow at Credit Suisse Group AG, said by e-
mail.  Russian dollar-denominated debt due 2015 rose, cutting the
yield by one basis point to 2.289 percent. Similar-maturity
notes issued by OAO Sberbank, the country’s largest lender,
yielded ten basis points less than yesterday at 3.783 percent,
while the yield on 2015 Eurobonds from state gas monopoly OAO
Gazprom dropped 15 basis points to 3.789 percent.  The cost of insuring Russian debt against nonpayment over
five years with credit default swaps dropped one basis point to
245 basis points. The contracts rose by 15 basis points
yesterday.  Investors increased bets on the ruble weakening, with non-
deliverable forwards showing the currency at 32.2425 per dollar
in three months, compared with expectations of 31.652 per dollar
yesterday. The ruble declined 0.2 percent to 39.94 per euro and
0.2 percent to 35.4383 against the central bank’s target dollar-
euro basket.  The Russian currency has weakened 7.4 percent against the
dollar since the end of April, heading for its sharpest monthly
drop since September. Over the same period  Brazil ’s real sank
6.1 percent,  India ’s rupee lost 5.2 percent and the Chinese  yuan 
depreciated 1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
