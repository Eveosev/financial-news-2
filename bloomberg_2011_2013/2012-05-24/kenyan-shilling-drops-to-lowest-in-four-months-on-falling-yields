Kenya ’s shilling dropped to a four-
month low as falling yields on government debt outweighed the
central bank’s efforts to support the currency by curbing  money
supply .  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy depreciated
0.5 percent to 85.38 per dollar as of 2:04 p.m. in Nairobi. A
close at this level would be the lowest since Jan 25, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency has weakened for
three of the past four days.  The shilling’s slide against the dollar is due to
“dropping yields on  government securities  which are unlikely to
attract carry trade inflows,” Nairobi-based  NIC Bank Ltd. (NICB)  said
in a note to its clients. “Continued dollar demand from
corporate hedging against depreciation of the shilling and
further pressure on the shilling from the continuing woes in
 Europe , points toward a weaker shilling.”  Six-month yields fell for the 19th straight week yesterday,
with 182-day bills borrowing costs sliding to 10.915 percent
from 20.914 percent realized on Jan 23, the Central Bank of
Kenya said. The yield on 91-day Treasury bills declined to
10.075 percent at a May 17 sale from 20.799 percent on similar-
maturity debt sold Jan. 12, it said on its  website .  The central bank accepted 1 billion shillings ($11.7
million) of bids for  repurchase agreements  at a weighted average
rate of 17.39 percent after offering 2 billion shillings of the
securities, a Kenyan official, who declined to be identified in
line with policy, said today in Nairobi.  Lower borrowing Target  Kenya has lowered its local borrowing target to 62.1
billion shillings from 119.5 billion shillings for the fiscal
year ending June 30, replacing shilling-denominated financing
with a $600 million syndicated loan arranged by Citigroup Inc.,
 South Africa ’s Standard Bank Group Ltd. and London-based
Standard Chartered Plc.  The euro traded close to the weakest level since July 2010
versus the dollar as European leaders clashed over joint bond
sales at a summit and offered no immediate relief for recession-
wracked  Spain .  “The euro crisis is back in full speed hitting high-
yielding assets and the sentiment against the euro,” said Bernd Berg, a currency strategist at Credit Suisse Group AG in Zurich.  Tanzania’s shilling weakened 0.5 percent to 1,597 to the
dollar and the Ugandan shilling depreciated 0.1 percent to 2,490
per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
