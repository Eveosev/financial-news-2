Pakistan , the South Asian nation
where persistent power shortages have sparked riots, is facing
calls from the  Asian Development Bank  to step up energy-
efficiency measures as utilities’ debts mount.  Boosting efficiency is the cheapest way to narrow the power
deficit, Pil-Bae Song, a senior adviser at the bank’s regional
and sustainable development department, said today. “The
financial situation of power utilities there is very bad.”  Power demand in Pakistan has long outstripped supply,
causing blackouts and hampering growth. Energy companies are
locked in so-called circular debt, whereby the power utilities
grappling with unpaid bills delay payments to fuel suppliers,
which in turn owe money to refiners and explorers.  “If you improve efficiency by 10 percent, that’s
equivalent to a saving of a 1,000-megawatt power plant,” Song
said by phone from Paris. The ADB can also help investors in the
industry manage risk by providing loan guarantees that cut the
cost of financing, he said.  “That way we can capitalize on money from the private
sector,” which is essential to cover the cost of developing
electricity infrastructure, he said.  The gap between power demand and supply surged to a record
7,500 megawatts on May 10, the Geo television channel reported.
Blackouts have triggered violent protests in several cities in
Punjab province.  To contact the reporter on this story:
