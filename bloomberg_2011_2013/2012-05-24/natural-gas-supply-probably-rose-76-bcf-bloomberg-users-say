The U.S. Energy Departmentâ€™s natural-
gas inventory report, scheduled for release at 10:30 a.m. in
 Washington , will show that supplies rose 2.9 percent last week,
according to a survey of Bloomberg users.  The report will show that inventories gained 76 billion
cubic feet in the week ended May 18 to 2.743 trillion cubic
feet, according to the survey.  Natural gas for June delivery fell 1.3 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $2.724 per million British thermal units on the  New
York  Mercantile Exchange at 10:20 a.m.  Bloomberg compiles the anonymous survey based on estimates
by at least 100 users each week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
