United Utilities Plc (UU/) , the U.K.’s
largest publicly traded water company, said full-year profit
before tax fell 14 percent on higher investment at its water and
wastewater treatment facilities.  Profit before tax for the year ended March 31 dropped to
280.4 million pounds from 327.1 million pounds a year earlier,
the Warrington, England-based company said in a statement today.
Sales rose 3.4 percent to 1.56 billion pounds. The company will
pay a dividend of 32.01 pence a share.  United Utilities spent 154 million pounds renewing its
water and wastewater facilities, 24 million pounds more than a
year earlier. Its total  capital investment  over the fiscal year
was 680 million pounds. Targets set by the U.K.’s Water Services
Regulation Authority require that United Utilities spend over 3
billion pounds through 2015 on its facilities and network.  “Our focus on operational performance is delivering
further service improvements for customers,” Chief Executive
Officer Steve Mogford said in the statement. “We remain on
course to meet our regulatory outperformance targets.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
