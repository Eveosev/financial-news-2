Swiss exports fell in April, adding
to signs the francâ€™s strength is curbing foreign sales.  Exports adjusted for inflation and working days decreased
0.9 percent from March, when they dropped a revised 2.4 percent,
the Federal Customs Office in Bern said in an e-mailed  statement 
today. Imports gained 2.6 percent and the  trade surplus  narrowed
to 1.33 billion Swiss francs ($1.39 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
