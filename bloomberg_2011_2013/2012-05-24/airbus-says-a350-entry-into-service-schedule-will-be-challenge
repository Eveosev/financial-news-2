Airbus (EAD)  SAS will struggle to meet a
revised schedule to put its A350 wide-body model into service in
the first half of 2014, the head of the program said.  “It’s tight but it remains feasible,” Didier Evrard, the
executive vice president at Airbus, told journalists today at a
press briefing in Toulouse,  France , where the planemaker is
based. “We’ll have further challenges.”  Airbus pushed back planned entry into service of the A350
aircraft by as much as six months in November 2011, to the first
half of 2014, as some parts arrived late. Evrard said entry into
service would likely be in the latter part of that period,
assuming Airbus is able to meet its commitments to airline
customers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
