New Zealand , which aims to be a
smoke-free nation by 2025, will increase cigarette taxes by 10
percent in each of the next four years in a bid to reduce
tobacco consumption, the Pacific nation’s finance minister said.  “Previous increases in the excise have reduced tobacco
consumption as smokers have given up or cut back and fewer young
people begin smoking,” Finance Minister  Bill English  told
parliament in his budget speech yesterday.  The tax increases, beginning Jan. 1, 2013, will take the
cost of New Zealand’s  best-selling  cigarette brand --  Pall Mall 
-- to at least NZ$22.87 ($17.20) for a pack of 20 in 2016 from
the 2011 average price of NZ$14.20. Anti-smoking groups say the
measure will cut smoking by making it less affordable, while
 tobacco companies  predict it will boost sales of illegal and
counterfeit cigarettes.  The government is forecasting taxes on domestic and
imported tobacco products will generate 17 percent more revenue
in 2016 at NZ$1.34 billion from A$1.14 billion in 2011,
according to the  budget .  About 650,000 New Zealanders, or 20 percent of  people  over
the age of 15, smoke, according to the government’s
parliamentary  report  on tobacco use. The number of people who
smoke has declined from one in four 15 years ago, according to
the report, as smoking in bars, restaurants, workplaces and
national parks has been banned and taxes have increased.  “We are rapidly moving towards a smoke-free Aotearoa with
today’s announcement of a substantial increase on the taxation
of tobacco products,” Skye Kimura, tobacco control adviser for
the Cancer Society, said yesterday in a statement titled
“Thumbs up!” Aotearoa is the Maori name for New Zealand.  British American Tobacco Plc (BATS) ’s New Zealand unit, which has
more than 70 percent of the country’s tobacco market, blames
“ever higher tobacco taxes” for driving the black market for
cigarettes.  “We see it as vitally important that governments establish
workable tax regimes and economic policies that do not create
conditions that encourage illicit trade,” British American
Tobacco says on its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
