It would appear from India's unnaturally low taxpayer base, widespread anecdotal evidence of  tax evasion , and lack of procedural clarity and prosecutorial energy on many aspects of tax collection that the country's  Ministry of Finance , the Department of Revenue, and the Central Board of Direct Taxes are incapable of working cohesively. Nonetheless, these bodies spoke in one voice last week through  a "white paper"  on the problem of black money in India that was tabled in Parliament by Finance Minister  Pranab Mukherjee , who said in a prefatory note: Mukherjee is right. The issue of black money and corruption is one that greatly inflames Indian people, especially the country's middle class, which over the years has come to think of this problem as a leech that is draining  India  of its vigor. Every so often I receive an  e-mail or petition  from a well-meaning friend or acquaintance that contains details of how much money has been siphoned into Swiss bank accounts, how the recovery of these vast sums could make India prosperous in one stroke, and how I can be a true Indian by sending the e-mail on to at least 10 others and thereby help start a mass movement against black money. It doesn't help that, as with sex and sabotage, black money is one of those subjects where the imagination can run wild. Among the prominent Indians who have spread sensationalist thinking on the subject is the popular  godman Baba Ramdev , who  claimed last year  that the amount of black money available was seven times the size of the Indian economy today and that when it was recovered, "one rupee will be equal to 50 dollars" (one dollar is currently about 55 rupees). This kind of thinking is populist not just in the sense of appealing to the sense of injury and fantasies of power of large audiences, but also in how it allows its recipients to overlook their complicity in what is being deplored, as MK Venu once pointed out in a piece called " No black-or-white ." In such circumstances, the white paper on black money was much needed if public debate on the subject was to be made more complex. Indeed, it is quite elegantly written, has a definite voice, and provides a wealth of interesting figures and analyses. It makes distinctions between different categories of illegal income, points out the  myriad and often sophisticated ways  in which money can be slipped out of the purview of the tax system by individuals, corporations and nonprofit bodies, how black money often doesn't leave the country for good but returns through different channels in a phenomenon called " round tripping " and how different estimates of the size of the shadow economy can arrive at grossly overstated figures (such as by  projecting an average figure  back across decades). It also refutes many canards about the size of Indian holdings in Swiss banks. It suggests that one of the ways in which the problem might be curtailed is by extensive reforms in the mining and natural-resources sectors, which currently provide many gateways (along with  real estate and gold ) for  income generation outside the books  through windfall gains and help generate  slush funds for political parties . It sensibly points out how tax compliance can be improved by further liberalization ("Non-tariff barriers to economic activity are generally worse than tariff barriers. Where one cannot get a permit to undertake a legitimate activity, the transaction costs approach infinity, and create insurmountable incentives for unreported and unaccounted activities that will inevitably generate black money.") And it suggests ways in which the government itself can tackle leakages in public expenditure by moving to cashless systems and transfers, thereby combating perceptions of inefficiency or corruption that have made many citizens cynical about paying taxes. The report came in for criticism from the main opposition party, the BJP, which bizarrely  compared it to a bikini  ("it conceals all the essentials and reveals only the non-essentials"), thereby keeping up its track record of feminizing every dispute on which it has an opinion, from a nationalism that pictures the country as Mother India to a view of Indian culture that inevitably ends up demanding that Indian women  behave a certain way . (The party also released its  own report  on black money four years ago, a document worth reading for its unashamedly partisan and hyperbolic prose.) A more pertinent critique of the government's paper was supplied in an editorial in the business newspaper Mint, which suggested that what the document pointed out was the gap between knowledge and action, and concluded: The same paper also published an interesting  comparative survey  of the scale of the black-money problem in the BRICS economies, and pointed out: And in a sage editorial, the  Indian Express observed : Clearly, much work lies ahead of both government and citizens before the size of India's black economy can be brought down from 20 percent of gross domestic product (which seems to be the most reasonable estimate of the scale of the problem). In the meantime, be a true Indian and read the  100-odd pages  of the report before you make your next move, or claim.
