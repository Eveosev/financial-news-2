New York  University Professor  Nouriel Roubini  said Greece will probably become insolvent and leave the
euro this year or next,  Handelszeitung  reported.  “An orderly exit of Greece from the euro is linked to
considerable economic pain,” Roubini wrote in the Swiss
newspaper today. “But to watch the slow and disorderly collapse
of the Greek economy and society would be much worse.”  Roubini said “other periphery countries already have
problems” similar to Greece’s in terms of their debt burden and
lack of competitiveness. Portugal “will probably have to
restructure its debt at some point and leave the euro. Illiquid
but potentially solvent economies like Italy and Spain will need
the support of Europe, whether Greece exits or not,” he wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
