The slump in the  Standard & Poor’s
500 Index (SPX)  may be nearing an end after the measure dropped below
its 150-day average, which may lure buyers into the market,
according to Oppenheimer & Co.  The benchmark gauge slipped 8.7 percent between April 2 and
May 18, falling below its average price from the prior 150 days
on May 17 for the first time since Dec. 19, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Oppenheimer’s Carter Worth wrote in a May 21 report that
declines to the 150-day average may prompt pessimists to stop
selling and persuade investors who missed out on the market’s
rally through April to buy.  The S&P 500 is “down to a level where rebound potential is
high and that the right thing to do now is to put some money to
work on the long side,” Worth, the New York-based chief market
technician at Oppenheimer, wrote in the May 21 report. The  stock
index  rose 1.8 percent this week through yesterday.  Worth highlighted 90 stocks to buy that are down to levels
where “selling pressure is judged likely to abate.” The list
included  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/B) ,  Intel Corp. (INTC) ,  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) 
and  Starbucks Corp. (SBUX)   “If and as these names stop going down (read: stabilize)
and actually start to rebound, one can make inferences about the
current market correction being at an end,” Worth wrote in the
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
