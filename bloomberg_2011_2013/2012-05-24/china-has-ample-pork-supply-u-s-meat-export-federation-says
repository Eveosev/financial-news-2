U.S. hog producers may have to
“temper” expectations for pork shipments to  China  this year as
the world’s biggest pork consumer ramps up production, said Joel Haggard of the  U.S. Meat Export Federation .  “We see through the remainder of the year ample pork
supplies, unless there’s some kind of anomaly that happens in
the market,” Haggard, the federation’s Asia-Pacific vice
president, said today on a conference call with reporters. U.S.
producers will “have to temper expectations for continued
growth in China. However, we are in the longer run looking at
incredible opportunities as they face sustainability challenges
for production.”  Chinese pork prices are falling as supplies are said to be
“ramping up,” Haggard said. Even with price declines, it still
remains profitable to raise hogs in China, he said. Chinese
prices are expected to strengthen in the second half of the year
because of demand, he said, without giving a specific forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
