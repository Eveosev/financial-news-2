Former Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
executives including ex-Chairman Richard Fuld won approval of a
$90 million settlement of claims brought by shareholders in the
defunct firm.  Lehman’s insurers are funding the settlement, reached in
August. U.S. District Judge  Lewis Kaplan  in  Manhattan  approved
the agreement today.  “While some may be concerned at the lack of any
contribution by the former director and officer defendants to
the settlement, lead counsel’s judgment that the $90 million
bird in the hand is worth at least as much as whatever is in the
bush, discounted for the risk of an unsuccessful outcome of the
case, is reasonable,” Kaplan said in a written opinion.  Lehman, based in New York, was the fourth-largest U.S.
investment bank before its 2008 bankruptcy. Investors blamed the
firm’s former officers and directors for their losses on Lehman
shares and options from June 12, 2007, to Sept. 15, 2008.  The case is In Re Lehman Brothers Securities and Erisa
Litigation, 09-MD-2017, U.S. District Court, Southern District
of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
