Ukraine, where half the male
population and 13.2 percent of women smoke tobacco according to
World Bank calculations, barred smoking in public places two
weeks ahead of the Euro 2012 soccer tournament.  Lawmakers in the capital Kiev today approved a law
prohibiting smoking in food establishments, administrative
buildings, on public transport and in hotels, according to the
legislation.  All public places will be allowed to restrict the space for
smoking to 10 percent of total areas and must be equipped with
ventilation, according to the bill.  To contact the reporter on this story:
