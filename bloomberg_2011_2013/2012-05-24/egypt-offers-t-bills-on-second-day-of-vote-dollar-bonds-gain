Egypt  will offer 4.5 billion Egyptian
pounds ($745 million) of treasury bills today as yields rose
ahead of the second day of voting in the country’s presidential
election. The dollar bonds advanced.  The North African country will seek bids for six- and 12-
month notes valued at 2 billion pounds and 2.5 billion pounds,
respectively, according to central bank data on Bloomberg. The
mid-yield on one-year notes in the secondary market rose six
basis points, or 0.06 of a percentage point, to 15.76 percent
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the
highest level in almost two months.  The debt sale is part of a  Finance Ministry  plan to raise
150 billion pounds this quarter, the last of the country’s
fiscal year. The ministry has fallen about 6 percent short of
its 102 billion-target so far, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Egyptians are heading to the polls for the second and final
day in the country’s first presidential election following the
ouster of  Hosni Mubarak  last year. More than 50 million eligible
voters will choose one of 13 candidates, with a possible run-off
round scheduled for mid-June.  The yield on the 5.75 percent dollar bonds due in 2020 fell
three basis points to 6.86 percent at 11:30 a.m. in Cairo,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. That brought the
rate’s drop this week to 28 basis points. The Egyptian pound was
little changed at 6.0381 a dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
