Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is in
talks to sell a stake worth as much as $2 billion to  China 
Investment Corp., the country’s sovereign wealth fund, to raise
money to buy back shares held by  Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) , Reuters  reported ,
citing people it didn’t identify.  Alibaba is also in talks with private equity firms
including Bain Capital LLC, Blackstone Group LP and Hony Capital
Ltd. to raise as much as $500 million, according to Reuters.  John Spelich, a Hong Kong-based spokesman at Alibaba,
declined to comment on the report when contacted by Bloomberg
News. Phone calls to CIC’s Beijing media office after normal
business hours went unanswered.  Alibaba, China’s biggest e-commerce company, this week
agreed to repurchase about $7.1 billion of stock held by Yahoo,
cutting the stake held by the U.S. shareholder by half. The
Chinese company said it will fund the transaction through equity
and debt financing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
