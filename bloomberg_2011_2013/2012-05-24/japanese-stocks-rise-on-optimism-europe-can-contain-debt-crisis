Most Japanese  stocks  rose on
speculation they are undervalued and as European leaders clashed
on methods to tackle the debt crisis and keep  Greece  in the
monetary union.  Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd., Japan’s third-largest shipping
line, rallied 5.1 percent after falling 5.8 percent last week.
 Sharp Co. (6753)  jumped 7.1 percent on report the electronics maker
will produce liquid-crystal display panels in China with Hon Hai
Precision Industry Co.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker that counts
Europe as its biggest market, dropped 2.2 percent.  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  rose 0.1 percent to 8,563.38
at the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo, after swinging between gains and
losses about 15 times. Volume on the gauge was 5.7 percent above
the 30-day average. The broader  Topix (TPX)  Index added 0.1 percent to
722.25, after earlier falling as much as 0.7 percent.  “Investors are so sensitive about European debt that they
are swayed by every remark on the issue,” said  Naoki Fujiwara ,
who helps oversee $6.6 billion at Shinkin Asset Management Co.
in  Tokyo . “Some people are inclined to buy shares because
Japanese stocks are undervalued.”  Shares on the Topix closed at their lowest price to book
ratio since 2008 at the end of last week. The 25-day Toraku
index, which compares advancing and declining shares, fell to
67.2 yesterday. A reading below 70 suggests stocks are close to
bottoming.  Kawasaki Kisen jumped 5.1 percent to 144 yen. Nidec Tosok
Corp., a precision machinery maker that plunged 19 percent last
week, soared 7.1 percent to 724 yen.  Sharp Surges  Sharp, Japan’s largest maker of liquid-crystal displays,
gained the most on the Nikkei 225, climbing 7.1 percent to 395
yen after the Nikkei newspaper reported the company is in talks
with Taipei-based Hon Hai to provide technology for a new LCD
factory in Chengdu, China.  The Topix has plunged 17 percent from this year’s high on
March 27 as China’s economic growth slowed, and on renewed
concern about Europe’s debt crisis. The political gridlock in
Greece after an inconclusive election this month reignited
concern the nation will renege on austerity pledges required for
240 billion euros ($302 billion) in aid and exit the euro.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  were little
changed today as European leaders clashed over joint bond sales
at the EU summit in Brussels, while they called on Greece to
stick with austerity measures needed to stay in the euro. Greece
is scheduled to have a second election on June 17.  The 18th summit in more than two years of crisis fighting
was marked by new French President  Francois Hollande  challenging
the German-dominated deficit-cutting orthodoxy that has failed
to stabilize the euro area and led to speculation that Greece
might be forced out.  Euro Clash  Germany has “huge difficulties” with France’s call for
joint borrowing by euro governments, Chancellor Angela Merkel
told reporters in Brussels early today after six hours of talks.
“We took varying positions on euro bonds. I laid out our German
position that we need much stronger economic cooperation in the
euro area.”  Canon lost 2.2 percent to 3,160 yen. Nintendo Co., a video-
game console maker that gets a third of its revenue from  Europe ,
slipped 1.7 percent to 8,950 yen, its lowest since 2003.  The S&P added 0.2 percent in  New York  yesterday, reversing
a decline of as much as 1.5 percent, after Federal Reserve Bank
of Minneapolis President Narayana Kocherlakota said the central
bank has the tools to insulate the  U.S. economy  should Europe’s
debt crisis worsen.  Some exporters fell after a private survey showed China’s
manufacturing may shrink for a seventh month in May. The 48.7
preliminary reading for a purchasing managers’ index released
today by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics compares with
49.3 for April. If confirmed June 1, it would mark the longest
run of below-50 readings since the global financial crisis.  TDK Corp. (6762) , a manufacturer of electronic parts which gets
about 60 percent of its revenue from Asia, fell 2 percent to
3,420 yen. Ebara Corp., a pump maker that gets more than a fifth
of its revenue in the region, slid 1 percent to 293 yen.  -- With assistance from Toshiro Hasegawa in Tokyo. Editors:  Jim
