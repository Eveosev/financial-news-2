Mexico ’s peso dropped to a six-month
low as U.S. economic data damped the outlook for demand from the
chief buyer of the Latin American country’s exports.  “It adds to that doom-and-gloom scenario,” Aryam Vazquez,
an economist for global  emerging markets  at  Wells Fargo & Co .,
said in a phone interview from Harrington Park,  New Jersey .
“There is a risk for further downside if the global risk
outlook deteriorates further.”  The peso fell 0.2 percent to 14.0153 per dollar at 4 p.m.
in Mexico City, it weakest closing level since Nov. 28. The
currency yesterday declined yesterday as much as 1.2 percent to
14.0775, the lowest intraday level since Nov. 28. It has fallen
0.6 percent this year.  The central bank yesterday sold dollars for the first time
since 2009 to support the peso as  Europe ’s debt crisis
discouraged demand for higher-yielding assets. The bank sold
$258 million yesterday at an average  exchange rate  of 14.01
pesos per dollar, according to a statement on its website.  Since November, Mexico’s central bank has been offering
$400 million daily at an exchange rate that is at least 2
percent weaker than the previous day’s official fix level to
reduce volatility. It didn’t sell any of the U.S. currency in
its three auctions today.  Brazil ’s real gained 0.2 percent today to 2.0292 per dollar
after the country’s central bank sold currency swap contracts at
auction for a fourth day in a week. The South American country’s
currency rallied yesterday the most in seven months after a sale
of the contracts.  Drop in Yields  The yield on Mexican local-currency bonds due in 2024 fell
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 6.25 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price increased
0.13 centavo to 132.51 centavos per peso.  Mexico’s consumer prices fell 0.48 percent in the first two
weeks of May, the national statistics agency said on its website
today. The median estimate of 17 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
News was for a drop of 0.45 percent.  The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index, a measure of  consumer
confidence  in the U.S., was minus 42 in the seven days ended May
20 after an almost four-month low of minus 43.6 in the prior
period. The measure, which has a margin of error of 3 percentage
points, slumped 12.2 points over the previous four weeks. The
U.S. is the destination of 80 percent of Mexican exports.  Companies placed fewer orders for computers, machinery and
other capital equipment in April for a second month, the
Commerce Department reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
