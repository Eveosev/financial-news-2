(Corrects shortfall amount in fourth paragraph.)  New Jersey Governor  Chris Christie 
plans to return to the state’s clean-energy fund for another
$279 million to narrow a budget gap of as much as $1.3 billion,
according to the state’s treasurer.  Christie plans to use $200 million for the fiscal year
ending in June and $79 million for fiscal 2013, Treasurer Andrew Sidamon-Eristoff told the legislature’s budget committee
yesterday. That will add to the $466 million he’s already taken
from the fund that invests in renewable energy and efficiency
programs.  Energy taxes fell by as much as $330 million this year as
sustained power outages following  Hurricane Irene  and Tropical
Storm Lee, along with lower natural-gas prices and a warmer
winter, depressed sales-tax collections. This contributed to the
drop-off in receipts, the treasurer said.  With the diversion, the state will face a $314 million
shortfall in revenue this year, Sidamon-Eristoff said.  New
Jersey ’s revenue will also be $362 million below Christie’s
projections for the fiscal year that starts July 1.  The 49-year-old Republican governor will face resistance
from the Democrat-controlled state legislature, which must
approve his plan to divert the clean-energy funds, said
Assemblyman John McKeon.  “I’m going to make every effort to prevent the governor
from taking this money,” McKeon, a Democrat, said today in an
interview. “It’s up to us to stop him from raiding the clean-
energy fund.” The funds are collected through a 3.8 percent
surcharge on utility customers’ bills.  State-tax revenue may lag behind Christie’s targets by $668
million in fiscal 2012 and $635 million in the year that begins
July 1,  David Rosen  of the nonpartisan Office of Legislative
Services told the Assembly Budget Committee yesterday.  Christie’s $32.1 billion spending plan for fiscal 2013
counts on a 7.3 percent revenue gain, the most since before the
recession that began in December 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
