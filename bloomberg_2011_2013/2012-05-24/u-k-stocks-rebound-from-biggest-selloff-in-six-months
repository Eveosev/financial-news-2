U.K. stocks  rose, rebounding from
their biggest selloff in six months, as European Union leaders
called on Greek voters to stick to austerity measures if they
want to remain in the euro.  Randgold Resources Ltd. (RRS)  rallied 8 percent as a gauge of
mining companies climbed from a 2 1/2-year low.  Cable & Wireless
Communications Plc (CWC)  jumped 18 percent after posting earnings that
beat analysts’ estimates.  Standard Chartered (STAN)  Plc rose as
JPMorgan Chase & Co. recommended the lender.  The FTSE 100 Index gained 83.64, or 1.6 percent, to
5,350.05 at the close in  London , paring yesterday’s 2.5 percent
tumble. The gauge has still  lost 10 percent from its 2012 high ,
entering a so-called correction. The FTSE All-Share Index rose
1.5 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index added 1 percent.  “The FTSE 100 is remaining stubbornly in the black despite
a barrage of negative data,” said Chris Beauchamp, a market
analyst at IG Index in London. “All the ingredients are present
for a selloff, but it seems we’ve had enough of those for now.”  Stocks sank yesterday, led by banks and mining companies,
amid mounting concern  Greece  may leave the euro area. The
decline dragged the  FTSE 100 (UKX) ’s  valuation  yesterday to 9.4 times
its companies’ estimated earnings, the cheapest since November,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Brussels Meeting  EU leaders met in Brussels last night to discuss the
sovereign-debt crisis that has wiped more than $4 trillion from
 equity markets worldwide  this month. They clashed over joint
debt sales as they called on Greece to stick with the austerity
measures required to stay in the euro.  A report today showed that the  U.K. economy  shrank more
than initially estimated in the first quarter after the  Office
for National Statistics  revised construction output to show a
deeper slump. Gross domestic product fell 0.3 percent, compared
with a 0.2 percent decline estimated last month.  Elsewhere, euro-area  services and manufacturing output 
contracted in May more than economists had forecast and  German
business confidence  dropped.  Even so, mining companies advanced as an  industry gauge 
rebounded from its lowest level since October 2009. Randgold
increased 8 percent to 5,170 pence,  Vedanta Resources Plc (VED)  gained
5 percent to 999.5 pence and Rio Tinto Group rose 1.7 percent to
2,838.5 pence.  Cable & Wireless Communications jumped 18 percent to 33.01
pence, the largest gain since March 2003, after posting full-
year  earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization  of $901 million. That exceeded the average analyst
estimate of $884.5 million.  Standard Chartered  Standard Chartered  gained 1.9 percent to 1,337 pence,
recouping some of yesterday’s 3.7 percent drop. JPMorgan
reiterated its overweight, or buy, recommendation for the
lender, saying the recent decline by bank shares created an
opportunity for long-term investors.  Mothercare Plc (MTC)  surged 24 percent to 203.25 pence, its
biggest rally since 2003. The retailer reported a 2.4 percent
increase in full-year sales to 812.7 million pounds ($1.3
billion) and an 18 percent jump in international revenue. Numis
Corp. raised its  recommendation for the shares  to buy from hold
with a price estimate of 250 pence.  Banks also rebounded today.  Barclays Plc (BARC)  gained 2.7 percent
to 185.3 pence,  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  increased 1.9
percent to 21.44 pence and  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  added 1.4 percent
to 514.8 pence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
