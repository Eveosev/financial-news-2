Barwa Real Estate Co. (BRES) , Qatar’s
second-largest property developer by market value, plans to
award contracts to build a 2 billion-riyal ($550 million)
residential community for laborers within two months.  “We floated the tender now and we expect to award it in
July,” Chief Executive Officer Abdulla Al Subai told reporters
in Doha. The project will be completed “in phases in the next
two years.”  The community, to be built in an industrial area on the
outskirts of the capital, will accommodate 50,000 workers and
include residential units, catering facilities, recreational
areas, Al Subai said.  Qatar, which won the rights to host the 2022  World Cup ,
plans infrastructure projects that will require laborers to
build. These include a $35 billion rail and metro network, a new
port, a city for 200,000 people and expansion of a new airport
that is due to open this year. The country plans to invest $225
billion in the five years from 2011 to 2016, half of which will
be spent on the hydrocarbons industry, according to a government
report released last year.  Barwa, which counts government-owned Qatari Diar Real
Estate Investment Co. as its biggest shareholder, will complete
close to 7,000 homes this year as well at its Barwa City, Barwa
Commercial Avenue and Barwa Al Saad projects, Subai said.
Outside of Qatar, the company plans to finish a residential
project in Istanbul next year, he said.  The company announced plans to build the Lusail Golf
Residential Development in a release today. The project will
include homes and sport facilities, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
