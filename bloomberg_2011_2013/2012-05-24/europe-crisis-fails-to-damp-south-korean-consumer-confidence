South Korean  consumer confidence  rose
to the highest level in 15 months as easing inflation helped to
offset concern that  Europe ’s debt crisis will undermine growth.  The  sentiment index  was at 105 in May, the strongest since
February 2011 and up from 104 in April, the  Bank of Korea  said
in an e-mailed statement today. A reading above 100 indicates
optimists outnumber pessimists.  South Korea’s won fell to the weakest level in more than
seven months and  government bonds  rose yesterday amid doubts
Europe will succeed in containing the sovereign-debt crisis as
Greece teeters on the brink of an exit from the euro. Inflation
moderated to a 21-month low of 2.5 percent in April and today’s
report showed that expectations for price gains have declined.  The consumer confidence index is based on survey responses
from 2,091 households in 56 cities. It was conducted by mail and
telephone between May 11 and May 18. The expected inflation rate
over the next year was 3.7 percent in May, slower than last
month’s 3.8 percent, the report showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
