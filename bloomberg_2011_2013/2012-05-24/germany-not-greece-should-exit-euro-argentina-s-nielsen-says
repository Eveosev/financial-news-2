Germany  should exit the euro and
revalue its currency as “damage control” to avoid the effects
of contagion stemming from a Greek exit, which would cripple
banks and trade in  Europe , according to former Argentine Finance
Secretary Guillermo Nielsen.  Germany’s higher productivity warrants a higher, less
competitive valuation for its currency, Nielsen, 61, said in a
phone interview yesterday. A Greek exit would be more costly and
threatens the solvency of the region’s banks, he said.  “The discussion so far has been framed by the predominant
power in the region, Germany,” said Nielsen, named finance
secretary in 2002, months after  Argentina  defaulted on $95
billion of debt. “Instead of searching for the truth, they
continue to keep the discussions under politically correct
guidelines. They need to break the standstill.”  A German exit would be easier to promote than a devaluation
of the periphery and would help generate confidence, Nielsen
said from  Buenos Aires , where he is a consultant. Politically,
it won’t be feasible for Germany to increase transfers to
southern Europe, he said.  Meanwhile, the rest of Europe needs to push through
“radical change,” and  Greece  should issue paper bills to use
as quasi-currency immediately, according to Nielsen.  “A cross between an I-owe-you and paper money would help
bridge the funding gap and avoid Greece going down the drain,”
said Nielsen. “Simultaneously, Greece should stop all movements
of capital. They should have done that a long time ago.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
