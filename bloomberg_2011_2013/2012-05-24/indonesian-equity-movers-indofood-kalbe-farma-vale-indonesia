Shares of the following companies had
 unusual  moves in  Indonesian trading . Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the close in Jakarta.  The  Jakarta Composite index  rose 0.1 percent to 3,984.87.  PT Garuda Indonesia (GIAA)  , the national flag carrier,
gained 4.2 percent to 740 rupiah. Crude oil for July delivery
dropped 2.1 percent to $89.90 a barrel in  New York  yesterday,
erasing gains through 2011. A lower oil price helps cut the
airline’s fuel costs. The shares also advanced after  Bisnis
Indonesia  reported Garuda signed a memorandum of understanding
with Accor SA,  Europe ’s biggest hotel operator, to help attract
more passengers. Pujobroto, a spokesman at Garuda, didn’t return
a call to his mobile phone.  PT Telekomunikasi  Indonesia  (TLKM IJ), the nation’s biggest
telephone company, fell 3.2 percent to 7,500 rupiah, the lowest
close since April 11. The shares dropped on concern its planned
acquisition of Pacnet Ltd. will be too expensive, according to
Lanang Trihardian, an analyst at PT Syailendra Capital in
Jakarta. Reuters reported May 8 that Telkom made a bid for
Pacnet valued at about $1 billion. Telkom Finance Director
Honesti Basyir and Eddy Kurnia, a spokesman at the company,
didn’t return calls to their mobile phones.  To contact the reporter on this story:
