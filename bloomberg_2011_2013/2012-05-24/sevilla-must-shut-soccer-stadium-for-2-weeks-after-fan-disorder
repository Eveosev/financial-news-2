Spanish soccer team Sevilla was
ordered to shut its stadium for two weeks after fans threw
flares and smoke bombs onto the field during a May 2 game
against crosstown rival Real Betis.  The sanction was announced in an e-mail statement by
 Spain ’s Interior Ministry, which didn’t say when the closure
would be. Sevilla must also pay a 90,000 euro ($113,000) fine.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
