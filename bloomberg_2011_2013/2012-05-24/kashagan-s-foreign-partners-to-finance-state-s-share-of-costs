Eni SpA (ENI) ,  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  and  Royal
Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  agreed to shoulder the investment costs owed by
Kazakhstan’s state energy producer for one of the world’s
biggest oil fields this year and next.  The international partners, which also include  Total SA (FP)  and
 ConocoPhillips (COP) , will bear KazMunaiGaz National Co. costs in the
offshore Kashagan field for 2012 and 2013, the Kazakh oil and
gas ministry said in a statement late yesterday.  “The parties agreed that the consortium will finance the
share of KazMunaiGaz’s investments in the project in the period
in 2012-2013,” it said.  The Kazakh government had considered a request from the
international partners to raise the budget for the first phase
of  Kashagan  by 20 percent to $46 billion, a person with
knowledge of the matter said at the start of the year. They
would bear the extra costs themselves, the person said.  The Caspian Sea field will produce 370,000 to 450,000
barrels of oil a day in the first phase, which may double in the
second phase in 2018 or 2019, the government said last year.
Production is slated to begin in June 2013 at the latest.  The oil and gas ministry oversees Kashagan’s production-
sharing agreement, which allows the investors to recoup costs
before the government takes its share of oil revenue.  Eni, Shell, Exxon and Total each hold a 16.8 percent stake
in the field, as does KazMunaiGaz, according to the website of
the North Caspian Operating Co. venture. Conoco holds 8.4
percent and  Japan ’s  Inpex Corp. (1605)  has 7.56 percent. The venture
didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.  Amend Budget  The Kazakh government reached an agreement with the
international partners to amend the budget for Kashagan, the
Astana-based ministry said in the statement.  In addition to the revised payment structure, the foreign
partners won’t be reimbursed for “some costs” in connection
with the project, the ministry said, without elaborating.  The gas shipping unit of KazMunaiGaz will buy as much as 83
percent of the gas produced in the first phase of Kashagan to
supply the domestic market until 2041, the ministry said.  Kashagan gas will be sold to the state at $80 per 1,000
cubic meters through 2016, Oil and Gas Minister Sauat Mynbayev
told reporters in Astana today, according to Novosti-Kazakhstan.
Beyond that, 75 percent of gas will be sold until 2020 and 83
percent of gas after 2020 at average domestic prices, he was
cited as saying.  The Kashagan partners have invested $33 billion in the
development of the Caspian Sea oil deposit, the state-owned
Kazinform news service reported in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
