European Union export licenses for
soft wheat fell to the lowest in 14 weeks, while those for corn
jumped to the highest level since November, according to data
published by the bloc.  The EU issued licenses to export 84,162 metric tons of soft
wheat in the seven days through May 22, according to a report
released on the bloc’s website today. That’s 30 percent lower
than the previous week and the least since the seven days ended
Feb. 14, based on data from the 27  member states .  Paris milling wheat for November delivery has been trading
above December-delivery wheat in  Chicago  since February, making
European grain less attractive to importers.  Corn-export licenses issued by the EU jumped to 109,572
tons in the week, from 40,180 tons in the seven days through May
15, according to the data. That’s the highest since the week
ended Nov. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
