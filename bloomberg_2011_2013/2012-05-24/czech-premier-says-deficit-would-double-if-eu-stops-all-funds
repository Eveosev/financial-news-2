The Czech public-finance deficit
would double to as much as 6 percent of economic output if the
European Union withheld all funding payments the state budget is
based on, Prime Minister Petr Necas said.  The EU has asked Prague to take corrective measures in
management and control systems related to the use of its funds
before it resumes payments to Czech programs,  Jose Manuel
Barroso , European Commission president, said at a joint news
conference with Necas in Brussels today.  Necasâ€™s Cabinet plans to narrow the deficit to 3 percent of
gross domestic product this year, from 3.1 percent in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
