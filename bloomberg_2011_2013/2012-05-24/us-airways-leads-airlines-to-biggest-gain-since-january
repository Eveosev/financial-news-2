US Airways Group Inc. (LCC)  and  United
Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL)  surged as jet-fuel prices remained
near a five-month low and a JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst boosted
his earnings estimates for carriers.  US Airways rose 11 percent to $12.16 at the close in  New
York , leading the  Bloomberg U.S. Airlines Index (BUSAIRL)  of 10 carriers
to a gain of 4.9 percent, the most since October. United
advanced 5.5 percent to $23.53.  Carriers are benefiting from a 40-cent-a-gallon reduction
in  jet-fuel prices  since February, “representing an annualized
$5.5 billion windfall for the industry,”  Jamie Baker , a
JPMorgan analyst in New York, wrote today in a note to clients.
Most analysts haven’t yet worked that into earnings estimates
for this quarter, he said.  Baker increased his second-quarter profit estimates for  US
Airways  by 14 cents a share to $1.52, United by 10 cents to
$1.85 and  Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL)  by 3 cents to 87 cents.  Jet fuel  for immediate purchase in New York Harbor is $2.92
a gallon today, down from a peak this year of $3.39 on Feb. 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
