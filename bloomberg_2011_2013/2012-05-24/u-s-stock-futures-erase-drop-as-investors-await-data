U.S. stocks erased losses as Italian
Prime Minister Mario Monti said Greece is likely to stay in the
euro and a majority of the region’s leaders support issuing a
joint bond, offsetting earlier concern about a Chinese slowdown.  A measure of  financial  shares in the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index gained, while technology and industrial companies
retreated.  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  rose 3.3 percent after the
largest personal-computer maker announced plans to slice its
workforce by 27,000 and reported quarterly sales and earnings
that topped estimates.  Tiffany & Co. (TIF)  tumbled 6.8 percent as the
luxury jewelry retailer cut its profit and sales forecasts.  The S&P 500 rose 0.1 percent to 1,320.68 at 4 p.m.  New York 
time, reversing a loss of 0.6 percent. The index gained for a
fourth day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 33.60 points,
or 0.3 percent, to 12,529.75. The  Nasdaq Composite Index (CCMP)  fell
0.4 percent to 2,839.38. About 6.9 billion shares changed hands
on U.S. exchanges, almost in line with the three-month average.  “The market has come down not necessarily because growth
has slowed so significantly, but because of a potential
disorderly unwind of the euro,” said Dan Veru, who oversees
$3.7 billion as chief investment officer of Palisade Capital
Management LLC in Fort Lee, New Jersey. “ Greece  won’t come out
of the euro. There’s no mechanism in place to do that.”  Equities  reversed  losses as Monti said in an interview on
Italian television station La7 today that “Europe can have euro
bonds soon.” Italy can help push Germany to support the idea of
collective debt and to embrace the “common good” of Europe, he
said. Stocks dropped earlier as three officials said China’s
biggest banks may fall short of loan targets for the first time
in at least seven years amid an economic slowdown.  Economic Data  In the U.S., data showed companies placed fewer orders for
computers, machinery and other capital equipment in April for a
second month. Manufacturing in the U.S. expanded in May at the
slowest pace in three months, indicating the industry that’s
spurred the expansion is cooling.  Concern about a slowdown in global growth and a worsening
of Europe’s debt crisis drove the  S&P 500  down 5.5 percent so
far this month. Financial, energy and technology shares have
tumbled at least 7.7 percent in May.  Hewlett-Packard rose 3.3 percent to $21.77. The 8 percent
workforce reduction, taking place through firings and early
retirement offers, will generate annual savings of as much as
$3.5 billion starting in 2014.  Facebook Inc. (FB)  added 3.2 percent to $33.03, gaining for a
second day. The social networking company is still trading below
its initial public offering price of $38.  Airlines Rally  The  Bloomberg U.S. Airlines Index (BUSAIRL)  climbed 4.9 percent after
JPMorgan Chase & Co. raised industry estimates, citing lower
jet-fuel prices.  Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV)  jumped 4.6 percent, the
biggest gain in the S&P 500, to $8.74.  US Airways Group Inc. (LCC) 
surged 11 percent to $12.16.  Dow Chemical Co. (DOW)  rallied 3.4 percent to $31.55. The
chemical maker said an arbitration panel ruled that Kuwait must
pay $2.16 billion in damages after it canceled a 2008 agreement
to buy a stake in the company’s plastics business.  Pandora Media Inc. (P)  surged 12 percent to $11.60. The
Internet radio pioneer rose the most since its first day of
trading in June 2011 after first-quarter results exceeded
analysts’ estimates on higher mobile advertising sales.  Technology had the biggest decline among 10 groups in the
S&P 500, dropping 0.9 percent.  Apple Inc. (AAPL) , the most valuable
company, lost 0.9 percent to $565.32.  NetApp Tumbles  NetApp Inc. (NTAP)  plunged 12 percent, the most in the S&P 500, to
$28.82. The seller of hardware and software for storing data
forecast first-quarter earnings trailing analysts’ estimates
amid a weak economic outlook.  Tiffany tumbled 6.8 percent to $57.59. Chief Executive
Officer Michael Kowalski said sales in the Americas region
“underperformed, continuing a soft trend that began in the last
quarter of 2011.” Sales in the first quarter rose 3 percent to
$386 million in the Americas and declined 4 percent in the New
York flagship store.  MEMC Electronic Materials Inc. (WFR)  lost 6 percent to $1.58. The
second-largest U.S. maker of polysilicon dropped after S&P cut
its corporate credit  rating  two levels to B+ from BB.  The slump in the S&P 500 may be nearing an end after the
measure dropped below its 150-day average, which may lure buyers
into the market, said Oppenheimer & Co. The gauge slipped 8.7
percent between April 2 and May 18, falling below its average
price from the prior 150 days on May 17 for the first time since
Dec. 19, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  150-Day Average  Oppenheimer’s Carter Worth wrote in a May 21 report that
declines to the 150-day average may prompt pessimists to stop
selling and persuade investors who missed out on the market’s
rally through April to buy.  The S&P 500 is “down to a level where rebound potential is
high and that the right thing to do now is to put some money to
work on the long side,” Worth, the New York-based chief market
technician at Oppenheimer, wrote in the May 21 report. The stock
index rose 1.8 percent this week through yesterday.  Worth highlighted 90 stocks to buy that are down to levels
where “selling pressure is judged likely to abate.” The list
included  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/B) ,  Intel Corp. (INTC) ,  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) 
and  Starbucks Corp. (SBUX)   “If and as these names stop going down (read: stabilize)
and actually start to rebound, one can make inferences about the
current market correction being at an end,” Worth wrote in the
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
