The central bank of  Angola ,  Africa ’s
second-biggest oil producer after  Nigeria , kept its benchmark
interest for a fourth consecutive meeting in a bid to curb price
pressures.  The key lending rate was left at 10.25 percent, according
to a text message distributed by the Luanda-based Banco Nacional
de Angola yesterday. The bank cut the rate for the first time
since introducing it in October, lowering it by a quarter of a
percentage point in January.  Inflation slowed to 10.9 percent in April from 11.1 percent
a month earlier, the statistics office said on May 9. Angola is
targeting inflation of less than 10 percent this year. The
economy will probably expand 8 percent this year as oil
production increases, the  International Monetary Fund  said on
May 17.  The Monetary Policy Committee was formed last year to help
improve financial management after the country secured a loan
from the IMF in 2009. The benchmark rate was set at 10.5 percent
in the committee’s first decision announced on Oct. 28.  The Angolan kwanza gained to 95.3307 to the dollar as of
9:15 p.m. in Luanda yesterday from 95.3350 the day earlier. It
has declined 0.7 percent so far this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
