CTC Media Inc. (CTCM) ’s CTC television
channel regained its rank as the fifth most-watched among
viewers of 18 years and older in the week to May 20 as its
audience share fell at a slower pace than its nearest
competitor’s, according to TNS-Global.  Viewer share for CTC TV, the Nasdaq-listed Russian media
company’s biggest source of revenue, fell to 5.4 percent in the
week to May 20 from 5.5 percent in the previous week, data
researcher TNS-Global said by e-mail today. CTC’s average daily
audience among viewers 4 years old and over fell to 6.2 percent
in the week to May 20, from 6.4 percent in the week to May 13,
the data show.  CTC regained its rank as the fifth most-watched television
channel among viewers of 18 years, pushing REN TV, its nearest
competitor, one notch down. The average daily share of viewers
18 years or older for REN TV fell to 5.2 percent in the week to
May 20 from 6.7 percent in the week to May 13, the data show.
CTC remained in fifth place among viewers 4 years old and over,
TNS-Global said.  Russia’s government-controlled Rossiya 1 was the most
watched among both audience categories, outpacing  Pervyi Kanal 
and pushing it one rank down from last week.  NTV Television  had
the third-biggest audience in both categories, the data show.
TNT was the fourth-most watched channel among viewers in both
categories, the data showed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
