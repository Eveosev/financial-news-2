Canadian Human Resource Minister
Diane Finley announced plans to toughen job search requirements
for frequent claimants of employment insurance in a bid to
ease labour shortages.  The new rules require claimants who have received more than
60 weeks of benefits over the past 5 years to accept a wider
range of jobs than other claimants will. After receiving
benefits for seven weeks, frequent recipients will be required
to accept any work they are qualified to perform, rather than
work similar to their previous employment.  Frequent recipients will also be forced to accept wages as
low as 70 percent of their previous hourly wage after seven
weeks, down from 80 percent at the beginning of the claimant
period. The definition of suitable employment will also take
into account commuting times, personal circumstances such as
health and working conditions.  EI claimants will also be required to search for jobs daily
and keep records of their search.  “As Canada faces unprecedented skills shortages, it will
be critical to better connect Canadians with available jobs in
their local area,” Finley said in a statement.  Frequent claimants make up 16 percent of all claimants,
according to government documents provided to reporters in
Ottawa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
