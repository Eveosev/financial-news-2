New York Giants wide receiver Hakeem Nicks broke a bone in his foot during practice and will be out
of action for about 12 weeks, the team said.  Nicks, the second-leading receiver on the Giants’  Super
Bowl  championship squad last season, fractured the fifth
metatarsal of his right foot while running a route during drills
at the team’s practice facility in East Rutherford, New Jersey,
the Giants said in a news release.  New York opens training camp July 26 at the University of
Albany. It begins defense of its National Football League title
at home against the  Dallas Cowboys  on Sept. 5, which is 15 weeks
from today.  The 24-year-old Nicks caught 76 passes for 1,192 yards and
seven touchdowns last season, second on the team to Victor Cruz
in all three categories.  Nicks led the Giants with 10 catches for 109 yards in the
Super Bowl as New York beat the New England Patriots 21-17.  The Giants waived cornerback Brian Witherspoon, who tore
his anterior cruciate ligament yesterday for the second straight
year. In his place, the team signed defensive back Dante Hughes,
who played the last three seasons for the  San Diego Chargers 
after a two-year stint with the  Indianapolis Colts .  The 26-year-old Hughes, who tried out for the Giants at
rookie minicamp two weeks ago, has started two games during his
NFL career.  To contact the reporter on this story:
