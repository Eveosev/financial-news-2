Vietnam ’s benchmark five-year bonds
rose for the first time in seven days on speculation the central
bank will cut  interest rates  after inflation slowed to the least
since August 2010. The dong weakened.  Consumer prices  climbed 8.34 percent in May from a year
earlier, the General Statistics Office said in Hanoi today. The
median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of seven economists
was for an 8.9 percent increase. Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung
told the central bank to “speed up” reductions in borrowing
costs, the government said on May 9. State Bank of Vietnam
Governor Nguyen Van Binh said in March the monetary authority
would lower rates by 100 basis points in each of the second,
third and fourth quarters.  “SBV is likely to respond to the sharper-than-expected
decline in inflation by cutting rates in the coming two weeks,”
Trinh D. Nguyen, a Hong Kong-based economist for HSBC Holdings
Plc, said in an e-mail.  Five-year bond  yields  fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 9.68 percent, according to a daily fixing
from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong declined 0.1 percent to 20,868 per dollar as of
3:16 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
 State Bank  of Vietnam set its  reference rate  at 20,828,
unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its website. The currency
is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of the rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
