Texas Petroleum Investment Co. had an
oil sheen about three miles (4.8 kilometers) long and 500 feet
wide at its Breton Sound Block 21 platform near Nairn,
Louisiana, according to a filing with the National Response
Center. The sheen may contain heavy oil and the release has not
been secured, the filing showed.  U.S. companies must notify the response center if they
release hazardous substances in excess of reportable quantities,
according to the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund.
