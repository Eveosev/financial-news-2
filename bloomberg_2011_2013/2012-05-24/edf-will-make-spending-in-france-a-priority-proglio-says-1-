Electricite de  France  SA Chief
Executive Officer  Henri Proglio  said spending in France will be
a priority to maintain nuclear reactors and keep them safe.  EDF’s role is one of “big public service,” Proglio told
shareholders at an annual meeting in Paris. The utility will
develop industry in France and hire and train young people, he
said.  The state-controlled utility operates the country’s 58
nuclear reactors and is developing a new one in Normandy. The
generators provide more than three quarters of the country’s
power output. France’s reliance on nuclear power from EDF was
the subject of debate during the recent presidential election
won May 6 by Socialist Francois Hollande, who pledged to lower
this dependence.  Spending on French nuclear plants will at least double to
3.4 billion euros ($4.3 billion) to 3.6 billion euros in 2015
from 1.7 billion euros in 2010, the company said in February.  EDF also needs to move more quickly into international
markets by selling atomic reactors and renewable energy abroad
to countries like  China , Proglio said today. Development in
Italy, Poland and the U.K. will also come, he said.  The utility finalized a plan to take control of Italian
utility  Edison SpA (EDN)  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
