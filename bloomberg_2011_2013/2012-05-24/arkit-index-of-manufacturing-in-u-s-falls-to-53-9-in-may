The Markit Economics final index of
U.S. manufacturing decreased to 54 in May from 56 in April, the
London-based group said today.  A reading above 50 in the purchasing managers’ measure
indicates expansion. The final figure, based on a survey of more
than 600 companies, compares with an initial reading of 53.9
released on May 24.  The Markit gauge of U.S. manufacturing was released last
month for the first time. The company surveys purchasing
managers in more than 30 countries and regions, including Europe
and  China . Its  euro-area manufacturing  index fell in May to
45.1, the lowest since mid-2009, from 45.9 in April. China’s
factory gauge dropped to 48.4 from 49.3 in April.  A report earlier today from the U.S. Labor Department
showed that payrolls expanded by 69,000 in May, less than the
most pessimistic forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of
economists, after a revised 77,000 gain that was smaller than
initially estimated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
