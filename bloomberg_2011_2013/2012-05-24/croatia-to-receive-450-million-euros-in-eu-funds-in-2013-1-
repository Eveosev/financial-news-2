Croatia  will receive 450 million
euros ($565 million) in funds from the European Union in the
second half of 2013 and 1.1 billion euros in 2014, Deputy
Premier Branko Grcic said.  The Adriatic Sea nation, which expect to join the bloc in
July 2013, will use the funds for infrastructure and environment
projects, Grcic told reporters in Zagreb today.  “Meanwhile, we will do our best to strengthen our
capacities and mechanisms for the absorption” of funds, Grcic
said, adding that in 2011 Croatia utilized only 37 percent of
the funds available made available to it by the 27-member bloc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
