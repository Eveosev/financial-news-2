(Corrects to remove “Battleship” 3-D reference in fifth
paragraph of story published yesterday.)  Viacom Inc. (VIAB) ’s Paramount Pictures
delayed the release of its summer action-adventure film “G.I.
Joe: Retaliation” by nine months to convert the sequel to 3-D.  The film, originally scheduled for June 29, will reach
theaters on March 29, 2013, the studio and partner  Hasbro Inc. (HAS) ,
owner of the G.I. Joe toy line, said today in a statement.  Showing the film in 3-D will enable the filmmakers to tap
into global demand for big-budget action films shown in the
format, according to the statement. Cinema operators typically
charge about $3 per 3-D ticket in the U.S.  “G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,” released in 2009, cost
about $175 million to make and took in $302.5 million in
worldwide ticket sales, according to researcher Box Office Mojo.
The new film, about a special military force that takes on the
toughest missions, stars  Dwayne Johnson , Channing Tatum and
Bruce Willis.  The schedule change comes less than a week after
“Battleship,” based on the Hasbro board game, opened with
$25.5 million in ticket sales, missing the $38.7 million
forecast of Box Office Mojo. “Battleship” may lose as much as
$150 million for  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s Universal Pictures, Wunderlich
Securities analyst Matthew Harrigan said in an e-mail on May 20.  Other Hasbro properties being developed as movies include
Risk, Ouija board and Clue, according to researcher Imdb.com.  Hasbro rose less than 1 percent to $34.65 at the close in
 New York  trading and has gained 8.7 percent this year. Viacom
also rose less than 1 percent to $47.21. It has increased 4
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
