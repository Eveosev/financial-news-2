Serbian President-elect  Tomislav Nikolic  pledged to work fast to form a new government while
leading Serbia to European Union membership.  Nikolic favors the “quick formation” of a new government
which can tackle crime and corruption and support job creation,
his Progressive Party said in an e-mailed statement today after
he met with Miroslav Lajcak, the Slovak foreign minister and
special envoy of European Union Foreign Policy Chief  Catherine Ashton . He will also insist “on Serbia’s continued European
path,” according to the statement.  Nikolic’s victory over President  Boris Tadic  in the May 20
presidential runoff has deepened the former Yugoslav republic’s
political stalemate. The president, whose powers are largely
ceremonial and who has little influence on economic policy, may
find it difficult to name a candidate for prime minister who can
secure a parliamentary majority. Both Nikolic’s Progressives and
Tadic’s  Democratic Party  lack a majority.  The stalemate has weighed on the dinar, which has extended
this week’s declines to a record low of 116.119 to the euro. The
main  index  of the 15 most-actively traded assets dropped 0.9
percent to a three-year low of 452.45 points.  To contact the reporters on this story:
