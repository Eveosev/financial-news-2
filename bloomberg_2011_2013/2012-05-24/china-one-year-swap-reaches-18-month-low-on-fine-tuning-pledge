China ’s one-year interest-rate swap
tumbled to an 18-month low after a pledge by authorities to
boost growth spurred speculation monetary policy will be eased.  Asia ’s largest economy “must intensify precautionary
adjustment and fine-tuning of policies,” the government said on
its website yesterday, summarizing a meeting of the State
Council, or Cabinet. The seven-day  repurchase rate , which
measures interbank funding availability, declined for a second
day even after the central bank drained 78 billion  yuan  ($12.3
billion) of capital from the financial system this week.  “The State Council’s comments signal the government will
further ease monetary policy,” said Chen Qi, co-head of fixed-
income research at UBS Securities Co. in Shanghai. “Worries
about the European debt crisis have prompted investors to cut
risky assets, which helps bring down  interest-rate swaps .”  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, declined nine
basis points to 2.60 percent as of 10:22 a.m. in Shanghai,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 2.58 percent,
the lowest level since November 2010.  The central bank issued 30 billion yuan of 91-day
repurchase contracts today, according to a statement on its
website.  The seven-day  repo  dropped 20 basis points, or 0.20
percentage point, to 2.24 percent, according to a weighted
average rate compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center.
The yield on the 3.14 percent government bond due February 2017
dropped seven basis points to 2.71 percent, according to the
Interbank Funding Center.  -- Judy Chen . Editors: Andrew Janes, Ven Ram  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
