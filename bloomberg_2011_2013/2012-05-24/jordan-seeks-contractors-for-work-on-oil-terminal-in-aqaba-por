Jordan invited contractors to apply
to prequalify as bidders for engineering, procurement and
construction work on an  oil terminal  in the port of Aqaba, the
Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources said.  The facility, with a planned capacity of 120,000 cubic
meters, is to be built in the southern city for the storage and
distribution of imported crude and oil products, the ministry
said today in a statement on its website. Contractors must
submit prequalification documents by June 21, it said.  Jordan, one of the smallest economies in the  Middle East ,
imports almost all of its energy. Its power plants have been
forced to switch over to more expensive fuels after repeated
cuts in natural-gas shipments caused by sabotage attacks on an
export pipeline from neighboring  Egypt .  To contact the reporter on this story:
