The U.S. Supreme Court limited the
ability of home buyers to sue mortgage lenders for overcharges
at settlement in a victory for the real-estate and banking
industries.  The justices unanimously threw out a suit by a group of
Louisiana consumers against Quicken Loans Inc. over fees they
paid at their mortgage settlements.  The home buyers said Quicken charged as much as $1,100 in
“loan discount fees” without providing the interest-rate
reduction those fees typically bring. Quicken said the borrowers
received lower rates in exchange for the fees.  The fight centered on a provision in the 1974 Real Estate
Settlement Procedures Act that bars lenders in at least some
cases from collecting money for settlement services they didn’t
perform.  The  high court  today said that provision applies only when
the settlement-service provider splits the fee with another
entity.  The Obama administration sided with the Louisiana consumers
at the high court, while the banking and real estate industries
backed Quicken. Lower courts had been divided on the reach of
the 1974 law.  The case is Freeman v. Quicken, 10-1042.  To contact the reporter on this story:
