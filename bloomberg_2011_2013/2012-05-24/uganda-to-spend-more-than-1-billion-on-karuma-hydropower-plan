Uganda will spend more than $1
billion on the Karuma Hydropower Project, the countryâ€™s
presidency said.  The East African nation also plans to spend at least $13
billion on infrastructure over the next five years, according to
an e-mail from the office of President  Yoweri Museveni .  Construction of the 600-megawatt Karuma plant on the Nile
River in the northwest of the country is expected to start later
this year, according to the Energy Ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
