New York  Giants cornerback Brian Witherspoon suffered a recurrence of the knee injury that kept
him sidelined for the last National Football League season.  Witherspoon, 26, hurt his anterior cruciate ligament during
the Super Bowl champions’ first offseason gathering and had to
be carted off the field.  “I’m afraid it was an ACL again,” coach  Tom Coughlin  told
reporters yesterday.  Witherspoon sat out the 2011 season after tearing his ACL
in a preseason game against the Chicago Bears. Cornerback
Terrell Thomas suffered the same injury in that game and isn’t
expected to rejoin the Giants until training camp.  “It was tough to see him go down,” Thomas said. “I’m in
no rush. I’m ahead of schedule and I’m going to do what I can
and going to keep pushing it, but I’m not going to rush it.”  Also last season, rookie cornerback Prince Amukamara needed
surgery to repair a fractured bone in his left foot and
cornerback  Bruce Johnson  ruptured his Achilles tendon on Aug. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
