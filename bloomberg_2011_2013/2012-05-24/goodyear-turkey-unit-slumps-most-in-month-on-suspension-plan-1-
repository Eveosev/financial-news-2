Goodyear Lastikleri TAS (GOODY) , the Turkish
unit of Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., plunged the most in almost a
month after saying it will suspend production at its two plants
to stop an inventory build-up caused by a contraction in demand
as a result of global economic conditions.  Goodyear Lastikleri fell 8.4 percent to 54.25 liras at the
close in Istanbul, in the biggest decrease since April 26.  The company will halt operations from May 31 through June
21 at its Adapazari plant and from June 12 through June 21 at
its Izmit plant in northwestern Turkey, it said in a statement
to the  Istanbul Stock Exchange  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
