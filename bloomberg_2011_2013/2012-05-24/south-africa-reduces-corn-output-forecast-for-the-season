South Africa , the continent’s biggest
corn producer, reduced its forecast for production this season
by 0.6 percent as dry weather curbs output and a provincial
survey showed yields are less than first thought.  The country may reap 11.06 million metric tons of corn,
Rona Beukes, a senior statistician in the agriculture
department, said by phone from  Pretoria  today. That compares
with the April 24 forecast of 11.1 million tons, and a median
estimate of 10.95 million tons by eight analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News. The estimate for white corn, the nation’s staple
food, was cut 0.9 percent to 6.4 million tons. The forecast for
the yellow variety was little changed at 4.7 million tons.  “The impact of dry weather continues and objective yields
for the North West province were lower than estimated,” Beukes
said, referring to a manual survey farmers undertake of fields.  The nation produced 10.4 million tons of corn last year.
Corn stocks declined to the lowest level in 12 years in April as
a government-backed plan to export a surplus of the grain helped
the country ship the most last season since the 2003-04 period,
the Pretoria-based South African Grain Information Service said
yesterday. Exports of yellow and white corn rose 18 percent in
the season ended April 27, the largest amount shipped in at
least nine years, Sagis said on May 2.  White corn for July delivery, the most active contract,
fell 0.7 percent to 2,025 rand ($244) a ton. Yellow corn for
delivery in July retreated 0.2 percent to 2,000 rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
