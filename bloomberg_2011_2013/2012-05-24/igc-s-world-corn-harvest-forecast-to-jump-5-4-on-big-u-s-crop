World corn production will jump 5.4
percent in the 2012-13 crop year, more than predicted a month
ago, on a “huge” U.S. corn harvest, the International Grains
Council forecast. The outlook for wheat output was cut.  Farmers across the world will harvest 913 million metric
tons of corn in the year through June 2013 up from 866.1 million
tons a year earlier, the London-based IGC wrote in an e-mailed
report today, 12.7 million tons above its April 26 outlook.  Corn futures on the  Chicago  Board of Trade have dropped 6.2
percent this year on expectations for a bigger crop in the U.S.,
the world’s biggest grower and shipper of the grain. Corn stocks
are expected to climb to a three-year high, IGC data show.  “Early seeding has reinforced expectations for a huge U.S.
harvest,” the IGC wrote. “World stocks are projected to
increase to their highest in three years, almost entirely
attributable to the U.S.”  World corn stocks at the end of June 2013 may increase by
12 million tons year-on-year to 141 million tons, the council
said. U.S. corn production is forecast to climb 13 percent to
355 million tons, based on a “significant rise” in harvested
area and yields matching the 10-year trend, according to the
IGC.  “Compared to 2011-12, world availabilities are expected to
be more comfortable and maize could replace some wheat in
livestock feed rations,” the council wrote, using another name
for corn.  World wheat production will decline 3.5 percent in the
2012-13 crop year, more than the drop predicted last month as
poor conditions weighed on prospects in  Russia ,  Morocco  and the
European Union, according to the IGC.  Wheat Harvest Lowered  Farmers will harvest 670.5 million metric tons of wheat in
the year through June 2013, down from a record 694.8 million
tons a year earlier and 5.6 million tons lower than the group’s
previous forecast.  Wheat futures jumped 16 percent in Chicago last week, the
biggest weekly gain since June 2007 on the lack of rain. The
U.S. will be the world’s largest exporter of wheat in the
current 2011-12 season followed by Australia and Russia,
according to data from the council.  Wheat use will exceed production in the next marketing
year, cutting stockpiles at the end of June 2013, the IGC
forecast. The outlook for wheat stockpiles was cut by 15 million
tons to 191 million tons from last month, and down from 202
million in 2011-12. Global wheat trade may slip to 136 million
tons from 143 million tons last year, according to the IGC.  Total production of wheat and coarse grains will increase
to 1.87 billion tons in 2012-13 from 1.84 billion tons, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
