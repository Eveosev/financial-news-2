The thousands of Europeans who
descended on  Azerbaijan  this week for tomorrow’s finals of the
 Eurovision Song Contest  are likely to suffer from one of two
common caricatures of the host country.  Those who know Azerbaijan mainly from elegant commercials
on CNN will see in the capital, Baku, a city booming on the
fruits of oil wealth and graced with a stunning promenade along
a turquoise sea. Common men fish from yachts, and angelic
beauties stroll through the mysterious old city.  Those who follow international news will expect to see an
authoritarian country in which civil society cowers in the
shadows,  journalists are imprisoned , and the economy is sinking
into an oil trap of corruption and inflation rates of more than
7 percent.  Like good jokes, though, caricatures contain both truth and
exaggeration, and those surrounding Azerbaijan are no exception.  The country’s record on democracy and human rights is
troubling. During my tenure as U.S. ambassador in Baku until
January, I spent more time on these issues than on any other. I
also saw firsthand the value of the Euro-Atlantic community
pulling together on the levers they have, both behind the scenes
and prudently in public, to bring about positive change.  Unexpectedly, Eurovision 2012 has provided an extra lever.
Azerbaijanis collectively felt a rare rush of pride a year ago,
when two of their compatriots  won  Eurovision 2011, and so gave
the country the right to host the next event. They felt that for
the first time, European society had metaphorically put its arm
around the shoulders of this nation of 9 million in the Caucasus
to say: “Maybe there really is a bit of European civilization in
you; we’ll come and see for ourselves next year.”  Brutish Mistakes  Azerbaijan’s leaders recognized that hosting the pop-music
contest, an annual kitsch fest watched on TV by an estimated 125
million people, provided an unprecedented opportunity to
showcase Azerbaijan as a modern and sophisticated country that
merits genuine partnership with  Europe . In its zeal to seize
this opportunity, though, the authorities made mistakes. Those
included brutishly exercising eminent domain to demolish
apartments to make way for a road to the  Crystal Hall , the new
stadium that was built to stage this year’s pop extravaganza.  But the government at the same time freed two of the
country’s highest-profile prisoners: journalist  Eynulla
Fatullayev  and protest organizer  Jabbar Savalan . And, just a few
weeks ago, with Eurovision looming on the near horizon, Baku’s
local authorities permitted a large-scale public protest for the
first time in several years. These were steps that the Euro-
Atlantic community’s diplomats had long and vigorously sought.  Human-rights activists also understood that Eurovision
offered an opportunity to highlight Azerbaijan’s failings. They
argue that the gestures the government has made by releasing
some political prisoners don’t go far enough. They say all those
detained in connection with Arab Spring-inspired protests last
year should be released, and that the government should not be
rewarded for correcting mistakes it never should have made in
the first place.  We need to keep pressing Azerbaijan to do more. But my own
experience also suggests there is utility in recognizing
progress on human rights when it happens. Failing to do so risks
signaling, falsely, that we in the West are insatiable critics
with hidden agendas. When that happens, it undermines our
credibility and leverage with the people we seek to influence.  Strategic Interests  The tendency of many Western observers to expect Azerbaijan
to fail on human rights reflects an image of the country as too
corrupt, too undemocratic and too broken to be taken seriously.
But that’s a crude understanding that risks leading the U.S. to
forgo opportunities to advance human rights in Azerbaijan, as
well as other U.S. strategic interests.  Azerbaijan’s small size shouldn’t obscure its significance.
It is the only country that borders both  Iran  and  Russia , and is
rich in gas and oil that Europe needs. It has a secular state
and a majority-Shiite population, with traditions of religious
diversity and tolerance. The government recently built the
Jewish Ashkenazi community’s main synagogue in the capital,
following its earlier construction of the Roman Catholic
community’s primary church.  Azerbaijan has taken these steps despite severe tension
with Iran, which seeks to destabilize its secular neighbor: An
Iranian legislator and religious organizations in Iran recently
accused the Azeri government of planning a gay pride parade
during Eurovision, which the Iranians claimed would be an insult
to Muslims everywhere. Officials in Tehran fear that
Azerbaijan’s success as a prosperous, pro-Western state risks
animating Iran’s citizens with similar ambitions.  Azerbaijan nevertheless refuses to be intimidated into
softening its alignment with the U.S. and its closest allies.
Instead, Azerbaijan has decided to tie its survival as an
independent state to its physical connection to the Euro-
Atlantic community through  oil and gas pipelines . More than one-
third of all nonlethal supplies destined for U.S. and coalition
military forces in  Afghanistan  pass through the port of Baku.  Azerbaijan’s record on economic reform has been
significantly better than is portrayed in the Western media. The
country hasn’t behaved like  Nigeria  and many other petro-states.
Economic reformers have followed prudent fiscal and monetary
policies, and established a well-managed sovereign  wealth fund 
modeled on  Norway ’s. And despite the corruption that permeates
Azerbaijan’s society, government reformers invested much of the
country’s energy revenue in an anti-poverty program that helped
reduce the  poverty rate  from 49 percent to 9.1 percent from 2003
to 2009 (16 percent, according to the  World Bank ).  Azerbaijan is not a caricature. It is a young country eager
to prove its reliability as a friend of the U.S. and its allies,
whether on  energy security , transportation to and from
Afghanistan, or containing Islamist radicalism. Our challenge is
to elicit an equally strong partnership on internal reforms.
Azerbaijan’s being allowed to host Eurovision 2012 isn’t proof
of Western failure to hold the government to account. It
provides us with leverage to elicit further progress on critical
changes, and we should use it as well as we can.  (Matthew Bryza is a former U.S. ambassador to Azerbaijan,
