The European Union will import 97,000
metric tons of sugar at a reduced duty under the second of three
planned tenders to ease shortages in the market.  The EU accepted bids to import 95,000 tons of raw sugar for
refining at a minimum import duty of 306 euros ($384) a ton and
2,000 tons of white, or refined, sugar at a minimum duty of 340
euros a ton, the European Commission, the blocâ€™s executive arm,
said in a statement e-mailed today. The duty charged to import
raw sugar is usually 339 euros a ton, while imports of the white
variety incur a levy of 419 euros a ton.  The EU took measures to ease a shortage after consumers
complained. Food manufacturing in the region has been disrupted
by a lack of sweetener, according to the Committee of European
Sugar Users, a Brussels-based industry group which represents
companies including  Kraft Foods Inc. (KFT)   The bloc authorized imports of 65,834 tons of sugar in the
first tender that took place on May 3. The next one is scheduled
for June 6. The 27-nation bloc also allowed local producers to
sell an additional 250,000 tons of the sweetener in the domestic
market. Under EU rules, producers can sell a limited amount
locally. The rest has to be exported or put to non-food use.  White sugar prices in the EU averaged 711 euros a ton in
March, the highest level since at least July 2006, the
commission said in a report published on its website on May 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
