Alex Rodriguez  hit two home runs as
the  New York  Yankees beat the Kansas City Royals 8-3.  Curtis Granderson  hit a solo home run and Rodriguez had a
two-run homer in the first inning of the Major League Baseball
game last night at Yankee Stadium. That snapped a stretch of 52
at-bats without a home run for Rodriguez, who has 636 homers to
rank fifth on the career list.  After Derek Jeter scored when Mark Teixeira grounded into a
double play in the third, Rodriguez added his second homer to
put New York up 5-0.  Bill Butler and Mitch Maier hit home runs in the fourth and
fifth innings for  Kansas City  to narrow the deficit.  In the bottom of the fifth, Jayson Nix scored on Teixeira’s
bases-loaded walk, Granderson scored when Robinson Cano grounded
into a fielder’s choice and Teixeira came home on Andruw Jones’s
bases-loaded walk.  Eric Hosmer wrapped up the scoring in the ninth with a run-
scoring double for the Royals.  The Yankees (23-21) are in fourth place in the five-team
American League East, 4 1/2 games behind the Baltimore Orioles
(28-17), who lost 6-5 to the fifth-place Boston Red Sox (22-22).  Andy Pettitte (2-1) got his second win since coming out of
retirement, allowing two runs on seven hits while striking out
eight in seven innings.  Will Smith  (0-1) took the loss, surrendering five runs on
six hits in 3 1/3 innings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
