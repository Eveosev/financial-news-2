Formula One Licensing BV won a
challenge that sought to overturn another company’s European
Union-wide trademark for the term “F 1.”  The  European Court  of Justice, the 27-nation EU’s highest
tribunal, rejected earlier decisions to award the EU trademark
to Racing-Live, a motor sports website based in Montpellier,
 France .  The EU’s trademark office and an EU appeals court “failed
to acknowledge, in relation to trademarks, the distinctive
character of the ‘F1’ sign” and shouldn’t challenge the
validity of trademarks awarded by the EU’s member states, the
Luxembourg-based tribunal said in a statement today.  The group in charge of licensing for Formula One, the
world’s most-watched motor sport, in 2005 appealed the French
company’s application and had won the EU trademark agency’s
backing that such a trademark would be confused with the group’s
existing F1 trademarks. The agency overturned that ruling in
2008. Formula One lost an initial challenge to the EU’s General
Court last year.  Formula One Licensing didn’t immediately respond to an e-
mail seeking comment.  Today’s ruling asks the EU’s General Court to re-examine
the case.  The case is:  C-196/11 P  Formula One Licensing BV v Office
for the Harmonisation of the Internal Market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
