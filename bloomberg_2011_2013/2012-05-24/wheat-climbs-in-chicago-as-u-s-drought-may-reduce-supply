Wheat rose in  Chicago  on indications
yields in the U.S., the largest exporter, are falling as  Kansas 
heads for the driest May on record, raising supply concerns.  This week’s harvest in Kansas, the largest U.S. winter-
wheat grower, “gained momentum” yesterday as temperatures
topped 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius), industry
group Kansas Wheat said. Near the Stafford area one field
yielded 29 bushels an acre, according to the group. The state
produced an average of 35 bushels an acre last year, according
to government data.  July-delivery wheat added as much as 1.2 percent to $6.7375
a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and traded at $6.7275 by
1:55 p.m. Paris time. Milling wheat for November delivery traded
on NYSE Liffe in the French capital added 0.6 percent to 213.25
euros ($267.93) a metric ton.  “Northern Hemisphere weather concerns will be very
supportive of the market,” Simon Clancy, director for brokerage
services at Advance Trading Australasia Pty Ltd., said by phone
from Sydney today.  The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  may cut its global
production  forecast  for 2012-2013 to 669.15 million tons in its
June 12 report, from 677.56 million tons this month, as dry
conditions in the U.S.,  Australia  and Russia parch crops,
according to a Bloomberg survey. That would be the biggest
decline in a June report since 2003.  Corn for July delivery rose as much as 0.9 percent to $6.09
a bushel in Chicago, before trading at $6.0825. Soybeans for
July delivery increased as much as 1.5 percent to $13.825 a
bushel and were at $13.77 recently.  To contact the reporter on this story:
