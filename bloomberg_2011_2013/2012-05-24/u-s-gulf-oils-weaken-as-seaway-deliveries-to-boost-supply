Gulf Coast  crude oil grades weakened
against benchmark West Texas Intermediate as deliveries from the
Seaway pipeline bring more supply to refiners in the region.  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  and  Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD)  reversed
the flow of the 150,000 barrel-a-day Seaway pipeline and started
shipping oil out of the Cushing, Oklahoma, hub to the Gulf Coast
on May 19.  “The crudes are really more under pressure from Seaway
starting up and delivering more to the Gulf,” said  Andy Lipow ,
president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI dipped $3.50 to
$11.50 a barrel at 2:02 p.m.  New York  time, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the lowest level since January.
Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium dropped $2.75 cents to $10.  Mars Blend’s premium narrowed 90 cents to $9.10. Poseidon’s
premium fell 60 cents to $8, while Southern Green Canyon’s held
at $9. The three grades are used in the Argus Sour Crude Index.
 Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower sulfur content than the
other three, fell $2.90 against WTI to a premium of $10.50.  Western Canada Select’s discount to WTI was unchanged at
$16.25 a barrel. Syncrude’s premium was steady at $1.90 and
Bakken oil’s discount was unchanged at $2.  Transit time on the Seaway line from Cushing to Houston is
about 12 days,  Rick Rainey , a Houston-based spokesman for
Enterprise, said May 14. That will be reduced to five days after
the pipe’s capacity is boosted to about 400,000 barrels early
next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
