Citigroup Inc. (C)  sold a 10.1 percent
stake in Turkey’s  Akbank TAS (AKBNK)  for about $1.15 billion as the
third-largest U.S. bank by assets boosts capital.  The New York-based bank placed 404 million shares in Akbank
owned by Citigroup Overseas Investment Corp. to investors at
5.24 liras apiece, according to a statement today. Akbank
dropped 0.7 percent to 5.80 liras in Istanbul trading yesterday,
a fourth straight decline. The shares peaked at 9.70 liras in
October 2010.  Citigroup is Akbank’s second-biggest shareholder after
buying a 20 percent stake from  Haci Omer Sabanci Holding AS (SAHOL)  in
2007 for $3.1 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The U.S. lender is cutting its holding in  Turkey ’s second-
biggest listed bank by market value as it sells assets around
the world to meet capital requirements. It said in March it
would reduce its shareholding in Akbank subject to market
conditions and approvals.  “The bank has been a notable underperformer this year,
primarily because Citi announced their intention of selling off
their 20 percent stake,” said Julian Rimmer, a trader at CF
Global Trading U.K. in  London . “They are only selling half and
there is a lock-up, which should offer some comfort to
investors.”  As part of the sale, Citigroup will keep its remaining 9.9
percent stake in the Istanbul-based bank for three years, a term
sheet of the sale the sale obtained by Bloomberg News showed
yesterday. The transaction will result in an after-tax loss of
about $243 million in the second quarter, Citigroup said in
today’s statement.  Akbank shares have dropped 3.7 percent this year, compared
with a 7.1 percent gain for the  Istanbul Stock Exchange National
100 Index. (XU100)   To contact the reporters on this story:
