A group that backs  Mali ’s military
junta said it wants coup leader Captain Amadou Sanogo to head a
transitional government after the country’s interim president
was injured by protesters demanding his resignation.  “He will be informed of his appointment as president by
the national convention and he will be invested on Friday,”
Mohamed Taboure, spokesman for the National Convention for the
Coordination of Malian Patriotic Organizations, known by its
French acronym Copam, told reporters yesterday in Bamako, the
capital.  Interim President Dioncounda Traore was flown out of the
country yesterday to receive treatment in  France  for injuries he
sustained when protesters stormed his office on May 21 to demand
he step down. The demonstration came a day after a deal was
reached between Sanogo and the Economic Community of West
African States under which the army captain would step down,
while Traore’s position as head of the transitional government
was extended from 40 days to one year.  Mali, which ranks alongside Tanzania as  Africa ’s third-
biggest gold producer, has been in political crisis since March
22, when soldiers ousted President Amadou Toure amid discontent
about the resources the government was dedicating to fight
Touareg rebels in the nation’s northern region. The insurgents
took advantage of the political instability to declare
independence in the north on April 6.  “A new government will be established with a mission to
recover the integrity of the territory and organize free and
transparent elections,” Taboure said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
