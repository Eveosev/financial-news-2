A  Pennsylvania  judge approved the
appointment of William B. Lynch, a retired U.S. Air Force major
general, as receiver for Harrisburg, the state’s capital.  Lynch replaces David Unkovic, who resigned March 30 citing
“political and ethical crosswinds.” Commonwealth Court Judge
Bonnie Leadbetter said today she expects Lynch to be independent
from state officials and to have control over his own budget,
which is provided partly by the office of Governor Tom Corbett.  “He impressed me with the personal qualities that we need
to handle this very, very difficult situation,” Leadbetter said
at a court hearing in Harrisburg.  Before Unkovic resigned, he proposed selling or leasing
city assets, including a trash-to-energy plant that doesn’t
generate enough revenue to cover more than $300 million in debt.
Elected officials in Harrisburg disagreed over Unkovic’s plan to
end the insolvent city’s financial crisis.  In March, the city of 49,500 announced it would miss
$5.27 million in bond payments. It earlier defaulted on payments
it guaranteed on the waste-to-energy incinerator.  Lynch was appointed under a state law that allows a
receiver to prepare and implement a fiscal recovery plan.  The receiver case is TD Bank NA v. Harrisburg Authority,
2010-CV-11737, Court of Common Pleas, Dauphin County,
Pennsylvania (Harrisburg).  To contact the reporter on this story:
