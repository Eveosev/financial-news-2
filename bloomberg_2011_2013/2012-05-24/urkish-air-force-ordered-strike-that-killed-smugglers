Turkish  air force  commanders ordered
a December strike in the southeast that killed 34 smugglers
mistaken for members of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK,
Interior Minister Idris Naim Sahin said.  Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan , Chief of General Staff
Necdet Ozel and the interior minister can’t be involved in snap
decisions along Turkey’s borders which are made according to the
chain of command, Sahin told NTV news channel yesterday.  Turkey doesn’t need to apologize for the killings of
civilians because there is a history of PKK members crossing the
border from Iraq with heavy weaponry to attack border patrols,
Sahin said. He also said that smugglers get their goods from the
PKK and send proceeds to a PKK-linked group.  The PKK, listed as a terrorist organization by  Turkey , the
U.S. and the European Union, has been fighting for autonomy in
the largely Kurdish southeast since 1984 in a conflict that has
claimed more than 40,000 lives.  To contact the reporter on this story:
