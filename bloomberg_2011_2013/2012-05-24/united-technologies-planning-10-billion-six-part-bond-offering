United Technologies Corp. (UTX)  sold $9.8
billion of debt in the largest U.S. corporate bond issue in more
than three years to help finance its $16.5 billion acquisition
of  Goodrich Corp. (GR)   The maker of Sikorsky helicopters and Pratt & Whitney
engines, which last tapped the market more than two years ago,
sold three of the offering’s six portions at its lowest coupons
on record, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company
sold floating-rate debt that included $1 billion of 18-month
notes yielding 27 basis points more than the London interbank
offered rate, and $500 million of three-year notes yielding 50
basis points more than Libor.  United Technologies, with investment-grade  ratings  from
Moody’s Investors Service and  Standard & Poor’s , is seeking to
lure bond buyers as turmoil in  Europe  sends them to safer
assets. While speculative-grade bonds in the U.S. have declined
1.3 percent this month, investment grade is unchanged, according
to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data.  “People are holding their breath” over rising speculation
that  Greece  will leave Europe’s common currency, setting off a
financial contagion, Mark Pibl, head of credit strategy at
broker-dealer Cortview Capital Securities LLC, said in a
telephone interview. “That’s partially why people are jumping
in here.”  Record-Low Coupons  United Technologies also sold $1 billion of 1.2 percent,
three-year notes to yield 80 basis points more than similar-
maturity Treasuries; $1.5 billion of 1.8 percent, five-year debt
at a 105 basis-point spread; $2.3 billion of 3.1 percent, 10-
year securities at a spread of 135; and $3.5 billion of 4.5
percent, 30-year bonds at 173 basis points more than Treasuries,
the data show.  The five-, seven- and 10-year coupons are the lowest on
record for the company, falling below the 4.375 percent it paid
for five-year bonds in April 2005, 4.5 percent on 10-year debt
in February 2010 and 5.4 percent on 30-year notes in April 2005,
Bloomberg data show.  Proceeds from the sale will be used to help fund the
aerospace and building-system company’s acquisition of
 Charlotte , North Carolina-based Goodrich, which is expected to
close by mid-year, and for general corporate purposes, United
Technologies said today in a filing.  The sale, which was managed by Bank of America Corp., HSBC
Holdings Plc and JPMorgan Chase & Co., was the largest in
dollars since March 2009, when  Pfizer Inc. (PFE)  sold $13.5 billion of
bonds in a five-part offering, the data show. The bonds are
expected to be rated A2 by Moody’s and A by S&P, both the sixth
level of investment grade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
