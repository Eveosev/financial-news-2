The Philippine peso slumped to a
four-month low and bonds fell as the risk of a Greek exit from
the euro prompted funds to dump emerging-market assets.  European leaders meeting in Brussels clashed over joint
debt sales as they called on Greece to stick with the budget
cuts needed to stay in the euro. Brazil auctioned currency swap
contracts yesterday and Mexico sold dollars for the first time
since 2009, joining  emerging markets  like India in propping up
exchange rates.  “The uncertainty in  Europe  has a very high likelihood of
persisting until June,” said Emilio Neri, an economist at  Bank
of the Philippine Islands (BPI)  in Manila. “Investors are
reallocating their assets to safer outlets. No matter how strong
our economic fundamentals are, we should not be surprised if we
see a regionwide decline in currencies and equity markets.”  The peso slid 0.7 percent to 43.74 per dollar as of 3:58
p.m. in Manila, the lowest since Jan. 16, prices from Tullett
Prebon Plc show. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, fell 25 basis points
to 6.75 percent.  The yield on 5.75 percent government bonds due November
2021 rose three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 5.55
percent, according to Tradition Financial Services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
