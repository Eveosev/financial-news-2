The following is the text of
Canada’s employment insurance report for March released
by  Statistics Canada .  The number of people receiving regular Employment Insurance
(EI) benefits was little changed in March at 549,400. The number
of beneficiaries has been relatively stable since September 2011.  There were more people receiving benefits in March in Nova
Scotia, Saskatchewan, Ontario and  New Brunswick . At the same
time, the number of beneficiaries decreased in  Alberta .  Claims unchanged in March  To receive EI benefits, individuals must first submit a
claim. The number of claims provides an indication of the number
of people who could become beneficiaries.  Nationally, the number of initial and renewal claims
totalled 234,200 in March, essentially unchanged for the sixth
consecutive month. Provincially, claims fell 2.9% in Ontario,
2.6% in British Columbia, and 1.7% in Alberta, while they
increased 2.6% in Quebec and 1.1% in New Brunswick. There was
little change in all other provinces.  Provincial summary  There were more people receiving regular EI benefits in
March in  Nova Scotia  (+5.4%), Saskatchewan (+3.4%), Ontario
(+2.1%), and New Brunswick (+1.4%). These gains offset declines
observed in February in those four provinces.  In Alberta, the number of beneficiaries continued on a
long-term downward trend, with a 2.9% decline in March. There
was little change in the other provinces.  Year-over-year declines continue in most large centres  EI data by sub-provincial region are not seasonally
adjusted and are therefore compared on a year-over-year basis.  Between March 2011 and March 2012, 132 of the 143 large
centres posted declines in the number of people receiving
regular benefits. Large centres are those with a population of
10,000 or more.  In Newfoundland and Labrador, the number of people
receiving benefits declined in all five large centres. In
 St.·John’s , the number fell 17.6% in the 12 months to March to
4,600. It was the largest percentage decrease in the province
and the biggest percentage decline since March 2010, when the
downward monthly year-over-year trend for St.·John’s began.  Both large centres in Prince  Edward Island  had fewer
beneficiaries in March. The largest percentage decline occurred
in Charlottetown, where the number of people receiving benefits
fell 16.7%, the ninth consecutive month of year-over-year
declines.  In Nova Scotia, four of the five large centres had fewer
beneficiaries compared with 12 months earlier. In Halifax, the
number of beneficiaries fell 3.9% to 6,400, continuing the
series of declines that began in March 2010.  In New Brunswick, five of the six large centres had fewer
beneficiaries in the 12 months to March. In Saint John, the
number of people receiving benefits fell 5.6% to 3,000,
continuing the series of year-over-year declines that began 14
months earlier.  Of the 33 large centres in  Quebec , 28 had fewer
beneficiaries between March 2011 and March 2012. The largest
percentage declines occurred in Rouyn-Noranda, Val-d’Or and
Sherbrooke. In Montréal, the number of people receiving benefits
fell 11.1% to 65,200, extending a two-year-long period of
declines. In Thetford Mines, the number of beneficiaries
increased for the fourth consecutive month.  The number of people receiving benefits fell in 37 of the
41 large centres in Ontario in the 12 months to March. The
largest percentage declines occurred in Stratford, Hamilton,
Chatham-Kent and Windsor. In Toronto, the number of
beneficiaries fell 16.4% to 71,000, extending the two-year-long
trend of year-over-year monthly declines.  In Manitoba, the number of people receiving regular
benefits decreased in all four large centres in the 12 months to
March. In Winnipeg, the number of beneficiaries fell 1.6% to
7,300.  In Saskatchewan, the number of people receiving benefits
decreased in seven of the eight large centres between March 2011
and March 2012. The number of beneficiaries in Regina declined
10.5% to 1,400, continuing a series of declines that began in
the summer of 2010. In Saskatoon, the number of beneficiaries
fell 5.3% to 2,200, the 16th consecutive year-over-year monthly
decline.  All 12 large centres in Alberta had fewer beneficiaries in
March compared with 12 months earlier. The largest percentage
decreases occurred in  Grande Prairie , Lethbridge, Cold Lake, Red
Deer,  Edmonton  and Calgary. In Edmonton, the number of
beneficiaries fell 35.7% to 9,000 and in Calgary, it declined
32.6%, also to 9,000. This continues the two-year-long period of
declines for both Edmonton and Calgary.  In British Columbia, the number of beneficiaries fell in 22
of the 25 large centres, with the largest percentage declines in
Squamish, Nanaimo, Chilliwack, Kamloops,  Vancouver  and Victoria.
In Vancouver, 25,600 people received benefits in March, down
17.9% from March 2011, continuing a series of declines that
began almost two years earlier. In Victoria, 3,300 people
received regular benefits, down 16.9%.  Demographic groups  EI data by sex and age are not seasonally adjusted and are
therefore compared on a year-over-year basis.  Between March 2011 and March 2012, the number of men
receiving regular benefits fell 8.8% to 452,200, continuing a
series of declines that started in March 2010. The decline was
similar for men under 25 years of age (-9.7%) and for those aged
25 to 54 (-9.8%). Among men aged 55 and over, the number of
beneficiaries fell 5.4%.  A total of 232,200 women received regular benefits in March,
down 11.8% from March 2011. Among women under 25 years of age,
the number of beneficiaries fell 14.8%, while for those aged 25
to 54, it was down 12.5%. For women aged 55 and over, the
decline was 8.4%.  Note to readers  The change in the number of regular Employment Insurance
(EI) beneficiaries reflects various situations, including people
becoming beneficiaries, people going back to work, and people
exhausting their regular benefits.  All data in this release are seasonally adjusted unless
otherwise specified.  EI statistics are produced from administrative data sources
provided by Service  Canada  and Human Resources and Skills
Development Canada. These statistics may, from time to time, be
affected by changes to the Employment Insurance Act or
administrative procedures. The number of regular beneficiaries
and the number of claims received for February and March are
preliminary. In this release, large centres correspond to those
with a population of 10,000 or more.  The number of beneficiaries is a measure of all people who
received EI benefits from March 11 to 17. This period coincides
with the reference week of the Labour Force Survey (LFS).  EI statistics indicate the number of people who received EI
benefits, and should not be confused with data coming from the
LFS, which provides information on the total number of
unemployed people.  There is always a certain proportion of unemployed people
who do not qualify for benefits. Some unemployed people have not
contributed to the program because they have not worked in the
past 12 months or their employment is not insured. Other
unemployed people have contributed to the program but do not
meet the eligibility criteria, such as workers who left their
job voluntarily or those who did not accumulate enough hours of
work to receive benefits.
