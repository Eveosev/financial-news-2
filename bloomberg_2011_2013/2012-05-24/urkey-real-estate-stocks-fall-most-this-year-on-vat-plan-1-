Turkish real-estate companies led by
 Emlak Konut Gayrimenkul Ortakligi AS (EKGYO)  slid the most this year
after the government said it’s considering extending a value-
added-tax on property sales.  A gauge of  property companies  declined for a second day,
dropping 3.4 percent to 32,385.42, the biggest one-day decline
since Dec. 12. Emlak Konut fell the most since August, losing
5.8 percent to 2.10 liras.  Sinpas Gayrimenkul Yatirim Ortakligi
AS (SNGYO)  fell 5.7 percent to 1.15 liras, the lowest since Jan. 31.  The Cabinet will decide on imposing the value-added-tax,
currently levied only on sales of units of 150 square meters
(1,615 square feet) or more, on smaller units depending on
property value, construction costs and the industry’s needs,
Finance Minister  Mehmet Simsek  said yesterday during a debate on
the measure in parliament.  The increase “could cause a three percentage point decline
in gross margin for all of the upcoming projects for a company
like Sinpas that bears all the costs,” according to Gulhan Ovalioglu, an analyst at Istanbul-based brokerage BGC Partners.
“The bill could be passed before the parliament’s summer recess
on July 1.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
