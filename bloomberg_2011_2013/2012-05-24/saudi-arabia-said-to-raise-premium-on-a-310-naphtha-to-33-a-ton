Saudi Arabian Oil Co. raised the
price of at least one grade of naphtha for the second half of
this year in talks with Asian buyers, according to two people
with direct knowledge of the discussions.  Aramco, the world’s largest oil exporter, set the premium
for A-310 grade naphtha at $33 a metric ton over the Middle East
benchmark for the petrochemical feedstock, the people said,
declining to be identified because the talks are confidential.
Aramco offered A-180 grade naphtha today at $31 a ton and Jubail
naphtha at $29 a ton, and Rabigh and Jeddah grades at $25 a ton,
they said.  Nobody answer an e-mail sent to Aramco’s media relations
department at company headquarters in Dhahran,  Saudi Arabia .
Company officials in the Singapore office didn’t pick up a phone
call from Bloomberg at the end of the local business day.  For the first half of 2012, Aramco sold A-180 naphtha at
$19 above Middle East prices, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The A-310 grade loading from Ras Tanura was set at
$20 a ton in the first half. Rabigh sold for $17, Al-Jubail at
$16.50 and Jeddah at $13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
