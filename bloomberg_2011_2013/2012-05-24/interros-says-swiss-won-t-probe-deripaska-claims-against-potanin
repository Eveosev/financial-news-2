The Swiss Federal Prosecutor’s Office
has decided not to investigate complaints by Oleg Deripaska
against fellow billionaire  Vladimir Potanin , his Interros
Holding and OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel, Interros said.  The Swiss prosecutor failed to find enough evidence to
start an investigation, Interros said in a statement today. The
prosecutor’s office “discontinued proceedings on May 20,” it
said in an e-mailed response to questions. A spokesman for
Deripaska declined to make any immediate comment.  The Swiss Federal Criminal Appeal Court ruled in April that
there were no grounds to hear the case.  Deripaska filed several legal complaints in  Switzerland 
since August claiming that Hans Bodmer, a Swiss lawyer who
resigned from the Hyposwiss Private Bank AG board in November,
helped steal $1 billion from Norilsk.  According to the complaints, Bodmer did work in 2010 for
Potanin and Interros, which holds 28 percent of Norilsk.
Deripaska’s United Co. Rusal, the world’s largest aluminum
producer, owns 25 percent of Norilsk. Deripaska and Potanin are
in conflict over control of Norilsk.  To contact the reporter on this story:
