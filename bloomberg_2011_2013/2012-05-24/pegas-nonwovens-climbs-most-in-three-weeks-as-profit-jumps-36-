Pegas Nonwovens SA (PEGAS)  climbed the most
in three weeks after the Czech maker of textiles used in hygiene
and health-care products said first-quarter profit rose 36
percent from the year earlier, helped by a new production line.  The stock advanced 2.4 percent to 427.9 koruna, its biggest
intraday gain since May 2 and paring this yearâ€™s decline to 6.4
percent. The 14-member  PX (PX)  equity index slid 0.2 percent today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
