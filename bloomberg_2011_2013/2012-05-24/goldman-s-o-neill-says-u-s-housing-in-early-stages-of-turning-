Chairman  Jim O’Neill  said the U.S. housing market is in the
early stages of a recovery as affordability improves.  “I’m in the camp that believes the U.S. housing market is
in the early days of turning,” O’Neill said at the Society of
Business Economists’ annual conference in  London  today. “I just
spent all of last week travelling around the U.S., I was on the
west coast, the east coast, and everywhere I went, I heard quite
lively anecdotes that this was the case.  ‘‘Looking forward, U.S. house prices to personal incomes
are now actually below where they were at the start of the
1990s,’’ he said. ‘‘So for people not trapped in the negative
equity problem, U.S. housing is cheap.’’  O’Neill also added that the position of the U.S.
government’s finances is an ‘‘enormous dilemma” and November’s
presidential election will not provide a solution.  “After being there last week, it’s not entirely clear to
me that this election coming up is going to solve any of that at
all,” the economist said. “The strength of conviction of the
Republicans and Democrats conceptually is so strong, I rather
suspect that, without a financial crisis, it’s not clear to me
that the U.S. is going to do anything about its fiscal position.  ‘‘There are such fundamental philosophical differences
about the role of  government spending  and taxation which are not
easily solved,’’ he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
