A Memorial Day holiday weekend heat
wave in the U.S. Midwest and mid-Atlantic regions will be
followed by cooling next week before hotter weather returns in
early June.  Temperatures may reach into the high 90s Fahrenheit (mid-
30s Celsius) in  St. Louis  and upper 80s in Chicago over the
weekend before dropping closer to normal through Illinois to
Missouri and Ohio from May 29 to June 2,  Matt Rogers , president
of Commodity Weather Group LLC, said in a note to clients today
from Bethesda,  Maryland .  Those levels may climb to 5 to 8 degrees above normal
across the Midwest from June 3 to June 7, he said. Temperatures
are expected to be about 3 degrees above normal this week along
the East Coast.  Twice to three times the normal amount of energy is
expected to be used to chill homes and businesses across the
Midwest and mid-Atlantic this weekend into early next week,
according to  David Salmon , owner of Weather Derivatives in
Belton, Missouri.  Both regions may see daily heat records broken over the
U.S. Memorial Day holiday weekend, according to  MDA EarthSat
Weather  in Gaithersburg, Maryland. The high in Chicago may reach
93 on May 27, one below the record 94 set for the day in 1911,
MDA said.  Washington  and Baltimore may have highs in the 90s through
Memorial Day, while Philadelphia is expected to reach 90 on the
holiday itself, according to the National Weather Service.  NYC Cooler  The heat won’t reach  New York City , where the high on May
26 is expected to be 83 and on May 27, 79.  The population-weighted cooling degree days value for the
U.S. from May 25 to May 28 is expected to reach 36.84, twice as
much as the 30-year normal of 18.38, MDA said.  The value is calculated by subtracting a base of 65 degrees
from the daily average temperature. Higher values mean warmer
weather and more energy for cooling.  St. Louis is expected to reach 97 degrees on both May 26
and May 27, according to the National Weather Service. The city
is on pace to have its warmest year on record.  Through May 22, the average temperature in St. Louis was
53.5 degrees, exceeding the previous high average of 50.8 set in
1921, the weather service said.  The normal average temperature in  New York  on May 29 is 67
degrees, according to MDA. It’s 61 in Boston, 69 in Washington,
74 in Atlanta, 79 in Houston, 77 in Dallas, 58 in  Seattle  and 67
in Burbank,  California .  To contact the reporter on this story:
