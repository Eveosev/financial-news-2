Kazakhstan’s  inflation  will end the
year at “no more than” 7 percent, Deputy Prime Minister Kairat Kelimbetov said.  Consumer-price growth will reach between 6 percent and 7
percent this year, Kelimbetov said today in the capital, Astana.
That compares with 7.4 percent at the end of last year.  The Central Asian country’s economy will expand about 7
percent this year, Kelimbetov said, adding that the government
expects gross domestic product to rise an average 7 percent a
year until 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
