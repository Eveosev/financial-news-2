Budapest Airport Zrt., the operator
of the Hungarian capitalâ€™s international airport, expects its
loss to widen to 12 billion forint ($50 million) this year from
8 billion forint in 2011, MTI reported today, citing Chief
Executive Officer Jost Lammers.  The airport, which is 50 percent owned by German
construction company  Hochtief AG (HOT) , expects the number of
passengers to drop 13 percent in 2012 following the bankruptcy
of state-owned airline Malev Zrt. this year, the state news
agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
