The central bank of Angola,  Africa ’s
second-biggest oil producer, kept its benchmark  interest rate 
unchanged for a fourth meeting to curb price pressures.  The key lending rate was left at 10.25 percent, according
to the Luanda-based Banco Nacional de Angola. The bank cut the
rate for the first time since introducing it in October,
lowering it by a quarter of a percentage point in January.  Inflation slowed to 10.9 percent in April from 11.1 percent
a month earlier, the statistics office said on May 9. Angola is
targeting inflation of less than 10 percent this year. The
economy will probably expand 8 percent this year as oil
production increases, the  International Monetary Fund  said on
May 17.  The Monetary Policy Committee was formed last year to help
improve financial management after the country secured a loan
from the IMF in 2009. The benchmark rate was set at 10.5 percent
in the committee’s first decision announced on Oct. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
