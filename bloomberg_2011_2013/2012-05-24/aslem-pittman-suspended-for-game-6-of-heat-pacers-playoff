Miami forward Udonis Haslem and
little-used center Dexter Pittman won’t be on the court tonight
when the Heat try to eliminate the  Indiana Pacers  from the
National Basketball Association playoffs.  The Heat are already missing  Chris Bosh , who has an
abdominal strain.  Haslem, 31, who has started seven of the Heat’s 10 games
this postseason, was suspended for one game without pay for
striking  Indiana ’s Tyler Hansbrough in the head and shoulders
during a 115-83 Game 5 win, said Stu Jackson, NBA executive vice
president of basketball operations.  Pittman, 24, who sees little playing time as a reserve, got
a three-game suspension for striking the neck and shoulders of
Pacers guard Lance Stephenson during the May 22 game at
AmericanAirlines Arena in Miami.  Hansbrough, who drew blood above the eye of Miami’s Dwyane Wade shortly before Haslem’s foul, was not suspended.  The Heat, with a 3-2 lead in the best-of-seven series, play
at Indianapolis tonight.  To contact the reporter on this story:
