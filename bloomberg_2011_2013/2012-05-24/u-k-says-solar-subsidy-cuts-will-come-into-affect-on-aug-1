The U.K. government will impose cuts
on solar subsidies beginning on Aug. 1, a month later than
planned, the Department of Energy and Climate Change said in a
statement in  London  today.  The government delivered results of its consultation on
support for the industry, proposing a new framework including
quarterly revisions to the feed-in tariff program that
guarantees above-market rates for electricity from solar
installantions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
