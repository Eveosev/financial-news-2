Returns for Capesize ships that haul
iron ore fell 14 percent, this year’s third-biggest drop, as
demand for commodity cargoes slowed amid a glut of vessels.  Daily average earnings plunged $1,080 to $6,847, figures
from the London-based Baltic Exchange showed today. Jan. 5 and
Jan. 12 were the only sessions in 2012 to see larger declines.
The vessels are the largest tracked by the  Baltic Dry Index (BDIY) , a
broader measure of costs to transport raw materials, which slid
for a third session.  Chinese manufacturing activity continues to contract,
cutting demand for shipping, RS Platou Markets AS said in an e-
mailed note today. Manufacturing in the country may shrink for a
seventh month, a private survey showed. Vessel demand remains
subdued in a “persistently” oversupplied market, Platou said.  “The shipping markets would continue to struggle to find a
stable footing anytime soon,” analysts at the Oslo-based
investment bank led by Frode Morkedal said in the report.  The index fell 3.8 percent to 1,058, the lowest level since
April 19, according to the exchange. The gauge is down 39
percent this year as the fleet of ships hauling dry-bulk
commodities expands more quickly than demand.  Daily returns for Panamaxes, the biggest ships to navigate
the Panama Canal, slid 4.7 percent to $9,010 as Supramaxes that
are about 25 percent smaller rose 0.3 percent to $11,751.
Handysizes, the smallest ships in the index, were little changed
at $9,696, the highest level since Nov. 10, the exchange’s
figures showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
