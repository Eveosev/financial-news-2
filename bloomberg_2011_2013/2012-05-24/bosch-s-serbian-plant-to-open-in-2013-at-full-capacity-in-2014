Robert Bosch GmbH , the world’s
largest automotive supplier, says production of windshield wiper
parts and systems at its planned Serbian plant will begin in
July next year and reach full capacity in early 2014.  The schedule is “just a few months behind” the original
one, due to delays related to construction of the 22,000 square-
meter (236,800 square-feet) facility on the 70 million-euro ($88
million) investment, said Jovanka Jovanovic, chief of Serbian
operations.  The factory in Pecinci, west of Belgrade, is to expand to
40,000 square meters as of 2016 and eventually employ 620, she
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
