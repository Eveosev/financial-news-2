Grain exports from the French port of
Rouen,  Europe ’s biggest cereal-shipping hub, slumped 61 percent
to the lowest in four weeks as  Algeria  took no wheat.  Export cargoes fell to 50,172 metric tons between May 17
and May 23 from 128,998 tons a week earlier, the  Seine River
port  wrote in an e-mailed report today. That included 41,350
tons of soft wheat, down from 123,401 tons the previous week.  Morocco was the biggest destination, taking 26,000 tons of
soft wheat, the first delivery to the country in seven weeks. No
grain was shipped to Algeria, after that country took 75,684
tons of soft wheat the previous week.  Rouen accounted for 41 percent of  France ’s grain exports by
sea in 2010-11, ahead of La Pallice on the Bay of Biscay and
Dunkirk on the  North Sea , which shipped out 17 percent and 11
percent respectively, according to port data.  Rouen grain loadings by destination, in metric tons:  To contact the reporter on this story:
