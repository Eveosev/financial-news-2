(Corrects first paragraph to show bunds rose.)  German  government bonds  extended
their advance, pushing the 10-year yield to a record low, after
a report showed business confidence fell more than economists
predicted this month.  Ten-year yields were three basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, lower at 1.36 percent at 9:04 a.m. London time, after
being as low as 1.35 percent. Thirty-year yields slipped seven
basis points to 1.93 percent.  The Munich-based Ifo institute said today that its business
climate index, based on a survey of 7,000 executives, dropped to
106.9 from 109.9 in April. Economists forecast a decline to
109.4, according to the median of 37 estimates in a Bloomberg
News survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
