General Electric Co. (GE) , the biggest
maker of power-generation equipment, plans to invest 500 million
reais ($245 million) through 2018 in a Brazilian research center
to develop energy and transportation infrastructure
technologies.  The Rio de Janeiro center will go into operation in the
second half of next year, Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE said
today in an e-mailed statement.  Brazil ’s infrastructure must be upgraded to keep up with
its expanding economy, Reinaldo Garcia, president of GE’s Latin
America unit, said in the statement. The center will develop
diagnostic systems for electric power, tools to optimize
transportation and ways to process sugar-cane byproducts into
fuel.  “The country is going through a unique moment of growth
and has specific needs for infrastructure,” Garcia said. The
center will develop systems “specifically tailored to Brazilian
demand.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
