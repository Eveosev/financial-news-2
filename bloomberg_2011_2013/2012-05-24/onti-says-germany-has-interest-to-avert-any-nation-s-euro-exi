Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti 
said  Germany  has an interest in ensuring that no country leaves
the euro.  Monti said that, in a hypothetical case, Germany would be
harmed should Italy “one day leave the euro.” A weak “new
lira” would put German exports at a disadvantage, though an
exit from the currency region would also harm Italy, Monti said
in an interview today on Italian television La7.  While “anything can happen in Greece,” the nation is
likely to remain in the 17-nation currency, Monti said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
