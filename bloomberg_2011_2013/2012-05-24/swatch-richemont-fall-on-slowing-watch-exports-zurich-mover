Swatch Group AG (UHR)  and Cie. Financiere
Richemont SA shares fell after Swiss watch exports increased at
the slowest pace in more than two years last month.  Swatch, the biggest maker of Swiss timepieces, dropped as
much as 2.9 percent in Zurich trading, extending yesterday’s 4.8
percent decline. Richemont fell as much as 1.6 percent after the
Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry said  exports  rose 7.9
percent in April to 1.7 billion Swiss francs ($1.8 billion), the
smallest gain since January 2010.  Swiss watch export growth may slow to a “single-digit”
pace this year, Jean-Daniel Pasche, the head of the federation,
said by e-mail, repeating a previous forecast. Swiss watchmakers
are depending more on growth in  China  to offset slowing European
consumption. Exports to  Hong Kong  rose 6.5 percent and shipments
to China climbed 27 percent in April, while  France  registered a
drop of 1.9 percent and Italy was down 4.9 percent.  “ Europe  is slightly disappointing,” Thomas Mesmin, an
analyst at CA Cheuvreux, wrote in a research note. Total exports
by volume were little changed and most of the increase came from
higher prices and sales of more expensive watches, he said.  Exports of watches that cost between 500 francs and 3,000
francs fell 7.7 percent by value, while shipments of timepieces
worth more than 3,000 francs increased 16 percent.  Export growth in April 2011 was 32 percent, making the
comparison difficult, Mesmin wrote. Year-to-date export growth
of about 15 percent is above analysts’ estimates, he added.  Richemont fell 0.9 percent to 55.75 francs at 10:38 a.m.,
while Swatch traded 1.8 percent lower at 368.60 francs.  The watch export data track shipments of timepieces abroad
and don’t represent sales to end-customers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
