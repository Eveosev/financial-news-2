Wynn Macau Ltd. (WYNN) , the Hong Kong-listed
unit of billionaire  Steve Wynn ’s Las Vegas company, has started
marketing a $1.5 billion loan to banks, according to a person
familiar with the matter.  The financing is split into a $1 billion, five-year
revolving credit facility and a $500 million, six-year  term
loan , the person said, asking not to be identified because the
details are private.  Wynn Macau communications director Katharine Liu declined
to comment when contacted by e-mail today.  Macau is the world’s largest gambling hub by revenue and
the only place in  China  where gambling in casinos is legally
allowed. The number of Chinese visitors to Macau rose 22 percent
to 16 million last year, helping to increase gambling revenue 42
percent to 268 billion patacas ($33.5 billion), according to
Macau’s Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau.  Wynn Macau will use proceeds from the loan to finance a new
project along the city’s Cotai strip, another person familiar
with the matter said on May 22. Deutsche Bank AG and JPMorgan
Chase & Co. joined the loan prior to syndication with
commitments of $200 million each, the person said today.  The margin on both portions of the loan starts at 250 basis
points more than the London interbank offered rate for the first
two quarters, after which it will be based on a leverage ratio
grid, the person said.  The margin will be 250 basis points for leverage of 4.5
times or more, 225 basis points for 4 to 4.5 times, 200 basis
points for 3 to 4 times and 175 basis points for less than 3
times, the person said.  Banks pledging $200 million will be paid an upfront fee of
200 basis points and given the title of global coordinating lead
arranger, the person said. Banks committing $150 million get a
150 basis-point fee while those lending $100 million get 100
basis points, the person said. Lenders pledging $50 million will
receive a 75 basis-point fee.  There is also a so-called early-bird fee of 12.5 basis
points for banks joining before the end of the first week of
June, the person said. Banks can fund the facility in either
U.S. or Hong Kong dollars.  Wynn Macau has a $1 billion revolving loan due in June,
part of a $1.55 billion facility signed in 2007, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Deutsche Bank and Bank of America
Corp. were among the lenders, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
