Asian currencies fell to the lowest
level of the year on lingering doubts whether  Europe  will
succeed in containing its debt crisis, a concern that’s prompted
overseas investors to cut holdings of regional stocks.  Funds based abroad withdrew $1.1 billion from equity
markets in Taiwan, South Korea, Indonesia and Thailand in the
first three days of this week, exchange data show. Chinese
leaders pledged yesterday to intensify “fine-tuning” of
policies, signaling a commitment to economic growth as domestic
demand slows and European officials try to ensure Greece doesn’t
exit the euro.  “Lingering concerns about Greece and Europe’s debt problem
are making investors stay away from riskier assets,” said
 Hideki Hayashi , a researcher at the Japan Center for Economic
Research in  Tokyo . “Asian currencies are under growing pressure
to depreciate.”  Indonesia’s rupiah dropped 1.7 percent to 9,416 per dollar
as of 3:56 p.m. in Jakarta and reached 9,421, the lowest level
since February 2010, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg. The Philippine peso fell 0.7 percent to
43.740,  South Korea ’s won weakened 0.6 percent to 1,180.05, and
Thailand’s baht declined 0.4 percent to 31.65. The Bloomberg-
JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index touched 114.24 today, the lowest
level since Dec. 15.  China’s manufacturing may shrink for a seventh month in May,
as a purchasing managers’ index compiled by HSBC Holdings Plc
and Markit Economics showed a preliminary reading of 48.7 today,
compared with 49.3 for April. A level of 50 is the dividing line
between expansion and contraction.  Europe Crisis  Malaysia reported yesterday that economic growth slowed to
4.7 percent in the first quarter, the least since the three
months ended June 2011, as the European debt crisis sapped
demand for exports. The ringgit lost 0.2 percent to 3.1540 per
dollar in  Kuala Lumpur , and reached 3.1576 today, the weakest
level since Jan. 9.  German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said yesterday that the
nation was still opposed to jointly issuing euro bonds after
leaders met during a European Union summit, at which officials
aired contrasting views on how to overcome the debt crisis. “We
want  Greece  to remain in the euro area while respecting its
commitments” to deficit-cutting measures, according to a
statement.  Reports out of Europe today showed business confidence in
 Germany  fell more than economists’ forecast and sentiment in
France dropped for a second month. European services and
manufacturing industries also declined more than analysts
predicted.  Korea’s Stocks Sales  The won reached a seven-month low of 1,180.08 per dollar as
overseas funds  sold  more of the nation’s stocks than they bought
for a 17th day.  “Speculation that the summit may disappoint is putting
downward pressure on the won,” said Jeon Seung Ji, a Seoul-
based foreign-exchange analyst at Samsung Futures Inc.
“Currency movements may change depending on the summit results
to be announced, and also players shorting the euro and buying
the won may limit losses.” A short position is a bet that an
asset will decline.  Elsewhere,  China ’s  yuan  fell 0.16 percent to 6.3447 against
the U.S. currency, while Taiwan’s dollar slipped 0.2 percent to
NT$29.645. India’s rupee lost 0.4 percent to 56.2425 and
Vietnam’s dong declined 0.1 percent to 20,868.  To contact the reporters on this story:
