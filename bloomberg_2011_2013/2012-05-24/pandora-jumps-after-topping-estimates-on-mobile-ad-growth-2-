Pandora Media Inc. (P) , the Internet
radio pioneer, rose the most since its first day of trading in
June 2011 after first-quarter results exceeded analysts’
estimates on higher mobile advertising sales.  Pandora advanced 12 percent to $11.60 at the close in  New
York , the biggest gain since June 15 last year. After markets
closed yesterday, the Oakland, California-based company posted a
first-quarter loss of 9 cents a share, excluding items, smaller
than the 18-cent loss forecast by 18 analysts in a Bloomberg
 survey .  Of the $70.6 million in advertising sales in the period, 55
percent stemmed from mobile devices, Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer  Joe Kennedy  said in an interview. The top 50
biggest digital marketers in the U.S. are now advertising on
Pandora’s mobile and desktop services, he said.  “We’re excited about continued progress on mobile
monetization,” Kennedy said. “It’s the highest percentage it
has ever been.”  Sales rose 58 percent to $80.8 million in the first quarter
ended April 30, Pandora said yesterday in a statement. That beat
the $74.5 million average forecast of analysts.  The stock is down 25 percent from its initial public
offering at $16 in June 2011.  The company forecasts second-quarter revenue of $99 million
to $101 million and a per-share loss of 3 cents to 5 cents,
excluding items. Analysts project $100.5 million in sales and a
loss of 3 cents.  For the year, Pandora sees $420 million to $427 million in
revenue, with a loss of 7 cents to 11 cents a share, excluding
items. Analysts were predicting a loss of 16 cents on revenue of
$416.2 million.  Pandora reported a first-quarter net loss of $20.2 million,
or 12 cents a share, compared with a loss of $9.14 million, or
61 cents, a year earlier, before the company’s initial public
offering.  To contact the reporter on this story:
