Gevo Inc. (GEVO) , the U.S. biotechnology
company backed by the French oil company  Total SA (FP)  and the
specialty chemicals maker  Lanxess AG (LXS) , rose the most in more than
two months after its first commercial biofuel plant went into
production.  Gevo rose 9.5 percent to $5.86 at the close in New York,
the most since March 8.  The company’s plant in Luverne, Minnesota, began making
isobutanol yesterday, the world’s first commercial facility
using renewable sources to do so, the Englewood, Colorado-based
company said in a statement today.  Gevo makes isobutanol from corn and non-food crops.
Isobutanol may be blended with gasoline or refined into jet
fuel, specialty chemicals or other products that are typically
derived from petroleum.  “One year ago, we broke ground with a startup goal of less
than 12 months and we’ve succeeded,” Chief Executive Officer
Patrick Gruber said in the statement. “The startup of our
Luverne plant represents a major milestone for the industry.”  The company estimates the plant will be making 1 million
gallons (3.8 million liters) a month by the end of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
