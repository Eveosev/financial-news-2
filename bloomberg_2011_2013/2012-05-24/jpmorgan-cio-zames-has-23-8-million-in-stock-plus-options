Matthew Zames, the banker named to
clean up  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s $2 billion trading loss, has
693,285 restricted and unrestricted shares valued at $23.8
million as of yesterday.  JPMorgan disclosed Zames’ holdings after appointing him to
replace Ina Drew as chief investment officer this month. Drew’s
London-based unit lost money under her watch on  credit
derivatives . The New York-based company is the biggest U.S. bank
by assets.  Zames also has 392,115 stock options that have a strike
price higher than the current price of $33.71 as of 3:17 p.m. in
New York  trading . The company also awarded him 200,000 options
in January 2009 with a strike price of $19.49 that could be
exercised at a gain of about $3 million as of yesterday’s
closing price.  To contact the reporters on this story:
