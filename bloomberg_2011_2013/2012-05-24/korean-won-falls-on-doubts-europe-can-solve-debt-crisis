South Korea’s won fell to the weakest
level in more than seven months and  government bonds  rose amid
doubts Europe will succeed in containing its debt crisis.  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said Germany stood by its
opposition to jointly issue euro bonds at a European Union
summit at which leaders aired contrasting views on how to
overcome the debt crisis. The  Kospi (KOSPI)  Index climbed even after
overseas funds cut holdings of the nation’s shares by $3.2
billion this month through yesterday, exchange data showed.  “The  market sentiment  is very bad with no clear resolution
to the European debt crisis,” said Cho Young Bok, a Seoul-based
currency dealer at Daegu Bank. “Overseas funds are buying the
dollar to repatriate funds after selling Korean stocks.”  The won slid 0.6 percent to 1,180.05 per dollar at the
close in Seoul, taking this month’s loss to 4.2 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency touched
1,180.08, the weakest level since Oct. 7. One-month implied
volatility for the won, a measure of exchange-rate swings used
to price options, was steady at 11.93 percent.  The yield on South Korea’s 3.25 percent bonds due December
2014 declined one basis point to 3.35 percent, Korea Exchange
Inc. prices show. That’s the lowest rate since January. Three-
year debt futures climbed 0.03 to 104.54 and the one-year
 interest-rate swaps  dropped one basis point to 3.34 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
