VMware Inc. (VMW)  shares fell the most
since December after an analyst said growth at the biggest maker
of software that lets computers run multiple operating systems
may slow amid market saturation and competition.  The stock tumbled 7.2 percent to $94.35 at 1:27 p.m. in  New
York , after dropping as much as 8.5 percent, the biggest decline
since Dec. 21. The shares had climbed 22 percent this year
before today.  As much as 60 percent of companies already have the type of
server virtualization software VMware sells, according to Mark Moerdler, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. Maximum
penetration will probably be around 80 percent, so “there is a
high risk of a meaningful slowdown in the next 12 to 24
months,” Moerdler wrote in a note today.  More companies will look to cheaper or free products from
rivals Microsoft Corp. and  Citrix Systems Inc. (CTXS)  for less critical
tasks, he said. To compensate for slower growth in server
virtualization, which lets companies save money by combining
multiple workloads on a single machine, VMware must increase
revenue from its management software, he said.  Even so, the company probably won’t gain the dominant
position in that field, and other initiatives aren’t growing
rapidly enough to make up for slowing growth, he said.  VMware, based in  Palo Alto , California, is majority-owned
by  EMC Corp. (EMC)   To contact the reporter on this story:
