NYSE Euronext (NYX)  may consider buying the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange (GPW)  in the future if such an opportunity
arises, Deputy Chief Executive Officer Dominique Cerutti told
Poland’s TVN CNBC in an interview today.  While NYSE Euronext is not in talks to buy the Warsaw
bourse, it is increasing technical cooperation with the region’s
biggest stock market, Cerutti said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
