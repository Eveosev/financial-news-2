JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  was sued by a
homeowner who accused the bank of forcing the holders of
mortgages it services to pay for “excessive amounts of flood
insurance coverage.”  Mathew Scheetz, of  Fort Collins , Colorado, sued the bank
yesterday in federal court in Manhattan. He is seeking to
represent a nationwide class of mortgage borrowers and asked for
unspecified damages.  The suit follows the announcement by New York state
regulators into rates for so-called force-placed insurance,
which is taken out on homes by banks or mortgage servicers when,
for example, a homeowner’s policy lapses or the bank decides the
borrower doesn’t have enough coverage.  The case is Scheetz v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, 12-cv-4113,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
