Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s NBCUniversal division
is in talks with  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  about buying out the software
maker’s stake in the MSNBC.com news website.  Conversations are taking place between the two companies,
Amy Lynn, a spokeswoman for NBC News in New York, said yesterday
in an e-mail, without elaborating. The talks were  previously
reported  by Adweek.  Microsoft and NBC started MSNBC in 1996, teaming up to
create a 24-hour news channel and companion website. NBC agreed
to acquire the news channel in 2005, leaving the Internet
portion as a joint venture. The idea now would be to bring
MSNBC.com under the broadcaster’s umbrella as well, giving it
more control over the website and its content.  Comcast, the largest cable-television provider, acquired
 NBC Universal  last year.  Peter Wootton, a spokesman for Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft, declined to comment on the MSNBC.com talks.  Shares of Philadelphia-based Comcast rose 0.5 percent to
$28.93 yesterday, while Microsoft fell 0.1 percent to $29.07.  To contact the reporter on this story:
