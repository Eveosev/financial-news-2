(Corrects currency conversion in second paragraph.)  U.S. stocks extended losses after
three banking officials said  China ’s biggest banks may fall
short of loan targets as an economic slowdown crimps demand for
credit.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.3 percent to
1,314.69 at 12:05 p.m. in New York.  A decline in lending in April and May means it’s likely the
banks’ total new loans for 2012 will be about 7 trillion  yuan 
($1.1 trillion), less than the government goal of 8 trillion
yuan to 8.5 trillion yuan, said one of the officials, declining
to be identified because the person isn’t authorized to speak
publicly. Banks are relying on small- and mid-sized companies
for loan growth after demand from the biggest state-owned
borrowers dropped, the people said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
