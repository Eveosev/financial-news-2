General Electric Co. (GE)  and Royal
Philips Electronics NV won U.S. approval to monitor hospital
patients using airwaves dedicated to flight testing by aerospace
companies led by Boeing Co.  The Federal Communications Commission on a 5-0 vote today
decided medical-equipment makers could employ wireless
monitoring that may rid hospital rooms of nests of cables and
let patients move out of expensive intensive-care wards.  GE Healthcare proposed the use of new airwaves for patient
monitoring in 2007. Aerospace companies said wireless medical
data could foul streams of flight-test telemetry from missiles
and planes, endangering pilots and people on the ground.  The two sides negotiated a solution they asked the FCC to
adopt, and point to it as a model for sharing airwaves to meet
increasing demand from data-hungry mobile devices.  Under the rules approved today, hospitals could wirelessly
monitor patients using low-power devices that shut off if the
patients move outdoors. Hospitals face more restrictions if they
are near a ground-receiving station for aerial telemetry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
