India ’s rupee traded near a record
low on concern investors will favor safer bets than emerging-
market assets after European leaders disagreed on ways to
contain their region’s debt crisis.  The currency fell for a fourth day as exchange data showed
global funds  cut holdings  of Indian shares by $346 million in
the past month. The rupee has lost 6.1 percent this month in
 Asia ’s worst currency performance before a government report
that analysts  predict  will show the economy grew 6.1 percent in
the first quarter from a year earlier, matching the slowest pace
since March 2009 in the preceding three months.  “Concerns about domestic growth remain and the global
backdrop seems to be getting worse,” said Naveen Raghuvanshi, a
trader at  Development Credit Bank Ltd. (DEVB)  in Mumbai. “I expect the
rupee to weaken from here as the outflows will continue.”  The rupee declined 0.3 percent to 56.1450 per dollar as of
9:50 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency touched a record low of 56.2213 yesterday.  The rupee’s one-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, declined 70 basis
points, or 0.7 percentage point, from this year’s high of 14.5
percent reached yesterday.  India’s growth may remain “subdued” in the fiscal year
through March 2013 as inflation curbs consumption and restrains
interest-rate cuts, the Organization of Economic Cooperation and
Development said May 22. European leaders clashed over a
proposal for joint debt sales at the 18th summit in more than
two years of crisis fighting, calling on  Greece  to stick with
the budget cuts needed to stay in the euro and offering no
immediate relief for recession-wracked  Spain .  Six-month onshore currency forwards traded at 57.90 a
dollar, compared with 57.93 yesterday, and offshore non-
deliverable contracts were at 58.23 from 58.26. Forwards are
agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-
deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
