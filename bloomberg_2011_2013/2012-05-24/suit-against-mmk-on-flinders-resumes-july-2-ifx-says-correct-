(Corrects date in headline and first paragraph.)  A Chelyabinsk court will resume
hearing a suit on July 2 by OAO Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel
shareholder, Elena Egorova, against the company over its plans
to buy  Australia ’s  Flinders Mines Ltd. (FMS) , Interfax reported today
from the court.  The judge agreed to Egorova’s request that the hearings be
closed to the public as financial and company information would
be discussed, Interfax said. Kirill Golubkov, a spokesman for
Magnitogorsk, declined to comment immediately when contacted by
