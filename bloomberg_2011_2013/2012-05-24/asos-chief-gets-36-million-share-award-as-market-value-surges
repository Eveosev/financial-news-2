Asos Plc (ASC)  Chief Executive Officer Nick Robertson received a 22.7 million-pound ($36 million) reward
after presiding over three years of growth that led to a more
than sixfold increase in the online retailer’s market value.  Robertson, who jointly founded the company in 2000 and
listed it on the stock market the following year, was awarded
1.49 million Asos shares under a management incentive plan that
dates back to April 2009, Asos said today in a statement. The
 shares  closed yesterday in  London  at 1,522 pence and rose as
much as 5.9 percent today after the company reported a 43
percent increase in full-year earnings.  Asos’s market value increased to 1.37 billion pounds from
219 million pounds over the term of the incentive plan as growth
in earnings per share exceeded the 42 percent a year required
for the maximum award. The company, which sells young fashion to
a mainly female customer base, increased sales by 46 percent to
about 495 million pounds last year and has a goal to reach 1
billion pounds by 2015 as it steps up expansion outside the U.K.  “We remain positive in our outlook for 2012/13 as we
continue our journey to becoming the world’s number-one online
fashion destination,” Robertson said in a separate statement.  The CEO owned 7.77 million shares as of August 2011 and the
latest award would increase the value of his holding in the
London-based company to about 141 million pounds, based on the
stock’s closing price yesterday. Half of the latest award of
shares will vest in September this year and half will vest in
September 2013.  In total, about 4 million shares will be awarded to Asos
executives under the incentive plan, including Finance Director
Nick Beighton, International Director Jon Kamaluddin and Robert Bready, director of product and trading.  International Growth  Asos’s pretax profit in the year ended March 31 rose to
40.9 million pounds before one-time items from 28.6 million
pounds a year earlier, the online retailer said today. That
compared with the 40.4 million-pound average  estimate  of 14
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The company is “very bullish” on prospects for growing
its international business, Robertson said in a telephone
interview. About two-thirds of sales already come from outside
its domestic market including the U.S.,  Australia  and  Europe .  Asos plans to add marketing offices in Berlin, Paris and
 New York , the CEO said. In the U.K., the company expects “flat
to single-digit” growth in revenue this year.  Asos  shares  rose 4.8 percent to 1,595 pence at 10:03 a.m.
in London trading, extending their gain this year to 29 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
