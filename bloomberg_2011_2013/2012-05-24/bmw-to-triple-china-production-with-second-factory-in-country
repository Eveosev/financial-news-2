Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) , the
world’s biggest maker of luxury cars, will quadruple production
capacity in  China , prepping for rising demand in the world’s
largest auto market.  The capacity at a new plant in Tiexi will rise to 200,000
vehicles in 2014, adding to the 100,000 cars that BMW currently
produces at a factory in Da Dong, the Munich-based company said
today. Total China  production  could rise to as many as 400,000
vehicles in the future, the automaker said.  The plants are operated with  Brilliance China Automotive
Holdings Ltd. (1114)  The partners will jointly invest another 500
million euros ($629 million) together to fund the expansion. The
investment comes on top of the 1 billion euros spent since 2009.  “China is one of the BMW Group’s top three markets
worldwide and offers tremendous potential for growth, especially
in the premium segment,” Chief Executive Officer  Norbert Reithofer  said at today’s inauguration ceremony.  The Tiexi plant is building the X1 compact sport-utility
vehicle, and will add a long-wheelbase version of BMW’s best-
selling 3-Series starting in the second half. More models could
be produced on the Tiexi line, the company said, adding no
decision has been made yet.  Workers at Dadong make a stretched version of the 5-Series
sedan. A plug-in variant of the vehicle, which was presented as
a concept last year, will also be produced there. The Chinese
government obliges carmakers to introduce so-called new energy
vehicles to counter rising pollution as the numbers of cars on
the street in the country multiplies.  Engine Manufacturing  The partners have also started manufacturing four-cylinder
engines in Shenyang to supply the local production sites with
200,000 engines a year initially. The opening of the only engine
plant outside of  Europe  underlines the commitment to the Chinese
market, Chief Financial Officer Friedrich Eichiner said in a
statement.  The joint venture will add 2,000 jobs in the coming years,
raising the total  workforce  to 10,000. The partners began
producing vehicles in China in 2003.  BMW’s deliveries in China may gain as much as 30 percent
this year, the automaker said today. The BMW brand’s four-month
sales in China climbed 35 percent to 100,300 vehicles. Global
sales rose 10 percent to 478,030.  China was BMW’s largest market by sales in the first
quarter, surpassing  Germany  and the U.S, Reithofer said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
