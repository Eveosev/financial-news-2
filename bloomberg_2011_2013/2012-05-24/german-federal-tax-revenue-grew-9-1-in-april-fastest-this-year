German federal and state tax revenue
expanded the fastest this year in April compared with a year
earlier, mirroring the robust state of the economy, a Finance
Ministry report showed.  Economic growth of 0.5 percent in the first quarter helped
federal tax revenue grow 9.1 percent in April compared with a
year ago while state taxes grew 13.3 percent on the year, the
Berlin-based ministry said today in its report for the month.  Most federal taxes grew with the exception of the duty on
electrical power, the ministry said. The states registered the
biggest gain, 32 percent, through local property tax, it said.  Europe ’s biggest economy benefited from the growth in
exports to countries outside Europe, reduced unemployment that
is boosting domestic consumption and industrial production which
regained traction toward the end of the first quarter, the
report said.  This year’s wage settlements in key industries such as the
6.5 percent gained by federal and municipal workers are not
expected to boost inflation in  Germany , the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
