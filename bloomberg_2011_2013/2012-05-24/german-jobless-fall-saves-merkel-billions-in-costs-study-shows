Germany’s declining unemployment rate
is saving Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s government billions of
euros in outlays, a  report  from the Federal Labor Agency showed.  Costs borne by the state last year to pay for unemployment
totaled 56 billion euros ($70 billion) compared with 88 billion
euros in 2005, the agency’s IAB research unit said in a report
published this week. In 2005, the country eased labor market
restrictions, including rules on hiring and firing.  Unemployment in  Europe ’s biggest economy has declined every
month but three since July 2009, adding ammunition to Merkel’s
position that her fiscal and economic policies are the best
means to weather the euro region’s debt crisis. The number of
people without work rose an unexpected 19,000 to 2.87 million in
adjusted terms in April. In April 2005, the adjusted number of
unemployed was 4.89 million.  Germany  made its biggest savings on unemployment between
2005 and 2008, when outlays dropped a third, the IAB said. The
costs rose by 4 billion euros in the economic contraction of
2009, were stagnant in 2010 and fell again by 4 billion euros
last year.  Reduced unemployment brings two-way savings as workers’
unemployment insurance payments fill the Nuremberg-based
agency’s coffers at the same time as its outlays decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
