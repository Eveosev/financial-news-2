VeriFone Systems Inc. (PAY) , the largest
maker of credit-card terminals, said shoppers will be able to
use their PayPal accounts at cash registers in some brick-and-
mortar stores this holiday season.  EBay Inc. (EBAY) , owner of the PayPal online-payments business,
and VeriFone have signed a licensing and marketing deal to add
the payment option at U.S. retailers, Jennifer Miles, an
executive vice president at VeriFone, said in an interview. She
didn’t name the retailers.  The entry will advance EBay’s efforts to enter the market
for physical retail transactions, which dwarf online commerce.
E-commerce accounted for 7 percent, or  $200 billion , of total
U.S. retail sales last year, according to Forrester Research.  The two companies have collaborated on an application that
can be used remotely to upgrade VeriFone cash registers already
installed in stores. About 80 percent of the top 200 U.S.
retailers use VeriFone card terminals, Miles said.  “We are making it very easy for merchants to implement
this,” Miles said. “It opens up PayPal to offer account
holders a variety of ways to pay.” The PayPal feature will
initially be implemented on VeriFone’s  MX Solutions  products,
using either a PayPal card or a telephone number and pass code
combination.  Equinox Payments LLC, a maker of payment terminals and
software, will announce a similar agreement with PayPal, Anuj Nayar, a spokesman for PayPal, said in an interview.  PayPal and VeriFone competitor  Ingenico (ING)   agreed  in January
to incorporate PayPal into the French company’s card-reading
terminals. PayPal also announced  a relationship  with AJB
Software Design Inc. to develop software to ease merchants’
processing of PayPal transactions.  Also today, PayPal announced point-of-sale payment
partnerships with 15 retailers, including J.C. Penney Co., Jamba
Inc., Foot Locker Inc. and Abercrombie & Fitch Co.  EBay was little changed at $39.67 at the close in  New York ,
while shares of VeriFone decreased 3.6 percent to $45.  To contact the reporter on this story:
