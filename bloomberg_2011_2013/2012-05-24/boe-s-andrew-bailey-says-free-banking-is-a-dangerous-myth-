Bank of England Executive Director
 Andrew Bailey  said free banking for checking accounts in the
U.K. is a “dangerous myth” that may encourage banks to mis-
sell other products and makes weighing its cost difficult.  “Nothing in life is free,” Bailey said in a speech in
London today. “The reform of retail banking in this country
cannot move ahead unless we tackle the issue of free in-credit
banking, and have a much better sense of what we are paying for
and how we are paying.”  U.K. consumers have access to checking accounts at banks
for free, unless they are overdrawn or break rules, which
attract fees. Britain’s four largest banks have set aside at
least 6.4 billion pounds ($10 billion) to compensate customers
who were improperly sold loan insurance, including  Lloyds
Banking Group Plc (LLOY) , which accounted for more than half of the
total.  “It’s a complete myth that banking is free now,” said
Richard Lloyd, executive director at consumer group Which? in an
e-mailed statement. British consumers pay more than 9 billion
pounds a year in fees and lost interest on their checking
accounts, he estimates.  “The idea that if banks charged more, they would stop
trying to mis-sell other financial products is completely
unfounded,” said Lloyd.  Bailey “forgets that stock market-quoted and shareholder
value-driven banks maximize fee income and they will do that
regardless of free banking,” said Ismail Erturk, Senior
Lecturer in Banking at Manchester Business School.  To contact the reporter on this story:
