European Union investigations into
the  food industry , including 60 current antitrust cases, have
benefited farmers, suppliers and consumers, regulators said in a
report today.  The industry has been a priority since a food-price crisis
broke out in 2007, the European Commission said in a statement
today. Regulators in the EU’s 27 member states investigated more
than 180 antitrust cases and 1,300 mergers in the food industry
between 2004 and 2011, according to the report from the European
Competition Network, a group of the bloc’s competition agencies.  “Competition authorities across  Europe  are working hard to
ensure that food markets work for suppliers and consumers
alike,” European Union antitrust chief  Joaquin Almunia  said in
the statement. “Where there has been anticompetitive behavior
at any level of the food supply chain, competition authorities
have swiftly addressed them.”  The largest number of cases concerned processing and retail
portions of the food industry, the commission said. Most cases
concerned cereal-based products, retail sale of groceries and
milk and dairy, followed by fruits and vegetables and meat,
poultry and eggs, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
