A  Facebook Inc. (FB)  investor sued the
social-networking company’s officers and directors on its
behalf, claiming they violated their fiduciary duties in
handling the May 17 initial public offering.  Edward Childs, a Pennsylvanian who says he bought 100
Facebook shares after the IPO, sued Chief Executive Officer  Mark Zuckerberg  and other company officers and board members in a so-
called derivative lawsuit.  Childs claimed in the suit, filed today in Manhattan
federal court, that Facebook told its underwriters shortly
before the IPO that the company was lowering its earnings
guidance. The underwriters passed the information to some
institutional investors, according to the complaint.  The company didn’t release the information publicly, and it
didn’t become known until May 22, according to the complaint.  “As a result of this news, the stock price plummeted, and
Facebook is now subject to various lawsuits and governmental and
regulatory investigations, and has suffered significant
reputational harm,” according to the complaint.  Facebook believes the lawsuit is without merit and will
defend against it, Ashley Zandy, a spokeswoman for the  Menlo
Park , California-based company, said in an e-mail.  The case is Childs v. Zuckerberg, 12-cv-4156, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
