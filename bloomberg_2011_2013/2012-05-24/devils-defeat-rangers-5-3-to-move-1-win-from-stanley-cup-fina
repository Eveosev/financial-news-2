Ryan Carter scored a tie-breaking
goal late in the third period as the New Jersey Devils beat the
 New York  Rangers 5-3 to move within a win of reaching the
National Hockey League’s Stanley Cup Final.  The Devils lead the best-of-seven Eastern Conference finals
by three games to two. Game 6 is set for tomorrow at the
Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey, with a decisive seventh
game, if necessary, on May 27 in New York.  New Jersey led 3-0 within 10 minutes last night at Madison
Square Garden, only for the Rangers tie the score with a goal in
each period.  Stephen Gionta, Patrik Elias and  Travis Zajac  scored the
first three goals for the Devils.  Brandon Prust made it 3-1 after 15 minutes, 42 seconds in
the first period,  Ryan Callahan  added a goal in the first minute
of the second period and Marian Gaborik tied the score 17
seconds into the third period for the Rangers, who have lost the
past two games by a combined score of 9-4.  “We probably played our best game of the series,” Rangers
coach  John Tortorella  told reporters.  Carter scored with 4:24 remaining in the third period and
Zach Parise added an empty-net goal with 32 seconds remaining.  “You have to (keep it together) this time of year,” Gionta
said. “You have to have a short memory. Fortunately we did and
came out with the victory.”  The winner of the series will face the  Los Angeles Kings 
for the Stanley Cup title. The Kings eliminated the Phoenix
Coyotes four games to one in the Western Conference finals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
