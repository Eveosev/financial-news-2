India ’s steel ministry officials will
meet the nation’s top producers, including  Tata Steel Ltd. (TATA)  and
 Steel Authority of India Ltd. , on June 1 to discuss reasons for
the increase in prices of some products.  The government is concerned about rising prices, Steel
Secretary D.R.S. Chaudhary told reporters in  New Delhi  today.
Prices of long products, used in construction, are higher than
the flat variety, which is costlier to make, he said.  Manufacturers including  Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd. (RINL) 
increased prices of steel used in constructing homes, bridges
and power plants by about 8 percent this year, while flat
products for cars and refrigerators are almost unchanged. Demand
rose after the government raised spending to set up
infrastructure projects and boost growth.  “Prices are being driven purely by market factors and some
cost push is due to increase in excise duty and railway
freight,” said A.P. Choudhary, chairman of Rashtriya Ispat.
“There is good demand from the housing and construction sectors
and we hope it will be sustained.”  The government increased standard excise duty rates from 10
percent to 12 percent in this year’s budget. The  Indian Railways 
increased freight rates on commodities by as much as 20 percent
in March.  Rashtriya Ispat expects a 20 percent increase in sales
volumes during the year that started April 1, the chairman said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
