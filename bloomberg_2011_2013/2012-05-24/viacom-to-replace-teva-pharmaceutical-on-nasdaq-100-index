Viacom Inc. (VIAB)  was picked to replace
 Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA)  in the  Nasdaq-100 Index (NDX) , six
months after the company moved its stock listing to the Nasdaq
Stock Market from the  New York  Stock Exchange.  The media company that owns Paramount film studio, MTV,
Nickelodeon and  Comedy Central  will join the index before the
start of trading on May 30, Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. said in
statement yesterday.  Viacom (VIA) , based in New York, has a market
value of $25.1 billion, compared with a median of about $11
billion for companies in the index, according to  data  compiled
by Bloomberg.  The Nasdaq-100 serves as the basis for the PowerShares QQQ
Trust, the U.S. exchange-traded fund with the third-highest
average daily trading volume in the past 30 days, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The exchange operator is facing a fallout from  Facebook
Inc. (FB) â€™s initial public offering after computer systems used to
set the opening price were overwhelmed by order cancellations
and updates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
