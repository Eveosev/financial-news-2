Billionaire investor  Carl Icahn 
bought a 7.56 percent stake in  Chesapeake Energy Corp (CHK)  as the
second-largest U.S. natural-gas producer’s stock price plunged
amid shareholder concern about Chief Executive Officer Aubrey McClendon’s personal financial affairs.  Four of Chesapeake’s nine directors should be replaced,
Icahn said today in a letter to the Oklahoma City-based
company’s board included in a U.S. Securities & Exchange
Commission filing.  Chesapeake lost more than one-fourth of its market value
this year as the impact of plummeting gas prices was compounded
by revelations that McClendon used personal stakes in the
company’s wells to obtain more than $800 million in private
loans.  “Rather than act as a source of stability and provide
assurance to shareholders, this board has led the company
through a highly publicized spate of corporate governance
breakdowns while amassing an astounding $16 billion funding gap,
which we believe has contributed to the share price decline of
over 55% from the 52-week high,” Icahn wrote in today’s letter.  To contact the reporters on this story:
