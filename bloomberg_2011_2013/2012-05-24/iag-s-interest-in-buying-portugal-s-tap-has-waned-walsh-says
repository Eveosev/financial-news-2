British Airways (IAG)  parent IAG said its
interest in purchasing Portuguese carrier TAP SGPS SA has cooled
after the addition of U.K.-based BMI brought sufficient airport
slots to improve connectivity with  Latin America .  “Our interest in TAP has waned,” Chief Executive Officer
 Willie Walsh  said today in an interview in Brussels. While IAG,
or International Consolidated Airlines Group SA, remains
interested in acquisitions, there are none that appear suitable
right now, he said.  TAP is likely to become available for purchase this year as
Portugal seeks to raise funds under the terms of a 78 billion-
euro ($98 billion) bailout from the European Union and the
 International Monetary Fund . Walsh had said previously that the
Lisbon-based company was high on his list of takeover targets.  TAP would bring IAG lucrative Brazilian routes should the
London-based company’s Oneworld partner,  Lan Airlines SA (LAN)  of
Chile, quit the alliance following a merger with Sao Paulo-based
 Tam SA (TAMM4) , a member of the rival Star grouping.  Walsh said today that BMI’s takeoff and landing slots at
crowded London Heathrow airport are in any case sufficient to
add capacity to South America, making TAP less of a prospect.  To contact the reporter on this story:
