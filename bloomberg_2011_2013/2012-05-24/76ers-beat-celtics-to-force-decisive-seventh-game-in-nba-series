The Philadelphia 76ers defeated the
 Boston  Celtics 82-75 to force a decisive seventh game in their
National Basketball Association playoff series.  The teams will reconvene in Boston on May 26 to determine
who will play the Miami Heat or Indiana Pacers for a place in
the NBA Finals. The Heat can wrap up that series with a Game 6
victory in Indianapolis tonight.  At Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia last night, Jrue Holiday scored 20 points and Elton Brand added 13 points and 10
rebounds for the 76ers, who trailed 36-33 at halftime.  “It was a battle,” 76ers coach  Doug Collins  told
reporters. “ We competed every possession.”  Paul Pierce had 24 points and 10 rebounds for the Celtics,
and  Kevin Garnett  contributed 20 points and 11 rebounds.  “They had a lot of energy tonight and I just think they
outplayed us,” Celtics coach Doc Rivers told reporters. “We
had a lot of empty possessions offensively.”  The  San Antonio Spurs  open the Western Conference finals at
home against the Oklahoma City Thunder on May 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
