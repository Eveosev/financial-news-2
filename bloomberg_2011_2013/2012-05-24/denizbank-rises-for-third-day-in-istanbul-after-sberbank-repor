Denizbank AS (DENIZ) , the Turkish bank owned
by  Dexia SA (DEXB)  of Belgium, rose for a third day after a Kommersant
report Russiaâ€™s  OAO Sberbank (SBER)  was again interested in acquiring
it.  The shares gained 1.1 percent to 18 liras at 10 a.m. in
Istanbul, bringing their three-day advance to 16 percent.  Sberbank is again interested in buying the Turkish lender
because the market situation has changed, Kommersant newspaper
reported, citing an interview with Sberbank Chief Executive
Officer German Gref.  To contact the reporter on this story:
