Countries in the World Organization
for  Animal Health  agreed on general welfare guidelines for
livestock production and a text on conditions for cattle raised
for meat, the intergovernmental organization said.  Texts adopted at an annual meeting in Paris include
criteria and indicators to measure the welfare of beef cattle,
additional lighting for cattle that don’t have access to
daylight and other factors of cattle breeding, the group, known
by its French acronym OIE, wrote in an e-mailed statement today.  The world has about 1.02 billion cattle that will produce
280 million calves this year, U.S. Department of Agriculture
 data  show. The OIE is responsible for improving animal health
worldwide and had 178 member countries in 2011, according to the
group’s website.  “In 2011, the delegates of the OIE did not reach consensus
on a text on animal welfare of broiler chickens and this year’s
consensus on livestock is a huge step forward,” OIE Director-
General Bernard Vallat was cited as saying in the statement.
“This is an historical event that opens the way to the adoption
of animal-welfare standards in other farm-animal production.”  OIE delegates also agreed on new texts on responsible and
prudent use of antibiotics in animals for consumption, the
organization said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
