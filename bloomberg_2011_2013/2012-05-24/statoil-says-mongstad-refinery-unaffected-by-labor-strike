Statoil ASA (STL)  said its Mongstad oil
refinery is unaffected by a government workers strike that broke
out in Norway.  “We can’t immediately see that there are any effects,”
Statoil spokesman Morten Eek said in a phone interview. He said
he could not provide further details.  The plant has an annual capacity to process 10 million tons
of crude oil.
