Syria , mired in a 14-month-old
conflict that has dominated the agenda at the United Nations,
complained today that U.S. banks won’t allow its New York-based
diplomatic mission to open a bank account.  Syrian ambassador Bashar Jaafari told a UN General Assembly
committee that a bank account in  Washington  was “unexpectedly”
closed and “all banks contacted have refused to open an account
for our delegation.” He said the U.S., as host nation, was
adopting “discriminatory” measures and that existing sanctions
would prevent bank transfers to allow Syria to pay its UN dues.  The implementation of laws to thwart the financing of
terrorism has led U.S. banks to pose more stringent rules. Syria
is one among “a number” of countries that are facing
difficulties with opening a bank account, according to Payton
Knopf, a spokesman for the U.S. mission to the UN.  “We recognize the impact of these closures, and given our
obligation as host country of the UN, we are working with the
affected missions, relevant U.S. agencies, and the private
sector to find a way to ensure as soon as possible that these
foreign missions have access to the customary banking services
necessary to maintain their operations here in the United
State,” Knopf said in an e-mail.  -- Editors: Terry Atlas, Michael Shepard  To contact the reporters on this story:
