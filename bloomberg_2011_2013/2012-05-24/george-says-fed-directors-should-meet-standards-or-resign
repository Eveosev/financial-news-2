Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City
President Esther George said directors at the Fed’s regional
banks who don’t meet the central bank’s standards for
impartiality should voluntarily resign.  “Bankers should serve,” George said in a statement
released today by the Kansas City Fed. “There are high
standards that apply to Reserve Bank directors, and when an
individual no longer meets these standards, the director resigns
voluntarily to allow someone who does meet the criteria to
serve.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
