Denizbank AS (DENIZ) , the Turkish lender
owned by Belgium’s  Dexia SA (DEXB) , fell after  Russia ’s  OAO Sberbank (SBER) 
was said to be near buying it at a valuation of 1.5 times book
value, below its current level.  The shares dropped as much as 10 percent in Istanbul before
paring losses in the final half hour of trading to close down
0.3 percent at 17.75 liras.  Sberbank, based in Moscow and controlled by the Russian
central bank, and Dexia may sign an “exclusivity agreement” on
the sale of Denizbank as early as tonight, said two people
familiar with the matter who declined to be identified because
the information isn’t public. Sberbank may agree to pay as much
as 1.5 times Denizbank’s book value, said one person close to
the deal. The stock currently trades at 2.61 times  book value ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Though below Denizbank’s current value, Sberbank’s offer
“should be considered as positive for listed banks’
valuations” in  Turkey , according to Hakan Aygun, an analyst at
Ak Invest in Istanbul, the investment arm of Akbank TAS. “The
price multiple reflects the Russian bank’s confidence in the
Turkish banking system.”  The average price-to-book ratio for Turkish banks on the
16-member  Turkish banking index  is 0.94, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Sberbank gained 3.6 percent to 81.57 rubles in Moscow,
paring yesterday’s 4.9 percent drop.  To contact the reporter on this story:
