A German banking association that
represents  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ,  Commerzbank AG (CBK)  and more than 200
other lenders said investors are prepared should Greece leave
the euro area.  “It would be manageable for markets,” Andreas Schmitz,
president of the BdB Association of German Banks told reporters
in Frankfurt yesterday. “The risks have largely been priced in.
A Greek exit would bring lower risks than two years ago but is
not to be underestimated.”  The prospect of Greece leaving the 17-nation euro region
increased after parties opposed to the terms of the country’s
second bailout by the European Union and the  International
Monetary Fund  won most of the votes in May 6 elections. A fresh
round of voting will be held June 17 after politicians failed to
form a government. For the first time since the crisis began in
November 2009, European leaders and central bankers are speaking
openly of  Greece  abandoning the currency union.  The Greek people would suffer “dramatic consequences” if
they were to leave the common currency and the country’s planned
austerity measures can’t be implemented without their support,
according to the president of the Berlin-based BdB. The knock-on
effects for Italy, Ireland, Portugal and Spain are hard to
predict, he said.  Schmitz said he is opposed to joint euro-area debt issuance
before  Europe  pursues greater integration because selling so-
called euro bonds would remove the pressure on member states to
pursue fiscal discipline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
