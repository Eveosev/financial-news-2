Turkey ’s benchmark  ISE National 100
Index (XU100)  fell 1.5 percent to 54,916.61 at the close in Istanbul,
extending its losses in the past two days to 3.8 percent and
heading for its worst week this year.  The following shares were active. Stock symbols are in
parentheses.  Denizbank AS (DENIZ)  , the Turkish lender owned by
Belgium’s  Dexia SA (DEXB) , slid as much as 10 percent before paring its
loss to 0.3 percent to 17.75 liras at the close, after Russia’s
 OAO Sberbank (SBER)  was said to be near buying it at a valuation of 1.5
times book value, below its current valuation of 2.6 times book
value.  Emlak Konut Gayrimenkul (EKGYO)  Ortakligi AS (EKGYO TI) and  Sinpas
Gayrimenkul Yatirim Ortakligi AS (SNGYO)   led Turkish real
estate companies down after the government said it is
considering extending a value-added tax on property sales to
smaller properties. Emlak Konut notched its biggest loss since
August 2011, dropping 5.8 percent to 2.10 liras. Sinpas fell 5.7
percent to 1.15 liras, the biggest decline since November.  The gauge tracking Turkish real estate firms dropped 3.4
percent to 32,385.42.  Goodyear Lastikleri Turk AS (GOODY)  , the Turkish unit of
 Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. (GT) , plunged the most in almost a month,
dropping 8.4 percent to 54.25 liras after saying it will suspend
production at its two plants to stop an inventory build-up
caused by a contraction in demand as a result of the global
economic conditions.  Ozak Gayrimenkul Yatirim Ortakligi (OZKGY)  AS, a Turkish
real-estate investment trust, gained 0.4 percent to 2.58 liras
after signing an agreement with Emlak Konut, the country’s
biggest developer, that is expected to bring in a total of 145
million liras ($79 million) in revenue, according to a statement
to the stock exchange today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
