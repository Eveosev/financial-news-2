Ethanol futures fell to the lowest
price in more than five months in Chicago on cheaper production
costs and ample stockpiles.  Prices sank as corn, the primary feedstock used to make the
biofuel in the U.S., decreased on lackluster overseas  demand  and
after a May 18 Energy Department report showed  supply  surged to
21.4 million barrels, the steepest weekly gain since Jan. 27.  “That’s the wrong direction,” said Mike Blackford, a
consultant at INTL FCStone in  Des Moines ,  Iowa . “You can’t
rebuild the stocks like that.”  Denatured ethanol for June delivery plunged 6.2 cents, or
2.9 percent, to settle at $2.073 a gallon on the Chicago Board
of Trade, the lowest price since Dec. 15.  Corn futures for July delivery fell 25 cents, or 4.1
percent, to close at $5.785 a bushel on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Ethanol has fallen 5.9 percent this year and corn is down
11 percent.  “Anytime corn wants to move, that’s what it’s going to
do,” Blackford said.  In spot market trading, ethanol in  New York  lost 4.5 cents,
or 2 percent, to $2.16 a gallon and in Chicago the additive
decreased 2.5 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $2.095, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf dropped 1.5 cents, or 0.7 percent,
to $2.16 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel increased 1
cent, or 0.4 percent, to $2.35.  To contact the reporter on this story:
