Shares of the following companies had
unusual moves in  Thailand   trading . Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the close in Bangkok.  The  SET Index (SET)  rose 1.4 percent to 1,125.78, snapping a
four-day slide.  PTT Exploration & Production Pcl (PTTEP)  , Thailand’s
only publicly traded oil explorer, gained 3.6 percent to 157
baht, the most since Jan. 4. PTT Exploration, which raised its
offer for Cove Energy Plc to 1.22 billion pounds yesterday, will
receive debt financing of about $1 billion from UBS AG,
according to a person familiar with the matter. UBS has agreed
to underwrite the loan and will syndicate it to other banks, the
person said, asking not to be identified because the details are
private.  Siam Cement Pcl (SCC)  , the country’s largest cement

26. The company will invest about 1.25 billion baht ($39.6
million) to build a new plant in West Java, Indonesia, it said
in a regulatory filing. The plant will produce a lightweight
concrete block to serve the “vibrant construction sector” in
Indonesia, according to the statement.  Siam City Cement Pcl (SCCC)  , the nation’s second-largest
cement producer, advanced 3.5 percent to 296 baht, the steepest
increase since Feb. 8. The company was upgraded to outperform,
the equivalent of buy, from neutral by David Gambrill, an
analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd., who said Thailand’s
construction activity is set to accelerate.  Thai Airways International Pcl (THAI)  , the nation’s
biggest carrier, jumped 5.5 percent to 21.3 baht on speculation
lower  oil prices  will cut its fuel costs. Oil yesterday slid 2.1
percent to $89.90 a barrel in  New York , the lowest close since
Oct. 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
