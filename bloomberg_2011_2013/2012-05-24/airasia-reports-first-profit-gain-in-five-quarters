AirAsia Bhd. (AIRA) ,  Asia ’s biggest discount
carrier, is considering additional orders for Airbus SAS single-
aisle jets after taking delivery of 100 A320s, with another 75
pending, Chief Executive Officer  Tony Fernandes  said.  An agreement would depend on the price Airbus could offer,
Fernandes told journalists while visiting Toulouse in southern
 France  yesterday to receive the airline’s 100th A320. Fernandes
didn’t specify a number of planes. The two sides are negotiating
an order for about 50 aircraft, said a person with direct
knowledge of negotiations who declined to be identified because
the talks are private.  AirAsia, which started with two planes a decade ago, placed
an order last year for 200 of Airbus’s advanced A320neo model,
which promises greater  fuel efficiency  than the current A320
thanks to new engines. The Toulouse-based  planemaker , the
world’s biggest manufacturer of commercial aircraft, won’t begin
delivering the A320neo version until late in 2015.  “I have a sense that we have to advance our order because
we don’t have enough,” Fernandes said. “The big question is
whether we buy more aircraft, whether we lease more aircraft, or
wait for the neo. I don’t think our 175 aircraft is enough till
the neo comes.” Indonesia is one market where he’s looking to
add more planes, he said.  AirAsia  rose  4.1 percent to 3.60 ringgit at the close in
 Kuala Lumpur . Shares of  European Aeronautic, Defence & Space
Co. (EAD) , Airbus’s owner, declined 1.6 percent to 27.55 euros as of
11:33 a.m. in Paris.  Production Increase  Airbus is raising production of the A320 to 42 planes a
month by the end of 2012 from 36 a month in early 2011, and the
company has studied an increase to 44.  Chief Commercial Officer  John Leahy  said yesterday that
Airbus won’t seek that goal at this point. Some suppliers are
struggling with funding and boosting production rates, and Leahy
said it makes no sense to increase further the number of A320s
being built as the company gets closer to delivering A320neos.  The planemaker currently produces single-aisle models at
factories in Hamburg, Toulouse and Tianjin, China, where an
assembly plant built in 2008 will reach production of four
planes a month by the end of this year.  A320s assembled in Tianjin had been planned for use only by
Chinese airlines. Fernandes said Sepang, Malaysia-based AirAsia,
which flies to Tianjin, will be the first non-Chinese carrier to
accept delivery from the plant, with a A320 scheduled to join
its fleet in December.  Leahy said yesterday that Airbus expects to receive another
order from  China  for at least 100 single-aisle planes by the end
of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
