The  International Monetary Fund  may
join a committee advising consultants on a  stress test  on
Spanish lenders,  El Pais  reported, citing unidentified people
familiar with the matter.  Representatives of some euro-region national central banks
and the European Banking Authority may also join the committee,
the newspaper said. The European Central Bank is interested on
taking part in the process as well, El Pais said, citing a
remark by Economy Ministry Luis de Guindos last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
