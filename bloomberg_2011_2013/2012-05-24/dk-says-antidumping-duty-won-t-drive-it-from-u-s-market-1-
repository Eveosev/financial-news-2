LDK Solar Co. (LDK) , the world’s fourth-
largest maker of solar cells, said the advent of  import duties 
in the U.S. for its photovoltaic devices won’t drive the Chinese
company away from the market.  “We will continue to deliver high-quality PV products at
competitive prices to our customers in the  United States ,” Sam Tong, president and chief operating officer, said today in a
filing by the company based in Xinyu, in Jiangxi province.  LDK said it expects to be part of the “separate rates
group” subject to a preliminary antidumping tariff rate of 31
percent, in the filing. That’s at the low end of a range that
extends to 250 percent to be imposed on Chinese imports if the
measure receives final approval later this year, LDK said.  The U.S. government announced the plan last week after the
Commerce Department ruled that Chinese manufacturers sold cells
in the U.S. at prices below the cost of production.  China 
criticized the action, saying the U.S. is hurting itself and
cooperation between the world’s two largest economies.  Chinese price competition and excess production capacity
for solar products has crushed share prices in the past year for
many solar-equipment companies, including Chinese. The 17-member
Bloomberg Large Solar Energy index that includes LDK has fallen
about 74 percent in the past year.  LDK, which lost 55 percent in the period, the second-best
performance, is the fourth-largest solar-cell maker by factory
capacity, tied with Yingli Green Energy Holding Co., according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the editors responsible for this story:
