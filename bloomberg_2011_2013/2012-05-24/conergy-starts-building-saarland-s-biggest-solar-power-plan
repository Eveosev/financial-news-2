Conergy AG (CGYK) , a Hamburg-based solar-
panel maker, won an order from the family behind ceramics maker
Villeroy & Boch to develop what will be the biggest solar power
plant in the German state of Saarland.  The 10.5-megawatt project, for which construction is to
start today, will use Conergy modules, racks and inverters, the
company said in an emailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
