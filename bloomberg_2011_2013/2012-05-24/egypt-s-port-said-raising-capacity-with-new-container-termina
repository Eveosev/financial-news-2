million), will increase the terminal’s annual capacity to 7
million containers from 4 million, Transport Minister Galal El-
Saeed said in the statement.  Egypt plans to increase the port’s capacity to 11 million
containers a year over the next four years, El-Saeed said  To contact the reporter on this story:
