Royal Bank of Canada , the country’s
largest lender, said second-quarter profit rose 4.9 percent on
higher Canadian  consumer lending  and increased trading revenue.  Profit from continuing operations excluding a loss tied to
buying out its RBC Dexia Investor Services partner rose to
C$1.77 billion ($1.73 bilion), or C$1.15 a share, the Toronto-
based lender said in a statement. That compares with profit of
C$1.68 billion, or C$1.10 a share, in the year-earlier period.  Higher earnings from Canadian  consumer banking  on growth in
deposits, mortgages and business loans, as well as a 26 percent
increase in trading revenue helped lift profit after excluding
results from its U.S. lending unit sold in March.  Including the C$202 million acquisition loss from buying a
50 percent stake in RBC Dexia, Royal Bank said profit for the
period ended April 30 fell 7 percent to C$1.56 billion, or
C$1.01 a share. That’s down from C$1.68 billion, or C$1.10 a
share, a year earlier.  Royal Bank said it earned C$1.17 a share excluding items,
missing the C$1.18-a-share average  estimate  of 15 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News on that measure.  The bank said April 3 that the majority of the loss from
its C$1.1 billion takeover of the RBC Dexia stake from Banque
Internationale a Luxembourg SA would be taken in the second
quarter. Continuing operations excludes the Raleigh, North
Carolina-based RBC Bank, which Royal Bank sold to PNC Financial
Services Group Inc.  Bad Loans  Net income fell 6.2 percent to C$1.53 billion, or 99 cents,
from C$1.63 billion, or C$1.06 a share, in the year-earlier
period, according to financial statements.  Royal Bank set aside C$348 million for bad loans, 27
percent higher than a year ago.  Canadian banking profit rose 4.7 percent to C$937 million,
from C$895 million a year ago, on growth of deposits, mortgages
and business loans. International banking, which includes RBC
Dexia and Caribbean banking, had a net loss of C$196 million
after the acquisition costs.  The RBC Capital Markets investment-banking business rose 11
percent to C$449 million, on higher trading and corporate and
investment banking. Trading revenue across the bank rose to
C$761 million from C$602 million a year ago, led by trading of
equities and  interest rate  and credit securities.  Wealth management profit fell 6.6 percent to C$212 million,
while insurance rose 23 percent to C$151 million on volume
growth and lower claims costs on Canadian insurance products.  (Royal Bank will hold a conference call to discuss results
