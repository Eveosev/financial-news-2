Shares of the following companies had
 unusual  moves in  China  trading. Stock symbols are in parentheses
as of the close.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) , which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, fell 12.46 points, or 0.5 percent, to
2,350.97. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  declined 0.8 percent to 2,595.26.  Railway-related stocks: China Railway Erju Co. (600528 CH)
surged 4.1 percent to 6.67  yuan , the highest level since Nov.
14.  China Railway Construction Corp. (601186)  (601186 CH), builder of
more than half the nation’s rail links since 1949, advanced 1.1
percent to 4.53 yuan.  China will start a series of “key infrastructure projects
that are vital to the overall economy and can facilitate
growth” and speed up construction of existing railway,
environmental protection and rural projects, the government said
on its website yesterday, summarizing a meeting of the State
Council, or Cabinet.  Shanghai Pharmaceuticals Holding Co. (601607)  (601607 CH), China’s
second-largest drug distributor, lost 0.7 percent to 10.67 yuan
after plunging by the 10 percent daily limit yesterday. The
stock closed at the lowest since Jan. 16.  A written notice will be given once the investigation, by
the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the China Securities Regulatory
Commission, is almost complete, the 21st Century Business Herald
reported today, citing an unidentified high-level executive at
Shanghai Pharma. The drug seller said late yesterday it hadn’t
received any notice from either regulatory body, in response to
a report by the same newspaper that it was being probed.  Lu Di, an official with Shanghai Pharma’s board office,
declined to comment on today’s report when reached by telephone.
The company has nothing to add to the statement issued last
night, Lu said.  --Zhang Shidong. Editor: Allen Wan  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
