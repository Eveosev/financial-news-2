The Treasury sold notes at a record-
low auction yield for a second consecutive day as  Europe ’s debt
crisis underscored the status of U.S. government debt as the
preferred refuge.  The $29 billion seven-year note sale drew a yield of 1.203
percent, compared with the previous record of 1.347 percent at
the April 26 auction. Yesterday’s five-year note sale also drew
an all-time low yield, as the U.S. borrows at historically low
costs even as marketable Treasuries exceed $10 trillion, a more-
than doubling since 2007. Benchmark 10-year yields  rose  today as
Federal Reserve Bank of New York President  William Dudley  said
he doesn’t currently see the need for additional stimulus.  “There is a tremendous demand for Treasuries amid strong
 risk aversion  as problems in Europe don’t seem to be getting
better and the concern grows about the potential of dipping back
into recession” said  Jay Mueller , who manages about $3 billion
of bonds at Wells Capital Management in  Milwaukee . “There are a
lot of bad things happening and people are looking for a place
to hide. This stuff is just so unpredictable.”  The yield on the current seven-year note rose four basis
point, or 0.04 percentage point, to 1.19 percent, at 4:59 p.m.
in New York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader Prices.  The benchmark 10-year yield climbed four basis points to
1.78 percent. The 1.75 percent security due in May 2022 fell
3/8, or $3.75 per $1,000 face amount, to 99 3/4. The yield
touched 1.71 percent, approaching the record low 1.6714 percent
set Sept. 23.  Holiday Hours  The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association
 recommended  that trading of Treasuries end tomorrow at 2 p.m.
 New York  time and fixed-income markets close May 28 in
observance of the Memorial Day Holiday.  Today’s seven-year note sale yield matched the forecast of
1.203 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of eight of the Fed’s
primary dealers. The bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by
comparing total bids with the amount of securities offered, was
2.80, compared with an average of 2.83 for the previous 10
sales.  Indirect bidders, an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 42.7 percent of the notes, compared
with an average of 40.3 percent for the past 10 sales.  Direct bidders, non-primary dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 15.7 percent of
the notes, compared with an average of 13.6 percent at the past
10 auctions.  Debt Returns  Treasuries maturing in seven years have returned 2.5
percent this year after returning 14 percent in 2011, according
to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The overall Treasury
market has gained 1.4 percent this year after gaining 9.8
percent in 2011.  This week’s note offerings, combined with the May 17
auction of $13 billion in 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected
Securities, will raise $52.9 billion of new cash, as maturing
securities held by the public total $59.1 billion.  The three U.S. note auctions this week totaled $99 billion.
The Treasury sold $35 billion of five-year debt yesterday at a
record low yield of 0.748 percent, and the same amount of two-
year securities on May 22 at 0.3 percent.  Primary dealer  holdings  of  U.S. government debt  rose to
$108 billion, the highest ever, as of May 16, from a net bet
against the securities of $11.9 billion in September, according
to the Fed.  Historically low  interest rates  have allowed President
 Barack Obama ’s administration to finance three years of budget
deficits exceeding $1 trillion without igniting price increases.  While the amount of marketable Treasuries outstanding has
more than doubled to $10.3 trillion from $4.4 trillion in mid-
2007, debt expense equaled 3 percent of the economy in fiscal
2011 ended Sept. 30, down from 4 percent in 1999, when the U.S.
ran budget surpluses.  Dudley’s View  “The economy, I think generally, is healing, but very
slowly,” Dudley said in an interview with CNBC, according to
its website. “If we continue to see improvement in the economy,
in terms of using up the slack in available resources, then I
think it’s hard to argue that we absolutely must do something
more in terms of the monetary policy front.”  The Fed will hold its policy meeting next month. The U.S.
central bank bought $2.3 trillion of bonds in two rounds of
quantitative easing from December 2008 to June 2011 to boost the
economy.  “If that’s the case, it would be a bit of a disappointment
to the market,” said Tom Tucci, managing director and head of
Treasury trading in New York at CIBC World Markets Corp.,
referring to Dudley’s comments. “We still have another month of
the European crisis and economic data to get through and those
things can still change.”  Fed Buys  The central bank bought $1.8 billion of Treasuries due from
February 2036 to August 2041 today, according to the Fed Bank of
New York’s  website . The purchases are part of the central bank’s
program to replace $400 billion of shorter-term debt in its
holdings with longer maturities by the end of June to support
the economy.  Bill Gross , co-chief investment officer and founder of
 Newport Beach , California-based Pacific Investment Management
Co., commented on monetary policy in a Twitter post.  “Fed’s Dudley less dovish,” he wrote. “QE III now.
Depends on Euroland, inflation & jobs. 50/50.”  Treasuries have rallied since March on speculation Greece
will abandon the euro as it combats a recession, leading other
nations in the currency bloc to consider doing the same.  Volatility rose yesterday to 73.7 basis points from 70.8
basis points the previous day, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch’s MOVE index, which measures Treasury price swings
based on options. The gauge is below the one-year average of
87.9 basis points.  Trading Trends  Trading volume  rose yesterday above the 2012 average of
$242 billion. About $280 billion of Treasuries changed hands
through ICAP Plc, the world’s largest interdealer broker. Volume
reached $439 billion on March 14, the highest since August.  Germany  has “huge difficulties” with  France ’s call for
joint borrowing by euro governments,  Chancellor Angela Merkel 
told reporters in Brussels early today after six hours of talks.
European leaders also called on  Greece  to stick with budget cuts
needed to stay in the euro.  The yield touched a 2012 high of 2.4 percent on March 20
and a low of 1.69 percent on May 17.  Ten-year yields will increase to 2.45 percent by year-end,
according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg survey of
financial companies with the most recent projections given the
heaviest weightings.  To contact the reporters on this story:
