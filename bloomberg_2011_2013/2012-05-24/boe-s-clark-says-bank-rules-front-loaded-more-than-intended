Bank of England  interim Financial
Policy Committee member Alastair Clark said policy makers may
have ended up “front-loading” new rules more than planned in
an environment that remains threatening.  “In our international regulatory initiatives, we may
inadvertently have ended up front-loading the regulatory
response more than was intended,” Clark said in a speech in
 London  today. “Even though, for example, extended timetables
were set for the implementation of Basel III, once the end point
was announced market pressures have tended to foreshorten the
effective period of adjustment.”  Clark said that doesn’t alter the direction taken by
regulators, as “there are clearly still significant
vulnerabilities in the international banking system and the
environment remains very threatening.”  “There is always the risk that, if too relaxed a
timetable is adopted, the commitment to reform will
progressively evaporate,” he said.  Global regulators’ tougher capital requirements, known as
Basel III, could see the world’s biggest banks raise about $566
billion of common equity to meet rules by 2019, analysts at
 Fitch Ratings  said on May 17. The Basel group agreed in 2010 to
more than triple the core capital that lenders must hold, as
well to make them hold minimum stocks of easy-to-sell assets.  Clark also said the FPC needs to explain more fully how it
intends “to strike the right balance between, on the one hand,
encouraging banks to strengthen their financial position and, on
the other, avoiding any undue constraint on the availability of
credit.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
