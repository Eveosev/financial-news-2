Raiffeisen Bank International AG (RBI)  has
“several billion” euros in extra cash in case the Greek crisis
triggers bank runs in Balkan nations like Romania or Bulgaria,
where both the Austrian lender and Greek banks are active.  Raiffeisen has boosted its liquidity buffer to 25 billion
euros ($31.4 billion), Chief Financial Officer Martin Gruell
told journalists in Vienna today. That’s several billion euros
more than it was before the Greek debt crisis accelerated last
year, Gruell said. He declined to be more specific.  “We have massively increased liquidity,” Chief Executive
Officer Herbert Stepic said at the same press conference. While
Raiffeisen hasn’t lent to Greece or Greek banks, “what
everybody is afraid of is that the private savers are becoming
unsettled, that they knock at the door and want to see their
money.”  Greek banks including  EFG Eurobank Ergasias SA (EUROB) ,  Alpha Bank
AE (ALPHA)  and  Piraeus Bank SA (TPEIR)  own subsidiaries in Romania, Bulgaria,
 Serbia , Albania and Macedonia, where they compete with Austria’s
Raiffeisen and  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  and Italian-based  UniCredit
SpA (UCG)  and  Intesa Sanpaolo SA. (ISP)   Stepic said he saw the odds for a Greek euro exit at 50-50.
He’s “significantly more relaxed” about the risks of an exit,
because the emergency measures by the European Union and the
 European Central Bank  have “ring-fenced” other nations in the
currency union during the last year, he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
