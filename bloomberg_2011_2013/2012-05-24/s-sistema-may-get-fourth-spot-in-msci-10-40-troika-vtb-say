OAO Mobile TeleSystems,  Russia ’s
biggest mobile-phone operator, and AFK Sistema, its controlling
shareholder, may be ranked together with the fourth-biggest
weighting in  MSCI Inc. (MSCI) ’s Russia 10/40 index, Troika Dialog and
VTB Capital said.  OAO Rosneft, the country’s largest oil producer, OAO
Novatek, the second-biggest natural gas company, and potash
maker OAO Uralkali may also see their weighting increased in
MSCI’s review tomorrow, according to Troika.  “MSCI looks at the free float of both parent and
subsidiary companies,”  Ovanes Oganisian , a strategist at Troika
Dialog in Moscow, said by phone. “Currently MTS-Sistema’s free
float is the fourth-biggest, slightly ahead of Rosneft.”  About $750 million of capital inflows will be available for
the company in fourth position on the Russia 10/40, Oganisian
said. The rebalancing will take place on May 25 and the changes
come into effect May 31, according to MSCI.  MTS has gained 4.9 percent since posting a 59 percent
first-quarter profit jump on May 21.  “MTS’s better-than-estimated earnings boosted the stock,
making it the main candidate for fourth place on the index,”
Ilya Piterskiy, an analyst at VTB in Moscow, said by phone.  Rosneft had been the leading candidate for the number-four
spot until MSCI canceled its decision to increase its weighting
in the separate  Russia Index (MXRU)  on May 21, Oganisian said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
