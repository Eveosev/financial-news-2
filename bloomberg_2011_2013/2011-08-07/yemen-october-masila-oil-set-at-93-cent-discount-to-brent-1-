Yemen raised the price for October
shipments of Masila Blend oil, cutting the grade’s discount to
93 cents a barrel less than European benchmark Brent crude, from
a $1.47 discount in September, the state oil committee said.  Marib Light crude, which resumed production last month, was
priced at parity to Brent, with the differential unchanged since
July 2010, according to an e-mailed statement today.  Yemen will sell all 3 million barrels of Masila Blend
available for October to Arcadia, the state oil committee said
in the e-mail. Aden Oil Refinery Co. will buy all 2 million
barrels of Marib Light production planned for October and all
output for August and September.  Yemen’s main refinery resumed processing crude last month
after the first oil began flowing through the Marib pipeline
since tribesmen blew up the link in March, an attack that
triggered a nationwide fuel shortage. The pipeline closure and
resulting halt in production at two fields in Marib prevented
the Aden refinery, with its processing capacity of 150,000
barrels a day, from making enough fuel to meet domestic demand.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
