Israel ’s benchmark stock index
plunged the most in almost 11 years after  Standard & Poor’s 
lowered the U.S. credit rating and amid concern the widening
sovereign debt crisis in Europe will stall global growth.  Israel Discount Bank Ltd. (DSCT) , the country’s third-largest
lender, skidded 10 percent.  Nice Systems Ltd. (NICE)  slumped the most
since November 2008. All 25 shares in the TA-25 Index tumbled,
pushing the gauge down 7 percent, the biggest decline since
October 2000, to 1,074.27 at the 4:30 p.m. close in  Tel Aviv .
The index is near the so-called bear-market territory after
retreating 19.9 percent from a record high of 1,341.89 on April
21.  “It could be a turbulent market in the next few weeks,”
said Ron Eichel, chief economist and strategist at Meitav
Investment House Ltd. in Tel Aviv. “If there’s a storm
globally, it’s going to affect Israel, which has very large
exports to the U.S. and the eurozone.”  S&P cut the AAA credit rating of the U.S. to AA+ on Aug. 5,
while keeping the outlook at “negative.” S&P on Aug. 2 placed
Israel’s AAA rating on U.S.-guaranteed sovereign bonds on
“CreditWatch.” The  European Central Bank  left  interest rates 
unchanged on Aug. 4 as economic growth slows and the region’s
debt crisis spreads to Italy and Spain.  Slower Growth  The Bank of Israel on Aug. 2 cut its economic growth
forecasts for this year and next, saying debt reduction plans in
developed countries may lead to a global slowdown. The economy
will expand 4.8 percent in 2011 and 3.9 percent in 2012, the
bank said, lowering its forecasts from 5.2 percent and 4.2
percent, respectively.  Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz yesterday called the
downgrade a “warning sign” for Israel’s economy. Supervisor of
Banks David Zaken said today the downgrade “underlines the need
to be prepared for scenarios that if we talked about them a few
years ago, would have seemed impossible.”  Discount slumped the most since October 2008 to 5.44
shekels. Nice, a maker of digital surveillance and monitoring
systems, plummeted 9.8 percent to 101.80 shekels.  Government bonds  fell for the first time in a week. The
yield on the benchmark 5 percent Mimshal Shiklit due January
2020 increased the most since June, rising five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 4.95 percent. The Tel-Bond 40 Index of
corporate bonds retreated 3.3 percent, the most since November
2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
