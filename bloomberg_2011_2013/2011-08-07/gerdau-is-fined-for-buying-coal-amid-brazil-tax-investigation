Gerdau SA (GGBR4) , Latin America’s largest
steelmaker, said it was fined 337,000 reais ($213,819) amid a
Brazil tax investigation involving coal purchases by
steelmakers.  Gerdau is “investigating the matter,” the Porto Alegre-
based company said in an e-mailed statement. The company wasn’t
specific about details of the investigation. The fine was
imposed by tax authorities in Minas Gerais state, Brazil,  O
Globo  reported.  About 34 companies in Brazil bought coal from illegally
deforested areas, said O Globo, a Rio de Janeiro-based
newspaper, citing Paulo Cesar Lima, a Minas Gerais prosecutor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
