Investec Plc (INVP) , the private bank and
wealth manager bidding to buy  Evolution Group Plc (EVG) , will begin
“detailed discussions” with the British brokerage this week,
The Sunday Times reported without saying where it got the
information.  While the parties haven’t agreed on a price yet, the value
of the deal focuses on Evolution’s wealth-management business,
the newspaper said. Investec won’t place a value on Evolution’s
securities unit, which reported a loss in the first half,
according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
