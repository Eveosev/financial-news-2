Trinity Mirror Plc (TNI) , publisher of the
U.K.’s Daily Mirror newspaper, is being urged to find a merger
partner by its investors, including Aviva Plc, the Sunday Times
said.  Aviva, the second-largest shareholder of Trinity Mirror
with a 10 percent stake, believes consolidation in regional
newspaper industry is necessary, the Sunday Times said. The
company is under pressure to revive its share price, which fell
by two-thirds in the past year on declining advertising revenue,
according to the newspaper.  Merger plans with  Daily Mail  and General Trust Plc’s local
media division Northcliffe Media collapsed last year because of
price disagreements, the Sunday Times said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
