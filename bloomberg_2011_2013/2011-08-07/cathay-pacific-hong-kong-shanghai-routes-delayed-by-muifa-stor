Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. (293)  said
Typhoon Muifa delayed three of its  China  flights today.  One flight departing Hong Kong for Shanghai, and two
flights from Shanghai to Hong Kong have been  delayed , according
to spokeswoman Elin Wong. Cathay announced the delays in a
statement last night.  The airline plans to resume normal service this afternoon,
subject to weather conditions, according to the statement.  China evacuated more than 430,000 residents in Shanghai and
nearby coastal areas ahead of Typhoon Muifa, possibly the
strongest storm to hit the country this year, the Xinhua News
Agency reported yesterday.  Cathay Pacific is waiving rebooking fees for flights to and
from airports in Shanghai Pudong, Shanghai Hongqiao, Hangzhou,
Ningbo and Nanjing between Aug. 6 and Aug. 8, it said in the
release.  To contact the reporter on this story:
