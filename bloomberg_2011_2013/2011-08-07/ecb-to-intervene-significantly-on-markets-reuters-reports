The  European Central Bank  will
intervene decisively on financial markets in response to the
worsening debt crisis, Reuters quoted an unidentified euro-area
monetary official as saying.  ECB policy makers considered carefully the situation in
Italy and  Spain  during a conference call today, Reuters quoted
the official as saying. The ECB’s response will be “significant
and cohesive,” and a statement will be issued shortly, the
official said, according to Reuters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
