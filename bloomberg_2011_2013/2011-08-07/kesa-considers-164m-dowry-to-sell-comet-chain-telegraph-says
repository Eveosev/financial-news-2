Kesa Electricals Plc (KESA) ,  Europe â€™s third-
largest electronics retailer, is lining up a possible dowry of
as much as 100 million pounds ($164 million) in order to sell
its unprofitable U.K. Comet chain, the Sunday Telegraph said.  The potential for a dowry will be flagged by the London-
based company as the second round of the auction continues, the
Sunday Telegraph said, citing participants of the process.  The exact size of the dowry is expected to be discussed at
a series of meetings between Kesa management and bidders by the
end of the month, according to the report.  Three bidders, including private equity group OpCapita,
have been taken through to the second round of the auction, the
Sunday Telegraph said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
