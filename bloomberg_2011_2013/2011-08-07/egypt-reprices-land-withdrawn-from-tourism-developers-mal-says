Egypt â€™s Tourism Development Authority
has set $5 to $12 as the new price range per square meter of
land withdrawn from developers of tourist areas,  Al Mal  reported
citing an unidentified official at the authority.  The tourism agency will return the land to the developers
if they agree to pay the new rate, the newspaper reported. Land
plots belonging to 179 companies were withdrawn because less
than 1 percent of each of them had been developed,  Al Mal  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
