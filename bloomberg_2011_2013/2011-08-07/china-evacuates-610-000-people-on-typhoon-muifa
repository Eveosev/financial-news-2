China  evacuated more than 610,000
residents in Shanghai and nearby coastal areas, and docked
62,700 vessels ahead of Typhoon Muifa, the ninth such storm to
hit the country this year, the Xinhua News Agency reported.  The typhoon, bringing gusts up to 178 kilometres per hour,
is moving at 25 kilometers per hour toward the coast of eastern
Shandong Province, where it is expected to land tommorow
morning, Xinhua said today, citing the National Meteorological
Center.  The typhoon may weaken into a tropical storm as it makes
landfall in Shandong, Xinhua said, quoting the local weather
forecast bureau. Eighteen flights departing or arriving at
Qingdao airport, on the coast of Shandong, were canceled today.
Most of the canceled flights were headed for southern cities
such as  Shanghai  or Hangzhou.  About 190 flights have been canceled since yesterday in
Shanghaiâ€™s two airports, and two major sea bridges linking the
urban area to outlying islands were closed, according to Xinhua.  --Victoria Ruan. Editors: Cherian Thomas  To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:
