German banks are in good shape to
weather the European debt crisis, the head of the country’s FMSA
bank-rescue fund told  Handelsblatt  in an interview.  “There’s no cause for concern regarding concrete,
individual banks in the finance industry,” Christopher Pleister
is cited by the newspaper as saying. Should the debt crisis
worsen, the fund is ready to step in and rescue lenders, he
said.  The Financial Market Stabilization Agency was formed in
2008 and is a unit of the  Finance Ministry , according to its
 website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
