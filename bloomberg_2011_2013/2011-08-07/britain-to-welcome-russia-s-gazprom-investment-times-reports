Britain will welcome interest in the
country’s energy industry by Russian natural gas producer OAO
Gazprom, the Sunday Times reported, citing Energy Minister
 Charles Hendry .  The U.K. won’t try to stop Gazprom from investing in
British power stations, the newspaper cited Hendry as saying.
Britain is seeking energy investment from around the world and
it would see it beneficial if Gazprom invests or partners other
companies in the industry, Hendry said, according to the Sunday
Times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
