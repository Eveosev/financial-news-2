Mauritius’s ruling alliance split as
the Mouvement Socialiste Militant party left the coalition, its
leader and former Finance Minister Pravind Jugnauth said.  “We no longer form part of the ruling alliance,” Jugnauth
told reporters in  Port Louis  today. “There was a total absence
of team spirit.”  Jugnauth said the situation had become “unbearable” for
his party, which will now be part of the opposition.  Jugnauth and five other ministers resigned on July 26.  A cabinet reshuffle was announced yesterday. Xavier-Luc
Duval was named the new finance minister. Jangbahadoorsing
Seetaram, a former official in the Mouvement Socialiste
Mauritius party, was named to the 23-member cabinet to oversee
companies and cooperatives.  Four of the new ministers were sworn in today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
