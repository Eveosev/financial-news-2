European Central Bank Executive Board
Member Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Paramo said Eurobonds aren’t the
right solution to the European sovereign-debt crisis now and
that markets must be told investors won’t be asked to
participate in another rescue plan after  Greece .  “Each country needs to have its own situation sorted out
before it can issue Eurobonds,” Gonzalez-Paramo said in an
interview with Spanish newspaper La Voz de Galicia, to be
published today. “Neither are Eurobonds an ideal solution, nor
are they a priority,”  Gonzalez-Paramo said the private investors’ participation
agreed on by European Union leaders on July 21 is a one-time
plan, due to the seriousness and specificity of Greece’s debt.  “It is necessary to explain to the markets that there
won’t be another case when private investors will be asked to
help find a solution,” he said.  Gonzalez-Paramo also said  Europe  has a serious problem with
ratings firms, whose analysis is often wrong and based on pure
conjectures rather than on facts.  The U.S. government said  Standard & Poor’s  decision to
downgrade its  credit rating  from the highest possible level was
flawed by a $2 trillion error. S&P lowered the U.S.’s AAA grade
one level to AA+, citing politicians’ failure to enact a
credible deficit-reduction plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
