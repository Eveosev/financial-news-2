Telstra Corp.,  Australia ’s biggest
phone carrier, plans to introduce its fourth-generation wireless
broadband system to businesses in Melbourne, Sydney and  Brisbane 
and start selling the commercial device later this month.  Telstra switched on its first 4G base stations using so-
called Long Term Evolution technology in May, the company said
in an e-mailed statement. Around 2,000 Telstra USB 4G mobile
broadband modems will be made available to business and
enterprise customers from Aug. 29 before the national rollout of
4G services later this year, Chief Executive Officer David Thodey said in the statement.  Telstra announced in February it will cooperate with
Ericsson AB for the new broadband product, which it said won’t
conflict with Australia’s fixed-line National Broadband Network.
The planned A$43 billion ($44.9 billion) government-owned
network is to connect to 93 percent of Australia’s population by
2018.  Melbourne-based Telstra has been cutting prices for
wireless broadband to tap demand for  Internet access  through
Apple Inc. iPads and other tablet computers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
