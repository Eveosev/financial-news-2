Jefferies & Co. said most of its
customers have no plans to change their holdings of Treasuries
or agency debt after  Standard & Poor’s  downgraded the U.S.
credit rating.  “We are skeptical that the downgrade will be a big deal 24
hours from now,”  Ward McCarthy  and Thomas Simons, economists
for the company in  New York , wrote in a report to clients.  Still, agency yields are likely to rise compared with
Treasury rates as a result of the downgrade, the economists
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
