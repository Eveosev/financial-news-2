Gerdau SA (GGBR4)  was fined 337,000 reais
($213,819) for buying coal extracted from deforested land in
Brazil,  O Globo  reported, citing an e-mailed company statement.  About 34 companies in Brazil bought coal from illegally
deforested areas, the Rio de Janeiro-based newspaper said,
citing Paulo Cesar Lima, a Minas Gerais state prosecutor.  Gerdau’s press office didn’t immediately return a phone
call and e-mail from Bloomberg News seeking comment on the fine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
