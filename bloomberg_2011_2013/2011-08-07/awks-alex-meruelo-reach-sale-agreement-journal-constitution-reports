The  Atlanta Hawks  reached an
agreement with Alex Meruelo over the sale of a majority stake in
the National Basketball Association club, the  Atlanta Journal-
Constitution  said.  Meruelo has a signed agreement that also includes the
operating rights to Philips Arena, the newspaper said, citing
the 48-year-old Los Angeles businessman. The sale will be
officially announced tomorrow, it said.  Meruelo is the founder and owner of a company that holds
pizza restaurants, construction companies, a casino and a
television station, the report said.  Some members of the current ownership, Atlanta Spirit LLC,
will retain minority stakes, Meruelo told the newspaper.  The Spirit group bought the Hawks,  Atlanta Thrashers  of the
 National Hockey League  and Philips Arena from Time Warner Inc.
for $250 million in 2004. In May, the Spirit Group completed the
sale of the Thrashers to a group that moved the team to Winnipeg
and renamed them the Jets.  Hawks spokesman Arthur Triche didn’t immediately answer an
e-mail seeking comment on the report. Ruben Gonzalez, a
spokesman for Meruelo Group, didn’t immediately return a
voicemail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
