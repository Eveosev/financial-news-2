Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero plans to remain on vacation until August 18,
though he will continue to monitor debt markets and will return
to  Madrid  if needed, said a spokeswoman who declined to be named
in line with government policy.  Zapatero will be in the southern region of Andalusia, a
spokeswoman for the premierâ€™s office said today by phone.
Zapatero resumed his summer holiday late Aug. 5. He had
interrupted it hours after leaving Madrid on Aug. 2, to respond
to a surge in Spanish borrowing costs to a euro-era record.  To contact the reporter on this story:
