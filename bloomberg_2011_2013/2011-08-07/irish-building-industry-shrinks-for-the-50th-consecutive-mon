Ireland’s building industry
contracted in July for the 50th month in a row, an index showed.
The Ulster Bank Construction PMI index rose to 42.1 from 40.5 in
June, Ulster Bank Ltd. said in a monthly report published today.
A reading below 50 indicates contraction.  “Near-term prospects continue to be hampered by a dearth
of new business, as new orders registered an eleventh
consecutive monthly fall,” Simon Barry, chief economist for the
 Republic of Ireland  at Ulster, said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
