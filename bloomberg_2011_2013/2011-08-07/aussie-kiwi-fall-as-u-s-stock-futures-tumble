Australia ’s dollar dropped for an
eighth day versus its U.S. counterpart in its longest slump in
almost a decade as concern the global economy is slowing sapped
demand for higher-yielding assets.  The Aussie sank to the weakest level against the yen since
March after  Standard & Poor’s  on Aug. 5 cut the U.S. long-term
credit rating from the highest level, AAA, and global stocks
tumbled.  New Zealand ’s currency fell for the fifth time in six
days after prices tumbled for commodities tumbled.  “People are looking at the global growth scenario, which
is not going to be pretty under any path that the U.S. follows
after the downgrade,” said Alex Sinton, a senior dealer at ANZ
National Bank Ltd. in Auckland. “It is a risk-off day.”  Australia’s dollar weakened 1 percent to $1.0343 at 12:46
p.m. in  New York , from $1.0442 on Aug. 5, after dropping to as
low as $1.0301, the least since April 5. It capped the longest
losing streak since the eight days ended Sept. 21, 2001 in the
wake of the Sept. 11 terror attacks on the U.S. The Aussie fell
2 percent to 80.24 yen, from 81.87 yen, and touched 80.02, the
lowest since March 21.  New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, slid 1.4 percent
to 83.13 U.S. cents and reached 82.55 cents, the weakest since
July 13. The kiwi dropped 2.4 percent to 64.51 yen and touched
64.14, the lowest level in more than two months.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index tumbled 3.8 percent, and
the MSCI Asia Pacific index of regional shares dropped 2.5
percent. The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw
materials fell 1.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
