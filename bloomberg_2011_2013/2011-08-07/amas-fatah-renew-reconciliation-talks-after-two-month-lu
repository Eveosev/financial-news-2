Representatives of Palestinian
Authority President Mahmoud Abbasâ€™s Fatah party and the Hamas
Islamic movement held reconciliation talks in Cairo for the
first time in almost two months.  The sides met last night and were planning another session
today, Azzam al-Ahmad, head of the Fatah delegation, told Voice
of Palestine Radio. The last round broke off June 14 over a
dispute about Prime Minister Salam Fayyad, whom Hamas is seeking
to replace.  Leaders of Fatah, the secular group that rules the  West
Bank , and Hamas, which controls the  Gaza Strip , signed an
agreement in Cairo on May 4 to set up a joint interim government
that would serve for a year and pave the way for new elections.
Hamas is considered a terrorist organization by  Israel , the U.S.
and European Union.  To contact the reporters on this story:
