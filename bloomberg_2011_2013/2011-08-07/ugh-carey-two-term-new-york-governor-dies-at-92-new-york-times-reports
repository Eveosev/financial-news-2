Hugh Carey, the two-term New York
governor who helped  New York City  avert bankruptcy in 1975 by
imposing financial controls and made tough choices to cut taxes
and balance the state budget, has died, the New York Times
reported. He was 92.  A Democrat who served in Congress as a representative from
the New York borough of Brooklyn, Carey made financial
discipline a priority from his first days after taking over as
governor in 1975. Declaring that New York state had been
“living far beyond our means,” he told the legislature in his
first State of the State speech that “the days of wine and
roses are over.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
