Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said European governments need to get their “fiscal
house” in order and provide a financial backstop for economies
under pressure.  “What  Europe  needs to do is to make sure that there’s an
unequivocal financial backstop,” Geithner said, according to
the transcript of an interview with NBC and CNBC television
today. “So there is no doubt in anyone’s mind that those
countries have the ability and the will to meet their
obligations. That’s essential to managing crises.”  “I’m confident you’re going to see them step up and
provide more forceful support for the countries under so much
pressure,” Geithner said. “They need to make sure that there’s
stronger economic growth, that those governments are getting
their fiscal house in order.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
