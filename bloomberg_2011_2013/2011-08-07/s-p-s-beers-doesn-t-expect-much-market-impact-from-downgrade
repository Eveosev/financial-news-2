Financial markets probably won’t
react significantly to the Aug. 5 decision by  Standard & Poor’s 
to downgrade the U.S. credit rating, said  David Beers , S&P’s
managing director of sovereign ratings.  “Based on historical experience we wouldn’t expect that
much financial impact,” Beers said today on the “Fox News
Sunday” program. “The markets are reacting to a lot of
factors, not just what S&P said on Friday,” Beers said, noting
concern among investors that global economic growth may slow.  S&P said in a statement with the downgrade that the U.S.
political system failed to adequately address deficit reduction
in the compromise law that President  Barack Obama  signed Aug. 2
to avert a U.S. default on its debt.  The U.S. Treasury Department issued a statement saying S&P
had acknowledged an “error” in its calculations, making a $2
trillion mistake. The rating company then changed the rational
for its decision, raising “fundamental questions about the
credibility and integrity of S&P’s ratings action,” John
Bellows, acting assistant secretary for economic policy, wrote
in a Treasury blog on Aug. 6.  “That’s a complete misrepresentation of what happened,”
Beers said, dismissing suggestions that the downgrade wasn’t
justified and saying the U.S. debt burden will rise “most
likely over the next decade.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
