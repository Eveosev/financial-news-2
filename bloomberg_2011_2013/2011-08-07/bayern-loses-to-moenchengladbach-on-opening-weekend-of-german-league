Bayern Munich  lost 1-0 at home to
Borussia Moenchengladbach on the opening weekend of German
soccer’s Bundesliga.  Bayern, the winner of a record 22 league titles, lost

a mix-up between new signings Jerome Boateng and goalkeeper
 Manuel Neuer . It was Moenchengladbach first victory at Bayern
since 1995.  Borussia Dortmund  opened the defense of its league
championship three days ago with a 3-1 win over Hamburg.  In  France , Rennes won 5-1 at promoted Dijon yesterday,
while  Saint Etienne  beat Bordeaux 2-1 in the late game.  Champion Lille was held to a 1-1 draw at Nancy two days,

its season-opening game under the ownership of the Qatari
Investment Authority.  Serbian striker Miralem Sulejmani scored twice as Ajax got
the defense of its Dutch title off to a successful start with a
4-1 victory at De Graafschap yesterday.  Italian champion AC Milan came from behind to defeat city
