German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
Bavarian Christian Social Union allies rejected a proposal by
European Commission President  Jose Barroso  to expand the euro’s
bailout fund.  “The CSU will not support this,” CSU Chairman  Horst Seehofer  said on German  ARD  Television tonight. The plan “can’t
seriously be wanted by anyone,” Seehofer said.  Barroso indicated on Aug. 4 that he wants more firepower
for the European Financial Stability Facility, the euro area’s
rescue fund. Barroso urged euro region leaders to review “all
elements” of the 440 billion-euro ($626 billion) fund and the
500 billion-euro European Stability Mechanism that will replace
it in mid-2013.  Seehofer said his party, one of three groups making up the
German ruling coalition, won’t support any policy moves in the
debt crisis that “socialize” or spread the liability for the
debt of some euro region states.  To contact the reporter on this story:
