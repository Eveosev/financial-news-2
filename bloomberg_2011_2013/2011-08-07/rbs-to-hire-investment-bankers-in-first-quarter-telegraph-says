Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) ,
Britainâ€™s biggest government-controlled lender, plans to hire
new staff to strengthen its investment-banking unit, the Sunday
Telegraph reported, without saying where it got the information.  The bank, which on Aug. 5 announced plans to cut about
2,000 jobs over the next 18 months, asked recruiting agencies in
 London  to hire staff in the first quarter of next year for debt
underwriting, corporate brokering, and merger and acquisitions,
the newspaper said.  RBS spokeswoman Amy Pickerill declined to comment when
contacted by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
