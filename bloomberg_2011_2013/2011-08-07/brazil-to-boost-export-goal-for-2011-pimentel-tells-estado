Brazil  will export more than the $245
billion initially estimated for this year as the country
benefits from a commodity boom, Trade Minister Fernando Pimentel
told  O Estado de S. Paulo .  The new target will be announced after this month, he told
the Sao Paulo-based newspaper.  Brazil had announced the export goal of $245 billion on
May 2.  The government will maintain a 55 billion reais ($35
billion) Treasury loan to Brazilâ€™s development bank this year
and may cut the amount for 2012, Pimentel told Estado.  To contact the reporter on this story:
