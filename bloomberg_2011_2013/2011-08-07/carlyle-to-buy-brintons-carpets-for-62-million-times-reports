Carlyle Group , a U.S. private-equity
firm, agreed to take control of Brintons Carpets for 38 million
pounds ($62.3 million), the Sunday Times reported without saying
where it got the information.  Carlyle will take over the carpet producerâ€™s 18 million
pounds of bank loans and will invest a further 20 million pounds
in the company, according to the newspaper. Brintons, based in
Kidderminster, was established in 1783 and supplies carpets to
 Buckingham Palace  and casinos in Las Vegas, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
