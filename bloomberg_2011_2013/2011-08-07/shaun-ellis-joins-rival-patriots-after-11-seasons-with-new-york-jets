Shaun Ellis ended his 11-year stay
with the  New York Jets  by agreeing to a one-year contract with
the rival  New England Patriots .  The 34-year-old defensive end will join the Patriots after
passing a physical examination. New York offered him a one-year
deal worth the veterans’ minimum $910,000,  ESPN said , citing the
players’ agent, Mitch Frankel. Financial terms of the Patriots’
offer aren’t known.  “The fact that he chose them, there’s no way I’m going to
wish him well,” Jets coach  Rex Ryan  said. “There’s no chance
of that. I wish him to be healthy, but I don’t want him to play
that well. I know the way he is. He’s going to be revved up,
ready to go. So, it’ll be fun, going against him.”  Ellis, taken by the Jets with the 12th overall pick in the
2000 National Football League draft, has 72 1/2 sacks, the
third-most in franchise history behind Mark Gastineau (107.5)
and Joe Klecko (77.5). Ellis has missed six games since becoming
a starter in 2001 and has had at least 4 1/2 sacks each year
since 2005.  Ryan has said Muhammad Wilkerson, the team’s first pick in
this year’s draft, will start at defensive end in place of
Ellis, who had 553 tackles in 170 career games for the Jets.  “That’s why we drafted him, not to be a back-up,” Ryan
told reporters last week. “We need him to be a player. He’s
starting right now.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
