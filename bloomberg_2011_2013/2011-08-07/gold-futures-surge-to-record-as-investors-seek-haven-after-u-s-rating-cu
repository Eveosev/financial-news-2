Gold futures surged to a record
$1,697.70 an ounce on demand for an investment haven as the
dollar slumped following  Standard & Poor’s  downgrade of the U.S.
long-term credit rating from AAA.  Gold futures for December delivery rose $36, or 2.2
percent, to $1,687.80 an ounce at 7:40 a.m. Tokyo time in
electronic trading on the Comex in  New York  after reaching the
all-time high.  “Gold will most likely be a sharp recipient of safe- haven
flows” following the U.S. rating cut,  Edel Tully , a London-
based analyst at UBS AG, said in a report. “Our previous one-
month forecast of $1,725 is likely to be easily met in the short
term.”‬  U.S. stock futures and crude oil plunged today. Last week,
investors dumped equities and most raw materials for the
perceived safety of Treasuries, the Swiss franc and gold amid
escalating debt concerns in the U.S. and  Europe . Before today,
the metal climbed 16 percent this year.  “Most likely there will be a quest for physical gold, from
both U.S. and European investors,” Tully said in the report
“The fear trade, as seen through the purchase of small bars and
coins, will intensify as confidence diminishes, not just in the
U.S., but fear of contagion to other AAA nations will prompt
additional physical buying in European.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
