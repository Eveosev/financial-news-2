Rio Tinto Group, the world’s second-
biggest mining company, and  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058)  offered A$1.49
billion ($1.55 billion) for the shares in  Coal & Allied
Industries Ltd. (CNA)  they don’t own to take the coal miner private.  Rio and Mitsubishi, which own stakes of 75.7 percent and
10.2 percent respectively, made an initial offer of A$122 a
share, 34 percent more than the Brisbane-based company’s closing
price of A$91, Coal & Allied said today in a statement. The bid
values Coal & Allied at A$10.6 billion, the company said.  Buying Coal & Allied will give London-based Rio and
Mitsubishi full control of three coal mines in the  Hunter Valley 
in  Australia ’s New South Wales state as prices surge. The move
comes after Rio’s A$3.4 billion acquisition of Riversdale Mining
Ltd. last month and Peabody Energy Corp. and ArcelorMittal’s
A$4.7 billion pending bid for Macarthur Coal Ltd.  Rio and Mitsubishi’s “bid reflects the dynamic of the
market that we’re in with lots of interest in coal assets,”
 Michael McCarthy , chief market strategist at CMC Markets in
Sydney, said by phone. “This is an attempt to deliver a knock-
out bid and one that is high enough for the Coal & Allied board
to recommend.”  Coal & Allied shares gained 29 percent to A$116.20 at the
4:10 p.m. close of Sydney trading. They traded as high as
A$130.10 this year on Jan. 28.  Rio Tinto  fell 4.7 percent to
A$68.63, compared with a 2.9 percent drop in the S&P/ASX 200
benchmark index.  Cash Flow   Rio Tinto generated $18 billion in cash from its operations
in the year to Dec. 31, compared with a cash flow of $9.6
billion a year earlier, data on the Bloomberg shows. Rio has
worked to repair its balance sheet, with the help of surging
commodity prices as well as more than $11 billion in asset sales,
after debt ballooned 19-fold with the purchase of aluminum
producer Alcan Inc. in 2007.  Including Coal & Allied’s A$1.20 a share dividend, the
offer values the target at 21.9 percent more than its one-month
volume-weighted average price, Rio Tinto said.  Perpetual Ltd., Coal & Allied’s third-largest shareholder,
supports the bid in the absence of a higher offer, it said in an
e-mailed statement, meaning the companies have agreements for
more than 90 percent of the target.  Record Prices  Pending and completed takeovers in the coal sector totaled
$11 billion in the second quarter this year as coal prices trade
near record highs with an average premium of 39 percent, the
most in at least 10 years, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Should the bid be successful, Rio will end up with 80
percent and Mitsubishi 20 percent of the target, Coal & Allied
said. Perpetual now owns a 6.32 percent stake in the company,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Coal & Allied is being
advised by Greenhill Caliburn and Gilbert & Tobin.  “The proposal response committee makes no recommendation
to shareholders at this stage other than that the Coal & Allied
shareholders do not need to do anything in relation to the
indicative proposal,” Coal & Allied said.  Coal prices have surged on rising demand to feed power
stations and  steel mills  in  China , the world’s largest user of
coal, and amid global production disruptions, including record
flooding in Queensland.  The offer is also subject to Rio Tinto and Mitsubishi
completing certain arrangements, Coal & Allied said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
