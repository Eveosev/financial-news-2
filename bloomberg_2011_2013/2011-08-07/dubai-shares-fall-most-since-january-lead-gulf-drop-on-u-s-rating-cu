Middle East shares tumbled, sending
Dubai’s index down the most since February, after Standard &
Poor’s cut the credit rating of the U.S. for the first time and
amid rising concern the global economy is faltering.  Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , developer of the world’s tallest
tower, slumped 5.3 percent.  Arabtec Holding Co. (ARTC)  dropped the most
since March after it said second-quarter profit fell 74 percent.
The  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  lost 3.7 percent, the most since Feb. 28,
to 1,484.31 at the 2 p.m. close in Dubai. The measure has
plunged 12 percent from this year’s high in April, entering a
so-called correction. Israel’s TA-25 Index slumped 6 percent,
the most since November 2008, at 3:51 p.m. in Tel Aviv.  “We’re playing catch-up and trying to anticipate and price
in the response to the downgrade by global markets tomorrow,”
said  Julian Bruce , equity sales head at EFG-Hermes Holding SAE
in Dubai. “The impact on stock prices that we’re seeing
reflects the feelings of uncertainty” about global growth, he
said.  Global stocks tumbled last week as investors fled equities
amid signs the world’s largest economy is stalling. S&P
downgraded the AAA credit rating of the U.S. on Aug. 5 by one
level to AA+, while keeping the outlook at “negative.” The
rating may be cut to AA within two years if spending reductions
are lower than agreed to,  interest rates  rise or “new fiscal
pressures” result in higher general government debt, the New
York-based firm said.  Global Slump  U.S. and European shares posted their biggest weekly losses
since November 2008. The  S&P 500  plunged 7.2 percent and the
Stoxx 600 Europe Index tumbled 9.9 percent. The  European Central
Bank  left interest rates unchanged on Aug. 4 as economic growth
slows and the region’s debt crisis spreads to Italy and Spain.  Oil for September delivery tumbled 9.2 percent last week to
$86.88 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The six
nations of the Gulf Cooperation Council supply about a fifth of
the world’s oil.  The  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index (BGCC200)  of the region’s stocks declined
1.4 percent and Egypt’s  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  slid 4.2 percent today.  Emaar fell the most since March 2 to 2.88 dirhams. Arabtec,
the United Arab Emirates’ biggest construction company by market
value, tumbled 6.3 percent, also the most since March 2, to 1.34
dirhams. Second-quarter profit dropped to 28.97 million dirhams
($7.9 million) from 111 million dirhams a year earlier. The mean
estimate of six analysts was for a profit of 44 million dirhams,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Israel’s Slump  Oman’s MSM 30 Index decreased 1.9 percent. Abu Dhabi’s  ADX
General Index (ADSMI)  and Qatar’s  QE Index (DSM)  lost 2.5 percent. Kuwait’s
gauge decreased 1.6 percent to the lowest since September 2004.
Bahrain’s BB All Share Index slipped 0.3 percent, while Saudi
Arabia’s  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  rose less than 0.1 percent
after tumbling 5.5 percent yesterday.  Israel’s TA-25 Index slid to 1,085.44 and is down 19
percent from a record high on April 21. The open of trading in
Israel was delayed by an hour after circuit breakers went into
effect as the opening auction indicated a 5 percent decline. The
yield on the 5 percent Mimshal Shiklit government bonds due
January 2020 rose five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point,
to 4.95 percent.  “If there’s a storm globally, it’s going to affect Israel,
which has very large exports to the U.S. and the eurozone,”
said Ron Eichel, chief economist and strategist at Meitav
Investment House Ltd. in  Tel Aviv . “It could be a turbulent
market in the next few weeks.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
