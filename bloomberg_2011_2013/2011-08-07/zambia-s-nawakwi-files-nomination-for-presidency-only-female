Edith Nawakwi, the former finance
minister of Zambia, submitted her nomination to become
president, becoming the only female candidate, said Priscilla
Isaacs, the director of the  Electoral Commission  of Zambia, in
an interview.  “The other one who has successfully filed is Mr. Tilyenji
Kaunda of the United National Independence Party,” Isaacs said.
Nawakwi is the Forum for Democracy and Development’s candidate.  The presidential candidates need to pay a $2,000 none
refundable nomination fee and garner as many as 200 registered
voters in order to qualify. The nomination process has been
extended to Aug. 12 to accommodate all the 17 candidates ahead
of the polls on Sept. 20, said Isaacs. Rupiah Banda, 74, the
incumbent is expected to file his nomination either tomorrow or
Tuesday, said Isaacs.  Michael Sata, the leader of the second-largest party
Patriotic Front will file his nomination on Tuesday, said
Isaacs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
