A withholding tax on German assets in
Swiss banks will be set at 26 percent in a deal to be signed on
Aug. 10, SonntagsZeitung reported today, citing people familiar
with the discussions.  Negotiators agreed to a higher percentage figure after
 Germany  reduced to 2 billion francs ($2.6 billion) from 10
billion francs its demand for an advance payment by banks, part
of an accord that will legalize German citizensâ€™ untaxed
deposits in  Switzerland , the Swiss newspaper cited the people as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
