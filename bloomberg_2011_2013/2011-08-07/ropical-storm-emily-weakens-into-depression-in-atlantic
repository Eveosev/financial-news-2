Tropical storm Emily in the Atlantic
and Caribbean basins has weakened into a depression and could
become a “trough of low pressure‘‘ by Aug. 9, the National
Hurricane Center said.  The system, located at 155 miles (249 kilometers) north-
northeast of Freeport on Grand Bahama Island, is moving toward
the north at near 9 miles per hour, the Miami-based center said
in a website  advisory  at 5 a.m. New York time today. ‘‘Little
change in strength is forecast during the next day or so.’’  Emily formed a tropical storm on Aug. 1 in the  Caribbean
Sea  about 50 miles southwest of the island of  Dominica . It was
the fifth named system of the  Atlantic hurricane season , which
runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
