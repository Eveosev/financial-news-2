Edison SpA (EDN) ’s Italian investors are
divided about the split of assets after reaching an accord for
control of the utility with Electricite de France SA, daily
 Corriere della Sera  reported, without saying where it got the
information.  Edison’s biggest shareholder is Transalpina di Energia, a
company half-owned by Paris-based EDF and half by Delmi SpA,
which in turn is owned by  A2A SpA (A2A)  and other Italian companies.
A2A is leading the talks with Edison and Delmi’s smaller
shareholders want to be more involved in negotiations, Corriere
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
