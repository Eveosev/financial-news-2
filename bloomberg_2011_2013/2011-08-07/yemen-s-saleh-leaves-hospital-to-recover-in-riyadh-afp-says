Yemen’s President Ali Abdullah Saleh,
who had been hospitalized in  Saudi Arabia  for two months, was
discharged today and he will be staying in the Saudi capital,
 Riyadh , for a period of recovery,  Agence France-Presse  reported,
citing unidentified Yemeni and Saudi officials.  Saleh left the hospital last night and was sent to a
temporary place of residence, an unidentified Saudi official
said without specifying how long the recovery would last,
according to AFP.  Saleh has been invited to a palace in Riyadh, an
unidentified Yemeni individual said, adding that he did not
expect the president to be back in Yemen anytime soon, AFP said.  Saleh had been injured during a June attack on his compound
in the Yemeni capital, Sana’a, amid demonstrations against his
rule that began in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
