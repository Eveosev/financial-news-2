Industries Qatar QSC (IQCD) , the country’s
second-biggest company by market value, will “significantly
exceed” its profit and revenue targets for this year as the
company starts operating a new fertilizer plant, the company’s
chief coordinator said.  The company, which operates petrochemical, fertilizer and
steel arms, targets net income of 4.9 billion riyals ($1.4
billion) and revenue of 14.5 billion riyals for 2011,
Abdulrahman Al-Shaibi said in a release today.  With the “imminent” start of Qatar Fertilizer Co.’s 9.6
billion-riyal Qafco 5 urea and ammonia plant, “the group is on
course to deliver an exceptional 2011 full-year result,” Al-
Shaibi said.  Industries Qatar said first-half profit rose 58 percent to
4.2 billion riyals on rising commodity prices and increased
output. The company said in April net income will fall to 4.6
billion riyals next year before rising to 5 billion riyals in
2013.  The company steel division has put on hold an expansion
project because of “natural gas allocation restrictions,” Al-
Shaibi said. The company said in April that the expansion was to
be completed by 2015.  Industries Qatar stock price fell 1.4 percent to 136.8
riyals a share on the Qatar Exchange today, the biggest fall
since June 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
