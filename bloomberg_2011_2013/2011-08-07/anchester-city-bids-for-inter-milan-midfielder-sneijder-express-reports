Manchester City bid 34 million pounds
($55.7 million) for Inter Milan midfielder  Wesley Sneijder , who
has been a target for  Manchester United , the Sunday Express
reported.  City has turned to the 27-year-old Sneijder after failing
to sign Christian Eriksen, 19, from Ajax, the newspaper said,
without saying where it got the information. Ajax accepted a
bid, but Eriksen wants to stay at the club for another season,
the Express said.  United is still interested in Sneijder, although City has
offered more than the Premier League soccer champion has been
prepared to pay, the newspaper reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
