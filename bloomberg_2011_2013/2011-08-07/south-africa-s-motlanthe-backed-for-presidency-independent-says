The youth league of  South Africa ’s
ruling African National Congress will back Deputy President
Kgalema Motlanthe as the party’s next leader in elections to be
held in December next year, the  Sunday Independent  reported,
citing unidentified sources within the league.  Housing Minister  Tokyo Sexwale  was dropped by the league as
a potential presidential candidate, the Johannesburg-based
newspaper said. The league wants Zwelinzima Vavi, currently
secretary-general of the Congress of South African Trade Unions,
to be appointed ANC chairman, and for party treasurer Mathews
Phosa to retain his position, the Independent said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
