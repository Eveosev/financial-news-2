Syria  started producing 600,000 cubic
meters of natural gas a day from the Sadad-1 field to feed
electricity stations, Al Watan newspaper said.  Syrian Gas Company will also start producing 400,000 cubic
meters a day from the nearby Sadad-3 well within a week, the
Damascus-based newspaper said. The state-owned company pumps the
output through a 37-kilometer (22-mile) pipeline to a nearby
treatment plant in the Al Furuqlos area from where the clean gas
will feed  power plants , it said.  The output from Sadad will save about $600,000 a day when
gas will replace  fuel oil  at the power stations, it said, citing
Sufian Alao, Syriaâ€™s oil minister. Sadad  gas field  holds a total
of 12 billion cubic meters in proven reserves and is located
near the central city of Homs, it said.  Syria, trying to halt a decline in its oil production,
pumped 11 percent more natural gas in the first half of 2011
compared with the same period of last year, the Oil Ministry
said in an e-mail statement Aug.2. Gas production rose to 5.48
billion cubic meters in the first half, or 30.3 million cubic
meters a day, up from 27.3 million cubic meters a day in the
same period of 2010, it said.  With assistance from Nayla Razzouk in Amman.--Editors:  To contact the reporter on this story:
