Spanish Finance Minister  Elena Salgado  said the European Central Bank must help stabilize
sovereign debt markets till the July 21 European Union accords
are implemented, EFE reported.  “The ECB must do its duty and help stability on debt
markets,” Salgado told EFE in an interview. The accords, which
extend the European rescue fund’s capacity to aid debt-burdened
countries, must be implemented fast, she said.  Spain will take measures this month to help its 17 semi-
autonomous regions meet their 2011 deficit targets, Salgado
said. That will increase tax receipts by 2.5 billion euros ($3.6
billion) and cut spending by 2.4 billion euros, Salgado told the
Spanish  news agency .  To contact the reporter on this story:
