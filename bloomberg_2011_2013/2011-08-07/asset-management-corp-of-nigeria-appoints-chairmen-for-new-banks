The Asset Management Corp. of  Nigeria ,
or Amcon, today appointed chairmen for the three new banks it
bought yesterday, after they took over from three lenders whose
licenses were revoked on Aug.5, after they were deemed unlikely
to meet a Sept.30 recapitalization deadline, it said.  It appointed Jacob Ajekigbe, a former managing director of
First Bank of Nigeria Plc, as Chairman for Keystone Bank
Limited, which took over from  Bank PHB Plc (PLATINUM) , it said in an e-
mailed statement today. It appointed Falalu Bello as chairman
for Mainstreet Bank Limited, which took over from Afribank Plc,
while Emeka Onwuka, former managing director of Diamond Bank
Plc, was named chairman of Enterprise Bank Limited, which took
over from  Spring Bank Plc (SPRINGBK) , it said.  “Amcon has concluded arrangements for the injection of
N679 billion into these three banks tomorrow,” the statement
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
