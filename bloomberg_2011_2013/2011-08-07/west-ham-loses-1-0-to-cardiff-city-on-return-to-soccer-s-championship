West Ham, relegated from the Premier
League last season, suffered a 1-0 home defeat to Cardiff City
today on its return to English soccer’s second-tier
Championship.  Kenny Miller secured Cardiff’s win at Upton Park with an
injury-time strike that England goalkeeper  Robert Green  got his
hands to but couldn’t stop.  West Ham has lost players including striker Demba Ba,
center-back Matthew Upson and midfielder Thomas Hitzlsperger
since losing its top-flight status, but made additions with
Premier League experience such as Kevin Nolan and Matthew Taylor.  The Hammers appointed Sam Allardyce as manager since last
season, replacing  Avram Grant , while Cardiff also has a new
coach in Malky Mackay.  West Ham had several chances today, but struggled to break
down the visitor’s defense, with goalkeeper David Marshall
making saves from Taylor, Pablo Barrera and Frederic Piquionne.  Piquionne also hit the bar, while a James Tomkins header
was stopped on the line by Peter Whittingham.  Blackpool was the only one of the three demoted teams to
start with a win, beating Hull City 1-0 two days ago. Yesterday,
Birmingham City lost 2-1 at Derby.  All three teams that came up from the third-tier League One
started with victories. Brighton defeated Doncaster 2-1,
Southampton beat Leeds 3-1, and Peterborough won 2-1 against
Crystal Palace. Leicester City, among the favorites for
promotion, yesterday won 1-0 at Coventry City.  To contact the reporter on this story:
