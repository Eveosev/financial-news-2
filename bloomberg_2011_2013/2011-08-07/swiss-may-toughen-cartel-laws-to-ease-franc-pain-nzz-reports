Swiss Economy Minister Johann Schneider-Ammann aims to strengthen laws against price-fixing to
ease the economic effect of a strong Swiss franc, reversing
earlier policy decisions, NZZ am Sonntag reported today, citing
people familiar with the issue.  Over the next three weeks, the cabinet will discuss
prompting  Switzerland ’s competition watchdog to open more probes
into suspected cartels and enforce a stricter definition of
“market dominance” as the franc’s gains have so far not
reduced the cost of imported goods, the Swiss newspaper cited
the people as saying.  Schneider-Ammann’s strategy, which will include talks with
manufacturers, importers and consumer groups, is a policy “u-
turn” as he had previously spoken out against government
measures, NZZ said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
