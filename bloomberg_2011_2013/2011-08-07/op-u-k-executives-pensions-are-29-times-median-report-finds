The pensions of the U.K.’s senior
executives are 29 times the median company pension, according to
research by the  High Pay Commission , a pressure group that
pushes for curbs on top earners.  An average leading executive at a FTSE 100 company can
expect to receive 174,963 pounds ($286,300) a year in
retirement, compared with a median 5,860 pounds for all
“defined-benefit” pensions, according to the group.  “Directors are receiving gold-plated pensions while
retirement provision for the workforce has been slashed,”
Deborah Hargreaves, who heads the London-based commission, said
in an e-mailed statement. “It seems as ever, it is one rule for
the workers and another for the boardroom.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
