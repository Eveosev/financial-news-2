Majid Al Futtaim Group, the shopping-
mall developer that built Dubai’s indoor ski slope, started
construction of its mixed-use project in  Syria  even as the
security situation there worsened.  The Dubai-based developer began work on the $1 billion
development, which is located 17 kilometers west of the Syrian
capital Damascus, the company said in an e-mailed statement
today.  The mall builder on July 27 started laying the foundations
for the first phase of the project, which will involve building
hotels, shops, homes and offices within a 1.5 million square-
meter (16.1 million square-feet) area in the Yaafour district,
according to the statement.  “All necessary preparations required to proceed with the
execution of the project have already been made,” Waddah El
Solh, the company’s regional head for Syria and Lebanon, said in
the statement. That includes the allocation of project
management and construction teams, he said.  About 2,200 protesters have been killed in Syria since
March in an uprising against the government of President Bashar al-Assad, according to the National Organization for Human
Rights. More than 500 members of the security forces have also
been killed, Deputy Foreign Minister Fayssal Mekdad told India’s
News X channel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
