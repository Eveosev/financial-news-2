Wide receiver Derrick Mason, cut a
week ago by the Baltimore Ravens, has reached an agreement to
join the  New York Jets , ESPN reported.  Mason, 37, will be reunited with coach  Rex Ryan , who was an
assistant when both were with Baltimore. He joins a receiving
team of Santonio Holmes and Plaxico Burress, who is returning to
the  National Football League  after a 20-month jail term for
possession of a gun.  “After a lot of very thoughtful and careful consideration,
conversations with my family and prayer, I have decided to sign
with the New York Jets,” Mason told ESPN. “I’m looking forward
to working under Rex and rejoining some familiar faces.”  Mason, who has eight 1,000-yard seasons, tallied 61 catches
for 802 yards and seven touchdowns last season. The Ravens and
Tennessee Titans also were interested in Mason, ESPN said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
