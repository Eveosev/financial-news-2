(Corrects after central bank updates website to show that
nominal GDP hasn’t been released as originally reported in story
published Aug. 4.)  The Qatari central bank hasn’t yet
reported second quarter nominal gross domestic product, an
official at the bank said, speaking on condition of anonymity in
line with the bank’s rules. The bank’s website had listed no
growth for second-quarter nominal GDP, which was reported in
error, the statistician said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
