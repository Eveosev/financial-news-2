Treasury Secretary  Timothy F.
Geithner  said he’s not concerned China will stop purchases of
Treasuries after the U.S. credit rating was reduced one step by
 Standard & Poor’s .  “They’ve been very strong and I’m sure they’ll be strong
investors in the U.S. going forward,” he said today, according
to the transcript of an interview with NBC television. “I’m
very confident in that.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
