Manchester United ’s U.S. owners are
preparing to sell as much as a quarter of their stake in the
English Premier League soccer champion through an initial public
offering, the  Sunday Mirror  said.  The Malcolm Glazer family, the club’s Florida-based owners,
are looking to sell between 15 percent and 25 percent of their
stake in the club and raise over 400 million pounds ($656
million), the newspaper said, without disclosing how it got the
information.  The family is consulting UBS AG for the planned public
offering, the Sunday Mirror said.  Manchester United spokesman Philip Townsend told Bloomberg
News the club doesn’t comment on speculation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
