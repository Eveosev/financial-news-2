Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  is seeking talks
with its competitors such as  Vodafone Group PLC (VOD)  and  Telefonica
SA (TEF)  over potentially sharing the costs of building a high-speed
VDSL Internet network in  Germany ,  Focus  magazine reported.  Analysts estimate the costs of finishing the project at
about 50 billion euros ($71.4 billion) by 2014 and “this of
course would be impossible for us to pay alone,” Telekom
management-board member Niek Jan van Damme is cited as saying in
an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
