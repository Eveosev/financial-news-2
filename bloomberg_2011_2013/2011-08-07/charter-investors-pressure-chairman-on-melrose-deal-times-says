Charter International Plc (CHTR) , a target
of a $2.3 billion takeover bid by  Melrose Plc (MRO) , may oust its
chairman should acquisition talks fail to begin, The Sunday
Times reported without saying where it got the information.  Some of the largest 10 shareholders of Charter plan to call
an emergency general meeting to oust Chairman Lars Emilson and
senior independent director Grey Denham if Melrose walks away
from the deal, according to the newspaper. Charter has rejected
two informal offers of 780 pence a share and 840 pence from
Melrose, the Sunday Times said.  Emilson said the management will meet this week to discuss
the feedback it received at a series of investors meetings,
according to the newspaper.  Charterâ€™s largest five shareholders that account for 33
percent, including Fidelity Management, Schroders Plc, Scottish
Widows Plc, Aviva Plc and BlackRock Inc., want the company to
open its books to Melrose, the Sunday Times said.  Hedge funds ,
holding 20 percent of Charter, also support talks with Melrose,
according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
