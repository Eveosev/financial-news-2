Corn may reverse last week’s gain and
soybeans may extend their slide on speculation that a sluggish
 U.S. economy  and a debt crisis in Europe will slow demand for
crops used to make food,  animal feed  and fuel.  Thirteen of 25 traders and analysts surveyed from Tokyo to
Chicago on Aug. 5 forecast that corn will drop, and 14 of 26
respondents said soybeans will decline.  On the Chicago Board of Trade last week, corn futures for
December delivery rose 5.1 percent to $7.03 a bushel, after
gaining 7.8 percent in July as unusually hot, dry weather
damaged U.S. crops. Soybean futures for November delivery
dropped 1.6 percent to $13.36 a bushel on the CBOT.  Last week’s gain in corn was a surprise to the majority of
analysts and traders surveyed on July 29, while the drop in
soybeans was expected.  Bearish on corn: 13    Bearish on soybeans: 14
