India  may not need to raise  interest
rates  if U.S. economic growth slows and helps lower global
commodity prices, easing inflation pressures, said R. Gopalan,
secretary of economic affairs at India’s finance ministry.  “If what has happened in the U.S. pulls down the growth
and reduces the prices of commodities in the international
market and that comes into our economy as lower  price levels ,
perhaps we may not need a hike,” Gopalan told reporters late
yesterday in the southern Indian city of Chennai. “It is too
early to make any estimation about it.”  He said India’s central bank raised borrowing costs on July
26 and will meet in six weeks to “analyze the situation and
accordingly take a view.”  The  Reserve Bank  of India has raised its repurchase rate 11
times since the start of 2010 and last increased it by 50 basis
points on July 26 to 8 percent. India’s benchmark wholesale-
price inflation accelerated to 9.44 percent in June.  India’s next monetary policy announcement is scheduled for
Sept. 16.  U.S. gross domestic product data last month showed a 1.3
percent growth pace in the second quarter, after a near stall in
the first three months of 2011.  To contact the reporters on this story:
