Harvard University’s  Kenneth Rogoff 
said Germany must get used to the idea of helping Spain and
Italy manage their sovereign debt problems,  Der Spiegel  magazine
reported the economist as saying in an interview.  If Spain and Italy are to remain in the Europe’s single
currency, “the Germans must accept that the European Union is a
transfer union, that is, they must get used to long-term
transfer payments,” Rogoff said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
