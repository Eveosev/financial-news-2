Rioters set fire to buildings and
vehicles, injuring eight policemen in attacks in north London
yesterday following a protest over the shooting of a Tottenham
resident, the British Broadcasting Corp. reported.  Protesters threw petrol bombs at police and buildings,
setting fire to a bus, a supermarket and a carpet shop, the  BBC 
reported. Shops in the area were also looted, it said.  Attacks began after a protest over the fatal shooting of
Mark Duggan by the police, according to the broadcaster.  Home Secretary Theresa May condemned the attacks, saying
the government wonâ€™t tolerate it and the Metropolitan Police
have her full support in restoring order, according to BBC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
