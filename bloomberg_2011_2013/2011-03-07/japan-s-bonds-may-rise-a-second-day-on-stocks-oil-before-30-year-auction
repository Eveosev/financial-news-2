Japan’s 10-year bonds may rise for a
second day as global equities fell and oil climbed to a 29-month
high after violence escalated in  Libya , boosting demand for the
relative safety of government debt.  Bonds may also advance as a report today is forecast to
show Japan’s current-account surplus narrowed in January. The
Ministry of Finance will sell 600 billion yen ($7.3 billion) of
30-year bonds today. Nikkei 225 Stock Average futures fell,
trading at 10,450 in  Chicago  from 10,530 in  Osaka  yesterday.  “Should Japan’s stocks follow global losses, external
conditions will be positive” for bonds, Kazuhiko Sano, chief
strategist at Tokai Tokyo Securities Co., wrote in a note today.
“Bonds are likely to strengthen today.”  Ten-year bond futures for March delivery last traded at
139.68 in  London  from 139.71 at the 3 p.m. close at the Tokyo
Stock Exchange yesterday. The contract will open for trading at
9 a.m. Tokyo time.  The benchmark 10-year bond hasn’t traded yet today at Japan
Bond Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker.
The yield on the 1.3 percent bond due March 2021 fell 2.5 basis
points to 1.27 percent yesterday. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  The  MSCI World (MXWO)  Index fell 0.7 percent yesterday. Crude oil
for April delivery increased $1.02 to $105.44 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest settlement since
September 2008.  Current Account  Japan’s current-account surplus shrank 48 percent in
January from a year earlier, according to the median estimate of
economists in a Bloomberg News survey before the  Finance
Ministry  reports the data at 8:50 a.m. today in Tokyo.  The prior 30-year sale on Jan. 13 drew bids worth 5.77
times the amount on offer, compared with a so-called bid-to-
cover ratio of 2.95 at the December sale.  The 1.2 percent bond due in December 2020 closed at 99.60
to yield 1.245 percent yesterday, according to the Bloomberg Yen
Bond Fixing Price. The level is an average rate set at 6:30 p.m.
