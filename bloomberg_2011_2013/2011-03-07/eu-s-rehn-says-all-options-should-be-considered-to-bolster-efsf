European Union Economic and Monetary
Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said “no options should be off
the table” in the discussion about bolstering the European
Financial Stability Facility.  “The commission has been and continues to be in favor of
reinforcing the effective lending capacity of the facility so
that 440 billion euros is 440 and not only a certain part of
that,” Rehn said today in Luxembourg. “No options should be
off the table at this stage. We have to look at all the options
and then together decide on how we reinforce the effective
lending capacity and we extend the scope of activities of the
EFSF.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
