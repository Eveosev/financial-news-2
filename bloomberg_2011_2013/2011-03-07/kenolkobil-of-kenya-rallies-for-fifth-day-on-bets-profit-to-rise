KenolKobil Ltd., a Kenyan fuel
retailer with operations in seven African countries, rose for a
fifth day, the longest winning streak in more than five months,
on speculation it will report improved full-year profit.  The stock added 5 cents, or 0.5 percent, to 9.9 shillings
by the 3 p.m. close in Nairobi, the highest since Feb. 8.  “Earnings are expected to be strong in 2010,” Gregory Waweru, a research analyst at Nairobi-based Kestrel Capital East
Africa Ltd., said in a phone interview today. The company is
expected to announce its full-year earnings through December by
next week, Waweru said, adding he expects profit to rise 30
percent from a year earlier.  Net income climbed 47 percent to 1.29 billion shillings
($16 million) in 2009, it said on April 7 last year.  Kenol, which has a 20 percent share of the Kenyan market,
has operations in  Burundi ,  Uganda ,  Tanzania , Rwanda, Zambia and
Ethiopia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
