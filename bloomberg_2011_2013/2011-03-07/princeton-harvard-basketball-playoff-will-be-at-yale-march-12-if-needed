  Princeton University  needs to win
its regular-season finale at the  University of Pennsylvania 
tonight to set up a weekend playoff game against  Harvard
University  for the  Ivy League ’s automatic berth in the NCAA
men’s basketball tournament.  Princeton , which has a 23-6 record, including an 11-2 mark
in the league, visits Penn (13-14) at 7 p.m. local time at The
Palestra in Philadelphia.  With a victory, the Tigers would advance to a one-game
playoff against Harvard on March 12 at  Yale University  in New
Haven,  Connecticut . If Princeton loses tonight,  Harvard  -- which
is 23-5 overall and 12-2 against league opponents -- clinches
the Ivy League title outright and returns to the National
Collegiate Athletic Association tournament for the first time in
65 years.  “If we take care of business, it’s a tie ballgame,”
Princeton senior guard Dan Mavraides told reporters.  The  Ivy League , which doesn’t have a conference tournament,
has had seven playoffs to determine its automatic qualifier for
the 68-team NCAA championship. Princeton has been a part of all
of them, most recently in 2002, when three schools finished tied
atop the league.  The Tigers needed overtime to beat Penn 62-59 in their
previous meeting this season, on Feb. 8 in  New Jersey . Princeton
won at Penn the past two seasons and tonight will be seeking its
first three-game winning streak at The Palestra since 1997-99.
The Tigers have won four straight overall against the Quakers,
their longest run in the series since winning six in a row from
1996-99.  A victory tonight would give Princeton a share of its 26th
Ivy title, snapping a tie with Penn for the most in the 54 years
the league has crowned a champion.  Harvard Ends Drought  Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Harvard, the top university
in U.S. News & World Report’s annual ranking, had been the only
school in the eight-team Ivy League not to win a men’s
basketball championship. The Crimson now are guaranteed being at
least co-champions after beating visiting Princeton 79-67 on
March 5 to end a five-game losing streak against the Tigers.  Harvard made its lone NCAA tournament appearance in 1946.
Princeton has gone 23 times, most recently in 2004.  The possible playoff would be played midway between the
schools, at rival Yale’s 2,800-seat  John J. Lee Amphitheater .  New Haven  is about 130 miles (209 kilometers) from both
Princeton and Cambridge.  The Ivy League has never sent more than one school to the
NCAA tournament in a season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
