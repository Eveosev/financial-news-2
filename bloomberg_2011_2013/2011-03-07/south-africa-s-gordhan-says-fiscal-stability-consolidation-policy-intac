South African Finance Minister  Pravin Gordhan  said the government’s policy of fiscal stability
and consolidation “remains in place” even though it will post
bigger budget deficits over the next three years than earlier
projected.  While the government will aim for “counter-cyclicality”
in the budget, “this doesn’t mean you won’t get minor
fluctuations,” Gordhan told reporters and economists in
Johannesburg today.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
