Having educated six U.S. presidents,
16 Supreme Court Justices and 41 Nobel laureates, few
achievements have escaped  Harvard University . One of them is
winning the  Ivy League  men’s basketball title outright.  The Crimson ended 100 years of frustration two days ago by
beating  Princeton University  79-67 to claim at least a share of
the title. Harvard will be champion if Princeton loses to the  University of Pennsylvania  in its final regular-season game
tomorrow. A victory for the Tigers will force a playoff for a
National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament berth.  “I’m not sure you can go on this campus and find something
that’s never been done before,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said
after the win over Princeton. “I’m thrilled for our school to
finally say that we’re champions.”  Amaker was hired four years ago by Harvard, the top
university in U.S. News & World Report’s annual ranking, to
challenge Princeton and Penn as perennial  Ivy League men’s
basketball  champions.  In the 54 years the Ivy League has been naming a men’s
basketball champion, Princeton and Penn have each won at least a
share of the title 25 times. Cornell University and Yale
University rank next with four titles each;  Dartmouth College  in
Hanover,  New Hampshire , with two; and  Brown University  and  Columbia University  have one each.  Established in 1636, Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Harvard
started a men’s basketball team in 1900-01. It didn’t compete
from 1909 to 1920 and its best Ivy League finish was second
place in 1970-71.  1946  The Crimson, who last appeared in the NCAA tournament in
1946, have improved every year since 45-year-old Amaker joined
from the University of Michigan in 2007, going 8-22, 14-14 and
21-8.  The March 5 win over Princeton was Harvard’s first against
the Tigers in six attempts and came one month after a 65-61 loss
in  New Jersey . Harvard sits atop the Ivy League standings with a
12-2 record in conference play and 23-5 mark overall. Princeton
is 11-2 in the league and 23-6 overall.  The sold-out crowd of 2,195 at Lavietes Pavilion in  Boston 
two days ago included Jeremy Lin of the  Golden State Warriors ,
the only Harvard graduate to play in the  National Basketball
Association  since Ed Smith appeared in 11 games for the  New York
Knicks  in 1954.  Sophomore forward Kyle Casey led Harvard with 24 points
against Princeton, while Oliver McNally added 15.  Harvard outscored Princeton 42-31 during the second half
after taking a one-point halftime lead. Dan Mavraides had 25
points for the Tigers.  “A lot of people have tried, come close and put in a lot
of work and determination to try to do what we’ve done this
season,” Casey, the reigning Ivy League Rookie of the Year,
told reporters.  Overtime  The Tigers beat  Penn  62-59 in overtime the last time the
teams met, on Feb. 8 at Princeton. The Quakers (12-14, 5-5 Ivy)
lost at home to Princeton 58-51 last season.  “It’s just a blessing that we have another game to play,”
Princeton coach Sydney Johnson, 36, told reporters after the
Harvard defeat. “It’s almost a gift.”  Princeton has improved every year since Johnson, who
captained the Tigers for three seasons in the 1990s, arrived
from  Georgetown University  in 2007. The Tigers finished last in
the Ivy League in 2006-07 after winning two of 14 games. Since
then, they’ve twice finished second and improved to 22-9 overall
last year.  A venue and date for a playoff will be decided after
tomorrow’s game at Penn’s Palestra arena in Philadelphia. The
deciding game may be played March 11 or 12 at a neutral venue,
ESPN said on its website.  Carril  Princeton won 13 of its Ivy League titles under Pete Carril, who coached the Tigers for 29 years until he retired in
1996. Carril took the team to the NCAA tournament 11 times, with
perhaps his most memorable result coming in his final season,
when the Tigers beat the defending champion University of  California , Los Angeles 43-41.  Since Carril left with a 514-261 record, the Tigers have
won the conference five times, the last time in 2004.  Princeton, which counts former U.S. President Woodrow Wilson and Supreme Court Justices  Samuel Alito ,  Elena Kagan  and  Sonia Sotomayor  among its alumni, lost in the first round of the
2004 NCAA tournament to the University of  Texas . The Tigers have
a 13-27 record in 23 NCAA tournament appearances.  NCAA Success  Their best performance was in 1965, when they made the
Final Four after going 13-1 in the regular season. The NCAA
tournament featured 25 teams that year, and will have 68
entrants this year for the first time.  The Tigers will have to recover from the disappointment of
losing to Harvard and show their mettle to earn a share of the
conference title and with it a chance for a spot in the national
tournament, Johnson said.  “You go into the season and you want to see the character
of your team,” he said. “These guys are terrific in terms of
their passion for the game and how much they come together. I
don’t think the game in the Palestra is going to be easy. I’d be
very surprised if we can’t regroup.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
