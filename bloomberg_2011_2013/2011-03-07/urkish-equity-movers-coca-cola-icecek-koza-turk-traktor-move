  Turkey â€™s benchmark  ISE National 100
Index (XU100)  lost 895.25, or 1.5 percent, to 60,217.58 at the 5:30 p.m.
close in Istanbul.  The following stocks were active. Symbols are in

products in Turkey and the fifth largest bottler in the Coca-
Cola network, rose 40 kurus, or 2.2 percent, to 18.50 liras. The
company got a loan from 10 banks of $600 million at 1.8 percent
above benchmark lending rates to refinance maturing facilities
and finance new borrowing needs, it said in a filing with the
exchange today.    Koza Altin Isletmeleri AS (KOZAL)  , a gold producer, rose
90 kurus, or 4.6 percent, to 20.55 liras. Gold jumped to an all-
time high of $1,445.70 an ounce today as escalating violence in  Libya  and concern inflation will accelerate boosted demand for
the metal as an alternative asset.  Turk Traktor & Ziraat Makineleri AS (TTRAK TI), a maker of
tractors and farm equipment, climbed 70 kurus, or 2.8 percent,
to 25.90 liras. The company said it would purchase assembly
services from Otokar Otomotiv & Savunma Sanayi AS (OTKAR TI), a
bus and military vehicle maker, to meet growing domestic demand
for tractors. Otokar increased 85 kurus, or 3.9 percent, to
22.90 liras.  To contact the reporter on this story:
