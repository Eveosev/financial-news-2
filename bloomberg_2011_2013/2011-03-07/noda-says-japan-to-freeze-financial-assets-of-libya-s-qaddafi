Japanese Finance Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  said the government will impose sanctions on Libya to
penalize the administration of  Muammar Qaddafi  as it continues
to fight rebels seeking his ouster.  “As part of our efforts to work collectively with the
international community, we decided in the cabinet meeting to
freeze the assets of Qaddafi and six others,” Noda told
reporters during a press conference in Tokyo.  Noda was speaking after forces loyal to Muammar Qaddafi
extended their counteroffensive against rebels near the oil hub
of Ras Lanuf into a second day, launching airstrikes that
accelerated international planning for a no-fly zone over Libya.  To contact the reporter on this story:
