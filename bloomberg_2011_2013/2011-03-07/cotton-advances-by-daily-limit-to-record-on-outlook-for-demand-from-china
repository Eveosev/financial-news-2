Cotton rose to a record on signs
that global supplies may not satisfy demand in  China , the
world’s biggest consumer and producer.  China will actively expand imports this year, the Ministry
of Commerce said today in Beijing. The country’s January
imports jumped 31 percent from a year earlier to 390,720 metric
tons, the customs agency said last month. Prices have more than
doubled in the past year as consumption outpaced global
supplies.  “Demand fundamentals are working themselves out,” said
David Zeanah, a commodity broker at Keith Brown & Co., a
brokerage in Moultrie,  Georgia . “We don’t have any cotton;
everything you can get your hands on is worth gold right now.”  Cotton futures for May delivery rose by 1.44 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $2.1414 a pound at 2:50 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York , the seventh straight gain and the longest rally since
September 2009. Earlier, the price soared by the exchange limit
of 7 cents to a record $2.197.  U.S. export sales of upland cotton surged 56 percent to
403,341 bales in the week ended Feb. 24 from a week earlier as
shipments increased to China, Turkey and Bangladesh, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said March 3. A bale weighs 480
pounds, or 218 kilograms.  To contact the reporters on this story:
