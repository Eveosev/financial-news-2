Ukraineâ€™s farmers may plant more
corn and less barley because of cold weather, researcher
UkrAgroConsult said.  Ukraine will have freezing overnight temperatures for two
more weeks, preventing farmers from planting crops early,
UkrAgroConsult said in e-mailed note. A year ago, seeding
started at the end of March, it said. Prices for fuel, seeds and
pesticides have increased, the researcher said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
