  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  hired Stuart Hendel, who was picked to head  UBS AG (UBSN) ’s prime brokerage in 2009,
to take the same role at the biggest U.S.-based lender.  Hendel is leaving Zurich-based UBS and will start his new
job in June, reporting to Thomas Patrick and Michael Stewart,
global co-heads of global equities at Bank of America Merrill
Lynch, according to a statement today from the Charlotte, North
Carolina-based company.  Bank of America, the largest U.S. lender by assets,
acquired the prime brokerage unit in the 2009 takeover of
Merrill Lynch & Co. The business is part of the firm’s global
banking and markets division, which generated $6.3 billion in
profit last year. Hedge-fund managers rely on prime brokers for
loans, trade clearing and bookkeeping.  The global futures and derivatives clearing services group
will report to Hendel and Denis Manelski, who continues as head
of global short rates trading, according to the statement.  Two other UBS executives who reported to Hendel, Jonathan
Yalmokas and  Charlotte  Burkeman, also resigned today, the Wall
Street Journal reported earlier today. They didn’t immediately
respond to messages left at UBS.  Hendel has worked at Morgan Stanley and the Eton Park hedge
fund, where he was a founding partner, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
