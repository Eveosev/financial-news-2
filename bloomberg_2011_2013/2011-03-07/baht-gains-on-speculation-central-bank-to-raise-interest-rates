  Thailand ’s baht rose for a sixth day
on speculation the central bank will raise borrowing costs this
week to tame inflation, increasing the yield advantage on the
nation’s assets.  The currency touched a six-week high ahead of the Bank of
Thailand’s meeting to review its benchmark interest rate on
March 9. Fourteen of 16 economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect
the central bank to lift its policy rate by a quarter percentage
point to 2.50 percent and two predict no change. The MSCI Asia-
Pacific Index of regional stocks fell as  oil prices  rose to
$106.13, near the highest level in 29 months.  “The baht has got support from the rate-hike speculation
as its economy is quite solid,” said  Hideki Hayashi , a global
economist at Mizuho Securities Co. in Tokyo. “But rising oil
prices pose a threat to global economic growth and drops in
stocks cut risk appetite among investors, weighing on the Asian
currencies. So, there is no strong momentum for the baht to see
a sharp one-way move upward at this moment.”  The baht rose 0.1 percent to 30.44 per dollar as of 3:51
p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
earlier touched 30.42, the strongest level since Jan. 19. The
currency may trade between 30.20 and 30.70 through the end of
this month, Hayashi said.  The onshore one-year interest-rate swap, the fixed cost
needed to receive a floating payment, fell three basis points to
2.695 percent. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The Bank of Thailand lifted the policy rate at its last
meeting on Jan. 12 by 25 basis points to 2.25 percent and
signaled further increases. Consumer prices rose 2.87 percent in
February from a year earlier after gaining 3.03 percent the
previous month, official data released on March 1 showed.    Government bonds  were unchanged. The yield on the 3.125
percent debt due December 2015 held at 3.42 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
