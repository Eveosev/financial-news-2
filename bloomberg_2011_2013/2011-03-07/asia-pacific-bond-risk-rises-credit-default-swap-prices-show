The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default increased, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index rose 2 basis points to
108 basis points as of 11:12 a.m. in Sydney, according to Credit
Agricole CIB.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan climbed 1 basis point to 107.5 as of
8:12 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices
show. The Markit iTraxx Japan index rose 0.5 basis point to 100
as of 9:02 a.m. in Tokyo, Deutsche Bank AG prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on  credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporters on this story:
