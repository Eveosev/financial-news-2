Winter-wheat conditions in Kansas
and Texas were unchanged from last week, while crops in Oklahoma
improved, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said.  About 25 percent of the crop in  Kansas , the biggest U.S.
winter-wheat grower, was in good or excellent condition as of
yesterday, unchanged from the end of February, the USDA today
said in a report on its website.  About 18 percent of  Texas  crops were rated good to
excellent, unchanged from last week, and 22 percent of the
Oklahoma crop was good to excellent, up from 19 percent  a week
earlier , the USDA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
