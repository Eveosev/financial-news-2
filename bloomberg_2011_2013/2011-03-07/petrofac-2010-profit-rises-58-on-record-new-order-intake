  Petrofac Ltd. (PFC) , the oilfield services
and engineering provider, said 2010 profit rose 58 percent
following a record intake of orders.  Net income climbed to $557.8 million from $353.6 million in
2009, the London-based company said in a statement today. The
dividend rose 22 percent to 43.8 cents a share and revenue
increased 19 percent to $4.4 billion.  Chief Executive Officer Ayman Asfari pledged to increase
profit in 2011 by at least 15 percent after lifting the value of
the company more than sevenfold since the initial public
offering in 2005. Petrofac’s order backlog at the end of the
year stood at $11.7 billion, up from $8.1 billion in 2009, after
it won a contract to develop the South Yoloten project in  Turkmenistan , one of the world’s largest natural gas deposits
that should start supplying  China  in late 2013.  “We’re very busy right now,” Asfari said in an interview
with Bloomberg Television’s Francine Lacqua today. “We secured
another big order in January in Algeria, and the guidance we’re
giving is that we don’t expect any more major contracts in the
first part of the year.”  The shares rose 0.6 percent to close at 1,475 pence in  London .  Unrest in the Middle East and northern Africa has so far
had a minimal effect on the company, Petrofac said today. The
company had a small disruption in operations in  Tunisia  that
have since resumed, Asfari said.  In  Nigeria , Petrofac may help to fund Seven Energy’s bid
for field OML 34, Asfari said. His company owns a 15 percent
share of Seven.  Inflation is “creeping back into the industry” after oil
prices exceeded $100 a barrel, Asfari said, though the company
is usually able to pass on those higher costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
