Polygon Investment Partners LLP
offered investors in its failed Polygon Global Opportunities
Fund 72 cents on the dollar to withdraw from their remaining
positions in its flagship fund, the Financial Times reported,
citing a letter sent to investors last month. The move is
intended to bring to an end the wind-down begun after the $7.5
billion fundâ€™s 48 percent loss in 2008, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
