  Taiwan ’s export growth accelerated
to a seven-month high in February while inflation quickened,
bolstering the case for another interest-rate increase as early
as this month.  Shipments abroad rose 27.3 percent from a year earlier, the
 Ministry of Finance  said in Taipei today, exceeding the median
estimate for an 18.3 percent gain in a Bloomberg News survey of
16 economists. A separate report showed consumer prices advanced
1.33 percent in February, compared with a revised 1.1 percent
pace in January.  The central bank is due to meet March 31 to debate whether
to join neighbors from China to  South Korea  in raising borrowing
costs this year, after increasing them in 2010 to try and avert
a property bubble. The government forecasts economic growth of
4.92 percent this year and quickening inflation, indicating room
to raise the benchmark rate further.  “Steady Chinese demand and recoveries in  Europe  and the U.S.
may explain quickening export growth, while rising oil prices
will add upward pressure on consumer prices in coming months,”
Icy Hsu, an economist at Bank SinoPac in Taipei, said before the
release. She expects officials to increase the rate by 0.125
percentage point to 1.75 percent at their quarterly rate-setting
meeting this month.  Imports rose 28.7 percent for a trade surplus of $920
million, according to today’s data. The climb in consumer prices
was more than the estimated 1.1 percent increase in a Bloomberg
News survey of 17 economists, the inflation report showed.  Housing Prices  Today’s data were released after the close of trading on
the stock exchange. The benchmark Taiex stock index fell 0.8
percent. The  Taiwan dollar  advanced 0.1 percent to NT$29.426
against its U.S. counterpart at the 4 p.m. close, according to
Taipei Forex Inc.  Governor Perng Fai-nan and the policy board raised Taiwan’s
benchmark rate in three steps by a combined total of 0.375
percentage point last year as housing prices surged toward a
record.  Exports, which account for about two-thirds of gross
domestic product, propelled economic growth to a 24-year high of
10.82 percent in 2010. The government forecasts inflation will
quicken to 2 percent in 2011 from 0.96 percent last year.  Overseas shipments have boosted sales at companies
including Hsinchu, Taiwan-based  AU Optronics Corp. (2409) , the island’s
second-largest maker of liquid-crystal displays.  Export Value  The value of overall exports fell to $21.25 billion in
February, today’s report showed. Shipments to  China , Taiwan’s
biggest overseas market, rose 37.1 percent from a year earlier,
after a 10.6 percent increase in January. Shipments to the U.S.
advanced 24.5 percent after gaining 26.3 percent in January.  Exports of electronics products including semiconductors
rose 20.7 percent last month from a year earlier after
increasing 18.2 percent in January, today’s report showed.
Shipments of optical products, including panels used in flat-
panel TVs, increased 6.3 percent, after gaining 5.8 percent in
January.  Food prices rose 2.69 percent in February from a year
earlier, according to today’s inflation data. Housing costs
climbed 0.63 percent and the category including transportation
increased 1.42 percent, the statistics bureau said.  Core consumer prices, a category excluding vegetables,
fruit, fish and energy, climbed 0.8 percent from a year earlier
after increasing a revised 0.8 percent in January. Wholesale
prices, which track the cost of goods sold to retailers and
producers, rose 3.46 percent, compared with a revised 1.93
percent gain in January.  To contact the reporters on this story:
