Funding for U.S. state pension plans
improved in 2010 as the economy recovered from the recession, a
report from Wilshire Associates said.  The ratio of assets to liabilities of 126 U.S. state
retirement systems rose to 69 percent in fiscal 2010 from 65
percent the previous year, according to  Santa Monica ,
California-based Wilshire, a consulting firm. Most state fiscal
years begin July 1.  “This improvement in funding ratio reflects the U.S.
economy’s ongoing recovery from the global market dislocation
events of 2007 and 2008, and the resultant recession that
economists declared ended in June 2009,” said the report, which
was dated Feb. 28. “Growth in fund assets managed to outpace
growth in plan liabilities over fiscal 2010.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
