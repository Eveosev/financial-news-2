  FirstRand Ltd. (FSR) ,  South Africa ’s
second-biggest financial-services company, said full-year
profit almost tripled after it spun off the insurance unit
and bad debts fell.  Net income jumped to 12.1 billion rand ($1.76 billion)
from 4.52 billion rand a year earlier, the Johannesburg-based
lender said in a statement today. Normalized earnings, which
don’t take the insurance spinoff into account, gained more than
20 percent, the bank said.  The results were released a day early because Reuters
published information that “was not accessed from a source that
could be considered in the public domain,” the company said in
the statement. The firm’s website was breached, spokesman Sam Moss said in a telephone interview in Johannesburg today. The
company is investigating, he said.  FirstRand spun off and merged its insurance unit, Momentum
Group Ltd., with Metropolitan Holdings Ltd. last year to create  MMI Holdings Ltd. (MMI) , the country’s third-biggest listed insurer
after  Sanlam Ltd. (SLM)  and  Old Mutual Plc. (OML)  South African lenders have
been boosted by a fall in bad debts after the central bank cut
the benchmark interest rate to 5.5 percent last year.  FirstRand snapped two days of gains, losing 1.9 percent to
19.06 rand in Johannesburg, the steepest drop since Feb. 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
