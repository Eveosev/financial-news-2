  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  experienced a
breakdown in a hydrotreater at its Torrance refinery in
California, according to a source familiar with refinery
operations.  There is no feed going in or product coming out of the
unit, said the person, who is not authorized to speak for the
refinery.  Aarti Ramachandran, a spokeswoman for the refinery,
declined to specify what unit was down at the plant. She said
there was “an unplanned unit shutdown” that would have “some
impact to production.”  The 155,800-barrel-a-day plant reported flaring due to a
breakdown, according to a filing with the  South Coast Air
Quality Management District . The emissions started at 1:49 a.m.
local time and are expected to last until 12:00 p.m., the filing
indicated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
