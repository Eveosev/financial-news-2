  Eni SpA (ENI) ,  Italy ’s largest oil
company, gave notice it was planning to shut parts of its Venice
refinery for maintenance this month, the local authority said.  “Eni informs us that from March 2 they will start the
process to halt some plants,” according to a statement on
Venice’s city authority  website . Eni officials declined to
comment on the matter when called and e-mailed by Bloomberg
News.  The council didn’t specify which parts of the refinery
would shut, or for how long the units would be offline.  The refinery has the capacity to process 90,000 barrels of
crude oil a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
