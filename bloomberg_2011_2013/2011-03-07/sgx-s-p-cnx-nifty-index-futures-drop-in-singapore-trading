India’s benchmark stock index fell
the most in a week as an oil-price rally stoked inflation
concerns and an ally of Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  vowed to
pull out of his ruling coalition.    State Bank of India (SBIN) , the nation’s biggest, lost the most in
more than a week. Oil gained a second day, rising above $105 a
barrel in  New York , as unrest in Libya renewed concern supply
disruptions may spread. The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam said March
5 it would end support for Singh’s  National Congress  party-led
government over a disagreement on seats to be contested in a
regional election.  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , the biggest truckmaker and
owner of Jaguar Land Rover, dropped 4.2 percent.  “The political uncertainty has added to the existing
uncertainty of the markets,” said Sadanand Shetty, a Mumbai-
based fund manager at Taurus Asset Management Co., which manages
about $665 million. Inflation,  interest rates  and oil price
concerns are weighing on investors’ sentiment, he said.  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or Sensex,
lost 254.55, or 1.4 percent, to 18,231.90, according to
preliminary closing prices at 3:30 p.m. in Mumbai, the most
since Feb. 24. The S&P CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock
Exchange retreated 1.3 percent to 5,466.20, while its April
futures settled at 5,500.40. The BSE 200 Index slid 1.3 percent
to 2,236.95.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
