  International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM)  Chief Executive Officer  Sam Palmisano ’s compensation
increased 30 percent last year as the company exceeded its four-
year earnings target.  Palmisano, 59, received $31.7 million in total
compensation, including salary, stock awards and incentives,
compared with $24.3 million a year earlier, the Armonk, New
York-based company said today in a  regulatory filing .  The CEO’s non-stock incentive compensation almost doubled
to $9 million as IBM increased its full-year profit to $11.52 a
share, besting its goal of at least $10 set four years ago.
Palmisano set another long-term target for the company last
year, saying that operating earnings will almost double to $20 a
share in 2015.  IBM, the world’s biggest computer-services provider, fell
$1.90 to $159.93 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. The shares have climbed 9 percent this year.  Palmisano, who has led the company since March 2002,
received $4.75 million in non-stock incentive pay in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
