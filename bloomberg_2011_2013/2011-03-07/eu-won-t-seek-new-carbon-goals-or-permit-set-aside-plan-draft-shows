The European Union will say the bloc
should endeavor to achieve its existing emission-reduction
targets and will not propose setting aside any carbon allowances
from 2013, according to a draft document.  The European Commission will tomorrow present a policy paper
mapping the path for the bloc’s 2050 carbon-cut goals and a
document on  energy efficiency . The 27-nation EU is on track to
meet its goal of lowering greenhouse gas discharges by 20
percent in 2020, compared with 1990 levels.  “The priority remains to achieve all the targets already
set for 2020,” according to the draft document seen by
Bloomberg News. If the bloc delivers on its commitments, it
would enable the EU to outperform the current 20 percent target
and achieve a 25 percent reduction, it said.  The commission gave up its proposal to withhold between 500
million to 800 million carbon allowances from the market in the
next phase of its emissions trading system, which starts 2013,
to curb excess supply, according to the draft.  This was the latest in a series of drafts. A previous
version last month had proposed setting aside millions of
permits to force utilities and factories to make greater efforts
themselves to curb emissions sooner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
