Plans to force Irish banks to sell
off loan portfolios are being delayed by Irish regulators who
now favor a more gradual sale process, the Financial Times
reported, citing people familiar with the matter.  While regulators had planned a quick sale of the assets,
following a review of the banks’ portfolios there are
concerns that a “firesale” would result in greater-than-
expected losses for the banks and wipe out the European Union’s
and International Monetary Fund’s capital buffer, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
