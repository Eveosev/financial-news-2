Portuguese and Greek 10-year bonds
led the securities of the region’s most-indebted nations lower
after a cut in Greece’s credit rating spurred bets  Europe ’s debt
crisis may intensify.  Irish 10-year bond yields touched the highest level since
before the euro’s creation in 1999. German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  rebuffed a plea by Ireland to cut the cost of its EU
bailout two days ago, before meetings of European leaders this
month that aim to craft a comprehensive solution to the region’s
debt crisis. German bonds dropped after a gauge of European
investor confidence rose to the highest level in 3 1/2 years.  “The Greek downgrade certainly re-focuses the market’s
attention on the sovereign debt problems in Europe,” said Elwin de Groot, a senior market economist at Rabobank Groep in
Utrecht, the Netherlands. “The rise in the yields of these
countries really underlines the risk that there might be more
downgrades on the way. We’re slowly creeping towards the end-
game for  Portugal .”  The yield on Portuguese 10-year bonds rose eight basis
points to 7.55 percent as of 11:11 a.m. in London. The 4.8
percent securities maturing in June 2020 fell 0.45, or 4.5 euros
per 1,000-euro ($1,402) face amount, to 82.075. The yield
reached 7.636 percent on Feb. 10, the highest since at least
1997, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  German 10-year bonds fell, sending the yield two basis
points higher to 3.29 percent. The difference in yield, or
spread, between German and Portuguese 10-year securities widened
six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 426 basis points.  Credit-Default Swaps  Portugal plans to sell up to 1 billion euros of September
2013 notes on March 9, its second auction this year.  Investor concerns are rising even though Merkel has said
she will do “whatever is needed to support the euro,” and
promised that meetings scheduled for March 11 and on March 24
and 25 will produce a “comprehensive” solution to the crisis.  Moody’s lowered  Greece ’s rating three steps to B1 and said
the risk of default is rising, citing “implementation risks”
in the budget cuts demanded as a condition for a 110 billion-
euro international bailout last year.  Ten-year Greek bonds fell for the eighth-straight day,
pushing the spread over bunds to as high as 903 basis points,
the most since Jan. 11.  The cost of insuring Greek government debt jumped to the
highest in two months. Credit-default swaps on Greek bonds rose
25 basis points to 1,011, driving the Markit iTraxx SovX Western
Europe Index of swaps on 15 governments 3.5 basis points wider
to 181, the highest in a week. Contracts on Portugal climbed 10
basis points to 491.  Downgrade Timing  “It’s not so much about the downgrade per se, but more the
timing of it,” said  Karsten Linowsky , a strategist at Credit
Suisse Group AG in Zurich. “The fact that it comes in the midst
of discussions on the stability mechanism and uncertainty about
what the details of the package will look like reintroduces a
sense of urgency to announce something comprehensive, or
something that will be seen by the market as being sufficient.”    Fitch Ratings  said on March 4 it cut the outlook on Spanish
debt to “negative,” saying the potential cost of rescuing its
savings banks poses a risk to the economic recovery.  Spanish 10-year yields were three basis points higher at
5.41 percent, while equivalent-maturity Italian debt yielded
4.91 percent, up from 4.89 percent. The rate on Belgian
securities advanced four basis points to 4.32 percent.  The Irish 10-year yield climbed six basis points to 9.44
percent. It earlier reached 9.477 percent, the highest since
1993. The nation’s incoming government said it may need to
introduce laws allowing the restructuring of some senior bank
bonds, as the country’s debt level risks becoming
“unsustainable.”  German bonds fell after the Sentix research institute said
its index measuring sentiment in the 17-nation euro region rose
to 17.1 in March from 16.7 the previous month. That’s the
highest reading since September 2007. A gauge of current
business conditions climbed to 26 from 21.25, while an indicator
of expectations fell to 8.5 from 12.25.  To contact the reporters on this story:
