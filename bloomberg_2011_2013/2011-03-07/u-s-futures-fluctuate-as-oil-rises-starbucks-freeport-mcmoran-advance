U.S. stocks slid, erasing last
week’s advance, as escalating violence in Libya sent oil higher
and chipmakers tumbled after Wells Fargo & Co. reduced its
recommendation on the industry.    Intel Corp. (INTC) , the world’s largest semiconductor company,
slid 1.6 percent following Wells Fargo’s downgrade, while  Micron
Technology Inc. (MU)  lost 5.2 percent.  JDS Uniphase Corp. (JDSU)  fell 6.9
percent, the most in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, after  Ciena Corp. (CIEN) ’s revenue forecast missed analysts’ estimates.  Alcoa
Inc. (AA) , Intel Corp. and  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  lost at least 1.4
percent to lead declines in the  Dow Jones Industrial Average .  The S&P 500 slumped 0.8 percent to 1,310.13 at 4 p.m. in  New York  after climbing as much as 0.5 percent earlier and
advancing 0.1 percent last week. The Dow declined 79.85 points,
or 0.7 percent, to 12,090.03. Oil for April delivery surged as
much as 2.4 percent at $106.95 a barrel.  “Geopolitical concerns and the price of oil are the major
things driving the market,” said John Kattar, chief investment
officer at Eastern Investment Advisors in Boston, which manages
$1.7 billion. “It’s very volatile with the news flow being so
dominated by the Middle East.”  The  S&P 500  fell 0.7 percent on March 4, trimming a weekly
advance, as the surge in oil fueled concern  consumer spending 
may slow as Labor Department data showed average hourly earnings
were unchanged last month.  Oil’s Advance  The S&P 500 has lost 2.5 percent from a 32-month high on
Feb. 18 amid concern higher energy prices will hurt consumer
spending and corporate profits. The index is still up 94 percent
from its low of 676.53 on March 9, 2009, as improving corporate
profits, government stimulus efforts and takeovers fueled
confidence in equities.  Oil rose to a 29-month high as escalating violence in Libya
bolstered concern that supply disruptions may spread through the
Middle East. Crude climbed after fighting between Libyan rebels
and troops loyal to  Muammar Qaddafi  intensified. Hedge funds
raised purchases of futures to a record for a second week on
speculation unrest will cut output further. Citigroup Inc.
increased its Brent oil price estimate, saying the threat of
more disruptions supports a “fear premium.”  Gains in stocks earlier today also followed the
announcement of about $15 billion in potential global mergers
and acquisitions.  “Companies have a lot of cash on their balance sheets and
they’re under pressure to use it, whether it’s M&A, buybacks or
dividends,” said Matt McCormick, a money manager at Cincinnati-
based Bahl & Gaynor Inc., which oversees about $3.2 billion.
“Investors are taking risk off now, and there’s rotation to
higher-quality stocks, which may not be as impacted by
geopolitical risks and higher commodity and energy costs.”  Chipmakers Tumble  A gauge of semiconductor stocks fell 2.5 percent, the most
among 24 groups in the S&P 500, after Wells Fargo cut its
industry rating to “market weight” from “overweight,” citing
the 125 percent gain in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index
over the last two years. The downgrade “is more an indication
of a more moderate though still optimistic view of the sector
rather than any active concern about the chip stocks as a
group.”  Intel dropped 1.6 percent to $21.21. Micron Technology lost
5.2 percent to $11.03.  Broadcom Corp. (BRCM)  slipped 3.1 percent to
$40.74. Hewlett-Packard, the world’s largest computer maker,
retreated 1.5 percent to $41.98.  Ciena dropped the most in the Russell 1000 Index, sliding
9.8 percent to $25.98. The maker of network gear for the biggest
U.S. phone companies forecast second-quarter revenue of no more
than $435 million, missing the average analyst estimate of
$437.3 million.  JDS Uniphase, Cisco  JDS Uniphase, a competitor to Ciena, fell 6.9 percent to
$25.49 for the biggest decline in the S&P 500.  Cisco Systems
Inc. (CSCO) , the largest provider of networking equipment, retreated
1.1 percent $18.20.  An S&P 500 gauge of retailers, hotel chains and other
companies reliant on consumer spending slumped 1 percent. Walt
Disney helped lead the Dow lower, losing 1.2 percent to $43.02.    Western Digital Corp. (WDC)  surged 16 percent to $34.68. The U.S.
marker of hard-disk drives agreed to buy a rival unit of Hitachi
Ltd. for about $4.3 billion in cash and stock.  To contact the reporters on this story:
