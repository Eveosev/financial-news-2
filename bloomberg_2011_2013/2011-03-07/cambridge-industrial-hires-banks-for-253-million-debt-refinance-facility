  Cambridge Industrial Trust (CREIT) , a
Singapore-based real estate investor, borrowed S$320 million
($253 million) from four banks to refinance debt early,
according to a statement to the Singapore stock exchange.  One S$220 million facility will mature in three years while
another of S$100 million will mature in five, the statement said.
The term loans will pay 4.4 percent interest a year, including
amortization of any upfront costs, it said.  While the  term loan  Cambridge is refinancing isn’t due
until February, the company is “taking advantage of the current
market conditions to refinance ahead of time, with the aim of
reducing debt cost and future refinancing risk,” Chief
Executive Officer Chris Calvert said in the statement.  Cambridge , which has a S$928.5 million portfolio consisting
mainly of industrial parks and warehousing facilities, has
S$367.5 million of loans maturing before the end of 2013,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It reported net  income 
distributable to unit holders of S$44.2 million last financial
year, according to statements on its website.  National Australia Bank Ltd., HSBC Holdings Plc, Royal Bank
of Scotland Group Plc and Hong Leong Finance Ltd. are providing
the new loans, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
