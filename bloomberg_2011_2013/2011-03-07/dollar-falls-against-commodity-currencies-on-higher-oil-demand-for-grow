The dollar fell against currencies
linked to commodities as a surge in the price of raw materials
prompted demand for assets linked to growth.  The U.S. currency weakened against the Norwegian krone and
the Canadian dollar after oil rose to a 29-month high as
fighting in  Libya  intensified, boosting demand for the
currencies of oil-producing countries. The euro touched a four-
month high against the greenback as bets increased the  European
Central Bank  will raise  interest rates  before the  Federal
Reserve . New Zealand’s dollar weakened as loss estimates were
increased from the Feb. 22 earthquake in Christchurch.  “Almost all commodities are up on the day, especially oil,
so you have those currencies benefiting,” said  Fabian Eliasson ,
head of U.S. currency sales at Mizuho Financial Group Inc. in
New York. “There’s a bit more of a pullback in some safe
currencies.”  The dollar fell 0.4 percent to 5.5431 Norwegian krone at
10:47 a.m. in New York, from 5.5673 on March 4.  Canada ’s dollar
added 0.2 percent to 97.15 cents per  U.S. dollar  after touching
a more-than-three-year high on March 1.  The greenback dropped 0.1 percent to $1.3999 per euro after
touching $1.4036 and rose 0.3 percent to 82.04 yen.  Commodities, Oil  The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials added
0.7 percent to 365.48. Crude oil rose as much as 2.4 percent to
$106.95, the highest since September 2008.  “Money is really flying into commodity-based and higher-
yielding currencies,” said Blake Jespersen, director of foreign
exchange in Toronto at Bank of Montreal.  The Dollar Index, which IntercontinentalExchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S.
trading partners, including the euro and yen, slipped 0.1
percent to 76.310, after touching the weakest since Nov. 5.  The euro gained last week after policy makers left the
refinancing rate at 1 percent and ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said they may raise borrowing costs as early as their
next meeting in April to contain inflation. The implied yield on
the three-month Euribor contract expiring in December was at
2.16 percent today from 1.94 percent a week earlier, indicating
investors are increasing wagers on higher interest rates.  Trichet said the world’s central bankers are united in
their aim to prevent surging  oil prices  from fanning broader
inflation.  Trichet’s Inflation Stand  “There is amongst central bankers a solid unity of purpose
to continue to anchor solidly inflation expectations,” Trichet
said today in  Basel ,  Switzerland , after chairing the Global
Economy Meeting.  Morgan Stanley increased its year-end target for the single
currency to $1.45 from an earlier prediction of $1.24, Gabriel de Kock, a New York-based executive director, wrote in a
research report published yesterday. The currency will decline
to $1.34 by the end of December, according to the median of 44
strategists’ predictions compiled by Bloomberg News.  The euro also rose after an index measuring European
investor confidence rose to a 3 ½-year high. The index, which
measures sentiment in the euro region, increased to 17.1 for
March from 16.7 in February, Limburg, Germany-based  Sentix 
research institute said today.  Greek Rating  Moody’s cut  Greece ’s credit rating three steps to B1 from
Ba1, citing the rising risk of default. European Union leaders
are due to meet this month and try to agree to a package of
measures to contain the debt crisis that forced Greece and
Ireland to seek financial aid last year.  Investors have become so bullish on the euro against the
dollar that past trading trends suggest they may start reversing
those bets. The number of contracts that  hedge funds  and other
large speculators hold at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
anticipating a gain in the single currency jumped to 51,308 as
of March 4, according to the Washington-based Commodity Futures
Trading Commission.  The last time so-called net longs exceeded 45,000 contracts
was in October. The following month the euro weakened 6.9
percent against the dollar. They also topped the 45,000 mark a
year earlier, just before the currency began about a six-month,
21 percent decline.    New Zealand ’s  Treasury Department  said costs from the Feb.
22 quake that wrecked the central business district of
Christchurch may triple the estimated NZ$5 billion ($3.7
billion) bill from a temblor that hit the city in September. The
expense will be shared between the government, insurers and
businesses, Finance Minister Bill English said yesterday.  The  New Zealand dollar  traded at NZ$1.3784 per Australian
dollar from NZ$1.3735 in New York on March 4. It earlier touched
NZ$1.3789, the weakest level since June 1992. The kiwi bought
73.66 U.S. cents from 73.83 last week, when it reached 73.39
cents, the lowest since Oct. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
