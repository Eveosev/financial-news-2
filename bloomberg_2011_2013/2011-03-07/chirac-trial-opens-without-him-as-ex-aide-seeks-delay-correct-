(Corrects Chirac’s age in fourth paragraph of story
published March 7.)  Former French President  Jacques Chirac ’s trial began today without him as lawyers for another
defendant sought a delay.  Chirac co-defendant Remy Chardon, a chief of staff to the
former head of state while he served as mayor of Paris, will
argue Judge  Dominique Pauthe  should postpone the trial while a
higher court reviews his question on its constitutionality.  The allegations Chirac used city money to pay loyalists to
work for his political party date back two decades to his
mayoral term. The case was put on hold after he was elected
President because French law blocks investigation of a sitting
head of state for anything less than high treason.  The court waived 78-year-old Chirac’s appearance at today’s
opening as procedural questions will be debated.  Two investigations were conducted, one in Paris and one in
the nearby suburb of Nanterre. Both investigators leading those
probes recommended sending Chirac to trial over the opposition
of the local public prosecutors, and the cases were combined for
a single trial. Chardon questioned the constitutionality of that
merger.  To contact the reporter on this story:
