Hog futures fell the most since
October on signs that the demand for U.S. pork is weakening as
supplies increase. Cattle also declined.  Wholesale pork fell 0.9 percent to 91.25 cents a pound last
week, and the price of hogs for immediate delivery to
slaughterhouses declined 0.2 percent to 80.83 cents a pound,
according to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture . Last week,
meatpackers processed 1.5 percent more hogs than the previous
week, USDA data show.  There’s “a little weaker demand” from consumers, said
Bill Frejlich, a senior broker at Price Futures Group in  Chicago . “When the prices get high, people pull back a bit.”  Hog futures for April settlement fell 2.075 cents, or 2.3
percent, to settle at 86.4 cents a pound at 1:09 p.m. on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the biggest decline since Oct. 25.
Earlier, the price reached 86.25, the lowest for a most-active
contract since Jan. 25. The commodity has jumped 18 percent in
the past year.  Demand may ease as Catholics refrain from eating meat on
Fridays during Lent, which begins on March 9 this year,
pressuring prices, Frejlich said.  Cattle futures for April delivery declined 0.45 cent, or
0.4 percent, to settle at $1.136 a pound. The commodity has
gained 22 percent in the past 12 months.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement rose 0.025 cent
to $1.3475 a pound. Last week, the price reached a record of
$1.3495.  To contact the reporter on this story:
