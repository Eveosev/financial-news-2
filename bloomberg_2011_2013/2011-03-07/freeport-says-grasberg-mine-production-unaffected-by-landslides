Production at  Freeport-McMoran
Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) ’s Grasberg mine in  Indonesia ’s Papua province
is unaffected from landslides that happened over the weekend, a
spokesman at the company’s local unit said.  Landslides blocked a key access tunnel for workers to
return to the mine after the weekend break, Ramdani Sirait said.
There are enough workers at the mine to continue normal
operations, he said, adding there were no casualties from the
incident.  “The incident also does not impact the concentrate
shipments to buyers because the concentrate is transported from
the mine and mill to the port site by pipeline,” Sirait said in
an e-mailed response to questions. “We expect the access will
be returning to normal within days.”  Copper production at the Grasberg mine fell to 1.22 billion
pounds last year from 1.41 billion a year earlier, according to
Freeport’s  website.  Gold output declined to 1.79 million ounces
from 2.57 million.  Grasberg, which began operation in 1990, contains the
world’s largest recoverable reserves of copper and the biggest
single gold reserve, according to its website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
