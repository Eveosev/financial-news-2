Morgan Stanley said it was no longer
“bearish” on the euro given the outlook for the  European
Central Bank  to raise interest rates this year and next.  The single currency will strengthen to $1.45 by the end of
2011, according to Gabriel de Kock, an executive director at
Morgan Stanley in  New York , revising the earlier target of $1.24.
The ECB may raise interest rates next month for the first time
in almost three years to fight mounting inflation pressures,
President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said March 3.  “We no longer are bearish on the euro over the course of
2011,” De Kock wrote in a note published yesterday. “We have
realigned our euro forecasts to reflect Morgan Stanley’s changed
ECB call after President Trichet’s signals that policy
tightening is imminent.”  The euro will appreciate to 122 yen by Dec. 31, De Kock
wrote, revising the bank’s earlier projection for 115 yen.
Morgan Stanley also boosted its year-end target for the euro to
1.35 Swiss francs from 1.24 francs, and increased the target for
the share currency versus the pound to 90 pence from 78 pence.  “We expect broad-based gains after ECB rate hikes get
underway, most likely in April,” De Kock wrote.  The euro traded at $1.3983 as of 9:48 a.m. in Tokyo, after
jumping 1.7 percent last week on Trichet’s comments. The common
currency was at 1.2951 francs, and bought 86.01 pence.  Morgan Stanley anticipates the ECB will raise interest
rates by a quarter-percentage point three times this year and
three times in 2012, according to the note.  Trichet also said following the March 3 policy meeting that
an “increase of interest rates in the next meeting is
possible.”. He spoke in  Frankfurt  after the ECB left its key
rate at 1 percent, where it’s been since May 2009.  -- Editors: Nicholas Reynolds, Jonathan Annells  To contact the reporter on this story:
