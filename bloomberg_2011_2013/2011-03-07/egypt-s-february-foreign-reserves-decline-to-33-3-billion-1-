  Egypt ’s international reserves fell
for the second month in February, dropping to $33.3 billion from
$35 billion in January following the revolution that toppled
President  Hosni Mubarak .  “We had expected that the continued flow of capital out of
Egypt, in the wake of the political turmoil, would have led to
another sharp drop,” said Mohamed Rahmy, a Cairo-based
economist at Egyptian investment bank Beltone Financial. “Falls
in tourism revenue and the bank’s intervention on February 8 to
control the depreciating pound against the dollar over its first
days of trading would have also compounded the fall.”  Egypt’s foreign-exchange reserves fell by $1 billion in
January, according to data posted on the central bank’s website.  On Feb. 8, the Egyptian pound strengthened the most against
the dollar since November after the central bank acted to slow
declines in the currency amid protests demanding Mubarak’s
ouster. He stepped down on Feb. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
