New Stream Secured Capital Fund
(Cayman) Ltd. creditors filed a petition in  Delaware  court
seeking to force it into involuntary bankruptcy, saying the fund
owes $320 million to U.S. and Cayman creditors.  After losing $500 million on assets, the funds and
affiliates linked to New Stream Capital, based in Ridgefield,  Connecticut , tried to restructure with misleading disclosures
that excluded some assets, the investors said in court papers
filed today.  The investors, who say they’re owed $90 million, seek a
trustee to oversee the bankruptcy.  “The appointment of a Chapter 11 trustee is made all the
more urgent because New Stream’s management and the liquidators
have distributed a prepackaged joint plan of liquidation,” the
group wrote. They also said the funds overvalued life insurance
assets to appear profitable.  New Stream Capital describes itself as a  fund manager 
specializing in “non-traded private debt.” It specializes in
the life settlement market, where life insurance policies are
purchased for less than the death benefit from owners of
policies on individuals’ lives.  A prepackaged Chapter 11 plan is to be filed in Delaware by
March 11, and the deadline for voting is March 8, according to a
Feb. 4 notice provided by three law firms representing
investors.  The case is In re New Stream Secured Capital Fund (U.S.)
LLC, 11-10690 U.S. Bankruptcy Court District of Delaware
(Delaware).  To contact the reporter on this story:
