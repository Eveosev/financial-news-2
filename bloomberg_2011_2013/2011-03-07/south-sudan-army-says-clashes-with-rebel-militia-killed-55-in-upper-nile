Clashes between  Southern Sudan ’s
army and a rebel militia yesterday killed at least 55 people in
Upper Nile state, army spokesman Philip Aguer said.  The militia attacked Southern Sudanese soldiers yesterday
at a market in a village called Owath, killing one soldier and
wounding another, Aguer said today by phone from Juba, the
regional capital. An hour later the armed forces struck a
militia position and 47 rebel fighters were killed, along with
seven soldiers, he said.  “We’re determined to clear the area from this group which
is intimidating the civilians,” Aguer said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
