Following is the text of U.S. employment trends index
from the Conference Board.  The Conference Board Employment Trends Index increased in February for the
fifth consecutive month. The index now stands at 101.7, up from January’s revised
figure of 100.1. The index is up over 8 percent from a year ago.  Says Gad Levanon, Associate Director, Macroeconomic Research at The Conference
Board: “In the past half year, the economy has been adding, on average, about
110,000 jobs per month. The strong growth in the Employment Trends Index suggests
that the pickup in jobs may accelerate in the next couple of quarters. However, with
a shrinking government, a stagnant construction sector, and a manufacturing recovery
that has only a small impact on overall employment, overall job growth will still be
modest.”  This month’s increase in the ETI was driven by positive contributions from
seven out of the eight components. The improving indicators included Consumer
Confidence “Jobs Hard to Get,” Initial Claims for Unemployment Insurance, Percentage
of Firms With Positions Not Able to Fill Right Now, Number of Temporary Employees,
Part-Time Workers for Economic Reasons,  Industrial Production  and Real Manufacturing
and Trade Sales. The Employment Trends Index aggregates eight labor-market
indicators, each of which has proven accurate in its own area. Aggregating
individual indicators into a composite index filters out so-called “noise” to show
underlying trends more clearly.  The eight labor-market indicators aggregated into the Employment Trends Index
include  Percentage of Respondents Who Say They Find “Jobs Hard to Get” (The Conference
Board Consumer Confidence Survey)  Initial Claims for Unemployment Insurance (U.S. Department of Labor)  Percentage of Firms With Positions Not Able to Fill Right Now (National
Federation of Independent Business Research Foundation)  Number of Employees Hired by the Temporary-Help Industry   U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics )  Part-Time Workers for Economic Reasons (BLS)  Job Openings (BLS)  Industrial Production (Federal Reserve Board)  Real Manufacturing and Trade Sales (U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis)  The Conference Board publishes the Employment Trends Index monthly, at 10 a.m.
