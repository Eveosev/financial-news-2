  China  Vanke Co. said demand for its
homes will withstand government efforts to cool speculation this
year after it became the nation’s first real estate company to
surpass 100 billion yuan ($15 billion) in annual sales.  “Our customers are mainly those who buy and live in their
homes,” President Yu Liang said in a statement late yesterday
after Shenzhen-based Vanke reported a 37 percent gain in 2010
profit that exceeded analysts’ estimates. “Speculators faded
after government curbs.”  Vanke shares climbed to a three-week high after the company
pledged to continue its “quick turnaround” policy for building
homes, damping concern sales will slow. China has boosted down-
payment ratios, restricted loans and raised  interest rates  three
times since October as it seeks to cool  home prices  and prevent
an asset bubble.  The developer’s “prices and profit margins exceeded
estimates because of significant increases in  house prices  in
2010,” Yin Zi and Zhu Jin, analysts at Shenyin & Wanguo
Securities Co., wrote in a report today and maintained their
“buy” rating. “The company’s ability to defy the industry
cycle is better than rivals because of sound asset quality and
cash flow.”  The stock of China’s biggest developer by market value rose
1.8 percent to 8.53 yuan at the close in Shenzhen, the highest
since Feb. 16, bringing the year’s gain to 3.8 percent. A
measure tracking property stocks on the benchmark  Shanghai 
Composite Index rose 0.7 percent today.  ‘No Hoarding’  Net income last year climbed to 7.3 billion yuan, or 0.66
yuan a share, from 5.3 billion yuan, or 0.48 yuan a year
earlier, the company said in a Shenzhen stock exchange statement
yesterday. That’s more than the 7 billion yuan average estimate
of 15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Vanke said it will quickly build homes on land it buys
rather than hold sites, a strategy that helped drive sales last
year. Contract sales rose 71 percent to 108 billion yuan in
2010, making it the first Chinese developer to exceed 100
billion yuan, and reaching a target it set for 2014. Developers
typically sell homes and book earnings from the properties
progressively as they are developed.  “Vanke will take the same strategy in 2011 to serve the
demands of our customers,” said Yu. “Vanke is maintaining its
policy of no hoarding of land and homes, and a quick turnaround
of projects.”  About 88 percent of Vanke’s 2010 home sales were from
apartments of 144 square meters (1,227 square feet) or smaller,
Yu said.  Contract Sales  Revenue rose 3.8 percent to 50.7 billion yuan, the
Shenzhen-based developer said. The company also cut
administrative costs, which fell to 1.7 percent of sales
expenses last year from 2.3 percent in 2009, it said.  Vanke said on Feb. 24 it was “confident” sales will stay
above 100 billion yuan in 2011. Contract sales more than tripled
to a record 20.1 billion yuan in January and doubled to 6.1
billion yuan last month, it said. Vanke had about 38 billion
yuan of cash at year-end, up 64 percent from early 2010,
according to the statement.  “The momentum of the company remains good,” Frank Chen, a
Hong Kong-based property analyst at BNP Paribas Securities SA,
said before the earnings. “It won’t be very difficult for their
sales to stay above 100 billion again this year.”  Locked In Sales  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said Vanke’s contract sales
estimate for 2011 has been “locked in” based on data in the
first two months and revenue it hasn’t booked from 2010. Average
selling prices in the first two months also suggested that
margins will improve further in 2011 and 2012, it said in a
report today, maintaining its “buy” rating on the stock.  The company has operations in 46 cities after entering 12
markets last year, including the southern city of Kunming and
western city of Urumqi. It added 87 new projects last year.  China’s property prices increased every month in 2010, the
year the nation surpassed Japan to become the world’s second-
largest economy.  The government imposed measures including a ban on third
mortgages last year to curb speculation. This year, it raised
the minimum down-payment for second-home purchases and told
local governments to set price targets for new properties, and
introduced residential taxes in Shanghai and Chongqing.  Vincent Lo, chairman of Shanghai-based Shui On Land Ltd.,
said on March 6 that he expects home sales in China will fall
“sharply” this year because of the measures. Poly Real Estate
Group Co., the nation’s second-biggest developer, said last week
the current round of curbs doesn’t change its bullish outlook in
the medium to long term.  --Bonnie Cao, with assistance from Zhang Shidong in Shanghai,
