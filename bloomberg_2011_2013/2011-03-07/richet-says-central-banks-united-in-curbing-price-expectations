European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  the world’s central bankers are united in
their aim to prevent surging oil prices from fanning broader
inflation.  “There is amongst central bankers a solid unity of purpose
to continue to anchor solidly inflation expectations,” Trichet
said today in Basel, Switzerland, after chairing the Global
Economy Meeting. In emerging nations “you see strong signs of
inflationary threat” and in advanced economies “we are all
looking at avoiding second-round effects and anchoring inflation
expectations,” Trichet said.  Global rate setters are growing more concerned about
inflation threats as the world economy gathers strength and food
and oil prices surge. Crude oil rose to the highest in 29 months
in  New York  today as escalating violence in  Libya  renewed
concern that supply disruptions may spread through the Middle
East and North Africa.  To contact the reporters on this story:
