The U.S.  Supreme Court  refused to
let a New York Jets fan sue the New England Patriots and coach  Bill Belichick  over the 2007 “spygate” videotaping scandal.  The justices today turned aside an appeal by Carl J. Mayer,
a New Jersey lawyer and Jets season-ticket holder who said the
Patriots cheated him and other fans out of their right to see
honest competition on the field. A lower court had thrown out
the lawsuit.  Belichick and the Patriots were fined a combined $750,000
for videotaping the Jets’ signals during a 2007 game in
violation of National Football League rules.  The case is Mayer v. Belichick, 10-867.  To contact the reporter on this story:
