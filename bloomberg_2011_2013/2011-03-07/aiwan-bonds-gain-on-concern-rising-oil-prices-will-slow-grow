  Taiwan ’s government bonds gained as
concern surging oil prices will slow the global economic
recovery spurred demand for fixed-income securities.  The yield on the benchmark 10-year debt declined for the
first time in three days as crude advanced 1.6 percent to
$106.06 a barrel after fighting between Libyan rebels and troops
loyal to Muammar Qaddafi showed no signs of abating. The  trade
surplus  shrank to $920 million in February, from $1.9 billion
the previous month, the government reported after the  bond
market  closed today.  “Basically the theme is still oil,” said Eric Hsing, a
debt trader at First Securities Inc. in Taipei. “Bond yields
still have room to go down as investors are worried  oil prices 
will weigh on growth.”  The yield on the 1.375 percent note due March 2021, the
most-traded government debt, fell one basis point to 1.42
percent, according to Gretai Securities Market, the island’s
biggest bond exchange.  Taiwan’s dollar strengthened 0.1 percent to NT$29.426
versus the greenback as of the 4 p.m. local time close,
according to Taipei Forex Inc. The currency has appreciated 3.2
percent so far this year, the best performance among the 10
most-traded Asian currencies.  The consumer-price index increased 1.33 percent last month
from a year earlier, compared with a 1.11 percent gain in
January, official data released today show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
