  James River Coal Co. (JRCC) , an owner of
mines in Appalachia and the Illinois Basin, rose the most in 22
months on plans to buy International Resource Partners LP for
$475 million in cash to boost coal output and shipping.  James River climbed $2.64, or 13 percent, to $22.89 at 10
a.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading after touching
$23.50, the steepest gain since May 1, 2009. The shares have
gained 28 percent in the past year.  International Coal’s mines produced 1.9 million tons of
coal last year, James said in a PRNewswire statement. Most of
that was metallurgical coal, used to produce steel.  “James River is transforming itself by basically doubling
the size of the company and significantly expanding its met coal
presence, all at a very reasonable valuation,”  Jeremy Sussman ,
an analyst at Brean Murray Carret & Co. in  New York , wrote in a
note to clients.  The purchase includes Logan & Kanawha Coal Co., a coal
marketing and trading business that helped boost International
Resource’s total coal shipments to 3.7 million tons.
International Resource reported 2010 consolidated revenue of
$490.3 million.  James River secured $375 million in financing from Deutsche
Bank AG and UBS AG for the deal.  International Resource Partners was owned by Kayne Anderson
Energy Development Co., Lightfoot Capital Partners, Tortoise
Capital Resources Corp. and a firm controlled by IRP’s chairman,
James Harless.  Deutsche Bank was James River’s financial adviser and UBS
advised International Resource, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
