Loch Capital Management LLC, one of
four hedge funds raided by the  Federal Bureau of Investigation 
in November, closed its funds at the end of 2010, according to a
person familiar with the situation.  Loch Capital has since returned assets to investors and
laid off its employees, according to the person, who asked not
to be named because the firm is private.  The firm was raided as part of a broader U.S. government
investigation of  insider trading  in the financial-services
industry and the use of “professional networks,” the Boston-
based company told its clients in a December letter. The
networks provide research and connect industry experts with
investors.  Timothy McSweeney and Todd McSweeney, the twin brothers who
run the firm, are not the focus of the investigation, the firm
said in the letter.  Leonard Pierce, a lawyer representing Loch, declined to
comment on the fund’s closure.  Three of the four  hedge funds  raided by the FBI in November
-- New York-based Level Global Investors LP, Barai Capital
Management LP of  New York  and Loch -- have closed their funds.
Diamondback Capital Management LLC investors pulled about $1.32
billion, or 23 percent, after the firm, based in Stamford,
Connecticut, placed one of its technology portfolio managers on
leave following the raid.  To contact the reporters on this story:
