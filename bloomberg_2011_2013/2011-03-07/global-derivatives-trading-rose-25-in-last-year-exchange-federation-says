Global derivatives trading on
exchanges rose the most since 2003 last year as volume for
contracts listed to commodities surged, the World Federation of
Exchanges said.  Volume rose 25 percent to 22.4 billion contracts last year,
according to a statement from the Paris-based trade group, which
has 52 members that list a total of 45,000 stocks around the
world. Commodity derivatives trading rose 34 percent, with
Chinese exchanges making up more than half of that volume,
according to the report.  “Reforms in regulation of over-the-counter derivatives
markets are causing participants to shift some of their risk
transfer activities to exchange-traded derivatives,” Ronald Arculli, chairman of WFE and chairman of Hong Kong Exchanges &
Clearing Ltd., said in the statement.  Investors are turning to exchange-listed derivatives
instead of private, customized over-the-counter transactions,
Arculli said in the statement. The outstanding notional amounts
of OTC contracts fell by 13 percent from June 2009 to June 2010,
WFE said, citing data from the  Bank for International
Settlements .  Futures trading increased 35 percent last year to 11.2
billion contracts while options trading rose 16 percent to 11.1
billion, according to WFE. Volume was 17.8 billion in 2009, WFE
said.  Equity derivatives trading rose 14 percent last year, with
the fastest growth rate, 20 percent, in  Asia . Interest-rate
derivatives increased 29 percent, reversing a 23 percent plunge
in 2009. Currency derivatives rose 144 percent to 2.3 billion,
the smallest segment, with 71 percent of volume concentrated in
Indian markets.  Derivatives are contracts that have values determined by
the underlying assets. Futures are agreements to buy or sell an
underlying commodity or financial product at a determined later
date. Options give the right, without the obligation, to buy or
sell a security at a certain price by a given date.  To contact the reporter on this story:
