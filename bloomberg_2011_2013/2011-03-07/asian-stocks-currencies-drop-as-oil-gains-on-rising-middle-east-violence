Asian stocks and currencies fell for
the first time in three days as rising violence in the Middle
East drove  oil prices  higher and China pledged to curb inflation.  The MSCI  Asia  Pacific Index dropped 1.1 percent to 137.83
as of 1:59 p.m. in Tokyo, led by a 1.9 percent drop in Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average. Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures
fell 0.5 percent after the U.S. gauge slipped on March 4 amid
concern the surge in crude oil to a 29-month high will curtail
growth. South Korea’s won and Malaysia’s ringgit weakened, while
silver rose to the highest since 1980.  Fighting between Libyan rebels and troops loyal to Muammar Qaddafi intensified yesterday in violence that has cut crude-oil
production in the nation by as much as 1 million barrels a day,
according to the International Energy Agency. In  Saudi Arabia ,
websites have called for a “Day of Rage,” according to Human
Rights Watch. Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said on March 5 that
controlling prices is the nation’s top priority.  “The Middle East problem has not yet ended and the oil
factor is driving the won lower,” said Sam Hong, a currency
dealer at Shinhan Bank in Seoul. “Another big issue is  China ’s
plan to tackle inflation, which will cap China’s growth.”  More than three times as many stocks fell as rose on the
MSCI Asia Pacific Index. A measure of energy producers was the
only one of 10 industry groups tracked on the gauge to rise. The
Nikkei 225 declined as Japan’s Foreign Minister Seiji Maehara
resigned in the latest blow to Prime Minister Naoto Kan’s
government.  U.S. Jobs  S&P 500 Index futures fell today as the U.S. gauge
approached the second anniversary of the 2009 market bottom. The
index slid 0.7 percent to 1,321.15 in New York on March 4, as
the surge in oil fueled concern consumer spending may slow,
underscored by Labor Department data showing average hourly
earnings were unchanged last month. Separate figures showed U.S.
employers added 192,000 workers in February, compared with the
196,000 median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.    Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index fell as much as 0.8 percent
today as new  trading hours  took effect. The trading day will
begin 30 minutes earlier, while the lunch break will be moved
forward by 30 minutes to noon and reduced to 90 minutes, from
two hours.  Gold stocks in Asia climbed, with Zijin Mining Group Co,
China’s biggest, adding 1.2 percent in Hong Kong and  Newcrest
Mining Ltd. (NCM) ,  Australia ’s biggest gold producer, rising 0.3
percent in Sydney.  Cnooc Ltd. (883) , China’s biggest offshore oil
producer, increased 1.7 percent, while Inpex Corp., Japan’s
biggest energy explorer, gained 1.7 percent. Korean Air Lines
Co.,  Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. (293)  and  Qantas Airways Ltd. (QAN)  all
slumped on concern higher oil prices will increase fuel costs.  Oil Surges  Crude for April delivery increased as much as $1.97 to
$106.39 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , the highest intraday price since September
2008. Brent crude for April settlement gained 1.2 percent to
$117.38 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures  Europe  exchange.  Citigroup Inc. raised its Brent crude estimate as the
threat of output disruptions supports a “fear premium.” Prices
closed 6.7 percent higher last week after a U.S. government
report showed the nation’s jobless rate fell in February to the
lowest since April 2009.  Websites have called for a nationwide “Day of Rage” on
March 11 and March 20 in Saudi Arabia, Human Rights Watch said
Feb 28. Protests in five of the kingdom’s eight immediate
neighbors have prompted King Abdullah to boost spending on
housing, social welfare and education.  “It’s still very much a Middle Eastern story,” said  Ben Westmore , a minerals and energy economist at National Australia
Bank Ltd. in  Melbourne . “The market was pretty pleased with the
U.S. non-farm payroll numbers, which shows some improvement in
the labor market.”  China Stocks  China’s stocks rose to the highest in more than three
months, led by consumer and energy companies, after the
government said domestic consumption will drive economic growth.
       Gree Electric Appliances Inc. (000651)  and Qingdao Haier Co., the
country’s biggest maker of air conditioners and refrigerators,
gained more than 4 percent after Premier Wen said incentives for
rural purchases of home appliances may boost spending.  “There will be active investment and construction
activities at the beginning of the five-year plan,” said
Victoria Mio, a Hong Kong-based portfolio manager at Robeco Hong
Kong Ltd., whose parent oversees $200 billion. “The A-share
market has a window of opportunity for a rebound.”  The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, gained 1.6 percent to 2,988.57, the
highest since Nov. 15. Gree Electric, China’s largest maker of
home air-conditioners, jumped 5.6 percent. Haier, the nation’s
biggest manufacturer of refrigerators, gained 4.5 percent.  Social Stability  The government will target 8 percent economic growth this
year and “decisively” curb increases in prices that may
threaten social stability, Wen said in his state-of-the-nation
report on the opening session of the National People’s Congress
over the weekend.  South Korea’s won retreated from a two-week high on concern
the trade balance will deteriorate as unrest in the Middle East
drives oil costs higher and China’s inflation fight hurts
exports. The currency and the  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  of shares fell for the
first time in three days. South Korea is Asia’s fourth-largest
importer of the fuel.  ‘Fear Premium’  The won slid 0.5 percent to 1,119.65 per dollar, the
Philippine peso weakened 0.2 percent to 43.360 and Malaysia’s
ringgit declined 0.1 percent to 3.0325.  Cash silver increased as much as 2.3 percent to $36.4075 an
ounce, the highest level since February 1980. Immediate-delivery
bullion rose 0.4 percent to $1,436.4 an ounce in  Singapore . The
metal gained to an all-time high of $1,440.32 on March 2.  The euro dipped from a four-month high on speculation that
European leaders will struggle to agree on measures to counter
the region’s sovereign-debt crisis. Ireland’s Fine Gael-Labour
coalition, due to take power on March 9,  said  that laws may be
needed to “extend the scope of bank liability restructuring”
to include senior unsecured unguaranteed bank bonds.  The euro traded at $1.3977 in Tokyo from $1.3987 in  New
York  last week. The currency reached as high as $1.4008 on March
4, the most since Nov. 8. It fetched 114.96 yen from 115.13 yen.  German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  has said she will do
“whatever is needed to support the euro,” and promised that
meetings scheduled for March 11 and then on March 24 and 25 will
produce a “comprehensive” solution to Europe’s debt crisis.  New Zealand’s dollar reached the weakest level in 18 years
against its Australian counterpart as Prime Minister John Key
reiterated his support for a cut in the benchmark interest rate.
The government said it may need to borrow more and spend less
after the deadliest earthquake in 80 years caused as much as
NZ$15 billion ($11 billion) of damage.  The New Zealand dollar traded at NZ$1.3719 per Australian
dollar and earlier touched NZ$1.3789, the weakest level since
June 1992.  To contact the reporters on this story:
