Mubadala Development Co., an
investment arm of the Abu Dhabi government, said it increased
its share in Abu Dhabi-based John Buck International Properties
LLC to 100 percent, the company said in an e-mailed statement
today.  “The acquisition will enable the closer integration of JBI
with Mubadala’s existing real estate and construction management
operations,” the statement said. John Buck International will
continue to operate infrastructure projects on Mubadala’s Sowwah
Island.  Tom Mikus, who recently joined Mubadala from Saudi-based Al
Rajhi Group, has been named chief executive officer of the new
company, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
