Japan’s bonds gained, with yields
falling from near a two-week high, as rising  oil prices  and
escalating tensions in the Middle East weighed on the outlook
for global growth.  Ten-year futures advanced for the first time in three days
as a decline in stocks boosted demand for the relative safety of
government debt. Oil prices climbed to a 29-month high in New
York on concern violence will keep spreading in the Middle East
and disrupt the crude supply.  “Rising oil is considered a downside risk for the economy
in the U.S. and Japan, which is positive for bonds,” said Akio Kato, Tokyo-based team leader for Japanese debt at Kokusai Asset
Management Co., which runs the $32.8 billion Global Sovereign
Open fund. “Bonds are advancing following overseas moves.”  The yield on the 1.3 percent bond due March 2021 fell 2.5
basis points to 1.27 percent as of 3:49 p.m. in Tokyo at Japan
Bond Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker.
The price rose 0.222 yen to 100.266 yen. The yield increased to
1.315 percent on March 4, the most since Feb. 18.  Ten-year futures for March delivery gained 0.36 to 139.71
at the afternoon close at the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  Crude for April delivery increased as much as $1.97 to
$106.39 a barrel in  New York , the highest intraday price since
September 2008. The increase in oil prices boosted Treasuries
for a second day.  Focus on Slowdown  “People are focusing on an economic slowdown due to
surging oil, which caused Treasuries to be bought,” said  Takafumi Yamawaki , chief rate strategist at JPMorgan Chase & Co.
in Tokyo. “Investors find it easy to cover short positions in
bond futures.” A short position is a bet an asset will fall.  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average dropped 1.8 percent today,
snapping a two-day gain.  Japanese Foreign Minister Seiji Maehara resigned yesterday
after accepting campaign contributions from a non-Japanese
resident, in another blow to Prime Minister  Naoto Kan . Chief
Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano will take on Maehara’s portfolio
temporarily, Kan said today.  The resignation of Maehara “will have a limited impact on
the market because Japan’s political confusion is nothing new,”  Shinji Nomura , chief debt strategist at Nikko Cordial Securities
Inc. in Tokyo, wrote today in a note to clients.  The  Finance Ministry  will sell 600 billion yen ($7.29
billion) of 30-year bonds tomorrow.  The previous auction of the securities on Jan. 13 drew bids
for 5.77 times the amount on offer, down from a so-called bid-
to-cover ratio of 2.95 at the December sale.  Japan’s bonds have handed investors a loss of 0.9 percent
since Dec. 31, paring the gain in the fiscal year ending march
31 to 1.6 percent, according to an index compiled by Merrill
Lynch & Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
