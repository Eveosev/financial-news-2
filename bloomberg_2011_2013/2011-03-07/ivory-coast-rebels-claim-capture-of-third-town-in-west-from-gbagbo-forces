Rebels in the  Ivory Coast  who back  Alassane Ouattara  as the nation’s elected leader said they took
control of a western town from forces loyal to incumbent
President  Laurent Gbagbo .  The New Forces insurgents drove out Gbagbo forces from
Touleupleu, located in the Moyen Cavally region close to the
Liberian border, after clashes yesterday, rebel spokesman Lass
Com said today by phone from Man, the biggest city in the 18
Montagnes region. Pascal Tadet, a resident of the town,
confirmed the group was in control.  “New Forces have been in the city since yesterday,” he
said by phone from the town. “The clashes were very violent. A
lot of people fled the city to take refuge in the bush or in
Blolequin, the closest town from here.”  Touleupleu is the third western town that the insurgents
have occupied in the past two weeks, following their capture of
Zouan Hounien and Bin-Houye, located in the north of Touleupleu,
on Feb. 25.  At least 365 people have been killed in the world’s top
cocoa-producing nation since a disputed Nov. 28 presidential
election left the West African nation with two rival
administrations, according to the  United Nations .  To contact the reporter on this story:
