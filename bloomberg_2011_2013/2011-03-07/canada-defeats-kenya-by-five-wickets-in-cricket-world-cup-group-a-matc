Jimmy Hansra’s 70 runs led  Canada  to
a five-wicket win over Kenya in their Group A Cricket World Cup
match today in  New Delhi .  Canada reached 199-5 in response to Kenya’s innings of 198
in the 50-over match. The victors reached the total with 27
balls left. Hansra was caught off Nehemiah Odhiambo. Canadian
captain Ashish Bagai finished on 64 not out.  Neither team had won in three previous matches before
today. The result leaves Canada with 2 points, behind  Zimbabwe 
and above Kenya in the seven-team group. The top four teams in
each of the competition’s two groups move into the
quarterfinals.  Tanmay Mishra and Thomas Odoyo were each out on 51 runs to
lead  Kenya , which recovered from losing opening batsman Maurice
Ouma for a duck on his second ball.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
