Sasol Ltd. (SOL) , the largest producer of
motor fuels made from coal, releases earnings for the six months
through December.  The Johannesburg-based company said earnings per share
probably rose between 17 percent and 27 percent during its
fiscal first half as it curbed costs and as oil and chemical
prices climbed.  Gains were eroded by the strength of the South African
rand, while the sale of a stake in a mining unit to black
investors reduced earnings by 1 rand ($0.14) a share, Sasol said
in statement on Feb. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
