The European Banking Authority plans
to introduce a “near-fail” category into the stress-test
process as part of a more robust mechanism for compelling weaker
banks to recapitalize, the Financial Times reported.  All but seven of 91 banks that underwent stress tests a
year ago passed a 6 percent tier one capital threshold, a
measure of financial strength; they included two Irish banks
that had to be bailed out four months later, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
