  Swedbank AB (SWEDA) , the biggest lender in
the Baltic countries, purchased a minority stake in AS Arealis
to “stabilize” the Estonian property developer.  Swedbank’s subsidiary FR&R Invest AB will buy 50 percent
minus one share in Tallinn-based Arealis from Nordic Contractors
AS as a financial investment for three to five years, the
companies said in a joint e-mailed statement. The equity capital
of Arealis is 49 million euros ($68.6 million) after the deal,
it added.  “We see this as an opportunity to stabilise the company,”
Priit Perens, the head of the Estonian unit of Swedbank, said in
the statement. “After restructuring the loans, FR&R Invest AB
further reduces the leverage of AS Arealis by taking an equity
position in the company.”  The rental area of Arealis’ cash-flow projects is 36,100
square meters, which makes the company one of the largest in  Estonia , the companies said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
