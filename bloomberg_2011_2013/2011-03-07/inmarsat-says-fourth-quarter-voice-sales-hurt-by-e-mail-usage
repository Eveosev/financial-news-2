  Inmarsat Plc (ISAT) , the biggest provider
of satellite services to the maritime industry, fell the most
since October 2008 after saying fourth-quarter voice revenue was
hurt as seamen used cheaper e-mail rather than phone services.  Fourth-quarter marine voice-services sales declined 3.9
percent to $24.7 million, the London-based company said today in
a statement. Full-year profit rose 71 percent as earthquakes in
Haiti and  Chile  boosted demand, Inmarsat said.  Shares declined as much as 97.5 pence, or 14 percent, to
587 pence, and were at 608 pence at 9:55 a.m. in  London , giving
the company a market value of 2.8 billion pounds ($4.6 billion).  Inmarsat benefits as companies boost spending on
communication in the economic recovery. The company had 6,000
FleetBroadband terminals, which allow ship workers to use e-
mail, installed at the beginning of 2010 and 16,000 by year end,
Chief Executive Officer Andrew Sukawaty said.  “We are seeing a contraction in demand for voice services
due to e-mail substitution and other competition,” he said on a
conference call with reporters.  Full-year net income was $260.9 million, or 57 cents per
share, compared with $152.7 million, or 35 cents per share a
year earlier, Inmarsat said in the statement. Sales gained 13
percent to $1.17 billion, the company said.  Inmarsat said today it expects its “core” satellite
revenue to gain 2 percent to 4 percent this year. That compares
with 2010 gains of 6.5 percent, and with an Investec Securities
analyst’s 2011 estimate of 6.5 percent.  Analyst  Also, the analyst, Morten Singleton, wrote in a report that
he had been anticipating gains of $215 million from the
company’s North American spectrum-cooperation agreement with
LightSquared Inc., while Inmarsat forecast $187 million to $207
million for this year.  Dividends will probably grow at least 10 percent in 2011,
Inmarsat said. Inmarsat expects to pay 36.69 cents per share
total dividend for 2010, the company said.  Inmarsat is not gaining much extra business from unrest in
Egypt, Libya and  Tunisia  even as reporters transmit stories by
satellite, Sukawaty said.  “In Haiti, you had a complete wiping out of
infrastructure,” he said. “It had a much broader long-term
effect.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
