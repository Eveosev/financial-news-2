Insurance brokers are demanding
extra commissions for bringing business to the Lloyd’s of London
market, because pressure of competition is squeezing fees they
charge corporate clients, the Financial Times reported, citing
Robert Hiscox, the chairman of  Hiscox Ltd. (HSX) , a Lloyd’s insurer.  Hiscox said brokers don’t have enough self-confidence to
value their own advice and charge their clients proper fees,
pointing to a 3.5 percent brokerage charge levied by  AON Corp. (AON) 
on all contracts this year, the newspaper reported.  AON denied this is an extra charge, saying it replaces
three separate charges by a single, standard one that’s more
transparent, the FT reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
