Japanese stock futures and
Australian shares fell as escalating violence in Libya sent  oil
prices  higher, and chip-related shares dropped after  Wells Fargo
& Co . reduced its recommendation on the semiconductor industry.  American depositary receipts of Toyota Motor Corp., the
world’s largest carmaker, fell 0.9 percent from the closing
share price in Tokyo. Advantest Corp., the world’s No. 1 maker
of chip-testing equipment, sank 1.3 percent. Commonwealth Bank
of Australia, Australia’s biggest bank by market value,
retreated 0.7 percent in Sydney today.  “Everyone thinks oil prices are going to keep rising, and
that means the market is going to fall,” said  Fumiyuki Nakanishi , a strategist at Tokyo-based SMBC Friend Securities Co.
“The situation has entered an impasse.”  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average expiring in
March closed at 10,450 in  Chicago  yesterday, compared with
10,530 in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at
10,470 in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index dropped 0.2 percent today.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed today. The index slid 0.8 percent yesterday in  New York .  Oil climbed to a 29-month high in New York yesterday as
fighting between Libyan rebels and troops loyal to  Muammar Qaddafi  intensified, reigniting concern that supply disruptions
will spread through the Middle East. Crude oil for April
delivery increased $1.02 to $105.44 a barrel on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , the highest settlement since Sept. 26, 2008.  Chip Shares Fall  Semiconductor-related shares sank the most among 24 groups
in the S&P 500 yesterday after Wells Fargo cut its industry
rating to “market weight” from “overweight,” citing the 125
percent gain in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index over the
last two years. The downgrade “is more an indication of a more
moderate though still optimistic view of the sector rather than
any active concern about the chip stocks as a group.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.3 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 4.2 percent by the S&P
500 and 1.8 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Shares in the
Asian benchmark were valued at 13.9 times estimated earnings on
average as of the last close, compared with 13.6 times for the
S&P 500 and 11.2 times for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporter on this story:
