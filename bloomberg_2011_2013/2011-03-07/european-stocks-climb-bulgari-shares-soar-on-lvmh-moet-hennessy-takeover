2009, when the index reached its lowest level in more than 12
years.  “Generally positive economic reports have been

of Sirte.  Clashes during the past two days have become more deadly as
the rebels moved along the Libyan coast toward Tripoli and
government troops escalated their use of force in attempting to
retake the rebel-held cities of Misurata, about 90 miles east of
the capital, and Zawiyah to the west.  Stocks fluctuated in Europe today as Greece’s government
