The value of global mergers and
acquisitions in the power industry is likely to exceed $116
billion this year as utilities start breaking down regional
barriers, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP said in a report.  Chinese companies and bidders from Asia Pacific will
continue to emerge outside of their own regions, PwC said.
European businesses will seek to divest networks and weigh moves
to improve their presence, according to the report today.  “Because of various regulations, most utilities have been
regionally focused,” Kameswara Rao, executive director at PwC
India, said by telephone from the south Indian city of Hyderabad.
“The demand factors are so favorable that for the first time we
are seeing them looking beyond.”  Global transaction values in the power and gas utility
industry, excluding renewable energy, rose 19 percent to $116
billion in 2010, PwC said. Quarterly volumes have risen to about
$40 billion, compared with $30 billion to $50 billion in 2008.  “Power deals remain in the lowlands compared with the
heady mountains of deal value that were transacted in the 2005-
2008 period,” PwC said in the report. “But the conditions are
in place for a return at least toward the foothills of those
peaks.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
