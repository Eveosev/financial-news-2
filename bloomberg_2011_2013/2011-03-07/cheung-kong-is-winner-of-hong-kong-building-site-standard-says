  Cheung Kong Holdings Ltd. (1)  submitted
the winning  HK$2.41 billion ($309 million) tender for a
building site in  Hong Kong â€™s Yuen Long district, the Standard
said, citing Executive Director Grace Woo.    Cheung Kong  must build at least 960 apartments on the site,
800 of between 35 square meters (377 square feet) and 40 square
meters each, and the balance no larger than 60 square meters
each, the Hong Kong-based English-language newspaper said today.
The city government sold the land.    To contact the editor responsible for this story:
