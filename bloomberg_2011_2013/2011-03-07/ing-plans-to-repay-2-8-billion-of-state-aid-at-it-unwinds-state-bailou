  ING Groep NV (INGA) , the biggest Dutch
financial-services company, plans to repay 2 billion euros ($2.8
billion) of state aid in May at a 50 percent premium.  “ING will fund this repurchase from retained earnings,”
the Amsterdam-based bank and insurer said today. The company
plans to buy back the core tier 1 securities sold to the state
at the next coupon reset date on May 13, it said.  ING received 10 billion euros of state aid in 2008 and also
transferred the risk on 21.6 billion euros of U.S. mortgage
assets. The firm paid back 5 billion euros in December 2009 and
Chief Executive Officer Jan Hommen said Feb. 16 he’s “quite
hopeful that we can repay the Dutch state to a significant
amount this year.”  “The strong recovery of the banking business in 2010 has
enabled us to accelerate the repurchase of the core Tier 1
securities from retained earnings, while maintaining a robust
capital position post repayment,” Hommen said in the statement.  The intended buyback would reduce the core Tier 1 ratio by
90 basis points, or 0.9 percentage points, and the ratio is
expected to remain above 8.5 percent, ING said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
