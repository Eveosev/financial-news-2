Executives of  Eni SpA (ENI)  had a meeting
with Angola’s Sonangol EP in Luanda and backed the Angolan oil
company’s aim to have a direct stake in  Galp Energia SGPS SA (GALP) ,
Jornal de Negocios reported, without saying how it obtained the
information.  Eni Chief Executive Officer Paolo Scaroni led the group of
Eni executives and they met Sonangol Chairman Manuel Vicente,
the Portuguese newspaper said.     Sonangol presently has an indirect stake in Portuguese oil
company Galp through its holding in Amorim Energia, which
directly owns 33 percent of Galp. Eni, Italy’s biggest oil
company, holds another 33 percent of Galp.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
