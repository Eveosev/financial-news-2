  Thailand â€™s National Rice Policy
Committee approved an increase in benchmark domestic prices by
up to 10 percent for rice under an income guarantee program
after complaints by farmers about rising costs, Pramote
Vanichanont, a committee member, said today.  The increase in the benchmark price, which is subject to
final approval from the cabinet, will raise total  government
spending  on rice under the income guarantee program to 55
billion baht ($1.8 billion) from 40 billion baht planned earlier,
Pramote said. The government will pay the difference to farmers
if domestic prices are below the benchmark level.  To contact the reporters on this story:
