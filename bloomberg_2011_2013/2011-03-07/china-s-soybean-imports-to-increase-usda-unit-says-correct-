  China ’s soybean imports will rise
5.5 percent in the year starting Oct. 1 as an increase in
personal income boosts demand for vegetable oil and meat, a unit
of the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said.  Imports by China, the world’s leading consumer, will climb
to 58 million metric tons from an estimated 55 million a year
earlier, the agency’s Foreign Agricultural Service said in a
 report  posted today on its website. Last month, the USDA
projected shipments of 57 million in the 12 months ending Sept.
30. The oilseed is used in livestock feed and cooking oil.  Imports from the U.S., the biggest shipper, may increase 8
percent to 27 million tons, the service said. Imports of all
oilseeds were forecast to climb 5.6 percent to 59.9 million
tons.  China’s imports of  soybean oil  may rise 5.3 percent to 2
million. Total imports of cooking oil, including product from
soybeans, rapeseed and  palm oil , will increase 2.8 percent to
9.26 million, the service said. The USDA’s official forecast was
9.28 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
