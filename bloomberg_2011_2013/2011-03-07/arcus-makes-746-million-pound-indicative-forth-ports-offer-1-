  Forth Ports Plc (FPT) , the U.K.’s only
listed ports operator, received an indicative conditional offer
from Arcus’ Infrastructure Fund 1 LP, valuing the company at
almost 746 million pounds ($1.21 billion). The shares closed at
the highest since September 2008.  Arcus is offering 1,630 pence a share for the 77.2 percent
of the company it doesn’t already own, the Edinburgh-based
company, which operates  Scotland ’s biggest container dock and
six other U.K. ports, said in a Regulatory News Service
statement today. Shareholders would also receive a final
dividend of 20 pence a share.  The estimated value of the company is based on the number
of shares outstanding, according to Bloomberg data.  “On the basis of this indicative proposal, the board has
agreed that Arcus can undertake certain confirmatory due
diligence,” Forth said in the statement.  It’s the second time Arcus has tried to buy Forth Ports in
the past year. A group of investors involving Arcus, Peel
Holdings Ltd. and RREEF Infrastructure dropped an offer of 1,400
pence a share, saying they couldn’t justify a higher price in
the light of economic uncertainty and uncertainty about the
value of Forth Ports’ real estate assets.  Forth Ports shares rose 82 pence, or 5.4 percent, to 1,605
pence in London trading, extending the gain this year to 19
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
