PKO Bank Polski SA, Polandâ€™s biggest
bank, said fourth-quarter profit rose 68 percent as it earned
more from lending.  Net income surged to 867.7 million zloty ($304.3 million),
the highest quarterly profit in more than two years, from
516.4 million zloty a year earlier, the bank said in a statement
on its  website  today. That compares with the 851 million-zloty
average estimate of 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. PKO had a
record 3.22 billion zloty full-year profit.  Net interest income, the difference between what PKO
pays on deposits and charges for loans, increased 22 percent to
1.73 billion zloty in the quarter, while fees and commissions
advanced 15 percent to 818 million zloty. Provisions for bad
loans fell 23 percent to 426.4 million zloty as loans rose
13 percent to 120.5 billion zloty.  Net income may reach 4 billion zloty this year, Chief
Executive Officer Zbigniew Jagiello said in January. The Warsaw-
based bank plans to present a new strategy for 2012-2014 in the
second half and may revise its 2011 goals. Jagiello was
reappointed as CEO on March 2 for a three-year term.  PKO wants to pay about 40 percent of its unconsolidated net
income as a dividend in future, it said in a statement to the
Warsaw bourse today.  The bank cut its cost-to-income ratio by 6.2 percentage
points to 42 percent and improved its interest margin by
0.5 percentage points to 4.4 percent, it said.  PKO shares rose 0.5 percent to 43.7 zloty as of 9:06 a.m.
in Warsaw, valuing the company at 54.6 billion zloty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
