  James River Coal Co. (JRCC) , an owner of
mines in Appalachia and the Illinois Basin, is buying
International Resource Partners LP for $475 million to boost
coal output and shipping.  James River, based in Richmond,  Virginia , is buying a
company with mines that produced 1.9 million tons of coal last
year, it said in a PR Newswire statement. Most of that was so-
called metallurgical coal.  The purchase includes Logan & Kanawha Coal Co., a coal
marketing and trading business that helped boost International
Resource’s total of coal shipped to 3.7 million tons.
International Resource had 2010 consolidated revenue of $490.3
million.  James River secured $375 million in financing from Deutsche
Bank AG and UBS AG for the deal.  International Resource was owned by Kayne Anderson Energy
Development Co., Lightfoot Capital Partners, Tortoise Capital
Resources Corp. and a firm controlled by its chairman, James Harless.  Shares of James River fell 2 cents to $20.25 on March 4.
They’ve dropped 20 percent this year after a 37 percent gain in
2010.  Deutsche Bank was James River’s financial adviser and UBS
advised International Resource.  (James River will hold a conference call March 7 at 9 a.m.
