U.S. stocks erased gains, with
technology and consumer-discretionary companies leading declines
in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, as oil resumed its advance
above $105 a barrel.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped less than 0.2
percent to 1,318.63 at 10:42 a.m. in  New York  after climbing 0.5
percent earlier as crude retreated from its high of the day of
almost $107. Oil for April delivery recently was up 1.2 percent
to $105.67.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
