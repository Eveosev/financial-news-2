Bahraini inflation eased to its
slowest pace in more than two years as housing and utility costs
decreased.  The inflation rate fell to 0.9 percent in January from 1
percent in the previous month, according to the Central
Informatics Organization’s website. The organization on Feb. 21
had reported that inflation eased to 0.6 percent.  Housing and utility costs decreased 1.5 percent while food
and beverage costs rose 0.5 percent compared with 3.1 percent
the previous month.  Tens of thousands of Bahrainis, inspired by protests that
have toppled the rulers of Tunisia and  Egypt , have been
demonstrating since last month, calling for increased democracy
and job opportunities. Bahrain’s benchmark index has declined
2.5 percent this year on the unrest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
