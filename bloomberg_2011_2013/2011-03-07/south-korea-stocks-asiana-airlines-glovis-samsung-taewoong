Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in South Korea trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are at the 3 p.m. close in Seoul.  The  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  fell 24.41, or 1.2 percent, to 1,980.27.  Airlines:  Korean Air  Lines Co. (003490 KS) fell 3.1 percent
to 61,600 won.  Asiana Airlines (020560)  Inc. (020560 KS) tumbled 6.1
percent to 9,860 won. The shares fell after oil rose to the
highest in 29 months in  New York  and after Incheon International
Airport Corp. said February cargo traffic dropped 5.1 percent.
Fuel accounts for more than 30 percent of operating costs for
Korean Air, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Glovis Co. (086280 KS), a logistics unit of Hyundai Motor
Group, jumped 7.4 percent to 146,000 won, the most since Aug. 23.
KB Investment & Securities Co. rated the shares “buy” in new
coverage, saying in a report today operating profit may rise 33
percent this year.  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930 KS),  Asia ’s biggest maker
of chips, flat screens and mobile phones, fell 4.1 percent to
906,000 won, the most since Nov. 27, 2009. “There’s market
speculation that the company’s first-quarter earnings will be
smaller than expected, largely driven by weak display
business,” said Kim Young Chan, an analyst with Shinhan
Investment Corp. Jason Kim, a spokesman for Samsung, declined to
comment.  Taewoong Co. (044490 KS), a maker of parts for wind power
plants, added 2.6 percent to 47,900 won, after rising as much as
5.6 percent earlier. China tightened rules for its wind-power
equipment industry to prevent new entrants from making turbines.
“The measures in China would help ease oversupply conditions
there, and Taewoong, as a major parts supplier in  China , will
benefit,” Han Byung Hwa, an analyst at Hyundai Securities Co.,
said in a note today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
