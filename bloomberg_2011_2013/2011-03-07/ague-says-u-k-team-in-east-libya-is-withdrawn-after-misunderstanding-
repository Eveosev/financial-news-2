U.K. Foreign Secretary  William Hague 
said he last week authorized the dispatch of “a small British
diplomatic team” to eastern Libya, with the goal of contacting
rebel groups, protected by soldiers.  “They were withdrawn yesterday after a serious
misunderstanding about their role which led to their
detention,” Hague told Parliament in  London  today.  The Sunday Times newspaper reported yesterday that Special
Air Service soldiers had been among those held, something on
which the Ministry of Defense has refused to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
