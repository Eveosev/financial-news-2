U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  is satisfied that the Independent Commission on
Banking’s expected recommendations on the reorganization of
retail and investment banking are “going in the right
direction,” the Financial Times reported, citing an
unidentified Treasury official.  The Commission, which is studying whether to oblige banks
to split into separate retail and investment banking companies
or make them capitalize the businesses separately, may opt for
the latter solution, the FT said, without attribution.  To contact the reporter on this story:
