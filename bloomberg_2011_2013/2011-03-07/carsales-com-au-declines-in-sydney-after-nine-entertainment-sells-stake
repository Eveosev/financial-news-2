  Carsales.com.au Ltd. (CRZ) ,  Australia ’s
most popular automotive website, fell the most in four months in
Sydney trading after Nine Entertainment Co. sold its 49 percent
stake at a discount to raise A$566 million ($574 million).  Carsales.com.au fell 4.6 percent to A$5 at the 4:10 p.m.
close of Sydney trading, the biggest decline since Oct. 19. Nine
Entertainment, controlled by buyout firm CVC Asia Pacific, said
today it sold its shares to institutions at A$4.92 apiece, a 6.1
percent discount to the March 4 closing price.  Nine, which owns Australia’s second-most watched television
network, sold its stake after a 50 percent jump in
Carsales.com.au’s share price since the website sold stock to
the public at A$3.50 apiece in a September 2009 initial public
offering that raised A$164 million.  Carsales.com.au currently trades at 21 times estimated
earnings, compared with a multiple of 13.7 times profit for the
benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index.  The automotive website was founded in 1997 by Australian
car dealers as a marketplace for new and used vehicles. The
company has since expanded into websites for farm machinery,
property, boats and recreational vehicles.  Nine Entertainment’s share sale was underwritten by UBS AG.  To contact the reporter on this story:
