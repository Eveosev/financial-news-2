The Sofia Military Court acquitted
former Bulgarian Defense Minister Nikolai Tsonev today of
mismanaging public funds.  Prosecutors had said that Tsonev caused damages worth
970,000 lev ($694,000) by making four unprofitable deals when he
was head of procurement at the ministry in 1999, Tsonev told
reporters in Sofia. Prosecutors, who demanded a five-year jail
sentence, said they will appeal the ruling.  Tsonev is still awaiting trial on bribery charges, he said.  Prime Minister  Boiko Borissov  came to power 20 months ago
pledging to curb corruption and organized crime. The  European
Union  has repeatedly criticized Bulgaria for failing to convict
corrupt senior government officials except for minor cases
involving mayors and police officers. Bulgaria ranks as the most
corrupt in the EU after  Greece , according to Berlin-based
research organization  Transparency International .  Bulgaria, along with neighboring Romania, is seeking to
join the EU’s passport-free Schengen zone. EU members, including
Germany and  France , have recommended linking the country’s
accession to reducing crime and corruption.  To contact the reporters on this story:
