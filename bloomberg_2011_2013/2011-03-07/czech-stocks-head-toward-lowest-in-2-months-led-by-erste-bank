The Czech Republic’s benchmark stock
index retreated for a second day, heading for a two-month low,
led by lenders  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  and  Komercni Banka AS. (KOMB)   The PX gauge of 15 companies, where Erste and Komercni have
a combined 43 percent weighting, slid 1 percent to 1,220.6 as of
9:37 a.m. in Prague. A close at that level would be its lowest
since Jan. 10.  Austria’s Erste tumbled 2.1 percent to 870.5 koruna, its
third day of declines. Komercni, the Czech unit of Societe
Generale SA, dropped 1.5 percent to 4,215 koruna, heading for
its biggest loss since Feb. 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
