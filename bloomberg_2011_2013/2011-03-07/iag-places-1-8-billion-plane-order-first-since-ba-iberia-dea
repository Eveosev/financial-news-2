International Consolidated Airlines
Group SA agreed to buy eight Airbus SAS A330 aircraft worth $1.8
billion at list price, the first plane order since its formation
from a merger of British Airways and  Spain ’s Iberia in January.  The twin-engine widebodies will be delivered from 2012
through 2014 for use by Madrid-based Iberia, IAG said today in a
statement. The company also has options to buy eight more of the
planes as its Spanish unit replaces 16 four-engine Airbus A340s.  “The new aircraft will be more cost effective to operate,”
London-based IAG said, adding that Iberia currently operates 18
A340-300s and 17 A340-600s. “They can be easily assimilated
into Iberia’s existing long-haul fleet, reducing the need for
additional crew training and maintenance costs.”  Airbus said last month it would boost A330 output starting
in early 2012 to satisfy “unprecedented” demand for the
aircraft. Carriers are seeking more fuel-efficient planes as
violence in  Libya  pushes up  oil prices  and the European Union
prepares to impose limits on carbon dioxide emissions next year.  Sales of the A330 have also gained as  Boeing Co. (BA)  struggles
to deliver the competing 787 Dreamliner after production delays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
