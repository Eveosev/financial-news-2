Airlines will be the second-largest
sector in the European Union’s emissions-trading system, after
power generators, when aviation joins next year with a carbon-
dioxide limit of 213 million metric tons.  The industry-wide cap on airlines aimed at fighting global
warming will fall to 208.5 million tons of CO2 a year in 2013
under the decision today by the European Commission, the EU’s
regulatory arm in Brussels. The inclusion of aviation in the
cap-and-trade system may push up fares.    Europe ’s emissions-trading program, the world’s biggest
greenhouse-gas market covering more than 11,000 power plants and
factories, requires companies that exceed their CO2 quotas to
buy spare permits from businesses that emit less or pay a fine.
The wider curbs will apply to carriers ranging from Air France-
KLM Group and  Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA)  to  AMR Corp. (AMR) ’s American
Airlines and  Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SIA)   “Firm action is needed,” Climate Commissioner Connie Hedegaard said in a statement. “Emissions from aviation are
growing faster than from any other sector, and all forecasts
indicate they will continue to do so under business as usual
conditions.”  Roundtrip air fares within Europe may rise between 1.80
euros ($2.52) and 9 euros as a result of the new restrictions,
the  commission  said today. A roundtrip flight from Brussels to  New York  at current carbon prices of around 15 euros could cost
an additional 12 euros, it estimated.  Billions of Euros  The industry has countered that the rules, adopted in 2008,
would reduce profit by billions of euros because operators would
have difficulty passing on the costs to travelers. Airlines will
add 32 million tons of demand for EU carbon allowances in 2012,
Bloomberg New Energy Finance said today. That would be valued at
508 million euros at today’s prices.  EU permits for delivery in December rose 0.7 percent to
15.93 euros as of 14:21 p.m. in  London  and were 12 percent up
this year. The EU emissions trading system is known as the ETS.  “Fact is that EU ETS means additional costs for Lufthansa
up to 350 million euro a year,” said  Peter Schneckenleitner , a
spokesman for Cologne-based Lufthansa, Europe’s second-biggest
carrier. “We still see the EU ETS very critically, a lot of
legal prerequisites are still open. For us the ETS means a huge
distortion of competition; especially non-EU airlines will
benefit from it.”  The caps are based on a commission estimate that the
European and foreign carriers to be covered by the trading
program emitted a total of 219.5 million tons of CO2 a year on
average in 2004-2006 during flights to and from EU airports.  Emissions-Trading System  Under the EU law extending the system to airlines in 2012,
the annual limit will begin at 97 percent of 2004-2006 emissions
and fall to 95 percent of those “historical” discharges
starting in 2013. Airlines account for about 2 percent of global
CO2 discharges.  “The inclusion of airlines into the emissions trading-
system was necessary,” said Sanjeev Kumar, an associate at
climate-protection group E3G in Brussels. The cap for 2012 was
still “too generous,” he said.  The EU decided in 2008 that internal and external flights
to and from the bloc’s airports should be added to the
emissions-trading system as of 2012 after airline discharges in
Europe doubled over two decades. Under the  legislation , 82
percent of the emission allowances making up the airline-
industry cap will be allocated for free and 15 percent will be
auctioned. The remaining 3 percent will be put into a special
reserve for later distribution to fast growing airlines and new
entrants to the system.  Benchmarking Year  Permits for this decade will be handed out based on the
efficiency of carriers in 2010, a year when fuel prices surged
and Icelandic volcano ash, freezing weather and labor strikes
disrupted travel. The EU said it has no plans to change the
benchmarking year, a step that would require amending the law.  “We have not seen data to suggest that the impact of the  ash cloud  will have a material impact on the distribution of
free allowances,” the commission said.  The EU will by Sept. 30 decide on the number of allowances
to be auctioned, to be distributed for free and to be allocated
to the special reserve. Member states should use the revenues
from the auctions of permits to tackle  climate change .  The permits that make up the airline caps will be on top of
a supply already fixed through 2020 for energy and manufacturing
companies. The EU cap-and-trade system started in 2005 with a
three-year trading period, is now in a second phase that ends in
2012 and will enter a third stage from 2013 through 2020.  The inclusion of aviation into the ETS will save 183
million tons of carbon dioxide per year by 2020, a 46 percent
reduction compared with business as usual, the commission said.  Carbon Program  “Some of these reductions are likely to be made by
airlines themselves,” it said. “Participation in the EU system
will also give them other options: buying additional allowances
on the market or investing in emissions-saving projects”
carried out under the United Nations carbon program.  The annual overall cap for installations currently in the
system is due to fall by about 11 percent on average in 2013-
2020 from 2008-2012. In 2008, the commission said the annual
average cap for those polluters would decline to 1.85 billion
tons in 2013-2020 from 2.08 billion tons in 2008-2012.  Last October, the EU raised the cap in 2013 for  power
plants  and factories by 6 percent to 2.04 billion tons to take
account of the entry of aluminum and chemical makers into the
trading system that year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
