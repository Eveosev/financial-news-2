Palabora Mining Company Ltd., a
copper producer, dropped the most in a week as the metal 
declined for a second day.  The shares in dropped as much as 5.9 percent, before
trading 3.1 percent lower at 129.80 rand at 10 a.m. in

escalating conflict in  Libya  will further boost energy prices,
weighing on growth and eroding metals demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
