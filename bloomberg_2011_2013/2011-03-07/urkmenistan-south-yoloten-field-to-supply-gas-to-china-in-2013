Turkmenistan, the holder of the
world’s fourth-largest natural gas reserves, will start pumping
first gas from its South Yoloten field to  China  in late 2013,
said  Petrofac Ltd. (PFC) , the contractor.  Petrofac, an oilfield services and engineering provider, is
working on the $3.4 billion second phase of the South Yoloten
field development. The project will take about 32 months to
reach 10 billion cubic meters a year of pumping capacity, which
later can be doubled, the company said today in a statement.  “The Chinese are building the pipeline,” Chief Executive
Officer Ayman Asfari said today in an interview. The development
can be the “trigger and the driver for development of
additional gas prospects” in the eastern part of the country.  China is turning to Turkmenistan for more gas as Russia’s
OAO Gazprom, the world’s biggest producer, has yet to agree on
prices and pipeline routes with  Asia ’s fastest-growing market.  Turkmenistan  plans to extract as much as 30 billion cubic meters
of natural gas a year from the South Yoloten area, according to
the Turkmen government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
