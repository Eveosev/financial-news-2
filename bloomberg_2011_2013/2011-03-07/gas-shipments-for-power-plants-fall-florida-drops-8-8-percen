Natural gas shipments scheduled for
delivery to U.S. power plants dropped for the fourth time in
five days as cooler weather in  Florida  reduced demand for gas-
generated electricity for air-conditioning.  Scheduled shipments for U.S. electricity generation dropped
5.9 percent to 10.7 million dekatherms (10.4 billion cubic
feet), according to data compiled by Bloomberg as of 2:10 p.m.
in New York.  Gas delivery to Florida for power-plant use, which accounts
for about 20 percent of total U.S. power-plant demand, declined
8.8 percent to 2.20 million dekatherms, Bloomberg data show.  The high temperature in Jacksonville, Florida, may be 65
degrees Fahrenheit (18 Celsius) today, 7 degrees below normal,
according to AccuWeather Inc. in  State College , Pennsylvania.
The high yesterday was 78.  Natural gas supports about 40 percent of Floridaâ€™s power
generation and coal accounts for 30 percent, according to  the
Energy Department .  Wholesale gas for next-day delivery at the Florida Gas
Transmission Zone 3 rose 1.7 percent to $3.7702 per million
British thermal units. It declined to $3.7059 on March 4, the
lowest level since Nov. 15.  Gas for next-day delivery at the  Henry Hub  in Erath,
Louisiana, gained 0.7 percent to $3.7295. The hub is the
benchmark for gas futures traded on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  To contact the reporter on this story:
