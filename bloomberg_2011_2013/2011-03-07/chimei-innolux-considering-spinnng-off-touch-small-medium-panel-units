  Chimei Innolux Corp. (3481) ,  Taiwan ’s
largest maker of liquid-crystal displays, is still considering
spinning off its touch-panel or small- and medium-sized panel
businesses, spokesman Eddie Chen said today.  It’s still “a bit premature” to discuss the likelihood or
 timing of any spinoff for either unit, Chen said. Chimei
Innolux plans to separate its touch, and small- and
medium-panel business while also hiring 3,000 workers, the
Economic Daily reported today, without saying where it go the
information. Chimei Innolux, based in Miaoli, Taiwan, plans to
recruit a “couple of thousand” workers this year, Chen said
without providing a specific figure.  To contact the reporter on this story:
