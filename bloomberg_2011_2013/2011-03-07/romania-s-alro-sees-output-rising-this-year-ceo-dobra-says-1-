Romanian aluminum producer  Alro SA (ALR) ,
majority owned by  Vimetco NV (VICO) , forecast an increase in production
this year as demand picks up, Chief Executive Officer Gheorghe Dobra said today, without giving specific figures.  Alro can increase aluminum output by as much as 20 percent
in “a few months” if it secures long-term  energy supply , Dobra
told reporters in Bucharest. Alro may start construction as
early as next year on a gas-fired power plant with a capacity of
420 megawatts in the eastern county of Tulcea, Dobra said.  Vimetco, the aluminum company controlled by Russia’s
Vitaliy Machitski, expects global aluminum production to rise as
much as 30 percent to 55 million metric tons by 2015, Chief
Executive Officer Frank Mueller said in October. Alro’s output
dropped 17 percent last year to 240,000 tons from a 2008 peak of
288,000 tons, according to Dobra.  “The aluminum orders have started to increase but the
prices remain under pressure,” Dobra said. “We expect higher
orders from companies in the automotive sector and construction.
We can grow our output by as much as 20 percent if we can find
the needed energy.”  The power plant project is at an “advanced stage,” Dobra
said. “The cost of building a megawatt varies between $1
million and $2 million. We are working on the task book for
selecting the equipment suppliers.”  Last month, Alro posted a 71 percent increase in 2010 net
income to 160 million lei ($53 million) from 93.6 million lei a
year earlier. Sales rose to 1.8 billion lei from 1.4 billion
lei. The company said it plans to increase investment this year
from $8.8 million in 2010.  Vimetco said on Feb. 15 it’s considering transferring the
holding company of its bauxite business in  Sierra Leone , Global
Aluminium Limited., to its Romanian alumina producer, Alum SA.
The proposal will be submitted on March 21 to Alum shareholders.  “The transfer of our management to the Sierra Leone unit
has already been done, we still need to transfer the equity,”
Dobra said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
