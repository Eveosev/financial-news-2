Poland’s benchmark stock index
headed for the highest close in almost three years as PKO Bank
Polski SA, the country’s largest bank, reported earnings that
beat analysts’ estimates and refiners rose on higher  oil prices .  The WIG20 Index climbed 1.2 percent to 2,815.35 at 12:47
p.m. in Warsaw, poised to close at the highest level since June
2008. The measure rose for a fourth consecutive session,
extending this year’s advance to 2.8 percent.  PKO increased 1.6 percent to 44.2 zloty after the state-
controlled lender said fourth-quarter net income jumped to 867.7
million zloty ($304 million), exceeding the 851 million-zloty
average estimate of 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  PKO reported “a positive set of results showing resilience
of margins in the face of increasing competition on the loan
market and good cost control,” Maciej Baranski, a Warsaw-based
analyst at Bank Zachodni WBK SA’s brokerage, wrote in a note.    Bank Pekao SA (PEO) , Poland’s second-largest lender, increased
2.2 percent to 174.7 zloty. The UniCredit SpA unit is scheduled
to report 2010 results before the market opens on March 9.  PKN Orlen SA, Poland’s biggest oil company, gained 1.7
percent to 50.45 zloty and  Grupa Lotos SA (LTS) , the second-largest
refiner, advanced 1.7 percent to 42.9 zloty. Oil rose to the
highest level in 29 months in  New York  as escalating violence in
Libya renewed concern that supply disruptions may spread through
the Middle East.  Separately, Orlen, copper producer  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  and
other owners of Polkomtel SA, Poland’s second-largest mobile-
phone operator, shortlisted seven bidders for further talks to
buy the company,  Gazeta Wyborcza  reported on March 5.  KGHM and Orlen each have 24.4 percent stakes in Polkomtel.
KGHM shares climbed 1.9 percent to 185.4 zloty today. A close at
that level would be the highest in six weeks.    Telekomunikacja Polska SA (TPS)  rallied for a second day, adding
2 percent to 17.02 zloty. Poland’s largest phone company this
week may choose a buyer for TP Emitel Sp. z o.o., its operator
of television and radio towers, Rzeczpospolita reported, citing
a person close to the deal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
