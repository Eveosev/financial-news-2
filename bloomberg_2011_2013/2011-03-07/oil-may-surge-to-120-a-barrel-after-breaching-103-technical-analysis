Oil is poised to test prices above
$120 a barrel for the first time since September 2008 after
breaching a target near $103 a barrel, according to  technical
analysis  from Citi FX.  Oil faces resistance above $120 a barrel, the 76.4 percent
retracement level on a linear-chart Fibonacci study of oil’s
2008 collapse, said  Tom Fitzpatrick , chief technical analyst at
Citi FX, part of Citigroup Capital Markets in  New York . Crude
fell from a record $147.27 in July 2008 to $32.40 that December.  Crude oil for April delivery rose $2.51, or 2.5 percent, on
March 4 to $104.42 a barrel, surging past resistance at about
$103.25, the 76.4 percent retracement level in a log-chart
Fibonacci study of the 2008 collapse. The settlement price was
the highest since Sept. 26, 2008. Prices gained 6.7 percent last
week and have advanced 30 percent in the past year.  “If there are big differences between a log and a linear
chart on a target, we take the more conservative approach, but
if that gets breached, we look at the more aggressive one, which
is just over $120,” Fitzpatrick said in an interview. “Between
here and $120, there wasn’t a single level. We went up in a
straight line in 2008.”  If oil fails to sustain the move higher, it has support
between $90.50 and $93 a barrel, levels crude tested twice
before breaking through them in the most recent rally, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
