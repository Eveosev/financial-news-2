  Fitch Ratings  has affirmed a CC
rating for Petrol AD, Bulgaria’s biggest fuel distributor, and
taken the company off “rating watch negative’ on improved  cash
flow  in 2010 and better cost-cutting.  Fitch placed Petrol and a 100 million-euro bond due in
October 2011 on negative watch on July 28, 2010, reflecting
concern over the company’s ability to repay its debt, the rating
company said in a statement today. Fitch placed the bond on a
Recovery Rating R4, it said.  ‘‘The ratings reflect the company’s high refinancing
risk,” Fitch said.  Petrol plans to redeem the bonds by either raising new bank
funding or through a sale and lease-back transaction in the next
few months, according to Fitch.  To contact the reporter on this story:
