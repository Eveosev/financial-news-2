To all foot soldiers in the equal-opportunity-diversity-and-inclusion revolution: It's time to vote with your feet. Celebrate  International Women's Day  on March 8 by sitting down and slipping your shoes off for a moment of relief.  The ancient Chinese practice of  foot-binding  was imposed on women. The modern fashion practice of wearing toe-squeezing high-heeled shoes has a voluntary component. Far be it for me to blame the victim, because I, too, fall in line at the fashion parade. Briefcases and large designer bags carried by women executives often hide a clunky secret — running shoes that they can change into at the first opportunity. It's not just that high heels can get uncomfortable. They also make it harder to keep a fast pace or keep up with flat-shoed male colleagues. They get caught in subway grates or sidewalk cracks and between bricks in historic districts. If that happens, women are singled out for attention that has nothing to do with their competence or tasks at hand, and is a distraction from business. I captured some of these difference effects in a cartoon called  A Tale of "O,"  about what happens when there are very few O's in a group of mostly X's, operating with X's as the mainstream standard; O's get stared at for the wrong reasons and find their effectiveness undermined.   Perhaps women are so conscious of shoes because they hurt so much. I recall the night that I toured a museum after a corporate conference dinner there and came upon two of the company's top female executives tottering along in very high heels. They noticed my flat sandals, which I had donned because I knew there would a lot of walking, and expressed envy. The chat was entirely about the search for comfortable dress shoes. Why is it that America and China can put astronauts in space, but they can't engineer comfortable women's dress shoes? I'm a small investor in a startup company deploying a podiatrist-patented method for adding comfort to high-fashion, high-heel shoes for women. The company is limping along, so to speak, for a variety of predictable business reasons. But the concept is captivating. I envision campaigns featuring marathons of business-suited-high-heel-wearing women dashing up the steps of Congress or running through airports.  Meanwhile, the shoes make it possible to emerge at the end of a work day in spiky high heels without sore backs and pinched toes. Women have always been caught in various cultural contradictions of capitalism, to use a term  from sociologist Daniel Bell  (whose recent loss is sorely felt). On the one hand (or foot), there is renewed interest worldwide in closing the gender gap, with efforts ranging from quotas to increase the number of women in German companies, Norwegian boardrooms, and the Rwanda parliament to America's  first state-of-women report in 50 years . On the other hand, fashion designers are competing to elevate heel heights to four, five, and even six inches off the ground, which resembles stilt-walking in a circus — hardly an aid to women's advancement in business.   If the developed world has moved beyond the notion of keeping women barefoot-and-pregnant, why are women leaders expected to use their talents with instruments of torture on their feet? An enlightened U.S. company with a large Somali immigrant work force installed footbaths in men's rest rooms so that male Muslims can prepare for prayers. Why doesn't  it occur to that company to put footbaths in women's rest rooms so that female managers who must dress up can soak their tired feet and rejuvenate? Religious tolerance has been around a lot longer than courtesies for working women such as rooms for nursing mothers. It might take years to recognize subtle things that would increase women's comfort — and thus their ability to focus on the work and excel at it. So, if you shoe up for International Women's Day celebrations, please put heart and sole into encouraging new thinking outside the (shoe)box. That will add to other efforts to make leadership positions a good fit for women.
