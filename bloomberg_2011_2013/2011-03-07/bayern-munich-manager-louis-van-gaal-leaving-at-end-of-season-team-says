FC  Bayern Munich  has reached an
agreement with head coach Louis van Gaal that he will step down
at the end of June, the German  soccer club  said in a statement
on its website.  The decision followed talks with club officials today and

in a “difficult sporting situation.”  Van Gaal’s contract had been scheduled to expire on June
30, 2012, the statement said.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
