  Poland ’s WIG20 Index climbed 30.41,

for a fourth day and heading for the highest close since June
2008.  The following are among the most active stocks on the  Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  PKO Bank Polski SA (PKO PW), Poland’s biggest bank, gained
for a fourth day, adding 0.71 zloty, or 1.6 percent, to 44.2
zloty. Fourth-quarter net income jumped to 867.7 million zloty
($304 million), the highest quarterly profit in more than two
