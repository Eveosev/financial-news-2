Porsche SE, the holding company that
owns 51 percent of  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s common shares, recorded a
profit in its shortened 2010 business year on gains from VW and
profit from the Porsche sports-car business.  Net income for the August to December period was 1.3
billion euros ($1.8 billion), the Stuttgart, Germany-based
company said in an e-mailed statement today. The profit was the
result of 969 million euros in earnings from Wolfsburg, Germany-
based VW and 106 million euros from the Porsche AG carmaking
operations.  Porsche SE, which not provide a five-month comparison
figure, had a loss of 454 million euros for the 12 months ended
July 2010. The results released today didn’t include any revenue
or profit figures for the carmaking business.  Porsche and VW agreed to combine in August 2009 following a
failed attempt by the sports-car maker to acquire its larger
rival. The merger may be delayed until next year because of
German investigations into allegations of share-price
manipulation. The probability that the merger will be completed
in the planned timeframe has declined to 50 percent from 70
percent, Porsche said today.  Porsche’s preferred shares gained 28 cents, 0.5 percent, to
close at 55.98 euros in  Frankfurt , valuing the company at 9.8
billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
