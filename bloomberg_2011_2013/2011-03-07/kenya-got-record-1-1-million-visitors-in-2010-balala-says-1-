Overseas tourist arrivals to  Kenya 
increased by 15 percent to a record 1.1 million last year as the
global economy emerged from crisis, Tourism Minister Najib Balala said.  Tourism earnings jumped 18 percent to 73.7 billion
shillings ($888.7 million), missing the government’s projection
of 100 billion shillings, Balala told reporters in Kenya’s
capital Nairobi today, without providing an explanation.  Last year “became the best year in Kenya’s tourism in
relation to international arrivals by air and sea,” according
to a statement handed to reporters today in Nairobi. Tourist
arrivals from abroad beat a record set in 2007 when 1.05 million
foreigners from overseas visited Kenya, the statement said.  An additional 700,000 foreign guests travelled by land to
Kenya across the Ugandan and Tanzanian borders, of which 200,000
came for leisure and the rest to do business, Balala said.  Violence that killed 1,500 people in Kenya following a
disputed presidential election in December 2007 scared away
would-be visitors and dented investment, hurting an industry
which accounts for 11 percent of the economy.  The state-run  Kenya Tourist Board  is stepping up its
promotional campaign to repair the country’s image abroad in a
bid to bring back holidaymakers to its wild-game parks and
beaches. The focus is expanding to include new markets such as  Russia , the Middle East and  India , Balala. The top source
nations in 2010 were the U.K., U.S.,  Italy ,  Germany  and  France .  “We have to invest more resources in new markets,” Balala
said. “Let’s not be sentimental about traditional markets.”  Kenya’s cruise-ship arrivals plummeted to 558 in 2010, from
12,096 a year earlier, due to cancellations over concerns about
piracy off Africa’s Indian Ocean coast, Balala said.  The East Africa nation’s goal is to attract 2 million
tourists next year and 3 million in 2015, Balala said Oct. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
