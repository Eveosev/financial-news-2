Rising food prices may result in
greater acceptance of genetically modified seed in emerging
markets, the Financial Times reported, citing leading seed
companies.  Daniel Rahier, who heads biotechnology policy at DuPont
Co., said there’s been a change of mood in countries such as
Indonesia, where the government is encouraging companies to
apply for approval of biotech seeds, and “it’s a similar story
in Vietnam, Cambodia and Kenya,” the newspaper reported.  Stefan Marcinowski, in charge of plant science and crop
protection at Germany’s  BASF SE (BAS) , told the FT rising food prices
are “a wake-up call to use all available technologies.”  Hugh Grant,  Monsanto Co. (MON) ’s chief executive officer, said
many agricultural areas of the world “have made significant
policy shifts” in the past two years, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
