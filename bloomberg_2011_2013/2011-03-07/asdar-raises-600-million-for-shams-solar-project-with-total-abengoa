Masdar, the Abu Dhabi-backed
renewable energy company, and its European partners  Total SA (FP)  and  Abengoa SA (ABG)  raised $600 million in financing for the Shams 1
concentrated solar thermal plant.  Shams Power Co. received a 22-year loan from 10 lenders
including  BNP Paribas (BNP) , which is also the financial adviser, and  National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC (NBAD) , according to an e-mailed
statement today.    Abu Dhabi , the capital of the United Arab Emirates and
holder of almost all of the countryâ€™s oil reserves, is expanding
its use of solar and wind power in an effort to become a
regional hub for renewable energy. The emirate is building
Masdar City, a business and residential complex designed to emit
minimal carbon emissions, and serves as headquarters for the
International Renewable Energy Agency.  Shams 1 will be one of the largest concentrated solar power
plants in the world, extending over an area of 2.5 square
kilometers with a capacity of 100 megawatts. Concentrated solar
reflects sunlight, usually with mirrors, to heat liquids that
generate power with steam turbines. Photovoltaic plants use
solar panels that convert sulight directly to electricity.  Shams Power, which will build, operate and maintain Shams
1, is 60 percent owned by Masdar. Total and Abengoa hold 20
percent each. Construction began in the third quarter of 2010
and will be completed in two years, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
