  Immofinanz AG (IIA) , central  Europe ’s
biggest property group, bought back 465.2 million euros ($650
million) worth of convertible bonds, using proceeds of a March 3
securities sale.  Immofinanz bought back 454.7 million euros of its
outstanding convertible bond due Jan. 2014 at 99.75 percent of
face value, and 10.5 million euros of its convertible due Nov.
2017 at 106 percent of face value, the Vienna-based group said
in a statement yesterday.  Immofinanz last week sold a new convertible due March 2018
for 515 million euros in a deal earmarked to fund the buyback.
It lined up the refinancing for the bonds it bought back because
holders can demand early redemption next year.  The 2014 and the 2017 convertibles have strike prices of
14.68 euros and 9.26 euros, respectively. That makes it likely
that holders will demand early redemption when they get the
option next year. A third outstanding bond that matures next
year has a strike price of 2 euros. Immofinanz closed at 3.12
euros today.  The 2014 bonds each had accrued interest of 361.64 euros,
while the 2017 securities had accrued interest of 373.29 euros
per bond, according to yesterday’s statement. The buybacks
reduce the outstanding principal of the two bonds to 307.8
million euros, according to Bloomberg calculations. Immofinanz
limited the buyback to the amount raised in the new issue when
it announced the tender on Feb. 14.  Dividend Resumption  The refinancing completes Immofinanz’ restructuring
following a cash squeeze that started after Lehman Brothers
collapsed and paves the way for Chief Executive Officer Eduard Zehetner to resume dividend payments. Zehetner has merged
eastern European unit Immoeast AG, put expansion plans on hold,
settled disputes with former affiliates and sold assets to
restore cash reserves.  Zehetner said Feb. 15 that the dividend for fiscal 2011,
which ends April 30, would be 0.1 euros should the convertible
sale and buybacks succeed. Immofinanz last paid a dividend for
the 2007 fiscal year.  After Immofinanz reached a settlement in May and as
Zehetner’s measures helped the company return to profit,
Immofinanz resurfaced on investors’ radar screens. Since June at
least 10 brokers, including HSBC, Morgan Stanley and Deutsche
Bank, initiated or restarted coverage of the developer,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Immofinanz was the second-best performer in the 21-member
Stoxx 600 Real Estate Index in the past 12 months. Even after
the outperformance, it still has the index’s lowest price-to-
book ratio and the second-lowest estimated price-to-earnings
ratio, according to data and estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The bonds Immofinanz bought back also reached their lowest
point on Nov. 13, 2008, when both traded at 6.6 percent of face
value at the height of a liquidity crisis. Owners who bought the
2017 bonds at the bottom and sold in the buyback have earned 16
times their investment in two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
