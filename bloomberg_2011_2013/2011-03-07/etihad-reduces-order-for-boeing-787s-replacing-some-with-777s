Etihad Airways, the Middle East’s
fourth-largest carrier, canceled an order for four of  Boeing
Co. (BA) ’s 787 Dreamliner aircraft in a step to safeguard its
expansion plans with the plane running years late.  Etihad will instead take three wide-body Boeing 777-model
planes in 2013 while scaling back the 35 Dreamliners it had on
order by four, a spokesman for the Abu Dhabi-based airline,
commenting on condition of anonymity in line with the carrier’s
policy, said in an e-mailed response to questions.  Etihad is increasing flights and has about 100 planes on
order from Boeing and Airbus SAS. The carrier’s 787s are
scheduled for delivery starting in late 2014. Chicago-based
Boeing delayed the Dreamliner project for a seventh time on Jan.
18, scheduling the model’s first customer handover for the third
quarter of 2011 instead of the current quarter.  The Seattle Times reported on the reduced 787 order on
March 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
