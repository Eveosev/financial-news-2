Gasoline in  New York  Harbor rose as
Sunoco Inc. said it would shut a fluid catalytic cracker at its
Philadelphia refinery for unscheduled repairs.  The work at the 355,000-barrel-a-day plant may last several
weeks, Thomas Golembeski, a Sunoco spokesman, said in an e-mail.
PBF Energy Co.  LLC will also shut an FCC at its refinery in Paulsboro, New
Jersey, for maintenance this month, two people familiar with the
plans said on Jan. 24. The Paulsboro plant can process 185,000
barrels of crude a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in New
York Harbor narrowed 1.13 cents to 15.75 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 12:12
p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery
was unchanged at $2.8777 a gallon.  The same fuel in the  Gulf Coast  was unchanged at a discount
of 16 cents a gallon. Prompt delivery slipped 2.28 cents to
$2.8635.  To contact the reporter on this story:
