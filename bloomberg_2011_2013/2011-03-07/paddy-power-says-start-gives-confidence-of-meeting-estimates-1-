  Paddy Power Plc (PWL)  Finance Director
Jack Massey said today the bookmaker’s good start to 2011 gives
the company confidence it can meet analysts’ estimates of 1.78
euros earnings per share in 2011, a 5.4 percent gain on 2010.  “We aren’t making any announcements that we have concerns
about that figure,” he said in a phone interview. “If anything
we are saying we’ve had a good start.”  Net income climbed to 90 million euros ($125 million) in
the year ended Dec. 31 from 56.9 million euros a year earlier,
as profit rose across all divisions, the Dublin-based bookmaker
said in a statement. Profit at Paddy Power’s retail business in
the U.K. climbed almost six-fold to 7.4 million euros.  Paddy Power is boosting profit from its online operations
and businesses outside of Ireland as retail customers there bet
less amid “challenging economic backdrops.” The amount staked
within the Irish retail business fell 4 percent to 908 million
euros last year, and almost two-thirds of profit is now
generated outside Paddy Power’s home base.  Profit from operations online rose 52 percent to 75 million
euros, 72 percent of total operating profit, Paddy Power said.  In Dublin, Paddy Power rose 1.5 percent to 29.84 euros as
of 8:42 a.m. local time, valuing the company at 1.47 billion
euros.  Bets staked by customers climbed 39 percent to 3.8 billion
euros, while the gross win, or the amount lost by gamblers,
climbed 50 percent to 443.5 million euros.  David Jennings, an analyst at Dublin-based securities firm
Davy said earnings were “in line” with the brokerage’s
estimates, while operating costs at Paddy Power’s online
business were higher than expected.  Paddy Power may open about 30 shops or more in the U.K.
this year, according to Massey. The bookmaker had 124 shops in
the U.K. at the end of last year. The bookmaker 2 or 3 shops in
Ireland this year and had 207 shops at the end of last year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
