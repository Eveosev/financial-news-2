  Spain ’s economy is “on the mend”
and the country can distance itself from peripheral nations
including Greece and  Portugal  as attempts to rein in the  budget
deficit  and boost job creation bear fruit, Morgan Stanley said.  “The consensus view is now too pessimistic on the Spanish
economy,” London-based analysts including Daniele Antonucci
wrote in a note to investors today. “We believe the policy
response that Spain has put in place on several structural
fronts is under-appreciated by most.”  The economists cited steps taken by the government to
overhaul  labor laws  and pensions, increase job creation and
introduce core-capital requirements for savings banks, as well
as rising productivity, as reasons to believe that investors may
be “positively surprised” by the effects of the recent policy
changes on the economy.  The euro region’s fourth-largest economy emerged from a
recession in 2010 and is set to expand 1.3 percent this year,
the government has forecast, with exports leading the recovery.  Morgan Stanley forecasts the Spanish economy will expand by
almost 1.2 percent this year and 1.5 percent in 2012, according
to the note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
