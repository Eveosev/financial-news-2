Millions of people employed by U.K.
public authorities should be moved from final-salary pension
plans to ones based on average earnings over whole careers,
according to John Hutton, a former Labour minister who is
reviewing pensions for Prime Minister David Cameron, the
Financial Times reported.  Also, pensions for National Health Service staff, civil
servants, teachers and others shouldn’t be paid in full until
the age of 65, and that should rise at least in line with
planned increases in the age at which state old-age pensions are
paid, the newspaper said.  Hutton’s recommendations are to be presented this week, the
FT reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
