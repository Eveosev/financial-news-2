Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services
placed Oman’s A-rated long-term and A-1 short-term local and
foreign-currency ratings on review for possible downgrade as the
Persian Gulf country spends to calm demonstrations.  “If protests were to continue, they could undermine
political stability and weaken Oman’s public finances,” Luc Marchand, a London-based analyst with S&P, said today in an e-
mailed statement.  Oman has reshuffled its Cabinet to calm protesters in the
coastal city of Sohar demanding more jobs, better salaries and
more representative political institutions. Sultan Qaboos bin
Said ordered the government to create 50,000 jobs for Omanis and
to pay 150 rials ($390) a month to job seekers.  The new spending plans may cost as much as 1 percent of
gross domestic product each year, according to S&P. The
expenditure probably won’t reverse the country’s projected
budget surplus and Oman’s economy may grow 4 to 5 percent this
year, Marchand said. GDP per capita is forecast to reach $21,000
this year from less than $10,000 in 2004, he said.  S&P also placed the A ratings on Oman Power and Water
Procurement SAOC on review for possible downgrade. A is the
fifth-lowest long-term investment grade at the ratings agency,
while A-1 is its second-highest short-term investment grade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
