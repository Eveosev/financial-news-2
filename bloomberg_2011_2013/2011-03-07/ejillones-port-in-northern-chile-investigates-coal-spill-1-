Port officials in northern  Chile  are
investigating a coal spill in the bay of Mejillones near a
facility used by electricity generators.  Authorities have yet to determine the origin of the spill,
Cesar Barrera, operations manager for Mejillones Port, said by
telephone. The port hasn’t handled a coal shipment since last
week, he said.  The spill was not related to  AES Gener SA (GENER) ’s operations,
Patricia Prenafeta, a company spokeswoman, said today by phone.
Beatriz Monreal, a spokeswoman for E-CL SA, said the power
producer didn’t have information on the spill. State television
station TVN transmitted images earlier today of the spill.  “If you took a picture of the port right now you would see
a blue sea,” Barrera said. “Coal pollutes when it is burned. A
spill may be ugly, but it’s not dangerous. The origin of the
spill could be diverse.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
