West African monetary zone inflation
accelerated to 4.1 percent in January from 3.9 percent the month
before, the Central Bank of West African States said on its
 website  today.  Inflation in the eight-nation economic zone, which uses the
euro-pegged West African CFA franc, was mainly due to rising
food, transport, housing and communication costs, the Dakar,
Senegal-based bank said.  Price-growth averaged 1.4 percent in 2010, up from 0.4
percent the previous year, the bank said in a separate
statement. Higher prices for petrol and food, as well as trade
disruptions caused by the post-election crisis in  Ivory Coast ,
drove that increase, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
