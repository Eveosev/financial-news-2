Oil rose to a 29-month high in  New
York  as escalating violence in Libya bolstered concern that
supply disruptions may spread through the Middle East.  Crude climbed 1 percent after fighting between Libyan
rebels and troops loyal to Muammar Qaddafi intensified. Hedge
funds raised purchases of futures to a record for a second week
on speculation unrest will cut output further. Citigroup Inc.
increased its Brent oil price estimate, saying the threat of
more disruptions supports a “fear premium.”  “The focus remains on Libya and on fears of a contagion
effect that will impact other oil-exporting countries in the
Middle East,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at
Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “Libya appears to be
spiraling into civil war, which will keep prices rising.”  Crude oil for April delivery increased $1.02 to $105.44 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest
settlement since Sept. 26, 2008. The contract is up 29 percent
from a year ago.  Brent crude oil for April settlement slipped 93 cents, or
0.8 percent, to end the session at $115.04 a barrel on the
London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The European benchmark
traded at a $9.60 premium to Nymex oil, the least since Jan. 31.  The oil market hasn’t priced in a prolonged halt to crude
production in Libya and the country may not “produce much oil
over the next six months,”  Francisco Blanch , New York-based
head of global commodities research at Bank of America Merrill
Lynch, said today on Bloomberg Radio.  Price Forecast  Citigroup raised its Brent price estimate for 2011 to $105
a barrel from $90 and for next year to $100, according to a
report by analysts including Mark Fletcher. Commerzbank AG
boosted its forecast for Brent in the second quarter to $120 a
barrel, citing the risk of Middle East supply disruptions.  Violence in Libya has cut output in the North African
country by as much as 1 million barrels a day, according to the  International Energy Agency . Libya pumped 1.59 million barrels a
day in January, Bloomberg News estimates show.  “We’re facing the biggest supply disruption in a number of
years,” said  Phil Flynn , vice president of research at PFGBest
in  Chicago . “The move higher makes sense because this is a very
dangerous time. There’s concern that this will spread to  Saudi
Arabia  and a laundry list of other countries in the region.”  ‘Day of Rage’  Demonstrations have toppled leaders in Tunisia and  Egypt 
and there have been protests in countries including Iran, Yemen
and Oman. In Saudi Arabia, the biggest oil producer in the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, websites have
called for a nationwide “Day of Rage” on March 11 and March
20, according to  Human Rights Watch .  Turmoil in the Middle East also pushed fuel prices higher.
Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, climbed 0.6
cent to $3.509 a gallon yesterday, the highest level since Oct.
5, 2008, the AAA said on its  website .  “It’s getting to the point where the price increases
aren’t good for the economy,” said  Adam Sieminski , chief energy
economist at Deutsche Bank in  Washington . “The consumer-income
impact is close to what was reached in the summer of 2008. The
higher prices will affect  consumer spending  and psychology.”  Oil surged to a record $147.27 a barrel on July 11, 2008,
before plunging 78 percent in the next five months to a low of
$32.40 as the financial crisis unfolded.    Hedge funds  and other large speculators increased net-long
positions amid the turmoil. Wagers on higher prices increased by
27 percent in the seven days ended March 1 to 305,408 futures
and options, the most in records dating back to June 2006,
according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s weekly
Commitments of Traders report. The total has jumped 65 percent
since Feb. 15.  $200 Options  Options traders are betting more than ever that crude oil
is heading to $200 a barrel amid worsening civil unrest in the
Middle East. Open interest, or the number of outstanding
contracts, for “call” options to buy New York crude for June
delivery at $200 a barrel has escalated to the highest level
since the options started trading in July 2009.  Oil in New York on March 4 settled above a price observed
by technical analysts as a point from which the rally may
continue. This level, at $103.39 a barrel, represents the so-
called 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the drop in
December 2008 from the record high, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The next retracement level is $120.16.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 793,881
contracts as of 3:22 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 865,400
contracts on March 4, 8.9 percent above the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.57 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
