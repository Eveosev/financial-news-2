Commission of providing insider tips on companies including
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and  Procter & Gamble Co. (PG)  to the
billionaire hedge-fund manager Raj Rajaratnam.  Earlier today, Gupta resigned from the boards of  AMR Corp. (AMR) 
and Genpact Ltd. The information was disclosed in regulatory
filings. Gupta, 62, last week also resigned as a director of
Procter & Gamble.  Harman, based in Stamford, Connecticut, designs and
