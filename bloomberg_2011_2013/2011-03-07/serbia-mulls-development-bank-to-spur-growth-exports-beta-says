The Serbian government is preparing
to form a  development bank  to aid financing for export-oriented
industries and infrastructure projects,  Beta  news agency
reported, citing Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic.    Serbia ’s real economy is struggling against competitors who
have “longer and cheaper sources of financing” and the bank
would provide the funds by issuing its own bonds and seek
support from international financial institutions, the report
quoted Djelic as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
