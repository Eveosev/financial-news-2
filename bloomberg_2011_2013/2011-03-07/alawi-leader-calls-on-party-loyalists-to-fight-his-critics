Malawi President Bingu wa Mutharika
told the police to collect as much as 5 million kwacha ($33,160)
from any organization planning demonstrates in case there are
damages, and called on his party supporters to protect him.  “I don’t care whether this is constitutional or not,”
Mutharika told a rally yesterday in the commercial capital,
Blantyre, referring to the payments. “I am leaving my critics
in your hands.”  Malawi’s Council for Non-Governmental Organizations warned
Mutharika that they would organize protests if he didn’t move to
ease a fuel shortage and tackle governance issues, the Nation
reported on Feb. 24, citing the council’s chairman, Voice Mhone.
Ten days earlier, police blocked a demonstration against the
fuel shortages and arrested the organizers.  Mutharika called on members of the ruling  Democratic
Progressive Party  “to bring discipline to this country.”  “I have been patient for the last seven years and people
think I am a fool,” the president said. “Do you think I am a
fool? I have never been a fool, I am not a fool and I don’t
intend to become a fool.”  Civil society organizations condemned Mutharika for
inciting violence. Rafiq Hajat, chief executive officer of the
Institute for Policy Interaction told Joy radio station today
that there will be chaos if DPP supporters heed the president’s
call.  To contact the reporter on this story:
