  Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA) , the U.S. electric
carmaker backed by  Daimler AG (DAI)  and  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , said the
first 1,000 units of the battery-powered Model S sedan it
produces next year will be the most expensive version.  About 5,000 of the cars will be made at a factory in
Fremont,  California , in 2012, Tesla said on its  website  today.
The first 1,000 will be the “Signature Series” model, which
can travel as far as 300 miles on a full charge and has a base
price of about $77,400 before a federal tax credit, Tesla said.  “It’s a good business decision: Start with the one that
gets you the most revenue,” said  Jim Hall , an industry analyst
with Birmingham, Michigan-based 2953 Analytics. “Also, if
you’re positioning it as a premium product, better to start with
the highest-priced model and then work your way down.”  Tesla, based in  Palo Alto , California, last month said its
fourth-quarter net loss widened to $51.4 million from $23.2
million a year earlier as it increased investment in the Model
S. The company, named for inventor Nikola Tesla, seeks to become
the leader in battery-powered cars, aided by supply agreements
with Toyota and Daimler.  The Signature model will “feature unique badging and an
extensive complement of options,” George Blankenship, Tesla’s
vice president of sales, said on the company’s website, without
elaborating.  The base-level Model S, which goes 160 miles per charge, is
about $57,400, and a version able to go about 230 miles will be
about $67,400, the company said. The prices for all the Tesla
models are before a $7,500 federal tax credit.  Tesla said it expects to be able to build as many as 20,000
vehicles a year at the California plant by 2013. The Model S is
the second vehicle from Tesla, following the $109,000 electric
Roadster that is partially built in the U.K.  Tesla fell 1 cent to $24.94 at 4 p.m. New York time in
Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading. The shares have dropped
6.3 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
