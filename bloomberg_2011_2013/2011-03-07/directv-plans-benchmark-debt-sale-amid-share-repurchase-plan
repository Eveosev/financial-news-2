  DirecTV (DTV)  issued $4 billion of debt as
the largest U.S. satellite-television provider takes advantage
of the lowest relative yields on investment-grade bonds in more
than three years to reward shareholders.  DirecTV sold $1.5 billion each of 5- and 10-year notes and
$1 billion of 30-year debt in the second-biggest bond sale by a
nonfinancial company this year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Proceeds may be used for share repurchases, the
company said today in a regulatory filing.  The satellite-television provider said on Feb. 23 its board
approved a new $6 billion stock-buyback program after the El
Segundo, California-based company purchased about 136 million
shares for $5.11 billion in 2010. Chief Executive Officer  Michael White  is taking advantage of the lowest relative yields
on investment-grade corporate debt since October 2007 to fund
the buybacks.  “What became clear to me when I got here was that we’re in
a unique environment with all-time record low interest rates,”
White said in a Dec. 2 conference call. “We are able to kind of
frankly change our  capital structure  in a very advantaged way,
almost like we’re private-equity, except we’re doing it with a
public company and it’s been a huge success for our
shareholders.”  DirecTV shares gained 46 percent in 2009 and 20 percent in
2010, finishing last year at $39.93. They’ve added 14.8 percent
this year to $45.84 today.  Biggest Sale  The biggest sale by a nonfinancial company this year was a
$6 billion offering from Petroleo Brasileiro SA on Jan. 20,
Bloomberg data show. It matched a $6 billion sale by General
Electric Capital Corp., the finance arm of General Electric Co.,
on Jan. 4, the data show.    American Airlines  Inc. and Hertz Global Holdings Inc. 
marketed or sold at least $5.6 billion of debt today, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  AMR Corp.’s American Airlines said it planned to sell $1
billion of five-year senior notes secured by routes, takeoff and
landing slots and rights to use space in airport terminals, the  Fort Worth , Texas-based company said today in a statement.  Hertz Corp. sold $500 million of 6.75 percent senior notes
due 2019 in an addition to a February sale, Bloomberg data show.  DirecTV Spread  Investors demanded less extra yield over Treasuries to buy
today’s DirecTV bonds than in the company’s $3 billion offering
in August, Bloomberg data show.  The five-year notes yield 135 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries, the 10-year debt pay a spread of
155 basis points and the 30-year bonds yield 175 basis points
more than benchmarks, the data show.  In August, the company’s offering included $1 billion of
notes due February 2021 that priced at a 185 basis-point spread,
and $1.25 billion of 30-year bonds that priced to yield 210
basis points more than benchmarks, Bloomberg data show. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  The company issued the bonds through DirecTV Holdings LLC
and DirecTV Financing Co., according to the filing.  The  Federal Reserve  has held its key interest rate at zero
to 0.25 percent since December 2008 to spur economic growth. The
extra yield investors demand to own investment-grade corporate
bonds instead of Treasuries fell to 148 basis points on Feb. 17,
the least since October 2007, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data. The spread widened to 149 basis points
on March 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
