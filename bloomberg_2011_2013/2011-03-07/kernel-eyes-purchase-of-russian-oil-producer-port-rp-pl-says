  Kernel Holding SA (KER) , the Ukrainian
exporter of sunflower oil, is close to making a Russian
acquisition that should be completed in the first half of this
year, Rzeczpospolita reported on its Rp.pl website, quoting
Patrick Conrad, Kernelâ€™s director of  investor relations .  Kernel plans to buy a Russian oilseed processor for less
than the 200 million zloty ($70.2 million) it paid for Allseeds
Group in 2010, the newspaper reported, without saying where it
got the information.  The company also wants to buy another port in Ukraine
within the next several months to add to its existing terminals
in Nikolaev and Ilchevsk, at a cost of about $130 million, Rp.pl
cited Conrad as saying.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
