As gains at his hedge fund tumbled
from 49 percent in 2009 to 3 percent last year, Pierre Philippon
of London-based Zadig Asset Management was hearing from clients.  They wanted to know if the company, which runs the Zadig
Fund that beat 91 percent of rivals since 2006 even with last
year’s return, would give them a way to bet only on stock gains
as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index posted its biggest rally in
five decades. He complied, loading up a new fund with companies
such as CGGVeritas that benefit most from economic expansion.  “At the time, we were not keen to do it,” said Philippon,
whose company oversees $650 million, including the Zadig Fund
that was 10th-best in the world this year through Feb. 18 among
hedge funds tracked by London-based  HSBC Holdings Plc. (HSBA)  He
changed his mind as  Europe ’s sovereign credit crisis made shares
too cheap to pass up. “Our call is valuation driven. It’s not
too late to invest in equities.”  As the rally that drove the S&P 500 up 95 percent begins
its third year, more hedge funds are speculating stocks will
advance than at any time since 2007, according to data compiled
by TrimTabs Investment Research and BarclayHedge Ltd. While
money managers playing catch-up with the market’s gains have
helped the benchmark index advance 5.1 percent in 2011, it also
may deplete the pool of new buyers.  Stocks Climb  The S&P 500 rose 0.1 percent to 1,321.15 last week after
first-time claims for  unemployment benefits  slid to the lowest
level since May 2008 and American  service industries  expanded at
the fastest pace in five years, data from the U.S. Labor
Department and the  Institute for Supply Management  showed. The
gain was reduced on March 4 after rising oil and concern
American wage growth is slowing sent the index down 0.7 percent.  The  stock index  lost 0.8 percent to 1,310.13 at 4 p.m. in
New York today as chipmakers slid after Wells Fargo & Co. cut
the industry’s rating and oil climbed to a 29-month high.  Hedge funds, largely unregulated investment vehicles that
aim to make money whether markets rise or fall, took advantage
of record-low  interest rates  to increase borrowings in January
to the highest level since October 2007, according to data
compiled by New York-based  NYSE Euronext. (NYX)  Margin debt peaked in
March 2000 and July 2007, before the S&P 500 began a 57 percent
drop that bottomed at 676.53 on March 9, 2009.  A gauge compiled by TrimTabs and BarclayHedge measuring how
heavily hedge funds are invested in stocks rose to 33 percent in
January, the last month data are available, from the 29 percent
average since 2000. The measure peaked at 66 percent in August
2006 and bottomed at 9.5 percent in June 2007, the data show.  Short Selling  Shares borrowed and sold to profit from declines dropped
four straight months to 3.3 percent of all stock at the end of
January, according to data compiled by NYSE Euronext.  The level of short selling in exchange-traded funds slipped
to 11 percent of shares outstanding in January, the lowest level
since 2001, based on data tracked by Societe Generale SA.
Rebecca Cheong, an equity derivatives strategist for the Paris-
based bank, said this shows hedge funds have been forced to
reduce their bearish bets as the S&P 500 rallied.  “Hedge funds have been underperforming the equity
market,” she said. “Therefore, they can’t afford to short the
market when it rallies.”  Double Down  Zadig Fund has gained 6.6 percent in 2011, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s been helped by Paris-based
CGGVeritas, the world’s largest seismic surveyor of oilfields
that rallied 18 percent through March 4, and  Nasdaq OMX Group
Inc. (NDAQ) , the New York-based exchange operator that also rose 18
percent. The fund trailed the market in 2010 after cutting
investments in luxury-goods makers and emerging markets.  It’s the wrong time to double down, according to Timothy Flannery, managing partner and chief investment officer of
Chicago-based Copia Capital LLC, which manages about $400
million in a hedge fund that bets on stock gains and declines.  The S&P 500 has fallen 1.6 percent from its 2011 closing
high of 1,343.01 after turmoil from  Libya  to Bahrain pushed the
price of oil above $100 a barrel in New York. The U.S. military
is exploring a “full range of options” to respond to unrest in
Libya, U.S. President  Barack Obama  said March 3.  “The U.S. stock market is underpricing geopolitical
risk,” Flannery said.  Hedge funds returned 8.5 percent last year, trailing the  S&P 500 ’s 13 percent gain, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg on 2,728 funds. An investor who bought the Vanguard
500 Index Fund tracking the S&P 500 would have matched the
index’s return last year while paying fees of 0.2 percent,
compared with hedge funds that usually keep 20 percent of any
appreciation.  Biggest Profit  The S&P 500’s rally since March 9, 2009, has produced gains
last seen over a comparable period in 1955, according to data
compiled by S&P. Investors trying to chase that advance will be
disappointed, said  Mark Freeman , who helps manage $11 billion as
co-chief investment officer at Westwood Management Corp. in  Dallas .  “They’re playing catch-up, and equities seem to be the
asset class to do it in,” Freeman said. “You have people who
feel a little more certain about things moving into the market.
I’m not sure how successful an investment strategy that is. The
market may already be incorporating that certainty.”  Fed Stimulus  The S&P 500 has risen 26 percent since Aug. 26, the day
before Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said in Jackson
Hole,  Wyoming , that “he was willing to do everything in his
power” to stimulate growth. In November, the central bank
announced a $600 billion plan to buy Treasuries. The labor
market has improved and companies have topped analysts’ earnings
estimates for eight straight quarters with the fastest profit
growth since the mid-1990s, Bloomberg data show.  Equities may be a bargain compared with bonds. S&P 500
earnings represent 6.45 percent of the index’s value, or 2.96
percentage points more than yields on 10-year Treasuries.  Ben Funk at Liongate Capital Management LLP is sending more
money to managers who are using leverage to enhance returns.
Funk started to get more bullish on equities after Bernanke’s
comments in August.  “We think it’s a thankless mission to try to fight the
Fed,” Funk said. He is head of research at Liongate, which runs
a $3 billion fund of hedge funds in  London . “To be contrarian
is good, but it can be painful before it works. While we respect
that the U.S. is only starting to recover and growth will be
uneven, we do think that over the next two to three quarters,
U.S. equities, certainly relative to credit, are very
attractive.”  Net Deposits  The Liongate Multi-Strategy Fund rebounded from losses
between January and August 2010 to gain an average of 2 percent
in each of the last four months last year, according to investor
documents obtained by Bloomberg. That gave it an annual rise of
4.9 percent, less than half the S&P 500’s gain.  Hedge funds received net deposits of $10.9 billion in
January, according to New York-based HedgeFund.net. Assets rose
0.7 percent in January to $2.5 trillion, the firm said in a Feb.
28 report. They remain 18 percent below record levels in the
second quarter of 2008.  Investors using futures contracts to speculate on stocks
are snapping up technology makers and smaller U.S. companies at
a rate that is close to the most bullish in five years. Large
speculators’ futures positions on the Nasdaq-100 Index are
higher than they’ve been for 86 percent of the time since 2006,
according to data compiled by BNP Paribas SA.  Futures on mid-size companies in the S&P MidCap 400 Index
and small-cap companies in the Russell 2000 Index have only been
more bullish 26 percent and 17 percent of the time.  “U.S. equities are the best investment opportunity there
is from a global perspective,” said  Timothy Ghriskey , chief
investment officer at Solaris Asset Management in  Bedford Hills ,  New York , which manages $2 billion. “The biggest risk to this
is complacency and the perception that everything is great. We
don’t think we’re there yet. There’s certainly a new wall of
worry to climb with the events in the Middle East, but the
market is showing a lot of resilience.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
