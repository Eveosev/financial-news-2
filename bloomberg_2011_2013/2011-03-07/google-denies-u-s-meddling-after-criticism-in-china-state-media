  Google Inc. (GOOG)  denied the U.S.
government meddles in its business decisions after Chinese state
media published an opinion piece saying the Internet-search
company is a “tool” of U.S. foreign policy.  “Contrary to assertions made by the Chinese media, every
decision we have made regarding China has been made by Google
alone,” the Mountain View, California-based company said today
in an e-mailed reply to Bloomberg News.  Google is “a tool of U.S. expansionism and hegemony,”
according to a March 4 opinion piece posted by the website of
the People’s Daily, a publication affiliated with China’s ruling
Communist Party. Google is “playing its political cards in
China” after helping disseminate subversive content that led to
disorder in Middle Eastern countries, according to the piece,
written by a person identified as Zheng Yan.  The  Internet company  is “very compliant” with the
strategic objectives of the U.S. government, according to the
piece.  Google’s statement today was a reiteration, and the company
isn’t commenting on the People’s Daily piece, it said.  Google executive Wael Ghonim helped set up a website for
Egypt opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei as anti-government
protests in the Middle Eastern country toppled President  Hosni Mubarak  last month.  The U.S. company moved its Chinese search-engine service
out of mainland China last year to avoid having to comply with
the country’s Internet censorship rules.  The People’s Daily piece was also carried on Internet sites
including  Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700) ’s QQ.com and Sina Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Mark Lee  in Hong Kong at
