  Israel ’s foreign currency reserves
rose to a record in February, helped by central bank purchases.  Reserves increased to $73.8 billion, from $73.4 billion at
the end of the previous month, the Bank of Israel said in a
statement on its website today. The bank bought $200 million in
February, it said. The reserves also benefited from a $441
million revaluation and an increase of $28 million from private
sector transactions, which were partially offset by government
transfers abroad of $278 million, it said.  Near-zero interest rates in the U.S. and Europe have
spurred record inflows into Israel and other countries where
rates are higher, pushing gains in currencies and undermining
exports.  Bank of Israel  Governor Stanley Fischer began buying
foreign currency in March 2008 and has more than doubled
reserves since then.  The shekel gained 0.4 percent against the dollar and traded
at 3.61 shekels at 12:45 p.m. in  Tel Aviv . The currency has
strengthened by about 3 percent since the beginning of February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
