Seven Energy Ltd. , a Nigerian oil
and gas company, is bidding for  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ’s
production licence OML 34 in the African country, shareholder  Petrofac Ltd. (PFC)  said.  Petrofac, a U.K. oil services company that holds a 15
percent stake in Seven, may help finance the bid, said Chief
Executive Officer Ayman Asfari. Shell is expected to make the
tender announcement in a few weeks, he said.  “If they are successful they would have to raise
additional funding” and “we may support them and may end up
increasing our shareholding,” Asfari said in an interview
today. “Our interest in  Nigeria  is whether they succeed in the
Shell round or not.”  London-based Petrofac plans to expand in West Africa after
securing its first joint project in Nigeria. Shell, which agreed
last year to sell four Nigerian offshore fields out of a total
of 34 blocks it holds in the country, has attracted bids from
companies including Essar Group and  Afren Plc. (AFR)   “The blocks sold and for sale represent less than 10
percent of our production” in Nigeria, Shell Chief Financial
Officer Simon Henry said Feb. 3. “So we’re really reducing the
footprint, increasing indigenous participation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
