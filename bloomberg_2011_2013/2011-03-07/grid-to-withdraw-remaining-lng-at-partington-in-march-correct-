  National Grid Plc (NG/) , operator of
Britain’s natural-gas network, said it plans to empty the
remaining stocks of liquefied natural gas at its onshore
Partington site this month.  The facility in northwest  England  holds less than 13
million cubic meters of the fuel, National Grid said today in an
e-mailed statement. That’s about 1 percent of stocks in storage
in Britain.  The company said it is emptying Partington to prevent gas
from being stranded and failing to meet quality standards.  “The decline in gas quality at Partington has mainly been
because LNG had to be transported by road tanker from there
during 2010 to maintain supplies of gas to customers,” National
Grid said in the statement.  Partington was also kept at a state of “short stand-by”
in January and February to ensure it could meet peak winter
demand for gas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
