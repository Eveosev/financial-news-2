The euro climbed to a four-month
high against the dollar as bets increased the  European Central
Bank  will raise interest rates before the  Federal Reserve ,
boosting demand for the shared currency.  The 17-nation currency climbed above $1.40 for a second day
even after Moody’s Investors Service downgraded Greece’s credit
rating. Currencies linked to commodities, such as the Australian
and Canadian dollars, rose as oil advanced to a 29-month high.
New Zealand’s dollar fell against most of its major peers after
Prime Minister John Key said lower borrowing costs would be
helpful.  “The clear driver is the expectation of an ECB rate
hike,” said  Mark McCormick , a currency strategist at Brown
Brothers Harriman & Co. in New York. “You’re seeing a lot more
momentum in the euro move and it’s a lot less sensitive to
sovereign-debt downgrades.”  The euro gained 0.1 percent to $1.4005 at 9:06 a.m. in  New
York , from $1.3987 on March 4, when it completed a 1.7 percent
weekly advance. The shared currency earlier traded as high as
$1.4036, the strongest level since Nov. 8. It traded at 114.99
yen, from 115.13. The dollar fetched 82.11 yen, from 82.32 yen.  Dollar Trend  The Dollar Index, which IntercontinentalExchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S.
trading partners, including the euro and yen, slipped 0.1
percent to 76.297, after touching the weakest since Nov. 5.  The euro gained last week after policy makers left the
refinancing rate at 1 percent and ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said they may raise borrowing costs as early as their
next meeting in April to contain inflation. The implied yield on
the three-month Euribor contract expiring in December was at
2.16 percent today from 1.94 percent a week earlier, indicating
investors are increasing wagers on higher  interest rates .  Trichet said the world’s central bankers are united in
their aim to prevent surging  oil prices  from fanning broader
inflation.  “There is amongst central bankers a solid unity of purpose
to continue to anchor solidly inflation expectations,” Trichet
said today in  Basel ,  Switzerland , after chairing the Global
Economy Meeting.  Year-End Target  Morgan Stanley increased its year-end target for the single
currency to $1.45 from an earlier prediction of $1.24, Gabriel de Kock, a New York-based executive director, wrote in a
research report published yesterday. The currency will decline
to $1.34 by the end of December, according to the median of 44
strategists’ predictions compiled by Bloomberg News.  The euro also rose after an index measuring European
investor confidence rose to a 3 ½-year high. The index, which
measures sentiment in the euro region, increased to 17.1 for
March from 16.7 in February, Limburg, Germany-based  Sentix 
research institute said today.  Moody’s cut  Greece ’s credit rating three steps to B1 from
Ba1, citing the rising risk of default. European Union leaders
are due to meet this month and try to agree to a package of
measures to contain the debt crisis that forced Greece and
Ireland to seek financial aid last year.  Investors have become so bullish on the euro against the
dollar that past trading trends suggest they may start reversing
those bets. The number of contracts that  hedge funds  and other
large speculators hold at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
anticipating a gain in the single currency jumped to 51,308 as
of March 4, according to the Washington-based Commodity Futures
Trading Commission.  Net Longs  The last time so-called net longs exceeded 45,000 contracts
was in October. The following month the euro weakened 6.9
percent against the dollar. They also topped the 45,000 mark a
year earlier, just before the currency began about a six-month,
21 percent decline.  The Canadian dollar added 0.3 percent to 97.07 cents per  U.S. dollar  and the Aussie advanced 0.2 percent to $1.0161.  Oil,  Canada ’s biggest export, crude oil, surged as much as
2.4 percent to $106.95, the highest since September 2008.    New Zealand ’s  Treasury Department  said costs from the Feb.
22 quake that wrecked the central business district of
Christchurch may triple the estimated NZ$5 billion ($3.7
billion) bill from a temblor that hit the city in September. The
expense will be shared between the government, insurers and
businesses, Finance Minister Bill English said yesterday.  The  New Zealand dollar  traded at NZ$1.3722 per Australian
dollar from NZ$1.3735 in New York on March 4. It earlier touched
NZ$1.3789, the weakest level since June 1992. The kiwi bought
73.81 U.S. cents from 73.83 last week, when it reached 73.39
cents, the lowest since Oct. 1.  To contact the reporters on this story:
