U.S. Gulf crude premiums weakened as
the benchmark West  Texas  Intermediate’s discount to its European
counterpart narrowed.  The gap between April-delivery WTI futures and Brent, the
basis for European and West African crudes, narrowed 52 cents to
$11.03 at 12:20 p.m. in  New York . The differential settled at a
record $15.94 on Feb. 16.  When Brent falls versus WTI, it weakens the value of low-
sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil priced
against Brent.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium narrowed 25 cents to $14.75
a barrel, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Heavy
Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI weakened 85 cents to $14.65.  Among Gulf Coast sour, or high-sulfur, grades, Mars Blend’s
premium to WTI narrowed 50 cents to $8.50 a barrel, a one-month
low, while Poseidon weakened 45 cents to $8.35 over the
benchmark.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium shed $1.75 to $7 a barrel.
Thunder Horse weakened 25 cents to $13.75 a barrel over WTI.  West Texas Sour’s discount widened 10 cents to $3.60 a
barrel. WTS is delivered in Midland, Texas, so its price is less
influenced by imports.  Syncrude’s premium was unchanged at $14.60 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the  tar sands  in  Alberta . The discount for Western Canada Select was
unchanged at $20 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Aaron Clark  in New York at
