  Kuwait ’s  Capital Markets Authority 
is likely to start operating this month after its bylaws are
published in the weekly Official Gazette, an official at the
authority said today.  The bylaws were approved March 3 by the authority’s five-
member board and sent to the gazette for publication, Yousuf al-
Ali, a board member, said in a telephone interview.  Kuwait’s parliament in February 2010 approved a bill to
create the authority, the country’s first stock market
regulator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
