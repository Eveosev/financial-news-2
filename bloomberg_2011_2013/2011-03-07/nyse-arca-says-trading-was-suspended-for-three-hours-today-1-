NYSE Arca, the electronic stock
exchange owned by New York-based  NYSE Euronext (NYX) , was halted for
about three hours today, according to an e-mail.  “The issue was identified as originating in a symbol
mapping process which did not run as expected,” the company
said in an e-mail. “Resolution of the matter required a restart
of the matching engines and customer gateways, and NYSE Arca
developers have taken measures to prevent future occurrences.”  The interruption started at 4 a.m. New York time and lasted
until 7:08 a.m., the company said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
