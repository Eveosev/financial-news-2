The General Co. of Iron and Steel
Products , a Syrian state monopoly producer of steel billets,
will boost annual output fourfold from July to cut imports.  Hadeed Hama, as the company is known, will produce 288,000
metric tons of billets a year from the end of July following an
expansion, up from 70,000 tons now, Nedhal Fallouh, general
manager of its parent, the General Organization of Engineering
Industries, said in a phone interview from Damascus today.  Syria will meet about a quarter of its needs for billets,
used to make steel, curbing imports mostly from  Ukraine , while
the company will also expand production of iron bars, he said.  In 2008, Apollo Steel Corp. of  India  was awarded a $34
million contract to expand one of Hadeed Hamaâ€™s plants. The
Indian government provided $25 million in loans, while the rest
of the financing was secured by the Syrian state, Fallouh said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
