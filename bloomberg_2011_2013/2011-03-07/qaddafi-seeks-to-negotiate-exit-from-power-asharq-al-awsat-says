Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  sent
an envoy to a Benghazi-based rebel council to negotiate
relinquishing power and leaving the country, Asharq al-Awsat
reported, citing unidentified Libyans in the eastern city.  In return, Qaddafi demanded that his security and wealth be
guaranteed by the rebels and that he would not be under
prosecution once abroad, the London-based newspaper said today
in a report from Cairo.  In a separate report, the newspaper said Qaddafi will
“certainly” fight a battle in his hometown of Sirte. It cited
state and opposition officials without explaining the
contradiction between the two reports.  To contact the reporters on this story:
