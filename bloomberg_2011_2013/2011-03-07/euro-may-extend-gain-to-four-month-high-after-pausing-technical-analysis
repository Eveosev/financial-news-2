The euro may extend this year’s
rally to a four-month high against the dollar after a brief
pause, Forecast Pte said, citing trading patterns.  The single currency’s daily, weekly and monthly charts are
all still “positive,” said Pak Lai Ng, a technical analyst at
Forecast in  Singapore . At the same time, short-term momentum
indicators such as the relative strength index suggest the
currency may be approaching “overbought” levels, he said.  “The euro is likely to consolidate from here first before
it can head higher again” toward the Nov. 4 high of $1.4282,
Singapore-based Ng said. “The trend is still pretty firm.”  The euro traded at $1.3961 as of 8:19 a.m. in Tokyo after
climbing to $1.4036 yesterday, the strongest level since Nov. 8.
The currency rose 1.7 percent last week, a third weekly advance,
and has appreciated 4.3 percent this year.  The common currency is poised to add to gains after closing
last week above major resistance at $1.3974, Ng said. That level
is on a descending trend line connecting the Dec. 3, 2009, high
of $1.5141 and the Nov. 4, 2010, high of $1.4282, he said.
Resistance refers to a level where sell orders may be clustered.  The euro’s moving average convergence/divergence, or MACD,
also indicates a further advance, Ng said. The MACD was 0.0112
today, above the so-called signal line of 0.0091, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  MACD is a gauge of momentum and is calculated by
subtracting the 26-day exponential moving average from the 12-
day average. The signal line is a nine-day exponential moving
average of the MACD, and provides buy and sell signals.  The euro’s 14-day RSI was at 66.8 today from 59.3 a week
ago, approaching the level of 70 that suggests a currency is
about to change direction.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security, commodity,
currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
