European Union cow’s-milk prices
rose 1.7 percent in January, rebounding from a month-earlier
drop on “tight availability” of dairy products, a  report  by
LTO-Nederland showed.  The average price paid by dairies to farmers rose to 32.85
euros ($46.02) for 100 kilograms (220 pounds) from 32.29 euros
in December, the Dutch farm organization’s  online report  showed.
That followed a 2.9 percent drop in the previous month, based on
LTO data.  Dairy prices rose initially in 2011 as buyers sought to
cover requirements for future months, before making “a
turnaround” in the last week of February, according to LTO.
Prices started to drop at the end of last month as the market
sought a “new, more balanced” level, it said.  “International buyers are becoming more reluctant to make
purchases at current high levels,” LTO said. Last week,
“market nervousness was growing as prices were accelerating and
moving too fast ahead of fundamental factors,” it said.  LTO reported last month that rising milk supply was
weighing on prices, with EU production rising 1.1 percent from a
year earlier in the January-to-November period.  Dairies in  France  and some in  Germany  increased payments to
farmers in January, while U.K. dairies cut their prices,
according to LTO. Robert Wiseman Dairies Plc,  Scotland ’s largest
provider of fresh milk, said Jan. 27 raw-milk suppliers were
seeking a price increase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
