Nippon Yusen K.K.,  Asia ’s largest
listed shipping line, may slow its container vessels by a
further 10 percent to pare fuel usage after bunker prices jumped
to the highest in more than two years.  “The rising price of oil is becoming a thorny issue,”
Mikitoshi Kai, head of  investor relations , said in an interview
in Tokyo yesterday. The shipping line may reduce sailing speeds
by as much as 2 knots after previously slowing vessels to about
20 knots from about 24 knots, he said.  A 10 percent speed cut would pare fuel costs by about 30
percent, Kai said, helping offset  oil prices  that have surged
because of unrest in the Middle East and North Africa. Tokyo-
based Nippon Yusen has said that every $1 increase in per-ton
fuel prices cuts pretax profit by 200 million yen ($2.4 million).  Globally, container vessels traveled at average speeds of
11.2 knots last month, 12 percent slower than two years earlier,
according data compiled by Bloomberg.  Nippon Yusen will reduce costs at its container-ship
operations,  Japan’s second-biggest , by at least 15 billion yen
in the year ending this month, mainly due to slower speeds, Kai
said. Overall, the company, which also operates tankers and car
carriers, will cut costs by more than 30 billion yen, he said.  The shipping line fell 2.5 percent to 346 yen at the 3 p.m.
close of trade in Tokyo, the lowest since Nov. 4, 2010. The
shares have dropped 3.9 percent this year, compared with a 2.9
percent gain for the Nikkei 225 Stock Average. Mitsui O.S.K.
Lines Ltd., Japan’s largest container-ship operator, has
declined 4 percent this year.  Kai declined to comment on how fuel prices would affect
Nippon Yusen’s profit this fiscal year. The shipping line has
forecast net income of 76 billion yen on sales of 1.93 trillion
yen for the year ending March 31.  The price of 380 Centistoke marine bunker fuel, used by
ships, reached $669.50 a metric ton on Feb. 24 in  Singapore , the
highest since Sept. 4, 2008, according to figures compiled by
Bloomberg. It closed at $635.50 yesterday.  Nippon Yusen has predicted fuel prices will average $550 in
the three months ending March 31.  To contact the reporters on this story:  Chris Cooper  in Tokyo at
