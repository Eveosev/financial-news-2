Low-sulfur  fuel oil ’s premium to its
more-polluting equivalent rose to the most in more than 26
months amid disruption of exports from Libya.  Libyan rebels were in control of the oil port of Ras Lanuf
in the country’s east, Khaled el-Sayeh, a coordinator between
the opposition’s military forces and the interim ruling council
in Benghazi, said yesterday. The Ras Lanuf facility usually
exports about 70,000 barrels a day of fuel oil, mainly the low-
sulfur grade, said  Christophe Barret , an oil analyst at Credit
Agricole CIB.  “It could be that Libya is cutting exports of the fuel,”
Barret said from  London . Italy may be using more low-sulfur fuel
oil in power generation as exports of natural gas from the north
Africa nation were halted, Barret said.  Fuel oil containing 1 percent of sulfur traded on March 4
at a premium of $45 to 3.5 percent sulfur bunker fuel, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the most since December
2008, the data show.  Oil exports from  Libya , North Africa’s third-largest
producer, dropped by about 50 percent in the week to March 1 as
companies including OMV AG closed fields and evacuated workers,
according to Zug, Switzerland researcher Petromatrix GmbH. Ras
Lanuf had its crude supply interrupted, two officials, who
declined to be named, said on Feb. 28.  Libyan crude yields a higher proportion of diesel, jet fuel
and gasoline than heavier grades such as  Russia ’s Urals and
Saudi Arabia’s Arab Medium.  To contact the reporter on this story:
