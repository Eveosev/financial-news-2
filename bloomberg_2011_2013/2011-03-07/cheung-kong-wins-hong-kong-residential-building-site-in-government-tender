  Cheung Kong Holdings Ltd. (1) , the  Hong
Kong  developer controlled by billionaire  Li Ka-shing , won a
building site in the city’s Yuen Long district in a government
tender.  The winning bid for the 12,340 square-meter (133,000
square-foot) site was HK$2.41 billion ($309 million), according
to a statement on the Lands Department website.  Cheung Kong ,
Hong Kong’s second biggest builder by market value, confirmed in
a faxed statement it was the winner bidder.  Hong Kong’s government in November intensified a year-long
battle to curb real estate prices by imposing additional
property transaction taxes and pledging to increase land supply
for medium and small housing units.  Home prices  have gained
about 65 percent in the past two years on record low mortgage
rates and an influx of buyers from mainland  China .  Successful bidders for the site will be required to build
at least 960 apartments with a saleable area of not more than 60
square meters, according to a statement on the Lands Department
website. The homes should be ready for occupation by Sept. 30,
2016, the statement said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
