  Kenya ’s shilling weakened for the
third day against the dollar as oil climbed to a 29-month high
and on speculation drought will reduce earnings from
agricultural exports.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy depreciated
as much as 0.7 percent to 83.50 per dollar and was trading 0.2
percent down at 83.10 shillings at 11:50 a.m. in Nairobi, the
capital. It closed at 82.92 shillings on March 4.  “The local unit is experiencing the pressure of rising
global fuel prices and with expectation of reduced agricultural
earnings due to the ongoing drought conditions, it will be under
pressure in the coming days,” Joshua Anene, a dealer at
Commercial Bank of  Africa , said by phone from Nairobi today.  Crude for April delivery increased as much as $2.03 to
$106.45 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , the highest intraday price since Sept. 29,
2008 as escalating violence in  Libya  renewed concern supply
disruptions may spread through the Middle East.  Poor rainfall, especially in the tea-growing East and
West Rift regions, has disrupted both smallholders and
plantation farmers, the Tea Board of Kenya said Feb. 24. Tea
production in January declined to 35.9 million kilograms
compared with 37.7 million kilograms a year earlier, the board
said.  Tea is Kenya’s biggest foreign-exchange earner and the
nation is the world’s biggest exporter of the black variety.  To contact the reporter on this story:
