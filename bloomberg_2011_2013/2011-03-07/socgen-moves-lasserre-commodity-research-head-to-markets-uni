  Societe Generale (GLE)  SA said it
appointed Frederic Lasserre as product-line manager for the
commodities investor group within its commodities markets
division.  Lasserre, 45, left his position as head of commodities
research at SocGen at the beginning of January, the Paris-based
bank said in an e-mailed response to questions today, without
saying who will replace him. Paris-based Lasserre will report to
global head of commodity markets Edouard Neviaski and deputy
head Jean Fran√ßois Maurey, the bank said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
