  Canada ’s dollar strengthened against
most of its major currencies as crude oil, the nation’s biggest
export, touched a 29-month high amid escalating violence in
Libya bolstered concern that supply disruptions may spread.  The currency pared losses against its U.S. counterpart
after crude oil eased from its highest levels. The loonie, as
the currency is nicknamed, rose versus its other most-traded
currencies, except for the Norwegian krone, Japanese yen,  Singapore dollar  and South African rand. The Thomson
Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials was little
changed after climbing as much as 1.1 percent to the highest
level since September 2008.  “Even with oil rallying, the moves in terms of the
Canadian dollar has still been pretty small,” said  John Doyle ,
a strategist in  Washington  at currency-trading firm Tempus
Consulting Inc. “It would take something really large to move
it really stronger against the dollar.”  The loonie was little changed at 97.33 cents per dollar at
5:00 p.m. in Toronto, from 97.34 on March 4. It touched 96.84
cents on March 1, the strongest since November 2007. One
Canadian dollar buys $1.02743.  Crude oil for April delivery gained 0.4 percent to $104.88,
after rising as much as 2.4 percent to $106.95, the highest
since September 2008. The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index
dropped 1.1 percent after climbing as much as 0.5 percent.  Libya Watch  Forces loyal to Muammar Qaddafi extended their
counteroffensive against rebels near the oil hub of Ras Lanuf
into a second day, launching multiple airstrikes that
accelerated international planning for a no-fly zone over  Libya .  Futures traders increased their bets that the Canadian
dollar will gain against the  U.S. dollar , figures from the
Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading Commission show. The
difference in the number of wagers by  hedge funds  and other
large speculators on an advance in the Canadian dollar compared
with those on a drop, so-called net longs, was 72,827 on March
1, compared with net longs of 68,348 a week earlier.    Government bonds  fell, pushing the yield on the 10-year
benchmark up two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.35
percent. The price of the 3.50 percent note maturing in June
2020 decreased 15 cents to C$101.19.  Building Trends  Canadian building permits unexpectedly fell in January,
posting the third drop in four months, as non-residential and
multiple-unit housing projects declined, government figures
showed.  The total value of permits issued by municipalities
decreased 5.1 percent to C$5.37 billion ($5.53 billion),
according to Ottawa-based Statistics Canada. The decline was
bigger than all 13 estimates in a Bloomberg News economist
survey that had a median of a 0.5 percent increase. Building
permits were 4 percent lower than in the same month a year
earlier, the report said.  “Anything domestically is really insignificant unless it’s
really surprising number,” said  Shane Enright , executive
director at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce’s CIBC World
Markets unit. “ The market is looking ahead to the trade
numbers as we want to see how we’re doing on the export side
since the  Bank of Canada  raised concern whether a strong
currency is going to pare our exports.”  Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News project a C$2.6
billion surplus on March 10, according to the median of 22
estimates. Canada posted its first  trade surplus  in 10 months in
December as energy and metals powered the biggest jump in
exports in almost three decades. The C$3 billion trade surplus
followed a revised November deficit of C$115 million,  Statistics
Canada  said Feb. 11 in Ottawa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
