  TMX Group Inc. (X) , owner of the Toronto
Stock Exchange, is “exclusively focused” on its proposed
combination with the  London Stock Exchange Group Plc (LSE)  and not on
other bourses, said Kevan Cowan, group head of TMX’s equities
business.  “We always consider all opportunities, but this is the deal
that we’ve chosen as the best deal for us, the best deal for our
customers, the best deal for Canada,” Cowan told reporters after
a speech at a mining conference today in Toronto. “We’re
committed to it and we’re focusing on it exclusively so we can
get it done.”  The Sunday Times in London reported yesterday that the
London Stock Exchange Group may consider a takeover of Nasdaq
OMX Group Inc. this year after it completes the merger with the
TMX Group.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
