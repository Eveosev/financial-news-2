  Vietnam ’s benchmark five-year bonds
dropped, with the yield climbing the most in almost four months
as  interbank market   interest rates  increased. The dong fell.  “Demand to raise funds from the interbank market has risen
after the central bank reiterated a cap of 14 percent for dong
deposits, pushing the interest rates up,” said Luu Hai Yen, an
analyst at Thang Long Securities Joint-Stock Co.  The yield on the notes gained 19 basis points, the most
since Nov. 10, to 11.817 percent, according to a daily fixing
price from banks compiled by Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  The overnight interbank deposit rate gained for a seventh
day, climbing 8.3 basis points to 12.36 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong traded at 20,865 per dollar as of 4:13 p.m. in
Hanoi, from 20,835 on Mar. 4, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam fixed the reference rate at
20,658 today, compared with 20,663 on Mar. 4, its website showed.
The currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side
of that rate.  The dong traded between 21,450 and 21,650 per dollar this
afternoon at money changers in Hanoi, from 21,730 and 21,780 on
Mar. 4, according to a telephone-information service run by the
state-owned Vietnam Posts & Telecommunications.  --Nguyen Kieu Giang in Hanoi. Editor: Alan Soughley  To contact the Bloomberg News Staff on this story:
