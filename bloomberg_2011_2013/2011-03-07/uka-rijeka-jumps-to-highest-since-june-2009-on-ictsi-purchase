Luka Rijeka d.d. rose to its highest
in almost two years after  International Container Terminal
Services Inc. (ICT)  agreed to buy a majority stake in the Croatian
company’s Adriatic Gate Container Terminal.  Luka Rijeka jumped 5.1 percent to 255.1 kuna at 4 p.m. in
Zagreb, its highest close since June 2009, according to the
volume-weighted average price, which the exchange uses to
calculate the closing level. The stock fell to 241.55 kuna in
the last trade of the day, according to the bourse’s  website .  ICTSI will take 51 percent of AGCT in the city of Rijeka,
Croatia by buying new shares and existing stock from Luka
Rijeka, the Manila-based company said today. It will pay 27.5
million euros ($38.6 million) for the stake.  “It’s definitely positive news for  Croatia ’s largest port
operator,” Ivana Blaskovic, an equity analyst at UniCredit
SpA’s Zagreb-based unit, said by phone today. “The entry of one
of the big international players will increase traffic and
likely attract new shipping lines.”  ICTSI and Luka Rijeka, which will keep a 49 percent stake
in AGCT, plan to invest more than 70 million euros to expand the
terminal with the aim of servicing trade across the Balkans,
Hungary, the  Czech Republic , Slovakia and southern  Poland , the
Philippine company said. Croatia’s economy may grow for the
first time since 2008 this year, according to the  World Bank .  To contact the reporters on this story:
