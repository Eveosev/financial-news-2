  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  bought 169
million euros ($237 million) of  Bulgari SpA (BUL)  shares in a
transaction linked with  LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC) ’s
takeover bid for the Italian company, said two people close to
the deal.  The bank purchased 13.84 million Bulgari shares at 12.24
euros apiece in the market, according to the people, who
declined to be named because the information isn’t public.  Bulgari surged as much as 62 percent today to 12.29 euros,
as LVMH agreed to pay 3.7 billion euros ($5.2 billion) for the
world’s third-biggest jeweler. The stock traded at 11.99 euros
as of 12:16 p.m. in Milan.  Bulgari family members said today in a statement they
mandated Credit Suisse to buy shares to avoid any stakeholding
dilution stemming from the issue of equity-linked bonds due
2014.  LVMH agreed to purchase the Bulgari family’s 50.4 percent
stake in the Italian company for 1.87 billion euros in stock and
will then make a tender offer for the rest, according to a joint
announcement distributed by the Italian Exchange today.  LVMH was advised by  Credit Agricole  while Bulgari was
advised by Credit Suisse.  To contact the reporters on this story:
