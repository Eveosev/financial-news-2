  South Africa ’s FTSE/JSE Africa All
Share Index declined for a second day, losing 38.85, or 0.1
percent, to 32,298.21 at the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today.    FirstRand Ltd. (FSR)  , South Africa’s second-biggest
financial-services company, dropped the most since Feb. 24,
falling 36 cents, or 1.9 percent, to 19.06 rand. The company’s
results were released a day early because Reuters published
information that “was not accessed from a source that could be
considered in the public domain,” the company said in a
statement. The firm’s website was breached, spokeswoman Sam
Moss said in a telephone interview in Johannesburg today. Net
income almost tripled to 12.1 billion rand ($1.76 billion) from
4.52 billion rand a year earlier, it said.    Gijima Group Ltd. (GIJ)  , an information technology
company, slumped the most since May 4, retreating 6 cents, or
7.2 percent, to 77 cents. Gijima said it has resolved a dispute
with South Africa’s Home Affairs Department, resulting in a loss
per share of 27.99 cents in the first half through December,
which will take its total loss to as much as 28.5 cents for the
period, from a profit of 8.83 cents a share a year earlier.  Palabora Mining Co. (PAM SJ), a copper producer, dropped to
the lowest in a month, falling 3.25 rand, or 2.4 percent, to
130.75 rand. Copper fluctuated in  London  as investors weighed
higher  oil prices  and swelling stockpiles against economic
releases indicating that economies are still recovering.    Sasol Ltd. (SOL)  , the largest producer of motor fuels
made from coal, advanced 2.49 rand, or 0.7 percent, to 386.99
rand, extending its gain this year to 12 percent. The company
said net income rose 21 percent to 7.6 billion rand in the six
months through December as it cut costs, and oil and chemical
prices rose. Sasol boosted its dividend 11 percent to 3.10 rand
for the period.    1time Holdings Ltd. (1TM) , (1TM SJ), a low-cost airline company,
declined the most in a week, falling 2 cents, or 2.8 percent, to
70 cents. The company said it has issued 70 million new shares,
or 25 percent of the issued shares, to a consortium of investors
at 49 million rand, a 10 percent discount to the previous 30-day
volume weighted average price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
