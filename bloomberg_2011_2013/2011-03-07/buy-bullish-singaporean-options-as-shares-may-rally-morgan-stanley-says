Investors should buy bullish options
on  Singapore  stocks because the derivatives are inexpensive and
the shares may rally on higher earnings growth and a
strengthening Singapore dollar,  Morgan Stanley (MS)  said.  Derivatives strategists  Viktor Hjort  and Philipp Schoenhuber recommended buying three-month over-the-counter call
options on the  MSCI Singapore Free (SIMSCI)  Index with a strike price 5
percent above the current level, according to a report dated
today. The gauge has climbed 2.3 percent from a six-month low on
Feb. 24.  The Hong-Kong based strategists cited a separate report
today by Morgan Stanley’s Hozefa Topiwalla, who initiated
Singapore stocks with a “constructive” rating and said the
MSCI gauge may rally 12 percent this year and gain 20 percent
including dividends and currency gains.  “Singapore’s equity market has the potential to deliver
returns similar to emerging markets with risks similar to
developed markets,” Singapore-based Topiwalla wrote in his
report. “Considering its near-developed-market risk profile, we
believe that its risk-reward appears quite favorable.”  Implied volatility, the key gauge of option prices, for
three-month contracts on the MSCI gauge is 17, near “multi-year
lows” and ranking at the fourth percentile of all readings over
the past five years, Hjort and Schoenhuber wrote. Shorter-dated
calls are “among the cheapest in the region,” they said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
