Elliott Advisors (UK) Ltd. has
introduced a  website  to help investors in  Actelion Ltd. (ATLN)  register
their shares and vote at the Swiss biotechnology company’s
annual general meeting on May 5.  The hedge fund has also hired shareholder proxy adviser
Georgeson to help investors who want to vote at the meeting,
Elliott said today in an e-mailed statement.  Elliott, part of a $17 billion hedge fund founded by Paul
Singer, last month sent two letters to Actelion’s board asking
the company to study a sale and disclose any takeover
approaches. The fund also called for the resignation of Actelion
Chairman Robert Cawthorn and for Jean-Paul Clozel to step down
from the board. Actelion has said Elliott’s proposals “risk
destabilizing the company.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
