Bahrain’s Crown Prince Salman bin
Hamad Al Khalifa said there’s a “70 to 80 percent consensus”
on a plan to engage with the country’s opposition after weeks of
protests, state-run Bahrain News Agency reported.  “Everybody wants better services, everybody wants dignity,
everybody wants to be heard, everybody wants accountability,”
the news agency cited the crown prince as saying in a   speech 
late yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
