Former Czech President Vaclav Havel
said an international intervention in  Libya  will be needed if  Muammar Qaddafi  continues to commit crimes,  Hospodarske Noviny 
reported, citing an interview with the former anti-communist
dissident.  The intervention may take several forms, including
supporting the rebels, blocking Libya’s air space or conducting
a direct attack on Qaddafi’s hideouts, the newspaper cited Havel
as saying in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
