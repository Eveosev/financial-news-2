The Indian unit of  CLP Holdings
Ltd. (2) , Hong Kong’s biggest power supplier, plans to build two
wind farms in the South Asian nation within a year.  The 102-megawatt farm at Sipla in Rajasthan state and a 50-
megawatt farm at Nallakonda in Andhra Pradesh state will raise
its wind capacity in India to 639 megawatts, Rajiv Mishra,
managing director of CLP Power India Pvt., said today in an
interview in Mumbai.  The company, which also has wind farms in Australia, Taiwan
and  China , aims to get 20 percent of its power from renewable
sources by 2020. In India, it has about 2,613 megawatts of
capacity either built or under construction including a 1,320-
megawatt coal plant in Haryana.  CLP will buy 191 turbines of 800 kilowatts each from  Germany ’s Enercon GmbH for the wind projects.  The capital cost of the project comes to about $1.3 million
a megawatt, Mishra said, declining to state the value of the
order. The project will be financed internally, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
