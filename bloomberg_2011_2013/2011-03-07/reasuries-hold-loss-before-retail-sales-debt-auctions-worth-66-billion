Treasuries fell, pushing the 30-year
yield toward the highest level in almost two weeks, as the
government prepared this week to sell $66 billion of notes and
bonds and before a report forecast to show retail sales rose.  The extra yield investors demand to hold 30-year bonds
instead of 2-year notes increased to 394 basis points, the
widest level since Feb. 18. Citigroup Inc.’s U.S. Economic
Surprise Index climbed last week to 97.50, the highest since it
began in 2003, as economic reports surpassed expectations.  “Yields are biased higher at the longer end of the curve
in the U.S. due to the anticipation of supply over the coming
days,” said  Orlando Green , assistant director of capital
markets strategy at Credit Agricole SA in  London . “There may be
a question of dealers making room for this long-end supply.
Decent macroeconomic data still reflects an ongoing recovery and
has a tendency to push yields higher.”  Treasury 30-year bond yields advanced five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 4.64 percent at 7:46 a.m. in  New York ,
according to BGCantor Market Data. The 4.75 percent note
maturing in February 2041 decreased 23/32, or $7.19 per $1,000
face amount, to 101 23/32.  The yield touched 4.66 percent on March 4, the highest
level since Feb. 22. Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields were
three basis points higher at 3.52 percent today.  The government will auction $32 billion of three-year notes
tomorrow, $21 billion of 10-year securities the next day and
$13 billion of 30-year bonds on March 10.  Economic Recovery  Treasuries dropped last week on speculation turmoil in
North Africa and the Middle East won’t derail the recovery from
the worst economic slump since the Great Depression.  U.S. payrolls rose by 192,000 in February after an increase
of 63,000 in the previous month, the Labor Department reported
March 4. The  unemployment rate  unexpectedly dropped to 8.9
percent, the lowest level since April 2009.  Retail sales advanced 1 percent in February following a 0.3
percent gain a month earlier, according to the median forecast
of 63 economists in a Bloomberg News survey before the Commerce
Department’s report on March 11.  The difference between yields on 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader expectations
for consumer prices, increased to 2.53 percentage points, within
one basis point of the highest level since July 2008.  Treasuries have handed investors a 0.4 loss this year as
the economy showed signs of improvement, according to indexes
compiled by the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies and Bloomberg. The  MSCI World (MXWO)  Index of stocks has
returned 5.4 percent.  Gross’s View  Investors should avoid Treasuries and buy higher-returning
securities such as emerging-market debt and corporate bonds,
Pacific Investment Management Co.’s  Bill Gross , who runs the
world’s biggest bond fund, said March 4 in a radio interview
with  Tom Keene  on the “Bloomberg Surveillance” program.  Gross, who is based in  Newport Beach ,  California , cut
holdings of U.S. government and related debt in Pimco’s
$237 billion Total Return Fund in January to 12 percent, the
lowest level in two years.  Investors outside the U.S. have boosted their holdings of
longer-maturity Treasuries to the highest level since credit
markets froze in 2008, helping to curb rising yields amid
concern inflation is accelerating.  International buyers held 90 percent of their
$4.44 trillion of  U.S. government debt  in notes and bonds as of
December, the same as in September 2008, when Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. collapsed,  Treasury data  released last week show.
The ratio dropped to 83 percent in October 2009 as investors
sought the safety of Treasury bills with the U.S. economic
recovery still in question.  To contact the reporter on this story:
