California is considering banning
the sale, possession or distribution of shark fins, used in a
Chinese soup that can fetch more than $80 a bowl, the  Daily
Telegraph  reported, citing state legislators.  The removal of shark fins is illegal in U.S. waters
although importers may bring them in from overseas;  Hawaii  has
already outlawed shark fin sale and possession, and Orgeon and
Washington are considering following suit, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:  Chris Peterson  at
