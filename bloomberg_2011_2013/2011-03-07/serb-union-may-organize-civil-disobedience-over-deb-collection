One of  Serbia ’s largest trade unions
threatened to organize “civil disobedience” if authorities
continue with forced debt collection from households that are
late in paying their utility bills.  As many as 2.3 million people in the country of 7.4 million
could be affected should the government go ahead with measures,
including seizing homes of debtors, to compensate state-run  utility companies , said Ranka Savic, head of the  Association of
Free and Independent Trade Unions . About 650,000 live below the
poverty level of 8,330 dinars ($113) a month, she said.  “Many of the people are jobless and without any income,”
said Savic at a Belgrade press conference. “They now face
losing what little property they have, even prison sentences,”
over unpaid water, gas or electricity.  The association’s 172,000 members will “organize
resistance to physically prevent any further dislodging” of
those unable to pay their bills, she said.  Savic spoke a day after Prime Minister  Mirko Cvetkovic  said
the government will negotiate with banks to offer debt
rescheduling and grace periods of up to two years for more than
900,000 people who are struggling with bank loans.  As many as 400,000 jobs were lost in the country since the
global economic crisis began, Savic said, reiterating an
estimate by the  International Monetary Fund . A consequence has
been that 30,000 people now rely on soup kitchens for food, she
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
