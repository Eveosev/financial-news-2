South African reserves climbed the
most in 11 months in February as the central bank boosted
foreign currency purchases and the dollar weakened, raising the
value of holdings in other currencies.  Gross reserves rose 4 percent to $47.3 billion in February
from the previous month, while net reserves increased 0.7
percent to $44.8 billion, the  Reserve Bank  said on its website
today.  The increase in gross reserves occurred “mainly as a
result of foreign exchange purchases by the bank and valuation
adjustments associated with the  U.S. dollar  against other major
currencies,” the Pretoria-based bank said. “Gold reserves
increased as a result of a higher price.”  The Reserve Bank stepped up foreign currency purchases
after the rand appreciated 11 percent against the dollar last
year, reducing the competitiveness of  South Africa ’s exports.
The rand has declined 4.9 percent against the dollar this year.  “We do intervene in the markets in order to build our
reserves, not to target the level of the  exchange rate ,”
Reserve Bank Governor Gill Marcus said on Feb. 23. “We do not
have a targeted reserve. We intervene as and when it is
appropriate for us to do that.”  The rand was at 7.8905 against the dollar as of 8:32 a.m.
in Johannesburg, little changed from before the release of the
reserves data.  The euro gained 0.7 percent against the dollar in February,
while the pound climbed 1.4 percent, according to Bloomberg
data.  Gold reserves rose to $5.7 billion in February from $5.3
billion the month before as the price of bullion gained 6.4
percent to average $1,413.93 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
