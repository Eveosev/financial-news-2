Pat Knight was fired as basketball
coach at  Texas Tech University , three years after taking over
from his father, Bob Knight, who holds the record for victories
at the college sport’s top level.  The 40-year-old Knight will remain on the Red Raiders’
bench for the Big 12 conference tournament this week, university
spokesman Blayne Beal said in an e-mail. He also will coach the
team in the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament,
should it qualify, Beal said.  The Red Raiders were 13-18 this season and 5-11 in the Big
12. According to the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal, Knight said
before this season that he would lose his job if the team didn’t
qualify for the NCAA tournament. He is 4-22 in his head-coaching
career against teams ranked in the ESPN/USA Today coaches poll.  Pat Knight took over at Texas Tech when Bob Knight retired
in February 2008, three years after being designated as his
father’s successor. Pat played under Bob at  Indiana University 
from 1991-1995 and had previous experience as an assistant at  Indiana , Akron and Texas Tech.  In 3 1/2 seasons, he led the team to a 50-60 record and a
berth in the 2010 National Invitation Tournament.  Bob Knight, 70, won three NCAA tournament titles and a
Division I-record 902 games in a 42-year career at the U.S.
Military Academy at  West Point , Indiana and Texas Tech. Duke’s
Mike Krzyzewski is second with 895.  Texas Tech opens the Big 12 tournament on March 9 against
the No. 22  Missouri , a team Pat Knight has never beaten as a
head coach.  To contact the reporter on this story:
