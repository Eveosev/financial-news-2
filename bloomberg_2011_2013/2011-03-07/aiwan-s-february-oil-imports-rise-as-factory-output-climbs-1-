  Taiwan , which imports more than 99
percent of its crude oil needs, purchased more of the fuel in
February as an economic recovery boosted industrial output,
spurring energy consumption.  Shipments climbed 50 percent from a year earlier to 26.1
million barrels last month, the  Ministry of Finance  said in
Taipei today. The island’s February oil bill increased 83
percent to $2.51 billion, the ministry said in a statement.  Taiwan’s industrial production increased for a 17th
straight month in January, an economic ministry report showed on
Feb. 23. The economy expanded 10.82 percent in 2010, one of the
world’s highest rates based on International Monetary Fund
estimates. The government said last month it forecasts growth of
4.92 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
