Tetsuo Yoshikoshi, a Singapore-based
senior economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp., comments on
the outlook for  India ’s rupee.  One-month non-deliverable forwards for the currency dropped
0.2 percent to 45.36 per dollar as of 11:32 a.m. in  Singapore ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts reflect
bets the rupee will decline 0.6 percent from the spot rate of
45.105.  “India is quite vulnerable to rising oil prices because it
imports, so it is negative for the rupee. We are going to see
some weakening in the currency, and it may slide to as much as
45.70 by the end of the week.  “It has been surprising that many Asian currencies
strengthened last week even with the surge in oil prices. In the
last few weeks we have seen some return of capital to the Asian
markets, including India. That is because of the relative
strength of stocks in the region.  “The surge in  oil prices  will impact the rupee
eventually.”  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
