  Heineken NV (HEIA) , the world’s third-
largest brewer, proposed an 11 percent increase in Chief
Executive Officer Jean-Francois van Boxmeer’s base salary this
year to 1.05 million euros ($1.47 million).  The pay raise is needed to bring his salary in line with
management at Heineken’s peer group of 15 companies, including  Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (ABI)  and Carlsberg A/S, the Amsterdam-based
brewer said its annual report posted on its website today. Van
Boxmeer earned 950,000 euros in base pay and 1.31 million euros
in bonuses last year.  Chief Financial Officer Rene Hooft Graafland’s base salary
will remain unchanged from last year’s 650,000 euros, according
to the annual report. Hooft Graafland’s bonus in 2011 was
670,313 euros, according to the annual report.  Shareholders will be asked to approve the 2011 salaries at
their April 21 annual meeting in Amsterdam.  To contact the reporter on this story:
