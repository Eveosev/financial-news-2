Better Place LLC, a  Palo Alto ,
California-based start-up company, plans to import 200 electric
cars to Israel in addition to 14 similar vehicles already
brought into the country in recent months,  Calcalist  said.  The Transportation Ministry already has approved the
imports in principle, the newspaper reported, without saying
