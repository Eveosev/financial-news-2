A decline in Japanese  government
bonds  since October may ease as yields approach “strong
resistance” at the 1.415 percent level, BGC Partners Inc. said,
citing trading patterns.  Yields on benchmark 10-year bonds have risen from a seven-
year low of 0.82 percent in October. They climbed to 1.35
percent on Feb. 9, the most since April when yields reached last
year’s peak of 1.405 percent.  That level is “strong resistance as it is an old high plus
a 50 percent retracement of the 2006 to 2010 high-to-low move,”
Jamie Coutts, a Singapore-based technical analyst at BGC, wrote
in an e-mail to Bloomberg.  A breach of 1.415 percent would lead to further gains to
the Fibonacci level of 1.56 percent and a larger medium-term
move back to the 1.90-2.00 percent range, according to the
analyst. The yield hasn’t been at 2 percent since May 2006.  “I will be watching this level very closely as the 1.415
also stands as an accelerator pivot point if broken,” Coutts
wrote in a research note today.  Japanese bonds rose today, sending yields on 10-year notes
down 2.5 basis points to 1.27 percent as of 3:07 p.m. in Tokyo.
The rate reached as high as 1.35 percent on Feb. 9.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
currency or index. A support level is an area on a chart where
technical analysts anticipate orders to buy a security and a
resistance level is an area there they anticipate sell orders.  Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
