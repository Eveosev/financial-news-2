German renewable energy subsidies
will drive up consumer power bills by an excess 1.5 billion
euros ($2.1 billion) this year after fewer solar panels than
predicted were installed in the country in 2010, Bild said,
citing Verivox, a website that compares tariffs.  While renewable energy aid has risen to 3.5 cents per
kilowatt-hour this year from 2.05 cents last year, it should
have only increased to 2.7 cents, the German newspaper reported,
citing the consumer website.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
