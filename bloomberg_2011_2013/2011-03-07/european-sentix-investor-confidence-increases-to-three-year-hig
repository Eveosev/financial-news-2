European investor confidence rose to
the highest level in 3 1/2 years in March as the economic
recovery gained momentum, the Sentix research institute said.  An index measuring sentiment in the 17-nation euro region
rose to 17.1 from 16.7 in February, Limburg, Germany-based
 Sentix  said in an e-mailed statement today. That’s the highest
reading since September 2007. A gauge of current business
conditions climbed to 26 from 21.25, while an indicator of
expectations fell to 8.5 from 12.25.  The  European Central Bank  last week raised its growth and
inflation forecasts and said it may increase  interest rates  in
April to curb price pressures. Sentix said the decline in the
gauge of investors’ expectations was due to the jump in oil
prices amid unrest in the Middle East and North Africa.  “Even if investors don’t see the recovery as being
endangered, they are very concerned about the current inflation
trend,” Sentix said in the statement.  A gauge of investor confidence in the U.S. rose to 17.6
from 12.6, while an index for  Asia  excluding Japan dropped to 27
from 30.3.  Sentix said 869 investors participated in its monthly
survey, which was conducted between March 3 and March 5. The
results are never revised.  To contact the reporter on this story:
