Nigeria offered less foreign
currency than demanded by lenders for a third straight auction
today, the central bank said.  The bank sold $350 million of foreign currency at an
auction today, less than the $352 million demanded by lenders,
the Abuja-based central bank said in an e-mailed statement.  Dollars were sold for between 150.68 naira and 151.06 naira
each, the bank said. The marginal rate, which is also used as
the prevailing exchange rate, was 150.68 naira compared with
150.71 naira at the previous auction held on March 2.  The currency of  Africa â€™s biggest oil producer and most
populous country depreciated for an eighth day against the
dollar, the longest streak of declines since at least March
1994, losing 0.1 percent to 154.31 naira at 6:20 p.m. in Lagos,
the commercial capital, from a close of 154.23 on March 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
