The difference in yield between
Treasury 10-year notes and inflation-indexed debt increased to
the widest since July 2008 as crude oil surged on concern  Libya ’s uprising is disrupting supply.  Thirty-year bonds dropped as the government prepared to
sell $32 billion of three-year notes tomorrow, $21 billion of
10-year securities the next day and $13 billion of the so-called
long bonds on March 10. Benchmark 10-year notes decreased as
stocks pared losses.  “Upward pressure on inflation expectations and the unrest
in the Middle East are impacting crude prices,” said  Ian Lyngen , a government bond strategist at CRT Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “All of this is consistent with the
notion that inflation is on the rise and is reflected in break-
evens.”  The difference in yields between 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader expectations
for consumer prices known as the break-even rate, increased
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 2.538
percentage points at 5:07 p.m. in New York. The spread earlier
reached 2.54 percentage points, the most since July 8, 2008.  Crude oil for April delivery rose $1.02 to $105.44 a barrel
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest closing price
since Sept. 26, 2008. The contract is up 29 percent from a year
ago. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 0.8 percent after
earlier losing as much as 1.3 percent.  Long Bond Yields  Yields on 30-year bonds climbed three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 4.62 percent, according to BGCantor
Market Data. The 4.75 percent note maturing in February 2041
decreased 14/32, or $4.38 per $1,000 face amount, to 102 1/32.  Ten-year note yields advanced two basis points to 3.50
percent. Five-year yields were little changed at 2.18 percent
after earlier dropping four basis points to 2.14 percent.  “We are reasonably optimistic that with a concession from
these levels, the 10- and 30-year should bring in ample non-
dealer interest,” said Lyngen, referring to debt buyers other
than the 20 primary dealers obligated to participate in U.S.
sales.  Five-year notes rose earlier as the  Federal Reserve 
purchased $6.6 billion in debt maturing from September 2013 to
February 2015 to support the U.S. recovery.  The central bank shouldn’t rule out asset purchases beyond
the $600 billion planned by June under the policy known as
quantitative easing because the  U.S. economy  may slow again,
Atlanta Fed President  Dennis Lockhart  today in a speech in
Arlington, Virginia.  ‘Very Cautious’  “With the information I have today, my first inclination
is to be very cautious about extending asset purchases after
June,” Lockhart said. “Given the emergence of new risks,
however, I prefer a posture of flexibility as regards policy
options.”  Economic conditions continue to justify holding the central
bank’s target rate at near zero as well as additional monetary
stimulus, Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said in congressional
testimony last week.  The Fed has so far purchased $404.2 billion in the second
round of Treasury purchases known as quantitative easing.    U.S. debt  has handed investors a 0.4 percent loss this
year, according to indexes compiled by the European Federation
of Financial Analysts Societies and Bloomberg.  Treasuries dropped last week on speculation turmoil in
North Africa and the Middle East won’t derail the recovery from
the worst economic slump since the Great Depression.  U.S. Payrolls  U.S. payrolls rose by 192,000 in February after an increase
of 63,000 in the previous month, the Labor Department reported
March 4. The  unemployment rate  unexpectedly dropped to 8.9
percent, the lowest level since April 2009.  Relying on spending cuts alone to reduce the U.S. federal
government’s budget and debt “likely is politically and
practically unachievable,” according to a Bloomberg Government
study released today.  The study projects the debt will reach 84.9 percent of
gross domestic product by 2020 and forecasts the government will
spend $44.5 trillion from 2011 through 2020, requiring $10.4
trillion in additional borrowing.  Investors outside the U.S. have boosted their holdings of
longer-maturity Treasuries to the highest level since credit
markets froze in 2008, helping to curb rising yields amid
concern inflation is accelerating.  International buyers held 90 percent of their $4.44
trillion of  U.S. government debt  in notes and bonds as of
December, the same as in September 2008, when Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. collapsed,  Treasury data  released last week show.
The ratio dropped to 83 percent in October 2009 as investors
sought the safety of Treasury bills with the U.S. economic
recovery still in question.  To contact the reporter on this story:
