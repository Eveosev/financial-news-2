  China ’s benchmark money-market rate
fell to a three-month low as maturing debt adds cash to the
banking system.  There will be 687 billion yuan ($105 billion) of fixed-
income securities coming due in March,  Frances Cheung , a senior
strategist at Credit Agricole CIB in Hong Kong, and Liu Junyu, a
bond analyst at China Merchants Bank Co., said last week. The
People’s Bank of China pumped in 103 billion yuan of funds
through open-market operations in the five days ended March 3,
the most since January, official data show.  “The lower seven-day repo fixing is supported by heavy
redemptions in coming weeks,” said Wee-Khoon Chong, a fixed-
income strategist at Societe Generale SA in  Hong Kong .  The seven-day repurchase rate, a gauge measuring the
availability of funds, dropped four basis points to 2.18 percent,
according to a daily fixing from the National Interbank Funding
Center published at 11 a.m. in  Shanghai . That’s the lowest level
since Dec. 7.  The one-year swap contract tied to the seven-day repo rate
fell for a third day, dropping three basis points to 3.72
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The yield on
the government’s 3.77 percent bond due December 2020 declined
one basis point to 3.95 percent, according to Chinabond, the
nation’s biggest debt-clearing house.  Inflation Data  Premier  Wen Jiabao  said March 5 at the National People’s
Congress in Beijing that fighting inflation is China’s top
economic priority, and confirmed a full-year target of 4 percent.
A report on March 11 may show consumer prices rose 4.8 percent
in February from a year earlier, after a 4.9 percent gain the
previous month that was the fastest since August 2008, according
to a Bloomberg survey of 22 economists.  “The anticipated lower February CPI print is only expected
to be temporary before moving back higher in March,” said Chong.
“We believe China is still firmly on its way for further
tightening in policy, with a hike to come next week after the
end of the annual plenary next Tuesday.”  The People’s Bank of China last ordered banks to set aside
more money as reserves on Feb. 24, raising the ratio by half a
percentage point to 19.5 percent. Policy makers may lift the
reserve requirement again this week, wrote  Credit Agricole ’s
Cheung in a research note today.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
