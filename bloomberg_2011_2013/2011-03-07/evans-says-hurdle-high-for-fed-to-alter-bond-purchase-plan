President  Charles Evans  said the hurdle for altering the Fed’s
current $600 billion Treasury purchase plan is “high,” and
that a tapering of the purchases is unlikely.  “It looks more and more to me like $600 billion is a good
number,” Evans, 53, said today in an interview today with CNBC.
“I continue to think the hurdle is pretty high” for changing
the program and “we’re going to continue to need short-term  interest rates  to be low for an extended period of time.”  Rising oil prices are a “headwind for the real economy”
and yet shouldn’t lead to higher underlying inflation, said
Evans, who votes on the Federal Open Market Committee this year.
The  unemployment rate , which fell to 8.9 percent in February, is
“a very welcome sign” and a “signal that the labor market is
improving,” he said.  Treasury markets are “so deep and liquid that there
doesn’t seem to be a need” to taper the purchases, Evans said.
He has led the Chicago Fed since September 2007 and is one of
only two regional Fed presidents who vote every other year,
along with Cleveland Fed President  Sandra Pianalto .  “I wouldn’t be surprised that if we decide to end it, we
just end it,” he said, referring to the purchase plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
