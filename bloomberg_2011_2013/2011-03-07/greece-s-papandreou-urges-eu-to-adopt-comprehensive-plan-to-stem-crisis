     March 8 (Bloomberg) --Greek Prime Minister George
Papandreou said the European Union needs to adopt a
comprehensive package on debt issues this month that will
convince markets and stem the crisis.   “Without a doubt, on our side there is a demand to
strictly keep to our goals and our commitments,” Papandreou
told his ministers in Athens late yesterday, according to an
emailed transcript of his statements. “And there is on the side
of the EU as a whole the responsibility to create a safe
environment for the euro, and subsequently for the management of
debt, to convince markets.”  This requires a comprehensive package or there will be no
solution, he said. Whatever decision is taken this month,  Greece 
will continue to implement its fiscal adjustment program as debt
“even if more manageable, will still exist and be high,” he
said.   He said yesterday’s downgrade by Moody’s Investors Services
was unjustified.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
