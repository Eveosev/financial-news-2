(Corrects spelling of  Australia  in headline.)  The Australian dollar held losses
from the past three days as the climb in oil prices to a 29-
month high spurred concern global economic growth may slow.    New Zealand ’s dollar was 0.5 percent from the lowest level
since September versus the yen after data showed the South
Pacific nation’s budget deficit in the seven months through
January was wider than forecast. The so-called Aussie was
supported by a report showing business confidence was at the
highest level in almost a year.  “The Aussie has been lagging behind other commodity-
related currencies such as the krone and Canadian dollar,” said
Teppei Ino, an analyst at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. “As
Australia is an importer of oil, it doesn’t profit from surging  oil prices .”  Australia’s currency fetched $1.0129 as of 12:24 p.m. in
Sydney from $1.0119 in  New York  yesterday. It bought 83.37 yen
from 83.21 yen. The Aussie was at 72.52 euro cents from 72.44
yesterday, when it dropped to 72.10, the lowest since Nov. 22.  The  New Zealand dollar  was at 73.75 U.S. cents from 73.69.
The currency traded at 60.70 yen from 60.60 yen yesterday, when
it touched 60.35 yen, the weakest level since Sept. 9.  Crude oil for April delivery gained to $105.44 a barrel on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest settlement since
Sept. 26, 2008. The contract is up 29 percent from a year ago.  The  Reserve Bank  of Australia will leave its key rate at
4.75 percent at its next meeting on April 5, according to all of
17 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. Swaps traders are
betting on a 32-basis-point increase over the next 12 months,
down from 47 basis points a month ago, according to a Credit
Suisse AG index.  Confidence Index  National Australia Bank Ltd. said today its confidence
index advanced to 14 in February, the highest since March 2010,
from 4 a month earlier. The gauge was based on a survey of more
than 540 companies from Feb. 21-25.  New Zealand’s  Treasury Department  said today the cash
shortfall was NZ$10.15 billion ($7.5 billion) in the seven
months ended Jan. 31, or NZ$80 million wider than forecast in a
December fiscal update as a slowing economy curbed  tax revenue .  The  Reserve Bank of New Zealand  holds its next policy
meeting in Wellington on March 10. Ten of 14 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News predict the RBNZ will cut the official cash
rate, now at 3 percent, by at least 25 basis points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
