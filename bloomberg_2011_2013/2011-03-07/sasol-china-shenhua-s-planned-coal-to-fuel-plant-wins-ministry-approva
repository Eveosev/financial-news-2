  Sasol Ltd. (SOL) ’s planned coal-to-liquids
project with China Shenhua Group Corp., set to become the
nation’s biggest such facility, received approval from the
Chinese environmental ministry, according to a list on the
ministry’s website today.  Johannesburg-based Sasol halted development of the $10
billion plant because it was awaiting state approval, the
company said in an e-mailed statement in February. The project
requires final approval from the National Development and Reform
Commission, China’s highest economic planning body.  Sasol and Shenhua submitted an application to the NDRC in
2009 to build a 94,000 barrel-a-day plant to convert coal into
motor fuel in the Ningxia Hui autonomous region. Sasol expected
a review to be completed on Aug. 24 and said the commission was
poised to make its recommendations to the nation’s energy
administrator by the end of 2010.  In 2008, Sasol aborted a plan to build another facility in
Shaanxi province as  China  curbed investment in energy-intensive
industries. The company operates the world’s largest coal-to-
fuels plant at Secunda in  South Africa , where it converts more
than 40 million metric tons of the raw material annually.  Shenhua is China’s only producer of fuels from coal and the
nation’s largest coal supplier. Shares in its listed unit, China
Shenhua Energy Co., rose the most in more than two years in  Shanghai  today after it won approval to develop a field in
northern China that may boost annual output by 45 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
