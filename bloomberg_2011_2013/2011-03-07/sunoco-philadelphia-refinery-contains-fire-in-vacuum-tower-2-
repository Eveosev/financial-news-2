  Sunoco Inc. (SUN)  has contained a fire at
in a vacuum tower at its Philadelphia refinery, according to
Carl Grynes, a chief with the city fire department.  The unit has been isolated, according to Grynes. There have
been no injuries, according to an e-mailed notification from the
city of Philadelphia.  “Sunoco emergency response personnel have responded to a
fire at the Philadelphia refinery,” according to a  statement  on
the company’s website. As of 3:15 p.m. local time the fire was
under control and no injuries had been reported, according to
the statement.  Sunoco will shut a fluid catalytic cracker at the refinery
for unscheduled repairs that may last several weeks, Thomas Golembeski, a company spokesman, said in an e-mail earlier
today. He didn’t say when the unit would be shut.  Sunoco planned to idle a reformer and other units later
this month for work, two people with knowledge of the plans said
last month.  The work is scheduled to last several weeks, said one of
the people who declined to be identified because the information
isn’t public.  The refinery has a capacity of 355,000 barrels a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Aaron Clark  in New York at
