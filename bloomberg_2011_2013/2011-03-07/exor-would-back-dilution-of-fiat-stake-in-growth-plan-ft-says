  Exor SpA (EXO)  Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer John Elkann would support a dilution of the
company’s 30 percent stake in Fiat SpA as part of a plan to
expand Fiat “into a bigger business,” the Financial Times
reported, citing an interview with Elkann.  Exor, the Agnelli family’s investment company, may look
into selling its Italian tourism company Alpitour SpA “if a
good situation presents itself,” Elkann also said, according to
the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
