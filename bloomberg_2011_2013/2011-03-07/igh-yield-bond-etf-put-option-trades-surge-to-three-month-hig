Put volume on an exchange-traded
fund tracking high yield bonds rose to its highest level since
November after a single trade with a strike price 3.9 percent
below today’s close.  An investor bought a block of 4,000 April $39 puts to sell
the  SPDR Barclays Capital High Yield Bond ETF (JNK)  for 15 cents each
at 11:35 a.m. in New York, according to a report from options
strategists at Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP in  Bala Cynwyd ,  Pennsylvania , and data compiled by Bloomberg.  Almost 4,600 puts changed hands today, more than 10 times
the four-week average and 228 times the number of calls to buy.
The April $39 puts were the most-active contracts and accounted
for more than nine-tenths of all options volume. The ETF, which
rose 0.2 percent to $40.57 today, has an average of 439 puts and
99 calls trading each day. The ETF gained 3.4 percent in the
past year.  The extra yield investors demand to own high-yield, high-
risk bonds instead of Treasuries with similar maturities has
narrowed from as much as 19.71 percentage points on December
2008 to 4.51 percentage points last week, according to Barclays
Plc’s BarCap US Corporate High Yield Average OAS index. The
spread over Treasuries reached 4.36 percentage points on Feb. 8,
the tightest since October 2007.  Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the
right to sell. Investors use options to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities they own, speculate on
share-price moves or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will
rise or fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
