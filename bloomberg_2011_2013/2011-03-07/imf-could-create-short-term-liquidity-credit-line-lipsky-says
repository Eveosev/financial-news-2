The  International Monetary Fund 
could create a new credit line to respond to short-term
liquidity needs as part of its efforts to support countries
before crises develop, the institution’s no. 2 official said.  “Uncertainty over financial safety nets can impose
significant costs,”  John Lipsky  told a conference of economists
and officials in Washington today. “It might be better to
create a more predictable system of international liquidity
support.”  The Washington-based IMF has been assisting the Group of 20
nations in trying to build a safety net to help contain economic
turmoil and avoid contagion. The fund now has two types of
precautionary credit lines for countries with strong economies
facing external risks.  The potential “short-term liquidity type facility” could
be “created on a standing basis or embedded in a possible
global stability mechanism that would be activated at times of
systemic stress,” said Lipsky, the IMF’s first deputy managing
director.  To contact the reporter on this story:
