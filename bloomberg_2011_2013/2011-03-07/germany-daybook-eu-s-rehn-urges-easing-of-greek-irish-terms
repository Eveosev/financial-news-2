Euro-area governments should ease
the bailout terms for Greece and Ireland as they discuss ways to
end the debt crisis, European Union monetary chief Olli Rehn was
cited as saying by Handelsblatt.  While  Chancellor Angela Merkel  is skeptical about easing
bailout conditions, Rehn said there’s a risk that both countries
are being overstretched by too-strict loan conditions, the
newspaper reported.  EQUITIES:
