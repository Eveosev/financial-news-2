  Colombia ’s peso bonds jumped,
pushing yields down the most since November, after a government
report showed inflation trailed forecasts in February.  The yield on the benchmark 11 percent bonds due July 2020
fell 10 basis points, or 0.10 percentage point, to 8.22 percent
at 1:01 p.m. New York time, according to Colombia’s stock
exchange. That’s its biggest decline since Nov. 24. The bond’s
price advanced 0.703 centavo to 117.626 centavos per peso.  The inflation data damped concern that Colombia’s worst
flooding in three decades would cause a spike in food costs that
would spill over into other goods. Consumer prices rose 0.6
percent in February from the previous month, the government said
March 5, trailing the median estimate for a 1.03 percent
increase among 25 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Inflation surprised the market,” said Daniel Nino, head
analyst at Bogota-based Bancolombia SA, the country’s biggest
bank. “Investors are buying fixed-rate bonds and dropping”
inflation-linked peso securities, known as TES UVR, Nino said.  The gap between yields on TES UVR due 2013 and similar-
maturity fixed-rate debt, a gauge of annual consumer price
increase expectations known as the breakeven rate, dropped to
376 basis points today from 423 on March 4. The spread touched
473 on Jan. 7 during the worst of the deadly floods that swamped
crops and destroyed roads, the widest since March 2010. Consumer
prices rose 3.17 percent in February from a year ago.  Still, growing domestic demand and rising oil prices will
likely cause faster inflation later this year, according to
Nino. Crude oil has gained 15 percent since the end of 2010.  ‘Reassuring’  “Slowing inflation doesn’t convince yet,” Nino said.
“Given the economic recovery and what we’ve been seeing in oil,
we may see inflation start to rise again.”  Nino forecasts the benchmark peso bonds due 2020 will trade
at a yield between 8 percent and 8.30 percent this month.  Annual inflation will likely end this year at 3.4 percent,
according to Nino. The central bank targets inflation between 2
percent and 4 percent this year.  Colombia’s inflation numbers are “reassuring,” Barclays
Capital economist  Jimena Zuniga  wrote in a report today. “ All
this should provide some comfort to the central bank. However,
the surprise should not be interpreted as an input discouraging
Banco de la Republica to continue normalizing rates.”  The central bank raised the overnight lending rate by 25
basis points to 3.25 percent last month.  Zuniga forecasts Banco de la Republica will increase the
key rate to 5.5 percent by year-end while Bancolombia’s Nino
predicts the rate will end 2011 at 4 percent.  Colombia’s peso fell 0.1 percent to 1,895.60 per  U.S.
dollar  today, from 1,894.40 on March 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
