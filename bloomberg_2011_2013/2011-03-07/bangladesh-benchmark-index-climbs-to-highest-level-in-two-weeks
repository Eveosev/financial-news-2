  Bangladesh  stocks gained for a third
day, taking the benchmark index to the highest level in almost
two weeks, as an investment fund set up by state-run
organizations boosted investor confidence.  The DSE General Index advanced 4.4 percent to 5,779.9 as of
the 3 p.m. close in Dhaka, according to the bourse’s  website .
That’s its highest level since Feb. 24. The  Investment
Corporation of Bangladesh , along with seven other state-owned
banks and companies, will invest 50 billion taka ($700 million)
in the country’s stock and money markets, according to a  report 
in today’s Daily Star newspaper.  “This is a comfort to the local investors,” said Saiful
Islam, managing director of Dhaka-based BRAC EPL Stock Brokerage
Ltd. “People have started believing that the government is
serious and that it has an interest to revive the markets.”  The DSE index has fallen 30 percent this year, with trading
being halted at least twice, after the central bank raised
lenders’ cash reserve ratio to limit their stock investments.  Food inflation in January reached a 30-month high of 11.91
percent, from 11 percent in December, the  Daily Star   reported 
yesterday. Food prices in the country have been climbing since
November, according to the newspaper. The Bangladesh Nationalist
Party called a nationwide strike last month to protest higher
prices and the slide in stocks.  “We are net importers of food items and food prices are
going up everywhere in the world. It’s a global issue,” said
Islam. “However, the government is doing everything possible to
make sure that inflation is kept under control.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
