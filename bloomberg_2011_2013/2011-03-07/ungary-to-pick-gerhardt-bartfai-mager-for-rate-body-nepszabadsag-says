Andrea Bartfai-Mager and Ferenc Gerhardt will be nominated today to fill two of four vacancies
in the seven-member rate-setting Monetary Council, Nepszabadsag
said citing Antal Rogan, the nominating committee’s chairman.  Gerhardt was a former central bank vice president while
Bartfai-Mager was a former assistant managing director at the
Magyar Nemzeti Bank, the daily newspaper said.  “We want to avoid even the appearance that anyone is
wanting to put pressure on the work of the Council,” said the
ruling party’s Rogan, according to Nepszabadsag.  Parliament’s Economy Committee, chaired by Rogan, will
officialy make the nominations at a session starting at 9:30
a.m. in Budapest. The full legislature, dominated by Prime
Minister  Viktor Orban ’s governing Fidesz party, is scheduled to
vote on the nominations later today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
