  Barclays Plc (BARC)  gave  Robert Diamond  as
much as 10.1 million pounds ($16.5 million) in salary, bonuses
and stock, making him the U.K.’s top-paid bank chief executive
officer as the government presses lenders to curb remuneration.  Diamond was awarded a 6.5 million-pound bonus for 2010 and
a further 2.25 million pounds depending on the lender’s
performance, London-based Barclays said in a statement today.
His base salary will rise to 1.35 million pounds from 250,000
pounds after he became CEO on Jan. 1.  The government is pushing banks to curb pay after it was
forced to bail out the industry during the credit crisis and as
it enacts the deepest-ever reductions in public spending.
Diamond, 59, told lawmakers last month that his bank, which
didn’t receive direct government aid, would exercise restraint
when paying bonuses and that was time for firms to end “the
period of remorse and apology” and start boosting confidence.  “Diamond tries to convince taxpayers that the era of
remorse and regret within banking is over, yet he has no shame
in pocketing a seven-figure bonus,” Unite trade union General
Secretary Len McCluskey said in a statement today. “There is no
possible justification for this highly paid individual taking
home this enormous windfall.”  Biggest Bonus  Diamond’s bonus exceeds those of his counterparts at Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc, Lloyds Banking Group Plc and  HSBC
Holdings Plc. (HSBA)  HSBC,  Europe ’s biggest bank, paid CEO  Stuart Gulliver  a 2.9 million-pound bonus for 2010, RBS awarded CEO
Stephen Hester a 2 million-pound all-stock bonus, Lloyds CEO  Eric Daniels  received 1.45 million pounds.  Diamond’s bonus lags behind U.S. competitors: Jamie Dimon,
CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co., was awarded $17.4 million in
restricted stock for 2010, according to a Feb. 17 filing with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., the securities firm that set a Wall Street pay record in
2007, gave Chairman and CEO Lloyd Blankfein a $12.6 million
stock bonus for 2010.    John Varley , Diamond’s predecessor as CEO, received total
compensation of 3.85 million pounds, including a 2.2 million-
pound bonus, Barclays said. He was paid 1.1 million pounds for
2009 and didn’t take a bonus. Finance Director  Chris Lucas 
received 2.56 million pounds in salary and bonuses, compared
with 2.15 million pounds in 2009, the statement said.  Barclays said its highest-paid executive who isn’t an
executive director was awarded 14.3 million pounds, including
shares and awards of contingent capital. The second-highest paid
may receive as much about 14 million pounds, the bank said.  Barclays’s employee benefit trust purchased about 1.02
million pounds of shares for Jerry del Missier, who jointly
oversees its investment bank with  Rich Ricci . The trust
purchased about 992,000 pounds of shares for Ricci. Neither are
executive directors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
