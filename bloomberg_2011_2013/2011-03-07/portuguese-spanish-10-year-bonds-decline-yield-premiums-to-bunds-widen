Portuguese, Spanish and Italian 10-
year bonds declined, increasing the additional yield investors
demand to hold the securities instead of benchmark German bunds.  The yield on 10-year Portugese securities rose seven basis
points to 7.53 percent as of 9:01 a.m. in  London . That widened
the yield premium over bunds to 426 basis points.  Spanish 10-year yields rose three basis points to 5.42
percent and the yield on similar-maturity Italian securities
increased four basis points to 4.92 percent. Irish 10-year
yields climbed two basis points to 9.40 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
