Options volume on an exchange-traded
fund tracking  oil prices  was above average for both puts and
calls, boosted by one bearish trade as oil surged to a 29-month
high amid escalating violence in  Libya .  A block of 25,000 April $38 puts to sell the  United States
Oil Fund LP (USO)  traded for 64 cents each at 9:46 a.m. in New York,
while 12,500 April $41 puts changed hands for $1.71 apiece at
the same time, in a trade known as a spread. The April $38 puts
had an open interest of 12,921 before today, and the April $41
put open interest was 5,617.  “Today’s spread trader might be looking for a pullback in
crude or possibly to protect recent gains in the oil fund,”
said Frederic Ruffy, senior options strategist at
WhatsTrading.com, a New York-based provider of options-market
analytics.  Crude oil for April delivery increased $1.02 to $105.44 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest
settlement since Sept. 26, 2008, after fighting between Libyan
rebels and troops loyal to  Muammar Qaddafi  intensified.  Hedge
funds  raised purchases of futures to a record for a second week
on speculation unrest will cut output further. Citigroup Inc.
increased its Brent oil price estimate, saying the threat of
more disruptions supports a “fear premium.”  Almost 116,600 puts traded today, 1.7 times the four-week
average. The April $38 puts and April $41 puts, which were the
most-active options, accounted for more than one-third of all
put volume. More than 201,600 calls traded. The ETF gained 0.1
percent to $42.37, and has risen 20 percent from a 12-week low
on Feb. 15.  The ETF’s implied volatility, the key gauge of option
prices, for at-the-money options expiring in 30 days jumped to
43.18 today, the highest since July, from 41.48 on March 4.  Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the
right to sell. Investors use options to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities they own, speculate on
share-price moves or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will
rise or fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
