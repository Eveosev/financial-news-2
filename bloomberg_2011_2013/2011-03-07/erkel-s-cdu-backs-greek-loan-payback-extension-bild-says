German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s  Christian Democratic Union  is ready to give  Greece  more time to
repay its emergency loans,  Volker Kauder , chairman of the
party’s parliamentary group, told  Bild Zeitung  newspaper.  The CDU’s backing of an extension of the loan repayment
period is linked to Greece’s commitment to continue its
“radical savings and reforms,” Bild quoted Kauder as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
