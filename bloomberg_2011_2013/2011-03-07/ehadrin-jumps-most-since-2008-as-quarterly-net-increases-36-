(Corrects dividend amount in last paragraph.)    Mehadrin Ltd. (MEDN)  surged the most in
more than two years after the Israeli grower of citrus fruit
reported a 36 percent increase in fourth-quarter net income.  The shares surged 13 percent, the biggest gain since
January 2009, to 126.10 shekels at the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel
Aviv, giving the Beerot Itzhak, Israel-based company a market
value of 419.3 million shekels ($117 million).  Net income rose to 16.6 million shekels from 12.2 million
shekels a year earlier, the company said today in a  statement  to
the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. Separately, Mehadrin declared an
aggregate dividend of 49.9 million shekels, payable April 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
