  Indonesia ’s rupiah gained, trading
at a three-year high, on speculation the central bank will
tolerate gains to manage inflation. Bonds declined.    Bank Indonesia  kept its key lending rate unchanged at 6.75
percent on March 4, saying that it will allow the rupiah to
appreciate to control imported inflation. Consumer prices in
Southeast Asia’s biggest economy rose 6.84 percent in February
from a year earlier, compared with 7.02 percent in January, a
report showed last week. Oil increased to $105.78 a barrel, near
a 29-month high, as the conflict in Libya showed no signs of
abating.  “Bank Indonesia has been tolerant of the rupiah
strengthening to control inflation,” said  Gundy Cahyadi , a
Singapore-based economist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp.
“There is concern on the oil front as that could potentially
impact the economy.”  The rupiah advanced 0.1 percent to at 8,784 per dollar as
of 4:21 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency earlier touched 8,780, the strongest level since
June 2007.  Ten-year  government bonds  fell, snapping a five day gain.
The yield on the 8.25 percent note due July 2021 climbed four
basis points to 8.54 percent, according to closing prices from
the Inter-Dealer Market Association. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
