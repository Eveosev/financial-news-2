that higher fuel costs will damp the economic recovery.    Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. (293) , Hong Kong’s No. 1 airline,

airline by market capitalization, lost 3.9 percent. China

offshore oil producer, increased 1.5 percent. BaWang

“There’s an element of uncertainty in the Middle East which
obviously the market doesn’t like. There’s no real clarity as to
what’s happening.”  The  Hang Seng  Index slid 0.4 percent to 23,313.19 at the

0.4 percent. About four stocks declined for each that advanced

percent today. The index slipped 0.7 percent on March 4 in  New
York  as crude oil prices rose to a 29-month high, after fighting
in Libya cut crude oil production in the African country by as

prices will crimp U.S. consumer spending.  Higher crude prices damped the profit outlook for airlines.
Cathay Pacific slumped 3.5 percent to HK$17.66. Air China sank
3.9 percent to HK$7.15 even after its Chairman Kong Dong said
its profit improved “significantly” in 2010. China Eastern

profit may fall this year because of higher fuel prices.  Oil producers gained.  Cnooc Ltd. (883) , China’s biggest offshore

0.4 percent to HK$14.24. Tsingtao Brewery Co., a Chinese beer
company, rose 0.9 percent to HK$38.50.  China’s Domestic Demand  “Expanding domestic demand is a long-term strategic
principle,” Premier  Wen Jiabao  said in his state-of-the-nation
report to the annual meeting of the National People’s Congress
on March 5. Subsidies for urban low-income earners and farmers,
plus continued incentives for rural purchases of home appliances,
may boost spending, he said.  The Hang Seng rose 1.7 percent last week as positive U.S.
economic data eased concern surging oil prices and tensions in
the Middle East will hamper global growth. Shares in the gauge
