Anschutz Entertainment Group Inc.
sent a letter to  Los Angeles  officials seeking to start the
approval process for Farmers Field, the companyâ€™s proposed
National Football League stadium.  Anschutz Entertainment and city officials plan to hold the
first environmental review meeting on March 30 at the Los
Angeles Convention Center, the promoter and stadium operator
owned by billionaire Philip Anschutz said in the letter.  The review process is the first step in securing approvals
for a $1 billion, 65,000-seat stadium aimed at luring an NFL
franchise to Los Angeles. Tim Leiweke, president and chief
executive officer of closely held Anschutz, has promised to
build a stadium in downtown Los Angeles and rebuild a portion of
the convention center without city money. The company set a goal
in the letter of having a full environmental report ready by
year-end.  An environmental review process is used to determine the
impact and mitigation measures required for certain
developments. In the letter, Los Angeles-based Anschutz says it
expects issues to involve parking, public transportation and use
of renewable power and resources.  To contact the reporter on this story:
