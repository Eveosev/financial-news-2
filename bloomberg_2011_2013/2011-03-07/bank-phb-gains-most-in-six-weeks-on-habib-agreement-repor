  Bank PHB Plc (PLATINUM) , a Nigerian lender
bailed out two years ago by the  central bank , gained the most in
more than six weeks after BusinessDay reported it signed a
memorandum of understanding with Habib Bank to take a stake.  The stock gained 7 kobo, or 4.8 percent, the most since
Jan. 20, to close at 1.54 naira by 2:30 p.m. in Lagos.  “We have a preferred core investor and talks are going
on,” Joe Mbulu, a spokesman for Bank PHB, said by phone from
Lagos today, while declining to comment on the report.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  fired the chief executive
officers of eight of the country’s 24 lenders in 2009, after a
debt crisis threatened the industry with collapse, and bailed
out the sector with 620 billion naira ($4 billion). Bank PHB was
one of the beneficiaries of the bailout.  Bank PHB has fallen 12 percent this year, compared with a
1.9 percent gain for the Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share Index
in the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
