Syrian President Bashar al-Assad laid
the first stone of a $2.1 billion irrigation project on the
Tigris River today, the  Syrian Arab News Agency  said.  The project will pump 1.25 billion cubic meters (330
billion gallons) of Tigris water to irrigate some 200,000
hectares (770 square miles) of land in the northeastern
governorate of Hassakeh, it said. It will provide 125 million
cubic meters of potable water a year to the region, it said. The
agency did not give a time for the completion of the project.    Syria ’s eastern region is home to the country’s oil, gas,
wheat and cotton industries. The region was hit by severe
droughts over the last few years. Syria and  Turkey  set the first
stone for a dam capable of storing 115 million cubic meters of
water on the Orontes River on their borders on Feb. 6.  To contact the reporters on this story:
