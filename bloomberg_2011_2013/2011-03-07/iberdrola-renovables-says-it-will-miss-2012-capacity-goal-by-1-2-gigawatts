  Iberdrola Renovables SA (IBR) , the biggest
producer of clean energy, will miss its target for 2012
generating capacity by more than 1.2 gigawatts, a company
spokesman said.  Iberdrola Renovables will fall short of its 16-gigawatt
goal after deciding to limit investments in the U.S. where
rising supplies of shale gas are damping electricity costs, the
spokesman who asked not to be named in line with company
practice said today.  Iberdrola Renovables last week fell 1.7 percent after Chief
Executive Officer Xabier Viteri said the company will curb
investments in the world’s biggest economy. The company, which
had 12.5 gigawatts installed at the end of last year, will add
1.45 gigawatts of capacity this year and 750 megawatts in 2012
compared with an average 1.8 gigawatts of new generators in each
of the past three years, Viteri said at an investors’ briefing.  “They took the opportunity to reduce expectations on
investment in 2011 and 2012 again at Iberdrola Renovables while
maintaining the financial projections,” Nicolas Fernandez, an
analyst at Grupo Banc Sabadell, said in a research note.  The company aims to increase its profit by more than 10
percent by the end of next year, Viteri said.  The price of natural gas fell 21 percent on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  last year as the supply of the fuel from
U.S. shale fields rose.  To contact the reporter on this story:
