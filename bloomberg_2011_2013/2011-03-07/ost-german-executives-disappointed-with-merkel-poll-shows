Most German managers say Chancellor  Angela Merkel  has failed to meet the expectations they had after
the 2009 election,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing a poll it
commissioned.  Seventy-two percent said they were disappointed with Merkel
while a quarter said her rule has met their expectations.  Managers critical of Merkel said she has lacks leadership
and vision and keeps good people in her party down. Those who
praised Merkel said she’s getting things her way, has a sense of
power, is analytical and far-sighted, the poll showed.  Psephos interviewed 685 top managers between Feb. 22 and
March 4, Handelsblatt said. It didn’t provide a margin of error.  To contact the reporter on this story:
