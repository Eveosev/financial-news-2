  Sasol Ltd. (SOL) , the largest producer of
motor fuels made from coal, will meet with partners this month
to decide whether to proceed with a final study on a plant in
Uzbekistan to convert natural gas into motor fuels such as
diesel.  Sasol, Petroliam Nasional Bhd and national  oil company 
Uzbekneftegaz will discuss whether to do an engineering study of
the project over about 18 months, according to Lean Strauss,
Sasol’s senior group executive for new business development.
Sasol hasn’t indicated the cost of the project.  “The next phase will be a strong indication as to whether
we’ll go ahead with the project or not,” Strauss said in an
interview in Johannesburg today.  Sasol,  South Africa ’s largest company by sales and market
value, uses proprietary Fischer-Tropsch technology to make
gasoline, diesel and jet fuel from coal or gas. Sasol is
accelerating gas-based projects ahead of its traditional coal-
to-fuels investments, betting gas-fed operations will be more
profitable.  The Uzbekistan project “because of its location will be
more expensive” than the company’s Qatari plant, which would
cost $2 billion and $2.5 billion if built today, Strauss said.
Equipment would have to be transported through two countries as
Uzbekistan doesn’t have a seaport, he said. Uzbekneftegaz would
supply the gas from an inland reserve, he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
