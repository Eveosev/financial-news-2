The U.K. may be able to invest 73
percent less money in clean energy than forecast and still meet
its 2020 goal for curbing emissions, said Paradigm Change
Capital Partners LLP.  Meeting the targets may require investments of 54 billion
pounds ($88 billion), including spending to improve energy
efficiency of houses, according to a report e-mailed today by
Paradigm, a London financial-services  firm specializing in
renewable energy  and commodities.  “Barring any unforeseen developments, there is a strong
likelihood of having a condensed requirement for capital between
2013 and 2015,” a prospect that could create a “serious
burden” for power companies and electricity-grid operators, the
company reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
