rupees, the nation’s market regulator said.  Foreigners purchased 26.95 billion rupees of shares and
sold 20.7 billion rupees, the  Securities and Exchange Board of
India  said on its website  today . They bought a net 4.6 billion
rupees of bonds, taking total purchases in debt this year to
131.7 billion rupees.  Global investors, attracted by  India ’s economic expansion,
bought a record 1.33 trillion rupees of shares in 2010, lifting
the benchmark index 17 percent and making it the best performer
among the world’s 10 biggest equity markets. They invested 464
billion rupees in bonds last year.  Foreign funds have placed 4.39 trillion rupees in equities
