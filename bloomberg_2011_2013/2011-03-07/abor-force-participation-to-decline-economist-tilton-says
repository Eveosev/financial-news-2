Shifting demographics suggest there
will be fewer workers competing for job openings in the U.S.,
said economist Andrew Tilton, a managing director at Goldman,
Sachs & Co. in  New York .  “The long-term trend in labor force participation is
down,” Tilton said. “You do have the baby boom generation
retiring.” Over the shorter term, “the labor market is
improving significantly,” Tilton said today in a radio
interview on “Bloomberg Surveillance” with Tom Keene.  In February, the  unemployment rate  declined to 8.9 percent
-- the lowest in almost two years -- and the economy added
192,000 jobs, according to Labor Department statistics released
March 4. The labor force participation rate was unchanged at
64.2 percent last month.  “We’ve come off a period when there were a number of
factors that were slowing employment growth,” including severe
winter weather in many parts of the county, Tilton said in the
interview.  (In the U.S., hear Bloomberg Radio on satellite radio: Sirius
