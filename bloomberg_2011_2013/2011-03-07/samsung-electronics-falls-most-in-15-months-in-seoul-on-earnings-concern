Samsung Electronics Co. fell the
most in 15 months in Seoul stock trading on speculation first-
quarter earnings will fall short of estimates, according to an
analyst at Shinhan Investment Corp.  Samsung Electronics,  Asia ’s biggest maker of chips, flat
screens and mobile phones, lost 4.1 percent to 906,000 won at
the 3 p.m. close on the Korea Exchange, the biggest drop since
Nov. 27, 2009. The benchmark  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  fell 1.2 percent.  “There’s market speculation that the company’s first-
quarter earnings will be smaller than expected, largely driven
by a weak display business,” Kim Young Chan, an analyst at
Seoul-based Shinhan Investment said by phone today. Operating
profit may be between 3.1 trillion won ($2.8 billion) and 3.2
trillion won, compared with the consensus analyst estimate of
3.5 trillion won, Kim said.  Jason Kim, a Samsung spokesman, declined to comment.
Samsung Electronics typically reports earnings the month after a
quarter ends.  -- Editors: Darren Boey, Richard Frost  To contact the reporter on this story:
