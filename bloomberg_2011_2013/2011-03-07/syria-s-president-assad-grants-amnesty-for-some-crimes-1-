President Bashar al-Assad granted
amnesty to some people convicted of certain crimes, the official
Syrian Arab News Agency reported.  The amnesty applies to some criminals who committed
misdemeanors, juveniles, those who are now 70 or older, people
who have incurable diseases, as well as others who avoided
military service.  The regime in  Syria  “does this regularly and the amnesty
today doesn’t apply to political activists who are imprisoned,”
Nadim Houry, Lebanon’s director for New York-based  Human Rights
Watch , said in a telephone interview in  Beirut .  An exception may be made in the case of  Haitham Maleh , 80,
a former judge, human rights activist and lawyer who could be
released on grounds of age under the amnesty, Houry said. Maleh
is serving a three-year prison sentence imposed last year after
he took part in a show on a Syrian opposition news channel and
made remarks deemed critical of the government.  There are no precise estimates on the number of political
prisoners in Syria, Houry said, though  Human Rights Watch  has
documented the arrest of at least 102 political and human rights
activists in Syria since Assad came to power in 2000.  “The actual number is much higher, given that it is hard
to obtain information about the detention of less prominent
political activists, especially Kurds and Islamists,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
