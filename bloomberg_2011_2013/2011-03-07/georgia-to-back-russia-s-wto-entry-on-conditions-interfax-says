Georgia will support  Russia ’s bid to
join the  World Trade Organization  if Moscow agrees to
supervision by Georgian customs checkpoints in Abkhazia and
South Ossetia, Interfax reported, citing Akaki Minashvili,
chairman of the Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Relations.  Minashvili said the main principle of the WTO is
“transparent trade” between countries and as a result Georgia
wants the opportunity to track what goods are imported and
exported from the region, Interfax quoted Minashvili as saying
at a press conference in Tbilisi today.  Russia recognized Abkhazia and South Ossetia as sovereign
states after it routed Georgia’s army in a five-day war in
August 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
