Crude oil options volatility rose as
underlying futures set a 29-month high to settle above $105 a
barrel amid escalating violence in  Libya .  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
April, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 44.7 percent as of 2 p.m. in New York, up
from 44 percent on March 4. It was 27.2 percent on Feb. 11, the
day Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak  left office.  The buying today is “all over the place, but the biggest
one-option play I have seen is buying June $120 calls,” Ray Carbone, president of Paramount Options Inc. in New York and a
trader at the  New York Mercantile Exchange , said in a telephone
interview. “Most of the action is bullish.”  Crude oil for April delivery rose $1.02 to $105.44 a barrel
on the Nymex, the highest settlement price since Sept. 26, 2008.
The contract is up 29 percent from a year ago.  May $81 puts were the most active options in electronic
trading today, with 10,253 lots changing hands. They fell 7
cents to 10 cents a barrel. April $110 calls, the next most-
active contract, lost 7 cents to $1.60 a barrel with 3,205
contracts trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of oil.  Nymex distributes real-time data for electronic trading and
releases information on floor trading, where the bulk of options
trading occurs, the next business day.  June $120 calls were the most active options traded on
March 4, with 11,530 lots changing hands. They rose $1.11 to
$3.60 a barrel. The next most active option, May $125 calls,
gained 61 cents to $1.74 a barrel on 9,559 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $100 calls with
39,618 contracts. Next were December $120 calls with 36,788 and
December $80 puts with 32,981.  To contact the reporter on this story:
