benchmark regional index declining for the first time in three
days, after the conflict in Libya escalated and oil prices
surged, threatening to derail the global economic recovery.    Air China Ltd. (753)  and Korean Air Lines Co. fell more than 3

billion yen ($971 million). James Hardie Industries SE, the

recovery,” said  Pauline Dan , Hong Kong-based chief investment
officer at Samsung Asset Management, which oversees about $72
billion in assets globally. “U.S. consumers are not really in
the mood to spend and now they are faced with higher  oil
prices .”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropped 1.1 percent to 137.92
as of 1:37 p.m. in Tokyo, with more than three stocks declining

after fighting in Libya cut crude oil production in the North

in U.S. consumer spending, which makes up about 70 percent of
the world’s biggest economy.  Average hourly earnings in the U.S. were unchanged in
February, Labor Department data showed. Economists in a
Bloomberg survey had forecast 0.2 percent growth. The data
overshadowed a 192,000 increase in payrolls and an unexpected
decline in the  unemployment rate  to 8.9 percent, the lowest
level since April 2009.  Airlines Slump  Airlines declined after Crude oil for April delivery

day in January, Bloomberg News estimates show.  Kajima’s Algeria Project  Kajima Corp. dropped 1.9 percent to 210 yen in Tokyo after

yen, Nishimatsu Construction Co. lost 0.9 percent to 113 yen and
Hazama Corp. slid 2.6 percent to 74 yen.  Exporters declined on speculation surging oil prices and
growing unrest in the Middle East and North Africa will cut
global demand for goods and services.  James Hardie, which gets about 72 percent of sales from the
