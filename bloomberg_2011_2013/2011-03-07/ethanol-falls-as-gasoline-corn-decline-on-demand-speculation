Ethanol futures fell in  Chicago  as
gasoline and corn declined on speculation that prices for the
motor fuel will curtail demand for both.  The grain-based additive fell from a 31-month high after
gasoline pump prices hit their highest levels in more than two
years. Ethanol, made from corn in the U.S., is part of the
nation’s plans to reduce reliance on foreign oil sources.  “That price-demand tripwire isn’t very far away,” said
Peyton Feltus, president of Randolph Risk Management Inc. in
Chicago.  Denatured ethanol for April delivery fell 2.3 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $2.595 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Futures touched $2.618 a gallon on March 4, the highest price
since July 14, 2008.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  lost 2 cents,
or 0.7 percent, to $2.685 a gallon and in Chicago the additive
decreased 1.5 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $2.605, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf slipped 1 cent, or 0.4 percent, to
$2.665 a gallon, and on the West Coast the biofuel declined 1.5
cents, or 0.6 percent, to $2.69.  Gasoline for April delivery dropped 4.25 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $3.0039 a gallon in New York. The contract covers
reformulated gasoline, which is made to be blended with ethanol
before delivery to filling stations.  Regular gasoline at the retail pump averaged $3.509 a
gallon yesterday, AAA said on its  website , the highest level
since Oct. 5, 2008.  Corn futures for May delivery slid 10.5 cents, or 1.4
percent, to close at $7.175 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel of
the grain makes about 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  An average ethanol mill in  Iowa  is breaking even on every
gallon produced, while a plant in  Illinois  is pocketing about 3
cents after losing 1 cent last week, according to Ag Trader
