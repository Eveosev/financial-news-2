U.S. time-share vacation property
owners are struggling to sell their shares after the value of
some fell to pennies on the dollar, the Los Angeles Times
reported, citing consumer advocacy and industry officials.    Almost 8 million people, or about 7 percent of U.S.
households, own a time share that allows them to use the
vacation property at certain times of the year, the newspaper
said. Sales dropped 35 percent to $6.3 billion in 2009 and were
down 40 percent from their peak in 2007, the newspaper said.  The default rate on time-share loans stood at 8.5 percent in
December, down from one in 10 in January 2010, the newspaper
said., citing  Fitch Ratings .  As prices have fallen, fraud has mounted, with many scams
offering to find a buyer for thousands of dollars in upfront
fees, the Times added.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
