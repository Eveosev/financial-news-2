  China  should allow pension funds to
invest more money in domestic stock markets as the nation’s
economic development fuels companies’ demand for financing, an
official at the securities market regulator said.  There’s a large demand for capital, Zhu Congjiu, assistant
to the chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission,
told reporters in Beijing today during the annual National
People’s Congress meeting. The current pace of new initial
public offerings is reasonable, he said.  “The regulator isn’t likely to slow down the pace of IPOs
this year, given the goal of attracting more investments,” said
Tu Hai, a Shanghai-based strategist at Guoyuan Securities Co.
“We continue to see strong demand for new issuances” on
Shenzhen’s ChiNext board for start-ups and the board for small
and medium-sized companies, he said.  Of the 67 new stocks that began trading this year, 18 have
slipped below the offering price, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. More than 300 companies raised a record $70.7 billion
from IPOs in Shanghai and Shenzhen last year and 54 of those
companies are also below their sale price, the data show.  China needs a better plan to direct more capital into the
market, Zhu said. The securities regulator aims to make the
approval process for corporate bond sales and follow-on stock
offerings easier, he said.  The CSRC began reforming its new-equity market in 2009 by
abolishing a price-to-earnings ceiling for the IPO price.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
