Gold futures climbed to a record for
the third time in a week as escalating violence in  Libya  and
concern that inflation will accelerate boosted demand for the
metal as an investment haven. Silver rose to a 31-year high.  Gold reached an all-time high of $1,445.70 an ounce as
Libyan rebels moved along the coast toward Tripoli and
government troops loyal to Muammar Qaddafi escalated their use
of force. Crude oil extended a rally to a 29-month high in New
York on concern that turmoil will spread to Middle East
producers.  “The gold market is eyeing oil,” said  Frank McGhee , the
head dealer at Integrated Brokerage Services LLC in  Chicago .
“The concern is that the unrest will spill over to Saudi Arabia
as an ever-expanding world is using more and more oil every
day.”  Gold futures for April delivery rose $5.90, or 0.4 percent,
to settle at $1,434.50 at 1:32 p.m. on the Comex in  New York .
Last week, the metal climbed 1.4 percent, extending a rally to
six weeks, the longest since September 2007.  Silver futures for May delivery rose 53.8 cents, or 1.5
percent, to $35.865 an ounce. Earlier, the price reached
$36.745, the highest for a most-active contract since March
1980. That year, the metal climbed to a record of $50.35.  Saudi Arabia is the biggest oil producer in the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Surging food and
commodity prices contributed to unrest that toppled leaders in
Tunisia and  Egypt  with protests erupting in countries including
Iran, Yemen and Oman.  Saudi ‘Rage’  The  United Nations  estimated as of Feb. 26 that 1,000
people had died since the Libyan uprising began in mid-February.
In  Saudi Arabia , websites have called for a nationwide “Day of
Rage” on March 11 and March 20, according to Human Rights
Watch.  Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao told the annual National
People’s Congress in Beijing on March 5 that reining in
inflation is the nation’s top priority. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  has signaled that the Fed will complete $600
billion of Treasury purchases through June.  “You have an environment where you have rising inflation
and increasing liquidity,” Juerg Kiener, the chief investment
officer at Swiss Asia Capital Ltd. in  Singapore , said in an
interview on Bloomberg Television. “We have a very large
physical position of gold and silver in the market.”  Gold has gained 26 percent in the past 12 months, and
silver more than doubled. The MSCI World Index of equities was
up 14 percent.  Palladium futures for June delivery fell $19.70, or 2.4
percent, to $790.10 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  Platinum futures for April delivery dropped $17.50, or 1
percent, to $1,820.40 an ounce.  Palladium has climbed 66 percent in the past 12 months, and
platinum is up 15 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
