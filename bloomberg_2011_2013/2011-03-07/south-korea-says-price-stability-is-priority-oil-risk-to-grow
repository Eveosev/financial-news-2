  South Korea  said  price stability  is
the nation’s policy priority during the first half of the year
and that economic growth may slow because of the surge in  oil
prices  and an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease.  The climb in other global raw-material prices and China’s
monetary-policy tightening are further risks for the economy,
the Ministry of Strategy and Finance said in a statement
prepared for a session of parliament today. The nation will seek
to stabilize the won against “herd behavior,” it also said.  South Korean inflation rose to the highest level in more
than two years in February, breaching the central bank’s 4
percent ceiling for a second month and bolstering the case for
an interest-rate increase as early as this week. Food prices
have soared following the country’s worst outbreak of foot-and-
mouth disease, with millions of animals killed or buried.  Editors: Sunil Jagtiani, Lily Nonomiya  To contact the reporter on this story:
