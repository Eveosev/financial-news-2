Israeli stocks surged the most in
almost 10 months after the  U.S. Senate  passed a bipartisan
budget deal, agreeing to undo the potential economic harm of
$600 billion in tax increases and spending cuts.  The  benchmark TA-25 Index  rose, with 24 of the 25 members
advancing, pushing the index 2.5 percent higher, the most since
Mar. 14, at the close in Tel Aviv. Bonds fell as investors’ risk
appetite increased, sending the yield on the benchmark 10-year
bond six basis points higher to 3.67 percent. The shekel
advanced 0.1 percent to 3.7292 per dollar at 4:41 p.m. in
 Israel .  The Senate deal shifts the pressure to House Speaker  John
Boehner , who hasn’t said if he’ll accept the agreement. He will
face difficulty mustering Republican votes for any bill with
higher taxes for 2013 than they were in 2012.  “There was a lot uncertainty about whether there would be
some kind of deal,” said Sharon Naveh, head of the
international sales desk at Migdal Capital Markets Ltd. in Tel
Aviv. “With this deal, the market is somewhat hopeful that the
global economic situation might not deteriorate so sharply.”  The accord would make permanent the tax cuts for most
households that expired at midnight, continue expanded
unemployment benefits and delay automatic spending cuts for two
months.  Bank Leumi Le-Israel (LUMI)  led the TA-25 Index’s gains, adding
4.4 percent to 13.23 shekels, the highest since August 2011.
Mellanox Technologies Ltd. was the gauge’s only decliner,
slipping 0.4 percent to 223.9 shekels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
