Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s call for a
half percentage point interest-rate cut by  India ’s central bank
this month is gaining support in the swap market, where
borrowing costs fell for the third quarter.  The price of derivative contracts that fix rates for a year
fell two basis points last quarter to 7.61 percent, taking the
drop since March to 42 basis points, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. A similar measure rose 19 basis points to 3.34 percent in
China. Speculation that the  Reserve Bank  of India will ease
policy is strengthening after the government cut its estimate
for economic  growth  in the year through March to as little as
5.7 percent, the least in a decade, on Dec. 17.  RBI Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said last month that policy
makers’ focus needs to shift toward supporting the economy from
curbing inflation. Goldman Sachs forecasts the  repurchase  rate,
held at 8 percent since April, will be lowered to 7.5 percent at
the next review on Jan. 29, while BNP Paribas SA sees a 25 basis
point reduction. Eleven of 20 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg see
a 50 basis point decrease by March 31.  “Indian markets are positioning for a rate-cutting cycle,
given the shift in RBI’s focus to growth from inflation,”
Nagaraj Kulkarni, a Singapore-based strategist at  Standard
Chartered  Plc, said in an interview yesterday. “We expect a 25
basis point reduction in the repo rate this quarter.”  Rate Outlook  The one-year swap rate has slid 67 basis points, or 0.67
percentage point, from its 2012 peak of 8.26 percent in
February, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The measure
declined seven basis points since Subbarao said Dec. 18 that
slowing  inflation  increases room for the central bank to ease
policy. Annual gains in the nation’s benchmark price index
slowed to 7.24 percent in November, the least since January.  The RBI has held its repo rate unchanged since April, when
it was lowered by 50 basis points in the first reduction since
2009. The benchmark was boosted by a record 375 basis points, or
3.75 percentage points, through 2010 and 2011 to contain the
fastest price increases among the largest  emerging markets .  “In view of inflation pressures ebbing, monetary policy
has to increasingly shift focus and respond to the threats to
growth,” the RBI said in a statement on Dec. 18.  Easing Cash  Swap rates also declined as Subbarao took steps to ease a
cash squeeze at banks. Three-month interbank funding costs fell
by 92 basis points in 2012 to 8.92 percent as the RBI pumped
more than 2.7 trillion rupees into the financial system by
cutting lenders’ reserve requirements and buying sovereign debt.
The monetary authority cut the proportion of deposits lenders
must set aside as  reserves  by 175 basis points last year to a
36-year low of 4.25 percent.  The yield on 10-year  government bonds  slid 52 basis points
in 2012 as traders boosted rate-cut bets. The yield on the
benchmark 8.15 percent debt due June 2022 fell six basis points
today to 7.99 percent today, offering an extra  amount  of 629
basis points over U.S. Treasuries, while the rupee advanced 0.3
percent to 54.8150 per dollar.  “We have a constructive outlook on Indian government
bonds,” Standard Chartered’s Kulkarni said. “Bonds are lagging
the swap curve in pricing in forthcoming rate cuts.”  The cost to insure the debt of government-controlled  State
Bank of India (SBIN) , a proxy for the sovereign, for five years slid
172 basis points last year to 223, according to data provider
CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices
quoted by dealers in privately negotiated markets. Credit-
default swaps for  China  fell 82 basis points to 65.  “Growth is a concern and expectations for a rate cut are
quite legitimate given that headline inflation is coming
lower,” Lakshmi Iyer, Mumbai-based head of fixed income at
Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Co. overseeing the equivalent of
$5.6 billion, said in an interview yesterday. “Markets are
pricing in a cut in the repo rate on Jan. 29 to 7.75 percent or
even 7.5 percent.”
