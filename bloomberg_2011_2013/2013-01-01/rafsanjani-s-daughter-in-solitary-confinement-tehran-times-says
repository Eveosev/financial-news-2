The jailed daughter of former Iranian
president Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani has been held in solitary
confinement since Dec. 29, the Tehran Times reported.  Faezeh Hashemi, who was taken into custody Sept. 22 to
serve a six-month sentence for “spreading propaganda against
the Islamic system,” was being punished for breaking prison
regulations, the paper said today, citing a press briefing by
Prosecutor-General Gholamhossein Mohseni-Ejei.  Hashemi, a former lawmaker, was arrested twice for joining
anti-government rallies following the unrest triggered by
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s disputed re-election in 2009.
She was banned from involvement in political, cultural and media
activities for five years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
