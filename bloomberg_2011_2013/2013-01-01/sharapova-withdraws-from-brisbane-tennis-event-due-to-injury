French Open champion  Maria Sharapova 
withdrew from the season-opening  Brisbane  International tennis
tournament with a right collarbone injury.  Her practice time had been limited by the injury and the
25-year-old said she was told by her doctor in New York to not
do any overhead training for a week.  “So to be fair, I haven’t really given myself a chance to
pretty much hit any serves or anything over my head,” the
Russian, ranked No. 2 on the WTA Tour rankings, said yesterday
on the tournament  website . “Just been practicing groundstrokes.
So I just kind of ran out of time here.”  Sharapova didn’t say whether the injury would prevent her
from playing in the Australian Open, the year’s opening Grand
Slam tournament that begins in Melbourne on Jan. 14. She pulled
out of an exhibition tournament in South Korea last week with a
neck problem.  Sharapova also withdrew from Brisbane last year with an
ankle injury. She then went on to finish second at the
Australian Open to  Victoria Azarenka .  To contact the reporter on this story:
