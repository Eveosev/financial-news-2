Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  and smaller
affiliate  Kia Motors Corp. (000270) , South  Korea ’s two largest
automakers, forecast their weakest sales growth in seven years
as a slowing global economy and strengthening won saps demand.  The companies plan combined sales to rise 4.1 percent to
7.41 million cars in 2013,  Chung Mong Koo , chairman of both Kia
and Hyundai, told employees during a new year address in Seoul
today. That’s the lowest growth since 2006, when deliveries
shrank 1.2 percent. The sales compare with the 7.43 million
average estimate of three analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Chung, 74, told employees to brace for a “very difficult
year” and be more proactive to changes in the markets to meet
the business targets. The companies are also coping with a won
that’s appreciated more than any other major Asian currency in
the past six months, undermining their ability to compete
globally against  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  and  General Motors Co. (GM)   “The automobile industry is relatively more currency
sensitive, as fierce competition leads to competitive pricing,”
Lee Sang Hyun, an analyst at  NH Investment & Securities Co. (016420) ,
said by phone. This in turn leaves companies with little room to
factor in the impact of currency movements, he said.  Hyundai, whose shares advanced 2.6 percent last year, fell
1.1 percent to close at 216,000 won. Kia, which declined 15
percent in 2012, dropped 0.4 percent to 56,300 won, while South
Korea’s benchmark Kospi index advanced 1.7 percent today.  Slower Growth  The automakers sold an estimated 7.12 million vehicles in
2012, exceeding their goal of 7 million units, Chung said.
Hyundai and Kia’s 2013 growth forecast is half the 8 percent
increase posted last year.  “2013 will be a very difficult year as the ongoing
European crisis and the slowing global economy affect
international and domestic markets,” the chairman said.  Still, the forecast exceeds Hyundai’s own projection for
industry growth of 3.6 percent, and Toyota’s 2 percent growth
estimate for its sales this year.  “Although a 4.1 percent increase doesn’t seem all that
impressive, Hyundai and Kia are still poised to be in a better
shape than most competitors,” NH’s Lee said. European
carmakers, mostly dependent on sales in their region, will
continue to struggle this year, he said.  China Deliveries  Hyundai forecast its sales will climb 5.8 percent to 4.66
million vehicles in 2013, 60,000 units more than the average
analyst estimate. Kia predicted deliveries will increase 1.1
percent to 2.75 million units, or almost 3 percent shy of the
average estimate.  Both carmakers will probably keep increasing market share
in  Europe  and outperform in  China , Lee said. Hyundai sales will
increase 12 percent in China, 6.6 percent in Europe and 5.3
percent in the U.S. this year, based on Lee’s estimates. Kia
sales will rise 5.3 percent in China, 0.9 percent in Europe and
1.8 percent in the U.S., he said.  China is Hyundai’s biggest market, accounting for 18
percent of sales in the first nine months of 2012, followed by
the U.S. at 17 percent. The U.S. is Kia’s largest market,
contributing 21 percent of sales in the period, while Korea is
the second biggest, responsible for 17 percent.  Demand in China, the largest auto market, will help Kia and
Hyundai exceed their target of delivering 1.25 million vehicles
in the country in 2012, they said in October. The companies’
nine-month sales rose in Europe on demand for models including
Hyundai’s i10 minicar and Kia’s Cee’d hatchback.  New Models  Hyundai and Kia will respectively introduce the next-
generation Genesis luxury sedan and the new Soul wagon this
year, according to Lee of NH and Shin Chung Kwan, an analyst at
KB Investment & Securities Co. in  Seoul . The companies didn’t
immediately respond to queries on new models sent by e-mail.  Hyundai’s net income will probably increase 7 percent to
9.65 trillion won ($9.1 billion) in 2013, while Kia’s may climb
6.9 percent to 4.45 trillion won, according to average analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Fourth-quarter net income at Hyundai, scheduled to be
reported this month, may have risen 12 percent to 2.23 trillion
won, according to the average of 25 analyst estimates compiled
by Bloomberg. Kia’s profit for the quarter probably gained 34
percent to 1.06 trillion won, based on 24 estimates.  The Seoul-based carmakers, which said in November that they
overstated the fuel efficiency of some models in the U.S., will
incur combined costs of about 600 billion won in fourth-quarter
earnings to reimburse customers, according to Shin.  The inflated energy ratings, for models including the
Elantra and Soul, led Kia and Hyundai to offer customers of
900,000 vehicles bought in the past two years prepaid fuel cards
to compensate them for the differences in fuel economy compared
with what appeared on the cars’ window stickers.  The mileage discrepancies aren’t likely to impact sales at
Hyundai and Kia this year, Lee and Shin said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
