Excess rainfall that cut crop yields
across the U.K. and rising feed prices cost farmers about 1.3
billion pounds ($2.1 billion) in 2012, the National Farmers
Union said.  June to August was the rainiest in the U.K. in a century,
while  England , the country’s biggest wheat-growing area, capped
its wettest  year  on record in 2012, according to the Met Office,
the national weather forecaster. The U.K., the European Union’s
third-largest wheat grower, harvested 13.26 million metric tons
of the  grain  in 2012, down 13 percent from 2011, the Department
for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs says.  “The appalling weather of 2012 has led to a financial
black hole on Britain’s farms,” NFU President Peter Kendall
said in a statement today. “As we enter 2013, many farmers are
in areas under water or facing a double-whammy of huge feed
bills for their livestock.”  Feed-wheat futures for May delivery surged 36 percent in
2012 on NYSE Liffe in  London  as rain cut British yields and
droughts in the U.S. and  Russia  curbed global grain supplies.
The contract touched an all-time high at 230 pounds on Nov. 28.  Total U.K. farm income was 5.57 billion pounds in 2011, up
24 percent from a year earlier, according to Defra, which hasn’t
released figures for 2012.  “Farm incomes in the U.K., taken at the aggregate level,
are going to be down year on year, reflecting in part the higher
costs we’ve incurred and higher feed bills,” NFU Chief
Economist Phil Bicknell said in a telephone interview yesterday
from Stoneleigh, England. Declining crop yields because of wet
weather reduced national income by about 700 million pounds,
while rising input costs, including for feed, trimmed 600
million pounds from farmers’ bottom lines, he said.  EU policy makers should work to ensure farmer payments are
distributed more evenly among countries in the bloc as they
discuss potential budget cuts and reforms to support programs
under the Common Agricultural Policy, the NFU said.  “We have urged the U.K. government to help to make
current, distorted markets work properly and to ensure our
farmers are treated fairly,” Kendall said in the statement.
“In years like 2012, it is very clear to see that the support
farming receives from the CAP is an absolute lifeline to many
farmers. If there is to be a reduction in these payments, it
should take place evenly across  Europe ’s single market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
