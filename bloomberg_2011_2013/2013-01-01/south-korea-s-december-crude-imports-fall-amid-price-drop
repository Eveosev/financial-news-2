South Korea , the world’s fifth-
largest oil importer, purchased 0.3 percent less crude in
December compared with a year ago.  Imports declined to 80.1 million barrels last month from
80.4 million barrels a year earlier, the  Ministry  of  Knowledge
Economy  said in an e-mailed statement. Purchasing prices dropped
0.8 percent to $112.1 a barrel from a year earlier, the ministry
said, citing preliminary figures. The bill for buying oil fell
1.1 percent to $8.9 billion.  Asia ’s fourth-largest economy exported almost half of the
crude volume that it imported in 2011 after refining it into
gasoline, diesel and other products.  Overseas shipments of oil products climbed 0.3 percent in
December from the previous year to $4.5 billion, according to
today’s report. Petrochemical shipments were valued at $3.9
billion, up 6.2 percent from a year ago.  Imports of liquefied natural gas cost $3.9 billion in
December, a fall of 7.7 percent from the same month a year
earlier. Coal imports fell 43 percent, the ministry said.  -- Editors: Abhay Singh, Ravil Shirodkar  To contact the reporter on this story:
