Andy Reid  is the leading candidate to
become head coach of the  Arizona Cardinals  two days after being
fired following a 14-year stint with the  Philadelphia Eagles ,
ESPN reported.  Reid, 54, may be named as Ken Whisenhunt’s replacement by
the end of the week,  ESPN said , citing people familiar with the
matter it didn’t identify. Mark Dalton, the Cardinals’ vice
president of media relations,  said on Twitter  last night that
reports of a deal being “95% done are 100% incorrect.”  Cardinals defensive coordinator Ray Horton interviewed for
the job, the team has reached out to Reid and also plans to
speak with Denver Broncos offensive coordinator Mike McCoy,
Dalton added.  Reid was fired after the Eagles went 4-12 this season, his
worst record since joining the team in 1999. He led the Eagles
to five National Football Conference title games and a Super
Bowl appearance in 2005, and his 14-year run with Philadelphia
was the longest of any active head coach in the NFL.  Reid’s signing by Arizona would bring a reunion with
quarterback  Kevin Kolb , who played his first four seasons in
Philadelphia before joining the Cardinals in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
