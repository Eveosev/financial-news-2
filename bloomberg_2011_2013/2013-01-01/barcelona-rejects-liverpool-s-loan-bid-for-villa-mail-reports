Barcelona has rejected Liverpool’s
offer to take striker  David Villa  on loan, the  Daily Mail 
reported.  Villa, 31, is frustrated by a reduction in playing time and
is open to a move to England, the Mail said. Barcelona will only
consider a sale, the newspaper said.  Arsenal is also interested in Villa, who’s scored five
goals in 17 games this seeason, but is reluctant to enter a
bidding war after being told the price would be at least 16
million pounds ($26 million), the Mail said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
