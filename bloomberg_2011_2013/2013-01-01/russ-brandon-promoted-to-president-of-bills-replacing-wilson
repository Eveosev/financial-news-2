The  Buffalo Bills  promoted Russ
Brandon to president with full authority over the National
Football League team’s operations.  Brandon, who had served solely as the club’s chief
operating officer, will now hold a dual role as chief executive
officer, Bills owner Ralph Wilson said in a statement. Brandon
replaces the 94-year-old Wilson as president and CEO.  “I have granted him full autonomy to run the organization
as he feels is best,” Wilson said. “We want our team to be one
that our fans are proud of. I believe that Russ has the unique
abilities to assemble and lead the talent we will need to get
the job done.”  The Bills fired Chan Gailey as coach yesterday after a
second consecutive 6-10 season, leaving the team looking for its
fifth new coach since 2001. Buffalo hasn’t had a winning record
since going 9-7 in 2004 and has the NFL’s longest playoff
drought at 13 years.  “These past 13 years have been very difficult on our fans
and we have not produced the type of winning team that they
deserve,” Wilson said. “It has been frustrating for our
organization and for me as well.”  Brandon has spent 16 years with the Bills, holding a
variety of roles, including general manager in 2008 and 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
