The U.S. budget bill passed by the
Senate early today would add $4 trillion to U.S. deficits and
debt over the next decade, compared with what would happen if
Congress did nothing, according to a  Congressional Budget Office 
report today.  Most of the effects come from reinstating income tax cuts
that expired yesterday. According to the White House, allowing
some tax cuts to expire would raise $620 billion in revenue,
compared with extending all tax cuts.  The extension of  unemployment benefits  in the bill would
cost $30.1 billion and the prevention of a cut in doctorsâ€™
payments under Medicare would cost $25.2 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
