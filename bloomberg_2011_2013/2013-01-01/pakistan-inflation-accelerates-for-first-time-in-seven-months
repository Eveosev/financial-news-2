Pakistani inflation accelerated for
the first time in seven months in December, limiting room for
another  interest-rate  cut to boost a struggling economy.  Consumer prices  rose 7.93 percent from a year earlier, the
Bureau of Statistics said in Islamabad today, compared with 6.93
percent in November and the median 7.7 percent projection in a
Bloomberg News survey of five economists.  Subdued global expansion, power blackouts and an insurgency
on the Afghan border have hurt  Pakistan ’s economy, which may
need more International Monetary Fund aid as foreign reserves
dwindle. The central bank lowered its benchmark interest rate by
50 basis points to a five-year low of 9.5 percent in December,
which added to 2 percentage points of easing since August 2012.  “I don’t see another rate cut,” Suleman Akhtar, an
economist at Foundation Securities Ltd. in Karachi, said before
the release. ”I see prices going up from here because of rupee
devaluation and  government borrowing  for the  budget deficit .”  The rupee has declined about 7.5 percent against the dollar
in the past 12 months. The Karachi Stock Exchange 100 index has
climbed almost 50 percent in the same period as companies
reported higher profits even as economic expansion faltered.  The IMF said in November that “the achievement of durably
lower inflation would require more prudent monetary policy
accompanied by substantial fiscal adjustment to ease the
government’s funding requirement, which has been driving
inflation.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
