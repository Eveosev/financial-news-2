Posco (005490) ,  Asia ’s third-largest
steelmaker, agreed to buy a stake in ArcelorMittal Mines  Canada 
Inc., Chung Jae Woong, a Seoul-based spokesman at Posco said.  The Korean steelmaker hasn’t decided on the amount of stake
it will purchase or for how much, Chung said today.  The Maeil Business Newspaper reported earlier today Posco
will buy a 15 percent stake in the mine for $1.1 billion. Yonhap
News reported a group, including Posco and  China Steel Corp. (2002) ,
will buy the stake for $1.1 billion. China Steel will invest
$540 million, while Posco will spend $270 million, the Korean-
language news agency said, citing people it didn’t identify.  An e-mail to ArcelorMittal’s press office after hours
wasn’t immediately answered. An e-mail to the company’s London-
based spokesman Giles Read received an automated reply saying he
is on leave till Jan. 3.  ArcelorMittal (MT)  is considering selling about 30 percent of
its Canadian iron ore unit, a person familiar with the matter
said Oct. 19. ArcelorMittal is working with Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. and Royal Bank of Canada, according to the person, who
asked not to be named because the deliberations are private.  ArcelorMittal Mines Canada produces about 15 million metric
tons of iron ore concentrate and more than 9 million tons of
iron oxide pellets annually, according to its website. It
operates two open pit mines and produces about 40 percent of
Canada’s iron ore output.  To contact the reporters on this story:
