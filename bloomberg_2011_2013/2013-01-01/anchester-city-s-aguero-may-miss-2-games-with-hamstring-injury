Manchester City striker  Sergio Aguero 
may miss the Premier League champion’s next two games with a
hamstring injury, assistant coach David Platt said.  Aguero left today’s 3-0 win over Stoke minutes after
scoring City’s final goal with a penalty kick. City expects him
to sit out an F.A. Cup match against Watford on Jan. 5 and a
league game at Arsenal eight days later.  “We’ll know more in 48 hours,” Platt said on the club’s
website. “There are different degrees of hamstring injuries
which is why we need to assess the extent of what has happened
until Thursday.”  Platt also said striker  Mario Balotelli  may return for the
Watford game after missing the past four matches with a virus.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
