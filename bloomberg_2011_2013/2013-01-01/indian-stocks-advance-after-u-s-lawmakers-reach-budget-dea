Indian (SENSEX)  stocks climbed to a 20-month
high and the rupee rose after the  U.S. Senate  passed a budget
deal seeking to undo tax increases that took effect today.  The BSE India Sensitive Index, or Sensex, advanced 0.8
percent to 19,580.81, the highest close since April 25, 2011.
Aluminum producer  Hindalco Industries Ltd. (HNDL)  jumped 2.8 percent,
leading  metal stocks  higher after prices climbed in London.
 Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. (BHEL)  increased for a third day, adding
1.9 percent.  The legislation, passed this morning, would make permanent
the tax cuts for most U.S. households that expired at midnight,
continue expanded  unemployment benefits  and delay automatic
spending cuts for two months. The Sensex climbed  26 percent  in
2012, the most since an 81 percent surge in 2009, as the Indian
government took steps to open the  economy  to foreign investment
and domestic stocks attracted Asia’s biggest overseas inflows.  “This agreement clears the air to a large extent and gives
more confidence to emerging-market equity investors,” Aneesh Srivastava, who oversees $475 million as the chief investment
officer at IDBI Federal Life Insurance Co. in Mumbai, said by
phone. “Indian stocks need support not just from local
policymakers but also from global markets for the rally to
continue.”  The U.S. budget accord emerged from an agreement yesterday
between Vice President  Joe Biden  and Senate Minority Leader
 Mitch McConnell  to stave off more than $600 billion in tax
increases and federal spending cuts, or the so-called fiscal
cliff, set to begin this month. The 157-page bill now moves to
the House for consideration.  The U.S. took in 11 percent of India’s exports in the six
months ended September 2011, commerce ministry data show.  Rupee, Bonds  The rupee gained on optimism any success in preventing tax
increases in the U.S. will spur fund flows into emerging-market
assets. The currency rose 0.6 percent to 54.6850 per dollar in
Mumbai at the close, data compiled by Bloomberg show. It slid
3.5 percent last year, the worst performance after Indonesia’s
rupiah among Asia’s 10 most-used currencies excluding the yen.  India’s 10-year bonds increased the most in five months,
sending the yield to a two-year low, after the government
deferred a debt auction previously scheduled for this week.
Bonds also gained after the central bank said in a separate
statement that it plans to purchase 80 billion rupees of debt at
an open-market auction on Jan. 4.  Metals Rally  The  MSCI India Materials Index (MXIN0MT)  increased the most among the
10 industry groups of the MSCI India Index, adding 1.7 percent.
Hindalco jumped 2.8 percent to 134.15 rupees, its highest close
since March 21.  Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd. (STLT) , the largest
copper producer, added 1.9 percent to 118.90 rupees. Three-month
delivery copper rose 0.6 percent on the London Metal Exchange
yesterday. Zinc, tin and aluminum also climbed.  Jindal Steel &
Power Ltd. (JSP)  rallied 3 percent to 461.05 rupees, making it the
best performer on the Sensex today.  A gauge of  industrial stocks  was the second-biggest gainer
among the sectoral indexes. Bharat Heavy, the largest Indian
power-equipment maker, rose 1.9 percent to 232.60 rupees.  Larsen
& Toubro Ltd. (LT)  added 1.1 percent to 1,624.90 rupees.  The S&P CNX  Nifty Index (NIFTY)  on the National Stock Exchange of
India added 0.8 percent to 5,950.85, the highest close since
January 2011. The BSE Mid-Cap Index climbed 1.2 percent to
7,197.58, the highest level in more than 20 months. India VIX,
which measures the cost of protection against declines in the
Nifty, sank 8.4 percent to 13.69, the most since Oct. 22.  Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  overhauled policies starting
mid-September, raising diesel prices and opening the economy to
more foreign investment to lift  growth  from September quarter’s
5.3 percent, which matched a three-year low. The policies led to
foreigners plowing a net $24.5 billion into local stocks in
2012, the highest among 10 Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg.  Last year’s rally has driven Sensex’s  valuation  to 15.5
times  estimated earnings , the highest levels since March, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index
trades at a multiple of 12.1.  Other markets in the region are closed today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
