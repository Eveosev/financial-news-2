Elbit Systems Ltd. (ESLT) , Israel’s biggest
non-government developer of defense technology, posted its best
performance since 2009 in  New York  last year as escalating
violence in the region spurred more contracts.  Shares of Elbit climbed 4.2 percent yesterday in the U.S.
to $40.05, trimming the decline in 2012 to 2.2 percent. The
stock sank 23 percent in 2011 and 18 percent in 2010. The
 Bloomberg Israel-US Equity Index (ISRA25BN)  of the largest Israeli stocks
traded in New York added 1.1 percent to 86.37 yesterday, capping
a 6.3 percent jump last year.  Retalix Ltd. (RTLX)  and  Mellanox (MLNX) 
Technologies Ltd. were the  best performers  on the gauge in 2012.  A succession of orders from Israel’s government helped
Haifa-based Elbit rebound from a six-year low reached Aug. 28,
compensating for falling revenue in the U.S. and Europe as the
nation engaged in a conflict with Hamas militants and tensions
with  Iran  intensified. The company said yesterday that it
received $315 million in contracts from Israel’s  Defense
Ministry  following a Sept. 10 order for $420 million.  The orders “no doubt will create a jump in the company’s
backlog, which makes investors more comfortable into 2013,”
Guil Bashan, an analyst at Israel Brokerage & Investments Ltd.
who rates Elbit neutral, said by phone from Tel Aviv yesterday.
“This will, in a way, offset the decline in contracts in other
markets because of declining defense budgets.”  The Israeli orders include sales of unmanned systems,
electronic warfare and avionics, Elbit said in a statement to
the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. The company’s backlog of orders was
$5.53 billion as of Sept. 30, compared with $5.47 billion on
June 30 and $5.45 billion on March 31. Israel’s  TA-25 (TA-25)  index
added 1.8 percent at 10:44 a.m. in  Tel Aviv .  ‘Take Advantage’  “The contract is spread across all  sectors  within Elbit
Systems and involves practically all capabilities the company is
involved in, so it gives investors a support,” Bashan said.
“As long as there are conflicts in this region, especially in
Israel, Elbit will continue to take advantage in order to help
the army face those conflicts.”  A defense ministry committee recommended Aug. 19 increasing
Israel’s defense budget by about 3.5 percent a year to 76.2
billion shekels ($19.8 billion) in 2017 from 64 billion shekels
in 2013.  Israel began an eight-day military operation termed Pillar
of Defense on Nov. 14 against militants in the  Gaza Strip  in
which 167 Palestinians and six Israelis were killed. There is a
33 percent chance  Israel  or the U.S. will launch a military
strike against Iran’s nuclear sites by the end of 2013,
according to odds compiled by Intrade.com, as of Dec. 31.  Elbit, which got 50 percent of revenue from the U.S. and
Europe in 2011, is seeking new revenue sources as American
lawmakers plan to cut defense spending by at least $487 billion
over 10 years and as gross domestic product in the 17-nation
euro region stagnates amid the deepening debt crisis.  Retalix, Mellanox  Retalix  rallied  84 percent to $29.74 last year, the biggest
annual gain since 2009. The shares in Tel Aviv surged 79 percent
to 110.90 shekels, or the equivalent of $29.72.  NCR Corp. (NCR)   said 
on Nov. 28 that it will buy the Ra’anana, Israel-based maker of
supermarket software for $650 million, the third-biggest
acquisition in Israel last year. The shares today gained 0.8
percent to 111.8 shekels, or the equivalent of $29.94.  Mellanox, the maker of technology used to transfer and
store data, soared 83 percent to $59.38 last year as it
benefited from surging demand for its InfiniBand technology. The
shares in Tel Aviv led the benchmark index, advancing 81 percent
to 224.90 shekels, or the equivalent of $60.27.  The shares pared a gain of as much as 269 percent in the
first eight months of the year on concern the Yokneam Elit,
Israel-based company faces increasing competition from  Intel
Corp. (INTC) , the world’s largest maker largest of chips. The Israel
shares this morning fell 1.4 percent, to 221.7 shekels, or the
equivalent of $59.36.  Israel, whose population of 7.8 million is similar in size
to Switzerland’s, is home to more startup companies per capita
than the U.S. and has 54 companies traded on the Nasdaq Stock
Market, the most of any country outside the U.S. after  China .  To contact the reporter on this story:
