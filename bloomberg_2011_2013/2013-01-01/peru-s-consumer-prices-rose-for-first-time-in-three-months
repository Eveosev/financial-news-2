Peruvian  consumer prices  increased in
December for the first time in three months after food costs and
bus fares rose, the government said.  Prices climbed 0.26 percent from a month earlier and gained
2.65 percent last year, the national statistics agency said in
an e-mailed statement. Economists expected a 0.32 percent rise
on the month and a 2.7 percent gain on the year, according to
the median estimates of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Peru ’s central bank increased lenders’ reserve requirements
on Dec. 30 for a fifth time in eight months to prevent credit
growth from stoking inflation. The monetary authority has kept
its  benchmark lending rate  at 4.25 percent since May 2011 on the
expectation annual inflation would slow to within its target
range of 2 percent plus or minus 1 percentage point.  Food and drink prices rose 0.18 percent last month and were
up 4.1 percent last year, the agency said. Prices in the
transport and communications segment increased 1 percent in
December and fell 0.1 percent in 2012.  The agency’s consumer-price index is based on a survey of
businesses in the Lima Metropolitan area. Food and drink
products constitute 38 percent of the index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
