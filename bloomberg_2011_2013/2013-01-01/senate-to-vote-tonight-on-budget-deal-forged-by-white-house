Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid
said tonight the chamber would vote on an agreement between the
White House and Republicans to prevent tax increases scheduled
to take effect tomorrow for almost every U.S. worker.  Reid spoke after a meeting with Senate Democrats at which
Vice President Joe Biden pitched the plan to party members,
several of whom had earlier expressed reservations about the
accord. Lawmakers including Senator Charles Schumer, a  New York 
Democrat, said afterward they expected wide support for the
plan.  After more than 17 months of bickering, Congress and
President  Barack Obama  have yet to finalize a deal to avert more
than $600 billion in tax increases and federal spending cuts
scheduled to start in January. Even if a deal clears both
chambers of Congress in coming days, it would be more limited
than what Obama and leaders of both parties sought.   “There are many many reasons people don’t like the
proposal,” Schumer said. “But there’s very close to unanimity
that it’s better than going over the cliff.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
