Totttenham goalkeeper  Carlo Cudicini  on a free transfer, the
Major League Soccer club said on its website.  Cudicini, 39, struggled for playing time behind Brad

since joining the club in 2009. His only action this season came
in a 3-0 win over Carlisle in the League Cup.  Cudicini began his career with AC Milan in 1992 before
moving to Lazio. He signed with Chelsea in 2000 after playing in
the lower leagues in Italy and helped the Blues to six trophies,
including a pair of Premier League titles.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
