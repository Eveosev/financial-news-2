U.S. stocks surged, sending the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to its biggest rally in a year, and
commodities jumped after Congress passed a bill averting most of
the tax increases and spending cuts threatening the recovery in
the world’s biggest economy. Treasury yields gained.  The S&P 500 rose 2.5 percent to 1,462.42 at 4 p.m. in  New
York  and has increased 4.3 percent in the past two sessions. The
 Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  climbed 2 percent to the highest since
February 2011 as equities added to last year’s 13 percent  global
rally . Industrial metals led commodities up and oil advanced to
a three-month high. The  Dollar Index (DXY)  reversed an early slide,
while Treasury 10-year yields climbed eight basis points.  President  Barack Obama  said he will sign into law the bill
undoing tax increases for more than 99 percent of households as
Republicans vowed to fight him for spending cuts in exchange for
raising the debt ceiling. An industry report today showed
American manufacturing expanded in December at a pace that shows
the industry is stabilizing after reaching a three-year low a
month earlier.  “Short-term, a deal is good for the market,” Thomas Garcia, head of equity trading at Santa Fe, New Mexico-based
Thornburg Investment Management Inc., said by telephone. His
firm oversees about $80 billion. “Long-term, more has to be
done in the way of spending cuts before we can declare
victory.”  Market Leaders  Gauges of telephone, technology and financial companies
climbed at least 2.9 percent to lead gains as all 10 of the  S&P
500 ’s main industry groups jumped, sending the gauge to its
highest level since Sept. 14. Hewlett-Packard Co., Caterpillar
Inc. and AT&T Inc. advanced more than 3.8 percent to lead the
 Dow Jones Industrial Average  up 308.57 points to 13,412.71 for
its biggest gain since June.  The S&P 500 rose 1.7 percent on Dec. 31, the biggest end-
of-year increase since 1974, in anticipation of a budget deal.
The benchmark index rallied 13 percent in 2012, its best year
since 2009 when markets began recovering from the  bear market 
that followed the U.S. financial crisis. The S&P 500 is 0.2
percent below an almost five-year high set in September and
needs to rise 7 percent to surpass the all-time record of
1,565.15 reached in October 2007.  The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known
as the VIX, fell 19 percent to 14.68 in New York today. It
slumped 35 percent in two days, the most ever. VIX futures
trading rose to a record 221,323 contracts today, surpassing the
previous high reached Dec. 31, according to the CBOE Futures
Exchange.  Manufacturing Expands  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s manufacturing index
climbed to 50.7 last month from November’s 49.5, which was the
weakest since July 2009. Fifty is the dividing line between
expansion and contraction. The median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg called for a rise to 50.5.  “We’re catching up to where we would’ve been had we not
had the fiscal cliff drama,”  James Paulsen , the chief
investment strategist at Minneapolis-based Wells Capital
Management, which oversees about $325 billion, said in a
telephone interview. “We’re revaluing the market based on
what’s closer to the underlying economy and most of the economic
reports have been pretty good.”  The House’s 257-167 bipartisan vote breaks a yearlong
impasse over how to head off $600 billion in tax increases and
spending cuts that would have started taking effect yesterday.
While avoiding most of the immediate pain, the measure is only
one step toward curbing the federal deficit. The issue will
return with a February fight over raising the $16.4 trillion
debt limit.  Tax Rates  Under the plan, households making less than $450,000 per
year would be spared an income tax-rate increase. The wealthy
would see a rise in their top rate, to 39.6 percent, from 35
percent. The top tax rates on  capital gains  and dividends would
go up to 23.8 percent, from 15 percent last year.  For an individual with $10,000 invested in the S&P 500,
dividends after taxes would fall to $167.64 a year from $187 at
today’s payout rate. An investor who sells shares at a $5,000
profit would face capital gains obligations of about $1,190
compared with $750 in 2012.  All 19 industry  groups  in the Stoxx 600 advanced during the
year’s first trading session. The European benchmark jumped 14
percent last year, the biggest increase since 2009. Rio Tinto
Group led a rally in mining companies today, rising 5.1 percent.
Porsche SE and Volkswagen AG climbed more than 3 percent to pace
gains in automakers.  Europe Output  Euro-area manufacturing output contracted more than
initially estimated in December, adding to signs a recession in
the currency bloc may extend as leaders struggle to tackle the
sovereign-debt crisis. A gauge of manufacturing in the 17-nation
euro area fell to 46.1 from 46.2 in November, London-based
Markit Economics said. That’s below an initial estimate of 46.3
on Dec. 14. A reading below 50 indicates contraction.  The cost of insuring against default on European bank debt
dropped, with the Markit iTraxx Financial index of credit-
default swaps linked to 25 banks and insurers falling 15 basis
points to 127.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific excluding Japan Index  gained 2.1
percent,  the highest since August 2011. Equity markets in  Japan 
and mainland  China  were closed today and tomorrow for public
holidays.  Developing-nation stocks rose the most since September,
with the  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  adding 2.1 percent and the
MSCI BRIC Index of the largest  emerging markets  surging 2.6
percent and extending its gain from a low in June to 22 percent.  Commodities Rally  Eighteen of 24 commodities tracked by the S&P GSCI Index
advanced, sending the measure up 0.8 percent. Lead, aluminum,
nickel and copper jumped at least 3.5 percent. Oil futures in
New York climbed 1.4 percent to $93.12 a barrel.  A Chinese manufacturing gauge showed a third month of
expansion yesterday. The  Purchasing Managers ’ Index was 50.6 in
December, the National Bureau of Statistics and China Federation
of Logistics and Purchasing said. That compares with the 51.0
median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of analysts and 50.6
in November. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  China will “step up efforts to promote strong, sustainable
and balanced growth in the world economy,” President  Hu Jintao 
said in a New Year’s Eve address broadcast on state media. China
achieved stable economic development in 2012 and will seek to do
the same this year while making restructuring of its growth
model a focus, he said.  Dollar Index  The Dollar Index, a gauge of the currency against six major
peers, increased 0.1 percent after losing as much as 0.6
percent. The currency strengthened 0.1 percent to $1.3185  The dollar weakened against 12 of its 16 major peers. The
yen also slid as investors sought higher-yielding assets and
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe reiterated his intention to
weaken the nation’s currency. Japan’s currency fell against 15
of 16 major peers, trading near a two-and-a-half-year low versus
the dollar.  Treasury 10-year note  yields  climbed eight basis points to
1.84 percent, the highest since September on a closing basis.
The yield on similar-maturity German debt jumped 13 basis points
to 1.44 percent while Britain’s 10-year rate climbed 16 basis
points to 1.99 percent, the largest gains since September for
both.  The world’s leading economies will have $220 billion less
sovereign debt to refinance in 2013, cutting supply after every
major government bond market rallied for the first time since
the 2008 financial crisis.  The amount of bills, notes and bonds coming due for the
Group of Seven nations plus  Brazil ,  Russia ,  India  and China will
drop to $7.38 trillion from $7.60 trillion in 2012, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Japan, the U.K., Germany, France,
Italy and Brazil will see a decline, while the U.S., Canada,
Russia, India and China will face an increase.  To contact the reporters on this story:
