Lifting farm productivity may be
hindered by debate on how to go about raising yields, said Matin
Qaim, professor of international food economics at  Germany ’s
University of Goettingen. Following are comments he made at the
 “Feeding the World”  meeting organized by Economist Conferences
in Geneva yesterday.  “We can double agricultural productivity at a global
level. We certainly need more money for research and innovation,
it’s going to be challenging and it can be done. I do see a big
obstacle in the ideological and polarized public debate on the
right way to do so.”  “The first big debate is about low versus high external
input strategies. We cannot just increase productivity by using
more agrochemicals. At the same time we shouldn’t condemn the
use of agrochemicals. A moderate increase in agrochemical use
can certainly have tremendous benefits.”  “Of course we need better agronomic practices. But
agronomic practices cannot substitute for better seeds. There is
mounting evidence that small farmers can benefit tremendously
and GMO crops can add to poverty reduction.”  “There are 400 million farms smaller than just a few
hectares that depend on agriculture. That shouldn’t lead us to
romanticize subsistence farming. We should focus on the small-
farming sector, overcoming subsistence farming.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
