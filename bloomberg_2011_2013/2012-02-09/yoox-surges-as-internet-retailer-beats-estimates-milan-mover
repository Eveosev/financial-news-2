Yoox SpA (YOOX)  surged the most in more than
eight months in Milan trading as 2011 revenue at the online
seller of fashion and luxury goods beat estimates.  The stock rose as much as 11 percent to 10.34 euros as of
10:35 a.m. local time before being halted. That’s the biggest
increase since May 26. Yoox shares have more than doubled since
an initial offering in 2009, giving the distributor of brands
including Diesel and Valentino a market value of 563.1 million
euros ($748.6 million).  “We continue to believe Yoox is strategically positioned
at the confluence of two long-term structural growth trends: the
expansion of Internet retail and the growth in sales of  luxury
goods  due to rising global wealth levels,” Karen Hooi, an
analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., wrote in a note today. Yoox
is on Goldman’s “conviction buy” list.  Revenue rose 36 percent to 291.2 million euros last year,
according to preliminary results released by the Bologna-based
company yesterday. Analysts had expected sales of 284.5 million
euros, according to Bloomberg estimates. The company said that
 North America  has become its largest market.  CA Cheuvreux increased its recommendation on the stock to
“outperform” from “underperform,” citing better-than-
expected sales in the fourth quarter, with Italy and  Europe 
“nearly keeping pace with the third quarter and accelerating
elsewhere.” The brokerage said the “strong top line might help
margins.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
