The following is the text of
the new house  price index  report for December released by
 Statistics Canada .  The New Housing Price Index (NHPI) rose 0.1% in
December, following a 0.3% increase in November.  Evolution of the New Housing Price Index  The metropolitan regions of Toronto and Oshawa, and
 Montreal  were the top contributors to the increase in
December. The positive impact of these metropolitan
regions on the overall index was offset in part by
decreases observed in  Vancouver  and in Hamilton.  Between November and December, Toronto and Oshawa
(+0.4%) posted the largest monthly price advance, followed
by Montreal and Quebec (both +0.3%).  In Toronto and Oshawa, price increases were primarily
the result of good market conditions and increased land
values.  In Montreal, good market conditions were reported as
the main reason for the rise in prices while in  Quebec ,
some builders reported that higher material and labour
costs contributed to the increase.  In December, prices were unchanged in 12 of the 21
metropolitan regions surveyed.  Monthly price declines were recorded in Hamilton 
(-0.3%) and Vancouver (-0.2%).  The declines observed in both Hamilton and Vancouver
were the result of some builders reporting lower
negotiated selling prices.  Year over year, the NHPI was up 2.5%, the same increase
as in the previous two months. The main contributor to
this advance was the metropolitan region of Toronto and
Oshawa.  Toronto and Oshawa post the highest year-over-year price
increase  The largest year-over-year price increases were
recorded in Toronto and Oshawa (+6.3%), Regina (+5.3%) and
Winnipeg (+4.6%).  Other notable year-over-year increases in contractors'
selling prices were observed in Kitchener-Cambridge-
Waterloo (+3.7%) and Charlottetown (+3.5%).  Among the 21 metropolitan regions surveyed, 4 posted 12-
month price declines in December, with Victoria (-1.6%)
posting the largest decrease.  To contact the reporter on this story:
