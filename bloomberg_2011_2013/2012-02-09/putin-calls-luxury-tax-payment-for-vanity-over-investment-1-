Russia’s plan to tax  luxury goods 
would serve as a levy on “vanity” purchases made at the
expense of investment, Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  said.  “It should be something like a publicly recognized payment
for refusing to invest in development in favor of unrestrained
consumption and vanity,” Putin said today at a meeting in
Moscow of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs,
a lobby group for big business.  Putin, who is running for president in a March 4 election,
proposed the tax during a speech at a congress of his United
Russia party in November. The government has already decided to
implement it and is trying to create a list of goods such as
“superyachts” and “supercars” that would be included, Putin
told supporters on Feb. 7.  “Let’s not exaggerate the fiscal significance of this
tax,” Putin said today, adding that it shouldn’t affect the
middle class, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
