The dollar strengthened against 14 of
its 16 major peers as declines in Asian equities boosted demand
for the U.S. currency as a haven.  The greenback rose 0.2 percent to 77.16 yen as of 11:32
a.m. in  Tokyo  and was little changed at $1.3256 per euro. The
MSCI Asia Pacific Index of shares fell as much as 1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
