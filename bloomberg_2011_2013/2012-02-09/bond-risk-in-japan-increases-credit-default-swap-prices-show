The cost of protecting bonds in  Japan 
against non-payment rose, according to credit-default swap
traders.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index climbed 5 basis points to
144.5 as of 9:43 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices show. The
gauge is set for its first increase since Jan. 30, according to
data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan increased 2 basis points to 161 as of
9:08 a.m. in Singapore, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices
show. The benchmark is also on course for its first rise since
Jan. 30, according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated
market.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index was little changed at 142
basis points as of 11:30 a.m. in Sydney, according to Westpac
Banking Corp.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
