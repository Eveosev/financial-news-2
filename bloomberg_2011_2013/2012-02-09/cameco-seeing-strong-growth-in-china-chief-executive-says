Cameco Corp. (CCJ) , the world’s largest
uranium producer, is seeing “strong growth” in nuclear reactor
construction in China, Chief Executive Officer Tim Gitzel said  “China is becoming the leader of the world” for nuclear
energy, Gitzel, who was in Beijing today as part of the business
delegation traveling with Canadian Prime Minister  Stephen Harper ,
said in an interview. Gitzel said Cameco seeks to discuss
partnerships with Chinese companies on the possibility of
jointly developing uranium projects in China, Canada and other
countries. He said there were no deals yet to announce  Harper and Chinese Vice Premier Li Keqiang announced an
agreement in Beijing today that will give Canadian uranium
producers more access to China’s civilian nuclear power industry.
China, the world’s biggest energy user and its largest polluter,
has sought to secure uranium supplies as it searches for cleaner
alternatives to coal, which currently fuels more than 70 percent
of the nation’s electricity production.  Globally, Gitzel said he expected uranium demand to grow
about 3 percent a year in the “next few years.” The
“psychological” impact of the Fukushima nuclear accident in
 Japan  will be in the “short- to medium-term,” he said.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
