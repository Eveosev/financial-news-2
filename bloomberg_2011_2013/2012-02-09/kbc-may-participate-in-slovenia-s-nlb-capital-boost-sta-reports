KBC Groep NV (KBC)  may participate in the
capital increase of Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d. STA newswire
reported, citing Jan Vanhevel, the chief executive officer of
the Belgian banking and insurance company.  “We may participate if there is more added value, which
means more capital and more profit,” Vanhevel said in Brussels
today, according to the Slovenian newswire.  NLB as the Ljubljana-based lender is known, wants to raise
400 million euros ($531 million) of equity capital by mid-2012
to improve its capital ratio as demanded by Slovenia’s central
bank. Slovenia’s biggest lender will probably report a loss for
a third-consecutive year, according to Bozo Jasovic, the
outgoing chief executive officer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
