India ’s rupee fell to the lowest
level in more than a week after a stall in Greek negotiations
raised concern Europe’s debt crisis will slow global growth,
sapping demand for emerging-market assets.  Overseas funds cut  holdings  of Indian bonds by $200 million
in the two weeks through Feb. 7, exchange data show. Greek
negotiations stumbled over pension cuts, threatening to scuttle
a 130 billion-euro ($172 billion) rescue package. The rupee has
advanced 7.2 percent this year after dropping 16 percent in
2011.  “A deal in  Greece  will be important for the rupee rally to
continue,” said  Roy Paul , deputy general manager of treasury at
Federal Bank Ltd. in Mumbai. “Though some silver linings are
emerging from Europe, we will have to wait and watch.”  The rupee declined 0.7 percent to 49.5050 per dollar in
Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched
49.5287 earlier, the lowest level since Feb. 1.  The rupee also weakened as Commerce Secretary  Rahul Khullar 
said in New Delhi India’s trade deficit widened to a three-month
high of $14.7 billion in January.  Three-month onshore forwards traded at 50.53 a dollar,
compared with 50.16 yesterday, while offshore non-deliverable
rupee forwards were at 50.50 from 50.13. Forwards are agreements
to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable
contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
