Economic confidence in the euro area
rose in the first quarter after two consecutive declines, led by
an improvement of expectations for the next six months, the  Ifo
research institute  said, citing a survey.  An index measuring the economic climate in the 17-nation
euro region increased to 84.8 from 83.7 in the fourth quarter,
the Munich-based institute said in an e-mailed statement today.
A gauge of current conditions fell to 109.1 from 128.7, while an
indicator measuring expectations rose to 70.5 from 57.4.  “The indicator is still well under its long-term
average,” Ifo said. “Ireland, Luxembourg and Slovenia were the
only countries with positive expectations.”  While uncertainty over a way out of the debt crisis has
undermined the recovery, European services and factory output
strengthened in January. European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  has said 2012 will be a “much better” year.  Euro-area inflation will average 2.3 percent this year, the
288 economic analysts surveyed said. The participants expect a
further loosening of the ECB’s monetary policy in the next six
months, according to the report.  Ifo will publish its World Economic Survey on Feb 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
