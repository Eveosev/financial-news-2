Henkel AG (HEN3) , the German maker of
industrial adhesives, is marketing an 800 million-euro ($1.1
billion) revolving credit, according to two people with direct
knowledge of the deal.  The five-year loan, which includes two one-year extension
options, will pay initial interest of 40 basis points more than
the London interbank offered rate, one of the people said, who
declined to be identified because the terms are private.
 Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  and  Citigroup Inc. (C)  are coordinating the loan,
the people said.  Henkel will pay additional utilization fees of as much as
25 basis points if more than one-third of the facility is used,
and 37.5 basis points for more than two-thirds. There will also
be a 50 basis-point premium to borrow in dollars. A basis point
is 0.01 percentage point.  The loan will replace a 1.4 billion-euro revolving credit
maturing in April, the people said. The facility was signed in
2005 and paid interest of 17.5 basis points more than benchmark
rates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Henkel has  investment-grade  rankings of A2 from Moody’s
Investors Service, A from Standard & Poor’s and A from  Fitch
Ratings , according to Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
