Grain exports from the French port of
Rouen,  Europe ’s biggest cereal-shipping hub, dropped 39 percent
in the week through yesterday as wheat shipments to North Africa
fell to the lowest in four weeks.  Outbound grain was 105,609 metric tons between Feb. 2 and
Feb. 8 from 171,966 tons, the  Seine River port  said in an e-
mailed report today. Exports included 78,645 tons of soft wheat.  Algeria was the biggest export destination, taking 24,500
tons of soft wheat and 23,750 tons of barley, compared with
76,500 tons of wheat shipped the previous week. Cameroon was the
second-biggest client with 31,650 tons of wheat.  Rouen accounted for 45 percent of  France ’s maritime grain
exports in 2009-10, ahead of La Pallice on the Bay of Biscay,
which shipped out 19 percent, according to figures from national
crops office FranceAgriMer.  Rouen grain loadings by destination, in tons:  To contact the reporter on this story:
