Petroleos de Venezuela SA , the state
oil company, posted a record annual revenue of $127.8 billion in
2011, Venezuelan Oil Minister  Rafael Ramirez  said.  That compares with revenue of $94.9 billion in 2010,
Ramirez said today on state television. PDVSA, as the Caracas-
based company is known, is using loans to finance its investment
plan of about $15 billion a year and pays expenses with  cash
flow , he said, without providing additional financial results.  “When a company like Petrobras takes on new debt, everyone
is happy,” Ramirez said, referring to Brazil’s state-controlled
 Petroleo Brasileiro SA. (PETR4)  “But they criticize us when we do. We
get loans because our company is strong. The  China Development
Bank , for example, has a very rigorous way of qualifying a
company for a loan.”  President  Hugo Chavez  has tapped PDVSA to finance his
social programs while missing production targets set in 2006.
PDVSA, which Ramirez says produces 3 million barrels a day, now
expects to pump 4 million barrels by 2014, down from an earlier
target of 5.8 million barrels by 2012.  PDVSA, along with minority joint venture partners, will
need to spend $236 billion through 2018 to develop the heavy
crude fields of the Orinoco belt in eastern  Venezuela , Ramirez
said on Feb. 7.  Debt Surge  PDVSA’s  total debt  surged 40 percent in 2011 from a year
earlier to $34.9 billion after issuing more than $10 billion
last year in dollar-denominated bonds, the company said in a
statement on Jan. 20.  The record revenue posted in 2011 came amid the highest
average annual price in Venezuela’s history. Venezuela’s oil
 export basket  price averaged $101.06 a barrel last year compared
with $71.97 in 2010, according to the Oil Ministry. PDVSA posted
revenue of $126 billion in 2008.  Venezuela is working to expand ties with Brazil on a
refinery project. It has until March 31 to finalize loan
guarantees required by  Brazil ’s National Development Bank for
PDVSA to join the Pernambuco refinery being developed with
Petrobras, Ramirez said.  PDVSA wants to more than double exports to  China  from
460,000 barrels a day to 1 million barrels in 2015 and plans to
construct three refineries in the Asian country to process crude
from the Orinoco belt, said Ramirez. Venezuela doesn’t give
China discounts for oil and charges a higher price than it
receives for oil exported to the U.S., he said.  “There are a lot of buyers for crude from the Orinoco
belt,” said Ramirez. “It sells like hot bread.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
