Greece  must pass its latest austerity
package into law and identify 325 million euros in spending cuts
before euro-area governments endorse a second bailout for the
country, Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  said.  “Despite the important progress achieved over the last days 
we didn’t yet have all necessary elements on the table to take 
decisions today,” Juncker said in Brussels after chairing an 
emergency meeting of euro-area finance ministers.  Greek politicial leaders must also back the pact and
provide assurances it will be carried through after forthcoming
elections, Juncker said. European finance ministers will meet
again next week.  “In short: no disbursement before implementation,” Juncker
said.  The finance ministers will meet again on Feb. 15, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
