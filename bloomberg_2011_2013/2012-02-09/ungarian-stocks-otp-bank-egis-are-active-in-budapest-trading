Hungary’s benchmark BUX stock index
fell 1.4 percent to 19,453.71 as of the close in Budapest.  The following are among the most active equities in the
Hungarian market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Egis Nyrt. (EGIS)  , the Hungarian drugmaker owned by
Laboratoires Servier, declined the most in a month after
reporting late yesterday its fiscal first-quarter revenue
dropped. The shares fell 4.3 percent to 16,750 forint.  OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP)  , Hungary’s largest lender, fell 1.8
percent to 4,060 forint on concern the liquidation of a state-
owned airline will widen the government’s deficit, damping
demand for the country’s stocks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
