The Dutch hog population fell for the
first time in six years, shrinking 0.8 percent in December from
a year earlier, while the cattle herd diminished a second year
in a row, the Netherlandsâ€™ statistics office said.  The pig herd, the sixth-biggest in the European Union,
declined to 12.1 million animals as of Dec. 1 from 12.2 million
hogs a year earlier, the Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek
 reported  on its website today.  Germany  has the biggest EU hog population, followed by
 Spain ,  Poland ,  France ,  Denmark  and the Netherlands, Eurostat
 data  show.  The cattle herd in the Netherlands decreased to 3.91
million head from 3.96 million, the statistics office said in a
