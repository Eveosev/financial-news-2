Cotton production in  Australia , the
world’s third-biggest shipper, may drop as much as 8.2 percent
as farms are inundated in the nation’s east, harming crops and
curbing output, according to a producers’ group.  Output may be 4.5 million bales to 4.6 million bales, said
Cotton Australia Chief Executive Officer Adam Kay. That compares
with a prior estimate of about 4.9 million bales, he said.  Flooding in Queensland and the neighboring state of New
South Wales may have caused A$50 million ($54 million) of damage,
the federal government said last week. A reduced cotton harvest
may curb global supplies, helping boost prices that tumbled 37
percent last year. Output may surge 25 percent to a record 5
million bales after floods last year boosted water supplies and
spurred plantings, the group said in November.  “We’re seeing about 400,000 bales lost,” Kay said by
phone from Sydney today, adding there could be more damage as
floodwaters move downstream. “We’re really just after warm, dry
conditions to help the crop that’s left.”  About 20,000 hectares (49,421 acres) of irrigated cotton
and 20,000 hectares of dryland crops have been lost due to the
flooding, he said. The deluge may damage as much as 10 percent
of the cotton crop,  Olam International Ltd. (OLAM)  said on Feb. 6.  Cotton for March delivery gained 0.4 percent to 94 cents a
pound on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York  at 3:35 p.m. in  Singapore .
Prices have advanced 2.4 percent this year. The harvest in
Australia begins about March.  To contact the reporter for this story:
