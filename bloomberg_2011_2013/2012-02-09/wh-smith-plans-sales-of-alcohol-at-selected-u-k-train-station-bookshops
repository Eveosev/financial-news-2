WH Smith Plc (SMWH) , a U.K. book retailer
and stationer with more than 1,100 stores, plans to widen sales
of alcoholic drinks to its outlets at railway stations.  The company is broadening its range of products and will
sell alcohol “to meet the needs of customers on the move,” the
Swindon, England-based retailer said today in an e-mail.  WH Smith operates more than 560 shops, which it calls
travel stores, at train stations, airports, hospitals,
workplaces and motorway service stations, according to its
 website . The company’s Liverpool Street rail station bookshop in
London’s financial district is seeking a license to sell
alcohol, according to an advertisement yesterday in the Evening
Standard newspaper, which didn’t specify the products that would
be on offer.  The retailer plans “a convenience range of alcoholic
drinks in a selected number of WH Smith mainline rail-station
stores,” building on a “small number” of travel stores that
already sell the products, the company said.  WH Smith’s total group sales fell 3 percent, and revenue at
outlets open at least a year declined 5 percent for the 21 weeks
to Jan. 21, the retailer  said  Jan. 25. The travel stores
outperformed the group with a total-sales increase of 2 percent
and like-for-like revenue decline of 3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
