Lions Gate Entertainment Corp ., the
independent studio behind “The Hunger Games” teen adventure
movies, reported third-quarter revenue that declined more than
analysts predicted after releasing no hit in the holiday period.  Sales fell 24 percent to $323 million, the company, run
from  Santa Monica ,  California , said today in a statement.
Analysts  anticipated  $358.4 million, the average of predictions
compiled by Bloomberg.  There were no major releases from the studio, compared with
four films a year earlier.  Lions Gate  distributed two Spanish-
language films in the quarter as the studio geared up for the
March 23 release of “The Hunger Games,” the first of four
planned movies based on the best-selling novels by Suzanne
Collins.  Net loss in the period ended Dec. 31 narrowed to $1.74
million, or 1 cent a share, compared with a net loss of $6.02
million, or 4 cents, the Vancouver-based company said.  Lions Gate last month agreed to acquire  Summit
Entertainment , maker of the “Twilight” films, a franchise that
has generated $2.5 billion in global ticket sales, according to
researcher Box Office Mojo’s data. The final movie in the series
is scheduled to reach theaters in November.  Lions Gate bought Summit for $412.5 million, most of it
financed with the target company’s cash, plus assumed debt. The
company named Summit’s two top executives, Rob Friedman and
Patrick Wachsberger, to lead its film division.  To contact the reporter on this story:
