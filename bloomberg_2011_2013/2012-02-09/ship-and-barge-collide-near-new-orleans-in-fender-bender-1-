A collision of a tanker and a barge
in the  Mississippi River  near  New Orleans  yesterday didn’t cause
a spill or block traffic, according to the U.S. Coast Guard.  The incident at about 6:14 p.m. local time involved the
tanker Asian Spirit and a barge pushed by the tug Secretariat,
Petty Officer Steve Lehmann, a spokesman for the Coast Guard
based in New Orleans, said in a telephone interview today.  “We have some investigators going to the scene right now,
but it’s just looking like a fender bender,” Lehman said.  The Asian Spirit, a 269-meter (883-foot) vessel owned by
 Teekay Corp. (TK) , is registered in the Bahamas and was bound for
Cristobal, Panama, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
Secretariat is owned by RP/PHL Marine Leasing LLC, the data
showed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
