Telefonos de Mexico SAB, the fixed-
line unit of  America Movil SAB (AMXL) , said fourth-quarter profit
climbed 21 percent as demand from business customers helped
blunt the blow of customer losses.  Net income  rose to 4.09 billion pesos ($322 million), or 23
centavos a share, from 3.37 billion pesos, or 19 centavos, a
year earlier, according to a statement yesterday. Sales gained
4.2 percent to 29.1 billion pesos.  Telmex (TELMEXL)  is pushing into the market for information
technology projects for corporate customers while rivals such as
Grupo Televisa SAB lure away phone customers. Billionaire  Carlos Slim ’s America Movil owns 93 percent of Telmex after paying $4.6
billion in November for the Telmex shares it didn’t already own.  Revenue from data services rose 26 percent to 10.3 billion
pesos because of sales associated with a security and
information-technology project and from services to
corporations, Telmex said.  The fixed-line unit lost about 313,000 lines in the
quarter, its biggest drop in two years. It closed 2011 with 14.8
million phone lines and 8 million high-speed Internet
connections.  America Movil  is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results
today after the close of trading.  Telmex, which represents about 16 percent of America
Movil’s sales, was unchanged at 10.10 pesos at 10:10 a.m. in
Mexico City. America Movil climbed 0.8 percent to 15.66 pesos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
