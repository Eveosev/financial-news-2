Asian currencies declined after Greek
debt negotiations stalled and faster inflation in  China  tempered
speculation the region’s central banks will ease monetary policy
to shore up economic growth.  Indonesia’s rupiah led declines after the central bank
unexpectedly cut borrowing costs. Greek leaders failed to agree
on some economic measures required to win more financial aid.
Data showed today consumer prices in China rose 4.5 percent last
month from a year earlier, after December’s 4.1 percent gain,
exceeding all 33 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  “The lack of progress in  Greece  disappoints investors and
is bad for  market sentiment ,” said Banny Lam, a Hong Kong-based
economist at CCB International Securities Ltd., a unit of
China’s second-largest bank.  The rupiah dropped 0.4 percent to 8,971 per dollar as of
5:10 p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg.  India ’s rupee slid 0.4 percent to 49.3425.
The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar  Index (ADXY) , which tracks the 10
most-traded regional currencies excluding the yen, fell 0.2
percent.  Greek Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  summoned the debt-
stricken nation’s creditors for more talks today to resolve a
dispute over pension cuts needed to secure a 130 billion-euro
($172 billion) rescue package.  China’s yuan fell 0.01 percent to 6.2952 per dollar in
Shanghai, according to China Foreign Exchange Trade System. In
Hong Kong’s offshore market, the currency declined 0.08 percent
to 6.2915.  Korea Holds Rates  Chinese “authorities are likely to want to refrain from
too much easing too soon that could negate recent efforts to
cool the  property market ,” said Sim Moh Siong, a currency
strategist at Bank of Singapore Ltd.  South Korea’s won was little changed at 1,115.73, after
dropping as much as 0.5 percent earlier.  The Bank of Korea held
its seven-day repurchase rate at 3.25 percent today, unchanged
for an eighth straight month, as the economy slowed and exports
declined due to the European debt crisis.  The rupiah slipped by the most in more than two weeks after
 Bank Indonesia  cut its benchmark  reference rate  to 5.75 percent
from 6 percent. Four of 15 analysts predicted the cut, while 11
forecast no change in a Bloomberg survey.  Malaysia’s ringgit was little changed even as government
reports today showed exports grew 6.1 percent in December, the
slowest pace in seven months. A central bank report on Feb. 15
may show the economy expanded 4.9 percent in 2011 from 7.2
percent in 2010, according to economists in another Bloomberg
 survey . The currency traded at 3.0083 per dollar, compared with
3.0078 yesterday.  Elsewhere, Taiwan’s dollar gained 0.1 percent to NT$29.495
versus the greenback. The  Thai baht  strengthened 0.1 percent to
30.73 and the Philippine peso was steady at 42.205.  To contact the reporter on this story:
