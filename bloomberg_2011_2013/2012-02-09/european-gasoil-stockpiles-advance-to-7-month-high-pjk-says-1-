Gasoil stockpiles in independent
storage rose to a seven-month high in  Europe ’s Amsterdam-
Rotterdam-Antwerp oil-trading hub, according to PJK
International BV.  Inventories of gasoil, which include heating oil and
diesel, increased 9.1 percent to 2.78 million metric tons in the
week to today as cargoes of diesel arrived from the U.S.,
according to PJK. That’s the most since June 30.  “Heating oil demand generally will continue to slow,”
even after a cold snap in Europe increased consumption over the
last two weeks, Pieter Kulsen, founder of PJK, said by phone
from Breda in the Netherlands.  Gasoline (ARASGSLN)  stockpiles fell 3.1 percent to 796,000 tons as
cargoes were shipped to West Africa and  Mexico , the data showed.
Shipments to the U.S., Europe’s main export market, will likely
drop because of “slow” demand, Kulsen said.  Stockpiles of  fuel oil  increased 1.5 percent to 771,000
tons as cargoes arrived from  France ,  Poland ,  Russia  and the U.K.
Freezing temperatures have boosted the use of fuel oil for power
generation this week, Kulsen said.  Jet-fuel inventories dropped 6.3 percent to 591,000 tons
from the week earlier. Naphtha supplies decreased 13 percent to
48,000 tons.  The following table shows the weekly inventory changes in
thousands of tons for gasoline, naphtha, fuel oil and jet fuel
in independent storage in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
