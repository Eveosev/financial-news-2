Ethanol futures advanced for a fourth
day in  Chicago  on speculation that negative profit margins will
curtail output and the biofuel’s discount to gasoline will
increase demand.  Futures gained a day after an Energy Department report
showed production plunged to the lowest in 11 weeks and as
ethanol’s discount to gasoline, with which it is blended,
expanded to 78.18 cents, more than triple the average for the
past year.  “It’s really a dead-cat bounce,” said Ian Jackson, a
trader at SCB & Associates LLC in Chicago. “Margins can’t stay
negative forever. The discount to gasoline is almost at a
dollar.”  Denatured ethanol for March delivery increased 0.7 cent, or
0.3 percent, to $2.231 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the highest price since Jan. 11. Prices are down 9.2 percent
from a year earlier.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  rose 2.5 cents,
or 1.1 percent, to $2.29 a gallon and in Chicago the additive
gained 2 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $2.19, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol on the West Coast jumped 1.5 cents, or 0.7 percent,
to $2.315 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the biofuel added 1
cent, or 0.5 percent, to $2.255.  Production (DOETFETH)  in the U.S. fell 1.7 percent to 923,000 barrels
a day last week, the steepest decline since Jan. 6, and the
lowest level since Nov. 18, an Energy Department report showed
today.  Distillers are losing 9 cents per gallon of ethanol, based
on current prices for corn and the biofuel and assuming a bushel
of corn generates 2.75 gallons of ethanol, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Ethanol is blended into gasoline to
stretch supply and meet federal mandates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
