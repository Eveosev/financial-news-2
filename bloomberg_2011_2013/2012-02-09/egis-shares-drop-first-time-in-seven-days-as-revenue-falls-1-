Egis Nyrt. (EGIS) , the Hungarian drugmaker
owned by Laboratoires Servier, declined the most in a month
after reporting late yesterday its fiscal first quarter revenue
dropped.  The shares fell 4.3 percent to 16,750 forint by the end of
trading in Budapest, the biggest drop on a closing basis since
Jan. 5.  Egis’s sales in the October-December period totaled 30.4
billion forint ($138.9 million), falling 4.8 percent from a year
earlier. Net profit rose 14 percent as a result of a foreign-
exchange gain and lower costs, the company said in a statement
on the website of the Budapest Stock Exchange after the market
close.  The earnings release may put pressure on the stock today as
“top line was missing consensus,” Gergely Palffy, an analyst
at KBC Securities in Budapest, wrote in a research report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
