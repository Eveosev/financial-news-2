Hermes International SCA (RMS) , the French
maker of Birkin bags and silk scarves, reported full-year sales
that exceeded analysts’ estimates and said operating margin will
exceed 30 percent.  Revenue climbed 18 percent to 2.84 billion euros ($3.78
billion) in 2011, the Paris-based company said today in a
statement. That compares with the 2.81 billion-euro average of
16 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales growth was
driven by the Americas and Asia excluding Japan, Hermes said.  LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC) , the luxury-goods maker
which owns a 22.4 percent stake in Hermes, has said it sees no
sign that a softening economic climate is causing a slowdown in
 Europe . Hermes isn’t too worried about the fallout from the
region’s debt crisis as it has more orders than it can fulfill,
Chief Executive Officer  Patrick Thomas  has said.  “Hermes will continue to invest in developing its
production capacity and its distribution network, with the
opening or renovation of some 15 branches” in 2012, the company
said in a statement today.  Hermes will pay a dividend of 1.50 euros a share on March
1, the company said.  Hermes, whose revenue gains have been hampered by capacity
constraints, plans to build two leather factories in France in
2012 to cope with surging demand. This year’s sales growth in
the Americas, Hermes second-fastest expanding market, will at
least match 2011’s pace, CEO Thomas said in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
