Cencosud SA (CENCOSUD) ,  Chile ’s biggest retailer
by sales, has no plans to sell new stock beyond the amount
approved by shareholders last year, said a person with direct
knowledge of the matter.  A final decision on the timing and amount of the sale
hasn’t been made after shareholders approved in April the sale
of as many as 270 million new shares over three years, said the
person, who declined to be identified because the board’s
decision is pending.  Cencosud fell 3.3 percent to 2,931.6 pesos in Santiago
yesterday, the steepest decline since Nov. 17, after La Tercera
reported that the company already decided to raise $1.5 billion
in a separate transaction to the one approved last year. At
yesterday’s closing price, the 270 million shares would fetch
$1.66 billion.  Once the board decides to proceed with the share sale it
would need shareholders’ authorization to set the amount of
shares and the sale price. A Cencosud public relations
representative declined to comment on the plans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
