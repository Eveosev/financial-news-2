Soybean growers in  Brazil , the
world’s second-largest producer after the U.S., will harvest
less than previously estimated after a drought in the country’s
south parched crops, the government said.  Growers will harvest 69.2 million metric tons of soybeans
in the crop year that started Sept. 1, less than the 71.8
million tons estimated on Jan. 10, Conab, the government’s crop-
forecasting agency, said in an e-mailed statement today.  The La Nina weather pattern has triggered excessive heat
and dryness in parts of Brazil, Argentina and Mexico, in past
months, damaging crops.  Corn producers in Brazil, the world’s third-largest grower,
will harvest 60.8 million tons of the grain in the current crop
year. The forecast was raised from 59.2 million estimated
previously.  Brazil produced 57.4 million tons of corn and 75.3 million
tons of soybeans in the previous crop year.  The South American country’s corn output trails production
in the U.S. and  China .  To contact the reporter on this story:
