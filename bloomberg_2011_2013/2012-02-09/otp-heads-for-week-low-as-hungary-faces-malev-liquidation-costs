OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) ,  Hungary ’s largest
lender, dropped to the lowest in more than a week on concern the
liquidation of a state-owned airline will widen the government’s
deficit, damping demand for the country’s stocks.  The shares fell 1.8 percent to 4,060 forint. The benchmark
BUX stock index, in which OTP has a 29 percent weighting,
declined 1.4 percent by the close in Budapest.  The government may be forced to pay “several hundred
billion forint” to Budapest Airport in compensation as it moves
to wind up carrier Malev Zrt., the Development Ministry said in
an e-mailed response to questions late yesterday.  “There is some uncertainty regarding the Budapest Airport
case,” Zoltan Reczey, an analyst at Buda-Cash Brokerhaz Zrt.,
said in a telephone interview today. “There is a risk the
potential budget expenditure will be significant,” which may
explain the “underperformance” of OTP’s stock, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
