China ’s five-year plan to slow
domestic production of grain-based ethanol will mean tighter
supplies of a byproduct used for  animal feed , boosting demand
for imports through 2016, the U.S. Grains Council said.  Imports of the byproduct, called  dried  distiller’s grain,
from the U.S. may rise to 6 million metric tons in four years,
almost double the 3.1 million tons imported in the 2009-2010
marketing year, according to research conducted by Shanghai JC
Intelligence Co., the grains council said in a report today.
Imported U.S. feed will account for about 42 percent of expected
total consumption in China, JC Intelligence said.  China, the world’s second-largest corn consumer, announced
an anti-dumping investigation last year that slowed imports of
U.S. feed made from ethanol, the council said in the report. The
results of that study will not result in barriers to future
purchases from the U.S., the world’s leading producer and
exporter, the group said.  The U.S. Grains Council, based in Washington, is funded by
the industry and the government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
