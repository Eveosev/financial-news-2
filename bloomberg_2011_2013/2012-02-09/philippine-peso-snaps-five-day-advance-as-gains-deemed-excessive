Philippine 10-year bonds rose,
pushing yields to a record low, on speculation slowing money-
supply growth supports the case for another interest-rate cut.
The peso touched a six-month high.  Money-supply (PHMS3YOY)  increased 6.3 percent in December from a year
earlier, the least since July 2008, data showed yesterday.
Inflation eased to a 13-month low of 3.9 percent in January,
affirming that the central bank has “policy space should the
need to support growth persist,” Governor  Amando Tetangco  said
on Feb. 7. The nation deserves an investment-grade debt rating,
President  Benigno Aquino ’s spokesman Ricky Carandang said
yesterday.  “The latest money-supply data supports speculation for
another rate cut,” said Speedy Delfino, a fixed-income trader
at East West Banking Corp. in Manila. “The government knows it
has to achieve faster-than-average growth to win rating
upgrades.”  The yield on the benchmark 10-year peso bonds fell six
basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 5.08 percent,
according to midday fixing prices at Philippine Dealing &
Exchange Corp. That’s the lowest level since October 1998 when
Bloomberg began collecting the data.  The peso closed little changed at 42.205 per dollar, from
42.220 yesterday, according to Tullett Prebon Plc. The currency
touched 42.090, the strongest level since Aug. 2, 2011.  Bangko Sentral (PPCBON)  ng Pilipinas cut its overnight borrowing
rate to 4.25 percent from 4.5 percent on Jan. 19, the first
reduction in more than two years. The next policy meeting will
be on March 1.  Gross domestic product  increased 3.7 percent in
2011, a two-year low, compared with a revised 7.6 percent gain a
year earlier, official data showed Jan. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
