Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , owner of
the worldâ€™s largest refining complex, is marketing a 10-year
bond denominated in U.S. dollars, according to a person familiar
with the matter.  The Reg S senior, unsecured notes are being offered to
investors to yield about 365 basis points more than similar-
maturity Treasuries, the person said, asking not to be
identified because the details are private.  A Mumbai-based spokesman for Reliance, who asked not to be
named citing company policy, declined to comment on the
securities when contacted by phone today.  Barclays Plc, Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc.,  HSBC
Holdings Plc (HSBA)  and UBS AG are managing the benchmark-sized sale of
notes, which could price as early as today, the person said.
Benchmark typically means at least $500 million.  Reliance last sold dollar bonds in October 2010, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The yield on those 4.5 percent
notes due 2020 rose 16 basis points to 5.23 percent as of 1:50
