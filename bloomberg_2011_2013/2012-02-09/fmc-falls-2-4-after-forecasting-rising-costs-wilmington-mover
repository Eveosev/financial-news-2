FMC Corp., (FMC)  a Philadelphia-based maker
of specialty chemical and agricultural products, fell the most
in more than a month after forecasting a rise in some operating
costs.  FMC fell 2.4 percent to $92.80 at the close in  New York ,
the biggest  drop  since Dec. 28. The shares touched a 52-week
high of $95.58 yesterday.  The company’s specialty chemicals unit will have unchanged
earnings in the first quarter compared with a year earlier as
increased prices are offset by higher raw material and energy
costs, FMC said in a release issued after the close of regular
U.S. trading yesterday.  “Operationally, the guidance was not in line with what
most analysts were looking for,” Michael Harrison, an analyst
with First Analysis Securities Corp. in Chicago who rates the
shares “overweight,” said in a phone interview today.  FMC sells industrial chemicals and agricultural products,
including  lithium carbonate , an ingredient in lithium batteries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
