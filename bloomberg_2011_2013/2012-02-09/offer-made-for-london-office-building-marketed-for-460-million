An offer was  made  for Woolgate
Exchange, a City of London office block leased to German bank
WestLB AG, after it was put on the market in October for 290
million pounds ($460 million).  “An offer to purchase the property has been received and
discussions with the prospective purchaser are ongoing,”
according to an Irish Stock Exchange filing by loan servicer
Capita Asset Services (UK).  In 2006, the building was purchased by Irish investment
company D2 Private Capital for 325 million pounds, according to
a statement on its  website.  A spokesman for D2 Private wasn’t
immediately available for comment.  The loan for D2 Private’s purchase was provided by Anglo
Irish Bank Corp. Plc and the senior tranche was subsequently
acquired by Credit Suisse AG and now it’s part of a commercial
mortgage backed security called Cornerstone Titan 2006-1,
according to a regulatory filing for the security.  Knight Frank LLP and Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. are the
brokers for the property, the stock exchange announcement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
