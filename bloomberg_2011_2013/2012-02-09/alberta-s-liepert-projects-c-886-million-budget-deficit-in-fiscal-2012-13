The province of  Alberta  will post a
deficit of C$886 million ($890 million) in the fiscal year that
begins Apr. 1, compared with a C$1.3 billion deficit in the
previous year, Finance Minister Ronald Liepert said today.  The province will post a shortfall of C$1.3 billion in the
year that ends March 31, and will swing to a surplus of C$952
million in 2013-14, Liepert said. The fiscal plan is based on
projections of 3.8 percent economic growth in 2012, and an oil
price that will average $99.25 per barrel for West Texas
Intermediate crude.  The province has no plans to issue debt in the next fiscal
year, the budget document shows, with the deficit to be covered
by drawing down the province’s stabilization fund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
