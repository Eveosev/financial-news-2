The  FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index (JALSH) 
declined for the third time in four days, sliding 0.2 percent to
34,152.48 by 12:11 p.m. in Johannesburg.  The following are among the most active equities in the
South African market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Anglo American Plc (AGL)  , the diversified miner that
accounts for 9 percent of the benchmark index, fell 1 percent to
344.50 rand. Copper swung between gains and losses as investors
weighed tightening global stockpiles, stalled talks over a Greek
bailout and possible limits on Chinese easing after inflation
unexpectedly accelerated in January.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BIL)  , the world’s biggest miner,
dropped 1.9 percent to 255.40 rand.  Aquarius Platinum Ltd. (AQP)  , the fourth-biggest
platinum miner, slid to its lowest in more than a month,
dropping 3.6 percent to 19.50 rand. The company swung to a loss
of $113.5 million in the six months ended December from a profit
of $94.3 million a year earlier.  Optimum Coal Holdings Ltd. (OPT)  , a coal producer,
advanced to its highest in almost two weeks, climbing 1.4
percent to 37 rand. Production and unit cost performance at its
Optimum Collieries is expected to improve in the second half of
its financial year following a “disappointing” first half, the
company said in a results announcement.  Super Group Ltd. (SPG)  (SPG SJ), a transport company, rose for a
second day, adding 1.1 percent to 11.50 rand. The company raised
300 million rand ($40 million) in loan facilities, it said in a
regulatory filing late yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
