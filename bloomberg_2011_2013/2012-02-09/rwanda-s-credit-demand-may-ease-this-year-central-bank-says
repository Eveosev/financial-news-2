Rwanda’s credit demand will probably
ease this year as the central bank raised  interest rates  to curb
inflation, Governor Claver Gatete said.  Growth in loans by commercial lenders will probably slow to
16.6 percent from 28.4 percent in 2011, Gatete told reporters in
the capital, Kigali, today.  The Bank of Rwanda raised its benchmark interest rate by 1
percentage point to 7 percent last year to contain inflation,
which accelerated to 8.3 percent in December from 7.4 percent in
the previous month. The inflation rate will probably drop to 7.5
percent by the end of this year, Gatete said.  Rwanda’s government helped to keep inflation under 10
percent by cutting fuel taxes last year, Gatete said. Fuel
accounts for about 40 percent of the increase in consumer
prices, he said.  Finance Minister John Rwangombwa on June 8 lowered fuel
taxes by 100 Rwandan francs ($0.16) a liter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
