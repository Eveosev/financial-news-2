Argentina ’s corn and soybean farmers
will get “moderate” rainfall through Feb. 16 after abundant
downpours aided drought-hit crops this week, the  Buenos Aires
Cereals Exchange  said in an e-mail today.  Hotter weather will return to the southern agricultural
zone next week after recent rains led to a drop in average
temperatures, exchange climatologist Eduardo Sierra said in the
e-mailed weather report.  Most of the region, known as the Pampas, will get between
10 millimeters (0.39 inch) and 25 millimeters of rain, the
exchange said. Some outlying areas of the Pampas will get
downpours exceeding 150 millimeters, Sierra wrote.  Global corn and soybean stockpiles before the next Northern
Hemisphere harvests will be smaller than estimated after dry
weather damaged crops in  South America , the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said in a report today.  Argentina will harvest 22 million tons of corn, down from
26 million estimated in January and 22.5 million collected a
year ago, according to the USDA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
