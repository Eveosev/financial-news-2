AFC Ajax NV (AJAX) , the most successful club
in Dutch soccer history, said its supervisory board will resign
after a dispute among its members including Johan Cruijff over
naming Louis van Gaal as director.  “The supervisory board is prepared to step down as soon as
possible, once successors have been found who’ll have broad
support,” the Amsterdam-based  soccer club  said today in an e-
mailed statement. Tomorrow’s extraordinary shareholders meeting,
where a vote of confidence on the panel was scheduled, will be
canceled, Ajax said.  Last November board members led by Steven ten Have proposed
naming Van Gaal as chairman after they couldn’t agree with
Cruijff on an appointment. The Amsterdam district court said
Feb. 6 that Ajax, a four-time European champion with a record 30
Dutch league titles, can’t appoint Van Gaal and Martin
Sturkenboom as directors because the supervisory board didn’t
allow Cruijff to participate in the decision.  Technical manager Danny Blind and Sturkenboom resigned from
the club, Ajax said in a statement today. Blind won the European
 Champions League  in 1995 as Ajax captain and has held several
management functions at the club.  To contact the reporter on this story:
