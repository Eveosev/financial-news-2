Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) ’s plan to bid for
the right to broadcast German Bundesliga soccer via satellite
may be opposed by a regulator, the  Financial Times Deutschland 
reported, citing Thomas Fuchs, who heads a commission that
oversees such licenses.  The company, partly state-owned, obtained its current
licenses in 2009 because it delegated production and editorial
to  Constantin Medien AG (EV4) , according to Fuchs, the chief of the
ZAK Regulatory Affairs Commission, the newspaper said. Further
licenses might give it too much influence over Constantin Medien
and would require reassessment, Fuchs told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
