The cost for European banks to borrow
in dollars fell for a third day to the lowest level in six
months, according to a money-market indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 67.5
basis points below the euro interbank offered rate at 9 a.m. in
 London , from minus 70 yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. The cost is the lowest since Aug. 5.  The one-year basis swap was 56 basis points less than
Euribor, the cheapest level since Sept. 2. It was minus 56.5
yesterday. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  A measure of European banks’ reluctance to lend to one
another was little changed. The Euribor-OIS spread, the
difference between the borrowing benchmark and overnight indexed
swaps, was 73 basis points in London, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Lenders’  overnight deposits  at the  European Central Bank 
were 495 billion euros ($658 billion) yesterday, unchanged from
Feb. 7, according to the Frankfurt-based ECB.  To contact the reporter on this story:
