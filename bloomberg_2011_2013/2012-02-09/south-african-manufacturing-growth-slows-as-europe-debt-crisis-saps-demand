South African  manufacturing  growth
slowed in December as Europe’s debt crisis curbed demand for
exports to one of the country’s main trading partners.  Factory output rose 2.4 percent from a year earlier, down
from a revised 2.8 percent in November, Pretoria-based
Statistics  South Africa  said on its website today. The  median
estimate  in a Bloomberg survey of six economists was for
production to increase 2.6 percent. Output fell a seasonally
adjusted 1.3 percent in the month.  Europe, which is projected to fall into recession this
year, buys about a third of South Africa’s manufactured exports.
A slump in manufacturing and mining in the third quarter limited
 gross domestic product  growth to an annualized 1.4 percent, the
slowest pace in almost two years.  “The concern is the recession in  Europe ,” Nicky Weimar,
an economist at Nedbank Group Ltd. in Johannesburg, said in a
phone interview today. “I don’t think we’ve felt the full brunt
of it.”  The central bank has kept its benchmark  interest rate  at a
three-decade low of 5.5 percent since November 2010 to support
the economy, even as inflation accelerated to above the 3
percent to 6 percent target in November and December. The bank
will probably maintain its “accommodative” monetary policy
stance, Weimar said.  The rand fell to 7.6421 per dollar at 2:23 p.m. in
Johannesburg, from 7.6271 before the data was released. The
yield on the R157 government bond, due 2015, rose 0.7 percentage
points to 6.64 percent today.  Factory output may have increased in January, with the
purchasing managers’ index climbing to 53.2 from 49.4 in
December, indicating an expansion in production, Kagiso Tiso
Holdings said on Feb. 1.  To contact the reporters on this story:
