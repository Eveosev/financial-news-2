U.S. stocks were little changed as
losses in consumer-discretionary and health-care shares wiped
out early gains triggered by a drop in jobless claims and an
agreement among Greek lawmakers on budget measures needed to
qualify for rescue funds.  The Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index was little changed at
1,349.9 at 9:43 a.m. in  New York  after gaining as much as 0.3
percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
