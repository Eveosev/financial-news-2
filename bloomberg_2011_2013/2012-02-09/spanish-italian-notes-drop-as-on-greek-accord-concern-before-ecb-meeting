Spanish bonds fell, with 10-year debt
dropping for a sixth day, as Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said there were still doubts on the agreement needed
for a 130 billion-euro ($172.3 billion) aid package.  German two-year notes rose as the  European Central Bank 
kept its refinancing rate at a record-low 1 percent, matching
the median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg News survey.
Venizelos will meet euro-area finance ministers later, with
Greece facing a 14.5 billion-euro bond payment on March 20.
 Spain  sold an additional 4 billion euros of benchmark 10-year
bonds through banks yesterday.  Spanish bonds “are falling as there are still quite a lot
of outstanding bits and pieces to be agreed on the Greek deal,”
said Lyn Graham-Taylor, a fixed-income strategist at Rabobank
International in London. “There are still implementation risks,
and concern whether they’ll meet their March 20 deadline.”  Spain’s 10-year yield rose five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 5.27 percent at 1:09 p.m. London time. The
5.85 percent bond due in January 2022 fell 0.41, or 4.10 euros
per 1,000-euro face amount, to 104.370.  Greece  has “issues outstanding that must be resolved by
the time the eurogroup meets,” Venizelos told reporters in
 Athens  after a meeting with Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  and
officials from the European Union and  International Monetary
Fund  that ended just before 6 a.m. local time.  Disagreements  Discussions between Papademos and leaders of the three
parties supporting his government failed to resolve a dispute
over pension cuts, Panos Beglitis, a spokesman for the Pasok
socialist party, told reporters after the meeting.  Disagreements in Athens threaten to hold up a debt swap
that will trim 100 billion euros off the nation’s more than 200
billion euros of privately held debt. Euro-area finance
ministers will convene in Brussels at 6 p.m. today. Luxembourg
Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker , who chairs the meetings,
announced the gathering in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  Spain sold the additional 10-year bonds at a yield 300
basis points more than the swap rate. The notes take the total
size of the benchmark issue to 11.3 billion euros, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  Italy’s 10-year bond yield rose two basis points to 5.61
percent, leaving the extra yield investors demand to hold the
securities instead of German bunds three basis points wider at
3.63 percentage points.  Euribor Slides  Spanish and Italian bonds rallied after the ECB offered
unlimited three-year cash to the region’s banks in December to
avoid a credit crunch. The central bank will offer a second
round of the loans on Feb. 28, with allotment a day later.
President  Mario Draghi  will hold a press conference at 2:30 p.m.
in  Frankfurt  to explain today’s  interest-rate  decision.  The  Bank of England  said today it will add 50 billion
pounds ($79.3 billion) to its bond-purchase program, taking the
size of its asset purchases to 325 billion pounds. It left its
benchmark interest rate at 0.5 percent.  The German two-year note yield fell two basis points to
0.23 percent. The 10-year bond rate was little changed at 1.97
percent, after rising to 2.006 percent yesterday, the highest
level since Jan. 25.  The  rate  at which European banks say they see each other
lending in euros for three months dropped for a 36th day, the
longest run of declines in 2 1/2 years, as record borrowing at
the central bank’s three-year tender eased funding costs.  The euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor, for such loans
dropped 0.7 basis point, or 0.007 percentage point, to 1.07
percent, according to data from the European Banking Federation.
That’s the longest run of losses since August 2009, and is the
 lowest  rate since January 2011, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The rate has fallen every day since the ECB allotted 489
billion euros to 523 banks on Dec. 21.  Germany ’s bonds have handed investors 11 percent in the
past 12 months, according to indexes compiled by the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies and Bloomberg, as
investors sought a haven from the European debt crisis. Greek
debt tumbled 64 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
