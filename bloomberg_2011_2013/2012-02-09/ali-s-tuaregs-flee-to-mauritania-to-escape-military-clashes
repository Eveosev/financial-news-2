More than 10,000 people from  Mali 
fled into Mauritania after fighting between the Malian military
and a separatist group, an official from the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees said.  Refugees, members of the Tuareg nomadic tribe, were given
rations and sanitary kits and about 1,200 tents will be sent to
the region, Nada Merehb, the UNHCR’s representative in
Nouakchott, Mauritania’s capital, said in a statement read on
national television today. Mauritania’s government is providing
medicine and drinking water, Merehb said.  Mali’s army killed at least 45 fighters from the Azawad
National Liberation Movement in clashes on Jan. 18, according to
the government. The group is demanding autonomous rule for a
large section of northern Mali, including the area around the
city of Timbuktu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
