European stocks  rose for the first
time in four days as Greek political leaders reached a consensus
on austerity measures and the European Central Bank held its
benchmark  interest rate  at a record low.  Daimler AG (DAI) , the maker of Mercedes-Benz cars, jumped to the
highest in six months after reporting a 39 percent increase in
quarterly profit.  Hugo Boss AG (BOS)  climbed as fourth-quarter
operating income beat estimates.  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  fell 3.5
percent after posting an unexpected loss.  The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index advanced 0.2 percent to 263.64
at the close in  London . The benchmark measure has rallied 23
percent from last year’s low and 7.8 percent this year on
mounting optimism that euro-area policy makers will contain the
region’s debt crisis.  “We’ve seen a bit more confidence creeping into the
markets,” Justin Urquhart Stewart, who helps oversee about $3
billion at 7 Investment Management in London, said in a
Bloomberg Television interview. “We are seeing shafts of light
in the leaden sky coming through in the euro zone.”  Greece’s government has reached a deal on austerity
measures required for a 130 billion-euro ($173 billion)
financing package, according to a statement from the press
office of Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos .  Euro-area finance ministers meeting in Brussels today will
hear from Greece as well as the European Commission, the
 European Central Bank  and the  International Monetary Fund  on
whether Greece has met the conditions for a second bailout,
Dutch Finance Minister  Jan Kees de Jager  said.  ECB, BOE Decisions  ECB (EURR002W)  policy makers meeting in Frankfurt left the benchmark
interest rate at a record low of 1 percent, as predicted by 55
of 57 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. President  Mario
Draghi  said at a press conference that surveys confirm tentative
signs of stabilization in the euro-area economy.  Bank of England  officials decided to infuse another 50
billion pounds ($79 billion) into the U.K. economy to protect a
nascent recovery. The Monetary Policy Committee raised the
target for bond purchases to 325 billion pounds, more than a
quarter of current outstanding gilts.  The number of Americans filing  first-time claims  for
unemployment insurance payments unexpectedly declined in the
week ended Feb. 4, a report today showed, indicating the U.S.
labor market recovery is gaining traction.  National benchmark indexes rose in 12 of the 18 western
European markets.  France ’s CAC 40 added 0.4 percent. Germany’s
DAX climbed 0.6 percent, and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 gained 0.3
percent.  Earnings Surprises  Of the 114 Stoxx 600 companies that have reported quarterly
earnings since Jan. 9, 57 missed analysts’ estimates, compared
with 52 that beat projections, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “Figures aren’t that bad,” Stewart said. “Companies are
honest about write-offs and this is logical.”  Daimler (DAI)  jumped 4.6 percent to 46.68 euros, its highest
since Aug. 2. The company reported a 39 percent increase in
fourth-quarter profit, boosted by demand for the revamped M-
Class sport-utility vehicle. Earnings before interest and taxes
rose to 2.18 billion euros, exceeding the 2.17 billion-euro
average estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  A gauge of  automakers  rose 2.9 percent, for the biggest
gain among the 19 industry groups in the Stoxx 600.  Hugo Boss, Arkema  Preference shares of  Hugo Boss  rose 0.7 percent to 77.30
euros. The German luxury clothier controlled by buyout firm
Permira Advisers said earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation, amortization and one-time items increased to 97
million euros from 77 million euros in the year-earlier period.
That beat the 86.4 million-euro average estimate of eight
analysts.  Arkema (AKE)  rose 4.3 percent to 67.63 euros. The chemical maker
was raised to “overweight” from “equal weight” at Morgan
Stanley.  KBC Groep NV (KBC)  advanced 8.2 percent to 18.07 euros. Belgium’s
biggest bank and insurer by market value plans further repayment
of state aid this year. KBC said it’s making “considerable
progress” with the planned sale of Kredyt Bank SA.  DNB ASA (DNB)  rallied 8.3 percent to 69.45 kroner. The Nordic
region’s second-largest bank reported a fourth-quarter profit
that dropped less than analysts estimated. Net income fell to
4.09 billion kroner from 5.35 billion kroner a year earlier,

analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Danske Bank, Credit Suisse  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE)  added 5 percent to 89.25 kroner. Denmark’s
biggest lender reported declining costs relative to income and

ratio fell to 54.4 percent in the fourth quarter, versus 59.3
percent a year earlier, the bank said.  Credit Suisse declined 3.5 percent to 24.35 Swiss francs.
 Switzerland ’s second-biggest lender said it had a loss in the
fourth quarter for the first time since 2008, hurt by “adverse
markets” and costs to reorganize the investment bank.  The net loss amounted to 637 million francs ($698 million).
That was wider than the 446 million-franc mean profit estimate
of nine analysts.  ING Groep NV tumbled 5.4 percent to 6.87 euros. The biggest
Dutch financial-services company posted a fourth-quarter profit
that missed forecasts after reporting a hedging loss and taking
a charge on its U.S. insurance business.  GDF Suez, Nobel Biocare  GDF Suez SA (GSZ)  lost 4.8 percent to 20.30 euros. The operator
of Europe’s biggest natural-gas network reported a 13 percent
drop in full-year net profit after mild weather and a regulated
rate freeze in France crimped earnings.  Nobel Biocare Holding AG (NOBN)  tumbled 16 percent to 10.50
francs, for the worst performance on the Stoxx 600. The world’s
second-biggest  dental implant  maker reported an increase in
fourth-quarter profit as demand improved, driven by  North
America . Net income rose to 13.3 million euros from 5.2 million
euros a year earlier. The earnings missed the average estimate
of 18.1 million euros from eight analysts.  Orkla ASA (ORK)  retreated 4.3 percent to 45.50 kroner. The
