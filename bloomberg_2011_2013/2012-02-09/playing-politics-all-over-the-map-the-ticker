With Election Day fewer than nine months away, and with candidates chomping at the political bit, congressional districts in 13 states remain variously in flux, according to law professor Justin Levitt's  excellent redistricting blog . Maps in six states --  Florida , Kansas, Kentucky, New Hampshire,  New York  and  Rhode Island  -- are still working their way through state legislatures. Maps in three more -- Arizona, Michigan and Virginia -- are drawn and awaiting pre-clearance under the  Voting Rights Act . Maps in another three -- Connecticut, Minnesota and Texas -- will be drawn by the courts. Finally there is West Virginia, which is in a bit of redistricting limbo due to a Supreme Court stay of a court decision that struck down the state's map. Meantime, new maps in eight of the 30 states that actually have them are under some kind of court challenge. Amid the chaos, we salute the seven states that always manage to have an orderly process when new census results require them to align their political maps with their population shifts. Montana, North Dakota,  South Dakota , Wyoming, Vermont, Delaware and Alaska never make a fuss over congressional redistricting. Each has only one congressional district.
