German endurance athlete Thomas Dold
won his record seventh consecutive race to the top of the Empire
State Building tonight, completing the 1,050-foot stair climb up
New York’s tallest building in 10 minutes, 28 seconds.  Dold, 27, was the top finisher in the 35th Annual  Empire
State Building Run-Up , organized by the  New York Road Runners .
The top women’s competitor, 42-year-old Melissa Moon of  New
Zealand , finished in 12:39.  Dold and Moon led a field of more than 700 competitors, who
ran the 86-floor, 1,576-step course from the building’s lobby to
its observation deck. The race, which featured a night-time
finish for the first time, expects to raise around $475,000 for
the  Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation , the title sponsor and
benefiting charity.  Runners ages 20-78 from 25 countries, including  Australia ,
 Japan , Mexico and Turkey, competed in the event, which began
with 15 competitors in 1977. The Run-Up was invitation-only
until last year, when MMRF began its association with the event.  The course record of 9:33 was set by Paul Crake in 2003,
according to the NYRR, which also organizes the  New York  City
Marathon.  -- Editor: Rob Gloster  To contact the reporters on this story:
