Nigerian Treasury bill yields
declined for a second weekly auction, with bids being made for
more than double the 149.3 billion ($938 million) sold.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  sold 32.1 billion naira of 91-
day bills at a yield of 14.70 percent, 9 basis points lower than
the 14.79 percent at an auction on Jan. 25. The bank sold 50
billion naira of 182-day securities at 16.09 percent, 1 basis
point lower than the previous sale, and 67.2 billion naira of
364-day notes at 16.89 percent, 0.3 percent lower than at the
last sale on Jan. 11, the Abuja-based Central Bank of  Nigeria 
bank said today in an e-mailed statement.  Bids totaled 316.85 billion naira, outstripping the amount
sold more than twofold and the most since the Nov. 24 sale.  Nigeria’s consumer inflation rate fell for the first time
in four months to 10.3 percent in December, from 10.5 percent a
month earlier, the  National Bureau of Statistics  said Jan. 18.  With the  central bank  committed to containing inflation,
“it appears investors will continue to enjoy attractive returns
from purchases of treasury bills,” Gregory Kronsten, chief
economist at FBN Capital Ltd. in  London , wrote in an e-mailed
response to questions.  The central bank maintained its  benchmark interest rate  at
a record high on Jan. 31 to curb inflation after the government
partially removed fuel subsidies, boosting gasoline costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
