The U.K. economy contracted in the
three months to January, supporting the case for the  Bank of
England  to boost its bond-purchase program, the National
Institute of Economic and Social Research said.  Gross domestic product  probably fell 0.2 percent, compared
with a contraction of the same amount in the fourth quarter,
Niesr, whose clients include the Bank of England and the U.K.
Treasury, said in an e-mailed statement in London today.  While the estimates don’t confirm that the U.K. is in a
recession, they suggest no growth since October 2011, Niesr
said. The Bank of England increased its target for  bond
purchases  by 75 billion pounds ($119 billion) to 325 billion
pounds today to shield the economy from turmoil in  Europe .  “There are significant downside risks to the U.K.’s
outlook this year, not least those associated with the evolution
of the euro-area crisis,” Niesr said. “A further round of
quantitative easing appears necessary in order to boost demand
in the short term.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
