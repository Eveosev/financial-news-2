The  Federal Reserve  is likely to
start a new round of bond buying whether or not the U.S. economy
continues to show signs of strength, according to  Morgan
Stanley (MS) ’s Gregory Peters.  “We think QE3 in the U.S. isn’t data-dependent,” Peters,
the New York-based bank’s global head of fixed-income research,
said today in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s
“InBusiness With Margaret Brennan,” referring to a third round
of quantitative easing.  The central bank has purchased $2.3 trillion of debt in two
rounds of bond buying known as QE1 and QE2 as it seeks to
encourage investment in the world’s biggest economy. The Fed is
likely to buy Treasuries and mortgage bonds in the next round of
easing, Peters said.  The European Central Bank may also begin a bond-buying
program, Peters said. “There’s a full-blown credit crunch in
Europe,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
