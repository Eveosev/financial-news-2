Siemens AG (SIE) , Europe’s largest
engineering company, will slow the pace of operating spending
this year as the company braces for a slowdown in Europe.  The company will increase investments at a slower pace,
Chief Financial Officer Joe Kaeser told Handelsblatt newspaper
in an interview. Spokesman Wolfram Trost confirmed the comments,
saying Kaeser was referring to operating expenditures.  Siemens’s  forecast  for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30
includes increasing operating expenditure to as much as 15.5
billion euros ($20.4 billion) from 14.2 billion euros last year.
The company had so far forecast to increase capital expenditure
by as much as 500 million euros this year.  Siemens on Jan. 24 reported first-quarter  earnings  that
missed estimates as profitability dropped at its four main
units, and indicated business will remain tough in the second
quarter of its fiscal year. The Munich-based company predicted
 Europe  will slip into recession in the coming months. Siemens
forecast it will earn about 6 billion euros in profit this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
