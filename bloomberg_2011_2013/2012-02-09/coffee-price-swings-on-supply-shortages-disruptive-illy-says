Illycaffe SpA Chief Executive Officer
Andrea Illy said coffee-price swings caused by declining
stockpiles are “disruptive” to business. Following are
comments he made at the “Feeding the World” meeting organized
by Economist Conferences in Geneva yesterday.  “The market nowadays is unpredictable. It’s difficult to
manage such volatility and it’s quite disruptive. Hedging
unfortunately is only short term.”  Price fluctuations are “always triggered by fundamentals,
particularly the stock levels,” Illy said. ‘Volatility is very
much triggered by stock levels. Even if the production deficit
became very clear already in 2009, there was no money in 2009 to
speculate.”  “The balance between production and consumption is never
perfect. We are in a production deficit, the stocks are very low
and as a consequence of this, for the first time in coffee
history, it has been more than one year now, the price in  New
York  is systematically above $2 a pound.”  “There are more than 25 million families in the world
involved in coffee growing in 50 countries.” The value of the
roasted coffee market is estimated at $105 billion, and “only
$26 billion right now goes to the growing countries.”  Illy buys coffee directly from Brazilian growers, which
allows the company to “source the best beans” as well as trace
its products, the CEO said.  “We do serve more or less 6 million cups a day, always
with the same blend.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
