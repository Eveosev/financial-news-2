Latvia’s  economy  expanded at the
slowest pace since the first three months of 2011 in the fourth
quarter as manufacturing and export growth slowed.  Gross domestic product rose 5 percent from a year earlier,
the  statistics office  in the capital, Riga, said today in a
preliminary estimate. That’s less than a median estimate of 5.2
percent in a Bloomberg survey of eight economists. GDP expanded
0.8 percent on the quarter.  The Baltic nation’s  economy  has been growing for two years
after a debt-fueled property bubble burst, export markets closed
and lending tightened, erasing almost a quarter of GDP. The
 International Monetary Fund  cut its forecast for Latvian growth
this year to 1.5 percent as turmoil in the euro area curbs
export and manufacturing growth.  Industrial output  in the last three months of the year
decreased a quarterly 0.5 percent and exports fell in November a
monthly 2.4 percent. Latvia will release detailed fourth-quarter
GDP data on March 9.  The country ended a 7.5 billion-euro ($10 billion) lending
program from a group led by the European Commission and the IMF
in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
