The market for corporate borrowing
via  commercial paper  rose for the fifth straight week, led by
investor demand for short-term IOUs issued by foreign financial
companies.  The euro and commodities rose today after European Central
Bank President  Mario Draghi  said Greek party leaders reached a
deal on austerity measures needed to qualify for international
rescue funds, boosting confidence that  Europe ’s sovereign-debt
crisis can be contained.  Demand for short-term bank IOUs “is another sign of just
how effective the Draghi ECB has been in adopting the American
strategy of short-term expedience,” Howard Simons, strategist
at Bianco Research LLC in Chicago, wrote in an e-mail. “The
market is pricing out a disaster scenario,” Simons said.  The seasonally adjusted amount of U.S. commercial paper
rose by $700 million to $972.9 billion outstanding in the week
ended yesterday, the  Federal Reserve  said on its website. That’s
the highest level since Dec. 21, according to Fed data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Foreign financial  firms’ issuance rose $8.4
billion to $167.6 billion outstanding, the fifth weekly rise and
the largest gain since May, the data show.  Companies issue commercial paper to fund everyday payments
such as rent and salaries. The  amount issued by U.S.-based
financial companies  dropped by $4.1 billion to $287.8 billion
outstanding, according to the Fed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
