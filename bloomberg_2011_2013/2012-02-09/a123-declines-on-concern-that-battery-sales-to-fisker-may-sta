A123 Systems Inc. , a U.S. maker of
batteries for electric cars, fell the most in more than two
years after its largest customer stopped work on a factory and
an analyst downgraded its shares.  A123, based in Waltham,  Massachusetts , fell 24 percent to
$1.88 at the close in New York, the biggest decline since
September 2009.  Fisker Automotive Inc. said Feb. 6 that it fired 26
employees and stopped work at the factory it’s developing in
Wilmington, Delaware, to make plug-in electric vehicles after
the U.S. Energy Department blocked access to a federal loan.  The funding may never be restored “because it has become
part of an intense political debate,” Theodore O’Neill, an
analyst at Wunderlich Securities Inc. in  St. Louis , wrote in a
research note today.  Fisker is A123’s largest customer, he said, and “may not
be able to afford any more batteries.” O’Neill cut his
recommendation on A123 to “sell” from “hold” and his price
target to 50 cents from $3 a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
