Eastman Kodak Co., the photography
pioneer thatâ€™s in bankruptcy, said it plans to phase out its
unit that makes digital cameras, pocket video cameras and
digital picture frames.  The phase-out will take place in the first half of 2012,
the Rochester, New York-based company said today in a statement.
Kodak will instead expand its brand licensing program, and seek
licensees in these categories the company said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
