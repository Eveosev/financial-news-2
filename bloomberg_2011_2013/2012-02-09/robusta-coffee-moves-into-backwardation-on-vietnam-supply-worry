Robusta coffee for March delivery
became more expensive than the May contract today on concerns
roasters may tap European stockpiles as farmers in top producer
 Vietnam  hoard beans.  Beans for March delivery commanded a premium of $21 a
metric ton to May-delivered coffee by 5:02 p.m. London time.
That moved the market into so-called backwardation, a situation
in which front-month contracts are priced above deferred ones
and potentially signaling tight supplies.  Robusta coffee inventories in warehouses monitored by the
NYSE Liffe exchange in London have fallen since July 11,  data  on
Bloomberg show. Inventories stood at 236,320 tons as of Jan. 23,
according to the exchange. Farmers in Vietnam are holding back
beans awaiting higher prices after rates slumped 14 percent in
London last year.  “In Vietnam, the world’s largest robusta producer, coffee
farmers are holding back 60 percent of their crop, waiting for
better prices,” Lysu Paez, an analyst at Natixis SA in Paris,
wrote in a weekly report e-mailed today. “This situation has
been supportive for robusta prices.”  Robusta coffee for March delivery rose 3.8 percent to
$1,950 a metric ton in  London . The price has climbed 7.7 percent
this year. Liffe will update inventory figures later today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
