     Feb. 9 (Bloomberg) --　Most Japanese  stocks  rose, with the
Topix Index extending a six-month high, as improved earnings at
 Nippon Paper Group Inc. (3893)  lifted the  paper industry  and on
investors’ optimism  Greece  would secure a bailout.  Nippon Paper jumped 5.5 percent.  Nippon Sheet Glass Co. ,
which gets 39 percent of its revenue in Europe, added 4.7
percent.  Komatsu Ltd. , a construction machinery maker that
counts  China  as its biggest market, slid 0.7 percent after
mainland inflation unexpectedly accelerated last month, damping
prospects for further monetary easing.  The Topix Index rose 0.3 percent to 784.49 as of the 3 p.m.
close of trading in Tokyo, its highest since Aug. 5. The gauge
earlier fell as much as 0.6 percent. The  Nikkei 225 Stock
Average  fell 0.2 percent to 9,002.24 after falling as much as
0.8 percent.  “History tells us that a deal in Greece will be reached at
the last minute,” said  Shane Oliver , Sydney-based head of
investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which has
almost $100 billion under management. “A lot of indications show
they are heading in that direction even though there are
endless delays.”  Paper Makers Surge  Nippon Paper jumped 5.5 percent to 1,766 yen after posting
a nearly 40 percent rise in operating profit for last quarter.
 Mitsubishi Paper Mills Ltd. (3864)  surged 11 percent to 84 yen and
 Hokuetsu Kishu Paper Co.  gained 4.1 percent to 539 yen.
Mitsubishi Paper Mills had the biggest gain on the Nikkei and
paper Makers led advances among the Topix’s 33 industry groups.  “Nippon Paper’s earnings triggered gains across the
sector,” said Yoshihiko Tabei, senior analyst at Kazaka
Securities Co. “The shares were ready to move because the
sector has lagged behind other stocks and many of these
companies look undervalued.”  Shares on the paper measure trade at an average of 0.72
times book value, compared with 0.95 times for the Topix. A
number less than one means that companies can be bought for less
than value of their assets.  The  Topix  has risen 7.7 percent this year even as companies
including Toyota Motor Corp. have missed earnings estimates. Of
1,189 companies in the index that have reported since Jan. 9,
229 missed analysts’ estimates while 114 beat them, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  were little
changed today. The gauge closed 0.2 percent higher yesterday and
has risen 7.3 percent this year amid better-than-expected
economic data and corporate earnings.  ‘Game of Chicken’  Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said there are
still doubts on the agreement needed to secure a 130 billion-
euro ($172 billion) rescue package for his country ahead of a
meeting of euro-area finance ministers today.  “The Greek situation hasn’t progressed,” said Soichiro Monji, chief strategist at Tokyo-based Daiwa SB Investments Ltd.,
which manages the equivalent of $37 billion. “This is like a
game of chicken, and they won’t make much progress until they
get close to the deadline.”  Nippon Sheet Glass rose 4.7 percent to 133 yen.  Shimano
Inc. , a bicycle-equipment maker that gets about 38 percent of
revenue in  Europe , rose 8.2 percent to 4,270 yen in  Osaka .  Chinese Inflation  Some Japanese stocks earlier fell after China’s consumer
prices unexpectedly rose 4.5 percent in January as the weeklong
Lunar New Year holiday drove spending, the National Bureau of
Statistics said today. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had been
expecting inflation to slow to 4 percent.  Komatsu lost 0.7 percent to 2,174 yen, while  Hitachi
Construction Machinery Co ., which gets 27 percent of its sales
in China, slid 1.4 percent 1,507 yen. Machinery makers also
declined after orders in  Japan  fell 7.1 percent, the fastest
pace in three months, in December. Analysts had expected a 5
percent decline.  The  Nikkei 225 Volatility Index  dropped 0.5 percent to
20.91, indicating traders expect a swing of about 6 percent on
the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
