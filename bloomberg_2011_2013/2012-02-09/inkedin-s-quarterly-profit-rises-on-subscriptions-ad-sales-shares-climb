LinkedIn Corp. (LNKD) , the biggest
professional-networking website, rose the most since November
after it reported quarterly sales that more than doubled and
forecast higher 2012 revenue, buoyed by advertising and
subscriptions.  LinkedIn climbed 11 percent to $84.54 at 9:38 a.m. in New
York trading, after touching $84.75 for the highest intraday
percentage gain since Nov. 30.  Before today, the stock had surged 70 percent since its
initial public offering in May. That’s a bigger gain than other
social-media companies, including gaming company Zynga Inc. and
daily-deal provider  Groupon Inc. (GRPN) , have posted since their own
IPOs last year.  LinkedIn said membership jumped to more than 150 million
from 131.2 million in the third quarter. LinkedIn is signing up
more professionals for its subscription services and luring
advertisers who want to reach the growing user base.  The fourth quarter “exceeded our expectations for member
engagement and business growth,” Chief Executive Officer Jeff Weiner said in a statement.  Fourth-quarter revenue advanced to $167.7 million, the
 Mountain View , California-based company said in the statement
yesterday. That topped the $159.8 million average analyst
estimate in a Bloomberg survey. Sales this year will be $840
million to $860 million, LinkedIn said, compared with the $834.1
million prediction.  Hiring, Marketing Solutions  Net income in the fourth quarter rose to $6.92 million, or
6 cents a share, from $1.58 million, or 3 cents, a year earlier,
the company said. Before some costs, profit was 12 cents a
share. That beat the average analyst  estimate  of 7 cents.  Revenue (LNKD)  in LinkedIn’s hiring solutions business more than
doubled in the fourth quarter to $84.9 million. Sales in the
marketing solutions unit increased 77 percent to $49.5 million,
while revenue from premium subscriptions jumped 87 percent to
$33.3 million.  The company may face increased competition from Facebook
Inc., the world’s largest social-networking company, which filed
for an IPO last week.  BranchOut Inc. , a San Francisco-based
startup, is building a professional network on Facebook, taking
advantage of Facebook’s 845 million users. BranchOut said this
week that it has added more than 50 million members in the past
two months.  To fend off rivals, LinkedIn is investing for growth. Sales
and marketing costs in the last three months of the year more
than doubled to $53.2 million, while LinkedIn’s product
development expenses climbed to $42.1 million.  In the fourth quarter, sales in  the U.S.  were $112 million,
representing 67 percent of total revenue, the same percentage as
in the third quarter.  LinkedIn forecast first-quarter revenue of $170 million to
$175 million, compared with analysts’ $170.5 million average
estimate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
