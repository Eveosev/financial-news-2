There is room for  China  to cooperate
with the U.S. and other  United Nations  Security Council members
over political unrest in  Syria , Vice Foreign Minister Cui
Tiankai said at a briefing in Beijing today.  Chinaâ€™s veto of a UN resolution to facilitate a handover of
power does not preclude further cooperation on the issue, Cui
said at a briefing in Beijing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
