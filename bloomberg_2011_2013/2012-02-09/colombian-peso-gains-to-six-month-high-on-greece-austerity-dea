Colombia ’s peso rose to the strongest
in almost six months after  Greece  reached a deal on austerity
measures needed to help avoid default, boosting demand for
higher-yielding emerging-market assets.  The peso is also gaining as companies exchange dollars for
the local currency to pay taxes this month, said Omar Escorcia,
an analyst at Asesores en Valores SA brokerage in Bogota.  The peso gained 0.3 percent to 1,774.38 per  U.S. dollar  at
9:31 a.m. in Bogota, from 1,779.30 yesterday. Earlier it touched
1,770, the strongest intraday level since Aug. 17. The peso has
jumped 9.3 percent this year.  “The market is in a positive mood today, and added to that
important flows are coming in for taxes,” Escorcia said.  Greek Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  called European
Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  to tell him “an agreement
has been reached,” Draghi said at a press conference today in
 Frankfurt .  Rising foreign investment into oil and mining and a
widening interest rate differential will offset the central
bank’s efforts to ease gains in the local currency, according to
Escorcia. Colombia’s benchmark interest rate is 5 percent,
compared with near zero in the U.S.  In a bid to stem the peso’s advance, Colombia’s central
bank said last week that starting Feb. 6 it will buy a minimum
of $20 million a day for at least three months.  Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry said in a conference
call with investors yesterday the peso’s rally this year
“worries” him as it risks jobs.  The yield on the government’s 10 percent peso bonds due
July 2024 rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to
7.44 percent, according to the central bank. The bond’s price
fell 0.202 centavo to 120.284 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
