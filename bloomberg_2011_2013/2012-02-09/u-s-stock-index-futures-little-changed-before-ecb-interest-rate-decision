U.S. stocks rose, sending the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index higher for a third day, as Greek
political leaders struck a deal on a package of austerity
measures needed to secure international rescue funds.  Technology (S5INFT)  shares had the biggest gain among 10 industries
in the S&P 500, adding 1 percent.  Akamai Technologies Inc. (AKAM) , the
operator of a server network that lets businesses speed data
delivery, and  Visa Inc. (V) , the world’s biggest payments network,
advanced at least 3.7 percent as earnings topped analysts’
projections.  United Technologies Corp. (UTX)  rallied 2.5 percent as it
is said to be studying the sale of a pumps business.  The S&P 500 increased 0.2 percent to 1,351.95 as of 4 p.m.
New York time. The benchmark gauge declined as much as 0.4
percent earlier today. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  advanced
6.51 points, or 0.1 percent, to 12,890.46. The Russell 2000
Index of small companies lost 0.4 percent to 824.99.  “I’d expect a better performance for stocks,” said  Peter Jankovskis , who helps manage about $2.6 billion at Oakbrook
Investments in Lisle,  Illinois . “If the EU can show that they
can deal with a small country with a big problem, then investors
may be reassured that some of the larger countries with smaller
problems can also be handled.”  Equities rallied around the world after  Greece ’s government
reached a deal on austerity measures required for a 130 billion-
euro ($173 billion) financing package. Greece faces a 14.5
billion-euro bond payment on March 20 and is struggling to
secure financing to avert a collapse of the economy that could
spark a new round of contagion in the euro area.  Earnings Season  Today’s gain put the S&P 500 less than 1 percent away from
its peak nine months ago of  1,363.61 , which was the highest
level since June 2008. The benchmark gauge climbed 7.5 percent
this year, as companies reported earnings that  beat  analysts’
estimates while better-than-expected data on manufacturing and
employment bolstered optimism about the world’s largest economy.  A rally in stocks has pushed market momentum and breadth to
levels that suggest any imminent retreat in the S&P 500 will be
limited to 3 percent, according to  JPMorgan (JPM)  Chase & Co.  Michael Krauss , head of technical research at JPMorgan in
New York, this week boosted the higher end of his 2012 forecast
for the S&P 500 to 1,440, from a November projection of 1,350,
after the market had its best start of a year since 1991. While
prices may have risen too fast, any pullback will attract
investors who missed the rally, limiting the decline, he said.  “There is no setup right now that to me would suggest a 5-
to-10 percent correction is imminent,” Krauss said in a note
today. “There is nothing worse than underperforming a rising
market. Hence, we see 2-to-3 percent corrective ‘non-crisis’
pullbacks will find buyers.”  Akamai, Visa  Akamai jumped 11 percent, the biggest gain in the S&P 500,
to $38.06. The company, whose customers include  Apple Inc. (AAPL) , is
benefiting from rising demand for its services as companies seek
ways to push data-heavy digital content, such as videos, around
the world more quickly.  Visa rallied 3.8 percent to $112.42, a record. Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Joseph W. Saunders is positioning Visa
for its next phase of growth after U.S. regulators capped so-
called swipe fees, or interchange, that the company charges
merchants for debit-card purchases. Visa, which derived about 56
percent of  revenue  from the U.S. in fiscal 2011, has said it
intends to generate more than half from markets abroad by 2015.  United Technologies gained 2.5 percent to $83.78. It is
studying the sale of a pump- and compressor-making division to
raise cash for the planned purchase of aerospace supplier
Goodrich Corp., people with knowledge of the matter said.  John Moran , a United Technologies spokesman, declined to comment.  Foreclosure Practices  The KBW Bank Index fell 0.3 percent as 18 of its 24 stocks
retreated.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , JPMorgan and three other U.S.
banks reached a $25 billion settlement with 49 states and the
U.S. government to end a probe of abusive foreclosure practices
stemming from the collapse of the housing bubble. Bank of
America added 0.6 percent to $8.18. JPMorgan lost 1.2 percent to
$37.86.  Citigroup Inc. (C)  retreated 1.7 percent to $33.66.  Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO)  slumped 2.1 percent, the most in the
Dow, to $20. The biggest maker of networking equipment predicted
a third-quarter revenue gain of 5 percent to 7 percent. That
equates to about $11.4 billion to $11.6 billion, compared with
an  average estimate  of $11.5 billion. Excluding some costs,
earnings will be 45 cents to 47 cents a share. Analysts had
projected 45 cents.  PepsiCo Inc. fell 3.7 percent to $64.27. The company plans
to cut 8,700  jobs  and boost marketing spending for its brands by
as much as $600 million as Chief Executive Officer  Indra Nooyi 
works to turn around the world’s largest snack-food maker.  Tax-Related  Groupon Inc. (GRPN)  sank 14 percent to $21.17. The largest daily-
deal site reported a tax-related fourth-quarter loss that
analysts hadn’t predicted. Groupon, based in  Chicago , has
expanded to 47 countries and set up a new international
headquarters in Switzerland. That contributed to a higher-than-
expected $34.8 million in taxes, Chief Financial Officer Jason
Child said.  As global stocks return to a bull market, the losers in the
U.S. are companies least tied to economic growth.  For the first time since 1999,  S&P 500  utilities, phone
companies and providers of consumer staples posted the only
monthly losses,  slumping at least 1.5 percent  with dividends in
January, and continued to lag behind this month. It’s a reversal
from 2011, when the three defensive industries returned more
than 6.3 percent as investors embraced stocks thought to do well
during a slowdown.  Riskier Assets  Investors are shifting toward riskier assets as U.S.
manufacturing expanded the most since June and the  jobless rate 
fell to a three-year low of 8.3 percent. In 2011, the global
equity measure suffered its biggest losses since the subprime-
mortgage crisis.  “Last year, investors tended to hide in things which are
stable, paying reasonable dividends,” said Sudhir Nanda, a
 money manager  and head of the quantitative equity group at T.
Rowe Price Group Inc. in Baltimore, which oversees $489.5
billion. “This year, people looked at the U.S. and said,
‘Things are not really that bad.’ If the economy is humming,
people tend to buy more of the sectors which will profit from
growth, industrials, materials and things like that.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
