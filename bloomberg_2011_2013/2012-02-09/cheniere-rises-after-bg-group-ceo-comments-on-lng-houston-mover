Cheniere Energy Inc. (LNG) , the liquefied
natural-gas importer proposing to build U.S. export plants,
climbed to its highest in more than three years after  BG Group
Plc (BG/LN)  forecast “strong” demand for the fuel.  Cheniere, based in Houston,  surged  15 percent to $14.27 at
the close in  New York , its highest level since April 2008.  “The outlook for global gas and LNG demand is strong,” BG
Chief Executive Officer  Frank Chapman  said in a statement today.
BG announced Oct. 26 a contract to buy 3.5 million metric tons a
year from an export terminal Cheniere is seeking to develop at
Sabine Pass in  Louisiana .  BG expects about 45 million tons of LNG may be exported
annually from the U.S. in 2020, or about 10 percent of the
country’s current gas demand, said Chapman, who spoke to
reporters today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
