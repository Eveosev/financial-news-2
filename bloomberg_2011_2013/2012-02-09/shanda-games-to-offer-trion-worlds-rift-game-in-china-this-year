Shanda Games Ltd. (GAME) , China’s third-
biggest online games company, agreed to offer  Trion Worlds
Inc. (0120994D) ’s “Rift” title to attract players in the world’s biggest
Internet market by users.  Shanda, based in Shanghai, will offer the game exclusively
in China, Trion Worlds said in an e-mailed statement today. The
multiplayer role-playing  title  will be available in the Asian
country this year, it said.  The new game may help Shanda compete with bigger rivals in
China including  NetEase.com Inc. (NTES) , the local operator of “World
of Warcraft,” and  Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700) , the biggest Chinese
Internet company by revenue. Trion Worlds said it signed up more
than 1 million active players for “Rift” in four months,
gaining more than $100 million in revenue in  North America  and
Europe.  “This is an important push for us,” Lars Buttler, Trion
Worlds’ chief executive officer, said in an interview. “China
is by far the biggest market for online games in Asia and it is
going to be over time the biggest market for gaming in the
world.”  Trion Worlds, based in Redwood City, California, operates
development centers in San Diego and Austin, Texas, according to
its website.  China had 513 million Internet users at the end of last
year, according to data from the government-sponsored  China
Internet Network Information Center .  To contact the reporters on this story:
