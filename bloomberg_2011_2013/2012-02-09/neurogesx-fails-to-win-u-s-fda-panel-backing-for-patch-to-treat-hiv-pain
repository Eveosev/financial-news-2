NeurogesX Inc. (NGSX) , a specialty
drugmaker that has never reported an annual profit, dropped to
its all-time low trading price after the company failed to win
the backing of a U.S. advisory panel for a patch to relieve
painful nerve damage commonly associated with HIV.  NeurogesX fell 28 percent to 58 cents at 4 p.m. That’s the
lowest  closing price  since the  San Mateo , California-based
company began trading in May 2007, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The decrease added to a 31 percent drop over two days
earlier this week.  The panel voted 12-0 that the company didn’t provide
substantial evidence that its product, Qutenza, works. The
advisers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration met yesterday
in  Silver Spring , Maryland.  The  FDA  staff raised questions in a report Feb. 7 whether
the prescription-strength capsaicin patch proved “substantial
efficacy” in treating pain caused by neuropathy linked to the
virus. NeurogesX filed studies with the FDA that used
alternative testing methods to show a “modest benefit,” said
Randall Flick, associate professor of anesthesiology at the  Mayo
Clinic  in Rochester, Minnesota, and acting panel chairman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
