BNP Paribas SA (BNP)  will continue
operations in Bahrain, said Jean-Christophe Durand, the Paris-
based lender’s head for the  Middle East  and Africa.  If the bank had taken a decision to pull out it would have
informed the central bank, Durand said in a phone interview
yesterday. “We haven’t done that.” Durand was responding to
speculation that the bank may quit Bahrain after the Persian
Gulf nation witnessed political unrest.  BNP Paribas, which has its regional headquarters in
Bahrain, last year set up backup operations in Dubai as part of
its policy to establish these centers worldwide, Durand said.  Societe Generale (GLE)  SA said last week it will move its private
banking office in Bahrain to the  United Arab Emirates  as the
French lender seeks to cut costs.  AXA Insurance Gulf’s revenue in Bahrain grew more than 10
percent last year amid the unrest, Jerome Droesch, chief
executive officer for the Gulf and the Middle East, said in a
phone interview from Dubai today, without giving details.  The company, which has its regional headquarters in the
island nation, increased its staff by 5 percent to 100 last
year, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
