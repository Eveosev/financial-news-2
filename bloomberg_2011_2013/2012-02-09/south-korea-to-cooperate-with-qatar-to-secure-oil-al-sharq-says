South Korea  will focus on
“cooperating” with Qatar to try to secure stable supplies of
oil,  Al-Sharq said , citing South Korean President Lee Myung Bak.  Iranian crude “doesn’t represent a big portion” of South
Korea’s oil imports, the newspaper quoted the president as
saying. Lee didn’t discuss South Korea’s plans regarding future
purchases of oil from Iran, according to Al-Sharq.  Iran is under international sanctions over its nuclear
program. Like Qatar, it’s a member of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
