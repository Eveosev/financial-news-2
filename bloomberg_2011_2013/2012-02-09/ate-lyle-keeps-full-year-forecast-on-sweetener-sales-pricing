Tate & Lyle Plc , the maker of low-
calorie sweetener Splenda, said it’s “on track” to meet
forecasts in the year ending March 31 as the company posted
“solid” third-quarter sales amid rising corn prices.  The specialty food-ingredients division increased sales,
fueled by “good” growth in corn-based sweeteners and starches,
the London-based company said in a statement today. Sales
increases of sucralose, sold under the Splenda brand, slowed in
the quarter, it said. Bulk-ingredient sales expanded because of
increased demand from the U.S. and  Mexico .  Chief Executive Officer Javed Ahmed has sold Tate’s sugar
interests to focus on more-profitable units, including specialty
food ingredients. The company plans to restart sucralose
production at a mothballed plant in  Alabama  later this year as
demand increases for Splenda. The manufacturer reiterated it
expects to “deliver a good performance for the full year.”  The quarter “continues to add to management’s credibility
and track record of building a less volatile and more reliable
business model,” Dirk Van Vlaanderen, an analyst at Jefferies
International, said in a note to clients today.  The company widened its corn sugar profit margins even
after paying higher prices for corn, Ahmed said in a conference
call with analysts. Corn prices rose yesterday in Chicago
following speculation that the  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
may lower its estimate for global stockpiles.  Tate & Lyle  fell  0.7 percent to 690 pence at 8:31 a.m. in
 London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
