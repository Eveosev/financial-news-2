Och-Ziff Capital Management Group
LLC , the hedge fund run by Daniel Och, reported a 94 percent
drop in fourth-quarter profit on lower performance fees as most
of the firm’s funds lost money in 2011.  Distributable profit, a measure excluding costs related to
Och-Ziff’s 2007 initial public offering, fell to $16.8 million,
or 4 cents a share, from $303.1 million, or 74 cents, a year
earlier, the New York-based company said today in a statement.
Earnings beat the 2-cent average  estimate  of eight analysts in a
Bloomberg survey.  Performance fees shrank by 90 percent as Europe’s
sovereign-debt crisis roiled markets. Three of the firm’s four
funds declined last year, led by a 4.9 percent loss for the
European fund. Market gains since the start of the year helped
offset $300 million in redemptions, the firm said.  “Heading into the quarter, the set up for 2012 was
earnings power and building back up that performance,” said
Daniel Fannon, a Jefferies & Co. analyst based in  San Francisco ,
who recommends investors buy the stock. “The outlook is one
where we still expect a fair amount of growth in 2012.”  Investors redeemed a net $38 million in the fourth quarter,
shrinking assets under management to $28.8 billion. Estimated
assets were $29 billion as of Feb. 1, reflecting $500 million in
performance-related appreciation as the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index climbed 4.4 percent in January.  Europe Funds  Och-Ziff rose 0.7 percent to close at $10.26 in New York
trading. The firm’s shares have increased 22 percent this year
after falling 46 percent in 2011.  The company sold 33.3 million shares at $7.50 each on Nov.
17, a 19 percent discount from the closing price the day before
the firm said it would sell the stock to repay a portion of a
$622 million  term loan  that matures in July. Och said in
December the hedge fund may have sold the stake too cheaply.  The OZ Master Fund, the firm’s biggest, gained 0.1 percent
last quarter, while the OZ Europe Master Fund fell 1.5 percent.
Och-Ziff doesn’t own a significant amount of  Greece ’s sovereign
debt and hasn’t taken part in restructuring talks, the firm said
last month in response to “media reports regarding the
company’s involvement.”  Och said in May that the firm started a European Ucits fund
in April, which means it complies with a European directive
known as Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable
Securities. Ucits funds place restrictions on leverage, offer
investors transparency of holdings similar to that of mutual
funds and allow clients to withdraw money in as little as a day.  January Gains  The OZ Global Special Investments Master Fund increased 0.5
percent in the fourth quarter, while the OZ Asia Master Fund
declined 0.2 percent.  “Last year was particularly volatile, characterized by the
most difficult market conditions since 2008,” Och, 51, said in
the statement.  The firm’s four funds all gained in January, with the OZ
Master Fund up an estimated 1.6 percent, the OZ  Europe  Master
Fund climbing 1.9 percent, the OZ Asia Master Fund advancing 2.6
percent and the OZ Special Investments Master Fund increasing
1.3 percent.  Och said the firm invested about 15 percent of the $4.4
billion in 2011 gross deposits, or $660 million, in credit-
related strategies. The percentage of cash Och-Ziff holds fell
to 21 percent last quarter from 25 percent in the third quarter
as the firm increased investments.  High Watermark  “Dislocations were creating significant investment
opportunities, particularly in distressed credit, structured
credit and equity long-short and that’s continued,” Och said
today on a conference call with analysts.  The OZ Master Fund surpassed its so-called high watermark,
or previous peak value, in January. It had fallen below that
level at the end of last year, which meant the firm was unable
to charge performance fees until it recouped losses.  Och-Ziff’s distributable earnings don’t comply with
generally accepted accounting principles. The firm reported a
net loss of $137 million, or $1.17 a share, compared with a loss
of $22.8 million, or 24 cents, a year earlier. Och-Ziff has said
costs associated with the IPO will cause net losses through
2012.  Och, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. trader, left the
firm in 1994 to start a hedge fund for Ziff Brothers Investments
LLC, which managed the Ziff family’s publishing fortune. He
oversaw money solely for the Ziffs for five years and then
opened his fund to outside investors in 1999.  To contact the reporter on this story:
