Austria’s economy may continue to
stagnate in the first half of this year, according to the Wifo
economic research institute, which compiles gross domestic
product figures for the Alpine republic’s government.  “Economic growth probably slowed again in the fourth
quarter of 2011” as “weak development in the euro area reduced
foreign impulses” on the Austrian economy, the Vienna-based
institute said in an e-mailed statement today.  “The future development is considered less favorable than
the current situation,” Wifo said. “This suggests a
continuation of stagnation in the first half.”  Wifo is scheduled to report a flash estimate for fourth-
quarter GDP on Feb. 15.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
