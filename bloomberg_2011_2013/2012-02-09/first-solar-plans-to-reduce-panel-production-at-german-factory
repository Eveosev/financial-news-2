First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , the world’s biggest
maker of thin-film solar panels, plans to reduce production at
its factory in Germany as declining subsidies reduce European
demand.  First Solar applied for government assistance to help
offset the loss of income for the 1,200 employees in Germany who
will be placed on a part-time work schedule, said  Alan Bernheimer , a spokesman for the Tempe, Arizona-based company.  First Solar last year doubled capacity at the factory to
500 megawatts of panels annually, and plans to cut output in
half for six months starting in March, once the government
assistance is approved, he said.  “This was part of our 2012 guidance to scale back to 80
percent of our global production capacity,” Bernheimer said
today in a telephone interview.  First Solar rose 7 percent to $49.03 at the close in  New
York . The shares have gained 45 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
