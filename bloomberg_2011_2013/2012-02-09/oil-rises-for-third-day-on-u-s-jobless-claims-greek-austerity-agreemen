Oil capped its longest rally this
year as the number of Americans filing first-time unemployment
claims unexpectedly declined and Greek political leaders struck
a deal on a package of austerity measures.  Futures advanced 1.1 percent after the Labor Department
said applications for  jobless benefits  decreased 15,000 in the
week ended Feb. 4 to 358,000. The Greek government reached the
agreement required for a 130 billion-euro ($173 billion)
financing package, according to an e-mailed statement from Prime
Minister  Lucas Papademos ’s office in  Athens .  “The jobs data showed the U.S. economy is definitely
looking better than it was, and it’s providing some strength to
oil,” said  Kyle Cooper , director of research for IAF Advisors
in Houston. “ Greece  is probably the driving factor for the
market’s rally.”  Crude for March delivery gained $1.13 to $99.84 a barrel on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest settlement in
three weeks. Prices are up 1 percent this year. The three-day
rally is the longest since a streak ended Dec. 27.  Brent oil for March settlement increased $1.39, or 1.2
percent, to end the session at $118.59 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange. It was the highest settlement
since July 22.  Economists forecast applications for  unemployment benefits 
would rise to 370,000 in a Bloomberg News survey. They were
367,000 the prior week.  The four-week  moving average , a less-volatile measure of
claims, declined to 366,250, the lowest level since April 26,
2008, the Labor Department data showed. The U.S. unemployment
rate fell to 8.3 percent in January, the department said Feb. 3.  Fuel Demand  An increase in workers typically boosts consumption of
gasoline by commuters.  Total fuel demand  in the U.S. fell to
17.6 million barrels a day last week, the lowest level since
1999, the Energy Department reported yesterday.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries also cut
its 2012 forecast for global oil use by 120,000 barrels a day to
88.76 million in its monthly market report today. The Energy
Department trimmed its worldwide demand forecast for the year to
89.25 million barrels a day on Feb. 7 from 89.38 million in
January.  “Hopefully the recovering jobs market will increase oil
demand,” said  Michael Lynch , president of Strategic Energy &
Economic Research in Winchester,  Massachusetts . “A long-awaited
deal in Greece is bullish for prices.”  Greek Agreement  The austerity agreement in Greece clears the way for a swap
to cut the nation’s debt and win its second rescue in two years.
European finance chiefs meeting in Brussels are set to defer a
decision on the bailout, pressing the government in Athens to
put the plan into action.  “It’s up to the Greek government by concrete actions --
through legislation, other actions -- to convince its European
partners that the second program can be made to work,”  Olli Rehn , the European Union’s economic and monetary affairs
commissioner, said today as he arrived at the emergency meeting
of euro-area finance ministers.  The 27 EU member states accounted for 16 percent of global
oil demand last year, according to BP Plc’s annual Statistical
Review of World Energy.  The euro climbed to its highest level against the dollar
since Dec. 12, boosting oil’s appeal as an investment
alternative to the U.S. currency.  “The risk of falling down to deep recession is starting to
decrease,” said Thina Saltvedt, an analyst at Nordea Bank AB in
Oslo. “The news about Greece together with more positive signs
on the  U.S. economy  has boosted the outlook for oil demand.”  ‘Golden Cross’  Oil may extend its rally as futures approach a “ golden
cross ” formation when the 100-day moving average crosses the
200-day moving average on the daily technical chart, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The 100-day average, at $94.44 a barrel, is poised to rise
above the 200-day, currently at $94.67 a barrel, for the first
time since September. Investors tend to buy contracts when a
shorter-term moving average rises above a longer-term one.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 556,716
contracts as of 2:46 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 922,366
yesterday, 52 percent above the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.47 million contracts.  To contact the reporters on this story:
