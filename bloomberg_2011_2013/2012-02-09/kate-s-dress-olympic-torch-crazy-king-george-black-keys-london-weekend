The Black Keys are back with a blend
of raw rock, blues and soul.  The Ohio musicians play their last dates in  Europe  before
returning home for an American  tour . This is about the last
chance to see them before their stardom becomes stadium-sized.  Their new CD, “El Camino,” will be showcased in the
concerts, with Band of Skulls in support.  Tonight through Feb. 11 at Alexandra Palace, Alexandra
Palace Way, N22 7AY. While shows are selling out, some tickets
can be found online. Information: +44-20-8365-2121,

tapered rod (currently on show at the Design Museum) is a
contender for the Design of the Year award. It has 8,000 holes,
representing the 8,000 people who will carry it over 8,000
miles. An inside burner should help keep the flame alive.  Other contenders: the figure-hugging gown that Katherine Middleton wore to marry  Prince William ; an opera house that  Zaha Hadid  designed in Guangzhou,  China ; and handbags that Vivienne Westwood made with women in  Kenya .  Also shortlisted is the redesign of Bloomberg Businessweek,
(owned by Bloomberg LP, parent company of Bloomberg News.)  The Design Museum is at Shad Thames, London SE1 2YD.
