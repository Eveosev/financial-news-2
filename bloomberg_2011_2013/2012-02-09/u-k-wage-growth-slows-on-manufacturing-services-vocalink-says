Take-home pay growth at Britainâ€™s
largest publicly traded companies slowed in January by the most
in more than a year as manufacturers and services companies
scaled back wage increases, VocaLink Ltd. said.  Incomes after tax and other deductions climbed 2 percent in
the three months through January from a year earlier, compared
with 2.6 percent in the fourth quarter, the group said in a
statement in  London  today.  Wage growth at manufacturers slowed to 2.9 percent from 3.6
percent, while it cooled to 1.9 percent from 2.5 percent at
services providers. Pay increases for public employees
accelerated to 2.1 percent from 2 percent.  VocaLink, which processes 90 percent of British salaries
paid directly to bank accounts, uses salary-payment data from
more than 200 members of the FTSE 350 Index and more than 600
government-related organizations for the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
