Brazil may have almost 17,700
megawatts of wind power in operation in 2020, more than 10
percent of the country’s anticipated total installed capacity,
according to an executive with India’s  Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL)   The prediction assumes Brazil will install about 1,800
megawatts of new capacity annually, Rosana Rodrigues dos Santos,
business development director of the Pune, India-based company’s
Brazil unit, said today at a conference in  Sao Paulo .  Brazil gets about 1 percent of its power from wind now and
the Ministry of Mines and Energy forecasts that it will provide
6 percent of grid capacity by 2020.  To contact the reporter on this story:
