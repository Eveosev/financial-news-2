European authorities need to agree on
a “clear timeline” for the introduction of a new risk-based
regulatory framework for the region’s insurers such as  Allianz
SE (ALV)  and  Axa SA (CS) , the industry’s regulator said.  “Any further delays will lead to the development of
national solutions that have the potential to hinder efforts to
achieve greater European” convergence, Gabriel Bernardino,
chairman of the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions
Authority, or Eiopa, said according to prepared remarks for a
speech in Frankfurt today.  The Solvency II rules are scheduled for introduction in
2013. Regulators and the European Union have agreed to postpone
full application of the rules until 2014, following discussions
with the industry. Last month, the European Parliament delayed a
vote on the rules until March.  “What supervisors, industry and consumers would benefit
most from is certainty on the implementation of Solvency II,”
Bernardino said. He said he had “urged the European Commission,
the Parliament and the Council to agree on a clear timeline for
the Solvency II implementation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
