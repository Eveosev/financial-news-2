Chile ’s peso rose to the strongest
level in five months as Greek leaders reached a deal on
austerity measures and copper gains bolstered trade prospects
for the metal’s top-producing nation.  The peso strengthened 0.7 percent to 474.25 per  U.S. dollar 
as of 11:36 a.m. in Santiago from 477.78 yesterday, heading for
the strongest closing price since Sep 9.  Copper, which makes up more than half of Chile’s exports,
extended this year’s rally to 15 percent in  New York  after
slumping 21 percent last year. The  dollar slid  as a Greek
austerity package accord cleared the way for a swap to cut the
nation’s debt and win its second rescue in two years.  “It’s a combination of three things: the eurozone news;
flows from foreign investors betting on the peso, which you can
see in the forwards data; and it’s Thursday,” said  Osvaldo
Cruz , an economist at Banco de Credito e Inversiones in
Santiago. “Foreigners increased bets on the peso again, which
means more appreciative pressure.”  The Chilean peso generally outperforms the dollar on
Thursdays, a day when mining companies sell the proceeds of
exports in order to have pesos for paying workers.  Offshore investors in the Chilean peso forwards market
trimmed bets against the currency to $4.3 billion on Feb. 7 from
$4.5 billion on Feb. 6, according to central bank data. They
have increased bets on the currency by $1.3 billion in the past
month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
