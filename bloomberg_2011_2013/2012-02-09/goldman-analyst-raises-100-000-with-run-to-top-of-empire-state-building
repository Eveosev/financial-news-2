Brian Kuritzky ran the 1,576 steps up
New York’s tallest building in the time it usually takes him to
grab lunch at the  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  cafeteria.  Kuritzky, a 25-year-old security analyst, raised $100,000
for the  Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation  by completing the
1,050-foot stair climb at the 35th Annual  Empire State Building
Run-Up  in 12 minutes, 52 seconds last night.  “In these 12 minutes I ran up 86 flights of stairs,”
Kuritzky said in an interview from the Empire State Building’s
observation deck. “That’s a bit more productive.”  The event, which began with 15 competitors in 1977,
featured runners from 20 to 78 years of age from 25 countries
including  Australia ,  Japan ,  Mexico  and  Turkey . The race expects
to raise more than $475,000 for MMRF.  Thomas Dold of  Germany  won the men’s invitational, his
record seventh consecutive title, with a time of 10:28. Melissa
Moon of  New Zealand  (12:39) triumphed in the women’s division.  Kuritzky’s friends, family and co-workers pledged $10,000
for each of the 10 runners he beat in the men’s invitational
heat. He finished 14th, raising $100,000.  “There was an unbelievable amount of support for me once
they heard it was a charitable event,” Kuritzky said. “It’s
very humbling.”  Charity Runs  Kuritzky, whose mother died of  breast cancer  when he was
15, has run the New York City marathon and a 140.6-mile (226
kilometer) iron-distance triathlon to raise funds for  cancer
research .  The event was invitation only before last year, when MMRF
first became the benefiting charity. This year featured a wave
of about 100 charity runners, each of whom raised a minimum of
$2,500 for MMRF.  As snow fell outside, runners spread the workload between
their arms and legs by pulling themselves up along the handrail.
Moon, who won the event in 2010, said the snowy nighttime finish
was a “dream come true.”  “It’s so special to be able to finish the race at the
Empire State Building at night,” the 42-year-old New Zealander
said in an interview. “It all unfolded just the way I
visualized it.”  Backward Running  Dold also holds a world record in the 10-kilometer backward
run, according to his website. He said this was one of the
toughest races he’s had at the Empire State Building.  “The biggest thing for me is not to look at the others,”
Dold, 27, said. “I’m not able to go 100 percent the whole time,
so pacing myself is the strategy.”  A 10-team corporate division race was won by  Joe Walsh ,
Greg Maurer-Hollaender and Russell Kempf of  CBRE Group Inc. (CBG) , the
world’s biggest commercial real-estate services firm, with a
combined time of 46:01.  The course record of 9:33 was set by Paul Crake in 2003,
according to the New York Road Runners, which also organizes the
New York City Marathon. The woman’s record of 11:23 was set in
2006.  Chrissie Wellington, a four-time Ironman World Champion,
finished third in the women’s race at 13:15. The 34-year-old
from the U.K. said she didn’t decide to run until noon
yesterday, while she was in town promoting a memoir about her
athletic career.  ‘Mind Over Matter’  Wellington, who wants to enter more stair climb events,
said the Run-Up was more painful than a triathlon.  “Whether you’re doing a triathlon or you’re doing this,
it’s all mind over matter,” she said. “Your body hurts and you
want to give up, and it’s just having the mental strength to
resist those urges.”  Kuritzky said he had to push himself to continue after
reaching the halfway point.  “I hit the 43rd floor and thought, ‘Okay I made it
halfway,’ and my body said, ‘Well that’s about all I can do,’”
he said. “You have this vision of it being a lot easier and
when you’re running it’s so much more challenging.”  A former  Cornell University  soccer player, Kuritzky said he
trained mostly by running and playing sports. He said it was
hard to train on stairs because there’s no structure even close
to tall enough to simulate the challenge of the Empire State
Building.  He was at work yesterday and said he’d be up at 6 a.m. to
return to work on time this morning.  “The legs won’t be happy with me, but I will sleep very
well tonight,” he said.  -- Editors: Dex McLuskey, Rob Gloster  To contact the reporters on this story:
