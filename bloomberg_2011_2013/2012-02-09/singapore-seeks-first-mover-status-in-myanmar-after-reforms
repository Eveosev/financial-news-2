Singapore ’s government is sponsoring
a business delegation to Myanmar next week in an effort to take
advantage of opportunities as the former military dictatorship
seeks to end its global economic isolation.  International Enterprise Singapore , a government agency,
will lead a visit by 115 delegates from 74 Singapore-based
companies from Feb. 12 to Feb. 18, it said in a statement today.
The group plans to meet Myanmar President Thein Sein and several
business groups, the agency said.  “Recent reforms undertaken in Myanmar and positive
reactions from major economies augur well for the country,” Teo
Eng Cheong, IE Singapore’s chief executive officer, said in the
statement. “Singapore’s connections with overseas markets place
our companies in a strong position to be first movers in an
emerging new market like Myanmar.”  Thein Sein  visited Singapore last week and signed a deal to
tap the country’s expertise in financial management and monetary
policy as he aims to transform an economy shunned by Western
nations for more than two decades. Singapore is Myanmar’s
fourth-largest trading partner, IE Singapore said.  The Singapore Business Federation is also sponsoring the
trip. All Singapore-registered companies with paid-up capital of
S$500,000 ($401,767) must become members of the federation,
according to the group’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
