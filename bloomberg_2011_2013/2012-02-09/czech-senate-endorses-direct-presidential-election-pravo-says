The Czech upper house of parliament
approved a law allowing direct presidential election, completing
the legislative process needed for the popular vote,  Pravo 
reported, citing results of the Senate debate.  The Senate approved the change late yesterday and the first
president elected directly by the people will replace Vaclav
Klaus after his term ends in March next year, the newspaper
said.  The president, who was until now elected by lawmakers,
doesn’t hold executive powers, although he selects the political
leader who attempts to form a government after general elections
and picks members of the central bank’s rate-setting board.  To contact the reporter on this story:
