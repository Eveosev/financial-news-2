Good morning, and welcome back to the Griddle, a menu of fortified items for the busy person's media diet. The  New York Giants  won  Super Bowl  XLVI this week powered in part by renewable energy. Green Mountain Energy supplied renewable energy credits to offset power use of everything from stadium lights to sportswriters' computers. Next year's Super Bowl venue,  New Orleans  ( video ), is becoming increasingly difficult and costly to "green." Southern  Louisiana  is sinking at the same time ocean waters are rising, making coastal erosion a crisis at the Mississippi River Delta. A report issued this week by Louisiana's coastal science advisory advises policymakers to assume the Gulf of Mexico sea level will rise 1 meter by 2100. The state currently loses the equivalent of a football field of land every hour.
