Bunge Ltd. (BG) , the world’s second-
largest oilseed processor, sees U.S. corn and soybean acreage
expanding this year because of high grain prices.  “You should see more corn and soybean plantings,”  Alberto Weisser , chief executive officer of  White Plains , New York-based
Bunge, said in a telephone interview today. “Prices are still
at the levels which are very profitable.”  U.S. corn plantings rose to 91.9 million acres in 2011 from
about 86 million acres in 2008, according to U.S. Department of
Agriculture  data . Soybean acreage dropped 3.1 percent to 75
million acres last year from 2010, USDA data shows. The
department will make its initial forecast for 2012 plantings on
Feb. 23.  Farmers planted more corn in the U.S. as futures on the
Chicago Board of Trade rose to a three-year high of $7.93 a
bushel on June 9. While prices have fallen 19 percent during the
past eight months, they are still above the 10-year average of
$3.67 a bushel. Soybean prices have declined 16 percent to
$12.315 a bushel yesterday from a three-year high of $14.65 on
Aug. 31.  Weisser said “tight” inventories are supporting prices
and giving farmers an incentive to plant more crops. He declined
to provide specific acreage forecasts. Prices will come down
once stockpiles expand, he said.  Falling Corn Inventories  World corn inventories will fall to 125.4 million tons from
128.1 million projected last month, the USDA said in a report
today. Soybean stockpiles will total 60.28 million tons in the
12 months ending Sept. 30, down from 63.43 million forecast in
January and 68.9 million a year earlier, the USDA said.  Bunge said today net income for the three months through
Dec. 31 fell to $254 million, or $1.65 a share, from $301
million, or $1.95, a year earlier as a smaller sugar cane crop
in  Brazil  reduced sugar and ethanol production.  Bunge rose 5.5 percent to $62.99 at the close in  New York ,
the most since Oct. 27. Earnings exceeded the $1.53 average of
10 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Weisser said he doesn’t expect to cut hundreds of jobs like
competitors Archer Daniels Midland Co. and Cargill Inc. A
slowing growth rate in  China  won’t hurt Bunge because demand for
livestock feed is still rising, he said.  ADM said Jan. 11 it plans to cut about 1,000 jobs, or 3
percent of its workforce. Cargill, the world’s largest oilseed
processor, announced on Dec. 2 that it will cut as many as 2,000
jobs, or about 1.5 percent of its workforce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
