Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) ’s 10-year
dollar-denominated bonds rose on their debut as demand for the
notes compressed the spread after a $1 billion offering, the
biggest by an Indian company overseas in nine months.  The owner of the world’s largest refining complex sold the
5.4 percent notes due in February 2022 yielding 345 basis points
more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to an e-mailed
statement. The gap narrowed to 335 basis points as of 3:10 p.m.
 Hong Kong  time, according to Citigroup Inc. prices.  “Reliance Industries has really opened the market for
high-grade borrowers from other countries as the deal shows the
strong response to new issues,” Terence Chia, a Hong Kong-based
director in  Asia  debt syndicate at Citigroup, one of the banks
that managed the sale, said in a telephone interview. “The bond
performed well in secondary trading despite the pricing being
tight and that will just add to positive  market sentiment .”  Indian companies raised $1.22 billion selling non-rupee
bonds abroad in 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Rural Electrification Corp., a New Delhi-based state-controlled
lender to power projects, sold 200 million Swiss francs ($219
million) of 3.5 percent notes due March 2017 yesterday, the data
show.  Demand for the Reliance Industries sale was almost eight
times the amount for sale, according to the company. More than
half of the notes were sold in the U.S., while 31 percent was
allocated to accounts in Asia and the remaining 17 percent in
 Europe . Fund managers took 65 percent, insurers 15 percent,
banks picked up 10 percent, private banks 5 percent, while
government agencies subscribed to 5 percent.  Reliance Holdings USA Inc., a unit of Reliance Industries,
sold the notes at $99.481, or a yield of 5.468 percent.  Bank of
America Corp. , Barclays Plc, Citigroup, HSBC Holdings Plc and
UBS AG managed the sale, the company said in the statement.  ICICI Bank Ltd., the nation’s second-largest lender, raised
$1 billion in May selling 4.75 percent dollar notes due in
November 2016, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
