PepsiCo Inc. (PEP)  Chief Executive Officer
 Indra Nooyi  said the company has seen a turning point in the
 U.S. economy .  “It is stable and improving,” Nooyi said today in an
interview in New York, where PepsiCo was holding a meeting for
investors.  The view of the economy, and a better understanding of how
to manage unprecedented commodity inflation, gave PepsiCo
confidence to “reset” earnings expectations now, Nooyi said.  PepsiCo’s profit this year will decline about 5 percent on
a constant-currency basis and then increase at high single-digit
percentage rate starting in 2013, according to a statement
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
