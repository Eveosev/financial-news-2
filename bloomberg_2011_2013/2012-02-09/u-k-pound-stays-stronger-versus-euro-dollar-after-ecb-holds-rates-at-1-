The pound stayed stronger against the
euro after the  European Central Bank  held its key interest rate
at 1 percent.  Sterling appreciated 0.4 percent to 83.50 pence per euro at
12:47 p.m. London time. It was 0.3 percent stronger at $1.5867.  ECB policy makers meeting in Frankfurt left the benchmark
interest rate at a record low of 1 percent, as predicted by all
but two of 57 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. At a press
conference at 2:30 p.m., President  Mario Draghi  will be
questioned on whether the ECB intends to use its Greek bonds to
help the embattled nation reduce its debt.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
