Boeing Co. (BA)  said inspections of 787
Dreamliners for signs of delamination on the fuselage won’t
cause a significant impact to the production schedule for the
first  passenger jet  built chiefly of carbon-fiber composites.  There is no “immediate safety issue” from the fault, Dan
Mooney, Boeing’s vice president of development for the 787-8,
the initial Dreamliner variant being built, said today in
Bangkok. “We don’t anticipate right now that there will be a
significant impact to our production schedule.”  Chicago-based Boeing has declined to say how many jets
showed signs of delamination, a term for the separation that can
occur in a composite material when its layers crack and lose
strength. The twin-engine 787 entered service in 2011 after more
than three years of delays.  Boeing is making the checks on its own fleet and “not yet
on customer’s airplanes,” Mooney said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
