The  Saudi Fund for Development  will
provide as much as 5 billion  CFA francs  ($10.1 million) of
funding for a road linking the Congo Republic town of Ouesso
with Sangelima in neighboring Cameroon, Congo’s government said.  The project is part of a plan to improve trade and economic
links in the Central African Economic and Monetary Community,
the Economy and Planning Ministry said in a statement handed to
reporters today in Brazzaville, the capital.  The Saudi fund provides loans that are repayable over as
long as 50 years with a 10-year grace period, according to the
Saudi Arabia Market Information Resource. The cost of the loans
is “generally” 1 percent, according to its website.  The community comprises Cameroon, Congo Republic,  Central
African Republic , Gabon,  Equatorial Guinea  and Chad.  To contact the reporter on this story:
