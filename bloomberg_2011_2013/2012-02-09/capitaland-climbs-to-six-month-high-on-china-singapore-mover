CapitaLand Ltd. (CAPL) , Southeast Asia’s
biggest developer, rose to the highest in six months after CIMB
Group Holdings Bhd. raised its rating on the stock to
“outperform” from “neutral,” saying the company will benefit
from a potential monetary easing in  China .  Shares of CapitaLand, the Singapore-based developer that
get about 21 percent of revenue from China, climbed 3.5 percent
to S$2.95 as of 12:05 p.m., which would be its highest close
since July 27.  “Much focus now lies on rising expectations of moderating
policy cycle in China,” which could drive CapitaLand’s share
price, CIMB analyst Donald Chua wrote in a note to clients today.
“Some signs of loosening in credit is beginning to show. Some
banks in Shanghai are also reportedly starting to lower their
 mortgage rates .”  China’s central bank cut lenders’ reserve requirements in
December for the first time in three years to boost credit amid
moderating overseas sales. The People’s Bank of China this week
pledged to ensure loans for first-home buyers as a crackdown on
speculation threatens to trigger a slump in the  property market .  The nation’s inflation unexpectedly accelerated in January
on the boost to spending from a weeklong holiday, limiting room
for monetary easing as Europe’s debt crisis damps exports and
the property market cools.  To contact the reporter on this story:
