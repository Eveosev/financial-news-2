Pakistan State Oil Co. (PSO) , the nation’s
biggest fuel retailer, posted a 67 percent decline in second-
quarter profit because of exchange losses after the rupee
declined against the  U.S. dollar .  Net income fell to 2.1 billion rupees ($23 million), or
12.22 rupees a share in the three months ended Dec. 31 from 6.3
billion rupees or 36.86 rupees a share, a year earlier, the
Karachi-based company said in a  stock exchange  filing today.
Sales rose to 297.2 billion rupees from 225.1 billion.  The Pakistani rupee fell 2.8 percent against the U.S.
dollar in the three months ended Dec. 31, the steepest quarterly
decline in over three years, according to Bloomberg data. The
company’s operating expenses more than doubled to 4.5 billion
rupees because of the exchange loss, said Atif Zafar, research
analyst at JS Global Capital Ltd. who has a “buy”
recommendation on the stock.  Net income also fell because the company received a one-
time tax refund in the second quarter last year, inflating
profit. The government refunded 2.8 billion rupees to  Pakistan 
State Oil last year after a levy on fuel distributors was
lowered.  Pakistan State Oil  shares  fell 4 percent to 252.79 rupees
at the 3:30 p.m. local time close at Karachi Stock Exchange, the
steepest decline in over three months. The share has gained 11
percent this  year .  To contact the reporter on this story:
