Following are comments by Nigerian
Agriculture Minister Akinwumi Ayo Adesina made at the “Feeding
the World” meeting organized by Economist Conferences in Geneva
yesterday.  “The potential is there, but you can’t eat it. Agriculture
is not a social sector. Agriculture is a business, and we must
begin to take agriculture in  Africa  as a business.  “We are thinking of agriculture in  Nigeria  today as a
replacement of oil. Think of agriculture as an investment. We
see this as government enabled. The private sector is going to
have to lead it. We want Nigeria to be an agricultural and
industrialized economy.”  “We have a lot of money sitting on the balance sheets of
banks in Africa, we have to get smart about leveraging that. We
need to get smart about new instruments to finance
agriculture.”  “There’s a huge infrastructure gap in Africa. Investment
in all those things would lower the cost of transport, and also
the transactional costs for traders involved.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
