Lojas Renner SA (LREN3) , Brazil’s biggest
publicly traded clothing retailer, posted a fourth-quarter
profit that missed analysts as debt payments increased financial
expenses.  Net income fell to 119.1 million reais ($69.2 million) in
the period ended Dec. 31, down 3.3 percent from 123.2 million
reais a year earlier, the Porto Alegre-based company said in a
statement yesterday. The results missed the mean estimate of
124.7 million reais  compiled  in a Bloomberg survey of 11
analysts.  Net operational sales  increased 18 percent to 1.06 billion
reais. Sales at stores open at least a year ago rose 5.3
percent. Renner posted a financial loss of 6.1 million reais,
compared with a gain of 6.2 million reais in the fourth quarter
of 2010 as the company increased spending to pay debt, changed
its dividend policy and paid more income tax, according to the
statement.  Brazil ’s economic growth slowed to around 3 percent last
year from 7.5 percent in 2010, central bank president Alexandre
Tombini said on Feb. 2. In December, the government cut taxes on
white goods including stoves, refrigerators and energy-efficient
home appliances, as well as on some food staples, to boost
consumption, after the economy contracted in the third quarter
for the first time in more than two years.  “The tough comparison basis in the fourth quarter 2010
coupled with a still-unfavorable macroeconomic environment,
should lead to this weak performance,” Banco Bradesco BBI SA
analysts Ricardo Boiati, Alan Cardoso and Pedro Bueno wrote in a
report to clients dated Jan. 23.  Renner opened 36 stores in 2011, in line with its planned
expansion, and ended the year with 164 Renner stores, 30
Camicado stores and 3 Blue Steel pilot-stores, according to the
statement.  Renner fell 2.4 percent to 58.77 reais in  Sao Paulo 
yesterday. The shares have gained 21 percent this year, compared
with an advance of 16 percent for the benchmark Bovespa index.  The company will hold a  conference call  on the results
today at 11 a.m. New York time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
