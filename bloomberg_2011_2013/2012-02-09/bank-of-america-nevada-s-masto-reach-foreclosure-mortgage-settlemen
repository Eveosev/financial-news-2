Bank of America Corp . settled a
lawsuit over mortgage modifications brought by  Nevada , state
Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto said.  Resolution of the case is part of the $25 billion accord
that Bank of America,  JPMorgan Chase & Co .,  Wells Fargo & Co .,
 Citigroup Inc. (C)  and  Ally Financial Inc (ALLY) . reached with 49 states,
including Nevada, and the federal government to end a probe of
abusive foreclosure practices stemming from the collapse of the
housing bubble, Masto said in an e-mailed statement today.  The Nevada agreement, independent from the multistate
settlement, requires Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of
America to set aside $750 million for lien reductions and short
sales, Masto said in the statement. It also mandates that the
bank suspend foreclosure sales for any borrower eligible for a
mortgage loan modification program, according to the statement.  “The Nevada Bank of America settlement will bring in more
money for Nevadans than what would have been available under the
multistate settlement alone,” according to the statement.  Masto’s office sued Bank of America in December 2010 to
undo an agreement over home-loan modifications tied to the
bank’s Countrywide Financial unit, claiming the lender failed to
meet its obligations. The case was being litigated in federal
court in Reno.  Shirley Norton , a Bank of America spokeswoman, had ni
immediate comment on the settlement.  The case is Nevada v.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , 11-cv-00135,
U.S. District Court, District of Nevada (Reno).  To contact the reporter on this story:
