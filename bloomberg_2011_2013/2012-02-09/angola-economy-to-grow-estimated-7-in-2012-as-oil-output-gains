Angola ’s economic growth will
probably accelerate to about 7 percent this year because of
higher oil production, according to the head of Angola’s
Catholic University macroeconomic-studies department.  The economy of  Africa ’s second-biggest crude producer is
estimated to have expanded 3 percent in 2011, Manuel Alves da
Rocha, a former adviser to the country’s Ministry of Planning,
said in a telephone interview today from Lisbon.  The southern African nation has forecast oil production of
1.8 million barrels a day this year, up from an average of 1.65
million barrels in 2011, Planning Minister Ana Dias Lourenco
said Jan. 27. The government estimates the economy will expand
12.8 percent in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
