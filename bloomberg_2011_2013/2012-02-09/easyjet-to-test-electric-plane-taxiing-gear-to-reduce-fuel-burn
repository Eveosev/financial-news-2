EasyJet Plc (EZJ) ,  Europe ’s second-biggest
discount airline, plans to test an electric taxiing system next
year that is intended to save fuel.  The Electric Green Taxiing System, or EGTS, allows aircraft
to taxi using an auxiliary power unit to turn the wheels, rather
than relying on a plane’s jet engines, EasyJet said today in a
statement.  Safran SA (SAF)  and  Honeywell International Inc. (HON)  developed
the technology.  EasyJet, based in Luton,  England , estimates that about 4
percent of the fuel that it burns is consumed when planes are
taxiing at airports, with an average 20 minutes of taxi time per
flight. Safran and Honeywell plan to start fitting the device to
airplanes starting in 2016 if the trials are successful.  To contact the reporter on this story:
