Uganda ’s economic growth may ease to
“a bit below 5 percent” in the current fiscal year due to the
global slowdown, the  International Monetary Fund  said.  Growth in the 12 months ending June 30 will be between 4.5
percent and 5 percent, below the lender’s initial forecast of 5
percent in the second half of 2011, Thomas Richardson, the IMF’s
senior resident representative in Uganda, said in an e-mailed
response to questions today.  “Our current thinking is that growth will be a bit below 5
percent this year, somewhere in the neighborhood of 4.5-5, due
to the slower global growth outlook,” he said.  East Africa’s third-biggest economy expanded by 6.7 percent
in fiscal 2010-2011, beating an earlier estimate of 6.3 percent,
because of better-than-expected agricultural output, Chris Mukiza, the director of economic statistics at the Uganda Bureau
of Statistics, said on Oct. 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
