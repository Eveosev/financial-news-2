BNP Paribas SA (BNP) , Societe Generale SA
and  Credit Agricole (ACA)  SA, France’s biggest banks, are getting no
love from the nation’s politicians as elections loom.  Coming off a year when their shares had the steepest
declines since 2008, banks are being blamed for at least a part
of Europe’s economic crisis by leading contenders in the French
presidential race to be held on April 22 and May 6. Socialist
candidate  Francois Hollande  and President  Nicolas Sarkozy  have
pledged to rein in banks with taxes and controls, playing to the
electorate’s anti-finance sentiment.  “The temptation is to see finance as a foreign, hard-to-
control black box, making banks the ideal bogeyman,” said
Nicolas Veron, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a Brussels-based
economics research group. “Financial topics carry a strong
emotional dimension for French voters.”  Regardless of who wins, French banks can expect to face
transaction taxes -- even on their high-frequency trades --
greater controls on  stock options  and manager compensation and
caps on dividends. Mirroring the backlash against financial
firms in the “Occupy Wall Street” movement, the French
candidates are racing to show who’s tougher on banks.  “My enemy is finance,” frontrunner Hollande said last
month, calling it a “rival without a name, without a face.” He
said if elected he would force banks to split retail and
“speculative” investment operations, pledged a tax on all
transactions, a 15 percent increase in levies on profits and a
ban on awarding stock options to executives.  Crisis Talk  “If finance is ‘without a face,’ condemning its excesses
is becoming more visible by the day!” Didier Le Menestrel,
chairman of Paris-based Financiere de l’Echiquier, wrote in a
Feb. 3 newsletter to clients. At the end of 2011, the fund
managed 4.2 billion euros ($5.6 billion) for 4,500 clients.  BNP Paribas declined 1.14 euros, or 3.1 percent, to 35.41
euros by 1:14 p.m. in Paris trading.  Societe Generale (GLE)  tumbled
4.1 percent, while  Credit Agricole  fell 3.6 percent. Over the
past 12 months, concern about banks’ sovereign holdings, new
regulations and potential taxes have weighed on the shares. BNP
Paribas  has tumbled  37 percent, Societe Generale 49 percent and
Credit Agricole 54 percent.  For his part, Sarkozy, who has yet to declare his
candidacy, plans to unilaterally impose a 0.1 percent tax on
financial transactions starting in August. The tax will apply to
share purchases, including high-frequency trading, and credit-
default swaps.  Retreating  “There’s no reason why deregulated finance, which brought
us to the current situation, can’t participate in the
restoration of our accounts,” Sarkozy said on Jan. 29.  French banks have been embroiled in  Europe ’s crisis because
of their $620 billion-euro holdings of private and public debt
in the region’s troubled countries of Greece,  Portugal , Ireland,
 Italy  and  Spain , according to end-September figures from the
 Bank for International Settlements .  BNP Paribas, Societe Generale and Credit Agricole are
retreating, shrinking assets by about 300 billion euros and
cutting at least 5,600 jobs to comply with international capital
rules as they book Greek losses.  The three banks, together with Groupe BPCE, France’s
fourth-largest lender, had taken 5.4 billion euros in writedowns
on Greek sovereign holdings as of end-September. Societe
Generale and Credit Agricole both operate unprofitable Athens-
based consumer-banking networks.  Hamstrung  The French government, which came to the aid of the
country’s banks after  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEH) ’s 2008
collapse, hasn’t helped them in the current crisis.  It’s hamstrung by its own debt, which at 1.69 trillion
euros is 85 percent of gross domestic product.  Standard & Poor’s 
last month stripped  France  of its AAA credit rating for the
first time.  Sarkozy has instead advocated that banks, which won a
respite on their funding woes when the  European Central Bank 
provided them with 1 percent three-year loans, help governments
by using some of the money to buy euro-area sovereign debt.  “Why do big European banks keep lending unremittingly at
ridiculously low rates to states that don’t stop blaming them?”
l’Echiquier’s Le Menestrel asked in his newsletter.  U.S. money-market funds more than doubled their short-term
loans to French banks in January, ending six months during which
they reduced funding. The funds owned $8.6 billion of French
bank certificates of deposit,  time deposits , commercial paper
and repurchase agreements on Jan. 31, up from $3.2 billion in
December, according to reports from the eight largest prime U.S.
funds compiled and published in today’s Bloomberg Risk
newsletter. At the end of 2010, the figure was $78 billion.  Lower Profit  Still, France’s four largest banks may see their 2013
earnings dented by about 10 percent as a potential impact from
Socialist Party candidate Hollande’s economic program, according
to estimates by Jean-Pierre Lambert, a London-based analyst at
Keefe Bruyette & Woods Ltd.  BNP Paribas, Societe Generale, Credit Agricole and Natixis,
a unit of BPCE, may get a combined 1.7 billion-euro net-income
hit from his proposals, including about 700 million euros from
the transaction tax, the KBW estimates show.  Credit Agricole spokeswoman Anne-Sophie Gentil declined to
comment as did Societe Generale spokeswoman Nathalie Boschat and
BNP Paribas spokeswoman Julia Boyce.  High-Frequency Trades  BNP Paribas and Societe Generale this year may generate
combined trading revenue of 13.1 billion euros, according to
Jan. 6 estimates from JPMorgan Cazenove.  High-frequency trading, using fast computers and programs
designed by mathematicians, makes up 38 percent of European
trading and more than half of all U.S. stock transactions,
according to estimates from Westborough, Massachusetts-based
researcher TABB Group.  French banks don’t break down high-frequency trading
details. Such trades drew regulator attention after the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index declined 6.2 percent in less than 20 minutes
on May 6, 2010.  Unlike ordinary stock trades, for which Sarkozy’s levy
would be a fraction of brokers’ fees, taxing high-frequency
trades by 0.1 percent might make such transactions unattractive,
said Christophe Nijdam, an analyst at AlphaValue in Paris.  Sarkozy’s planned tax spares banks’ bond trading and more
complex structured product trades, which make up the bulk of
French banks’ trading revenue.  Blame Game  For the most part, the transaction tax will have “an
immaterial impact” on banks’ earnings and will probably cost
less than 150 million euros each for France’s four largest
listed banks, estimated Matthew Czepliewicz, a London-based
analyst at Collins Stewart Hawkpoint Plc.  “The negative impact on investor sentiment could however
be much greater,” he said.  Banks have opposed the unilateral application of the tax in
France, saying it will hurt Paris’s competitiveness. Also, they
point out that the current crisis stems from the excesses of
governments, not of banks.  “Blaming banks for the current crisis has limits,”
Societe Generale Chief Executive Officer  Frederic Oudea , who’s
also chairman of the French Banking Federation, said this month.
“This crisis is about public debt.”  Bank Bashing  BNP Paribas’s fourth-quarter net income probably fell 67
percent, while Societe Generale’s profit in the period may have
declined 53 percent, according to analysts estimates compiled by
Bloomberg News.  Credit Agricole warned Dec. 15 it will report an annual
loss for 2011, its first since it went public in 2001, and scrap
its dividend as it books about 2.5 billion euros in fourth-
quarter writedowns on investments and struggles to contain
losses at its Athens-based unit, Emporiki Bank of  Greece  SA.  With trouble at banks, customers will bear the brunt, said
Rebecca Healey, a senior analyst at TABB Group in  London .  “Bashing banks has become politicians’ favorite sport, but
it’s the man on the street who’ll pay the cost of any new
financial tax,” she said. “Banks will pass on the costs.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
