Gasoline shipments to the U.S. from
 Europe  are set to gain 18 percent over the next two weeks and
the number of tankers available for the route may shrink, a
Bloomberg News survey showed.  Traders and oil companies booked or were likely to hire 26
ships in the period to Feb. 23, according to the median estimate
in a survey yesterday of six shipbrokers, two traders and one
owner who specialize in shipping the auto fuel. That’s four more
vessels than in the two weeks to Feb. 16 and the largest number
since Jan. 19.  Daily returns  for tankers carrying gasoline on the
Rotterdam-to-New York voyage fell for a third day yesterday to
$10,173, according to the London-based Baltic Exchange. That’s a
51 percent plunge from the start of the year. There are 29
vessels likely to be available to haul trans-Atlantic cargoes, a
drop of one from last week, the survey showed.  The ships, known as medium-range tankers, would be able to
carry about 8.18 million barrels of the fuel, or 584,000 barrels
a day, over the next two weeks. That’s 74 percent of the 790,000
barrels the U.S.  imported  daily over the past year, according to
the  Department of Energy .  Of the vessels chartered or due to be hired, 14 have been
booked and 12 more are likely to be arranged, according to the
survey. It is based on so-called spot, or single-voyage, hiring
and excludes loadings under longer-term contracts. The survey
assumes shipments to the U.S. East Coast from northwest Europe.
Each  tanker  would normally haul about 37,000 metric tons of
gasoline, or 315,000 barrels.  Following is a table of ships chartered and likely to be
hired for the trans-Atlantic route loading over the two-week
periods from the dates shown. The table also displays the number
of ships available to be booked.  *T                             Feb. 9      Feb. 2      Change
