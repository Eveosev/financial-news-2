British Land Co. (BLND) , the U.K.’s second-
largest real estate investment trust, said third-quarter
earnings before items rose 11 percent as acquisitions and
property openings lifted rental income.  Profit excluding changes in asset values and one-time items
increased to 69 million pounds ($109 million), or 7.5 pence a
share, in the three months through December from 62 million
pounds, or 7 pence, a year earlier, the London-based company
said in a statement today. Net income fell to 68 million pounds
from 261 million pounds.  Chief Executive Officer Chris Grigg made 332 million pounds
of acquisitions in the first half of British Land’s fiscal year,
lifting annual rental income by 21 million pounds. Earnings were
also lifted by income generated by extra space in stores and
offices. Net rental income rose by 5.3 percent.  Net asset value rose to 593 pence a share from 591 pence
three months earlier, according to the statement.  British Land rose 3 pence to 508 pence in  London  trading
yesterday, valuing the company at 4.5 billion pounds. The stock
has climbed about 10 percent this year, exceeding the 8.5
percent gain for the 11-member  FTSE 350 Real Estate Investment
Trust Index .  To contact the reporter on this story:
