The U.S. Energy Department’s natural-
gas inventory report, scheduled for release at 10:30 a.m. in
 Washington , will show that supplies fell 2.8 percent last week,
according to a survey of Bloomberg users.  The government’s Natural Gas Storage Report will show that
inventories declined 83 billion cubic feet in the week ended
Feb. 3 to 2.883 trillion cubic feet, according to the survey.  Natural gas for March delivery rose 2.3 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $2.471 per million British thermal units on the New
York Mercantile Exchange at 10:20 a.m.  Bloomberg compiles the anonymous survey based on estimates
by at least 100 users each week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
