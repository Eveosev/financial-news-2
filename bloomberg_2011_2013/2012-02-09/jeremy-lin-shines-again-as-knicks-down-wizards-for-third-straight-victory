Jeremy Lin scored 23 points and had a
career-high 10 assists as the  New York Knicks  defeated the
 Washington Wizards  107-93 for their third straight victory.  In the absence of top scorer  Carmelo Anthony , who injured
his groin against the  Utah Jazz  three days ago, and Amar’e Stoudemire, who will miss four games following the death of his
brother in a car accident,  Tyson Chandler  had 25 points and 11
rebounds for New York.  Lin has become a sensation since he scored 25 points in a
win against the  New Jersey Nets  on Feb. 4 and had a career-high
28 points while making his first start in a victory against the
Jazz two nights later.  “After the last game, I wouldn’t have imagined this,” Lin
told reporters at the Verizon Center in Washington last night.
“But thankful. Very thankful.”  The only player from  Harvard University  to reach the
 National Basketball Association  since Ed Smith made 11
appearances for the Knicks in 1953-54, Lin is boosting the
appeal of the Knicks at home and in  Asia . The 6-foot-3, 200-
pound (1.91 meter, 91 kilogram) point guard is the first
American-born player of Chinese or Taiwanese descent to join the
league.  Within 24 hours of the Utah win, the volume of Knicks
tickets selling in the secondary market was four times higher
than the daily average, with about 1,125 tickets changing hands.  Ticket Prices Surge  Tickets for tomorrow’s game against the  Los Angeles Lakers 
at Madison Square Garden are going for $141 to as much as $9,905
for courtside seats on the secondary market, according to
Seatgeek.com. The average price of a Knicks-Lakers ticket rose
13 percent to $312.51.  While Modell’s Sporting Goods Inc. doesn’t yet carry Lin’s
No. 17 jersey, the 23-year-old is on the company’s radar, said
Jamal Miller, manager at its Times Square location in  New York .  “If our customers dictate that this is something they want
us to do, we’re going to take a serious look at it,” Miller
said in a telephone interview on Feb. 7.  Lin’s performances in three straight games show that he
isn’t a flash in the pan, Knicks coach  Mike D’Antoni  said.  “I think it’s real,” D’Antoni told reporters when asked
about Lin’s ability. “The thing that’s for real is his vision,
which won’t change, his speed, which won’t change, his knowledge
of the game, which won’t change. I think it can only get
better.”  Slow Start  Last night, Lin had failed to score as the Knicks trailed
23-17 at the end of the first quarter.  Lin got his first points with eight minutes to play in the
second quarter when he stole the ball from Jordan Crawford and
raced down the court for a layup to cut the Wizards’ lead to
31-28. Two more layups and a jump shot followed as the Knicks
led 52-46 at halftime.  Lin opened the second half by scoring off a pass from
Chandler before  Washington  got 10 straight points to retake the
lead at 56-54. Lin made a pair of free throws to tie it and,
with the Knicks trailing 64-63, added two more points from the
free-throw line before two driving layups and a dunk took his
tally for the quarter to 12 points as the Knicks led 77-68.  Lin didn’t score again until 4:33 remained in the fourth
quarter, when a driving layup made it 98-84 for New York. After
making a free throw, his final contribution was to set up a tip-
in for Chandler to make it 101-84.  John Wall  scored a game-high 29 points for the Wizards. The
only other Washington player to reach double figures was Trevor Booker, with 17.  The Wizards (5-21), have now lost 12 of their last 14
meetings with the Knicks (11-15), including eight straight.  Also last night, it was Cleveland 99, Los Angeles Clippers
92; Orlando 102, Miami 89; San Antonio 100, Philadelphia 90;
Milwaukee 105, Toronto 99; Atlanta 97, Indiana 87; Detroit 99,
New Jersey 92; Chicago 90, New Orleans 67; Memphis 85, Minnesota
80; Dallas 105, Denver 95; and Houston 103, Portland 96.  To contact the reporter on this story: Nancy Kercheval in
