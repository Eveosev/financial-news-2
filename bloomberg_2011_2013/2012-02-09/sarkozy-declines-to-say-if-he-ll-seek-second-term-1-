French President  Nicolas Sarkozy 
declined to say if he’ll seek a second term in an interview with
Figaro magazine to be published on Feb. 11.  Asked if he is ready to announce his candidacy, Sarkozy
said “before my own interests, I have consider those of my
mandate” as president.  Sarkozy plans to change the unemployment benefit system,
making it compulsory after “a period of several months” for
the jobless to undertake vocational training in order to
continue to receive their payments.  “After this training, which will be compulsory, the job
seeker will be obliged to accept the first offer corresponding
to the job for which he’s been re-trained,” he said in the
Figaro magazine interview.  The move comes as  France  seeks to shrink its public debt,
which at 1.69 trillion euros ($2.24 trillion) represents 85
percent of gross domestic product.  Sarkozy plans a national referendum on the proposed benefit
reform and possibly another on immigration policy, he said in
the Figaro interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
