Farm productivity will need to rise
“significantly” to feed a growing world population, said
Harald von Witzke, professor of agricultural trade and
development at Berlin’s Humboldt University. Following are
comments he made at the “Feeding the World” meeting organized
by Economist Conferences in Geneva yesterday.  “Supply growth is constrained by the availability, or lack
thereof, of land and water. Declining agricultural productivity
growth is what we’ve seen for a long period of time. General
neglect of agriculture, agricultural research, neglect of
agricultural productivity growth. There is a need for
significant growth in agricultural productivity if we are to
feed the world in 2050. We need productivity growth in this
world, we know how to do it, we just need to do it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
