Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti 
said the  International Monetary Fund  needs to be more flexible
in its crisis management and the lender should acknowledge the
budgetary progress made by Greek’s government.  “Where I perhaps see room for improvements also on the
part of the IMF would be in having a broader understanding of
specific situations in which the strict adherence to a model
might prevent a pragmatic solution of a problem,” Monti said
today at the Peterson Institute in Washington.  The IMF defended its approach in negotiating the terms of a
new loan to Greece, saying it’s not forcing the country to take
steps such as budget cuts. Greek political leaders struck a deal
on a package of austerity measures, clearing the way for a swap
to cut the nation’s debt and win its second rescue in two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
