Canada â€™s  Northern Lion Gold Corp. (NL) 
plans to sign a six-month agreement with the owners of a tract
of land in Cyprus to prospect for gold,  Phileleftheros  reported
today, citing a company statement.  The agreement with the six owners of the property in the
Paphos district of western Cyprus, which data indicate may
contain a commercially viable gold vein, is conditional on
approval by the Vancouver Stock Exchange, the Nicosia-based
newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
