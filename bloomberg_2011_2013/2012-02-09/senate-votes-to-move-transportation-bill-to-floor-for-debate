The U.S. Senateâ€™s surface-
transportation legislation was moved to the full floor for
debate, allowing members to offer amendments.  The bill combines recommendations from committees including
banking, finance, environment and public works and would provide
$109 billion for transit, highway and bridge projects over two
years.  President  Barack Obama  supports the Senate bill, his Office
of Management and Budget said in a statement today.  The House plans a vote Feb. 17 on its five-year, $260
billion version of the bill, Majority Leader  Eric Cantor , a
Virginia Republican, said today.  The House bill is H.R. 7. The Senate bill is S. 1813.  To contact the reporter on this story:
