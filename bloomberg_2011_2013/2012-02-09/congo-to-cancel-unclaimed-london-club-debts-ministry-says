Democratic Republic  of Congo will
cancel debts to any banks that are part of its London Club of
creditors if they are unclaimed by April 30, the Ministry of
Finance said.  “Congo asks all banks holding debt in the context of the
London Club to come forward by April 30, 2012, at the latest,”
Finance Minister Matata Ponyo wrote in letter dated Sept. 19 and
published on the central bank website today. “After that, all
undeclared debt will be considered null and void.”  Congo is trying to clear its debts to the group of
commercial banks after the International Monetary Fund and  World
Bank  approved a package to relieve the country of about 90
percent of its $13.7 billion external debt in July 2010. London
Club debts were about $81 million at the time, according to a
2010 IMF report. The total could fall to about $6 million after
negotiations with the banks are finished, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
