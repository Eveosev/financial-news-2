Sims Metal Management Ltd. (SGM)  fell the
most in more than three years in Sydney trading after the
world’s biggest recycler of scrap metal said it will book a one-
time charge of A$614 million ($664 million) in the first half.  The  shares  plunged as much as 12 percent, the biggest
decline since Jan. 23, 2009, before closing down 7 percent at
A$14.20 in Sydney.  Sims will take the non-cash charge to write off goodwill on
acquisitions and joint ventures of scrap metal recycling
companies, particularly in  North America , before the global
financial crisis in 2008, the company said today in a statement.
New York-based Sims, which has operations in 23 U.S. states,
said first-half results were affected by continued difficult
operating conditions for the traditional metals business.  “These conditions adversely impacted operating margins and
equity accounted profits of joint venture partners,” the
company said. It expects to report earnings on Feb. 17.  Underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization, excluding the impairment charge, will be about
A$141 million, compared with A$138 million a year earlier, it
said. The charge won’t affect its dividend policy, growth
strategy and its share buyback plan, Sims said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
