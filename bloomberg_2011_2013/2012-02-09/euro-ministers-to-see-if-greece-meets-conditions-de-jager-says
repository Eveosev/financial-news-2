Euro-area finance ministers meeting
in Brussels today will hear from Greece and the so-called troika
if Greece has met the conditions for a second bailout program,
Dutch Finance Minister Jan Kees  de Jager  said.  “We don’t yet know if this is sufficient” for Greece to
qualify for a new 130 billion-euro lifeline, De Jager told
reporters in Brussels today.  “We are going inside to hear what the troika, which is the
European Commission, IMF and ECB, has to tell us,” he said. “I
don’t know if it will be sufficient. We have demanded very
strict conditions as  Europe  and they now say they are meeting
this, we really have to check that’s the case.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
