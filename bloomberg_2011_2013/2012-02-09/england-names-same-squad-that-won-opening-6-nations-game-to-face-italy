England  rugby coach Stuart Lancaster
wonâ€™t change any of the 22 players who defeated  Scotland  last
week for the 6 Nations match against Italy in two days.  The same starting 15 and bench -- which included seven
players making their first England appearance -- will travel to
Rome. England, the defending champion, beat Scotland 13-6 on
Feb. 4, and Italy lost to  France  30-12.  France will host Ireland in the second game on Feb. 11,
while  Wales  takes on Scotland in Cardiff the following day.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
