England fast bowler  Chris Tremlett 
underwent surgery on a bulging disc in his back last night in
 London .  The Surrey player returned from England’s tour of the
United Arab Emirates early because of the medical problem. The
30-year-old has played 11 Test matches for England and taken 49
wickets. He debuted against India at Lord’s in London in 2007.  “The player’s rehabilitation program will be closely
supervised by the England medical team in conjunction with
Surrey,” the England and Wales Cricket Board said today in an
e-mailed statement. The ECB didn’t set a time for his return.  England is playing Pakistan in the U.A.E., and lost the
Test series 3-0. The sides will now play four one-day
International matches and three Twenty-20 games.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
