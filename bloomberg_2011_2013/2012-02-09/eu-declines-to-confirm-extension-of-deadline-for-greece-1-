The European Commmission’s economic-
affairs spokesman,  Amadeu Altafaj , said he had no knowledge of a
15-day extension for  Greece  to come up with 300 million euros
($398 million) of budget reductions after talks in Athens
stalled overnight of pension cuts.  “I cannot confirm that,” he told reporters today in
Brussels before a meeting of euro-area finance ministers. “I am
not aware of such an extension; I’ve seen press reports, I
checked them and no one seems to be aware of such an
extension.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
