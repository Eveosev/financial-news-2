The president of Great Atlantic Group
Inc., a  Staten Island , New York-based real estate consulting
firm, was convicted at a trial of running a Ponzi scheme that
cost investors more than $14 million.  Prosecutors told jurors in Brooklyn, New York, that Joseph
Mazella, 52, solicited money by falsely claiming that he’d
invest client money in real estate projects including a
warehouse and golf course in upstate New York. After a two-week
trial, jurors today found Mazella guilty of  securities fraud ,
 wire fraud  and  money laundering , U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch in
Brooklyn said in a statement.  “Mazella’s victims, many of whom are senior citizens on a
fixed income, turned to him to ensure their security in their
golden years,” Lynch said. “Instead, their security was raided
to fund his fraud, and they will feel the impact of Mazella’s
crimes for the rest of their lives.”  Mazella used investor money to pay his mortgage, make
payments on a Porsche and cover other expenses, Lynch said. He
took in more than $14 million from January 2007 to December
2010, telling investors he’d provide a fixed rate of return, she
said.  He faces as much as 25 years in prison when sentenced.  In a  Ponzi scheme , money from new investors is used to pay
earlier investors.  The case is U.S. v. Mazella, 11-cr-00300, U.S. District
Court, Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn).  To contact the reporter on this story:
