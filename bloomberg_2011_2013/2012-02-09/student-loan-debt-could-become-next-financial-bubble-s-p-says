Student-loan debt may become the next
U.S. asset bubble as rising tuition costs climb while household
income stagnates,  Standard & Poor’s  said.  Colleges and universities have been struggling with
declining endowments and lower state funding at the same time
students are facing an inability to repay loans in a tough
economy, the ratings company said today in a statement.  “Student-loan debt has ballooned and may turn into a
bubble,” S&P said. “There are more defaults and downgrades for
some student loan asset-backed securities.”  Federal and private student-loan debt is approaching $1
trillion and surpassed credit-card debt for the first time in
2010, according to  Mark Kantrowitz , publisher of FinAid.org, a
college grant and loan website. Under U.S. law, student-loan
debt -- unlike credit-card borrowings -- can rarely be
discharged in  bankruptcy court .  President Barack Obama last month proposed linking federal
aid to a college’s ability to control tuition costs. The plan
calls for increasing campus-based aid only for schools that
limit tuition-cost increases and penalizing those that don’t.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
