A former  Takeda Pharmaceutical
International Inc. (4502)  executive was accused of using inside
information to make more than $63,000 trading in  call options ,
according a lawsuit filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission.  Brent Bankosky, a former director in Takeda’s business
development group, used non-public information to trade in
advance of Takeda’s announcement of transactions involving  Cell
Genesys Inc. (CEGE)  and  Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc. (3437127Q) , the SEC said
in a civil complaint filed today in Manhattan federal court.  Bankosky also used information about confidential
discussions between Takeda and two other drug companies, Arena
Pharmaceutical Inc. and AMAG Pharmaceutical Inc., according to
the agency. Bankosky failed to profit from his trades in those
companies’ securities, the SEC said.  Elissa Johnsen, a spokeswoman for  Osaka , Japan-based Takeda
Pharmaceutical Co.’s North American unit, didn’t immediately
return a voice-mail message seeking comment on the SEC suit.
Bankosky’s lawyer, Robert Heim, also didn’t immediately return a
voice mail seeking comment.  The case is SEC v. Bankosky, 12-CV-1012, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
