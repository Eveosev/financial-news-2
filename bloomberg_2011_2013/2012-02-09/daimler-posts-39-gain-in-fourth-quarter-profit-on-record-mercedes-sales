Daimler AG (DAI)  (DAI) forecast higher 2012
profit than analysts had predicted, propelled by record demand
for Mercedes-Benz brand cars.  Earnings before interest and taxes this year will be “in
the magnitude” of 2011’s 8.98 billion euros ($11.9 billion),
the Stuttgart, Germany-based company today. That compares with
an 8.17 billion-euro average estimate of 21 analysts.  “The outlook is above expectations,” lifted by Mercedes
sales and stable prices, said  Daniel Schwarz , a Commerzbank
analyst in Frankfurt, who recommends buying the shares.  Chief Executive Officer Dieter Zetsche has vowed to
retake the luxury-car lead from  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) 
after slipping last year to third behind  Volkswagen AG (VOW3GY) ’s Audi.
Mercedes plans to introduce 10 new models by 2015, including
compacts and the CLS Shooting Brake, a wagon-like variant of the
$71,300 four-door coupe. Analysts had predicted a profit drop
this year because of costs to bring the cars to market.  Daimler raised the 2011 dividend to 2.20 euros per share,
higher than the previous year’s 1.85 euros, after net income for
2011 climbed 29 percent to 6.03 billion euros. Analysts had
predicted a dividend of 2 euros.  The shares  rose  as much as 2.33 euros, or 5.2 percent, to
46.95 euros, the highest since Aug. 3, and were up 3.8 percent
as of 12:17 p.m. in  Frankfurt  trading. The stock has gained 37
percent in 2012, valuing the company at 49.4 billion euros.  Profit Surge  Fourth-quarter  earnings  before interest and taxes surged 39
percent to 2.18 billion euros from 1.56 billion euros a year
ago, the company, which is also the world’s biggest maker of
heavy-duty trucks, said. The figure compared with a 2.17
billion-euro average estimate. Revenue rose 10 percent to 29.1
billion euros.  Mercedes aims to beat last year’s record of 1.26 million
deliveries, growing faster than a forecast pace of 4 percent for
the global auto market, on demand for the revamped B-Class
compact and a new A-Class hatchback.  The models are part of a line of five small cars that the
brand is developing to win over younger customers. Mercedes also
plans to double the variants of the S-Class flagship to six
after a new version is introduced in 2013.  Mercedes’s cars division reported an Ebit margin of 8.2
percent in the fourth quarter, slipping from 8.3 percent a year
earlier. The  company  is targeting a 10 percent margin from 2013.
Daimler reiterated today that the brand aims to sell 1.5 million
autos by 2014 and 1.6 million by 2015.  The  Daimler (DAI)  unit aims to overtake its closest rivals after
falling behind last year. In the first nine months of 2011,
Mercedes reported an Ebit margin of 9.4 percent, compared with
12.8 percent at BMW and 12.2 percent at Audi.  ‘Permanently Ahead’  “A direct comparison with our competitors shows that some
of them have already achieved what we still aim to attain,”
Zetsche said at a press conference in Stuttgart. “When we fully
exploit our potential, we will be permanently ahead of the
competition, and that’s exactly what we aim to do.”  Mercedes will spend about 2 billion euros to expand
production in  China  and is investing an additional $2.4 billion
in its U.S. plant. The carmaker will also open a new 800
million-euro factory in  Hungary  this year in a bid to reclaim
the top spot in  luxury vehicles  that it lost in 2005.  “For Daimler, 2012 will be a transition year because of
their new small cars,” said Stefan Bauknecht, a  fund manager  in
Frankfurt at Deutsche Bank AG’s DWS. Daimler’s “headwinds will
turn to tailwinds in 2013, while BMW’s growth momentum slows”
as the 5- and 7-Series sedans age, he said.  Fourth-quarter Ebit at the trucks division, which also
makes Freightliner vehicles in the U.S. and Fuso models in  Asia ,
rose 5 percent to 422 million euros, giving it a margin of 5.1
percent compared with 5.9 percent a year earlier.  The trucks unit, which expects sales to increase this year
on growth in the U.S. and a recovery in  Japan , is targeting an
average return on sales of 8 percent across a business cycle
starting in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
