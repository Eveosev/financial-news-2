The ruble appreciated for a sixth day
against the dollar as crude climbed, boosting the outlook for
the currency of the world’s biggest energy exporter.  The Russian currency added 0.4 percent to 29.6775 by 10:49
a.m. in Moscow. The ruble was little changed at 39.4815 per euro
and up 0.2 percent at 34.0893 versus the central bank’s target
dollar-euro basket.  Oil futures climbed as much as 49 cents to $99.20 a barrel
in  New York  as a U.S. government report showed refineries
processed more crude last week.  The 14-day relative strength index for the ruble’s rate
against the U.S. currency dropped to 25.1022, the lowest on a
closing basis since May 2011. A reading lower than 30 signals
the currency may have rallied too quickly and may weaken.  Investors pared bets the ruble would depreciate, with non-
deliverable forwards showing the Russian currency at 30.0352 per
dollar in three months, compared with expectations of 30.0880
yesterday. Russia’s 2020 dollar bonds were little changed, with
the yield at 4.274 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
