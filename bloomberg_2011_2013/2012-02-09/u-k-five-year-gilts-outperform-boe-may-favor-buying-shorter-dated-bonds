U.K. five-year notes outperformed
longer-maturity gilts after the  Bank of England  signaled it may
favor shorter-dated debt purchases in its next round of so-
called quantitative easing.  Sterling strengthened versus most of its 16 major
counterparts after the central bank said it will boost its bond-
buying program by 50 billion pounds ($79.3 billion), less than
the 75 billion pounds forecast by some economists. The central
bank bank altered the maturity bands of its debt purchases,
indicating it will buy more securities maturing in three-to-
seven years than in the previous round.  “The proportion that is spent in the front end is
increased, so that the relative scarcity of the shorter-dated
gilts becomes more of an issue,” said  Sam Hill , a fixed-income
strategist at  RBC Capital Markets  in  London . “It’s rational
that the curve has steepened and will continue to do so.”  The five-year yield fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 1.09 percent at 3:58 p.m. London time. The
1.75 percent note due January 2017 rose 0.175, or 1.75 pounds
per 1,000-pound face amount, to 103.17.  The 10-year yields rose three basis points to 2.23 percent
and the 30-year yield climbed 11 basis points to 3.36 percent.  The extra yield, or  spread , that investors demand to hold
30-year gilts over five-year notes, widened as much as 16 basis
points to 228 basis points, the biggest increase since Dec. 1.  Quarter of Gilts  The Monetary Policy Committee’s new  asset-purchase target 
of 325 billion pounds represents more than a quarter of current
outstanding gilts. The increase was predicted by 34 of 50
economists in a Bloomberg News survey. Fifteen forecast a 75
billion-pound increase and one saw no change. The central bank
also held its key  interest rate  at 0.5 percent.  The new gilt-purchase bands are three-to-seven years,
seven-to-15 years, and more than 15 years, the Bank of England
said. During the round of purchases announced on Oct. 6 the
bands were three-to-10 years, 10-to-25 years and more than 25
years. The central bank will buy assets evenly across the bands,
it said.  The three-to-seven year band is 45 percent smaller than the
previous three to 10-year band, so “there will be more demand
for the bonds left in this sector,”  John Hydeskov , chief
analyst at Danske Bank A/S in London, wrote in an e-mailed note.
“Shorter-dated bonds will be more supported by QE going
forward, while longer-dated bonds will have less support and the
yield curve should therefore steepen.”  Gilts have handed investors a loss of 1.6 percent this
year, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  Pound Gains  The pound strengthened 0.2 percent to $1.5842, and rose 0.6
percent to 122.53 yen. The currency weakened 0.2 percent to
83.98 pence per euro.  “Today’s developments have been beneficial for the
pound,” Michael Derks, chief strategist at broker FXPro
Financial Services Ltd. in London, wrote in a note to clients.
“The BOE’s preparedness to continue to engage in responsible
monetary accommodation is gaining it some plaudits at this time
of unprecedented fiscal austerity.”  The pound also rose against the dollar after a report
showed U.K. manufacturing production increased more than
economists forecast.  Factory output climbed 1 percent in December from the
previous month, when it fell a revised 0.1 percent, the  Office
for National Statistics  said. Economists forecast a 0.2 percent
increase, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  Sterling weakened against the euro after  Greece ’s
government reached a deal on austerity measures required for a
130 billion-euro ($173 billion) financing package.  The pound has weakened 1.3 percent this year according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-nation currencies. The dollar declined 3.3 percent,
and the euro dropped 0.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
