Indian stocks rose to a six-month
high, erasing losses, as  Greece ’s leaders neared an agreement on
further spending cuts needed to receive a rescue package.  HDFC Bank Ltd. (HDFCB) , the second-biggest private lender, climbed
to a record.  Infosys Ltd. (INFO) , which gets more than a fifth of its
revenue from Europe, gained to near a one-month high. Sterlite
Industries ( India ) Ltd. rallied to a three-month high, the most
among 30 companies on the benchmark BSE India  Sensitive Index. (SENSEX)   The Sensex gained 0.7 percent to 17,830.75 at 3:30 p.m.
close in Mumbai, its highest level since Aug. 3. The measure
erased an intraday loss of 0.6 percent. The S&P CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index
on the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. jumped 0.8 percent
to 5,412.35. The BSE 200 Index rose 0.9 percent.  Greek Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  and the leaders of the
three parties supporting the government “agreed on all the
points of the program with the exception of one which requires
further elaboration and discussion” with lenders, according to
an e-mailed statement from the premier’s office. They failed to
resolve a dispute over pension cuts. The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index
advanced 0.5 percent as investors speculated that Greece will
accept the spending cuts needed to obtain further aid.  Foreign  funds  have invested a net $3.6 billion in Indian
stocks this year, compared with an outflow of $512 million in
2011, data from the regulator show. The flows have fueled the 14
percent rally in the Sensex, helping the gauge recoup more than
half its 2011 losses. The measure trades at 15.6 times future
earnings, compared with 19.4 times at end of 2010. The MSCI
Emerging Markets Index trades at 10.5 times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
