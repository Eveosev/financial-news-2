Rachel Whiteread, the first woman
artist to win the Turner Prize, has been commissioned to create
a gold-leafed bronze frieze for the facade of  London ’s
 Whitechapel Gallery .  The frieze -- which will fleck the top of the facade with
gilded leaves and branches -- will go on show in June, in time
for the London 2012 Olympic Games, and will cost an unspecified
total to which the Art Fund is contributing 200,000 pounds
($317,480), making it the largest donor.  “I specialize in making the unnoticed noticed,” said
Whiteread, who lives in the surrounding East End area of London,
at a Whitechapel Gallery news conference. She said the gallery’s
location on a crowded thoroughfare had led hurried pedestrians
to ignore its architectural features.  Whiteread is best known for a 1993 sculpture called
“House”: a life-sized cast of the inside of a terraced East
London home that was earmarked for demolition and torn down a
year later. She won the Turner Prize in 1993.  Whitechapel Director Iwona Blazwick said Whiteread was
chosen because “she always works with what’s there, and draws on
the rich architectural heritage.”  “We were walking in the mountains in  Italy  when Rachel
snapped a branch off a tree and said ‘This is it!’,” recalled
Blazwick, describing the moment that the design was revealed to
Whiteread. “We did a schedule there and then.”  Whiteread’s design echoes the existing Tree of Life motif
on the century-old building’s terra-cotta facade. It also
incorporates negative casts of a row of windows that once
existed at that spot.  To contact the writer on the story:
