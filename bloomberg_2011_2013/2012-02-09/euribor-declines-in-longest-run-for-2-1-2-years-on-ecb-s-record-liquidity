The  rate  at which European banks say
they see each other lending in euros for three months dropped
for a 36th day, the longest run of declines in 2 1/2 years, as
record borrowing from the central bank eased funding costs.  The euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor, for such loans
dropped 0.7 basis point, or 0.007 percentage point, to 1.07
percent, according to data from the European Banking Federation.
That’s the longest run of losses since August 2009, and is the
 lowest  rate since January 2011, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The rate has fallen every day since the  European Central
Bank  allotted a record 489 billion euros ($650 billion) of
three-year loans to 523 banks on Dec. 21 to keep credit flowing
amid the region’s sovereign debt crisis. The ECB plans to hold a
second longer-term refinancing operation for such loans on Feb.
28, with full allocation a day later. It will probably keep the
main refinancing rate at a record-low 1 percent today, according
to a Bloomberg survey of economists.  “The decline in three-month Euribor is being driven by the
massive amount of liquidity in the system,” said Eric Wand, a
fixed-income strategist at Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets in
London. “The LTRO at the end of the month should keep the
pressure on.”  Private Sector Loans  Three-month Euribor may continue to slide, according to
futures contracts. The implied rate on the contract expiring in
March was little changed at 0.895 percent at 10:20 a.m.  London 
time. It fell to 0.845 percent on Feb. 1, the least for the
front Euribor futures contract since June 2010.  “Forward rates are indicating Euribor may fall further,”
Wand said.  Loans to euro-area households and companies contracted the
most on record in December as the debt crisis damped demand for
credit and banks tightened lending. Private-sector borrowing
declined 0.7 percent from November, the most since records began
in 1991, the ECB said on Jan. 27.  A measure of European banks’ reluctance to lend to one
another reached the lowest level in almost four months today. A
lower reading signals a greater willingness to lend.  The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between the
borrowing benchmark and overnight indexed swaps was at 72.85
basis points, the lowest since Oct. 11. The spread has narrowed
since reaching 100.6 basis points on Dec. 1, the most since
February 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
