Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC)  fell as much
as 2.7 percent after Canada’s largest insurer announced that
Chief Financial Officer Michael Bell is leaving after less than
three years in the post.  Manulife fell 2.4 percent to C$11.82 at 10:33 a.m. in
 trading  on the Toronto Stock Exchange, the biggest one-day
decline in two weeks.  Bell, 48, is returning to Philadelphia, where his family
moved in June 2010, Manulife said today when it reported fourth-
quarter results. A replacement hasn’t been named. Bell’s
departure “eclipses” the company’s earnings announcement, said
 John Aiken , an analyst at  Barclays Capital  in Toronto.  “This is far from a positive as Michael had shown a very
firm grasp on the company’s operations and, in our view, will be
difficult to replace,” Aiken said in a note to clients.  Manulife, the owner of Boston-based John Hancock Financial,
said that it had a fourth-quarter net loss of C$69 million
($69.3 million), or 5 cents a share. Profit excluding items was
also 5 cents a share and better than expected, according to RBC
Capital Markets analyst Andre-Philippe Hardy.  (Manulife will hold a conference call at 2 p.m. To listen, dial
