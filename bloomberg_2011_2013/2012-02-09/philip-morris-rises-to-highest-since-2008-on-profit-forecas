Philip Morris International Inc. (PM)  rose
to the highest since its spinoff by Altria Group Inc. almost
four years ago after forecasting profit this year that was
higher than analysts estimated.  The world’s largest publicly traded tobacco manufacturer
gained 2.8 percent to $80.00 at 4:02 p.m. in New York, the
highest closing price since March 2008.  Profit per share in 2012 will be $5.25 to $5.35, the New
York-based company said today in a statement. The average
estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was $5.20.  Chief Executive Officer Louis Camilleri boosted shipments
of Marlboro and the company’s nine other biggest brands in 2011,
leading to higher global market share for the fourth straight
year.  Philip Morris  anticipates stronger growth in Asia in 2012,
Camilleri told analysts today on a conference call.  “There was some fear that the guidance would not be
positive, given European concerns, but it came in stronger than
most analysts had expected,”  Jack Russo , an analyst at Edward
Jones & Co. in  Des Peres , Missouri, said today by telephone. He
rates Philip Morris as “buy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
