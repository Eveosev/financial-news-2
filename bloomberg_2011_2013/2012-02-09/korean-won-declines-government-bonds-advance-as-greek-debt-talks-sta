South Korea’s won declined and
 government bonds  advanced as Greek leaders struggled to agree on
economic measures needed for a second aid package because of a
dispute over pensions.  Greek Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  and party leaders
agreed on all the points of the program except one which
required discussion, according to an e-mailed statement from the
premier’s office today. Eighteen out of 19 economists forecast
the Bank of Korea will hold  rates  at 3.25 percent for an eighth
month. The decision is due around 10 a.m. local time.  “Greece’s failure to reach agreement is putting downward
pressure on the won, but declines will be limited as the overall
trend is for higher-yielding currencies to strengthen supported
by liquidity,” said Lee Jung Hyun, a Seoul-based currency
dealer at the Industrial  Bank of Korea . “The Bank of Korea’s
decision will have little impact on currencies if rates are on
hold as expected.”  The won declined 0.2 percent to 1,118.35 per dollar as of
9:16 a.m. in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
 Kospi (KOSPI)  Index of shares fell 0.4 percent, its first drop in four
days.  South Korean producer prices rose 3.4 percent from a year
earlier in January, the slowest pace in 17 months, according to
figures released today.  Government bonds rose for the first time in four days. The
yield on the government’s 3.5 percent bonds due September 2016
fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.55
percent, Korea Exchange Inc. prices show. The rate was at 3.57
percent yesterday, the highest since Dec. 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
