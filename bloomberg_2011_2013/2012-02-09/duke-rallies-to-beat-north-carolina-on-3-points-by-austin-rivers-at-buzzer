Austin Rivers’s 3-pointer at the
final buzzer capped a 13-2 closing run by  Duke University  in its
85-84 victory at the University of North Carolina, the latest
chapter in one of college basketball’s best rivalries.  Duke trailed 82-72 with 2:09 left before holding the Tar
Heels to two free throws while hitting three 3-pointers and two
jump shots in the closing minutes.  The Blue Devils now have won five of the past six games
between the intrastate rivals, which are separated by eight
miles and have been playing each other in basketball since 1920.  “I just shot it with confidence and God made the ball go
in,” Rivers said in a courtside television interview while his
father, Boston Celtics coach Doc Rivers, celebrated in the
stands. “This is the best day of my life.”  Duke entered the game ranked 10th in the nation in the
Associated Press men’s college basketball poll and  North
Carolina  was fifth. Syracuse defeated Georgetown in overtime and
Kansas beat Baylor in other games last night matching teams
ranked in the top 12.  Rivers, a freshman, led Duke (20-4) with 29 points in the
game at the Dean Smith Center in  Chapel Hill , North Carolina.
Harrison Barnes had 25 points for the Tar Heels (20-4). Both
teams have 7-2 records in Atlantic Coast Conference games.  North Carolina leads the series, which ESPN in 2000 ranked
as the third-greatest North American sports rivalry, 131-102.
The Tar Heels had a 31-game home winning streak snapped.  Duke’s Late Rally  After Barnes’s jumper gave the Tar Heels an 82-72 lead,
Tyler Thornton and Seth Curry hit 3-pointers 21 seconds apart to
pull Duke within four points. Ryan Kelly hit a jumper for Duke
with 1:09 remaining and  Tyler Zeller , who had 23 points for
North Carolina, hit one of two free throws.  Kelly then pulled Duke back within one point on a shot with
18 seconds left that accidentally was tipped into the basket by
Zeller. With 13 seconds left, Zeller made one of two free
throws, leaving the Tar Heels up by two points as the clock
wound down.  The victory gave Duke its 16th consecutive 20-win season
and improved Blue Devils coach  Mike Krzyzewski ’s record against
North Carolina to 37-36.  “We fought like crazy to keep it close and then in the
last few minutes we got hot,” Krzyzewski told reporters. “To
hit a game-winner like that is storybook. (Rivers) had a
magnificent game. That’s what he was put on this planet for.”  At the Carrier Dome in Syracuse,  New York , Kris Joseph hit
a 3-pointer with 27 seconds left in overtime to give second-
ranked Syracuse a 64-61 victory against Georgetown.  The victory in the Big East Conference game gave Syracuse’s
 Jim Boeheim  his 880th career win, moving him into sole
possession of third place among Division I men’s coaches.  Boeheim had been tied for third with former North Carolina
coach Dean Smith. The only coaches with more victories than
Boeheim are Krzyzewski (920) and  Bob Knight  (902).  Kansas Defeats Baylor  Joseph had a career-high 29 points to lead the Orange (24-
1). No. 12 Georgetown fell to 18-5.  In Waco,  Texas , Jeff Withey scored a career-high 25 points
as the seventh-ranked  Kansas  Jayhawks defeated sixth-ranked
Baylor 68-54 in a Big 12 showdown to sweep the two-game season
series from the Bears.  Kansas (19-5) took control with a 37-7 run that began late
in the first half and extended into the second half against
Baylor (21-3).  To contact the reporter on this story:
