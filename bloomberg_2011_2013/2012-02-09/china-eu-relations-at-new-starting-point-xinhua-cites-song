China  and the European Union are
“indispensable partners” and the relationship is at a “new
starting point,” Xinhua News Agency said today, citing Vice
Foreign Minister Song Tao.  China and the EU are more dependent on each other given the
current global situation, Xinhua said, citing Song, who made the
comments before the 14th China-EU leaders’ meeting in Beijing on
Feb. 14.  China “supports a stable euro and is confident about it,”
Song said, as cited by Xinhua. The two sides will talk about
economy, trade, finance and trade protectionism at the coming
meeting, Xinhua said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
