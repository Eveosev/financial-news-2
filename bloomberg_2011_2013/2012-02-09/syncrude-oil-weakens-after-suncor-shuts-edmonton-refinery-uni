The discount for Syncrude oil
weakened after  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU)  shut a unit at its Edmonton
refinery in  Alberta  following a process upset.  “The unit was safely shut down, but there was some flaring
as a result,” Sneh Seetal, a company spokeswoman, said in an e-
mail. She declined to say which unit had been shut.  The discount for  Syncrude (USCSSYNS)  against West Texas Intermediate
