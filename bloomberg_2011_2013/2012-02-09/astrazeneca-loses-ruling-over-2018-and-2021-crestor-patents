AstraZeneca Plc (AZN)  lost a U.S. appeals
court bid to protect its best-selling drug, Crestor, from
generic competition until as late as 2021.  A judge was correct to dismiss AstraZeneca’s lawsuits
against  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA)  and other generic-
drug makers over patents on the cholesterol drug that expire in
2018 and 2021, the  U.S. Court of Appeals  for the Federal Circuit
in  Washington   said  today. The court is still considering the
validity of the main patent on Crestor, which expires in 2016.  Crestor generated $6.6 billion in sales last year for
London-based AstraZeneca, almost 20 percent of the company’s
total revenue. The two patents cover methods of using the active
ingredient rosuvastatin calcium for certain types of patients.  The generic-drug companies had sought approval to sell
copycat medicine only for treatments not covered by the patents.
The appeals court ruled that, based on that pledge, AstraZeneca
didn’t have the right to sue to block the competition.  AstraZeneca sued over the 2018 and 2021 patents after
winning a ruling that upheld the validity of the 2016 patent,
which covers the main compound of the drug. Arguments on the
compound patent case were heard in October.  In addition to Petah Tikva, Israel-based Teva, the world’s
biggest generic-drug maker, the other companies sued include
Apotex Inc.,  Aurobindo Pharma Ltd. (ARBP) , Cobalt Pharmaceuticals Inc.,
Mylan Inc., Par Pharmaceutical Cos. and  Sun Pharmaceutical
Industries Ltd. (SUNP)   The case is AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP v. Apotex Corp.,
2011-1182, -1183, -1184, 1185, -1186, -1187, -1188, -1189, and
-1190, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
(Washington. The lower court case is AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals
LP v. Apotex Corp., 10-338, U.S. District Court for the District
of  Delaware  (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
