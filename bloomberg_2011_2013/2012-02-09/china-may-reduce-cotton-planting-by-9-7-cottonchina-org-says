China , the worldâ€™s largest cotton
grower and consumer, may reduce plantings of the fiber by 9.7
percent this year, according to cottonchina.org, an industry
website owned partly by Cotlook Ltd. and the China Cotton
Association.  Farmers in Xinjiang, the biggest producing area, will
reduce planting by 5 percent, it said. Total area planted with
the fiber is likely to fall to 71.95 million mu (4.8 million
hectares), it said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
