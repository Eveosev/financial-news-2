DNB ASA (DNB) , the Nordic region’s second-
largest bank, reported a 24 percent drop in fourth-quarter
profit after loan losses and costs swelled.  Net income fell to 4.09 billion kroner ($713 million) from
5.35 billion kroner a year earlier, Oslo-based DNB said in a
statement today. That beat the 3.57 billion-krone average
estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Loan losses
jumped to 926 million kroner from 529 million kroner.  “This was another quarter affected by financial turmoil,”
Chief Executive Rune Bjerke said in the statement. “There was a
high level of activity in the bank, with a close to 1.7 billion
kroner rise in income.”  DNB faces slowing growth in Norway as the  International
Monetary Fund  warns the Nordic country’s exports may suffer amid
a weaker global outlook. At the same time, the financial
regulator wants banks to target more rigorous lending standards
to cool what  Robert Shiller , the co-creator of the S&P/Case-
Shiller home-price index, has dubbed Norway’s housing bubble.  Net interest income, the difference between what a bank
earns from lending and what it pays on deposits, rose 10 percent
to 6.79 billion kroner in the quarter. The lender said its core
Tier 1 capital ratio, a key measure of financial strength, rose
to 9.4 percent of its risk-weighted assets at the end of the
quarter, from 9.2 percent a year earlier. Net loan losses rose
to 926 million kroner from 529 million kroner.  Norway , the world’s seventh-largest oil exporter, has been
shielded from the worst of  Europe ’s debt turmoil as its crude
revenue generates surpluses and unemployment remains close to 3
percent. The central bank in December cut its benchmark  interest
rate  by 50 basis points to 1.75 percent to protect exporters
from the fallout of the debt crisis.  DNB shares, which slumped 29 percent last year, have gained
11 percent in 2012 as Europe’s lenders benefit from unlimited
liquidity from the  European Central Bank .  To contact the reporter on this story:
