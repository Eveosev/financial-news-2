Health insurance companies must
provide easy-to-understand summaries of benefits and coverage
and a glossary of terms under final rules  issued  today by the
Obama administration.  The final draft removed a section providing an example on
how much it would cost a patient to be treated for  breast
cancer , bowing to arguments made by the lobby group America’s
Health Insurance Plans that the condition was too complex to be
easily summarized.  “There was concern expressed that breast cancer was a more
complicated treatment scenario, that the treatment scenario
wasn’t always standardized across issuers,”  Steve Larsen ,
director of the U.S. Center for Consumer Information and
Insurance Oversight, said on a call announcing the final rule.  Consumers will get the  forms  when they apply for a new plan
or have their coverage renewed. The eight-page document outlines
a patient’s co-payments for drug, doctor and hospital care, any
deductibles or limits on coverage, and what services the plan
does and doesn’t cover.  The rules will let consumers make an “apples to apples”
comparison of insurance plans, U.S. regulators said. “We want
this to be useful to as many people as we can,” Larsen said.  The form currently provides examples on how much it might
cost a patient to get treated for  Type 2 diabetes , as well as a
normal delivery of a baby. As many as six other examples may be
added in the future, Larsen said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
