OPEC will raise shipments by 0.3
percent this month as increases in exports slow with the end of
peak winter demand, according to tanker-tracker Oil Movements.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will  ship 
23.22 million barrels a day in the four weeks to Feb. 25, up
from the 23.15 million barrels in the period to Jan. 28, the
Halifax, England-based researcher said today in an e-mailed
report. The figures exclude  Angola  and Ecuador.  “For long-haul crude, the winter is over, and it’ll be May
before we see signs of any increase re-appear,” Roy Mason, Oil
Movements’ founder, said by telephone. “European demand in
general is terrible.”  OPEC’s Vienna-based secretariat reduced its estimate of
global oil consumption for this year by 120,000 barrels a day to
88.76 million a day in its monthly market report today. That
means oil demand growth will slow to 900,000 barrels a day in
2012 from 1 million last year. OPEC’s output levels are
exceeding requirements by almost 5 percent, data from the report
show.  Exports from Middle Eastern producers, including non-OPEC
members Oman and Yemen, will increase 0.4 percent to 17.37
million barrels a day in the four-week period, according to Oil
Movements.  Crude on board tankers will average 474 million barrels in
the four weeks, up 1.7 percent from 465.92 million in the month
to Jan. 28, Oil Movements said.  Oil Movements calculates shipments by tallying tanker-
rental agreements. Its figures exclude crude held on board ships
as floating storage.  OPEC’s members, which pump 40 percent of the world’s oil,
are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador,  Iran ,  Iraq , Kuwait,  Libya ,
 Nigeria , Qatar,  Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates and
Venezuela.  To contact the reporter on this story:
