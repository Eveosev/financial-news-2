Southern Copper Corp. (PCU) , the largest
producer of the metal in Peru and  Mexico , fell for a third day
in four as earnings failed to meet investor expectations and the
company postponed the startup of a  copper mine .  Southern Copper, a unit of Grupo Mexico SAB, declined 0.5
percent to $34.80 at 12:41 p.m. in  Lima  after earlier falling as
much as 1.4 percent.  “The earnings report wasn’t as favorable as the market had
hoped,” said Leoncio Altamirano, a trader at Lima-based
brokerage Juan Magot y Asociados SAB. “Investors also feel the
company won’t recover what they invested in the stalled Tia
Maria project.”  Southern said fourth-quarter net income climbed 9 percent
to $537 million, or 64 cents a share, from $492 million, or 58
cents, in the year-earlier period. Analysts expected a profit of
70.4 cents a share, according to data compiled by  Bloomberg (PCU) .  A drop in copper prices offset a 24 percent gain in
Southern’s output. Average copper prices fell 13 percent in the
quarter from a year earlier on investor concern the slowing
global economy and escalating European debt crisis will pare
Chinese demand.  The company today delayed the startup of its $900 million
Tia Maria mine in  Peru  to 2015 as the company prepares a new
environmental impact study for the project, suspended last year
by environmental protests.  To contact the reporter on this story:
