Facebook Inc. (FB) ’s privately traded
shares have risen 10 percent since the dominant social network
filed for an initial public offering, pushing its market value
past $100 billion, according to  SharesPost Inc.   SharesPost managed the auction of 150,000 shares of
Facebook’s Class B common stock at a clearing price of $44,
compared with $40 Feb. 2, according to a statement from the
private-stock marketplace yesterday. That values Facebook at
$102.6 billion based on an estimated 2.33 billion shares,
including stock tied to options that may be issued later.  That valuation would place Facebook higher than  PepsiCo
Inc. (PEP) , the snackmaker that traces its roots back more than a
century, and Citigroup Inc., the third-biggest U.S. bank by
assets. Facebook filed last week for a $5 billion IPO, and
people familiar with the matter have said Chief Executive
Officer  Mark Zuckerberg  is considering a sale that would value
the company at $75 billion to $100 billion.  “The upside for long-term investors is pretty shaky at
these prices,” said  Erik Gordon , a professor at the Ross School
of Business at the  University of Michigan . “It’s got to be a
Google and a half for the stock to move higher” in the long
term.  At $100 billion, Facebook would be valued at 26.9 times
trailing 12-month sales, or more than double Google Inc.’s
valuation when the search-engine operator went public in 2004.
Google’s value has increased almost eightfold since the
offering, approaching $200 billion.  Revenue at  Menlo Park ,  California-based Facebook  jumped 88
percent last year to $3.71 billion, while net income climbed by
almost two-thirds to $1 billion.  Share Structure  The valuation based on private-market transactions may
change depending on the actual share count after the IPO. As of
Dec. 31, Facebook had 117.1 million Class A shares and 1.76
billion Class B shares outstanding. There also are about 379
million restricted stock units that vest later, as well as about
259 million shares that may be issued if outstanding  stock
options  are exercised, the prospectus shows.  Jeremiah Hall, a spokesman for San Bruno, California-based
SharesPost, confirmed the auction. Jonathan Thaw, a spokesman
for Facebook, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
