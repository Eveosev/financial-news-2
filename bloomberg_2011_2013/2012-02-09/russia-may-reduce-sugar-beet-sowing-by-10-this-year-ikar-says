Russia ’s farmers may sow 10 percent
fewer sugar beets in the spring in order to refine all of the
crop in the next season which starts Aug. 1, the Institute for
Agricultural Market Studies said.  Russia planted sugar beets over 1.3 million hectares (3.2
million acres) and harvested a record crop of 46.3 million
metric tons in 2011, according to state statistics data.  Refineries, which worked this season at full capacity, used
about 39 million tons of beets to produce 5 million tons of
sugar by the end of January, according to Sugar Producers’ Union
data.  Part of the crop was lost because Russia’s limited refining
capacities could not handle it all while it was in a good
condition,  Yevgeny Ivanov , a senior sugar analyst at the
institute known as Ikar, said by phone in Moscow today. To avoid
future losses, farmers may reduce the beet-sowing area to about
1.17 million hectares this year, he said.  Sugar production is slowing down now with 12 out of a total
of 79 refineries working on beet processing, the sugar union
 said  on its website earlier this week.  Top producers include Prodimex Group with about 1.1 million
tons of sugar,  OAO Razgulay Group (GRAZ)  with about 570,000 tons,
Dominant Group with more than 560,000 tons,  Ros Agro Plc (AGRO)  with
about 560,000 tons and Sucres et Denrees SA with more than
300,000 tons, Ivanov said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
