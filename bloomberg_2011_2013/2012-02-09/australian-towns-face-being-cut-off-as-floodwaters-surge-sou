Thousands of Australians remain
stranded and more towns face being cut off as floodwaters surge
south through the nation’s eastern river systems, threatening
cotton crops in the world’s third-largest shipper of the fiber.  The towns of Goodooga, Brewarrina, Walgett and Lightning
Ridge, about 730 kilometers (453 miles) northwest of Sydney, are
expected to be isolated by flooding, New South Wales State
Emergency Services said in a  statement  on its website today.
Residents in St George, in southern Queensland, are unlikely to
be able to return to the town before Feb. 11 following  mandatory 
evacuations, according to  Queensland Police .  Floodwaters have damaged homes, ruined cotton crops and
caused cattle sales to be canceled, one year after natural
disasters cost the Australian economy A$9 billion ($9.7
billion). Flooding in the two eastern states this year may have
caused A$50 million of damage, the federal government said last
week. A natural disaster has been declared in 21 areas in New
South Wales as authorities build levees in an effort to hold
back the torrent.  The deluge may damage as much as 10 percent of the nation’s
cotton crop, according to  Olam International Ltd. (OLAM)  Emergency
services have warned residents along the affected rivers to
relocate livestock and equipment to higher ground and stock up
on food, fuel, medicine and other essential items.  To contact the reporter for this story:
