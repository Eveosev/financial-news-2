West Virginia University  may have to
pay at least $20 million to leave the  Big East  Conference,
 CBSSports.com reported , citing unidentified people in college
football.  To exit for the  Big 12  conference in 2012 and potentially
lower the fee, West Virginia is trying to persuade a future  Big
East  member to join this year instead of 2013, the sports
network reported.  The University of  Memphis  yesterday said it will join the
Big East for all sports beginning with the 2013-14 academic
year.  Memphis joins the Providence, Rhode Island-based Big East
two weeks after the U.S. Naval Academy said it would join the
conference in football as of 2015. Memphis’s addition will give
the conference 11 football teams until Navy begins play, one
short of the 12 teams necessary under National Collegiate
Athletic Association rules to hold a conference title game.  Pittsburgh and Syracuse announced their departure from the
Big East for the Atlantic Coast Conference in September,
followed by  West Virginia ’s announcement it will join the Big
12. The Big East responded by adding Navy, Boise State and San
Diego State for football, as well as Southern Methodist, Central
Florida, Houston and Memphis for all sports. All those schools,
except Navy, are scheduled to join in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
