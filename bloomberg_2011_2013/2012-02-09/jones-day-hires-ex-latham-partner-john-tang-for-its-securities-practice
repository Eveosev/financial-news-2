Jones Day (1113L)  hired  John Tang , a former
partner at  Latham & Watkins LLP , as the firm expands its
securities litigation team in San Francisco.  Tang, 42, the former co-chairman of Latham’s securities
litigation and professional liability practice group, will join
the San Francisco office as a partner in the securities
litigation and Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement
practice, Jones Day said today in a statement.  “John is an excellent addition to our firm and strengthens
our litigation team here in San Francisco,”  Robert Mittelstaedt , the office’s partner-in-charge, said in the
statement.  Tang has represented companies and executives in matters
including securities class actions, shareholder derivative
suits, merger litigation and SEC investigations, the firm said.  Jones Day , which has more than 320 lawyers in five
California offices, was  ranked  as the seventh-highest-grossing
law firm in 2010 by the American Lawyer, a trade magazine, with
more than $1.62 billion in revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
