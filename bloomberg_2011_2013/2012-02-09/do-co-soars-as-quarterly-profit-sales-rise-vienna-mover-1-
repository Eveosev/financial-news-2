Do & Co Restaurants & Catering AG ,
which prepares food for events and airline flights, rose the
most almost four months in Vienna trading after the catering
company said nine-month profit increased 45 percent.  Shares  advanced  4.5 percent to 29.9 euros in the Austrian
capital at the 5:30 p.m. close of trading, the biggest increase
since Oct. 19.  Nine-month profit rose to 14.9 million euros ($20 million)
from 10.3 million euros a year earlier, after sales rose 9.5
percent to 361.8 million euros.  While Do & Co is expecting “difficult market conditions,”
it said that its management is confident to be able to continue
the “successful path” of the last years, according to a
statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
