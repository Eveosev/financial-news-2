Germany ’s economic “weak phase”
will end quickly after uncertainty from the euro-area debt
crisis prompted Europe’s biggest economy to slow in the final
quarter of last year, the government said.  A pickup in industrial orders and brightening economic
indicators point to the weak period ending “soon,” the Berlin-
based  Economy Ministry  said today in its monthly report for
February.  Even so, the crisis still poses a risk to the German
economy. “Despite the important political decisions to
stabilize the euro-area debt crisis taken in the past few weeks
and months, the risks to the economy in Germany remain high,”
the ministry said.  The ministry said the “determination of all euro countries
to concretely tackle the outstanding budget problems and poor
competitiveness will be decisive in bringing a return to dynamic
growth across  Europe .”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
