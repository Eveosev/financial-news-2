Unicharm Corp. (8113) ,  Japan ’s biggest
diaper maker, forecasts operating margins will widen as it
doubles sales in  China  to more than 100 billion yen ($1.3
billion) by March 2014.  Total  operating margins  might widen to as much as 18
percent on the back of growth in Asia and the company is
considering spending more than 10 billion yen on a fifth factory
in China, the world’s most populous nation, President Takahisa Takahara said in an interview in Tokyo on Feb. 6.  Takahara said he is counting on rising incomes in  Southeast
Asia  and China to win more customers for its products and is
considering adding factories to tap demand. Unicharm, which
competes with  Kao Corp. (4452)  and  Procter & Gamble Co. (PG)  in Japan, is
expanding overseas as the market for baby diapers is shrinking
at home because of an aging population.  “This company is bullish on China and their claims are
substantiated,” said Mikihiko Yamato, an analyst with JI Asia
in Tokyo, who recommends buying shares of Unicharm. The company
may gain market share from Chinese competitors with its higher-
quality products, he said.  Unicharm’s Chinese diaper market may overtake the 200
billion yen Japanese market as early as 2016, Takahara said.
Unicharm’s margins in China are at 18 percent, he said.  The company had sales of 44.7 billion yen in China for the
year to March. Shares of Unicharm have gained 29 percent in
 Tokyo  in the past year.  “There will be more users when income levels rise,” said
Takahara. “As our production bases increase, the distribution
costs will come down.”  Margins  The company had an operating margin of 12.4 percent in the
year ended March 31, 2011, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Widening that to 18 percent would bring it closer to
 Procter & Gamble Co.’s  19.2 percent, according to  data  compiled
by Bloomberg. P&G is the world’s largest consumer-products
company.  P&G, which sells Pampers, has 44.8 percent of market share
for diapers in China and Hong Kong-listed Hengan International
Group Co. has 12.9 percent in 2010, according to Euromonitor
International. Unicharm has 8.3 percent in 2010, according to
Euromonitor data.  The company had sales of 376.9 billion yen and operating
income of 46.6 billion yen in the year ended March 31, according
to its  annual  report. Overseas sales accounted for 42 percent of
sales and operating income from operations abroad topped 20
billion yen for the first time in the last fiscal year.  “When we think of profits, the highest region is in
 Asia ,” said Takahara.  To contact the reporter on this story:
