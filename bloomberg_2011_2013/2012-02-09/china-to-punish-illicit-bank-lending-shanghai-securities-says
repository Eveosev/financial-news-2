China’s  banking regulator  told
lenders that illegal off-balance-sheet lending will be severely
punished, the  Shanghai Securities News  reported, citing bankers
it didn’t identify.  Violations include certain methods of lending via wealth
management products, transferring loans among banks and granting
loans through intermediary banks, the Chinese-language newspaper
said today. The report didn’t specify the punishments that the
China Banking Regulatory Commission may impose.  Off-balance-sheet lending has surged as the government
tightened loan quotas, after a credit boom designed to support
growth amid the global financial crisis began to fuel inflation
and asset-bubble risks. The CBRC banned lenders from
transferring holdings in commercial bills to trust companies as
part of efforts to stem practices that circumvent regulatory
rules, a person with knowledge of the matter said last month.  Phone calls to the regulator’s Beijing-based media office
seeking comment on today’s report went unanswered. CBRC Chairman
 Shang Fulin  said the regulator would seek to contain risks in
off-balance-sheet operations this year, according to a  statement 
on the watchdog’s website Jan. 8.  The CBRC will crack down on entrusted loans that illicitly
use banks’ own funds rather than simply transferring funds
between two parties, as such transactions are meant to do, and
will inspect lenders’ commercial-bill financing operations,
Shanghai Securities said, without saying where it got the
information or providing details.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
