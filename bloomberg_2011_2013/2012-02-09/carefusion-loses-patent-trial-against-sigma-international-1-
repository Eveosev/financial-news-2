CareFusion Corp. (CFN)  lost a federal  jury
trial  over claims that Sigma International General Medical
Apparatus LLC infringed a patent for technology used in
intravenous infusion pumps.  Jurors in San Diego today rejected CareFusion’s bid for as
much as $171 million in damages over claims that its rival’s
Spectrum pump infringes a U.S. patent owned by CareFusion. Sigma
International denied the claims at trial.  “I did not think that we were infringing,” Roger
Hungerford, president of Medina, New York-based Sigma
International, said after the verdict. “We try real hard to
respect all competitors’ intellectual property and if we think
we might be infringing something we would design around it.”  John Allcock, an attorney for San Diego-based CareFusion,
had no immediate comment and said company officials may issue a
statement later.  The patent at issue relates to a force-sensor assembly for
infusion pumps used in the health-care industry, according to
court filings. Both companies manufacture and sell infusion
pumps, which control the amount and rate of the flow of fluid
and drugs administered to a patient through intravenous tubes.  U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw presided over the trial.  CareFusion fell as much as 1 percent on news of the verdict
from yesterday’s close of $24.92 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. The stock was trading at $24.80 at 3:23 p.m.
New York time.  The case is CareFusion 303 Inc. v. Sigma International,
3:10-cv-0442, U.S. District Court, Southern District of
 California  ( San Diego ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
