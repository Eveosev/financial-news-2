SVG Capital Plc (SVI) , the biggest backer
of private equity firm Permira Advisers LLP, said the value of
its assets increased 11 percent last year as its holdings in
companies including  Hugo Boss  outperformed stock markets.  Net asset value rose to 350.2 pence a share at the end of
December, including the company’s own valuation of its fund
management division, London-based SVG said in a statement today.
SVG received distributions of 253.4 million pounds ($401
million), up from 123 million pounds in 2010, the firm said.  SVG marked up the value of its stake in Hugo Boss and
Italian luxury label Valentino Fashion Group SA by 96 million
pounds. Distributions included 70 million pounds from a sale of
SVG’s stake in Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd., a Chinese casino
operator.  “The positive momentum has continued into 2012,” Chief
Executive Officer Lynn Fordham said in the statement. “Permira
isn’t seeing much evidence of any meaningful softness in
earnings.”  SVG said in December it would return 170 million pounds to
shareholders and widen its range of investments to include
buyout firms other than Permira.  To contact the reporter on this story:
