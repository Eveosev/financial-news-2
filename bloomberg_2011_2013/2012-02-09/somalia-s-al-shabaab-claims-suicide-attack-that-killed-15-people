Somalia’s al-Shabaab militia claimed
responsibility for a suicide bombing yesterday at the Muno Hotel
in the capital, Mogadishu, in which at least 15 people died.  “The holy suicide attack occurred as it was intended
because the hotel housed so-called lawmakers who compete with
Allah to draft a constitution,” Sheikh Abdi Aziz Abu Musab, a
spokesman for the rebel movement, said in comments on Radio
Andulus, a broadcaster controlled by the militia.  At least 15 people died and “dozens” were injured in the
attack, Lieutenant-Colonel Hassan Barise, a spokesman for
Somalia’s police force, said in a phone interview yesterday. A
member of parliament was injured, he said.  Somali lawmakers are drafting a new constitution as part of
a so-called road map that will end the rule of the country’s
United Nations-backed transitional administration later this
year. Since it was formed in 2004, the government, headed by
President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, has failed to end a two-
decade long civil war in the Horn of Africa country.  Al-Shabaab, which the U.S. accuses of having links to al-
Qaeda, began an insurgency against the government in 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
