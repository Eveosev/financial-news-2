Rents for iron-ore carrying  Capesize (BCAVRT) 
ships may rise almost fourfold this quarter as slower speeds and
strengthening demand buoy vessel usage, according to DNB
Markets, a unit of DNB Bank ASA,  Norway â€™s biggest bank.  Earnings for the vessels may advance to as high as $20,000
a day, DNB shipping analyst Nicolay Dyvik wrote in a report
today. The vessels are making $5,233, according to the London-
based  Baltic Exchange .  To contact the reporter on this story:
