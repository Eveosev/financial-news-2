Stockmann Oyj (STCBV) , a Finnish retailer,
jumped the most in almost four months in Helsinki trading as the
department store division propelled sales gains in January.  Stockmann climbed as much as 8.5 percent to 16.92 euros,
the biggest intraday gain since Oct. 14, and was trading up 6.9
percent at 12:31 p.m. in the third-best performance today on the
 OMX Helsinki All-Share Index. (HEX)   “The start of January was very encouraging,” Anna-Karin Envall, an analyst at AGB Sundal Collier Holding ASA in
Stockholm, said by phone today.  The company, which is based in the Finnish capital, said
revenue in January increased 9.8 percent from a year earlier TO
151 million euros ($200 million). The department-store unit’s
sales increased 9.9 percent, pushed by a 24 percent increase in
international operations. The Finnish department-store
business’s sales climbed 2.9 percent, held back by a lower level
of merchandise on sale, it said.  The level of discounting in Finland is a “fairly good
indication also for the margins during this season,” Envall
said. The “relief” of results and growth in  Russia  are a part
of the equation, but January revenue was the “most important”
part, she said.  Stockmann’s department store in  St. Petersburg , Russia,
which opened in November 2010, was the source of strongest
growth at the division in January, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
