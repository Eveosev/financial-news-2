Oil options volatility rose as crude
climbed for a third day after U.S. first-time unemployment
claims dropped and Greek political leaders struck a deal on
austerity measures.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
April, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 29.8 as of 2:30 p.m. in New York, up from
29.5 yesterday.  Crude for February delivery rose $1.13 to settle at $99.84
a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  after rallying to
an intraday high of $100.18.  “People have been buying upside out of the money calls,
from $120 all the way to $150, just on the lottery ticket that
something happens in the  Middle East  or the  Persian Gulf ,” Ray Carbone, president of Paramount Options Inc. in New York, said
by phone. “The oil has been anywhere from $95 to $104 and we
have not broken out of that range. We just continue to gyrate
between that range and we’re still right in the middle of it.”  The most active options in electronic trading today were
April $90 puts, which slipped 14 cents a barrel to 75 cents at
2:37 p.m. with 2,471 lots trading. Next were April $95 puts,
which dropped 28 cents to $1.71 on 1,749 lots, and March $102.50
calls, which gained 7 cents to 42 cents on 1,625 lots. A
contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude. Puts and calls were
almost evenly split.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information on floor trading, where the
bulk of options trading occurs, the next business day.  Puts accounted for 38 percent of the volume yesterday.
December 2015 $200 calls were the most actively traded options,
with 7,850 lots changing hands. They added 29 cents to $1.42 a
barrel. The next-most active options, April $140 calls, were
unchanged at 10 cents a barrel on volume of 7,775 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with 41,886
contracts. Next were December $150 calls with 37,258 lots and
December $100 calls with 34,185.  To contact the reporter on this story:
