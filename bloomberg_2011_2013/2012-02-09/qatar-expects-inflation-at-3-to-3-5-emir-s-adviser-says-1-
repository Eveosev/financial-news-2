Qatar  expects inflation to range
between 3 percent and 3.5 percent this year, said Ibrahim
Ibrahim, an economic adviser to the emir.  “Inflation is not going to be a problem for the next five
or six years because we have witnessed it, we experienced it, we
know how to deal with it,” Ibrahim told reporters today in
Doha, the capital.  The country, which plans to invest in roads, stadiums and a
new city before hosting the 2022 soccer  World Cup , will increase
spending in the fiscal year starting April 1, Ibrahim said. The
government’s strategy is based on “big spending, especially on
infrastructure,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
