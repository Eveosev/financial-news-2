The  European Central Bank  should
participate in efforts to reduce  Greece ’s debt, said
Luxembourg’s  Jean-Claude Juncker , who leads the group of euro-
area finance ministers.  “The ECB must look, within the framework of its
independence, what sort of contribution it can make to the debt
reduction of Greece,” Juncker told reporters in Brussels today.
