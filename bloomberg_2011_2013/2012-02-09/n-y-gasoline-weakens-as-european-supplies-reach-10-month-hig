New York  gasoline weakened as
European stockpiles rose to the highest level in 10 months and
cargoes of the fuel head to the U.S.  Gasoline inventories in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp gained
for a fifth week to the most since April 7, according to PJK, a
researcher in the Netherlands. Shipments of the fuel to the U.S.
from Europe are set to reach a three-week high, a Bloomberg News
survey showed.  The premium for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in  New
York Harbor (MOSNY87P) , fell 0.25 cent to 1.63 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 1:59 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery rose
2.56 cents to $3.0196 a gallon.  Traders and oil companies booked or were likely to hire 26
ships in the period to Feb. 23, according to the median estimate
in a survey yesterday of six shipbrokers, two traders and one
owner who specialize in transporting the auto fuel.  The ships, known as medium-range tankers, would be able to
carry about 8.18 million barrels, or 584,000 barrels a day, in
the next two weeks. Thatâ€™s 74 percent of the 790,000 barrels the
U.S. imported daily in the past year, according to the Energy
Department.  The discount for ultra-low-sulfur diesel versus heating oil
futures in the  Gulf Coast  narrowed 1.25 cents to 3.5 cents a
gallon.  Valero Energy Corp. has begun shutting units for planned
maintenance at the St. Charles refinery in Louisiana,  Bill Day ,
a spokesman for the company at the headquarters in  San Antonio ,
said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
