Peru’s benchmark  borrowing costs  in
dollars fell to a three-month low after  Greece  finalized a deal
on austerity measures it needs to secure financial aid, easing
concern that Europe’s debt crisis will worsen.  The extra yield investors demand to own Peruvian government
bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries fell six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 194 at 12:26 p.m. in Lima, according to
JPMorgan Chase & Co. That’s the lowest since Nov. 8.  The Greek government agreed with the European Commission,
European Central Bank and  International Monetary Fund  on
austerity measures, Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  said today.
The accord clears the way for a deal to cut the nation’s debt
and win its second rescue in two years.  A financial “meltdown” in  Europe  that consumes Italy and
Spain “is less of a possibility right now,” said Pedro Tuesta,
a Washington-based Latin America economist at 4Cast Inc. “It’s
not going to be pretty, but it’s not going to be as ugly as
people were thinking either.”  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 5.63 percent, according to prices compiled
by Bloomberg. The security’s price rose 0.14 centimo to 114.75
centimos per sol.  The sol was little changed at 2.6875 per U.S. dollar, from
2.6880 yesterday, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
