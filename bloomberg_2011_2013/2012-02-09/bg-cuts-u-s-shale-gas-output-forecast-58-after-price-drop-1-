BG Group Plc (BG/) , the U.K.’s third-
largest oil and gas producer, cut is forecast for U.S. shale-gas
output in 2015 by 58 percent because of lower fuel prices.  BG expects to produce the equivalent of 80,000 barrels a
day of gas from U.S. shale fields in 2015, down from an earlier
forecast of 190,000 barrels, said Chief Executive Officer  Frank
Chapman . The company has trimmed its output forecast in the
period to “a bit more” than 1 million barrels, down from the
previous forecast of 1.2 million barrels a day.  “We agree actually with the market view that the prices in
the longer term will sit somewhere in the $4 to $6” per million
British thermal units range, Chapman told reporters today. “Our
view is they will be in a lower part of that.”  U.S. gas futures fell about 39 percent in the last year to
$2.48 today on increased production and milder winter weather.
BG, based in Reading,  England  is examining plans to export
liquefied natural gas from the U.S. to Europe or  Asia , where
prices are as high as $17 per million British thermal units.  The driller will cut the number of rigs it has operating at
U.S. gas-shale fields to 8 from 35, it said today in an annual
strategy briefing. Gas producers, such Royal Dutch Shell Plc and
BP Plc, have cut back on shale gas drilling since last year
after a boom in production made the U.S. the largest producer of
the fuel in the world.  BG forecast that about 45 million tons of LNG can be
exported annually from the U.S. in 2020, or about 10 percent of
the country’s current demand, Chapman said. The company is
working on plans to ship the fuel from Sabine Pass and Lake
Charles terminals in  Louisiana , and from British Columbia in
 Canada .  To contact the reporter on this story:
