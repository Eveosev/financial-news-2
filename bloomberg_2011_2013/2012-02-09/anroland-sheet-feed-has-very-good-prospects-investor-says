insolvency last year.  Langley Holdings Plc., a U.K. maker of welding technologies
and offshore cranes, sees “very good economic prospects for
Manroland sheet-fed following the recent restructuring,” Tony Langley, its owner, was cited as saying in a statement e-mailed

the unit’s production capacity and sales divisions in 40
