Singapore ’s light-distillate
stockpiles rose to the highest in ten weeks, data from the
Ministry of Trade and Industry showed.  Onshore inventories of  light distillates , a category that
includes naphtha, reformate and gasoline, increased 22 percent
to 12.14 million barrels in the week to Feb. 8,  International
Enterprise Singapore , a unit of the ministry, said in an e-
mailed statement today. That’s the highest since Nov. 30.  Stockpiles of  middle distillates  such as gasoil and
kerosene rose 8.4 percent to 9.74 million barrels.  Residues (SPIVRESD) , a
category that includes  fuel oil  and low-sulfur waxy residue and
excludes bitumen, fell 1.2 percent to 19.49 million.  The trade ministry unit surveys refiners,  oil companies  and
storage terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude
some offshore storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
