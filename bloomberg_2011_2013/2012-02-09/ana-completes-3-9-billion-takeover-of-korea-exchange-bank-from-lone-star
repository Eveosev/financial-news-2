Hana Financial Group Inc. (086790)  completed
its 4.4 trillion won ($3.9 billion) purchase of  Korea Exchange
Bank (004940)  from  Lone Star  Funds and Export Import Bank of  Korea ,
allowing Hana to narrow a gap with rivals and the U.S. fund to
exit the investment after eight years.  Hana completed the payment today and officially closed the
deal, which was pending more than a year, Hana President Kim
Jong Yeol told investors and analysts in a telephone conference.
Seoul-based Hana agreed to buy Lone Star’s 51 percent  stake  for
3.9 trillion won and an additional 6.25 percent from Export
Import Bank of Korea for 11,900 won a share. It’s the bank’s
biggest takeover.  Lone Star exits with more than $4 billion in profit since
investing in the South Korean lender in 2003 in the wake of the
1997-98 Asian financial crisis. For Hana Chairman Kim Seung Yu,
the transaction ends more than a year of legal and regulatory
delays and gives his bank operations abroad to compete with  KB
Financial Group Inc. (105560)  and  Woori Finance Holdings Co. (053000)   The fund had already recouped 2.9 trillion won in before-
tax profit on its initial 2.15 trillion won investment via
dividends and a sale of some shares, according to data from
Korea Exchange Bank. Lone Star failed in earlier attempts to
sell the stake due to ownership disputes, stock-trading
investigations and a public backlash over the buyout firm’s
profit.  Shares of Hana  rose 1.7 percent to 41,200 won at the close
of trading in Seoul and Korea Exchange Bank slid 0.4 percent to
8,100 won. The benchmark Kospi index gained 0.5 percent.  Earlier Attempts  South Korea’s  Financial Services Commission  ruled on Jan.
27 that Hana,  South Korea ’s fourth-largest financial group by
assets, has sufficient health and funding to buy Lone Star’s
stake. The sale price has been reduced twice since the deal was
struck in November 2010.  Courts, regulators and lawmakers helped derail Lone Star’s
attempts to sell the  stake  since 2006.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  dropped
a $6 billion bid in September 2008 after authorities left the
proposed transaction in limbo for more than a year because of
legal disputes.  That was the second blow to Lone Star after Kookmin Bank,
now part of KB Financial, walked away from talks to buy 65
percent of Korea Exchange Bank in November 2006, after beating
Hana for the right to negotiate earlier that year.  Board Changes  Hana will name Vice Chairman Yun Yong Ro as chief executive
officer of KEB at a shareholders meeting due in March and will
appoint board members recommended by Hana, President Kim said.
Hana will start a  task force  for smooth integration of KEB while
keeping its operation separate from the existing Hana Bank unit,
he said.  Hana Chairman Kim on Jan. 27 repeated that the company will
keep Korea Exchange Bank independent and won’t merge it with
Hana’s bank unit for a while, saying the addition of KEB will
improve the company’s global reach.  Overseas operations accounted for 3.6 percent of KEB’s 12.2
trillion won revenue in 2010, compared with Hana’s entire
revenue coming from South Korea, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Hana separately said  profit  gained 11 percent to 153.8
billion won in the fourth quarter from a revised 139 billion won
a year earlier. Loan-loss provisions fell 48 percent from a year
earlier to 101.9 billion won, according to a regulatory filing.  To contact the reporters on this story:
