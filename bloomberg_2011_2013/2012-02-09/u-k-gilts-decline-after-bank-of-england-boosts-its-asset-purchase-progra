U.K.  government bonds  fell after the
 Bank of England  said it will expand its asset-purchase program
to 325 billion pounds ($515 billion) and kept its key  interest
rate  at a record low to help revive the U.K. economy.  The decision to raise the target by 50 billion pounds
matched the median estimate of 50 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey. One predicted no change and 15 predicted an increase of
75 billion pounds. The central bank left its benchmark interest
rate at 0.5 percent, as predicted by all 56 respondents in a
separate survey.  “Fifty billion is bang in line with consensus and may
cause a little bit of retracement” in gilts, said  Nick Stamenkovic , a fixed-income strategist at RIA Capital Markets
Ltd. in Edinburgh.  The 10-year gilt yield rose two basis points to 2.21
percent at 12:22 p.m. London time after dropping to 2.15
percent. The 3.75 percent bond due September 2021 fell 0.195, or
1.95 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 113.20.  The yield on the benchmark security climbed four basis
points to 2.39 percent after the central bank’s Monetary Policy
Committee raised the ceiling on bond purchases to 275 billion
pounds on Oct. 6, starting a round of buying that ended on Feb.
2.  Gilts have handed investors a loss of 1.6 percent this
year, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies, while
German government bonds declined 0.8 percent.  The pound strengthened 0.3 percent to 83.57 pence per euro
and also rose 0.3 percent $1.5861.  Sterling has weakened 0.9 percent this year, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-nation currencies. The dollar declined 3.2 percent,
and the euro dropped 0.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
