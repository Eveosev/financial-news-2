The  Portuguese government  said it
approved a diploma that prohibits managers at state-owned
companies from earning a higher salary than the prime minister.  The measure is part of a plan to increase savings in the
public sector and excludes certain companies that are subject to
“free market competition,” Helder Rosalino, secretary of state
for public administration, said at a press conference today
following the weekly cabinet meeting.  These companies include state-owned bank  Caixa Geral de
Depositos SA , airline  TAP SGPS SA (TAP) , postal operator CTT-Correios
de  Portugal  and broadcaster Radio e Televisao de Portugal SA.
The government wants to ensure these companies will maintain
their “capacity to attract” managers, Rosalino said.  Portugal requested a bailout from the European Union and
the  International Monetary Fund  last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
