Repsol YPF SA (REP) â€™s Argentine unit
estimates its shale oil resources at the Vaca Muerta formation
in the south of the country are about 23 billion barrels.  YPF SA (YPFD) 
shares soared.  The new estimate comes after further drilling in the area

the Loma La Lata field, which is located in the formation.  YPF  shares  in  Buenos Aires  rose 8 percent yesterday to
