Yields on Brazilian interest-rate
futures contracts declined to a new low after a report that
showed consumer prices rose less than forecast in  Sao Paulo 
renewed speculation that policy makers will continue to cut
borrowing costs.  The yield on the contract due in January 2013 fell four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point to 9.35 percent at 9:46
a.m. in Sao Paulo. The real weakened 0.3 percent to 1.7250 per
 U.S. dollar , from 1.7206 yesterday.  Consumer prices in Brazil’s largest city, as measured by
the Foundation Economics Research Institute, rose 0.42 percent
in the past month, compared with a 0.68 percent increase in the
earlier period. The median estimate of 19 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was for a 0.57 percent rise.  “The FIPE index is the second to come below estimates,”
this week, Otavio de Souza Leal, chief economist at Banco ABC
Brasil SA, said by phone from Sao Paulo.  Consumer prices in  Brazil , as measured by the IPC-S index,
rose 0.46 percent in the 30 days through Feb. 7, after climbing
0.81 percent in the previous period, the Getulio Vargas
Foundation said yesterday. The increase was less than the 0.65
percent median estimate of 21 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
