Spanish state-owned television and
radio station RTVE cut the salaries for executives and star
guests by 25% as it tries to reduce its budget by 200 million
euros ($265.7 million),  El Economista  reported, citing
unidentified people on the company’s board.  The cuts, which also include eliminating official cars,
amount to 5 million euros, the newspaper said. Most of the
remaining adjustments will come from the programming side, while
the company is also in talks with the government to postpone
part of the budget reduction to 2013, El Economista said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
