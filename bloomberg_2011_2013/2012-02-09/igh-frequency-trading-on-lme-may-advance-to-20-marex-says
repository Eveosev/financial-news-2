High-frequency trading in metals may
rise to as much as 20 percent of the volume on the  London  Metal
Exchange in a couple years, Marex Spectron Group said.  High-frequency trading accounts for less than 5 percent of
the volume on the LME and higher volumes on the Comex in  New
York , John Lowrey, global head of electronic trading and direct
market access services, said today in an interview in London.  “It’s a very small market, but it will grow,” Lowrey
said. High-frequency trading, which uses algorithms to analyze
markets and execute orders based on market conditions, accounts
for 60 percent of trades in the stock market, he said. Newedge
Group and Marex are the biggest providers of services to high-
frequency traders, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
