Global food prices  rose 1.9 percent
in January, the biggest gain in 11 months as the cost of
oilseeds, dairy and grains increased, the United Nations Food
and Agriculture Organization said.  An index of 55 food items climbed to 214.3 points from a
restated 210.3 points in December, the Rome-based FAO said on
its website today. All commodity groups in the index advanced,
according to the UN agency.  Costlier food is driving up living costs in  China , home to
about a fifth of the world population. Chinese inflation
unexpectedly accelerated in January on the back of food prices,
which rose 10.5 percent last month compared with a year earlier,
up from 9.1 percent in December, the country’s National Bureau
of Statistics reported today.  “International prices of all major cereals with the
exception of rice rose in January,” the FAO wrote. “Prices of
all the commodity groups that compose the index registered
gains, with oils increasing the most.”  Spot prices for U.S. soybeans at ports near  New Orleans 
rose 1.2 percent last month following a 5.2 percent jump in
December on concern dry and hot weather in  Argentina  and
southern Brazil will reduce harvests there. U.S. Gulf corn spot
prices rose 1.8 percent last month after advancing 4.5 percent
in December.  The FAO’s cereal-price index climbed 2.3 percent to 222.7
points from 217.6 points a month earlier, the biggest gain for
the gauge since April. Corn led the gains on concern about South
American crop prospects, the UN agency wrote.  Edible Oils and Fats  The index of edible oils and fats rose 2.8 percent to 233.7
points, compared with 227.5 points in December. The sugar-price
index tracked by the FAO climbed 2.3 percent to 334.3 points on
“less than favorable” weather in  Brazil , the biggest producer
of the sweetener, the agency said.  The meat index rose less than 1 percent to 178.5 points
from 177.6, as rising pigmeat prices more than made up for a
decline in poultry costs. The dairy price gauge gained 2.5
percent to 206.8 points from 201.7 in December.  “Butter and cheese prices are behind this month’s
strength, as prices of both skim and whole milk powder were
steady or slightly down” the FAO wrote. “Relatively low stocks
of dairy products in the U.S. along with supply tightness in
Oceania have sustained prices in the past two months.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
