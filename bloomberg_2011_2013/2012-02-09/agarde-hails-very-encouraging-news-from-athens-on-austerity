Christine Lagarde , a former French
finance minister who’s now the International Monetary Fund’s
managing director, hailed the “very encouraging news” from
 Athens  on an austerity agreement.  “There are clearly some very encouraging news coming out
of Athens” following “very heavy-duty work that’s been done
lately,” Lagarde told reporters in Brussels today before a
meeting of euro-area finance chiefs. “It’s positive.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
