News Corp.’s Fox Broadcasting said
“House M.D.” will end after its eighth season, giving the
medical drama a total of 177 episodes.  The program, produced by  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s Universal
Television studio, will finish in April, Los Angeles-based Fox
said in an e-mailed statement.  “House,” about a cranky and unconventional doctor played
by Hugh Laurie, has been a consistent ratings draw for Fox,
regularly finishing among the top 25 most-watched U.S. broadcast
programs. Reruns will continue on cable channels, producers
David Shore, Katie Jacobs and Laurie said in the statement.  “While it’s with much regret, and a lump in our throats,
we respect the decision Hugh, David and Katie have made,”  Kevin Reilly , Fox’s entertainment president, said in the statement.
“They have been creatively tenacious and collaborative
throughout this incredible run, and they are amongst the most
superior talents in the business.”  News Corp. (NWSA) , also the owner of the Twentieth Century Fox
film studio, climbed 0.6 percent to $19.62 today at the New York
close. The  stock  has gained 10 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
