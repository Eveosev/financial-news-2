The European Union pushed  Hungary  to
give “positive signals” that the government is moving to
address concerns that the nation’s media law undermines
pluralism in the industry.  “The Hungarian government needs to do more and act quickly
to reassure” the EU,  Neelie Kroes , the 27-nation bloc’s
commissioner for digital affairs, told a European Parliament
committee today in Brussels. “I continue to have grave concerns
about the current situation,” she said, adding that Hungary
must “show that it is serious about protecting freedom of
expression and media pluralism.”  The media law, which created a regulator led by ruling-
party appointees, fails to meet press-freedom commitments even
after changes demanded by the EU last year, according to the
Vienna-based Organization for Security and Cooperation in
 Europe .  “Private investors and international institutions need to
know they have full access to independent media analysis,”
Kroes said. “While there is legally member-state discretion in
this area, I am worried when that discretion is exercised to the
detriment of media pluralism.”  Hungarian Deputy Prime Minister Tibor Navracsics, who met
with Kroes in Brussels before appearing at the same
parliamentary panel, said his nation “wants to engage in
cooperation” with the EU over the issue. “The Hungarian
government has every interest in its legislation and
constitution being in line with” EU norms, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
