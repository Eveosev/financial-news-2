The following companies are having
unusual price changes in  Mexico  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 1:17 p.m. local time.  The IPC  index  rose 0.2 percent to 38,226.58.  Stocks advanced after applications for jobless benefits in
the U.S. last week unexpectedly dropped, adding to evidence the
labor market is recovering in the country that buys 80 percent
of Mexico’s exports.  Desarrolladora Homex SAB (HOMEX*)  , Mexico’s largest
homebuilder, gained 2.9 percent to 46.76 pesos.  Corp. Geo SAB (GEOB) 
, the second largest, rose 1.9 percent to 22.27 pesos.  Axtel SAB (AXTELCPO)  , Mexico’s second-largest land-line
phone company, climbed 4.6 percent to 4.77 pesos, the biggest
gain on a closing basis since Dec. 16.  Food producers and retailers fell after a government report
showed annual inflation quickened more than economists forecast
last month. Consumer prices rose 0.71 percent in January, led by
a surge in agricultural and livestock costs, pushing the annual
rate to 4.05 percent from 3.82 percent in December.  Organizacion Soriana SAB (SORIANAB)  , Mexico’s second-
biggest grocery store chain, dropped 1.1 percent to 33.58 pesos.
 Grupo Bimbo SAB (BIMBOA)  , the world’s largest bread maker,
fell 0.3 percent to 28.29 pesos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
