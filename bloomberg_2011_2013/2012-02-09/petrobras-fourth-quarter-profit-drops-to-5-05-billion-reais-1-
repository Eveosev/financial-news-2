Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , the state-
controlled oil producer, said fourth-quarter profit more than
halved because of costs to install equipment and pay workers.  Net income  dropped to 5.05 billion reais ($2.9 billion),
or 39 centavos a share, from 10.6 billion reais, or 1.07 reais,
a year earlier, the Rio de Janeiro-based company said today in a
regulatory filing. The company had been expected to earn  69
centavos a share  excluding some items, the average of six
analyst estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Costs rose because of the installation of new production
equipment in the so-called pre-salt region, an increase in
platform maintenance and stoppages, and higher salaries,
Petrobras said. It cost the company $12.49 to produce each
barrel of oil, or the so-called lifting cost, up from $10.29 in
the fourth quarter of 2010, it said. Gasoline imports last year
also quadrupled to about 30,000 barrels a day.  “There was a large increase in costs, imported fuel was a
little bit more expensive and there was more exploration,”
Rafael Andreata, an analyst at Planner Corretora de Valores, who
has a “buy” rating on the stock and doesn’t own any, said in a
telephone interview from  Sao Paulo  before results were released.  Petrobras rose 7 centavos to 25.50 reais in Sao Paulo. The
stock has gained 19 percent this year, compared with a 16
percent gain for  Brazil ’s benchmark Bovespa Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
