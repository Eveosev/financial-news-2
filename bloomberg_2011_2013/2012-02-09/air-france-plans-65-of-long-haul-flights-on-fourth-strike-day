Air France (AF)  said it expects to provide
65 percent of its long-haul services and 75 percent of domestic
and European flights as pilots and other workers stage a fourth
day of walkouts to protest a proposed labor-law change.  The strike, which began Feb. 6, is scheduled to end today.
Air France Chief Executive Alexandre de Juniac yesterday
estimated the walkout would cost the Paris-based airline about
10 million euros ($13.3 billion) per day.  Union pilots, cabin crew and ground workers are protesting
a bill to be considered by the French Senate that would require
each employee to give companies 48 hours’ notice before
striking. The four-day walkout comes less than three months
after de Juniac became Air France  chief executive , succeeding
Pierre-Henri Gourgeon, who left amid financial losses.  The parent company, Air France-KLM Group, will post a loss
of “several hundred million euros” for 2011 after fuel costs
increased, de Juniac told French legislators Jan. 25.  Air France operated 65 percent of its scheduled long-haul
flights yesterday and 75 percent of short- and medium-haul
services. Customers scheduled to travel during the walkout dates
will be allowed to modify or postpone their journeys. Air France
said it sent 170,000 e-mails and SMS telephone-text messages to
warn passengers of flight changes as of yesterday evening.  To contact the reporter on this story:
