Telefonica SA is seeking to extend
the maturities of debt used by  Spain ’s largest phone company to
fund the acquisition of O2 Plc in 2005, according to three
people with knowledge of the situation.  The company is asking lenders to extend 2.1 billion pounds
($3.3 billion) of term loans from the end of this year to 2015.
It also wants to extend a a revolving credit from the end of
2013 to 2017, said the people, who declined to be identified
because the deal is private.  Telefonica, which is self-arranging the financing, is also
adding a new five-year credit line, said the people.  It is offering to pay an initial interest of 215 basis
points more than benchmark lending rate for the so-called
forward-start deals and an interest margin of 180 basis points
for the new revolving credit, said the people. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point.  The company proposes to pay a utilization fee of 15 basis
points to start drawing the credit line. The fee will rise to 25
basis points if it uses more than one-third, and 50 basis points
to use more than two-thirds, the people said.  Miguel Angel Garzon, a Madrid-based spokesman at
Telefonica, declined to comment.  Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings rank Telefonica at
BBB+. Moody’s Investors Service rates it Baa1.  To contact the reporters on this story:
