European Union plans to writedown
bondholders at failing banks will “most probably” be presented
“before summer,” the chief adviser to EU Financial Services
Commissioner  Michel Barnier  said.  The measures will be published when “ministers can give
them their full attention and markets are not jumpy,” the
adviser, Olivier Guersent, said today at a conference in
Brussels. The European debt crisis is “still in the middle of
the radar screen,” he said.  Regulators have called for legal powers to impose losses on
bank creditors as part of a set of measures to prevent lenders
being too-big-to-fail. The Financial Stability Board last year
called for so-called bail-in rules to be put in place for all
international banks.  “We are waiting for the most propitious moment in economic
and political terms,” Guersent said. All regions should adopt
regulations to wind down failing lenders, he said, adding that
such rules are “more needed” in the EU “than elsewhere.”  Guersent also said that the membership list and remit of a
high-level group on bank structure will be published by “early
next week.”  The group, which will examine measures to separate retail
and investment banking, will publish its views by the end of
this year, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
