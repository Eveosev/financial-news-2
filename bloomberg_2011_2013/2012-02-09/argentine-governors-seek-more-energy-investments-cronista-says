Argentine governors will ask  oil
companies  in their provinces to partner with state-run producers
as a way to increase investment, El Cronista Comercial said,
citing a draft of an agreement.  The governors of oil producing provinces including Chubut,
Mendoza and Neuquen will meet today in  Buenos Aires  with Economy
Minister Hernan Lorenzino, Planning Minister Julio de Vido and
other officials, the Buenos Aires-based newspaper reported.  The governors may also agree on a provision that would
strip energy companies’ licenses if they don’t guarantee oil and
gas production at levels previously agreed to, the article said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
