Switzerland ’s  consumer confidence 
increased for the first time in a year, adding to signs the
economy is stabilizing.  An  index  based on a quarterly survey of about 1,100
households increased to minus 19 from minus 24 in October, the
 State Secretariat for Economic Affairs  in Bern said in an e-
mailed  statement  today. That’s the first increase since January
2011 and higher than the expected gain to minus 22, the median
forecast of 11 economists in a  Bloomberg News survey .  Swiss consumers may become more confident as the economy
shows signs of regaining some strength. The government expects
economic growth to accelerate to 1.9 percent next year after a
0.5 percent expansion in 2012 and  Swiss central bank  interim
Chairman Thomas Jordan said on Feb. 7 that “some recently
released indicators point to a slight stabilization.”  A sub-indicator of economic prospects rose to minus 29 from
minus 38 in October, according to the statement. A measure of
expected unemployment decreased to 71 from 73 and a gauge of
expected savings increased to 22 from 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
