U.K. Minister of State for Energy and
Climate Change Greg Barker said he’s seeking 22 gigawatts of
solar photovoltaic power installations in Britain by 2020.  The minister, who’s due today to announce proposals for
reforms of the feed-in tariff incentive that supports solar
power in Britain, included the goal in a post on his Twitter
feed. “My new solar ambition a reformed FiT to deliver 22 GW of
PV by 2020,” Barker wrote. “Yes, 22GW.”  Barker twice cut rates in 2011 to prevent solar power from
eating up the entire budget for feed-in tariffs, guaranteed
prices for electricity that incentivize small-scale power
generation from the sun, wind, water and biomass. Those cuts
prompted a legal challenge from the industry, which said he was
killing off a growing business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
