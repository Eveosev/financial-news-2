Asia ’s naphtha crack spread widened,
signaling rising profit for refiners making the petrochemical
feedstock. Royal Dutch Shell Plc sold gasoil for a second day in
 Singapore .  Light Distillates  Japan naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude
futures rose to $114.10 a metric ton at 3 p.m. Singapore time
from $109.01 yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Shell sold 25,000 tons of open-specification  naphtha  for
first-half April delivery to Cargill Inc. at $1,021 a ton,
according to a Bloomberg News survey of traders who monitored
transactions on the Platts window.  Gunvor Group Ltd. sold 50,000 barrels of 92-RON gasoline to
BP Plc at $128 a barrel and purchased 50,000 barrels of 95-RON
from Total SA at $130 a barrel, the survey showed.  Middle Distillates  Shell sold 150,000 barrels of  gasoil , or diesel, with 0.5
percent sulfur to Brightoil Petroleum Holdings Ltd., according
to the Bloomberg survey. It received 25 cents a barrel more than
February quotes. Hin Leong Trading Pte bought a similar cargo
from BP Plc at the same price. Both shipments are for loading
from Feb. 24 to Feb. 28.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian marker Dubai crude fell 62 cents
to $18.13 a barrel at 2:32 p.m. Singapore time, based on data
from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. This  crack spread , a
measure of refining profit, is the narrowest so far this week.  Jet fuel  was unchanged at 65 cents a barrel below gasoil,
PVM data showed. This  regrade  has been negative since Jan. 16,
indicating it is unprofitable to produce  aviation fuel  over
diesel.  Fuel Oil  Fuel oil  dropped 10 cents to $3.42 a barrel below Dubai
crude at 2:32 p.m. Singapore time, according to PVM. A bigger
 discount  signals widening losses for refiners turning oil into
residual products.  The premium of  180-centistoke  fuel oil to  380-centistoke 
grade, or the  viscosity spread , was unchanged after climbing to
$9.75 a ton, PVM said. This means bunker, or marine fuel, moved
in tandem with higher-quality fuel oil.  Tenders  Vitol Group was said to pay the highest premiums in nine
months to Indian refiners for naphtha cargoes, amid increased
demand for the fuel and reduced supplies to Asia from  Europe ,
according to people familiar with the transactions. The Geneva-
based trader paid $37 a ton above Middle East prices to Bharat
Petroleum Corp. for a March-loading cargo.  Bharat Petroleum,  India ’s second-largest state-run refiner,
issued a tender to sell six naphtha cargoes totaling 210,000
tons for loading from April to June, according to a tender
document.  Vietnam National Petroleum Corp. is seeking to buy 30,000
tons of gasoline for March loading, the company said in a
document e-mailed to potential suppliers.  Saigon Petroleum Co. is seeking to buy 20,000 tons of
gasoline and gasoil for February and March loading, the Ho Chi
Minh City-based company said in a document.  To contact the reporters on this story:
