Dassault Systemes SA (DSY) , a maker of
design software for manufacturers such as  Benetton Group SpA (BEN)  and
 Daimler AG (DAI) , fell the most in almost six months in Paris trading
after saying Europe’s debt crisis will limit sales growth.  Scarcer credit and government budget cuts may lead
companies to hold back on spending in 2012, Chief Financial
Officer Thibault de Tersant said today on a conference call.
Demand has yet to show signs of slowing, though “when customers
decide to react to the environment, they may do it quickly.”  The  World Bank  cut its global economic-growth forecast in
January, saying that a recession in the countries that share the
euro threatens to exacerbate a slowdown in  emerging markets . De
Tersant said he will “remain careful about this economic
environment” because of possible effects on customers.  Dassault Systemes  dropped  as much as 5.2 percent to 61.26
euros, the biggest intraday decline since Aug. 18, and was
trading down 4.1 percent at 12:21 p.m. The stock was the second-
worst performer on the  SBF 120 Index  of French shares, which
gained 0.4 percent today.  The company, based in the Paris suburb of Velizy
Villacoublay, said today that sales growth in 2012 may slow to
within a range of 5 percent to 7 percent, compared with a 14
percent jump in revenue to 1.78 billion euros ($2.4 billion)
last year on a non-international financial reporting standards
basis. Operating margins will remain “stable” at about 30.4
percent of sales.  “Consensus was expecting a better outlook, even though
Dassault Systemes has taken rather prudent assumptions when
giving their guidance in the past,” said Susan Anthony, an
analyst at Mirabaud Securities in London, who said she’s
reviewing her “add”  recommendation  on the stock.  Dassault Systemes is trading at a premium to its  peers ,
with a price of 19.4 times its 2012 estimated earnings according
to data compiled by Bloomberg, compared to software makers  SAP
AG (SAP)  at 15.1 times and  Sage Group Plc (SGE)  at 14.2 times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
