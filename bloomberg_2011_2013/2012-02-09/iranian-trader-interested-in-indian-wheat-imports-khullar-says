An Iranian trader is in talks to
import “a very large quantity” of Indian  wheat , the South
Asian nation’s Trade Secretary Rahul Khullar said today.  “It is true that there is one private sector trader who is
interested in importing a very large quantity of wheat,”
Khullar told reporters in  New Delhi . “It is not a government-
to-government transaction. The guy has to come here and find
someone who sells wheat.”  The foreign ministry has proposed paying for Iranian crude
imports with wheat exports to the Persian Gulf nation, the
Economic Times reported today, citing an unidentified person
with knowledge of the development.  Iran and India are seeking a solution for payment for
bilateral trade amid escalating economic and financial sanctions
against the Islamic Republic. The U.S. and its allies are using
economic and financial sanctions to curb  Iran’s nuclear program ,
which they say has military objectives. Iran denies the claim.  To contact the reporter on this story:
