Mining officials from  Democratic
Republic  of Congo were attacked at a conference in  Cape Town  by
men protesting against the country’s election results, said Bene
M’Poko, the country’s ambassador to  South Africa .  At least five people, including an official from  Freeport
McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc.’s  Congo unit, were attacked by a
group of protestors at the Investing in African Mining Indaba
conference this week, M’Poko said in an interview at the
gathering yesterday.  “Two people were taken to an empty building and beaten,”
M’Poko said. “They are attacking anyone attached to the
government, anyone in the elite. They’re acting, basically, like
terrorists, like al-Qaeda.”  President  Joseph Kabila  in November won a second five-year
term in elections in the central African nation, which boasts
the world’s largest cobalt reserves. The vote was marred by
irregularities including lost ballots, contested results and
violence, according to electoral observation missions from the
U.S.-based  Carter Center , the European Union and Congo’s
Catholic Church.  About 30 protestors waved placards and chanted outside Cape
Town’s convention center yesterday, urging investors to stay
away from Congo, where they alleged Kabila was illegally
elected.  Anti-government demonstrators in December attacked the
Congolese embassy in the South African capital,  Pretoria ,
smashed M’Poko’s car, and still make death threats against him
“every day,” he said in the interview, just after making a
public announcement to Congolese executives warning them of the
threat.  To contact the reporter on this story:
