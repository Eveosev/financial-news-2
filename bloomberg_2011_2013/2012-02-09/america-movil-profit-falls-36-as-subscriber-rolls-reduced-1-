America Movil SAB (AMXL) , the biggest
mobile-phone carrier in the Americas, reported fourth-quarter
profit that missed analysts’ estimates as costs rose to recruit
new subscribers and service debt.  Profit excluding interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization rose 3.9 percent to 64.5 billion pesos ($5.1
billion), missing the 65.2 billion average estimate of six
analysts polled by Bloomberg. The Mexico City-based carrier’s
Mexican and Brazilian units had lower profit margins as more
customers signed up for long-term contracts that often come with
discounted phones.  America Movil , controlled by billionaire  Carlos Slim , is
shifting its prepaid phone users to contract plans to increase
customers’ loyalty and encourage them to add more services, such
as  Internet access . Contract subscribers rose 20.5 percent in
2011, compared to 7.4 percent growth for all wireless users.  “Contract clients are more expensive, but they’re much
more stable and productive,” said Martin Lara, an analyst at
Corp. Actinver SAB in  Mexico  City. “There are many incentives
to add postpaid clients.” He recommends buying the shares.  Fourth-quarter net income slid to 16.3 billion pesos ($1.3
billion) from 25.5 billion pesos a year earlier, America Movil
said yesterday in a statement. A weaker peso and higher interest
expenses boosted financing costs fourfold to 11.1 billion pesos,
hurting profit. Sales rose 12 percent to 182 billion pesos,
beating the 173 billion-peso average of  analyst estimates .  Interest Expense  America Movil is paying more interest after borrowing to
acquire fixed-line companies Telmex Internacional SAB and
Telefonos de Mexico SAB in the past two years. Net debt rose 55
percent to 321 billion pesos from a year earlier.  Cash flow 
should pay down that figure over time, Lara said.  The company changed its accounting for prepaid wireless
subscribers to eliminate those who hadn’t added minutes to their
account during “a determined period,” according to the filing.
That eliminated 4.85 million clients from the company’s rolls.  Even with that elimination, America Movil had a net gain of
304,000 mobile subscribers, suggesting that excluding the purged
clients, it added about 5.2 million during the quarter. That
compared with the 5.83 million estimate of James Rivett, an
analyst at Citigroup Inc. in  New York  and with Lara’s 6.25
million estimate. America Movil ended the quarter with 242
million mobile-phone customers.  Profit margins in Mexico, before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization, fell to 48 percent from 51.3
percent a year earlier. Profit was hurt by a ruling last year by
Mexico’s Federal Telecommunications Commission to cut the fees
that America Movil could charge competitors to connect calls.  In  Brazil , America Movil’s second-largest market behind
Mexico, the operating margin fell to 22.8 percent from 24.7
percent. Brazil had the biggest net gain in the quarter among
the 18 countries where America Movil operates, adding 2.9
million new subscribers.  The company’s  shares  rose 0.1 percent to 15.56 pesos
yesterday in Mexico City before the results were announced. They
have dropped 1.6 percent this year.  (America Movil plans to hold a conference call at 10 a.m.
