A strike by  Israel ’s largest labor
federation forced banks, ports and the  stock exchange  to close
for a second day as talks to end the stalemate were extended.  The  Finance Ministry  and the Histadrut labor union are
still negotiating over the status of contract workers and may be
on the verge of an agreement that will end the strike, Israel
Radio reported. The National Labor Court allowed the parties to
keep talking beyond a 1 a.m. deadline set yesterday, and has yet
to intervene in the labor action.  Histadrut estimates that 250,000 Israelis employed through
contractors receive on average about 30 percent less pay than
comparable workers employed directly. It says it wants the
government to take stronger measures to have them hired directly
so they receive higher wages and benefits.  Ben-Gurion International Airport will again be shut for the
first six hours of the strike starting at 6 a.m., which involves
500,000 workers and started yesterday. The  Tel Aviv Stock
Exchange (EPRX)  and the  Bank of Israel  will also be closed again if an
agreement isn’t reached this morning, and the court allows the
strike to continue.  Histadrut said yesterday it reached an accord with private-
industry groups to ensure that contract workers will get
equivalent conditions to salaried employees. An end to the
strike will depend on the government accepting those terms, it
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
