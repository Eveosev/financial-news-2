Bertelsmann AG (BTG) ,  Europe ’s biggest
media company, said operating profit fell about 5.6 percent last
year, hurt by “weak business performance” of operations such
as printing.  Operating earnings before interest and taxes declined to
1.7 billion euros ($2.3 billion) from 1.8 billion euros in the
previous year, the Guetersloh, Germany-based company said in an
e-mailed statement today. Sales from continuing operations rose
to 15.3 billion euros from 15.1 billion euros.  Chief Executive Officer Thomas Rabe, who took office Jan.
1, aims to grow Bertelsmann in emerging markets such as India
and  China  as well as add to sales in digital publishing and e-
commerce. Gerhard Zeiler, the CEO of Bertelsmann’s biggest and
most profitable unit RTL Group SA, will leave for Time Warner
Inc. in April and be replaced by Anke Schaeferkordt and
Guillaume de Posch as new co-CEOs, the unit said this week.  Profit was also affected by the cost in new growth areas as
well as by lower earnings from the replication and direct-
marketing business,  Bertelsmann  said today. The company didn’t
give any forecasts for the current year.  All prior-year figures were adjusted for the discontinued
club and bookselling businesses of the former Direct Group. The
company said it will publish more detailed financial figures on
March 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
