Greece  must accept that it needs to
cut public and private wages to avoid defaulting on its bonds,
Slovak Finance Minister Ivan Miklos said.  Greece “must deliver” by passing concrete laws in
parliament in order to win a second aid package from
international lenders, Miklos told reporters. The measures must
ensure that the country will be able to reduce its state debt to
about 120 percent of gross domestic product by 2020, he said.  “We are not satisfied with pledges anymore, we need to see
bills being approved,” Miklos said today in Bratislava,
Slovakia. “Two of the biggest issues are currently a wage cut
and additional measures to cut the deficit by 1 percentage point
of GDP.”  Euro-region finance ministers are scheduled to meet later
today to discuss the Greek crisis as politicians in  Athens  still
haven’t agreed on meeting all lenders’ demands. Miklos today
ruled out beefing up the package above the already agreed 130
billion euros ($172 billion).  Miklos also said he favors the  European Central Bank  not
being involved in the Greek debt write down, preferring bigger
private sector involvement instead.  To contact the reporter on this story:
