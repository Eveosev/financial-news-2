Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said his country must decide if it will remain in the
euro or not, and the decision must be made before a meeting of
euro-area finance chiefs on Feb. 15.  “This is a time of difficult decisions,” Venizelos told
reporters in Brussels late yesterday after euro-area finance
ministers met to discuss a second rescue for  Greece . “No one
can hide behind another.”  Greek parliamentary support for the program and written
commitments from the country’s main political parties backing
the government in support of the austerity program will be key,
he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
