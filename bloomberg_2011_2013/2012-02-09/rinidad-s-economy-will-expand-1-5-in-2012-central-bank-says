Trinidad and Tobago ’s economy will
expand “modestly” this year as oil and gas production on the
Caribbean islands recover, the central bank said.  The bank projects economic growth of 1.5 percent in 2012 and
annual inflation of 5 percent. Oil and gas production should
return to 2010 levels after plants complete upgrades, the bank
said in a report posted on its website yesterday.  “The energy services sector is expected to rebound due
mainly to increased exploration activities,” the bank said in
the report.  The national economy probably shrank 1.4 percent in 2011
due to a “a drastic fall off” in energy production as a result
of aging oil fields, unplanned plant shutdowns and maintenance
activity, the report said.  Trinidad & Tobago  Energy Minister Kevin Ramnarine, speaking
Feb. 6 at The Trinidad & Tobago Energy Conference in Port of
 Spain , said oil output in 2011 averaged 92,000 barrels per day,
though that exploration drilling will “spring to life” in 2012
after four years of decreased productivity, according to a
transcript of his remarks.  Ramnarine said 15 exploration wells will be drilled in the
country in 2012 and that capital expenditure in the energy
sector is expected to total as much as $3 billion.  Later this month, Ramnarine also said the ministry plans a
road show at month-end to Houston to meet representatives of 200
oil and gas companies that have expressed “interest in
investing or in partnering with Trinidad and Tobago.”  The energy sector is the largest source of revenue for
Trinidad & Tobago, according to the central bank.  To contact the reporters on this story:
