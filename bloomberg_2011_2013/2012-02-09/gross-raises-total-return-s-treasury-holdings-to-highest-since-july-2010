 Bill Gross , a year after banishing  U.S. government debt  from the
world’s biggest bond fund, increased his holdings of Treasuries
to the highest level since July 2010.  Gross boosted the proportion of U.S. government and
Treasury debt in Pimco’s $250.5 billion Total Return Fund in
January to 38 percent from 30 percent in December, according to
a report placed on the company’s  website . He raised mortgages to
50 percent, the highest since June 2009, from 48 percent in
December.  Newport Beach , California-based Pimco doesn’t comment
directly on monthly changes in its portfolio holdings.  Treasuries with maturities from five to seven years have
been the focus of purchases with longer-term debt unattractive
due to risk of a pick-up in inflation, Gross said in an
interview Feb. 3 on “Bloomberg Surveillance” with  Tom Keene 
and Ken Prewitt. The  Fund (PTTRX)  increased its allocation of Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, or TIPS, to 8 percent, Gross
said that day.  The fund last year gained 4.2 percent, lagging behind 70
percent of its peers, after Gross missed a rally in U.S.
Treasuries and put money into riskier assets, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Gross’s fund recovered and has returned 7.35 percent in the
past year, beating 49 percent of its peers, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It gained 2.13 percent during the past
month, beating 97 percent of peers.  Emerging Markets  Meanwhile, Treasuries have lost 0.37 percent in 2012 as of
Feb. 8, versus a gain of 9.8 percent last year, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  Pimco reduced holdings of emerging-market debt to nine
percent, from 10 percent and cut the bonds of non-U.S. developed
nations to 11 percent last month, the lowest since May, from 18
percent last month.  Gross reduced the Total Return Fund’s net cash-and-
equivalent position to negative 35 percent in January, from
negative 32 percent the previous month. It can have a so-called
negative position by using derivatives, futures or by shorting.  Pimco’s Government and Treasury debt category includes fund
holdings of U.S. Treasury notes, bonds, futures and inflation-
protected securities.  Pimco, a unit of the Munich-based insurer  Allianz SE ,
managed $1.36 trillion of assets as of Dec. 31.  To contact the reporters on this story:
