Jordan’s former intelligence chief
Lt. General Mohammad Dahabi was arrested as part of an
investigation into  money laundering , embezzlement and abuse of
power, the state-run Petra  news agency  reported.  Dahabi, who headed the kingdom’s intelligence service from
2005 to 2008, is at the Al Juwaida Rehabilitation and Correction
Center in the capital, Amman, the news agency reported. He will
be held for two weeks, the agency said.  Abdel Rahman Tawfiq, head of Dahabi’s defense team, called
the accusations against his client “exaggerated.” Dahabi said
he was innocent as he was being arrested, Tawfiq said in a
telephone interview in Amman. The defense team will ask on Feb.
12 for Dahabi’s release on bail, he said.  Jordan’s opposition, made up largely of Islamist groups,
has staged protests demanding an end to corruption and more
democracy.  King Abdullah  changed the government twice last year
and has promised stronger measures against corruption.  To contact the reporter on this story:
