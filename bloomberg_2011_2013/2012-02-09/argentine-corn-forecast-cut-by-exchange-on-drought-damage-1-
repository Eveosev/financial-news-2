Argentina ’s corn harvest forecast was
lowered to 21.3 million tons from 22 million as drought
conditions damaged crops planted last year, the  Buenos Aires
Cereals Exchange  said.  The exchange reduced its forecast as planting of this
year’s crop reached 99 percent completion, it said in a weekly
report e-mailed today. Heavy rain this week boosts prospects for
recently planted crops, the exchange said.  Farmers in the Pampas will continue to receive moderate
rain through Feb. 16 after storms replenished soil humidity in
most rural areas, the exchange said in a separately issued
weather report today.  The exchange also reiterated a soybean harvest forecast of
46.2 million metric tons.  A drought in Argentina and neighboring Brazil means global
stockpiles of the grain and oilseed will be smaller than
estimated before the next Northern Hemisphere harvests, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said in a report today. Argentina will
harvest 22 million tons of corn, down from 26 million estimated
in January, the USDA said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
