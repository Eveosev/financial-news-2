Huading Financing & Guarantee Co., a
guarantee company based in the southern Chinese province of
Guangdong, is having difficulty getting funds, China Business
News  reported , citing an unidentified company official.  Banks have restricted lending to guarantee companies,
causing Huading’s problems, the Shanghai-based newspaper
reported. The company has  loans  with eight to nine banks
including Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., China
Development Bank Corp., and Agricultural Bank of China Ltd.,
according to the report. The company has 760 million yuan in
registered capital and about 100 million yuan to 200 million
yuan of liquid capital, according to the newspaper.  A person who answered the telephone at Huading Financing &
Guarantee’s offices in the city of Guangzhou said she couldn’t
immediately comment.  Guarantee companies, which insure the debts of other
enterprises, had backed about 689.4 billion yuan of loans at the
end of 2010, an increase of almost 70 percent from 2009, Zhu
Yongyang, deputy director of the financial guarantee department
at the China Banking Regulatory Commission, wrote in the Sept. 7
issue of China Finance. The magazine is published by the
nation’s central bank.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
