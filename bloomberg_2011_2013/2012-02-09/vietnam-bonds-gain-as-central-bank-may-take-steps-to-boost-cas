Vietnam ’s bonds rose on speculation
policy makers will take steps to improve the supply of cash in
the banking system, boosting demand for government securities.
The dong strengthened.  Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung instructed the central bank
to “solve” liquidity problems in the banking system in the
first quarter, according to the government’s website. Dung also
asked the State Bank of Vietnam to closely monitor the market in
order to reduce lending interest rates at a “suitable” time,
according to the statement.  “When liquidity in the money market improves, better fund
flows will support the  bond market ,” said Tran Kieu Hung, a
Hanoi-based bond trader at Bank for Investment & Development of
Vietnam. “Investors will also have to buy bonds to make up for
a large amount of securities maturing soon.”  The  yield  on the government’s five-year bonds slid two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 12.36 percent,
according to daily fixings from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong rose for a third day, gaining 0.1 percent to
20,910 per dollar as of 3:10 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The central bank set the daily  reference
rate  at 20,828, unchanged since Dec. 26, its website showed. The
currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of
the rate.  In the so-called black market, the dong traded between
20,870 and 20,900 per dollar at gold shops in Hanoi today,
compared with between 20,940 and 20,980 yesterday, according to
a telephone information service run by state-owned Vietnam Posts
& Telecommunications.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
