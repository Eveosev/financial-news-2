Matt Huang, a rates strategist at
Macquarie Bank Ltd. in  Singapore , comments on  China’s economy 
after data showed the nation’s inflation rebounded unexpectedly
in January.  Consumer prices rose 4.5 percent in January from a year
earlier after increasing 4.1 percent in December, the National
Bureau of Statistics said on its website today. That compares
with the median 4 percent estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  “You should be careful about  China ’s inflation rate this
time because of seasonality: the Lunar New Year holiday came up
in January compared with February last year. It isn’t
necessarily pointing to a new trend.  “The rise in inflation has a lot to do with the holiday.
You’re going to see a better reading next month and we better
wait to see whether the trend is increasing or not.  To contact the reporter on this story:
