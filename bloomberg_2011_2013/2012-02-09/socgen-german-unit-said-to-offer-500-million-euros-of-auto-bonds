A German unit of  Societe Generale (GLE)  SA
is selling 500 million euros of bonds backed by auto loans,
according to three investors with knowledge of the matter.  The bonds will have an average life of about 1 1/2 years
and may be priced at 95 to 100 basis points more than one-month
Euribor, the investors said.  The securities are backed by repayments on about 72,000
German auto loans originated by Bank Deutsches
Kraftfahrzeuggewerbe AG, the investors said. The asset-backed
securities will be issued through the Red & Black Auto Germany 1
vehicle.  To contact the reporter on this story:
