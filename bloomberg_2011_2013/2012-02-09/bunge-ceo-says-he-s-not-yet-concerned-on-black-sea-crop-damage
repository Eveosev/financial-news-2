Bunge Ltd. (BG)  Chief Executive Officer
 Alberto Weisser  said he’s “not yet concerned” about crops in
Ukraine and Russia because it’s too early in the season to judge
the scale of any potential weather damage.  “It’s very early to say, but it should be OK, Russia and
Ukraine,” Weisser said on a conference call today. “There are
some doubts, like always, about weather. Is there going to be a
winter kill or not? It was a little bit dry in Ukraine during
planting season. But there might be, it’s early to say.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
