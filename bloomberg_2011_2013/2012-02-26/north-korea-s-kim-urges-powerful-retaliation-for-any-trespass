North Korean leader Kim Jong Un told
his military to launch a “powerful retaliatory strike” against
any trespass into his nation’s territory, as  South Korea  and the
U.S. prepare to start military drills tomorrow.  Kim made the comment during his visits to military units,
including a battalion responsible for a deadly artillery attack
in 2010 on Yeonpyeong island in the South, state-run Korean
Central News Agency said in a statement dated yesterday.  The tours precede the annual “Key Resolve” military
exercises held by the U.S. and South Korea, with the two allies
looking for signals about North Korea’s direction under the new
leader. The communist regime yesterday said it will respond to
the drills with a “sacred war,” maintaining its hostile
rhetoric and repeating routine verbal threats of attacks.  South Korea this month held live-fire naval drills in
disputed waters as a North Korean threat of “merciless
punishment” prompted the evacuation of thousands of island
residents nearby. The two Koreas are separated by the world’s
most fortified land border.  North Korea  must improve its interaction with the South to
make further progress in its relationship with the U.S., Glyn Davies, U.S. special representative, reiterated in  Seoul 
yesterday.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
