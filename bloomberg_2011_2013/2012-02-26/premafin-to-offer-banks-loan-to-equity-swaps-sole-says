Premafin Finanziaria SpA (PF)  will
propose to its bank lenders to convert part of their loans into
equity in a meeting tomorrow,  Il Sole 24 Ore  reported, without
saying where it obtained the information.  Premafin will ask banks to convert 150 million euros
($201.7 million) of debt into shares of the new entity that will
result from the planned merger of Premafin with  Unipol Gruppo
Finanziario SpA (UNI) ,  Fondiaria-Sai SpA (FSA)  and  Milano Assicurazioni SpA (MI) ,
the newspaper reported. The company will ask banks to reschedule
the remaining 170 million-euro debt, Il Sole said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
