Prudential Plc may move its
headquarters to  Hong Kong  from London, the  Sunday Times 
reported, citing a review to be mentioned in the company’s
annual report this week.  The move would be in response to the so-called European
Solvency II regulations that increase capital requirements, the
newspaper reported.  E-mails to and a telephone message left for company
spokesmen seeking comment weren’t returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
