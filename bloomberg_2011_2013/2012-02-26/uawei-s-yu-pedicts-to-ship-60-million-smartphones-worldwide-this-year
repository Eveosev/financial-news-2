Huawei Technologies Co.,  China ’s
largest maker of phone equipment, aims to triple the number of
smartphones it delivers to 60 million this year as it takes aim
at  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone and new handsets by  Nokia Oyj. (NOK1V)   About 30 percent to 40 percent of this year’s shipments
will probably go to China, Richard Yu, chairman of the company’s
devices unit, said at the  Mobile World Congress  in Barcelona.
Huawei today unveiled the Ascend D quad handset, calling it
“the world’s fastest smartphone.” The device will cost 15
percent to 20 percent less than “comparable phones.”  Huawei, based in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen,
forecast in April last year that it plans to boost revenue to
$100 billion over five to 10 years. The company, which was
founded in 1987, is also adding areas like cloud computing and
small-business networks to its traditional network-equipment
business, where it competes with companies including Ericsson AB
and Nokia Siemens Networks.  “We want to be the top brand in the industry,” Yu said.
“Our phone brand isn’t that famous, but our products should be
the best ones.”  The Ascend D quad will be sold in all major markets
starting next quarter. A version that works on networks based on
the the faster long-term evolution technology will be available
in the second half of 2012, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
