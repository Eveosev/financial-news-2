party has risen to 25 percent, making it the nation’s most
popular opposition party, the  Sunday Times  said, citing a poll.  The poll by Dublin-based market research company  Behaviour
& Attitudes , showed that backing for Sinn Fein rose four
percentage points since mid-December, the Sunday Times reported
today. Support for Ireland’s two ruling coalition parties, Fine
Gael and  Labour Party , rose 1 point to a combined 42 percent, it
said.  Fianna Fail, the country’s other opposition in parliament,
fell 4 points to 16 percent, the newspaper said.  The survey of 914 people, carried out Feb. 15-20, has a 3.3
percentage point margin of error, the Sunday Times said  To contact the reporter on this story:
