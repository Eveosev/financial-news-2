Israel ’s short-term government bond
yields rose to the highest level in more than a month amid
speculation the central bank will leave borrowing costs
unchanged tomorrow.  The yield on the 4.5 percent notes due January 2015 climbed
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 3.04 percent at
3:37 p.m. in Tel Aviv, the highest since Jan. 23. Shorter-term
notes are typically more sensitive to rate fluctuations. The
Bank of Israel will maintain the benchmark rate at 2.5 percent,
according to all of 24 analysts in a Bloomberg  survey.   “Yields on shorter-term bonds are rising as the market is
pricing in that  interest rates  may hold this month on optimism
the situation in  Europe  is getting under control,” Dror Waserman, a bonds trader at Clal Finance Brokerage Ltd. in  Tel
Aviv , said by telephone. “The Bank of Israel is expected to
pause on rates to reassess the impact of growth in Europe on the
local economy.”  Euro-area finance ministers awarded 130 billion euros ($175
billion) in aid to  Greece  and reached an accord for greater debt
relief from investor representatives in an exchange offer to
tide the nation past a bond redemption next month. Exports make
up about 40 percent of the Israeli economy and Europe is one of
its largest markets.  Interest Rate Bets  One-year interest-rate swaps , an indicator of investor
expectations for rates over the period, fell one basis point to
2.47 percent on Feb. 24. The rate has advanced 13 basis points
this month. The  Bank of Israel ’s monetary committee, led by
Governor  Stanley Fischer , lowered the benchmark lending rate to
2.5 percent on Jan. 23, the third cut in five months.  The economy expanded an annualized 3.2 percent in the
fourth quarter compared with a revised 3.8 percent in the third
quarter as exports and private consumption declined, the
statistics bureau said Feb. 16. The central bank and the  Finance
Ministry  reduced their growth predictions for this year on
concern over the impact of Europe’s debt crisis.  The one-year break-even rate, the yield difference between
the inflation-linked bond and fixed-rate government bonds of
similar maturity, fell eight basis points to 257, implying an
average annual inflation rate of 2.57 percent. The yield on the
benchmark 5.5 percent bonds due January 2022 rose one basis
point to 4.64 percent.  Israeli funds raised 343 million shekels ($91 million) from
investors in the week ended Feb. 23, Tel Aviv-based Meitav
Investment House Ltd. said today. Government bond funds drew
investments of 213 million shekels and corporate-bond funds
raised 167 million shekels, while  money market funds  recorded
redemptions.  The  Tel-Bond 40 (TEL-B40)  index of corporate bonds declined 0.2
percent to 263.58. The shekel weakened 0.7 percent to 3.7729 a
dollar on Feb. 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
