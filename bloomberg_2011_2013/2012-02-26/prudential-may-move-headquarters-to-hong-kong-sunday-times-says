Prudential Plc (PRU)  may move its
headquarters to  Hong Kong  from  London , the Sunday Times
reported, citing a review to be mentioned in the companyâ€™s
annual report this week.  The move would be in response to the so-called European
Solvency II regulations that increase  capital requirements , the
newspaper reported. The rules would force Prudential to dispose
of 11 billion pounds ($17 billion) of U.K. assets, according to 
the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
