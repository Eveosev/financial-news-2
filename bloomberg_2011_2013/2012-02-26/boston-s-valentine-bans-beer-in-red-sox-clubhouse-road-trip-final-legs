Boston  Red Sox  players can no longer
drink beer in the team’s clubhouse.  Manager Bobby Valentine banned alcohol consumption after it
was disclosed last year that starting pitchers drank beer in the
clubhouse on days they weren’t pitching. The Red Sox are the
19th of 30 Major League Baseball teams to prohibit alcohol in
the clubhouse,  MLB.com said .  The Red Sox on Sept. 4 held a nine-game lead over the Tampa
Bay Rays for the American League wild-card playoff spot. They
then went 7-20, the worst final-month collapse according to the
Elias Sports Bureau, and missed the playoffs on the season’s
final day.  Valentine, who was hired Nov. 30, two months after  Terry Francona  left, also told the team that alcohol is prohibited on
team flights at the end of road trips.  Players didn’t openly object to the rules during a meeting
at spring training camp in  Fort Myers , Florida, he said.  “You mean standing ovation or booing?” Valentine replied
when reporters sought the team’s reaction. “I didn’t get either
of those. Probably fell somewhere in between a standing O and a
standing boo.”  Designated hitter  David Ortiz  supported Valentine’s decree.  “We’re not here to drink,” Ortiz told reporters. “We’re
here to play baseball. It ain’t a bar.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
