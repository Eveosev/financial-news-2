Dubai  stocks  jumped to a 10-month
high as company earnings and dividends boosted investor
confidence and after a Greek bailout and U.S. jobs data lifted
global markets last week.  Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , developer of the world’s tallest
tower, rose 3.3 percent.  Air Arabia (AIRARABI)  PJSC climbed to the highest
since April after reporting a 7 percent increase in profit. The
 DFM General Index (DFMGI)  rallied 2.7 percent to 1,676.49, the highest
since April 21, at the 2 p.m. close in Dubai. The measure, which
entered a  bull market  last week, surged 29 percent from a low in
January. The value of shares traded  soared  to the highest since
April 2010 to 713 million dirhams ($194 million), according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The 31 stocks in Dubai’s benchmark stock index are valued
at an average  0.8 times net assets , or book value, below the
average 1.7 times for  emerging market stocks.  Volumes have
picked up this month, reaching 705  million shares  today, six
times the 12-month daily average of 117 million shares.  “The formula for good market performance was there: low
foreign participation, low expectations, and very cheap
valuations. All we needed was a catalyst,” said Fadi Al Said, a
Dubai-based senior investment manager at ING Investment
Management, which oversees about $518 billion worldwide.
“Improved sentiment driving a global rally, higher-than-
expected dividends, Emaar numbers and the United Arab Emirates’
economic recovery” also helped lift the market.  Economic Recovery  Dubai’s economy may expand as much as 5 percent this year
after growing more than 3 percent last year, according to Sheikh
Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, head of Dubai’s Supreme Fiscal
Policy Committee.  U.S. stocks rose last week, with the  Standard & Poor’s 500
Index (SPX)  climbing to the highest level since 2008, after European
finance ministers approved 130 billion euros ($175 billion) in
aid for  Greece  by tapping into European Central Bank profits and
coaxing investors into providing more debt relief to shield the
region from a default. In the U.S., jobless benefits
applications stayed at the lowest level since 2008, consumer
confidence rose to a one-year high and purchases of new homes
exceeded economists’ forecasts.  Emaar, the company with the  heaviest weighting  on Dubai’s
index, said this month fourth-quarter profit more than doubled,
beating analysts’ estimates, as revenue from malls and hotels
grew. The shares gained to 3.14 dirhams, the highest since June
21. Air Arabia, the Middle East’s biggest discount airline, rose
0.7 percent to 74.6 fils, the highest since April 26.  Fourth-
quarter profit  climbed to 78.7 million dirhams and the company
said it plans to pay a cash dividend of 4.5 fils a share for
2011.  Higher Dividends  Dubai Islamic Bank PJSC (DIB) , the U.A.E.’s biggest lender
complying with Shariah rules, rallied 1.8 percent. The company
posted a 25 percent rise in full-year profit this month and said
it plans to pay a cash dividend of 15 percent,  up from 10
percent  a year earlier.  The  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index (BGCC200)  gained 0.3 percent and Saudi
Arabia’s  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  increased 0.2 percent, its
seventh day of gains. Oman’s  MSM 30 Index (MSM30)  rose 0.4 percent and
Qatar’s  QE Index (DSM)  increased 0.5 percent. Abu Dhabi’s  ADX General
Index (ADSMI)  advanced for a sixth day, gaining 1.3 percent. Bahrain’s
 BB All Share Index (BHSEASI)  retreated 0.9 percent. Kuwait’s market was
closed for a national holiday. In North Africa, Egypt’s  EGX 30
Index (EGX30)  rallied 2.5 percent.  Israel’s TA-25 Index declined 2.3 percent, the most since
Dec. 29 as Bank Leumi Le-Israel and Israel Chemicals Ltd.
retreated. The yield on the country’s 5.5 percent notes due
January 2022 rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to
4.65 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
