Sixty-two percent of Germans want
lawmakers to reject renewed aid for  Greece  in a parliamentary
vote scheduled for tomorrow in Berlin, Bild am Sonntag said,
 citing  a poll.  Thirty-three percent said parliament should approve German
participation in Greece’s second bailout, the newspaper said in
an e-mailed advance version of an article appearing today.  Bild didn’t give a margin of error for the Feb. 23 Emnid
poll of 500 people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
