Rory McIlroy will play  Hunter Mahan 
in today’s final of golf’s World Match Play Championship.  McIlroy of Nothern Ireland beat England’s Lee Westwood 3-
and-2, while Mahan defeated fellow American  Mark Wilson  2-and-1
in this morning’s semifinals at the Ritz Carlton’s Dove Mountain
course in Marana, Arizona.  Westwood led by three after four holes. McIlroy tied the
match by the eighth hole and took the lead for good with a
birdie at the next. He stretched the advantage to three holes
after 13 and sealed the win when Westwood had a bogey at No. 17.  Mahan won the first two holes and never lost the lead
against Wilson.  McIlroy will replace England’s Luke Donald as No. 1 in the
Official World Golf Ranking if he beats Mahan in the final.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
