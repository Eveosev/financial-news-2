European Central Bank Executive
Board member Joerg Asmussen said the ECB can’t commit to
offering more three-year cash to euro-area banks after its
second batch of loans planned this week,  Handelsblatt  reported,
citing an interview.  The ECB hasn’t decided how much cash to offer in the latest
long-term refinancing operation, Asmussen was quoted as saying.
The second such operation shouldn’t stoke expectations of a
third or fourth one, he said in comments to be published in the
Dusseldorf, Germany-based newspaper tomorrow and e-mailed to
other media in advance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
