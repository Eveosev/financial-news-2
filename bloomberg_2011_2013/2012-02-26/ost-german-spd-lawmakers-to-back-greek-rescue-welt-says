Sigmar Gabriel, the leader of
 Germany ’s main opposition Social Democrats, said most of his
party’s lawmakers will back  Greece ’s second bailout, Die Welt
 reported , citing an interview.  A Greek default would have incalculable consequences and
reward speculators betting on Greece’s financial collapse,
Gabriel was quoted as saying in the Berlin-based newspaper
today.  Germany’s lower house of parliament, the Bundestag, is
scheduled to vote tomorrow on the rescue package for Greece.
Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition has 330 seats in the 620-
member chamber.  To contact the reporter on this story:
