Salvatore Ferragamo (SFER)  SpA Chief
Executive Officer  Michele Norsa  said the outlook “in general
remains positive” after a strong start to 2012, which includes
sales gains in Europe.  While Asia and the U.S. are leading revenue growth, “in
Europe, fortunately, we continue to have a very positive trend
in terms of visitors,” Norsa said in an interview before the
Florence, Italy-based company’s women’s fashion show in Milan
today. “The performance is positive, even in Europe. China
continues to grow strongly.”  “The year started very well,” Norsa said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
