Top-ranked  University of Kentucky 
defeated  Vanderbilt University  83-74 and No. 2 Syracuse beat the
University of Connecticut 71-69 to win their respective men’s
college basketball conference titles.  Kentucky  clinched the Southeastern Conference regular-
season title and Syracuse claimed the top spot in the Big East
Conference.  At Rupp Arena in Lexington, Kentucky, Anthony Davis scored
a career-high 28 points last night for the Wildcats.  “Whatever they gave me, I fed off of it,” Davis told
reporters.  The Wildcats (28-1, 14-0 SEC) have won 51 consecutive home
games and the last 20 games overall. Kentucky can go undefeated
for the third time in the SEC with victories against Georgia and
 Florida  in the next week.  Jeffery Taylor scored 19 points for Vanderbilt (20-9, 9-5
SEC), who had a 37-36 halftime advantage.  At Harry A. Gampel Pavilion in Storrs,  Connecticut , Fab
Melo scored 11 points, including a final follow-up dunk with 31
seconds left to give Syracuse the victory.  Kris Joseph scored 21 points for the Orange and Dion
Waiters had 10.  Jeremy Lamb had 19 points and Andre Drummond had 17 points
and 14 rebounds for the Huskies (17-11, 7-9 Big East), who tied
the game with 47 seconds left to play after being down by 17
points at the half.  “We should have won that game,” Drummond told reporters.
“We had a couple of tough plays down the stretch and they made
their shots. At the end of the game, we didn’t get the foul call
that we were looking for.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
