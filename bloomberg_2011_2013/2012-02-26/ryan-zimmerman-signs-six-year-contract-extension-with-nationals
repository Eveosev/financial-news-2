Ryan Zimmerman signed a six-year
contract extension with a no-trade clause that will keep the
All-Star third baseman with the  Washington  Nationals at least
until 2019.  The Nationals didn’t disclose financial terms of the deal,
which  MLB.com reported  is worth $100 million with a club option
for the 2020 season for $24 million. Zimmerman was due $26
million from the remainder of a five-year, $45 million accord he
signed in April 2009 that ran through 2013.  “It’s nice that it’s done,” Zimmerman, 27, said at a news
conference at the team’s spring training camp in Viera, Florida.
“It’s where I want to be. It’s where I’ve always wanted to
be.”  Zimmerman was Washington’s first draft pick after it moved
from Montreal in 2005. He’s a career .288 hitter with 214
doubles, 128 home runs and 498 runs batted in over 845 Major
League Baseball games and is the Nationals’ all-time leader in
games played, runs, hits, doubles, home runs and RBI.  A National League All-Star in 2009, Zimmerman was limited
by injuries to 395 at-bats in 101 games last season, when he hit
.289 with 12 homers, 21 doubles and 49 RBIs.  “Ryan Zimmerman is an exceptional talent and individual,”
Nationals General Manager Mike Rizzo said in a statement on the
team’s website. “He has been the face of the  Washington
Nationals  since baseball was returned to Washington. We’re
absolutely thrilled that Ryan will continue to help us build our
team in a winning direction.”  Washington was third in the NL East in 2011, the
franchise’s best finish in the division standings since it
relocated from Montreal.  Zimmerman is one of six players signed through at least
2019, MLB.com said. The others are Albert Pujols of the Los
Angeles Angels, Cecil Fielder of the  Detroit Tigers , Troy Tulowitzki of the  Colorado Rockies , Ryan Braun of the  Milwaukee
Brewers  and  Matt Kemp  of the  Los Angeles Dodgers .  To contact the reporter on this story:
