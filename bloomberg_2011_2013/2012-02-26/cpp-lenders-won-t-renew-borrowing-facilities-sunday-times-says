CPP Group Plc’s (CPP)  lenders won’t renew
borrowing facilities that expire in March 2013, the Sunday Times
reported without saying where it got the information.  CPP Group, a U.K. company that provides protection against
credit-card and identity theft, said it reached an agreement
Feb. 24 with the Financial Services Authority on allegations of
mis-selling, according to the article.  Paul Stobart, the company’s chief executive officer is
trying to agree new loans before its financial results are due
next month, the newspaper reported. Royal Bank of Scotland Plc,
 Barclays Plc (BARC)  and Banco Santander SA provided the borrowing
facilities expiring next year, according to the report.  CPP remains in talks with stakeholders including banks
about the impact the FSA investigation will have on its
business, the company said in a Feb. 24 statement sent by e-
mail. Helen Spivey, a spokeswoman in York,  England , for CPP
Group didn’t have any immediate further comment when contacted
by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
