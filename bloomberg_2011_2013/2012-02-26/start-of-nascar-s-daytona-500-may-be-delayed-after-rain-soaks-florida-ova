The start of the 54th  Daytona 500 
has been delayed because of rain.  Nascar’s season-opening race at the Daytona International
Speedway in  Daytona Beach ,  Florida , was scheduled to begin at
1:29 p.m. local time with Carl Edwards in pole position and his
Roush Fenway Racing teammate Greg Biffle alongside him on the
front row.  Danica Patrick  is 29th on the grid in her first visit to
the “Great American Race.” Trevor Bayne, who won last year at
his first attempt a day after his 20th birthday to become the
youngest champion, starts in 40th place.  Organizers didn’t provide a rescheduled start time for the
race, which has never been pushed back a day because of weather,
although it was shortened because of rain in 1965, 1966, 2003
and 2009.  The race will go ahead after nightfall if necessary, the
Orlando Sentinel reported, citing Joie Chitwood, president of
Daytona International Speedway.  “We’re prepared to turn on the lights if we have to,” the
Sentinel cited Chitwood as saying.  Intermittent rain is scheduled in the area throughout today
with more showers tomorrow, according to  Accuweather.com .  To contact the reporter on this story:
