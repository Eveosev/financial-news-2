Iraq  will increase power imports
from neighboring  Iran  to 1,150 megawatts from 1,000 megawatts a
day, an Electricity Ministry spokesman said.  The additional power will be imported through Iraq’s four
lines of supply from Iran “before the coming summer,” Masaab
Serri said in a telephone interview in Baghdad today.  Iraq, holder of the world’s fifth-largest oil reserves, is
struggling to rebuild its energy and electricity industry after
years of conflicts, sabotage and sanctions. The Middle East
nation has the capacity to produce about 6,000 megawatts a day,
while demand exceeds 14,000 megawatts, Electricity Minister
Abdul Kareem Aftan said in a Feb. 13 interview.  Iraq also receives 250 megawatts a day from three Turkish
ships docked off its southern coast.  To contact the reporters on this story:
