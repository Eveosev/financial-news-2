Peacocks Stores Ltd. is seeking rent
reductions and a switch to monthly payments in a bid to reopen
some of its unprofitable stores, the Sunday Times reported,
citing Chief Executive Officer Philip Day.  Day is renegotiating rental terms for 244 of the 388 stores
he bought last week and hopes to reopen 75 of them, he said in
an interview with the newspaper. He also plans to hire 80 staff
for the companyâ€™s head office, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
