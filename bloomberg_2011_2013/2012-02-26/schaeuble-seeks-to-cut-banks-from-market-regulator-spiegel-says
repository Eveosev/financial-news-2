Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble 
is seeking to remove banking representatives from the board of
 Germany ’s  BaFin  financial-market regulator and replace them with
academics or members of research institutes,  Der Spiegel 
reported, without saying how it got the information.  Schaeuble’s goal is to reduce the influence of the bank
lobbies, which currently have a vote on the BaFin’s board along
with government representatives, the magazine said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
