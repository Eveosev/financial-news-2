Zack Rosen hit two foul shots in the
final 23.2 seconds to give the University of Pennsylvania a
55-54 win over  Harvard University  and throw the Ivy League
Conference title up for grabs.  A win by Harvard last night would have guaranteed the
Crimson at least a share of the men’s college basketball
conference title.  Rosen, who had 20 points, scored the final nine for the
Quakers, who overcame a 30-24 halftime deficit at Lavietes
Pavilion in  Boston .  “It’s been a season of heart so far, and it’s going to be
a season of heart for three more games,” Rosen told reporters.
“We want this thing.”  Pennsylvania (17-11, 9-2 Ivy), which last won the Ivy
League title in 2007, ended Harvard’s 28-game home winning
streak.  Kyle Casey , who scored 12 points for Harvard, got his
basket pulled back with four seconds left in the game by a
charging call.  Harvard (24-4, 10-2 Ivy) is seeking its first National
Collegiate Athletic Association tournament spot since 1946.  “It’s a devastating loss,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker
told reporters. “It’s a disappointing loss.”  Harvard finishes the season with games against Columbia on
March 2 and Cornell on March 3.  Pennsylvania  faces Brown on
March 2, Yale on March 3 and Princeton on March 6 before the
regular season ends.  To contact the reporter on this story:
