Petroleos Mexicanosâ€™ proven reserve
replacement rate now exceeds 100 percent, meaning the Mexican
state-owned  oil company  is replacing every barrel of oil it
extracts with at least one new barrel of reserves, President
Felipe Calderon said today.  Calderon made the comment at a ceremony to start operations
of the Bicentenario semi-submersible oil platform, according to
a transcript e-mailed by his press office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
