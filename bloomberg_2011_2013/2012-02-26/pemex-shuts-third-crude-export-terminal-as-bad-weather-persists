Petroleos Mexicanos , Mexico’s state-
owned  oil company , closed a third oil export terminal, Cayo
Arcas, because of bad weather, the country’s Merchant Marine
said today on its website.  Oil export terminals Coatzacoalcos and Dos Bocas, which
were reported closed yesterday, remain shut, the Merchant Marine
said in the  report . All three are on or near the Gulf of Mexico.  Pemex, as the oil company is known, is the third-largest
supplier to the U.S., exporting about 1.3 million barrels of
crude a day in December. Canada is the largest supplier of crude
to the U.S., followed by Saudi Arabia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
