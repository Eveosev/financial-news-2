The driver of an  Athens  metro train
found an explosive device under a seat in one of his trainâ€™s
wagons yesterday evening, Greek  police  said.  The device, which consisted of a four-liter (one gallon)
container with inflammable liquid, batteries, a timer device,
cables and a switch, was found in a gift box on a train at the
Egaleo terminus station in western Athens before it was due to
pick up passengers and begin a service to  Athens International
Airport , a police spokeswoman said today in a phone interview on
condition of anonymity in keeping with police force policy.  Officers neutralized the device and a forensic
investigation is continuing, the spokeswoman said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
