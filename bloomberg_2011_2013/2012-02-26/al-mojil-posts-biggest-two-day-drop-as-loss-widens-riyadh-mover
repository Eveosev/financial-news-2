Mohammad Al-Mojil Group Co. (MMG) , a Saudi
Arabian construction services provider, had its biggest two-day
drop on record after its full-year loss widened.  The shares slumped 10 percent to 17.2 riyals at the 3:30
p.m. close in  Riyadh  today, bringing its drop in the past two
days to 19 percent, the biggest such slump since the shares
listed in May 2008. The stock was the  biggest decliner  by
percentage points on Saudi Arabia’s benchmark  Tadawul All Share
Index (SASEIDX) , which advanced 0.2 percent to 7,088.48.  “Investors are reacting to the company’s unexpected big
loss,” said Turki Fadaak, head of research at Riyadh-based
Albilad Investment Co.  The company said Feb. 22 its  net loss for the year  was
959.4 million riyals ($256 million) compared with a loss of
179.5 million riyals a year earlier. The losses were “due to
additional costs of materials, equipment and manpower of some of
the ongoing projects in excess of the approved budgets,” the
Dammam, Saudi Arabia-based company said Jan. 18.  Al-Mojil has dropped 29 percent this year after a 29
percent  surge in 2011 . One analyst recommends investors  buy  the
stock, while three have a “hold” rating, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
