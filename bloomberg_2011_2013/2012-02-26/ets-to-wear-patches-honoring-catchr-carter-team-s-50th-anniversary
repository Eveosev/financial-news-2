The  New York Mets  will honor late
catcher Gary Carter and celebrate the team’s 50th anniversary
with two patches on their uniforms this season.  Carter, a leader of the Mets’ 1986 World Series-winning
team whose enthusiasm on the field earned him the nickname “The
Kid”, died Feb. 16 at the age of 57, nine months after being
diagnosed with brain cancer. He’ll be remembered with a patch on
the team’s jersey sleeves featuring a black home plate and “KID
8” in white lettering, the Mets said.  Carter wore No. 8 for 18 of his 19 Major League Baseball
seasons, including five with the Mets. After 11 seasons with the
Montreal Expos, he spent 1985 through 1989 with the Mets and
helped guide the team through one of its most productive
periods, with a World Series title and a 485-323 record.  An 11-time All-Star and three-time Gold Glove Award winner
for his defense at catcher, Carter was inducted into the
Baseball Hall of Fame in 2003.  The Mets’ 50th anniversary logo patch, which will be worn
on the opposite sleeve, features a gold 50 over a blue  New York 
City skyline. One of the first expansion teams, the Mets
restored National League baseball to New York after the  Brooklyn
Dodgers  and  New York Giants  moved to  California  in 1958. The
Mets played their first official game on April 11, 1962, an 11-4
loss to the Cardinals in St. Louis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
