Iran  will cooperate with the
 International Atomic Energy Agency  to prove that claims
regarding the country’s nuclear program are unfounded,  Tehran
Times  reported, citing Iran’s ambassador to the organization,
Ali Asghar Soltanieh.  Soltanieh said Iran didn’t reject the IAEA’s request to
visit the Parchin military complex and that the “framework must
be agreed on for any access” to it, the Tehran Times reported.
Soltanieh spoke on Feb. 24 after the IAEA issued its latest
report on Iran’s nuclear activities to member states, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
