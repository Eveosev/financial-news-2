Ryan Callahan scored a goal in
overtime as the  New York Rangers  broke a two-game losing streak
with a 3-2 victory over the  Buffalo Sabres .  Callahan recorded his 100th National Hockey League goal and
career-high 24th of the season at two minutes, 59 seconds into
overtime last night at New York’s Madison Square Garden.  “It’s something to look back on at the end of the year --
to say that it’s nice that you got your 100th goal and career
high,” Callahan said. “It’s nice to enjoy tonight but come
Monday it’s another game.”  Drew Stafford gave the Sabres a 1-0 lead with his first of
two goals in the first period. Carl Hagelin tied it at 1-1 in
the second period.  Stafford got his second goal 44 seconds into the third
period for a 2-1 Sabres lead. Marian Gaborik scored five minutes
later to force the game into overtime.  “We played much better in the little areas of the ice,”
coach John Tortorella said. “When we tied it up, for some
reason they ended up taking the momentum. That’s part of the
game that wasn’t good. To go down early in the third period, you
don’t want to script it this way as far as a win, but it turns
out to be a good way to win. We were much better.”  New York  (39-15-6) leads the Eastern Conference with 84
points and is two points behind league-leading Vancouver.
Buffalo (27-27-8) is 11th in the conference with 62 points, six
points below the postseason cutoff.  To contact the reporter on this story:
