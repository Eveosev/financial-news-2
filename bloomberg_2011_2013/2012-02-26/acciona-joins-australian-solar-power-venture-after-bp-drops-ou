Acciona SA (ANA) , the Spanish renewable
energy company, has joined Pacific Hydro Pty in a venture
seeking Australian funds to build the Moree solar farm in New
South Wales state after partner  BP Plc (BP/)  dropped out.  Acciona will provide engineering and construction services
to the solar-power project, while Pacific Hydro and Fotowatio
Renewable Ventures will take up the ownership stake previously
held by BP, Melbourne-based  Pacific Hydro (PHY)  said in an e-mailed
statement today. The venture will sign a power-supply accord
with Pacific Hydro, which plans to start its own retail energy
group, according to the statement.  While the partners in the proposed A$923 million ($987
million) solar plant won government funds last year, they failed
to sign a power-purchase agreement in time to reach a December
financing deadline. That prompted the government to reopen the
funding competition to other bidders, including AGL Energy Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
