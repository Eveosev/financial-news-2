Eurasian Natural Resources Corp. (ENRC) 
Chairman Mehmet Dalman has been told to “refresh and revive”
the mining company’s board, the  Sunday Telegraph  reported,
without saying where it got the information.  Dalman will soon hire at least two non-executive directors,
including one to replace him in his role as senior independent
director, and he has had discussions with the company’s majority
 shareholders  from Kazakhstan about the board’s makeup, the
London-based newspaper said today.  A voicemail message left at ENRC’s London office seeking
comment outside business hours wasn’t immediately returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
