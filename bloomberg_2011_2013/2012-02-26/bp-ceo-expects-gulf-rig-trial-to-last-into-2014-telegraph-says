BP Plc (BP/)  expects the court case in the
2010 Deepwater Horizon oil rig disaster in the  Gulf of Mexico 
may stretch into 2014, the Sunday Telegraph reported, citing  an
interview  with Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley.  “We have to remember we are a business that invests in
decades-long cycles,” Dudley said in the interview, which the
Sunday Telegraph said was his first in-depth newspaper interview
since he became CEO in 2010.  The  oil company  has altered its practices since the
accident and is “now using the toughest standards in the world
for floating drilling rigs,” the Sunday Telegraph quoted Dudley
as saying. BP won’t cut its dividend and will consider share
buy-backs in the future, Dudley said, according to the
newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
