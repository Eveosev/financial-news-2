Leo Kirch’s heirs are threatening to
extend legal action against  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  if the bank doesn’t
pay damages of 812 million euros ($1.1 billion) under a proposed
settlement,  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  said, citing negotiators it
didn’t identify.  Deutsche Bank is balking at the amount, meaning the
settlement proposed by a Munich court may collapse, the Munich-
based newspaper said in an e-mailed article to appear in
tomorrow’s edition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
