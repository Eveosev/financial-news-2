Frankfurt airport ’s ground
controllers will strike for more than three days starting this
evening, resuming industrial action that started in the middle
of the month, after contract talks broke down on Feb. 24.  The employees, who handle taxiing planes and bringing
aircraft to their gates or parking stands, will halt work from 9
p.m. today until 5 a.m. March 1, the Gewerkschaft der
Flugsicherung controllers’ union said on its  website .  Traffic at Frankfurt,  Europe ’s third-busiest airport after
 London Heathrow  and Paris Charles de Gaulle, has been hampered
since the union started limited walkouts on Feb. 16. The strike
included a three-day stoppage that ended Feb. 22, when the GdF
and airport owner  Fraport AG (FRA)  agreed to restart negotiations.  The airport, which is the main hub for  Deutsche Lufthansa
AG (LHA) , can handle “extended strike periods” by the ground
controllers, Fraport said yesterday.  Fraport shifted some administrative employees who have
ground-control qualifications to handle the controllers’ jobs
during the previous walkouts. That helped lift the proportion of
scheduled services completed from 68 percent during the Feb. 16
stoppage to 85 percent on Feb. 21, Fraport said at the time.  The dispute centers on the terms of possible contracting
out of controllers’ duties and on pay increases, including an
earlier recommendation by a mediator that Fraport rejected as
excessive.  To contact the reporter on this story:
