Prime Minister and presidential
front-runner  Vladimir Putin  warned Western leaders against a
military strike on  Iran  in the latest of a series of articles
published before Russia’s March 4 elections.  “Without a doubt, Russia is concerned about the growing
threat of a military strike on this country,” Putin said. “If
this happens the fallout would be truly catastrophic.”  Officials from the  International Atomic Energy Agency  were
denied access to Iran’s Parchin military base earlier this
month, raising concern over a weapons component to the country’s
atomic program that the U.S. and Israel have signaled might
prompt an attack.  The Russian prime minister said he supports Iran’s
development of atomic energy for peaceful purposes. North
Korea’s declared nuclear weapons ambitions are “unacceptable,”
he said in the article published in the Russian newspaper
Moskovskiye Novosti.  The U.S. has a “fundamentally different understanding of
security from ours,” he said.  Putin defended  Russia ’s veto of an Arab League plan
presented to the United Nations to facilitate a political
transition in Syria earlier this month. The resolution would act
as “a signal for military interference in Syria’s internal
processes,” he said.  Syria has come under mounting international pressure as a
result of President Bashar Al-Assad’s crackdown on protesters,
which is nearing its one-year mark.  To contact the reporter on this story:
