Israel Chemicals Ltd. (ICL) , which
extracts minerals from the  Dead Sea  to make fertilizer and
 potash , declined the most in almost five months after the stock
had the biggest weekly surge since 2009.  The Tel Aviv-based company’s  shares  fell 4.3 percent, the
biggest drop since Oct. 4, to 40.98 shekels at the 4:30 p.m.
close in Tel Aviv. The shares jumped 9.7 percent last week, the
most since the week ended July 30, 2009, when it rallied 15
percent.  “It seems to be profit-taking after a strong rally of the
share most of last week,” Steven Shein, a trader at Psagot
Investment House Ltd. in Tel Aviv said by phone.  Israel Chemicals advanced last week on investor speculation
the shares are undervalued compared with its peers,  Mosaic Co. (MOS) ,
the largest U.S. potash producer, and  Potash Corporation of
Saskatchewan Inc. , the Canadian fertilizer producer. The U.S.
Department of Agriculture said farmers in 2012 will receive $5 a
bushel for corn, down 19 percent from last year, while wheat
prices will slide 14 percent and soybeans may drop 1.7 percent.  Farmers apply potash, a form of potassium, to their fields
to help strengthen plant root systems and make their crops more
resistant to drought.  Israel Chemicals is trading at 9 times estimated earnings,
compared with 12.6 estimated earnings for Potash Corp. and 12.3
times for Mosaic. Israel Chemicals has advanced 3.8 percent
since the start of the year.  Israel Corp. (ILCO) , which has a 52.3 percent stake in Israel
Chemicals according to data compiled by Bloomberg, declined 5
percent to 2,300 shekels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
