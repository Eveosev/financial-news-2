European central banks may be unable
to make a profit on Greek sovereign bonds that euro-area
governments want to use in the country’s second bailout,
European Central Bank council member Jens Weidmann was quoted as
saying by  Der Spiegel .  Weidmann said it’s “not certain at all” that the bonds
will make a profit, the German magazine reported today, citing
an interview. Risks on the central banks’ balance sheets have
actually increased, Weidmann was quoted as saying.  Germany ’s Bundesbank, which Weidmann heads, will increase
its risk provisions, lowering its 2011 profit payout to the
German government, he was quoted as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
