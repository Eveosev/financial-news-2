United Development Co. (UDCD) , a Qatari
investor in infrastructure and energy, said an investor is
seeking to become a strategic shareholder in the company.  The company received a new letter from Qatar National Bank,
representative of an investor, indicating it “still wants to
join the company as a strategic shareholder by way of increasing
the capital,” according to a  statement  on the Qatar bourse
today.  United Development said on Jan. 29 that an investor pulled
a request to buy a stake in the company after seeking to change
the terms of an offer.  Qatar’s Pension and Social Insurance Authority offered to
buy 80 million stocks of United Development for 20 riyals a
share to become a “strategic shareholder” in the company,
United Development said on Dec. 28.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
