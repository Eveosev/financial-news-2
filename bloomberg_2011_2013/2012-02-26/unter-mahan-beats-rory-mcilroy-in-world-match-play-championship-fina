Hunter Mahan  beat Rory McIlroy in
the final of the World Match Play Championship for his fourth
title on golf’s U.S.  PGA Tour .  Mahan’s 2-and-1 win at the Ritz-Carlton’s Dove Mountain
course in Marana, Arizona, prevented the second-ranked McIlroy
from replacing Luke Donald as world No. 1.  Mahan, 29, is the first U.S. player to claim the title
since  Tiger Woods  won for a third time in 2008. Today’s final
was the first between a European and an American since Steve Stricker defeated Pierre Fulke of Sweden in the title match 11
years ago.  Mahan’s first win on the PGA Tour came at the Travelers
Championship in 2007. He also won the Phoenix Open and
Bridgestone Invitational two years ago.  McIlroy was seeking to become the fifth European and second
golfer from Northern Ireland after  Darren Clarke  in 2000 to win
the World Match Play title. A victory for McIlroy would have
been the third straight for the U.K. at the event, which was won
by Englishman Donald and  Ian Poulter  the past two years.  McIlroy, at 22 years, nine months and 22 days, was seeking
to become the second-youngest golfer to top the  Official World
Golf Ranking  after Woods, who was 21 years, five months and 17
days old when he first achieved the feat on June 15, 1997.  To contact the reporter on this story:
