Asian  stocks  fell, with a regional
benchmark index retreating after a record 10-week advance, as
oil near a nine-month high and continued concern that  Greece 
will not be able to avoid a default spurred investors to lock in
gains.  Korean Air Lines Co., the nation’s biggest carrier by
market value, sank 5.3 percent in Seoul.  Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) , a
clothier that gets most of its revenue from  Europe , slid 3
percent in  Hong Kong .  Sony Corp. (6758) ,  Japan ’s No. 1 exporter of
consumer electronics, gained 1.2 percent in  Tokyo  as the yen
fell to a nine-month low against the dollar, boosting the
earnings outlook for the country’s exporters.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index slid 0.8 percent to 126.97 as
of 8:16 p.m. in Tokyo, accelerating its drop after Moody’s
Investors Service said the risk that Greece will default
“remains high.” The index advanced for a 10th week last week,
its longest run of gains since its inception in 1988. Shares
rose amid confidence  China  will ease monetary policy and signs
the  U.S. economy  is improving.  “Oil prices are definitely a concern,” Bharat Joshi, who

and Europe continues to be in the background.”  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  slipped 0.1 percent after
swinging between gains and losses. The yen touched 81.67 per

exporters’ overseas earnings when repatriated.  Sony gained 1.2 percent to 1,760 yen, while Honda Motor

section rose for a 30th day, extending its longest stretch of
gains since 1961. Kagetsuenkanko Co., a hotel and resort
manager, climbed 40 percent to 161 yen, the biggest increase on
the TSE Second Section Price Index. The stock has risen 475
percent since Jan. 16, the last close before the gauge began its
streak.  “It’s a huge fuel for Japanese exporters if the yen can
maintain or continue to depreciate from current levels given
it’s been such a substantial headwind,” said  Tim Schroeders ,
who helps manage $1 billion in equities at Pengana Capital Ltd.
in Melbourne.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  gained 12 percent this year
