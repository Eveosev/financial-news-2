Greece  expects to earn $15 billion
in revenue over the next 10 years from existing oil and natural
gas reserves, Deputy Energy Minister Yiannis Maniatis said.  “What we know today about potential hydrocarbon reserves
in Greece is little,” Maniatis said today in an interview
televised live on private Mega TV. The potential revenue isn’t
included in Greece’s loan agreement with international
creditors, Maniatis said.  Greece is trying to learn from the example of Cyprus, which
recently discovered natural gas reserves, and the two countries
are working closely to see how they can combine their
hydrocarbon exploration efforts, Maniatis said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
