the lowest intraday level since January 1995. The shares have
declined 16 percent, since a government committee called for
holding companies to limit their pyramid structures, raising
speculation they may need to sell assets. The holding company
last week also sold shares.  Israel Chemicals Ltd. (ICL)  , which extracts minerals
from the Dead Sea to make fertilizer and potash, declined the
most since Dec. 29, dropping 3.3 percent to 41.40 shekels. The
stock jumped 9.7 percent last week, the most since the week
ended July 30. “It seems to be profit taking after a strong
rally of the share most of last week,” said Steven Shein, a
trader at Psagot Investment House Ltd. in Tel Aviv.  Mellanox Technologies Ltd. (MLNX)  (MLNX IT ) gained 2.6 percent to
144.30 shekels, or the equivalent of $38.25, headed for the
highest close in Tel Aviv since Bloomberg started tracking the
stock in July 2007. The U.S. traded shares of the adapter maker
closed up 2.1 percent at $38.76 in  New York  on Feb. 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
