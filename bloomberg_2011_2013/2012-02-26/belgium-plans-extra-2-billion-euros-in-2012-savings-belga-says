The Belgian government will seek
extra budget savings of around 2 billion euros ($2.7 billion)
this year in a bid to bring the deficit within the European
Union limit amid a weaker economy, Belga reported.  Leading members of Premier Elio Di Rupo’s administration
endorsed in Brussels yesterday a budget-monitoring panel’s
projection that the additional amount of austerity is needed to
reach a deficit goal of 2.8 percent of gross domestic product in
2012, the newswire said.  The monitoring committee recommended savings of 1.5 billion
euros and a buffer of 500 million euros, according to Belga,
which said the government aims for a decision in a week
following further ministerial consultations.  Belgium’s budget for 2012 was drafted on the assumption the
country’s economy would expand 0.8 percent this year. The
Belgian central bank in mid-February forecast an economic
contraction in 2012 of 0.1 percent. The EU deficit limit is 3
percent of GDP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
