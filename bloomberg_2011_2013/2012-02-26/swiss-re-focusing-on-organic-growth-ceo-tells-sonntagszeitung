Swiss Re Ltd (SREN) . is currently not
focusing on acquisitions, Chief Executive Officer Michel Lies
told  SonntagsZeitung  in an interview.  The company is very much able at “growing organically,”
Lies was quoted as saying by the Swiss newspaper. Swiss Re’s
high liquidity enables the reinsurer to choose customers
selectively and allows sustainable dividend payments, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
