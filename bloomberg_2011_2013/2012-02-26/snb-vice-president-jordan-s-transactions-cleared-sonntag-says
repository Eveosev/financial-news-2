Financial  transactions by  Swiss
central bank  vice president Thomas Jordan have been cleared by
KPMG auditors, Swiss newspaper  Der Sonntag  reported, without
saying where it obtained the information.  The bank council of the  Swiss National Bank  asked auditors
to look into transactions by the SNB Enlarged Governing Board
members for the three years through 2011 after Philipp Hildebrand was forced to resign as SNB president last month
because of a currency transaction carried out by his wife.  As vice president, Jordan is the front runner to succeed
Hildebrand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
