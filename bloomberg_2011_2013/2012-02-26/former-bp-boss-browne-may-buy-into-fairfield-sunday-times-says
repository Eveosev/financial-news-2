(Corrects  John Browne â€™s role at Riverstone in first
paragraph.)  A private equity company that
includes former BP Plc Chief Executive Officer John Browne among
its partners is in advanced talks to buy as much as half of
Fairfield Energy Ltd., a U.K.-based oil and gas business, the
Sunday Times reported.  Browne heads the European unit of Riverstone Holdings LLC,
which may acquire additional North-Sea oil and gas assets if it
were to buy a stake in Fairfield Energy, the newspaper reported,
without saying where it got its information. Riverstone and
Fairfield together would have 30 billion pounds ($48 billion)
under management, according to the report. Fairfield is
controlled by Warburg Pincus LLC, a private equity fund based in
 New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
