Options traders are making the most
bullish bets on Yandex NV since Russia’s top search engine first
sold shares nine months ago on speculation rising online
advertising growth will bolster company revenue.  The ratio of outstanding  call options  to buy Yandex’s U.S.-
traded shares versus puts to sell jumped to a record 3.15-to-1
on Feb. 24, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Futures (VEA)  expiring in
March on Moscow’s RTS Index rose 5.4 percent to 172,585 in U.S.
trading on Feb. 24. Yandex gained 2.9 percent last week.  Sales will jump as much as 45 percent in 2012, following a
60 percent advance last year, Chief Financial Officer Alexander Shulgin said on a conference call on Feb. 22 after Yandex
reported that fourth-quarter adjusted net income surged 50
percent to 2.2 billion rubles ($75 million). Internet ad
spending climbed the most of all advertising in Russia last
year, growing 56 percent to 41.8 billion rubles, according to
the Association of Communication Agencies of Russia.  “Online advertising sales have a huge growth potential in
the Russian market,”  Anna Lepetukhina , an analyst at Troika
Dialog who has a “buy” rating on the company, said by phone
from Moscow on Feb. 24. “Yandex has excellent prospects and a
fast sales-growth rate, right now it is undervalued.”  The  Bloomberg Russia-US 14 Index (RUS14BN)  of Russian companies
traded in  New York  rose 4 percent to 113.24 on Feb. 24, bringing
its weekly gain to 3.8 percent.  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , a U.S.-traded fund that
holds Russian shares, rose 4.1 percent to $33.13, the highest
closing price since September 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. The fund gained 4 percent last week and is up 24 percent
this year, compared with a 3.4 percent gain in the same period a
year ago.  March $24 Calls  The fastest growing bets among all Yandex options contracts
over the past two weeks are March $24 calls, which expire in
less than three weeks. Yandex last closed above that strike
price, 5.7 percent higher than what the shares traded at on Feb.
24, on Nov. 15, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Options are contracts that give the right, though not the
obligation, to buy or sell a security at a set price and date.
Calls give the right to buy a security for a certain amount, the
strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the right to sell.  Investors use options to guard against fluctuations in the
price of securities they own, to speculate on share-price moves
or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will rise or fall.  Shares of Yandex fell 1.2 percent to $22.70 on Feb. 24,
bringing the decline since its May listing to 42 percent. Troika
has a $38.50 price target for Yandex.  ‘Better’ Than Mail.ru  The company saw its share of the Russian search market drop
to 59.6 percent in January, compared with a three-month average
of 59.9 percent, according to  Liveintenet.ru , an Internet-
service provider and researcher. The market share of  Mail.ru
Group Ltd. (MAIL) , the largest Russian-language  Internet company  and an
investor in Web companies including Facebook Inc. and Groupon
Inc., rose to 8.5 percent from a three-month average of 8.4
percent, the data showed.  Yandex is a “better option to gain exposure to the Russian
Internet market than shares of Mail.ru Group, which could be
subject to volatility due to its considerable exposure to
Facebook,” analysts at UralSib Financial Corp. in Moscow, led
by Konstantin Chernyshev, head of research, wrote in a Feb. 22
note.  Mail.ru soared to a 13-month high on Feb. 24 after
reporting a tripling in second-half net income and forecasting
margins of 50 percent this year. The company’s Global Depositary
Receipts are up 47 percent in 2012, the best start to a year
since the stock started trading in November 2010.  Urals Surges  The  RTS Volatility Index (RTSVX) , which measures expected swings in
the index futures, declined as much as 10 percent to 27.56 on
Feb. 24, the lowest level since Aug. 3. The index settled at
29.38, down 4.1 percent from the previous close and 4.9 percent
lower from the previous week.  Urals crude ,  Russia ’s chief export blend and biggest export
earner, surged 0.8 percent to $124.99 per barrel on Feb. 24, the
strongest level since July 2008.  Crude oil for April delivery rose 1.8 percent, to $109.77
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  on Feb. 24, the highest
settlement since May 3 and completing the longest rally since
January 2010 as escalating tension with  Iran  threatened
supplies. Futures dropped 0.3 percent today to $109.46 a barrel.  Brent oil for April settlement gained 1.5 percent to
$125.47 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, the
highest close since April.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index, a gauge of stocks in the
region, fell 0.2 percent today as higher  oil prices  raised
concern higher energy costs will weigh on economic growth.
 United Co. Rusal (486) , the world’s largest aluminum producer, rose
2.3 percent to HK$6.72 in Hong Kong trading as of the city’s
midday break.  Cheapest BRIC  OAO Surgutneftegas’s (SGTPY)  ADRs rose 6.8 percent to $6.93 in U.S.
trading on Feb. 24, the highest level since November 2007. The
Russian oil company’s stock was the biggest gainer on the
 Bloomberg Russia-US 14 (RUS14BN)  measure last week, advancing 7.4 percent.
Preferred  shares  on Moscow’s Micex Index increased 6 percent on
Feb. 24 to 20.373 rubles, or 70 U.S. cents. One ADR equals ten
