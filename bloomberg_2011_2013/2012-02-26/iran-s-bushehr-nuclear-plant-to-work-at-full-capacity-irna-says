Iran ’s Bushehr nuclear plant, the
country’s first, will start operating at full capacity at the
beginning of the new Iranian year, the official  Islamic Republic
News Agency  reported, citing Iranian Atomic Energy Organization
chief Fereydoun Abbasi-Davani.  Abbasi-Davani didn’t give a specific date. Iran’s new year
starts on March 20th. He had said last month that Bushehr would
start operating at full capacity on Feb. 1.  Iran linked the 1000-megawatt power plant, which had been
disconnected for tests, to the national grid on Feb. 11 and it
began generating 700 megawatts of electricity, Abbasi-Davani
said yesterday, according to IRNA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
