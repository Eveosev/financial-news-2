Cerberus Capital Management LP’s
tender offer for Seibu Holdings Inc. shares ends today, as the
private-equity company seeks to boost its control of the
Japanese rail and hotel operator.  Cerberus, which owns 32.4 percent of Seibu, offered to buy
more shares to raise its holdings to as much as 44.7 percent.
Cerberus has also recommended that executives, including former
U.S. Vice President Dan Quayle, be appointed to Seibu’s board.  The New York-based private equity firm, which oversees more
than $20 billion, is battling with Seibu to delay an initial
public offering for up to three years as it seeks changes at the
company to improve profitability. Seibu President Takashi Goto
has said he won’t offer “any concessions” to Cerberus.  Cerberus led a bailout of the company with Nikko Principal
Investments Japan Ltd. in 2005 after the rail operator was
delisted from the Tokyo Stock Exchange the year before for
breaking exchange rules by misstating stakes. Seibu said earlier
this year that it is now “financially prepared” for the
relisting.  To contact the reporters on this story:
