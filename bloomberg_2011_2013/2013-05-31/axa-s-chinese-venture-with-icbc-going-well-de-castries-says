Axa SA (CS) ’s Chinese life-insurance
partnership with Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. is
going well, said Chief Executive Officer Henri de Castries.  The Paris-based insurer’s first-half revenue from the
operation is increasing six-fold from a year before, he said.  “This is the right choice,” de Castries said at a
presentation near  Bordeaux  today. “It’s growing very fast.”  Axa, Europe’s second-largest insurer, last year created a
partnership in China in which ICBC owns 60 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
