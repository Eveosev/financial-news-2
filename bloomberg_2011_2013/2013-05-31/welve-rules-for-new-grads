What advice would you give new college graduates about launching themselves into the workforce? Beginning May 12, 2013, I facilitated a  discussion  around this question on LinkedIn. The hundreds of responses offered a wealth of advice and insight about what it takes to make a successful transition from college into the workforce. I distilled the discussion down into twelve key pieces of advice — "rules" if you will — for getting off to a good start in one's career. Each rule is adapted from a quote from a participant in the discussion. (There often were multiple postings with similar themes, so these are simply selections.)
