PetroVietnam Drilling & Well Services
Joint-Stock Co., the country’s biggest listed oilfield services
provider, forecasts profit this year may rise 29 percent as
rates for drilling rigs increase.  Net income may reach 1.7 trillion dong ($81 million) in
2013 from 1.32 trillion dong last year, Chief Financial Officer
Ho Ngoc Yen Phuong said in a phone interview yesterday. Sales
are expected to be 13.1 trillion dong, compared with 11.9
trillion dong in 2012.  The Ho Chi Minh City-based company will experience “high
growth” this year as contracted day rates for its rigs has
risen 15 percent to an average of $155,000 per day, Phuong said.
Rig prices are expected to increase further as demand outstrips
supply, she said.  PetroVietnam Drilling shares climbed as much as 6.1 percent
to 52,500 dong and traded at 51,500 dong, headed for their
highest close since May 19, 2011, as of the midday break on the
Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange today. The stock has advanced 37
percent this year, outpacing the 26 percent advance in the
benchmark  VN Index. (VNINDEX)   The company will start operating two new rigs from the
third quarter, bringing its total to nine, Phuong said.
PetroVietnam Drilling, partly owned by  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , had
earlier this year set a target of 1.36 trillion dong for profit
and 11.3 trillion dong for sales.  The oilfield services provider is a unit of Vietnam Oil &
Gas Group, known as PetroVietnam.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
