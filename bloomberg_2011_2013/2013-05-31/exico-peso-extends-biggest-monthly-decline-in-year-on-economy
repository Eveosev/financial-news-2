Mexico ’s peso fell, extending its
biggest monthly decline in a year, as a surge in U.S. Treasury
yields sapped demand for the Latin American nation’s assets.  The peso depreciated 0.2 percent to 12.8117 per dollar at
1:45 p.m. in Mexico City, extending the drop this month to 5.3
percent, the biggest since May 2012. The currency had advanced
to 11.9771 on May 8, its strongest level since August 2011.  The currency has tumbled this month on speculation the
 Federal Reserve  will curtail a program of asset purchases that
have kept U.S. yields low. The peso rallied earlier this year as
investors in developed markets avoided near-zero  interest rates 
at home and bet that Mexico would pass legal changes to speed
economic growth.  “Four months of euphoria in Mexico and three weeks of
terror,” Alejandro Silva, who helps oversee $800 million in
emerging-market assets at Silva Capital Management in  Chicago ,
said in an e-mailed response to questions.  Yields on benchmark peso-denominated debt maturing in
December 2024 rose for an 11th day, increasing seven basis
points, or 0.07 percentage point to 5.48 percent, the highest
level on a closing basis since Jan. 11. Yields have surged 95
basis points this month, the most since June 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
