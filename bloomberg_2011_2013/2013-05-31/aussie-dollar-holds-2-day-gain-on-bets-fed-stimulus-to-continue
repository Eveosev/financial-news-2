Australia ’s dollar held a two-day
gain versus the greenback as Asian shares rallied and before
U.S. data that may add to the case for the Federal Reserve to
maintain stimulus.  The Aussie strengthened against most of its 16 major peers
after report showed that  private sector credit  increased in
April.  Interest-rate swaps  data compiled by Bloomberg signaled
an 81 percent chance the Reserve Bank of Australia will hold its
benchmark interest rate at 2.75 percent next week. The New
Zealand dollar maintained gains after the nation’s terms of
trade rose more than economists estimated.  “I don’t think the Fed is going to taper any time soon,”
said Derek Mumford, a director at Rochford Capital, a currency
risk-management company in Sydney. “The U.S. dollar strength is
not entirely justified. The Aussie is still struggling to get to
97 cents, but if it does break above it, there will be stop-losses which could see it spike up to 97.80.”  Australia’s dollar added 0.1 percent to 96.72 U.S. cents as
of 11:52 a.m. in Sydney from yesterday, after having risen 0.5
percent in the previous two sessions. It’s headed for a 0.2
percent increase this week. The Aussie slid 0.1 percent to
NZ$1.1954 from yesterday, poised for a 0.3 percent weekly gain,
the first in 11 weeks. It climbed 0.4 percent to 97.69 yen.  New Zealand’s dollar strengthened 0.2 percent to 80.94 U.S.
cents. The kiwi rose 0.5 percent to 81.74 yen. New Zealand’s
currency is little changed against the greenback this week and
is 0.4 percent weaker versus the yen.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of shares climbed 0.4 percent,
recovering from a 1.7 percent drop yesterday. Australia’s  10-year government note  yield slid two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 3.37 percent.  Fed Bets  U.S. consumer spending was probably unchanged in April from
the previous month, according to the median estimate of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News before the data today.
Personal income rose 0.1 percent last month, compared with an
0.2 percent in March, economists  predicted .  Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said last week that the
central bank may slow quantitative easing if officials see
indications of sustained improvement in economic growth. Reports
yesterday showed first-quarter gross domestic product was
revised down to a 2.4 percent annualized rate from 2.5 percent
reported last month and an increase in jobless claims.  In Australia, private sector credit rose 0.3 percent last
month, when it grew 0.2 percent, according to economists in a
separate Bloomberg survey.  New Zealand’s terms of trade  index , which measures the
price of exports relative to imports, rose 4.1 percent in the
first quarter from the previous three-month period, when it fell
a revised 1.2 percent, Statistics New Zealand said in a
statement in Wellington today. Economists had expected a 1.5
percent increase.  To contact the reporters on this story:
