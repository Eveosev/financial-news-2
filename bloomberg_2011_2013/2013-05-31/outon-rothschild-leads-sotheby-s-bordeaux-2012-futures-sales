Chateau Mouton-Rothschild led sales
of Bordeaux 2012 wine futures by  Sotheby’s (BID)   New York  retail
business this year, followed by two other left-bank first-growth
estates,  Chateau Margaux  and Chateau Lafite-Rothschild.  Mouton was priced at $4,488 a case, 30 percent below its
2011 level, while Margaux was 31 percent down, also at $4,488,
and Lafite 22 percent lower at $6,348, according to data e-mailed by Sotheby’s. The three led in terms of total value of
each wine sold.  The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index has risen 5 percent this
year, with an 8 percent gain in the 10 weeks to mid-March pared
by a decline of more than 2 percent since then. Investor
attention has been focused on the 2012 futures campaign for the
past two months, after demand for top-growth Bordeaux wines
revived following a 16-month price slide ending in mid-November.  Other leading 2012 futures sold by Sotheby’s included
Chateau La Mission Haut-Brion, priced 28 percent lower at $2,796
a case, Chateau Cheval Blanc, also down 28 percent from 2011 at
$5,628,  Chateau Palmer , down 5 percent at $2,748, and Chateau
Ausone, down 23 percent at $3,450, the data showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Guy Collins in London on
