U.S. Treasury  Secretary Jacob J. Lew
said he is suspending reinvestment of the Government Securities
Investment Fund of the Federal Employees’ Retirement System, one
of the measures to avoid exceeding the nation’s $16.7 trillion
debt limit.  The measure, disclosed today in a letter from Lew to
congressional leaders of both parties, provides about $160
billion in headroom under the debt limit, according to a
Treasury official.  The so-called G-Fund is a money market defined-contribution
retirement fund for federal employees. It is invested in
special-issue  Treasury securities , which count against the debt
limit.  Lew said this month that the Treasury’s extraordinary
measures and a one-time payment from  Fannie Mae  will allow the
U.S. to stay under the debt limit at least until September.  To contact the reporters on this story:
