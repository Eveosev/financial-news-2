Turkey ’s  trade deficit  widened more
than expected to $10.3 billion in April, sending bond yields
higher and the lira down.  The gap widened 55 percent from a year earlier, the
statistics office in Ankara said on its website today. It was
forecast at $7.8 billion, according to the  median estimate  of
five economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The monthly deficit was
the biggest since September 2011.  The lira reversed gains after the data were published,
dropping 0.3 percent to 1.8798 at 10:10 a.m. in Istanbul. The
currency has dropped 4.6 percent against the dollar this month.
Yields on benchmark  two-year lira bonds  jumped 18 basis points
to 5.97 percent, heading for an eight-week high.  Turkey’s central bank has cut its benchmark  interest rate 
for the past two months, reducing it to 4.5 percent as it sought
to weaken the lira and make the country’s exports more
competitive.  Exports fell 0.9 percent from a year earlier in April to
$12.5 billion, while imports jumped 18 percent to $22.8 billion,
the statistics office said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
