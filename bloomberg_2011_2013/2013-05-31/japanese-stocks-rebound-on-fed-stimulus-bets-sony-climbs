A rebound in Japanese  stocks  was
limited by falling carmakers and shipping lines as price swings
continued near a two-year high. The market’s plunge yesterday
extended its drop to more than 10 percent since last week.  Shipping companies  dropped the most among the Topix index’s
33 industry groups today, with Mitsui O.S.K Lines Ltd. falling
4.2 percent. Honda Motor Co. sank 1.2 percent as the yen
strengthened. Fast Retailing Co. climbed 5.1 percent, clawing
back about a half of yesterday’s loss.  Sony Corp. (6758)  increased 2.1
percent after people familiar with the matter said the
electronics maker is consulting banks about a proposal to take
part of its entertainment unit public.  The Topix added 0.1 percent to close at 1,135.78 in  Tokyo 
after yesterday dropping 3.8 percent.  Historical volatility  on
the gauge was near the highest since the March 2011 disaster.
Share rose as much as 2 percent in the morning session as
weaker-than-expected U.S. data bolstered the case for continued
Federal Reserve stimulus.  “The market is trying to find a place to settle,” said
Takashi Aoki, a Tokyo-based  fund manager  at Mizuho Asset
Management Co., which oversees about $33 billion. “We don’t
know where the bottom is yet. Volatility is likely to continue
for a while”  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average climbed 1.4 percent to
13,774.54, with the measure’s  volatility  about 60 percent above
average. Gains outpaced those on the Topix as Fast Retailing and
Fanuc Corp., which together account for about 15 percent of the
benchmark, each added more than 4 percent. Volume on the measure
was 3.1 percent above the 100-day average.  Abe Rally  The Topix fell 2.5 percent in May, it’s first monthly drop
since the rally began mid-November. The gauge is still up 32
percent this year, the most among major markets. Shares have
risen on optimism Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and  Bank of Japan 
Governor Haruhiko Kuroda will pull the country out of 15 years
of deflation.  Mitsui O.S.K,  Japan ’s second-biggest shipper by market
value, lost 4.2 percent to 369 yen today. Nippon Yusen KK, the
largest, declined 1.9 percent to 266 yen. The Topix Marine
Transport measure is down almost 20 percent from its 52-week
high, the third-biggest decline among the Topix industry groups.  Carmakers exerted the  biggest drag  on the Topix today,
declining as the yen strengthened to as much as 100.68 per
dollar from as weak as 101.28. A gain in the yen hurts overseas
earnings when repatriated.  Honda dropped 1.2 percent to 3,830 yen. Toyota Motor Corp.,
the world’s biggest carmaker, lost 0.8 percent to 6,010 yen.
Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd., which gets 47 percent of its revenue
from  North America , dropped 4.2 percent to 2,349 yen.  Sony Advances  Among stocks that gained, Sony advanced 2.1 percent to
2,049 yen. The electronics company is working with Morgan
Stanley and Citigroup Inc. as it considers adopting billionaire
shareholder  Daniel Loeb ’s proposal for an initial public
offering of its entertainment unit, people familiar with the
matter said.  Fast Retailing gained 5.1 percent to 34,900 yen after
plunging 11 percent yesterday. Fanuc climbed 4.3 percent to
15,240 yen, recovering yesterday’s 4.1 percent loss.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed today. The gauge added 0.4 percent yesterday as slower-than-expected economic growth and higher jobless claims fueled
speculation the Fed won’t rush to curtail stimulus.  To contact the reporter on this story:
