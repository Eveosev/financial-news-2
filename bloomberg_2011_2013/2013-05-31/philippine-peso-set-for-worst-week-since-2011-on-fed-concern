The Philippine peso completed its
worst week in a year as foreign funds reduced their holdings of
the nation’s assets amid concern the  Federal Reserve  will cut
monetary stimulus.  The  Philippine Stock Exchange Composite Index (PCOMP)  dropped 3.4
percent in the past five days, its biggest loss in 12 months.
The peso touched an 11-month low yesterday before the government
reported economic growth accelerated to 7.8 percent last quarter
from a revised 7.1 percent in the preceding three months. It
rose 0.2 percent today.  “We anticipate the feel-good sentiment spawned by the
first-quarter GDP would not prosper against a strong  U.S. dollar 
in the near term,” said Jun Trinidad, an economist in Manila at
Citigroup Inc.  The peso weakened 1.6 percent this week to 42.263 per
dollar in Manila, the biggest loss since the five days ended May
18, 2012, according to prices from Tullett Prebon Plc. The
currency touched 42.625 yesterday, the lowest level since June
25. It declined 2.6 percent this month, the most in a year.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, increased 72 basis
points, or 0.72 percentage point, this week to 6.63 percent. The
gauge dropped 90 basis points today.  Overseas funds sold $112 million more local stocks than
they bought this week through yesterday, exchange data show. Fed
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said last week that the central bank’s
$85 billion of monthly bond purchases may be tapered if there
are signs of a sustained recovery in the  U.S. economy .  ‘Fundamentals Sound’  The higher growth in the Philippines is sustainable as
investments have increased and employment has improved, central
bank Governor Amando Tetangco told reporters in Manila
yesterday.  “Over the medium term, there’s still room for the
Philippine peso to appreciate,” said Dominic Bunning, a
foreign-exchange strategist in  Hong Kong  at HSBC Holdings
Plc.“The fundamentals are still sound.”  The yield on the 5.875 percent sovereign bonds due March
2032 climbed 39 basis points this week to 4.34 percent,
according to prices from Tradition Financial Services. The rate
fell 11 basis points today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
