Krispy Kreme Doughnuts Inc. (KKD) , the
sweet-treat retailer that has been pushing beverages, advanced
to the highest price in more than eight years after boosting its
annual profit forecast amid higher same-store sales.  The shares  rose  21 percent to $17.32 at the close in New
York for the highest price since July 2004. The Winston-Salem,
North Carolina-based company said yesterday that annual per-share profit will be as much as 11 percent higher than it
previously forecast.  Krispy Kreme, with about 770 shops globally, has recently
promoted fancier drinks, such as frozen pink lemonade and Kaffe
Kreme coffees, to help draw customers from competitors including
Dunkin’ Donuts and  Starbucks Corp. (SBUX)  Same-store sales at company
locations rose 11 percent during the quarter ended May 5, the
18th consecutive quarterly increase, according to a company
statement.  “The lattes and some of the higher-priced coffee
derivative drinks were picking up pace” during the quarter,
Chief Executive Officer James Morgan said during a conference
call with analysts yesterday, after the markets closed.  Profit will be as much as 63 cents a share in the company’s
fiscal 2014, compared with a previous  forecast  of as much as 57
cents, Krispy Kreme said yesterday in the statement. Analysts
had estimated 58 cents, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Krispy Kreme has gained 85 percent this year, while the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has added 14 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
