PulteGroup Inc. (PHM) ,the largest U.S.
homebuilder by market value, next year will move its corporate
offices to Atlanta from  Bloomfield Hills ,  Michigan , to be closer
to its customers.  Many of the company’s buyers are purchasing homes in
subdivisions along the East Coast, PulteGroup said in a
statement today. In 2012, developments from northern Virginia to
Florida represented 37 percent of its home closings and 43
percent of its year-end invested capital. Ninety-two percent of
PulteGroup’s investments are outside of its midwestern markets,
up from 72 percent 12 years ago, the builder said.  “We have historically managed our growth from Michigan,
but the company has reached a point where we must pursue a
strategy that better fits with the long-term growth trends,”
Chief Executive Officer  Richard Dugas  said in the statement.
“This relocation will bring us closer to our customers and a
larger portion of our investment portfolio.”  The company was founded in Michigan in 1950 by William J. Pulte, who retired from the business in 2010. PulteGroup has 380
employees in Michigan, 54 of which won’t be affected by the move
because they work in local homebuilding operations, which will
remain in the area. The company, which employs 3,400 people in
28 states, expects to have 300 to 350 workers in its offices in
Georgia.  Other homebuilders based in the Atlanta area include  Beazer
Homes USA Inc. (BZH)  and closely held Peachtree Communities Inc. and
Ashton Woods Homes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
