Protesters temporarily blocked the
entrance to the European Central Bank in  Frankfurt  before
disrupting the city’s main shopping street and demonstrating at
Frankfurt airport.  Organizers of the Blockupy movement said the number of
demonstrators exceeded the 3,000 who took part in last year’s
event, among them protesters from  Italy , Spain,  France  and other
European countries. Frankfurt police put the number at about
1,500 today.  “We gave a clear signal against the Troika policy the ECB
helps implementing,” Ani Diesselmann, a Blockupy spokeswoman,
said in a telephone interview. She said the ECB’s policy
decisions during the euro-area debt crisis had shored up big
banks while impoverishing citizens.  Protests in front of the ECB tower from about 6.30 a.m.
until 10.30 a.m. local time were peaceful with the exception of
a few demonstrators who tried to break through crash barriers
placed at the site for security reasons, according to police
spokesman Max Weiss. An ECB spokesman said operations were
normal with some staff working from home.  Campaigners later marched past  Deutsche Bank (DBK)  AG’s
headquarters to Frankfurt’s Zeil shopping street, where they
blocked shopfronts and conducted sit-ins. Police said several
people were charged with breach of the peace.  Protesters also demonstrated at Frankfurt airport, where
about 200 campaigners were allowed inside a terminal as others
stayed outside. Fraport, the airport operator, is advising
passengers to arrive early for flights.  To contact the reporter on this story:
