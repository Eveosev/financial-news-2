Colombia ’s peso plunged to a 16-month
low on speculation the central bank will extend its dollar
purchase program that ends today.  The peso weakened 0.9 percent to 1,907.70 per  U.S. dollar 
at 10:05 a.m. in Bogota. Earlier it dropped to 1,919.61, the
lowest since Jan. 3, 2012.  The Colombian government and central bank this year have
increased dollar purchases to stem a rally that sent the
currency to a 17-month intraday high on Jan. 2. Bonds and
currencies have tumbled around the world this month on
speculation a pickup in the world’s biggest economy will prompt
the  Federal Reserve  to scale back monetary stimulus. The
Colombian peso has declined 4.4 percent in May, the biggest drop
since September 2011.  “The central bank will probably extend its dollar
purchases through September,” said Brian Lesmes, an analyst at
 Bancolombia SA (BCOLO) , the nation’s biggest bank, said in a phone
interview from Bogota. He predicts Banco de la Republica will
maintain the current pace of buying at least $30 million a day.  The central bank will leave the overnight lending rate
unchanged at 3.25 percent in today’s policy meeting, according
to all 31 economists in a Bloomberg survey. Finance Minister
 Mauricio Cardenas , who is also president of the bank’s board,
said May 21 he will recommend that Banco de la Republica extend
purchases through December, buying $9 billion this year.  “Offshore investors are buying dollars” and getting out
of Colombia, said Lesmes. “You have a convergence of factors
that point to a trend for a weaker peso.” Foreign direct
investment is expanding at a slower pace, and a decline in  oil
prices  is reducing inflows into Colombia, Lesmes said.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark peso bonds due 2024
fell eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 5.69
percent. It has climbed 82 basis points in the past month, the
biggest monthly increase since the securities were sold in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
