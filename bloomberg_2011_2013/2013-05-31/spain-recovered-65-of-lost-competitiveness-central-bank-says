Spain  has regained about 65 percent
of the competitiveness it lost during the credit bubble,
according to the country’s central bank.  Unit labor costs in the Spanish private sector have fallen
by 7 percentage points since they peaked in 2009, the Madrid-based Bank of Spain said in its annual report today.  That’s two thirds of the competitiveness lost compared with
the euro region average since the beginning of monetary union.
Including public sector pay cuts, the economy has eliminated all
the accumulated losses of competitiveness, according to the
report.  Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  is counting on exports
to haul the fourth-largest economy out of a sixth year of  slump 
as the deepest budget cuts in the Iberian nation’s democratic
history have undermined domestic demand amid a 27  unemployment
rate .  “Competitiveness gains, supported by moderation in unit
labor costs, as well as Spanish companies’ greater ability to
access international markets, have turned out to be the most
solid support elements for the economy in this new phase of
recession,” the Bank of Spain said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
