James Toffey, the former chief
executive officer of bond- and derivatives-pricing service
Benchmark Solutions Inc., has joined  GFI Group Inc. (GFIG)  as global
head of electronic markets, the company said today in an e-mailed statement.  New rules requiring that swaps in the $633 trillion over-the-counter  derivatives market  be traded on regulated exchanges
or similar systems is moving more transactions to electronic
venues. GFI Group, based in New York, offers customers hybrid
trading via phone or screen-based systems and sees the move to
more computer-based executions coming, said CEO Colin Heffron.  “As things go more and more electronic, the e-markets
group is becoming a pillar on its own within our business,” he
said today in a telephone interview. “We wanted someone at the
top of that position to aggregate and execute our strategy.”  Toffey, 51, co-founded Tradeweb LLC, the bond- and
derivatives-trading network whose owners include Wall Street’s
largest banks.  GFI and Tradeweb have said they plan to register as swap
execution facilities, the trading systems created under the 2010
Dodd-Frank Act.  Bloomberg LP, the parent of  Bloomberg News , has also said
it plans to become an SEF, and could compete for trading with
those firms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
