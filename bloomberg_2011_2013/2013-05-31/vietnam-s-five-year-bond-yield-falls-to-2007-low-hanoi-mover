The yield on  Vietnam ’s five-year
government bonds fell to the lowest level since 2007 on
speculation interest rates will be cut as inflation slows.  The weekly drop in the yield was the biggest since March
after central bank Governor Nguyen Van Binh told lawmakers in
 Hanoi  yesterday that the regulator will take measures to bring
down commercial lending rates.  Consumer-price gains  slowed for a
fourth month in May, rising 6.36 percent from a year earlier.  The yield on the five-year bonds slumped 43 basis points,
or 0.43 percentage point, this week to 7.78 percent, according
to a daily fixing from lenders compiled by Bloomberg. That was
the biggest decline since the period ended March 29 and the
lowest level since August 2007. The rate on the three-year notes
dropped 46 basis points this week to 6.74 percent.  “We are constructive on Vietnam government bonds on easing
inflation and credit growth,” analysts at Standard Chartered
Plc including Hong Kong-based Betty Wang, wrote in a research
note e-mailed May 29. The central bank may cut the refinancing
rate by 50 basis points to 6.5 percent next quarter if policy
makers “remain comfortable with the inflation outlook and
credit growth stays anemic,” they wrote, adding a 7.5 percent
cap on dong deposit rates could also be reduced.  The dong fell 0.1 percent this week and was steady today at
21,013 per dollar as of 5:20 p.m. in Hanoi, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The  State Bank  of Vietnam set its  reference rate 
at 20,828, unchanged since December 2011, according to its
website. The currency is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent
on either side of the daily fixing.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
