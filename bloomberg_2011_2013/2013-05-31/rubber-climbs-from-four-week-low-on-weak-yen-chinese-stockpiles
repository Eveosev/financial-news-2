Rubber pared a fourth monthly decline
as a drop in  Japan ’s currency against the dollar raised the
appeal of the yen-based futures and stockpiles declined in China,
the largest consumer.  Rubber for delivery in November added 0.5 percent to settle
at 258.4 yen a kilogram ($2,563 a metric ton) on the Tokyo
Commodity Exchange. The most-active contract fell 1.6 percent
this month, losing 18 percent since the end of January.  The yen declined 0.6 percent to 101.28 per dollar as data
showing a decline in consumer prices added to the case for the
Bank of Japan to step up its stimulus efforts. Rubber
inventories in Qingdao, China’s main hub for the commodity, fell
to 360,000 tons from 363,300 tons on May 15, the Qingdao
International Rubber Exchange said yesterday.  “Futures drew support from the currency market and the
Chinese data,”  Kazuhiko Saito , an analyst at broker Fujitomi Co.
in Tokyo, said by phone today.  Japan’s consumer prices excluding fresh food fell 0.4
percent in April from a year earlier, the statistics bureau said
today, compared with a 0.5 percent drop the prior month. The
inflation rate hasn’t been above zero in the past year.  Thai rubber free-on-board rose 0.5 percent to 91.90 baht
($3.04) a kilogram today, the highest level since Feb. 20,
according to the Rubber Research Institute of  Thailand . Rubber
for delivery in September on the Shanghai Futures Exchange lost
0.5 percent to close at 18,740  yuan  ($3,055) a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
