China’s money-market rate climbed to
the highest level in five weeks on speculation cash supply will
decline as banks hoard funds to meet month-end  capital
requirements .  The People’s Bank of China drained a net 17 billion  yuan 
($2.8 billion) of funds from the financial system this week,
after adding 128 billion yuan last week, according to  data 
compiled by Bloomberg. A government report may show tomorrow
that the official  Purchasing Managers’ Index (CPMINDX)  dropped to 50 in
May from 50.6 the previous month, according to a Bloomberg
survey of 29 economists.  “Liquidity is very tight today,” said Wang Huane, a
senior bond trader at Qilu Bank Co. in Jinan, capital of the
eastern Shandong province. “Banks, especially the smaller ones,
are busy meeting month-end requirements.”  The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, gained 58 basis points, or 0.58 percentage
point, to 4.76 percent as of 10:02 a.m. in Shanghai, the highest
level since April 25, according to a weighted average rate
compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center.  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, climbed one
basis point to 3.31 percent, the highest since April 25,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
