Ultra-low-sulfur diesel slid to a
four-week low as a decline in U.S. consumer spending and higher
euro-area unemployment indicated less fuel demand. The crack
spread narrowed.  Futures fell 1.8 percent, capping a fourth straight monthly
drop, after a report that U.S. household purchases slid as
incomes stagnated. Euro-area jobless rates jumped to a record
12.2 percent in April. The July ULSD contract’s  crack spread

numbers, which mean less demand for diesel,” said Carl Larry,
Houston-based president of Oil Outlooks & Opinions LLC.
“Unemployment rising in the  euro zone  means we’re not going to
be pushing more diesel over to  Europe .”  ULSD for June delivery fell 5.1 cents to $2.7921 a gallon
