U.K.  government bonds  fell, with 10-year yields posting the biggest monthly increase in more than
three years, as a report showed  consumer confidence  improved
this month, weakening the case for additional monetary stimulus.  Gilts also fell with Treasuries as U.S. reports indicating
stronger growth added to evidence the economic recovery is
accelerating. A U.K. sentiment index by GfK NOP Ltd. increased
to minus 22 from minus 27 in April, the London-based group said
today. The pound rose against the euro for the first time in
three days after a report showed the jobless rate in the 17-nation currency bloc surged to a record in last month.  “While the U.K. economy is still weak, any signs of
stabilization will fuel speculation that the quantitative easing
will be on hold,” said  John Wraith , a fixed-income strategist
at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in  London . “Some improvement
in economic data in the U.K. and talk about the timing of the
 Federal Reserve  tapering stimulus have caused a sharp selloff in
U.K. gilts.”  Ten-year gilt yields rose four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 2 percent at 5:09 p.m. London time. The
1.75 percent security due September 2022 fell 0.29, or 2.90
pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,517) face amount, to 97.88. The yield
has  risen  31 basis points since April 30, the biggest increase
since December 2009.  Overseas Investors  A report from the Bank of England today showed overseas
investors sold a net 3.86 billion pounds of gilts in April, the
first net outflow in 10 months.  Business activity in the U.S. rebounded in May, with the
MNI Chicago Report’s barometer rising to 58.7 to exceed all
forecasts in a Bloomberg survey and reach the highest since
March 2012. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan final
index of sentiment increased to 84.5 in May, the strongest since
July 2007.  Policy makers have been split in recent months on whether
the economy needs further quantitative easing, with Governor
Mervyn King voting since February in the minority for more bond
purchases. The nine-member Monetary Policy Committee will keep
 quantitative easing  at 375 billion pounds, according to the
median estimate of economists in a  Bloomberg News  survey before
the June 6 decision, the last meeting before bank of Canada
Governor  Mark Carney  replaces King on July 1.  Sterling appreciated 0.2 percent to 85.47 pence per euro.
It dropped 0.4 percent to $1.5178 after rising to $1.5240, the
strongest level since May 21.  The euro-area  unemployment rate  rose to 12.2 percent from
12.1 percent in March, the European Union’s statistics office in
Luxembourg said today, in line with the median estimate of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Mortgage Lending  Sterling has fallen 2.5 percent this year, the worst
performer after the yen and Australian dollar among the 10
developed-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The U.S. currency gained 5.2 percent and the
euro strengthened 3.3 percent.  Gilts rose earlier as a report showed mortgage lending
stagnated last month, signaling that the economic recovery
remains uneven.  Lenders granted  53,710 home loans compared with a revised
53,674 in March, the  Bank of England  said today. The median
estimate of economists was for an increase to 54,600.  “The economic outlook is still not very encouraging in the
U.K. despite some improvement,” said Annalisa Piazza, a fixed-income analyst at Newedge Group in London. “Weak data from the
U.K. as well as from the  euro zone  suggests monetary policy will
stay accommodative. That and declining stocks help to support
demand for government bonds.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
