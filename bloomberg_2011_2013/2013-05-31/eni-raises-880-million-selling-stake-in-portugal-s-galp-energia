Eni SpA (ENI) , Italy’s largest oil company,
raised 678 million euros ($880 million) selling a 6.7 percent
stake in Portuguese explorer Galp Energia SGPS.  The deal, which leaves Eni with a 16 percent stake in Galp,
further bolsters the Rome-based company’s finances after the
$1.9 billion sale of a stake in pipeline operator  Snam SpA (SRG) 
earlier this month.  Eni sold 55.45 million shares at 12.22 euros each in a sale
managed by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and  Mediobanca SpA (MB) , the
company said in a statement today. The price was at the upper
end of the range of 12.02 euros to 12.22 euros set out in offer
documents, a person with knowledge of the sale said, asking not
to be identified because the details are confidential.  Chief Executive Officer  Paolo Scaroni  is selling Eni’s
stake in Galp as he cuts the company’s minority holdings. Amorim
Energia BV, a holding company controlled by Portuguese investor
 Americo Amorim , bought a 5 percent stake in Galp from Eni in
July and has the option to buy a further stake.  Eni’s current shareholdings in Galp include 8.34 percent
subject to certain rights exercizable by Amorim Energia, and 8
percent underlying about 1.03 million euros of three-year bonds
exchangeable into Galp shares, the company said.  -- Editors: Will Kennedy, Alex Devine  To contact the reporter on this story:
