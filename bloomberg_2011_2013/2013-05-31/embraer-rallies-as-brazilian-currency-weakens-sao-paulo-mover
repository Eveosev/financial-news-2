Embraer SA (EMBR3) , the Brazilian planemaker
that has led gains on the  Ibovespa (IBOV)  equity benchmark in 2013,
rose to a five-year high on speculation a weaker real will help
boost revenue.  The shares gained 2.2 percent to 19.41 reais at 1:45 p.m.
in Sao Paulo after earlier rising as much as 4.8% to the highest
price since February 2008. The Ibovespa declined 1.4 percent.
The real fell 1.4 percent to 2.1399 per dollar, the lowest since
May 2009, after Brazil’s central bank unexpectedly stepped up
the pace of increases in the benchmark  interest rate .  Because almost all of Embraer’s revenue is denominated in
dollars, it should benefit more than most Brazilian companies
from the currency’s decline, according to  Pedro Galdi , the chief
strategist at Sao Paulo-based brokerage SLW Corretora. “If this
scenario is favorable to someone, it’s to exporters,” he said
in a phone interview.  The central bank’s board voted unanimously on May 29 to
raise the target lending rate by a half-percentage point to 8
percent, surprising 38 of 57 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
who had forecast a second straight increase of 25 basis points.  Embraer has surged 35 percent this year after announcing an
agreement to sell jets worth as much as $8.3 billion in jets to
SkyWest Inc., an order of as much as $4 billion from  Republic
Airways Holdings Inc. (RJET)  and a $950 million contract with the U.S.
Air Force.  The planemaker’s revenue rose 23 percent to 12.2 billion
reais in 2012 from 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Of
that, 97 percent came from sales to other countries, according
to information posted on the company’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
