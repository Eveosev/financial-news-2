Nigeria  plans to sell inflation-linked bonds to address the concern of investors about the
impact of inflation on the domestic  debt market , the Debt
Management Office said.  “The inflation-linked bond is part of our 2013 to 2017
strategic plan,” Abraham Nwankwo, director general of the
agency known as DMO, told reporters today in the southeastern
city of Enugu. Part of the plan may be implemented this year
“where it is possible,” he said.  Africa ’s top oil producer is also planning to sell 80
billion naira ($505 million) in federal  government bonds  “in
the form of global depository receipts” and will introduce
“bond switches and securities lending” to deepen the market,
Nwankwo said.  Nigeria’s  inflation  rate accelerated to 9.1 percent in
April from 8.6 percent in the previous month, according to the
National Bureau of Statistics. The central bank has held the
benchmark  interest rate  at a record 12 percent since October
2011 to check inflation and support the country’s currency
against the dollar.  The yield on the country’s 16.39 percent domestic bonds due
January 2022 rose 45 basis points to 12. 29 percent in the
secondary market today, according data compiled on the Financial
Markets Dealers Association website. The yield on the 7 percent
domestic bonds due October 2019 rose 11 basis points to 11.80
percent, it showed.  All debt sold will be for specific infrastructure projects
and will not exceed the target ratio of 25 percent of gross
domestic product, Nwankwo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
