French consumer spending slid 0.3
percent in April, after having risen 1.3 percent in March, the
national statistics office Insee said in a statement today.  Economists had expected a decline on 0.6 percent in the
month, according to a Bloomberg survey.  Consumer spending is declining after  France  slid into
recession in the first quarter and as the country grapples with
record joblessness.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
