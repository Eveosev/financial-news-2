HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  hired a former head
of Britain’s domestic intelligence agency to help oversee its
compliance efforts after the bank was fined $1.92 billion for
failings in its money-laundering controls.  Jonathan Evans , a former director-general of MI5, will join
as a non-executive director in August, Europe’s largest bank
said in a statement today. Evans, 55, will receive 125,000
pounds ($190,100) a year in the job, HSBC said.  He will also be a member of the lender’s Financial System
Vulnerabilities Committee, a panel HSBC set up to tackle
financial crime after it reached a settlement with regulators in
December over claims that lax oversight by top executives gave
terrorists and drug cartels access to the U.S. financial system.
The group, whose members include former U.S. Deputy Attorney
General James Comey, who may be nominated by President  Barack Obama  to become the next FBI director, gives guidance on anti-money laundering controls, tax transparency, and preventing
terrorist financing.  “During his career, Sir Jonathan’s experience included
counter-espionage, protection of classified information and the
security of critical national infrastructure,” the London-based
lender said in the statement. Evans was named head of MI5 in
April 2007 and retired last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
