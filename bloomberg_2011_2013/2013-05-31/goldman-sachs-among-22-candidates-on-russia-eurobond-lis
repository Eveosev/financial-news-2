Russia  selected 22 banks as possible
organizers of its first Eurobond sale in more than a year, the
government said.  The list to manage a planned $7 billion offering has four
domestic lenders and 18 foreign banks including Goldman Sachs
Group Inc.,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , according
to a government  decree  published today and dated May 28.  The release indicates the government overcame a dispute
between the economy and finance ministries over how to pick
banks to organize the sale, which left Russia unable to tap the
market when yields fell to record lows earlier this year. The
world’s largest energy exporter sold $7 billion of bonds in
March 2012, including 30-year debt, in what was the largest
emerging-market sovereign issue since 2009.  The decree gives the  Finance Ministry  the right to select
from among the approved organizers for bond issues this year on
international  capital markets . Deputy Finance Minister Sergei Storchak said May 16 the government was considering Deutsche
Bank and  Citigroup Inc. (C) , while Sberbank CIB, VTB Capital and OAO
Gazprombank were also candidates. There will be “rotation”
from the managers picked last year, according to Storchak.  To contact the reporter on this story:
