The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds against non-payment in  Asia  fell, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index dropped 3 basis points to 92
basis points as of 9:20 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup
Inc. prices. The benchmark closed at its highest level since
April 5 yesterday and is set for an 8.5 basis-point increase in
May, its first monthly advance in eight, according to data
provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan fell 1 basis point to 111 as of 8:26
a.m. in  Singapore , Westpac Banking Corp. prices show. The
measure is set to gain 3.5 basis points this month after falling
14.8 in April, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill
Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private
market.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index was little changed at 109
as of 10:19 a.m. in Sydney, according to National Australia Bank
Ltd. prices. The gauge, which yesterday closed at its highest
level since April 23, is poised to finish the month 3.1 basis
points higher, CMA data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
