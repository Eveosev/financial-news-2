Senator  Carl Levin  and Senator John McCain said that testimony by  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  executives, including
Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook, corroborates that the company
had a special arrangement with the Irish government to cut its
tax bill.  “Most reasonable people would agree that negotiating
special tax arrangements that allow companies to pay little or
no income tax meets a common-sense definition of a tax haven.”
Levin and McCain said in a reponse to a letter from Michael Collins, Ireland’s ambassador to the U.S., released today.  Ireland provides no special tax concessions for individual
companies, Collins said, adding the companies at the center of
controversy aren’t tax resident in Ireland.  Investigations found that Apple avoided paying income taxes
on billions of dollars of profit during the past four years in
part by moving  patent rights  to a web of offshore
subsidiaries that pay virtually no income taxes. Cook said at a
conference this week that the company doesn’t use “tax
gimmicks.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
