Panels of banks setting Euribor and
Eonia rates will be separated starting next month as the group
managing the benchmarks seeks to win back lenders that departed
in the wake of scandals.  “This decision was taken in the context of the reform of
the benchmark’s governance and rate-setting process,” Euribor-EBF, the Brussels-based industry group that oversees the rates,
said in a statement on its website today. It seeks to encourage
banks to “re-join or join the respective reference rate
panels,” the group said.  Citigroup Inc.,  UBS AG (UBSN)  and Rabobank Groep are among firms
that have withdrawn their involvement with the euro interbank
offered rate, a benchmark for trillions of euros in lending, as
regulators investigated attempts to manipulate rates. Six banks
have departed from the panels setting both Euribor and Eonia
this year, leaving 36 contributors.  Euribor-EBF asked former panel banks to re-join either
Eonia or Euribor and said new European Union rules will include
the power to force banks to participate.  The  European Central Bank  said in a separate statement
today that it “welcomes the introduction of separate Eonia and
Euribor panels” and “strongly encourages banks to remain in,
join or re-join the reference rate panels in order to ensure an
appropriate level of participation.”  Eonia is a euro-area interbank overnight lending rate.  To contact the reporters on this story:
