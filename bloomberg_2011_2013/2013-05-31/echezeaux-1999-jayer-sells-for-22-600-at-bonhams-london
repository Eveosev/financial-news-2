A case of Echezeaux 1999 from
producers Henri & Georges Jayer fetched 14,950 pounds ($22,600)
at Bonhams’  London  May wine sale, beating the auction house’s
estimate amid demand for Burgundy and Rhone wines.  Six magnums of Hermitage La Chapelle 1978 Paul Jaboulet
Aine sold for 10,350 pounds, also above estimate, while a three-bottle lot of Romanee-Conti 1999 Domaine de la Romanee-Conti
went for 25,300 pounds, Bonhams said in an e-mailed statement.  The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index has risen 6 percent this
year, with an 8 percent gain in the 10 weeks to mid-March, pared
by a 2 percent decline since then. While investor demand for top
Bordeaux and Burgundy has revived since a 16-month price slide
ended in November, price cuts on Bordeaux 2012 futures over the
past two months have weighed on prices of other vintages.  “Today we have a full picture of the primeurs wine in
 Bordeaux ,” Yannick Naud, asset manager at Glendevon King Ltd.
in London, said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “We think
wines up to 10 years old for the best grand crus in Bordeaux
should go down as well to reflect what we saw.”  Demand at auction for older vintages may be benefiting from
investor reaction to the Bordeaux 2012 sales. Bonhams said some
of the strongest performers in its sale, held on May 23, “came
from outside the traditionally popular areas of the market,
Bordeaux and Burgundy.”  Three magnums of Tenuta dell’Ornellaia 1996 Masseto fetched
1,840 pounds and a case of Brunello di Montalcino Riserva 1996
Case Basse sold for 2,300 pounds, also beating estimates.  Following is a table of major wine auctions held so far
