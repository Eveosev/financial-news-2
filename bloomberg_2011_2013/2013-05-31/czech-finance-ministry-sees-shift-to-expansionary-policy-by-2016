Czech fiscal policy will shift to
expansionary by 2016, according to the  Finance Ministry , which
also sees a stable budget gap and a return to economic growth.  After the longest  recession  since records began in 1996, a
moderate revival should begin in the second quarter, the Prague-based ministry said in a fiscal outlook published today. Still,
gross domestic product will stagnate “at best” this year, it
said. The  budget deficit  will be 2.8 percent of GDP in 2013, 2.9
percent in 2014 and 2.8 percent in 2015 and 2016, it estimated.  “With this deficit trajectory, and in light of the
expected closure of the negative output gap, the restrictive
fiscal policy should transform into an expansionary policy
mainly toward the end of the fiscal outlook’s horizon,” the
ministry said.  The $217 billion  economy  has shrunk for six straight
quarters as  Europe ’s debt crisis curbed demand for exports and
households and businesses spend less amid austerity measures.
The recession has tamed inflation and pushed the central bank to
cut rates to effectively  zero , sparking a debate among policy
makers about whether to weaken the koruna with interventions.  After cutting investment and raising taxes to narrow the
 budget deficit  since taking power in 2010, Prime Minister Petr
Necas’s government agreed in April to target a wider shortfall
than initially planned in 2014, when elections are next held, to
boost growth.  The government credits its fiscal measures with helping to
cut borrowing costs to record lows, with the yield on the 10-year government bond falling to an all-time low of 1.52 percent
on May 9, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The yield has
since risen, standing at 1.706 percent today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
