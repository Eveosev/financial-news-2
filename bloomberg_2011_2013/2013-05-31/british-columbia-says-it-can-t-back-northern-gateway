British Columbia, Canada’s
westernmost province, said today it can’t support  Enbridge
Inc. (ENB) ’s Northern Gateway bitumen pipeline because project plans
fail to address the risk of spills on land or sea.  “Northern Gateway has presented little evidence about how
it will respond in the event of a spill,” Christopher Jones, a
lawyer representing the province, said today in a statement to
the federal  panel  reviewing the project.  “It is not clear from the evidence that Northern Gateway
will in fact be able to respond effectively to spills either
from the pipeline itself, or from tankers transporting diluted
bitumen,” Jones said in the statement.  Calgary-based Enbridge has proposed the C$6 billion ($5.8
billion) Northern Gateway pipeline to carry oil-sands crude from
 Alberta  to  Canada ’s Pacific Coast. Environmental and some
aboriginal groups oppose the 1,177-kilometer (731 mile) project
because of the risk of spills.  New conduits from Canada are needed to correct a “huge
disconnect” in North American oil prices as supply exceeds
pipeline capacity, Enbridge Chief Executive Al Monaco said May
21 in Toronto. Western Canada Select oil was  $19.25 a barrel
less  than benchmark West Texas Intermediate today, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Canada’s National Energy Board regulator has until the end
of the year to make a recommendation on Gateway.  To contact the reporter on this story:
