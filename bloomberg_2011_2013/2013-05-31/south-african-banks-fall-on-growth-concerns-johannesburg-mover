South African bank stocks fell to the
lowest in nearly six months on concern a slowing economy could
hamper loan repayments.  The FTSE/JSE  Africa  Banks Index dropped as much as 2.4
percent and was trading 2.2 percent weaker as of 2:06 p.m. in
Johannesburg.  FirstRand Ltd. (FSR)  led declines, falling 3.7 percent
to 28.60 rand, followed by  Capitec Bank Holdings Ltd. (CPI)  which slid
2.7 percent to 181.80 rand. The six-member index has fallen 7.7
percent this year.  Africa’s largest economy expanded at the slowest pace since
a 2009 recession in the three months through March, as growth
eased to an annualized 0.9 percent compared with 2.1 percent the
previous quarter, according to data released by  Statistics South
Africa  on May 28. That missed growth of 1.6 percent economists
were expecting, sending the rand down to a four-year low.  “Consumers will be under pressure which could impact loan
repayments,” Stephen Meintjes, head of research at stockbroker
Imara S.P. Reid in Johannesburg, said in a phone interview.
Concerns about labor unrest, foreign selling and rand weakness,
which may cause gasoline prices to rise, are also impacting
banks, he said.  Capitec, South Africa’s second-largest provider of
unsecured loans,  Nedbank Group Ltd. (NED)  and  Standard Bank Group Ltd (SBK) 
said this month bad debts are starting to rise. Stellenbosch-based Capitec also faces a regulatory fine over alleged
contraventions of credit laws, the company said in a statement
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
