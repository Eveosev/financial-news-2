Athens Water Supply & Sewage Co. SA
reported first-quarter profit of 25.7 million euros ($33.4
million), four times the 6.3 million-euro profit of a year
earlier, helped by a change in the corporate tax rate.  A statement on the website of  Greece â€™s largest water
utility also showed revenue slipped to 73.1 million euros from
76.1 million euros a year ago as the company proposed a 15 euro
cents per share dividend. The shares have risen 18 percent this
year, including as much as 3.5 percent today after the results.  To contact the reporter on this story:
