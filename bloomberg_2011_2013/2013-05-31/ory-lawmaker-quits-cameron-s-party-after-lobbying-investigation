Patrick Mercer, a lawmaker in Prime
Minister  David Cameron ’s  Conservative Party , has resigned from
the party after an investigation by the BBC’s “Panorama”
program into lobbying.  Mercer said he will stand down at the next general
election in 2015 and that he has resigned the Conservative
“whip,” meaning he is no longer part of the party in
Parliament.  “Panorama are planning to broadcast a program alleging
that I have broken parliamentary rules,” Mercer said in a
statement released to the Press Association news wire. “I am
taking legal advice about these allegations and I have referred
myself to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards. In the
meantime, to save my party embarrassment, I have resigned the
Conservative whip and have so informed Sir George Young. I have
also decided not to stand at the next general election.” Young
is the Tory chief whip in charge of enforcing party discipline.  The  BBC  said that a program about lobbying will be
broadcast “as soon as possible.” It also said that it has
approached other people involved, without specifying if they are
lawmakers.  “BBC Panorama has been investigating lobbying and the
conduct of MPs and members of the House of Lords,” the
publicly funded broadcaster said in a statement posted on its
website. “The investigation has raised a number of issues
related to those involved. Panorama has sought responses from a
number of people, including Mr. Mercer.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
