Palm oil  advanced, posting the first
monthly gain in four, on speculation that stockpiles in  Malaysia 
may decline for a fifth month as output drops in the second-largest producer.  The contract for August delivery climbed 1.1 percent to
2,397 ringgit ($775) a metric ton on the Bursa Malaysia
Derivatives in Kuala Lumpur. Futures rose 4.9 percent in May,
and touched 2,420 ringgit on May 29, the highest price since
March 28. Palm oil for  physical  delivery in June was at 2,365
ringgit, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Malaysia’s  reserves  have dropped 27 percent to 1.93 million
tons in April from a record in December, according to data from
the nation’s palm oil board. Output rose 3.1 percent to 1.37
million tons in April from the previous month, board data shows.
Exports from Malaysia dropped 3.3 percent to 1.26 million tons
in May, Intertek said today. Shipments fell 3.4 percent to 1.25
million tons, Societe Generale de Surveillance said.  “Production this month will be down, as well as exports,
so stocks are likely to be drawn down further,” said Donny Khor, deputy director of futures and commodities at RHB
Investment Bank Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur . “The further drawing down
of stocks is likely to support this market for the time being.”  Soybean oil  for July delivery climbed 0.2 percent to 48.69
cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade, while soybeans
advanced 0.9 percent to $15.09 a bushel. Refined palm oil for
September delivery closed little changed at 6,140  yuan  ($1,001)
a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange , while soybean oil also
ended little changed at 7,480 yuan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
