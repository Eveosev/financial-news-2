Two suspects who attacked U.K.
soldier Lee Rigby with a knife and meat cleaver on a busy street
in southeast  London  encouraged bystanders to watch, a detective
said.  A car swerved off the road to hit Rigby, counterterrorism
detective Grant Mallon said at a coroner’s inquest into Rigby’s
death in London today. After stabbing him, the suspects moved
his body into the middle of the road and asked people to look,
he said.  Deputy Coroner Lorna Tagliavini adjourned the hearing to
give police more time to conclude their investigation. Police
are treating the murder of Rigby in Woolwich on May 22 is as an
actor of terror.  The 25-year-old was returning to his barracks from work at
the Tower of London the day he was killed, Mallon said. The two
suspects ran at a police car and were incapacitated, he told the
coroner.  Rigby, father of a 2-year-old son, was a drummer in the 2nd
Battalion of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers. A fan of the
Manchester United soccer team, he served as a machine gunner in
Cyprus and then in 2009 as a member of a fire support group in
Helmand province,  Afghanistan .  Rigby’s family said they are grateful for the support
they’ve received in the wake of his murder, in a statement
released today by the  Ministry of Defence .  “We would like to emphasize that Lee would not want people
to use his name as an excuse to carry out attacks against
others,” the family said. “We would not wish any other
families to go through this harrowing experience.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
