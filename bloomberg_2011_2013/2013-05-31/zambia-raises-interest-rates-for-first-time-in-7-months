Zambia’s central bank increased its
benchmark interest rate for the first time in seven months to
curb accelerating inflation.  The policy rate was raised by 25 basis points to 9.5
percent, the Lusaka-based Bank of Zambia said in an e-mailed
statement today.  “The committee anticipates upward risks to inflation
during the month of June 2013, mainly arising from the recent
increase in the pump price of fuel, coupled with the lagged
effects of the recent exchange-rate depreciation,” the bank
said in an e-mailed statement.  Consumer prices in  Africa ’s biggest copper producer
accelerated for the first time this year to 7 percent in May
from a year earlier compared with 6.5 percent the previous
month, the country’s Central Statistics Office said yesterday.
The government removed fuel subsidies on May 1, increasing the
cost of gasoline and diesel by more than a fifth.  Zambia’s kwacha fell 0.4 percent to 5.35 per dollar by
12:20 p.m. in Lusaka, extending the decline this year to 3
percent.  The central bank “weighed the risks and was of the opinion
that inflationary pressures during the policy-relevant period
would be a threat to the achievement of end-year inflation
target of 6 percent,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
