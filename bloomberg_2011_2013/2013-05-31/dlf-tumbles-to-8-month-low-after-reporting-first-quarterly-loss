Shares of  DLF Ltd. (DLFU) ,  India ’s largest
property developer, fell to the lowest in more than eight months
after reporting its first quarterly loss since at least 2007.  DLF’s shares fell as much as 6 percent to 193.50 rupees in
Mumbai, the lowest since Sept. 6. They have slumped 16 percent
this year, compared with a 2.2 percent rise in the  S&P BSE
Sensex index . A change in the way the company recognizes revenue
resulted in the loss, DLF said in an exchange filing.  Sales at the company, controlled by billionaire Kushal Pal
Singh, fell for a sixth straight quarter as  Asia ’s third-largest
economy expanded less than 5 percent in the three months ended
March 31. The Gurgaon, India-based DLF  reported  a loss of 41
million rupees ($724,000) in the period compared with 2.1
billion rupee profit a year earlier.  “Till the economy gets back on a growth path, a
substantial turn around will be difficult for DLF,” Alex Mathews, head of research at Geojit BNP Paribas Financial
Services Ltd., said by phone today. “High interest costs, debt
and slow demand will be a drag on the earnings at least for
another quarter.”  The company has debt of more than 217 billion rupees as of
March 31,  filings  to exchanges shows. DLF plans to bring down
the debt to 171 billion rupees in the year ending March 2014,
DLF said in a statement.  The shares changed hands at 195.25 rupees as of 2:23 p.m.
in Mumbai.  To contact the reporter on this story:
