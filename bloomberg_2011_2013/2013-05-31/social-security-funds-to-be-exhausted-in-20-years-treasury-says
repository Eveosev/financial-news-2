The U.S. Social Security trust funds,
used to make retirement and disability payments, won’t have
enough money to pay full benefits starting in 20 years, the
Treasury Department said.  “It is projected that the combined Social Security Trust
Funds will be exhausted in 2033,” Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said in a statement today in  Washington . “Incoming revenues
will be insufficient to maintain payment of full benefits
starting in that year.”  The 2033 projection was the same as a forecast last year,
according to Lew’s statement, which was released along with a
annual report by the trustees of the Social Security and
Medicare programs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
