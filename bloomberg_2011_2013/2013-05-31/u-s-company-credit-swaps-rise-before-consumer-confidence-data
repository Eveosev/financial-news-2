A gauge of U.S. corporate credit risk
rose as investors awaited a report on  consumer confidence .  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, increased
1.5 basis points to a mid-price of 77.8 basis points at 8:20
a.m. in New York, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  Investors are weighing the strength of the economic
recovery with the  Federal Reserve â€™s commitment to continue
buying $85 billion of Treasury and mortgage debt a month to
support growth. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan final
index of U.S. consumer sentiment probably  climbed  in May to
83.7, the highest level since July 2007, according to the median
projection of economists in a Bloomberg survey. The report is
due at 9:55 a.m.  The credit-swaps index typically rises as investor
confidence deteriorates and falls as it improves. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
