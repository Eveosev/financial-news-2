Serbia ’s central bank asked banks to
lower the value of the Swiss franc in calculating mortgage
repayments over the next three years, easing a burden on
borrowers as non-payments of franc-linked debts rise.  The Narodna Banka Srbije issued a set of recommendations
asking banks to apply the exchange rate between the euro and the
franc from 2007 and 2008, calculating a maximum 8 percent
depreciation of the euro against the franc, the regulator said
on its website. Banks will keep the difference between market
and accounting rates in their books as deferred payment, to
which no interest will be applied.  The aim is to “create minimum conditions to overcome
social and life difficulties to which the users of housing loans
indexed in Swiss franc are or may be exposed” and in line with
“an effort to prevent any further increase” in problematic
loans, the bank said.  The central bank said it acted after its data showed “the
share of euro-indexed loans as of March 31, 2013, at about 3.5
percent and 11 percent for” the franc-linked ones. Banks in
Serbia stopped granting loans linked to the Swiss franc in
October 2008.  Swiss franc loans totaled 135 billion dinars ($1.55
billion), or 7 percent of their entire loan portfolio, according
to the latest available quarterly report on the banking industry
for the third quarter of 2012. Loans to households alone stood
at 88.3 billion dinars at the end of November, the central bank
said on Jan. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
