The number of U.S. households that
reported adjusted gross income over $200,000 and paid no income
taxes declined by 8 percent in 2010, according to Internal
Revenue Service data.  The IRS’s annual report on high-income, no-tax returns
today found 19,003 such returns, down from 20,752 in 2009. That
represents 0.44 percent of households with incomes over
$200,000. The IRS said 2010 was still the third-highest year on
record since the agency began compiling the data in 1977.  Such taxpayers typically use multiple tax breaks to
eliminate their U.S. tax liability, including deductible
charitable contributions and medical expenses, the report said.  These taxpayers also didn’t pay the alternative minimum
tax, which was designed to prevent high-income households from
legally escaping taxes. That tax disallows some but not all
breaks. Tax breaks for theft losses and mortgage interest, for
example, aren’t affected by the AMT.  The IRS uses multiple measures of income and tax liability
in the study. Depending on which one is used, between 0.19
percent and 0.75 percent of high-income households don’t pay
income taxes, including some who paid no income taxes anywhere
in the world.  By design, the U.S. tax code eliminates income taxes for
many low-income and middle-income households. According to the
report, among households with incomes under $50,000, 55 million,
or 59 percent, didn’t pay U.S. income taxes. Non-payers made up
41 percent of all households.  Among households with adjusted gross incomes between
$100,000 and $200,000, 0.9 percent didn’t pay U.S. income taxes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
