Singapore  Airlines Ltd.,  Southeast
Asia ’s biggest carrier, dropped to a one-month low as its $17
billion aircraft order raised concerns one of the biggest
purchases in the company’s history will crimp dividends.  Singapore Air slipped 0.9 percent to close at S$10.74, the
lowest since April 23. The benchmark Straits Times Index fell
0.7 percent. The company ordered 30 planes from Boeing Co. and
30 from Airbus SAS with an option to buy 20 more, the carrier
known as SIA said in a statement yesterday.  “The market is somewhat spooked by the size of the
order,” said K Ajith, an analyst at  UOB-Kay Hian Holdings Ltd. (UOBK) 
in Singapore. “The market is probably worried how it’s gonna be
funded and whether that would impact future dividend payout as
well.”  Chief Executive Officer Goh Choon Phong is adding more
planes and has upgraded business-class cabins as he faces
increasing competition from Emirates and other airlines
expanding in Southeast Asia. Passenger and cargo fares have
fallen, pushing the company into a wider operating loss in the
three months ended March 31, according to the company’s results
released on May 16.  Singapore Air (SIA)  had cash and near cash of about S$5 billion
($4 billion) as of March 31, compared with S$4.7 billion a year
ago, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. The company
allocated 71 percent of earnings as dividends in the year ended
March 2013, compared with 70 percent in the previous year, the
data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
