American International Group Inc. (AIG) ,
the insurer that repaid a U.S. bailout, said it hasn’t received
a deposit that was called for under its deal to sell the
International Lease Finance Corp. plane-leasing unit to a group
of Chinese Buyers.  “The deposit amount was not received by the escrow agent
when due,” New York-based AIG said today in a regulatory
filing. Jim Ankner, a spokesman for AIG, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
