 The cost to protect against a
default on bonds issued by  American International Group Inc. (AIG) ’s
plane-leasing arm rose the most in more than five months after
the insurer said it hasn’t received a deposit needed in a deal
to sell the unit to a group of Chinese investors.  Five-year credit swaps tied to International Lease Finance
Corp. rose by as much as 21.9 basis points to a mid-price of
284.8 basis points, the biggest jump since Dec. 17, according to
prices compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts traded at 278.7
basis points at 9:33 a.m. in New York, which means it would cost
the equivalent of $278,700 annually to protect $10 million of
obligations for five years.  A group led by New China Trust Co. Chairman Weng Xianding
agreed in December to buy 80 percent of Los Angeles-based ILFC
for about $4.23 billion, with an option to take a larger stake.
The deal called for the buyers to pay a 10 percent deposit, tied
to a review by regulators, and gives New York-based AIG the
right to cancel the accord if the payment is not made.  “The deposit amount was not received by the escrow agent
when due,” AIG said today in a regulatory filing.  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt.
The price of the contracts typically rises as investor
confidence deteriorates and falls as it improves.  To contact the reporter on this story:
