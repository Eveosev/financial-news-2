European stocks  fell to a four-week
low, paring a 12th consecutive month of gains for the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index, as better-than-forecast data on U.S. business
activity and  consumer confidence  bolstered speculation the
 Federal Reserve  will pare its bond purchases.  Roche Holding AG  retreated for a fifth day after its flu
medicine failed to show additional benefits when given in a
larger dose.  Telecom Italia SpA (TIT)  sank 5.8 percent after UBS AG
said the carrier’s plan to spin off its network unit may be a
lengthy process. PostNL NV climbed to a four-month high after
the Dutch mail-service company raised its profit forecast.  The Stoxx 600 declined 0.9 percent to 300.88 at the close
of trading, the lowest since May 2. The benchmark gauge posted a
0.8 percent drop this week as investors weighed the likelihood
of the Fed taking steps to reduce monetary stimulus. It has
still advanced 1.4 percent in May, completing the longest streak
of monthly gains since July 1997.  “We’re pausing for breath a bit,” said  Andrea Williams ,
who helps oversee $76 billion as head of European equities at
Royal London Asset Management. “You can’t have a straight line
up. There seems to be this fear of the Fed ending their easing,
which has spooked the markets. The market can carry on grinding
higher; it’s still cheap.”  In the U.S., the MNI Chicago Report’s business barometer, a
gauge of  business activity , rose to 58.7 in May from 49 in
April. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had forecast a reading
of 50, the dividing line between expansion and contraction.  Consumer Confidence  In a separate release, the Thomson Reuters/University of
Michigan’s  final index of U.S. consumer sentiment  climbed this
month to 84.5. That was the highest level since July 2007 and
greater than the median projection in a Bloomberg survey.  The better-than-forecast American data boosted speculation
the Fed will taper bond purchases and helped push the yield on
10-year Treasuries up 5 basis points to 2.16 percent today. The
yield has climbed 48 basis points in May, the biggest monthly
gain since December 2010.  In  China , a report tomorrow may show manufacturing
stagnated in May. A  purchasing managers’ index  compiled by the
National Bureau of Statistics and China Federation of Logistics
and Purchasing fell to 50 from 50.6 in April, according to the
median forecast of 30 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  “It’s the end of the month, so we are seeing huge bouts of
volatility,” Ishaq Siddiqi, a market strategist at ETX Capital
in London, wrote in e-mailed comments. “Chatter in the market
that China’s PMIs for May will come in weaker than expected
tomorrow also weighs on European share markets.”  FTSE Falls  National benchmark indexes fell in all of the 18 western
European markets, except  Greece . The U.K.’s  FTSE 100 (UKX)  slid 1.1
percent and  France ’s CAC 40 retreated 1.2 percent, while
 Germany ’s DAX lost 0.6 percent. The number of shares changing
hands in Stoxx 600 companies was 95 percent greater than the 30-day average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Roche slipped 1.4 percent to 239.10 Swiss francs after a
study in south-east  Asia  showed the effectiveness of its Tamiflu
drug remained unchanged when the dosage was doubled for patients
with severe influenza.  Telecom Italia tumbled 5.8 percent to 59.9 euro cents, the
biggest decline in three months. The carrier’s decision to
retain the active component of its copper network may complicate
the regulatory review, UBS wrote in a report, reiterating its
sell rating.  Analyst Downgrades  Salzgitter AG slid 5.2 percent to 29.36 euros after Nomura
Holdings Inc. cut its rating on the shares to reduce from
neutral, saying it expects increased costs at the German
company’s steel division.  Royal KPN NV lost 4.7 percent to 1.49 euros, the lowest
level since September 2001. Kepler Cheuvreux downgraded the
Dutch phone operator partly owned by  Carlos Slim ’s America Movil
SAB to reduce from hold.  A gauge of food and beverage shares was the second- worst
performer  among 19 industry groups in the Stoxx 600. Nestle SA,
the world’s biggest food company, slipped 1.9 percent to 63.45
francs and Anheuser-Busch InBev NV, the largest brewer, dropped
1.7 percent to 71.13 euros.  PostNL rallied 6.9 percent to 2.11 euros, the highest price
since Jan. 11. The company said it expects so-called underlying
operating income of 50 million euros ($65 million) to 90 million
euros in 2013, compared with a previous forecast of 20 million
euros to 60 million euros.  Deutsche Boerse AG climbed 2.2 percent to 49.79 euros after
UBS wrote in a report that the exchange will benefit from
possible changes to European Union proposals on financial-transaction taxes. European countries are planning to scale back
the taxes, Reuters reported yesterday, citing unidentified
officials.  To contact the reporter on this story:
