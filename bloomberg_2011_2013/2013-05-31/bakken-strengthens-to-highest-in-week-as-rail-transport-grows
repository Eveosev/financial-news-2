Bakken oil on the spot market
strengthened to the highest level in more than a week as
refiners and midstream companies increase the use of rail to
bring crude from the middle of the country to the coasts.  U.S. Class 1 railroads transported 97,135 carloads of
crude, or about 762,000 barrels a day, in the first quarter, the
Association of American Railroads said yesterday in a  quarterly
report . That’s up 20 percent from the previous quarter, and more
than double the first quarter of 2012.  As recently as 2008, trains moved fewer than 19,000 barrels
a day of crude.  PBF Energy Inc. (PBF)  and  Global Partners LP (GLP)  are among
companies that invested in infrastructure to move crude from
North Dakota’s Bakken shale formation, which has limited
pipeline access. The region’s oil production climbed from
113,000 barrels at the end of 2008 to 719,000 barrels in March,
according to the state’s Industrial Commission.  Bakken oil priced in Clearbrook,  Minnesota , strengthened by
$1.50 to a  discount  of $4.50 a barrel to the U.S. benchmark West
Texas Intermediate crude in Cushing,  Oklahoma , at 4:08 p.m. East
Coast time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Bakken’s  discount  to Brent, the European benchmark used to
price foreign imports to the U.S., strengthened by $1.92 to
$12.49 a barrel at 5:06 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
