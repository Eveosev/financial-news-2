U.K. mortgage approvals  were little
changed in April, highlighting the challenge policy makers face
as they try to stoke lending.  Lenders granted 53,710 home loans compared with a revised
53,674 in March, the  Bank of England  said today in London.
Economists had forecast an increase to 54,600 in April from an
initially reported 53,504, according to the median of 21
estimates in Bloomberg News survey.  House prices  had their biggest annual increase in 18 months
in May as the BOE’s Funding for Lending Scheme eased access to
mortgages,  Nationwide Building Society  said yesterday. Still,
approvals are only about half the monthly average in the decade
to 2007, when the financial crisis struck, and the central bank
has maintained monetary stimulus to cement the economic
recovery.  “House prices are likely to achieve a moderate gain of a
few percent or so over 2013, helped by modestly improved
activity,”  Howard Archer , an economist at IHS Global Insight,
said in a research note. “A decisive upward move in house
prices seems unlikely given an ongoing challenging and uncertain
economic environment.”  Separate BOE data today showed that overseas investors sold
their holdings of U.K. government bonds for the first time in 10
months in April. Non-residents sold 3.86 billion pounds ($5.9
billion) more gilts than they bought.  The pound remained lower against the dollar after the data.
It was at $1.5200 as of 9:32 a.m. London time, down 0.2 percent
from yesterday.  Mortgage Lending  Net mortgage lending rose by 875 million pounds ($1.33
billion) in April from the previous month, according to the BOE
credit data. Gross mortgage lending was 13 billion pounds, up
from 12.7 billion pounds.  U.K.  house prices  rose 1.1 percent from a year earlier in
May, according to Nationwide. They climbed 0.4 percent from the
previous month to an average 167,912 pounds.  In April, the central bank extended the FLS, designed to
provide cheaper loans to consumers and companies by lowering
banks’ funding costs, by one year to January 2015. Officials
held their bond-purchase plan at 375 billion pounds this month
and their key  interest rate  at a record low of 0.5 percent.
Their next policy decision is June 6.  Today’s BOE data showed that  consumer credit  increased by
524 million pounds in April, with credit-card lending rising 102
million pounds.  The BOE also said that U.K. M4 money supply rose 0.3
percent in April from the previous month. From a year earlier,
M4 slipped 0.1 percent.  A separate measure of M4 money-supply growth the central
bank uses to assess the effectiveness of its asset purchases
slowed to a quarterly annualized 2.8 percent from 4.7 percent,
the least since June 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
