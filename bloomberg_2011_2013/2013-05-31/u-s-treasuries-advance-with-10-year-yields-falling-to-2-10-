Treasury 10-year yields rose,
touching the biggest monthly gain since December 2010, as an
increase in  consumer confidence  bolstered speculation the
 Federal Reserve  may trim its bond-buying program with the
economy strengthening.  Treasuries  pared losses  after bankers advising the Fed said
“it is likely that current policy accommodation will continue
for one to three years,” according to minutes of the central
bank’s May 17 meeting released today in  Washington . Pacific
Investment Management Co.’s  Bill Gross , the manager of the
world’s biggest bond fund, said he likes five- to 10-year
Treasuries and there will be “no tapering for now.”  “This is actually saying the economy is expanding,” said
 Michael Franzese , senior vice president of fixed-income trading
at ED&F Man Capital Markets in New York. “It puts the Fed in
check. They are not sure what to do. Views are all over the
place, legitimately.”  Treasury 10-year  yields  rose two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 2.13 percent at 5:01 p.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The 1.75 percent note
due in May 2023 dropped 5/32 or $1.88 per $1,000 face amount, to
96 20/32. The yield reached as high as 2.21 percent.  Yield Increase  The yield gained 46 basis points since April 30, the most
since jumping 50 basis points in December 2010. U.S. government
debt securities of all maturities fell 1.8 percent in May as of
yesterday, headed for the steepest monthly loss in three years,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  “We’re on edge,” said  David Ader , head of U.S.
government-bond strategy at CRT Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,
 Connecticut . “The market has backed up accordingly and we’re
probably going to reside here as we take a look at next week’s
data.”  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators  increased 
their net-short position in 30-year bond futures in the week
ending May 28, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data. Speculative short positions, or bets prices
will fall, outnumbered long positions by 27,251 contracts on the
Chicago Board of Trade, up from 9,583 contracts a week earlier.  Investors  reversed  to a net-short position in 10-year note
futures of 35,505 contracts, the data show.  Gross Tweets  Pimco’s Gross, manager of the world’s biggest fixed-income
fund, said the federal funds rate will remain at 0.25 percent
for a “long time.” He made his comments in a Twitter post.  Gross’s Pimco Total Return Fund, declined 1.9 percent this
month, the biggest monthly loss since September 2008. The
performance of the $293 billion Total Return Fund puts it behind
94 percent of similarly managed funds through May 30, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The fund’s allocation to
Treasuries has hindered performance as government-debt
securities dropped in May.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said last week the central
bank could curtail monetary stimulus if policy makers see signs
of sustained improvement in economic growth.  That prompted a selloff that pushed 10-year yields to 2.23
percent on May 29, the highest level since April 5, 2012. Policy
makers meet next on June 18-19.  The Fed has been buying $85 billion of Treasury and
mortgage debt a month to support the economy. The central bank
purchased $5 billion of securities maturing between May 2017 and
February  2018 today, according to the New York Fed’s website.  Banker Views  “Interest rate increases could damage the current
momentum” in housing, which is “slowly recovering” amid a
rebound in prices related to low inventories, bankers advising
the Fed said in minutes. While low  interest rates  have made home
ownership more attractive to some, the panel warned record Fed
stimulus may be “perceived as integral” to housing finance.  Treasury’s $35 billion sale of two-year debt on May 28
attracted the fewest bids for the securities since February
2011. The bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by comparing
total bids with the amount of securities offered, was 3.04,
compared with an average of 3.72 for the past 10 sales.  The sale of an equal amount in five-year notes the next day
attracted the most interest from non-primary dealer investors
since at least 2003. Indirect and direct bidders combined to win
about 67 percent of the offering, compared with an average of
about 57 percent at the 10 previous auctions. The notes were
sold at what is known as a high yield of 1.045 percent, the most
for the security at an auction since October 2011.  The seven-year notes sold May 30 attracted the most
interest from non-primary dealer investors since December as
yields at 1.496 percent, the highest level at an auction in more
than a year, bolstered demand. Indirect and direct bidders
combined to win about 61 percent of the offering, compared with
an average of about 56 percent at the 10 previous auctions.  Economic Path  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan final index of
sentiment increased to 84.5 in May, the strongest since July
2007, from 76.4 a month earlier. The median forecast in a
Bloomberg survey called for the gauge to hold at its preliminary
reading of 83.7.  Treasuries earlier rose as a report showed inflation
dropped by the most in more than four years. A gauge tracked by
the Fed known as the personal consumption expenditure, or PCE,
fell by 0.3 percent last month, the biggest drop since December
2008.  The  gap  between 10-year yields on inflation-indexed
securities was close to the lowest level in 10 months.  The difference between 10-year Treasury yields and similar
maturity Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, known as the
10-year break-even rate, was at 2.19 percentage points, close to
the 2.15 percentage points reached yesterday, the lowest level
since July 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
