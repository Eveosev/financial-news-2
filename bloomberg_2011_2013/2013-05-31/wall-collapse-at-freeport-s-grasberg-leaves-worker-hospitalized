One worker was hospitalized after a
mud wall collapsed during maintenance at  Freeport-McMoRan Copper
& Gold Inc. (FCX) ’s Grasberg complex in Indonesia.  The accident happened at the Deep Ore Zone underground mine
at about 1 p.m. local time, said Daisy Primayanti, vice
president of corporate communications at PT Freeport Indonesia,
the local unit. “The condition of the worker is not yet
clear,” she said by phone from Jakarta, without providing more
information.  The accident follows a tunnel collapse at the same facility
on May 14 that killed 28 workers near the Big Gossan mine.
Grasberg in Mimika, Papua province, about 3,120 kilometers
(1,940 miles) east of Jakarta, includes underground and open-pit
operations and is the world’s second-biggest by output, Freeport
said in March.  Freeport restarted some operations at Grasberg’s open pit
mine on May 28, the company said in a statement. It expects the
mine to reach full production capacity of 140,000 metric tons of
ore a day in three to four days, Rozik B. Soetjipto, president
director at Freeport  Indonesia , told reporters on May 29.  Freeport’s workers have refused to resume work until the
company suspends officials believed to be responsible for the
May 14 accident, Virgo Solossa, head of the Mimika branch of the
All Indonesian Workers Union in the Chemical, Energy and Mining
Sectors, said yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
