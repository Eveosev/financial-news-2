Thailand ’s baht was poised for its
biggest monthly decline in a year and government bonds fell as
overseas investors reduced holdings of the nation’s debt amid
concern policy makers will stem fund inflows.  Finance Minister Kittiratt Na-Ranong said May 29 that an
amended regulation published this week in the Royal Gazette
enables the central bank to set conditions or collect fees on
funds flowing in or out of the country. Global funds were net
sellers of sovereign debt in May for the first time since
September 2011, official data show. Most Asian currencies fell
this month on speculation the Federal Reserve will trim debt
purchases that have spurred fund flows to  emerging markets .  “I am sure the Thai government is very cautious on whether
or not to use the measures, but if it’s introduced, it will hurt
investor sentiment for Thailand a lot,” said  Tsutomu Soma ,
manager of Rakuten Securities Inc.’s fixed-income business unit
in  Tokyo . “On top of that, there’s general dollar strength on
speculation about the Fed’s quantitative easing.”  The baht slumped 2.7 percent this month and 0.5 percent
this week to 30.13 per dollar as of 8:03 a.m. in Bangkok,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency rose 0.2
percent today after touching a four-month low of 30.25 yesterday.  International investors  sold  $801 million more government
debt than they bought this month after pumping a net $12 billion
into the securities in the first four months of this year, Thai
Bond Market Association data show.  Combat Volatility  The baht has advanced 1.5 percent this year, the best
performance among the 11 most-traded Asian currencies after
 China ’s  yuan . It reached 28.56 on April 22 and April 19, the
strongest level since July 1997. One-month implied volatility, a
measure of expected moves in the exchange rate used to price
options, rose 113 basis points in May to 6.58 percent. It fell
11 basis points today and 12 basis points this week.  The Bank of Thailand has prepared measures to combat
volatility in the baht, although it will refrain from using them
if they aren’t necessary, Assistant Governor Paiboon
Kittisrikangwan said May 29.  The Bank of Thailand lowered the one-day bond repurchase
rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 2.5 percent on May 29,
the first cut since October, and said it is ready to act on
monetary policy if needed.  The yield on the 3.625 percent notes due June 2023 rose 10
basis points, or 0.1 percentage point, this month to 3.51
percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The rate rose 13 basis
points this week and was little changed today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
