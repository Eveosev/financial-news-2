Mark Messier, who was team captain
the last time the New York Rangers won the  Stanley Cup  in 1994,
is interested in becoming their new coach, the  New York Daily
News reported  without saying where it got the information.  Messier, 52, a Hall of Fame player, has never coached at a
professional level, though he coached Team Canada at two
international tournaments. He has been a special assistant for
the Rangers since August 2009.  The Rangers fired coach  John Tortorella  on May 29 after the
team lost in the second round of the National Hockey League
playoffs.  Messier, a 15-time All-Star during an NHL career that
lasted from 1979-2004, helped lead the Edmonton Oilers to five
Stanley Cup titles in 1984, 1985, 1987, 1988 and 1990.  Wayne Gretzky  was on the first four of those championship teams.  Messier played with the Rangers in 1991-97 and 2000-04.  To contact the reporter on this story:
