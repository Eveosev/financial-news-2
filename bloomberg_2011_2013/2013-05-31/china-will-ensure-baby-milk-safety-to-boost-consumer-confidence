China will take measures to ensure
the safety of baby milk products and help boost  consumer
confidence  in domestic brands, the government said.  The government will draft policies to support mergers and
acquisitions among formula producers and hasten the industry’s
modernization, the State Council said in a  statement  today after 
a meeting at which Premier  Li Keqiang  presided.  Food-safety scandals in China ranging from toxic melamine
in milk powder that killed six babies, to kitchen waste
reprocessed into cooking oil and rat meat being sold as mutton
have driven consumers to buy products abroad.  Officials will tighten supervision of baby milk and start a
campaign to shut down unqualified suppliers and producers,
according to the statement. Authorities will also enhance
oversight of imported formula, the government said, without
elaborating.  The safety of baby milk affects the health of China’s youth
and the nation’s future, the government said. Quality hazards
remain and Chinese consumers’ confidence in domestic brands
“still needs to be strengthened,” it said.  China Mengniu Dairy Co. (2319) , the country’s largest dairy
producer, this month agreed to buy 26.9 percent of  China Modern
Dairy Holdings Ltd. (1117)  for HK$3.18 billion ($409 million) to gain
greater control of milk supplies amid food safety concerns.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
