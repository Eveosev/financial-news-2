Ashkenazy Acquisition Corp., owner of
 Boston ’s Faneuil Hall, bought London’s Old Spitalfields Market
from Dublin-based Ballymore Properties Ltd. for about 105
million pounds ($160 million).  The historically protected property in the City of London
financial district was put on the market last month, Ballymore
said in a statement today. The deal is London’s largest retail
investment this year, according to data compiled by Cushman &
Wakefield Inc.  The Spitalfields area, formerly a slum, has seen rising
values and renovations in the last several years because of its
proximity to the financial center, the technology hub known as
Silicon Roundabout and the nightlife of the Shoreditch
neighborhood. Old Spitalfields Market, a five-minute walk from
Liverpool Street rail station, is one of London’s top 10 visitor
attractions, according to its website.  Ashkenazy, based in  New York , also owns a stake in 650
Madison Avenue in  Manhattan , according to its website. The
 office tower , majority owned by Carlyle Group LP, is attracting
bids of as much as $1.4 billion in what may be the biggest U.S
real estate deal since 2010, two people familiar with the sale
process said this week.  Tribeca Holdings Ltd., managed by Irish investor Aidan Brooks, advised the Spitalfields buyer, two people with
knowledge of the talks said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
