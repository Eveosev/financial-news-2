Apple Inc. (AAPL)  raised the price of iPad
tablet computers and iPod music players in Japan after a weaker
yen that’s boosting importing costs prompted  Toshiba Corp. (6502)  and
 Fujitsu Ltd. (6702)  to consider increasing prices.  Apple now sells the iPad Wi-Fi model with 16 gigabytes of
memory for 49,800 yen ($493), compared with its previous price
of 42,800 yen, according to Apple’s website. The iPod Shuffle
music player costs from 4,800 yen, compared with the previous
starting price of 4,200 yen.  “We made some pricing adjustments due to changes in
foreign exchange rates,” Takashi Takabayashi, a spokesman for
Apple in Japan, said by phone today. He declined to elaborate.  The yen weakened beyond 101 against the  U.S. dollar  earlier
this month for the first time since April 2009 as Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe spearheads measures to drive down the currency and
end deflation. Fujitsu, a Tokyo-based maker of personal
computers, said this month it plans to raise domestic prices.
Toshiba said May 8 it may boost prices for televisions and PCs.  Japan’s currency fell versus all of its major peers today
as data showing a decline in consumer prices added to the case
for the  Bank of Japan  to step up its stimulus efforts. The yen
weakened 0.3 percent to 101.05 per dollar as of 9:53 a.m. in
Tokyo, trimming its weekly advance to 0.3 percent. It lost 0.3
percent to 131.83 per euro, having declined 0.7 percent since
May 24.  The nation’s consumer prices excluding fresh food fell 0.4
percent in April from a year earlier, the statistics bureau said
today, compared with a 0.5 percent drop the prior month. The
inflation rate hasn’t been above zero in the past year.  NHK, Japan’s public broadcaster, reported on the price
increase earlier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
