England  set New Zealand a victory
target of 228 in their first one-day cricket International at
Lordâ€™s in  London .  England reached 227-9 in its 50 overs as Jonathan Trott led
the way with 37 runs. James Anderson finished not out on 5 after
Graeme Swann was caught on 15 on the final ball of the innings.
Tim Southee was the leading wicket taker for the visitors,
finishing 3-37.  New Zealand, which lost the opening two-match Test series
on this tour of England, won the toss and put the hosts in to
bat.  Pace bowlers Stuart Broad and Steven Finn will miss
the first two games of the three-game series for England because
of injuries. Broad bruised his right knee in the recent Test
match against New Zealand and Finn has soreness in his shin, the
England and Wales Cricket Board said on its website.  Both players will be reassessed early next week ahead of
the final game June 5 at Trent Bridge in Nottingham.  New Zealand named seam bowler Ian Butler as the replacement
for Trent Boult, who was ruled out of the series yesterday with
a torn muscle in his side.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
