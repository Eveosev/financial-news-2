The liberalization of the cashew-industry in Guinea Bissau,  Africa ’s second-biggest grower, has
failed and caused smuggling to neighboring countries, the head
of the farmers organization said.  The government didn’t set a minimum price and the nuts are
now trading for between 125  CFA francs  ($0.25) and 150 CFA
francs per kilogram, down from as much as 400 francs a year ago,
Mama Samba Embalo, president of the National Farmers Union, said
in an interview yesterday.  Many farmers smuggle their crop to neighboring  Senegal 
where prices are between 300 and 350 CFA francs, he said.  “If the government cannot create local conditions for
farmers to sell their cashew nuts, I do not see the reason why
the farmers should be denied the choice of selling their cashew
in good prices beyond the borders,” he said. “It’s a tough
stance.”  Exports of the nuts fell to 125,000 metric tons in 2012
from 170,000 the year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
