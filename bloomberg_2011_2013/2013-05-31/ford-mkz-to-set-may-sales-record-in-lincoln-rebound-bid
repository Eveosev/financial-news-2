Ford Motor Co. (F) , selling a redesigned
Lincoln MKZ sedan to revive its luxury line, said the model will
set a May U.S. sales record that will position the brand to
match or narrowly miss its deliveries of a year earlier.  Ford will report about 3,300 MKZ sales for the month,
topping its previous best May of 3,092 in 2007,  Jim Farley ,
executive vice president of Ford global marketing and sales and
Lincoln, told reporters today on a conference call. Total
deliveries for the brand probably will be unchanged or down
slightly as the MKZ takes sales from the larger MKS, said Matt
VanDyke, Lincoln brand director.  “We’re encouraged by our MKZ sales in May, but we have a
long, long road to rebuild this brand,” said Farley, 50.  Ford is counting on the MKZ, which features push-button
shifting and an optional retractable glass roof, to revive
Lincoln into a brand that can contend with  Bayerische Motoren
Werke AG (BMW) ’s BMW and  Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Mercedes-Benz. Dearborn,
Michigan-based Ford’s luxury line posted a 24 percent plunge in
first-quarter U.S. deliveries, the most of any brand with at
least 100 sales.  Automakers including Ford report U.S. vehicle sales for May
on June 3. Ford may have led U.S. automakers with an 11 percent
increase for the month, the average estimate of 13 analysts in a
survey by  Bloomberg News .  The MKZ, which starts at  $35,925 , is the first of four new
models Lincoln has coming over four years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
