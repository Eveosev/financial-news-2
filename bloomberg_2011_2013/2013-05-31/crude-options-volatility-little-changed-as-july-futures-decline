Crude oil options volatility was
little changed as the underlying futures retreated.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
July, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 22.3 percent on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  at 2:35 p.m., versus 22.2 percent yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate crude for July delivery dropped
$1.64, or 1.8 percent, to $91.97 a barrel on the Nymex, the
lowest settlement since May 1.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
July $100 calls, which declined 6 cents to 5 cents a barrel on
volume of 3,449 contracts on the Nymex. July $86 puts were the
second-most active, rising 8 cents to 26 cents on 2,563 lots.  Puts accounted for 52 percent of electronic trading volume
today and 56 percent of the prior trading dayâ€™s volume of
135,943 contracts.  July $90 puts were the most-active options traded in the
previous session, with 12,171 contracts changing hands. They
fell 21 cents to 68 cents a barrel. September $85 puts declined
8 cents to $1.31 a barrel on 5,887 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $105 calls with
39,304 contracts. Next were September $85 puts with 38,317 lots
and July $110 calls with 35,791.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
