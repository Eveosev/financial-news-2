Electrawinds NV, a Belgian renewable-energy developer, will work with the  World Bank â€™s International
Finance Corp. to build a 180 million-euro ($234 million) wind
farm in  Kenya  as the nation adds clean power to cut oil imports.  The wind farm in Mpeketoni, southeast Kenya, will comprise
36 to 45 turbines for a total capacity of 90 megawatts,
Electrawinds said in a statement. IFC InfraVentures, a $100
million fund set up by the World Bank, will help secure finance.  The companies expect to win planning consent this year and
begin construction in 2014, Ostend-based Electrawinds said
today. Kenya is seeking to generate more of its own power to
curb imports and reduce energy shortages that hamper growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
