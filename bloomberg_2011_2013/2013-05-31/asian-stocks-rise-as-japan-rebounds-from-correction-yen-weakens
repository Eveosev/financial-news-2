Stocks slid with Treasuries and gold while the dollar rallied as better-than-forecast data on business activity and  consumer confidence  fueled speculation the  Federal Reserve  will scale back its bond purchases. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index trimmed a seventh straight monthly gain.  The  S&P 500  retreated 1.4 percent to 1,630.74, its worst drop in six weeks, and capped its first back-to-back weekly declines of the year.

The S&P GSCI gauge of 24 commodities slid for a third day, decreasing 1.1 percent as gold and oil paced losses.  Global  government bonds  were poised for the worst month since 2004 as investors weighed whether the Fed will taper asset purchases as the economy improves. Business activity in the U.S. rebounded in May, with the MNI Chicago Report’s barometer rising to 58.7 to exceed all forecasts in a Bloomberg survey and reach the highest since March 2012. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan final index of sentiment increased to 84.5 in May, the strongest since July 2007.  “This is actually saying the economy is expanding,” said  Michael Franzese , senior vice president of fixed-income trading at ED&F Man Capital Markets in  New York . “It puts the Fed in check. They are not sure what to do. Views are all over the place, legitimately.”  Bonds, Stocks  U.S. 30-year rates increased one basis points to 3.28 percent. The dollar strengthened against 14 of 16 major peers, climbing 0.4 percent to $1.2994 per euro.  U.S. government debt notes fell 1.8 percent in May as of yesterday, headed for the steepest monthly loss in three years, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Securities in its Global Broad Market Index fell 1.4 percent through May 30, poised for the steepest loss since April 2004.  In the global corporate  bond market , the biggest losses in 18 months belied a greater confidence in  credit quality . The extra yield investors demand to hold company debentures from the most creditworthy to the riskiest borrowers has narrowed 4 basis points this month through yesterday to 199 basis points, according to another index. In the U.S., the lowest-rated tier of debt is showing positive returns.  Seven Months  The  seven-month  rally in the S&P 500 is the longest stretch of gains since 2009.

Index Rebalancing  Changes by  MSCI Inc. (MSCI)  to its global and U.S. equity indexes will be implemented at the close of trading today. The process known as rebalancing can lead to swings in affected stocks. The additions and deletions of stocks to gauges such as the MSCI All-Country World Index and the MSCI World Index of developed-market equities were announced on May 15.  While yield-seeking investors drove so-called defensive stocks to among the biggest gains in the S&P 500 in the first quarter, they’ve been lagging other industries since then. Utilities, phone companies and consumer-staple companies are the worst performers among 10 groups this quarter, while financials and consumer discretionary stocks have posted the biggest gains.  Cyclicals Advised  Investors should buy inexpensive cyclical stocks that have improved balance sheets, the ability to raise dividends and earnings stability over high-yielding sectors like utility and telephone stocks that have gotten expensive, Savita Subramanian, Bank of America Corp.’s head of equity strategy, said.  JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Thomas J. Lee also wrote in a note today that the recent focus on Fed tapering may signal a shift from investors’ favoring “bond-like” equities to companies most tied to economic growth. Credit Suisse Group Inc.’s  Andrew Garthwaite  said that while cyclical companies have outperformed recently, the rally has further to go as U.S. economic momentum is still gaining strength.

Emerging Markets  The MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index fell 0.8 percent today and declined 3 percent in May, the most in a year.  India ’s Sensex slid 2.3 percent, its biggest daily slump in more than a year, after the economy grew less than 5 percent for a second quarter.

The South African rand weakened 0.5 percent to 10.908 per dollar, reaching the lowest since March 2009. It has declined for 16 of the past 17 trading days, depreciating 12 percent this month as the government struggles to resolve labor unrest that led to slower-than-forecast growth in the first quarter.
