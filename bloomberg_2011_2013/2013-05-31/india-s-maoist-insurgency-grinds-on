An outlawed revolutionary group, the Communist Party of India (Maoist), which has for  more than three decades  carried on a guerrilla war in the forests of central India, carried out a vicious strike last weekend. On the evening of May 25, a band of about 200 armed Maoists, both men and women,  ambushed a convoy  of Congress Party leaders that was on its way to a political rally in the state of Chhattisgarh. Almost the entire top rung of Congress leaders in the state was eliminated in the attack, in which 28 people were killed. Some of the victims were dragged out of their cars and shot dead at point-blank range.  The Congress, which holds power as the leading party in India's UPA coalition government but is the opposition in Chhattisgarh, was unnerved by the attack. Rahul Gandhi, the party's vice president, traveled immediately to Chhattisgarh, where he  said  that the massacre was "not an attack on Congress" but "an attack on democracy." The Maoists, meanwhile, sent a  four-page statement  signed by a top Maoist leader to the BBC, which said that the attack was "necessary revenge against the UPA's fascist Operation Green Hunt, which is being run in connivance with several state governments."   The letter-writer granted, in the cold language that characterizes violent revolutionary movements worldwide, that "some innocent people and low-level Congress workers were killed. They were not our enemies but they lost their lives. We express regret over their death and offer our condolence to the bereaved families." The Maoists, known as Naxalites, were after one target in particular: the controversial Congress leader  Mahendra Karma , whose killing was  especially brutal  (78 stab wounds were discovered on his body). Karma was the brain behind an organization fashioned to deal with the Maoist menace in Chhattisgarh: the  Salwa Judum , or "Purification Hunt" in the local tribal dialect. This civilian vigilante force, made up mainly of tribal youth, was set up in 2006 with the approval of the government of Chhattisgarh to assist the local police and Indian paramilitary forces with their counterinsurgency initiative, Operation Green Hunt. Members of the Salwa Judum were each given a gun and the status of "special police officer" by the state government, and asked to monitor other civilians. This was to invite upon the tribal peoples of the state a second rule of the gun to that imposed by the Maoists and put civilians in the crossfire. What Karma had achieved, as the Indian sociologist  Nandini Sundar , one of the  most perceptive  observers of the crisis in India's "red corridor," was essentially a situation of "my militia versus yours." As the writer  Ramachandra Guha  wrote earlier this week: In 2011, acting on a petition by Sundar and others, the Supreme Court of India  judged  the Salwa Judum to be unconstitutional and ordered the government of Chhattisgarh to disband it. By this time, however, the Judum already stood accused of several outrages. And Karma, a tribal leader who had challenged the Maoist claim over the tribals of Chhattisgarh, was already a marked man, surviving several attempts on his life. This back story explains the reluctance of the Indian press, even as it condemned the attack, to endorse the opinion of  Raman Singh , the chief minister of Chhattisgarh, who said of Karma: “He was a great fighter against Maoists. His fight will always be remembered.” In the newspaper Mint, Sudeep Chakravarti, the author of an excellent book on the Maoist movement called " Red Sun ,"  wrote : It's clear, though, that the Maoists won't be rooted out any time soon. Long accused of having  created the conditions  that enabled Maoism to flourish by its apathy and arrogance toward the region's overwhelmingly poor population, the Indian state has been working belatedly on a double-sided approach to the counterinsurgency. The UPA government has allocated  special funds  to Indian districts -- there are as many as 34 of them --  affected by left-wing extremism , even as it has sent in almost 50,000 federal paramilitary troops to assist state forces in four states as part of  Operation Green Hunt .  This project could require a few decades to take effect. Having entrenched themselves, the Maoists, who  by some estimates  number about 40,000, would now hardly be willing to give up the gains of their own " extortion economy " in mineral-rich Chhattisgarh, where several major Indian business have set up steel and power plants. The Maoist cadre unites around exercises in bloodlust, such as the  gruesome beheading  of a policeman in Jharkhand in 2009. And when the revolutionary leaders dismiss parliamentary democracy as merely imperialism by another name and seek nothing less than the overthrow of the state (anything can seem like light reading after half an hour perusing the Maoist document " Strategy & Tactics of the Indian Revolution "), it's hard to see what the government could offer them that they would find acceptable. As  Subir Bhaumik  wrote in a piece in 2010: The best books on the Maoist problem -- in particular works in the last five years by  Arundhati Roy ,  Sudeep Chakravarti  and  Satnam  -- are worth reading because they demonstrate how knotty the problem is, establish what historical and economic frames illuminate it best, and suggest what citizens can attempt to do to keep Indian democracy and the establishment honest. They give the Maoists a human face, something that the Maoists themselves have proved incapable of doing. These writers spent time in Maoist camps, and came back with stories about a cadre at once tremendously idealistic and committed, and pathetically doctrinal.  Indian democracy has many flaws. But when the reading of its failures is as uncompromising as that advanced by the "grim, military imagination" (Roy's phrase) of the Maoists, the result can only be a cycle of revolutionary violence and state reprisals, doomed to repeat itself endlessly and to take down many innocents in the crossfire.
