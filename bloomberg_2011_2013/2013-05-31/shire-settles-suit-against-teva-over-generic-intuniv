Shire Plc (SHP)  settled a patent lawsuit
against  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) , paving the way for
lower-cost generic copies of the drug Intuniv, used to treat
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.  Teva, the world’s largest generic-drug company, will get a
license to market a version of the drug, Dublin-based Shire said
today in a statement. The license takes effect once another
generic-drug maker,  Actavis Inc. (ACT) , has sold the drug for six
months starting in December 2014.  Shire sued Teva, based in Petach Tikva, Israel, in federal
court in Wilmington, Delaware, in April 2010 alleging
infringement of two patents for Intuniv. Shire previously
settled with Parsippany, New Jersey-based Actavis over the
patents. A trial of the litigation against Teva and Actavis was
held in September.  The Teva settlement couldn’t immediately be confirmed in
court papers. Shire said it submitted the agreements with Teva
and Actavis to the Federal Trade Commission for review.  Teva officials didn’t immmediately respond to an e-mail
seeking comment on Shire’s statement.  The case is Shire LLC v. Teva Pharmaceuticals USA Inc., 10-cv-00329, U.S. District Court, District of  Delaware 
(Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
