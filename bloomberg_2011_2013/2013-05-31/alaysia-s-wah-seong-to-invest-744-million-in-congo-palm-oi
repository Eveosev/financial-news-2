Wah Seong Corp. (WSC) , a Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia-based oil, gas and industrial services company, plans
to invest $744 million over the next 10 years to develop  palm
oil  plantations in Republic of Congo, said Rigobert Maboundou,
the African country’s agriculture minister.  ATAMA Plantation Sarl, a unit of Wah Seong, will initially
plant palm trees on 180,000 hectares (444,790 acres), Maboundou
told reporters in Yengo, 600 kilometers (373 miles) north of the
republic’s capital, Brazzaville.  The company will build nine plants to produce 920,000
metric tons of two different kinds of palm oil annually, said
Leong King Ming, ATAMA president. Production is due to start in
2017, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
