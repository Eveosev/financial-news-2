The plunging rand drove currency
futures trading on South Africa’s exchange to a record this
month amid bets for further depreciation.  Trading rose to 40 billion rand ($3.9 billion) this month,
the most ever, Warren Geers, the  JSE Ltd. (JSE) ’s general manager for
bonds and financial derivatives, said in an e-mailed response to
questions today. The amount this year has jumped to 133 billion
rand ($13.1 billion) from 125 billion rand for all of 2012, he
said.  The rand plummeted for a sixth day, extending the worst
retreat among 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg, sliding
17 percent this year to 10.1944 per dollar. Futures contracts
signal investors expect further declines, with generic three-month rand contracts trading at 10.4468 per dollar.  “We’re having our best year ever,” Graham Smales, the
JSE’s director for bonds and derivatives, said in an interview
yesterday. “The fundamental thing that is driving that is
currency volatility.”  South African President  Jacob Zuma  sought to calm investor
concern over falling exports from the continent’s largest
economy amid labor unrest at mines. Zuma asked Deputy President
 Kgalema Motlanthe , Finance Minister  Pravin Gordhan  and cabinet
members responsible for labor and mines to intervene in the feud
between the  National Union of Mineworkers  and the Association of
Mineworkers and Construction Union.  The rand was 1.5 percent lower against the dollar as of
2:03 p.m. in Johannesburg. JSE’s stock climbed 1.1 percent
today, extending a 3.8 percent advance this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
