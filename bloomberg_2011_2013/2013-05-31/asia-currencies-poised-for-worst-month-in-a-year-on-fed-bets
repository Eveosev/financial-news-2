Asian currencies had their biggest
monthly decline in a year as investors pulled money from
regional assets after the  Federal Reserve  said it could taper
its stimulus if the  U.S. economy  shows sustained improvement.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index dropped by the
most since May 2012 as U.S.  consumer confidence  rose to a five-year high. Foreign funds were net sellers of stocks in
Indonesia,  Taiwan , Thailand and the  Philippines  this week after
a report indicated Chinese manufacturing shrank in May. Global
investors pulled $224 million from emerging-market bond funds in
the week through May 29, Morgan Stanley said in a report, citing
data published by EPFR Global.  “The Fed could actually tighten as the recovery in the
U.S. is looking good and sustainable,” said Suresh Kumar Ramanathan, a currency strategist at CIMB Investment Bank Bhd.
in  Kuala Lumpur . “The sentiment is shifting in favor of the
dollar and local bonds got sold off.”  India’s rupee slumped 4.8 percent to 56.5050 per dollar
from April 30, touching an 11-month low yesterday, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Thailand’s baht fell 3.2 percent to
30.31 and the Philippine peso declined 2.6 percent to 42.263,
reaching an 11-month low on May 30. The Asia Dollar Index
dropped 1.3 percent to 116.78.  Rate Cuts  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of shares has lost 5.8 percent
since May 22, the day Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the
monetary authority could reduce its $85 billion a month of bond
buying. The weekly outflow from emerging-market debt funds was
the first in almost a year, the EPFR Global data shows.  Asian policy makers made efforts to shore up growth in May,
with  South Korea  and Thailand cutting their benchmark  interest
rates  by 25 basis points to 2.5 percent. Taiwan’s government
announced stimulus measures to boost domestic demand to counter
a slowdown in exports.  The rupee declined the most since May 2012 after central
bank Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said retail inflation was still
high and the nation’s balance of payments is under stress. The
economy grew 4.8 percent in the first quarter, the government
said yesterday, matching the median forecast in a Bloomberg
survey.  The baht slumped for a sixth straight week on concern
policy makers will stem inflows. Finance Minister Kittiratt Na-Ranong said May 29 that an amended regulation will allow the
central bank to set conditions or collect fees on money coming
in or out of the country.  Thai Measures  Overseas investors sold $801 million more Thai government
debt than they bought in May after pumping a net $12 billion
into the securities in the first four months of this year, Thai
Bond Market Association data show.  “I am sure the Thai government is very cautious on whether
or not to use the measures,” said  Tsutomu Soma , manager of
Rakuten Securities Inc.’s fixed-income business unit in Tokyo.
“If it’s introduced, it will hurt investor sentiment for
Thailand a lot.”  Elsewhere, South Korea’s won fell 2.5 percent to 1,129.64
