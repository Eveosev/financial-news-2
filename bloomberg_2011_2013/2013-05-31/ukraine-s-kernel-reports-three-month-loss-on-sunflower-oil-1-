Kernel Holding SA reported a net loss
of $3.4 million in the third quarter of the Ukrainian company’s
fiscal year as most bulk sunflower oil contracts were signed
with delivery scheduled for the following quarter.  The Kiev-based company’s loss attributable to shareholders
in the quarter ending March 31 compares with a net income of
$37.2 million a year earlier, Kernel said in a report published
today. The fiscal year ends at the end of June. The shares fell
at 10:44 a.m. in Warsaw to 56.34 zloty today from 59.8 zloty on
May 29. The stock market was closed yesterday.  Bulk sunflower oil sales dropped 22.5 percent to 173,976
tons, while grain sales fell 21.4 percent to 653,745 tons,
though that was compensated by higher grain prices.  Higher taxation, smaller margins in the bulk oil and grain
segment and an acquisition also contributed to the profit
decline, Kernel said. Income tax expenses soared to $5.3
million.  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization declined 30 percent to $43.8 million. Revenue was
almost unchanged at $597.9 million.  Kernel sees its Ebitda by the end of the fiscal year at
$310 million, according to the statement. The company said on
April 18 that year-end Ebitda would be “moderately below” $350
million. Kernel gave no profit or revenue forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
