Canada’s fiscal results are “in
line” with the government’s C$25.9 billion ($25 billion)
deficit target for the previous fiscal year, the finance
department said today.  While data released for the 12 months through March 31 show
the nation’s deficit fell to C$18.3 billion from C$21.6 billion,
the results aren’t final, the department said in an e-mailed
statement. Adjustments reflecting tax return assessments and
changes in asset valuations will be made “once further
information becomes available,” it said.  Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  released a fiscal plan on
March 21 that projected the deficit for the fiscal year that
began April 1, 2012 would fall to C$25.9 billion from C$26.2
billion in the previous fiscal year.  Today’s report showed the  budget deficit  for March narrowed
to C$6.51 billion from C$8.96 billion a year earlier. March
revenue dropped 4.8 percent on lower receipts from personal
income taxes. Total expenses fell 10.8 percent in March from the
year before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
