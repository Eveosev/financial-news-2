Italy’s jobless rate reached a 36-year high in April as companies didn’t hire staff amid pessimism
about the outlook of an economy that’s probably in its eighth
quarter of recession.  Joblessness (ITMUURS)  rose to 12 percent after the March reading was
revised up to 11.9 percent from an initial 11.5 percent, the
Rome-based national statistics office Istat said in a
preliminary report today. The April rate was higher than the
11.6 percent median of seven estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey. Unemployment remained above 10 percent for a 15th month
and reached the highest since the data series began in the first
quarter of 1977.  Europe ’s fourth-biggest economy will contract 1.8 percent
in 2013 as weak household demand extends the longest recession
in over two decades, the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development said this week. “Employment and hours worked
will continue to fall, constraining household budgets and
consumption spending,” the Paris-based OECD said.  Italy’s new Prime Minister Enrico Letta told Italian
lawmakers last month that employment will be the “top
priority” of his government. In a May 25 letter to European
President  Herman Van Rompuy , Letta demanded that measures to
boost employment be discussed at the European Council on June
27-28.  The  unemployment rate  for people between the age of 15 and
24 rose to 40.5 percent in April, the highest since the data
series began in 1966, Istat said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
