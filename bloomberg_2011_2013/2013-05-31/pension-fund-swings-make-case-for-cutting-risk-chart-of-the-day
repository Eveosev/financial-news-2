Companies offering pension plans in
the U.S. are increasingly seeking to reduce the risk of failing
to meet their obligations, according to Erin Lyons, a Citigroup
Inc. strategist.  As the CHART OF THE DAY illustrates, swings in pension-fund
returns may give them an incentive to act. The chart tracks the
iBoxx U.S. Pension Index, designed to mirror the performance of
a typical plan with defined benefits.  The index had a 6.1 percent loss for the year as of two
days ago, when Lyons wrote her report. The decline followed a
0.2 percent gain for all of last year -- and a 31 percent surge
the year before.  Volatility in funds’ asset value and relatively low
 interest rates  “have made managing pensions increasingly
difficult,” the New York-based strategist wrote. “Corporate
managers are evaluating whether or not they want to be in the
asset-management business.”  One possibility is switching to defined-contribution
programs, especially 401(k) plans, the report said. Another is
shifting into bonds and away from stocks.  Ford Motor Co. (F)  will
“walk toward” raising fixed-income investments to 80 percent
of pension assets from 55 percent at the end of last year,
Treasurer Neil Schloss said in March.  Ford and  General Motors Co. (GM)  offered pension buyouts to
retirees last year, and Lyons cited the lump-sum payments as a
third option for “de-risking.” GM also used a fourth approach,
transferring obligations to an insurance company through the
purchase of a group annuity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
