Protesters blocked the entrance to
the  European Central Bank  in  Frankfurt , saying the ECB’s policy
choices during the euro-area debt crisis shored up big banks
while impoverishing citizens.  Organizers of the Blockupy movement said the number of
demonstrators on site today already exceeded the 3,000 who took
part in last year’s event, among them protesters from  Italy ,
Spain,  France  and other European countries. Frankfurt police put
the number at about 1,500 demonstrators.  Employees were prevented from entering the ECB building in
the city center, Ani Diesselmann, a Blockupy spokeswoman, said
in a telephone interview. “We will stay here until the largest
flow of staff is over,” she said. Some ECB staff did manage to
slip through, she said. The ECB said it would continue
operations as normal today.  The protests, which took place amid rain, were peaceful
with the exception of a few demonstrators who tried to break
through the crash barriers placed in front of the ECB tower,
police spokesman Max Weiss said. As many as 300 people gathered
outside the ECB while about 80 people demonstrated in front of
the nearby  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  headquarters, which were shielded by
about 50 police vehicles. The protesters had left by midday.  Blockupy plans a demonstration at Frankfurt airport against
German immigration policies at about 1 p.m. local time. Fraport,
the airport operator, is advising passengers to arrive early for
flights.  To contact the reporter on this story:
