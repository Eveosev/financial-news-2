Iran , holder of the world’s fourth-biggest proven crude reserves, is exporting more oil products as
western sanctions reduce the amount of crude it ships overseas,
the country’s oil minister said.  Iranian crude exports have fallen by about 20 percent and
most of the volumes have been replaced by products, Oil Minister
Rostam Qasemi told reporters today in Vienna, where the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is meeting to
determining production policy. He didn’t specify a timeframe for
the decline in shipments.  “Part of our oil exports have been transformed into oil
products,” Qasemi said. “There are many customers for oil
products. We used to import gasoline and now we are exporters.”  Iran is under U.S. and European Union sanctions intended to
halt its nuclear program, which they say is aimed at producing
atomic weapons, while the government in Tehran says the project
is for civilian purposes. The restrictions have curbed oil
exports and complicated the Islamic republic’s repatriation of
cash from crude sales.  Shipments from Iran are insured by the government as well
as by the authorities of its customers, including  China ,  Korea ,
 India  and  Japan , Qasemi said.  The EU sanctions introduced last year barred 95 percent of
the global fleet from conducting business in Iran because
London-based underwriters arrange most of the insurance.  To contact the reporters on this story:
