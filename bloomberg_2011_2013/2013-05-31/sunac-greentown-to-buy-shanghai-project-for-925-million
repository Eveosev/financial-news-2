Greentown China Holdings Ltd. (3900)  and
 Sunac China Holdings Ltd. (1918) , both Hong Kong-listed developers of
land in China, said they will jointly buy a property project in
Shanghai for 5.68 billion  yuan  ($925 million).  Sunac Greentown Investment Holdings Ltd., a 50-50 venture
between the companies, will also assume 2.32 billion yuan of
debt, according to a Hong Kong stock exchange filing yesterday.  The purchase gives the developers, which have been
cooperating in Shanghai since June 2012, a site with a view of
the Huangpu river, a “rarity,” according to the statement. In
March, the companies announced a framework agreement for the
purchase at a total consideration of 9.02 billion yuan,
according to a joint statement at the time.  The project, in the city’s Huangpu district, will have a
total of 674,564 square meters (7.3 million square feet)  of
floor area, including apartments, offices, commercial space and
parking, the companies said. Of this, 207,937 square meters are
complete and the balance is under construction, they said.  The seller of the project is Arch Capital Success Ltd.,
Sunac and Greentown said in the filing. Greentown is based in
Hong Kong and Sunac in Tianjin, China.  To contact the reporter on this story:
