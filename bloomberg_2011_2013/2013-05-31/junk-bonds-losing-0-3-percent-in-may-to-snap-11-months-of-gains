Junk bonds are headed for their first
monthly loss in a year as dealers take on more of the debt amid
rising yields and a record pace of issuance.  Dollar-denominated speculative-grade bonds have declined
0.3 percent in May after returning 15.4 percent the previous 11
months, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data.
The 21 primary dealers that do business with the Federal Reserve
boosted  positions  in the debt by $2.7 billion in the three weeks
ended May 22 to $8.35 billion, Fed data show, as companies sold
$44.1 billion of the debt, an unprecedented pace for the period.  The losses are prompting a pullback by investors from funds
that buy junk debt. High-yield funds in the U.S. reported $875
million of withdrawals this week, the biggest outflow since
February, according to Lipper Data, as concern mounts that
rising interest rates will eat into the notes’ value. Yields on
10-year U.S. Treasuries have climbed 0.49 percentage point in
May to 2.159 percent at 11:03 a.m. in New York, the biggest
monthly increase since December 2010.  “Risk assets remained volatile, driven by the selloff in
Treasuries,”  Barclays Plc (BARC)  strategists Jeffrey Meli and Bradley Rogoff wrote in a report today.  While the extra yield the debt pays over government bonds
typically cushions bondholders from losses resulting from rising
benchmark borrowing costs, a 129-percent rally since 2008 has
shrunk spreads by 1,389 basis points to 423 basis points on May
9, the lowest since October 2007, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
index data show.  Record Issuance  High-yield, high-risk bonds, graded below Baa3 by Moody’s
Investors Service and lower than BBB- at Standard & Poor’s, have
lost 0.5 percent since May 28, when 10-year Treasury yields
reached 2.17 percent, the highest level since April 2012.  Primary dealers led by  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and  Bank of
America Corp. (BAC)  boosted their exposure to speculative-grade notes
by $630 million in the week ended May 22 following a $1.37
billion increase in net assets the week before, Fed data show.  Companies have sold $192.9 billion of the debt in the U.S.
this year, more than the $140.7 billion sold by this time in
2012, when an unprecedented $358.5 billion of junk debt was
issued.  While the notes declined this week, “high yield is better
positioned to absorb a rate increase as long as it is
accompanied by at least a moderately improving macroeconomic
environment,” the Barclays analysts said in the report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
