Office Depot Inc. (ODP)  has completed talks
with Grupo Gigante SAB and next week will disclose the
definitive terms for selling its Mexican business to the joint-venture partner.  The announcement of a sale assumes consent by  OfficeMax
Inc. (OMX) , and there are no assurances that a sale will occur, the
Boca Raton, Florida-based company said today in a filing with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Earlier this month,
Office Depot said it received agreement from Naperville,
Illinois-based OfficeMax to proceed with the Gigante
negotiations. Office Depot is seeking to buy OfficeMax.  Gigante, which already owns half of Office Depot de  Mexico ,
has lined up financing and received indications from Office
Depot that its February offer to buy the rest for $700 million
will be accepted, a person with knowledge of the matter said
this month. Office Depot is considering the sale amid pressure
from its largest shareholder, Starboard Value LP, to cut costs
and improve operations.  Office Depot rose 1.6 percent to $4.41 at the close in New
York. The shares have gained 34 percent this year, while the
Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index has increased 14 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
