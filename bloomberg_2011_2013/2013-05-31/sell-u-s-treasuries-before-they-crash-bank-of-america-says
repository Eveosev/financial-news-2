Investors should sell U.S Treasuries
and buy bank stocks because bonds may be headed for a “crash,”
according to Bank of America Corp.  “It’s hard to believe that the greatest bond bull market
in history will end without some bloodshed,” Michael Hartnett,
the bank’s chief investment strategist, wrote in a client note
yesterday. “Risks of a bond crash are high.”  Markets are getting nervous about the possibility the
Federal Reserve will taper its debt-buying program, according to
Hartnett, who is based in New York. Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke
said week last the central bank could curtail its $85 billion in
monthly Treasury and mortgage bond purchases if policy makers
are confident that improvements in economic growth are
sustainable.  U.S. debt has dropped 1.8 percent in May, the steepest
monthly loss since December 2009, according to the bank’s
indexes. Benchmark 10-year yields declined from 15.8 percent in
September 1981 to a record low of 1.38 percent in July last
year. The move resulted in a gain of more than 1,000 percent for
the bank’s Treasuries index.  The  yield  on 10-year Treasury dropped two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 2.09 percent as of 8:46 a.m. in
 London , according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The price of
the 1.75 percent note due in May 2023 rose 6/32, or $1.88 per
$1,000 face amount, to 96 31/32. The yield reached 2.23 percent
on May 29, the highest level since April 5, 2012.  “Major breakouts in equity markets tend to coincide with
major inflection points in bond yields,” Hartnett wrote. The
 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  has climbed 16 percent this year,
and it set an all-time high of 1,687.18 on May 22.  Bank of America’s bond strategists predict the 10-year
yield will rise to 2.25 percent by year-end, according to the
report. The company’s economists forecast the Fed will begin
paring its bond purchases in April, it said.  The bank is bullish on U.S, European and Japanese banks,
along with equities from  emerging markets  such as  Brazil , China,
 India ,  Turkey  and  Russia , according to the report. It is
negative on emerging market bonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
