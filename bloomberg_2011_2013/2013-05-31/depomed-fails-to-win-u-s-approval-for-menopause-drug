Depomed Inc. (DEPO)  failed to win U.S.
approval for a drug to ease hot flashes associated with
menopause that regulatory advisers had said was too risky to
clear for sale.  The  Food and Drug Administration  can’t approve the
application in its present form, the Newark, California-based
company said in a statement today. Depomed, which already sells
gabapentin as a treatment called Gralise for pain associated
with shingles, reiterated that it won’t further invest in plans
to expand the drug to be used for menopausal hot flashes.  The drug would have been a non-hormonal alternative to
existing medicines found to increase the risk of heart attack,
 breast cancer  and stroke. However, advisers to the FDA voted
March 4 that the risks of gabapentin outweighed the benefits.
The panel reached the same conclusion about another treatment to
ease hot flashes from  Hisamitsu Pharmaceutical Co. (4530)   Depomed said then it would stop spending on the drug’s
development as a hot flash treatment.  Clinical trials struggled to show gabapentin had an effect
up to 12 and 24 weeks out, FDA staff said in a February staff
report. The treatment also carries a risk of suicidal thoughts
as indicated on the labels of other drugs with the same active
ingredient including Gralise and anti-seizure medications.  To contact the reporter on this story:
