Santos Ltd. (STO) , Australia’s third-biggest oil producer, expects to reach agreement with  BG Group
Plc (BG/)  to connect their pipelines, bolstering the supply of gas for
its $18.5 billion Gladstone project in Queensland state.  Linking their pipelines on the Queensland mainland and on
Curtis Island, where coal-seam gas will be converted into liquid
form, would allow the Santos and BG projects to swap gas, Rod Duke, downstream vice president for the Gladstone development,
told reporters today on Curtis Island.  The proposed arrangement “allows for the sensible and
commercial exchange of gas,” Duke said. It would also
“facilitate ongoing cooperation in the future,” he said.  Santos, BG and a ConocoPhillips- Origin Energy Ltd. (ORG)  venture
are building three developments in Queensland at a cost of more
than $60 billion to tap rising Asian demand for liquefied
natural gas.  The arrangement with BG is an important step and would
provide more certainty for gas supply to the Santos project,
which is scheduled to start in 2015, said Nik Burns, a
Melbourne-based analyst at UBS AG, who traveled to  Curtis Island 
with Santos last week.  Santos is “close to finalizing arrangements” on
exchanging gas with the Australian unit of London-listed BG,
Duke told reporters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
