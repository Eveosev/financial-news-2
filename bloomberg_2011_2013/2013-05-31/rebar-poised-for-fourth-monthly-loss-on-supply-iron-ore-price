Steel reinforcement-bar futures
headed for a fourth monthly drop as  iron ore  fell to the lowest
in more than seven months and supply from Chinese mills climbed.  Rebar for delivery in October on the  Shanghai  Futures
Exchange declined as much as 0.4 percent to 3,424 yuan ($558) a
metric ton and was at 3,433 yuan at 10:15 a.m. local time.
Futures retreated 4.6 percent in May.  Iron ore for immediate delivery at the Tianjin port in
China fell 1.2 percent to $111.60 a dry ton yesterday, the
lowest since October, according to the Steel Index Ltd. China’s
steel output rose by 20.09 million tons in the first four months
of this year, Wang Xiaoqi, deputy head of the China Iron and
Steel Association, said at a conference in Shanghai this week.
About 54 percent of the additional output is sitting in
warehouses, Wang said.  “High capacity, high output and lower raw-material prices
are all pressuring rebar,” Wang Yongliang, an analyst at
Beijing CIFCO Futures Co., said in a report today.  The average  spot price  for rebar fell 0.3 percent to 3,483
 yuan  a ton yesterday, the lowest since September, according to
data from Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
