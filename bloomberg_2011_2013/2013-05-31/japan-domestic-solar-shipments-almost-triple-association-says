Domestic shipments of solar cells and
modules in  Japan  leapt by their most in at least 30 years last
fiscal year as government efforts to spur clean energy after the
2011 Fukushima disaster began to pay off.  Local shipments rose to 3,809 megawatts in the 12 months
ended March 31 from 1,404 megawatts the previous year, the  Japan
Photovoltaic Energy Association  said today on its website. The
increase was the largest since 1981 when the figures were
compiled for the first time.  The data underscore the popularity of solar in Japan as
pressures mount to boost energy supplies after the Fukushima
Dai-Ichi accident led to the shutdown of almost all the nation’s
nuclear reactors. Japan started offering above-market rates in
July for renewable sources such as solar and wind.  The incentives, also known as feed-in tariffs, are boosting
applications for solar installations across the country. The
Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry approved 12,258
megawatts worth of solar projects -- both residential and non-residential -- by the end of February. That accounts for 94
percent of all applications for clean energy tariffs since the
program started.  Approved solar projects are the equal to almost half of
Japan’s installed capacity of clean energy at the end of 2012,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  Japan’s tariff for solar, reduced in April to 37.8 yen
(37.5 cents) per kilowatt hour from 42 yen, is still more than
twice those of  China  and Germany, at 1  yuan  (16 cents) per
kilowatt hour and 0.1082 euro (14 cents) per kilowatt hour,
respectively.  Market Size  While Japan’s solar installations are forecast to lag
China’s this year, the country is set to become the largest
market in terms of revenue, researcher  IHS Inc. (IHS)  said in a
statement on May 29.  “Japan is forecast to install $20 billion worth of PV
systems in 2013, up 82 percent from $11 billion in 2012,” IHS
said. “In contrast, the global market is set for tepid 4
percent growth. The strong revenue performance for Japan this
year is party driven by the high solar prices in the country.”  The world’s third-largest economy had cumulative solar
capacity of 7,429 megawatts, compared with 32,192 megawatts in
 Germany , 8,069 megawatts in the U.S. and 6,539 megawatts in
China in 2012, according to London-based BNEF.  Imports made up 40 percent of Japan’s domestic shipments of
cells and modules in fiscal 2012, data from the Japanese solar
group showed.  Imports Increase  Imported solar products accounted for 0.1 percent of all
domestic shipments in fiscal 2008 before jumping to 11.3 percent
the following year, according to the group. In fiscal 2010 and
2011, imports totaled 15.8 percent and 21.5 percent of shipments
respectively. Imports include products made overseas by Japanese
solar panel makers.  Imported modules made by non-Japanese companies totaled 869
megawatts, accounting for 22.8 percent of all modules shipped in
Japan in fiscal 2012, the association said.  Exports of cells and modules fell to 562 megawatts from
1,281 megawatts, according to the statement.  For the three months to March 31, domestic shipments rose
to 1,734 megawatts, more than four times the 392 megawatts
shipped in the same quarter a year ago, according to the group.
Exports for the quarter fell to 130 megawatts from 163
megawatts.  The data was compiled from 34 companies including  Sharp
Corp. (6753)  and Suntech Power Japan Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
