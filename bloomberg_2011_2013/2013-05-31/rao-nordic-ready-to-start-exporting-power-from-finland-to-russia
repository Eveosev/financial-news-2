Rao Nordic Oy, the Helsinki-based
power trading company, will be ready to start selling
electricity from Finland to  Russia  for the first time next year.  The unit of Russia’s  OAO Inter Rao UES (IRAO)  will be ready as
soon as grid operators in both countries implement the necessary
rules, Marja Rasi-Kurronen, head of cross-border trading at Rao
Nordic said today at a seminar in  Stockholm .  Finland imports as much as 10 percent of its power from
Russia to supply the Nordic nation’s energy-intensive
industries, according to  data  by grid operator Fingrid Oyj.
Technical restrictions had prevented exports to Russia, meaning
traders were unable to respond to higher prices in the eastern
European nation.  “It will not be easy to get the Russian and Finnish power
markets to interact,” Rasi-Kurronen said. Power traders in the
EU generally don’t trade capacity, whereas they do in Russia,
she said.  Furthermore, most EU countries have a single cost of
electricity while Russia is split into roughly 8,000 separate
price regions, she said.  Starting next year,  Finland  will be able to initially sell
350 megawatts to Russia, and later as much as 800 megawatts,
according to Fingrid, which manages the Finnish power links to
Russia.  Rao Nordic imports electricity from Russia and sells it to
countries including Finland,  Lithuania , Belarus, Georgia,
Kazakhstan and China, according to its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
