Spot wholesale electricity prices
gained from  Maine  to North Carolina as unusually hot and humid
weather spurred demand for power to cool homes and offices.  Temperatures in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic states will
be above-normal over the next two days, said WSI Corp. in
Andover,  Massachusetts . The high in Washington today may be 91
degrees Fahrenheit (33 Celsius), 11 higher than the usual
reading, and Boston may be 21 above normal at 92 degrees,
according to AccuWeather Inc. in State College, Pennsylvania.  On-peak power for PJM Interconnection LLC’s benchmark
 Western hub  rose $4.93, or 8.2 percent, to $65.40 a megawatt-hour at 2:14 p.m. from yesterday’s full-day average, data from
the grid operator show. On-peak hours run from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m.
The PJM market spans 13 states from New Jersey to North Carolina
and  Illinois .  New England prices rose $7.20, or 13 percent, to $62.82 a
megawatt-hour from yesterday’s on-peak average while New York
City increased $5.98, or 10 percent, to $63.07 a megawatt-hour,
according to data from the grid managers.  ISO New England Inc. issued a system alert for a second day
for Rhode Island and southeastern Massachusetts as seasonal
maintenance limits supply, according to the grid operator’s
 website .  Peak power demand  on the six-state grid from
 Connecticut  to Maine will be 22,000 megawatts, 9.2 percent,
higher than yesterday’s high.  PJM and the New York Independent System Operator Inc. also
predicted higher demand on their grids.  California on-peak power so far today is trending higher
versus the same hours yesterday amid higher demand, grid data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Texas  and Midwest prices are headed
lower.  To contact the reporter on this story:
