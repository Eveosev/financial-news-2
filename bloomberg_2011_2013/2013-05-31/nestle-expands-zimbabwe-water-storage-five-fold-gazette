Nestle SA (NESN) â€™s Zimbabwe unit will
increase its water-storage capacity five-fold this year, the
Harare-based Financial Gazette  said , citing company spokesman
Farai Munetsi.  The company will spend $14 million boosting the size of its
water storage with an underground tank as well as on an office,
laboratory and upgrades to cereal and drink plants, the weekly
Financial Gazette said on its website.  Erratic water supply from Harare, whose mayor said the
capital needs $2.5 billion to repair pumping, purification and
piping infrastructure according to the Herald, means most
businesses and many private households store water on their
premises.  To contact the reporter on this story:
