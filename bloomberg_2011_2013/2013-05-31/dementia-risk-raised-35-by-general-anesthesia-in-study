Older people who undergo general
anesthesia for major surgery have a 35 percent higher risk of
developing dementia later in life, according to a French study.  The findings are based on information from the  Three-City
Study , which included thousands of people age 65 and older in
Bordeaux, Dijon and Montpellier starting in 1999. In a
subpopulation of 7,008 citizens, 632 participants developed
dementia over the course of the study, and those patients were
more likely to have had general anesthesia than those who didn’t
develop mental deterioration.  The findings support a theory that post-operative cognitive
dysfunction, a common complication in elderly patients in which
their thinking and memory is temporarily impaired, is associated
with a higher risk of developing dementia. Previous research has
suggested that some anesthetics may prompt inflammation of
neural tissues, leading to early signs of Alzheimer’s disease
including amyloid plaques and protein tangles in the brain.  “Recognition of post-operative cognitive dysfunction is
essential in the perioperative management of elderly patients,”
Francois Sztark, the lead researcher and an anesthesiologist at
the  University of Bordeaux , said in a statement. “A long-term
follow-up of these patients should be planned.”  The study results will be presented at the annual meeting
of the  European Society of Anaesthesiology , which begins today
in Barcelona.  To contact the reporter on this story:
