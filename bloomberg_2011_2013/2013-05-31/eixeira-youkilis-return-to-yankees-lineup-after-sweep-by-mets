Mark Teixeira  and  Kevin Youkilis  will
return to the New York Yankees’ lineup tonight against the
Boston Red Sox as the Yankees try to rebound from a four-game
sweep by the crosstown Mets.  Youkilis will be the designated hitter and bat second,
while first baseman Teixeira will bat fourth, the team said on
Twitter. Pitchers Ivan Nova and Vidal Nuno were demoted to
Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre to make room on the Yankees’
roster.  Teixeira hasn’t played this season after partially tearing
a tendon sheath in his right wrist in March. Youkilis went on
the disabled list April 30 with a back sprain.  New York (30-23) opens the three-game series at Yankee
Stadium trailing the Red Sox (33-22) by two games in the
American League East.  To contact the reporter on this story:
