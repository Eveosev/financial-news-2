Newly promoted French soccer club AS
Monaco signed Atletico Madrid striker Radamel Falcao to a five-year contract, the team said on its  website .  Falcao, 27, has scored 70 goals in two seasons with
Atletico, helping the team win the Europa League in 2012 and
this season’s Copa del Rey. The Colombian twice was the Europa
League’s top scorer, including a record 17 goals in helping
Portuguese club Porto to the title in 2011.  “We are absolutely delighted that Radamel Falcao has
accepted the challenge of coming to play for AS Monaco FC,”
Dmitry Rybolovev, the club’s Russian billionaire owner and
president, said on the team’s website. “We are proud to have
secured one of the best players in the world and confident that
he will help ASMFC regain its rightful status.”  Terms of the agreement between Monaco and Atletico weren’t
disclosed. Agence France-Presse said it’s believed to be worth
60 million euros ($78 million). Falcao had been linked with some
of Europe’s top clubs, including Chelsea and Manchester City in
 England .  Monaco earned promotion back to  France ’s top division by
winning Ligue 2 this season. The club has already signed
midfielder Joao Moutinho and forward James Rodriguez from Porto
for 70 million euros and added defender Ricardo Carvalho on a
free transfer from Real Madrid as it prepares for the top flight
in French soccer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
