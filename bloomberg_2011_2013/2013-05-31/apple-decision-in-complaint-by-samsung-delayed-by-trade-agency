A final decision in Samsung
Electronics Co.â€™s patent-infringement case against  Apple Inc. (AAPL) 
was delayed by the U.S. International Trade Commission until
June 4.  The commission set a new target date without explaining the
reason for the delay in a notice posted on its website. The
agency must decide whether Apple infringes four Samsung patents
and, if so, whether the appropriate remedy would be to limit
U.S. imports of some older models of the iPhone and iPad tablet
computer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
