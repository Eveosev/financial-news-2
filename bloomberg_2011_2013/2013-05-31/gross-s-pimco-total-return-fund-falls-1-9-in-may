Bill Gross ’s Pimco  Total Return Fund (PTTRX) ,
the world’s largest mutual fund, declined 1.9 percent this
month, the biggest monthly loss since September 2008.  The performance of the $293 billion Total Return Fund puts
it behind 94 percent of similarly managed funds through May 30,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The fund’s  allocation 
to Treasuries has hindered performance as government-debt
securities fell 1.8 percent in May as of yesterday, headed for
the steepest monthly loss in three years, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch indexes.  Gross raised the holdings of Treasuries in his flagship
fund to 39 percent as of April 30, the highest level since July
2010, from 33 percent as of March 31. He’s increased the
proportion of U.S. government securities every month this year
since February. In 2011, Gross’s fund lost an estimated $5
billion to withdrawals, according to  Morningstar Inc. (MORN) , after he
eliminated U.S. Treasuries early in the year and missed a rally.  In a Twitter message today, Gross said Pimco likes five-to
10-year Treasuries and that the economy is growing at 1.7
percent, with “no tapering for now.”  Pimco Total Return Fund fell 0.2 percent this year, ahead
of 58 percent of rivals, and has gained an annual average of 7.7
percent over the past five years, beating 93 percent of peers,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The fund’s monthly return was reported earlier today by the
Wall Street Journal.  Mark Porterfield , a spokesman for Newport
Beach, California-based Pimco, said Gross wasn’t available to
comment on the fund’s returns. Pimco is a unit of Munich-based
insurer  Allianz SE (ALV)  and manages $2.04 trillion in assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
