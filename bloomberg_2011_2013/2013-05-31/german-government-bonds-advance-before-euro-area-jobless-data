Spanish (GSPG10YR)  government bonds declined,
with 10-year yields extending their first monthly increase since
August, as the nation announced it was selling bonds due between
2015 and 2023 next week.  German 10-year bunds erased an advance after the MNI
Chicago Report’s business barometer rose more than expected in
May. Fixed-income assets around the world have tumbled the most
in almost a decade this month amid speculation the Federal
Reserve may start to taper its bond-buying stimulus program.
Italian government securities also dropped after a report showed
the euro-area unemployment rate increased to a record in April.  “Spain has auctions next week and that is probably
weighing on the bonds,” said  Luca Cazzulani , a senior fixed-income strategist at  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  in Milan. “The data has also
contributed to creating some pressure. Investors are thinking
about whether the Fed will taper its stimulus and that is bad
for all higher-yielding euro-region assets.”  Spanish 10-year bond yields climbed seven basis points, or
0.07 percentage point, to 4.44 percent at 4 p.m. London time.
The rate has climbed 30 basis points since April 30. The 5.4
percent bond due January 2023 fell 0.56, or 5.60 euros per
1,000-euro ($1,297) face amount, to 107.42. The rate on similar-maturity Italian debt rose three basis points to 4.15 percent.  The MNI Chicago Report’s business  barometer  rose to 58.7,
exceeding all forecasts in a Bloomberg survey and the highest
since March 2012, from 49 in April. A reading greater than 50
signals expansion. The  median  estimate of 54 economists surveyed
was 50.  German Bunds  Germany ’s  10-year yield  was little changed at 1.52 percent
after earlier dropping six basis points to 1.45 percent.  The  jobless rate  in the euro region rose to 12.2 percent
last month from 12.1 percent in March, the European Union’s
statistics office in Luxembourg said today, in line with the
median forecast of 37 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey.  Separate data showed consumer-price  inflation  in the euro
area accelerated this month. The annualized rate climbed to 1.4
percent in May from a month earlier, when it was 1.2 percent,
the least since February 2010.  Volatility on Greek bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today followed by those of Belgium and  France , according
to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between two- and
10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  German government bonds handed investors a loss of 1.5
percent this month through yesterday, poised for the worst month
since January, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and
the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  Securities in the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global
Broad Market Index fell 1.4 percent through May 30, poised for
the steepest loss since April 2004.  To contact the reporters on this story:
