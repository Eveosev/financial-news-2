Spain faced the highest outflow of
foreign portfolio investment in nine months in March.  Non-residents withdrew 14.1 billion euros ($18.3 billion)
of stock and bond investments, according to data released today
in  Madrid  by the Bank of Spain. That’s the most since June 2012
and the second outflow since July. In February, a net 1.1
billion euros left the country.  The nation’s current account showed a 1.39 billion-euro
surplus as imports dropped “significantly” and the energy-linked deficit narrowed, the Bank of Spain said in an e-mailed
statement. Exports grew “moderately” while tourism fueled a
surplus in services, it said.  The yield on Spain’s  10-year benchmark bond  rose six basis
points to 4.42 percent at 12:59 am in Madrid, while the spread
with similar German maturities widened 8 basis points to 2.95
percentage points. Spain’s 10-year borrowing costs have come
down from a euro-era high of 7.75 percent in July, before the
European Central Bank pledged to backstop the single currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
