Redefine Properties Ltd. (RDF) , South
Africa’s second-biggest real estate company, plans to sell its
stake in  Hyprop Investments Ltd. (HYP)  starting in September after
becoming the biggest shareholder in a rival company.  Redefine will use the shares as “currency for an
acquisition” or sell them through the market, Chief Executive
Officer Marc Wainer said in a phone interview yesterday. The
disposal would begin in the company’s next fiscal year, starting
Sept. 1, when Redefine converts into a real estate investment
trust, he said.  The stake, 11.42 percent according to data compiled by
Bloomberg, is valued at about 1.94 billion rand ($190 million)
with Hyprop  shares  trading 3.6 percent lower at 70 rand at 11:00
a.m. in Johannesburg. Redefine  shares  traded 5.8 percent lower
at 9.31 rand.  Redefine, based in Johannesburg, has reduced its Hyprop
holdings from 30 percent, using the shares to help amass a 46
percent stake for 5 billion rand in  Fountainhead Property Trust (FPT) ,
according to Wainer. He will step down from Hyprop’s board on
June 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
