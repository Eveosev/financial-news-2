Victor Valdes, Barcelona’s first-team
goalkeeper for a decade, told a televised news conference he
won’t renew his contract which expires next year.  “I consider my time here is coming to an end,” Valdes,
31, said. He said he made the decision in January but hasn’t
discussed it until now so as not to disrupt the soccer team.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
