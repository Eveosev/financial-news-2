Chile’s Ipsa stock index had its
biggest gain this year today as fund managers bought shares to
rebalance holdings in line with MSCI Inc. index-weighting
changes.  The Ipsa advanced 1.2 percent to 4,188.89 at the close in
Santiago, the most since Dec. 11. Retailer  SACI Falabella (FALAB) ’s
shares jumped 5.1 percent and was the biggest contributor to the
index’s climb. Retailer  Cencosud SA (CENCOSUD)  rose 3.2 percent while wine
exporter  Vina Concha y Toro SA  rallied 5.7 percent.  “We saw massive purchases by international funds,” German Guerrero, a partner at brokerage MBI Servicios Financieros, said
in a phone interview today. “The portfolio rebalancing drove
demand.”  MSCI on May 15 announced changes on the weightings of its
equity indexes, with changes scheduled to come into effect after
the close today, according to a  statement  on its website.
Falabella’s weighting in the  MSCI Latin America index  increased
to 0.95 percent from 0.6 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The  Ipsa (IPSA)  is down 2.6 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
