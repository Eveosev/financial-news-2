Marine Harvest ASA (MHG) , the world’s
biggest salmon farmer, raised its takover bid for Norwegian
fish-food maker  Cermaq ASA (CEQ)  and said it abandoned an even larger
offer after talks between the companies failed to reach an
agreement.  Marine Harvest offered 8.6 shares and 53.25 kroner in cash
for each Cermaq share, or 107 kroner apiece based on yesterday’s
closing price, according to a statement today. The offer, which
values Cermaq at 9.9 billion kroner ($1.7 billion) is
conditional on getting acceptances from at least 50 percent of
shareholders, the company said. It already owns 5.4 percent.  The company, controlled by billionaire  John Fredriksen ,
said it scrapped a plan to boost its original offer by more than
8 kroner a share and raise the portion settled in shares after
it failed to receive support for such an offer from Cermaq’s
board. The Norwegian government owns 43.5 percent of Cermaq.  Marine Harvest, which is seeking to expand its fish feed
operations, originally offered 105 kroner a share, including a 1
krone dividend. Cermaq makes feed and also operates salmon farms
in Chile, Canada and  Norway . The bid was conditional on Cermaq
canceling a 3.5 billion-krone takeover of  Copeinca ASA. (COP)  That
takeover was rejected at shareholders meeting last week.  Cermaq fell as much as 3.1 percent to 108 kroner after the
offer, and traded at 109 kroner as of 9:23 a.m. in Oslo. Marine
Harvest shares were down 1 percent at 6.185 kroner.  “In regard to the board’s evaluation of the voluntary
offer now to be launched by Marine Harvest, the board is
maintaining its conclusion that such offer significantly
undervalues Cermaq,” Cermaq said in a separate statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
