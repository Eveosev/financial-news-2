Iran  is storing 30 million barrels of
crude at sea as sanctions hinder exports and projects that would
allow it to build onshore facilities to hold oil, according to
E.A. Gibson Shipbrokers Ltd.  Fourteen very large crude carriers are storing Iranian oil,
the London-based shipbroker said in an e-mailed report today.
Sanctions are hindering exports and preventing the Persian Gulf
country from importing the steel it needs to build storage
plants on land, according to the report.  The U.S. and European Union are trying to isolate Iran to
pressure its leaders to stop enriching uranium that could be
used to build a nuclear bomb. The government in Tehran says the
program is for peaceful purposes. Iran exported 1.1 million
barrels a day in March, about 50 percent less than a year
earlier, the International Energy Agency estimates. Its oil
revenues fell 27 percent last year, the U.S. Energy Department
said April 26.  Iran stored oil on tankers in the second quarters of 2008,
2010 and 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg at the
time. Refineries in the Northern Hemisphere normally carry out
maintenance during the period, curbing demand for imports.  Iran was storing oil on at least 11 VLCCs and one smaller
vessel at the end of April, according to IHS Fairplay, a
maritime researcher based in Redhill,  England , that collates data
on vessel movements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
