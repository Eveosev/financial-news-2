China’s stocks  fell, paring the
benchmark index’s biggest monthly gain this year, before
tomorrow’s manufacturing report. Property and technology
companies, among the best-performing shares in May, led losses.  China Vanke Co. (000002)  and Poly Real Estate Group Co. slid at
least 2.7 percent, dragging down a gauge of developers, after
the Economic Information Daily reported Hangzhou city may impose
property taxes on existing homes.  Sanan Optoelectronics Co. (600703) 
retreated 4.7 percent, paring this month’s gain to 35 percent.
Anhui Conch Cement Co. and Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd. paced
losses for material companies, losing at least 0.9 percent. SAIC
Motor Corp. retreated 0.7 percent after Chairman Hu Maoyuan said
he’s concerned about the company’s share price.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  slid 0.7 percent to 2,300.60
at the close, paring this week’s gain to 0.5 percent. It jumped
5.6 percent in May, the biggest monthly gain since December
2012. The CSI 300 Index declined 1.1 percent to 2,606.43,
trimming the monthly advance to 6.5 percent. The Hang Seng  China 
Enterprises Index fell 1.2 percent, extending this month’s
decline to 3.2 percent.  “Investors are still waiting for economic data like
tomorrow’s PMI,” Zeng Xianzhao, an analyst at Everbright
Securities Co., said by phone from Chongqing. “There are some
gains recently but it won’t last because we don’t see obvious
drivers to continue the rally.”  The Shanghai  index  has rebounded 5.8 percent from this
year’s low set on May 2 after interest-rate cuts by central
banks around the world spurred capital inflows and Chinese
policymakers accelerated reforms of the economy by allowing
private investment in industries such as telecommunications.  PMI Data  The government is scheduled to release results of its
official manufacturing index for May tomorrow. The reading is
estimated to be 50, down from the previous month’s 50.6,
according to the median forecast of 30 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. Of the economists, 14 forecast PMI will be below 50,
including Nomura Holdings Inc. economist Zhang Zhiwei, who
accurately estimated the preliminary reading of 49.6 for HSBC
and Markit’s Purchasing Managers Index last week. That was below
the 50 level that divides expansion and contraction.  Chalco, as Aluminum Corp. of China is known, lost 1 percent
to 4.11  yuan . Anhui Conch, the largest cement producer,
retreated 0.9 percent to 16.90 yuan. A gauge of material
companies in the CSI 300 fell 0.9 percent, paring gains to 2.5
percent this month, the worst performing industry after energy.  SAIC Motor, the biggest Chinese automaker, paced declines
for consumer companies that are reliant on economic growth. The
shares fell 0.7 percent to 15.63 yuan, adding to a 11 percent
slump this year.  “Our company has investment value,” SAIC Chairman Hu said
yesterday. “We’re discussing the issue. We also want our share
price to go up.”  Property Stocks  The Shanghai Composite trades at 9.4 times 12-month
estimated earnings, compared with a seven-year average of 15.5
times, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. Trading volumes
were 9.2 percent above the 30-day average today, while 30-day
 volatility  was at 16.2, compared with this year’s average of
19.3, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The Shanghai  property sub-index  lost 1.9 percent today, the
most among the five industry groups. The measure gained 8.9
percent this month, with its estimated price-earnings ratio
jumping to a three-month high of 8,1 on May 28. Vanke, the
nation’s biggest listed property developer, retreated 2.7
percent today to 11.98 yuan. Poly Real Estate, the second
largest, fell 2.8 percent to 12.47 yuan.  The proposal of taxing existing homes has been submitted to
the State Council, or the cabinet, for approval, the Economic
Information Daily reported. The property measure is still up 10
percent this month, matching the commercial sub-index’s gains.  Technology Outlook  A measure of technology stocks in the CSI 300 sank 1.6
percent. Sanan Optoelectronics slid 4.7 percent to 19 yuan.
GoerTek Inc., a supplier of Apple Inc., dropped 4.1 percent to
35.04 yuan. Shenzhen Laibao High-technology Co., a touch-screen
maker, lost 3.4 percent to 22.50 yuan.  Even with today’s loss, the technology sub-index is still
up 17 percent this month for the best performance among the 10
industry groups. The measure trades at 25.9 times estimated
earnings, compared with 11 times for the broader CSI 300.  “What I like about tech is that it represents an aspect of
China that people don’t immediately associate with,” Alex Ng,
Chief Investment Officer for Asia Pacific at BNP Paribas
Investment Partners, said at a conference in  Singapore  today.
“Tech stocks have done well. The business models have also been
good.”  The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index advanced 0.6 percent in
 New York  yesterday. Chinese stocks rose in New York as Trina
Solar Ltd. climbed after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. upgraded U.S.
solar companies, while Spreadtrum Communications Inc. surged on
an improved industry outlook.  To contact the reporter on this story:
