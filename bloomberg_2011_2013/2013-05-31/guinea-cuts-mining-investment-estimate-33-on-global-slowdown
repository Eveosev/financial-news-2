Mining companies may invest 33
percent less than previously estimated in  Guinea  this year
because of a drop in worldwide commodity prices, the West
African nation’s finance minister said.  Mining companies will spend $1 billion in the west African
nation in 2013, less than the $1.5 billion previously forecast,
said Finance Minister Kerfalla Yansane in an interview today in
Marrakech,  Morocco , at the African Development Bank annual
meetings. Increased agricultural output and tourism may offset
the slowdown in mining, he said.  “The downturn of the mining sector may have negative
consequences for the economy,” Yansane said. “There has been
some closing down of projects, some slowdown. There have been
some job losses.”  Guinea’s economy will expand 5 percent this year before
rising 6 percent to 7 percent in 2014 as prices for commodities
like iron ore rebound, he said. The Standard and Poor’s  index of
24 commodities  has dropped 4.3 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
