U.S. stocks  fell for the week,
sending the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to its first back-to-back decline since November, as investors speculated the  Federal
Reserve  will consider scaling back stimulus efforts.  Telephone and utility shares helped lead a retreat in
companies that offer stable earnings and high dividends as
Exelon Corp. and Verizon Communications Inc. tumbled at least
5.7 percent. Financial and technology stocks were the only
 groups with gains  among the  S&P 500 (SPX) ’s 10 main industries. Bank
of America Corp. and Morgan Stanley jumped more than 3 percent
as Moody’s Investors Service lifted its outlook for the U.S.
banking system.  EMC (EMC)  Corp. rose 4.7 percent after expanding its
share buyback plan and starting a quarterly dividend.  The  S&P 500  slipped 1.1 percent to 1,630.74 over the four
sessions in the holiday-shortened week, trimming its 2013 gain
to 14 percent. The index finished May up 2.1 percent for a
seventh straight monthly rally, the longest stretch since
September 2009. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  lost 187.53
points, or 1.2 percent, to 15,115.57 for the week after hitting
an all-time high of 15,409.39 on May 28.  “We’ve had a tremendous run so it’s not unusual to have
retrenchment,” Bernard Schoenfeld, the New York-based senior
investment strategist at BNY Mellon Wealth Management, which
oversees about $188 billion, said in a telephone interview on
May 30. “It’s useful to recognize that the reason that people
are even considering an early withdrawal of Fed stimulus is that
the  U.S. economy  is doing relatively well.”  Fed Watch  Stocks alternated between gains and losses during the week
amid speculation about whether the Fed will maintain the current
pace of buying $85 billion of debt each month or reduce its
purchases. While economic growth was weaker than economists
forecast and jobless claims rose, other data showed  consumer
confidence  climbed to the highest level since 2007, home values
jumped the most in seven years and business activity rebounded.  Fed officials have been debating whether to expand or taper
bond purchases as the economy continues to grow while inflation
stays below the central bank’s preferred range. Fed Chairman  Ben
S. Bernanke  has pledged to hold the target interest rate near
zero as long as unemployment remains above 6.5 percent and the
outlook for inflation doesn’t exceed 2.5 percent.  Three rounds of monetary stimulus from the Fed and better-than-expected corporate earnings have propelled the  bull market 
in U.S. equities into a fifth year and driven the S&P 500 up 141
percent from a 12-year low in 2009.  Volatility Surges  The Chicago Board Options Exchange  Volatility Index (VIX) , or
VIX, rose 17 percent to 16.30 for the week. The equity
volatility gauge, which moves in the opposite direction to the
S&P 500 about 80 percent of the time, has surged 44 percent from
a six-year low in March.  Concern that slower bond-buying from the Fed will push
Treasury yields higher prompted investors to sell shares of
telephone and utility stocks, which  yield  the most in dividends
among the 10 main groups in the S&P 500.  While yield-seeking investors drove so-called defensive
stocks to among the biggest gains in the S&P 500 in the first
four months of the year, they’ve been lagging other industries
since then, with utilities, phone companies and consumer-staple
companies posting the biggest losses in the second quarter.  The shift into cyclical stocks “is a healthy sign,”
Joseph Tanious, a New York-based global market strategist for
JPMorgan Funds, which oversees $400 billion, said in a telephone
interview. “It’s generally what you should see in a  bull
market . As more and more people start to have conviction in the
U.S. equity market and the rally we’re seeing, I think
valuations will ultimately trump the search for income.”  Verizon, AT&T  Phone companies , which yield 4.5 percent, plunged 5 percent
for the biggest weekly drop in four years. Verizon sank 5.7
percent to $48.48 and AT&T Inc. retreated 4.8 percent to $34.99.  Utilities, which yield 4.1 percent, fell 3.1 percent. A
surge of proposed new plants in the nation’s largest wholesale
power market caused forward prices to drop. Power companies,
which stood to gain from coal plant retirements, are facing more
competition from planned natural gas-fueled facilities and
imports from neighboring markets.  Exelon tumbled 9.6 percent to $31.34. The largest U.S.
operator of nuclear reactors was cut to hold from buy at
Deutsche Bank AG.  FirstEnergy (FE)  Corp. slid 8.5 percent to $39.01.
The utility company was cut to neutral from outperform at Credit
Suisse Group AG.  An S&P index of  homebuilders  slipped 5.6 percent for the
biggest retreat since February amid rising interest rates. All
11 members fell in the week. Lennar Corp. dropped 8.1 percent to
$39.32 and Toll Brothers Inc. fell 7 percent to $34.17.  Financial Stocks  Financial companies  in the S&P 500 rose 0.5 percent as a
group. Bank of America, the second-largest U.S. lender by
assets, climbed 3.2 percent to $13.66. Morgan Stanley, the
biggest financial brokerage, increased 6.4 percent to $25.90 for
the biggest increase among financials in the S&P 500.  Moody’s changed its outlook for the U.S. banking system to
stable after keeping it negative since 2008, saying that the
country’s economy poses less of a threat.  EMC advanced 4.7 percent to $24.76. The world’s biggest
maker of storage computers expanded its share buyback plan by $5
billion and started a quarterly dividend to return cash to
investors as customers restrain spending.  CME Group Inc. gained 5.3 percent to $67.93. The world’s
largest futures exchange said it hired real estate brokers to
sell its 16-story  New York  Mercantile Exchange tower, with plans
to potentially lease back a portion of the building and its
trading floor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
