Cia. General de Electricidad SA , the
owner of  Chile ’s largest natural gas utility, had its biggest
monthly gain in 13 years as first-quarter results showed the
company is benefiting from lower wholesale prices negotiated
last year.  CGE, controlled by the Marin, Perez Cruz and Hornauer
families, has climbed 23 percent in May, the biggest monthly
surge since January 2000. It was the best performance on the
country’s Chile 65 stock index, which rose 3.3 percent during
the period. The shares today rose 2.9 percent to 3,500 pesos at
3:34 p.m. in Santiago.  The company turned profitable after its gas utility,
Metrogas SA, negotiated a 30 percent price cut last year from
supplier GNL Quintero SA, according to Alfredo Parra, an analyst
at brokerage Euroamerica Corredores de Bolsa SA. CGE on May 28
reported a first-quarter profit of 24.2 billion pesos ($48.4
million), compared with a loss of 2.25 billion pesos a year
earlier, according to a filing.  Santiago-based CGE owns 57 percent of  Gasco SA (GASCO) , which in
turn owns 52 percent of Metrogas.  The company’s electric utilities have fixed software errors
that plagued billing processes last year, Parra said in a
telephone interview.  “The regulator had blocked CGE from collecting power bills
from clients as long as it didn’t fix those glitches,” Parra
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
