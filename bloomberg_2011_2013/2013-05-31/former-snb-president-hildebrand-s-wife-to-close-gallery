Kashya Hildebrand, whose purchase of
foreign currency led to her husband Philipp to resign his post
as president of the  Swiss National Bank , plans to move her
gallery to London.  “In the very near future, we will be closing the Zurich
gallery,” she said in an e-mailed statement. “We welcome the
global, cosmopolitan, ethnic diversity of the London art market
and look forward to having a platform there.”  The gallery, not far from the main banking district,
focuses on Middle Eastern Art. The London venue  will open  on
June 26 in the borough of Westminster.  Born in  Pakistan  to an American mother, Kashya Hildebrand
met her husband while working at hedge fund Moore Capital
Management LLC in  New York  in the 1990s. She purchased $504,000
in August 2011, just three weeks before the SNB set ceiling on
the franc. Philipp Hildebrand resigned in early 2012 after news
of his wife’s purchase became public, causing an uproar. He now
works at BlackRock Inc. in  London .  Philipp Hildebrand was never publicly accused by the
government of wrongdoing. His wife defended the purchase, saying
at the time the dollar was “ridiculously cheap.”  Bilanz magazine reported the gallery’s move earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
