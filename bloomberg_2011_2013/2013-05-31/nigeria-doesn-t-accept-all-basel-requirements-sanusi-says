Nigeria  doesn’t accept all
requirements of the Basel II and Basel III accords for banking
regulation, Central Bank of Nigeria Governor Lamido Sanusi said.  While “they both have strong points” for regulating bank
reserves, “some of the quantitative elements where you
effectively allow banks to run any kind of models and to
calculate their own risk and capital,” fall short of what is
needed, Sanusi said today in  Cape Town . “There still has to be
some element of Basel I as far as that is concerned.”  Rules from the  Basel Committee on Banking Supervision 
requiring requiring banks to hold enough capital to survive
market turmoil without causing risk to the financial system,
also known as Basel III, come into effect over the next five
years.  Appointed central bank governor amid a debt crisis in
 Africa ’s largest oil producer 2009, Sanusi initiated reforms to
rescue Nigeria’s banking industry from near-collapse and fired
the chief executives of eight lenders bailed out by the
regulator. The government then set up the Asset Management Corp.
of Nigeria to buy bad debt from banks.  To contact the reporters on this story:
