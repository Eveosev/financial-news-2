Richline Group Inc., the jewelry
manufacturer owned by  Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) ,
agreed to acquire the Honora brand to expand sales of pearls.  The purchase of Honora, which has been family owned and
operated for more than 60 years, is expected to be completed in
July, according to a statement today from Omaha, Nebraska-based
Berkshire’s Richline that didn’t disclose terms.  Richline has been striking deals to expand sales through
U.S. retailers. The unit, which has manufacturing facilities in
nations including Bolivia, China, India and Israel, announced a
licensing agreement in March to market and distribute jewelry
in the U.S. and Canada under the Marie Claire brand. Richline
said Honora Chief Executive Officer Joel Schechter will remain
with the company and run it as a standalone brand.  “Honora has stood for value and quality in the jewelry
industry, and is now known as the premier freshwater cultured
pearl brand in the USA,” Richline said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
