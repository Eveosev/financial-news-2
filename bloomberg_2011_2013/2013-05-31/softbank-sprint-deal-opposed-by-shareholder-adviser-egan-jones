SoftBank (9984)  Corp.’s bid for  Sprint
Nextel Corp. (S)  is now opposed by shareholder-advisory firm Egan-Jones Ratings Co., which reversed its position as  Dish Network
Corp. (DISH) ’s counterbid gained momentum.  SoftBank will probably improve its $20.1 billion takeover
offer for Sprint, Egan-Jones said today in a report to clients.
Because of those elements, “it would be unwise at this time for
the company’s shareholders to approve the merger agreement with
SoftBank in its current form,” the Haverford, Pennsylvania-based firm said.  The change of heart is a setback for Tokyo-based SoftBank,
which has said its won’t raise its bid for Sprint because it’s
already better for investors than Dish’s offer. While Egan-Jones
originally endorsed the SoftBank bid last week, Sprint agreed
May 20 to allow Dish access to private financial data, giving
Dish information to build a stronger case for its own $25.5
billion proposal.  SoftBank and Dish, based in Englewood, Colorado, are vying
for control of Sprint as each seeks to convert the third-biggest
U.S. mobile-phone carrier into a stronger competitor against
Verizon Wireless and  AT&T Inc. (T)   “Sprint remains focused on finalizing its signed merger
agreement with SoftBank, which has been recommended by our board
of directors,” said  Scott Sloat , a spokesman for the Overland
Park, Kansas-based company, in an e-mail.  Bob Toevs, a Dish spokesman, didn’t have an immediate
comment. A SoftBank representative declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
