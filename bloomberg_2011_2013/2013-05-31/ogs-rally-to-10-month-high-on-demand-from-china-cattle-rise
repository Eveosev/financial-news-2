Hog futures rose for a second day on
mounting speculation that  China ’s proposed purchase of
 Smithfield Foods Inc. (SFD)  will boost demand for U.S. pork. Cattle
also advanced.  Shuanghui International Holdings Ltd. announced May 29 it
agreed to acquire Smithfield, the largest U.S. hog producer, to
increase meat supplies for China, the world’s biggest pork
consumer and the No. 3 buyer of U.S. exports. Wholesale-pork
prices are up 15 percent this year, and hog futures gained 9.5
percent and touched a 10-month high yesterday.  “The Smithfield story is giving the market a shot in the
arm with a lot of enthusiasm, with good pork-export business
down the road,”  Dennis Smith , senior account executive at
Archer Financial Services Inc., said in a telephone interview
from  Chicago .  Hog futures for July settlement climbed 0.4 percent to
close at 93.85 cents a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Yesterday, prices reached 94.375 cents, the highest
for the most-active contract since July 9. Prices rose 1.4
percent in May, the third straight monthly increase.  Cattle futures for August delivery rose 1.2 percent to
$1.20450 a pound on the CME. Prices dropped 1.2 percent in May,
the fourth straight monthly decline, the longest slump since
2009, and are down 9 percent this year.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement rose 0.1
percent to $1.44325 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
