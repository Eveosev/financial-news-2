OPEC members debated the criteria
needed for their next secretary-general and still have three
candidates for the role, according to Abdalla El-Badri, who
currently holds the post.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which
supplies about 40 percent of the world’s oil, maintained its
group ceiling of 30 million barrels a day for a third time at a
meeting today in Vienna. The 12-nation group will next gather on
Dec. 4 to select a candidate for its top administrative job,
according to El-Badri.  “There is a discussion about the criteria of a secretary-general,” he said at a press conference at the end of the
group’s meeting. “Any secretary-general who will come, there
must be criteria, where the OPEC secretariat will not get lost
finding a secretary-general.”  Libya ’s El-Badri held the post for six years before
agreeing in December to stay on for one more year because the
group couldn’t agree on his successor.  Saudi Arabia , the group’s biggest producer, nominated its
former OPEC governor, Majid al-Moneef for the job.  Iran , which
dropped to the fifth rank in the group because its exports have
been curbed by U.S. and European Union sanctions, selected
Gholamhossein Nozari, a former oil minister.  Iraq , the second-largest member, is fielding Thamir Ghadhban, another former oil
minister and the chief adviser to the prime minister.  To contact the reporters on this story:
