Nigeria’s proposed law to make same-sex marriage punishable by imprisonment is awaiting President
Goodluck Jonathan’s signature after it was approved by both
houses of parliament.  The House of Representatives yesterday passed the bill that
makes same-sex unions a criminal offense punishable by as many
as 14 years in prison, Victor Ogene, a lower-house spokesman,
said by phone from the capital, Abuja. Those who witness, aid or
abet such unions as well as those who operate gay clubs and
societies, and engage in public displays of same-sex affection
would be punishable by as many as 10 years jail. The Senate
passed a similar bill in November 2011.  “It’s been synchronized with the Senate’s position,”
Ogene said. “It goes to the president to be signed. Within a
week they should put the papers together.”  Nigeria is  Africa ’s largest oil producer and most populous
country with more than 160 million people almost evenly split
between a mainly Muslim north and a predominantly Christian
south. Signing the bill into law may draw the displeasure of the
U.S. and European Union countries critical of the suppression of
gay rights in Africa. Lawmakers can also override the
president’s veto if he refuses to make the bill a law.  Presidential spokesman Reuben Abati’s mobile phone was
switched off when Bloomberg News attempted to reach him for
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
