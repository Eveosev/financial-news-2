U.K. stocks  declined, with the  FTSE
100 (UKX)  Index posting two consecutive weekly losses for the first
time since November, even as the equity benchmark completed the
longest streak of monthly gains since its inception.  Imagination Technologies Group Plc (IMG)  dropped 4.5 percent as
Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch unit recommended that
investors sell the shares. London-listed mining companies pared
their first monthly advance since January as  Rio Tinto  Group and
Glencore Xstrata Plc both fell at least 2.5 percent.  The FTSE 100 lost 73.9 points, or 1.1 percent, to 6,583.09
at the close in London. The gauge dropped 1.1 percent this week.
It has still climbed 2.4 percent in May, for a 12th month of
gains and the longest winning streak since the gauge was formed
in 1984. The broader FTSE All-Share Index declined 1 percent
today, even as it rose for a 12th month for the first time since
the benchmark measure began in 1962. Ireland’s ISEQ Index
slipped 0.5 percent.  “The market is perhaps going to be more volatile from
here,” Xavier Lagrandie, who helps manage about $40 billion at
Lombard Odier Investment Managers, said in a telephone interview
from Geneva. “Still, this is a short-term pull-back, and I’d
see a correction of 5 to even 10 percent as an opportunity to
put more money to work again.”  Treasury Yields  The yield on benchmark 10-year  U.S. Treasuries (USGG10YR)  has
increased 48 basis points in May, its biggest monthly advance
since December 2010, amid speculation that the  Federal Reserve 
will taper its debt-buying program as economic data improves.  “It’s understandable that at some point interest rates go
up a bit, but rates are still extremely low,” Lagrandie said.
“We’ve seen an economic recovery in the U.S., which supports
global growth, though  Europe  continues to lag behind.”  U.S. consumer sentiment  climbed in May to the highest level
since July 2007. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan
index of  consumer confidence  rose to 84.5 from 76.4 in April,
according to a final reading today. Economists had predicted a
gain to 83.7.  Business activity in the U.S. increased this month to the
highest level in 14 months. The MNI Chicago Report’s  business
barometer  rose to 58.7 in May, from 49 in April. Economists
surveyed by Bloomberg had forecast an increase to 50. A reading
above 50 signals expansion.  Economic Growth  The U.K. economy will grow faster than previously forecast
over the next three years, the British Chambers of Commerce said
today.  Gross domestic product  will rise 0.9 percent this year,
1.9 percent next year and 2.4 percent in 2015, compared with
previous forecasts of 0.6 percent, 1.7 percent and 2.2 percent,
the London-based lobby group said.  A U.K. consumer- sentiment index  published by GfK NOP Ltd.
climbed 5 points to minus 22 this month. That matched the
reading in November, which was the strongest in 18 months.  The number of shares changing hands in FTSE 100-listed
companies was 49 percent greater than the average of the past 30
days, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Imagination Technologies dropped 4.5 percent to 351.4
pence. Merrill Lynch lowered its rating on the designer of chips
for mobile devices to underperform, the equivalent of a sell
recommendation, from neutral. The brokerage said that lower
prices for smartphones and tablet computers sold in  emerging
markets  will reduce the royalties that the company collects from
every sale.  A  gauge  of London-listed mining companies slipped 2.1
percent, paring its advance in May to 1.7 percent. Rio Tinto,
the world’s second-largest raw-materials producer, slipped 2.6
percent to 2,857 pence, while Glencore decreased 3.1 percent to
323.1 pence.  Vedanta Resources Plc (VED)  slid 3.4 percent to 1,262
pence.  Lonmin Plc (LMI)  jumped 2.8 percent to 295 pence, extending its
biggest weekly rally in almost four months. Morgan Stanley
upgraded the shares to overweight from equal weight, meaning
that investors should buy more of the shares. The brokerage
described their valuation as attractive.  To contact the reporter on this story:
