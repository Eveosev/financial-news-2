The world’s grain harvest will be
bigger in the 2013-14 season than predicted a month ago on
increased estimates for corn in China and larger wheat crops in
 India  and  Canada , the International Grains Council said.  Output of grains excluding rice may rise to 1.92 billion
metric tons from an estimated 1.79 billion tons in 2012-13, the
London-based IGC wrote in its monthly market report today,
raising its outlook for the new harvest by 10.3 million tons.  The outlook for rising grain production in the U.S.,  Europe 
and the  Black Sea region  has hurt corn and wheat prices. Corn is
the second-worst performer on the S&P GSCI Commodity gauge
behind silver this year, sliding 19 percent.  For corn, “carryovers in 2013-14 will be much more
comfortable compared to the previous year, especially in the
U.S., where stocks are expected to more than double,” the
grains council wrote.  World corn production may jump 10 percent to 944.6 million
tons from 855.7 million tons in 2012-13, the IGC forecast,
raising the outlook by 5.7 million tons. That will boost ending
stocks to 149 million tons from 122 million tons, it said.  The outlook for  China ’s corn crop was lifted by 4 million
tons to 214 million tons, climbing from production of 208
million tons in the previous season. U.S. farmers may gather 355
million tons of corn from 273.8 million tons in 2012, the IGC
forecast, cutting its outlook by 2 million tons.  The European Union’s corn harvest may jump to 64.4 million
tons from 54.8 million tons on production gains in  Romania  and
 Hungary , which suffered from drought last year, while Brazil’s
output may fall to 72 million tons from 78 million tons.  Corn  Global trade in corn may climb to 97.5 million tons from
94.5 million tons, with imports by China advancing to 7 million
tons from 4 million tons. EU overseas purchases are predicted to
fall to 6.5 million tons from 10 million tons.  The U.S. is expected to reclaim its spot as the world’s
biggest corn exporter from  Brazil , with shipments climbing to 32
million tons from 21.5 million tons. Brazil’s corn exports are
seen falling to 20.5 million tons from 27 million tons.  Farmers across the world are forecast to reap 682.1 tons of
wheat, 4.1 percent more than a 2012-13 crop estimated at 655.1
million tons and 2.2 million tons more than predicted last
month, according to the IGC.  Stocks of the world’s most-traded grain are seen climbing
to 180 million tons from 178 million tons.  Wheat production in the EU may climb to 137.1 million tons
from 130.3 million tons on bigger crops in Spain and Romania,
even as the U.K.’s harvest is predicted to slide to 11.8 million
tons from 13.3 million tons.  Production Up  Russia, Ukraine and  Kazakhstan  are all forecast by the IGC
to boost wheat production, with farmers in the former  Soviet
Union  lifting output to 99.9 million tons from 77.2 million
tons.  The U.S. wheat crop will probably decline to 52 million
tons from 61.8 million tons, while Canada’s may rise to 29
million tons from 27.2 million tons, according to the IGC, which
raised the forecast for the latter by 1 million tons.  “Although there is continued uncertainty about harvest
prospects in some major producers, global wheat availabilities
are still set to be ample over the year ahead,” the IGC said.  China’s harvest, the world’s biggest, may drop to 118
million tons from 120.6 million tons, the IGC forecast. India
may produce 93.5 million tons of wheat, down from 94.9 million
in 2012 and 1 million tons more than predicted a month ago.  Global wheat trade is expected to fall to 136.8 million
tons in 2013-14 from 138.5 million tons in the previous season,
with  Russia  cutting imports to 100,000 tons from 1.2 million
tons on a bigger domestic harvest.  Barley production worldwide is forecast to climb to 137.7
million tons from 129.7 million tons, lifted by bigger crops in
Russia, Ukraine,  Turkey  and  Morocco , according to the IGC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
