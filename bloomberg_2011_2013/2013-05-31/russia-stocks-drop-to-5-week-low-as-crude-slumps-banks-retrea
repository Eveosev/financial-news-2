Russian  equities  fell to a five-week
low, extending a fourth-straight monthly drop as crude oil
tumbled and the nation’s biggest lenders declined.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  retreated 0.8 percent to 1,350.48 by 11:41
a.m. in Moscow, poised for a 2.5 percent drop in the month.
Financial stocks led the declines among industry groups along
with utilities, losing 1.2 percent on average.  Crude,  Russia ’s main export earner, declined 0.8 percent to
$92.90 a barrel in  New York , heading for a third weekly decline
after U.S. stockpiles climbed to the most in more than 80 years.
OAO Sberbank, the nation’s biggest lender, tumbled 1.1 percent
to 98.82 rubles, while VTB Group dropped 1.7 percent to 4.48
kopeks. Russia’s economy will probably expand 2.3 percent in the
second quarter, according to the median estimate of 9 economists
in a Bloomberg survey. That’s less than the forecast of 2.5
percent a month earlier.  “There’s Russia fatigue in the market,”  Bruce Bower , a
partner at Verno Capital in Moscow, which manages about $200
million in assets, said by phone. “Commodity prices have come
down, which presents a risk for Russia.”  Total fund outflows from Russia in the week ending May 29
reached $267 million, compared with $652 million from  Brazil ,
Sberbank CIB said in an e-mailed note today.  Putin’s Stimulus  The nation’s economy grew at the weakest pace since 2009 in
the first quarter as the euro area’s longest recession hurt
demand for commodity exports, federal data showed on May 17.
Russia’s central bank kept its  main interest rates  on hold for
an eighth month in May.  President  Vladimir Putin  “has asked for stimulus measures
and I think we’ll see a move soon,” Verno’s Bower said. “In
the second half of the year we should see a rate cut.”  The  U.S. economy  expanded less than previously estimated in
the first quarter and more Americans filed claims for
 unemployment insurance  last week, reports showed yesterday.  The Micex tumbled the most in a year on May 23, the day
after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the
central bank could reduce the pace of its asset purchases if
officials see signs of sustained improvement in growth. The Fed
buys $85 billion of debt a month to support the economy by
putting downward pressure on  interest rates .  OAO Moscow Exchange, Russia’s biggest bourse, increased 0.6
percent to 53.80 rubles after first-quarter net income rose 21
percent to 2.56 billion rubles. The stock is poised for a 20
percent advance in the month, the most on the Micex.  Lowest Valuation  The volume of shares traded on the Micex was 31 percent
below the 30-day average, while 10-day price swings subsided to
29.35.  Russian equities have the cheapest valuations among 21
 emerging markets  tracked by Bloomberg. The Micex trades at 5.1
times its 12-month estimated earnings and has lost 7.1 percent
this year, compared with a 10.3 multiple for the MSCI Emerging
Markets Index, which has dropped 4 percent in the period.  The dollar-denominated  RTS Index (RTSI$)  added 0.6 percent to
1,359.11. The Russian Volatility Index tumbled 2.5 percent to
24.74. The Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Russian companies in the U.S. rose 0.2 percent to 89.82
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
