Hellenic Petroleum SA (ELPE)  shares fell to
the lowest level in seven weeks after  Greece ’s largest refiner
reported a first-quarter loss as demand for heating oil plunged.  Shares dropped 3 percent to 7.66 euros at 2:48 p.m. in
Athens, its lowest level since April 11, after earlier dropping
as much as 4.6 percent. The stock has lost 9.9 percent so far
this week.  “The rest of 2013 will continue to present significant
challenges in the form of weak domestic market and volatile
refining margins,” Chief Executive Officer John Costopoulos
said in a statement yesterday after the market close.  Hellenic Petroleum reported a first-quarter loss of 78
million euros ($101 million), compared to a profit of 71 million
euros in the same period last year. The refiner said demand for
heating oil tumbled 70 percent during both the fourth quarter of
2012 and the first quarter of 2013 after the Greek government
raised taxes on the fuel.  Greece is in a sixth year of a recession that has been
exacerbated by wage and pension cuts and tax increases tied to
the country’s 240 billion-euro bailout packages.  To contact the reporter on this story:
