New Zealand won the toss and elected
to bowl in the opening game of the one-day cricket series
against  England  at Lords in  London .  England pace bowlers Stuart Broad and Steven Finn will miss
the first two games of the three-game series because of
injuries. Broad bruised his right knee in the recent Test match
against New Zealand and Finn has soreness in his shin, the
England and Wales Cricket Board said on its website.  Both players will be reassessed early next week ahead of
the final game June 5 at Trent Bridge in Nottingham.  New Zealand named seam bowler Ian Butler as the replacement
for Trent Boult, who was ruled out of the series yesterday with
a torn muscle in his side.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
