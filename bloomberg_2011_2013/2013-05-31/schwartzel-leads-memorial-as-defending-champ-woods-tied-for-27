South Africa’s Charl Schwartzel has a
one-stroke lead going into the second round, while defending
champion Tiger Woods is tied for 27th at the PGA’s Memorial
Tournament.  Schwartzel finished yesterday’s opening round with a 7-under 65 at Muirfield Village Golf Club in Dublin,  Ohio .  “The birdie on the last definitely will make my evening a
lot better,” Schwartzel said after yesterday’s round. “I felt
like I played really well, just kept making -- sort of ticking
the ball over and got it to 8 under, just had a bad one on No.
8, made a double. And that was the very worst I played all
day.”  Scott Piercy holds second place with a 6-under 66, while
Josh Teater, Russell Henley, Kyle Stanley and Charlie Wi are
tied for third after carding 5-under 67s.  “I’ll take 66 all the time,” Piercy said. “It’s just
learning how to play golf courses. I can hit it over almost all
the corners here, but I have to hit a perfect golf shot and if I
don’t, I’m not in a very good spot.”  Woods, the top-ranked golfer in the world, bogeyed his
final hole to end the first round at 1-under 71. He is among 14
golfers tied for 27th.  Fourteen-year-old Tianlang Guan of  China  carded an even-par
72 in the first round. Rory McIlroy of Northern Ireland, ranked
second in the world, had a 6-over 78 for the fifth-highest round
of his career.  To contact the reporter on this story:
