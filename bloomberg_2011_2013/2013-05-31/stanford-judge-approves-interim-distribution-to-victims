A plan by a court-appointed receiver
to distribute assets recovered from R. Allen Stanford’s Ponzi
scheme to investors was approved by a federal judge in  Dallas .  U.S. District Judge David C. Godbey accepted the plan by
Ralph Janvey, the receiver appointed in 2009 to marshal and
liquidate Stanford’s personal and business assets, to make a $55
million interim distribution to about 17,000 claimants, or about
1 cent for each of the $5.1 billion lost in the fraud scheme.  “We will follow it up in a subsequent distribution as the
money comes in,” Janvey’s attorney, Kevin Sadler of Baker Botts
LLP, told Godbey at a court hearing in April.  Ponzi scheme victims of Bernard L. Madoff, who was arrested
in December 2008, recovered more than $5.4 billion. Clients of
the MF Global Inc. brokerage were paid about $4.9 billion after
its parent, MF Global Holdings Ltd., failed in October 2011.
Victims of a scheme by Peregrine Financial Group Inc. founder
Russell Wasendorf, who prosecutors last year said stole $215
million, received an interim distribution of $123 million.  A federal jury in Houston last year found Stanford, 63,
guilty of lying to investors about the nature and oversight of
certificates of deposit issued by his Antigua-based bank. The
jurors decided he must forfeit $330 million in accounts seized
by the U.S. government.  The SEC case is Securities and Exchange Commission v.
Stanford International Bank, 09-cv-00298, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of  Texas  (Dallas). The criminal case is U.S.
v. Stanford, 09-cr-00342, U.S. District Court, Southern District
of Texas (Houston).  To contact the reporter on this story:
