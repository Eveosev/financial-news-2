Serbia  will scale back its domestic
borrowing program for the rest of 2013, relying on banks’ ample
liquidity to roll over maturing liabilities.  The government has met 75 percent of its external debt
target and 70 percent of the domestic goal through May, the Debt
Management Agency in the capital, Belgrade, said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday. It has also repaid 60 percent of the total
due this year, including early redemption of part of outstanding
debt to the London Club of bank creditors without expanding
gross financing needs, according to the agency.  “The level of debt operations in the local market will
shrink in the coming months in comparison with the first five
months of 2013,” the agency said. “The banking sector in
Serbia is liquid, with a high capital-adequacy ratio, so there
will be no problem to roll over local securities maturing in the
coming period.”  Serbia needs to repay 208 billion dinars ($2.4 billion) in
outstanding Treasury bills by the end of 2013, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The government will spend 190 million
euros ($248 million) tomorrow for an installment of its debt to
citizens, whose savings were frozen in the early 1990s. Another
100 million euros will be repaid by the end of 2013.  After the May 31 repayment, “the outstanding cash will
total 1.6 billion euros,” which is “enough to finance all
public debt liabilities until the end of the year,” the agency
said. Budgeted cash reserves of $320 million “in the financing
plan can be used to cover an additional budget deficit.”  Deficit Risks  The fiscal gap hit 62 percent of the full-year target in
the four months through April and the International Monetary
Fund said the full-year shortfall may top 8 percent of gross
domestic product if policies remain unchanged. The government
targeted a deficit of 3.6 percent of GDP and will revise the
budget next month, with new savings measures to curb the gap.  Junk-rated Serbia borrowed $3.25 billion in three Eurobond
sales since September, taking advantage of optimism about the
global economic recovery as extra liquidity from central banks
pushed investors toward higher-yielding assets.  Under the 2013 budget, Serbia put its gross financing needs
at 526 billion dinars, excluding a 28 billion dinar reserve,
which was “planned for a cash stock increase,” the government
said. It raised 184.6 billion dinars in debt sales at home
through May 30, with a total of 265 billion dinars planned for
2013. It also borrowed $1.5 billion of the $2 billion planned
through a Eurobond sale this year.  Prime Minister Ivica Dacic’s 11-month old Cabinet is
counting on the first, $300 million loan tranche from  Russia  for
its budget “in the coming months” while the remaining $200
million will be available after Serbia clinches a loan program
with the IMF, according to the Debt Agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
