European Central Bank Governing
Council member Ignazio Visco urged nations to control debt and
stimulate growth as a compliment to  monetary policy  in a common
effort to keep the euro stable.  “Every country must do its part,” Visco, also governor of
the  Bank of Italy , said in the text of speech delivered today in
Rome at the central bank’s annual meeting. “Monetary policy can
guarantee stability only if the area’s economic fundamentals and
institutional architecture are consistent with that objective.”  Visco is calling for reforms and debt management as the 17-nation single-currency area struggles to bring down unemployment
and foster economic growth. Euro instability, which Visco
associates with what he calls “redenomination risk,” has been
curbed by the ECB’s Outright Monetary Transactions program,
announced last year, to purchase debt from countries that
request assistance.  “The measures taken, in particular the announcement of the
outright monetary transactions, are conducive to the national
and European reforms which alone can eradicate redenomination
risk,” Visco said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
