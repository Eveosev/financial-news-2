Abu Nusaybah, who was arrested last
week after appearing on  BBC ’s Newsnight program to discuss the
killing of a soldier in Woolwich, was charged with three terror
offenses by prosecutors today.  Nusaybah, 30, was charged with encouraging terrorism and
disseminating terrorist publications, the  Crown Prosecution
Service  said in a statement.  Nusaybah said on Newsnight that he was a friend of Michael
Adebolajo, one of two men suspected of killing Lee Rigby last
week. The charges against Nusaybah aren’t related to the
Woolwich attack, CPS said.  Police said Nusaybah, whose real name is Ibrahim Abdullah-Hassan, published a series of video lectures delivered by
himself that encouraged terrorism. He also published materials
by two other people that encouraged terrorism, the  Metropolitan
Police Service  said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
