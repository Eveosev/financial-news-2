Bradley Wiggins won’t defend his  Tour
de France  cycling title because of a knee injury.  The 33-year-old Briton quit the Giro de Italia two weeks
ago because of a worsening lung infection and is suffering from
a knee injury, according to Team Sky, for which he rides.  “It’s a huge disappointment not to make the Tour,”
Wiggins  said on the team website . “I can’t train the way I need
to train and I’m not going to be ready.”  The three-week Tour de  France  starts June 29. Wiggins last
year became the first British winner.  Wiggins crashed at the Giro de Italia and pulled out of the
race before the 13th of 21 stages while 5 minutes, 22 seconds
behind eventual winner Vincenzo Nibali of  Italy .  Last October, Wiggins said he intended to target the
Italian race as a priority and assist teammate Chris Froome at
the Tour de France. In April, he appeared to change plans when
he said he could challenge to win the French race, according to
the  Daily Telegraph .  Team Sky manager David Brailsford said on the team website
today that Wiggins “has gone past the point where he can be
ready for the Tour de France” and won’t be considered for
selection.  To contact the reporters on this story:
