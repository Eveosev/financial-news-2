Growthpoint Properties Ltd. (GRT)  and
Redefine Properties Ltd., fell the most in several years in
Johannesburg as foreign investors extended the biggest selloff
in South African bonds since 2011 to property stocks.  Growthpoint  slumped  as much as 8.4 percent, the steepest
intraday decline since December 2008, and traded 6.6 percent
lower at 24.1 rand by 3:27 p.m. local time. About 12.4 million
shares traded, more than twice the three-month daily average.  South African bonds are posting the world’s worst returns
this month while the rand’s slide to a four-year low against the
dollar yesterday as President Jacob Zuma failed to reassure
investors that the government is doing enough to stop labor
unrest that is curbing growth in the  Africa ’s biggest economy.  Growthpoint’s “stock is very liquid and is the first in
line to take a hit in the selloff by foreigners,” said Geoff Noble, a portfolio manager at Grindrod Asset Management (Pty)
Ltd., in a phone interview from Durban. “Growthpoint, the
poster boy of South African property stocks, has the biggest
share of foreign investors.”  Redefine Properties Ltd. (RDF) , the country’s second-largest real
estate company was trading 6.4 percent lower to 9.25 rand.
 Hyprop Investments Ltd. (HYP)  slid 7.6 percent, the most since April
2011.  Zuma yesterday dispatched his deputy and three other
cabinet members to intervene in the feud between the National
Union of Mineworkers and the Association of Mineworkers and
Construction Union.  To contact the reporter on this story:
