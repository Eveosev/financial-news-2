Adcock Ingram Holdings Ltd. (AIP) ,  South
Africa ’s largest hospital supplier, is in active talks with “a
number of parties” that may result in the company’s sale,
Chairman Khotso Mokhele said.  “The process we have put in place, which has been designed
to ensure appropriate confidentiality in relation to Adcock
Ingram’s commercially sensitive information, is aimed at
providing certainty” for shareholders, employees and suppliers,
Mokhele said today in a statement.  Adcock said May 9 that it had received non-binding
proposals that could lead to an offer for all stock or a
controlling stake, sending the Johannesburg-based drugmaker’s
shares to their highest price in more than two years. The Public
Investment Corp., the biggest shareholder, said May 14 that it
would prefer that a South African company buy Adcock.  Bidvest Group Ltd. (BVT) , whose offer for a controlling holding
was rejected by the drugmaker in March, still wants to acquire
Adcock and wants the same information made available to other
bidders, Chief Executive Officer Brian Joffe said May 10. PIC
also owns shares in Johannesburg-based Bidvest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
