Gold futures slumped the most in two
weeks as U.S.  consumer confidence  climbed in May to the highest
in almost six years, stoking concern that the Federal Reserve
may scale back monetary stimulus.  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan final index of
sentiment rose to 84.5, the highest since July 2007, from 76.4 a
month earlier. The greenback climbed as much as 0.7 percent
against a basket of major currencies as euro-area unemployment
increased to a record in April. Gold has dropped 17 percent this
year.  “Today’s data gives the Fed another reason to start
looking at lowering the stimulus package,”  Frank Lesh , a trader
at FuturePath Trading in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview.
“The dollar is also weighing on gold.”  Gold futures for August delivery fell 1.3 percent to settle
at $1,393 an ounce at 1:49 p.m. on the Comex in New York, the
biggest drop for a most-active contract since May 17.  In May, futures fell 5.4 percent, the seventh drop in eight
months, after slumping into a bear market in April as some
investors lost faith in the metal as a store of value amid low
inflation and a rally in the equity market.  China Outlook  The  China  Gold Association said demand may ebb in the
second half of this year after surging in April. Assets in
global exchange-traded products backed by the metal fell to
2,152 metric tons yesterday, the lowest since June 2011,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  India  is the world’s biggest gold buyer, followed by China.  Silver futures for July delivery declined 2 percent to
$22.243 an ounce, the biggest drop since May 15. This month, the
price tumbled 8 percent, the fourth straight drop.  This year, silver has slumped 26 percent, the most among 24
 raw materials  in the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index, followed
by corn and gold.  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, palladium futures for
September delivery fell 0.9 percent to $753.65 an ounce. This
month, the price rose 8 percent, the most since November, on
concern that global demand may outpace supplies for the metal
used in jewelry and pollution-control devices in vehicles.  Platinum futures for July delivery dropped 1.4 percent to
$1,461.80 an ounce. In May, the price fell 3 percent, the fourth
straight decline and the longest slump since October 2008.  This year, palladium has climbed 7.2 percent, while
platinum dropped 5.2 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
