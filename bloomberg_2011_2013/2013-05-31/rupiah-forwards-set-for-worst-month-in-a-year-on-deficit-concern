Indonesia ’s rupiah forwards fell to
the lowest since September 2009 on concern a delay in raising
fuel prices will spur energy imports, worsening the nation’s
current-account deficit.  One-month non-deliverable forwards slipped 0.9 percent to
10,084 per dollar as of 4:24 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. They touched 10,086, the weakest since
Sept. 8, 2009. The contracts were down 3.2 percent for the
month, the most since May 2012. They traded at a 2.9 percent
discount to the spot rate, which was up 0.1 percent for the day
and down 0.7 percent for the month at 9,795.  The government wants to cushion the poor from energy costs
by providing compensation, Energy and Mineral Resources Minister
Jero Wacik said yesterday, adding that this needs parliamentary
consultation. On May 22, the authorities said gasoline prices
will rise by 2,000 rupiah ($0.20) from June. The shortfall in
Indonesia’s  current account , the broadest measure of trade, was
$5.27 billion in the first three months of the year, the sixth
consecutive quarterly deficit.  “People aren’t very convinced the government will be able
to raise fuel prices,” said Ho Woei Chen, an economist at
 United Overseas Bank Ltd. (UOB)  in  Singapore . “They’re also very
concerned what the impact of this will be on the current-account
deficit.”  Central Bank  Indonesia’s  central bank  intervened in the  currency market 
on May 29 and will continue to do so when needed to guard the
 exchange rate  at a level that reflects economic fundamentals,
Governor Agus Martowardojo said yesterday.  One-month implied volatility in the rupiah, a measure of
expected exchange-rate swings used to price options, rose 3.08
percentage points from April 30 to 8.63 percent. It climbed 1.04
percentage points today and 1.77 percentage points this week.  The yield on the 5.625 percent bonds maturing in May 2023
increased 48 basis points this month, the most since August, to
5.98 percent, according to prices from the Inter Dealer Market
Association. It rose 19 basis points this week and was little
changed today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
