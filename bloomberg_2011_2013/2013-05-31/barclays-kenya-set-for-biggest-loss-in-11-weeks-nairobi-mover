Barclays Bank Kenya Ltd., the
nation’s third-biggest lender by market value, dropped the most
in eight weeks after it said first-quarter profit slid.  The Nairobi-based bank  fell  3.2 percent, the most since
April 4, to 17.95 shillings by the 3 p.m. close in Nairobi, the
capital. The number of shares traded was 31 percent of the
stock’s three-month average volume, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Net income in the three months through March declined to
1.66 billion shillings ($19.5 million), compared with 1.97
billion shillings a year earlier, the company said yesterday.
Net interest income, the money banks earn from loans, rose to
4.52 billion shillings, from 4.38 billion shillings a year ago.
Profit slipped after the bank incurred a one-off 658 million
shillings reorganization charge.  Equity Bank Ltd., the biggest Kenyan lender by market
value, said May 6 first-quarter profit jumped 22 percent to 3.21
billion shillings. On May 8, Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd., the
second-largest lender, reported a 25 percent growth in profit to
3.03 billion shillings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
