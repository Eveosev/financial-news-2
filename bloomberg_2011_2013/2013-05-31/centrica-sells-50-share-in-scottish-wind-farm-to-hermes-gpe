Centrica Plc (CNA) , the U.K.’s largest
household energy supplier, agreed to sell its 50 percent share
in a Scottish wind farm to a fund managed by private equity
company Hermes GPE LLP for 59 million pounds ($89.4 million).  Centrica, which bought its stake in 2007 for 42 million
pounds, will continue to receive all power from the 72-megawatt
Braes of Doune plant in Stirlingshire, the Windsor-based company
said today. The sale is “in line with Centrica’s strategy to
release capital from operational wind assets to enhance
returns,” it said in a statement.  Following completion of the deal in June, Centrica will own
shares in four operating wind farms as well as the Race Bank
wind plant planned off north Norfolk and developments in the
Round 3 Irish Sea zone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
