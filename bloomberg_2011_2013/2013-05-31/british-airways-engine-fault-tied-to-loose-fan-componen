A British Airways jetliner forced to
make an emergency landing at  London Heathrow  a week ago suffered
an engine fault caused by fan components that hadn’t been
properly fastened, an investigation found.  As the Airbus SAS A319, which carried 75 passengers, took
off from the Heathrow runway, unsecured fan cowl doors detached
and punctured a fuel pipe on the right engine, leading to a
fire, the bulletin by the U.K. Air Accidents Investigation
Branch said. The pilots shut down the engine and flew the plane
back to Heathrow. Nobody was injured.  British Airways said it has taken “appropriate initial
action” to meet the AAIB’s safety recommendations. The panel
said Airbus must reiterate with operators “the importance of
verifying that the fan cowl doors are latched prior to flight by
visually checking the position of the latches.”  Flight BA762 left Heathrow for Oslo at 8:16 a.m. on May 24
before turning back with a technical fault and landing at 8:43
a.m., London-based  British Airways (IAG)  said last week. The plane
A319 is a single-aisle model typically used on European routes.  The engines were IAE V2522-A5 turbofan engines. The
aircraft had undergone overnight maintenance, which required
opening the fan cowl doors on the engines, the investigator
said. Because of their proximity to the ground, the latches are
difficult to see unless maintenance workers crouch down, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
