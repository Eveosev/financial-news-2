Russia’s 2027 ruble bonds are heading
for their worst month on record as investors shun riskier assets
amid concern the U.S. Federal Reserve may pare back stimulus and
on expectations May inflation won’t slow.  The yield on benchmark OFZ bonds due February 2027 rose 12
basis points, or 0.12 percentage point, to 7.56 percent by 2:02
p.m. in Moscow. That’s the highest since November 20 and takes
the advance for May to 76 basis points, beating the increase in
the same period of last year. The ruble weakened.  Developing-nation assets have slumped this month after Fed
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said last week the central bank could
reduce the pace of bond purchases if there is a sustained
improvement in growth. Russian consumer prices probably rose 7.2
percent in May from a year earlier, unchanged from April and
more than 100 basis points above Bank Rossii’s target, according
to a Bloomberg survey of 15 economists.  “There’s no safe haven any more,” Konstantin Artemov, who
manages $500 million in fixed-income securities at Raiffeisen
Capital in Moscow, said in e-mailed comments. “We are now
dependent on the hurricanes on global exchanges.”  Emerging-market bond funds saw an outflow of $89 million in
the week to May 29, the first reduction since June 2012, OAO
Gazprombank said in an e-mailed report today, citing EPFR Global
data.  The ruble retreated 0.4 percent against Bank Rossii’s
dollar-euro basket to 36.2212 compared with 35.5441 at the end
of last month. The Russian currency weakened 0.7 percent versus
the dollar to 31.9450 from 31.1210 at the April 30 close.  Brent oil declined 0.7 percent to $101.53 per barrel,
falling for the third day. Oil and natural-gas industries
contribute about half of  Russia ’s budget revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
