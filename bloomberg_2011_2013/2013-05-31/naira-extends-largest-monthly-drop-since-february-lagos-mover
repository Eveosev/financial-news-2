The naira weakened against the
dollar, extending its worst monthly performance since February,
amid speculation foreign investors sold  Nigeria ’s debt and as
 oil prices  declined.  The currency of the  Africa ’s biggest crude producer dropped
for a second day as emerging-market stocks fell, heading for the
biggest monthly loss in a year. Yields on the 16.39 percent
domestic bonds due January 2022 rose to a one-month high
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “It looks as if the global risk-off environment is feeding
into Nigerian assets, broadly in line with what other  emerging
markets  are experiencing,”  Samir Gadio , an emerging-markets
strategist at Standard Bank Group Ltd. in  London , said in an e-mailed reply to questions today. “As local market players
witness the shift in the offshore positioning, they are also
likely to push dollar-naira higher.”  Nigeria’s currency weakened 0.1 percent to 158.63 per
dollar at 1:17 p.m. in Lagos, the commercial capital, taking its
monthly decline to 0.4 percent.  The yield on the 2022 securities rose 23 basis points, or
0.23 percentage point, to 11.86 percent yesterday, the highest
since April 29, according to the data compiled by Bloomberg.  Bonny Light crude, one of Nigeria’s main export grades,
fell for a third day, dropping 0.6 percent to $103.41 per
barrel. Nigeria depends on oil shipments for 80 percent of
government revenue and 95 percent of its export income.  Indian Slowdown  The MSCI Emerging Markets Index fell 0.9 percent, declining
for a third day and set for a 3.2 percent drop since April 30.
Stocks slid after data showed  India’s economy  grew less than 5
percent for a second quarter and amid speculation that data
tomorrow will show a slowdown in Chinese manufacturing.  The Abuja-based  central bank sold  $371.71 million to
lenders this week, down 32 percent from last week, after one of
the regular auction dates on May 29 didn’t go ahead due to a
public holiday. The  Central Bank of Nigeria  uses the auctions to
stabilize the naira as the cost of importing refined fuel, which
accounts for 70 percent of the local gasoline market, boosts
dollar demand and puts pressure on the currency.  “If the currency slides beyond 159 to 160, we expect the
CBN to intervene in the market to stabilize the  exchange rate ,”
said Gadio.  Yields on the nation’s $500 million of Eurobonds due
January 2021 declined 12 basis points to 4.608 percent today.  Ghana’s cedi fell less than 0.1 percent to 1.9975 per
dollar in Accra, taking its monthly retreat to 1.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
