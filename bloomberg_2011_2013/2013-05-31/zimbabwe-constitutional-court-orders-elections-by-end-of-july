Zimbabwe’s  Constitutional Court 
imposed a July 31 deadline for the holding of elections and
ordered President  Robert Mugabe  to announce the date soon.  “Elections should take place by no later than July 31,”
Chief Justice Godfrey Chidyausiku said, reading the court’s
unanimous ruling in the capital, Harare.  Mugabe is “hereby ordered and directed to proclaim as soon
as possible a date for the holding of presidential elections,
general elections and elections for governing bodies of local
authorities.”  Mugabe agreed on a new constitution on May 22 after
negotiations with his main political rival, Prime Minister
 Morgan Tsvangirai , paving the way for elections this year.  The constitution had been in negotiation between Mugabe’s
Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front party and
Tsvangirai’s Movement for Democratic Change since disputed
elections in 2008. After that vote, the two parties governed
together under an agreement that brought an end to a decade of
political and economic crisis, which saw inflation surge to 500
billion percent, according to the  International Monetary Fund .  Today’s ruling came in response to a case filed by a
citizen trying to force Mugabe to announce the election dates.  Mugabe, 89, has ruled the southern African nation since its
independence from the U.K. more than three decades ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
