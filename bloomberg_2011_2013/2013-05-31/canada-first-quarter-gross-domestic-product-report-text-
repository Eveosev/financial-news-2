The following is the text of
the March GDP report released by  Statistics Canada .  Real gross domestic product (GDP) expanded 0.6% in the
first quarter, the fastest pace in six quarters, bolstered by a
1.5% increase in exports. On a monthly basis, real GDP by
industry grew 0.2% in March.  Exports were the largest contributor to growth in the
quarter. Export volumes increased 1.5%, after a gain of 0.2% in
the fourth quarter of 2012 and declines in the previous three
quarters. Imports were up slightly by 0.3%, after falling 0.8%
in the previous quarter.  Final domestic demand edged up 0.1%, the weakest showing
since the first quarter of 2009.  Consumer spending  was up 0.2%, sustained by higher spending
on services.  Investment declined as business investment in residential
structures fell 1.2%. New home construction declined and housing
resale activity showed continued weakness. Business investment
in plant and equipment was up 0.2%, following a 1.3% increase in
the previous quarter.  Government final consumption expenditures increased 0.5%,
in line with the previous quarter.  Businesses added $5.9 billion worth of goods to inventories,
after adding $3.9 billion in the previous quarter.  Mining and oil and gas extraction (+4.1%) was the main
source of industrial growth in the first quarter, as was the
case in the fourth quarter of 2012. Increases were also recorded
in the public sector, the finance and insurance sector, the arts
and entertainment sector, construction, and retail trade.
Following two quarterly declines, manufacturing (+0.1%) also
increased, as gains in non-durable goods manufacturing
outweighed the declines in durable goods production.
Transportation and warehousing, professional services and
administrative services declined.  Expressed at an annualized rate, real GDP expanded 2.5% in
the first quarter. By comparison, real GDP in the  United States 
grew 2.4%.  Exports increase  Exports of goods and services rose 1.5% in the first
quarter, after four weak quarters in 2012.  Exports of goods grew 1.8%, following a 0.5% increase in
the previous quarter. Energy products (+5.1%), metal and non-metallic mineral products (+5.9%) and consumer goods (+4.6%)
were among the major contributors to the increase.  Exports of motor vehicles and parts fell 7.5%, a second
consecutive quarterly decline. Exports of aircraft and other
transportation equipment and parts, and farm, fishing and
intermediate food products were also lower.  Service exports increased 0.2%, after a 1.5% decline in the
previous quarter. The increase was driven by higher exports of
transportation (+1.2%) and travel (+0.6%) services. Commercial
services exports (-0.1%) decreased for a second consecutive
quarter.  Imports higher  Imports of goods and services rose 0.3% in the first
quarter. Imports have increased in all but one quarter since the
second quarter of 2009. The exception was the fourth quarter of
2012 (-0.8%).  Imports of goods advanced 0.7%. Most major categories of
goods imports were up, with metal ores and non-metallic minerals
(+21.3%), basic and industrial chemicals, plastic and rubber
products (+1.9%) and  consumer goods  (+1.0%) contributing most to
the increase. Imports of industrial machinery, equipment and
parts, one of the driving factors behind the growth of imports
since the first half of 2009, were up 1.3% for the quarter.  Imports of energy products fell 4.3%, after three
consecutive quarters of growth. Imports of metal and non-metallic mineral products (-3.2%) were lower for a second
consecutive quarter.  Service imports decreased 1.6%, the second consecutive
decline. Commercial services (-2.6%) and travel services (-1.8%)
were the main sources of weakness.  Business investment in plant and equipment edges up  Business investment in plant and equipment increased
slightly by 0.2% in the first quarter, following a 1.3% gain in
the previous quarter. Business investment in non-residential
structures increased 0.4%, the second consecutive quarterly gain.  Business investment in machinery and equipment fell 0.2%,
the first quarterly decrease since the third quarter of 2011.
Industrial machinery and equipment (+0.6%) and medium and heavy
trucks, buses and other motor vehicles (+1.4%) were the main
sources of strength.  Business outlays on computers and computer peripheral
equipment (-3.1%) and communications and audio and video
equipment (-0.5%) were both lower.  Housing investment weakens  Business investment in residential construction fell 1.2%
in the first quarter, the third consecutive quarterly decline.  The value of new  home construction  fell 2.9%, the first
decline since the first quarter of 2011. Renovation activity
(+0.6%) increased for the third straight quarter. Ownership
transfer costs (-0.5%) were down for a fourth consecutive
quarter, indicating continued weakness in housing resale
activity.  Inventory accumulation strengthens  Businesses added $5.9 billion worth of goods to inventories
in the first quarter, $2.0 billion more than was added in the
previous quarter.  Manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers all added to their
stocks of durable and non-durable goods. Inventories of motor
vehicles at the retail level were up substantially (+$3.6
billion). Other non-farm inventories were lower, following a
significant increase in the previous quarter.  Farm inventories declined $1.7 billion, the sixth
consecutive quarterly decrease, as holdings of grains, livestock
and crops were sold off.  The economy-wide ratio of stock to sales was unchanged from
the previous quarter.  Consumer spending continues to rise  Household final consumption expenditure edged up 0.2% in
the first quarter, after growing 0.5% in the previous quarter.
Outlays on goods were flat in the quarter, while spending on
services advanced 0.4%.  Clothing and footwear (+1.3%) and furnishings, household
equipment and other goods and services related to the dwelling
(+0.8%) were among the main contributors to growth in household
spending.  Transport purchases fell slightly by 0.1% as higher outlays
on vehicles (+0.4%) were offset by lower spending on vehicle
operations (-0.2%) and transport services (-1.0%).  Consumption of electricity, gas and other fuels fell 1.1%,
following strong growth in the second half of 2012. Spending on
recreation and culture (-0.7%) was also down, following
increases in the two previous quarters.  Expenditures by Canadians travelling abroad declined 1.3%.  Economy-wide income grows  Nominal GDP increased 0.9% in the first quarter, the
fastest pace in five quarters. This followed a 0.7% increase in
the fourth quarter of 2012.  Compensation of employees rose 0.7%, the same as in the
previous quarter, but weaker than the three-year average of 1.1%.
Wages and salaries in goods-producing industries were up 0.5%,
the slowest pace since the third quarter of 2009. Wages and
salaries in service-producing industries rose 0.8% in the first
quarter.  The net operating surplus of corporations increased 0.5%,
following four quarters of decline. Net operating surplus of
non-financial corporations grew 0.3%, after decreasing
throughout 2012. Financial corporations recorded a 2.9% gain in
net operating surplus in the first quarter of 2013, following
two quarterly declines.  Household savings up  Household final consumption expenditures (in current
dollars) grew 0.6% in the first quarter. Household disposable
income advanced 0.7%, after averaging gains of 1.1% in the
previous nine quarters. The household saving rate rose to 5.5%
from 5.4% in the previous quarter. The rate has trended upward
since hitting a low of 0.9% in the first quarter of 2005.  The household debt service ratio (7.24%), defined as
household mortgage and non-mortgage interest paid divided by
disposable income, remained at a near record low in the first
quarter, reflecting continued low  interest rates .  The national saving rate rose to 5.2% from 3.9% in the
previous quarter. The increase resulted mostly from higher
corporate savings. National disposable income increased 2.2%,
following a 0.2% increase in the fourth quarter of 2012.  Weaker terms of trade  A deterioration in  Canada â€™s terms of trade, resulting from
lower prices for exports relative to imports, tempered the
growth in real gross domestic income to 0.4% in the first
quarter.  Export prices increased 0.6%, while import prices were 1.2%
higher. The overall price of goods and services produced in
Canada rose 0.4%, following a 0.5% gain in the previous quarter.  The price of final domestic demand rose 0.5%, after 0.2%
growth in the fourth quarter of 2012.  Gross domestic product by industry, March 2013  Real gross domestic product grew 0.2% in March, a third
consecutive monthly increase. Mining, quarrying, and oil and gas
extraction, and utilities were the main sources of growth.
Retail trade and the finance and insurance sector also increased.
Manufacturing and wholesale trade declined. Construction and the
public sector (education, health and public administration
combined) were unchanged.  Mining, quarrying and oil and gas extraction grew 1.2% in
March, a sixth consecutive monthly increase. Oil and gas
extraction increased 1.8% on the strength of crude oil
production. Mining excluding oil and gas extraction posted a
gain of 2.3%, mainly due to increases in potash and, to a lesser
extent, coal mining. In contrast, support activities for mining
and oil and gas extraction fell 4.1% as a result of a decline in
rigging services.  Utilities expanded 2.1% in March, after increasing 0.9% in
February, as the demand for both electricity and natural gas
increased.  Retail trade rose 0.5% in March. Increased activity at
motor vehicles and parts dealers, and clothing and clothing
accessories stores led the increase. On the other hand,
wholesale trade declined 0.2%, primarily because of a decrease
in the wholesaling of machinery and equipment, and personal and
household goods.  The finance and insurance sector grew 0.4% in March.
Banking, insurance services and financial investment services
all increased.  Manufacturing declined 0.2% in March, after increasing 0.7%
in February. A decline in durable goods manufacturing more than
offset a slight gain in non-durable goods production. Primary
metal manufacturing, printing and related support activities,
and electrical equipment manufacturing were the main sources of
decline. In contrast, increased production was recorded at
refineries and by manufacturers of beverage and tobacco products.  Construction was unchanged, as a decline in residential
building construction offset increases in engineering and non-residential building construction. The output of real estate
agents and brokers rose in March.  Note to readers  For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonal
adjustment and identifying economic trends
( http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/bsolc/olc-cel/colc-cel?catno=11-010-X201000311141&amp;lang=fra ).  Percentage changes for expenditure-based and industry-based
statistics (such as personal expenditures, investment, exports,
imports and output) are calculated from volume measures that are
adjusted for price variations. Percentage changes for income-based and flow-of-funds statistics (such as labour income,
corporate profits, mortgage borrowing and total funds raised)
are calculated from nominal values; that is, they are not
adjusted for price variations.  There are four ways of expressing growth rates for gross
domestic product (GDP) and other time series found in this
release.  1. Unless otherwise stated, the growth rates of all
quarterly data in this release represent the percentage change
in the series from one quarter to the next, such as from the
fourth quarter of 2012 to the first quarter of 2013.  2. Quarterly growth can be expressed at an annual rate by
using a compound growth formula, similar to the way in which a
monthly interest rate can be expressed at an annual rate.
Expressing growth at an annual rate facilitates comparisons with
official GDP statistics from the United States. Both the
quarterly growth rate and the annualized quarterly growth rate
should be interpreted as an indication of the latest trend in
GDP.  3. The year-over-year growth rate is the percentage change
in GDP from a given quarter in one year to the same quarter one
year later, such as from the first quarter of 2012 to the first
quarter of 2013.  4. The growth rates of all monthly data in this article
represent the percentage change in the series from one month to
the next, such as from February to March 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
