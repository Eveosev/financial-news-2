Bruce Springsteen , a fun dog show, an Andy Warhol watch and a concrete soccer ball are our choices for  London  this weekend.  STAGE  A lovebitten guy named Greg surreptitiously follows his sweetheart Ginny to Buckinghamshire so he can meet her parents.  In Alan Ayckbourn’s “Relatively Speaking,” Greg barges in on his would-be in-laws, Philip and Sheila, as they’re having breakfast in a quaint English garden. There’s only one problem: Philip isn’t Ginny’s dad. He’s her lover.  What follows is a series of hilarious quid pro quos that make this 1967 farce a good night out. The other bonus: Felicity Kendal in the role of the scatterbrained mother. At the Wyndham’s Theatre, 32 Charing Cross Road, WC2H 0DA. Information:  http://www.delfontmackintosh.co.uk  or +44-844-482-5136.  DINING  Tennis is not the only attraction at Wimbledon (which this weekend feature the third-round singles matches).  Lawn Bistro, in Wimbledon Village, serves fine food from chef Ollie Couillaud, who previously ran Bord’eaux, on  Park Lane . Prices are low for the quality: The set lunch is 22.50 pounds ($34.33) for three courses, such as glazed fish quenelles with buttered spinach and Champagne veloute. Information:  http://www.thelawnbistro.co.uk/  or +44-20-8947-8278.  Hutong restaurant opened this week on Level 33 of the Shard, serving dishes from north  China . At its best, the food matches the panoramic views of London. Information:  http://www.aquahutong.co.uk/  or +44-20-7478-0540.  VISUAL ARTS  A chunk of the security wall between  Israel  and the  West Bank  is on temporary display in a Bond Street gallery.  Palestinian artist  Khaled Jarrar  chipped at the barrier and came up with 53 kilos of rubble which he Fed-Exed to London. The concrete was then used to build a tall wall for display.  Jarrar (a former captain in the presidential guard) has other wall-derived sculptures: soccer balls, ping-pong rackets, sports shoes. They’re both sad and funny -- like his films, including one of two guys playing badminton over a wall that’s supposed to keep the two communities apart.  Through Aug. 3 at the Ayyam Gallery, 143 New Bond Street, London W1S 2TP. Information:  http://www.ayyamgallery.com  or call +44-208-969-3959.  MUSIC  Hardcore rock fans will be heading to the Glastonbury Festival for the  Rolling Stones . There’s plenty in London for those who don’t fancy sleeping in a tent.  Springsteen tops the bill at Hard Rock Calling, hoping for a smoother experience than when he last played the event: He was silenced because of a noise curfew at Hyde Park last year. The festival has now moved east to the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, which is less central and has fewer time limits. The Boss plays Sunday, with Kasabian headlining on Saturday. Information:  http://www.hardrockcalling.co.uk   OTHER LONDON OUTINGS  Any plans for Saturday? If your paws are polished, you may like to go walkies to  Pup Idol 2013  at the Spaniards Inn, on Hampstead Heath. It’s a not-too-serious dog show. The four-legged contestants will be judged by Michelle Collins of Coronation Street and Peter Egan of Downtown Abbey. The event raises money to rescue and find homes for dogs. The day starts at 11 a.m. Information:  http://bit.ly/1cmLtSu .  Otherwise, you can always buy yourself an 16,800 pound Warhol watch.  Designed for Movado in 1987, the five-dial timepiece (one per zone) is available from Somlo Antiques at the plush Masterpiece London fair in Chelsea.  Other highlights: Lichtenstein’s 1978 “Puzzle Portrait” (offered “for eight figures” by dealer Geoffrey Diner) and a wondrous Renaissance pearl that Mary Tudor is said to have worn. And as you browse the many booths flaunting clocks and cabinets, stop at Jorge Welsh to ogle some exquisite porcelain.  The fair ends July 3 on the South Grounds of the Royal Hospital Chelsea.
