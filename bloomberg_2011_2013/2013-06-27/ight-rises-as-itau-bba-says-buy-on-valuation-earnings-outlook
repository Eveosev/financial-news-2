Light SA (LIGT3) ,  Brazil ’s second-cheapest
power utility on a price-to-earnings basis, rallied as Itau BBA
recommended buying the stock after the company increased its
projection for earnings through 2016.  Shares  rose  4.5 percent to 15.68 reais at 2:14 p.m. in Sao
Paulo after rallying 4.9 percent, their biggest intraday advance
since June 13. The stock was the best performer on the MSCI
Brazil/Utilities  index , which added 3.2 percent.  Light’s 30 percent decline this year is “exaggerated” by
excessive pessimism on how much regulators will allow the
company to charge its customers, Itau analysts Marcos Severine,
Mariana Coelho and Gabriel Laera wrote in a research note to
clients yesterday. “The stock seems to have reached an
attractive point at which we believe a worst-case scenario is
already more than priced in.”  The utility trades at 5.92 times its estimated earnings in
the next 12 months, about one-third the average of Brazilian
electricity companies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That is the lowest level after Cia. Energetica de  Sao Paulo .  Light said yesterday in a regulatory filing that it expects
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
to grow at an average annual pace of 8 percent and reach 1.98
billion reais ($907 million) in 2016. Ebitda  rose  18 percent in
2012 to 1.46 billion reais. Itau projects Ebitda of 1 billion
reais this year and 1.48 billion reais in 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
