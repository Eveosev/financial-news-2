Libyan authorities barred black
citizens in a convoy of about 40 vehicles from returning home to
Tuwaregha, a former Muammar Qaddafi bastion on the western
coast, Human Rights Watch said today.  The Tuwareghans left the eastern city of Benghazi three
days ago and traveled for about 150 kilometers (90 miles), as
far as Ajdabiya, before being turned back, the New York-based
organization said in a statement today. It called on the central
government to ensure their safe return.  Tuwareghans fled their hometown in August 2011 as anti-Qaddafi fighters from the nearby city of Misrata approached.
About 35,000 have been living in camps across Libya ever since,
prevented from returning by Misratan militias. A mass return
scheduled for June 25 was called off at the last minute by
Tuwareghan leaders, shortly after Prime Minister Ali Zaidan said
their security could not be assured.  Tensions between the two towns run deep. Residents of
Misrata say Tuwareghans backed Qaddafi during the war and that
their militias raped their women and pillaged the southern
outskirts of their city during a bloody six-month siege.
Tuwareghans say the entire community is being harassed and
targeted because of the crimes of a few.  The return of Tuwareghans is one of the thorniest issues
facing Libyan authorities two years after the removal of
Qaddafi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
