an initial public offering of French floor maker Tarkett SA,

selected, the people said, asking not to be identified as the
process isnâ€™t public. The IPO could raise about 500 million
euros ($651 million) and is planned for the second half of the
year, the people said.  KKR, the private-equity firm run by  Henry Kravis  and  George
Roberts , sought to sell its 50 percent stake in Tarkett this
year in a deal that would have valued the firm at as much as
$3.8 billion, people familiar said March 12.  Tarkett, which manufactures and sells PVC, wood, laminate,
sports and other specialty flooring products, increased sales 11
percent to 2.3 billion euros in 2012, helped by acquisitions and
demand in Eastern Europe, Asia and  North America . The company,
based in the Paris suburb of Nanterre, has been jointly owned by
KKR and the Deconinck family since 2007.  Spokesmen for KKR, Bank of America, JPMorgan, HSBC and
Deutsche Bank declined to comment on any process.  To contact the reporters on this story:
