DirecTV (DTV) , the largest U.S. satellite-TV provider, will take a pretax charge of $25 million after an
internal investigation found that it had overstated subscriber
numbers in Brazil by hundreds of thousands.  Beginning in 2012, some Sky Brasil employees improperly
credited customer accounts to reduce or eliminate churn, the El
Segundo, California-based company said in a filing. The number
of Sky Brasil subscribers on December 31 was about 100,000 lower
than previously reported to Brazilian regulators and 200,000
lower than cited on March 31, the company said.  DirecTV, which had considered buying Vivendi SA’s Brazilian
phone and Internet unit before withdrawing from a bidding war in
March, reported a record number of Latin American customers in
the first quarter. Gross additions in the region jumped 14
percent to 1.2 million in the first quarter, driven by demand in
 Brazil , Argentina and  Colombia .  Sky Brasil’s ongoing churn in Brazil will be higher than
previously anticipated, the company said today. The $25 million
expense covers capitalized installation costs and subscriber
related equipment held by the terminated customers, according to
the filing.  DirecTV fell 0.6 percent to $60.73 at the close in  New
York . The shares have advanced 21 percent this year, while the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 13 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
