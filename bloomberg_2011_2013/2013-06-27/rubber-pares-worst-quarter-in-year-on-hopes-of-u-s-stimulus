Rubber recovered from a nine-month
low, paring the biggest quarterly decline in a year, amid
optimism the U.S. Federal Reserve will maintain stimulus after
slower-than-estimated growth in the U.S. economy.  The contract for delivery in December gained 1.3 percent to
end at 230.1 yen a kilogram ($2,345 a metric ton) on the  Tokyo 
Commodity Exchange. Futures have lost 16 percent this quarter,
the most since the three months ended June 2012.  Asian stocks extended a global rebound, following gains of
U.S. indexes after the world’s biggest economy revised its
reading for first-quarter growth lower and as a drop in Chinese
 interest-rate swaps  eased concerns over a cash crunch.  “The U.S. GDP revision lower yesterday makes market
participants believe that the Fed’s tapering might be
postponed,” said Naohiro Niimura, a partner at research company
Market Risk Advisory Co. in Tokyo.  Rubber for January delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange added 0.7 percent to close at 17,760  yuan  ($2,888) a
ton. Natural-rubber inventories rose for a third week, climbing
48 tons to 114,556 tons, the bourse said June 21.  Thai rubber free-on-board remained unchanged at 85.40 baht
($2.74) a kilogram today, according to the Rubber Research
Institute of  Thailand . Rain spreads across 40 percent to 60
percent of the Thai south, the country’s main plantation area,
disrupting tapping, the institute said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
