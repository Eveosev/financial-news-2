Russia  plans to ship less than a
million barrels a day of Urals crude from Primorsk port for a
second month, little changed from June, which was the lowest in
more than five years, a preliminary loading program showed.  Primorsk on the  Baltic Sea  will export 38 cargoes of
100,000 metric tons each and one shipment of 30,000 tons in
July. The shipments will total 3.83 million tons, or 905,610
barrels a day, down 2.5 percent from this month, the schedule
obtained by  Bloomberg News  showed. Prior to June, the port had
 loaded  more than a million barrels a day every month since at
least March 2008, when Bloomberg began tracking the data.  Exports from Primorsk for June were revised down to 3.8
million tons from 3.9 million tons after one unassigned position
failed to be filled. Russia is the worldâ€™s largest energy
exporter.  Ust-Luga, also on the Baltic, will ship 19 cargoes of
100,000 tons each, unchanged from June, according to the
program. That amounts to 449,258 barrels a day.  Exports from Novorossiysk on the  Black Sea  will reach 3.235
million tons in July, or 764,921 barrels a day, up 5.7 percent
from June. The July schedule includes four 80,000-ton cargoes of
Siberian Light grade and 27 Urals cargoes.  Novorossiysk has one unassigned slot of 80,000 tons and
Ust-Luga has one 100,000-ton position available next month,
according to the program.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
