The  Memphis Grizzlies  promoted
assistant Dave Joerger, who won five minor-league basketball
championships as a coach, to replace Lionel Hollins.  Joerger, 39, spent the past six National Basketball
Association seasons as an assistant in Memphis to Hollins, who
wasn’t offered a new contract earlier this month.  Before joining the Grizzlies, Joerger coached the Dakota
Wizards to an NBA D-League championship in 2007 and also won
three titles in the Continental Basketball Association and one
in the International Basketball Association.  Joerger takes over a team that had a franchise-best 56-26
record this season and reached the Western Conference finals
before losing to the San Antonio Spurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
