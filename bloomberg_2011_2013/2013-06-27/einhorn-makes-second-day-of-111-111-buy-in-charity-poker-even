Hedge-fund manager David Einhorn is among a 166-person field for a $111,111 buy-in charity event at the  World Series of Poker , joining several others from the world of finance.  Einhorn, the president of New York-based Greenlight Capital Inc., is 42nd of 108 remaining players in the “One Drop High Roller,” a no-limit Texas hold’em tournament that began yesterday at the Rio All-Suite Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas.  Einhorn, 44, has 519,000 chips, while 39-year-old Brandon Steven, the owner of  Brandon Steven Motors  in Wichita,  Kansas , is the current chip leader with almost 1.4 million. The tournament began yesterday and probably will conclude on June 29, with the winner claiming more than $4.8 million.  Dan Shak, founder of Las Vegas-based SHK Asset Management, is third with 999,000 chips.  Dan Perper, managing director of Chicago-based Peak6 Investments LP, is 36th with 560,000 chips. Bill Perkins, the founder of Houston-based Skylar Capital Management, is 46th with 485,000 chips. Among those eliminated during Day 1 play were Talal Shakerchi of Meditor Capital Management Ltd. in  London ; Chamath Palihapitiya, manager partner at the Social+Capital Partnership; and Silicon Valley software pioneer Roger Sippl of Sippl Investments LLC.  This is the 47th of 62 poker tournaments that make up this year’s World Series, which concludes with the $10,000 buy-in No-Limit Texas Hold’Em World Championship, known as the main event. The current tournament is Einhorn’s first appearance at the series this year.  Pro Win  The biggest charity event at last year’s World Series of Poker was a $1 million buy-in event that was won by poker professional Antonio Esfandiari, who earned $18.3 million. Esfandiari is currently 56th with 445,000 chips.  Einhorn finished third in the million-dollar buy-in event last year, after which he said he planned to donate all of his $4.35 million in winnings to the charity City Year.  With a portion of buy-ins from this event and a $1,111 buy-in event later in the World Series set aside for charity, the money will go to One Drop, the non-profit started by Cirque du Soleil founder Guy Laliberte, which strives to make water accessible to people around the world.  Among the poker pros eliminated on Day 1 were Phil Ivey, Michael Mizrachi, Erik Seidel, Erick Lindgren and Jonathan Duhamel.
