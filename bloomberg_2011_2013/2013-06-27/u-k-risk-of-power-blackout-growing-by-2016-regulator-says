The risks that the U.K. suffers a
major power blackout will rise toward the middle of the decade
as aging generators retire from  service , the nation’s energy
regulator said.  Ofgem said the margin of electricity supply capacity over
demand could narrow to between 2 percent and 5 percent by 2015
and 2016. That means the statistical risk of a disruption rises
to once every 12 years by 2016 from once in every 47 years now,
the regulator said in a statment today.  “Ofgem’s latest report on electricity security of supply
highlights the need for reform to encourage investment in
generation,” said Andrew Wright, chief executive officer of
Ofgem.  To contact the reporter on this story:
