Grain regions in  Western Australia ,
set to be the country’s biggest wheat producer, may receive no
rain for the next three days, boosting concern that dry weather
will increase crop stress.  The state’s southwest is forecast to remain dry through to
June 30, according to a  model  on the Bureau of Meteorology’s
website. Grain regions in eastern parts of New South Wales may
get as much as 10 millimeters (0.4 inches) in the period.  Western Australia is set to overtake New South Wales as
Australia’s biggest wheat producer this year, helping increase
national production 15 percent to 25.4 million metric tons, the
government estimates. Wheat in Chicago has tumbled 13 percent
this year as the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  expects global
production will climb 6.1 percent as bigger harvests in
Australia and Canada counter a smaller U.S. crop.  “Much of the Western Australia grain belt has observed
less than 40 percent of the normal monthly rainfall in June,”
placing stress on crops,  Luke Mathews , a commodity strategist at
 Commonwealth Bank of Australia  wrote in a note today. “A
significant improvement in rainfall is required in July to place
Western Australia yield potentials back on track.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
