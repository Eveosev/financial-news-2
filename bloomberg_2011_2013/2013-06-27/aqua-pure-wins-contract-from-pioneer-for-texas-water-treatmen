Aqua-Pure Ventures Inc. (AQE) , which
recycles wastewater from oil and natural gas drilling
operations, won a contract with  Pioneer Natural Resources Co. (PXD)   Aqua-Pure’s Fountain Quail Water Management subsidiary will
install two recycling water-treatment units at Pioneer
operations in the Permian Basin in  Texas , the Calgary-based
company said today in a statement. The agreement in which a fee
will be received based on how much water is treated will boost
Aqua-Pure’s annual revenue by about $5 million, it said.  “This is our second engagement of this magnitude in the
oil-rich Permian Basin,” said Richard Broderick, head of
business development for Aqua-Pure. The company, whose shares
climbed 16 percent today in Canada trading, the most intra-day
in a month, is valued at C$10.1 million ($9.6 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
