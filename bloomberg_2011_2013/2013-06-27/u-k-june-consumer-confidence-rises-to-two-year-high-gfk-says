U.K.  consumer confidence  rose to its
highest in more than two years this month as a brightening
economy made Britons more willing to spend on big-ticket items.  A consumer sentiment index by GfK NOP Ltd. gained one point
to minus 21, the best reading since May 2011, the London-based
group said in a report published today. A gauge of the economic
outlook for the coming year climbed 2 points to minus 16. A
measure of whether now is the right time to make major purchases
jumped 5 points to minus 20.  While the economy is showing signs of strength after
resuming growth in the first quarter, data yesterday showed
Britons’ disposable income plunged the most in 26 years in the
 first quarter  as inflation outpaces pay growth.  Bank of England 
Governor  Mervyn King , who retires on June 30, said this week
that a recovery “is in sight,” though it’s “too weak to be
satisfactory.”  “The overall trend in confidence over the last year is
clearly upwards,” said Nick Moon, managing director of social
research at GfK. “So the paradox is that while we are getting
worse and worse off, we are feeling more positive,”  GfK surveyed 2,007 people from May 31 to June 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
