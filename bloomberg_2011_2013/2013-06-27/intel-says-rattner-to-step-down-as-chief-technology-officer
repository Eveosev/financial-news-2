Intel Corp. (INTC) , the world’s largest
computer-chip maker, said Justin Rattner will step down as chief
technology officer and director of Intel Labs.  Rattner will go on personal leave immediately to handle a
family matter, and will return later in a role to be determined,
the company said today in a blog post. His transition out of the
CTO role is required under Intel’s bylaws, which say employees
may not serve as corporate officers past age 65.  The executive joined Intel in 1973, and was named its first
principal engineer in 1979. Intel Labs staff will report to
President Renee James until further leadership decisions are
made, the company said.  Intel Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich, who took the
helm last month, thanked Rattner “for his leadership in
creating one of the leading research organizations in the high
tech industry,” according to the blog post.  To contact the reporter on this story:
