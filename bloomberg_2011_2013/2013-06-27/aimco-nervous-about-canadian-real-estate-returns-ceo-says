Alberta Investment Management Corp.,
a Canadian pension-fund manager with about C$70 billion ($66.8
billion) in assets, expects returns from Canadian real estate to
decline, said Chief Executive Officer Leo de Bever.  “Real estate is one of the things that keeps me awake,”
de Bever said in a briefing with journalists today from his
office in  Edmonton . “The kind of returns we’ve seen of 10
percent is not sustainable.”  AIMCo, as the fund is known, has about C$8 billion worth of
real estate assets, including C$2.5 billion in Calgary and
Edmonton, de Bever said. Long-term returns from real estate
investments are likely to decline to match equities in the “7,
8 or 9 percent” range, he said.  Canada ’s fourth-biggest pension-fund manager posted a 10
percent net return on investments last year, beating the
benchmark return of 8.2 percent, according to its annual report
released today.  AIMCo, as the Edmonton, Alberta-based fund is known, has
focused on investments in food, energy and materials.  To contact the reporter on this story:
