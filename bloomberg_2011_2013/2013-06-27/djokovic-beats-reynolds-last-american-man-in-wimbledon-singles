 Top seed Novak Djokovic beat Bobby
Reynolds, leaving the U.S. without a man in the third round of
Wimbledon for the first time since 1912.  The Serb defeated the last American male in the draw 7-6
(7-2), 6-3, 6-1. Eleven American men started this yearâ€™s event.
In the 1912 tournament, no men from the U.S. traveled to the All
England Club.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
