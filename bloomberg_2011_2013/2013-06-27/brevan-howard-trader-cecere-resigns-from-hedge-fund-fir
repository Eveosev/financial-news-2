Christopher Cecere, who Japanese
regulators accused of trying to manipulate  interest rates  when
he worked at  Citigroup Inc. (C) , has resigned from hedge-fund firm
Brevan Howard Asset Management LLP.  Cecere, an American who worked in Brevan Howard’s Geneva
office, stepped down last week for “personal reasons,” said
Max Hilton, a spokesman for the London-based firm at Peregrine
Communications. Cecere worked for Citigroup in Tokyo as head of
Group of 10 trading and sales for Asia before leaving the New
York-based bank in 2010.  Japan’s Financial Services Agency said in a December 2010
administrative case that Cecere and another trader asked bankers
to alter data they submitted while setting a benchmark Japanese
lending rate. The regulator penalized Citigroup without taking
action against the employees. Cecere, in a February 2012
interview, denied wrongdoing, saying regulators never questioned
him and that he left Citigroup in good standing.  Cecere didn’t respond to a message left on his mobile phone
or an e-mail today. His resignation from  Brevan Howard  was
reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal.  Brevan Howard, with $40.1 billion of assets under
management, is Europe’s second-biggest hedge-fund firm after  Man
Group Plc. (EMG)   To contact the reporter on this story:
