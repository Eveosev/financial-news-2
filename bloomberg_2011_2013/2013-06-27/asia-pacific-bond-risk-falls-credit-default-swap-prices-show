The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region from non-payment
declined, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  slid 10 basis points to 150 basis points
as of 9:01 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
prices show. That pares the gaugeâ€™s advance to 33.6 basis points
this month and 27.8 basis points this quarter, according to data
provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index retreated 6 basis points
to 136 as of 10:39 a.m. in Sydney, National Australia Bank Ltd.
prices show. The benchmark is set for its lowest close since
June 19, reducing its rise since May 31 to 23.6 basis points and
its advance this quarter to 13, according to CMA, which is owned
by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell 5.5 basis points to 112
basis points as of 9:43 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices
show. The measure, which has increased 15.5 basis points in
June, is down 1 basis point this quarter, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
