Deloitte LLP and the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration announced a joint
partnership to help oil and natural gas companies reduce the
risk of so-called black swan disasters such as  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Macondo
spill.  Exploration in the oilfield and in outer space share
similar risks, including harsh environments, remote operations,
complex engineering and a heavy reliance on contractors, David
Traylor, principal at Deloitte, said today in a signing ceremony
at  NASA ’s Johnson Space Center in Houston.  “How often has there been a Macondo?” William McArthur, a
former astronaut now in charge of NASA’s safety and mission
assurance program, told reporters after the announcement.
“That’s the primary thing we’ll look at.”  Deloitte’s Houston-based Center for Energy Solutions has
talked with super majors, independent producers and midstream
companies about the new service with NASA, John England, head of
Deloitte’s oil and gas practice, said.  In addition to improved risk modeling from NASA, Deloitte
will offer its oil and gas customers the space agency’s
experience in operating with its rigorous safety checks, Traylor
said.  NASA acknowledged its safety experience has come the hard
way.  “A smart person learns from his mistake,” said McArthur,
a retired U.S. Army colonel who flew on three space shuttle
missions and lived for about six months on the International
Space Station. “We’re pretty smart here at NASA because we made
a lot of mistakes.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
