Duke Street Capital Ltd., owner of
Britain’s Wagamama restaurant chain, agreed to sell a stake in
itself to a French investment firm after dropping plans to raise
a new private-equity fund last year.  Duke Street agreed to sell a 35 percent stake to Paris-based Tikehau Group, the companies said in an e-mailed
statement. Financial terms of the transaction weren’t disclosed.
Tikehau said it will provide “committed capital” enabling the
private equity firm to make new investments.  To contact the reporters on this story:
