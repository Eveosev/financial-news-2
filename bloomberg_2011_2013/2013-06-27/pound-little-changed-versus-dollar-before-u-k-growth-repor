U.K. bonds advanced and the pound
dropped to a three-week low versus the dollar as data revisions
showed gross domestic product shrank more than previously
estimated from its peak in 2008 to the depths of the recession.  Ten-year  gilt yields  slid to the lowest in almost a week as
a report showed Britons’ disposable income plunged the most in
25 years in the first quarter, even as the economy grew. U.K.
GDP contracted 7.2 percent from its peak, more than the 6.3
percent previously estimated, the  Office for National Statistics 
said in London. Sterling fell yesterday after  Bank of England 
policy maker  David Miles  said the economy may still need more
support and renewed his call for more asset purchases.  “The original recession in 2008-2009 was deeper than we
first thought so that shows there’s more of a hurdle to clear,”
said  Sam Hill , a fixed-income strategist at Royal Bank of Canada
in London. “We are expecting monetary policy to remain loose,
which will underpin gilts.”  Benchmark 10-year gilt yields fell four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 2.42 percent at 4:37 p.m. London time
after reaching 2.39 percent, the least since June 21. The 1.75
percent security due September 2022 rose 0.29, or 2.90 pounds
per 1,000-pound ($1,523) face amount, to 94.505. The rate
dropped eight basis points yesterday, matching the most since
March 1.  Thirty-year (GUKG30)  yields dropped three basis points to 3.57
percent.  Economy Grows  Britain’s economy expanded 0.3 percent in the three months
through March after shrinking 0.3 percent in the final three
months of 2012, the ONS said. That was unchanged from an initial
estimate and was forecast by most economists in a Bloomberg News
 survey . Real household disposable income fell 1.7 percent from
the previous three months, the biggest drop since 1987, the
report showed.  BOE Governor Mervyn King said this week that recent data is
“too weak to be satisfactory.” King will be replaced as
central-bank chief by former Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney 
next month.  “The data suggest the economy remains weak and is still
failing to achieve the desired rebalancing,”  Michael Saunders ,
an economist at Citigroup Inc wrote in a note to clients.
“Pretty much the only thing that looks stronger is the case for
extra stimulus.”  U.K. government bonds also advanced as investors awaited
further signals on Federal Reserve stimulus. The  U.S. economy  is
set for “a couple more years of sluggish growth” and the
central bank is not close to decreasing its balance sheet, Fed
Bank of Richmond President  Jeffrey Lacker  said yesterday.  Bond Returns  Ten-year gilt yields jumped 35 basis points last week, the
most since January 2009, after Fed President  Ben S. Bernanke 
signaled policy makers may start reducing their asset-purchase
program this year if economic growth is in line with central-bank projections. The 10-year rate is poised for a 65 basis-point  gain  this quarter, the biggest increase since June 2008.  U.K. gilts handed investors a loss of 3.6 percent this year
through yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes.
German bonds dropped 1.9 percent and Treasuries declined 2.8
percent, the indexes show.  The pound fell 0.6 percent to $1.5230 after touching
$1.5202, the lowest level since June 3. The U.K. currency
weakened 0.6 percent to 85.47 pence per euro.  “Sterling has softened,” said Jane Foley, a senior
currency strategist at Rabobank International in  London . “Some
people were expecting an upward revision and that didn’t
happen,” she said, referring to the GDP data. “The outlook for
Fed tapering will be key as we progress in to the summer.”  Fed Tapering  The pound will advance to $1.57 in the next three months,
Foley predicted, as expectations for Fed tapering fade. The
median estimate in a Bloomberg survey is for Britain’s currency
to end the third quarter at $1.51.  The pound has strengthened 3.6 percent in the past three
months, according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes,
which track 10 developed-market currencies. The euro gained 5
percent and the dollar climbed 2.9 percent.  The  index shows  Britain’s currency has advanced 3.2 percent
so far this quarter, heading for the biggest increase since
September 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
