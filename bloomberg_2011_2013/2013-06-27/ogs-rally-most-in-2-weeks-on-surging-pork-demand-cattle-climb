Hog futures rose, heading for the
biggest gain in two weeks, on signs of increasing demand for
U.S. pork. Cattle prices also advanced.  U.S. pork-export  sales  totaled 18,607 metric tons (41.02

$1.1133 a pound yesterday, the highest since at least October
1997, government data show.  “Product value just keeps exploding,” Lou Arens, a broker
at PCI Advisory Services in Waucoma,  Iowa , said in a telephone
interview.  Hog futures for August settlement added 1.3 percent to 98.9
cents a pound at 9:52 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
