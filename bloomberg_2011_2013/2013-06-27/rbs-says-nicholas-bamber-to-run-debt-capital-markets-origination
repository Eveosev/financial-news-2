Nicholas Bamber has been appointed
head of  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc ’s newly-created western
European debt capital markets origination unit.  Bamber, the former head of investment-grade corporate bond
origination and private placements, will lead the bank’s
combined loan capital markets and corporate bond origination
departments, according to Rebecca Nelson, a spokeswoman for the
Edinburgh-based lender.  The appointment follows the departure of Pippa Crawford as
head of western European loan capital markets for personal
reasons, Nelson said in an interview. She was appointed last
September, according to a statement at the time.  Crawford helped arrange deals including Glencore Xstrata
Plc’s $17.3 billion debt refinancing completed this month, the
largest corporate  credit line  for a European company in more
than six years, and Acromas’s 3.4 billion-pound ($5.2 billion)
refinancing, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Crawford is moving to  Australia  this year to join husband
Bart Campbell, she said in an an e-mailed statement.  Campbell led a group of investors buying the National Rugby
League’s  Melbourne Storm  club from  Rupert Murdoch ’s News Ltd.,
the NRL said in a  statement  in May. Campbell is chief operating
officer of Chime Communications’s sports division, CSM Sport &
Entertainment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
