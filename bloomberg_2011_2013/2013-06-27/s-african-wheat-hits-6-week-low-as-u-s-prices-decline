South African wheat futures fell to
the lowest level in more than six weeks after the condition of
the spring crop in the U.S., the biggest exporter, improved.  Wheat for delivery in July fell for a fifth day, declining
1 percent to 3,478 rand ($349.20) a metric ton by the midday
close on the South African Futures Exchange in Johannesburg, the
lowest since May 13.  The grain capped its longest slump in six months on the
Chicago Board of Trade yesterday when it slid 1.2 percent to
$6.77 a bushel. About 70 percent of spring wheat was in good or
excellent condition on June 23, from 68 percent the previous
week and 64 percent a year ago, according to U.S. Department of
Agriculture data.  “Wheat prices went down following U.S. prices due to the
crop condition being better than expected,” Kobus Theron, a
trader at Suidwes Holdings in Klerksdorp,  South Africa , said by
phone today. “This means a higher amount of wheat will be
available later this year.”  South  Africa , a net importer of wheat, is sub-Saharan
Africa’s largest producer of the grain after  Ethiopia  and the
region’s biggest importer after Nigeria and Sudan, according to
USDA data.  White Corn for delivery in December dropped 0.3 percent to
2,362 rand a ton, while the yellow variety increased 0.1 percent
to 2,256 rand a ton. Meal from white corn is a staple food while
the yellow kind is mainly used as  animal feed  in South Africa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
