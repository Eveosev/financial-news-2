Navistar International Corp. (NAV)  named a
new finance chief as Chief Executive Officer Troy Clarke revamps
his management team.  Walter Borst, 51, was named chief financial officer. He
had been chief executive officer of General Motors Co.’s GM
Asset Management unit. Clarke, who became CEO earlier this year,
is also a former GM executive. Borst replaces Andrew Cederoth,
whose departure was announced earlier this week.  Navistar is trying to end  losses . The Lisle, Illinois-based
truckmaker ousted Dan Ustian as CEO in August after an inquiry
from regulators about its accounting and disclosures. Lewis
Campbell, a former CEO of  Textron Inc. (TXT) , took the helm as interim
head of the company before yielding to Clarke.  Navistar also installed Jack Allenas chief operating
officer in April.  The company’s shares rose 2.1 percent to $27.99 at the
close in  New York . Navistar have surged 29 percent this year,
compared with a 13 percent rise for the Russell 1000 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
