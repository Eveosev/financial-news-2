Resverlogix Corp. (RVX)  sank the most on
record after saying its drug to fight thickening of the arteries
failed to meet its primary target in a phase 2 clinical trial.  Resverlogix, based in Calgary,  plunged  93 percent to 23
cents at 4 p.m. in Toronto, the most since its initial public
offering in 2001. The stock has now fallen 86 percent this year,
giving it a market value of C$17.2 million ($16.4 million).  Test results from a 26-week Phase 2b clinical trial showed
patients treated with the RVX-208 drug had a 0.4 percent
reduction in plaque levels, short of the 0.6 percent target
drop.  “We remain focused on analyzing the full data set over the
coming weeks and months to determine whether continued
development of RVX-208 in cardiovascular disease is warranted,”
Donald McCaffrey, Resverlogix’s chief executive officer, said in
a statement.  The drug is intended to work by boosting production of a
particle required in a process called reverse cholesterol
transport, in which plaque in the arteries is removed from the
body using the liver.  To contact the reporter on this story:
