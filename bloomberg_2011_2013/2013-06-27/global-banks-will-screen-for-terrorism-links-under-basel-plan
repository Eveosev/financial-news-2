Global banks will have to vet all
customers for terrorism links as part of a crackdown on money
laundering and criminal finance.  Terrorist screening “should be carried out irrespective of
the risk profile attributed to the customer,” the  Basel 
Committee on Banking Supervision said in proposals published
today. Lenders should immediately freeze any assets from clients
that fail the test, according to the guidelines.  Regulators around the world have cracked down on money
laundering after the 2008 financial crisis. The U.S. fined  HSBC
Holdings Plc (HSBA)  $1.9 billion last year over claims the lender gave
terrorists and drug cartels access to the U.S. financial system.
Standard Chartered Plc also agreed to pay $667 million to U.S.
regulators after they alleged the bank helped  Iran  launder $250
billion. The U.K. has fined three banks for failing to have
effective anti-money laundering controls in place for high-risk
customers.  The decision “to enter into or pursue business
relationships with higher-risk customers should entail enhanced
due diligence measures, such as approval to enter into or
continue such relationships, being taken by senior management,”
said the committee, which is based in Basel, Switzerland and
comprised of global regulators and central bankers.  To contact the reporters on this story:
