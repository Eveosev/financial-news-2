Tampa Bay Lightning center Vincent Lecavalier will become an unrestricted free agent after the
National Hockey League team said it will buy out the $30 million
and seven years left on the four-time All-Star’s contract.  Lecavalier, the No. 1 pick in the 1998 NHL draft, has
played his entire 14-year career with the Lightning. He will be
free to sign with any other team if he clears buyout waivers on
July 5.  The Lightning will pay $30 million of the $45 million on
Lecavalier’s contract over the next 14 years, clearing $7.7
million in salary over the next seven seasons, the team said on
its website.  “The decision to part ways with Vinny was not made
easily,” Lightning General Manager Steve Yzerman said in a
statement. “The cap hit created by Vinny’s contract is proving
to be prohibitive as we model our roster possibilities for
2013-14 and beyond.”  Lecavalier, 33, is the Lightning’s all-time leader with
1,037 games, 383 goals, 112 power-play goals and 60 game-winning
goals.  He has posted 12 consecutive seasons with 20 goals or more,
helped the Lightning to the 2004 Stanley Cup title and won the
Maurice “Rocket” Richard Trophy as the league’s leading goal-scorer with 52 in 2006-07.  To contact the reporter on this story:
