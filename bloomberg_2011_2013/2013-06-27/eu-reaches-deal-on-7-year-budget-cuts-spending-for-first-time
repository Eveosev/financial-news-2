European Union governments and
lawmakers reached agreement on the bloc’s seven-year budget, as
the economic crisis forced the first spending cuts in EU
history.  Leaders of the  European Parliament  accepted a 960 billion-euro ($1.3 trillion) subsidies package for 2014-2020 as long as
the governments allow some spending to be shifted between annual
budgets. The sum will drop from 994 billion euros in the current
budget cycle.  “This is not an easy compromise,” the parliament’s
president,  Martin Schulz , told reporters in Brussels today. “I
must fight in the European Parliament for a majority, that’s for
sure.” He announced a vote next week.  EU officials touted the budget pact, along with accords on
a farm-policy revamp yesterday and on bank-failure rules early
today, as evidence that the European decision-making machinery
is delivering in the face of a recession and record
unemployment.  Spending -- mainly for agriculture, infrastructure and aid
for poorer regions -- stayed at the level EU government leaders
agreed to supply in February. The parliament built in a review
clause and more flexibility to shift funds around.  “This is a good deal for all Europeans,” European
Commission President  Jose Barroso  told the press conference.
“This is indeed the growth fund for  Europe .”  Government leaders are likely to endorse the deal at a
summit starting later today, Irish Deputy Prime Minister  Eamon Gilmore  said. As holder of the EU presidency, Ireland was in
charge of negotiations with the parliament.  To contact the reporter on this story:
