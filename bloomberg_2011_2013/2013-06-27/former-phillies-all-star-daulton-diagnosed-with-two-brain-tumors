Former Philadelphia Phillies All-Star catcher Darren Daulton was diagnosed with two brain tumors
and will undergo surgery.  Daulton, who played Major League Baseball from 1983 to
1997, hadn’t been feeling well in recent weeks before visiting a
doctor who discovered the tumors, according to a statement
released by 97.5 The Fanatic radio station in Philadelphia, on
which Daulton hosts a show. He’s scheduled for surgery early
next week.  Daulton, 51, played 14 seasons in Philadelphia before
finishing his final season with the Florida Marlins, who won the
World Series. He was also on the Phillies’ team that took the
National League pennant in 1993.  Daulton had a .245 career batting average with 137 home
runs and 588 runs batted in, earning All-Star Game invitations
in 1992, 1993 and 1995.  Nicknamed “Dutch,” Daulton hosts the 97.5 show “Talking
Baseball With Dutch.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
