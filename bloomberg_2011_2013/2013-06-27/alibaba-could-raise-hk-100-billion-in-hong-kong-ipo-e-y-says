Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.,  China ’s
biggest e-commerce company, could raise HK$100 billion ($12.9
billion) if it proceeds with an initial public offering in Hong
Kong this year, according to an estimate by Ernst & Young LLP.  Companies may raise HK$100 billion through initial share
sales in the city this year and the amount would double if a
“mega-size TMT IPO” was completed, the accounting firm said in
a report distributed in Hong Kong yesterday. Ernst & Young was
referring to Alibaba Group’s possible offering in the estimate,
Jacky Lai, a Hong Kong-based assurance partner at the firm said.
TMT refers to telecommunications, media and technology.  An IPO worth HK$100 billion would be  Asia ’s biggest since
October 2010, when  AIA Group Ltd. (1299)  raised HK$159 billion,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Companies have raised
about HK$40 billion in IPOs in  Hong Kong  this year, up from
HK$16 billion in the same period last year, the data show.  Alibaba Group hasn’t made any decision on the timing or
venue of a possible IPO, said John Spelich, a Hong Kong-based
spokesman for the company.  The Hangzhou-based company’s billionaire founder, Jack Ma,
said last year that it may go public within five years. Proceeds
from the sale would be used along with additional cash to buy
back stock held by  Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) , a person with knowledge of the
matter said last month.  Alibaba is worth as much as $100 billion, Eric Qiu, an
analyst at Guosen Securities Co. recently said. Ernst & Young
did not specify how much of a stake it expects Alibaba to sell,
or what the total valuation of the company would be in a HK$100
billion sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
