Ethanol weakened against gasoline
with production recovering from last year’s drought.  The spread, or price difference, widened 0.9 cent to 27.36
cents a gallon, a day after the Energy Information
Administration said  production  last week rose to 885,000 barrels
a day, equaling the most since June 15, 2012. Run rates are
 above-average  for this time of year, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  “Ethanol production is on the upswing,” said  Dan Flynn , a
trader at Price Futures Group in  Chicago .  Denatured ethanol for July delivery increased 0.3 cent to
$2.469 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices are up 13
percent this year.  Gasoline for July delivery rose 1.2 cents, or 0.4 percent,
to $2.7426 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The
contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be blended with
ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol production has exceeded 850,000 barrels a day for
seven weeks in a row, helping  stockpiles  rebound 1.9 percent to
16.3 million barrels from an all-time low on June 7. Production
sank to 770,000 barrels a day in the week of Jan. 25, the lowest
level since the EIA began weekly records in 2010.  Compliance with a law that requires refiners to use 13.8
billion gallons of ethanol in gasoline is tracked by Renewable
Identification Numbers, or RINs. Companies can submit the
credits to the government or trade them.  Ethanol RINs  Corn-based ethanol RINs  rose 1 cent to 95 cents while
 advanced RINs , which cover biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol decreased 1 cent to $1.01, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Ethanol is made from corn in the U.S., where the
Agriculture Department estimated June 12 that the harvest for
the grain will rise 30 percent to a record 14.005 billion
bushels this year.  One bushel of corn makes at least 2.75 gallons of the
renewable fuel.  Corn for July delivery added 2.75 cents, or 0.4 percent, to
$6.6725 a bushel in Chicago. The corn crush spread, or the cost
difference between a gallon of ethanol and the corn needed to
make it, was 4 cents, down from 5 cents yesterday, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  While the U.S. uses corn to make the biofuel,  Brazil , the
world’s second-biggest producer, uses sugarcane.  Imports have averaged 20,000 barrels a day through June 21,
EIA data show, compared to 7,000 barrels a day during the same
period in 2012.  Brazilian Ethanol  Anhydrous ethanol in  Sao Paulo  cost $2.25 a gallon last
week, the cheapest since Nov. 9, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. Brazil supplied 72 percent of U.S. ethanol imports in
April, EIA said in a  report  today.  Ethanol imports fell 31 percent to 975,000 barrels in April
from March, the lowest since November 2010, the  report  showed.  In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago increased 4
cents to $2.50 a gallon; in the U.S. Gulf prices gained 2 cents
to $2.565; in New York the additive rose 1.5 cents to $2.54 and
on the West Coast the biofuel lost 2.5 cents to $2.665, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  West Coast ethanol’s premium over the U.S. Gulf narrowed
4.5 cents to 10 cents while Chicago’s discount to  New York 
Harbor slimmed 2.5 cents to 4 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
