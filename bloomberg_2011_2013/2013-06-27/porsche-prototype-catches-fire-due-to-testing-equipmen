A Porsche AG vehicle prototype that
was undergoing testing caught fire while parked in an employee’s
garage this week.  The fire, which occurred late on June 25 in Ludwigsburg,
 Germany , caused well less than 1 million euros ($1.3 million) in
damages, Achim Schneider, a spokesman for the  Volkswagen AG (VOW) 
unit, said today by phone.  Measuring equipment on board the vehicle was the source of
the fire, and there was no connection between the flames and the
car’s powertrain technology, he said.  Porsche declined to identify the car beyond saying that it
was a vehicle that wasn’t yet on sale. The maker of the 911 is
slated to start deliveries of the 918 Spyder, a limited-run
hybrid supercar, later this year. The new Panamera four-door
coupe goes on sale in July and includes a plug-in hybrid
version. The company is also working on a sports-car line above
the 911.  To contact the reporter on this story:
