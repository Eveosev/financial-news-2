Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  bought  North
Sea  Forties at a lower price than yesterday. Statoil ASA failed
to buy Russian Urals crude at the same price of a three-year
high traded June 20.  Russia plans to ship less than a million barrels a day of
Urals crude from Primorsk port in July, near the lowest in more
than five years, a final loading program showed. Shipments from
the Baltic port were interrupted today by a tug-boat dispute.  A cargo of Forties crude is on its way to  Spain , at least
the second vessel to make the voyage this month, as the U.K.
grade becomes more appealing to buyers amid rising Russian
prices.  North Sea  Shell bought Forties cargo F0708 for July 11 to July 13
from Eni SpA at parity to Dated Brent, a Bloomberg survey of
traders and brokers monitoring the Platts pricing window showed.
This compares with a premium of 15 cents for a cargo Shell sold
yesterday.  Total SA failed to buy Forties for July 16 to July 22 at 5
cents a barrel more than Dated Brent, the survey showed.  Total was also unable to buy Ekofisk for July 17 to July 24
at 70 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent, 10 cents higher than
its bid yesterday, according to the survey.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days was 13 cents less than Dated Brent, compared with
a premium of 5 cents yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Brent for August settlement traded at $102.94 a barrel on
the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange at the close of the window,
compared with $100.82 in the previous session. The September
contract was at $102.56 at the same time today, a discount of 38
cents to August.  Repsol SA (REP)  loaded a Forties cargo on the SC Sara on June 22,
according to ship-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg. Another
Forties consignment was loaded onto the vessel Torm Ingeborg
yesterday at Hound Point,  Scotland , according to ship-tracking
data from ShipAIS. Both vessels are heading for Tarragona, where
Repsol operates an 186,000 barrel-a-day refinery. Total SA
booked a ship to collect a cargo at the Forties terminal and
ship it to  Poland , shipbroker data show.  Mediterranean/Urals  Statoil failed to buy 100,000 metric tons of Urals for July
10 to July 14 loading at 20 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent
on a delivered basis to Rotterdam, the survey showed. This is
the same price for the last trade on June 20, which was the
highest in at least three years.  Urals in the Mediterranean rose by 2 cents to a discount of
20 cents a barrel to Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg
showed. In northwest Europe, the  grade  was at 16 cents a barrel
more than Dated Brent, compared with a premium of 17 cents
yesterday.  Primorsk on the  Baltic Sea  will export 38 cargoes of
100,000 tons each and one shipment of 30,000 tons in July. The
shipments will total 3.83 million tons, or 905,610 barrels a
day, the schedule obtained by  Bloomberg News  showed, which is
2.5 percent down from this month on a barrel-per-day basis.
Prior to June, the port had loaded more than 1 million barrels a
day every month since at least March 2008, when Bloomberg began
tracking the data.  Exports from Primorsk for June were revised down to 3.8
million tons from 3.9 million tons after one unassigned position
failed to be filled. Loadings at Primorsk are currently halted
because of a tug boat dispute, Igor Dyomin, spokesman for OAO
Transneft, said today by phone.  Ust-Luga, also on the Baltic, will ship 19 Urals cargoes of
100,000 tons each, unchanged from June, according to the
program. That amounts to 449,258 barrels a day.  Exports from Novorossiysk on the  Black Sea  will reach 3.252
million tons in July, or 768,941 barrels a day, up 2.8 percent
from June. The July schedule includes four 80,000-ton cargoes of
Siberian Light grade and 28 Urals cargoes.  Novorossiysk has one unassigned slot of 140,000 tons and
Ust-Luga has one 100,000-ton position available next month,
according to the program.  OAO Surgutneftegas issued a tender to sell one 100,000-ton
cargo of Urals for July 12 to July 13 loading from Ust-Luga,
according to two people with knowledge of the matter. The tender
closes tomorrow.  Iraq plans to reduce exports of its Kirkuk crude in July
from the Turkish port of Ceyhan to 17 cargoes, one less than
this month, according to a loading program.  Shipments will total 9.6 million barrels, or 309,677
barrels a day, the plan showed. That compares with 302,333
barrels planned for June.  West Africa  Nigerian Benchmark Qua Iboe fell 1 cent to $2.19 a barrel
more than Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Nigeria  will export three cargoes of 1 million barrels each
of Amenam crude in August, unchanged from July, according to a
shipping plan.  The nation will also maintain its Okwori exports at one lot
of 650,000 barrels in August, a separate plan showed. The
loading program for benchmark Bonny Light is not released.  Separately, at Bonny Island, some Nigerian gas-carrying-vessels are being blocked from loading by a state maritime
agency, a spokesman said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
