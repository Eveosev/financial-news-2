Asian  stocks  rose, with the regional
benchmark index on course for its biggest gain since September,
as slower-than-estimated U.S. economic growth stoked speculation
the  Federal Reserve  may hold back from reducing stimulus.  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , the world’s largest maker of
smartphones, climbed 6.2 percent in Seoul. China Gas Holdings
Ltd. gained 4.8 percent in  Hong Kong  after the supplier of
natural gas to 172 Chinese cities posted earnings that beat
estimates. Newcrest Mining Ltd., Australia’s biggest gold
producer, jumped 6.3 percent as the precious metal headed for
its first advance in four days.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index increased 1.8 percent to 128.52
as of 5:52 p.m. in  Tokyo , with almost five shares rising for
each that fell. The gauge is poised for its second monthly
decline. The measure is headed for its biggest quarterly drop in
a year, after China’s money-market rates surged to a record and
Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said policy makers may start
dialing down stimulus.  “Central-bank statements have combined with some softish
data to remind people that the U.S. recovery remains the weakest
in history and that policy action is not imminent,” Matthew Sherwood, Sydney-based head of investment market research at
Perpetual Ltd., which manages about $25 billion, said by e-mail.
“The risk of tapering has not gone away.”  Japan’s  Topix index  gained 2.8 percent and the benchmark
Nikkei 225 Stock Average increased 3 percent. South Korea’s
Kospi index jumped 2.9 percent. Taiwan’s Taiex index advanced
1.3 percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index added 1.7 percent New
Zealand’s NZX 50 Index and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index both rose
0.5 percent.  Cash Crunch  China’s  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  fell 0.1 percent,
extending losses for a seventh day, amid ongoing concern a surge
in funding costs this month will curb growth.  Fitch Ratings  cut its 2013 growth forecast for China,
saying a jump in interbank rates in June is likely to be a drag
on the economy. The  seven-day repurchase rate  fell to 6.74
percent, compared with this year’s average of 3.85 percent, data
compiled by Bloomberg showed.  “The cash crunch has eased a bit but its impact on the
real economy has yet to be known,” said Wei Wei, an analyst at
West China Securities Co. in  Shanghai . “Investors are cautious
at this stage.”  Shares on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index traded at 12.3 times
estimated earnings as of yesterday, compared with 14.5 for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 12.6 times for the Stoxx Europe
600 Index, the data showed.  U.S. Economy  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.1
percent today. The  S&P 500  increased 1 percent yesterday, rising
for a second day.  Government data showed gross domestic product expanded at a
revised 1.8 percent annualized rate from January through March,
down from a prior estimate of 2.4 percent. Household purchases,
which account for about 70 percent of the economy, were revised
to a 2.6 percent advance compared with the 3.4 percent gain
estimated last month.  Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President  Jeffrey Lacker 
said he expects “a couple more years of sluggish growth” and
that the central bank isn’t close to reducing its bond holdings.  “This asset-purchase tapering is just slowing the rate at
which we’re increasing the balance sheet,” Lacker, who doesn’t
vote on the  Federal Open Market Committee  this year, said in a
Bloomberg Television interview with  Peter Cook . “We’re not
anywhere near decreasing the balance sheet yet.”  Exporters Climb  Exporters advanced. Samsung Electronics climbed 6.2 percent
to 1.339 million won in Seoul. Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s
biggest carmaker, rose 3.5 percent to 5,900 yen in Tokyo.  James
Hardie Industries SE (JHX) , a supplier of building materials that gets
about 70 percent of sales in the U.S., gained 3.5 percent to
A$9.66 in Sydney.  China Gas (384)  increased 4.8 percent to HK$7.64 after its profit
for the year ended March jumped 85 percent to HK$1.76 billion
($227 million), beating the HK$1.51 billion average estimate of
11 analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  Gold miners climbed as bullion increased 1.1 percent,
heading for its first advance this week. Newcrest Mining jumped
6.3 percent to A$9.90 in Sydney. Regis Resources Ltd. gained 2
percent to A$3.06.  To contact the reporters on this story:
