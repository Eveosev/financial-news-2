Adobe Systems Inc. (ADBE) , the biggest
maker of graphic-design software, agreed to acquire closely held
French digital-marketing company Neolane Inc. for $600 million
in cash.  Neolane, which makes tools to help marketers reach
consumers through personalized campaigns using channels such as
the Internet, e-mail, mobile devices and direct mail, will join
Adobe’s Marketing Cloud product line, Adobe said yesterday.  “Neolane brings critical cross-channel campaign management
capabilities” to the line, Brad Rencher, an Adobe senior vice
president, said in yesterday’s statement.  Adobe competitors have recently bulked up their digital-marketing and cloud capabilities as well. This month
 Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM)  signed an agreement to buy ExactTarget Inc.
for $2.5 billion. Last year,  Oracle Corp. (ORCL)  bought Eloqua Inc. for
$871 million, and Teradata Corp. agreed to buy Aprimo Inc. in
2010 for $525 million.  The deal is a coup for a French technology company and a
boost for the country’s venture capital industry, according to a
statement from Auriga Partners SA, one of Neolane’s earliest
backers. The company had sales of 44 million euros last year, 40
percent more than in 2011, Auriga said. Paris-based Neolane has
customers in Europe, Asia and the Americas, and a quarter of its
sales came from in the U.S. in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
