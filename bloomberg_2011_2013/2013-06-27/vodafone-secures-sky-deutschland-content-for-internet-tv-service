Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) , which agreed to
buy Kabel Deutschland Holding AG in a 7.7 billion-euro ($10
billion) deal to expand its German fixed-line business, has
secured television content from  Sky Deutschland AG. (SKYD)   People using Vodafone Germany’s Internet TV service will be
able to access Munich-based Sky’s programs starting in August,
including live Bundesliga soccer matches and series such as
HBO’s fantasy-adventure series “Game of Thrones,” the
companies said in separate  statements  today.  “We’re strengthening our position as an integrated
provider of fixed-line, wireless connections, data services and
TV,” said Erik Friemuth, head of consumer marketing at the
German unit of Newbury, England-based Vodafone.  The deal is part of Vodafone’s effort to reduce its
reliance on revenue from traditional mobile-phone services in
Europe’s biggest telecommunications market. For Sky, which has a
target to post its first operating profit since 2007 this year
after surpassing 3.4 million subscribers, it provides another
route to attract viewers.  Kabel Deutschland  also has a deal to
offer Sky Deutschland content.  Vodafone in May signed a deal with  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  to
gain better access to the former German phone monopoly’s fast
Internet lines. Vodafone TV, which started in Germany in early
2011 and which currently has 150,000 customers, lags behind
Deutsche Telekom’s Entertain service, which has more than 2
million customers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
