Nickel rose in  London , leading a
rebound in industrial metals, as lower prices attracted
investors.  Nickel prices closed at the lowest level since May 2009
yesterday, falling 17 percent this quarter. The metal is heading
for a third weekly drop, dinting its 14-day relative strength
index close to the level that indicates a potential impending
rebound to some analysts who study technical charts. The LME
Index of six primary metals touched 2,911 on June 24, the lowest
level since June 2010.  “The market looks a bit oversold for now,”  William Adams ,
an analyst at Fastmarkets.com in London, said by e-mail today.
“So we would not be surprised to see some bargain hunting and
that in turn is likely to trigger short-covering.”  Nickel for delivery in three months rose 1.5 percent to
$13,815 a metric ton by 11:14 a.m. on the London Metal Exchange.
Copper rose 0.4 percent to $6,760.25 a ton. The metal is down
7.5 percent this month and 10 percent lower this quarter. Copper
for delivery in September advanced 0.6 percent at $3.0595 a
pound on the Comex in  New York .  Industrial metals also gained as the dollar weakened for
the first time in seven days against a basket of currencies,
reducing the appeal of commodities as an alternative investment.  U.S. gross domestic product expanded at a revised 1.8
percent annualized rate from January through March, down from a
prior estimate of 2.4 percent, figures from the Commerce
Department showed yesterday. The People’s Bank of  China  has
provided liquidity to some financial institutions to stabilize
money-market rates, according to a June 25 release. China and
the U.S. are the top consumers of industrial metals.  Tin Sales  Tin for delivery in three months rose 1.2 percent to
$19,945 a ton on the LME. Tin sales from  Indonesia , the world’s
largest supplier, may decline to the lowest level in seven years
as the country raises purity standards for shipments. Exports
will probably drop 20 percent this year to 79,000 tons as new
rules take effect from July 1, according to the median of
estimates from seven smelter executives and one analyst compiled
by Bloomberg.  Copper stockpiles monitored by the LME fell 0.5 percent to
667,425 tons. Canceled warrants, or metal earmarked for
delivery, rose to a record 375,425 tons on bookings in
 Malaysia ’s Johor and the Belgian city of Antwerp. A total 1,250
tons of copper was requested at the Dutch port of Vlissingen,
which was delisted as a delivery port for the metal last year.  On the LME, aluminum, zinc and lead climbed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
