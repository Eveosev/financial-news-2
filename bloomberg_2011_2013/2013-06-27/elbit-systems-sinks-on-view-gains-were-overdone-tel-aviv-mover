Elbit Systems Ltd. (ESLT)  fell the most in
five months on speculation gains that sent the Israeli defense
developer’s shares to an 18-month high were overdone.  The Haifa-based company declined 3.6 percent, the most
since Jan. 20, to 153.80 shekels, or $42.37, at the close in Tel
Aviv. The  stock  reached the highest since November 2011 on June
17. Elbit’s price-to-earnings ratio climbed to 10.9 on June 18,
the highest this year and compared with a multiple of 10.5 for
Bethesda, Maryland-based  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT)   “Shares are giving back some of their gains as investors
make the most of the recent advance,” Dov Rozenberg, an analyst
at Clal Finance Batucha Brokerage Ltd. in  Tel Aviv , said by
phone today. Rozenberg rates the shares the equivalent of hold,
with a price estimate of $45.  Elbit, which  got 31 percent of revenue  from the U.S. in
2012, is searching for new markets to prop up earnings as the
Pentagon cuts spending to rein in budget deficits. The company
said it received a $115 million contract with an Asian customer
for electronic warfare systems in March. A month later, it got a
$40 million contract from a country in  Africa .  The shares have gained 0.1 percent this quarter, compared
with an a decline of 3.9 percent for the country’s benchmark
TA-25 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
