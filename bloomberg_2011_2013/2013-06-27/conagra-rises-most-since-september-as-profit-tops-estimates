     June 27 (Bloomberg) -- ConAgra Foods Inc., maker of Chef
Boyardee pasta and Pam cooking spray, gained the most in nine
months after quarterly profit topped analysts estimates as
acquisitions drove sales in its consumer foods unit.  The shares  rose  5.1 percent to $35.04 at the close in  New
York  for the biggest one-day gain since Sept. 20. ConAgra
advanced 19 percent this year, while the Standard & Poor’s 500
Consumer Staples Index added 14 percent.  ConAgra, which bought Unilever’s North American frozen
meals business in August and Ralcorp Holdings Inc. in January,
said sales in its consumer division increased 7 percent in the
quarter ended May 26, with acquisitions contributing 5 percent.  Adjusted earnings per share for the fiscal fourth quarter
were 60 cents, according to a statement today. That compared to
an average  estimate  of 59 cents, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Profit from continuing operations was 45 cents,
compared with a loss of 21 cents in the year-earlier period.  Revenue jumped 34 percent to $4.59 billion. Analysts had
projected $4.61 billion.  The Ralcorp acquisition contributed $962 million to sales
in the fiscal fourth quarter, Omaha, Nebraska-based ConAgra
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
