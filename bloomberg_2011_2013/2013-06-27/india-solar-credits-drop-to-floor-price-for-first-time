Indian solar-energy credits in June
fell as much as 19 percent from the previous month, sinking to
their floor price for the first time since trading began last
year as new sun-powered plants came on line.  The credits, which power-distribution companies and
industrial consumers buy to meet clean-energy mandates, sold for
9,300 rupees ($154), according to  REConnect Energy Solutions
Pvt ., an Indore-based trader that records all transactions on
the Indian Electricity Exchange and the Power Exchange of  India .  India requires companies including  Coal India Ltd. (COAL)  and  Tata
Power Co. (TPWR)  to get as much as 10 percent of their energy from
renewables. Those unable to source enough locally may meet
targets by buying credits from solar, wind, hydro and biomass
plants via the two exchanges.  Each credit represents 1 megawatt-hour of electricity fed
into the power grid. Bids from solar utilities seeking to sell
credits were four times higher than buy bids, according to
REConnect.  Indiaâ€™s solar capacity increased 79 percent to 1,686
megawatts in the last financial year as plants awarded through
government auctions were completed and began generating power,
according to data from the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
