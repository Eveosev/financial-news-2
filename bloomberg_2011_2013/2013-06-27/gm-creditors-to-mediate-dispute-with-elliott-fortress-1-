Creditors of  General Motors Co. (GM) ’s
old assets in bankruptcy will start settlement talks with funds
including Elliott International LP,  Fortress Investment Group
LLC (FIG) ,  Morgan Stanley (MS)  & Co. International and units of Paulson &
Co. over $3 billion in disputed claims.  The court-ordered mediation will be overseen by Judge James Peck, according to court papers filed today in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in Manhattan. The  dispute  stems from a settlement made by
the hedge funds regarding their investment in a Canadian unit of
GM on the day of the automaker’s 2009 bankruptcy.  The mediation has been agreed to “for the purpose of
facilitating a settlement,” creditors said in court papers.  A trust sued the hedge funds on behalf of creditors as part
of the bankruptcy, questioning their right to a $367 million
cash fee and a claim of $2.67 billion. GM Chief Financial
Officer Daniel Ammann testified in court hearings that a
negative outcome in the dispute could cost the automaker, now
out of bankruptcy, as much as  $918 million , or 50 cents a share.  The main bankruptcy case is In re Motors Liquidation Co.,
09-bk-50026, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New
York ( Manhattan ). The adversary case is Motors Liquidation
Company GUC Trust v. Appaloosa Investment Limited Partnership I,
12-bk-09802, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
