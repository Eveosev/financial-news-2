The health of  Nelson Mandela , South
Africa’s first black president, has improved since last night,
the nation’s presidency said.  “He remains critical but is now stable,” President  Jacob Zuma ’s office said in a statement on its website, after Zuma
visited the former leader at a Pretoria hospital. We are
“disturbed by the rumors that are being spread about former
President Mandela’s health,” it said.  Mandela, 94, was admitted to the hospital on June 8 for a
recurring lung infection. Zuma late yesterday canceled an
official visit to Mozambique after receiving an update on
Mandela’s condition.  Mandela led South Africa from 1994 to 1999 after the
country’s first all-race elections that ended apartheid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
