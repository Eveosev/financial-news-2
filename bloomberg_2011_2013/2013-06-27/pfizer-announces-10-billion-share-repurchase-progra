Pfizer Inc. (PFE) , the world’s biggest
drugmaker, said it will buy back $10 billion in stock after
earlier this week announcing it will retire about $11.4 billion
in shares through the spinoff of its animal-health unit.  The buyback is the fourth major share repurchase program
for New York-based Pfizer in the past 2 1/2 years. During that
time, the company has announced $39 billion in share buybacks,
including today’s. Pfizer has $3.9 billion left on its current
repurchase program, the company said today in a statement.  Ian Read , Pfizer’s chief executive officer, has said that
share repurchases are the best uses of Pfizer’s cash, compared
with acquisitions or increasing the dividend. Read has shed non-drug units to focus on developing and selling new, brand-name
therapies. The company, which had a market capitalization of
about $200 billion as of today’s close, is looking at whether it
will split itself and get rid of its generics drug business.  Pfizer earlier this week announced the completion of a deal
to exchange shares of its own stock for equity in  Zoetis Inc. (ZTS) ,
its former animal-health unit. That exchange is expected to
retire about $11.4 billion in Pfizer shares.  Pfizer shares gained 1.4 percent to $28.58 in extended
trading at 5:35 p.m.  New York  time after the buyback was
announced. The company’s stock has increased 25 percent in the
past 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
