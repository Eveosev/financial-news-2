Treasuries extended gains after
yields almost at the highest levels since 2011 bolstered demand
at the U.S. sale of $29 billion in seven-year securities in the
final of three note auctions this week.  The offering drew a yield of 1.932 percent, compared with a
forecast of 1.942 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of six of
the  Federal Reserve ’s 21 primary dealers. The  bid-to-cover 
ratio, which gauges demand by comparing total bids with the
amount of securities offered, was 2.61, versus an average of
2.67 for the past 10 sales. Treasuries rose earlier as  New York 
Fed President William C. Dudley said policy makers may prolong
its asset-buying program if growth fails to meet Fed forecasts.  “The seven-year went well,” said  David Coard , head of
fixed-income trading in New York at Williams Capital Group LP, a
brokerage for institutional investors. “People probably feel
like the Fed has had some success in persuading the market that
they may have over-reacted to the comments made last week by
Bernanke.”  The  yield  on the current seven-year note dropped six basis
points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 1.90 percent at 1:24 p.m.
in New York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader Prices. It
touched 2.11 percent on June 24, the highest level since August
2011. Benchmark 10-year note  yields  fell seven basis points to
2.47 percent.  Bidder Participation  Indirect bidders, an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 46.4 percent of the notes, the most
since August 2011, compared with an average of 37.8 percent for
the past 10 sales.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids  directly  with the Treasury, bought 15.7 percent of
the notes, the least since July 2012. The average at the past 10
auctions was 19.4 percent.  Seven-year notes have lost 3.9 percent this year, compared
with a decline of 2.8 percent by Treasuries overall, according
to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The seven-year
securities returned 3. 9 percent in 2012, while Treasuries
overall rose 2.2 percent.  Today’s offering is the final of three note auctions this
week totaling $99 billion. The government sold $35 billion in
two-year debt on June 25 and another $35 billion in five-year
debt yesterday.  The sales will raise $40.7 billion of new cash, as maturing
securities held by the public total $58.3 billion, according to
the  U.S. Treasury .  Investors have bid $2.94 for each $1 of the $1.077 trillion
of notes and bonds sold by the Treasury in the first half of
2013, compared with a record high $3.15 for all of last year.  ‘Way Off’  Treasuries gained earlier as Dudley said any decision to
reduce the pace of asset purchases wouldn’t represent a
withdrawal of stimulus, and that an increase in the Fed’s
benchmark interest rate is “very likely to be a long way off.”  “The Fed is trying to steer the market a little bit away
from thinking rates are going to go up” soon, said  Ray Remy ,
head of fixed income in New York at Daiwa Capital Markets
America Inc. “They are on hold for a long period.”  Bonds pared gains after the National Association of
Realtors’ index of pending U.S. home sales jumped 6.7 percent to
112.3, the highest since December 2006.  The Fed is purchasing $85 billion of  U.S. government debt 
and mortgage-backed securities every month to put downward
pressure on borrowing costs during the third round of its
quantitative-easing stimulus program. It has kept its benchmark
 interest-rate  target at zero to 0.25 percent since 2008 to
support the economy.  Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said June 19 the central bank may
slow stimulus this year and end it entirely in mid-2014 if
economic growth meets its projections.  To contact the reporter on this story:
