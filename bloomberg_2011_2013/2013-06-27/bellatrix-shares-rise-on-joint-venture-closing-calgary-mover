Bellatrix Exploration Ltd. (BXE)  rose the
most in five months after the Canadian oil and natural gas
explorer said it closed a joint venture with Grafton Energy Co.
worth C$122 million ($95 million).  The shares jumped 12 percent to C$6.18 at the close in
Toronto, the most since Jan. 22. The stock has gained 45 percent
this year.  Bellatrix completed an agreement with Grafton Energy to
develop resources in the Willesden Green and Brazeau areas of
 Alberta , the company said today in a statement. Grafton will
contribute C$100 million to development of the resources.  “The deal has further room to accelerate development of
the plays,” Casimir Capital, which has a buy rating on the
stock, said today in a note to investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
