A measure of demand at the U.S.
Treasury Department’s debt auctions has fallen this year to the
lowest level since 2009 as a drop in bond prices generates the
biggest losses on government securities in four years.  Investors bid $2.94 for each $1 of the $1.077 billion of
notes and bonds sold by the Treasury this year, compared with a
record high $3.15 of bids last year. It’s the first decline in
demand at the auctions since 2008, when the U.S. government
increased note and bond offerings 59 percent to $922 billion as
the recession and the financial crisis deepened.  Diminished appetite for Treasuries comes as improving
economic data has led to speculation the Federal Reserve may
reduce the pace of its bond purchases. Investors searching for
yield amid concern the 30-year bull market for bonds has ended
indicate the U.S. government should anticipate fewer orders for
its debt.  “Demand is somewhat more questionable for Treasuries at
this point,” said Ira Jersey, an interest-rate strategist at
Credit Suisse Group AG in New York, one of 21 primary dealers
that are obligated to bid at U.S. government debt offerings.
“The proximate cause is the idea that the Federal Reserve won’t
be as involved in the market going forward and pulled forward
their guidance for when they’ll be neutral on monetary policy.”  Demand Drop  Treasury sold $29 billion of seven-year notes yesterday,
drawing bids of $2.61 for $1 offered, compared with an average
of $2.67 at the previous 10 sales.  Demand at all U.S. note and bond auctions has declined for
five consecutive months starting in January, when investors bid
3.11 times the amount of Treasuries sold, falling to 2.7 times
in June, the lowest ratio since August 2009, according to data
released by the Treasury and compiled by Bloomberg.  The 10-year  note  yield has climbed 74 basis points this
year, or 0.74 percentage point, to 2.50 percent at 9:11 a.m. in
New York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. It reached
2.66 percent on June 24, the highest since August 2011.  Treasuries lost 2 percent in May, their worst monthly
performance since December 2009, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch’s U.S. Treasury Index.  They have plunged 2.8 percent in 2013, the biggest year-to-date losses to this point since 2009, when they dropped 4.5
percent through June.  Move Away  “There is this quest for yield and people are going to
migrate” away from Treasuries, said Richard Schlanger, who
helps invest $20 billion in fixed-income securities as vice
president at Pioneer Investments in  Boston .  Pioneer has been underweight Treasuries in 2013 and is
investing in short-term floating-rate notes and non-agency
mortgage-backed securities, Schlanger said. The 10-year yield
will likely end the year yielding between 2.5 percent and 3
percent, he said.  The last three times Treasuries suffered an annual loss
were 2009, 1999 and 1994, according to Bank of America index
data.  In 2009, yields rose following a $787 billion fiscal
stimulus plan proposed by President  Barack Obama  and $1.75
trillion of monetary accommodation announced by the Fed in
response to problems caused by the worst financial crisis since
the Great Depression.  Yields climbed in 1999 as the impact of the collapse of
Long-Term Capital Management LLC unwound. In 1994, the Fed
surprised the market by raising its benchmark overnight
borrowing rate to 5.5 percent at year end from 3 percent at the
start of the year.  Fed View  In response to questions May 22 in testimony to Congress,
Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke indicated the central bank had
given thought to reducing its stimulus at some point.  “If the incoming data are broadly consistent with this
forecast, the committee currently anticipates that it would be
appropriate to moderate the monthly pace of purchases later this
year,” Bernanke said June 19, referring to the Fed’s outlook
for “moderate” economic growth, further labor-market gains and
inflation accelerating toward the Fed’s 2 percent goal.  The economy has added an average of 189,000 jobs each month
through May, the fastest pace since 2005 when it created 207,000
per month, Labor Department data show. The unemployment rate
fell to 7.6 percent in May, from 8.1 percent in August.  “The data coming out is just really good on the economy
and that keeps putting more pressure on everybody,” said
Michael Franzese, senior vice president of fixed-income trading
at ED&F Man Capital Markets in New York. “Every piece of
positive data that comes out will trickle into the employment
rate and thus the Fed is correct in its assessment that we
should start the tapering.”  Debt Service  Total marketable U.S. government debt has  grown  to $11.4
trillion in May from $4.4 trillion in July 2007 at the beginning
of the financial crisis, Treasury data show. Outstanding debt
declined in May by $19.4 billion, the first monthly reduction
since September 2012.  The U.S. budget deficit will shrink this fiscal year to
$642 billion, the smallest shortfall in five years, the
nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said in a May 14 report.
The deficit will contract to 4 percent of gross domestic
product, from 10.1 percent in fiscal 2009.  The CBO reduced its estimate of the likely shortfall,
citing stronger-than-expected tax receipts. In February, it had
projected a $845 billion deficit for the 2013 fiscal year, which
ends Sept. 30. Last year’s deficit was $1.1 trillion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
