Swiss stocks  rose for a third day,
for the longest winning streak in five weeks, as investors
awaited U.S. reports that may show  consumer spending  and sales
of previously owned houses increased in May.  Roche Holding AG (ROG) , the worldâ€™s biggest maker of cancer
drugs, contributed the most to gains in the benchmark Swiss
Market Index.  Transocean Ltd. (RIG) , the largest supplier of offshore
oil rigs, advanced 1.1 percent.  The  SMI (SMI)  climbed 0.3 percent to 7,574.99 at 9:42 a.m. in
Zurich, heading for its first weekly rally since the period
ended May 17. The gauge is still poised for a decline of 4.6
percent in June, its biggest monthly decline since July 2011.
The SMI has slumped 3 percent so far this quarter, trimming its
gain for the year to 11 percent. The broader Swiss Performance
Index also rose 0.3 percent today.  In the U.S., a report at 8:30 a.m.  New York  time may show
that personal spending increased 0.3 percent last month, after a
0.2 percent drop in April, according to the median forecast of
83 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  Separate data from the National Association of Realtors at
10 a.m. will probably show that an index of pending-home sales
rose 1 percent in May after a 0.3 percent gain in the previous
month.  In the European Union, finance chiefs struck an agreement
on how to handle failing banks. In seven hours of emergency
negotiations in Brussels that concluded at about 1:30 a.m.
today, ministers finalized guidelines for assigning losses to
private creditors and regulating public assistance.  Roche gained 1.1 percent to 230.30 Swiss francs, while
 Actelion Ltd. (ATLN)  added 1.4 percent to 55.85 francs. A gauge of
European health-care companies was among the best performers of
the 19 industry groups in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Transocean climbed 1.1 percent to 45.22 francs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
