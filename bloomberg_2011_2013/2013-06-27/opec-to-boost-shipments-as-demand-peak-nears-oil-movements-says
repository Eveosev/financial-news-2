The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will raise shipments by 1.9 percent through
the middle of July as summer demand for driving fuels in the
northern hemisphere nears its highest point, Oil Movements said.  The group that supplies about 40 percent of the world’s oil
will ship 24.03 million barrels a day in the four weeks to July
13, up 450,000 a day from 23.58 million in the previous period
to June 15, the tanker tracker said in an e-mailed report. The
figures exclude two of OPEC’s 12 members,  Angola  and  Ecuador .  “This is heading into the point where refinery runs peak
and therefore crude demand peaks,” Roy Mason, the company’s
founder, said today by phone from Halifax,  England . “Quite a
bit of the increase is going west. Sometime in the next three
weeks we’ll get that peak and then its downhill until the
winter.”  Middle Eastern shipments will jump by 2.4 percent to 17.69
million barrels a day, compared with 17.27 million in the month
to June 15, according to Oil Movements. That figure includes
non-OPEC nations Oman and Yemen.  Crude on board tankers will increase by 2.7 percent to
482.23 million barrels versus 469.67 million, data from Oil
Movements show. The researcher calculates the volumes by
tallying tanker bookings. Its figures exclude crude held on
vessels for storage.  OPEC’s members are  Algeria , Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq,
 Kuwait , Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela. It will next meet in Vienna on Dec. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
