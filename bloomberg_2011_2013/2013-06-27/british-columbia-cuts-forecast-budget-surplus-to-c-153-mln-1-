British Columbia cut its forecast
 budget surplus  for the fiscal year that began in April by 22
percent amid a slowing economy and lower-than-expected tax
revenue.  The Canadian province will post a C$153 million ($146
million) surplus in 2013-2014, less than the C$197 million it
forecast in February, according to an updated fiscal plan
released today by Finance Minister Michael de Jong. The surplus
will be little changed in 2014-2015 before rising to C$446
million in 2015-2016, he said.  “I won’t profess to be entirely comfortable, but the
numbers are what they are” said de Jong, adding that he’d be
more at ease with a 2013-2014 surplus of about C$200 million.
“We have now moved below that.”  British Columbia’s economic  update , the first since Premier
Christy Clark’s ruling  Liberal Party  was re-elected last month,
forecasts the province’s economy to expand by 1.4 percent in
2013, down from the 1.6 percent forecast in February. The
province’s economy grew by 1.8 percent in 2012, government
documents show.  ‘Tough Going’  “The next 12-18 months are going to be tough” as the
government moves to encourage private-sector investment,
especially development of a multi-billion-dollar liquefied
natural gas industry, de Jong said in a briefing for reporters
before unveiling the economic blueprint in the legislature in
Victoria, the provincial capital.  Long-term debt in the province of 4.65 million people will
rise this fiscal year to C$62.6 billion, from C$55.8 billion
last year, or 27 percent of gross domestic product. Taxpayer-supported debt, which excludes the obligations of commercially
run government businesses such as B.C. Hydro, will increase
about 12 percent from a year earlier to C$42.6 billion, or 18.4
percent of GDP.  The province’s budget projection includes a “forecast
allowance” of C$150 million this year. It also includes a C$225
million contingency allowance.  The latest 2013-2014 budget surplus incorporates C$50
million from this year’s forecast allowance, an estimated C$30
million of planned spending cuts and expectations for sales of
government-owned real estate and other assets, the budget
documents show.  The smaller surplus also reflects a C$221 million drop in
expected  tax revenue , compared to the government’s February
forecast in February.  British Columbia is  Canada ’s third-most-populous province
after Ontario and  Quebec .  To contact the reporter on this story:
