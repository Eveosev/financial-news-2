Hong Kong Mercantile Exchange’s co-president William Barkshire resigned as a director of the
company amid a police investigation into financial
irregularities involving the failed commodities bourse.  Barkshire stepped down on June 6, according to a filing to
Hong Kong’s Companies Registry. He retains the co-president
role, Aubrey Ho, a company spokeswoman, said by telephone today.
Artem Volynets, chief executive officer of Russian billionaire
Oleg Deripaska’s En+ Group Ltd., which holds a stake in HKMEx
also resigned as a director, as did Richard Wong, according to
separate filings.  HKMEx surrendered its trading license last month after
failing to attract sufficient revenue to support its operations.
The Securities and Futures Commission said on May 21 it found
“serious” suspected irregularities in the exchange’s financial
affairs and referred the case to the police.  Barry Cheung , chairman and largest shareholder of the
bourse operator, resigned from all public service positions,
including the city’s executive council, because he’s under
police investigation, the government said last month.  Three men arrested as part of a probe into the company were
charged May 24 in Kowloon City Magistrates’ Court with having
false documents including letters related to a $460 million
check and $11 million of funds. Cheung said the three aren’t
current or former employees of HKMEx.  To contact the reporters on this story:
