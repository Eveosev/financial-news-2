U.S.  stocks  rose, sending the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to its biggest three-day rally since
January, on better-than-estimated economic data and assurances
on stimulus efforts from Federal Reserve officials.  Nine of 10  industries  in the  S&P 500 (SPX)  advanced. JPMorgan
Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. gained more than 1.2 percent as
financial companies rallied. An S&P index that tracks
homebuilders surged 2.9 percent as D.R. Horton Inc. and Lennar
Corp. increased at least 3.8 percent. Time Warner Cable Inc.
jumped 4.4 percent as billionaire  John Malone  was said to be
exploring scenarios for how Charter Communications Inc. could
acquire the company.  The  S&P 500  advanced 0.6 percent to 1,613.20 at 4 p.m. in
 New York . The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose 114.35 points,
or 0.8 percent, to 15,024.49. Almost 6.2 billion shares changed
hands on U.S. exchanges, 4.4 percent below the three-month
average.  “The data continues to show that the economy is growing at
a very slow pace and that unemployment is improving at a very
slow pace,” Oliver Pursche, co-manager of the GMG Defensive
Beta Fund and president of Suffern, New York-based Gary Goldberg
Financial Services, said in a phone interview. The firm manages
about $650 million. “It means the likelihood that the  Federal
Reserve  changing course on its monetary policy this year is very
low, and that further solidifies the case that last week’s
correction was emotionally driven and an overreaction.”  The S&P 500 has rallied 2.6 percent over the past three
days, the most since Jan. 4 and paring its decline for June to
1.1 percent. The index dropped more than 5 percent from May 21
through June 24 as the Fed said it may reduce its bond purchases
if the economy and labor market improve as forecast.  Bull Market  Central bank stimulus has helped fuel a rally in stocks
worldwide, with the benchmark U.S. index surging as much as 147
percent from its March 2009 low. Despite this month’s decline,
the S&P 500 is up 2.8 percent for the quarter and has soared 13
percent for 2013.  Consumer spending  in the U.S. rebounded in May following
the largest drop in more than three years. Household purchases,
which account for about 70 percent of the economy, rose 0.3
percent after a 0.3 percent decline the prior month, Commerce
Department figures showed today in  Washington . Incomes advanced
0.5 percent, more than projected.  More Americans signed contracts in May to buy previously
owned homes than at any time in more than six years. Claims for
 unemployment benefits  decreased by 9,000 to 346,000 last week,
indicating employers are slowing the pace of firings.  Fed Speakers  Fed Bank of New York President William C. Dudley said in
New York today that the central bank may prolong its asset-purchase program if the economy’s performance fails to meet its
forecasts. Fed Governor Jerome Powell said in Washington that
asset purchases may be scaled back later this year if growth
holds up, and any such trimming depends on economic data rather
than the calendar.  The comments came a day after Fed Bank of Richmond
President  Jeffrey Lacker  said he expects the U.S. expansion to
remain “sluggish” for “a couple more years.”  Data yesterday showed gross domestic product expanded at a
slower-than-forecast 1.8 percent annualized rate in the first
quarter, fueling speculation the Fed will maintain the pace of
quantitative easing.  Volatility Index  The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, or
VIX, retreated 2 percent to 16.86. The benchmark gauge for U.S.
stock options surged to the highest level since Dec. 28 last
week. The  index  has fallen 11 percent this week.  Financial and phone companies advanced more than 0.9
percent to lead gains among S&P 500 industries. The Morgan
Stanley Cyclical Index of stocks whose earnings are most tied to
economic growth increased 1.1 percent. Hewlett-Packard Co.
climbed 3.2 percent to $24.77. Boeing Co., the world’s largest
planemaker, rallied 2.4 percent to $103.15.  An S&P index of  homebuilders  jumped 2.9 percent for a third
day of gains, as 10 of 11 members advanced following the report
on existing-home sales.  D.R. Horton  jumped 3.8 percent to
$21.71. Lennar surged 3.8 percent to $37.38.  Financial stocks jumped 1.3 percent as a group. JPMorgan
climbed 1.2 percent to $53.15. Citigroup added 1.4 percent to
$48.28. American Express Co. rose 1.7 percent to $75.12.  Time Warner Cable surged 4.4 percent to $108.22. Malone’s
Liberty Media Corp., which owns 27 percent of Charter
Communications, is working on how to structure an offer with
enough cash to win over Time Warner Cable investors, according
to people familiar with the discussions. Time Warner Cable isn’t
interested in a deal and doesn’t think Liberty and Charter can
come up with an offer that’s attractive, according to people
familiar with management’s thinking.  ConAgra Soars  ConAgra Foods Inc. (CAG)  added 5.1 percent to $35.04. The maker
of Chef Boyardee pasta and Pam cooking spray reported quarterly
profit that topped analysts estimates as acquisitions drove
sales in its consumer foods unit.                           Paychex Inc. (PAYX)  dropped 3.7 percent to $36.60. The payrolls
manager reported fourth-quarter earnings per share of 34 cents,
below the average analyst estimate for profit of 37 cents.
Revenue in the period was $585.3 million, missing the $586.2
million average projection.  Investors should expect about $13 billion in selling of
equities and buying of bonds as pension fund managers rebalance
their portfolios at the end of the second quarter, Ramon Verastegui, a derivatives strategist at Societe Generale SA in
New York, wrote in a June 25 note.  Bond Funds  The S&P 500 has outperformed  government bonds  since the end
of March with a total return of 2.7 percent through yesterday
compared with a 5.1 percent loss for 10-year Treasuries,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg and Bank of America
Merrill Lynch.  U.S.-listed bond mutual funds and exchange-traded funds saw
record monthly redemptions of $61.7 billion through June 24,
according to TrimTabs Investment Research, amid concern the Fed
may scale back its unprecedented stimulus. Mutual funds that
invest in U.S. stocks had $463 million in outflows in the five
days that ended with the Fed’s policy statement on June 19,
according to data from the  Investment Company Institute  released
today. Redemptions since May 16 total $7.3 billion.  “The flows coming out of fixed income need to go
somewhere,” Bill Schultz, chief investment officer who oversees
about $1.1 billion at McQueen Ball & Associates in Bethlehem,
 Pennsylvania , said by phone. “ Money market funds  don’t offer
anything, bonds are less attractive, so U.S. domestic equities
on a relative scale look like the most attractive asset going
forward.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
