India’s  Finance Ministry  said
markets are overreacting and short-term swings are no reason for
a change in sentiment.  The rupee tumbled to a record low yesterday as the prospect
of reduced U.S. monetary stimulus exposes emerging nations from
India to Brazil to the risk of capital outflows. It is the worst
performer after the yen this year among 11 Asian currencies
tracked by Bloomberg, hurt by the current-account  deficit  and
falling investments.  The imbalance in the broadest measure of trade narrowed to
$18.1 billion in January through March, compared with a revised
$31.9 billion in the previous quarter, the  Reserve Bank  of India
said today. The median of 14 estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey was for a $21 billion gap.  The deficit last quarter was 3.6 percent of gross domestic
product, from an unprecedented 6.7 percent of GDP in October to
December, according to the central bank’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
