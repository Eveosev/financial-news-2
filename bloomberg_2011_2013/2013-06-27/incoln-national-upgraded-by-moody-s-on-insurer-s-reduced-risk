Lincoln National Corp. (LNC) , the insurer
adding to its money-management staff, was upgraded by Moody’s
Investors Service after shifting sales to offerings that may
present a smaller chance of losses tied to interest rates and
stock market fluctuations.  The rating was lifted to Baa1 from Baa2 as the “de-risked
product portfolio has helped and will continue to improve its
credit profile,” the ratings firm said today in a statement on
the Radnor, Pennsylvania-based insurer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
