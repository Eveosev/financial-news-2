Investors overreacted to Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s comments that the central
bank could reduce monthly bond purchases,  Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS)  Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein said.  “The market overreacted,” Blankfein, 58, said today in an
interview on CNBC. “The market, of course, took this as ‘Oh my
God, it’s the first moment and it was going to be an avalanche.’
And that doesn’t necessarily have to be the case.”  Fed officials have sought to clarify comments by Bernanke
that sparked turmoil in global financial markets. Bernanke said
on June 19 that the Fed could start curtailing the current $85
billion monthly pace of bond purchases later this year and end
them around mid-2014, assuming the economy meets the Fed’s
forecasts.  Federal Reserve Bank of  New York  President William C. Dudley said today the central bank may prolong its asset-purchase program if the economy’s performance fails to meet the
Fed’s forecasts. Dudley, 60, Goldman Sachs’s former chief U.S.
economist, also said an increase in the benchmark interest rate
is “very likely to be a long way off.”  Concerns the Fed may curtail accommodation helped push the
yield on the 10-year Treasury note as high as 2.61 percent this
week from as low as 1.63 percent in May. The average rate for a
30-year fixed mortgage rose to 4.46 percent from 3.93 percent,
the biggest one-week increase since 1987, McLean, Virginia-based
 Freddie Mac  said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
