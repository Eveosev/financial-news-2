U.S. stocks and Treasuries retreated
as comments from Federal Reserve Governor  Jeremy Stein  spurred
concern the central bank may begin to reduce stimulus in
September. The dollar rallied while gold trimmed its worst
quarterly drop on record.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.4 percent to
1,606.28 after rallying 2.6 percent in the previous three
sessions. More than 10 billion shares changed hands in the U.S.,
capping the busiest month for American  stock trading  since
November 2011. The benchmark 10-year U.S. note yield increased
two basis points to 2.49 percent after climbing as much as eight
points. Oil slipped for the first time in five days while gold
rallied more than 2 percent to trim its second-quarter slide to
less than 24 percent. The  Dollar Index  added 0.3 percent.  The Fed’sStein said policy makers are providing more
clarity about how the Fed will wind down its $85 billion in
monthly bond buying as unemployment falls toward 7 percent. If
the Fed makes a decision to begin reducing purchases in
September, he said, “it will give primary weight to the large
stock of news that has accumulated since the inception of the
program and will not be unduly influenced by whatever data
releases arrive in the few weeks before the meeting.”  “The use of the word September has got people in a bit of
a tizzy,” Dan Mulholland, head of Treasury trading at BNY
Mellon Capital Markets in  New York . “Every other Fed official
who’s spoken since Bernanke has been trying to soften his
comments, and this is not doing that. The market was leaning a
little long anyway, so this might be putting some downward
pressure on the market for that reason.”  $4.2 Trillion  About $4.2 trillion has been erased from the  value  of
global equities since Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said last
month policy makers could pare bond purchases should the economy
show sustained improvement. Fed Bank of Richmond President
 Jeffrey Lacker , who dissented against additional stimulus at
every Fed meeting last year, said financial markets will remain
volatile as policy makers debate how and when to curtail
stimulus.  Stocks rallied yesterday as Fed Bank of New York President
William C. Dudley said the central bank may prolong its asset-purchase program if the economy’s performance fails to meet
forecasts.  The  S&P 500 (SPX)  climbed 0.9 percent this week, trimming its
first monthly decline since October to 1.5 percent. The

 Dow Jones Industrial Average , which lost 115 points. BlackBerry,
the Canadian smartphone maker, fell 27 percent in Toronto for
its biggest loss of the year after reporting a surprise
quarterly loss.  “I’m not surprised to see some pullback from three days of
strength,”  Michael James , a managing director of equity trading
at Wedbush Securities Inc. in  Los Angeles , said in an interview.
“But bulls are still not willing to let things come in too much
with the end of quarter today,” he said, adding that the only
thing to count on “is continued trader-driven volatility, in
both directions.”  U.S. stock trading capped the busiest month since November
2011 and got another boost in volume today before Russell
