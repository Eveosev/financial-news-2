Cadila Healthcare Ltd. (CDH)  a generic-drug maker based in Ahmedabad, India, was sued by Alpex Pharma
SA for infringing a U.S. patent for the obesity drug Suprenza.  Alpex, based in Mezzovico,  Switzerland , contends Cadila,
doing business as Zydus Cadila, wrongly applied to the U.S. Food
& Drug Administration to sell low-cost copies of the medicine
before the patent expires in 2018, according to a lawsuit filed
yesterday in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware.  Unless blocked by a judge, premature sales of the generic
drug in the U.S. will cause “substantial and irreparable harm”
to Alpex, the company said in court papers.  Sujatha Rajesh, a Cadila spokeswoman, didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mailed request for comment on the lawsuit.  The case is Alpex v. Zydus, 13-cv-01143, U.S. District
Court, District of  Delaware  (Wilmington).  To see the patent, click: 6,149,938.  To contact the reporter on this story:
