Indian (SENSEX)  stocks surged the most in two
weeks after the rupee rebounded from a record low as the
nation’s current-account deficit narrowed and amid speculation
the U.S. central bank may hold back from reducing stimulus.  The S&P BSE Sensex rallied 1.1 percent to 18,747.70 at 9:29
a.m. in Mumbai.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , owner of the world’s
largest refining complex, soared 2 percent.  HDFC Bank Ltd., (HDFCB) 
 India ’s most valuable lender, paced gains among its peers.  The nation’s current-account deficit narrowed more than
estimated last quarter from a record, a moderation that may ease
pressure on the rupee, official data showed today. The U.S.
economy expanded at a revised 1.8 percent annualized rate from
January through March, down from a prior estimate of 2.4
percent, stoking speculation the Federal Reserve may continue
with its efforts to bolster growth.  Overseas investors are on course for the first monthly net
sales of Indian stocks since May 2012. They pulled $221 million
from domestic shares on June 25, an 11th day of net sales, the
longest series of outflows since November 2011. Foreign funds
have still purchased a net $13.6 billion this year, a record for
the period, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
