The U.K. will avoid power cuts as a
result of announcements to be made later today on shale gas, a
market for power generation capacity and renewable energy
contracts, Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change Ed
Davey said.  “We will be talking about draft strike prices, about
contract terms and about the capacity market,” Davey said in a
speech at an energy conference hosted by the Economist in  London 
today. “The combination of the announcements that we’re making
will mean that the lights of the country will stay on.”  “We will continue to need to maximize the potential of the
U.K. continental shelf,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
