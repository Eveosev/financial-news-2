TransAlta Corp. (TA) ,  Canada ’s largest
publicly traded renewable-power generator, jumped the most in
more than four years after announcing it will sell shares in a
new company that will hold about half of its wind and hydropower
assets.  TransAlta  rose  10 percent to C$14.36 at the close in
Toronto, the most since October 2008. The company said it
expects to raise C$200 million ($191 million) to C$250 million
from selling a 15 to 20 percent stake in the company and will
use the proceeds to repay debt.  The new company, TransAlta Renewables Inc., will hold 1,112
net megawatts worth of wind and hydro power generation, Calgary-based TransAlta said in a statement late yesterday.  The company
now owns 2,048 megawatts of wind and hydro capacity, according
to its website. The initial public offering is expected to close
in August. CIBC World Markets Inc. and RBC Capital Markets LLC
are lead underwriters for the sale.  “The move signals a new era of a greater focus on
delivering returns” for TransAlta’s shareholders, Benjamin Pham, a Toronto-based analyst with Bank of Montreal, wrote in a
note today. The company’s renewable assets have been undervalued
by the market for years, he wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
