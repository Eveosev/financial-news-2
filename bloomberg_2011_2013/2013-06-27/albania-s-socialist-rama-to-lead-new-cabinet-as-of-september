Albania’s Socialist Party, which won
June 23 general elections plans to form government in September
with its chairman, Edi Rama, heading a Cabinet that pledged to
end the flat tax and expand state health care.  Rama’s Socialists and three smaller allied parties won at
least 84 seats in the Balkan nation’s 140-seat parliament,
defeating a coalition led by Premier Sali Berisha’s Democrats,
which secured 53 seats, said Endri Fuga, the Socialists’
communications director, in a phone interview.  “The state Election Commission is yet to confirm the exact
numbers, but the results are based on 99.9 percent of ballots
counted,” Fuga said in Tirana after Berisha conceded defeat
yesterday and announce he will step down as the leader of the
 Democratic Party .  Berisha’s defeat ends his eight-year-long premiership,
during which he took the former communist country into the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization and pushed for the development of
ravaged infrastructure. Rama is a former mayor of the capital
and in the past accused Berisha of obstructing fair elections.  Rama will enjoy a “comfortable majority” in parliament
and plans to deliver his election promises to change the income
tax rate from a single 10 percent, Fuga said. The rate will be
reduced for lower-income citizens and raised for salaries above
1,500 euros a month, he said.  State-provided health care will be extended to unemployed
citizens, who account for 30 percent of Albania’s workforce,
Fuga said. The official jobless rate is 16 percent, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
