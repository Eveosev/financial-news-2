The won gained for a third day after
South Korea’s current-account surplus widened to a record in May
and the government raised its economic growth forecast.
Government bonds advanced.  The surplus in the widest measure of trade increased to
$8.64 billion in May, more than doubling from $3.93 billion in
April, the Bank of Korea reported today. The Finance Ministry
revised its 2013 growth estimate to 2.7 percent from 2.3 percent
and global funds bought more of the nation’s stocks than sold
today, ending a 14-day run of  net sales  in which $5.1 billion
was pulled from the market.  The won advanced 0.4 percent to close at 1,149.76 per
dollar in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in the
exchange rate used to price options, fell 22 basis points, or
0.22 percentage point, to a one-week low of 11.70 percent.  “The record current-surplus was the dominant factor that
supported the won today,” said Jude Noh, a Seoul-based chief
currency trader at Suhyup Bank. Foreigners stopped dumping local
stocks and the government’s “upbeat report” also helped, he
said.  Asia’s fourth-largest economy is likely to post a
“substantial” current-account surplus in June, though the size
may be smaller than in May, according to Kim Young Bae, director
general at the central bank. The Finance Ministry predicted a
surplus for this year of $38 billion, up from a previous
estimate of $29 billion, and said it expects economic growth to
quicken to 4 percent next year.  The yield on the 2.75 percent bonds due June 2016 fell
three basis points to 2.95 percent, declining for a third day,
prices from Korea Exchange Inc. show.  Bonds have rebounded this week from a four-day slide
through June 24 after the government said it may scale back
sales of the securities next month. The Finance Ministry is due
to release its bond-sale plan for July at 5 p.m. local time
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
