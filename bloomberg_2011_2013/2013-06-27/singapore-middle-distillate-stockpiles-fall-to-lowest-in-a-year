Middle-distillate inventories fell
to the lowest level in almost a year in  Singapore , Asia’s
largest oil-trading and storage center, according to a unit of
the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore supplies including gasoil, or diesel, and kerosene
slid by 881,000 barrels, or 9.4 percent, to 8.4 million in the
seven days ended yesterday,  International Enterprise Singapore 
said in an e-mailed statement today. That’s the lowest since the
week ended July 4, 2012.  Stockpiles of  residual fuels , including fuel oil and low-sulfur waxy residue and excluding bitumen, declined 3 million
barrels, or 12 percent, to 21.4 million, according to the data.
That’s the first drop in five weeks and the most since Aug. 15.  Light-distillate inventories including naphtha, gasoline
and reformate rose 516,000 barrels, or 6.1 percent, to 8.9
million, according to the data. Supplies climbed a second week
to a three-week high.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
