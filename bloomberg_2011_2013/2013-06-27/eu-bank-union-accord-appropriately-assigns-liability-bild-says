A banking union accord brokered by
European leaders yesterday that puts creditors at the forefront
of rescuing failing lenders is a breakthrough in righting “one
of the biggest injustices of the financial crisis,”  Germany ’s
Bild Zeitung said.  In an editorial published tomorrow, the country’s biggest-selling daily newspaper said the accord “finally puts liability
back on its feet again” after “millions of small taxpayers”
were forced to rescue banks across the EU.  “What does a German or an Italian checkout lady have to do
with the bad real-estate loans of a bankrupt Irish bank?” the
editorial asked, replying with the line: “That’s over now.”
The  Axel Springer AG (SPR)  paper with a circulation of about 3.3
million said it’s “bitter” that depositors may also be
enrolled in rescuing lenders alongside their owners and
creditors.  The main opposition Social Democrat and Green parties in
Germany, where an election will be held Sept. 22, said today the
accord was faulty, leaving too much scope to national
governments to shift bank rescues back to the shoulders of
taxpayers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
