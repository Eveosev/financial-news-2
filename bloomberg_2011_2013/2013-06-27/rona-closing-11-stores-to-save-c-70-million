Rona Inc. (RON) , Canada’s largest hardware
retailer, will close 11 stores in Ontario and British Columbia
and cut 125 administrative jobs, saving C$70 million ($67
million)  The closings and job reductions are part of a restructuring
plan aimed at saving C$110 million a year, the company said in a
statement today. Rona plans to invest 30 percent of the savings
into underperforming stores.  “Rona will become more agile and efficient, with a
simplified business structure and an even stronger balance
sheet,” Chief Executive Officer Robert Sawyer said in the
statement.  Rona will close eight stores in Ontario and three in
British Columbia. The job cuts will be in the company’s four
administrative centers in  Canada .  Rona fell 1.1 percent at C$9.71 yesterday in Toronto. The
shares dropped 7.5 percent in the 12 months through yesterday,
compared with a 5.5 percent gain in the Standard &
Poor’s/Toronto Stock Exchange Composite Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
