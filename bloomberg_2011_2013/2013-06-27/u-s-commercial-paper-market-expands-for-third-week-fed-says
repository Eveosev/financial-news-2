The market for corporate borrowing
through  commercial paper  expanded for a third week, led by an
increase in the short-term IOUs of nonfinancial firms.  The seasonally adjusted amount of U.S. commercial paper
increased $2 billion to $1.04 trillion outstanding in the week
ended yesterday, the Federal Reserve said today on its website.
Thatâ€™s the highest level since the market touched $1.048
trillion in the period ended May 29.  IOUs issued by  non-financial companies  rose for a ninth
week, climbing $9 billion to $231.4 billion outstanding, the
highest level since the period ended Feb. 27, the Fed said.
Corporations sell commercial paper, typically maturing in 270
days or less, to fund everyday activities such as rent and
salaries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
