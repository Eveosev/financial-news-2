Thailand ’s 10-year government bonds
rose after first-quarter growth figures from the U.S. trailed
estimates, spurring speculation the Federal Reserve may hold off
from reducing its monetary stimulus.  The world’s largest economy expanded at a revised 1.8
percent rate in the first three months of 2013, official data
showed yesterday, down from a prior estimate of 2.4 percent. Fed
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said June 19 the central bank may trim
its $85 billion a month of bond buying this year and end it in
2014 as long as the economy performs in line with its
projections. The purchases, known as quantitative easing, have
fueled demand for developing-nation stocks and bonds.  “Speculation of a delay in reduction of QE is positive for
emerging-market assets,” said  Tsutomu Soma , manager of Rakuten
Securities Inc.’s fixed-income business unit in  Tokyo . “All
eyes are on the U.S. data to determine outlooks for U.S.
monetary policy.”  The yield on the 3.625 percent bonds maturing in June 2023
dropped nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 3.87
percent as of 3:24 p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The rate has climbed 33 basis points since the end
of March, headed for the worst quarter since the first three
months of 2012.  Thailand’s finance ministry cut its 2013 growth forecast to
4 percent to 5 percent, Somchai Sujjapongse, director-general of
the fiscal policy office, said today at a press conference in
Bangkok. The previous estimate was 4.8 percent to 5.8 percent.  The baht strengthened 0.1 percent to 31.13 per dollar,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency has fallen
6 percent this quarter, the worst performance since September
2000. One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the exchange rate used to price options, declined 35 basis
points to 7.54 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
