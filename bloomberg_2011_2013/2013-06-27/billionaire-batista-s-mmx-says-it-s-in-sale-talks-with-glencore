MMX Mineracao & Metalicos SA (MMXM3)  is in
talks with companies including  Glencore Xstrata Plc (GLEN)  and
Trafigura Beheer BV to sell a stake in itself as the Brazilian
miner’s controlling shareholder, billionaire  Eike Batista , seeks
funds.  “MMX is holding talks with several market players,
including” Glencore and Trafigura, the Rio de Janeiro-based
miner said in a filing with the Brazilian markets regulator
yesterday after markets closed. “At this time no documents have
been signed and there are no definitions that allow the company
to say which road it will follow.” Newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo
reported the talks on June 25.  Batista this year sold stakes in crude producer OGX
Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA to Petroliam Nasional Bhd, and
in power producer MPX Energia SA to E.ON SE, as delayed projects
and missed targets in his commodities and energy empire wiped
about $30 billion from his personal fortune since a March 2012
peak. Batista is selling assets including one of his private
jets. EBX Group Co., his holding company, said this month that
it restructured its debt.  MMX has dropped 62 percent this year, compared with a 23
decline for Brazil’s benchmark iBovespa index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
