Sony Corp. (6758)  Chief Executive Officer
Kazuo Hirai received 153 million yen ($1.6 million) in annual
compensation as the Japanese electronics maker returned to its
first profit in five years.  That’s 74 percent higher than the 88 million yen he
received for the previous fiscal year, when he served as an
executive deputy president, according to a company filing today
with  Japan ’s Finance Ministry. Former Vice Chairman Ryoji Chubachi, who retired last week, received 194 million yen
including retirement funds, the filing shows.  Compensation for Hirai, 52, was lower than the 184 million
yen earned by  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  President  Akio Toyoda , who led
led a profit revival since taking control in June 2009. While
leading the maker of PlayStation 4 video-game consoles and
Bravia televisions to report a net income, Hirai gave up his
bonus for the year ended in March as the main electronics
operation remained unprofitable.  Hirai pledged to  shareholders  last week he will take bolder
measures to revive the electronics maker, which is losing  money 
in TVs and smartphones. “We expect our smartphone operation
will improve earnings,” he said. “Making the TV unit
profitable is a goal that must be met. We will accelerate
expansion in  emerging markets  and new businesses.”  Sony gained 1.7 percent to close at 2,035 yen in Tokyo
trading today. The  stock  is up 8.4 percent since Third Point LLC
founder Daniel Loeb proposed an initial public offering of the
company’s music and movie assets last month. The broader Topix
index is down 11 percent in the same period.  Cook, Mulally  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  CEO  Tim Cook  earned $4.17 million, including
$1.36 million in salary for 2012, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) ’s CEO Stephen Elop made 4.3 million euros ($5.6
million) for the year, the data show.  In the car industry, Alan Mulally, Ford’s chief and the
best paid among the top five, took home $21 million in 2012,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Nissan Motor Co.’s Carlos Ghosn, among Japan’s highest-paid
CEOs, earned 988 million yen in the year ended March 2013,
little changed from the previous year.  Sony last month  forecast  a 16 percent increase in profit
for the year started April 1 after posting its first net income
in four years helped by job cuts, asset sales and blockbuster
movies including “Skyfall.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
