Renault SA (RNO)  and Japanese partner
 Nissan Motor Co. (7201)  said annual cost savings from their 14-year-old
alliance jumped 54 percent to a record in 2012 as the carmakers
increasingly used common parts.  Cooperating on purchasing, manufacturing and design
resulted in new cost reductions of 2.69 billion euros ($3.5
billion) last year versus 1.75 billion euros in 2011, the
companies said today in a joint  statement .  Global carmakers are under increasing pressure to keep
costs down as they push into developing economies such as  China 
to reduce reliance on domestic markets with slower growth.
Renault, based in the Paris suburb of Boulogne-Billancourt, and
Yokohama-based Nissan have had a sales and manufacturing
partnership since 1999.  Fiat SpA (F) , which has its headquarters in
Turin,  Italy , is increasingly using common components with
Chrysler Group LLC, the U.S. auto producer it controls.  “Synergies and greater economies of scale allow Renault
and Nissan to compete in an elite tier of the world’s top
automakers,” Christian Mardrus, managing director for logistics
for the Renault-Nissan alliance, said in the statement. “We
expect to generate even more synergies going forward,
particularly in  emerging markets  such as  Brazil ,  Russia , India
and China.”  Renault was trading down 0.3 percent at 52.65 as of 11:14
a.m. in Paris, paring a decline of as much as 2.1 percent
earlier today. The stock has  gained  29 percent this year,
valuing the company at 15.6 billion euros.  Modular Production  The French carmaker said on June 19 that it’s introducing a
modular-production strategy with Nissan to build more vehicles
together. The common module family technology will help the
carmakers cut engineering and process costs 30 percent to 40
percent and spending on parts 20 percent to 30 percent by 2020,
Jean-Michel Billig, executive vice president of engineering and
quality, said at the time.  The technology, in which suppliers provide larger
components made of smaller parts that were previously installed
separately, will be introduced this year and next on production
of the the partners’ compact and larger models. The program will
be expanded to their subcompacts in 2015 and their city cars in
2016.  Renault and Nissan vehicles will share about 50 percent of
parts by 2020 through the new strategy, according to Billig. The
setup will help the French company maintain research and
development spending at current levels of 8 percent to 9 percent
of full-year revenue, he said on June 19.  The alliance’s biggest cost savings in 2012 came from
purchasing at 851 million euros, powertrain operations at 709
million euros and vehicle engineering at 546 million euros, the
companies said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
