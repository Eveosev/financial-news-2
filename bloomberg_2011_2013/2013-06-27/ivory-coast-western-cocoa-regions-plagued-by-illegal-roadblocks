The setting up of illegal
roadblocks, including by military and police forces, has surged
since the beginning of the year in parts of western cocoa
growing regions of top producer  Ivory Coast , according to a
report.  A total of 160 roadblocks, of which only three were
authorized by the West African nation’s authorities, were
recorded since January by the International Rescue Committee in
five districts, the New York-based non-governmental organization
said in a report.  The IRC observed a “proliferation of the checkpoints” in
the cocoa-growing region near to Liberia, it said. IRC reported
as many as 50 and 69 illegal checkpoints in the districts of
Duekoue and Bangolo respectively, while others were observed in
the districts of Man, Danane and Kouibly.  The government of Ivory Coast, which produces about 37
percent of the world’s cocoa supplies, last year drew up a list
of 33 legal checkpoints across the country. Money taken
illegally by soldiers and police from cocoa transporters reached
an estimated 10 billion CFA francs ($19 million) during the
2011-12 harvest season, according to the Transport Fluidity
Observatory, a government agency.  Ivory Coast said last year it aimed to halve the loss this
season by setting up a partnership between the cocoa regulating
body, the Coffee Cocoa Council, the state Anti-Racketeering Unit
and the Transport Fluidity Observatory to remove illegal
roadblocks.  Most of the unauthorized checkpoints were manned by
military, paramilitary and police forces, IRC said. A group of
traditional hunters, also known as Dozos, set up 33 illegal
positions, the majority of them in Duekoue and Bangolo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
