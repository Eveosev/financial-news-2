Chinese equities rose in New York,
led by companies that do most of their business online, after
valuations for the benchmark index dropped to a 10-month low.  The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Chinese stocks in the U.S. added 1.1 percent to 85.34 yesterday,
trimming its quarterly drop to 7.4 percent. Online retailer  E-Commerce China Dangdang Inc. (DANG)  jumped 3.8 percent while web game
company  NetEase (NTES)  Inc. gained the most in a month. Qihoo 360
Technology Co. advanced for a fourth day and  Cnooc Ltd. (883)  traded
at a premium to the Hong Kong stock for a fourth day.  A three-day rebound in the China-US gauge has pared its
decline to 4.9 percent this month. The index’s slide this
quarter dragged its  valuation  to 0.84 times net assets earlier
this week, the lowest ratio since August, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. China’s  seven-day repurchase rate , which
measures interbank liquidity, dropped for a fifth day yesterday
after the central bank injected cash to ease a fund shortage
that threatened to curb economic growth.  “Most Chinese Internet companies have healthy
financials,” Tan Chiheng, an analyst at Granite  Point Capital
Inc. (PTCI)  in  Boston , which invests in Chinese equities, said in a
telephone interview. “The cash-rich Internet companies, such as
online game companies, will be less impacted by this recent
credit crunch situation.”  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (FXI) , the largest Chinese
 exchange-traded fund  in the U.S., climbed 0.7 percent to $32.49,
the highest level this week. It is down 9.8 percent in June,
poised for the biggest loss since May 2012. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index increased 0.6 percent as U.S. consumer spending
and sales of existing homes jumped while jobless claims
declined.  E-Commerce Performance  Dangdang’s American depositary receipts advanced to $7.09,
poised for a 10 percent gain in June. The Beijing-based company,
China’s biggest online book seller, has surged 71 percent this
quarter after adding sales of discount fashion goods in its
online store.  “Good” share performance in e-commerce peers like  Vipshop (VIPS) 
Holdings Ltd. and  LightInTheBox (LITB)  Holding Co. has sparked
investors’ interest in Dangdang, according to Granite’s Tan.
Dangdang will rise further should the company be able to make a
profit, he said.  Dangdang’s first-quarter net loss decreased 27 percent to
72.7 million  yuan  ($11.7 million) from a year earlier, according
to its statement May 17.  LightInTheBox, a web seller of lifestyle products which
raised $78.9 million earlier this month in its initial public
offering, advanced 0.7 percent to $13.75 in New York for a 45
surge from the IPO price.  Qihoo, NetEase  Vipshop, a Guangzhou-based Internet retailer of branded
fashion, rose 3 percent to $28.17, capping a 58 percent increase
this year.  Cnooc, China’s biggest offshore oil explorer, climbed 1.8
percent to a one-week high of $165.16 in New York. Its ADRs,
each representing 100 underlying shares in the Beijing-based
company, traded 0.3 percent above the Hong Kong-traded stock.  Qihoo (QIHU) , which owns China’s second-biggest online search
engine, jumped 3.9 percent to $46.71, extending a four-day rally
to 8.9 percent.  NetEase, based in Beijing, added 3.6 percent to $61.04 for
the biggest rally since May 20, and  Ctrip.com International
Ltd. (CTRP) , China’s largest online travel agency, climbed 2.7 percent
on a third day of advances to a one-week high of $32.72.  Seaspan Corp. (SSW) , a Hong Kong-based ship-leasing company part-owned by Tiger Group Investments, sank 6 percent to $20.21 in
New York, the lowest price in two months. Trading volume on the
stock was more than four times the daily average over the past
three months, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  The company’s stock was downgraded to underperform, an
equivalent to sell, from market perform at  Wells Fargo
Securities LLC  yesterday.  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index slipped less than 0.1
percent to 9,158.61, after soaring 3.3 percent the previous day.
The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  fell 0.1 percent to 1,950.01,
dropping for a seventh day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
