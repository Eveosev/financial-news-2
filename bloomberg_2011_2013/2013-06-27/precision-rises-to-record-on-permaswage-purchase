Precision Castparts Corp. (PCP)  jumped to
a record high after the maker of metal forgings for  jet engines 
agreed to purchase Permaswage SAS for $600 million in cash.  The acquisition, announced yesterday, adds Permaswage’s
aerospace fluid fittings to Precision’s aviation parts
offerings. Portland, Oregon-based Precision  rose  2.7 percent to
$225.66 at 12:03 p.m. in  New York , after reaching $226.82, the
highest intraday price since at least 1983, Bloomberg data show.  Chief Executive Officer Mark Donegan has been on a buying
spree, targeting about 10 takeovers within the last year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Planemakers  Boeing Co. (BA) 
and Airbus SAS have urged suppliers to consolidate to help
support record increases in jet output.  Precision “has a tried and tested acquisition strategy,
and we think the potential upside to EPS from this increased
aerospace exposure is likely to be well received,” Robert Stallard, an analyst at  RBC Capital Markets  in New York, wrote
in a note to investors.  Stallard rates the shares as top pick, the equivalent of a
buy recommendation.  The Permaswage transaction will add to Precision’s earnings
immediately and is projected to be completed during the second
quarter of 2014, according to a statement yesterday.  Closely held Permaswage, based in Gardena, California, has
manufacturing locations in Paris and in Suzhou, China, and
employs about 680 workers.  In November, Precision agreed to buy Titanium Metals Corp.
for $2.9 billion after buying pipe processor Texas Honing Inc.
the month before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
