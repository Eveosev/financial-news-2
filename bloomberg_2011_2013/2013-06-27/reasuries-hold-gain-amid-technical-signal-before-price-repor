Treasuries rose for a second day as
Federal Reserve Bank of  New York  President William C. Dudley
said the central bank may prolong its asset-purchase program if
the economy’s performance fails to meet the Fed’s forecasts.  Bonds pared gains after the National Association of
Realtors’  index (BUSY)  of pending U.S. home sales jumped 6.7 percent to
112.3, the highest since December 2006. Treasuries maintained
gains earlier after U.S. consumer spending rebounded and claims
for jobless benefits fell. Pacific Investment Management Co.’s
 Bill Gross  said 10-year yields may fall a quarter-percentage
point. The U.S. will sell $29 billion of seven-year securities.  “The Fed is trying to steer the market a little bit away
from thinking rates are going to go up” soon, said  Ray Remy ,
head of fixed income in New York at Daiwa Capital Markets
America Inc. “They are on hold for a long period.”  The 10-year yield decreased three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 2.5 percent at 12:16 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. It touched 2.46
percent, the lowest since June 21. The 1.75 percent note due in
May 2023 gained 1/4, or $2.50 per $1,000 face amount, to 93
14/32. The yield dropped seven basis points yesterday, the
biggest decline since June 13, after touching 2.66 percent on
June 24, the highest since August 2011.  Thirty-year (USGG30YR)  bond yields fell three basis points to 3.55
percent. They dropped as much as seven basis points earlier.  June Loss  Treasuries lost 1.8 percent this month through yesterday,
according to the Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Bond Index. The MSCI
World Index of shares declined 3 percent in the same period,
including reinvested dividends.  Treasuries have fallen 2.6
percent this quarter and 2.8 percent this year, according to the
Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Treasury Index.  “If labor market conditions and the economy’s growth
momentum were to be less favorable than in the FOMC’s outlook --
and this is what has happened in recent years -- I would expect
that the asset purchases would continue at a higher pace for
longer,” Dudley said in a speech today in New York. He serves
as vice chairman of the  Federal Open Market Committee  and has
never dissented from a monetary policy decision.  The U.S. central bank is purchasing $85 billion of  U.S.
government debt  and mortgage-backed securities every month to
put downward pressure on borrowing costs during the third round
of its quantitative-easing stimulus program. The Fed bought $5.1
billion in Treasuries today due from June 2017 to February 2018.
Dealers had submitted $10.5 billion of securities.  The Fed has kept its benchmark  interest-rate  target at zero
to 0.25 percent since 2008 to support the economy.  Bernanke Comments  Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said June 19 the central bank may
slow stimulus this year and end it entirely in mid-2014.
Speaking after the FOMC’s two-day meeting, he said tapering the
purchases would depend on economic growth being in line with the
Fed’s estimates. Policy makers are  forecasting  growth of as much
as 2.6 percent this year and 3.5 percent next year.  Richmond Fed President  Jeffrey Lacker  said yesterday the
central bank isn’t close to decreasing its balance sheet.  “We’re not anywhere near decreasing the balance sheet
yet,” Lacker, who doesn’t vote on the FOMC this year, said in a
Bloomberg Television interview with  Peter Cook . “This asset-purchase tapering is just slowing the rate at which we’re
increasing the balance sheet.”  U.S. household purchases, which account for about 70
percent of the economy, rose 0.3 percent in May after a 0.3
percent decline the prior month that was the biggest since
September 2009, Commerce Department figures showed today in
Washington. Incomes advanced 0.5 percent, more than projected.  Initial jobless claims decreased by 9,000 to 346,000 in the
week ended June 22 from a revised 355,000 the prior period, the
Labor Department reported today in  Washington .  Note Auction  The seven-year notes scheduled for sale today yielded 1.955
percent in pre-auction trading, which would be the  highest  since
an offering in July 2011.  The previous sale of the securities on May 30 drew a yield
of 1.496 percent. Investors bid for 2.7 times the amount of
available debt last month, versus 2.71 times in April.  The U.S. sold $35 billion of two-year notes on June 25 and
an equal amount of five-year debt yesterday.  Pimco’s Gross said global markets are reducing risk because
of speculation about the Fed’s policy.  “In trying to be specific about which conditions would
prompt a tapering of QE, the Fed tilted overrisked investors to
one side of an overloaded and overlevered boat,” Gross said in
his  July commentary , titled “The Tipping Point,” posted on
Pimco’s website. “Don’t panic,” he wrote.  Pimco Losses  Newport Beach , California-based Gross’s $285 billion  Pimco
Total Return Fund (PTTRX)  led declines among the most-popular bond
mutual funds earlier this month after the Bernanke’s comments on
asset purchases sparked a global selloff in bonds.  Gross’s flagship, the world’s largest mutual fund, lost 1.6
percent from June 18 through June 20, the day after the Fed
outlined its exit scenario, and is  down  3.59 percent for the
year, beating just 12 percent of peers.  The Pimco chief forecasts the 10-year yield may fall about
20 to 25 basis points, helping the fund to “get back some of
those losses that we experienced in May and June.” He spoke in
a Bloomberg Radio interview with  Tom Keene  and  Michael McKee .  Gross said he likes “safe assets that are over-yielded and
underpriced,” including five-year and 10-year securities. He
said he’s looking for “a mini-bull market for the next several
months.”  The  difference in yield  between 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a measure of expectations for
inflation over the life of the securities, widened to 2
percentage points after shrinking to 1.81 percentage points on
June 24, the narrowest since October 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
