The wrecked plane that carried
fashion executive Vittorio Missoni was found this morning off
 Venezuela ’s Los Roques islands after a six-month search.  The aircraft is 76 meters (249 feet) underwater north of
the archipelago, Public Prosecutor Luisa Ortega said in an e-mailed statement. No bodies have been found so far.  Missoni and five other passengers and crew disappeared Jan.
4 after taking off from Los Roques for the capital Caracas.  Missoni, 58, was responsible for marketing at the eponymous
maker of colorful zig-zag patterned knitwear worn by celebrities
including Madonna and  Jennifer Lopez .  Plans to raise the plane to the surface are being
evaluated, Sumirago, Italy-based Missoni SpA said today in a
statement. “The families would like to thank the Venezuelan and
Italian governments for making this search possible,” the
company said.  Founded in the 1950s by Vittorio’s parents, Ottavio and
Rosita, Missoni is run by Vittorio’s siblings Luca and Angela
and non-family member chief executive officer Alberto Piantoni.  Earlier this month authorities located the debris of
another airplane that crashed off Los Roques on the same day
five years earlier. All 14 people on board the aircraft operated
by Transaven, including eight Italian citizens, are presumed
dead.  Venezuela’s premier Caribbean resort destination, Los
Roques, lies about 170 kilometers north of South American
mainland.  To contact the reporters on this story:
