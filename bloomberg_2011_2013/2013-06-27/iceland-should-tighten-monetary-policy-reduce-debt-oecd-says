Iceland needs to raise  interest
rates  to combat inflation and should target debt-relief measures
for households in financial distress, the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development said.  Iceland should “continue to tighten  monetary policy  as
activity recovers to reduce inflation to the target rate and
anchor inflation expectations,” the Paris-based OECD said in an
economic survey of the island released today. Further debt
writedowns should be aimed at “households in financial stress
to reduce  default risk  most effectively.”  Iceland’s  inflation rate  exceeds the central bank’s 2.5
percent target, fueled by a weak krona. Annual inflation was 3.3
percent in May, slowing from 5.4 percent a year earlier. Iceland
imposed capital restrictions after the failure of its biggest
banks in 2008. The government sought to halt a krona sell-off
when the currency lost as much as 80 percent against the euro on
the offshore market. Even so, the controls have failed to
prevent a slide of about 8 percent in the krona against the euro
from a high at the end of January.  Icelandic lenders have forgiven  household debt  equal to
about 12 percent of gross domestic product since the bank
failure. Through the end of 2012, the island’s lenders had
written off 212.2 billion kronur ($1.7 billion), according to
the Icelandic Financial Services Association. The group
estimates a further 35.3 billion kronur will be forgiven this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
