Principal Financial Group Inc., the
seller of life insurance and retirement products, agreed to sell
$200 million of deposits to BofI Holding Inc. as part of an
effort to limit its role in banking amid greater U.S. oversight.  The deal includes funds from individual checking accounts
and certificates of deposit, BofI said today in a regulatory
filing that didnâ€™t disclose terms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
