Ten Libyans died and 97 were injured
in two days of clashes between militias, and with security
forces in the capital.  The violence prompted the government to order military
camps removed from Tripoli, state-owned Libyan News Agency said
today.  Prime Minister Ali Zaidan said the government and the
parliament agreed to “clear Greater Tripoli of all camps
belonging to the defense ministry present inside the city,”
LANA quoted him as saying.  To contact the reporters on this story:
