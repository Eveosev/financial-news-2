A gauge of U.S. corporate credit
risk fell for a third straight day as investors await reports on
consumer spending and jobless claims.  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, decreased
2.6 basis points to a mid-price of 85.4 basis points at 8:01
a.m. in New York, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  Investors are looking for signs of strengthening in the
worldâ€™s largest economy to determine when the Federal Reserve
will reduce the pace of its $85 billion monthly bond purchases,
which has bolstered the credit markets. A Commerce Department
report at 8:30 a.m. in  Washington  may show consumer spending
rose 0.3 percent in May, according to a Bloomberg survey of
economists. Initial claims for jobless benefits fell by 9,000 to
345,000 last week, a release from the Labor Department may show.  The credit-swaps index typically falls as investor
confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
