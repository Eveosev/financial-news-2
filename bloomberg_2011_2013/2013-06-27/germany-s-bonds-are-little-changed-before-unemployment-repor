European government bonds rose after
the region’s finance chiefs reached an agreement on how to
handle failing banks, bolstering investor confidence that policy
makers can overcome the euro-area financial crisis.  Italy’s securities advanced as demand increased at a 5
billion-euro ($6.5 billion) auction of five- and 10-year debt.
 Spain (GSPG10YR) ’s 10-year yield dropped to the lowest level in a week
after falling the most since January yesterday on a pledge by
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi to keep monetary
policy accommodative. German bunds rose for a third day.  “The agreement on the bank recovery has to be taken as a
positive,” said Alessandro Giansanti, a senior interest-rate
strategist at ING Groep NV in Amsterdam. “That has been a
relevant concern for the market in the previous weeks. The ECB
comments re-affirming that an accommodative stance is still in
place have reduced anxiety in the market.”  Italy’s 10-year bond yield fell 13 basis points, or 0.13
percentage point, to 4.57 percent at 4:55 p.m. London time after
dropping 15 basis points yesterday, the most since June 7. The
4.5 percent security due in May 2023 rose 1.025, or 10.25 euros
per 1,000-euro face amount, to 99.855.  The yield on similar-maturity Spanish debt dropped six
basis points to 4.78 percent after reaching 4.73 percent, the
 lowest  since June 20. The rate fell 23 basis points yesterday,
the biggest decline since Jan. 10.  Emergency Talks  European Union ministers settled on guidelines for
assigning losses to private creditors and regulating public
assistance following seven hours of emergency negotiations in
Brussels. They also spelled out when governments can step in and
established a role for the European Stability Mechanism, the
euro area’s 500 billion-euro firewall fund.  The ECB’s monetary policy “will stay accommodative for the
foreseeable future,” Draghi said yesterday in Paris. “We have
an open mind about all other possible instruments that we may
consider proper to adopt.” An end to the policy remains “very
distant,” he told reporters.  The ECB lowered its main  interest rate  to a record-low 0.5
percent on May 2.  Government bonds around the world tumbled after Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said on June 19 U.S. policy
makers may begin paring asset purchases this year and end them
in mid-2014.  Spain’s 10-year yields increased from this year’s low of
3.94 percent set on May 3. Spanish securities have lost 1.6
percent this month through yesterday, according to the Bloomberg
Spain Sovereign Bond  Index. (BITA)   Italian Auctions  Italy auctioned 2.5 billion euros of debt due in 2023 at an
average yield of 4.55 percent. The nation last sold 10-year
bonds on May 30 at an  average yield  of 4.14 percent, up from
3.94 percent at a previous auction on April 29, the lowest rate
since October 2010. Investors bid for 1.46 times the amount
sold, up from a bid-to-cover ratio of 1.38 in May.  “Demand for the 10-year sale was higher than previously
and the rise in the auction yield was not particularly
striking,” said  Luca Cazzulani , a senior fixed-income
strategist at UniCredit Global Research in Milan. “With this
potential obstacle passed, there is room today for Italian bonds
to continue outperforming.”  The Treasury in  Rome  also allotted 2.5 billion euros of
five-year notes at 3.47 percent. That compares with a rate of
3.01 percent at a previous sale on May 30.  Italy’s  10-year yield  climbed from as low as 3.68 percent
on May 3 to reach as much as 4.94 percent yesterday. The
nation’s securities dropped 2.6 percent this month through
yesterday, the Bloomberg Italy Sovereign Bond Index shows.  Germany ’s government bonds advanced even as a report showed
 unemployment  in the euro area’s biggest economy unexpectedly
dropped in June.  Unemployment Falls  The number of people out of work in Germany fell 12,000
this month to 2.94 million after a revised 17,000 gain in May,
the Federal Labor Office in Nuremberg said. Economists predicted
a June increase of 8,000, according to the median of 35
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  Ten-year bund yields fell four basis points to 1.73
percent. The rate also declined four basis points yesterday.  Cyprus offered to swap 1 billion euros of its shorter-dated
government bonds for others with longer maturities as it sought
to meet the requirements of the 10 billion-euro rescue deal
agreed on in March.  An  index (BSPS)  of  consumer confidence  in the currency bloc rose
to minus 18.8 from minus 21.9 in May, the European Commission in
Brussels said today, in line with the median estimate of 22
economists in a Bloomberg survey. That’s the highest level since
August 2011.  Spanish securities earned 4.8 percent this year through
yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Italian
bonds returned 1 percent, while German securities lost 1.9
percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
