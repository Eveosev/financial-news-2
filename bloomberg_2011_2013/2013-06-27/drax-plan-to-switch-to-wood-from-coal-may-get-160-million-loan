The  European Investment Bank  is
considering whether to approve a loan to  Drax Group Plc (DRX)  for its
plan to convert Britain’s largest coal-fired power station to
burn wood.  The bank  may lend 123 million euros ($160 million) to the
project that will help Drax turn half the six units at its site
in Selby, northeast England, to burn biomass in the next three
to four years, the EIB said today in a statement on its website.  Drax already has received funding from the U.K.’s Green
Investment Bank alongside  Prudential Plc (PRU)  and the M&G U.K.
Companies Financing Fund toward its $1 billion plan.  RWE AG (RWE)  of
Germany and the Dutch utility Dong Energy A/S are also switching
to renewable fuels as they strive to meet European Union air-pollution standards.  To contact the reporter on this story:
