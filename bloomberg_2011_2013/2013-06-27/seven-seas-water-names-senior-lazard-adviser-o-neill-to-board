Seven Seas Water Corp., a Tampa,
Florida-based water company that operates in the Caribbean and
Latin America, named Brian O’Neill, a senior adviser at  Lazard
Ltd. (LAZ) , to its board of directors.  O’Neill was former deputy assistant secretary, Western
Hemisphere, for the U.S. Treasury Department and chairman of
investment banking for Latin America and  Canada  at JPMorgan
Chase & Co., Seven Seas said.  “The combination of Brian’s financial expertise and
intimate knowledge of Latin America provides a strong complement
to our board,” Chairman Doug Brown said today in a statement.  “Potable water represents one of the most urgent needs of
this century, and Seven Seas is particularly well-positioned to
capitalize on that opportunity,” O’Neill said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
