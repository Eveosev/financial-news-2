Japanese  stocks  rose, with the  Topix (TPX) 
index halting a three-day loss, as slower-than-expected U.S.
economic growth increased speculation the Federal Reserve will
maintain stimulus.  Honda Motor Co., a carmaker that gets 47 percent of revenue
in North America, added 3.2 percent after its outlook was raised
at Moody’s Investor Service. A gauge tracking developers soared
8.8 percent, leading gains as all 33 Topix groups rose.
 ReproCell Inc. (4978) , a stem-cell research company, went untraded for
a second day after debuting yesterday on the JASDAQ Stock Index,
with bids to buy outnumbering offers to sell by 2-to-1.  The Topix climbed 2.8 percent to 1,098.83 at the close in
 Tokyo . Volume was 33 percent below the 30-day average. The
Nikkei 225 Stock Average added 3 percent to 13,213.55, with only
14 companies falling.  “It’s quite interesting that bad data sometimes becomes
good,” said Nader Naeimi, Sydney-based head of dynamic asset
allocation at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which manages more
than $130 billion. “The market is worried that if short-term
growth in particular shows strong signs, then maybe monetary
stimulus will be removed quickly.”  The Topix has fallen 14 percent from an almost five-year
high on May 22. The measure traded at 13.9 times average
estimated earnings, compared with 14.5 for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index and 12.6 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Exporters Gain  Futures on the S&P 500 rose 0.3 percent. The gauge added 1
percent yesterday after data showed the economy expanded at a
revised 1.8 percent rate in the first quarter, down from a prior
estimate of 2.4 percent. The Federal Reserve won’t taper
stimulus unless the economy improves in line with projections,
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said on June 19.  Exporters to the U.S. gained, with Honda adding 3.2 percent
to 3,605 yen.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s biggest carmaker,
rose 3.5 percent to 5,900 yen after its outlook was also raised
by Moody’s.  The Topix Real Estate Index surged 8.8 percent, the biggest
jump since April 5.  Mitsui Fudosan Co. (8801) ,  Japan ’s largest property
company by sales, advanced 9.6 percent to 2,788 yen.  Mitsubishi
Estate Co. (8802) , the No. 1 by market value, soared 9.4 percent to
2,476 yen.  The Topix pared this week’s loss to less than 0.1 percent
as concerns eased about a cash crunch in  China . The People’s
Bank of China said June 25 it has provided liquidity to some
financial institutions to stabilize money-market rates and will
use other tools to ensure steady markets.  ‘Clear Message’  “They are sacrificing short-term pain for long-term
stability,” Naeimi at AMP Capital said. “When they let short-term lending rates spike and stood back for a while, they just
wanted to send a clear message to banks that they should manage
liquidity or reduce lending.”  The Topix has swung an average of about 3.1 percent daily
since May 22. The gauge’s 30-day  historic volatility  was at
41.36 today, near its highest level since the 2011 earthquake
and tsunami.  Foreign investors bought a net 171.2 billion yen ($1.75
billion) in Japanese stocks during the week ended June 21, the
most since the week through May 17, according to figures
released by the Finance Ministry today.  In contrast, Japanese institutions pared their domestic
shares to 28 percent of the market’s total value at the end of
March, the lowest ever, according to Japan Exchange Group Inc.  ReproCell Debut  On the JASDAQ market, ReproCell was bid at 17,510 as of
3:08 p.m. in Tokyo and is poised to begin trading more than five
times higher than its IPO price of 3,200 yen. Founded in 2003,
ReproCell is the first company licensed to generate induced
pluripotent stem cells, or iPS cells, according to the company’s
website. iPS cells could potentially be used to improve vision
and treat cancer.  Japan’s government yesterday approved the world’s first
clinical research using the cells, the Nikkei newspaper said.  Among stocks that fell,  PeptiDream Inc. (4587)  slumped 19 percent
to 6,250 yen on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Mothers market for
smaller companies, after plummeting 28 percent yesterday. The
drugmaker canceled a research and development pact with Pfizer
Inc. The TSE Mothers Index rose 0.6 percent after plunging 12
percent yesterday, its second-biggest fall this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
