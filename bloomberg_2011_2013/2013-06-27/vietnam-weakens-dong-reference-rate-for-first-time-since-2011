Vietnam ’s central bank will weaken
the dong’s reference rate to the dollar for the first time since
2011 amid efforts by the government to boost exports and spur
the economy.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam will adjust the rate to 21,036
dong per dollar from 20,828, or a change of 1 percent, effective
tomorrow, it said in a statement on its website today. The
regulator aims “to improve balance of payment and increase
foreign exchange reserves.”  The government’s target of 5.5 percent growth this year, if
met, would represent the first time economic expansion slipped
below 6 percent for three straight years since 1988, according
to data from the  International Monetary Fund . Vietnam’s economy
expanded 5 percent last year, the slowest since 1999.  The dong is allowed to trade by as much as 1 percent daily
on either side of the reference rate, which has remained
unchanged since Dec. 26, 2011, according to the central bank.
The currency traded at 21,018 per dollar as of today’s close
compared with 21,036 yesterday, according to prices from banks
compiled by Bloomberg.  The adjustment is “to more accurately reflect the supply
and demand of foreign currency in the market” and to “create
stability” for the foreign-exchange market, the central bank
said in the statement. It said it will use all necessary
measures to ensure the stability of the  exchange rate .  Vietnam’s currency has weakened 0.4 percent against the
greenback so far this quarter. The benchmark VN Index for stocks
has gained more than 16 percent this year.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
