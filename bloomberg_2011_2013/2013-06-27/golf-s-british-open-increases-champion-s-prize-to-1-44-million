The winner of golf’s British Open
next month will receive 945,000 pounds ($1.44 million), a 5
percent increase over last year, organizers said.  The total purse at Muirfield in  Scotland  will rise to 5.25
million pounds from 5 million last year, the Royal and Ancient
Golf Club, which runs the sport’s oldest major championship,
said in a statement.  The champion’s prize in dollar terms is equal to that won
by Adam Scott at the Masters Tournament in April and Justin Rose
at this month’s U.S. Open.  South African Ernie Els earned $1.38 million at current
exchange rates for winning the 2012 Open at Royal Lytham & St.
Annes in northwest England. The British Open will be played July
18-21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
