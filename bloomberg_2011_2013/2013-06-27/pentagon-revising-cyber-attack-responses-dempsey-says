The Defense Department is rewriting
the rules of engagement for responding to computer assaults on
military networks, Army General Martin Dempsey, the top U.S.
military official said today.  To ensure that the military “is able to operate at network
speed, rather than what I call ‘swivel-chair’ speed, we now have
a playbook for cyber,” Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, said in prepared remarks for a conference in Washington.
Those rules are being updated for the first time in seven years
to improve command and control for military forces responsible
for defending against cyber-attacks, he said.  Under directions issued by President  Barack Obama  that
spell out how different parts of the U.S. government must
respond to an attack on networks, the Pentagon “has developed
emergency procedures to guide our response to imminent,
significant cyberthreats,” Dempsey said at the event organized
by the  Brookings Institution .  Efforts to consolidate the Defense Department’s “sprawling
mass” of 15,000 networks include “building a secure 4G
wireless network that will get iPads, iPhones and Android
devices online by mid-2014,” Dempsey said.  “In fact I have a secure mobile phone with me here
today,” he said. “This phone would make both Batman and  James
Bond  jealous.”  Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel this month cited “the
growing threat of cyber-intrusions, some of which appear to be
tied to the Chinese government and military.” His predecessor,
 Leon Panetta , said last year that “a cyber-attack perpetrated
by nation states or violent extremist groups could be as
destructive as the terrorist attack of 9/11.”  Companies Falter  While the U.S. military has made significant progress in
being able to defend against attacks on its networks, “our
nation’s effort to protect civilian critical infrastructure is
lagging,” Dempsey said. “Too few companies have invested
adequately in cybersecurity,” which may allow adversaries to
exploit weaknesses, he said.  Since Dempsey became chairman of the Joint Chiefs in
October 2011, intrusions into U.S. critical infrastructure,
including computer systems that operate chemical, electrical,
water and transportation systems,“ have increased 17-fold,” he
said.  In the next four years, the Pentagon plans to spend $23
billion on cybersecurity and hire 4,000 recruits for the effort,
Dempsey said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
