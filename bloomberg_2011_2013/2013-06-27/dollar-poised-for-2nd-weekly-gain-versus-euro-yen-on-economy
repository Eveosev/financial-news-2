The dollar rallied against the
majority of its most-traded counterparts as Federal Reserve
Governor Jeremy Stein said the central bank may make a decision
in September about tapering monetary stimulus.  The yen fell to the weakest level versus the dollar since
June 6 and 10-year Treasury  yields  rose as Fed officials sought
to clarify policy on providing stimulus to the world’s biggest
economy. The euro reversed gains and the International Monetary
Fund said the currency made up the smallest share of allocated
central-bank reserves since 2004.  Stein’s comments “really got Treasuries moving and got the
dollar steam rolling,” Brian Kim, a currency strategist at
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc’s RBS Securities unit in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut , said in a telephone interview.  The dollar rose 0.8 percent to 99.14 per yen at 5 p.m. in
New York. The greenback added 0.2 percent $1.3010 per euro.
 Japan ’s currency weakened 0.6 percent to 128.97 per euro.  U.S. 10-year note yields rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 2.49 percent after touching 2.55 percent.  Futures traders for a fourth week decreased bets that the
yen will decline against the dollar, figures from the
Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading Commission show.  Futures Positions  The difference in the number of wagers by hedge funds and
other large speculators on a decline in the yen compared with
those on a gain -- so-called net shorts -- was 61,462 on June
25, compared with net shorts of 61,890 a week earlier.  South Africa’s rand has gained 2 percent to the greenback
this month, while  Australia ’s dollar has declined 4.5 percent.
This quarter, the euro has led all major gainers with a 1.5
percent increase, while the worst-performing Aussie has slipped
12.3 percent. The greenback is the best-performing currency in
2013 and the rand has plunged 14.2 percent.  India ’s currency gained the most in nine months as
investors reassessed projections for a reduction in U.S.
stimulus. The rupee surged as much as 1.7 percent, the most
since Sept. 21, before trading at 59.39 per dollar. That pared
its drop this year to 7.4 percent.  The U.S. dollar was 62.2 percent of allocated reserves in
the January-March period, compared with 61.2 percent the prior
quarter, according to the IMF data. The euro’s share was 23.7
percent, compared with 24.2 percent in the fourth quarter of
2012, it showed.  Reserve Balances  Reserve managers around the world held about $194 billion
in Australian and Canadian currencies, according to the first
IMF data on the global holdings of the two currencies.  The Australian dollar was 1.63 percent of $6.05 trillion in
identified official foreign-exchange reserves in the first
quarter and the Canadian currency was 1.57 percent of the total,
the IMF data showed.  Australia’s dollar declined 1.5 percent to 91.38 U.S.
cents, reaching its weakest level since Sept. 8, 2010.  Canada ’s
dollar fell 0.4 percent to C$1.0519 per U.S. dollar.  The Fed is providing more clarity about how it will wind
down its $85 billion in monthly bond buying as unemployment
falls toward 7 percent, he said.  The policy-making Federal Open Market Committee should “be
clear that in making a decision in, say, September, it will give
primary weight to the large stock of news that has accumulated
since the inception of the program and will not be unduly
influenced by whatever data releases arrive in the few weeks
before the meeting -- as salient as these releases may appear to
be to market participants,” the Fed’s Stein said.  Economic Data  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan said its final
index of confidence eased to 84.1 this month from 84.5 at the
end of May, which was the highest since July 2007. The median
forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for 83 in
the gauge after a preliminary reading of 82.7. The MNI Chicago
Report’s business barometer dropped to 51.6 this month from 58.7
in May, which was the highest in more than a year. The median
forecast of 55 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 55.  The Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the dollar
against 10 major currencies weighted by liquidity and trade
flows,  gained  0.3 percent to 1,040.48, reaching the highest
level on a closing basis since May 28.  Trading in over-the-counter foreign-exchange options
totaled $29 billion, compared with $29.9 billion yesterday,
according to data reported by U.S. banks to the Depository Trust
Clearing Corp. and tracked by Bloomberg. Volume in options on
the dollar-yen exchange rate amounted to $9.4 billion, the
largest share of trades at 33 percent. Euro-dollar options were
the second most actively traded, at $2.7 billion, or 9 percent.  Dollar-yen options trading was 1 percent less than the
average for the past five Thursdays at a similar time in the
day, according to Bloomberg analysis. Euro-dollar options
trading was 23 percent less than average.  Volatility in currencies surged since the Fed signaled last
week it may start reducing stimulus this year. JPMorgan Chase &
Co.’s  Group of Seven Volatility Index , based on currency-option
premiums, reached 11.02 percent after rising to 11.96 percent on
June 24, the highest since January 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
