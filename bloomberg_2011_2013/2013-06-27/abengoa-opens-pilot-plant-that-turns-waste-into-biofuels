Abengoa SA (ABG) , Spainâ€™s largest biofuels
producer, inaugurated a demonstration plant that can make
bioethanol from municipal solid waste, its first using the
technology.  The facility in Babilafuente, central Spain, can treat
25,000 tons of municipal solid waste to generate as much as 1.5
million liters (396,000 gallons) of bioethanol, which can be
used as an alternative fuel, Seville-based Abengoa said.  The plant is the largest globally than can produce biofuels
from waste, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Its
technology involving enzymes can prevent more than 80 percent of
the waste from going into landfills while also being a source of
clean energy, Abengoa said in a statement.  The developer of solar and water desalination projects is
also building a second-generation biofuel plant in  Kansas  that
uses corn stalks and leaves as feedstock. Second-generation
biofuels are made from plant waste or organic material rather
than food crops.  Abengoa also has plans for a $110 million waste-to-energy
facility in  Arizona  that will generate electricity from
municipal waste.  To contact the reporter on this story:
