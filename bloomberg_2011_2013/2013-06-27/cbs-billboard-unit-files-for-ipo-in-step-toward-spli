CBS Outdoor Americas Inc. filed for
an initial public offering as part of parent company  CBS Corp. (CBS) ’s
plan to split off the billboard division.  The offering size, $100 million, is a placeholder amount
that may change. A portion of the proceeds will be used to repay
a CBS note, the company said yesterday in a  regulatory filing .
CBS will own about 80 percent after the offering, and distribute
the stock to its investors.  CBS said in January that it planned to convert the outdoor
advertising business into a real-estate investment trust, or
REIT. The structure has become a popular tool for companies to
lower taxes and improve returns for investors. REITs don’t pay
federal income taxes, with the understanding that they
distribute at least 90 percent of taxable earnings to
shareholders as dividends.  The IRS is weighing whether to narrow the legal definition
of real estate for the purposes of converting to a trust.  CBS, owner of the most-watched U.S. TV network,  rose  1
percent to $49.28 at 11:55 a.m. in  New York . As of yesterday,
the stock had gained 28 percent this year, compared with the 13
percent increase for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
