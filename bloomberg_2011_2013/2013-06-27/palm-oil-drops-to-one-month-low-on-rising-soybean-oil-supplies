Palm oil  dropped for a second day to
the lowest in more than a month on speculation that demand for
the commodity may weaken amid rising supplies of  soybean oil .  The contract for September delivery lost 1 percent to 2,355
ringgit ($742) a metric ton on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives,
the lowest price at close for the most-active futures since May
21. Palm for local  physical delivery  in July was at 2,375
ringgit, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Global production of vegetable oils and fats will probably
exceed demand in 2013-2014 on rising output of sunflower-seed
oil and soybean oil combined with sluggish biodiesel demand,
industry researcher Oil World said June 25. Total production of
17 oils and fats in the year through September 2014 is predicted
to climb to 193.8 million tons from 187.3 million tons in
2012-2013, it said.  “South American soybean production has been pretty good
and it seems like they have a pretty good crush margin,” said
Donny Khor, deputy director of futures and commodities at RHB
Investment Bank Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur . “When more soybean oil
comes out of  South America , it will compete with palm. The palm
oil discount to soybean oil has narrowed quite a lot.”  Soybean oil’s  premium  to palm fell to $257.0355 a ton on
June 25, the lowest since August, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Soybean oil for December delivery gained 0.4 percent
to 45.64 cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade, after
declining 1.1 percent yesterday to close at the lowest level for
the most active futures since October 2010. Soybeans for
delivery in November climbed 0.3 percent to $12.795 a bushel.  Refined palm oil for January delivery declined 0.9 percent
to 5,828  yuan  ($948) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange , the
lowest price at close since September 2009, while soybean oil
lost 0.4 percent to end at 7,302 yuan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
