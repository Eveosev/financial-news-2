The risks to  India ’s banking sector
increased in the three months ended March due to a cash crunch
and a decline in the asset quality, the central bank said.  “Tight liquidity, deteriorating asset quality and reducing
soundness are the major contributors to the decline in stability
of the banking system,” the  Reserve Bank of India  said in its
Financial Stability Report published on it’s website today.
“Macro tests indicate that if the current macro economic
conditions persist the credit quality of commercial banks could
deteriorate further.”  The slowest  economic expansion  in a decade and the highest
borrowing costs among major Asian economies pushed bad loans at
the Indian lenders to 3.6 percent of the total at the end of
September before easing to 3.4 percent in March, data from the
central bank showed. Soured debt may rise to 4.4 percent by
March 2014 under a severe stress scenario, the  Reserve Bank  said
in the report.  The current capital adequacy ratio of lenders will be
enough to cover any rise in the bad loans, the central bank
said. Banks will need capital infusion of 5 trillion rupees ($83
billion) to comply with the Basel III rules that will be fully
implemented in India by March 31, 2018, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
