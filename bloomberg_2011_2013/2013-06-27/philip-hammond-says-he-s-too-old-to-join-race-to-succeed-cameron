U.K. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond ruled himself out of the race to succeed Prime Minister
David Cameron as leader of the Conservative Party.  Asked if he was flattered to be considered as a contender
to lead the party, Hammond, who will be 60 at the time of the
2015 election, said he’s too old for the job and is focusing on
overhauling the Ministry of Defence.  “They probably haven’t checked my birth certificate. I’m
getting a bit long in the tooth for that kind of thing,”
Hammond said in an interview published by The House magazine,
which is distributed to lawmakers. “Through to the election
will have given me 3 1/2 years in this role and I would expect
by then to have some irreversible change baked into the way the
MoD works. That’s what I’m focused on.”  Hammond is quoted at odds of 10-1 by bookmaker  Ladbrokes
Plc  to be the next Tory leader, meaning a bet of 1 pound would
win 10 pounds plus the stake. That makes him joint third
favorite behind Home Secretary Theresa May at 4-1 and London
Mayor Boris Johnson at 5-1. Education Secretary Michael Gove and
Foreign Secretary William Hague are also 10-1 shots.  To contact the reporter on this story:
