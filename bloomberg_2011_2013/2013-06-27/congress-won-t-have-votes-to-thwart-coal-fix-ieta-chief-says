Dirk Forrister, president of the
International Emissions Trading Association and former climate
adviser to President Bill Clinton, comments on President  Barack
Obama ’s plan to limit emissions from existing fossil-fuel power
plants. He spoke today by phone from Geneva.  On the plan to regulate U.S. emissions using the Environmental
Protection Agency:  “It was a pretty bold step. I fully expect Congress to try
to invalidate the regulation” of emissions by the EPA.  “I don’t think Congress has the votes to stop the
administration.”  On how some states may use carbon markets to cut costs of
meeting emission limits:  “The states have some discretion to adapt the
implementation of the plan to their own circumstances. It does
create an opening for states interested in market-based
measures. If they can get past partisan bickering, market-based
solutions may be better.”  Adopting and enforcing emission standard rules for power
stations will probably be more “burdensome of regulators” than
carbon markets would be, he said.  On a European Parliament compromise plan to limit supply in the
region’s carbon market, which includes an element to set aside
funds from allowance sales:  EU nations “guard jealously” their role collecting
revenue and taxes, Forrister said. The measure will probably
receive “pushback from member states.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
