U.S. elementary and middle school
students have sharpened their reading and math skills since the
1970s, while 17-year-olds stagnated, federal tests show.  Almost half of 9-year-olds knew basic arithmetic last year,
up from 20 percent in 1978, according to a U.S. Education
Department report. Yet, only 7 percent of 17-year-olds solved
routine problems involving fractions, percents, algebra,
exponents and square roots, the same level as 34 years earlier.  The results of the test, called the  Nation’s Report Card ,
follow decades of government efforts to improve achievement in
education led by presidents from  Ronald Reagan  to  Barack Obama .
Congress is also debating how to rewrite No Child Left Behind,
President  George W. Bush ’s 2002 law focusing on testing to hold
schools accountable for their results.  “The great value of this report is in allowing us to see
both the progress and the problems,” said Brent Houston,
principal at Shawnee Middle School in  Oklahoma  and a member of
the board overseeing the test.  The 2012 results of the National Assessment of Educational
Progress, as the test is formally known, measured the
performance of a nationally representative sample of more than
50,000 fourth-, eighth- and 12th-graders in public and private
schools against their predecessors in the 1970s, when the tests
were first given.  Middle Schoolers  Thirteen-year-olds were the only age group to show a
significant gain since 2008, the last time the government
compared performance to the 1970s. On a zero to 500-point scale,
their average math scores rose to 285 in 2012 from 281 in 2008
and 266 in 1973. Reading rose to 263 last year from 260 in 2008
and 255 in 1971.  Fifteen percent of 13-year-olds could understand and
summarize complicated literary and informational passages, up
from 13 percent in 2008 and 10 percent in 1971. Only 6 percent
of 17-year-olds could show that they could synthesize and learn
from specialized reading materials -- about the same as in the
1970s.  Catholic school students performed better than those in
public classrooms. Private school participation wasn’t high
enough to break out results.  Black and Hispanic students made larger gains than white
students since the 1970s. While they still lagged whites, that
“achievement gap” narrowed, according to the study.  In math, black and Hispanic 9-year-olds are performing
about as well as their 13-year-old counterparts did in the early
1970s, according to Kati Haycock, president of the Education
Trust, a Washington-based nonprofit advocacy and research group.  The lagging achievement of disadvantaged minorities had
been a major focus of federal policy, including No Child Left
Behind.  “There are considerable bright spots, including remarkable
improvement among black and Hispanic students and great strides
for girls in mathematics,” David P. Driscoll, the former
Massachusetts education commissioner who chairs the group
overseeing the federal test, said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
