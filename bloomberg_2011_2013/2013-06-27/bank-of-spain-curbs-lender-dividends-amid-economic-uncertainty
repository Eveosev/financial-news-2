Spain ’s central bank capped lenders’
dividends for 2013 to safeguard their solvency after the
industry was bailed out by the European Union last year amid the
worst economic slump in the nation’s democratic history.  Madrid-based Bank of Spain said it wrote to banking
associations yesterday to recommend “cautious” dividend
policies that ensure “adequate levels of capital.”  “This requirement is especially necessary in the current
environment, in which uncertainty persists on the economic
situation, in Spain, the  euro zone  as well as in other countries
where Spanish banks operate,” the bank said in an  e-mailed
statement .  The central bank is monitoring the impact on banks’ books
of rising bad loans after the euro region’s fourth-largest
economy contracted for seven straight  quarters . Governor Luis Maria Linde, who said last week that the banking crisis isn’t
over, has given lenders until July 31 to report on the impact of
a Supreme Court ruling that may affect billions of euros of
mortgages.  The Bank of Spain is pressuring lenders as the
 International Monetary Fund  has called for close supervision
because it expects lenders’ loan books to keep deteriorating.
The central bank yesterday said banks should moderate dividends
in 2013 depending on their individual situation and capped cash
dividends at 25 percent of net income.  Concerning recurring scrip dividends, it said banks total
dividend per share must be “reasonably” adjusted to profit and
the number of outstanding shares.  To contact the reporters on this story:
