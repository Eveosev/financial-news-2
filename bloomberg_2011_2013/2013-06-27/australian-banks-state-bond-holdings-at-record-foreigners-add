Australia ’s banks boosted holdings
of the nation’s state  government bonds  to a record last quarter
as lenders prepare to meet new regulations aimed at making them
more resilient.  Banks held A$78.2 billion ($72.9 billion) of securities
issued by regional borrowing authorities, or 37 percent of the
outstanding debt, in the first three months of the year,
according to  data  from the statistics bureau. That’s up from
A$76.2 billion at the end of 2012. The share of foreigners’
holdings rose to A$68.3 billion, or 32 percent of the total,
advancing for the first time in three quarters.  Securities sold by the federal and state governments are
the only assets in Australia that count as liquid ones under
Basel Committee on Banking Supervision rules, the  Australian
Prudential Regulation Authority  has said. The regulations would
force banks to hold enough easy-to-sell assets to survive a 30-day squeeze.  States increased their outstanding debt to an all-time high
of A$212.8 billion from A$207.5 billion in the final quarter of
last year, according to the bureau of statistics.  Semi-government debt returned 0.1 percent to investors this
year after rising 8.5 percent through 2012, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch data. The securities offer 60 basis points
of extra yield compared with Australian government bonds, the
data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
