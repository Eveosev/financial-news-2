International Lease Finance Corp. (ILFC) ,
the plane-leasing unit of  American International Group Inc. (AIG) ,
said it remains intent on completing its delayed sale to a
Chinese group for about $4.2 billion.  “We are doing everything we can to reach a speedy
conclusion,” ILFC Chief Executive Officer Henri Courpron said
today in an interview. “But complicated deals take time.”  Courpron stocked up on smaller jets earlier this month at
the  Paris Air Show  and today was in Seattle, where ILFC was
taking  delivery of a wide-body Boeing Co. 787 Dreamliner to be
leased to Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA. Los Angeles-based ILFC is
the largest customer for the Dreamliner, with orders for 74 of
the composite-plastic planes.  While talks are under way with planemakers about the Airbus
A350-1000, Boeing’s 777X wide-body and the newest Dreamliner
variant, “it doesn’t mean we’re about to announce a deal,”
Courpron said. “For us to announce an order for airplanes that
are scheduled for delivery in more than five years is not really
a priority.”  AIG said last week that it was open to new offers for ILFC
after a group of investors, led by New China Trust Co. Chairman
Weng Xianding, missed a second deadline to complete a deal. The
New York-based insurer revived plans June 21 for an initial
public offering of ILFC.  ILFC is buying 300 planes over the next five years,
including 50 narrow-body Airbus A320neos ordered at the Paris
event.  To contact the reporter on this story:
