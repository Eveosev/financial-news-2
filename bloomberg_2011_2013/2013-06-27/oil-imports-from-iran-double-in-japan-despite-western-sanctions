Japan ’s crude imports from  Iran  more
than doubled in May from a year earlier despite sanctions
against the Persian Gulf country.  Crude imports rose to 1.09 million kiloliters, or about
222,000 barrels a day, up from about 523,000 kiloliters in May
2012, according to data today from the Ministry of Finance.
Purchases from Iran in April of this year were about 530,000
kiloliters.  The U.S. extended Japan’s exemption in March from sanctions
on banks doing business with Iran for a third six-month term
based on additional reductions in the volume of oil purchases
from the country. Japan imported 4.77 million kiloliters of
Iranian crude in the five months ended May, down about 17
percent from a year earlier, the finance ministry’s data shows.  Japanese companies will unlikely increase oil imports from
Iran on a quarterly or annual basis because of possible
sanctions, said Osamu Fujisawa, an independent energy economist
in  Tokyo  who worked for Saudi Arabian Oil Co. and Showa Shell
Sekiyu K.K. It’s not difficult for buyers to replace Iranian
supply with oil from other sources, Fujisawa said.  The finance ministry’s data is based on a tally of
shipments that cleared Japanese customs. Japan’s trade ministry
is scheduled to release separate statistics tomorrow based on
data collected from buyers via questionnaire.  To contact the reporter on this story:
