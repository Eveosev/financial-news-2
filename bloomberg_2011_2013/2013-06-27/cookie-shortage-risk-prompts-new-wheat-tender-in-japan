Japan ,  Asia ’s second-largest wheat
importer, is looking from  Canada  to Australia to replace the
U.S. western-white variety favored in cakes and cookies after
the discovery of an unapproved gene-altered strain in  Oregon .  The country plans to buy 2,000 metric tons in a special
tender on July 5 that’s separate from its regular weekly
purchases, said Hiromi Iwahama, a director of grain trading at
the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. It last
purchased 152,321 tons of other varieties, used in bread and
noodles, in a tender on June 20.  Japanese millers have stockpiles equivalent to 2.3 months
of consumption and could face shortages if replacements aren’t
found after the suspension of western white shipments on May 30,
Iwahama said. Sellers will tender Canadian western-red winter
wheat,  Australia ’s premium white variety, soft-red winter grain
from the U.S. and club wheat of Washington state.  “We have to hedge the risk that Japanese flour millers
will face a supply shortage because of the prolonged suspension
of imports,” Iwahama said today in a telephone interview.  The government can’t resume imports from Oregon before the
health ministry establishes a testing method to detect modified
strains, Iwahama said. Japan’s food-safety law bans sales of
food containing GM crops that haven’t been confirmed safe by the
health ministry. Contaminated supplies must be shipped back to
exporting countries or disposed of.  The ministry controls overseas purchases and domestic sales
to stabilize supply in Japan, which depends on imports for
almost 90 percent of its wheat. The U.S. is the world’s biggest
exporter.  Demand Test  The ministry may hold a second tender for alternative grain
next month if demand from flour millers increases, he said.  Wheat for September delivery on the Chicago Board of Trade
added 0.2 percent to $6.7850 a bushel at 3:46 p.m. Tokyo Time.
Futures are set for the third straight quarter of losses.  The  Consumers Union  of Japan on June 4 asked the government
to ban imports of U.S. wheat after the discovery of the strain
developed by  Monsanto Co. (MON)   Japan requires labeling of products containing gene-altered
material. Food makers including Yamazaki Baking Co. don’t use GM
ingredients because some consumers are concerned it may not be
safe.  GM crops contain a gene from another organism to give them
resistance to herbicide or the ability to produce their own
toxin to kill pests. Promoters say the technology contributes to
increase yields and lower output costs, while critics fear the
environmental and health consequences.  Scientists said the rogue wheat was a strain tested from
1998 to 2005 by Monsanto, the world’s largest seed maker, which
withdrew its application for approval amid concern buyers would
avoid crops from the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
