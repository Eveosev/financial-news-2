Natural gas futures tumbled to the
lowest price in 16 weeks in New York after U.S. stockpiles
increased more than forecast.  Gas fell 4.1 percent, the biggest one-day drop in three
weeks, as the Energy Information Administration said inventories
rose 95 billion cubic feet in the week ended June 21 to 2.533
trillion cubic feet. Analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg
showed a 90-billion increase. Supply gains have topped five-year
averages for four straight weeks as mild weather reduced demand.  “Today’s inventory report is a reflection of the fact that
we have very sluggish demand picture right now,” said Dominick Chirichella, senior partner at the Energy Management Institute
in New York. “I don’t see a significant call on natural gas for
power generation to meet cooling needs because cooling needs
aren’t going to be all that high.”  Natural gas for August delivery dropped 15.5 cents to
$3.582 per million British thermal units on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, the lowest settlement price for a front-month contract since March 7. Trading was 21 percent above the
100-day average at 2:57 p.m. Prices have fallen 11 percent since
March, heading for the first drop in five quarters. The futures
are up 6.9 percent this year.  The discount of August to October futures was steady at 1.1
cents.  August $3.50 puts were the most active options in
electronic trading. They rose 4.5 cents to 9.1 cents per million
Btu on volume of 2,455 at 3:23 p.m. Puts accounted for 74
percent of trading volume. Implied volatility for at-the-money
options expiring in August was 31.61 percent at 3:15 p.m.,
compared with 31 percent yesterday.  Average Gains  The stockpile increase was bigger than the five-year
average gain for the week of 79 billion cubic feet, according to
the EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical arm. Supplies
expanded by 58 billion a year earlier.  A  deficit  to the five-year average narrowed 1.2 percent
from 1.9 percent the previous week. Inventories were 17.1
percent below  year-earlier levels  compared with 18.7 percent in
last week’s report.  Gas prices have slumped 19 percent from a 21-month high of
$4.444 per million Btu on May 1 as unseasonable heat was
replaced by milder weather, limiting demand for the power-plant
fuel to run air conditioners.  Above-normal temperatures along the Atlantic and Pacific
coasts next week will bracket cooler weather in the middle of
the country, according to MDA Weather Services. The
Gaithersburg, Maryland-based forecaster predicted below-normal
readings for  Texas  and neighboring states.  July Weather  The high in  Boston  on July 2 may be 85 degrees Fahrenheit
(31 Celsius), 5 above normal, while St Louis may see 84 degrees,
4 below average, according to AccuWeather Inc. in State College
Pennsylvania.  Dallas ’s high on July 5 will be 11 below normal at
84 degrees after surging to 104 tomorrow.  Power producers account for 32 percent of gas demand,
according to the EIA. Texas consumed the most natural gas for
generating electricity, averaging 18 percent of U.S. power-plant
demand for the fuel over the past three years, according to Teri Viswanath, director of commodities strategy at BNP Paribas SA in
New York.  Marketed gas production will climb 1.2 percent to average
a record 70.01 billion cubic feet a day this year as new wells
come online at shale formations, such as the Marcellus in the
Northeast, the EIA’s monthly report showed.  Gas futures plunged below the 200-day moving average, a key
technical support level, at $3.639 per million Btu today for the
first time since August. Prices tested the average yesterday
before bouncing higher.  Summer Prices  “One of our rules is don’t go long natural gas after
Memorial Day and don’t short gas after Labor Day, no matter what
anybody says,” said Walter Zimmerman, chief technical
strategist at United-ICAP, a brokerage in Jersey City, New
Jersey.  On average, gas prices slide 35 percent from the May peak
to the late August or early September low, based on historical
data, he said.  Futures also dropped below a long-term support line that
had been intact since gas slumped to a 10-year low of $1.902 in
April 2012, Zimmerman said.  Gas may test the $3.40 support level as soon as next week
and if futures break through that, they may spiral down to the
next support area of $2.88, based on a 50 percent retracement of
gains from the 10-year low to the May high, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
