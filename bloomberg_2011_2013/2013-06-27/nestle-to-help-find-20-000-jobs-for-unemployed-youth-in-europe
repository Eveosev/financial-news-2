Nestle SA (NESN) , the world’s biggest food
company, said it will start a program to help find jobs and
traineeships for at least 20,000 young people in Europe as
unemployment worsens in the region.  Nestle will offer jobs and apprenticeships on factory
floors, sales departments and in business management to people
under 30, and urge its suppliers to do the same, the Vevey,
Switzerland-based company said today in a statement.  Unemployment in the euro region rose to a record  12.2
percent (UMRTEMU)  in April after the currency bloc’s recession worsened in
the first quarter. Joblessness among young people was 24.4
percent.  “Governments alone cannot resolve the problem of youth
unemployment in Europe,” said Laurent Freixe, head of Nestle’s
Europe unit, in the statement. “Companies must play their
part.”  Nestle, which employed about  339,000 people  at the end of
2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, said it will
unveil further details about the program in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
