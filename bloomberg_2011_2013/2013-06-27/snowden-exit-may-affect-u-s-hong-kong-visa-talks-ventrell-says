Hong Kong ’s handling of the
departure of Edward Snowden, the intelligence program leaker
facing espionage charges in the U.S., may affect its plans to
become a member of the U.S. Visa Waiver Program, State
Department Spokesman Patrick Ventrell said on June 25.  “These issues have an impact when we have a breakdown on
cooperation on such a key issue,” Ventrell said, when asked
about the repercussions on U.S.-China or U.S.-Hong Kong
relations, according to a transcript of a press briefing in
 Washington .  To contact the reporter on this story:
