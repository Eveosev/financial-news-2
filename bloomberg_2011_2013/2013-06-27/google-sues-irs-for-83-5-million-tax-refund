Google Inc. (GOOG) , owner of the most
popular Internet search engine, sued the  U.S. Internal Revenue
Service  for an $83.5 million refund, claiming it was improperly
denied a deduction for a 2004 stock transaction with America
Online Inc.  The IRS erred in disallowing a $238.6 million deduction
claimed for the difference between the price AOL paid to
exercise a warrant for Google stock and the value of the shares,
according to the complaint in U.S. Tax Court.  “Google’s actual cost for issuing the AOL warrant was
$238,667,835, which equaled the spread between the $21,642,985
it received from AOL to exercise the AOL warrant and
$260 million in value” of the stock, Google said in the
complaint.  Google disclosed its intention to file a challenge to the
IRS over a domestic tax issue, though not the substance, in a
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Jan. 29.  “We hope to have it resolved soon,” Niki Fenwick, a
spokeswoman for Google, said in a phone interview.  Google, based in  Mountain View ,  California , issued the
warrant for its “series D preferred stock” in June 2002 in
recognition of AOL efforts to promote Google’s search engine
among its users, according to the complaint.  Quality Control  AOL provided multiple services to Google “including
quality control services that maintained certain standards and
limited the amount of spam hits provided to Google,” and
“services that further enhanced Google’s targeting of sponsored
links,” Google’s lawyers wrote.  AOL exercised the warrant in May 2004, about 3 1/2 months
before Google priced its initial public offering and its common
stock began trading on the Nasdaq stock market, according to the
suit.  Dean Patterson , an IRS spokesman, didn’t immediately reply
to an e-mail seeking comment on the lawsuit.  AOL’s parent, Time Warner Inc., filed a tax court petition
on May 6 over the same transaction, challenging an IRS ruling
that it owed $4.6 million, according to Bloomberg BNA.  The IRS contends that Time Warner owed tax on the
difference between what AOL paid for the Google shares, and
their fair market value in May 2004. That difference is $234
million, according to the Time Warner complaint cited by BNA.  Time Warner is seeking to have the warrant taxed at its
value in 2002, $37.4 million, BNA reported.  The Google case is Google Inc. v. U.S.  Internal Revenue
Service , 014061-13, U.S. Tax Court ( Washington ). The AOL case is
 Time Warner Inc. (TWX)  v. U.S. Internal Revenue Service, 9927-13, U.S.
Tax Court (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
