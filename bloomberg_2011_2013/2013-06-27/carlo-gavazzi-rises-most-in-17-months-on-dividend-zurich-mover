Carlo Gavazzi Holding AG (GAV) , a Swiss
maker of electronic equipment including sensors and safety
devices, rose the most in 17 months after proposing an
extraordinary dividend.  The stock rose as much as 9.3 percent, the biggest intraday
advance since January 2012. The shares were up 6.8 percent at
229.70 Swiss francs as of 12:45 p.m. in Zurich, giving the
Steinhausen-based company a market value of 163 million francs
($172 million). More than 6,700 shares changed hands, or about
12 times the three-month daily average.  Carlo Gavazzi  proposed  an extraordinary dividend of 15
francs per bearer share and 3 francs per registered share
because of the company’s strong net cash position. That’s on top
of an ordinary dividend of 10 francs per bearer share and 2
francs per registered share.  The dividend “shows that despite the cautious outlook the
company is fundamentally optimistic about the future,” Richard Frei, an analyst at Zuercher Kantonalbank, wrote in a note to
investors. Results for the year ended March 31 were mostly in
line with expectations, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
