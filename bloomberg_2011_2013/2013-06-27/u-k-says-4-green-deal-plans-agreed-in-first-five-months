The U.K. said four “Green Deal”
plans have been agreed in the first five months of the program
the government wants to use to improve the energy efficiency of
the nation’s 26.9 million homes.  The deals were signed between the start of the program on
Jan. 28 and June 16, the Department of Energy and Climate Change
said today in a spreadsheet posted on its website. Another 245
customers have said they want to proceed with a plan, without
yet signing a contract.  Under the plan, the centerpiece of the government’s first
energy law, homeowners can pay for insulation, double glazing
and other energy efficiency measures by taking out a loan with
repayments made on their household bills. Its golden rule stated
that the repayments should be lower than the cost savings
resulting from the measures.  Secretary of State  Ed Davey  and Climate Change Minister
 Greg Barker  said on Jan. 28 that it would take time to ramp up.
Even so, Barker has said he was expecting 10,000 people to sign
up in the first year of the program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
