The cost of goods leaving South
African factories rose at a slower pace in May than the previous
month, easing pressure on the Reserve Bank to raise  interest
rates .  Producer-price inflation  for final manufactured goods
slowed to 4.9 percent from 5.4 percent in April, Statistics
South Africa said on its website today. The median estimate in a
Bloomberg  survey  was 5.2 percent. Prices rose 0.3 percent in the
month.  “The price pressure in respect of other  consumer goods 
remains reasonably tame,” Elna Moolman, Johannesburg-based
economist at Macquarie Group Ltd., said in a note to clients.
That “would arguably support the SARB’s comments in recent
speeches that the pass-through from rand weakness might be
somewhat shallower than usual,” she said.  The upside risks to inflation from a weaker rand don’t
automatically imply the benchmark rate will be increased because
of slow economic growth, Governor Gill Marcus said yesterday.
Price increases are limiting the room the  Reserve Bank  has to
cut lending rates to boost a slowing economy, she said. The
central bank kept the repurchase rate at 5 percent last month.  The rand has dropped 16 percent against the dollar this
year, the worst of the 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.
The consumer inflation rate rises as much as 2 percentage points
for every 10 percent the rand drops, Marcus said last month.  The rand gained 0.6 percent to 10.0545 per dollar at 11:55
a.m. in Johannesburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
