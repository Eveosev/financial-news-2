Gold futures tumbled below $1,200 an
ounce, extending a slump to a 34-month low, as U.S. economic
data topped estimates by analysts, eroding the metal’s appeal as
a store of value.  In May, consumer spending rebounded and pending home sales
jumped to the highest since 2006, while jobless claims fell last
week, reports showed today. Assets in the SPDR Gold Trust, the
world’s biggest exchange-traded product backed by the metal,
have slumped 28 percent this year to the lowest since February
2009 amid an equity rally and muted inflation.  “When the market gets into a trend, people just want to
follow it, and now we’re in a severe downtrend, so the
psychology has become terrible,”  Donald Selkin , who helps
manage $3 billion of assets as chief market strategist at
National Securities Corp. in  New York , said in a telephone
interview. “If any of the big holders that are still in the ETF
start getting forced to sell, it could be big a wild card.”  Gold futures for August delivery dropped 1.5 percent to
close at $1,211.60 at 1:46 p.m. on the Comex in New York. After
the settlement, the metal touched $1,196.10, the lowest since
August 2010.  This quarter, the price headed for a record slump, partly
because gains in the economy have boosted speculation that the
 Federal Reserve  will scale back U.S. monetary stimulus that
helped drive gold higher last year.  ‘Panic Selling’  The metal may fall as low as $800 “in panic selling,”
Selkin said. That would mark the cheapest since December 2008.  The Fed said on June 19 that asset purchases may be scaled
back if the economy continues to improve. Gold has tumbled 28
percent in 2013 after posting 12 straight annual gains.  Billionaire  John Paulson  is the largest holder in the SPDR,
which has plunged $35.2 billion in value this year.  Gold more than doubled from the end of 2008 to a record
$1,923.70 in September 2011 as the Fed cut  interest rates  to a
record. The metal fell into a  bear market  in April, and the
decline has “shattered” the confidence of investors betting on
an extended rally, according to Credit Suisse Group AG. Morgan
Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. trimmed price forecasts
this week.  This quarter, gold has slumped 24 percent. The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  gained 3.1 percent.  ‘Grind Down’  “Nobody wants to own gold anymore,”  Frank McGhee , the
head dealer at Integrated Brokerage Services LLC in  Chicago ,
said in a telephone interview. “We’re getting a continuous
grind down with heavy liquidation. All the news about the U.S.
is not helping, and the markets are looking forward” to better
prospects for the economy, he said.  Silver futures for September delivery dropped 0.3 percent
to close at $18.553 an ounce on the Comex. The metal has plunged
39 percent this year.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery rose 1.7 percent to $1,329.10 an ounce, the
biggest gain since June 3, amid labor unrest in  South Africa ,
the world’s biggest producer.  “Supply-side  concerns in South Africa remain,”  Michael Smith , the president of T&K Futures & Options in Port  St.
Lucie, Florida, said in a telephone interview. “Strong economic
data out of the U.S. is providing support to precious metals
that have industrial use.”  Palladium futures for September delivery gained 2.8 percent
to $650.70 an ounce on the Nymex, the biggest gain since May 28.  To contact the reporters on this story:
