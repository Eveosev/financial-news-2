Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) , the largest U.S.
electric utility holding company, participated in a $42 million
funding round to help Clean Power Finance develop its online
financing service for residential solar systems.  Duke joined existing investor Edison International and two
other utility holding companies in the round, San Francisco-based Clean Power said today in a statement.  The company operates an online system that matches
potential investors with solar developers seeking funding for
projects, Chief Executive Officer Nat Kreamer said in an
interview. Utilities have invested in the business because it
offers them access to the rooftop solar industry. Itâ€™s overseen
about $500 million in project financing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
