Whitecap Resources Inc. (WCP) , a Canadian
oil and natural gas producer, said it agreed to buy energy
assets in  Alberta  from  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX)  for C$173.6 million
($166 million).  Whitecap agreed to buy light-oil assets producing 2,900
barrels of oil equivalent a day from Barrick, Grant Fagerheim,
chief executive officer of Calgary-based Whitecap, said in a
phone interview today. Andy Lloyd, a spokesman for Toronto-based
Barrick, declined to comment.  Barrick, the worldâ€™s biggest gold producer, said in January
it had started a sales process for its oil and gas unit. CEO
Jamie Sokalsky, who took the job a year ago, is reviewing growth
plans and seeking to offload assets as gold trades near a three-year low and heads for its first annual drop since 2000.  Barrick rose 1.9 percent to C$15.79 at 10:35 a.m. in
Toronto. Whitecap gained 0.7 percent to C$10.30.  To contact the reporters on this story:
