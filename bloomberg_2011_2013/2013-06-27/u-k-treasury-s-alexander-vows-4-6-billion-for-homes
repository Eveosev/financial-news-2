U.K. Treasury Chief Secretary  Danny Alexander  pledged 3 billion pounds ($4.6 billion) to build
cheaper housing from 2015 through 2018 as Britain seeks to make
homes easier to buy for residents.  The funding will deliver 165,000 new homes, the most on an
annual average basis in 20 years, he told lawmakers in
Parliament today.  “This country does not have enough homes that people can
afford,” Alexander said. “A good home should not be a luxury
for the few, but an achievable aspiration for the many.”  Foreigners bought half of  London ’s new homes last year,
according to broker Jones Lang LaSalle Inc., boosting prices and
making it more difficult for residents to afford one. Domestic
buyers have also struggled to get mortgages as U.K. banks
rebuild their balance sheets.  Mortgage availability has shown signs of improvement. Gross
lending for home purchases rose 17 percent to 14.7 billion
pounds from a year earlier, the Council for Mortgage Lenders
said in a June 20 statement. It was the highest monthly figure
since October 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
