The koruna weakened for a third day
to its lowest level in more than a month after the Czech central
bank said the probability of an intervention by selling the
currency has increased.  The exchange rate depreciated 0.6 percent, the most among
major emerging-market peers monitored by Bloomberg, to 26.073
per euro by 4:09 p.m. in  Prague , the lowest level since May 23.
Hungary’s forint gained 0.2 percent and the Polish zloty
strengthened 0.5 percent.  Inflation and gross domestic product staying below the
Czech National Bank’s forecasts are lifting the likelihood of a
currency intervention, Governor Miroslav Singer told journalists
today. The bank kept its main interest rate unchanged for a
fifth time at 0.05 percent in a policy meeting today.  “The central bank keeps pushing its ultra-relaxed monetary
policy into a more defensive position,” Helena Horska, the head
of research at  Raiffeisen Bank International AG (RBI) ’s Prague-based
unit, wrote in a report to clients today. “The governor’s words
didn’t sound very optimistic.”  The koruna is 5.8 percent weaker than on Sept. 17, the day
before the CNB signaled readiness to sell the koruna for the
first time in more than a decade to meet its 2 percent inflation
target.  The Czech economy shrank for six straight quarters through
March, its longest contraction on record. Consumer prices grew
1.3 percent from a year earlier in May, the slowest pace in
almost three years and below the bank’s 1.6 percent estimate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
