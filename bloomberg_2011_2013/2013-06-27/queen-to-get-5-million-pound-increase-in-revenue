Queen Elizabeth II  will get a 5.1-million-pound ($7.8 million) increase in the money she can spend
this year after she was awarded 36.1 million pounds from the
U.K. government to run her households.  The allowance for the fiscal year that started in April is
up from 31 million pounds in 2012-13, figures released to
Parliament in London today show.  Starting this year, the so-called Sovereign Grant is
calculated based on 15 percent of the surplus from profit from
the property portfolio owned by the  Crown Estate  for the two
previous financial years. The monarch does not own the estate,
currently valued at 8.1 billion pounds, since George III
surrendered its revenues in 1760 in return for an annual grant.  The increase in funding will be used to tackle a backlog in
property maintenance at some of the royal palaces, a spokesman
for the monarch said by telephone, speaking on the usual
condition of anonymity. The figures given to Parliament show
spending on property maintenance rose to 9.1 million pounds in
2012-13 from 8.9 million pounds the previous year.  In the year to March 31, the queen undertook 288 public
engagements, including celebrations of the Diamond Jubilee,
which marked her 60 years on the throne, and the  London 
Olympics, todayâ€™s figures show. Her husband, Prince Philip, the
Duke of Edinburgh, who has recently suffered ill health, managed
275 engagements in the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
