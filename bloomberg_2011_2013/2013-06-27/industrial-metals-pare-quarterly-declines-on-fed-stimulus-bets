Industrial metals pared quarterly
losses after slower-than-estimated growth in the  U.S. economy 
stoked speculation the  Federal Reserve  may hold back from
reducing monetary stimulus.  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange rose as much as 0.8 percent to $6,788 a metric ton and
was at $6,785 by 11:37 a.m. in  Tokyo . The price is still down
7.2 percent this month, the most since May 2012, and 10 percent
lower this quarter. Metal for delivery in July on the Comex
advanced 1 percent at $3.07 a pound.  U.S. gross domestic product expanded at a revised 1.8
percent annualized rate from January through March, down from a
prior estimate of 2.4 percent, figures from the Commerce
Department showed yesterday. The People’s Bank of China has
provided liquidity to some financial institutions to stabilize
money-market rates, according to a June 25 release.  China  and
the U.S. are the top consumers of industrial metals.  “Sentiment was improving as the risk of the Fed’s tapering
and concern over a cash crunch in China eased,” said Hwang Il Doo, a senior trader at Korea Exchange Bank Futures Co. in Seoul.
“We may see this rebound to continue through next week as the
new quarter starts.”  The LME Index of six primary metals that includes copper
and aluminum has declined 10 percent this quarter, the most
since the period ended Sept. 30, 2011. The index touched 2,911
on June 24, the lowest level since June 2010, as the Fed said it
may pare bond purchases and investors speculated rising Chinese
funding costs will curb demand.  Copper for delivery in October on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange advanced 1.6 percent to 48,840  yuan  ($7,943) a ton.  On the LME, aluminum, zinc, lead, nickel and tin climbed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
