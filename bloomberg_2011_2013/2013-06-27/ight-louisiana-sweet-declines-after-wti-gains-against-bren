Light Louisiana Sweet, the benchmark
light, sweet crude on the Gulf Coast, weakened to a two-year low
against domestic standard West Texas Intermediate as WTI gained
on Brent.  Brent’s premium to WTI narrowed by 39 cents to $5.77 a
barrel, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, the least based
on settlement prices since Jan. 18, 2011.  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  kept

system that was constrained by flood-related damage.  LLS, which competes with foreign oils priced against Brent,
fell 15 cents a barrel against WTI to a $7.45 a barrel premium
at 2:24 p.m. New York time. A closing at that level would be
also be the lowest since Jan. 18, 2011.  Thunder Horse weakened by 20 cents to $4.90 a barrel more
than WTI. Poseidon, a medium sour grade, weakened by 15 cents to
a $1 premium to WTI.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium  was
unchanged at $7.50 a barrel more than WTI.  Mars Blend’s premium  grew by 10 cents to $1.70 a barrel
more than WTI. Crude from the Southern Green Canyon fell 15
cents to a premium of 75 cents to WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
