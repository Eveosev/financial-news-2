TwentyTwo Real Estate, founded by
former Perella Weinberg Partners LP partner Daniel Rigny,
acquired about 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) of French
residential real estate from companies managed by LBO  France  and
Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management.  The acquisition of Financiere SELEC, comprising about 7,600
mostly single-family residential units leased to  Electricite de
France SA (EDF) , was financed with equity provided equally by Massena
Partners and Farallon Capital Management LLC, TwentyTwo said in
a statement today.  “When I started looking at the deal a year ago, there were
tremendous issues in  Europe  -- nobody knew whether  Greece  was
going to stay in or out and nobody knew what would happen to
 Spain ,” Rigny, who started TwentyTwo last year, said by
telephone. It was a good time for the transaction because the
macro-economic environment was unpredictable, he said.  The deal was done through an investment vehicle organized
and managed by TwentyTwo called Powerhouse France and is the
firm’s first acquisition. France is an attractive place to
invest and TwentyTwo is seeking to buy more property there,
Rigny said in the statement.  The Financiere SELEC portfolio was refinanced in March with
a 620 million-euro, five-year mortgage-debt facility arranged by
Natixis, according to the statement.  Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management’s real estate investment
business, formerly known as RREEF Real Estate, is an affiliate
of Deutsche Bank AG.  To contact the reporter on this story:
