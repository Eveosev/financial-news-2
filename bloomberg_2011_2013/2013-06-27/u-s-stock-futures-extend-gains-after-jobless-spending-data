U.S. stock futures extended gains
after reports showed consumer spending rebounded in May and
fewer Americans filed claims for unemployment last week.  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures expiring in September
advanced 0.6 percent to 1,605.70 at 8:33 a.m. in New York.  Household purchases, which account for about 70 percent of
the economy, rose 0.3 percent after a 0.3 percent decline the
prior month that was the biggest since September 2009, Commerce
Department figures showed today in  Washington . Incomes advanced
0.5 percent, more than projected.  Jobless claims decreased by 9,000 to 346,000 in the week
ended June 22 from a revised 355,000 the prior period, the Labor
Department reported today in Washington. The Bloomberg survey
median called for 345,000 claims.  The S&P 500 has rallied 1.9 percent over the past two days,
after dropping more than 5 percent since May 21 as the Federal
Reserve said it may reduce its bond purchases if the economy and
labor market improve as forecast. The benchmark gauge is headed
for a 1.7 percent retreat in June, which would end a streak of
seven monthly advances, the longest run since September 2009.  Central bank stimulus has helped fuel a rally in stocks
worldwide, with the benchmark U.S. index surging as much as 147
percent from its March 2009 low. Despite this month’s decline,
the S&P 500 is up 2.2 percent for the quarter and has rallied 12
percent for 2013.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
