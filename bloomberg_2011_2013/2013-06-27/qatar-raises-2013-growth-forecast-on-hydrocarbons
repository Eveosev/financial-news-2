Qatar raised its 2013 economic
growth forecast to 5.3 percent from 4.8 percent projected in
December on larger-than-expected production of oil and gas, the
country’s planning agency said.  “Output of pipeline gas is expected to be higher in 2013
than projected in December and oil production is expected to
fall more slowly,” the General Secretariat for Development
Planning said in an e-mailed report.  The agency also raised its projection for the country’s
fiscal surplus to 8.1 percent of gross domestic product from 5.4
percent, according to the report.  Qatar’s growth, 6.2 percent last year, is slowing as gas
exports level off and oil production declines, the agency said.
The world’s biggest producer of liquefied natural gas started
its 14th and final liquefaction plant in 2011 with no more
planned. Oil production will decline as the country’s oil fields
age, the agency said. Hydrocarbons accounted for 49 percent of
the economy last year, according to the report.  The country will spend $158.9 billion on infrastructure
between 2013 and 2018, the agency said.  The growth in projects will draw workers into the country,
raising the population to 2 million people this year and 2.2
million or more next year, according to the report. Per-capita
GDP will decline as population growth outpaces economic growth,
the agency said.  Inflation will accelerate to 3.6 percent this year from 1.9
percent last year on rising rental costs, the agency said. It
will remain at that level in 2014.  The agency based its projections on an oil price of $108.50
a barrel in 2013 and $103.20 next year, according to the report.
Liquefied natural gas prices in  Japan , the world’s biggest
importer of the fuel, will average $15.50 per million British
thermal units this year and $15.20 per million British thermal
units next year, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
