"Innovation" has become a buzzword in the customer experience field.  In a  recent Forrester survey  of 100 customer experience professionals, nearly half of respondents said that their executive team's strategy for customer experience is market differentiation. And an ambitious 13% said that they'll settle for nothing less than having the best customer experience across every industry — in other words, these companies want to be the next Apple, Disney, or Zappos.  They also believe that innovation will help them achieve these lofty goals — and they're investing accordingly. Sixty-nine percent of these respondents report that their companies have dedicated personnel for customer experience innovation. Sixty-four percent have allocated time to innovation activities. And 55% have dedicated innovation budgets. Are their investments paying off? A whopping 73% of interviewees say they plan to launch innovative customer experiences in the upcoming year — and two-thirds believe that they already have. 
These numbers sound promising — but they just don't add up.  If this much innovation work is really happening, then why don't we see customer experiences that are  actually  innovative gushing forth from nearly every organization? Why haven't we seen more and more companies earning excellent scores in  Forrester's Customer Experience Index ? In 2013, only 8% of the companies in this annual benchmarking survey received a top grade from their customers — and that's a pathetically low number in comparison to the amount of professed innovation in the industry. Here's the problem: Everyone  talks  about customer experience innovation, but no one knows quite what it is or how to attain it. In fact, when we ask customer experience professionals how they're driving their innovation efforts, we find several misguided approaches that actually thwart differentiation and waste massive amounts of time and money in the process. Many companies simply try to keep up with the Joneses.  Fifty-eight percent of our respondents said that their firms drive customer experience innovations by watching what their direct competitors are doing. A full 72% look to copy companies in other industries. For example, Citibank wanted to copy the Apple store so badly that it actually hired the same architects responsible for the Apple store concept to design its bank of the future. Not surprisingly, it wound up with a bank that looks like an Apple store. Imitation may be the highest form of flattery — but it's not innovation. In fact, it's the very definition of parity. Other companies pray that technology can save them.  Sixty-two percent of our panelists report that technology advancements drive their firms' innovation activities. But technology for technology's sake can end in disaster. Consider the multinational auto insurance company that invested in a new mobile app and expensive back-end integration to connect customers in an emergency with a call center agent. While it looked good on paper, the plan failed to account for the fact that drivers didn't download the app in anticipation of getting into a car crash — and had more pressing things on their minds than browsing an app store once an accident occurred. Result? Another so-called innovation that failed to produce business results. In order to change approaches like these, companies must first have a clear understanding of what it is they're aiming for. Forrester defines customer experience innovation as:  The creation of new customer experiences that drive differentiation and long-term value. Customer experience innovation requires a structured approach that goes beyond traditional find-and-fix methods and helps firms identify and create experiences that really matter. To put their innovation efforts on the right track, customer experience professionals must do three things. Customer experience innovation happens at the intersection of consumer needs, business model, and brand. Companies that neglect one or more pieces of this innovation puzzle will be forever relegated to customer experience mediocrity, on par with throngs of other companies desperate to fix their experience issues and retain customers. But by following the steps above, firms can increase the likelihood that their customer experience innovation initiatives will drive differentiation and long-term value.
