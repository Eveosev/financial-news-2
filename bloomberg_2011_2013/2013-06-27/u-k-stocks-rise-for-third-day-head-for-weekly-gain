U.K. stocks  advanced for a third
day, heading for their first weekly gain in more than a month,
as a rebound in U.S.  consumer spending  and a drop in jobless
claims added to evidence the economy is strengthening.  Randgold Resources Ltd. (RRS)  and Vedanta Resources Plc followed
a gauge of London-listed mining companies higher. Greene King
Plc climbed 2.8 percent after reporting full-year pretax profit
in line with analysts’ estimates.  The FTSE 100 rose 77.92 points, or 1.3 percent, to 6,243.4
at the close of trading in London, heading for a 2.1 percent
increase this week. The gauge has still declined 5.2 percent so
far in June after the  Federal Reserve  signaled it may end bond
buying next year if the  U.S. economy  improves in line with
forecasts. The measure has lost 2.6 percent so far this quarter.
The FTSE All-Share Index added 1.3 percent today, while
Ireland’s ISEQ Index gained 1.1 percent.  “The FTSE 100 is slightly up today courtesy of commodity
stocks,” Stephane Ekolo, a strategist at Kyte Group in London,
wrote in an e-mail. “An encouraging macroeconomic picture means
we are likely to experience a bounce in the market. Again,
developments in the U.S. will undoubtedly set the tone.”  Consumer spending in the U.S. rebounded in May in line with
forecasts, a report showed today. Household purchases, which
account for about 70 percent of the economy, rose 0.3 percent
last month after a 0.3 percent decline in the previous month,
Commerce Department figures showed. Another release showed fewer
Americans filed claims for  unemployment benefits  last week.  More Americans signed contracts in May to buy previously
owned homes than at any time in more than six years, a sign of
bigger progress in the industry.  European Deal  In the European Union, finance chiefs struck an agreement
on how to handle failing banks. In seven hours of emergency
negotiations in Brussels that concluded at about 1:30 a.m.
today, ministers finalized guidelines for assigning losses to
private creditors and regulating public assistance.  Randgold Resources, a producer of gold in West Africa,
gained 1.6 percent to 4,036 pence. Vedanta, the metals and oil
producer controlled by billionaire  Anil Agarwal , advanced 0.5
percent to 1,033 pence. BHP Billiton Ltd., the world’s largest
mining company, added 1.3 percent to 1,694.5 pence. A gauge of
mining companies listed on the FTSE 350 Index rose 1.2 percent.  Greene King (GNK) , the U.K. brewer of Abbot ale, climbed 2.8
percent to 767 pence after reporting full-year pretax profit of
162 million pounds ($248 million), exceeding estimates of 161
million pounds.  ICAP Plc (IAP)  gained 1.2 percent to 357.9 pence, erasing an
earlier decline of 3 percent. The world’s largest broker of
transactions between banks has lost 2.6 percent so far in June
after rising 28 percent in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
