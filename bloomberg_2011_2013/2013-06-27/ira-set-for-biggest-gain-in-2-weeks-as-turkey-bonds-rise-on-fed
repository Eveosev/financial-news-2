The lira headed for its biggest gain
in two weeks and  Turkey ’s bond yields dropped as the central
bank sold dollars for a sixth day and on speculation the U.S.
Federal Reserve will hold back from cutting monetary stimulus.  The currency appreciated 0.8 percent, the most on a closing
basis since June 13, to 1.9232 per dollar at 3:11 p.m. in
Istanbul. Yields on two-year benchmark notes slumped 29 basis
points, or 0.29 percentage point, to 7.85 percent, declining for
the first time in three days.  The  U.S. economy  expanded at a slower pace than estimated,
according to data released yesterday, spurring speculation the
Fed may not start reducing its $85 billion of monthly bond
purchases this year. Turkey’s central bank has sold $1.45
billion since June 11, including today’s $150 million, to curb
volatility in the currency. The lira hit a record low of 1.9602
per dollar on June 24.  “Until the markets have a clearer idea on when stimulus
will be unwound, we may see extreme moves in both directions,”
 Inan Demir , the chief economist at Finansbank AS in Istanbul,
said in e-mailed comments.  U.S. gross domestic product grew at a 1.8 percent
annualized rate from January through March, down from a prior
reading of 2.4 percent. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasuries
fell for a second day to 2.491 percent.  Nineteen of 24 emerging-market currencies strengthened
against the dollar today, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The lira has depreciated 2.5 percent this month and
5.9 percent in the second quarter as Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip
Erdogan ’s government faced the biggest protests in a decade.  “Emerging-market currencies like the lira are taking a
breather with the recent decline in U.S. yields,” Demir said.  Yields on Turkish two-year notes surged 306 basis points
since they hit a record low of 4.79 percent on May 17. The anti-government protests errupted in the country at the end of last
month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
