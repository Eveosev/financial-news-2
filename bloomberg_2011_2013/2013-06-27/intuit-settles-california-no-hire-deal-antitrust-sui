Intuit Inc. (INTU) , the largest seller of
personal-finance software, settled antitrust claims by
California’s attorney general over an agreement among technology
companies not to hire each other’s employees, a spokeswoman for
the company said.  A lawsuit and proposed judgment were filed today in federal
court in San Jose, California. Diane Carlini, the Intuit
spokeswoman, said in a phone interview that the case had been
resolved and settlement terms weren’t immediately available.  Nick Pacilio, a spokesman for California Attorney General
Kamala Harris, had no immediate comment on the settlement.  In 2010 Mountain View, California-based Intuit reached a
settlement with the U.S. Justice Department over claims the
company struck a deal with  EBay Inc. (EBAY)  not to recruit each other
employees. Intuit said last year it was cooperating with the
investigation by the California attorney general.  The case is the People of the State of California v. Intuit
Inc., 13-02933, U.S. District Court, Northern District of
California ( San Jose .)  To contact the reporter on this story:
