A partner and former member of the
executive committee at Sidley Austin LLP was accused by the
 Illinois Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission  of
misappropriating $119,000 through a fund for expenses
established for a client.  Lee Smolen, who left Sidley in September and has since
become a partner at  DLA Piper  LLP, was accused of submitting
more than 800 requests for reimbursement “for cab rides that he
knew he had not taken,” according to a filing by the
commission. Smolen “fabricated false tax receipts” totaling
$69,000, according to the commission’s filing.  Smolen, who was the former global coordinator of Sidley’s
real-estate practice in  Chicago , is also accused of submitting
requests for entertainment charges including restaurant gift
cards, tickets for sporting events and meals “that had not been
incurred for legitimate firm purposes,” according to the
commission. Those expenses amounted to an additional $50,000,
according to the filing.  Carter Phillips , the chairman of Sidley’s executive
committee, declined in an e-mail to comment on the accusations.
Smolen didn’t respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  Smolen in October 2008 was named to Sidley’s executive
committee. The alleged fraud was said to occur from 2007 to 2012
and was largely from an expense fund tied to one undisclosed
client, according to the commission.  Smolen joined DLA Piper in February, according to spokesman
 Josh Epstein . DLA Piper said in a statement that its management
had been “aware of this matter during the hiring process. After
our own due diligence and a thorough review of the facts, the
firm decided to give great weight to the total body of Lee’s
work over his 25-plus years as a lawyer and to extend to him the
opportunity to continue his career at DLA Piper.”  The allegations were filed June 14 and first reported by
the  Legal Profession Blog . Smolen will receive a hearing by a
disciplinary panel, the commission said.  The commission filing is In the Matter of Lee Mark Smolen,
 Commission No. 2013PR00060 .  Law Firm Moves  Venable Adds AmEx Lawyer to Advertising and Marketing  Po Yi, who was the chief advertising counsel for  American

tenure at American Express, Yi was a partner at Loeb & Loeb LLP.     Jeffrey Knowles, chairman of Venable’s advertising,
marketing and new media practice, said in a statement that Yi’s

Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. must by law pay their own lawyers
for advice and were wrongly awarded $26 million by a bankruptcy
judge, said the U.S. Trustee who oversees bankruptcies in the
New York region on behalf of the  Justice Department .  Tracy Hope Davis, whose earlier objection to the fee
payments was overidden by Judge James Peck, is appealing his
ruling in U.S. District Court in  Manhattan . In a filing June 25,
she said the  bankruptcy code  “mandates reversing the order
awarding the fees.” The creditors argued that the fee award
isn’t inconsistent with the law.  Separately, as members of Lehman’s official creditors
committee, Elliott and other financial institutions hired
lawyers who were paid by the bankrupt estate, as the law
allowed, Davis said.  Videos  How Do You Pronounce Lawyer: Surprise, Geography Matters  You’d think this would have been long settled. But
pronunciation of the world lawyer depends on where you live. Of
people surveyed in the U.S., 73 percent say “loyer,” while 22
percent, mostly in the southeastern states, say “law-yer.”
Another 5 percent use both interchangeably. The findings come
from a larger study on dialect by Joshua Katz, a student in
statistics at  North Carolina State University .  For more, click here.  To contact the reporter on this story:
