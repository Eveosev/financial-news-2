Treasuries rose for a second day as
 Federal Reserve  officials said investors may have overreacted to
prospects for a reduction in the central bank’s bond-buying
program as a selloff pushed yields to the highest since 2011.  Ten-year note  yields  fell to the lowest in almost a week as
 New York  Fed Bank President William C. Dudley said policy makers
may prolong asset purchases and Atlanta Fed President  Dennis
Lockhart  sought to damp bets an interest-rate boost will come
sooner than forecast. The U.S. sold $29 billion of seven-year
notes, with indirect bidders, an investor class that includes
foreign banks, buying the biggest share in almost two years.  “It seems like the Fed did not intend for the market to
react the way it did about their plans for tapering,” said
 David Coard , head of fixed-income trading in New York at
Williams Capital Group LP, a brokerage for institutional
investors. “You have yields flirting with two-year highs.”  The 10-year yield slid six basis points, or 0.06 percentage
point, to 2.47 percent at 4:59 p.m. in New York, according to
Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. It reached 2.46 percent, the
lowest since June 21. The 1.75 percent security due in May 2023
climbed 17/32, or $5.31 per $1,000 face amount, to 93 22/32.  The benchmark yield dropped seven basis points yesterday,
the biggest decline since June 13. It touched 2.66 percent on
June 24, the  highest  since August 2011.  The current  seven-year  note yield sank seven basis points
to 1.89 percent. It touched 2.11 percent on June 24, the highest
level since August 2011.  Thirty-year (USGG30YR)  bond yields decreased five
basis points to 3.53 percent. They reached 3.65 percent on June
24, the highest intraday level since September 2011.  Volume Declines  Treasury trading  volume  at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , fell 9 percent to $419
billion. The 2013 average is $322 billion.  Volatility in Treasuries declined to 103.46 on June 26, the
most recent data available, as measured by Bank of America
Merrill Lynch’s  MOVE index . It climbed to 110.98 on June 24, the
highest since November 2011. It has averaged 62.25 this year.  Treasuries lost 1.8 percent this month through yesterday,
according to the Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Bond  Index. (BUSY)  The MSCI
World Index of shares declined 3 percent in the same period,
including reinvested dividends. Treasuries have fallen 2.6
percent this quarter and 2.8 percent this year, according to the
Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Treasury Index.  Bernanke Comments  Ten-year note yields rose by 40 basis points last week, the
most since the start of the  Iraq war  in 2003, as Fed Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  said June 19 the central bank may reduce bond
purchases this year and end them entirely in 2014 if economic
growth is in line with central bank projections. Policy makers
forecast growth of as much as 2.6 percent this year and 3.5
percent in 2014.  The central bank is buying $85 billion of Treasuries and
mortgage bonds every month to put downward pressure on borrowing
costs during the third round of its quantitative-easing stimulus
program. It has kept its key  interest-rate  target at zero to
0.25 percent since 2008 to support the economy.  Lockhart, using an analogy to a cigarette smoker trying to
quit, said “it seems to me the chairman said we’ll use the
patch and use it flexibly, and some in the markets reacted as if
he said ‘cold turkey.’” Lockhart spoke at a Kiwanis Club in
Marietta,  Georgia .  ‘Way Off’  Dudley said any decision to reduce the pace of asset
purchases wouldn’t represent a withdrawal of stimulus, and that
an increase in the Fed’s benchmark interest rate is “very
likely to be a long way off.” The economy may also diverge from
the Fed’s forecasts, he told reporters in New York.  “The Fed is trying to steer the market a little bit away
from thinking rates are going to go up” soon, said  Ray Remy ,
head of fixed income in New York at Daiwa Capital Markets
America Inc. “They are on hold for a long period.”  Fed Governor Jerome Powell said in  Washington  any decision
to reduce bond buying would depend on economic data, and that
there’s no set timetable.  The seven-year notes sold today drew a yield of 1.932
percent, compared with a forecast of 1.942 percent in a
Bloomberg News survey of six of the Federal Reserve’s 21 primary
dealers. The  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges demand by
comparing total bids with the amount of securities offered, was
2.61, versus an average of 2.67 for the past 10 sales.  Bidder Participation  Indirect bidders, an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 46.4 percent of the notes, the most
since August 2011, compared with an average of 37.8 percent for
the past 10 sales.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids  directly  with the Treasury, bought 15.7 percent of
the notes, the least since July 2012. The average at the past 10
auctions was 19.4 percent.  Today’s offering is the final of three note auctions this
week totaling $99 billion. The government sold $35 billion in
two-year debt on June 25 and another $35 billion in five-year
debt yesterday.  Investors have bid $2.94 for each $1 of the $1.077 trillion
of notes and bonds sold by the Treasury in the first half of
2013, compared with a record high $3.15 for all of last year.  Bonds pared gains earlier after the National Association of
Realtors’ index of pending U.S.  home sales  jumped 6.7 percent to
112.3, the highest since December 2006.  Treasuries had stayed higher after U.S. consumer spending
increased 0.3 percent in May after a 0.3 percent decline the
prior month, the Commerce Department reported.  Data yesterday showed U.S. gross domestic product expanded
at a revised 1.8 percent annualized rate in the first quarter,
down from a prior estimate of 2.4 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
