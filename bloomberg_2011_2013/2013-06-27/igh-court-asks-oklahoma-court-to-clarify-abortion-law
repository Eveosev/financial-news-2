The U.S.  Supreme Court  signaled
interest in an abortion case, asking  Oklahoma ’s top court to
clarify the reach of a state law that regulates the use of drugs
to end a pregnancy.  The Oklahoma Supreme Court struck down the measure in a
three-paragraph ruling in December. It was one of three abortion
laws the state court invalidated last year.  The challengers, led by the Oklahoma Coalition for
Reproductive Justice, say the law effectively bars all drug-induced abortions. State officials say the measure only
regulates abortions, by blocking drug protocols that don’t
follow the instructions approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration.  The Supreme Court asked the Oklahoma court to say whether
the law bars the use of the abortion drug misoprostol, even when
doctors follow an FDA-approved protocol for combining the drug
with RU-486.  The high court also asked whether the Oklahoma measure
blocks use of methotrexate, a cancer drug, to treat ectopic
pregnancies.  The justices granted review to the case although they have
the option of dismissing it after getting a response from the
Oklahoma court.  In upholding the law, the Oklahoma court pointed to the
U.S. Supreme Court’s 1992 decision,  Planned Parenthood  v. Casey.
In that case, the court said states can’t place an “undue
burden” on a woman’s right to end a pregnancy before the fetus
would be able to live outside the womb.  The case is Cline v. Oklahoma Coalition for Reproductive
Justice, 12-1094.  To contact the reporter on this story:
