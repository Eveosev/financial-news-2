Ivory Coast  is planning 645 billion
 CFA francs  ($1.3 billion) in projects to build infrastructure by
2015 to alleviate water shortages across the West African
nation, Prime Minister Daniel Kablan Duncan said.  About 30 percent of residents in the commercial capital,
Abidjan, and half of the people living outside cities donâ€™t have
access to clean water, Duncan told reporters in the city.  The government will contribute 17 billion francs of the
estimated 66 billion francs of investments needed for water
projects and upgrades that are planned for this year, Duncan
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
