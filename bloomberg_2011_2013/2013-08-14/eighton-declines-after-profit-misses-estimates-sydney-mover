Leighton Holdings Ltd. (LEI) ,  Australia ’s
largest builder, fell the most in almost two months in Sydney
trading after reporting profit that missed analyst estimates
amid a slump in mining industry demand.  Underlying net income was A$255 million, compared with the
A$264 million average of  six analyst estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg. The shares fell as much as 6.3 percent, the most
since June 20, to A$16.18 before trading at A$16.30 as of 10:43
a.m. in Sydney.  Leighton said it is cutting costs and boosting sales in its
infrastructure and property units as its contract book slumped
in the first half to the lowest since 2009. Work in hand fell
7.7 percent from the end of December to A$40.13 billion at the
end of June, the company said, its lowest level since the six
months ended December 2009.  “We’re doing everything we can to reduce our costs,”
Hamish Tyrwhitt, chief executive officer, said in a telephone
interview after the results were announced. “We’ve gone through
these cycles many times before.”  Underlying net income in the full year ending December will
between A$520 million and A$600 million, the company said,
“subject to market conditions and any unforeseen
circumstances.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
