A burst of hotter weather next week
in the eastern U.S., the Midwest and eastern Canada won’t rival
last month’s heat wave, said  Matt Rogers , president of Commodity
Weather Group LLC.  Temperatures are expected to be 3 to 5 degrees Fahrenheit
(2 to 3 Celsius) above normal through the Midwest and into New
England from Aug. 19 to Aug. 23, said Rogers, who’s based in
Bethesda,  Maryland . In much of Ontario and Quebec, readings may
be at least 8 degrees higher than the norm.  “It still does not come anywhere near rivaling the heat in
the first two-thirds of the summer as highs in the Midwest to
East hold mainly in the 80s,” he said in a note to clients
today. “Some moderate humidity levels should enhance the heat a
bit.”  High temperatures in large U.S. and Canadian cities can
increase energy demand as people seek air conditioning to cool
off. During July’s heat wave, readings in the 90s and 100s came
with high humidity.  The normal average temperature in New York for July 22 is
78 degrees and for Aug. 22 it’s 76, according to  MDA EarthSat
Weather  in Gaithersburg, Maryland. The normal Aug. 22 reading
for Boston is 72; in Chicago, 73;  St. Louis , 79; and in  Dallas 
it’s 84.  To contact the reporter on this story:
