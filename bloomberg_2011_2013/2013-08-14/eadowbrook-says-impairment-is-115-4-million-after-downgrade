Meadowbrook Insurance Group Inc.,
the insurer whose rating was cut by A.M. Best Co. this month,
took a provisional impairment of $115.4 million as of June 30
after a review tied to the downgrade.  The figure could be revised, the Southfield, Michigan-based insurer said today in a quarterly filing with regulators
that was delayed from last week so the company could conduct its
analysis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
