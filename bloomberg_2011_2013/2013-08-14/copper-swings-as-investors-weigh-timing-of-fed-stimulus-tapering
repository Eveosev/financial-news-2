Copper swung between gains and
losses as investors weighed the outlook of the U.S. Federal
Reserve’s stimulus policy against recent signs of recovery in
economies from the U.S. to  China .  Metal for delivery in three months traded little changed at
$7,272 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange at 11:28 a.m.
in  Seoul  after falling as much as 0.4 percent and rising as much
as 0.7 percent. Futures for delivery in December dropped 0.3
percent to $3.3115 a pound on the Comex in New York.  Sixty-five percent of economists in a Bloomberg survey said
Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke will probably reduce the central
bank’s $85 billion in monthly bond purchases in September.
Copper rose to a nine-week high yesterday after U.S. retail
sales climbed for a fourth straight month in July and factory
output in the euro area gained in June.  “The Fed could taper its bond purchases soon with more
positive economic data,” said Steve Chun, a trader at Hyundai
Futures Corp. in Seoul. “The $7,300 level for copper appears to
be burdensome to many investors.”  Copper stockpiles  tracked by the LME fell for a 20th
session to 589,725 tons, the lowest since April 10. Orders to
remove metal from warehouses rose 0.8 percent to 314,250 tons.  The contract for delivery in December was little changed at
52,080  yuan  ($8,510) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange. On
the LME, aluminum, zinc, tin, nickel and lead fell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
