Former New York Governor  Eliot Spitzer  widened his lead over Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer in the race for the Democratic nomination for city
comptroller, according to a Quinnipiac University poll.  Spitzer, 54, who resigned as governor in 2008 in a
prostitution scandal, led 56 percent to 37 percent, according to
the survey. He entered the race July 7 and was ahead of Stringer
48 percent to 33 percent in a Quinnipiac poll released July 15.  Today’s survey of Democrats likely to vote in a Sept. 10
primary found that Spitzer had 68 percent support from blacks,
and 54 percent backing from women.  Although Stringer, 53, has made Spitzer’s past behavior a
major point of attack in his campaign -- and 57 percent of
Democrats say it’s a legitimate issue -- only 23 percent say
that should disqualify him, according to the poll.  “Spitzer is all over the TV screens, building on his
better name recognition and leaving Stringer in the dust,” said
 Maurice Carroll , director of the Hamden, Connecticut-based
Quinnipiac University Polling Institute.  As of Aug. 13, Spitzer had spent almost $2.6 million of his
family fortune from his father’s real estate business in his
self-financed campaign. Stringer, who’s participating in the
city’s public campaign financing, had spent $850,000, with an
estimated balance in his treasury of about $4.6 million.  The comptroller acts as the city’s chief financial officer,
responsible for overseeing about $140 billion in pension assets
and auditing agency spending.  The survey based on 579 telephone interviews conducted Aug.
7 to 12 produced a 4.1 percentage-point error margin, the
polling institute said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
