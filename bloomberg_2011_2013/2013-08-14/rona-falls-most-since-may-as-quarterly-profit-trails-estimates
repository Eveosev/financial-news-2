Rona Inc. (RON) ,  Canada ’s largest home-improvement store chain, fell the most in three months after
posting second-quarter earnings that trailed analysts’
estimates, hurt by poor weather and a construction strike.  Rona  dropped  2.8 percent to C$10.94 at 10:59 a.m. in
Toronto after earlier falling as much as 4.5 percent for the
biggest intraday decline since May 14. The shares rose 5.5
percent this year through yesterday, compared with a 1.7 percent
gain in the Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index.  A decline in single-unit housing starts across the country
and a June strike in the Quebec construction industry created
“difficult market conditions” during the quarter,
Boucherville, Quebec-based Rona said in a statement today.  Adjusted earnings per share of 28 cents trailed the 33-cent
average of analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Sales were
C$1.25 billion ($1.21 billion), a drop of C$59.6 million. Same-store sales were down 1 percent, the company said.  The net loss from continuing operations was C$38.7 million
compared with a profit of C$35.6 million in the quarter a year
earlier. The company booked C$62.8 million in expenses such as
restructuring.  “The results presented today are lower than in 2012, given
the unusual items with respect to the current restructuring, the
same of assets, investments in promotions and inventory
liquidation,” said Robert Sawyer, the company’s chief executive
officer, said today in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
