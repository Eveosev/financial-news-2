The Ibovespa gained for a sixth
session, its longest winning streak in 11 months, as signs that
the global economy is recovering lifted metals, boosting
Brazilian raw-material producers.  Steelmaker  Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais SA 
contributed the most to the gauge’s advance.  BRF SA (BRFS3) ,  Brazil ’s
biggest maker of TV dinners and frozen pizzas, gained the most
in eight weeks. Oi SA plunged after the phone company reported
an unexpected second-quarter loss and said it will cut dividend
payments.  The Ibovespa climbed 0.3 percent to 50,753.35 at 11 a.m. in
 Sao Paulo . Forty-seven stocks gained on the index while 22
declined. The real was little changed at 2.3145 per dollar. The
Bloomberg Base Metals 3-Month Price Commodity Index added 0.4
percent after data showed growth in Germany and France was
stronger than economists forecast in the second quarter. Retail
sales in the U.S. climbed for a fourth month in July, according
to a separate report yesterday.  “ Europe  is recovering from a recession, the U.S. is giving
unequivocal signs that the economy is getting stronger, and that
helps to encourage investment in Brazilian equities,”  Luciano Rostagno , the chief strategist at Banco Mizuho do Brasil in Sao
Paulo, said in a phone interview.  Usiminas, as Usinas Siderurgicas is also known, rose 2.1
percent to 9.56 reais. BRF added 2.2 percent to 53.23 reais.  Oi tumbled 7 percent to 4.15 reais. The company reported a
net loss of 124.2 million reais in the April-to-June period,
which compared with an average estimate for adjusted net profit
of 186.7 million reais among six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
