Gasoline futures gained, rebounding
from an earlier decline, after a government report showed
nationwide inventories slipped last week on lower production.  Futures climbed as much as 0.9 percent after the U.S.
Energy Information Administration said  inventories  of motor
gasoline fell to the lowest level since July 5 and refinery
processing of crude and other feedstocks retreated for a  fourth
consecutive  week. The crack spread versus West  Texas 
Intermediate widened for a second day, after reaching the lowest
level since January 2012 on Aug. 12.  “Production dropped domestically this week and with
margins fairly low, it’s going to take a little bit more for
production to pick up and get that supply back,” said Carl Larry, president of Oil Outlooks & Opinions LLC in Houston.  Gasoline for September delivery rose 2.41 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $2.9666 a gallon at 12:27 p.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , after touching $2.9252 a gallon. Trading
volume was 12 percent higher than the 100-day average.  The motor fuel’s  crack spread  versus West Texas
Intermediate crude widened $1.29 to $18.05 a barrel. The spread
narrowed to $15.86 on Aug. 12. Gasoline’s  premium  over Brent
gained 88 cents to $14.65.  U.S. stockpiles of motor gasoline slipped  1.17 million 
barrels to 222.4 million barrels in the week ended Aug. 9, the
EIA reported today.  Refineries processed  15.9 million barrels a
day during the same time period, 273,000 barrels fewer than a
week earlier, the data showed.  Refinery Work  Inputs may have fallen last week after Citgo Petroleum
Corp. shut a reformer at its Lake Charles, Louisiana, refinery
and  Phillips 66 (PSX)  carried out planned work in Borger, Texas. The
sites can process a combined 586,000 barrels a day, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for September delivery rose 0.03
cent to $3.0474 a gallon on trading volume that was 38 percent
below the 100-day average.  ULSD’s  crack spread  versus West Texas Intermediate crude
climbed 19 cents to $21.34 a barrel, heading for a third
consecutive gain. The  premium over Brent  slipped 16 cents to $18
a barrel.  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, fell 0.3 cent to $3.539 a
gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said today on its website.
Prices have fallen every day this month and are the lowest since
July 10. The average is 16.3 cents below a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
