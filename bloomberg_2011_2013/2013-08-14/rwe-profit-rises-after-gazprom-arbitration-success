RWE AG (RWE) ,  Germany ’s second-largest
utility, said first-half profit rose 19 percent after
arbitration made gas supply contracts with Russia’s  OAO Gazprom (OGZD) 
more favorable.  Recurrent net income, the measure used to calculate the
dividend, climbed to 1.99 billion euros ($2.64 billion) from
1.67 billion euros a year earlier, the Essen-based company said
today in a statement. That missed the 2.1 billion-euro average
estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales advanced
5.2 percent to 28.5 billion euros.  While conventional power generation profit decreased
because of low power prices, “RWE was able to offset these
burdens thanks to the positive outcome of the arbitration
proceedings with Gazprom,” the company said in the statement.
It will take 3,100 megawatts of generation capacity offline in
Germany and the Netherlands, it said.  RWE and larger competitor EON SE are cutting costs and
selling assets after  Chancellor Angela Merkel  ordered the
permanent halt of all nuclear reactors by 2022 following Japan’s
Fukushima disaster. RWE said in March it would sell its Dea oil
and gas unit to cut spending. The utility plans to raise as much
as 5 billion euros through the sale, a person familiar with the
matter said at the time.  The utility confirmed its full-year forecast for recurrent
net income of 2.4 billion euros and operating profit of 5.9
billion euros, below last year’s level.  EON yesterday said profit fell 42 percent in the first half
after divestments, reduced output and narrower margins on
generation from fossil fuels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
