Solarworld AG (SWV)  Chief Executive
Officer Frank Asbeck expects business to improve in the second
half as last week’s deal to restructure  Germany ’s biggest solar-panel maker boosts customers’ confidence.  The agreement will see shareholders lose 95 percent of
their holdings and bring in a 35 million-euro ($46 million)
investment from Qatar Solar S.P.C., Asbeck said today in a
 letter  to shareholders. The restructuring will be completed by
the end of this year or early next year, he said.  While the solar market remains challenging, the deal “sent
out a positive signal,” he said. “I am confident that business
will improve in the second half of the year compared to the
phase of ongoing restructuring.”  More than a dozen German firms including  Solar Millennium
AG (S2M)  and Q-Cells SE, once the world’s largest cell maker, have
filed for insolvency in the past two years, with Chinese rivals
blamed for selling below cost. The European Commission on Aug. 3
agreed a plan with  China  for a price floor and import curbs.  Asbeck said that accord “does not fulfil its purpose of
stopping the anti-competitive impact of dumping yet, and it
violates trade laws in the European Union.” The company will
challenge the agreement at the EU’s Court of Justice, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
