JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the largest
 U.S. bank , sold $750 million of 30-year bonds in its first
dollar-denominated benchmark issue of the maturity in 20 months.  The 5.625 percent, subordinated notes yielded 190 basis
points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Proceeds will be used for general
corporate purposes, the data show. Benchmark sales are typically
at least $500 million.  JPMorgan issued $1.25 billion of 5.4 percent, 30-year
debentures in December 2011 to yield 250 basis points more than
benchmarks, Bloomberg data show. The notes traded at 108 cents
on the dollar to yield 4.88 percent on Aug. 12, according to
Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority.  Two former JPMorgan employees were charged today by U.S.
prosecutors with attempting to conceal trading losses last year
as part of a probe of the bank’s $6.2 billion loss on
derivatives trades.  Bruno Iksil, the Frenchman at the center of the case who
became known as the “London whale” because his portfolio was
so large, signed a non-prosecution agreement with the U.S. in
June, the government said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
