 The dollar declined from a one-week
high as speculation the  Federal Reserve  will begin reducing its
stimulus measures as soon as next month weighed on demand for
assets denominated in the U.S. currency.  The U.S. currency reversed gains against the euro and yen
as stocks fell and Treasury yields touched two-year highs. The
pound climbed to an eight-week high against the dollar after
U.K. retail sales rose more than forecast. The Bloomberg U.S.
Dollar  Index (SPX)  rose earlier as jobless claims unexpectedly dropped
last week to the lowest level in almost six years. The Fed has
been buying $85 billion of bonds a month to support the economy
and cap borrowing costs.  “The selling of the dollar is consistent with the weakness
in the equity market and the bounce off the yield highs in
bonds,”  Richard Gilhooly , an interest-rate strategist at TD
Securities Inc. in  New York . “The better data today is
misleading.”  The Bloomberg U.S.  Dollar Index   fell  0.5 percent to
1,020.16 at 5 p.m. New York time after earlier rising 0.4
percent to 1,028.72, the strongest since Aug. 5.  The dollar dropped 0.7 percent to $1.3347 per euro and fell
0.8 percent to 97.37 yen.  Japan ’s currency added 0.1 percent to
129.97 per euro.  Benchmark U.S.  10-year note yields  rose to 2.77 percent
after touching 2.82 percent, the highest since August 2011. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of stocks plunged 1.4 percent.  Rupiah, Pound  The Indonesian rupiah fell to its weakest level in more
than four years after the country’s central bank kept its
 reference rate  on hold and a report showed foreign-exchange
reserves fell to the lowest level since 2010. The currency
depreciated 0.6 percent to 10,350 per dollar after earlier
falling to 10,353, its lowest since June 2009.  Britain’s pound has strengthened 3.6 percent in the past
month versus the dollar as reports showed purchasing managers
indexes of manufacturing, services and construction all improved
in July while  house prices  increased. The economy expanded by
0.6 percent in the second quarter.  The U.K. currency gained 0.9 percent to $1.5644 after
advancing to $1.5652, the highest since June 19. Sterling
appreciated 0.2 percent to 85.33 pence per euro after reaching
85.05 pence, the strongest since July 3.  New Zealand ’s dollar strengthened against most of its 16
major peers as data showed manufacturing expanded at the fastest
pace in nine years, job advertisements increased and a gauge of
 consumer confidence  rose. The kiwi rose 0.6 percent to 80.73
U.S. cents.  Industrial Output  The dollar gained earlier as the number of  applications  for
unemployment insurance payments declined by 15,000 to 320,000 in
the week ended Aug. 10, the fewest since October 2007, from a
revised 335,000, a Labor Department report showed today in
 Washington . The  median  forecast of 44 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg called for applications totaling 335,000.  The currency erased the advance after industrial production
in the U.S. was unchanged in July as a slowdown at factories
overshadowed an increase in mining. The reading for output at
factories, mines and utilities followed a 0.2 percent gain the
prior month that was smaller than previously reported, a report
from the Federal Reserve showed. The median forecast in a
Bloomberg survey called for a 0.3 percent rise in July.  “When the claims data came out, it positively impacted the
dollar, but since then we had other data that suggests some
weakness in the  U.S. economy ,” said Charles St-Arnaud, a
foreign-exchange strategist at Nomura Holdings Inc. in New York.
“The manufacturing side of the economy is still struggling.”  Fed Outlook  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  next month will probably
reduce the central bank’s monthly bond purchases, according to
65 percent of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The Federal Open
Market Committee’s first step may be small, with monthly
purchases tapered by $10 billion to a $75 billion pace,
according to the median estimate in a survey of 48 economists
conducted Aug. 9-13.  “If it turns out it’s just a token amount -- no more than
$10 billion -- and if he spells out a scenario whereby there in
no rush to keep slowing purchases, then the dollar could
actually start falling through the tapering,” said  Richard Franulovich , a senior currency strategist at  Westpac Banking
Corp. (WBC)  in New York. “U.S. yields have come a little bit off
their highs, so that explains a little bit of the reversal in
the dollar.”  Options Trading  The dollar has fallen 1.3 percent over the past month, the
most according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes that
track 10 developed-nation currencies. The euro gained 0.2
percent and the yen added 0.6 percent.  Trading in over-the-counter foreign-exchange options
totaled $29 billion, compared with $26 billion yesterday,
according to data reported by U.S. banks to the Depository Trust
Clearing Corp. and tracked by Bloomberg. Volume in options on
the dollar-yen exchange rate amounted to $8.5 billion, the
largest share of trades at 30 percent. Options on the dollar-Chinese  yuan  rate totaled $2.5 billion, or 9 percent.  Dollar-yen options trading was 21 percent more than the
average for the past five Thursdays at a similar time in the
day. Dollar-yuan options trading was 161 percent more than
average.  To contact the reporters on this story:
