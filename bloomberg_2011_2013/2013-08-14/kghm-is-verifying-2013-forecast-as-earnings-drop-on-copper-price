KGHM Polska Miedz SA, the Poland-based copper producer with the largest European mine output,
said it’s “verifying” its full-year earning forecasts after
second-quarter profit fell 56 percent on copper prices.  Unconsolidated  net income , which excludes earnings at
certain units such as KGHM International Ltd., dropped to 666
million zloty ($210 million) from 1.53 billion zloty a year
earlier, the Lubin, southwestern Poland-based company said in a
regulatory statement today.  That brought the half-year result to 1.73 billion zloty, or
54 percent of the company’s 2013 forecast of 3.2 billion zloty.
According to Pawel Puchalski, an analyst at Bank Zachodni WBK
SA, KGHM is now at risk of missing its full-year outlook because
a planned maintenance shutdown at one of its main smelters will
hit third quarter income.  “Net income in the first two quarters should have been
much higher if KGHM wanted to be on track to meet its annual
target,” Puchalski said by phone from Warsaw today. “Investors
will look at the fact that KGHM is verifying the forecasts
rather than at the earnings it reported.”  Shares declined 2 percent to 124.95 zloty at 9:39 a.m.
today, falling the most since Aug. 9. The benchmark WIG20 Index
gained 0.3 percent.  Falling Prices  Copper and silver prices fell earlier this year on lower-than-expected growth in  China  and a signal from the  Federal
Reserve  that it may curb economic stimulus. The average copper
price in the second quarter slipped 8.2 percent to $7,189.6 a
ton from a year earlier, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
metal traded at $7,283.5 at 8:18 a.m. on the London Metal
Exchange today, 6.6 percent below KGHM’s forecast for this year.  KGHM also suffered from a decline in the price of silver,
in which it is the  world’s biggest producer . Silver has slumped
29 percent so far this year and traded at $21.325 an ounce
today, 33 percent below KGHM’s annual target of $32 an ounce.  Unconsolidated KGHM sales fell 17 percent to 4.4 billion
zloty and earnings before interest and taxes were at 918 million
zloty, 54 percent lower than a year earlier.  The company’s consolidated net income also decreased,
falling to 685 million zloty from 1.35 billion zloty and missing
the 842.8 million-zloty  average estimate  of five analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
