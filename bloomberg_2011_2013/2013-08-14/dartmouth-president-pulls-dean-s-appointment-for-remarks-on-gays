Dartmouth College President Philip J. Hanlon revoked the appointment of a dean at the Tucker
Foundation, an ethics center, because of his past remarks about
homosexuality.  The Reverend James Tengatenga, former Anglican bishop of
Southern Malawi and chairman of the Anglican Consultative
Council, won’t become head of the foundation, Hanlon said today
in a  statement . He called for a  task force  to clarify the
foundation’s mission and structure.  Tengatenga’s appointment raised controversy because of
 remarks  he made earlier that appeared to support Anglican church
opposition to same-sex marriage. Hanlon said he spoke personally
with Tengatenga, who said he was committed to gay rights and has
worked in support of them in his own country.  “However, following much reflection and consultation with
senior leaders at Dartmouth, it has become clear to me that Dr.
Tengatenga’s past comments about homosexuality and the
uncertainty and controversy they created have compromised his
ability to serve effectively as dean of Tucker,” he said in the
statement. “The foundation and Dartmouth’s commitment to
inclusion are too important to be mired in discord over this
appointment.”  Dartmouth, located in Hanover,  New Hampshire , is one of
eight northeastern schools in the  Ivy League . It’s under
investigation by the U.S. Education Department for the college’s
response to sexual harassment on campus.  To contact the reporter on this story:
