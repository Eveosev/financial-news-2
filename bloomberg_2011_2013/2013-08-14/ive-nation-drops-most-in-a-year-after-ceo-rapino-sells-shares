Live Nation Entertainment Inc. (LYV) , the
world’s biggest concert promoter and ticket seller, fell the
most in more than a year after Chief Executive Officer Michael Rapino sold about a third of his shares in the company.  Live Nation declined 4.8 percent to $17.32 at the close in
 New York , for the biggest one-day decline since Aug. 10, 2012.
The Beverly Hills, California-based company has added 86 percent
this year.  Rapino’s share sale, his first as CEO of Live Nation, is
for estate-planning purposes, Jacqueline Peterson, a
spokeswoman, said in an interview. Rapino, who signed a five-year employment contract in December, sold about $11.7 million
in shares, according to a filing. Live Nation’s stock edged near
a 52-week high of $18.93 when Rapino sold the shares.  Rapino, 48, sold 175,117 shares for $18.59 each on Aug. 9
and 464,883 for $18.19 each on Aug. 12, according to the filing.  The stock sale accounts for about 7 percent of Rapino’s
overall holdings, including options, Peterson said. The CEO has
more than 1 million shares and options for 3 million shares,
according to filings.  Board members  Ari Emanuel , co-CEO of William Morris
Endeavor Entertainment, and  Mark Shapiro , an executive producer
at Dick Clark Productions, also sold shares, according to
filings. Shapiro sold about 27,000 shares on Aug. 8 for about
$501,000, according to filings. Emanuel sold 26,682 for $501,622
on the same date.  To contact the reporter on this story:
