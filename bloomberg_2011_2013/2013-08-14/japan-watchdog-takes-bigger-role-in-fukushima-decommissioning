Japan ’s regulator today approved
safety plans for decommissioning the Fukushima nuclear plant, a
move that also gives the watchdog authority to step in and
direct the operation if procedures are not followed.  The green light by the Nuclear Regulation Authority was
needed to proceed with the “roadmap” proposed by  Tokyo
Electric Power Co. (9501) , or Tepco, for dismantling the plant, a
process that could take 40 years because of melted uranium fuel
and deadly levels of radiation.  The ruling comes only days after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe
said Tepco isn’t up to the job of containing radioactive water
leaking from the plant into the  Pacific Ocean . Tepco
acknowledged the leaks last month. At least 300 tons of water a
day is pouring into the sea and the leaks may have been
happening for two years, albeit at a slower pace, the government
said last week.  Three reactors at Fukushima went into meltdown after the
earthquake and tsunami of March 2011 crippled the plant, causing
the worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl in 1986.  Tepco will start removing spent fuel rods at the plant
within two years, according to the roadmap released in December
2011. Engineers will attempt to start removing melted fuel from
one of the reactors within a decade, it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
