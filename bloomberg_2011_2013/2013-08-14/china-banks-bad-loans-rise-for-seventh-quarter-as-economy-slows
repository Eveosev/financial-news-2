Chinese banks’ bad loans rose for a
seventh straight quarter, extending the longest streak in at
least nine years as the world’s second-largest economy continued
slowing.  Non-performing loans climbed by 13 billion  yuan  ($2.1
billion) in the second quarter from the end of March, reaching
539.5 billion yuan, the China Banking Regulatory Commission said
in a  statement  on its website today. Soured debt increased
across all lender categories, including state-owned and regional
banks.  China’s economy  slowed for a second straight quarter during
the period, as growth in factory output and fixed-asset
investment weakened. A June crackdown on off-balance-sheet
lending and other credit outside the banking system caused a
cash squeeze, driving money-market rates to a record.  The increase in bad loans was the smallest since the first
quarter of last year, narrowing from 33.6 billion yuan in the
previous three months, and the end-June ratio of nonperforming
loans to total credit was unchanged from three months earlier,
at 0.96 percent, figures from the regulator show. July data last
week, including  industrial output , showed signs that the economy
is stabilizing.  The net interest margin at the nation’s 3,800 lenders
widened to 2.59 percent in the second quarter from 2.57 percent
in the first, the regulator said. The People’s Bank of  China 
last month removed the floor on lending rates offered by the
nation’s financial institutions as authorities give banks more
freedom to set borrowing costs.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
