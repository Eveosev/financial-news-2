Spot gasoline in  New York  Harbor
rallied to the highest premium against futures in almost two
weeks after a government report that  regional refinery
processing  and imports dropped.  Reformulated, 84-octane gasoline , or RBOB, rose 0.25 cent
to 4.25 cents a gallon over futures on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  at 12:16 p.m., the strongest since Aug. 1.
Conventional,  87-octane gasoline  gained 0.25 cent, trimming its
discount to 2.75 cents a gallon.  The Energy Information Administration said today that
refiners processed  1.02 million barrels  a day of crude oil on
the U.S. East Coast in the week ended Aug. 9, 67,000 fewer than
a week earlier.  Imports of gasoline  to the region declined
111,000 barrels to 473,000, a second consecutive decline.  After a Bloomberg survey showed traders chartered 16
medium-range tankers for the Rotterdam-New York trade route in
the two weeks following Aug. 7, compared with 24 ships in the
previous survey.  The 3-2-1 crack spread in New York, a rough measure of
refining margins for gasoline and diesel fuel based on Brent oil
in  Europe , widened 11 cents to $16.84 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
