Palm oil output in  Malaysia  surged
by the most in 10 months in July, beating analysts’
expectations, while reserves in the world’s second-largest
supplier stayed near a two-year low, official data showed.
Futures declined.  Output gained 18 percent to 1.67 million metric tons, the
biggest jump since September, according to data from the
Malaysian Palm Oil Board. That’s more than the median estimate
in a Bloomberg survey for 1.56 million tons. Inventories were
1.66 million tons, 1 percent higher than in June, which was the
lowest level since March 2011, and in line with the survey
median of 1.65 million tons. Shipments gained 0.5 percent to
1.42 million tons, while imports rose 57 percent to 50,173 tons.  Prices of the most-consumed cooking oil declined to the
lowest level in more than three years last month after dropping
for five quarters, the worst run since at least 1995, as
supplies are beat demand. While palm is produced year-round,
output typically accelerates in this half because of growing
cycles. Malaysia and  Indonesia  are the biggest producers.  “The worry is that the seasonal high-production cycle is
already on the way and that for the next few months, excluding
August, we could see production go higher,” said Ivy Ng, an
analyst at CIMB Investment Bank Bhd. “Prices will fail to
really make much headway.”  Palm oil for October delivery dropped 0.3 percent to close
at 2,290 ringgit ($698) a ton on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives.
Futures touched 2,137 ringgit on July 26, the lowest level for a
most-active contract since October 2009.  August Exports  Output in August may be flat or slightly lower on fewer
working days because of the Eid festival last week, while
exports may also be unchanged, Ng said.  Shipments from Malaysia advanced 18 percent to 417,414 tons
in the first 10 days of August from the same period last month,
Intertek said Aug. 12. Exports surged 26 percent to 421,337
tons, according to SGS (Malaysia) Sdn.  World stockpiles of the oil that’s used in everything from
candy to biofuel will surge 21 percent to a record 9.7 million
tons by the end of 2013-2014, while demand expands 4.6 percent,
the least in 12 years, the U.S. Department of Agriculture says.  To contact the reporter on this story:
