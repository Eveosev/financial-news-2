Salzgitter AG (SZG) , the German steelmaker
that last week predicted a loss for 2013 amid waning demand in
Europe, plans to cut more than 1,500 jobs as it seeks to save
more than 200 million euros ($265 million) a year.  Salzgitter, based in the town of the same name, has drawn
up a framework agreement with the works council and the IG
Metall labor union that is “due for formal signing in the near
future,” it said in a statement. The state of Lower Saxony
holds a 26.5 percent stake in the company.  The steelmaker reduced its profit forecast on Aug. 5, the
third time in nine months that it lowered its guidance, as
competition stemming from underutilization of production
capacity in southern Europe pushed selling prices for most
rolled steel products below manufacturing cost. That left the
company with a first-half loss of 315 million euros.  Salzgitter’s performance in the first six months of 2013
“was largely determined by the structural crisis in the
European steel industry,” it said. The company cited asset
impairments at the Peiner Traeger unit, weakness of steel
products amid a downturn in the construction industry, and a
“dramatic lack of orders” at its tubes division.  The shares have fallen 26 percent this year, while steel-industry peers  ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA)  and  Kloeckner & Co. SE (KCO)  have
declined 5 percent and 19 percent, respectively, in that period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
