Indian (SENSEX)  stocks advanced for a fourth
day, led by metal producers, as  Tata Steel Ltd.’s (TATA)  profit surge
overshadowed worse-than-estimated inflation data.  Tata Steel, India’s biggest producer, climbed 3.6 percent
after the company reported its biggest quarterly profit in two
years.  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , the owner of Jaguar Land Rover, jumped
9.7 percent, the largest increase since March 2010.  Financial
Technologies  (India) Ltd. tumbled 13 percent to a nine-year low.  The Sensex rose 0.7 percent to 19,367.59 at the close in
Mumbai. Wholesale prices grew 5.79 percent in July from a year
earlier, data showed, compared with the 5 percent median
estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg survey. The  Reserve Bank of
India  raised two  interest rates  last month and the government
this week stepped up efforts to curb the record current-account
deficit as a weak rupee boosts import costs.  “Higher inflation will end whatever little flexibility the
RBI had on monetary policy,” Aneesh Srivastava, chief
investment officer at IDBI Federal Life Insurance, said in a
phone interview.  The government increased  import duties  on gold, platinum
and silver yesterday, part of measures to trim a record current-account deficit and support the rupee after it weakened to a
record low this month. The central bank tightened lenders’
access to cash in July, and held the benchmark repurchase rate
at its last two policy meetings, citing inflation risks.  Metal Producers  Tata Steel advanced 3.6 percent to 250.10 rupees, the
highest close since July 16. The company reported group net
income climbed to 11.4 billion rupees ($186 million) in the
three months ended June, from 5.98 billion rupees a year
earlier. That compared with the 3.05 billion-rupee median
estimate of 19 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Aluminum maker  Hindalco Industries Ltd. (HNDL)  advanced 7.4
percent to 98.20 rupees, the biggest rise since Sept. 14.
 Sterlite Industries India Ltd. (STLT) , the nation’s largest copper
producer, rose for a fifth day, gaining 2.3 percent to 81.25
rupees. Shares of the three metals makers slumped at least 34
percent this year through Aug. 6.  Tata Motors jumped 9.7 percent to 319.10 rupees, capping
its biggest two-day rally since October 2011, after Jaguar Land
Rover sales climbed 21 percent in July.  Housing Development Finance Corp. (HDFC)  declined 1.4 percent to
780.70 rupees.  Financial Technologies  Financial Technologies, which controls  Multi Commodity
Exchange of India Ltd. , the nation’s biggest commodity futures
exchange, tumbled 13 percent to 146.95 rupees, the lowest close
since December 2004. Its unit National Spot Exchange Ltd. is
planning a pay-out of dues to buyers, sellers and brokers
arising from the cancellation of contracts, which prompted a
two-day, 73 percent slump in Financial Exchange’s shares earlier
this month.  “There is uncertainty about the settlement plan, which is
prompting investors to sell shares,” Kishor Ostwal, managing
director at  CNI Research Ltd. (CNIR) , said today. Multi Commodity
Exchange shares dropped 5 percent to a record low.  The Sensex has lost 0.3 percent this year and  trades  at
13.7 times projected 12-month earnings, compared with the MSCI
 Emerging Markets  Index’s 10.2 times.  About 47 percent of Sensex companies missed analyst
earnings estimates in the June quarter. That compares with 27
percent for the three months ended March, and 43 percent in the
quarter through December, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
