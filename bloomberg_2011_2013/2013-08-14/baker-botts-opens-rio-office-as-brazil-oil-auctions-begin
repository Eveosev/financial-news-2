Baker Botts LLP, the fourth-biggest
adviser on North American oil and natural gas deals this year,
is expanding to  Brazil  as Petroleo Brasileiro SA and rivals
prepare for the 15 billion-reais ($6.5 billion) auction of an
offshore lease.  Baker Botts is opening an office in Rio De Janeiro, its
first in Latin America in almost 50 years, the Houston-based
legal firm said in a statement today. The company, founded in
1840, has more than 700 lawyers operating in 15 offices
worldwide and has been working with Brazilian clients for at
least seven years.  Brazil in May held its first oil block auction since 2008,
with Total SA, BP Plc and BG Group Plc among the winners. In
October, the government is scheduled to auction the offshore
Libra oil field with a signing bonus set at 15 billion reais.
State-controlled Petrobras will operate and hold at least 30
percent of the field, which the country’s oil regulator says
holds between 8 billion and 12 billion barrels of oil. An
auction of gas blocks is scheduled for November.  “It’s a historic moment for Brazil -- after a hiatus, the
bid rounds are coming quick and fast,” John White, one of two
resident partners at the Rio office, said in a phone interview
today. The office will focus on infrastructure as well as the
oil and power business, he said.  Baker Botts has a 13 percent share in the market for North
American oil and gas deals this year, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The firm’s market share for Latin American deals
during the past five years is 0.1 percent, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
