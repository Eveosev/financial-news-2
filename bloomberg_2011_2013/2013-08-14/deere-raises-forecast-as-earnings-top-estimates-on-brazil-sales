Deere & Co. (DE)  forecast a decline in
U.S. farm revenue, a key indicator of agricultural-equipment
sales, through 2014 as crop prices weaken.  U.S. farm cash receipts will drop to $389.8 billion in 2013
and $379.7 billion next year from a record $402.1 billion last
year, the world’s largest farm-equipment maker said in a  slide
presentation  accompanying its fiscal third-quarter earnings
report today. Deere’s annual sales have gained 50 percent since
fiscal 2007 as farmers’ revenue was bolstered by a rally in
agricultural commodities.  “Cash receipts are typically an indicator of future
demand,” Andrew Casey, a Boston-based analyst for  Wells Fargo &
Co ., said in a report today. Deere’s forecast for two straight
years of lower crop cash suggests “future farm equipment demand
softness.”  Most-active futures in  Chicago  for corn, the largest U.S.
crop by sales, have dropped 42 percent in the past year while
soybeans have fallen 22 percent on forecasts for production to
rebound this year.  Deere fell 1.9 percent to $82.34 at the close in  New York .
 The shares  have declined 4.7 percent this year.  Net income rose to $996.5 million, or $2.56 a share, in the
three months through July from $788 million, or $1.98, a year
earlier, the Moline, Illinois-based company said today in its
earnings statement. That exceeded the $2.18 average of 19
analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Equipment sales
climbed 4.3 percent to $9.32 billion, beating the $9.26 billion
average of 12 estimates.  Past ‘Peak’  Deere said net profit will be about $3.45 billion in the
fiscal year through October, up from a May forecast of $3.3
billion.  “It was a good quarter but longer-term we expect
fundamentals to weaken in  North America  for agriculture,” Larry De Maria, a New York-based analyst for William Blair & Co. who
has the equivalent of a sell rating on Deere, said in a
telephone interview this morning. “The peak probably just
happened.”  Deere said equipment sales in the current fiscal fourth
quarter will drop about 5 percent from a year earlier, when the
company ran factories at a high rate to meet customer orders.  For the full fiscal year, equipment sales will increase 5
percent. Sales at Deere’s agriculture and turf machinery segment
will increase by about 7 percent in the period, including a
negative currency impact of about 1 percent, the company said.  Revenue from construction and forestry equipment will drop
about 8 percent on “a cautious outlook for U.S. economic
growth,” it said.  U.S. and  Canada  made up 64 percent of Deere’s $36.2 billion
in  sales  last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
