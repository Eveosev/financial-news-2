Leon Cooperman ’s Omega Advisors Inc.
exited its stake in Facebook Inc. and bought  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  as the
shares dropped during the second quarter, a regulatory filing
showed.  Omega sold 3.67 million shares of Facebook, owner of the
world’s most popular social-networking service, that were worth
$93.8 million during the three months ended June 30, according
to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission released
today. The hedge fund purchased 31,000 Apple shares for a stake
of $12.3 million as the stock slid 10 percent in the quarter.  Omega managed about $8.9 billion as of July 31, according
to the company’s  website . The hedge fund dumped stakes in
precious metals it entered in the previous quarter after gold
and silver extended losses. Some investors have lost faith in
the metals as a store of value amid a U.S. equity rally and low
inflation.  The hedge fund sold $13.9 million in the SPDR Gold Trust,
$4.39 million of the iShares Silver Trust and $4.35 million of
the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF, according to the report to
the SEC. Gold futures sank 23 percent during the second quarter
and silver plunged 32 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
