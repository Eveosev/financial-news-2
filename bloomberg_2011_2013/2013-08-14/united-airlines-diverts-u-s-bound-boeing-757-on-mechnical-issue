United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL) 
said it diverted a Boeing Co. 757 airliner bound for the U.S. to
Dublin because of a technical glitch.  The plane that departed  London Heathrow  for Washington
Dulles landed safely at Dublin at 2.29 p.m. local time, United
said today by e-mail. The jet, with 147 passengers and nine crew
on board, suffered a “mechanical issue,” it said.  United said its maintenance team is inspecting the plane.  The diversion came on the same day that Chicago-based
Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner was hit by a new operational problem as
ANA Holdings Inc. found faulty wiring on the plane’s fire-suppression system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
