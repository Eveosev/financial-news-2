The first thing that struck me when I read Elon Musk’s  plan  for a sort of high-speed pneumatic tube system between Los Angeles and San Francisco, was the urge to say “Gee whiz!” There’s not a lot of novelty in transportation these days: Elon Musk is thought of as an incredible innovator because he managed to create a marketable car that runs on an electric motor rather than gasoline. I’m ready to scrap California’s high-speed rail project and build this hyperloop thing instead just because, wow, cool! Might it be a massive waste of government funds? Possibly, but probably not  as wasteful as the high-speed rail project . And I adhere to the basic principle that if the government is going to fritter away our money on infrastructure projects, those projects should be as nifty and futuristic as possible. But I suppose that we can’t actually authorize infrastructure projects without examining the basic costs and benefits (though if you’ll look at the California plan, you’ll see they came  pretty close ). So why might we want to build a hyperloop, instead of a train or nothing at all? So what are the downsides? Overall, I hope someone builds this, as it’s potentially revolutionary. But as whiz-bang as the hyperloop is, I’m not sure it’s powerful enough to overcome the fearsome obstacles to its own existence.
