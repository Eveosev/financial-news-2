CarVal Investors LLC, the asset
management unit of agricultural commodities trader Cargill Inc.,
raised $2.3 billion for a distressed debt investment fund.  The CVI Credit Value Fund II will buy corporate bonds, loan
portfolios, liquidated assets and structured products primarily
in western  Europe  and the U.S., the Minneapolis-based firm said
in an e-mailed statement.  CarVal , founded by Cargill in 1987 to focus on proprietary
and high-yield debt trading, has been buying assets from banks
which are shrinking balance sheets to meet stricter capital
rules. It acquired 380 million euros ($504 million) of non-performing real estate loans from London-based Lloyds Banking
Group Plc in November, paying about 25 percent of the debtâ€™s
face value.  CVI Credit Value Fund I, another CarVal-managed credit fund
investing in distressed debt, recorded a 20.2 percent net return
this year, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
