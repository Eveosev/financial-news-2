     Aug. 14 (Bloomberg) --The U.K. Royal Navy recorded its
biggest  seizure  of illegal drugs in four years in an operation
near Puerto Rico.  The Royal Navy confiscated cocaine with an estimated street
value of 100 million pounds ($155.2 million) from a speedboat
earlier this week, Damien Elvin, a spokesman for the Ministry of
Defence in London, said in a phone interview. The date of the
operation has yet to be disclosed, he said.  A Lynx helicopter from the HMS Lancaster and a high-speed
pursuit boat intercepted the 30-foot vessel and three suspected
smugglers after a U.S. Customs and Border Agency aircraft
spotted the boat in the Caribbean Sea off the U.S. territory.  Royal Navy divers recovered the 1,499 pound stash after the
three men threw it overboard. The men were handed over to Puerto
Rican authorities and the boat sunk by Royal Navy gunfire as per
standard practice, according to an e-mailed statement today from
the ministry.  “It is an amazing feeling to get such a great bust and
stop millions of pounds worth of cocaine hitting the streets,”
said Able Seaman James Duffy, coxswain of one of Lancaster’s Sea
Boats, according to the ministry statement.  The U.S. Coast Guard has seized 45,200 pounds of cocaine
and 8,500 pounds of marijuana during 22 operations in the past
year, according to the U.K. ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
