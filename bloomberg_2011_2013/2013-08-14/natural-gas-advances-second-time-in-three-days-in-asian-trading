Natural gas futures advanced in New
York for the second time in three days on forecasts for above-normal temperatures that would boost demand from  power plants .  Gas gained 1.7 percent as MDA Weather Services said the
weather may be hotter than normal in the Northeast and upper
Midwest from Aug. 19 through Aug. 28. The futures dropped 3.5
percent last week, reaching the lowest price since February. The
high in New York on Aug. 23 may be 92 degrees Fahrenheit (33
Celsius), 10 more than usual, according to  AccuWeather Inc.   “We have a little bit of heat showing up in the Midwest
and Northeast,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at
Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “The strength is on
the long side of the market after we fell to a five-month low
last week.”  Natural gas for September delivery rose 5.7 cents to settle
at $3.342 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Trading volume was 20 percent above the
100-day average at 3:58 p.m. Prices are up 18 percent from a
year ago.  The discount of September to October futures narrowed 0.4
cent to 2.3 cents. October gas traded 39.6 cents below the
January contract, compared with 40.3 cents yesterday  October $4.10 calls were the most active options in
electronic trading. They were 0.3 cent higher at 0.9 cent per
million Btu on volume of 1,040 at 4:02 p.m. Calls accounted for
53 percent of trading volume. Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in September was 33.15 percent at 4 p.m.,
compared with 32.18 percent yesterday.  Hotter Weather  The high in  Detroit  on Aug. 23 may be 88 degrees, 8 above
average, AccuWeather data show. Power generation accounts for 32
percent of U.S. gas demand, according to the Energy Information
Administration, the Energy Department’s statistical arm.  An area of showers and thunderstorms in the northwestern
 Caribbean Sea  has a 60 percent chance of becoming a tropical
cyclone in the next 48 hours, the National Hurricane Center said
in an  outlook  at 2 p.m. in Miami.  Enbridge Inc. is evacuating non-essential personnel from
the Ship Shoal 207 and Ship Shoal 332 platforms south of
 Louisiana  in the  Gulf of Mexico , part of the company’s Manta Ray
offshore gathering system, according to a website posting. The
gathering system is still in service.  Another system southeast of the Cape Verde Islands has a 70
percent chance of becoming a tropical cyclone within the same
time period, the hurricane center said.  The Gulf accounts for 5.7 percent of U.S. gas production,
according to the EIA.  Gas Surplus  An EIA report scheduled for release at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow
in  Washington  may show that gas inventories rose 69 billion
cubic feet last week, according to the median of 19 analyst
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. The five-year average gain for
the period is 42 billion. Supplies climbed by 20 billion the
same week last year.  Gas stockpiles totaled 2.941 trillion cubic feet in the
week ended Aug. 2, 0.7 percent above the five-year average,
rising to a  surplus  for the first time since March. Inventories
were 9.2 percent below year-earlier supplies.  The U.S. cut its 2013 marketed gas production estimate to
69.89 billion cubic feet a day from last month’s forecast of
69.96 billion, the EIA said Aug. 6 in in its Short-Term Energy
Outlook. Output may rise 1 percent from a year ago to a record
as onshore supplies climb.  Inventories may total 3.8 trillion cubic feet at the end of
October, about 130 billion below last year’s peak, the EIA said.  Marcellus Shale  Gas production in the Northeast probably outpaced regional
demand for the first time this spring amid rising output from
the Marcellus shale formation, Biliana Pehlivanova, an analyst
at Barclays Plc in  New York , said in a note to clients dated
yesterday.  Production from the Marcellus and Utica reservoirs may grow
by 3.6 billion cubic feet a day in 2013 and 3.3 billion a day in
2014, Barclays said. The Northeast may become a net exporter to
other regions throughout most of the year by 2015, according to
the report.  The U.S. met 87 percent of its own energy needs in the
first four months of 2013, on pace to be the highest annual rate
since 1985, according to EIA data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
