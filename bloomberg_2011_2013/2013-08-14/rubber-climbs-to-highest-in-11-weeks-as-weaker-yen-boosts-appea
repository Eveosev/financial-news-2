Rubber advanced to the highest level
in 11 weeks as a weakening Japanese currency made yen-based
contracts more attractive and data yesterday added to signs the
global economy is improving.  Rubber for delivery in January on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange rose as much as 1.5 percent to 269 yen a kilogram
($2,739 a metric ton), the highest level for a most-active
contract since May 29. Futures traded at 266.6 yen at 10:54 a.m.
and have lost 12 percent this year.  The yen was little changed at 98.28 per dollar after
closing at a 1 1/2-week low yesterday. U.S. retail sales
advanced for a fourth month, data showed yesterday, after other
reports showing German investor confidence and Japanese
machinery orders topped estimates and euro-area factory output
expanded in June.  “Rubber was supported by the depreciation of yen against
the dollar,” said Ryuta Imazeki, an analyst at Okachi & Co.  Economists in separate Bloomberg polls estimate the number
of people in the U.S. continuing to receive jobless benefits
probably decreased by 18,000 to 3 million in the week ended Aug.

its data tomorrow.  Rubber for delivery in January was little changed at 19,860
 yuan  ($3,244) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange.  Thai rubber free-on-board gained for a fourth day yesterday,
rising 1.3 percent to 80.50 baht ($2.57) a kilogram, according
