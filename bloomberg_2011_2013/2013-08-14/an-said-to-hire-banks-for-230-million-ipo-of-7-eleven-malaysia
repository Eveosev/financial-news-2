Malaysian billionaire Vincent Tan
hired UBS AG and Maybank Investment Bank Bhd. as lead managers
to help raise about 750 million ringgit ($230 million) through
an initial public offering of  7-Eleven Malaysia Sdn. , two people
familiar with the matter said.  The retailer could begin trading in Kuala Lumpur as early
as this year, said the people, who asked not to be named as the
information is private. The final size and timing of the
offering have yet to be determined, they said.  The proposed share sale comes after the benchmark FTSE
Bursa  Malaysia  KLCI Index closed at a record on July 24,
spurring more companies to list. UMW Holdings Bhd. said it plans
a share sale for its oil and gas unit. Westports Holdings Sdn.,
a ports operator, is also preparing for an IPO.  7-Eleven is Malaysia’s biggest convenience store operator
with more than 1,300 outlets nationwide, according to its
website. Tan, the company’s chairman and founder of gaming and
retail group  Berjaya Corp. (BC) , didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment and a spokeswoman couldn’t be reached by
phone today.  The appointment of banks was first reported by the Wall
Street Journal today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
