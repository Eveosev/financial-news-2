The Slovak Finance Ministry proposed
cutting the budget  deficit  less than previously planned next
year to shake off an economic slowdown and boost growth.  The draft 2014 spending plan posted on the ministry’s
 website  today targets a shortfall of 2.9 percent of gross
domestic product, compared with this year’s goal of 2.94
percent. The ministry originally planned to cut the deficit to
2.6 percent next year.  “Strictly meeting the planned pace of consolidation can at
this time negatively influence the country’s economy and its
economic growth,” the ministry said in the draft.  With Prime Minister  Robert Fico ’s government expecting
growth to decelerate to 0.5 percent this year, from 2 percent in
2012, it is relaxing the pace of fiscal consolidation because
more spending cuts could smother a revival. The slowdown has
caused tax receipts to under-perform and prompted Finance
Minister Peter Kazimir to say on June 27 that Slovakia, which
joined the euro in 2009, would miss its 2013 budget goal.  Meeting the goal for next year still requires measures
worth 703 million euros ($932 million), with more than half
coming through making state administration more efficient,
Kazimir told a news conference. The spending plan is based on an
assumption of the economy expanding 2.2 percent. It proposed
cutting the deficit to 2.6 percent of annual output in 2015 and
1.5 percent in 2016.  To contact the reporter on this story:
