MGM Holdings Inc. (MGMB) , the studio that
makes  James Bond movies , said second-quarter profit from
continuing operations soared on home-entertainment sales of the
film hit “The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.”  Net income increased to $35.9 million, up from profit of
$5.9 million from continuing operations a year earlier, when the
company sold some assets. Revenue more than doubled to $339
million from $128.4 million a year ago, the  Beverly Hills ,
California-based studio said today in a statement.  MGM is counting on future “Hobbit” and James Bond films
to sustain its momentum. Home-entertainment revenue increased
more than sixfold to $179.9 million from $28.4 million a year
earlier, sparked by international sales of “The Hobbit” and
revenue from the latest James Bond film “Skyfall.” Revenue
from licensing films and TV shows also soared.  MGM emerged from bankruptcy more than two years ago and in
July 2012 filed for a possible initial public offering.  The company has two releases scheduled for later this year,
“Carrie,” with Sony Corp., which is set to open in theaters on
Oct. 18, and “The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug” with Time
Warner Inc.’s New Line on Dec. 13.  Releases next year include “RoboCop,” “22 Jump Street,”
“Hercules,” “Poltergeist,” and the third film in “The
Hobbit,” the company said.  Shares of MGM, intermittently traded over the counter, rose
3.5 percent to $58.50 from $56.50 on Aug. 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
