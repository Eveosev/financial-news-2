Novartis AG (NOVN)  said a former employee
who alleges the Swiss drugmaker asked her to give doctors
kickbacks for sales has made a 5 million- yuan  ($817,000)
compensation claim against the company.  Novartis spokesman  Eric Althoff  confirmed the woman has
filed a complaint with Chinese authorities, without further
specifying the nature of the accusation, citing an internal
investigation at the Basel-based drugmaker.  The former employee, identified by the pseudonym Li Li,
said her manager told her to spend 50,000 yuan to sell 50 doses
of the Sandostatin LAR stomach cancer medication, according to a
 report  yesterday from the 21st Century Business Herald, a
newspaper based in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou.  “Novartis takes allegations of misconduct seriously and
will take appropriate actions depending on the findings once the
investigation is concluded,” Althoff said today in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
