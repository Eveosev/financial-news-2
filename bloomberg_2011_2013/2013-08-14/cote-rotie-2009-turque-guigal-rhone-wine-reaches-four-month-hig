Three half-cases of Cote Rotie 2009
La Turque Guigal from  France ’s northern Rhone sold for the
highest price in four months on the Liv-ex wine exchange this
week as investors focused more outside the core Bordeaux market.  Six bottles of the Rhone vintage fetched the equivalent of
4,182 pounds ($6,460) per 12-bottle case yesterday, while 12
bottles, packed as two half-cases, sold on Aug. 12 for the per-case equivalent of 3,910 pounds, according to data on Liv-ex’s
Cellar Watch website. The vintage last traded above 3,900 pounds
a case in March.  The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index has risen 3 percent this
year, with gains in the 10 weeks to mid-March pared by a drop
since then. While the index, a benchmark for top wines from
Bordeaux, is heading for its fifth straight month of declines
following a muted response to the sales campaign for the
region’s 2012 wine futures, appetite persists for older vintages
and wines from alternative areas.  “Other regions have benefited from buyers diversifying
from Bordeaux,” Liv-ex wrote in its market blog earlier this
month. It said Bordeaux first-growth estates last month provided
“much of the impetus for the market’s decline.”  Guigal’s 2009 La Turque is the third-most expensive in the
past decade, after its 2005 and 2003 wines, according to Cellar
Watch data. The wine, made from Syrah grapes, comes from
vineyards on the Cote Brune above the town of Ampuis on the
Rhone, where Guigal is based.  The 2009 La Turque was awarded a perfect 100-point score by
U.S. wine critic  Robert Parker , who described it in a December
2012  tasting note  as “a remarkably concentrated, profound wine
that is built like a skyscraper.”  Domaine Guigal  was founded in 1946 in Cote Rotie by Etienne
Guigal and has been run since 1961 by his son Marcel and, more
recently, grandson Philippe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
