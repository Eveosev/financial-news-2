Hamburger Hafen & Logistik AG (HHFA) , the
handler of about 80 percent of containers at the Hamburg port,
raised its 2013 volume forecast after Far East trade gathered
pace and Baltic Sea traffic grew.  HHLA expects single-digit percentage growth in the number
of standard 20-foot containers handled in Hamburg and its Black
Sea terminal in Odessa, Ukraine, the company said today in a
 statement . The transport company previously anticipated that
volume would be similar to the prior year’s level.  HHLA, which also operates land-transport, real estate and
logistic units, reported a 6.8 percent increase to 3.8 million
containers in the first half. Earnings before interest and taxes
at its container unit gained 3 percent to 68.8 million euros
($91.2 million). Trade with the Far East grew 8.5 percent,
making up 43.5 percent of all containers handled by the company
in Hamburg.  “This success is primarily due to the strong growth in
European feeder traffic to the Baltic Sea and a substantial
recovery in the handling of containers from the Far East in
Hamburg,” the company said.  First-half earnings fell 14 percent to 81 million euros,
the company said. The modernization of the Burchardkai terminal
in Hamburg and flood-related losses in its land-transport unit
led to the decline, while a property sale inflated the year-ago
figure, said Karl Olaf Petters, spokesman for HHLA, by phone.  HHLA reiterated its full year forecast for revenue of 1.1
billion euros to 1.2 billion euros. The company also said it
expects Ebit at the lower half of its previously anticipated
range of 155 million euros to 175 million euros.  HHLA shares fell as much as 0.9 percent and traded 0.7
percent lower at 17.37 euros as of 11:50 a.m. in  Frankfurt ,
valuing the company at 1.3 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
