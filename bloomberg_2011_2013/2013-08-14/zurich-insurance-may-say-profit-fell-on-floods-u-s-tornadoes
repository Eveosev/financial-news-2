Zurich Insurance Group AG (ZURN) , the
biggest Swiss insurer, may say second-quarter profit declined 23
percent after higher natural catastrophe losses.  Net income probably fell to $823.8 million from $1.08
billion a year earlier, according to the average estimate of
five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The company is due to
report earnings tomorrow at 6:45 a.m. local time.  Zurich Insurance said last month that claims from the
floods in central Europe in May and June and two tornadoes in
the U.S. could reach $278 million. The worst flooding in more
than a decade along the watersheds of Danube and Elbe rivers
produced estimated losses of $140 million, while the tornadoes
that hit  Oklahoma City  in May resulted in claims of $138
million, according to the company.  Zurich Insurance has climbed 3.5 percent in Swiss trading
this year, valuing the company at 37.4 billion francs ($40
billion). That compares with an 18 percent increase of the 30-member Bloomberg  Europe  500 Insurance Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
