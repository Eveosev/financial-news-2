France’s Interior Minister  Manuel
Valls , who has clashed with Justice Minister Christiane Taubira
over planned criminal law reform, said the final decision on the
matter will come from President  Francois Hollande .  The spat between the two ministers is part of the “normal
debate process,” Valls said today in an interview on RTL radio.
He and Taubira are working together and share the same “strict
stance against delinquents,” Valls said.  Valls criticized Taubira’s proposed reform in a private
letter to the president published by French daily Le Monde this
week. According to the letter, he disagreed with changes to
minimum prison sentences and rules for repeat offenders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
