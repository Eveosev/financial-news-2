Tullett (TLPR)  Prebon Plc, a London-based
inter-dealer broker, rehired Shane Burton to oversee its carbon
options business after Jerry Vlam, 43, left the firm last month.  Tullett persuaded Burton to return after leaving the
company about a year ago, Nigel Szembel, a spokesman at the
broker, said in an e-mailed response to questions.  Carbon trading via brokers including Tullett plunged last
month to its lowest since at least January 2011, according to
the London Energy Brokersâ€™ Association, as banks scaled back
buying and selling amid tighter regulation and a glut of permits
that pushed prices to a record low in April.  Inter-dealer brokers such as Tullett and ICAP Plc act as a
go-between for banks that trade bonds, stocks, currencies,
energy and derivatives. Tullett reported a 5.4 percent drop in
first-half pretax profit on July 30. Its shares have climbed 35
percent this year, valuing the broker at about 739 million
pounds ($1.1 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
