Ever northward we drift, leaving
behind comfortable hangouts on the Upper West Side -- once
defined as south of 96th street, but increasingly fluid.  That tiresome putdown of the entire west side as a food
wasteland is slowly dying and maybe we can help.  Building on our last roundup, we headed up to Morningside
Heights, with a few fallbacks toward the end.  Morningside is a historic area, home to  Columbia University 
and the  Manhattan School of Music , as well as the immense (and
ever unfinished)  Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine , which
outranks, say,  Notre Dame  in our mind because of its annual
blessing of the animals. The sainted Sugar, a beagle of
considerable renown and an avid believer in Episcopalian
inclusionism, once attended.  Here’s our list of places you could try.  Community Food & Juice  In a bright space with a busy open kitchen,  Community  has
been serving reliable dishes since 2007, from breakfast and
brunch to lunch and dinner. To further the name, the place has
some large communal tables, which we avoided, preferring to sit
alone and worry about climate change. It was hot that night.  Not sure why we ordered potato pancakes topped with
horseradish sour cream, but they were crunchy and one of us was
partial to the chunk of smoked sablefish, ($12).  There is a weekday special of a grass-fed beef burger and
a draft brew for $16.  Community is at 2893 Broadway between 112th and 113th
Streets. +1-212-665-2800.  Pisticci  Spread over three rooms, this rustic-looking Italian
restaurant is named after the Forte-family hometown in  Italy .
Avoiding the joyous music in the front room, we hid out in the
back with its stone walls, thinking of Thomas Cromwell.  We perked up -- it was still hot, even in this appealingly
dungeon-like space -- with a “Morningside,” a refreshing mix
of Hendrick’s gin, muddled cucumber, lime and mint served
straight up in a martini glass ($11). A half-carafe of house
Montepulciano was a steal at $10.50.  Starters include an enormous steamed artichoke ($8.95). As
always, we had a caprese with good mozzarella di bufala ($9.95).  The meat eater really went for the broccoli rabe
orecchiette with pepperoncino and spicy sausage (14.95). The
vegetarian enjoyed the penne Pisticci with yellow and red tomato
sauce along with chunks of more mozzarella ($13.95).  Warning: American Express is not accepted. On Sundays there
is live jazz.  Pisticci is at 125 La Salle St. between Broadway and
Claremont Ave. +1-212-932-3500.  Jin Ramen  Located beneath the elevated subway at 125th Street, the
wood-paneled noodle shop is packed with Columbia students.  Ask for the tonkotzu ramen of creamy white pork bone stock
($12.00) and a rich miso ramen ($13.00) filled with scallions,
sausage, pork belly and bok choy. A good starter is nankotsu
kara-age, Japanese-style fried chicken marinated in soy and
mirin ($7).  A glass of Coedo Beniaka, a lager brewed from sweet
potatoes, revived us from the sweat-soaked wait.  Jin Ramen  is at 3183 Broadway between Tiemann Place and
125th St. +1-646-559-2862.  Sezz Medi  Tepid breezes were already taunting us as we sat in front
of the tall open windows when we noticed the blazing pizza oven
in the back (think Dante’s “Inferno”). Some icy Trebbiano
helped us get through the fried calamari and zucchini appetizers
($14.00). The pizza with anchovies was a winner ($13.00). We
will return on a cooler night.  (Actually, we’re not sure we can! Looks like the place
closed down right after our visit).  Sezz Medi is or was at 1260 Amsterdam Ave. near West 122nd
St. +1-212-932-2901.  Max Soha  Still there, right up the block is Max Soha, a casual
Italian with an outdoor wrap-around deck. Friends in the
neighborhood praise the pastas ($11 - $16) and daily specials at
very reasonable prices. It’s cash only.  We cooled off with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and fresh
berries.  Max Soha  is at 1262 Amsterdam Ave. at West 123rd St. +1-212-531-2221.  Bistro Ten 18  Make sure to sit outside on the 110th Street side for a
very European view over the Synod House of St. John the Divine.  Stick with starters and small plates or wait until Sunday
when the all-you-can-eat mussels are $19.50. There were no
complaints about the turkey burger dressed up with a slice of
cheese and onions, but some of the mains seemed a bit pricey.
Attentive service.  Afterwards, take a walk along Cathedral Parkway with its
grand architecture and dramatic views.  Bistro Ten 18 is at 1018 Amsterdam Ave. +1-662-7600.  A Cafe  You thought your kitchen at home was tiny! Somehow in the
back of this shoebox, chef Al Williams from Trinidad conjures up
the most astonishing meals.  Arrive between six and eight p.m. to gorge on two courses
for $25. And what starters: a truffled mousse; a savory baked
Anjou pear; grilled avocado stuffed with mushrooms; and broiled
escargots in a cilantro-chili butter.  Mains include a Caribbean-style smoked chicken breast with
a puree of papaya and lime and a juicy duck leg confit.  We shared a perfect apple tart for $8.  Wine lovers adore A Cafe. There’s no bar, but no corkage
fee either. You’re welcome along with your bottles.  A Cafe  is at 973 Columbus Ave. at 108th St. +1-212-222-2033.  La Piccola Cucina  Even smaller than A Cafe, this 10-table storefront is a
real find with its table linens, jazz pitched low, and a
broadsheet menu. Ample selections of Italian dishes are on one
side, and wines are on the reverse, by the bottle or glass. The
$10 Chardonnay did not disappoint.  The al dente linguine alle vongole studded with plump fresh
molluscs in a garlicky broth ($18) and the mussels were first
rate. Chef Adolfo Palta specializes in chicken and veal, and the
daily specials include fish.  La Piccola Cucina is at 964 Amsterdam Ave., just above
107th Street. +1-212-866-1336.  Aangan  Aangan’s contemporary dining room is nicely appointed with
a cascading multi-tiered chandelier. Flickering candles in wall
sconces and soft Indian music contribute to the tranquil vibe,
but also reminded us of  climate change .  We ordered chicken samosas ($8.95), a platter of kebabs,
mint chicken and chicken tikka ($15.95). The pallid breads were
disappointing, unlike the main courses  Lots of passing of plates followed, filled with slow-cooked
goat in a saffron and cardamom sauce ($16.95), chicken with
spinach ($14.95), a superb chicken biryani ($14.95) and jumbo
tandoori shrimp ($19.95).  Aangan is at 2701 Broadway between 103rd and 104th Streets.
+1-212-280-4100.  Buceo 95  We relapsed one night, longing for the tapas at Buceo 95
which is within the safe old zone just south of 96th street.  By then, the heat was almost bearable and we sat at one of
the tiny tables jammed along the side street enjoying a quartino
of the Gruner Veltliner, chatting up passing dogs and their
human companions.  The place has rarely disappointed with its varied small
plates and attractive servers. We had the roasted asparagus with
a citrusy aioli ($9), grilled calamari ($11), bacalao croquettes
flavored with saffron ($10) and the tiny and tangy meatballs
($10).  Buceo 95 is 201 West 95th St. off Columbus Ave. +1-212-662-7010.  (Manuela Hoelterhoff is executive editor of Muse, the arts
