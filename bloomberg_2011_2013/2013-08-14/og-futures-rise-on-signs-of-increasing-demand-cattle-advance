Hog futures rose for the third day
on signs that U.S. slaughtering plants are buying more animals
as pork demand improves. Cattle also advanced.  Meatpackers processed 841,000 hogs in the first two days
this week, up 7.3 percent from the same period last week and 0.2
percent more than a year earlier, according to the U.S.
Department of Agriculture. Wholesale-pork  prices  rallied 0.4
percent yesterday to $1.0431 a pound and are up 3.1 percent this
month, after dropping 8 percent in July, government data show.  “Packers seem to be willing to pay up for hogs and keep
prices firm, so that is a bullish sign,” Dick Quiter, an
account executive at McFarland Commodities LLC in Chicago, said
in a telephone interview. “Pork prices have stayed high. We’re
also seeing some increased demand for Labor Day.”  Hog futures for October settlement climbed 1.5 percent to
87.8 cents a pound at 9:21 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, after reaching 87.95 cents, the highest for a most-active contract since July 9.  Labor Day, on Sept. 2, tends to be the last holiday of the
year that is warm enough to barbecue outdoors, and is the third-most popular day for grilling in the U.S., according to the
Hearth, Patio and Barbecue Association.  Cattle futures for October delivery added 0.1 percent to
$1.2825 a pound in  Chicago , after reaching $1.287, the highest
for a most-active contract since March 13.  Feeder-cattle futures for September settlement advanced 0.1
percent to $1.57875 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
