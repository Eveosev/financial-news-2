The U.S. “strongly” condemns the
violent crackdown on protesters by  Egypt ’s military-backed
government and will keep up pressure for the country’s leaders
to begin a transition to democracy, a spokesman for President
 Barack Obama  said.  Egypt’s declaration of a state of emergency and the
storming of camps of protesters that left scores dead will
“only make it more difficult” to move toward reconciliation in
the country,  Josh Earnest , deputy press secretary, said. “The
violence that we saw overnight was a step in the wrong
direction.”  Obama was briefed this morning on the violence by his
national security adviser, Susan Rice, Earnest said on Martha’s
Vineyard, a Massachusetts island where the president is
vacationing.  The U.S. “will hold the interim government accountable for
the promises they made” to make the transition to democratic
governance, Earnest said. The U.S. still will decline to
designate the military takeover of the government as a coup, he
said.  Armed police broke up two sit-ins in Cairo where supporters
of former President Mohamed Mursi and his Muslim Brotherhood
were protesting his overthrow by the military. Officials said
almost 100 people were killed nationwide, while Islamist group
said the toll was many times higher.  Earnest said the U.S. continues to communicate with and put
pressure on the country’s leadership.  To contact the reporter on this story:
