World boxing champion Vitali Klitschko plans to run in Ukraine’s presidential race in 2015,
challenging the incumbent,  Viktor Yanukovych .  Klitschko, known as Dr. Ironfist, revealed his intention to
the president of the World Boxing Council, Jose Sulaiman, while
in  Mexico , according to a  statement  released today on the
organization’s website. The 42-year-old said he doesn’t plan to
retire from boxing.  “Vitali explains that he wants to keep participating in
politics and run for the presidency of his country, Ukraine, in
2015,” the council said in the statement. “And that boxing has
greatly helped prepare him for this.”  Klitschko joined politics last year, with his party winning
42 parliamentary seats in October elections. While striking an
alliance with two other opposition groups, the parties haven’t
picked a single candidate to stand against Yanukovych, promising
instead to support whichever makes it into a second round of
voting against the incumbent.  Klitschko had 15.9 percent backing for the 2015 election,
the most of any candidate, according to a May 21-30 survey of
2,030 eligible voters by the  International Institute of
Sociology , based in the capital, Kiev. His support has risen 7
percentage points from June 2012, the institute said.  Yanukovych had 14.3 percent backing, down 3 percentage
points, according to the statement. The survey had a margin of
error of 2 percentage points.  -- Editors: Andrew Langley, Paul Abelsky  To contact the reporter on this story:
