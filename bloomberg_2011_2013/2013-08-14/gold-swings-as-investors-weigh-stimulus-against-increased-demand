Gold rose for the fifth time in six
sessions as the dollar’s drop boosted demand for an alternative
investment. Speculation mounted that purchases will increase in
China, the world’s second-biggest consumer of the metal.  The Bloomberg  Dollar Index , a  gauge  against 10 major
currencies, fell for the first time in three days. The China
Gold Association said on Aug. 12 that purchases climbed 54
percent to 706.4 metric tons in the first half from a year
earlier. Demand surged 87 percent for bars and 44 percent for
jewelry demand.  “The weakness in the dollar is helping gold,”  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at Integrated Brokerage Services LLC in
 Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “The market sees
Chinese demand growing as the economy continues to improve.”  Gold futures for December delivery rose 1 percent to settle
at $1,333.40 an ounce at 1:41 p.m. on the Comex in  New York .
Trading was 35 percent below the average in the past 100 days
for this time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
price has climbed 4 percent since Aug. 6  Gold has fallen 20 percent this year. Some investors lost
faith in the commodity as a store of value amid low U.S.
inflation. This week,  India , the top buyer, raised the import
tax on the metal to contain a record current-account deficit.
Demand for bars and jewelry surged following the price slump.  Silver futures for September delivery rose 2.1 percent to
$21.787 an ounce on the Comex. The price advanced for the fifth
straight session, the longest rally since early March.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery added 0.4 percent to $1,505.20 an ounce.
Palladium futures for September delivery climbed 0.2 percent to
$740.35 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
