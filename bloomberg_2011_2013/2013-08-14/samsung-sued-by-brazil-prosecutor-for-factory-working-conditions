Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  was sued by
a  Brazil  public prosecutor who says workers at a company factory
were subject to unsafe conditions, according to a statement on a
government website.  The Public Prosecutor for Labour of the Amazon is suing
Samsung for 250 million reais ($108 million), according to a
ministry  website . Samsung’s plant in Manaus, northern Brazil,
employs about 6,000 people, according to the statement.  Employees in Manaus performed triple the amount of
movements considered safe under ergonomic studies, and some
worked 10 hours on their feet, according to the statement. Last
year, cases of tendinitis, bursitis and repetitive strain
injuries generated more than 2,000 sick leaves of as many as 15
days, according to the statement by the Public Prosecutor for
Labor of the Amazon. Legal action was taken Aug. 9 after three
government inspections and was signed by officials including
Labor Prosecutor General Luis Camargo.  Samsung will “conduct a thorough review and fully
cooperate with the Brazilian authorities” once it receives a
complaint, the Suwon, South Korea-based company said in an e-mailed statement.  “We take great care to provide a workplace environment
that assures the highest industry standards of health, safety,
and welfare for our employees across the world,” the company
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
