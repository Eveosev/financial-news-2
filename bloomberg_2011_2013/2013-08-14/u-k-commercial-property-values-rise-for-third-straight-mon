U.K. commercial real estate values
rose for the third straight month in July, led by office
buildings, Investment Property Databank Ltd. said.  The average value of stores, offices and warehouses climbed
0.2 percent from a month earlier, London-based IPD said in a
statement today. Total return, which combines changes in real
estate values and rental income, was 0.8 percent.  The commercial property market is improving as lenders
become more willing to provide credit to borrowers and Bank of
England governor Mark Carney said its record-low 0.5 percent
rate won’t rise unless the jobless figure falls to 7 percent.
Overseas buyers are also looking to buy property outside  London 
as the economy improves.  “Carney’s recent announcement regarding the Bank of
England’s future monetary policy should continue to encourage
investors in and towards commercial real estate,” Phil Tily, a
managing director at IPD, said in the statement. “Unless the
U.K. meets any of his ‘targets,’ then interest rates and bond
yields are going to remain low, and that means investors will
continue to look for good value add and income opportunities”
in real estate.  Rental growth slowed for office buildings in London and
retail properties there appreciated at a slower pace, IPD said.  Office building values had a 0.5 percent gain in July and
warehouses rose 0.4 percent, according to IPD. The average value
of retail properties was largely unchanged. Income-producing
commercial property prices fell for 17 consecutive months
through March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
