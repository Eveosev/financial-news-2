Most  German stocks  advanced, with
the benchmark  DAX (DAX)  Index trading near its highest level in 11
weeks, as a report showed Europe’s largest economy expanded at a
faster-than-expected pace in the second quarter.  Celesio AG (CLS1)  fell 2.6 percent after the pharmaceutical
wholesaler lowered its earnings estimate for 2013. Aixtron SE
dropped 1.9 percent as Cree Inc., which makes energy-efficient
lighting products, forecast fiscal first-quarter earnings that
fell short of analysts’ estimates.  The DAX lost 0.1 percent to 8,408.73 at 10:21 a.m. in
Frankfurt as two shares advanced for every one that retreated.
The equity benchmark has  rallied 9.3 percent  from its low on
June 24 as the  European Central Bank  said that  interest rates 
will remain low for an extended period of time. The broader HDAX
Index slipped less than 0.1 percent today.  German  gross domestic product  increased 0.7 percent in the
three months through June, the Federal Statistics Office said
today. Economists had predicted a gain of 0.6 percent, according
to the  median of 47 estimates  in a Bloomberg News survey.
Eurostat will report the change in GDP for the combined economy
of the euro area at 11 a.m. in Luxembourg.  The number of shares changing hands in DAX-listed companies
was 39 percent lower than the average of the past 100 days at
this time of the day, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
