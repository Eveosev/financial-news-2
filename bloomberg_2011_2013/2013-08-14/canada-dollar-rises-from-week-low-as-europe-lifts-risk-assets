The Canadian dollar gained from its
lowest level in almost a week after a report showed the euro
area’s economy emerged from a record-long recession, adding to
prospects for global growth and  Canada ’s commodity exports.  The currency rose for the first time in three days as data
showed Canadian home prices gained last month from the lowest
since 2009. The European report followed data last week that
showed increases in factory production, imports and exports in
July in China, the world’s second-biggest economy. Canada’s 10-year government bonds were little changed, with  yields  almost at
a two-year high, after a government auction of the securities.  “Commodity currencies in general are stronger today on
optimism about Europe,” Adam Button, a currency analyst at
forexlive.com, said by phone from  Montreal . “The Canadian
dollar is benefiting from better sentiment on growth.”  The loonie, as Canada’s currency is known for the image of
the waterfowl on the C$1 coin, gained as much as 0.2 percent to
C$1.0319 per U.S. dollar before trading little changed at
C$1.0342 at 5 p.m. in Toronto. It depreciated earlier to
C$1.0370, the weakest since Aug. 8. One Canadian dollar buys
96.69 U.S. cents.  The currencies of New Zealand and  Australia , which also
export commodities, gained versus most major counterparts,
including the loonie. The Aussie dollar rose 0.1 percent to
94.35 Canadian cents, and New Zealand’s dollar gained 0.8
percent to 83.04 Canadian cents.  Fed Bets  The advance by Canada’s currency was tempered by
speculation that as the economy improves the Federal Reserve
will reduce monetary stimulus designed to spur U.S. growth.  Fed policy makers will probably decide at their Sept. 17-18
meeting to start trimming the central bank’s $85 billion in
monthly bond purchases, according to 65 percent of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. The buying was designed to put downward
pressure on borrowing costs.  The Federal Open Market Committee’s first step may be
small, with monthly purchases tapered by $10 billion, according
to the median estimate in a survey of 48 economists conducted
Aug. 9-13. The Fed will end the buying by mid-2014, they said.
In a poll last month, half of economists predicted a Fed
reduction in bond buying at FOMC’s September meeting.  Futures on crude oil, Canada’s biggest export, dropped as
much as 1.2 percent to $105.60 a barrel in New York before
ending the day up 0.2 percent to $107.03.  The  yield  on Canada’s current 10-year bond was little
changed at 2.63 percent after the auction of C$2.8 billion ($2.7
billion) of 10-year debt. The yield touched 2.64 percent
earlier, the highest level since August 2011, after climbing
yesterday as much as 10 basis points, or 0.10 percentage point.  Bond Auction  The Bank of Canada sold securities due in June 2024 at an
average yield of 2.729 percent. The sale drew C$6.98 billion in
bids, for a 2.49 bid-to-cover ratio, a gauge of demand.  The auction was part of an effort to extend average debt
maturities that are the shortest in the Group of Seven nations.
Today’s offering was one of five 10-year auctions in a calendar
that was expanded in September with one extra sale. The central
bank also added a 30-year bond auction.  The share of 10-year bonds is projected to rise to almost
half of market debt over the next decade, from 37 percent now,
while 30-year bonds will make up 29 percent of outstanding debt,
from 19 percent now. Treasury bills as a portion of total market
debt are expected to fall to 23 percent by the end of the fiscal
year in March 2014, from 27 percent, according to the  federal
budget  released March 21.  The bid-to-cover ratio has averaged 2.41 at this year’s
Canadian 10-year bond auctions, including today’s. In 2012, it
was 2.38 times.  Canadian Homes  Canadian home-resale prices across 11 cities rose 1.9
percent in July from a year earlier, versus June’s 1.8 percent
rate, according to the Teranet-National Bank Composite House
Price Index.  The 17-nation euro area’s  gross domestic product  rose 0.3
percent in the April-June period after a 0.3 percent contraction
in the previous period, the European Union’s statistics office
in Luxembourg said, exceeding the median estimate of 0.2 percent
growth in a Bloomberg News survey.  “It seems like people are getting excited about Europe
getting out of recession, so you take the good news where it
comes,” Don Mikolich, executive director of foreign-exchange
sales at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said by telephone
from Toronto.  China ’s exports rose 5.1 percent in July from a year
earlier, while imports gained 10.9 percent, the government
reported last week. Factory production increased 9.7 percent
from a year earlier.  ‘Better Data’  “It’s been a parade of better data on China in the past
two weeks, and it came right after a period where the market
grew very concerned about China,” Button said.  The Canadian dollar fell 2.2 percent in the past three
months against nine other developed-nation currencies tracked by
the Bloomberg Correlation Weighted Index. The U.S. dollar
declined 0.2 percent, and New Zealand’s dollar lost 3 percent.
Australia’s dollar was the biggest loser, dropping 8.8 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
