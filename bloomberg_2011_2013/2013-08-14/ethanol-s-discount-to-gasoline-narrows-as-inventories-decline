Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
contracted after the Energy Information Administration said
inventories tumbled to a five-week low.  The spread narrowed 3.5 cents to 76.75 cents a gallon at
noon  New York  time following the EIA report, which said  supplies 
fell 1.7 percent to 16.4 million barrels last week, the lowest
level since July 5. An Agriculture Department report on Aug. 12
estimated corn stockpiles will be 27 percent lower than a year
ago before this year’s harvest, tightening the availability of
the ethanol feedstock.  “Over the next five to six weeks, we expect a huge
reduction in stocks,” said  Terry Reilly , senior commodity
analyst at Futures International LLC in Chicago.  Denatured ethanol for September delivery rose 5.8 cents, or
2.7 percent, to $2.198 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Futures have gained 0.4 percent this year.  Gasoline for September delivery added 2.3 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $2.9655 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up 94 percent of the total
U.S. gasoline pool in the week ended Aug. 9, up from 90 percent
the previous period, the EIA, the Energy Department’s
statistical arm, said.  Production rose 0.5 percent to 857,000 barrels a day, the
highest level since July 12.  Reilly said he expects ethanol plants to shut for scheduled
maintenance over the next month as corn becomes more difficult
to procure.  Corn for September delivery rose 10 cents, or 2.2 percent,
to $4.6525 a bushel in  Chicago . The more actively traded
December contract gained 5.5 cents to $4.5275.  The corn crush spread, or the cost difference between a
gallon of ethanol and the corn needed to make it, based on
September contracts, was 51 cents, up from 48 cents yesterday,
