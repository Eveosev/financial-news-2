Brazil ’s swap rates fell for the
first time in three days as lower-than-forecast retail sales
spurred speculation that policy makers will refrain from
quickening the pace of borrowing-cost increases.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2015 fell two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 9.86 percent at 10:13
a.m. in Sao Paulo. They jumped 16 basis points yesterday, the
most since Aug. 1. The real appreciated 0.3 percent to 2.3064
per dollar.  Retail sales rose 0.5 percent in June from the prior month,
less than the 0.6 percent median estimate of 31 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales rose 1.7 percent from a year
earlier, trailing the median estimate of 2 percent. The real’s
rebound from the lowest level since March 2009 tempered concern
that a weaker currency will fuel inflation.  “The economy will be practically stopped in the second
half of the year,” Carlos Kawall, the chief economist at Banco
J. Safra, said by phone from Sao Paulo.  Policy makers have embarked on the biggest series of
borrowing-cost increases among Group of 20 nations to curb
inflation. The central bank raised the target rate by a half-percentage point on July 10 to 8.50 percent, bringing it up 1.25
points from a record-low 7.25 percent in April.  To contact the reporters on this story:
