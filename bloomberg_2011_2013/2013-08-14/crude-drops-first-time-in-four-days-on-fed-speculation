West Texas Intermediate crude was
little changed as U.S. crude inventories dropped more than
expected and economists forecast that the Federal Reserve will
reduce stimulus measures.  Prices rose 2 cents. Supplies decreased 2.81 million
barrels last week, the Energy Information Administration said,
more than the 1.5 million estimated in a Bloomberg survey of
analysts. Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke may trim $85 billion in
monthly bond purchases at a September meeting of policy makers,
65 percent of economists in a separate Bloomberg survey said.  “The EIA report is supportive for prices because the drop
is bigger than expected,” said Jason Schenker, president of
Prestige Economics LLC, an Austin, Texas-based energy
consultant. “Oil prices came under pressure ahead of the Fed
meeting. Market participants may have exacerbated concerns
regarding the Fed tapering.”  WTI for September delivery settled at $106.85 a barrel on
the  New York  Mercantile Exchange. The volume of all futures
traded was 4.2 percent above the 100-day average at 4:27 p.m.
and open interest reached a record high yesterday. Futures were
at $106.36 before the report was released at 10:30 a.m. in
 Washington .  Brent for September settlement gained 38 cents, or 0.3
percent, to end the session at $110.20 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. Volume was 3.3 percent below
the 100-day average. WTI’s discount to Brent grew to $3.35, the
widest level since July 30.  U.S. Supplies  Crude stockpiles fell 0.8 percent to 360.5 million barrels
last week, the least since January, the EIA, the Energy
Department’s statistical arm, said.  Stocks at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for WTI
futures traded on the Nymex, declined for a sixth week to 38.5
million, the fewest since March 2012.  Supplies at the hub have been decreasing as improved
pipeline networks and the use of rail links ease a supply glut
created by rising production of crude from shale formations.
Domestic  production  increased to 7.57 million barrels a day last
week, the most since 1989.  “The drop in inventories is helpful for the market,” said
Bill O’Grady, chief market strategist at Confluence Investment
Management in St. Louis, which oversees $1.4 billion. “The
market has a bullish tone.”  Fed Tapering  The Fed’s first step may be small, with monthly purchases
tapered by $10 billion to a $75 billion pace, according to the
median estimate in a survey of 48 economists conducted Aug.
9-13. The Fed will end the buying by mid-2014, they said. In a
survey last month, half of economists predicted a Fed reduction
at policy makers’ next scheduled meeting Sept. 17-18.  “The oil market started to pull back because people are
anticipating Fed tapering,” said Phil Flynn, senior market
analyst at the Price Futures Group in  Chicago .  WTI fell as much as 1.2 percent in intraday trading as the
EIA report also showed crude use at U.S. refineries dropped to
the lowest level since June and petroleum consumption decreased.  U.S. refineries  processed  15.6 million barrels a day of
crude last week, the fewest since June 14. The refinery
utilization  rate  slid to 89.4 percent, down 1.5 percentage
points from the prior week. The rate had been above 90 percent
since June 14.  “We need the runs to get back above 90 percent for the
market to hold up,” O’Grady said.  Fuel Use  U.S. total petroleum  demand  fell 3 percent to 19.1 million
barrels a day last week, the lowest level since June 21, the EIA
said. Gasoline consumption decreased for the first time in four
weeks to 9.19 million barrels a day.  Libya’s Waha Oil Co. halted almost all of its 340,000
barrels of daily production as storage tanks reached full
capacity amid port closures, Abdel Hakim Al Hansheer, a Waha Oil
official, said at a press conference today in Tripoli. Fields
operated by Waha stopped at the end of last week as sit-ins by
guards seeking better conditions crippled the nation’s export
facilities, he said.  Libya, holder of  Africa ’s biggest reserves, is now
producing about 650,000 barrels a day, less than half the level
pumped before the 2011 uprising against Muammar Qaddafi, Oil
Minister Abdulbari Al-Arusi said yesterday.  Brent may surge to $120 if Libya’s production “does not
promptly bounce back above” 1 million barrels a day,  Francisco Blanch , head of commodities research at Bank of America Corp.,
said in a report.  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
October was 21.7 percent, little changed from yesterday, data
compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 592,309
contracts as of 4:27 p.m. It totaled 646,096 contracts
yesterday, 0.5 percent below the three-month average. Open
interest was a record 1.93 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
