Metro Inc. (MRU) ,  Canada ’s third largest
grocery chain, fell the most in more than three years after
reporting the worst same-store sales drop in a decade in its
third quarter earnings.  Metro fell 3.7 percent at C$69.30 at the close in Toronto,
the biggest one-day decline since May 20, 2010. Shares in the
Montreal-based company have risen risen 9.4 percent this year.  Metro’s 0.9 percent same-store sales drop was the most in
10 years, according to Bloomberg Industries. The food retailer
posted adjusted per-share profit of C$1.55 ($1.50), beating the
C$1.54  average  of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue fell
0.7 percent to C$3.57 billion, below analysts’ estimates of
C$3.64 billion.  Metro said it will provide pharmacies to the majority of
 Quebec ’s 25 Target locations, scheduled to open starting in
fall. The partnership will open 18 new pharmacies under its
Brunet banner in Target locations, with 12 of those locations in
the Greater Montreal area, by the end of summer 2014, Eric R. La Fleche, Metro’s chief executive officer said today in a
statement.  “The agreement with Target provides an excellent growth
opportunity for Metro’s pharmaceutical division, particularly
the Brunet banner, as it enables us to significantly increase
our presence, our purchasing power and our sales potential in
Quebec,” La Fleche said.  Metro also said it expects to take a C$40 million charge in
the next quarter to reorganize about 15 Ontario stores.  “We are convinced that these investments in our network,
combined with our merchandising programs will allow us to
continue to grow despite increased competition,”  La Fleche
said in the company’s earnings statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
