Rentokil Initial Plc (RTO) , a U.K.
services company, reported an increase in profit and revenue for
the first half as growth accelerated in the second quarter and
business outside Europe picked up.  The company, which offers pest control and hygiene
services, posted a 5.2 percent increase in adjusted operating
profit to 113 million pounds ($175 million). Sales gained 3.7
percent to 1.2 billion pounds, the company said in a statement.  “Conditions in continental Europe continue to be
challenging” but business in other regions, particularly China,
India and  Vietnam  had “notably strong performances,” the West
Sussex, England-based company said. Profit in Asia rose 43.5
percent.  The disposal of City Link, a loss-making parcel delivery
service, resulted in a 39 million-pound one-off loss in the
second quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
