(Corrects quote attributed to CFO in third paragraph.)  Biosev SA (BSEV3) , Brazil’s second-biggest
sugar-cane processor, cut its harvest forecast by as much as 13
percent after freezing weather and a drought hurt output and
stymied efforts to plant new crops.  Biosev reduced its projections to as low as 28.7 million
metric tons of cane for this season from 33 million tons after
frost last month burned the growing stalk tips, Serge Stepanov,
chief financial officer of the Sao Paulo-based company, said
today in an interview.  Biosev is seeking to increase the renewal rate at cane
fields to boost processing at mills that were running at 74
percent of capacity last year, he said. The worst frost in 12
years in  Brazil ’s center-west Mato Grosso do Sul state has
hampered the growth of seedlings it’s cultivating for planting
new stalks later.  The ice “stops the seedlings’ growth so there are less
available to put into planting during the rest of the year,”
said Stepanov.  The company can crush 37.9 million tons of cane a year and
expects its mills to be running at full capacity by the 2016-17
harvest, he said.  The worst drought in half a century in Brazil’s northeast
region is also affecting output from two mills it owns there,
which will account for about a third of the lower production
forecast, he said.  Closely held Raizen Energia SA is Brazil’s biggest crusher
of sugar cane.  To contact the reporter on this story:
