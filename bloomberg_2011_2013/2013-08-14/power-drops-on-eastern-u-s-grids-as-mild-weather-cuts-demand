Spot wholesale electricity from
 Boston  to  Washington  slid on the 10th anniversary of a blackout
in the eastern U.S. and  Canada  that left 50 million people
without power, as unusually mild weather reduced the need to run
air conditioners.  Prices headed lower for a third day on the PJM
Interconnection LLC network, the largest U.S. grid, as the
forecasts for the lowest daily peak demand in two months. Usage
also slumped on the two Northeast grids.  Spot power at benchmark hubs in the Eastern U.S. are
hovering near record lows for this time of the year because of
limited cooling demand. The blackout in 2003 started in the
Midwest and left cities from  Detroit  to Toronto to New York  in
the dark.   “Today is the opposite of that, we don’t have nearly the
same load,” said Ray DePillo, vice president of power
operations and asset management at Public Service Enterprise
Group Inc.’s energy resources and trading division in  Newark ,
New Jersey.  “The cause of the blackout was heavy loads across the
transmission system causing a line to sag to touch a tree and
causing a cascading effect across the system,” he said. “You
have no chance of anything like that happening today.”  PJM Hub  Prices at PJM’s Western hub, which includes deliveries to
Washington, dropped $22.14, or 43 percent, to $29.16 a megawatt-hour during the hour ended at 3 p.m. from the same time
yesterday, grid data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  The  spot on-peak average , which covers Monday through
Friday from 7 a.m. until 11 p.m., was down 34 percent from
yesterday’s full-day average at $28.90, the third straight
decline in the longest such streak since April 25.  PJM has been cutting its daily demand forecast throughout
the day on the 13-state grid, which serves more than 60 million
people from New Jersey to North Carolina and  Illinois . Power
consumption will reach 99,306 megawatts today, the lowest hourly
peak for any weekday since June 14. Demand yesterday peaked at
117,910 megawatts.  The high temperature in Washington today may be 78 degrees
Fahrenheit (26 Celsius), 9 below normal, while  Manhattan ’s
reading may be 7 lower than the average at 76 degrees, according
to AccuWeather Inc. in State College,  Pennsylvania .  New York  New York City power dropped for a fourth day, the longest
streak of losses since July 12. Spot prices dropped $12.44, or
35 percent, to $22.92 a megawatt-hour during the hour ended at 3
p.m. Boston prices fell for the third time in four days, sliding
$3.69, or 13 percent, to $25.42.  The average price for on-peak power for New York traded at
a discount of $1.40 a megawatt-hour versus Boston, compared with
a premium of $4.19 yesterday.  Spot prices in  Dallas  dropped as demand on the state’s main
grid operated by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas Inc.
slid below the day-ahead forecast. Ercot’s North hub fell $3.92,
or 9.1 percent, to $38.94 a megawatt-hour during the hour ended
at 2 p.m. local time from a day earlier.  The high temperature in Dallas today will be 5 below normal
at 92 degrees after rising to 100 degrees or higher for 14
consecutive days, AccuWeather data show.  California power fell as consumption started to more
closely track forecasts after exceeding the day-ahead outlook by
as much as 5.8 percent earlier, according to the grid operator’s
website.  Demand  on the state grid was 34,777 megawatts during
the hour ended at 12:45 p.m. local time, 2.8 percent higher than
the forecast 33,827 megawatts for the hour.  Spot prices at Southern California’s SP15 hub, which
includes Los Angeles and San Diego, fell $13.78, or 27 percent,
to $37.39 a megawatt-hour during the hour ended at noon while
the NP15 hub, which includes San Francisco, slid $10.69, or 23
percent, to $35.99.  On-peak power at SP15 is trading at an average  premium  of
65 cents to NP15 versus a discount of 8 cents yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
