Paulson & Co. raised its offer for
 Steinway Musical Instruments Inc. (LVB)  after the 160-year-old piano
maker got a competing bid from South Korea’s Samick Musical
Instruments Co., said three people familiar with the process.  Samick bid $39 a share for Waltham, Massachusetts-based
Steinway, prompting hedge-fund firm Paulson to go to $40, or
about $512 million, according to one person, who asked not to be
named because the deliberations were private. Steinway, which
had previously agreed to be taken over by Kohlberg & Co.,
announced today that it would accept the Paulson bid.  Kohlberg withdrew its $35-a-share offer this week after
Steinway, led by Chief Executive Officer Michael Sweeney,
announced that another investment firm had made a bid at $38.
That firm was later identified as Paulson & Co., run by
billionaire  John Paulson .  A representative at Samick didn’t immediately return a call
outside regular business hours. Officials at Paulson and
Steinway didn’t immediately reply to requests for comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
