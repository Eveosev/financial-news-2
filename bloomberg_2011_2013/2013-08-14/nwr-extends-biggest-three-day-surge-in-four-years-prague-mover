New World Resources Plc (NWR)  extended its
biggest rally in four years on mounting speculation a recovery
in coal prices and planned asset sales will shore up the
unprofitable Czech company’s finances.  The stock jumped 17 percent to 25.80 koruna by 11:18 a.m.
in Prague, taking its three-day gain to 49 percent, the biggest
for the period since May 2009 and paring its slump this year to
73 percent. Yields on NWR’s January 2021 notes priced in euros
slid 156 basis points, or 1.56 percentage points, to a seven-week low of 28.44 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Basic materials companies rose the most among the MSCI
World Index’s 10 industry groups since Moody’s Investors Service
raised its outlook for the U.S. coal industry to stable from
negative on August 8. NWR’s OKK coking unit “may be
interesting,” Poland’s Jastrzebska Spolka Weglowa SA said Aug.
12 after analyzing the Czech miner’s assets put up for sale.  “A disposal of OKK would be a positive for bondholders as
it would close somewhat the funding gap,” Andrzej Knigawka, an
analyst at ING Groep NV’s unit in Warsaw, said in e-mailed
comments today. NWR shares have also been boosted by the fact
that “the stock was massively oversold,” Knigawka said.  The 14-day relative strength index for the stock remained
below 30, a level that signals to some technical analysts a
security may be due for rebound, during April, May and June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
