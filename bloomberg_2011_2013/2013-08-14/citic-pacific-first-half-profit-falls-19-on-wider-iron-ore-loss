Citic Pacific Ltd. (267) , building the
world’s largest magnetite mine, said first-half profit dropped
19 percent as losses from its iron ore unit widened.  Net income was HK$4.46 billion ($575 million) in the six
months ended June 30, compared with HK$5.48 billion a year
earlier, the Hong Kong-based company said today in a statement.
Sales decreased 14 percent to HK$41.3 billion.  “The sharp decline in profit from continuing business
activities was mainly due to our iron ore mine in Australia,”
Chairman Chang Zhenming said in the statement. “Our focus for
the next six months will be to ensure the stable running of
production line one, ramping it up to full capacity as soon as
possible, as well as getting the second production line ready
for load commissioning.”  The company has recommenced load commissioning of line one
in late July at its Sino Iron project in  Australia , Citic
Pacific said. Iron ore concentrate produced to date has been
stockpiled near the port and the first shipment will be arranged
once it has permission, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
