Grupo BTG Pactual (BBTG11) , the investment
bank controlled by billionaire  Andre Esteves , is seeking $1.5
billion (3.47 billion reais) for its next private-equity fund
that will purchase stakes in Brazilian companies, according to
two people familiar with the matter.  BTG Pactual  Brazil  Investment Fund II is seeking almost as
much as the $1.6 billion gathered by the firm’s debut Brazilian
private-equity fund in 2011. Half of the $1.5 billion will come
from the bank, partners and employees, according to another
person briefed on the matter who asked not to be identified
because the fund is private.  The new fund would be one of the largest pools of capital
focused on the asset class in Brazil. JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s
Gavea Investimentos Ltda. also plans to target $1.5 billion for
its next fund that will buy stakes in Brazilian companies, two
people familiar with that firm said in June.  BTG, based in  Sao Paulo , is entering a challenging capital-raising market, as commitments raised by Brazil-focused private-equity funds fell 35 percent to $758 million in the first half
from the same period in 2012, according to data from the
 Emerging Markets  Private Equity Association.  Leandro Buarque, a spokesman for BTG, declined to comment
on the fundraising plans.  Lower Forecasts  BTG’s private-equity arm seeks to buy companies that have
growth potential in an expanding economy. Brazil has experienced
higher inflation and slower growth in recent years, expanding by
0.9 percent in 2012, down from 2.7 percent in 2011 and 7.5
percent in 2010. Economists covering Brazil cut their growth
forecasts for 2013 and 2014 to 2.21 and 2.5 percent,
respectively, according to an Aug. 9 central bank survey of
about 100 analysts published this week.  The investment bank is cutting bonuses as revenue falls
amid the slowest market for mergers and acquisitions in six
years. BTG’s revenue declined 17 percent in the first half to
2.7 billion reais ($1.17 billion).  The firm’s first fund, BTG Pactual Brazil Investment Fund
I, included $200 million from partners and employees and $500
million from Banco BTG.  Investments include furniture and clothing retailer Leader
Participacoes SA; CCRR, a maker of adhesives, labels and
specialty paper; drugstore chain Brazil Pharma SA; and physical-fitness chain Bodytech.  To contact the reporter on this story:
