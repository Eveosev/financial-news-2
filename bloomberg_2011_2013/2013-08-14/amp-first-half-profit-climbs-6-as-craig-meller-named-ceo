AMP Ltd. (AMP) ,  Australia ’s largest life
insurer and pension manager, said first-half profit rose 6
percent on higher wealth management earnings and named the head
of its biggest arm Craig Meller as chief executive officer.  Meller, 50, takes over on Jan. 1, replacing Craig Dunn, 49,
who retires after six years as CEO and 13 years in the company.
Net income rose to A$393 million ($359 million) in the six
months to June 30 from a restated A$373 million in the year
earlier period, the Sydney-based company said in a statement
today. That compares with the A$322 million median estimate of
five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Underlying profit, which removes merger-related costs and
some of the influence of market volatility, fell 10 percent to
A$440 million. Rising insurance policy lapses led AMP to warn on
June 24 underlying profit might drop to A$415 million to A$435
million. Such lapses had climbed to their highest level in a
decade, it said in February.  “Improving the performance of the insurance business is an
area of critical focus as we introduce a series of actions to
improve both customer retention and the management of claims,”
Dunn said in the statement today.  AMP, which is the worst performing stock in the S&P/ASX200
financial sector index, has dropped 5.6 percent this year
compared to a 11 percent gain for the index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
