All America Latina Logistica SA (ALLL3) ,
Latin America’s largest railroad operator, surged the most in
four years after Cosan SA Industria & Comercio ended plans to
buy a 5.67 percent stake in the company.  The shares gained 9.7 percent to 9.63 reais at 3:07 p.m. in
 Sao Paulo . A close at that level would be the biggest advance
since May 2009. Trading volume was 4.1 times the three-month
daily average. The stock was the second-best  performer  on the
benchmark Ibovespa, which rose 0.9 percent.  Talks to acquire a stake in All “ended without the
transaction coming to fruition,” Cosan said in a statement
today. Cosan, which controls the world’s biggest sugar-cane
processor with Royal Dutch Shell Plc, had agreed in February
2012 to buy 39 million shares of the Curitiba, Brazil-based
railroad operator.  Sao Paulo-based Cosan’s shares fell 2 percent to 40.77
reais, poised for the lowest close since December. All has
gained 16 percent this year, compared with a 16 percent drop in
the Ibovespa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
