Canadian  stocks  fell for the first
time in three days, retreating from a two-week high, as
retailers including  Rona Inc. (RON)  retreated on weaker-than-estimated
results.  Rona dropped 3.7 percent as earnings fell short of
projections. Metro Inc. fell the most since May 2010 after
announcing it will take a C$40 million ($39 million) charge to
reorganize its Ontario store network and that sales fell short
of estimates. First Majestic Silver Corp. and Silvercorp Metals
Inc. rallied at least 7.6 percent to lead raw-materials
producers higher as the metal advanced for a fifth day.  Three stocks fell for every two that rose as the  Standard &
Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  slipped 2.89 points, or less than 0.1
percent, to 12,639.30 at 4 p.m. in Toronto. The index swung as
high as 0.2 percent and as low as 0.2 percent.  “The Canadian economy is growing marginally slower than
the U.S., so companies missing estimates is to be expected,”
said Anish Chopra, a fund manager with TD Asset Management Inc.
in Toronto. The firm manages C$216 billion. “When you look at
precious metals, for both gold and silver the pricing has come
down significantly so there are people who think there’s value
at these levels.”  Economists estimate Canadian gross domestic grew 1.6
percent in the second quarter, according to a Bloomberg survey.
The U.S economy expanded by 1.7 percent in that period.  Eight of 10 main industries in the  gauge  fell, with
consumer staples stocks dropping 1.4 percent. Materials
producers added 2.3 percent as a group.  Metro Sales  Metro (MRU)  declined 3.7 percent to C$69.30, the lowest since
July 5. Canada’s third largest grocery chain reported a 0.9
percent drop in same-store sales last quarter, the worst result
in at least 10 years, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
figure measures performance at locations open for at least a
year. Metro reported sales of C$3.57 billion in the period,
compared with analysts’ estimates for C$3.64 billion.  Rona dropped 3.7 percent to C$10.84. The country’s largest
home-improvement store chain posted second-quarter adjusted
earnings of 28 Canadian cents, short of the 33 cents estimated
by analysts.  Same-store sales fell 1 percent in the quarter, affected by
poor weather, a June strike in the Quebec construction industry
and falling housing starts across the country, Rona said in a
statement.  Silvercorp Metals soared 7.6 percent to C$3.84, highest in
four months, and First Majestic jumped 9.3 percent to C$14.85.
Silver rallied for a fifth straight day, advancing 12 percent in
that time. The metal remains 28 percent lower in 2013.  Gold Rally  Kinross Gold Corp. added 6.5 percent to C$5.94 and Iamgold
Corp. rose 6.9 percent to C$6.01 as the price of gold increased
for the fifth time in six sessions. The metal had fallen 21
percent this year through yesterday.  Teck Resources Ltd. gained 2.7 percent to C$28.42, the
highest since May, as copper traded near a nine-week high.  Bankers Petroleum Ltd. (BNK)  climbed 3 percent to C$3.14. Oil
revenue surged 34 percent to $131.8 million as production rose
to 17,866 barrels a day in the second quarter, compared with
14,161 barrels a year ago.  Bankers said it will ramp up spending on surface facilities
in the second half of the year, including the potential
acquisition of a sixth drilling rig that should allow the
company to reach the “high-end of our annual guidance,” Chief
Executive Officer David French said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
