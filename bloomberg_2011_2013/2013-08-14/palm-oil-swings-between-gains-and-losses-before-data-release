Palm swung between gains and losses
as investors awaited release of data, which may show Malaysia
boosted production as the country’s currency weakened, making
the tropical oil cheaper for importers.  The contract for October delivery rose and fell at least
0.5 percent and traded at 2,295 ringgit ($702) a metric ton on
the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives at 12:07 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur.
Futures closed 2.5 percent higher yesterday, the biggest gain
since Jan. 2. Palm oil for local physical delivery in August was
at 2,340 ringgit yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Output expanded 10 percent to 1.56 million tons in July
from a month earlier, while exports gained 2.7 percent to 1.45
million tons, according to a Bloomberg survey. The Malaysian
Palm Oil Board is scheduled to release the data at 12:30 p.m.  “The market is quite uncertain,” Chandran Sinnasamy, head
of trading at LT International Futures Sdn., said by phone from
Kuala Lumpur. “July end-stocks may be higher due to the
unexpected rise in production.”  Reserves were 1.65 million tons, matching those in June,
the least since March 2011, the survey published Aug. 6 showed.  Prices are supported by the weaker ringgit which has made
palm cheaper for foreign buyers, said Chandran. The Malaysian
currency declined against the dollar to a three-year low today.  Soybean oil for delivery in December fell 0.2 percent to
42.86 cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybeans for
November lost 0.3 percent to $12.2375 a bushel.  Refined palm oil for January delivery declined 0.3 percent
to 5,554  yuan  ($908) a ton on the Dalian Commodity Exchange.
Soybean oil retreated 0.5 percent to 7,112 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
