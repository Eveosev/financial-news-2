Northern Ireland  beat Russia 1-0 in
a qualifying match for next year’s soccer  World Cup  to end a 13-game winless run.  Martin Paterson’s header at the end of the first half in
Belfast last night gave Northern Ireland its first victory since
August 2011, when it beat Faroe Islands in qualifying for last
year’s European Championship.  The win lifted Northern Ireland into fourth place in its
six-team qualifying group with six points. Russia remains two
points behind Group F leader Portugal, which has 14 points
through seven of 10 matches. The Russians have played six games.  The winners of each of the nine European groups advance to
the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, with the best eight runners-up
going into playoffs for the remaining four slots.  Last night’s match, the only World Cup qualifier to be
played yesterday, was originally scheduled for March 22, though
was postponed by snow in Belfast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
