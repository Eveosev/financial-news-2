Austria’s economy gained pace in the
second quarter as exports expanded more dynamically, the
government-backed Wifo economic research institute said.  Gross domestic product  expanded by 0.2 percent in the three
months through June after climbing a revised 0.1 percent in the
first quarter, Vienna-based Wifo said today in an e-mailed
statement today. That beats the median estimate of a 0.1 percent
increase in a Bloomberg News survey of five economists. Exports
increased by 0.3 percent in the period and provided the most
momentum to the economy, it said.  Compared with the second quarter of last year, the economy
0.3 percent if adjusted for inflation, according to the
institute. In June, Wifo cut its outlook for Austrian growth
this year to 0.4 percent, saying the persistent weakness of the
euro area would hit the Alpine republic’s exports and
investments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
