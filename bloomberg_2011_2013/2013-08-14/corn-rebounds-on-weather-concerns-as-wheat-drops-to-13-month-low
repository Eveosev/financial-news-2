Corn rebounded from a 35-month low
on speculation that Midwest rains will miss most of  Iowa , the
biggest U.S. grower, further limiting growth of a crop that was
planted later than normal. Soybeans and wheat also gained.  More than a third of the Midwest remains “notably dry,”
Bethesda, Maryland-based Commodity Weather Group LLC said in a
report. The forecaster reduced the chance of rain in Iowa, with
“plenty of dry spots” in central and southwest counties
hindering development. The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  on
Aug. 12 cut its harvest forecast for a third straight month.  “It’s been pretty dry in this particular area,”  Tomm Pfitzenmaier , a partner at Summit Commodity Brokerage in  Des
Moines , Iowa, said in a telephone interview. “We had seven-tenths of an inch, but that’s not even close” to being what’s
needed to increase soil moisture, he said.  Corn futures for December delivery gained 1.8 percent to
settle at $4.5525 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Prices are down 35 percent this year, mostly because the
USDA is predicting a 28 percent increase in production this year
to a record 13.763 billion bushels.  Soybean futures for November delivery rose 0.9 percent to
$12.39 a bushel in Chicago, the third straight increase. The
price has dropped 12 percent this year.  Wheat futures for December delivery gained 0.2 percent to
$6.4275 a bushel on the CBOT, after touching $6.355, the lowest
for a most-active contract since June 18, 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
