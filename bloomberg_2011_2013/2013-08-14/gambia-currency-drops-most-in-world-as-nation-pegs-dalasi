Gambia’s currency depreciated the
most against the dollar in the world after the West African
nation reinstated restrictions on foreign-exchange trading and
pegged the value of the dalasi.  The exchange rate of the country that’s bordered on three
sides by Senegal was set at 35 dalasi per dollar, President
Yahya Jammeh’s office said in a statement dated yesterday. The
government canceled trading licenses issued to foreign-exchange
bureaus by the  Central Bank  of Gambia and placed a prohibition
on exports of foreign currency to stabilize the dalasi.  “Shipments of foreign currency have to be done through
banks and with the approval of the Central Bank of The Gambia,”
according to the statement. Individuals leaving the country are
restricted to taking $9,000 in foreign currency, with security
forces instructed to confiscate anything above that amount.  The dalasi dropped 6.6 percent to 34.75 per dollar by 2:21
p.m. in Banjul, the capital, the worst among 175 currencies
tracked by Bloomberg. It’s depreciated 5.5 percent since July
15, when the government lifted earlier restrictions on foreign-currency trading and said it would allow the  exchange rate  to be
determined by the market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
