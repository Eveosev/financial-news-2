The campaign for Scottish
independence has “virtually no chance” of success, the
Scotsman reported, citing an interview with Nate Silver, the
statistician who gave Obama a 90 percent change of winning re-election.  The polling data was “pretty definitive” with those
opposed to independence at 60 percent to 55 percent of the
electorate and those in favor at about 40 percent and only a
“major crisis’ in  England  could help the Yes vote, the
Edinburgh-based newspaper quoted Silver as saying.  ‘‘Historically, in any Yes or No vote in a referendum, it’s
actually the No side that tends to grow over time, people tend
not to default to changing the status quo,” Silver told the
 Scotsman . He could not be immediately contacted by Bloomberg.  Silver, whose blog  FiveThirtyEight  will soon feature on
 Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s ESPN network after appearing on The  New York 
Times website for three years, was in Edinburgh to participate
in the city’s international book festival.  To contact the reporter on this story:
