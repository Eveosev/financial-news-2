Offshore Gulf Coast oils weakened
against the benchmark West Texas Intermediate after declines in
regional inventories and gross inputs at refineries.  Light Louisiana Sweet and other regional oils lost ground
to WTI after gross inputs in PADD 3  fell  by 256,000 barrels to
8.27 million barrels a day in the week ended Aug. 9, the U.S.
Energy Information Administration reported today. It was the
biggest drop since April 19. Crude stockpiles in the region fell
to the  lowest level  since February.  “It’s a combination of the (inventory) report, and we’re
also looking at throughputs falling,” said  Stephen Schork , the
president of Schork Group Inc. in Villanova,  Pennsylvania , by
phone today. “We’re over the hump on peak refinery demand for
the year.”  LLS fell by 55 cents a barrel to a premium of $5.10 to WTI
at 4:01 p.m. in New York, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium dropped 75 cents to
$4.45.  Poseidon fell 25 cents a barrel against WTI to a discount
of $1.25. Mars Blend was unchanged at an 85-cent-a-barrel
discount. Southern Green Canyon weakened by 15 cents to a
discount of $2 a barrel.  The premium for  Thunder Horse , which has a lower sulfur
content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon, gained 10
cents to $2.10 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
