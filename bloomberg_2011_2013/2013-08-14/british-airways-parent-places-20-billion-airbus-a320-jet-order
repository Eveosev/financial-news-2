British Airways parent  IAG SA (IAG) ’s plan
to purchase $20 billion worth of Airbus SAS short-haul planes
underscores Chief Executive Officer’s Willie Walsh’s drive to
end losses in  Spain  and back discount unit Vueling SA.  The accord for as many as 220 A320s, including the Neo
version with new engines due from 2015, includes 62 firm orders
for Vueling, London-based IAG said in a statement late
yesterday. The firm orders are valued at $5.4 billion at list
price, although airlines typically get steep discounts.  IAG, as International Consolidated Airlines Group SA is
known, is exiting unviable short-haul routes and cutting more
than 3,100 jobs at unprofitable Spanish arm Iberia in a bid to
achieve 1.6 billion euros ($2 billion) in operating profit in
2015. The company acquired full control of Vueling in April for
123.5 million euros, extending its efforts to secure a Spanish
turnaround by expanding the Barcelona-based no-frills unit.  “This order is the first indication of IAG’s intentions to
use Vueling as a direct lower-cost replacement for short haul
services currently provided by Iberia,” Donal O’Neill, a
Dublin-based analyst at  Goodbody Stockbrokers  who rates IAG
“buy,” said in a note. Vueling could even be used to replace
some of BA’s less-profitable short-haul routes at London Gatwick
airport, a secondary base to its Heathrow hub, he said.  IAG shares traded little changed at 314.10 pence as of 8:49
a.m. in London, valuing the airline at 5.82 billion pounds ($9
billion) following a 70 percent gain this year.  Merger Benefits  “Vueling has managed to successfully expand its business
profitably by targeting both growth markets and those areas
where weak competitors are reducing capacity,” IAG Chief
Executive Officer  Willie Walsh  said in the statement. The order
also highlights the benefits of consolidation, said Walsh, who
formed IAG from a merger of BA and Iberia in January, 2011.  Vueling, which had been looking at placing a single-aisle
order before its takeover, will get its planes between 2015 and
2020, replacing some of its 70 existing A320s while expanding
the overall fleet. The firm order is split between 30 classic
A320s and 32 Neos, with no engines selected so far.  The discount unit contributed 27 million euros to IAG’s
operating profit in the second quarter, a period when BA made
247 million euros and Madrid-based Iberia lost 35 million euros.  IAG’s decision in favor of Airbus, the incumbent short-haul
plane provider for Vueling and IAG, is a setback for  Bombardier
Inc. (BBD/B) , which was looking to sell its CSeries narrow-body to the
discount carrier. The Canadian manufacturer has struggled to win
orders against competition from Airbus and  Boeing Co. (BA) , whose 737
also failed to fin favor with IAG.  Fleet Plans  Europe ’s third-largest airline group is already adding new
long-haul planes such as the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350, as well
as the A380 superjumbo at British Airways, to cut costs by
replacing less fuel efficient jets.  Yesterday’s commitment includes options for 58 more Airbus
narrow-bodies for Vueling, with the additional 100 neo options
for possible use at British Airways, Iberia or Vueling.  IAG said the firm order for Vueling needs shareholder
approval later this year, when investors will also be asked to
back a previous deal to acquire additional 787s and A350s.  The airline, the first in the world to operate both the 787
and A380, will take a total of 12 superjumbos by 2016, plus 42
Dreamliners by 2021. The carrier will also take 18 Airbus
A350-1000 wide-bodies between 2017 and 2023, and is examining
Boeing’s re-engined 777X.  To contact the reporter on this story:
