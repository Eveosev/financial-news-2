Norway ’s OBX index of the  25 most-traded  stocks climbed to a record as the oil-heavy index
benefits from higher crude prices and as equity valuations of
companies in the AAA nation indicate further gains.  The Oslo stock exchange’s OBX rose as much as 0.7 percent
to 463.96, the  highest level  since Bloomberg began compiling
data in 1996, and was up 0.6 percent as of 1:07 p.m. in Oslo.
The index has risen 13 percent so far this year.  The gains “will continue because valuations are still
moderate and the reporting season for the second quarter was
OK,” Kristian Tunaal, a stock strategist at DNB ASA, said by
phone. Crude prices that have recovered to “quite comfortable
levels” will help boost the benchmark to 550 by the end of the
year, he said.  The  biggest gainer  in the index this year is struggling
solar company Renewable Energy Corp. ASA, which is up 190
percent, followed by Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA, which has gained
68 percent. DNB ASA, Norway’s largest bank, has risen 43
percent. The gains come even as Statoil ASA, the index’s biggest
member, has slid 7 percent this year.  A 13 percent recovery in the price of  Brent crude  from a
12-month low on April 18 has helped bolster the 12 oil-related
companies in the index.  The OBX is trading at 14.34 times  earnings  compared with a
price-to-earnings ratio of 17.97 for the FTSE 100 and 16.32 for
the  S&P 500 , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
