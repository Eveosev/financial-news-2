BC Partners  Ltd., a London-based
private equity firm, is preparing to sell shares in real estate
broker Foxtons Ltd. in August, a month earlier than initially
planned, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.  BC Partners may raise as much as 400 million pounds ($617
million) in the London initial public offering, said the people,
who asked not to be identified because the talks are private.  The private equity firm bought Foxtons, which was founded
by Jon Hunt in 1981, for about 390 million pounds in May 2007.
BC Partners hired  Credit Suisse Group AG, (CSGN)  Numis Securities Ltd.
and Canaccord Genuity Ltd. in June to arrange the IPO, which was
originally slated for September.  By holding its sale a month earlier, Foxtons will be
seeking money from investors before companies such as Royal Mail
Group Ltd. and Wizz Air Ltd., Eastern Europe’s largest budget
carrier, that are preparing September IPOs.  Officials at BC Partners declined to comment, and a
spokesman for Foxtons didn’t immediately respond to telephone
requests seeking comment. The news was reported earlier by
Financial News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
