President James Bullard, who has backed continued bond purchases
by the Fed, said it is important for the central bank to defend
its 2 percent inflation target to ensure its credibility as
price gains moderate.  “I have been concerned about low inflation,” Bullard, who
votes on monetary policy this year, said in a speech today in
Paducah,  Kentucky . “There hasn’t been much indication so far it
is moving back toward target.”  Bullard said inflation was one factor that should be
considered as the Fed decides whether to slow its bond-buying
program, along with the employment outlook and U.S. growth.  “The committee has set a target,” Bullard said. “Once
you set it, you need to have credibility to hit it. Whatever
target you set, you should deliver.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
