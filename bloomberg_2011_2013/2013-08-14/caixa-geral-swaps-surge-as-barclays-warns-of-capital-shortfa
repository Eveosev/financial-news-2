The cost of insuring against default
on the subordinated debt of Caixa Geral de Depositos SA surged
as Barclays Plc analysts said some Portuguese banks could fall
short of capital requirements in the next 18 months.  Credit-default swaps on Lisbon-based Caixa’s junior debt
jumped 93 basis points to a 10-month high of 681, according to
data provider CMA. Barclays recommended buying the contracts
because they are the least expensive among the nation’s banks
and trade at a low ratio compared to those on its senior debt,
which rose 42 basis points today to a nine-month high of 496.  Lenders face a 4.6 billion-euro ($6.1 billion) shortage of
the capital required by the Bank of  Portugal  as bad loans erode
capital buffers, Barclays analysts led by Jonathan Glionna wrote
in a note to investors. That could grow to 12.4 billion euros if
the economy deteriorates more than expected.  “Principal losses could be imposed on the subordinated
debt of these banks to return them to adequate capital positions
and these actions could trigger CDS contracts,” the analysts
wrote. “Shorting the banks via CDS is the best way to position
for upcoming developments in the Portuguese banking sector.”  Default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange for the
underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a borrower
fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
