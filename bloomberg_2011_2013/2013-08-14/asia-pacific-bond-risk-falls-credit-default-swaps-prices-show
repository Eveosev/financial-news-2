The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds from non-payment in the Asia-Pacific region
fell, according to credit-default swap traders.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index decreased 2 basis points
to 114 basis points as of 10:37 a.m. in Sydney, according to
National Australia Bank Ltd. prices. The benchmark is on track
to close at its lowest level since July 22, according to data
provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index declined 1 basis point to 91
as of 9:33 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices show. The
measure is headed for its lowest close since July 15, according
to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices
quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan fell 1 to 138 as of 8:37 a.m. in
 Singapore , Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. prices
show. The gauge, which is poised to decline for a fourth
straight day, has ranged from 99.5 to 177.8 this year, according
to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
