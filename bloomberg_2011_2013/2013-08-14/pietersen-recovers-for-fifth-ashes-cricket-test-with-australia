England  batsman  Kevin Pietersen  will
be available for next week’s fifth Ashes cricket Test against
Australia after passing a medical checkup on his knee.  Pietersen bruised a bone in his right knee in February and
had a precautionary scan today to monitor his recovery, the
England and Wales Cricket Board said today in an e-mailed
statement.  “Kevin remains available for selection for the fifth
Investec Ashes Test and will continue to receive treatment on
his right knee as part of his rehabilitation program over the
course of remainder of the series and beyond,” the ECB said.
The fifth and final Ashes Test begins Aug. 21 at the Oval in
London.  England beat Australia by 74 runs in the fourth Test to go
3-0 up in the best-of-five contest. That gives it three
consecutive Test series victories against  Australia  for the
first time since 1956. The home team had already retained the
Ashes by winning the first two matches, with the third ending in
a draw.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
