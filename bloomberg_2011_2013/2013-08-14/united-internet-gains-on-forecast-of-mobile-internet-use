United Internet AG (UTDI)  jumped to the
highest in almost 15 years after raising its customer forecast
for 2013 by 10 percent as the German online-access and domain
provider sold more mobile-Internet contracts in the first half.  United Internet rose as much as 6.8 percent and was trading
up 5.3 percent at 25.80 euros as of 2:23 p.m. in  Frankfurt , the
highest based on closing prices since at least October 1998.
Trading volume exceeded the three-month daily average by 41
percent. The stock has gained 58 percent this year, valuing the
company at 5 billion euros ($6.63 billion).  “We now expect a number of approximately 1.1 million new
contracts, which means 100,000 contracts more than previously
estimated,” Ralph Dommermuth, chief executive officer of United
Internet, said today in a statement. The first-half figure rose
22 percent from a year earlier to 330,000 new mobile-Internet
subscriptions. Including customers seeking website-hosting
services, new contracts in the first half totaled 660,000.  “It was positive that the company raised its forecast for
customer growth,” said Adrian Pehl, a Frankfurt-based analyst
at Equinet AG. Achieving the target “shouldn’t be a problem,
given the number reached in the first half.”  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization stood at 175 million euros in the first half. The
Montabaur-based company said it’s sticking to earnings
forecasts. United Internet  predicted  in May that Ebitda from
“established” businesses will amount to 500 million euros this
year.  De-Mail Demand  A joint project with phone operator  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  to
provide legally secure e-mail accounts within  Germany , called
De-Mail, received 280,000 contracts as of June 30 after winning
regulatory accreditation in March, United Internet said. The
company said it’s focusing on expanding its business-applications web-domain operations abroad.  “We see more growth in the medium term in applications due
to do-it-yourself, De-Mail and foreign hosting markets,” said
Pehl, who has a hold recommendation on the stock and who called
the full-year earnings target “ambitious.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
