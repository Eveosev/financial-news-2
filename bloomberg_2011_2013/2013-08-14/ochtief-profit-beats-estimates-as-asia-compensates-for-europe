Hochtief AG (HOT) ,  Germany ’s largest
construction company, reported second-quarter earnings which
beat analyst estimates as profit at the Asian and American units
compensated for losses in its home European market.  Pretax profit jumped to 328.2 million euros ($435 million)
from 164.8 million euros a year earlier, the Essen, Germany-based company said in a statement. The average forecast of eight
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was 157 million euros. Sales
increased 10.4 percent to 7.1 billion euros.  Chief Executive Officer Marcelino Fernandez Verdes is
focusing Hochtief, which is controlled by Spain’s Actividades de
Construccion & Servicios SA, on its main building business,
reversing a decade-long strategy of expanding into services.
Verdes, who joined from ACS, reached a 1.5 billion-euro deal to
sell the airports division and is also offloading property
development and facility management units. Hochtief Solutions
was sold to SPIE SA for about 250 million euros in June.  “We are well on course to implement our strategy and
position Hochtief as a global infrastructure group,” Fernandez
Verdes said in the statement. “To achieve this aim, various
measures were decided, which we are now implementing
systematically.”  Losses Narrowed  Pretax losses in  Europe  narrowed to 5.8 million euros from
71.6 million euros a year earlier, while profit in  Asia  and
 North America  jumped 45 percent to 299.9 million euros and more
than doubled to 21.8 million euros respectively.  Hochtief, which built Frankfurt’s Commerzbank Tower, is
midway through a 260 million-euro share buyback program which
will boost the  voting rights  held by Madrid-based ACS to 59.9
percent.  Hochtief predicts full-year pretax profit of 580 million
euros to 660 million euros, with net income at 160 million euros
to 200 million euros, excluding earnings from the airports,
service solutions and one-time reorganization costs, the company
said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
