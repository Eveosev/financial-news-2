JinkoSolar Holding Co. (JKS) , a Chinese
solar manufacturer, rose after it shipped 62 percent more panels
in the second quarter and raised annual estimates.  Jinko’s American depositary receipts climbed 4.9 percent to
$14.21 at the close in New York. Earlier the shares reached
$15.62, the highest intraday since Sept. 1, 2011. The Shangrao,
China-based company’s ADRs are each worth four ordinary shares.  The company shipped 489.2 megawatts of panels in the
quarter, up from 302.1 megawatts in the same period last year,
JinkoSolar said today in a statement. Sales rose 43 percent to
1.77 billion  yuan  ($288.4 million).  The company is benefiting as panel prices stabilize after
falling nearly  40 percent  during the past two years and their
oversupply wanes, Chen Kangping, chief executive officer, said
on a conference call with analysts today.  “We are now prepared to take full advantage of the more
favorable industry conditions,” Chen said. The company is
reducing its exposure to  Europe , where demand is falling, to
focus on fast-growing markets like  China , Japan and the U.S.,
Chen said.  Higher demand helped the company reach its first  profit 
since the third quarter of 2011, Chen said. JinkoSolar’s net
income was 49 million yuan in the quarter, up from a loss of
310.5 million yuan in the same period last year.  As a result, the company raised its shipment forecast to
1.5 to 1.7 gigawatts of panels for 2013, up from 1.2 to 1.5
gigawatts in June, and raised its annual production capacity to
1.5 gigawatts from the previous 1.2 gigawatts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
