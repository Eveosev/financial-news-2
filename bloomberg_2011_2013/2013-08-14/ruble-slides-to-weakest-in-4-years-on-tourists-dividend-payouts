The ruble declined for third day as
dividend payments on overseas-traded stock and a seasonal jump
in demand for foreign currency from Russian tourists exacerbated
a drop in global investor appetite for riskier assets.  The currency sank less than 0.1 percent to 37.9565 against
the euro-dollar basket by 6 p.m. in Moscow, after falling to
38.0714 earlier, the weakest since Aug. 17, 2009. The yield on
the government’s ruble bond due 2027 rose two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 7.73 percent, the highest in a week.  The peak of  Russia ’s summer vacation period coupled with $6
billion of dividend payments to holders of global depositary
receipts in August is hurting the Russian currency, according to
ING Groep NV and VTB Capital. JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s  index of
emerging-market currencies  sank 4.3 percent since May 22, when
U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the Fed could
scale back monthly bond purchases that helped fuel a rally in
emerging-market assets.  “The vacation period and expected dividend conversion by
the largest Russian companies is pressuring the ruble,” Dmitry Polevoy, economist at ING Groep NV in Moscow, said in an e-mailed note.  Dividend payments in August may reach $6 billion with $5
billion coming in the last week of the month, Ilya Piterskiy, a
VTB analyst, said in an e-mailed report yesterday.  “Only the beginning of the tax period may help the ruble
stabilize,” Polevoy said.  Brent Drops  The monthly tax period, which traditionally creates demand
for rubles from exporters, starts tomorrow with pension and
insurance payments. The volume of the transfers will be around
80 billion ($2.4 billion) to 100 billion rubles, with the total
tax payments in August possibly reaching as much as 530 billion
rubles, OAO Promsvyazbank analyst Alexei Egorov said in an e-mailed note.  “Of course, we can go even higher from here, but the tax
period starts tomorrow, sellers will come, and there will be a
reason to take profits,” Igor Akinshin, a foreign exchange
trader at OAO Alfa Bank in Moscow, said by phone.  The Russian currency has declined about 9 percent against
the dollar-euro basket since the beginning of 2012. That
compares with a 6.3 percent drop for JPMorgan’s emerging-market
currency index and a 3 percent increase for Brent oil.  Brent snapped three days of gains in  London  today, falling
0.4 percent to $109.36 a barrel. Crude is Russia’s main export
earner.  The ruble traded little changed against the dollar and euro
at 33.1000 and 43.8910.  To contact the reporter on this story:
