Jefferies Group LLC, the investment
bank owned by  Leucadia National Corp. (LUK) , hired Larry Portman as a
managing director for its consumer investment-banking unit,
according to a person with direct knowledge of the move.  Portman, 44, was a managing director and head of consumer
investment banking for the Americas at Rothschild, focusing on
the food and beverage industries, said the person, who asked not
to be identified because the move hasn’t been made public.
Before joining Rothschild in 2009, he was a managing director at
 Citigroup Inc. (C)  and  Morgan Stanley. (MS)   Jefferies, which was acquired this year by Leucadia,
boosted the number of its employees by 70 percent since the end
of 2006 to about 3,800. The firm has lured bankers and traders
from the world’s biggest investment banks, offering year-end
bonuses in immediately available cash. The New York-based
company said in June it hired James Nappo from Credit Suisse
Group AG as a managing director for industrial  investment
banking .  Portman, who has already started at Jefferies, is based in
New York and reports to Abid Rizvi, U.S. head of consumer
investment banking, according to the person. He isn’t replacing
anyone, the person said.  The consumer investment-banking group has about 26 bankers
in the U.S., Europe and Asia and has completed more than 100
capital markets and advisory transactions since 2012, according
to the company’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
