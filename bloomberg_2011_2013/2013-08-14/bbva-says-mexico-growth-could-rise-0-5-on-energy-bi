* Report says possibility “high” reform will pass congress
* The reform is “without a doubt, a significant advance” from
current  energy policy  in Mexico
* Opting for profit-sharing contracts over concessions “not
necessarily a disadvantage”
* High costs for producing oil that’s difficult to extract could
be a “serious obstacle” to reaching govt. goal of boosting
crude output to 3.0m bpd in 2018 and 3.5m bpd in 2025 * Analysts

profit-sharing contracts

decline
