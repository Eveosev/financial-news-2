T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS) , the fourth-largest
U.S. wireless carrier, raised $500 million in senior notes in
its first debt offering after merging with MetroPCS
Communications Inc.  The company issued through its T-Mobile USA unit 5.25
percent bonds due September 2018 to yield 378 basis points more
than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The securities are rated Ba3 by Moody’s Investors
Service, three levels below investment grade. Proceeds will be
used for general corporate purposes, the Bellevue, Washington
company said in a statement today.  T-Mobile,  controlled  by  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) , completed its
merger with pay-as-you-go carrier MetroPCS in May. The average
extra yield investors demand to hold the debt of speculative-grade telecommunications companies instead of similar-maturity
Treasuries is 427 basis points, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
index data show.  Deutsche Bank AG managed T-Mobile’s sale, Bloomberg data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
