South Africa ’s provincial teams
competing in the annual  Vodacom Cup  tournament will have to
field a minimum number of black players starting next year,
according to the South African Rugby Union.  “All 14 provincial teams will be required to pick a
minimum of seven black players in their matchday squads, two of
whom must be forwards,” Cape Town-based SARU said in a
 statement  today. “A minimum of five black players will be
required to start.”  The Vodacom Cup is South Africa’s third-largest rugby
tournament after Super Rugby and the Currie Cup. Young players
typically appear in the Vodacom Cup before being selected for
Super Rugby or the national squad, the Springboks. During
apartheid, the country’s rugby teams were almost uniformly
whites-only. Since then South African cricket and rugby teams
have been urged to promote black players with quotas introduced
in 1999 and then withdrawn again in 2004 amid controversy.  “The intended outcome is an increased pool of black talent
from which Currie Cup and Super Rugby coaches can select and, in
due course, more options for the Springbok coach,” Oregan Hoskins, president of SARU, said in the statement. No penalties
have been set up for teams that don’t meet the new criteria,
according to the governing body.  South Africa today announced the  Springbok squad  that will
take on  Argentina  in Soweto, southwest of Johannesburg, on Aug.
17. Three black players, including  Tendai “Beast” Mtawarira  in
the number 1 jersey, are in the starting lineup, with another
black player among the replacements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
