Goodman Group (GMG) , the world’s  second-biggest  industrial property manager by assets, reported a 17
percent increase in full-year operating profit as income from
its management and development businesses climbed.  Operating profit rose to A$544 million ($496 million) from
A$463.4 million a year ago, the Sydney-based company said in a
statement to the Australian stock exchange. That beat a median
forecast of $542 million in a Bloomberg News survey of 12
analysts.  Goodman, which partners with global pension and sovereign
wealth funds to invest in properties, is benefiting from growing
demand for logistics and industrial assets from both tenants and
investors. Rising freight costs and consumer expectations for
shorter delivery times are driving tenant demand for well-located logistics properties, while relatively high yields are
behind investor demand, broker Colliers International said in a
 report  last month.  “The quality of our operating earnings and the momentum
across our business position us well for FY2014,” Chief
Executive Officer Greg Goodman said in today’s statement. “We
are forecasting a full year operating profit of $594 million,
equating to an operating earnings per security of 34.3 cents, up
6% on FY13.”  Net income  in the year ended June 30 fell to A$161 million
from A$408.3 million 12 months earlier, the company said.  Goodman will pay a  dividend  of 19.4 cents for the year, up
8 percent from 12 months earlier, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
