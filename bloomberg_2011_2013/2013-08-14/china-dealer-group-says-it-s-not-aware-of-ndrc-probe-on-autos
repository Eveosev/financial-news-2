A  China  Automobile Dealers
Association official said he isn’t aware of any special
investigation into pricing practices in the car industry,
contradicting an earlier report that a probe was under way.  “As far as I know, NDRC monitors pricing for various
industries as part of its normal responsibilities and there has
been no specific anti-monopoly investigation targeting the auto
industry,” Luo Lei, deputy secretary-general of the industry
group, said in a phone interview today, referring to the
National Development and Reform Commission, China’s top economy
planning agency.  The dealers association routinely collects data on vehicle
pricing and supplied the findings to the NDRC, Luo said.  Reuters reported yesterday, citing Luo, that the NDRC was
investigating whether carmakers were setting a minimum retail
price for dealers in China and that the dealers association was
collecting data for the probe.  SAIC Motor Corp. rose 1.7 percent to 13.9  yuan  in  Shanghai 
today, compared with the 0.3 percent drop in the benchmark
Shanghai Composite Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
