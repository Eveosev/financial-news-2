Investors are becoming overly
content about the prospects for stocks after more than four
years of gains, according to David Bianco, chief U.S. equity
strategist at Deutsche Bank AG.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows how Bianco reached his
conclusion: by comparing the price-earnings ratio for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index with this quarter’s average close
for the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index. The
latter gauge, known as the VIX, is based on S&P 500 options.  Bianco’s P/E-VIX ratio closed yesterday at 1.20. At that
level, a lack of concern that share prices may fall starts to
supplant “realistic and disciplined” investing, he wrote in an
Aug. 9 report.  “This complacency signal may pertain more to the
derivatives market than the equity market,” he wrote. This
quarter’s closing VIX average as of yesterday was 13.59, just
above the first-quarter figure of 13.53. The latter reading was
the lowest since 2007, when a five-year bull market came to an
end, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  While stocks have room to extend their advance since March
2009, increased volatility is likely to accompany any further
gains, he wrote. This would allow stocks to rise relative to
earnings without sending another warning sign, the New York-based strategist wrote.  Bianco expects the index to end next year at 1,850, which
is 9.2 percent higher than yesterday’s close. His projection for
the end of this year is 1,675, in line with the average among 17
strategists in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
