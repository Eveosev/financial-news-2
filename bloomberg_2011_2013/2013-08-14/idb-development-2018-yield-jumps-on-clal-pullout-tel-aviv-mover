IDB Development Corp.’s 2018 bonds
plunged the most in more than two months after a Thai investor
withdrew an offer to purchase a stake in the debt-strapped
company’s insurance unit a week before a court deadline for
the sale.  The yield on IDB Development’s 1.35 billion shekels ($378
million) of 4.5 percent bonds due June 2018 soared 178 basis
points, the most since June 9 on a closing basis, to 20.85
percent at 1:58 p.m. in Tel Aviv. The shares of the unit,  Clal
Insurance Enterprise Holdings Ltd. (CLIS)  tumbled 5.1 percent, the most
since June 24, to 62.30 shekels.  IDB Development’s Chairman Nochi Dankner must find a buyer
for as much as 55 percent of the shares the company holds in
Clal after a Tel Aviv court set an Aug. 22 deadline for the
sale. The unidentified Thai investor pulled out, IDB
Development, who’s mired in debt-restructuring talks, said in a
statement to the Tel-Aviv bourse today. An unidentified Hong
Kong investor is still considering buying a stake in the Israeli
insurer, the company said.  “Dankner is fighting to the last moment to retain control
of the IDB group,” said Raz Mor, a corporate debt analyst at
Tel Aviv-based Meitav DS Investment House Ltd. “It is hard to
see how the company will be able to meet the court’s demand on
the Clal stake.”  The shares of parent  IDB Holding (IDBH)  Corp., which has been
trying to sell assets as the company struggles to meet payments
on about 2 billion shekels,  slid  3.9 percent to 5.30 shekels.
The yield on IDB Holding’s 5.1 percent bonds maturing December
2020 surged 306 basis points to 58.39 percent.  The company’s bondholders this week voted in favor of a
debt restructuring plan which would divvy up IDB Holding’s
shares among them, according to a statement today to the bourse.
A bondholder vote, expected by Aug. 18 on several debt
restructuring plans, could see chairman Dankner ousted.  IDB Holding told a Tel Aviv court last month it’s in
initial talks with investors, including Argentine Eduardo Elsztain, for investments in IDB Holding.  Koor Industries Ltd. (KOR) ,
a unit of IDB Development, said this week it will advance the
sale of its 1.95 percent holding in  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ,
which it values at 2.1 billion shekels net.  To contact the reporter on this story:
