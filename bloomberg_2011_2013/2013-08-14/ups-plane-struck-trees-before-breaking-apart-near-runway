The  United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS)  plane
that crashed today short of a runway at the Birmingham, Alabama,
airport struck trees before hitting a hill and bursting into
flames, a safety investigator said.  The Airbus SAS A300-600 broke into at least three pieces,
Robert Sumwalt, a member of the U.S. National Transportation
Safety Board, said.  Smoldering fires have prevented investigators from reaching
the planeâ€™s cockpit-voice and data recorders, he said.  Sumwalt spoke in Birmingham at the first briefing after the
accident, which occurred just before 5 a.m. local time. Both
pilots died.  To contact the reporter on this story:
