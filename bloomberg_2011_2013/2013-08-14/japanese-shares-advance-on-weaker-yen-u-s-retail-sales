Japanese  shares  rose, with the Topix
index advancing for a second day amid low volume, as exporters
rose after the yen dropped for a third day. Developers and
brokerages led gains among the gauge’s 33 industry groups.  Toyota Motor Corp., Asia’s biggest carmaker, advanced 1.3
percent. Nippon Sheet Glass Co. gained 4.8 percent after a
Credit Suisse Group AG analyst said the company has brought
restructuring forward to offset worsening conditions in Europe.
Hokuetsu Kishu Paper Co. sank 1.8 percent after  Japan ’s No. 3
paper maker by market value cut its profit forecast. Showa Shell
Sekiyu K.K. fell 2.3 percent after its investment rating was cut
by Daiwa Securities Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc.  The Topix rose 1.2 percent to 1,171.34 at the close of
trading in Tokyo, with volume about 15 percent lower than the
30-day average. The index surged 2 percent yesterday after a
report Prime Minister Shinzo Abe may cut taxes on businesses.
The Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 1.3 percent to 14,050.16,
reversing losses of as much as 0.9 percent.  “Not only is the weaker yen boosting stocks, but also
investors remain optimistic for a cut in the corporate-tax
rate,” said Kuninobu Takeuchi, a Tokyo-based executive
portfolio manager at DIAM Co., which oversees $122 billion
globally. “There are very few market participants today and
orders are thin.”  Daily trading volume  on the  Topix (TPX)  fell to the lowest this
year on Aug. 12 and remained near that level yesterday, with
fewer than 2 billion shares changing hands as investors take
summer vacations. About 2.2 billion shares were traded today,
below the 3.6 billion average for this year. The gauge’s 30-day
historic volatility was at 26.15 today, compared with its five-year median of 19.42.  Automakers Advance  The yen fell to as low as 98.43 per dollar today, compared
with a high of 95.93 on Aug. 12. A weaker Japanese currency
boosts overseas earnings at the nation’s exporters when
repatriated.  Car and electronics makers provided the  biggest boost  to
the Topix. Toyota, which counts North America as its biggest
market for  sales , advanced 1.3 percent to 6,410 yen. Honda Motor
Co., which gets 83 percent of its revenue abroad, rose 1.6
percent to 3,855 yen. Sony Corp., which relies on the U.S. for
16 percent of revenue, climbed 1.7 percent to 2,000 yen.  Among other stocks that rose, Nippon Sheet Glass gained 4.8
percent to 109 yen. The company is likely to sell off non-core
assets, which should lead to a smaller-than-forecast loss to
help offset worsening conditions in Europe, Credit Suisse
analyst Jun Yamaguchi wrote in a report.  Sales Tax  The Topix Real Estate Index gained 2.9 percent today, the
most among the broader equity gauge’s subsectors.  Mitsubishi
Estate Co. (8802) , Japan’s biggest developer by market value, gained
2.5 percent to 2,592 yen. Sumitomo Realty & Development Co.,
Japan’s third-biggest property company, jumped 4.2 percent to
4,320 yen. Mitsui Fudosan Co., the nation’s No. 1 developer by
sales, added 2.3 percent to 3,115 yen.  “There’s increased expectation that the government is
going to raise the consumption tax,” said  Kenichi Hirano , a
Tokyo-based market analyst at Tachibana Securities Co. “The
sales tax on real estate is substantial, and investors are
betting that consumers will rush to buy property before the tax
kicks in.”  Japan may raise its sales tax by three percentage points
next year to rein in a national debt of more than twice gross
domestic product. The Nikkei newspaper reported yesterday that
the prime minister had asked for a study of lower rates on
businesses as a counterweight.  Hokuetsu Kishu  Among shares that fell, Hokuetsu Kishu Paper sank 1.8
percent to 440 yen. The paper maker cut its first-half operating
profit forecast by half to 500 million yen while reporting a 52
percent drop in first-quarter net income to 686 million yen.  Showa Shell slipped 2.3 percent to 950 yen after Daiwa
analyst Takahiro Yano cut his investment rating on the oil
company to neutral from outperform, saying the shares were
nearing fair value as short-term positives have been “played
out.” The stock was also downgraded to neutral from buy
yesterday by Citigroup.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.1 percent
today. The gauge rose 0.3 percent yesterday as data showed
retail sales added 0.2 percent in July, following a 0.6 percent
gain the prior month that was larger than previously reported.
The median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for
a 0.3 percent advance.  The Topix traded at 1.22 times  book value  today, compared
with 2.49 for the S&P 500 and 1.73 for the Stoxx Europe 600
Index yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
