India  plans to spend 6 billion euros
($7.9 billion) to build an electricity grid to evacuate power
from wind and solar plants that have more than doubled in
capacity in the last five years.  The  grid  will be built across seven states over the next
five to six years, Ratan P. Watal, secretary at the Ministry of
New and Renewable Energy, said in New Delhi today. The project
will receive 250 million euros “soon” from KfW Group, a German
development bank, he said.  India is doubling its transmission capacity to avoid
blackouts such as the world’s largest failure last year, which
left about half its population in the darkness. As part of
measures taken to stabilize its grid, the government last month
asked wind farms to accurately predict their output a day in
advance or face fines.  KfW will finance a total 1 billion euros, Watal said. The
grid will also receive funds from the World Bank, Asian
Development Bank, India’s National Electricity  Fund  and state
governments, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
