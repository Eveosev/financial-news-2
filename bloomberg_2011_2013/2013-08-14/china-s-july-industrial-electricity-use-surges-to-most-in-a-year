China ’s  industrial power use  in July
rose to the highest monthly total in a year, adding to signs
that the world’s second-biggest economy is stabilizing.  Power use by companies in the mining, manufacturing and
construction sectors grew 8.1 percent from a year earlier to
366.6 billion kilowatt-hours, data from the  National Energy
Administration  showed today. That’s the highest monthly total in
at least a year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The increase in power use, along with better-than-expected
growth in industrial output, exports and imports, boosts odds
Premier Li Keqiang will meet this year’s target of 7.5 percent
economic expansion. Growth has slowed for two consecutive
quarters, moderating to 7.5 percent in the three-month period
through June.  “This is a sign of the economy stabilizing,” Tian Miao,
an energy analyst at North Square Blue Oak, a London-based
researcher, said by phone today. “With the government pushing
more investment in infrastructure and urbanization, industrial
output has started to pick up, increasing power demand.”  Premier Li, who has championed urbanization as a “huge
engine” for growth, said on July 26 the nation will speed up
railway construction with a focus on central and western
regions.  Total power use in July grew 8.8 percent to reach 495
billion kilowatt-hours. Household users consumed 58.5 billion
kilowatt-hours of power, rising 12 percent from a year earlier,
while power use in the services industries climbed 13 percent to
58.6 billion kilowatt-hours.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
