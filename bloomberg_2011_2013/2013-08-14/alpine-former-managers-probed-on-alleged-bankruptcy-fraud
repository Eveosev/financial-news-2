Former managers of Alpine Bau GmbH,
the builder that in June filed for Austria’s biggest postwar
insolvency, are being investigated on allegations of false
accounting and bankruptcy fraud, prosecutors said.  Authorities are probing five executives from several Alpine
units, Erich Mayer, a spokesman for the white-collar crime
department at Vienna’s prosecutors office, said by phone today.
The investigation follows a complaint by lawyer Eric
Breiteneder, who represents holders of Alpine bonds, he said.  Alpine Bau, owned by Spain’s  Fomento de Construcciones y
Contratas SA , filed for insolvency on June 19 with liabilities
of 2.56 billion euros ($3.4 billion). Lawyers are looking at
ways to reduce the damage done to the holders of bonds issued by
Alpine Holding GmbH, Alpine Bau’s parent that also filed for
insolvency. The notes with a combined face value of 290 million
euros were issued as late as in May 2012.  “My goal is to recover the lost funds as quickly and
efficiently as possible,” Breiteneder said in a telephone
interview. The information obtained by prosecutors may help with
a separate action seeking compensation from the banks that sold
the bonds to private investors, he said.  If proven guilty, the people investigated face as long as
10 years in jail, Mayer said. He declined to identify the
individuals being probed.  FCC, based in  Madrid , declined to comment on the probe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
