Massmart Holdings Ltd. (MSM) , the South
African food and goods wholesaler owned by  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) ,
fell to the lowest in almost two years a day after saying half-year profit decreased.  The shares declined as much as 8.5 percent to 146 rand, the
lowest intraday price since October 2011, and traded 3.1 percent
lower at the market close in Johannesburg. Almost 1.3 million
shares traded, more than three times the three-month daily
average. The stock fell 2.7 percent yesterday.  Earnings per share excluding one-time items and foreign-exchange gains decreased 3.9 percent to 15 percent in the 26
weeks through June 23, the Johannesburg-based company said in a
statement yesterday. It didn’t give a reason. Bentonville,
Arkansas-based Wal-Mart bought 51 percent of Massmart for $1.8
billion in 2011.  “This share has been priced for magic to come out of the
Wal-Mart deal and that hasn’t materialized yet,” David Shapiro,
a director at Johannesburg-based Sasfin Securities, said by
phone. “There isn’t much evidence that the Wal-Mart strategies
are going to take hold soon.”  The company will release full financial results for the
period on Aug. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
