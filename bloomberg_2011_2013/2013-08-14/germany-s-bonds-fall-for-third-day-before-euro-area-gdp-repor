Spanish and Italian government bonds
rallied after a report showed the euro-area economy emerged from
a record-long recession in the second quarter, spurring demand
for the region’s higher-yielding assets.  Spain’s  10-year yields  dropped the most in four weeks to
the lowest level since May as gross domestic product also
surpassed analysts forecasts in Germany and  France , adding to
signs the region’s debt crisis is easing. Portugal’s  10-year
bonds (GSPT10YR)  advanced for a third day. German bunds were little changed
as borrowing costs climbed to the highest level since February
2012 as the nation sold 3.23 billion euros ($4.28 billion) of
10-year securities.  “The market has been underpinned by the recent better
data,” said  Padhraic Garvey , head of developed-market debt
strategy at ING Groep NV in Amsterdam. “The trend has been
pretty robust. We’ve seen some decent buying of periphery,” he
said, referring to the securities of Europe’s high debt and
deficit nations.  Spain’s 10-year yield fell seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 4.42 percent at 4:42 p.m. London time after
declining to 4.41 percent, the lowest since May 31. The 4.4
percent bond maturing in October 2023 rose 0.595, or 5.95 euros
per 1,000-euro face amount, to 99.855.  The Italian 10-year yield dropped five basis points to 4.18
percent after dropping to 4.15 percent yesterday, the least
since June 6. Similar-maturity  Portuguese yields  fell three
basis points to 6.50 percent.  Beating Forecasts  Euro-area  GDP (EUGNEMUQ)  expanded 0.3 percent in the three months
through June after shrinking 0.3 percent in the previous
quarter, the European Union’s statistics office said. Germany
GDP increased 0.7 percent, more than the 0.6 percent gain
forecast by economists, while France’s expanded 0.5 percent
after two quarters of contraction. Still, at least four of the
17 nations remain in recession, including Spain and  Italy .  The additional yield investors demand to hold Spanish 10-year bonds instead of similar-maturity German bunds fell eight
basis points to 260 basis points after narrowing to 259, the
least since July 2011.  Italy’s yield spread over bunds contracted five basis
points to 237 basis points after reaching 235, also the
narrowest since July 2011.  The spread may shrink to as little as 200 basis points by
year-end, ING’s Garvey said. It was as wide at 575 basis points
in November 2011.  ‘More Constructive’  “Broader investor sentiment is slightly more
constructive,” said Mark Dowding, who helps oversee $56 billion
at BlueBay Asset Management LLP in  London . “Some economic data
in Europe has been pointing toward some green shoots of
recovery. If we do see an improving outlook for the euro area
economy, German bond yields will continue to rise.”  Germany’s 10-year bund yielded 1.81 percent after climbing
to 1.84 percent, the most since June 24.  Germany allotted 10-year bunds at an average yield of 1.80
percent, the highest at an auction since Feb. 29, 2012. The
nation  last sold  10-year securities on July 17 at 1.57 percent.
That compares with a record-low 1.28 percent on April 17.  “The auction was decently bid,” Annalisa Piazza, an
analyst at Newedge Group in London, wrote in a note. “But not
exceptionally solid, given the sell-off of the 10-year. A new
10-year bund will be launched in September.”  Germany ’s benchmark yield dropped to a record 1.127 percent
last year as concern the euro-region would splinter boosted
demand for the top-rated securities. Yields have climbed since
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi pledged to do
“whatever it takes” to preserve the shared currency, and
policy makers cut interest rates to a record to boost growth.  ‘Higher Yields’  “We are going the way of higher yields for Germany,” said
Owen Callan, an analyst at  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE)  in Dublin. “We’ve
had pretty good data from Europe, there have been no negative
surprises. We are getting back to the top of the range. Once we
get to 1.85 percent there will be quite a few buyers.”  Volatility on Greek bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today followed by those of the Netherlands and  Belgium ,
according to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between
two- and 10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  Spanish securities returned 7.4 percent this year through
yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Italy
earned 4.1 percent, while German bonds lost 2.1 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
