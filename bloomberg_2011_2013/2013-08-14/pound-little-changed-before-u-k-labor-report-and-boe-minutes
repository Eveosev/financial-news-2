U.K. 10-year government bond yields
reached the highest in almost two years before a report that
economists said will show jobless claims fell for a ninth month
in July, weakening the case for additional monetary stimulus.  Claimants for   unemployment benefits  dropped by 15,000 in
July, while the  jobless rate  stayed at 7.8 percent in the second
quarter, according to Bloomberg News surveys of analysts. The
 Bank of England  has pledged to keep interest rates low while
unemployment remains above 7 percent. It is scheduled to publish
the minutes of its July 31-Aug. 1 policy meeting at 9:30 a.m.
London time. The pound was little changed.  “If we see a fall in the  unemployment rate , it will fuel
fears that interest rates may rise earlier than the Bank of
England’s projections suggest, and that will be bad news for the
gilts market,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a fixed-income strategist
at RIA Capital Markets Ltd. in Edinburgh.  “Unemployment data
will be more important than usual.”  Benchmark 10-year gilt yields were little changed at 2.59
percent at 9:15 a.m. London time after earlier climbing to 2.62
percent, the highest since Oct. 28, 2011. The 1.75 percent bond
maturing in September 2022 was at 93.24. Two-year gilt yields
were also little changed, at 0.42 percent.  Sterling was at 85.95 pence per euro after reaching 85.35
pence yesterday, the strongest level since July 4. The pound
traded at $1.5433 from $1.5449 yesterday.  Policy Makers  Central bank Governor  Mark Carney  said last week policy
makers plan to keep the main  interest rate  at a  record-low  0.5
percent until the jobless rate falls to 7 percent, which they
forecast shouldn’t happen until at least the fourth quarter of
2016. A majority of economists in a Bloomberg survey expect it
to reach that target sooner.  The  Office for National Statistics  is also scheduled to
release the jobs data at 9:30 a.m. London time.  The pound has gained 0.7 percent in the past month,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track
10 developed-nation currencies. The euro was little changed and
the dollar slipped 1.6 percent.  U.K. government bonds lost 4.3 percent this year through
yesterday, Bloomberg World Bond Indexes show. German securities
dropped 2.1 percent and Treasuries declined 3.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
