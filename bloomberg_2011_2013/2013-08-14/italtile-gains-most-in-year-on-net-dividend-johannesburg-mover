Italtile Ltd. (ITE)  climbed the most in a
year as the South African retailer of ceramic tiles and bathroom
fixtures said it would pay a special dividend after full-year
profit advanced.  The stock rallied 8.2 percent, the steepest gain since
August 2012, to 6.50 rand by the close in Johannesburg. More
than one million shares were traded, or 3.4 times the three-month daily average, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
benchmark  FTSE/JSE Africa All Shares Index (JALSH)  added 0.8 percent.  Earnings per share excluding one-time items in the year
through June rose 16 percent to 47.4 cents per share, Italtile
said today. The Johannesburg-based company plans to pay a
special dividend of 50 cents a share given its “highly cash
generative nature,” it said. That’s in addition to an ordinary
dividend of 16 cents, a 14 percent increase year-on-year.  “The company has managed to improve profit as it’s
refocused the business, taking market share,”  David Shapiro , a
director at Johannesburg-based Sasfin Securities, said by phone.  Italtile’s TopT business, which caters to lower-income
earners, posted record results triggered by “aggressive”
pricing and new products, the company said.  The stock has gained 3.2 percent so far this year, compared
with a drop of 15 percent for  Cashbuild Ltd. (CSB) , a South African
building-materials wholesaler and retailer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
