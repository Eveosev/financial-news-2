Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  sold North Sea
Forties crude at the same differential as yesterday. Vitol Group
sought to sell Russian Urals in the Mediterranean without
success.  Libya’s Waha Oil Co. halted almost all of its 340,000
barrels of daily production as storage tanks reached full
capacity amid port closures, an official said today. The
country’s Mellitah export terminal reopened.  North Sea  Shell sold Forties cargo F0903 for Sept. 7 to Sept. 9
loading to  Phillips 66 (PSX)  at $1.25 a barrel more than Dated Brent,
unchanged from yesterday, according to a Bloomberg survey of
traders and brokers monitoring the Platts pricing window.  Chevron failed to sell Forties for Sept. 6 to Sept. 8 at
$1.50 more than Dated Brent, while  BP Plc (BP/)  didn’t manage to buy a
lot for Sept. 2 to Sept. 7 at plus $1.05, the survey showed.  No bids or offers were made for Brent, Oseberg or Ekofisk
crudes. Reported crude trading typically occurs during the
Platts window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time.  Brent for September settlement traded at $109.59 a barrel
on the ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of the window,
compared with $109.57 in the previous session. The October
contract was at $108.36, a discount of $1.23 to September.  The share of Buzzard crude in Forties rose by 10 percentage
points to 64 percent in the week to Aug. 11, the highest since
the week to Aug. 12 last year, according to BP.  Forties cargo F0918 will be exported on Oct. 2 to Oct. 4,
three days later than planned, while shipment F0902 will be
deferred by one day to Sept. 6 to Sept. 8, said three people
with knowledge of the loading program.  All 14 Forties cargoes scheduled to load in August were
deferred because of planned and unplanned outages in North Sea
oil fields and a pipeline.  The net effect of the delays is an increase in September
loadings to a daily rate of 400,000 barrels, and a decrease in
those scheduled for August to 213,000, according to the revised
loading programs obtained by Bloomberg. Shipments this month as
a result dropped to the lowest in 10 months, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Mediterranean/Urals  Vitol failed to sell 80,000 metric tons of Urals for Aug.
28 to Sept. 2 at 65 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent on a
delivered basis to Augusta,  Italy , the survey showed. This is
the first offer since July 24 when the crude traded at the same
price.  Fields operated by Waha, a joint venture between Libya’s
state-run National Oil Corp. and international oil companies,
stopped at the end of last week as sit-ins by guards seeking
better conditions cripple the nation’s export facilities, Abdel
Hakim Al Hansheer said at a press conference in Tripoli today.
The Mellitah terminal is “back to 100 percent,” an engineer at
Libya’s Arabian Gulf Oil Co. said by phone from the city.  PKN Orlen bought via a tender 100,000 tons of Urals for
Aug. 29-Sept. 2 delivery to Butinge oil terminal in  Lithuania 
from OAO Lukoil at a premium of 65 to 75 cents a barrel to Dated
Brent, according to three people with knowledge of the matter
who asked not to be identified because the information is
confidential.  Turkiye Petrolleri AO issued a tender to sell 600,000
barrels of Azeri Light for Sept. 14 to Sept. 16 loading from
Ceyhan, according to a document obtained by Bloomberg News. The
tender closes tomorrow at 5 p.m. local time.  Exports of Azeri Light from  Georgia ’s Black Sea port of
Supsa in September will increase to five cargoes of 600,000
barrels each, one more than in August, a final loading schedule
obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  This is also one more than the four lots totaling 2.37
million barrels planned in a preliminary program that was
released on Aug. 9.  West Africa  Vitol offered Nigerian Qua Iboe and Escravos grades outside
the Platts window. It sought to sell Qua Iboe for Sept. 10 to
Sept. 15 at $5.30 a barrel more than Dated Brent and Escravos
for Sept. 5 to Sept. 10 at a premium of $5.50. Both offers were
20 cents more than two days ago.  Alen oil field in Equatorial Guinea will reach full
operations by the end of the third quarter, Glencore Xstrata Plc
said today in a statement. The field started production at the
end of the second quarter, ahead of schedule, and is producing
50,000 barrels a day.  Noble Energy Inc. operates Alen field, which it owns with
Glencore, GEPetrol, the country’s state oil company, Atlas
Petroleum International and PA Resources Group.  To contact the reporters on this story:
