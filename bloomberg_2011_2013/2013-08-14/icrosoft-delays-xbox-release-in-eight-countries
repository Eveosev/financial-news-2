Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  said it is delaying the release of its Xbox One console in eight countries, including Russia and the Netherlands, until 2014 in order to make sure it has enough supply for larger markets.  The company, which had planned to begin sales of the console in November in 21 countries, will now cut that to 13. It will push back the date for the Xbox One’s rollout in Belgium, Denmark,  Finland ,  Norway , Sweden, Switzerland, Russia and the Netherlands.  “We understand this will be disappointing news for our fans in the impacted countries, and we are doing everything we can to bring Xbox One to you as soon as possible next year,” Microsoft said in a blog post on its website.  The delayed rollout is another issue for the Xbox One, which will sell for $499 and which has already seen Microsoft reversing itself on limits for reselling and trading games, as well as a requirement to connect the console to the Internet once a day. It will compete against  Sony Corp.’s (6758)  PlayStation 4, which will cost $399. Both consoles are crucial to the companies’ efforts to reach consumers in their living rooms.
