Swiss Life Holding AG (SLHN) ,  Switzerland ’s
biggest life insurer, said first-half profit climbed 30 percent
after selling more policies in Switzerland and France.  Net income rose to 472 million Swiss francs ($506 million),
from 364 million francs a year earlier, the Zurich-based insurer
said in a statement today. That beat the 367.9 million-franc
average  estimate  of seven  analysts  surveyed by Bloomberg.  The company, led by Chief Executive Officer Bruno Pfister,
said in November that it will cut costs by as much as 160
million francs and eliminate as many as 400 jobs in Germany and
Switzerland. Higher sales in Switzerland and France helped boost
Swiss Life’s total premiums by 5.4 percent to 10.4 billion
francs in the first half.  “All market units are growing in terms of both premium
income and their contribution to the group result,” Pfister
said in the statement. “Thanks to strict margin management and
further improvements in the product mix, we increased the new
business margin from 1.4 percent at the end of 2012 to 2 percent
at half-year 2013.”  Operating profit at its Swiss unit, the company’s biggest
business, increased 33 percent to 472 million francs, while that
in  France  rose 14 percent to 93 million francs.  Swiss Life cut its targeted return on equity in November to
between 8 percent and 10 percent over the next three years from
between 10 percent and 12 percent.  Swiss Life posted a net investment result of 2.4 percent
after additional gains and “appreciation” in its portfolio.  The company said its solvency capital ratio, a gauge of its
ability to cover claims and write new business, dropped to 205
percent at the end of June from 239 percent at the end of last
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
