Canadian home resale price gains
quickened last month from the slowest pace in almost four years
led by gains in Calgary and the Ontario cities of Toronto and
Hamilton.  Prices across 11 cities rose 1.9 percent in July from a
year earlier, faster than June’s 1.8 percent rate, according to
the  Teranet-National Bank  Composite House Price Index. Toronto,
the country’s biggest city, saw gains of 3.4 percent, while
Hamilton prices rose 6.7 percent and Calgary increased 5.9
percent, National Bank Financial said today from  Montreal .  Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz has said there are
signs of a “constructive” moderation in household debt levels
after they reached a record high as a share of income last year.
The 12-month gains in the Teranet figures have been slowing from
a recent peak of 7.1 percent in November 2011.  Prices in  Vancouver  fell 2 percent in July from a year ago,
the 12th straight decline, according to the report.  The index, which was set at 100 in June 2005, climbed to a
record 158.16 in today’s report, meaning resale prices have
increased 58 percent over that time. Prices rose to record highs
in four of the 11 cities tracked by Teranet, including Toronto.  On a monthly basis, prices rose 0.7 percent, with gains in
nine of the 11 markets surveyed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
