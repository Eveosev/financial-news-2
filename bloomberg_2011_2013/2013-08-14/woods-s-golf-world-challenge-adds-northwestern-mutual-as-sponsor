Tiger Woods’s World Challenge U.S.
PGA Tour event added  Northwestern Mutual  Life Insurance Co. as
its title sponsor, two years after  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  ended its
support of the off-season California event.  It’s the tournament’s fourth title sponsor in 15 years.  Milwaukee-based Northwestern Mutual had served as a lower-level presenting sponsor of the tournament in Thousand Oaks,
California in 2012.  Terms of the title agreement weren’t disclosed by the Tiger Woods Foundation, which has a contract to stage the event at
Sherwood Country Club through 2015.  This year’s challenge, which features a limited 18-player
field, is scheduled for Dec. 2-8. Graeme McDowell won the 2012
tournament, with Woods tying for fourth with Jim Furyk and
 Rickie Fowler .  The tournament counts for points in the Official World Golf
Ranking. Prize money doesn’t count toward the U.S. tour’s season
title.  To contact the reporter on this story:
