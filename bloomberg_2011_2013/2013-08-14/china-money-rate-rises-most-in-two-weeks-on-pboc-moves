China ’s benchmark money-market rate
rose the most in more than two weeks after the central bank
reduced cash injections and rolled over three-year notes.  The People’s Bank of China asked lenders to submit orders
today for 14-day reverse-repurchase agreements and 28-day
repurchase contracts, said a trader at a primary dealer required
to bid at the auctions. The authority pumped 11 billion  yuan 
($1.8 billion) into the financial system yesterday through
seven-day reverse repos at 3.9 percent. It extended the maturity
of 75.5 billion yuan of three-year notes on Aug. 12.  “The roll-over hurts commercial banks’ liquidity,” said
Xu Hanfei, a Shanghai-based analyst with Guotai Junan Securities
Co. “The central bank’s intention has become clearer, and may
drastically change market expectations of liquidity in the
medium to long term.”  The  seven-day repurchase rate , a gauge of cash availability
in the banking system, rose as much as 17 basis points, the most
since July 29, to 3.90 percent, according to a weighted average
compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center. The rate was
at 3.85 percent at 10:23 a.m. in  Shanghai .  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repo rate, gained six basis
points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 4.01 percent, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  The central bank may start trial trading in certificates of
deposit on the  interbank market  as soon as this year, the
Economic Information Daily reported today, citing unidentified
people close to the PBOC.  The yield on the government’s 3.38 percent notes due May
2023 rose three basis points to 3.98 percent, according to the
Interbank Funding Center. That was the highest since September
2011.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
