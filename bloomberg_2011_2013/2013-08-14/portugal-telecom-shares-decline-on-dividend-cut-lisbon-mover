Portugal Telecom SGPS SA, the
country’s biggest telecommunications company, fell the most in
three months after cutting its dividend for 2013 and 2014.  The payout will be 10 euro cents a share each year, down
from 32.5 cents for fiscal 2012 earnings. The stock  dropped  7.3
percent to 2.93 euros in Lisbon, the biggest fall since May 14.  Oi SA,  Brazil ’s largest landline phone company, in July
canceled a dividend payment of 1 billion reais ($432 million)
after exceeding a self-imposed limit for indebtedness. Portugal
Telecom owns 12.1 percent of the investor group known as
TmarPart that controls Oi, and 19.4 percent of the Brazilian
carrier’s non-voting shares, according to Oi’s annual report.  Portugal Telecom’s “dividend cut is a reflection of the
continued investment required by Oi to turn around its
structurally challenged business in Brazil,”  Robin Bienenstock ,
an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd., wrote in a note today.  Zeinal Bava joined Oi as chief executive officer In June,
leaving the same post at Portugal Telecom to replace CEO
Francisco Valim, who was ousted in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
