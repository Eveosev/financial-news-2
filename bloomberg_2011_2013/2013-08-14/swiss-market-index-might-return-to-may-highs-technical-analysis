The  Swiss Market Index (SMI)  will continue
recent gains until it nears the 8,400 level, a 4.5 percent
advance from yesterday’s close, according to Philipp Jaeggle, a
technical analyst at Zuercher Kantonalbank.  That target coincides with the 5 1/2-year high on May 22
and will act as a resistance level for the Swiss equities
benchmark, Jaeggle said. The index will meet a support level
limiting further losses if it falls to the 200-day moving
average at about 7,500, he said.  “We are still in an upward trend,” Zurich-based Jaeggle
said in a phone interview today. “We expect the Swiss market to
proceed in this move up in the next few months.”  An increase above 8,400 would imply the SMI will climb to
the next resistance at 8,900 to 9,200, Jaeggle said, indicated
by the highs in December 2007 and October 2007, respectively. A
drop below the support of 7,500 may send the index to the next
floor at around 7,000, the analyst said.  The SMI advanced 0.5 percent to 8,080.18 at 2:52 p.m. in
Zurich today, extending this year’s gain to 18 percent.  Technical analysts look at charts to predict moves in
