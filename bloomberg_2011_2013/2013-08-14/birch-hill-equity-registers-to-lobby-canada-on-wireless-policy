Birch Hill Equity Partners
Management Inc. has registered to lobby the Canadian government
on investments in wireless telecommunications companies.  Chairman Stephen Dent of the Toronto-based private equity
company is listed in the federal lobbyist registry as planning
to contact the prime minister’s office and Industry  Canada .  Canada’s largest communications companies have pressured
Prime Minister Stephen Harper to alter the government’s wireless
policy, which they say gives unfair advantages to foreign
companies that want to buy smaller carriers such as Wind Mobile.  The Globe and Mail newspaper reported earlier this month
that Rogers Communications Inc. is supporting Birch Hill in a
bid for Wind Mobile.  To contact the reporter on this story:
