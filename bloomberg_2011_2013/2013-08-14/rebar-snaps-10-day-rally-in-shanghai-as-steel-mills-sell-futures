Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  fell for the first time in 11 days as steel mills and
investors sold to take advantage of prices at the highest level
in four months.  Rebar for January delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
fell 0.6 percent to 3,815  yuan  ($623) a metric ton at 10:33 a.m.
local time. The contract closed at 3,838 yuan yesterday, the
highest close for a most-active contract since April 12.  The average  spot price  of rebar rose for a seventh day
yesterday, adding 0.5 percent to 3,542 yuan a ton, the highest
since May 23, according to Beijing Antaike Information
Development Co. Futures have gained faster than spot prices this
month, prompting some investors to sell, said Xia Caijun, an
analyst at GF Futures Co. in Guangzhou.  “It’s natural to have a pullback after a strong
performance in futures contracts, which encourages steel mills
to step up hedging and selling,” Xia said.  Rebar’s downside is limited, he said.  Baoshan Iron & Steel
Co. (600019) ,  China ’s largest publicly traded steelmaker, raised some
products prices for September delivery yesterday, according to a
statement on its website.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery advanced for a sixth day
yesterday, rising 2.2 percent to $141.80 a dry ton, the highest
since March 12, according to a  price index  compiled by The Steel
Index Ltd.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
