A Michigan school district west of
 Detroit  borrowed $18.6 million with initial yields as high as
4.82 percent, according to three people familiar with the deal.  The sale is the first long-term borrowing by a Michigan
locality since Detroit filed the biggest municipal bankruptcy in
history on July 18.  Michigan Finance Authority sold the revenue debt on behalf
of Ypsilanti Community Schools, about a half-hour drive from
Detroit. The Michigan counties of Saginaw, Genesee and Battle
Creek postponed debt sales following Detroit’s action.  The longest portion of the deal has debt maturing August
2026 and is being marketed at a preliminary yield of 4.82
percent, said the people, who requested anonymity because
pricing wasn’t final. The yield is 1.47 percentage points above
an index of benchmark munis with similar maturity, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  The bonds will be repaid through revenue from a state
school-aid program. Proceeds will refinance notes, Scott Menzel,
Ypsilanti’s superintendent said last week in a telephone
interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
