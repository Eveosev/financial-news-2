Palm oil  imports by India, the
world’s biggest buyer, declined for the first time in three
months in July after a slump in the rupee to a record low
increased costs for refiners.  Inbound shipments of crude and refined palm oils dropped
5.2 percent to 568,254 metric tons from 599,128 tons in July
2012, the Mumbai-based  Solvent Extractors’ Association of India 
said in an e-mailed statement today. That beat a median estimate
of 550,000 tons in a Bloomberg survey published yesterday.
Imports of  refined, bleached and deodorized palm olein  surged 90
percent to 213,853 tons in July from 112,611 tons a year
earlier, it said.  Falling Indian demand may expand  stockpiles  in  Malaysia 
just as the world’s second-biggest supplier enters its high-output cycle. Production gained 18 percent to 1.67 million tons
in July, the most in 10 months, the Malaysian Palm Oil Board
said today. The rupee slumped to an all-time low this month on
concern that the current-account deficit will widen from a
record in the year ended March.  “India will not increase its inventory when palm oil
prices are falling,” said B.V. Mehta, executive director of the
extractors association. “Importers know that the output of
oilseeds crops will exceed last year and palm oil is entering
the high-production cycle, putting pressure on prices.”  Palm for delivery in October dropped 0.1 percent to 2,294
ringgit ($670) a ton on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange in
 Kuala Lumpur . Futures tumbled to the lowest level in more than
three years last month after dropping for five quarters.  Total  vegetable oils  imports, including for industrial use,
gained 2.2 percent to 889,493 tons in July, the association
said. Shipments rose 11 percent to 8.03 million tons in the nine
months through July, it said. Crude  soybean oil  imports jumped
to 234,650 tons in July from 156,720 tons a year earlier, while
sunflower oil purchases declined to 62,300 tons from 80,101
tons, it said.  India, the world’s biggest cooking oil consumer after
 China , meets more than half its demand through imports. It buys
palm oil from Indonesia and Malaysia and soybean oil from the
U.S., Brazil and  Argentina .  To contact the reporter on this story:
