Lone Pine  Capital LLC bought
 American Express Co. (AXP)  and Facebook Inc. in the second quarter,
while selling stakes in  Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU)  and American
International Group Inc.  Lone Pine, run by Stephen Mandel Jr., purchased 3.72
million shares of New York-based American Express and 9.86
million shares of Facebook, the firm said today in a filing.  Lone Pine, based in Greenwich, Connecticut, sold its 5.38
million-share stake in Lululemon valued at $335.1 million,
according to the Form 13F filing. The Vancouver-based yogawear
manufacturer’s chief executive officer left in June after the
company was forced to recall pants that became transparent when
wearers bent over. The firm also exited its 7.34 million stake
in insurer AIG valued at $285.1 million, according to the
filing.  Money managers who oversee more than $100 million in
equities must file a Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange
Commission within 45 days of each quarter’s end to list their
U.S.-traded stocks, options and convertible bonds. The filings
don’t show non-U.S. securities or how much cash the firms hold.  To contact the reporter on this story:
