Apple Inc. (AAPL)  topped $500 for the first
time since January, a day after activist investor  Carl Icahn 
disclosed a stake in the world’s largest technology company, and
amid optimism that new iPhones and iPads can bolster growth.  The shares rose 2.3 percent to $501 at 12:07 p.m. in New
York, for the biggest intraday gain since Jan. 23. Apple had
declined 8 percent this year through yesterday, compared with a
19 percent gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Apple plans to introduce new versions of the iPhone and
iPad in time for the holiday shopping season, seeking to entice
shoppers who delayed purchases amid a dearth of new models so
far this year. The iPhone and iPad accounted for almost 70
percent of the company’s  sales  last quarter. Apple, whose stock
has dropped by more than 25 percent from a record in September,
got a crucial vote of confidence yesterday from Icahn, who said
he is pressing Chief Executive Officer  Tim Cook  for a share
buyback.  To contact the reporter on this story:
