The Vietnamese seaport of Da Nang
has reached agreement on smart-water and transit technology
improvements with  International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) , the
world’s biggest computer-services company said today.  Terms weren’t disclosed of the pact with  Vietnam ’s fourth-largest city. Da Nang Water Co. is expanding and modernizing its
water-treatment capacity using IBM’s real-time analysis and
monitoring of the water supply, IBM said.  Da Nang is upgrading its water and transportation system
infrastructure using sensors to cope with urban growth and a
shortage of water in the dry season, IBM said.  “Water and transportation are the first two areas where we
are applying some of the most advanced technologies available,”
Pham Kim Son, director of Da Nang’s Department of Information
and Communications, said in an e-mailed statement.  IBM is also helping the city manage water salinity
problems. The hydropower plant on the upper part of the Vu Gia
River that provides water to Da Nang has reduced supplies to the
city, Armonk, New York-based IBM said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
