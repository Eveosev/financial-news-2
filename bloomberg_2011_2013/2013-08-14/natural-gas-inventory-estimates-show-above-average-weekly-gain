Natural gas stockpiles expanded last
week by more than the seasonal average as mild weather reduced
the need for power to run air conditioners, according to  analyst
forecasts  compiled by Bloomberg.  U.S. inventories increased 69 billion cubic feet to 3.011
trillion in the seven days ended Aug. 9, based on the median of
18  estimates . The five-year average increase for the period is
42 billion cubic feet, Energy Information Administration data
show. Supplies advanced by 20 billion a year earlier.  The estimates were for gains ranging from 62 billion to 79
billion cubic feet. The EIA, the statistical arm of the Energy
Department, is scheduled to release its weekly stockpile report
at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in  Washington .  Temperatures were below normal from the East Coast through
the Great Plains last week, according to MDA Weather Services in
Gaithersburg,  Maryland .  Gas prices  have slumped from a 21-month
high on May 1 as unusually mild summer weather limited cooling
needs.  Supplies jumped by 96 billion cubic feet the previous week,
including 14 billion that was reclassified to working gas from
base gas, the EIA said. Analysts had expected a gain of 79
billion for the period.  “After last week’s 96 reclassification head-fake, the
market is going to be a little nervous about this one,” Drew Wozniak, vice president of market research at United-ICAP, a
brokerage in  Jersey City ,  New Jersey , said in a note to clients
today.  “We are likely to have a bear number next week, so the
question is, will we touch $3 by the end of the month.”  Natural gas futures for August delivery rose 5.7 cents, or
1.7 percent, to settle at $3.342 per million British thermal
units on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices fell 3.5
percent last week after sliding to $3.129 on Aug. 8, the lowest
intraday price since Feb. 15.  Power producers will account for 32 percent of gas demand
in 2013, according to the EIA.  Gas supplies in the week ended Aug. 2 were 0.7 percent
 above  the five-year average, flipping to a surplus to the
historical norm for the first time since March 22, EIA data
show. A  deficit  to year-earlier levels narrowed to 9.2 percent
from 11.5 percent the previous week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
