The international community,
primarily the United Nations Security Council and the Arab
League, must immediately act to stop killings in  Egypt , Turkish
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s office said.  Turkey accused the international community of remaining
silent during the overthrow of Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi
by the military on July 3, saying that silence encouraged
today’s crackdown by security forces on two sit-ins that Mursi
supporters were holding Cairo. Mursi’s Muslim Brotherhood has
said the death toll runs into hundreds, while the latest
official figures showed 15 people confirmed dead.  The statement from Erdogan’s office came shortly after
Turkish supporters of Mursi gathered outside the U.S. Embassy in
Ankara chanting “this is the den of Satan.” They also shouted
“long live our Islamic resistance” and “salute to Mursi”
before dispersing peacefully.  Turkish President Abdullah Gul said  Turkey  fears Egypt is
on a road to “chaos,” and called the firing at civilians a
“serious crime” in televised remarks today.  Iran ’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement today that it
was “closely following the bitter and regrettable events of
Egypt,” according to the state-owned IRNA news service. “No
doubt the current developments are increasing the risks of a
civil war in this great Islamic nation,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
