Pinar Emirdag, head of professional business development at  London Stock Exchange Group Plc (LSE) , has left the company after three years.  Europe’s oldest independent bourse hired Emirdag, a former board member of Turquoise, in 2010 as it sought to lure back customers from its rivals. Emirdag was responsible for developing relations and business with the wholesale market including investment banks, brokers and high-frequency traders. Emirdag came to LSE from  ICAP Plc (IAP) , where she was head of business development at the firm’s equities unit in  London .  Lucie Holloway, a spokeswoman for LSE, said that Emirdag has left and declined to comment further. Emirdag declined to comment.  In May, the exchange hired Brian Schwieger from  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) ’s Merrill Lynch unit, three people with knowledge of the plans said at the time. Schwieger is based in London as head of equities at the exchange operator, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the details aren’t public.  He had worked for Bank of America since August 2005 where he was responsible for sales, marketing and execution consulting for European equity electronic trading in London. He has also worked for New York-based  Morgan Stanley. (MS)   Emirdag was born in Istanbul and holds a doctorate in theoretical physics from Brown University in the U.S. She joined  Citigroup Inc. (C)  in London, where she was instrumental in setting up Turquoise, a multilateral-trading facility set up by investment banks to challenge traditional exchanges. From Citigroup, Emirdag moved to the European arm of Liquidnet Holdings Inc. and then joined ICAP.
