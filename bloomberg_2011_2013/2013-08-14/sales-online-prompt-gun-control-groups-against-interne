A private seller from  Pensacola ,
 Florida , is offering to trade an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle for
a jet ski or a riding lawn mower. Another in Huntsville,
 Alabama , will barter ammunition and magazines for an iPad Mini.  The online postings this month on  Armslist.com , one of the
busiest gun-swap websites, are part of an underworld of firearms
sales thriving in the U.S. after senators in April failed to
advance a measure requiring background checks for private gun
purchases.  “It’s a loophole so large you could drive a Mack truck
through it,” Representative Jackie Speier, a California
Democrat who served on a House panel on gun violence, said in a
telephone interview yesterday. “There’s a way to get around”
the existing state and federal firearms laws, she said.  Gun-control advocates including a super-political action
committee founded by former Arizona Representative  Gabrielle Giffords , who was shot in the head in 2011, are regrouping 15
months before the 2014 congressional elections. To muster public
support for stricter gun laws, they’re running ads and visiting
the states -- including Arizona,  New Hampshire  and  Arkansas  --
of senators they want to persuade.  The groups are tailoring their message to what they see as
the most glaring legal flaws, the rise of a largely unregulated
private  firearms  market on the Internet and at gun shows.
Purchasers have found ways around background-check rules, and
private sales have flourished. While sales across state lines
must go through a licensed dealer, in many states trades without
such checks are legal within a state’s borders.  Gun Deals  Studies to be released this month will emphasize the
increasing number of private gun deals arranged over the
Internet.  Third Way , a  Washington  research group aligned with
Democrats, found more than 15,000 sales ads on Armslist.com in a
recent survey.  Another report obtained by  Bloomberg News , by Giffords’s
 Americans for Responsible Solutions , said that more than 67,000
guns were for sale from private sellers on Armslist.com., where
sellers can list multiple guns in one post.  Gun-control advocates pushed for tighter laws after the
Dec. 14 shooting of 20 first-graders and six adults at Sandy
Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. Those efforts
fell apart with the April 17 Senate vote that thwarted an
expansion of background checks. Advocates say they aren’t giving
up, touting public support for stricter gun laws -- 90 percent
of respondents in some opinion surveys supported background
checks.  Lawmakers Preoccupied  Still, little appetite has re-emerged for gun legislation
in Congress. When lawmakers return Sept. 9 from a five-week
recess, they will be preoccupied by debate over funding the
government and raising the nation’s  debt  ceiling.  Earlier this month, Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid , a
Nevada Democrat, told the group Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense
in America that he will schedule another vote on background
checks no sooner than next year, before the midterm
congressional election.  Most gun-restriction measures are opposed by Republicans,
while Democratic supporters haven’t won over colleagues facing a
potential backlash from the gun lobby.  “There’s not going to be any policy change until there’s a
different composition in Congress,” said John Hudak, a fellow
at the nonpartisan  Brookings Institution  in Washington.  Bus Tour  The groups, though, are heating up their campaigns.   Mayors
Against Illegal Guns  aired television ads July 20 marking the
one-year anniversary of the shootings at a movie theater in
Aurora, Colorado, where 12 died and 58 were injured, featuring
survivor Stephen Barton.  The ads ran in the states of senators who didn’t support
the background-check bill. The group was co-founded by  New York 
Mayor  Michael Bloomberg , who is founder and majority owner of
Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP.  The mayors group is in the midst of a bus tour to 25 states
over 100 days, with gun-violence survivors and their families,
 law enforcement  and local advocates. This week, the tour was in
 Ohio , which had 6,192 guns for sale online by private parties --
the largest number among 10 states surveyed, according to Third
Way.  Raising Money  Advocates are raising money for another legislative push.
 Mark Kelly , a former astronaut and Giffords’s husband, predicted
that the seven-month-old, Washington-based Americans for
Responsible Solutions, which has taken in more than $11 million,
will raise more than the average $18 million to $20 million that
the  National Rifle Association  spends per election cycle. The
 NRA  is the nation’s biggest gun lobby.  “This is an area where a lot of people can coalesce, even
if they say they’re opposed to gun-violence prevention,” said
Senator  Richard Blumenthal , a Connecticut Democrat who’s joined
with Newtown families in pushing legislation. “There is a core
group of senators, including myself, that is determined to seek
another vote.”  The 1993 Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act sought to
require background checks for most firearm purchases by
mandating screenings for all commercial sales at gun stores.  The new data on gun buyers evading background checks over
the Internet is fueling the advocates’ efforts.  “The center of activity for prohibited purchasers has
clearly shifted to the Internet, for obvious reasons,” said
Mark Glaze, director of the mayors’ group. “No background
check, no questions asked, no paper trail -- all in the dark.”  The Third Way study found 15,768 sale ads listed by private
sellers on Armslist.com. Of these ads, 5,136 postings were for
semi-automatic weapons, including assault weapons, and 1,928 of
the ads were from prospective buyers looking to purchase
firearms from private sellers, the report said.  ‘Really Scary’  “It’s really scary when you look through the online want-ads seeking private sellers,” said Lanae Erickson, a policy
director at Third Way. “Why would you need to buy it from a
private seller unless you are trying to get around the
background check?”  The Third Way analysis covered gun sales in 10 states
during June and July. These are states represented by senators
who had been sought by anti-gun violence advocates as potential
supporters of expanded background checks, including Republicans
Rob Portman of Ohio,  Kelly Ayotte  of New Hampshire, Jeff Flake
of Arizona,  Johnny Isakson  of Georgia and Democrats Mark Pryor
of Arkansas and  Mark Begich  of Alaska.  ‘In Danger’  This week’s report by Giffords’s group documents the case
of a man with Asperger’s syndrome from Nevada who ended up
purchasing a gun from Reno police Sergeant Laura Conklin on
Armslist.com. According to the man’s mother, Jill Schaller, who
reported the transfer, it “put her family in danger and could
have ended her son’s life,” the report said.  A sampling of Armslist.com postings shows the ease with
which weapons are obtained.  Trades occur with the click of a mouse and then a meeting.
One listing for an M44 carbine bolt action rifle highlighted by
Third Way advertised: “You can avoid the background check and
taxes by taking this rifle off my hands for $250.”  Perry Tarrant, a police captain in Tucson, Arizona, who has
worked in law enforcement for 33 years, said the Internet has
compounded the gun violence in his state.  “Historically, we’ve always thought of Arizona as being
the Wild West and a very strong gun culture,” he said in an
interview. “The Internet is an even wilder West. Behind a
computer, the origin of a seller can be anywhere around the
world.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
