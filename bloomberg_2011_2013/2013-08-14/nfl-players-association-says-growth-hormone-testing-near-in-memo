The National Football League and its
players union tentatively agreed to test 40 blood samples for
human growth hormone each week of the season and suspend
violators for four games,  according to a memo  from the NFL
Players Association.  A computer will randomly select five players from eight
teams each week for testing, with the results stored until the
completion of a “population study” to determine what level of
HGH should result in penalties, the union said in the Q&A, which
was posted on its website.  “Once the decision limit is determined, the results will
be compared with the decision limit,” the memo said. “If a
player’s blood sample produced a result above the decision
limit, that is a positive test, and that player will be
disciplined.”  The league and union cleared the way for HGH testing as
part of a 10-year collective bargaining agreement signed in
August 2011 and have debated various details ever since.  NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said in an e-mail that the two
sides “do not have yet a comprehensive agreement for HGH
testing” and declined further comment on the union memo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
