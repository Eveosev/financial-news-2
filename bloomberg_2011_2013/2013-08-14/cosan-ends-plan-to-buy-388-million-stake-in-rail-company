Cosan SA Industria & Comercio
abandoned plans to pay 896.5 million reais ($388 million) for a
5.67 percent stake in Latin America’s largest railroad company,
a setback for its plan to focus on infrastructure.  Talks to acquire a stake in  All America Latina Logistica SA (ALLL3) 
“ended without the transaction coming to fruition,” the Sao
Paulo-based company said in a statement today. The company
agreed in February 2012 to buy 39 million shares to be part of
the group that controls Curitiba, Brazil-based All America.  Cosan fell 2.4 percent to 40.60 reais at the close in Sao
Paulo. All America rose 8.3 percent to 9.51 reais, the most
since May 2009.  Cosan, a producer of sugar and ethanol, has expanded into
logistics and fuel distribution through 10 acquisitions in the
past five years. Brazilian state-worker pension funds opposed
the sale to Cosan, newspaper Folha de S.Paulo reported in
September.  Cosan, founded by Brazilian billionaire Rubens Ometto,
agreed in 2009 to invest 1.2 billion reais in All America in
return for transport rights.  To contact the reporter on this story:
