Warren Buffett ’s charity auction to
benefit a dropout-prevention program for high school students
was won by a California engineer and businessman for $156,000.  Jack Staub, the Newport Beach resident who made the top
offer yesterday, will get to meet Buffett and take an all-you-can-eat tour of a See’s Candies factory in Los Angeles,
according to a statement today from auction website
Charitybuzz.com. The candy company is owned by the billionaire’s
 Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)   Buffett, the world’s third-richest man, has committed most
of his wealth to charity. He was among celebrities participating
in auctions to benefit Communities In Schools of Los Angeles.
The auctions raised $450,000,  Charitybuzz.com  said. Staub’s
contribution is a tribute to a family friend, Kathy Godshalk,
who died of cancer after teaching in a community college,
according to the statement.  Godshalk showed that “supporting our future generations
through education, caring and guidance makes an enormous
difference,” Staub said. “We would like to keep the cycle
going.”  Staub plans to attend the tour with his wife, Jade, and
their two children, according to the statement. Further
fundraisers to benefit the group will run through September, a
spokeswoman for the auction site said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
