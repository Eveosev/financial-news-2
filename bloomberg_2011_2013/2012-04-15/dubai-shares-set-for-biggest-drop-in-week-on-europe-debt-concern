Saudi Arabia (SABIC) ’s shares slumped the
most in almost eight months on investor concern that  oil prices 
may retreat amid signs the global economic recovery is slowing
and after first-quarter company earnings missed estimates.  Saudi Kayan Petrochemical Co. (KAYAN) , the company 35 percent-owned
by Saudi Basic Industries Corp., lost 6.5 percent after its
first-quarter loss widened.  Saudi Arabian Fertilizer Co. (SAFCO) , the
company known as Safco also part-owned by Saudi Basic, tumbled
to the lowest since February after profit missed analysts’
expectations.  Saudi Arabia ’s  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  fell 2.3
percent, the most since Aug. 20, to 7,348.33, at the 3:30 p.m.
close in  Riyadh .  Crude oil for May delivery fell 0.5 percent last week to
$102.83 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  after Saudi
Arabia’s oil minister said the kingdom is determined to see
lower prices. Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest oil exporter,
derives more than 90 percent of public revenue from oil exports.  “There is a fear that the global economy is slowing down
and with it could take oil prices down too,” said Nabil Farhat,
a partner at Abu Dhabi-based Al Fajer Securities. “Saudi Arabia
will stand to lose if this happens because it has committed a
large budget expenditure, which means that it could have a large
but workable budget deficit.”  Earnings  Emerging-market stocks  declined 1 percent last week and the
 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  retreated 2 percent after Spanish
and Italian bond yields fueled concern  Europe ’s debt crisis is
worsening, while China said its economy expanded 8.1 percent in
the first quarter, the slowest pace since 2009. U.S. employers
added 120,000 jobs in March, less than the median economist
forecast of 205,000 in a Bloomberg survey.  Saudi companies started reporting first-quarter financial
results this month. Saudi Kayan lost the most since Jan. 17,
falling to 17.4 riyals in its 10th day of declines, the longest
stretch of losses on record, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The company’s  quarterly loss  widened to 71 million
riyals ($19 million) from 8.33 million riyals the year earlier.  Safco fell 2.5 percent to 178.5 riyals, the lowest close
since Feb. 22. The company said first-quarter profit declined
5.5 percent to 787 million riyals.  The  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index (BGCC200)  decreased 1.2 percent and the
 DFM General Index (DFMGI)  declined 0.2 percent.  Abu Dhabi ’s  ADX General
Index (ADSMI)  slipped 0.4 percent and Qatar’s  QE Index (DSM)  retreated 0.5
percent. Oman’s benchmark stock  index  rose 0.4 percent and
