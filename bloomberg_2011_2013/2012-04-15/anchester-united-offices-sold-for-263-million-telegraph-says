The London offices of  Manchester
United (MNU)  soccer club were sold for 166 million pounds ($263
million) to a private European investor, the Telegraph reported.  The winning bidder for the offices in Stratton House, put
on sale in January, is thought to be from  Germany  and paid for
the property in cash after beating offers from investors in Asia
and the  Middle East , the British newspaper reported yesterday,
without saying where it got the information.  The building is owned by the  West End  of London Property
Unit Trust, which is managed by Schroders and advised by Grafton
Advisors, the Telegraph said.  Nigel Kempner, head of fund management at Grafton’s parent
company Quintain, confirmed the sale at “an attractive price,”
the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
