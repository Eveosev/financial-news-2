China  will pass the U.S. in 2013 as
the biggest user of tankers carrying oil at sea as Asian imports
travel over longer distances and fewer cargoes go to the world’s
biggest economy, according to Arctic Securities ASA.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows tanker use based on ton-mile
demand, which multiplies cargo size by voyage length, is rising
for China and dropping for the U.S., according to figures from
the Oslo-based investment bank. Chinese tanker usage will gain
18 percent to 2.43 trillion ton-miles by 2013 as the U.S. falls
13 percent to 2.36 trillion, Arctic estimates.  “While U.S. seaborne imports are set to decline as a
result of higher domestic production, falling refinery capacity
on the U.S. East Coast and increased pipeline imports from
 Canada  will have a negative impact on tanker demand,” Erik Nikolai Stavseth, an Arctic analyst, said yesterday by e-mail.  China will account for 25 percent of oil-tanker demand by
2015, against 19 percent for the U.S., according to Arctic. U.S.
seaborne imports of crude will decline to 7.6 million barrels a
day by that year, the lowest level since 1995, from 8.3 million
this year, the bank estimates.  Sunoco Inc. and ConocoPhillips have closed or idled
refineries in  Pennsylvania . Sunoco plans to shut a plant in
Philadelphia by July unless it finds a buyer. Asian refineries
will add a further 4.3 million barrels a day of capacity by the
end of 2015, and newer plants in the region can handle low-grade
 Middle East  and Latin American crudes, Stavseth said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
