The  International Monetary Fund  may
not decide until June whether to provide more money for the
European bailout fund, Spiegel  reported , citing an interview
with Paulo Noguiera Batista, who represents  Brazil  and eight
other South American countries at the IMF.  Batista said he doesn’t expect a decision to be made at
IMF’s spring meeting, adding he thought the provision of more
money is “less than certain,” according to Spiegel.  It is possible that a decision may not be reached before
the G20 summit in June, Spiegel cited Batista as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
