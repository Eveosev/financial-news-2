Rio Tinto Group (RIO)  may spin off its
Pacific Aluminium unit and use debt secured with the assets to
pay shareholders a special dividend, the Independent on Sunday
said, citing a person close to the company it didn’t identify.  The payment may be for as much as A$1 billion ($1.04
billion), with the creation of a separate aluminum company
traded in Australia scheduled for the end of the third quarter,
the newspaper reported.  A spokeswoman for Rio said it’s not in a hurry to divest
the Pacific Aluminium assets and may wait until the economic
climate improves, the Independent said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
