The Swiss National Bankâ€™s Bank
Council on April 13 proposed Thomas Jordan as president of the
central bank and Jean-Pierre Danthine as vice president, NZZ am
Sonntag reported, without saying where it got the information.  The newspaper reported the government will name Jordan as
SNB president on Wednesday and said the third vacancy on the
board will be filled by Fritz Zurbruegg, the head of the Federal
Finance Administration.  Silvia Oppliger, a spokeswoman for the SNB, declined to
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
