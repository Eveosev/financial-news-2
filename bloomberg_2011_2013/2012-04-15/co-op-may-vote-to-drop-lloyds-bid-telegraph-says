The Co-Operative Group Ltd. has
called a meeting of its bank board this week and may discuss
dropping its 1.5 billion-pound ($2.4 billion) bid for  Lloyds
Banking Group Plc (LLOY) ’s Verde branches, the Sunday Telegraph said.  Chief Executive Officer  Peter Marks  will update executives
on talks with the U.K. Financial Services Authority, which wants
to ensure that it has oversight of the entire company after the
merger, the newspaper said. The banking division may make the
decision to drop the offer for the 632 branches, the Telegraph
said, citing an individual it didn’t identify.  “The process in terms of the Verde assets continues,”
Russ Brady, a spokesman for Manchester, England-based Co-
Operative Group said today in a telephone interview. “We’re in
exclusive discussions with Lloyds and those discussions
continue.” It’s a “complex” transaction, he said.  A spokeswoman for Co-Operative Group said separately that a
regular meeting of the bank board is scheduled to take place
this week.  To contact the reporters on this story:
