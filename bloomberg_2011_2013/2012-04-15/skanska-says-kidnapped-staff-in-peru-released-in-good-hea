Skanska AB (SKAB) , the Nordic region’s
biggest construction company, said its employees kidnapped in
 Peru  on April 9 were released.  Peruvian authorities negotiated with the kidnappers,
Skanska said on its  website  today. The abduction occurred in
Kepashiato, near Cusco in Peru, the company said.  “It is hard to express the relief and comfort I feel over
the fact that our colleagues now can reunite with their families
and return home,” Johan Karlstrom, Skanska’s chief executive
officer, said in the statement.  The freed employees are in “good health given the
circumstances,” the company said, declining to elaborate on the
details of their release.  To contact the reporter on this story:
