Support for Spanish Prime Minister
 Mariano Rajoy ’s  People’s Party  fell 8 percentage points in an
opinion poll published by  El Pais  newspaper as his program of
spending cuts and tax hikes deterred voters.  The PP’s support dropped to 38 percent from 46 percent last
month in a poll of 1,000 people conducted April 11-12, El Pais
reported today. Rajoy’s approval rating was 32 percent, the
lowest of the 14-member cabinet, it said. The poll has a margin
of error of 3.2 percent. Rajoy’s budget, published on March 30,
included 37 billion euros ($48 billion) of savings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
