Roland Berger  Strategy Consultants
GmbH doesn’t have enough money to introduce a planned European
ratings agency,  Financial Times Deutschland  reported in a
preview of an article to be published tomorrow, without saying
where it got the information.  The company has failed to gather the 300 million euros
needed to start the agency owing to lobbying from the Federation
of German Industries, according to the FTD. Germany’s coalition
government is also unwilling to fund the project, the FTD cited
Christian Democratic Union Deputy Chairman Michael Meister as
saying.  The plan is not yet dead, since a group of Frankfurt-based
financiers has provided enough funds for the ideas behind the
agency to be developed, FTD said, without citing any sources.  To contact the reporter on this story:
