Virgin Atlantic Ltd. founder
 Richard Branson  said he will lodge an appeal against the
European Union’s approval of British Airways Plc’s acquisition
of Deutsche Lufthansa AG’s BMI brand.  “We will challenge every aspect of this process which, if
allowed to stand, will undoubtedly damage the British airline
industry for years to come,” Branson said in an e-mailed
statement today. “The European Commission has seemingly ignored
all of the strong cases made by politicians, business groups and
airlines, to enable one big company to become even more
bloated.”  While Virgin plans to bid on all 12 of the take-off and
landing slots that  International Consolidated Airlines Group
SA (IAG) ’s British Airways unit has been asked to give up as part of
the merger’s approval, Branson said that won’t be enough to
ensure adequate competition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
