Sage Group Plc (SGE) , the U.K. software
publishing company, is looking for a replacement for Chairman
Tony Hobson who will step down in the next 12 months,  Sky News 
reported.  The company hired the Egon Zehnder agency to look for non-
executive board members who might replace Hobson, Sky News wrote
in a blog posting without saying where it got the information.
Hobson joined the board in 2004 and won’t qualify as an
independent chairman after completing nine years, Sky said.  A spokesman for Sage couldn’t immediately be reached
outside of normal business hours. The company declined to
comment to Sky News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
