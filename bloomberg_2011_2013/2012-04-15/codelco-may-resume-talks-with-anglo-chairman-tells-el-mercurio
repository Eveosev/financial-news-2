Codelco, the world’s largest copper
producer, is open to resuming talks with  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  over
an option to buy a 49 percent stake in Anglo’s Sur unit in
 Chile , Codelco Chairman Gerardo Jofre told El Mercurio.  There aren’t any negotiations going on at the moment, Jofre
told the Santiago-based newspaper in an interview published
today. Codelco won’t settle for a lower stake, Jofre said.  Codelco filed a lawsuit in January to force Anglo into
selling the stake in the Sur unit, which owns the Los Bronces
mine and two unexploited copper deposits. Anglo said in November
it sold 24.5 percent of Sur to  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) , limiting
Codelco’s option to 24.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
