Henderson Global Investors Ltd., La
Francaise Asset Management and a Massachusetts Mutual Life
Insurance Co. unit are moving into European commercial property
lending as the region’s banks reduce 2.4 trillion euros ($3.1
trillion) of real-estate loans they hold by as much as 25
percent.  Insurers, private-equity firms and other non-bank investors
will cover between 100 billion euros and 200 billion euros of
disappearing bank funding over the next three to five years,
according to estimates from  Morgan Stanley (MS)  analysts. That may
still leave a shortfall of as much as 500 billion euros, the
analysts wrote in a report last month, as banks shrink their
balance sheets to satisfy proposed capital regulations.  New entrants are joining insurers  Axa SA (CS) ,  MetLife Inc. (MET)  and
 Allianz SE (ALV)  in seeking to capture the most creditworthy borrowers
or securing loans against the best investment properties such as
London skyscrapers and Munich shopping malls. Banks are likely
to be left with longer-dated debt that hurts their profitability
even as they try and withdraw lending after incurring 532
billion euros of losses since the 2007 credit crisis.  “We can cherry pick and do what we want,” said Isabelle Scemama, head of commercial real-estate finance at Paris-based
Axa Real Estate Investment Managers, which has 2 billion euros
available for lending this year after providing 1.5 billion in
2011. “For the next two or three years, I don’t see any
involvement by the banks.”  Price Declines  Lloyds Banking Group Plc, Eurohypo AG and Societe Generale
SA are among the lenders cutting property funding as regulators
introduce stricter capital rules under an agreement approved by
the  Basel Committee on Banking Supervision , or Basel III, and as
 Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis roils funding markets.  Ninety-four percent of property lenders in Europe expect to
cut loans “moderately” or “substantially” this year,
according to a January survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP,
with the rest indicating lending would remain at the same level.
Morgan Stanley estimates a lending shortfall will help depress
commercial property values that are poised to decline 10 percent
by 2016.  Cornerstone Real Estate Advisers LLC, a Hartford,
Connecticut-based subsidiary of MassMutual that oversees $32
billion, is looking to provide about 300 million pounds ($476
million) of senior loans in the U.K. this year.  “We’re putting our toe in the water,” said Robert Little,
chief investment officer of finance for Cornerstone. “We want
to see what the opportunities are and how rapidly we can
expand.”  Hiring From Banks  Allianz, Europe’s biggest insurer, plans to lend about 1
billion euros in 2012. In the U.K., insurers such as Aviva Plc,
MetLife and  Prudential Plc (PRU)  all plan to lend at least as much as
last year.  AEW Europe, part of Groupe BPCE, is seeking regulatory
approval in  France  to start a senior debt fund with an initial
200 million euros to lend in the second half, said Schalk Visser, the money manager’s head of  investor relations .  La Francaise Asset Management hired Bertrand Carrez, a
former Natixis SA banker, as head of structured finance last
month. The insurance arm of the money manager’s 80 percent
shareholder, Credit Mutuel Nord Europe, earmarked as much as 300
million euros earlier this year for property lending and La
Francaise plans to have a fund open to other investors operating
by the third quarter, Carrez said.  Henderson hired John Feeney March 2 from Bank of America
Merrill Lynch as head of a new real-estate debt team. Cordea
Savills, the asset management arm of  Savills Plc (SVS) , also hired
Keith Davidson and James Tarry last month from Palatium
Investment Management to spearhead its push into real-estate
lending.  ‘Reshaping’ Capital Markets  “It’s the early stages of a reshaping of the real-estate
debt  capital markets ,” said Natale Giostra, head of  CBRE Group
Inc. (CBG) ’s European debt advisory unit.  Banks account for as much as 94 percent of property loans
in Europe, made directly or by underwriting sales of covered
bonds that remain on their balance sheets as a liability, DTZ
Holdings Plc. estimates. That contrasts with the U.S., where
insurers provide about 20 percent of commercial real-estate
loans and collateralized mortgage-backed securities take a
similar share.  As banks reined in senior loans in the past two years,
dozens of funds and lenders began offering junior and mezzanine
finance, which ranks after senior debt in a default. When the
retreat in senior lending turned into a rout, their
opportunities also diminished, PwC Real Estate Funds Partner
John Forbes said.  “If there’s no senior debt, all the mezzanine funds can
offer is a restructuring option,” he said.  London Recovering  The U.K. has seen the biggest growth in lending by insurers
among European countries because  London  was one of the first
markets to recover from the property market slump triggered by
the credit crisis. Britain has the second-highest level of real-
estate debt in Europe after  Spain , according to the European
Banking Authority.  U.K. bank lending may get scarcer if the Financial Services
Authority proceeds with a plan to introduce a stricter
classification of loans and increase the amount of capital that
banks must set aside against them. The new rules, which would
take effect in the second half, may force banks to raise an
additional 40 billion pounds to cover losses for bad property
loans, according to Andrew Petersen, a London-based partner at
law firm K&L Gates LLP.  Insurers with lending teams already in place, such as the
U.K.’s Prudential, say the number of approaches from investors
looking to put money into lending are picking up.  Client Interest  “We continue to receive a number of inquiries from clients
about the attractiveness of this sector and I’m hopeful that in
the future we may be investing on behalf of others as well as
for the Pru,” said John Barakat, head of real-estate finance at
M&G Ltd., a Prudential unit. M&G already makes junior and
mezzanine loans for external investors.  Banks have made loans more expensive by requiring borrowers
to make larger down payments and pay higher  interest rates .
Insurers lending in the U.K. charge 20 basis points to 30 basis
points less interest than the average,  CBRE said . A basis point
is 0.01 of a percentage point.  Senior loans, which rank first in line in the event of a
default, cost borrowers 200 basis points to 600 basis points
more than benchmarks. That appeals to life insurance companies
or pension funds, particularly those making annuity payments to
investors.  “Real-estate loans match up very nicely with the long-term
liabilities we write as an insurer,” said Robert Merck,
MetLife’s senior managing director and global head of property
investments. “We are off to a very good start this year” after
lending about $800 million in the U.K. last year, he said.  Introduce Penalties  Insurers, which tend to hold loans to maturity, have been
able to introduce penalties such as claw backs for lost interest
income for early repayments.  “Early repayment is a key concern for us,” Scemama said.
Such penalties were a harder sell when Axa first started real-
estate lending in 2005, she said.  Some non-bank lenders are also prepared to offer longer
terms than typical five- to seven-year property loans.  Aviva Plc (AV/) 
provided South African billionaire Nathan Kirsh 145 million
pounds on a 20-year term earlier last month to fund about half
the cost of his purchase of Tower 42, the first skyscraper built
in the  City of London  financial district.  Long-Term Partnerships  “We don’t want to lend to people who just want the
money,” said Kevin Sale, head of the Aviva team that provided
about 1 billion pounds of property and infrastructure loans last
year. “We’re looking to work in partnership with long-term
investors with a horizon of 15 years or more.”  Insurers are choosing to lend against only the best
properties, leaving the majority of owners in need of finance
for their non-prime properties, CBRE Managing Director of Real
Estate Finance Philip Cropper said.  “They are very focused on assets that they would want to
buy as an equity investor, so they’re only looking at good-
quality institutional-style investment properties,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
