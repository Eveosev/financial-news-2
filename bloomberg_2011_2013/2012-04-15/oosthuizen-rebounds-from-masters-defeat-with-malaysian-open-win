Louis Oosthuizen rebounded from his
playoff defeat to Bubba Watson at last week’s  Masters Tournament 
by winning golf’s Malaysian Open.  The South African shot a final-round 4-under-par 68 at
Kuala Lumpur Golf & Country Club to finish three strokes ahead
of Scotland’s Stephen Gallacher at 17-under for the tournament,
which is co-sanctioned by the European and Asian Tours.  The 29-year-old Oosthuizen lost to Watson on the second
hole of a sudden-death playoff seven days ago at the Masters in
Augusta,  Georgia . He finished third at the Houston Open the
previous week.  “It was a long journey to get here and I have to be honest
and say that I didn’t expect to play this well because of the
tiredness,” Oosthuizen said in comments on the European Tour’s
 website . “The one thing I did know was that the game was there
so that helped a lot. I am over the moon with the result.”  The victory, Oosthuizen’s fifth on the European Tour and
first in  Asia , was his second this year after winning the
season-opening Africa Open in East London,  South Africa .  The European Tour stays in Asia next week with the China
Open at Binhai Lake Golf Club in Tianjin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
