Tesco Plc (TSCO) , the U.K.’s largest
supermarket chain, is planning an online store that would
compete with  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) , the Sunday Telegraph said.  Chief Executive Officer Philip Clarke will announce plans
to add more third-party retailers to Tesco’s website on April 18
to expand its click-and-collect service, the newspaper said. The
new initiative will also include remodeling of some stores.  To contact the reporter on this story:
