The Bank of  Korea  lowered its
economic growth forecast for the year amid volatile  oil prices 
and persistent worries about  Europe ’s debt crisis while its
inflation projection was also trimmed.  Asia ’s fourth-largest economy will expand 3.5 percent in
2012, compared with the 3.7 percent growth estimated in December,
the central bank said today in a statement.  Consumer prices  are
expected to rise 3.2 percent, lower than an earlier forecast of
a 3.3 percent gain.  The Bank of Korea kept borrowing costs unchanged for a 10th
straight month last week as  North Korea  launched a rocket and
austerity measures in developed economies limit demand for
exports. The central bank said last week that the economy has
shown signs of a moderate recovery, with consumption and
construction investment increasing, and will return to its long-
term growth path gradually.  “The Korean economy will post a growth rate of around 1
percent in the first half of 2012, pulling out of its sluggish
0.3 percent growth during the fourth quarter of last year,” the
 Bank of Korea  said in its statement “From the latter half,
economic activity is expected to show an uptrend, albeit modest,
with the growth rate picking up to the low 1 percent range.”  The won gained 0.5 percent to close at 1,135.00 per dollar
in  Seoul  on April 13, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The Kospi stock index rose the most in a month, gaining 1.1
percent to 2,008.91.  Won Forecast  “The BOK governor’s comments at the April 13 press
conference were moderately more hawkish, in our view,
highlighting its endeavors to lower inflation expectations,”
 Kwon Goohoon , an economist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in Seoul,
said in a note on April 13. “We do not expect the normalization
stance to be changed.”  Kwon said Goldman has rolled forward its three-month
forecast to 1,110 won per dollar from 1,150 won per dollar on
the end of the adverse seasonality in the current account,
declines in policy uncertainties after the surprise win in
general elections by the ruling party, and the likelihood of
further relaxation of monetary policy in the U.S. and  China .  Consumer prices rose 2.6 percent in March from a year 
earlier, the slowest pace in 20 months. Subsidies for child
care and an expanded free school lunch program cut price 
gains by 0.5 percentage points, with a similar effect to
last until February 2013, according to Ahn Hyung Jun, a 
director at Statistics Korea.  Growth Expectations  Next year,  economic growth  will likely accelerate to 4.2
percent while inflation will moderate to 3.1 percent, the
central bank said today. Core prices, excluding oil and
agricultural products, will rise 2.6 percent this year and 3.2
percent next year.  The  current-account surplus  is expected to narrow to $12.5
billion next year from $14.5 billion this year, the Bank of
Korea said. It also projected 350,000 jobs will be created this
year and 320,000 jobs next year, with an  unemployment rate  at
3.3 percent each year.  Governor Kim Choong Soo and his board held the benchmark
 seven-day repurchase rate  at 3.25 percent last week. The 
unanimous rate decision was predicted by all 13 economists 
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  “The easing of uncertainties related to the euro sovereign
debt problems act as a positive factor for economic growth,”
the central bank said in today’s statement. “Downside factors
for growth predominate such as the downward revision of the
world economic growth rate and higher oil import prices.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
