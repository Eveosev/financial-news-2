Boston Red Sox outfielder  Jacoby Ellsbury  was placed on the 15-day disabled list with a partial
dislocation of his right shoulder, General Manager  Ben Cherington  said.  The Red Sox yesterday recalled outfielder Che-Hsuan Lin
from Triple-A Pawtucket.  Ellsbury, 28, sustained a shoulder subluxation during the
fourth inning of the Red Soxâ€™s 12-2 victory over the Tampa Bay
Rays on April 13. During the first seven games of the season, he
was 5-for-26 with two doubles, three runs batted in, four runs
and four walks.  Lin, 23, in his first Major League Baseball appearance
yesterday, has played in six games with the minor-league club
this season. He was 3-for-20 with a double, home run, three
walks and a stolen base. A native of  Taiwan , Lin signed with the
Red Sox as an international free agent on June 8, 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
