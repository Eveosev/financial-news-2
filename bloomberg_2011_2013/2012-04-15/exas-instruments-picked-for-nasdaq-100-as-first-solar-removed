Texas Instruments Inc. (TXN)  was picked
to replace  First Solar Inc. (FSLR)  in the Nasdaq-100 Index, four months
after the chipmaker became the biggest company to switch its
listing to the Nasdaq Stock Market from the New York Stock
Exchange.  The worldâ€™s largest maker of analog semiconductors will
join the index before the start of trading on April 23, Nasdaq
OMX Group Inc. said in an April 13 statement. Texas Instruments,
based in  Dallas , has a market value of $36.8 billion, making it
bigger than all but 17 of the 100 companies already in the
index, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The Nasdaq-100 serves as the basis for the PowerShares QQQ
Trust, the U.S. exchange-traded fund with the fifth-highest
average daily trading volume in 2012, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Texas Instruments shares have advanced 11 percent in 2012,
compared with the 38 percent retreat by Tempe, Arizona-based
First Solar. The  Nasdaq-100 Index (NDX)  has rallied 18 percent and
closed at the highest level since December 2000 on April 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
