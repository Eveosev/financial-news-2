The top fundraiser in U.K. Prime
Minister  David Cameron ’s Conservative Party added his voice to
criticism of the government’s plans to cap tax relief on
charitable donations, the Sunday Times newspaper reported.  Stanley Fink said the proposal would “put people off”
giving large sums, the Times said, without specifying where it
obtained the information.  Under the proposals announced by Chancellor of the
Exchequer George Osborne in last month’s budget, tax relief,
including on charitable giving, will be capped at 50,000 pounds
($79,000) a year or a quarter of an individual’s income,
whichever is higher. It’s part of a drive to cut  tax avoidance .  To contact the reporter on this story:
