Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  management
will abstain from taking a position on the bank’s compensation
report at the annual general meeting on April 27, Der Sonntag
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Chief Executive Officer Brady Dougan’s compensation was cut
55 percent in 2011 to 5.82 million francs ($6.3 million). The
highest-paid member on Credit Suisse’s executive board was
asset-management head Robert Shafir with 8.5 million francs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
