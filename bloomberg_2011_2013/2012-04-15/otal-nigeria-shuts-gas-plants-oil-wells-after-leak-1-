Total E&P Nigeria Ltd. shut gas
plants and oil wells in Obite, Rivers State, in the country’s
oil-rich southern delta, following a leak at one of its
facilities.  The leak at a gas plant probably followed an incident
during drilling on March 20, the Nigeria unit of  Total SA (FP)  said
in an e-mailed statement today.  The company is working “to ensure the protection of
communities and personnel and to limit the impact on the
environment,” according to the e-mail.  Nigeria produced 2.14 million barrels a day of crude in
March, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSA) ,  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , Chevron Corp., Total SA and Eni
SpA run joint ventures with the state oil company that pump more
than 90 percent of the country’s crude oil.  Total holds a license for the OML 58 project in the delta
region in a joint venture with the state oil company Nigerian
National Petroleum Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
