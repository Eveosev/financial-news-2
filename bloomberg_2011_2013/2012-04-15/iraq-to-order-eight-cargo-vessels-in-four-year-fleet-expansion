Iraq  will offer contracts for the
construction of eight cargo ships over the next four years in an
effort to expand its fleet, the director general of the state
naval transport company said.  The government expects in the next two weeks to take
delivery of a $14 million cargo vessel built by Avic Dingheng
Shipbuilding Co. of  China , Sameer Abdul Razzaq said in a
telephone interview today in Baghdad. The ship, named the
“Baghdad,” will have a loading capacity of 7,800 metric tons,
he said.  Iraq signed a $73 million contract in December with  South
Korea ’s Daesun Shipbuilding & Engineering Co. for three vessels
due for delivery in 26 months, he said.  The Iraqi government owns a single serviceable cargo ship,
Razzaq said. The country’s other ships either sank or fell into
disrepair after taking refuge outside Iraq during the 1990  Gulf
War , he said. Iraq holds the world’s fifth-largest crude
deposits and is seeking to rebuild its economy and
infrastructure after decades of conflict and sanctions.  To contact the reporters on this story:
