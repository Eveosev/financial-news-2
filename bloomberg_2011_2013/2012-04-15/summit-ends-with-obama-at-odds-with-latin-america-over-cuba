President  Barack Obama  and leaders
from Latin America failed to issue a statement at the end of a
summit in Colombia over the U.S.’s refusal to invite Cuba to the
next such regional gathering, a U.S. official said.  “We have been clear that we look forward to a democratic
Cuba’s participation in the Summit process,” U.S. National
Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor told reporters in
Cartagena, where the Summit of Americas took place. “Sadly that
day hasn’t come.”  Host  Juan Manuel Santos , who briefed reporters at the end
of talks by 31 heads of state, said he hoped Cuba would attend
the next summit that Panama has “offered” to host in 2015.  That sentiment is shared by leaders throughout  Latin
America  who’ve been lobbying to overturn a ban that has kept
Cuba from participating in every summit since the first one was
held in Miami in 1994. The U.S. and  Canada  have pushed back,
arguing that the region’s sole dictatorship needs to implement
democratic reforms before it can be welcomed.  President  Rafael Correa  of Ecuador decided to boycott the
summit in solidarity with Cuba while Nicaraguan President Daniel
Ortega, an ally of the communist island, also skipped the
gathering at the last minute. More American-friendly governments
like Brazil and Colombia have said this should be the last
Summit of the Americas without Cuba.  To contact the reporters on this story:
