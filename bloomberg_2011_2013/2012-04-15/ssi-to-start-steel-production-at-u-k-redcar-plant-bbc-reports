Sahaviriya Steel Industries Pcl (SSI) 
plans to begin steel production at its plant in Redcar,
northeast England, the British Broadcasting Corp. reported,
citing the firm’s U.K. chief, Phil Dryden.  The first steel slabs will probably be produced in the next
three days, with all the steel produced initially being shipped
to Thailand, the BBC said on its website. Many of the plant’s
1,600 employees who lost their jobs when it was shuttered two
years ago have been rehired, the BBC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
