Egyptian lawmakers, political
parties and the country’s military ruler will meet April 22 to
discuss the composition of the committee charged with drafting a
constitution, in a push to get the nation’s transition to
civilian rule back on track, the state-run Middle East  News
Agency  reported today.  The announcement came after more than a dozen heads of
political parties met with Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi
about the constitution drafting committee following an
administrative court ruling that effectively suspended the 100-
person panel because of its membership.  That ruling undercut hopes the document would be completed
before a new president is elected in May or June and the
handover of power to a civilian administration occurs as
scheduled by July 1.  Now, the members of the committee will be entirely from
outside of parliament, MENA said, citing Emad Abdel-Ghafour,
head of the Salafist Al-Nour party.  The panel had drawn fire from secularists and independents
who claimed that it was dominated by the Islamists who control
parliament. About 60 percent of the committee was made up of
members of the Muslim Brotherhood’s Freedom and Justice Party,
the Al-Nour Party and independents who sympathized with them,
stoking concerns that others’ views would be sidelined.  To contact the reporter on this story:
