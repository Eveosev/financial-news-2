LeBron James  and Dwyane Wade
combined for 57 points as the Miami Heat beat the Knicks 93-85
to halt New York’s nine-game home winning streak.  The Heat offset a 42-point performance from New York’s
Carmelo Anthony to sweep the three-game regular season series
against the Knicks, who may be Miami’s first-round opponent in
the National Basketball Association playoffs.  The Heat (42-17), who are second in the Eastern Conference,
3 1/2 games behind the Chicago Bulls, closed yesterday’s game at
New York’s Madison Square Garden with an 18-6 scoring run to
improve to 5-8 on the road since March.  “I don’t think it means anything for the postseason,”
Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said of the win. “What it means is
something about us and how we’ve been playing on the road as of
late. We want to do a better job of it.”  The Knicks (31-29) drop a spot to eighth in the standings,
two games ahead of the  Milwaukee Bucks  in the race for the final
postseason berth. The Philadelphia 76ers are in seventh place in
the East, half a game ahead of the Knicks, who have six regular-
season games left.  “We’ll be fine,” Knicks coach  Mike Woodson  told reporters
after his first home loss since replacing  Mike D’Antoni . “We’ll
rebound from this and learn from it and hopefully be better.”  James finished with 29 points and 10 rebounds for the Heat,
while Wade contributed 28 points and nine rebounds, and Chris Bosh scored 16 points and had 14 rebounds.  Anthony, who had his second 40-point performance in a week,
also had nine rebounds for New York, which is playing without
the injured Amar’e Stoudemire and Jeremy Lin.  Bucks Lose  The Bucks (29-31), who lost 105-99 to the Indiana Pacers
yesterday, next play the Washington Wizards on April 18. The
76ers play the Orlando Magic today.  The Knicks’ next game is tomorrow against the  Boston
Celtics , who have already clinched a playoff berth.  New York 
also has road games against the Nets,  Cleveland Cavaliers ,
 Atlanta Hawks  and Charlotte Bobcats, and a home meeting with the
Los Angeles Clippers.  The Los Angeles Lakers won their fourth straight game
without Kobe Bryant, beating the Dallas Mavericks 112-108 in
overtime as Andrew Bynum had 23 points and 16 rebounds.  The Celtics sent the Bobcats to a 16th straight loss,
winning 94-82 behind a 20-point, 16-assist effort from Rajon Rondo, while the Bulls beat the  Detroit Pistons  for the 15th
time in a row, 100-94 in overtime.  The Magic clinched a playoff berth with a 100-84 win over
the Cavaliers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
