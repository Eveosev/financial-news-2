Chelsea beat Tottenham 5-1 today to
reach the final of English soccer’s F.A. Cup for a fourth time
in six years.  Didier Drogba,  Juan Mata , Ramires,  Frank Lampard  and
Florent Malouda scored for the Blues at Wembley Stadium in
London to set up a meeting at the same venue with Liverpool on
May 5. Television replays showed that Mata’s shot for the second
goal didn’t cross the line.  Chelsea has played in the final on 10 previous occasions,
winning the title six times. Seven-time champion Liverpool beat
city rival Everton 2-1 yesterday to secure its spot.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
