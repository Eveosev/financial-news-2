Argentina’s government has decided
to postpone a planned state takeover of  YPF SA (YPFD) , the country’s
largest oil company, La Nacion  reported .  The government of President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner 
will wait until she returns from the Summit of the Americas to
make an announcement and will negotiate with the parties
involved, the Buenos Aires-based newspaper said, citing
unidentified people within the government.  A telephone call and e-mails to the Argentine government’s
press office by Bloomberg News seeking comment went unanswered.
YPF is controlled by Repsol YPF SA, Spain’s largest energy
company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
