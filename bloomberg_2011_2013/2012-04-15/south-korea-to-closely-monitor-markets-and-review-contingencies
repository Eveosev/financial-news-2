South Korea  will closely monitor
financial markets and review contingency plans after North
 Korea ’s failed rocket launch brought the peninsula’s
geopolitical risk back into focus, the  finance ministry  said
today.  The launch of the long-range rocket on April 13 had
“limited” impact on the South Korean financial markets and the
economy, according to an e-mailed statement from the finance
ministry today. South Korea will take necessary steps to prevent
any sudden market changes, the statement said.  South Korea’s won rebounded and stocks rallied on April 13
after North Korea’s state media confirmed the rocket failed. The
Kospi stock index  rose  the most in a month, while the won gained
0.5 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The  Bank
of Korea  held the benchmark borrowing costs at 3.25 percent for
the 10th straight month.  “Given the past provocations by North Korea, our financial
markets tended to recover from a shock in three to seven days,”
the BOK governor Kim Choong Soo told reporters in Seoul on April
13.  Officials including the vice finance minister Shin Je-Yoon,
the vice chairman of the Financial Services Commission Choo Kyung Ho and Park Won Shik, the senior deputy governor from the
Bank of Korea attended today’s meeting to review impact of the
North’s actions, according to the statement.  Kim Jong Un’s regime celebrated the 100th anniversary of
the birth of state founder Kim Il Sung today with a military
parade in the capital Pyongyang.  To contact the reporter on this story:
