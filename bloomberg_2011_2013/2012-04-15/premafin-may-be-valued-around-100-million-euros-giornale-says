Advisers to  Fondiaria-SAI SpA (FSA)  and
 Unipol Gruppo Finanziario SpA (UNI)  may value  Premafin Finanziaria SpA (PF) 
within a range of 60 million euros ($78.5 million) to 120
million euros, il Giornale  reported .  That may pave the way for “more generous” terms in the
share exchange ratio of a broader merger plan involving the
three, Giornale said, citing unidentified officials who attended
a meeting of the companies.  Unipol, Italy’s No. 3 insurer, Premafin, Fondiaria and its
unit  Milano Assicurazioni SpA (MI)  plan to merge to become Italy’s
second-biggest insurer after  Assicurazioni Generali SpA. (G)   To contact the reporter on this story:
