Irish voters approval for the
European Fiscal Treaty would help boost investment in the
country, Deputy Prime Minister  Eamon Gilmore  said in an
interview with RTE today.  “One of the big questions in making investment decisions
in Ireland is: ‘What about the Euro’,” said Gilmore, whose
government is holding a referendum on the treaty next month.
“It is in our national interests that we remove that
uncertainty,” he said, adding that a “yes” vote would be
“important if we were ever to seek assistance again from
 Europe .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
