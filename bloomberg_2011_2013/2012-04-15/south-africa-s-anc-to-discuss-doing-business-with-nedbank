Black business organizations said
criticism levelled at  South Africa ’s political leaders by
 Nedbank Group Ltd. (NED) ’s chairman was “unjustified and untimely,”
and could have been raised in a more constructive manner.  Reuel Khoza, who is black and has been chairman of South
Africa’s fourth-largest bank since 2006, wrote in its  annual
report  last month that the “moral quotient” of political
leaders is “degenerating” and that there is an “emergence of
a strange breed of leaders determined to undermine the rule of
law and override the Constitution.” His remarks have been
criticized by several senior government officials.  “The government, under the leadership of President Zuma,
has been very open and amenable to a constructive, yet frank
dialogue with all social partners, including organised
business,” the Black Business Council said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday. “The grave reservations that Nedbank may
harbour about how our country is led could have been raised more
constructively.”  The council was formed last year to increase the
participation of black people in  Africa ’s largest economy.  Nedbank doesn’t plan to comment further on Khoza’s
comments, Thulani Sibeko, a spokesman for the lender, said by
telephone on April 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
