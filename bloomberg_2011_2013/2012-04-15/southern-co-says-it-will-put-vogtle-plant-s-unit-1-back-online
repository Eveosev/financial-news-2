Southern Co. (SO)  said Unit 1 of the
Alvin W. Vogtle nuclear power plant in  Georgia  will be brought
back online after workers responded to a water pump issue.  The unit was taken offline yesterday at about 1:30 p.m.
local time, Atlanta-based Southern said in a statement today.
Unit 2 at the plant is running at 100 percent, the company said.  Unit 1 is expected to return to full power once restart
criteria are met, according to the statement.  The plant is near the town of Waynesboro, close to the
South Carolina border.  To contact the reporter on this story:
