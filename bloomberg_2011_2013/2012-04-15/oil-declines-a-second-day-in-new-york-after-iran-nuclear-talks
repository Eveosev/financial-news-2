Oil fell a second day after the
first international talks in 15 months on  Iran’s nuclear program 
yielded an agreement to reconvene in May.  Futures declined as much as 0.9 percent in New York after
sliding 0.5 percent last week. United Nations Security Council
members including the U.S., U.K.,  China , France and Russia plus
Germany will meet Iranian delegates in Baghdad on May 23
following “constructive” talks in Istanbul on April 14, the
European Union’s foreign policy chief said yesterday. Oil has
advanced this year on concern that tension with Iran will
disrupt global supplies.  “The flavor of those talks did seem a little more positive
than the rhetoric of the past,” said  David Lennox , an analyst
at Fat Prophets in Sydney. “Between $90 and $100 a barrel would
appear to be a fair value” for West Texas Intermediate prices
without the  Iran  premium, he said.  Crude for May delivery slipped as much as 97 cents to
$101.86 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  and was at $101.97 at 3:17 p.m. Singapore
time. The contract fell 0.8 percent to $102.83 on April 13, the
lowest close since April 11. Prices are up 3.2 percent this year.  Brent oil for June settlement dropped $1.39, or 1.2 percent,
to $119.82 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. The European benchmark contract’s front-month premium
to New York-traded West Texas Intermediate was at $17.34,
compared with $19 on April 13.  Iran Talks  The talks in Istanbul lasted 10 hours and were also
described as constructive by the Iran’s lead negotiator, Saeed Jalili. The Islamic Republic dropped upfront demands, and the
discussions focused almost exclusively on the nation’s nuclear
program, according to two Western diplomats involved. Israel’s
Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  criticized the outcome as
giving Iran more time to continue enriching uranium, the process
capable of producing fuel for a nuclear bomb.  Oil also came under pressure as the Bank of Korea lowered
its 2012 growth and inflation forecasts. Asia’s fourth-largest
economy will expand 3.5 percent in 2012, compared with the 3.7
percent estimated in December, the central bank said today in a
statement.  South Korea’s Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan urged members
of the Group of 20 nations in a letter to address the increase
in crude prices at their meeting in  Washington  next week.  New York  crude has technical support along its 100-day
moving average at around $101.73 a barrel today, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Buy orders tend to be clustered near
chart-support levels. Stochastic oscillators have been below a
reading of 30 for the past week, signaling further losses may
not be sustainable.  Bullish Bets  Hedge funds  reduced bullish oil wagers by 24,860, or 11
percent, to 191,827 contracts in the seven days ended April 10,
according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s
Commitment of Traders report on April 13.  Nigeria’s Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta
rebel group threatened to mount “sustained strikes on all
pipelines and facilities remotely related to the Nigerian oil
industry,” according to a statement from the group on April 14.
Nigeria is Africa’s top producer. Attacks by militant groups cut
the country’s crude output by more than 28 percent between 2006
and 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “There’s certainly a supply-disruption premium of around
about $10 to $15 a barrel in the  oil prices  at the moment,”
 Mark Pervan , head of commodity research at  Australia & New
Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  in  Melbourne , said in Bloomberg
Television interview. “We’ve also got bubbling issues in North
Africa. There’s enough in the market there I think for investors
to want to stay long from a supply point of view.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
