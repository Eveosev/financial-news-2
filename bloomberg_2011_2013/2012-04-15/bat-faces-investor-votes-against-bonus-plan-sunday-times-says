British American Tobacco Plc (BATS)  faces
shareholder opposition to long-term incentive payments for Chief
Executive Officer Nicandro Durante, the Sunday Times reported,
citing investors that it didn’t identify.  Several shareholders will oppose an increase in the amount
that could be earned as a long-term reward without tougher
performance targets, the newspaper said.  BAT said the decision to amend the long-term incentive plan
was made after a compensation committee review, consultation
with shareholders and a vote at last year’s annual meeting.  “We’re a company that has been successfully pursuing a
consistent strategy that is building long term shareholder value
and achieving sustainable results in both good and bad economic
times,” Kate Matrunola, a spokeswoman for London-based BAT,
said in an e-mailed statement today. “Last year’s share price
appreciation, of over 20 percent, is testament to this.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
