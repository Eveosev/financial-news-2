President  Barack Obama  said the
U.S. will remain on the sidelines in the dispute between the
U.K. and Argentina over the Falkland Islands.  “We’re going to remain neutral,” Obama said at a news
conference with Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos as the
Summit of the Americas concluded in Cartagena. “This is not
something that we typically intervene in.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
