Firefighters in  Egypt  extinguished
a blaze that left one person dead and several injured at El-Nasr
Petroleum Co. in Suez, the state-run Middle East News Agency
reported.  The Oil Ministry said the blaze began in a naphtha storage
tank late yesterday. Emergency crews put out fires at three out
of the four tanks, Hani Dahi, chairman of state-run Egyptian
General Petroleum Co., said in an e-mailed statement.  The blaze won’t affect local fuel supplies because naphtha
stored there was for export, Dahi said. Naphtha is a refined oil
product used as a petrochemical feedstock or as an additive to
gasoline. The statement didn’t say what caused the fire nor did
it give details of the damage.  The military deployed four helicopters to support the
firefighters, the  news agency  reported earlier, citing the
province’s governor, Major General Hisham Abdel- Moneim.  To contact the reporters on this story:
