Dole Food Co. (DOLE) , the worldâ€™s largest
producer of fresh fruits and vegetables, is voluntarily
recalling some of its Seven Lettuces salads due to possible
salmonella contamination, the company said.  No illnesses have been reported in the 15 states where the
765 cases of salad had been distributed, Dole said yesterday in
a statement. The step was precautionary after a random sample in
New York state tested positive for the bacteria, the company
said.  Shares of  Westlake Village , California-based Dole fell 1
percent last week in New York to $9.65 a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
