Barclays Plc (BARC)  will pledge to consult
investors on large one-time payments to executives, with some
shareholders set to reject its remuneration report, the Sunday
Telegraph reported, without saying where it got the information.  Barclays will also promise greater investor returns in the
future, the newspaper said. The concessions wonâ€™t apply to
awards already granted to Chief Executive Officer Robert
Diamond, the Sunday Telegraph reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
