San Francisco  Giants closer  Brian Wilson  may need season-ending surgery to repair damage to his
right elbow, manager Bruce Bochy said.  “We got bad news on Wilson,” Bochy said yesterday on the
team’s website. “He took an MRI, and it shows structural damage
with his elbow.”  Wilson, 30, already underwent so-called Tommy John surgery
to repair his elbow ligament when he pitched for  Louisiana State
University  in 2003.  “You’re always hopeful to see something else,” Bochy said.
“We’re going to get a second opinion and even a third
opinion.”  Wilson has recorded 171 saves since joining the Giants in
2006. He saved a career-best 48 during San Francisco’s title run
in 2010. He had a 1.81 ERA in 2010, but fell off to 3.11 last
year, when he saved 36 games after starting the year on the
disabled list with an injury to his oblique muscles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
