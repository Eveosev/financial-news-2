Italy ’s Labor Minister Elsa Fornero
warned that if Parliament doesn’t pass a labor reform bill, the
government risks having to “go home,” il Giornale  reported ,
citing comments she made at a conference in Reggio Calabria
yesterday.  “We have decided on one thing: we will go to Parliament
and if the reform doesn’t pass we will go home,” Fornero said
according to the publication. She added the reform plan isn’t
“untouchable” and changes to some parts may be made.  Prime Minister  Mario Monti ’s bill to overhaul Italy’s labor
market was presented to the Senate April 5. Both houses of
parliament will review the measure in the coming weeks and can
offer amendments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
