Russian-art sales in New York, once
boisterous affairs spread over some days and hawking everything
from Tsarist silver to Soviet spacecraft, have shrunk.  This week, Christie’s International and  Sotheby’s (BID)  have one
auction each, focusing on the decorative arts, that may tally
$11.7 million. Russian painting, a category which typically sees
the biggest fireworks, is missing for the first time since at
least 2006.  Christie’s estimates it will raise $2.9 million to $4.3
million from 176 lots today. Sotheby’s 376 lots are forecast to
fetch $5.2 million to $7.4 million tomorrow.  There are many gems among the bronze horsemen, silver cups,
porcelain plates and Faberge clocks. Here are the highlights.  Christie’s  Ivan the Terrible, white-bearded and hunched over in a
carved wooden chair, solemnly regards his younger sixth wife
sleeping on a bed nearby. The scene is enameled on the surface
of a 5-inch-long (12.7 centimeter) box. The central image is
surrounded by elaborate enameled patterns bursting with orange,
purple and blue. The piece has a mark of Feodor Ruckert, a
Faberge work master, and is estimated at $200,000 to $300,000.  A rectangular Faberge desk clock is elegant and chic,
enameled in translucent lilac color. Its shimmering surface is
adorned with entwining silver-gilt wreaths and drooping lily-of-
the-valley blossoms. The clock was originally presented to Baron
Marochetti, the Italian Ambassador in  St. Petersburg  between
1886 and 1900. A nearly identical clock was acquired by  Queen Elizabeth II , according to  Christie’s (CHRS) . The estimate: $150,000 to
$250,000.  A diamond-set maid-of-honor brooch cypher, consisting of
letters M and A beneath the imperial crown, may fetch $70,000 to
$90,000. Designed by famed royal jeweler Hahn, it was presented
to Countess Olga Alexandrovna Nieroth on Oct. 2, 1904. The
letters are the initials of Nicholas II’s mother, Dowager
Empress Maria Feodorovna, and his wife Empress Alexandra
Feodorovna.  Sotheby’s  An enamel cigar box made in 1912 depicts Napoleon Bonaparte
in an overcoat and white suit standing by the burning walls of
Moscow’s Kremlin. Floral patterns frame the central image,
inspired by a painting from Vasili Vereshchagin’s “1812”
series based on the French emperor’s failed Russian campaign.
Estimate: $150,000 to $250,000.  A 4.5-inch gold cigarette case starring a four-carat
diamond and red enamel geometrics was once given as a gift to a
Cossack general by the “grateful” citizens of the Taganrog
district he presided over. It was designed about 1900 by master
jeweler Carl Blank and has an estimate range of $110,000 to
$130,000.  A Faberge lamp, which had belonged to the late banker
Edmond J. Safra and his wife Lily, is forecast to sell for
$100,000 to $150,000. The lamp is adorned with silver-winged
lions at the base and the baluster stem rises from acanthus
leaves, a frequent motif of Corinthian columns.  (Katya Kazakina is a reporter for Muse, the arts and
