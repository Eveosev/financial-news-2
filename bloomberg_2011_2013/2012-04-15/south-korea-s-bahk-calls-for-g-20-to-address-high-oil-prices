South Korea , the world’s fifth-
largest oil importer, urged the Group of 20 Nations to address
the increase in crude prices to help keep the world economy on a
recovery track.  “In our upcoming meeting, I would like to especially ask
for your stronger resolve to address the problem of persistently
soaring  oil prices ,” Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan wrote in a
letter to financial chiefs, released ahead of their Washington
meeting next week. “The G-20 is an ideal group to come up with
ways to stabilize the international oil markets,” he wrote.  Bahk asked the G-20 to affirm commitments oil producers
made last February to continue to ensure adequate supply, and to
further build on those commitments. He suggested the G-20 send a
stronger message that they stand ready to take all action
possible, including commitments by major member countries to
release strategic oil reserves if necessary.  He also said the G-20 could develop more measures to
prevent speculators from threatening the stability of the market,
including regulations on commodity derivatives markets.  Rising oil prices represent one of the biggest risks to
 Asia ’s fourth-largest economy, Bahk said this month, as South
Korea imports almost all of its oil needs.  Crude for May delivery fell 81 cents on April 13 to settle
at $102.83 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices
slid 0.5 percent this week and have fallen 6.3 percent from
$109.77 on Feb. 24, the highest level since May 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
