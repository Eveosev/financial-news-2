Jose Antonio Monago, regional
president of Extremadura and member of the governing People’s
Party, said  Spain  may need to rewrite its 1978 constitution to
stop regional governments hemorrhaging cash, El Mundo reported.  “There have been tremendous errors, such as expanding to
infinity their functions and spending has been uncontrolled and
irrational,” Monago told the newspaper in an interview
published today. “The constitution shouldn’t be untouchable. We
shouldn’t be afraid.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
