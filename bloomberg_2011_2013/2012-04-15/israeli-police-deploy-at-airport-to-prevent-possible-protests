Israeli police deployed several
hundred additional officers in and around Ben Gurion
International Airport outside  Tel Aviv  to prevent possible
disruptions by pro-Palestinian activists set to arrive today.  More than 1,500 activists from at least 15 countries were
expected to fly into Israel this weekend to protest the
government’s policies in the  West Bank  and  Gaza Strip , according
to an e-mailed statement from the Welcome to Palestine Campaign.  Several hundred of the protesters were prevented from
boarding flights to Israel after the government provided
airlines with names of passengers that wouldn’t be permitted to
enter Israel, said Abdelfattah Abusrour, a spokesman for the
activists.  “The airlines had no right to prevent their boarding and
some of our members are considering legal action,” Abusrour
said by telephone from Bethlehem.  Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  chided the
activists for choosing to protest “against Israel, the Middle
East’s sole democracy,” and suggested they focus instead on
human rights abuses in Syria and Iran. “First solve the real
problems of the region and then come back and share your
experience,” Netanyahu said, according to an e-mailed statement
released by his office last night.  “Israeli police will prevent any security incidents at the
international airport,” police spokesman  Micky Rosenfeld  said
by telephone.  The activists have no intention of creating disturbances at
Ben Gurion and only wish to take part in peaceful protests
against Israeli policies, said Abusrour. “The intelligent thing
that Israel can do is to allow these people to reach their buses
and come to Bethlehem,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
