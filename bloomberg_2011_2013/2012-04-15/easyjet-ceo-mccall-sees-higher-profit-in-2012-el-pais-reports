EasyJet Plc (EZJ) , Europe’s second-
biggest discount carrier, may post higher profit this year after
trimming losses during the low season,  El Pais  reported, citing
Chief Executive Officer Carolyn McCall.  EasyJet is holding off opening new routes in Spain because
of uncertainty about charges at the country’s biggest airports,
Barajas in Madrid and El Prat in Barcelona, the Madrid-based
newspaper reported today, citing McCall.  McCall said Spain’s previous government “compared Barajas
with Charles de Gaulle in Paris without taking into account that
the profit Charles de Gaulle allows is much higher than in
Madrid,” El Pais reported.  Spain is the most competitive market in Europe for the
 airline industry  and its capacity is “irrational” given the
returns available, McCall told El Pais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
