Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  wrote off
its almost 15 million-pound ($24 million) stake in U.K.â€™s
EasyCar as part of a restructuring of the rental-car business,
the Sunday Telegraph said.  Lloyds sold its remaining shares for a nominal sum, the
newspaper said, without saying where it got the information. The
company inherited the stake when it bought Halifax Bank of
 Scotland  during the financial crisis. A Lloyds spokesman
declined to comment to the Telegraph.  To contact the reporter on this story:
