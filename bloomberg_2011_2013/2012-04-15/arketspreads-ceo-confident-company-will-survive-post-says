Marketspreads Chief Executive
Officer John McGlade is “confident” the company can resume
business should the Irish central bank’s concerns over the
spread-betting company’s accounts be remedied, the  Sunday
Business Post  reported.  “We have a light at the end of the tunnel,” McGlade told
the Dublin-based paper. “There will still be a business if, and
I stress if, the central bank gives us the green light.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
