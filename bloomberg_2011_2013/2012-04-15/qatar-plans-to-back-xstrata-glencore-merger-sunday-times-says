Qatar told  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  that it will
back the mining company’s planned merger with  Glencore
International Plc (GLEN) , the Sunday Times  reported , without saying
where it got the information.  Qatar Holding LLC, an investment unit of the country’s
sovereign wealth fund, built a 5.5 percent stake in Xstrata by
last week, putting it in the most powerful position to influence
shareholder votes on the union, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
