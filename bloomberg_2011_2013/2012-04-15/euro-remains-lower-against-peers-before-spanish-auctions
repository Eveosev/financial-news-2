The euro fell to less than $1.30
for the first time in two months as Spanish bond yields touched
a 2012 high after a minister called on the  European Central Bank 
to do more to stem debt-market turmoil.  The 17-nation currency dropped for a second day against the
yen and reached the lowest since 2010 versus the pound. The yen
strengthened against all of its 16 most-traded counterparts.
China’s yuan weakened as the central bank widened the currency’s
trading band. Higher-yielding currencies trimmed losses against
the dollar after U.S. retail sales rose in March and yields on
Spanish  government securities  pared increases.  “There’s still a hesitation with respect to trading in
European bond markets,” said  Nick Bennenbroek , head of currency
strategy at  Wells Fargo & Co . in New York. “The U.S. data was a
little bit better than expected. It’s causing a minor risk-on
rally.”  The euro fell 0.3 percent to $1.3040 at 9:59 a.m. in New
York after dropping to $1.2995, the weakest since Feb. 16. The
shared currency weakened 0.7 percent to 105.12 yen after
declining 0.8 percent on April 13. The euro slipped 0.2 percent
to 82.35 U.K. pence after reaching 82.10 pence, the lowest since
September 2010. The yen rose 0.4 percent to 80.58 per dollar.  Brazil ’s real rose as much as 0.4 percent to 1.8322 per
dollar before trading at 1.8368, up 0.1 percent. New Zealand’s
dollar, which dropped the most against the greenback among its
16 most-traded peers tracked by Bloomberg, trimmed a 0.7 percent
decline to 0.4 percent, trading at 81.92 U.S. cents.  Spanish Debt  The euro weakened against 13 of its 16 major counterparts
after the cost of insuring Spain’s debt climbed to a record and
Jaime Garcia-Legaz, the nation’s deputy economy minister, said
in an interview on April 13 that the ECB should “step up
purchases of bonds.”  Spanish 10-year  bond yields  jumped as much as 18 basis
points, or 0.18 percentage point, to 6.16 percent, the highest
level since Dec. 1, before trading at 6.02 percent. Five-year
credit-default swaps linked to Spanish bonds jumped to an all-
time high, CMA data show.  Spain  will sell 12- and 18-month bills
tomorrow, followed by auctions of debt due in October 2014 and
January 2022 on April 19.  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  is struggling to convince
investors he can get Spain’s finances under control after last
month refusing to meet deficit targets set by the European
Commission and the previous government.  The euro lost 6 percent over the past year, according to
Bloomberg Correlation Weighted Indexes, the worst performer
among the 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by the gauges.
The yen gained 6.6 percent, and the dollar rose 4.7 percent.  ‘Still Lower’  “The euro is under a bit of pressure with the periphery in
focus, particularly as we have some Spanish issuance this
week,” said  Jeremy Stretch , head of currency strategy at
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in  London . “The path of
least resistance is still lower, and we’re probably looking for
euro-yen to lead the way.”  China ’s yuan fell by the most in almost three months
against the dollar as the central bank doubled the daily trading
band, reflecting declines in emerging-market currencies.  Effective today the People’s Bank of China is allowing 1
percent moves from its daily fixing, after keeping the limit at
0.5 percent since May 2007.  “The yuan is weaker as investors are again worried about
 Europe  and a bit on China’s growth,” said Tommy Ong, Hong Kong-
based senior vice president of treasury and markets at DBS Bank
( Hong Kong ). “It’s an opportune time for China to widen the
band when appreciation expectations aren’t so strong.”  China’s currency declined 0.2 percent to 6.315 per dollar
after dropping as much as 0.35 percent, the most since Jan 20.  Dollar Index  The  Dollar Index (DXY)  rose for a second day as U.S. data showed
retail sales increased last month, damping speculation the
 Federal Reserve  will add to monetary easing.  Retail sales  rose 0.8 percent, following a revised 1
percent advance in February, Commerce Department figures showed
today in  Washington . The median forecast of 81 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News called for a rise of 0.3 percent.
Eleven of 13 categories showed increases.  Four members of the  Federal Open Market Committee  judged
that monetary policy should be tightened from 2015, while two
preferred 2016, according to a Jan. 25 statement from the Fed.
The central bank bought $2.3 trillion of bonds from 2008 to 2011
in two rounds of quantitative easing.  The  Dollar Index , which Intercontinental Exchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S.
trading partners, advanced 0.1 percent to 79.945.  Key Level  The euro may fall as low as $1.2805 after breaking below a
key level of support today, according to Credit Suisse AG.  The currency is poised to weaken to the 78.6 percent
Fibonacci retracement of its rally in the first quarter after
declining through the so-called head-and-shoulders neckline at
$1.3030, Steve Miley, director of technical analysis in London,
said in a telephone interview.  Support refers to an area where buy orders may be
clustered. A head and shoulders is formed when a currency makes
three consecutive peaks, with the middle being the highest. A
neckline is drawn across the base of the three peaks. Fibonacci
analysis is based on the theory that prices rise or fall by
certain percentages after reaching a high or low.  To contact the reporters on this story:
