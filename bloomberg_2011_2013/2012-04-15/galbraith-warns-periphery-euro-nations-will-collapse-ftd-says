James Galbraith sees the current
strategy to deal with the euro crisis leading to a dramatic
increase in inequality, with growing unemployment and mass
migration inside the region, the  Financial Times Deutschland 
reported in a preview of an article to be published tomorrow.  The peripheral areas of the region will suffer a rapid and
long-lasting decline similar to that experienced in the southern
states of the U.S. after the Civil War, the  University of Texas 
in Austin economist told the newspaper in an interview. One of
Galbraithâ€™s proposed solutions is a joint European pension fund,
according to the FTD.  To contact the reporter on this story:
