Heart of Midlothian defeated league
champion Celtic 2-1 in soccer’s Scottish Cup semifinal at
Hampden Park, Glasgow, today and will play Hibernian in an all-
Edinburgh final on May 19.  Craig Beattie’s last-minute penalty kick gave Hearts
victory after their opening goal by Rudi Skacel had been leveled
by  Gary Hooper .  Hibs and Hearts last met in the final in 1896. Hearts have  won the trophy seven times, most recently in 2006.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
