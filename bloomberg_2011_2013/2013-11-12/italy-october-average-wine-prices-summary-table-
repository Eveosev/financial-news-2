Following is a summary of the October
average wine producer prices from the Istituto di Servizi per il Mercato 
Agricolo Alimentare in Rome:  NOTE: Prices are in Euro per hectograde for table wine and IGT wine, and  in Euro per 100 kilos for DOC and DOCG wine.  The prices are surveyed in approximately 100 markets. The number of  surveyed markets vary with season and with dynamism of prices.  Month on month and year on year percent changes are calculated by  Bloomberg News.    IGT or "Indicazione Geografica Tipica" is a set of rules   for wine production that are more relaxed than DOC and DOCG   rules and that require only the use of authorized geographically  identified varieties in a percentage not lower than 85%, permitting   the addition of foreign grape varieties.  DOC wine, or "vino a Denominazione di Origine Controllata"   is wine produced in specific well-defined regions, according   to specific rules designed to preserve the traditional   wine-making practices of the individual regions.  DOCG wine, or "vino a Denominazione di Origine Controllata  e Garantita" is wine produced under rules similar to the DOC   but more stringent. Allowable yields are generally lower, and   DOCG wines must pass an evaluation of a tasting committee before   they can be bottled.
