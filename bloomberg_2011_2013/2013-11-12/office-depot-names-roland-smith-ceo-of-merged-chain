Office Depot Inc. (ODP) , which completed a
merger with OfficeMax Inc. last week, named Roland Smith as
chief executive officer and chairman of the newly formed office-supply chain.  Smith most recently served as CEO of Delhaize America LLC,
a chain of supermarkets with $18 billion in revenue that
includes the Food Lion brand, Boca Raton-based Office Depot said
yesterday in a statement. He was also CEO for  Wendy’s Co. (WEN)   Office Depot and OfficeMax, the second- and third-largest
office-supply chains in the U.S., agreed in February to combine
in a $1.17 billion deal after losing sales to online rivals and
 Staples Inc. (SPLS)  They said the merged company would have more than
2,200 stores and combined revenue of about $17 billion, compared
with $24 billion in sales for Staples.  Office Depot  rose  1.5 percent to $5.29 yesterday in late
trading. The shares had gained 59 percent this year through the
 New York  close, compared with a 24 percent advance for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  At one time the search process included Neil Austrian,
Office Depot’s chief executive, and Ravi Saligram, his
counterpart at OfficeMax. When the deal closed on Nov. 5, Office
Depot said it hadn’t found a top executive yet and named
Austrian and Saligram co-CEOs. Both executives have resigned
from the retailer and the board following Smith’s appointment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
