Tampa Bay Lightning All-Star center
 Steven Stamkos , who is tied for the National Hockey League lead
in goals and points scored, will have surgery today to repair a
broken bone in his right leg and is out indefinitely.  Stamkos, 23, was the first overall pick of the Lightning in
the 2008 draft and led the NHL in goals scored during the
2009-10 and 2011-12 seasons. He has 14 goals and nine assists in
17 games for Tampa Bay this season.  Stamkos broke his right tibia in last night’s 3-0 loss at
the Boston Bruins when he slid into Tampa Bay’s goalpost during
the second period. Stamkos unsuccessfully tried to get to his
feet before being taken off the ice on a stretcher.  “The medical staff in Boston, in consultation with our
team physicians, has made the decision to surgically repair the
injury,” Lightning General Manager Steve Yzerman said. “The
biggest concern for me, and the rest of the Lightning, is that
decisions are made in Steven’s best long-term interest, and we
feel this is the appropriate course of action.”  The Lightning have the best record in the NHL’s Atlantic
Division this season at 12-5. Stamkos’s 23 points were tied with
 Sidney Crosby  of the  Pittsburgh Penguins  for the most in the
NHL, while his 14 goals matched Alexander Steen of the  St. Louis
Blues  for the league lead.  To contact the reporter on this story:
