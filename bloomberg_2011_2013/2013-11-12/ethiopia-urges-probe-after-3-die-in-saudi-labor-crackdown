Ethiopia demanded  Saudi Arabia  probe
the deaths of its citizens as the kingdom prepared to expel tens
of thousands of foreigners in a crackdown on undocumented
workers.  Three Ethiopian nationals were killed in recent clashes
with Saudi police, Foreign Ministry spokesman Dina Mufti told
reporters today in Ethiopia’s capital,  Addis Ababa , without
giving details. Ethiopia’s government has spoken to Saudi
Arabian officials and condemned the “deplorable” killing of
“innocent citizens,” Dina said.  Saudi authorities on Nov. 4 started implementing measures
against violators of the kingdom’s labor laws. About 17,000
Ethiopians have surrendered themselves in the capital,  Riyadh ,
since Nov. 10 after clashes with police in the Manfouha
neighborhood left two people dead,  al-Riyadh newspaper  reported
today, citing Nasser al-Qahtani, spokesman for the city’s
police.  Ethiopia’s government has sent extra diplomatic staff to
register Ethiopians for their return home, according to Dina.
“We’re looking for orderly repatriation with the rights of all
citizens, including Ethiopians, respected,” he said.  Saudi Arabia, the Arab world’s biggest economy, is taking
action against illegal workers as it pushes to create more jobs
for its citizens and stave off unrest.  More than 9 million foreign workers have entered Saudi
Arabia as the world’s largest oil exporter invests its energy
wealth to build roads, airports and new industrial cities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
