Austria’s wine-grape harvest will be
below average because of adverse weather during the summer, the
Austrian Wine Marketing Board said.  The harvest, equating to an estimated 2.25 million
hectoliters (59.4 million gallons), will be about 7 percent
below the five-year average, the Vienna-based board said in a
 statement  today. Cold and wet conditions that followed a drought
in June had a negative effect, particularly along the Danube
River, it said.  Grape quality is “very satisfying,” according to the
board. “I’m specifically looking forward to an outstanding year
for sweet wines,” said Willi Klinger, head of the organization.  To contact the reporter on this story:
