Two people were killed and three
injured in an explosion outside a Johannesburg shop owned by
Czech fugitive Radovan Krejcir, Eyewitnesss News reported,
citing witnesses.  Police with sniffer dogs are inspecting the shop for
possible further explosive devices and paramedics are on the
scene, the Johannesburg-based website reported. Krejcir was not
at the Moneypoint shop at the time, EWN said.  Krejcir is wanted by Czech authorities on charges of tax
fraud and conspiracy to commit murder after fleeing his house in
 Prague  through a secret tunnel while it was being searched in
2005. He fled to the Seychelles and arrived in South Africa in
2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
