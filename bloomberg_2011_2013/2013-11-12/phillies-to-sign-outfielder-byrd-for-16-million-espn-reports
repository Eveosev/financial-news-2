Free-agent outfielder Marlon Byrd
signed a two-year, $16 million contract with the  Philadelphia
Phillies , returning to the team that gave him his start in  Major
League Baseball .  The contract also includes a club/vesting option for 2016
and award bonuses, the team said in a news release.  “Marlon adds a significant upgrade both offensively and
defensively to our outfield,” Ruben Amaro Jr., the team’s
general manager, said in a statement. “He has been particularly
productive against left-handed pitching, which was a serious
challenge for us this past season. He is an experienced middle-of-the-order hitter who creates some balance to our lineup.”  Byrd, 36, had the best season of his 12 in the major
leagues career in 2013, batting .291 with a career-high 24 home
runs and 88 runs batted in, playing 117 games for the  New York 
Mets before being traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates in August.  He was taken by the Phillies in the 10th round of the 1999
amateur draft and played for the major-league club from 2002
into 2005. He’s also had stints with the Washington Nationals,
Texas Rangers,  Chicago Cubs  and  Boston Red Sox .  As a free agent in June 2012, Byrd was suspended for 50
games for violating baseball’s performance-enhancing drug
policy. After testing positive for the banned substance
Tamoxifen, Byrd said it was the result of medication given to
him for a private condition unrelated to baseball.  To contact the reporter on this story:
