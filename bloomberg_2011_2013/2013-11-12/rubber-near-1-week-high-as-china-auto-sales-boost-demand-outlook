Rubber traded near a one-week high
after data showed vehicle sales in  China  climbed by the most
since January, boosting the outlook for demand from the world’s
largest consumer of the commodity used in tires.  The contract for delivery in April on the  Tokyo  Commodity
Exchange gained as much as 0.7 percent to 260.3 yen a kilogram
($2,617 a metric ton) and traded at 260.2 yen at 10:14 a.m.
Futures settled at the highest level since Nov. 1 yesterday.  Wholesale deliveries of cars, multipurpose and sport
utility vehicles rose to 1.61 million last month, data from the
state-backed China Association of Automobile Manufacturers
showed yesterday. That compared with the median estimate of 1.5
million units by three analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  “Expanding car sales in China raised optimism about growth
in demand for rubber,” said Hideshi Matsunaga, an analyst at
broker ACE Koeki Co. in Tokyo.  Rubber for May delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
was little changed at 19,415  yuan  ($3,187) a ton. Thai rubber
free-on-board gained 1.3 percent to 79.05 baht ($2.50) a
kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research Institute
of  Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
