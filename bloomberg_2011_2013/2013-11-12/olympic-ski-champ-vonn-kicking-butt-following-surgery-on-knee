Olympic downhill ski champion
 Lindsey Vonn  said she is “kicking some butt” as she returns
from knee surgery to try to defend her title at the Sochi Winter
Games in February.  Vonn, a 29-year-old American who won gold at the 2010
Vancouver Winter Olympics, said she plans to return to the World
Cup tour for a Nov. 29 race in Beaver Creek, Colorado. She had
right-knee surgery in February.  “I’m back to normal, I’m 100 percent,” Vonn said today in
an interview with  Trish Regan  and  Matt Miller  of Bloomberg
Television’s “Street Smart.” “I’ve been kicking some butt,
training has been awesome and I can’t wait to start racing
again.”  Vonn, a four-time overall World Cup champion who has won
six straight downhill season titles, had surgery to repair two
knee ligaments and a broken bone in her leg after a Feb. 5 crash
at the World Ski Championships in Schladming, Austria.  Vonn was interviewed along with Kevin Plank, the founder
and chief executive officer of the Baltimore-based apparel maker
Under Armour Inc. Vonn is featured modeling new winter gear on
the home page of the  company’s website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
