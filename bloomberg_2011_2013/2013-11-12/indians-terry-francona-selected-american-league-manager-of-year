Terry Francona  was voted the
American League Manager of the Year today after guiding the
Cleveland Indians into the playoffs with a franchise record-tying increase in victories.  Francona, 54, led the Indians to a 92-70 record in his
first year at the helm, a 24-victory improvement from 2012. He
was fired by the  Boston Red Sox  after the team blew a nine-game
playoff lead with less than a month to play in 2011 for the
biggest September collapse in MLB history.  The other finalists in voting by the Baseball Writers’
Association of America were John Farrell of the World Series-winning Red Sox and 2012 winner  Bob Melvin  of the Oakland
Athletics.  Clint Hurdle won his first National League Manager of the
Year award by leading the Pittsburgh Pirates into the baseball
playoffs for the first time since 1992.  The Pirates went 94-68 this year, ending a streak of 20
straight losing seasons, and won the NL wild-card playoff game
against the Cincinnati Reds before losing a five-game divisional
series against the St. Louis Cardinals.  The other NL finalists were Fredi Gonzalez of the Atlanta
Braves and  Don Mattingly  of the Los Angeles Dodgers.  The rest of Major League Baseball’s big awards -- Most
Valuable Player and the Cy Young Award given to the top pitcher
in each league -- will be given out later this week.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
