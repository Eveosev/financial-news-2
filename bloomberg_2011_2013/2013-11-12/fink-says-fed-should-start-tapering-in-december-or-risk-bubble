BlackRock Inc. (BLK)  Chief Executive
Officer Laurence D. Fink said the U.S. Federal Reserve should
start reducing its unprecedented asset purchases next month or
risk creating a bubble.  “I actually believe there’s a need to begin tapering,”
Fink said today at the annual meeting for the Securities
Industry and Financial Markets Association in  New York . “That
sounds like a bubble to me when you buy over 100 percent of all
public and private debt issuance.”  Fink said the Fed bought about 80 percent of all public and
private debt issuance in 2012. If the U.S. deficit decreases by
about 30 percent as projected, the central bank will be buying
more than 100 percent of debt issuance, Fink said. The Fed
should continue to keep the  interest rate  at zero, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
