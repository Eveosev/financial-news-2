The ruble and Russian government
debt declined for a third day on concern the  Federal Reserve 
will move to curb stimulus. VTB Capital said the drop is
overdone and currency may rebound.  The ruble slid 0.2 percent to 37.9215 against  Bank Rossii’s
target dollar-euro basket  by 3:40 p.m. in Moscow, the weakest
level on a closing basis since Sept. 9. The yield on  government
bonds  due February 2027 rose four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 7.83 percent.  “We’re still reeling along with other emerging countries
on the tapering expectations,” Anton Nikitin, an analyst at VTB
Capital in Moscow, said in e-mailed comments. “We’re closer to
levels where we see very good opportunities” to bet the ruble
will strengthen, he said.  Emerging-market currencies weakened as investors weighed
the timing for reduced bond purchases by the Fed. Policy makers
will pare the monthly pace to $70 billion at their March 18-19
meeting, according to the median of 32 economist estimates in a
Bloomberg survey on Nov. 8. The central bank currently buys $85
billion of debt a month.  Russia ’s central bank eased its defense of the ruble,
allowing the corridor in which it trades against the basket to
rise by 5 kopeks to 32.45-39.45 rubles, the regulator said on
its website today. The central bank buys the equivalent of $200
million of rubles per day to slow its declines at current levels
and buys $400 million if it weakens to below 38.50 per basket,
according to its exchange rate policy.  “We are pretty deep in the central bank’s intervention
zone,” Nikitin said.  The ruble weakened 0.3 percent against the dollar to
32.9075 and traded down 0.2 percent versus the euro at 44.0655.
Oil, Russia’s chief export earner, advanced 0.3 percent to
$106.72 a barrel in  London .  Russia’s 2027 ruble bonds fell for a third day. “Investors
expectations on tapering start looking excessive, which
increases the appeal of the ruble bonds,” Dmitriy Gritskevich,
a  money manager  at OAO Promsvyazbank in Moscow, said in an e-mailed note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
