Russia and  Vietnam  signed an
agreement during President  Vladimir Putin ’s visit to bolster
defense ties between the Cold War allies.  Russia plans to broaden an array of weapons being supplied
to Vietnam and assist with personnel training for the Southeast
Asian nation’s army and navy, Putin  said  today in Hanoi at a
joint briefing with his Vietnamese counterpart, Truong Tan Sang.
The defense agreement also covers issues related to a possible
transfer of technologies, Putin’s spokesman,  Dmitry Peskov , told
reporters in the Vietnamese capital.  Putin, who’s making a one-day visit to Hanoi, wants to
expand ties between the former allies, overseeing the signing of
exploration and investment agreements between Russian state-run
energy companies OAO Gazprom and OAO Rosneft with PetroVietnam.  “Vietnam is worried about the rise of China and has been
allocating large budgets for defense in the past few years,”
 Ruslan Pukhov , a member of the Russian Defense Ministry’s
advisory board and head of the Center for Analysis of Strategies
and Technologies in Moscow, said by phone today.  Russia is in talks on setting up a naval servicing facility
in Cam Ranh Bay, a former Soviet naval base in Vietnam, Interfax
reported yesterday, citing an unidentified official with
knowledge of plans.  The topic is among the issues to be discussed during
Russian-Vietnamese talks in Hanoi, the news service said, adding
that the facility may be used for resupply, maintenance of
Russian warships moving between the Pacific to the  Gulf of Aden 
and back.  Russia’s only military base outside the former  Soviet Union 
is a naval resupply facility in the port of Tartus in Syria.  To contact the reporters on this story:
