OAO Gazprom snapped two days of
losses as JPMorgan Chase & Co. raised  Russia ’s natural gas
export monopoly to the equivalent of buy, citing prospects for a
Chinese deal and dividends.  The shares advanced 1.3 percent to 146.64 rubles by 2:16
p.m. in Moscow after falling 1.8 percent yesterday. The volume
traded was equivalent to about 77 percent of the three-month
average.  Gazprom rallied after JPMorgan raised it to  overweight  on
the possibility of a gas contract with  China  and of switching to
a dividend based on international reporting standards, according
to an e-mailed note. The shares fell yesterday after Interfax
reported Ukraine’s state-run energy company halted purchases
from the natural-gas exporter.  “No other large cap stock in Russia offers better
potential to double over the next three years than Gazprom, we
believe,” JPMorgan analysts led by Artem Konchin said in an e-mailed note. “We see the company’s valuation as still
undemanding, and its ability to generate cash remains intact.”  Gazprom’s global depositary receipts increased 0.5 percent
to $8.88 in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
