Malaysia’s five-year bond yield rose
to a six-week high and the ringgit fell as signs of an economic
pickup in the U.S. bolstered the case for the  Federal Reserve  to
reduce stimulus.  Jobless claims in the world’s largest economy declined to
331,000 in the week ended Nov. 9 from 336,000 in the preceding
period, according to the median estimate of economists in a
Bloomberg survey ahead of data due Nov. 14. A report last week
showed American employers added more workers in October than
analysts projected. Global funds held 28 percent of Malaysian
sovereign bonds in September, compared with 31 percent for
 Indonesia  and 17 percent for  Thailand , official figures show.  “Given the renewed concerns of tapering after the strong
non-farm payrolls number, international investors are likely
reducing their Malaysian government securities portfolio,” said
Kumar Rachapudi, a senior rates strategist at Australia & New
Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in  Singapore .  The yield on the government’s 3.26 percent notes due March
2018 climbed three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to
3.57 percent, the highest since Sept. 30, as of 12:38 p.m. in
 Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The 10-year sovereign yield added three basis points to a one-month
high of 3.81 percent.  The ringgit slipped 0.1 percent to 3.2033 per dollar, after
dropping 0.7 percent yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in the
 exchange rate  used to price options, fell three basis points to
9.23 percent. The Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Index rose 0.1 percent.  Favoring Ringgit  Morgan Stanley favors the ringgit,  Taiwan ’s dollar and the
South Korean won over Indonesia’s rupiah and the Indian rupee
after last week’s U.S. jobs report, Geoffrey Kendrick, the
bank’s Hong-Kong based head of Asian currencies and interest-rate strategy, wrote in a research note yesterday.  U.S. employers added 204,000 workers to payrolls in
October, a figure that topped the most optimistic forecast in a
survey of economists and followed a 163,000 increase in
September that was larger than initially estimated, a Nov. 8
report showed. Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President  Dennis
Lockhart  said the same day the central bank will consider
reducing its bond-buying program at next month’s review.  To contact the reporter on this story:
