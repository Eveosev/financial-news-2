Copper production  in  China , the
world’s largest user, climbed to a record in October as smelters
put new capacity into use amid ample supply of concentrate.  Refined-copper output rose 23 percent from a year earlier
to 637,000 metric tons, according to data from the National
Bureau of Statistics. That was 2.6 percent higher than the
previous record of 621,000 tons a month earlier.  Higher production was in line with investors’ expectations
as new smelting capacity came online this year, said Judy Zhu,
an analyst at Standard Chartered Plc. in  Shanghai .  “Record output of refined copper will increase supply in
the domestic market,” Zhu said. “Given that demand also
appeared to be on the strong side, we are expecting prices to
stay at current level in the short term.”  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange fell 0.7 percent to $7,127.75 at 7:01 p.m. Shanghai
time. The metal for delivery in January closed at 51,480  yuan 
($8,450) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange today.  Domestic  iron ore production  fell to 134.88 million tons in
October, from a record 136.64 million tons a month ago,
according to statistics bureau data.  “China’s iron ore output will continue to remain near the
record high level as domestic miners ramped up production at
current high prices,” Zhu added.  China’s  zinc  production was 500,000 tons in October, the
highest since December 2011, while its lead production rose 9.9
percent to 423,000 tons, according to statistics bureau data.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
