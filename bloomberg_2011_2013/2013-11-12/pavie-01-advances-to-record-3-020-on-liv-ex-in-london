Two cases of 2001 Chateau Pavie, a
wine estate promoted in the 2012 Saint-Emilion classification,
sold for a record 1,900 pounds ($3,020) each this week on Liv-ex
as the grower outperformed a benchmark Bordeaux index.  The trade on Nov. 11 was 2.7 percent up from the 1,850
pounds at which it traded in September and 23 percent up from
1,550 pounds in June, according to data on Liv-ex’s Cellar Watch
website.  Pavie prices have risen since its elevation to the ranks of
the top four Bordeaux growers in Saint-Emilion in September last
year. It now rates as a Premier Grand Cru Classe A alongside
Chateau Cheval Blanc, Chateau Ausone and Chateau Angelus in the
classification, which replaced one dating from 1996.  “Pavie and Angelus’s promotion to Premier Grand Cru Classe
A in the Saint-Emilion re-classification last September led to
strong trading and price rises over the year,” Liv-ex said in
its market blog.  The 2001 vintage of Pavie has risen 50 percent from a year
ago, when it traded at 1,264 pounds a case, and has more than
tripled from the 520 pounds at which it sold on Liv-ex in March
2006, before the financial crisis, according to data on Liv-ex’s
Cellar Watch website.  The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 index of Bordeaux wines from the
past 10 years has fallen more than 7 percent since mid-March
after gains in the first 10 weeks of this year, and is down 0.3
percent since the end of December.  Merlot Grapes  The estate, on the right bank of the Dordogne, was acquired
by Gerard and Chantal Perse in 1998 and has about 35 hectares
(86 acres) under vines, predominantly Merlot with some Cabernet
Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon.  The 2001 Pavie was awarded 96 points by U.S. critic Robert Parker, putting it among the estate’s top seven vintages of the
past 12 years, according to data on the eRobertParker.com
website.  The wine ranks as the estate’s ninth-most expensive vintage
in the past 15 years, according to merchant data compiled by
Liv-ex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
