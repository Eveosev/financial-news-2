Palm oil  fluctuated on speculation
that falling exports from  Malaysia , the world’s second-largest
producer, may boost inventories even as output starts to taper.  The contract for January delivery retreated and gained at
least 0.3 percent on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives, and ended
the morning session at 2,530 ringgit ($790) a metric ton. Prices
declined 4.6 percent last week, the most since the five days
ending March 29.  Shipments from Malaysia fell 13 percent to 472,321 tons in
the first 10 days of November from the same period last month,
surveyor Intertek said yesterday. Production of the tropical
oil, used in everything from candy to biofuel, is typically
highest from July to October because of growing cycles.  “The weaker exports signal that inventories could be
slightly higher this month,” said Chandran Sinnasamy, head of
trading at LT International Futures Sdn., in  Kuala Lumpur .  Stockpiles rose 3.5 percent in October to 1.85 million tons
from a month earlier, the Malaysian Palm Oil Board said
yesterday. Production gained 3.1 percent to 1.97 million tons,
while exports rose 3.3 percent to 1.66 million tons.  “The higher inventories have been slightly negative for
the market,” said Arhnue Tan, an analyst at Alliance Investment
Bank Bhd. Production is plateauing and could weaken from
November onward, supporting prices, she said.  Soybean oil  for December delivery fell 0.4 percent to 40.27
cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybeans for
delivery in January were little changed at $12.995 a bushel.  Refined palm oil for May delivery dropped 0.3 percent to
6,164  yuan  ($1,012) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange  and
soybean oil slid 0.2 percent to 7,116 yuan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
