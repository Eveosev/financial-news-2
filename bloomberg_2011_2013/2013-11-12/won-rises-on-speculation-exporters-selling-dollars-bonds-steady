South Korea’s won snapped a three-day drop on speculation exporters are taking advantage of the
currency’s recent decline to repatriate sales proceeds.
 Government bonds  were steady.  The currency fell 1 percent this month as foreign investors
 sold  more local stocks than they bought on all days but one,
exchange data show. U.S. employers added 204,000 workers in
October, exceeding estimates in a Bloomberg survey of economists
and boosting speculation the  Federal Reserve  will rein in its
stimulus as early as December.  The won climbed 0.1 percent to 1,071.45 per dollar in
Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched
1,072.53 yesterday, the weakest level since Oct. 14.  “Exporters sold dollars as the won has fallen to the 1,070
level versus the dollar,” said  Park Hyun , a currency trader at
 Woori Bank  in Seoul.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the exchange rate used to price options, dropped one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.07 percent.  The yield on South Korea’s 2.75 percent sovereign bonds due
June 2016 was unchanged at 2.96 percent in Seoul, according to
Korea Exchange Inc. prices. It advanced seven basis points
yesterday, the biggest increase since July 1.  Fed Vice Chairman  Janet Yellen  testifies Nov. 14 before the
Senate Banking Committee regarding her nomination to succeed
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke , whose term ends Jan. 31. U.S. policy
makers will probably pare their monthly bond purchases to $70
billion at their March 18-19 meeting from the current $85
billion, according to the median of 32 estimates in a Bloomberg
survey Nov. 8.  Surplus Forecast  “Foreign investors have been selling local stocks and
bonds, although the outflow is not too worrisome yet,” said Han
Sung Min, a currency trader at Busan Bank in Seoul. “Investors
will pay attention to Yellen’s testimony this week.”  South Korea’s current account surplus will shrink next
year, pressured by a rise in the won’s real effective  exchange
rate  and stronger domestic demand, economists Kim Seong Tae and
Jung Kyu Chul at the state-run  Korea Development Institute ,
wrote in a report today. The excess in the widest measure of
trade was be in a range of $45 billion to $56 billion in 2014,

will reach $63 billion this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
