Clint Hurdle won his first National
League Manager of the Year award by leading the Pittsburgh
Pirates into the baseball playoffs for the first time since
1992.  The Pirates went 94-68 this year, ending a streak of 20
straight losing seasons, and won the NL wild-card playoff game
against the Cincinnati Reds before losing a five-game divisional
series against the St. Louis Cardinals.  The other finalists in voting by the Baseball Writers’
Association of America were Fredi Gonzalez of the Atlanta Braves
and  Don Mattingly  of the Los Angeles Dodgers.  The American League Manager of the Year will be announced
later today. The finalists are John Farrell of the World Series-winning Boston Red Sox,  Terry Francona  of the Cleveland Indians
and  Bob Melvin  of the Oakland Athletics.  The rest of Major League Baseball’s big awards -- Most
Valuable Player and the Cy Young Award given to the top pitcher
in each league -- will be given out later this week.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
