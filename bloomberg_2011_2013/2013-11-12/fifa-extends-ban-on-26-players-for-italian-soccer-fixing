Soccer ruling body FIFA extended
bans worldwide on 26 players and a team director for match-fixing in  Italy ’s top two divisions.  The Italian federation said in July and August it was
suspending players from teams including  Bari  and Lazio for
between three months and four years.  The players are all Italian apart from a Belgian, a
Belarusian and a Croatian,  FIFA said in a statement , without
identifying any of them.  The  Italian federation said July 16  it was sanctioning more
than 20 Bari players and an official of another Serie B team,
Salernitana. That ruling followed an investigation into Bari
matches in 2008 and 2009.  On Aug. 2, the federation said it banned Lazio’s Stefano
Mauri and four other players after probing Serie A games
involving the team in 2011. Mauri is appealing a nine-month
suspension,  Agence France-Presse  reported Oct. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
