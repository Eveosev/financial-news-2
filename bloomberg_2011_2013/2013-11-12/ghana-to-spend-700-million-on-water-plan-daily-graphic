Ghana will spend $700 million
through 2014 on 30 projects to expand access to clean water in
the West African nation, the Daily Graphic said.  The government has finished about 73 percent of the $273
million Kpong Water Project in eastern Accra, the capital, the
newspaper said, citing Deputy Information Minister Felix Ofosu Kwakye. The upgrade will add 40 million gallons of water a day,
the newspaper said.  The projects will boost access to potable water in urban
areas to 85 percent and to 76 percent in rural areas, the paper
said, citing Kwakye.  To contact the reporter on this story:
