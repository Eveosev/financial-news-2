The European Union is looking at
possible manipulation of currency rates after “benchmark-manipulation concerns” similar to those in the Libor probes
were brought to the attention of regulators.  Joaquin Almunia , the EU’s antitrust chief, discussed a
possible probe of currency rates for a second time during a
speech in  London  today, saying that there are “similar
benchmark-manipulation concerns” to those examined in the EU’s
investigation of the Libor and Euribor lending rates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
