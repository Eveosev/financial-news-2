Alterra Power Corp., a Vancouver-based renewable-energy developer, agreed to buy the 49 percent
of a Canadian run-of-river hydroelectric project that it doesn’t
already own from  General Electric Co. (GE)   That will make Alterra the sole owner of the 62-megawatt
Jimmie Creek project in British Columbia, the company said today
in a statement. Terms weren’t disclosed.  Construction is expected to begin in the first half of next
year. BC Hydro will purchase the electricity under a 40-year
contract beginning in August 2016.  To contact the reporter on this story:
