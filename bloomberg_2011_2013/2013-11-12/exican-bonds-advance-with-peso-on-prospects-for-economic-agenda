Mexico ’s peso bonds rose, pushing
yields down from a two-month high, on speculation legislators
will pass legal changes to support economic growth.  Yields on the securities maturing in 2042 fell nine basis
points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 7.59 percent at 10:58 a.m.
in Mexico City, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
yields climbed yesterday to 7.68 percent, the highest since
Sept. 5. The peso rose 0.1 percent to 13.1984 per  U.S. dollar .  Foreign holdings of Mexican government fixed-rate bonds
climbed to a record last month on wagers that President Enrique Pena Nieto will prevail in his efforts to open up the  energy
industry . Mexico’s bonds fell over the past two days as U.S.
jobs growth fueled speculation the  Federal Reserve  will curtail
stimulus sooner than expected.  “Mexico seems very attractive,” Alejandro Urbina, who
helps oversee $800 million at Silva Capital Management LLC, said
in a telephone interview from Chicago. “We have to get over
this taper panic that causes rates to shoot higher.”  Pena Nieto has pledged to end the state oil producer’s 75-year monopoly on drilling while seeking to lure companies such
as Exxon Mobil Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
