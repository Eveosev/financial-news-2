Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said  Iran  stands to gain back billions of dollars
under a deal to ease economic sanctions, which negotiators
almost reached at nuclear talks in Geneva last week.  “It gives Iran a tremendous break, a hole, not a tiny
hole, but a big hole, in sanctions,” Netanyahu said today in a
speech to the Bloomberg Fuel Choices Summit in Tel Aviv. It
would gain “several billion dollars worth that is augmented to
much more.”  Netanyahu has urged President  Barack Obama  and other world
leaders to reject any deal with Iran that doesn’t dismantle its
nuclear program, and opposed the accord that was offered to Iran
by world powers in Geneva last week.  The Geneva talks broke up Nov. 9 without agreement on an
offer to ease some economic sanctions on the Islamic republic in
return for limited restrictions on its nuclear program.
Negotiations are due to resume on Nov. 20.  Addressing the need to develop alternative fuels to oil,
Netanyahu said Israel is spending “one half of one percent of
our oil import bill on this project.” He said oil is “a source
of tremendous international instability.”  Israel’s discovery in recent years of about 29 trillion
cubic feet of natural gas in deep-water wells off its
Mediterranean coast has eased the nation’s reliance on imported
energy. Energy Minister Silvan Shalom says gas production will
save  Israel  as much as $1 billion a month by 2015, up from the
current $300 million.  To contact the reporters on this story:
