French industrial confidence rose to
the highest in more than two years, a sign that the recovery in
 Europe ’s second-largest economy is strengthening.  The Bank of  France ’s  index of sentiment  among factory
executives jumped to 99 in October from 97 in September, while
the service index was unchanged at 93. The readings suggest
 gross domestic product  will expand 0.4 percent in the fourth
quarter, the central bank said in an e-mailed statement.  The increase brings industrial confidence to its highest
since June 2011, before European governments organized a
writedown of Greek public debt that contributed to a euro-area
recession that only ended in the second quarter. The prospect of
recovery comes as President Francois Hollande grapples with
record-low popularity and a reduction in France’s credit rating
to the third-highest level by  Standard & Poor’s .  “This is a normalization,” said Fabrice Montagne, an
economist at Barclays in Paris. “Things are getting better, but
this is not yet a very strong recovery.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
