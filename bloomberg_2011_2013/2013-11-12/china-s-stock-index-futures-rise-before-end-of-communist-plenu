before the conclusion of a four-day Communist Party meeting.  Kweichow Moutai Co. (600519) ,  China ’s biggest liquor maker, climbed

“Market sentiment is cautious as trading volumes are light.”  The CSI 300 Index rose 1 percent to 2,340. The  Hang Seng
China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  added 0.1 percent. The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index added 0.9 percent in  New York  yesterday.  The Shanghai Composite has dropped 13 percent from this
year’s high set on Feb. 6 amid concern economic growth will slow
in the fourth quarter. The measure trades at 8.4 times projected
profit for the next 12 months, compared with the seven-year
average of 15.3, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  Moutai Rallies  A gauge of consumer staples in the CSI 300 jumped 1.9
percent for the biggest gain among 10 industry groups, followed
by a 1.4 percent advance for financial shares.  Kweichow Moutai surged 3.8 percent to 144.84 yuan. The
liquor maker said yesterday the board approved a plan to buy a
property in Paris for 8.79 million euros ($11.8 million) to
develop its business in  Europe . Rival Wuliangye Yibin Co.

insurer, climbed 4.9 percent to 14.05 yuan. Huaxia Bank Co.,
partly owned by Deutsche Bank AG, rose 2.2 percent to 7.85 yuan.  China’s broadest measure of  new credit  fell by more than
estimated in October. Aggregate financing was 856.4 billion yuan
($140.6 billion), the People’s Bank of China said yesterday
after the market closed, below all nine projections in a
Bloomberg News survey. New local-currency loans of 506.1 billion
yuan compared with the 580 billion yuan median estimate of
analysts.  ‘Solid’ Credit  “Money and credit growth were still quite solid and
investors should not be too much swayed by the seasonality in
new loans, deposits and total social financing,” Lu Ting, head
of Greater China economics at Bank of America Corp., wrote in an
e-mailed report. “We don’t expect the PBOC to significantly
tighten monetary policies as new leaders still need a stable
economic and financial environment to consolidate their power
base.”  Cosco Shipping, a unit of China’s largest shipping company,
gained 2.8 percent to 3.34 yuan.  China Shipping Development Co. (600026) ,
a unit of the nation’s second-biggest sea-cargo group, added 1.2
percent to 4.16 yuan.  China will lower the threshold on subsidies for scrapping
ships, the China Securities Journal said, citing an unidentified
person. The ministries are reviewing the draft rules, which may
be announced before the end of the year, it said.  China Oilfield Services slipped 1.9 percent to 23.66 yuan,
trimming its gain to 44 percent this year. The 14-day relative
strength measure for the stock, measuring how rapidly prices
have advanced or dropped during a specified time period, rose to
74 last week. Readings above 70 indicate a price may be poised
to fall.  Offshore Oil Engineering Co. (600583) , a unit of the country’s
third-largest oil producer, declined 3.4 percent to 8.66 yuan.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
