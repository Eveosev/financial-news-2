Germany ’s government bonds fell as
signs of strength in the U.S. economy add to the case for the
Federal Reserve to reduce asset purchases, damping demand for
fixed-income assets.  Ten-year bund yields climbed to the highest level in almost
three weeks as the nation allotted 755 million euros ($1.01
billion) of inflation-linked bonds. Benchmark German securities
dropped last week after a U.S. report showed employers added
more jobs last month than economists forecast. Italian and
Spanish bonds also declined. Italy sold one-year bills at a
 record-low  yield today.  “It’s really the U.S. that is putting pressure on bunds,”
said Allan von Mehren, chief analyst at Danske Bank A/S in
Copenhagen. “Tapering is back on the table. The jobs report
last week changed the game completely. I think we are going to
have bund yields between 1.7 and 1.9 percent for a while.”  Germany’s 10-year bund yield increased four basis points,
or 0.04 percentage point, to 1.79 percent at 4:28 p.m. London
time, the highest since Oct. 23. The 2 percent bond maturing in
August 2023 fell 0.315, or 3.15 euros per 1,000-euro face
amount, to 101.87.  The rate on similar-maturity U.S. notes climbed three basis
points to 2.77 percent after rising to 2.79 percent, the highest
since Sept. 18. That left the yield difference, or spread,
versus German 10-year bunds at 98 basis points, after reaching
102, the widest since Aug. 22.  The U.S. Labor Department said last week employers in the
world’s biggest economy added 204,000 workers in October,
exceeding the median estimate for a 120,000 gain in a Bloomberg
News survey.  Fed Tapering  Central bank officials will probably decide to pare
purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities to $70
billion a month at their March 18-19 meeting, according to the
median of 32 economist estimates in a separate Bloomberg survey
on Nov. 8. The Fed currently buys $85 billion of debt a month.  Germany sold 10-year inflation-linked bonds at an average
 real yield  of 0.29 percent, compared with 0.36 percent at a
previous auction on Sept. 10.  Italy  sold 6.5 billion euros of one-year bills at a yield
of 0.688 percent, down from 0.999 percent at the previous
auction Oct. 10. That’s the lowest according to data compiled by
Bloomberg going back to 1984.  The Netherlands allotted 1.955 billion euros of securities
due in July 2023 at an average yield of 2.104 percent, versus
2.412 percent at a previous sale on Sept. 10.  Belgium, France, Greece and Slovenia also auctioned short-dated debt today.  German Inflation  The German annualized  inflation rate , calculated using a
harmonized European Union method, dropped to 1.2 percent last
month from 1.6 percent in September, the Federal Statistics
Office in Wiesbaden said today. That’s the lowest since April.  The European Central Bank cut its main refinancing  rate  to
0.25 percent on Nov. 7. The annual  inflation rate  in the euro
area slowed to 0.7 percent last month, the lowest since November
2009, data showed on Oct. 31. The ECB’s inflation target is 2
percent. Inflation erodes the purchasing power of the fixed
payments from bonds.  The yield on Spanish 10-year bonds rose one basis point to
4.11 percent, while the rate on similar-maturity Italian debt
increased two basis points, to 4.15 percent.  Germany is scheduled to auction 5 billion euros of two-year
notes tomorrow. It last sold the securities on Oct. 16 at an
 average yield  of 0.19 percent, compared with a record-low minus
0.06 percent set in July 2012.  The two-year note yield was little changed at 0.1 percent
today.  Volatility on Austrian bonds was the highest in the euro-area markets, followed by those of Belgium and  Greece , according
to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between two- and
10-year securities and credit-default swaps.  German securities lost 1.4 percent this year through
yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Spain’s
returned 11 percent and Italy’s earned 6.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
