A measure of the strength of
investor protections in speculative-grade U.S. bond offerings
deteriorated in the 12 months ended September, according to
Moody’s Investors Service.  Moody’s covenant-quality index, in which 5 indicates the
weakest protections and 1 the strongest, rose to 3.64 from 3.41
in the year ended August, analysts Alexander Dill and Kyle
Goodwin wrote in a report today. The measure for deals in
September alone climbed to 4.05, the highest monthly reading in
data going back to January 2011.  Corporate issuers sold a record $56 billion of dollar-denominated junk bonds in September, a 33 percent increase from
a year earlier as speculation mounted that the Federal Reserve
would soon start reducing $85 billion of monthly asset purchases
that have bolstered debt markets and drove borrowing costs to
the lowest ever, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Investors’ continuing appetite for higher yields amid
still-low rates on U.S. Treasury bonds has driven speculative-grade corporate bond issuance higher and covenant protections
lower,” Goodwin said in a statement.  Covenants in speculative-grade debt offerings deteriorated
in 21 out of 27 non-financial corporate sectors and subsectors
over the 12-month period, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
