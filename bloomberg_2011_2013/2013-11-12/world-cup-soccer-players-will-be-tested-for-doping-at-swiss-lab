Soccer’s governing body will use a
Swiss lab to test players at next year’s World Cup in  Brazil  for
doping violations after a Rio de Janeiro medical facility failed
to regain World Anti-Doping Agency accreditation.  The players’ blood and urine samples will be flown to a
WADA-approved laboratory in Lausanne, Switzerland, because the
Rio center “would not be able to achieve re-accreditation in
time for the World Cup,” FIFA said today in an e-mailed
statement.  WADA suspended its accreditation of the Rio laboratory,
known as LADETEC, in August without giving a specific reason.
There are no alternative approved doping control sites in
Brazil.  “FIFA is now taking the necessary logistical steps for the
shipment of samples overseas,” the statement added.  Rio is also the host city for the 2016 Olympic Games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
