Japan ’s exports of aluminum scrap
are headed for a record this year as a weaker yen and higher
recycling capacity in South Korea boost shipments, according to
Mitsui Bussan Metals Co.  “This year’s exports will be a record if the yen and
aluminum prices remain stable,” said Shigeyuki Fukushima,
executive vice president of the unit of Mitsui & Co., Japan’s
second largest trading house. Shipments reached an all-time high
of 148,000 metric tons in 2009 and were 120,000 tons in the
first nine months of this year,  finance ministry  data show.  Demand for scrap in the Asian automotive market is expected
to exceed the 25 percent compound annual growth rate projected
globally over the next five years, as more carmakers move to
build lighter, more fuel-efficient vehicles, according to
Novelis Inc. The Atlanta-based company last year opened  Asia ’s
largest aluminum beverage can recycling center in South Korea
with a capacity of 265,000 tons. A 12 percent depreciation of
the yen this year against the Korean won has kept Japanese scrap
attractive to buyers.  “Average prices of aluminum scrap have increased as South
Korean purchases rose, especially for cans and window frames,”
Fukushima said yesterday. Korean customers prefer Japanese scrap
because of its higher quality and close proximity for inspection
before shipments, he said.  Export prices for  aluminum  scrap, including cans, to  South
Korea  rose to 148.8 yen ($1.50) per kilogram in September,
compared with 113.9 yen a year earlier, according to data from
the finance ministry.  Exports Double  Japan’s  exports  rose 24 percent in the first nine months
from 97,000 tons a year ago, the data showed. Shipments to South
Korea more than doubled to 47,401 tons in the period, while
exports to  China  fell 2.8 percent to 60,100 tons.  Aluminum-can scrap prices in Yokohama jumped to 147.7 yen
per kilogram in December from 101.6 yen in the same month a year
earlier, according to tender results from the city government.
That was the highest since May 2010, the data showed.  Novelis, the unit of  India ’s  Hindalco Industries Ltd. (HNDL) , last
month completed a two-year, $400 million expansion program in
South Korea, it said in a statement Oct. 10. Expansion at its
Yeongju and Ulsan plants increases the company’s annual
production capacity in the region by more than 50 percent to
about 1 million tons of aluminum sheet.  Novelis plans to raise global recycling capacity to 2.1
million tons by 2015 and to 4 million tons by 2020 from 1.2
million tons in 2012, Derek Prichett, vice president for global
recycling, said in October 2012. The company plans to make 50
percent of its products from recycled metal by 2015 and as much
as 80 percent by 2020, from about 39 percent, Prichett said.  The metal for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange has dropped 13 percent this year and closed at $1,809 a
ton yesterday.  LME aluminum stockpiles totaled 5.3 million tons after
reaching a record 5.5 million tons on July 17. The metal is the
second-worst performer among six base metals on the London Metal
Exchange.  To contact the reporters on this story:
