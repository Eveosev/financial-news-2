Somalia’s government appealed for
international aid to help thousands of people affected by a
tropical cyclone that killed at least 150 people in the semi-autonomous northeastern region of Puntland.  The storm, known as 03A, made landfall over the weekend,
resulting in heavy rains and flash floods that left many coastal
and inland areas inaccessible, President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud
said in a statement e-mailed from the capital, Mogadishu.
“Urgent assistance” is required for those stranded by the
disaster, he said.  “Many are feared dead and hundreds of people have lost
their homes and livelihoods, crops and livestock have been lost
and whole villages badly affected,” Prime Minister Abdi Farah Shirdon said in a separate statement.  Puntland, located on the tip of the Horn of  Africa ,
declared autonomy in 1998 and seeks the creation of a federal
Somali government. Companies including  Africa Oil Corp. (AOI)  of
 Canada  and Fort Worth, Texas-based  Range Resources Corp. (RRC)  are
exploring for oil in the semi-arid region.  Puntland Information Minister Abdurrahman Abdi Osman urged
humanitarian aid agencies to organize emergency supplies by
aidrop to coastal areas cut off by the storm. Thousands of
livestock died in flash flooding in the region, he said.  “The death toll now stands at 150 and it can increase at
any time,” he said in a phone interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
