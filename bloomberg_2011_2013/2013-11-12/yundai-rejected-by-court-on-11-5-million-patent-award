The U.S.  Supreme Court  turned away a
 Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  unit’s appeal of an $11.5 million award in a
patent lawsuit over a means of creating customized printed
proposals for prospective customers.  The justices today let stand a federal appeals court ruling
that upheld the award, won by Clear With Computers LLC against
Hyundai Motor America Inc.  Hyundai contended that faulty jury instructions given by a
federal trial judge undermined the company’s bid to invalidate
the Clear With Computers patent. Hyundai said similar
electronic-proposal systems were already available in the
marketplace when the patent application was filed.  The case is Hyundai v. Clear With Computers, 13-296.  To contact the reporter on this story:
