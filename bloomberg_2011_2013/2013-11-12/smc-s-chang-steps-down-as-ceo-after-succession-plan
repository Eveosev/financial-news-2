Morris Chang  stepped down as chief
executive officer of  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (2330) 
after the board of the world’s largest contract maker of chips
approved a  succession plan .  Mark Liu and Wei Che-Chia were named co-presidents and co-CEOs, in line with the plan, the  company  said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday. The two report to Chang, 82, who remains
chairman.  The leadership change, effective yesterday, comes after the
company last month reported its slowest  profit growth  in six
quarters and forecast a drop in revenue as demand for some
smartphones weakens. The chipmaker fell 0.5 percent to NT$104.50
as of 10:20 a.m. in Taipei trading. The shares have gained 7.7
percent this year, compared with a 5.8 percent jump for the
benchmark Taiex index.  Chang, speaking at an investor conference in Taipei last
month, said he would have a hands-on role in the company as
chairman.  TSMC last year promoted Chiang Shang-yi, Liu and Wei as co-chief operating officers. The three executives were to be
groomed for the CEO’s position by taking turns heading the
research and development, business development, and the
operations divisions in six-month stints, the Hsinchu, Taiwan
based company said at the time. Chiang retired last month.  TSMC yesterday also raised the mandatory  retirement age  to
67 from 65, Sun said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
