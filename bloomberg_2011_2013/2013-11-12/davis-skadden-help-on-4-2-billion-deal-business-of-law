Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP advised
 Shire Plc (SHP) , which agreed to buy  ViroPharma Inc. (VPHM)  for about
$4.2 billion to gain treatments for rare diseases and lessen
dependence on its best-selling Vyvanse pill for attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &
Flom LLP advised ViroPharma.  The Davis Polk corporate team includes partners George R. Bason Jr. and William J. Chudd. Additional partners include
Kyoko Takahashi Lin, executive compensation; Michael Mollerus,
tax; and Joel M. Cohen, antitrust and competition advice.  The Skadden team includes mergers and acquisitions partners
Eileen Nugent and Michael Rogan as well as partners Regina Olshan, executive compensation and benefits; Clifford Aronson,
antitrust; Jennifer Bragg, health-care enforcement; Jessica Hough, tax; and Yossi Vebman, derivatives and corporate finance.  Shire will pay $50 a share in cash, 27 percent more than
the closing price of ViroPharma on Nov. 8, the Dublin-based
drugmaker said yesterday in a statement.  The  acquisition  gives Shire access to Cinryze, a medicine
for the inflammatory condition hereditary angioedema, which
complements Shire’s Firazyr for the same malady, the company
said. The purchase marks the company’s third this year under
Flemming Ornskov, who became chief executive officer in April,
and is Shire’s biggest, topping the $3.6 billion takeover of
Canada’s BioChem Pharma Inc. in 2001.  “This is the big deal the market had been waiting for,”
Savvas Neophytou, an analyst at Panmure Gordon & Co., said in a
note to investors yesterday. The purchase is “clearly at an
eye-watering multiple but strategically very sound.”  Based on the price of $4.2 billion, Shire is paying about
58 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization for ViroPharma, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Buyers paid a median of 23 times Ebitda for
biotechnology companies in transactions valued at more than $100
million in the past five years.  For more, click here.  Proskauer, A&O on $1.68 Billion Novartis Deal with Grifols  Novartis AG (NOVN)  agreed to sell a blood-transfusion diagnostics
unit to Spanish health-care company  Grifols SA (GRF)  for $1.68 billion
as the Swiss drugmaker slims its portfolio.  Proskauer Rose LLP was legal adviser to Grifols while the
 New York  office of Allen & Overy LLP is representing Novartis.  The Proskauer team was led by New York-based mergers and

technology, media and communications; Edward Kornreich, health
care; Sigal Mandelker, litigation;  Andrea Rattner, employee
benefits; Stuart Rosow, tax; and Eric Remensperger, real estate.  Allen & Overy’s team was led by partner Eric Shube.  The transaction, Novartis’s largest asset sale since
divesting the Gerber baby food brand in 2007, will probably be
completed in the first half of next year, the Basel-based
drugmaker said in a statement yesterday.  Novartis is conducting a strategic review to see which
market segments it wants to stay in, Chief Executive Officer  Joe Jimenez  said yesterday. He said the company now has three with
global scale: pharmaceuticals, the eye-care business Alcon and
the generics arm Sandoz. Novartis has said it wants its
businesses to be among the industry leaders or will otherwise
consider divesting them.  The company has identified its animal-health business as a
top candidate for a sale, people familiar with the matter said
last week. Novartis is also considering selling its over-the-counter medicines unit and the vaccines operation, they said. No
final decision on those assets has been made, the people said.  For more, click here.  Simpson Thacher, Latham, Dechert on KKR Deal for Brickman Group  KKR & Co. (KKR) , the private-equity firm led by  Henry Kravis  and
