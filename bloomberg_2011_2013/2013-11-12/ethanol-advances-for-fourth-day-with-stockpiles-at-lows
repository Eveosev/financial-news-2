Ethanol extended its longest streak
of gains in almost two months with  stockpiles  at a record low
for the time of year.  Futures jumped 2.1 percent as the Energy Information
Administration may report tomorrow that the supply of gasoline
declined last week. Ethanol inventories are down 26 percent from
this year’s high in January, according to the Energy
Department’s statistical arm.  “We do have fairly tight supply,” said Mike Blackford, a
consultant at INTL FCStone in  Des Moines ,  Iowa . “It’s had a
better bias, a firmer tone.”  Denatured ethanol for December delivery rose 3.6 cents to
$1.742 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade. The gain was the
fourth in a row, the most since Sept. 19. Prices have dropped 20
percent this year.  Gasoline for December delivery decreased 1.01 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $2.5864 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol’s discount to gasoline narrowed 4.61 cents to 84.44
cents a gallon.  The EIA will probably  report  tomorrow that gasoline
supplies declined 900,000 barrels in the week ended Nov. 8,
according to the median estimate of 11 analysts in a survey by
Bloomberg.  Demand for the motor fuel in the prior week jumped to the
highest level since July. Ethanol is blended with gasoline to
meet federal biofuel consumption mandates and stretch supply.  EPA Proposal  Blackford said traders are anticipating the release by the
Environmental Protection Agency of next year’s proposed
consumption targets.  The plan, which may be released this week, has been sent to
the Office of Management and Budget for review. The agency has
held more than 20 separate meetings with outside groups about
the 2014 mandates since Sept. 23, according to its  records .  Oil interests and biofuel industry advocates have argued
about whether the government should maintain, lower or abolish
the standard.  The EPA uses Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs,
tracking certificates attached to each gallon of ethanol to
track compliance with the mandate.  Corn-based RINs decreased 5 cents to 21 cents, while
 advanced RINs , which cover biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol tumbled 7 cents to 23 cents.  Corn for December delivery slipped 2.5 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $4.3225 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel of the grain
makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol. The December crush
spread of corn to ethanol was 17 cents, up from 13 cents
yesterday.  In cash market trading, ethanol rose 17 cents to $2.20 a
gallon in  New York , 3.5 cents to $1.86 in Chicago, 1.5 cents to
$1.95 on the  Gulf Coast  and 3 cents to $1.96 on the West Coast,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  West Coast ethanol’s premium to the Gulf was 1 cent, from a
0.5-cent deficit yesterday, while Chicago’s discount to New York
widened 13.5 cents to 34 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
