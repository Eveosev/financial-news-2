The Philadelphia Eagles signed
former  New York  Jets and Buffalo Bills kick returner and
receiver Brad Smith to bolster their special-teams unit.  Smith, 29, has played quarterback, running back and
receiver in the National Football League, yet has been most
productive on kickoff returns, averaging 25.7 yards on 107
runbacks with four touchdowns.  Smith hadn’t played this year after injuring his ribs
during the preseason and was released by the Bills on Nov. 8.
The Eagles rank 23rd out of 32 teams in kickoff-return yardage.  A former quarterback at the University of Missouri, Smith
spent his first five NFL seasons with the Jets before signing a
four-year, $15 million contract with the Bills in 2011. He’s the
only player in NFL history with a passing, rushing, receiving,
kickoff-return and blocked-punt-return touchdown.  To contact the reporter on this story:
