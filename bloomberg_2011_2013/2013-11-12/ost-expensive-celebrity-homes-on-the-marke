Despite their presence on the big screen or the number of records they’ve sold, most celebrities don’t live in $20 million, $30 million or $50 million homes. Rather, many buy a place for less than $10 million — far from spare change — but nowhere near the kind of properties found  topping the most expensive homes list . For a few celebs, however, their real estate investments are quite significant. Take a look at these eye-popping estates currently for sale and owned by some well-known stars. Celine Dion: $72.5 million The French-Canadian songstress bought two Jupiter Island, FL homes for $12.5 million and $7 million each back in 2004 and 2008, respectively. She turned the two plots of land into a resort-style oasis with several pools, patios, a bridge and floating river between the two waterfront homes. Now that the diva is spending less time at the Florida estate (and performing regularly in Vegas), she has the massive property listed for sale. See more of Celine Dion’s estate  here . Richard Gere: $65 million The actor made a smart investment when he bought in The Hamptons. He purchased two North Haven parcels — one in 2005 for $6.9 million and another in 2007 for $1.675 million. A few updates and years later, Gere has listed the estate for a whopping $65 million. Nicknamed Strongheart Manor, the home boasts 12,000 square feet, 12 bedrooms, 12 bathrooms and more than 300 feet of waterfront. See more of Richard Gere’s home  here . Bob Hope: $50 million The beloved entertainer had a collection of real estate in California, but his John Lautner-designed house in Palm Springs is the best of the bunch. The dramatic house was Lautner’s biggest piece. Dominating the celebrity-friendly enclave of Southride, the corner-lot home was built to resemble a volcano. The modernist structure is constructed of concrete and glass, with an undulating copper roof that rises to an open semi-circle at its center. See more of the Bob Hope estate  here . Jon Bon Jovi: $39.9 million The musician’s rock star-worthy SoHo penthouse is nearly all glass, with 360-degree views of Manhattan. He bought the home in 2007 and reportedly dropped millions in renovations. His work should pay off — even with a price cut, selling a home for almost $40 million isn’t too shabby.

Bob Weinstein: $32 million From “Project Runway” to “The Lord of the Rings” and “My Week With Marilyn,” there are few productions Bob Weinstein is not involved in. If the film producer gets his $32 million asking price for his Greenwich, CT estate, he stands to make quite a profit; he and his wife bought the home for $16 million in 2000.

Tommy Lee Jones: $26.75 million Things you may not know about Oscar-winning actor Tommy Lee Jones: He was a big part of the Florida polo scene and a member of the International Polo Club Palm Beach in the mid-2000s. He built his  50-acre polo estate in Wellington  with the purchase of two separate parcels in 2002 for $4.62 million. Jones isn’t giving up the sport; he’s just spending more time on his other polo ranch in Texas. See more of Tommy Lee Jones’ polo estate  here . Barry Bonds: $25 million Although the retired MLB All-Star spent the majority of his career with the San Francisco Giants, he called an enormous estate in Los Angeles’ Beverly Park home. The estate, like Bonds, is larger than life. Dripping with high-end features, the finishes in the home are both luxurious and ornate. Measuring 17,100 square feet, the estate features a gourmet kitchen, home theater, office with leather wall upholstery and an in-house spa that includes a tanning salon, sauna, hydrotherapy tub and Swedish full-body therapy rooms.

Michael Jordan: $21 million The NBA legend’s custom Chicago estate is heading to auction Nov. 22, but it’s still available to someone willing to drop $21 million before then. Hidden behind high privacy gates and surrounded by evergreen trees, the house has a litany of high-end features, including a cigar room with a custom-built, walk-in humidor. But the pinnacle of the home is undoubtedly the full-size regulation basketball court built to Jordan’s exact specifications. See more of Michael Jordan’s home  here . Tim McGraw and Faith Hill: $20 million The country music superstars own quite a few homes in Tennessee, and they recently listed their largest one — a 753-acre ranch in Franklin — for $20 million. Although  the median Franklin home value  is currently $336,300, a few homes  priced near $20 million are currently on the Franklin real estate market . McGraw and Hill’s home, in particular, is a sprawling ranch previously owned by country music legend Hank Williams Sr. and includes four residences on the property.
