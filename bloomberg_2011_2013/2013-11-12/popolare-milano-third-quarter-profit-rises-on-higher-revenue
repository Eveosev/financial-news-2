Banca Popolare di Milano Scrl ,
engulfed by an internal battle on governance, said third-quarter
profit rose, boosted by increasing revenue that more than offset
higher provisions for bad loans.  Net income was 28.8 million euros ($38.7 million), compared
with 25.4 million euros in the year-earlier period, the Milan-based bank said in a statement today. Earnings beat the 20.4
million-euro average estimate of nine analysts in a Bloomberg
survey.  Popolare di Milano has called a shareholders meeting for
December to appoint a new supervisory board after Chief
Executive Officer Piero Montani resigned, citing lack of
confidence by employees and a “heated debate” between
management and the supervisory board. Chairman  Andrea Bonomi ,
who also announced his resignation, effective in December,
halted a plan to revise governance.  “The real focus will, once again, be on governance rather
than on results,” Anna Maria Benassi, an analyst at Kepler
Cheuvreux, wrote in a note to clients last week.  The  Bank of Italy  asked managers to introduce more balanced
governance after opposition from unions and employees led Bonomi
and Montani to abandon a project in May to transform the bank
into a joint-stock company. The bank was scheduled to present a
new plan today.  Popolare di Milano rose 1.6  percent  to 46.91 cents as of 5
p.m. in Milan trading, giving the bank a market value of 1.5
billion euros.  To contact the reporters on this story:
