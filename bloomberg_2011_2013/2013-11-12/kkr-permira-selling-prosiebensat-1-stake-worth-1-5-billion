KKR & Co. and Permira Advisers LLP
sold 35 million  shares (PSM)  in ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG for about 1.1
billion euros ($1.48 billion).  JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp. placed the
stake on behalf of holding company Lavena Holding 1 GmbH,
according to an e-mailed statement. The shares were sold at
31.53 euros apiece, according to terms obtained by Bloomberg
News. Shares of ProSieben fell 4.9 percent to 31.79 euros at
9:20 a.m. in Frankfurt trading today.  KKR and Permira, which last sold a stake in the German
broadcaster on Sept. 4, will own about 17 percent after the
sale. Private equity and other shareholders in Europe are
attempting to pare their holdings as investors return to the
region’s markets on the back of strengthening economies.  The volume of additional share sales in Europe, the Middle
East and  Africa  year-to-date has doubled to more than $100
billion, compared with the same period in 2012, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  ProSieben reported a 13.9 percent increase in third-quarter
revenue to 576.9 million euros on Nov. 7, beating analysts’
estimates. It said earnings growth for the present quarter was
expected to be lower than in the first nine months of the year
because of spending on investments.  To contact the reporters on this story:
