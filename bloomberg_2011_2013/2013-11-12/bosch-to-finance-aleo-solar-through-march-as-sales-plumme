Robert Bosch GmbH, the biggest car-parts maker, will finance  Aleo Solar AG (AS1)  through March as it
continues to seek a buyer for the German solar-panel maker.  Bosch, which owns 90.7 percent of Aleo Solar, has resumed
talks with interested parties after advanced negotiations with
one potential buyer failed because of the “increasingly
difficult situation on the European solar market,” Aleo Solar
said today in a statement confirmed by Bosch.  Talks with investors will probably continue until at least
the first quarter of next year, according to Aleo Solar. It’s
uncertain whether a sale will take place at all, it said.  The solar manufacturer lost 38 million euros ($51 million)
before interest and taxes in the first nine months of the year
as weaker demand in Europe caused sales to drop 56 percent, it
said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
