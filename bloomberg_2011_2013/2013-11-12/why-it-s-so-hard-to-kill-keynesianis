We all know how stimulus works, right? The government spends money, and then the people who get that money spend it again, which increases gross domestic product and makes us all richer. The interesting thing about this model is that economists abandoned it more than 30 years ago, as John Cochrane  points out : New Keynesian models do predict stimulative effects from government spending. But they do so through a completely different channel from the old Keynesian models that are still popular with most of the public intellectuals who support stimulus. I find it interesting that an economic model with zero percent mindshare among professional macroeconomists has nearly 100 percent mindshare among public intellectuals and politicians. Even the conservatives who oppose stimulus are unlikely to resort to the  Lucas critique ; at best they generally argue from distortion, and at worst they wave their hands and declare that it’s obviously ridiculous to think that government spending could make you richer. It’s tempting to say that this is true of big economic fights in the media: The ideas that capture mindshare are not necessarily the ones most likely to be true, but rather the ones that are easiest to describe. Take supply-side conservatives who believe that tax cuts raise revenue in the immediate future. Their mental model is easy to describe: If you take less of the fruits of people's labor, they will work more. But it is too naive to be a good description of the real world. I  explained why  a few years back: At this point, no conservative economist endorses the “ultra-strong supply-side hypothesis”; even most conservative policy wonks with economics training will not be caught endorsing it, because it’s not true. Not only do we know that the model is incomplete, but we also have data on things like the Bush tax cuts, and they do not show revenue rising. You can make an argument about how, over time, a 0.1 percent increase in the growth rate will compound into enough money to more than pay for the tax cut, but no one thinks that you can cut taxes and have those tax cuts pay for themselves within the 10-year budget window. Nonetheless, among politicians, and a lot of less economically focused wonks and pundits, the ultra-strong supply-side argument remains very popular. Or take efficient markets. On both sides of the aisle, the ultra-strong version of the efficient markets hypothesis -- that markets not only incorporate all known information into the price of assets, but also actually closely approximate the true platonic ideal value that we would see if prices were being set by the Archangel Gabriel -- is very popular. Depending on the issue, both sides mock the idea while also embracing it; you see conservatives argue that some government program must be no good because if people wanted the service, the market would be providing it … and you see progressives argue that some corporate practice must be a boil on the body politic, because if it wasn’t insanely, extortionately profitable, companies wouldn’t be doing it. If I had a dollar for every time I’ve heard or read someone arguing that food advertising must be the next best thing to a secret mind control ray, and offering as “proof” the big sums of money companies spend on it, I would be writing this blog post from my fabulous retirement villa on the Riviera. Yet among economists, the argument is not over whether asset prices reflect the “true” value of the security, because economists don’t think there’s any such thing. When economists debate the efficient markets hypothesis, they’re mostly arguing about the  extent to which nonpublic information is incorporated in the price of assets .  But those sorts of arguments are tedious and abstruse -- I considered taking a few paragraphs to explain the differences between the weak, strong and semi-strong versions of the efficient markets hypothesis, and then realized that I wanted you to stay with me to the end of this article, not open a new tab and go hunting for videos of cats flushing toilets. This same calculation, performed by economics journalists throughout the world, has prevented literally millions of readers from being exposed to the first two sentences of an explanation of the efficient markets hypothesis. On the other hand, debating whether prices are a good reflection of an asset’s “true value” is fun. It doesn’t require any particular economics education, and it provides lots of vivid examples for debate -- you won’t believe how much the family across the street from me paid for a two-bedroom ranch that backs up to the highway! And so 95 percent of the public discussion involves an efficient markets hypothesis that doesn’t exist, at least as far as economists are concerned. The lesson from this, of course, is to beware of choosing your economic models on their sound. Something that can be explained in a couple of short, declarative English sentences is not more likely to be right; in fact, it might be less likely to be right. But it will seem more right than something that requires you to spend hours reading before you can intelligently have an opinion. Plus, you can explain the easy ones to your friends on Facebook! The more complicated theories are often better. But they have one drawback, which is -- hey, have you seen those videos of cats flushing the toilet?
