Crude oil put options rose as the
underlying futures slid to the lowest level since May.  Implied volatility for puts protecting against a 10 percent
drop in January prices increased to 24.56 percent on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange  at 4:10 p.m. compared with 23.65
percent yesterday. The skew, or premium of 90-percent puts to
110-percent calls, rose to 6.4 percentage points from 5.94.  At-the-money January options, a measure of expected futures
swings and a key gauge of value, rose to 18.75 percent from
18.27 percent.  West Texas Intermediate for January delivery declined
$1.95, or 2 percent, to $93.52 a barrel on the Nymex. December-delivery WTI fell $2.10, or 2.2 percent, to $93.04 on
speculation that U.S. oil stockpiles rose an eighth week.  Puts, or bets that prices would fall, accounted for 55
percent of electronic trading volume today. The most-active
options were December $95 calls, which dropped 71 cents to 16
cents a barrel with 4,160 lots trading as of 4:28 p.m. December
$90 puts rose 8 cents to 11 cents on volume of 4,150 lots.  In the previous session, puts accounted for 58 percent of
the 85,721 lots traded. December $90 puts declined 5 cents to 3
cents a barrel on 4,296 contracts. December $95 puts fell 44
cents to 73 cents on volume of 4,028 lots.  Open interest yesterday was highest for December $80 puts,
with 43,234 contracts. Next were December $90 puts with 38,327
lots and December $85 puts with 36,929.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
