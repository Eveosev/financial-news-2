Asian  stocks  rose for a second day,
their first back-to-back gains in three weeks, as investors
weighed earnings and a Chinese pledge to boost the role of the
markets in economic development.  KDDI Corp. jumped to the highest in 13 years after  Japan ’s
second-largest wireless carrier briefed investors on its

maker, surged 7.3 percent after announcing cost cuts. GCL-Poly

third-quarter sales jumped more than 500 percent.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index added 0.4 percent to 139.72 as
of 9:39 p.m. in  Tokyo , with all but one of the 10 industry
groups on the measure gaining. Japan’s Topix index advanced 1.7
percent as the yen fell. The MSCI Asia Pacific excluding Japan
Index lost 0.2 percent.  “The changes that will come out of the secret location in
Beijing are expected to be some of the most liberal economic
changes in post-revolution  China ,” Evan Lucas, Melbourne-based

decades of economic and social policy is expected to be swept
aside in the coming 48 hours.”  China’s top policy makers affirmed that markets must play a
decisive role in the allocation of economic resources, as the
 central committee  of the  Communist Party of China  concluded its
first plenary session under the presidency of Xi Jinping, the
official Xinhua News Agency reported.  Profound Changes  Chinese Politburo member Yu Zhengsheng said last month
reforms to be discussed at the meeting of the party’s Central
Committee will be unprecedented “and will promote profound
changes in every area of the economy and society.” Yu is ranked
fourth in the seven-strong Politburo Standing Committee headed
by party chief and President Xi Jinping.  The Asia-Pacific gauge trades within 3.3 percent from this
year’s high reached in May on speculation the U.S. Federal
Reserve will maintain record stimulus for longer and as  China’s
economy  showed signs of growth. The measure  traded  at 13.6 times
estimated earnings as of yesterday, compared with multiples of
16 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 15 for the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Jakarta Composite Index dropped 1.4 percent to a five-week low after Indonesia’s central bank unexpectedly raised its
benchmark  interest rate  in a bid to narrow a current-account
deficit that has weighed on the rupiah.  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index added 0.1 percent, while New
Zealand’s NZX 50 Index lost 0.1 percent. South Korea’s Kospi

10 percent next fiscal year and for average revenue per user, a
key measure of customer spending, to increase this fiscal year
after a period of decline, a spokesman for KDDI said by phone.  Incitec Pivot surged 7.3 percent to A$2.80 after saying it
will restructure its business to achieve A$20 million ($19
million) of annual cost savings. That was the biggest advance
since October 2011.  GCL-Poly Energy rose 2.9 percent to HK$2.45 after third-quarter polysilicon sales jumped 512 percent from a year earlier
while production increased 78 percent for the period.  Dentsu Rises  Dentsu Inc. (4324)  added 5.4 percent to 3,915 yen. The Japanese

year by 73 percent to 33.1 billion yen ($332 million), compared

biggest casino company by revenue posted third-quarter earnings
that missed analyst estimates on rising competition in Macau.  Taiyo Yuden Co. slumped 11 percent to 1,134 yen, the
biggest decline since March 2011. The component maker trimmed
its net-income forecast to 9 billion yen yesterday,

Bloomberg survey.  Of the companies on the MSCI  Asia  Pacific Index that have
reported quarterly earnings this season and for which Bloomberg
compiles estimates, a little more than 50 percent exceeded
analysts’ profit expectations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
