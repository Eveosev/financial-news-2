Mol Nyrt. (MOGA) ,  Hungary ’s largest
refiner, rose the most in three weeks after a European Union
court overturned a decision ordering the company to repay state
aid of about 30.4 billion forint ($136 million).  The  shares  climbed 1.2 percent to 14,445 forint by close in
Budapest, the biggest gain since Oct. 21, and rebounding from a
two-year low. The company has lost 19 percent of its market
value this year amid a dispute with the Croatian government over
management rights in its INA Industrija Nafte d.d. unit.  Mol didn’t gain unfairly from a 2005 agreement with the
Hungarian government that fixed most of its mining royalty
payments for 15 years, the EU General Court in Luxembourg ruled
today. The European Commission, the EU arm that polices state
subsidies in the 28-nation bloc, concluded in June 2010 Mol
“benefited of a financial advantage,” after the government
raised mining fees in 2008, though the company’s payment
obligations remained unchanged.  “It’s a fairly large sum and an important positive
development amid the ongoing saga with INA,” Csaba Sinka, a
Budapest-based equities analyst at KBC Securities, the local
unit of  KBC Groep NV (KBC) , said by phone. The shares could extend
gains on the ruling as the market is pricing in the possibility
of an appeal by the European Commission, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
