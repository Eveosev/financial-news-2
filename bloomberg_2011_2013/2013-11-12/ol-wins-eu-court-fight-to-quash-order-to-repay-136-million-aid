Mol Nyrt.,  Hungary ’s largest
refiner, won a European Union court case to overturn an EU
decision ordering it to repay state aid of about 30.4 billion
forints ($136 million), or almost one-third of its 2009 profit,
to the Hungarian government.  Mol, which operates refineries in four countries and has
exploration projects in 12 countries, didn’t gain unfairly from
fixed mining royalty payments to the government, the  EU General
Court  in Luxembourg ruled today. Mol shares  advanced  as much as
2.2 percent and were up 1 percent at 10.15 a.m. in Budapest
trading.  The European Commission, the EU arm that polices state
subsidies in the the 28-nation bloc, concluded in June 2010 that
Mol “benefited of a financial advantage by paying lower mining
fees than its competitors.” It  ordered  a repayment of about 112
million euros.  Under an agreement signed by Mol and the government in
2005, the company’s mining royalty payments were fixed for the
majority of its domestic hydrocarbon production until 2020. The
government raised mining fees in 2008, though Mol’s payment
obligations remained at levels set in the 2005 agreement, the EU
said at the time.  The EU court today rejected the commission’s conclusion
that Mol was handed favorable treatment, because other
interested companies could have concluded such an agreement.
There may have been “an absence of interest on the part of
other operators,” the court said.  The EU General Court is the bloc’s second-highest and
rulings can be appealed.  The case is: T-499/10, MOL v. Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
