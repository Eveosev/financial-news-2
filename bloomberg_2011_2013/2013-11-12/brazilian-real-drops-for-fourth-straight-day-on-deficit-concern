Brazil’s real declined for a fourth
straight day on concern the government isn’t doing enough to
curb its  budget deficit .  The currency depreciated 0.2 percent to 2.3362 per  U.S.
dollar  at 10:15 a.m. in Sao Paulo, the weakest level on a
closing basis since Sept. 4. Swap rates on contracts maturing in
January 2019 climbed two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point,
to 12.53 percent on speculation a wider fiscsal shortfall will
drive up borrowing costs.  “The real’s performance is bad due to internal imbalances
such as the deficit,”  Luciano Rostagno , the chief strategist at
Banco Mizuho do Brasil in Sao Paulo, said in a telephone
interview. “It’s possible for Brazil to have a more prolonged
monetary tightening since we don’t see an improvement in the
fiscal policy next year.”  The real has fallen 4.3 percent since Oct. 31, when the
government reported that the budget deficit as a percentage of
gross domestic product was the largest in almost four years. The
drop in the currency is the biggest among major dollar
counterparts tracked by Bloomberg.  A person on the government’s economic team who asked not to
be identified because discussions aren’t public said the federal
government is working to pass a bill this year that would exempt
it from having to compensate when states and cities miss primary
fiscal surplus targets, which exclude interest payments. The
 Finance Ministry ’s press office declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
