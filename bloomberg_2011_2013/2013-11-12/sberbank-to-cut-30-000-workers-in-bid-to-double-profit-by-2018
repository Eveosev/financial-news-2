OAO Sberbank (SBER) , the holder of almost
half of Russians’ bank savings, plans to cut 30,000 workers and
close more than 3,600 branches over the next five years to boost
profitability as loan growth slows.  The measures should help eastern Europe’s largest lender
double profit and assets by the end of 2018, according to
company documents handed out to reporters in Moscow before a
presentation by Chief Executive Officer Herman Gref.  President  Vladimir Putin  is urging the country’s largest
state-run companies to improve efficiencies by cutting costs and
workers after six quarters of slowing economic growth in the
world’s biggest energy supplier. Sberbank, which currently has
about 250,000 employees and 18,400 branches, doesn’t plan any
acquisitions in the coming years, according to Gref.  “Sberbank’s strategy is very ambitious and aggressive,”
 Mark Rubinstein , head of research at IFC Metropol, said by phone
from Moscow. “They’re forecasting really high profit growth.
They plan to boost their effectiveness while cutting costs. This
will lift shares.”  Sberbank extended gains after Gref’s comments, rising 2.4
percent to 104.20 rubles at 6 p.m. in Moscow. The lender’s stock
has surged about 12 percent this year, outpacing the Micex
Index’s 1.7 percent advance.  Acquisitions, Expansion  The former Soviet savings bank has been transformed under
Gref, who was once Putin’s economy minister. It held about 46
percent of the nation’s deposits last year, according to Deposit
Insurance Agency data, and has diversified into  investment
banking  and asset management and expanded with acquisitions in
Eastern  Europe  and  Turkey .  Sberbank bought Troika Dialog, Moscow’s oldest brokerage,
in January 2012 for $1 billion and set up a consumer finance
unit last year with BNP Paribas SA.  “Sberbank is present in 22 countries,” Gref said in the 
presentation  on the company’s website. “We have demonstrated
that not only Russian commodity companies can be major
participants in the world market.”  Slowing Growth  Gref today reiterated Sberbank’s estimate that net income
in 2013 will be 370 billion rubles ($11.3 billion). Profit under
Russian accounting standards rose 7.5 percent in the first 10
months of the year from the same period last year, Sberbank said
on Nov. 8.  The bank sees corporate loan growth slowing to a range
between 18 percent to 20 percent in 2014, and then to 13 percent
to 15 percent by 2018, according to the presentation. Retail
lending growth will slow to 22 percent to 25 percent next year
and to 12 percent to 15 percent by 2018, it said.  Weak economic growth in  Russia  over the next five years,
increased competition, the growing cost of attracting customer
financing, tighter bank regulation and credit-market risks are
some of the challenges facing Sberbank, the presentation said.  “The new targets match the adjusted expectations and are
consistent with the more muted macro outlook for Russia,” VTB
Capital analyst Svetlana Aslanova wrote in an e-mailed report.  To contact the reporters on this story:
