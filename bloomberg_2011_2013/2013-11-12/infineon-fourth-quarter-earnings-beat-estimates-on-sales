Infineon Technologies AG (IFX) ,  Europe ’s
second-largest semiconductor maker, predicted a profitability
decline for its first quarter because of a sales drop at its
power-management chip unit.  Infineon fell the most in 3 1/2 months after saying
earnings before interest and taxes, which the manufacturer calls
segment result, will amount to 8 percent to 10 percent of sales
in the three months through December. The fourth-quarter margin
widened to 14.1 percent from 11.8 percent a year earlier.  A quarter-on-quarter sales decline will be “significantly
more pronounced” for the power-management and chip-card and
security businesses, Neubiberg, Germany-based Infineon said
today in a  statement .  The company is pioneering production from larger-diameter
wafers, which Infineon has said will help it manufacture 2.5
times as many chips from each slice. Increasing production in
Dresden,  Germany , of chips cut from 300-millimeter silicon
wafers means that reaching Infineon’s target for a 15 percent
profit margin will take some time, Chief Executive Officer
Reinhard Ploss said on July 30.  Infineon fell as much as 4.7 percent to 6.95 euros, the
steepest intraday drop since July 30, and was trading down 4.5
percent at 9:32 a.m. in  Frankfurt . That pared the stock’s gain
this year to 14 percent, valuing the company at 7.52 billion
euros ($10.1 billion).  The fourth-quarter segment result jumped 28 percent from a
year earlier to 148 million euros, Infineon said. Analysts on
average  projected  Ebit of 134.5 million euros. Earnings were
helped by a reduction in risk allowances for inventory, the
manufacturer said.  Revenue rose 7.2 percent from a year earlier to 1.05
billion euros, matching the company’s forecast. Infineon
predicted today that first-quarter sales will total 960 million
euros to 1 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
