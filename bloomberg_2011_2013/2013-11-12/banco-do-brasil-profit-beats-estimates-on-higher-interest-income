Banco do Brasil SA ,  Latin America ’s
largest lender by assets, posted third-quarter profit that beat
analyst estimates as it earned more interest on assets.  Adjusted net income, which excludes one-time charges,
dropped to 2.61 billion reais ($1.1 billion) from 2.66 billion
reais a year earlier, the Brasilia-based company said today in a
filing. The results  topped  the 2.51 billion-real estimate of
nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Banco do Brasil, led by Chief Executive Officer Aldemir Bendine, 49, stopped lowering  interest rates  it charges
customers after the central bank raised the nation’s Selic
benchmark rate in each of the past five monetary-policy
meetings. Net interest income, or revenue from interest earned
on assets compared with payments to depositors, increased 4.5
percent to 11.8 billion reais in the third quarter from a year
earlier, according to the statement.  The lender’s stock has  increased  9.7 percent this year, the
best performance among banks in the Ibovespa benchmark index.
That compares with a decline of 14 percent for the gauge.  Banco do Brasil’s loan book expanded 22.5 percent to 652.3
billion reais at the end of the third quarter from a year
earlier, according to the statement. The bank lowered its
estimate for net interest income growth to between 2 percent and
5 percent this year from 4 percent to 7 percent and said it
expects lending growth of 17 percent to 21 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
