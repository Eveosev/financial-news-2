Greenko Group Plc (GKO) , an Indian
renewable developer backed by  Singapore ’s sovereign wealth fund,
has completed a 51-megawatt wind project.  The completion of phase one of the Balavenkatpuram wind
farm in Andhra Pradesh state boosts Greenko’s capacity by 14
percent to 411 megawatts, the company said in an e-mailed
statement. It seeks to reach 600 megawatts by the end of the
financial year, Chief Executive Officer Anil Chalamalasetty
said.  The project will sell its output to the local utility under
a 25-year contract, it said. Greenko, which received a 100
million pound ($160 million) investment from the Government of
Singapore Investment Corp. in March, plans to build 2,000
megawatts of hydropower and wind assets by 2018.  To contact the reporter on this story:
