U.K. Energy Secretary  Ed Davey  asked
energy companies to explain the “wide variation” in what they
charge consumers for a government green program.  There needs to be “much greater transparency on the costs
that companies are claiming,” Davey told a conference in London
today. “Despite asking lots of questions, we are not getting
very good answers.”  Energy department figures show the Energy Company
Obligation accounts for 4 percent of household fuel bills this
year, or 47 pounds ($75), the biggest share among environmental
or social programs. EDF Energy Plc said today the levy will cost
customers 98 pounds next year, while  SSE Plc (SSE)  has said the
measure will add 59 pounds for 2013 to 2014.  The ECO charge is subject to a review ordered by Prime
Minister  David Cameron ’s government last month after energy
companies raised prices, in part blaming the levy. EDF today
became the fifth Big Six utility to raise prices, at a slower
pace than its peers because it anticipates reduced social and
environmental charges. It may review tariffs if cuts fail to
materialize, it said in an e-mailed statement today.  The levy, which pays for insulation and other efficiency
measures for poor households, is expected to cost 1.3 billion
pounds a year, the same as a similar program it replaced, Davey
said.  “You don’t have to have a Ph.D in maths to work out ECO
shouldn’t be having any impact on bills because it just replaces
what another scheme cost,” he said.  General Taxation  Davey said in an interview in the Sunday Telegraph on Nov.
10 that two of the green levies could be paid for by taxation, a
suggestion played down by a person familiar with Chancellor of
the Exchequer  George Osborne ’s budget plans. Davey said today
announcements on reducing the impact of subsidies on bills would
be made on or before the Autumn Statement due Dec. 5.  EDF said ECO is expected to cost each dual-fuel, or gas-and-electric, customer 98 pounds next year, noting the cost of
the levy is rising. In evidence to the Energy and Climate Change
Committee published this month, the utility said energy-policy
costs added 83.17 pounds in 2012 and 101.33 pounds this year.  SSE Plc said in its evidence that ECO added 55 pounds in
2012 to 2013 and 59 pounds in 2013 to 2014.  Centrica Plc (CNA) ’s
British Gas said climate change policies added 112 pounds in
2012, 133 pounds in 2013 and will add 183 pounds in 2014. RWE
Npower Plc said “obligations” fell from 67 pounds in 2011 to
65 pounds in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
