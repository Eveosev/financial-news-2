The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from non-payment declined,

borrowers outside  Japan  dropped 1 basis point to 137 basis

Banking Group Ltd. prices show. The gauge climbed to its highest
since Nov. 5 yesterday, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell 1.5 to 90.75 basis
points as of 9:32 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices show. The
benchmark is poised for its lowest close since Oct. 31,
according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index decreased 1 basis point
to 104.5 as of 11:18 a.m. in Sydney, according to National
Australia Bank Ltd. The measure fell 1.1 basis points yesterday,
according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
