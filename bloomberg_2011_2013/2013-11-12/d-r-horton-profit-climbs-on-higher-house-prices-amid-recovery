D.R. Horton Inc. , the largest U.S. homebuilder by revenue, reported a higher quarterly profit as it increased prices amid a nationwide housing recovery.  Net income was $139.5 million, or 40 cents a share, for its fiscal fourth quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with $100.1 million, or 30 cents, a year earlier, the Fort Worth, Texas-based company said in a statement today. The average  estimate  of 15 analysts was 40 cents a share, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  U.S. homebuilders have increased profit margins by cutting costs and raising prices as a tight  supply  of existing properties boosts demand.  Purchases  of new U.S. homes rose 7.9 percent in August from the previous month to a annual rate of 421,000, according to the Commerce Department.  “D.R. Horton is benefiting from pricing power across the industry,”  David N. Williams , an analyst with Williams Financial Group in Dallas, said in a telephone interview before the results were released. “There’s such a lack of supply today that builders are able press the prices, and we have low interest rates so prices can escalate more.”  D.R. Horton’s fourth-quarter homebuilding revenue rose to $1.8 billion from $1.3 billion a year earlier. The company sold 6,866 homes, up from 5,575. The average price climbed 15 percent from a year earlier to $261,400.  Most of those sales were completed before  mortgage rates  rose two a two-year high in August, causing some would-be buyers to hold back. Orders in the quarter decreased 2 percent to 5,160 homes from a year earlier.  The results were announced before U.S. markets opened. D.R. Horton fell 0.4 percent to $18.06 yesterday. The shares have lost 8.7 percent this year, compared with a 7.1 percent decline for the 11-company Standard & Poor’s Supercomposite Homebuilding  Index .
