Godawari Power (GODPI)  & Ispat Ltd.’s solar-thermal plant, Asia’s biggest, is generating more power than
expected, allaying criticism that the technology was failing in
India, a government official said.  Godawari’s 50-megawatt project is at times generating 10
megawatts more than its stated capacity, said Tarun Kapoor, head
of solar policy at the Ministry of New and  Renewable Energy .  “People were saying that solar thermal was not going to
work out in India,” Kapoor said at the Intersolar conference in
Mumbai today. “That has now been proven wrong.”  Godawari’s plant is the first of seven solar-thermal
generators planned in India. The remaining six have had their
deadlines extended to February from May, Kapoor said. Plants by
 Reliance Power Ltd. (RPWR)  and Megha Engineering & Infrastructures Ltd.
should be finished soon, he said.  Solar-thermal technology focuses sunlight on liquids to
produce steam to run conventional turbines. The other way to
generate power from sunlight is to use photovoltaic panels to
convert the rays directly to electricity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
