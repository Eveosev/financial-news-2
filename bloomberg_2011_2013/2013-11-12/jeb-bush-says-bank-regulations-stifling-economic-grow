Former Florida Governor  Jeb Bush 
told top Wall Street executives today that new banking
regulations are stifling economic growth by crimping firms’
ability to lend money and raise capital.  “For larger banks, the rules are so complicated that it’ll
take five years to put them in place,” Bush said today in New
York at the annual meeting of the Securities Industry &
Financial Markets Association. For smaller banks, the
complexities and uncertainties surrounding new rules can be a
“deal-killer completely,” he said.  Bush, 60, the younger brother of former President  George W. Bush  and son of former President George H.W. Bush, is a
potential candidate for the office in 2016. A Quinnipiac
University national poll released last month showed Jeb Bush
receiving 11 percent support in the Republican field, trailing
Senator  Rand Paul  of Kentucky, New Jersey Governor  Chris Christie  and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida.  U.S. banks, “while having made some terrible and costly
decisions in the past,” now are doing business more
responsibly, Bush said.  Sifma, Wall Street’s largest lobbying group, is sponsoring
its annual meeting at the Marriott Marquis hotel in Times
Square. Former President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, addressed
guests yesterday. Speakers today include Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein and BlackRock
Inc. CEO Laurence D. Fink.  To contact the reporter on this story:
