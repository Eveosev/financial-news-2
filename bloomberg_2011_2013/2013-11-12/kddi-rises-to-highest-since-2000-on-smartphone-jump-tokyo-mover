KDDI Corp. (9433)  rose to the highest in
more than 13 years in  Tokyo  trading after  Japan ’s second-largest
wireless carrier held investor briefings on the outlook for
earnings and revenue from users.  The stock  jumped  5.1 percent to 5,970 yen, its highest
closing price since May 2000. The company is briefing more than
100 institutional investors, including at meetings this week.  The company expects operating earnings to rise more than 10
percent next fiscal year and for average revenue per user, a key
measure of customer spending, to increase this fiscal year after
a period of decline, Satoshi Tsuruta, a spokesman for KDDI, said
by phone. KDDI, which trades at a lower price-to-earnings
multiple than SoftBank Corp., is tapping into demand for Apple
Inc.’s iPhone to drive sales as consumers shift away from older
handsets.  “KDDI’s performance is good and its share price is still
comparatively cheap,” said Satoru Kikuchi, an analyst at SMBC
Nikko Securities Inc. in Tokyo. “KDDI has explained good
results to investors in Japan and overseas.”  KDDI added 158,900 net users in October, while SoftBank
gained 229,400 and  NTT Docomo Inc. (9437)  added 37,100 subscribers
during the month.  Docomo leads the Japanese wireless sector with a 44.5
percent market share. KDDI has about 28.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
