Sales of American Eagle silver coins
by the  U.S. Mint  since the start of the year surpassed the
annual record as the futures market rallied from the lowest in
34 months.  Sales reached almost 40.2 million ounces, the mint said
yesterday in an e-mail. Authorized purchasers bought the full
weekly allocation of 500,000 coins, boosting the total this year
above the previous all-time high of almost 39.9 million ounces
in 2011, it said.  “Strong demand for silver coins should be a supporting
factor for the price,” said  Daniel Briesemann , an analyst at
Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt . Physical demand has limited the
price drop in 2013, during which silver has retreated 31
percent, he said.  Surging sales of bars, jewelry and coins helped to support
gold and silver prices this year after they plunged into a  bear
market  in April as some investors lost faith in precious metals
as a store of value, amid a U.S. equity rally and concern the
 Federal Reserve  will taper its stimulus program. Sales of gold
 coins  may rise to a record this year, Richard Peterson, the
acting director of the mint, said in June.  Silver futures on the Comex in  New York  are heading for the
biggest drop since 1981. Gold futures have dropped 24 percent,
heading for the first annual decline since 2000.  Retail Demand  “The retail demand has remained very strong especially for
silver,” Scott Carter, the chief executive officer of Los
Angeles-based Lear Capital, a precious-metals dealer, said in a
telephone interview. “The lower prices and uncertainty because
of the government shutdown made silver very attractive” for
coin buyers, he said.  Silver futures advanced 14 percent to $20.765 an ounce from
$18.17 on June 28, when the metal touched the lowest since Aug.
24, 2010. Futures trading volumes today were 72 percent higher
than the average for the past 100 days at this time, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Imports by  China , the world’s second-biggest silver user,
advanced each month from May to August. The U.S. is the top
consumer of the metal.  In January, the mint’s  sales  reached an all-time monthly
high of 7.498 million ounces. The  U.S. Mint  suspended sales of
silver coins for more than a week in January because of a lack
of inventory. The mint plans to issue its last weekly allocation
of 2013 coins on Dec. 9.  Sales Halt  The halt in sales next month may push up the premium that
wholesale dealers charge to customers,  Frank McGhee , the head
dealer at Integrated Brokerage Services LLC in  Chicago , said in
a telephone interview.  The premium, around 18 percent last month, “could jump
again as the demand remains buoyant and supplies will shrink,”
he said. The premium surged to 25 percent in April, the highest
since 2008, according to Richard Nachbar, a coin dealer based in
Williamsville, New York.  Silver futures reached a 31-year high of $49.845 on April
25, 2011, and gold rose to a record $1,923.70 an ounce on Sept.
6, 2011.  To contact the reporters on this story:
