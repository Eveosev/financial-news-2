Xerox Corp. (XRX) , the printer and
photocopier pioneer, predicted that 2014 earnings will be $1.10
to $1.16 a share, excluding some items, as business services
account for a bigger chunk of its revenue.  Earnings will be $1.08 to $1.10 in the current year on that
basis, Xerox said today before its annual investor conference,
reiterating a previous forecast. Analysts have estimated profit
of $1.09 this year and $1.15 in 2014, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer  Ursula Burns  is increasingly
relying on services to help offset the decline of document
printing, which was once the company’s biggest revenue source.
Xerox also expects to spend as much as $500 million on
acquisitions to help further the expansion.  “Fifty-six percent of our revenue now comes from services
and we’re on track to grow that number to 66 percent by 2017,”
she said in the statement.  Xerox expects to spend another $500 million on stock
buybacks, bringing its repurchase plan to about $1.5 billion, as
well as $300 million on dividends.  Shares of the Norwalk, Connecticut-based company rose 4
percent to $10.69. The stock has climbed 57 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
