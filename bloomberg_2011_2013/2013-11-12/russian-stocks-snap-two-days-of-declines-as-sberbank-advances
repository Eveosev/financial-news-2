Russian stocks  rose for the first
time in three days as OAO Sberbank, the nation’s biggest lender,
rallied on plans to double profit in the next five years.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  added 0.6 percent to 1,491.85 by 12:26 p.m.
in Moscow, after dropping to the lowest in a month yesterday. Of
50 stocks, 16 retreated and 34 rose. Sberbank increased 1.3
percent in Moscow and  London . OAO Gazprom, the nation’s biggest
company, climbed 1.1 percent to 146.40 rubles.  Sberbank plans to double profit and assets in 2014 through
2018 and sees its return on capital at 18 to 20 percent in the
period, according to a strategy presentation today. The Micex
slumped yesterday as improving U.S. data damped optimism for
continued stimulus from the Federal Reserve.  “Sberbank’s strategy is very ambitious and aggressive,”
Mark Rubinstein, head of research at IFC Metropol, said by phone
from Moscow. “They’re forecasting really high profit growth.
They plan to boost their effectiveness while cutting costs. This
will lift shares.”  Sberbank plans to cut 30,000 employees and close 20 to 25
percent of branches over the next five years, Chief Executive
Officer Herman Gref and Denis Bugrov, Sberbank senior vice
president, told reporters in Moscow today.  Gazprom Climbs  Gazprom rallied after JPMorgan Chase & Co. raised it to the
equivalent of buy, citing prospects for a gas contract with
 China  and switching to a dividend payout based on international
reporting standards, according to an e-mailed note.  Gazprom fell 1.8 percent yesterday after Interfax reported
Ukraine’s state-run energy company halted purchases from the
natural-gas exporter.  “The inability to reach a compromise on the issue in the
near-term would be negative for Gazprom,” VTB Capital analysts
led by Dmitry Loukashov said in an e-mailed note.  OAO Moscow Exchange increased 3 percent to 64.43 rubles
after MSCI Inc. said last week it’s adding the nation’s main
bourse to its  Russia  Index, effective Nov. 27.  Brent fell 0.2 percent to $106.19 in London, while West
Texas Intermediate crude oil traded 0.3 percent lower at $94.86
in New York. Russia receives about half of its budget revenue
from oil and natural gas sales. The Micex retreated last week as
Russia cut its average annual economic growth forecast to 2.5
percent through 2030 and the nation’s central bank left its main
lending rates unchanged for a 14th month.  The  RTS Index (RTSI$)  jumped 0.3 percent to 1,431.80. Russian
equities have the cheapest  valuations  among 21 emerging
economies monitored by Bloomberg, with shares on the Micex
trading at 4.2 times projected 12-month earnings, compared with
a multiple of 10.4 for the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
