Platinum demand will exceed supply
by the most since 1999 this year as more industrial purchases
and investment outweigh slower buying by jewelers and carmakers,
 Johnson Matthey Plc (JMAT)  said. Palladium’s shortfall will narrow as
consumption falls faster than supply.  While car manufacturers will buy less platinum for the
first time since 2009, more demand from chemical, electrical and
glass industries and record investment will widen the shortage
by 78 percent to 605,000 ounces, London-based Johnson Matthey
said today in a report. Palladium’s deficit will narrow 36
percent to 740,000 ounces as less electrical, jewelry and
investment demand outweighs the biggest ever purchases for metal
used in catalytic converters and lower Russian stockpile sales.  The metals outperformed gold and silver this year on
speculation improving economies will boost demand for materials
used in car pollution control devices. Lower supply from  South
Africa  because of mine strikes and cutbacks and falling sales
from Russian government palladium inventories helped keep the
commodities in a shortage since 2012. The deficits will probably
continue next year, Johnson Matthey said.  “We expect little or no serious recovery in South African
supplies,” Alison Cowley, a market analyst at Johnson Matthey,
said in an interview in London. For platinum, “we’re seeing
good demand from most industrial applications. In palladium it’s
really an autocatalyst story.”  Platinum for immediate delivery slipped 6.8 percent to
$1,435.30 an ounce in London this year. It will trade from
$1,360 to $1,580 in the next six months, averaging $1,465,
Johnson Matthey said. Palladium rose 6.9 percent to $752.40 an
ounce since the start of January and is expected to average $760
in the next six months, ranging from $680 to $815. The company
said this market review publication will be its last.  Vehicle Demand  Platinum buying from carmakers will fall 2 percent to 3.13
million ounces this year on weaker demand for diesel cars in
Europe and  India , said Johnson Matthey, which makes about one in
three of the world’s catalytic converters. Palladium usage in
cars will rise 4 percent to 6.97 million ounces on a stronger
market in  China , where gasoline vehicles use more of the metal.  Gross platinum demand will rise 4.9 percent to a record
8.42 million ounces even as jewelry purchases slip 1.4 percent
to 2.74 million ounces, the company said. Gross palladium
consumption will fall 3.4 percent to 9.63 million ounces as
combined usage across chemical, electrical and dental industries
falls to the lowest since 2004. Jewelry buying will drop 12
percent to a 10-year low of 390,000 ounces, it estimates.  Jewelry Buying  “Jewelry is lower than last year in platinum but it’s
still pretty strong and there’s lots of potential for growth
there,” Lucy Bloxham, research manager at Johnson Matthey, also
said in an interview in  London . “Manufacturers have been moving
away from producing palladium jewelry. There’s just limited
consumer demand really.”  Platinum investment will rise 68 percent to a record
765,000 ounces this year as palladium investment slumps 84
percent to 75,000 ounces, the researcher expects. Absa Bank Ltd.
listed a platinum-backed exchange-traded product in Johannesburg
in April and has regulatory approval to list a palladium-backed
product there. That may spur additional demand from South
African investors and widen the shortage, Johnson Matthey said.  Recycling of both metals will reach a record this year,
with scrapping rising 1.7 percent to 2.08 million ounces for
platinum and 7.4 percent to 2.46 million ounces for palladium,
according to the report.  Mine Output  Platinum mine output that fell to a 12-year low in 2012
will gain 1.6 percent to 5.74 million ounces this year as
Zimbabwean production rises, Johnson Matthey said. Palladium
supply will slip 1.5 percent to 6.43 million ounces in 2013, the
lowest since 2002.  Palladium sales from Russian government inventories, a
state secret, will probably total 100,000 ounces, compared with
as much as 1 million ounces in 2010, the company estimates. The
stockpiles are minimal and won’t significantly determine the
market balance any more, it said.  Rhodium’s shortage will widen to 14,000 ounces this year,
from 1,000 ounces in 2012, as demand rises 4.3 percent to a six-year high of 1.02 million ounces and supply remains unchanged,
Johnson Matthey said. The commodity is mainly used in catalytic
converters and also in the chemical and glass industries. It
fell 9.3 percent to $980 an ounce this year, according to
Johnson Matthey  prices  on Bloomberg.  Coating Discs  Ruthenium consumption will climb 25 percent to 828,000
ounces on higher electrical use. It’s mostly used for coating
computer hard disks. It slid 37 percent to $57 an ounce this
year. Demand for iridium, used in spark plugs and for growing
metal oxide crystals, will increase 2.1 percent to 198,000
ounces. Prices dropped 57 percent to $450 an ounce this year.  “Rhodium’s been in surplus now for a little while so we’re
looking at a metal for which there are some above-ground
stocks,” Cowley said. For ruthenium and iridium, “producers
can easily meet demand and they’re not able to sell all their
metal in every single year. They’re very, very small markets and
very illiquid. If the price is going down that tells you that
there are more sellers than buyers.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
