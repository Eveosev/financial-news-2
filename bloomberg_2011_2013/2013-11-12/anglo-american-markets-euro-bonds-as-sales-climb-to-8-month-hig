Anglo American Plc (AAL)  and  Total SA (FP)  are
leading at least 8.8 billion euros ($12 billion) of bond sales
in  Europe ’s busiest day for issuance since March 5.  The U.K.-based miner sold a total 1.5 billion euros of
bonds while Europe’s second-largest oil producer issued 1.5
billion euros of securities, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Corporate treasurers are taking advantage of historically
low borrowing costs. The extra yield investors demand to hold
investment-grade bonds instead of  government securities  is 129
basis points compared with an average for the past five years of
212 basis points, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
index data.  “We’re coming into the end of the year so if you need to
issue you should really just get it done,” said Graham Neilson,
a strategist at Cairn Capital in  London , which manages about $10
billion. “There’s plenty of liquidity and spreads have
definitely tightened.”  Anglo marketed 600 million euros of seven-year notes to
yield 142 basis points more than the mid-swap rate and 900
million euros of four-year bonds at a spread of 97 basis points,
according to a person with knowledge of the sale.  James Wyatt-Tilby, a spokesman for the London-based
company, said proceeds from the bond sale will be used for
general corporate purposes.  Paris-based Total issued 850 million euros of eight-year
securities to yield 47 basis points more than the swap rate and
650 million euros of 12-year notes at a spread of 65 basis
points, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Daimler Bonds  Also in the market today, German luxury carmaker  Daimler AG (DAI) 
sold 1 billion euros of bonds maturing in November 2018 to yield
43 basis points more than swaps, a person familiar with the
matter said.  Fincantieri SpA, an Italian shipbuilder based in Trieste,
is issuing 300 million euros of five-year notes to yield 3.875
percent.  The cost of insuring investment-grade debt in euros climbed
from a 3 1/2-year low, with the Markit iTraxx Europe index of
credit-default swaps on 125 companies rising 1.4 basis points to
83 basis points at 2:55 p.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
