Cattle futures held near a 10-month
high on signs of tightening U.S. supplies. Hog prices slid.  Meatpackers processed an estimated 607,000 animals in the
week through through Nov. 9, a 2.3 percent decline from a week
earlier and a 4 percent reduction compared with the same period
a year earlier, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.  “The biggest issue is supply,”  Rich Nelson , the chief
strategist at Allendale Inc. in McHenry,  Illinois , said in a
telephone interview. “It is a seasonal drop, and this will be
dramatic,” compared with previous years.  Cattle futures for February delivery fell less than 0.1
percent to $1.3435 a pound at 10:05 a.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, after reaching $1.3475, the highest for a
most-active contract since Jan. 15.  Hog futures for December settlement slipped 0.4 percent to
87.675 cents a pound on the CME.  Feeder-cattle futures for January settlement gained 0.2
percent to $1.6445 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
