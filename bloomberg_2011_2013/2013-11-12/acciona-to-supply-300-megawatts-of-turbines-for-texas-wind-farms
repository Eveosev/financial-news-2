Acciona SA (ANA) , the Alcobendas, Spain-based infrastructure and renewable-energy company, sold turbines
with 300 megawatts of capacity for two Texas wind farms for more
than $400 million.  The order, Accionaâ€™s largest in the U.S. for its 3-megawatt
turbines, includes a 10-year operations and maintenance
contract, the company said today in an e-mailed statement.  Deliveries will begin next year and the two wind farms will
be operational in 2015, according to the statement.  The buyer of the turbines was not identified.  To contact the reporter on this story:
