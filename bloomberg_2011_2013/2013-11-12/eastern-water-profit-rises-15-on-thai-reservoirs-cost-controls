Eastern Water Resources Development
and Management Pcl (EASTW) , the largest private water-provider in
Thailand, said third-quarter profit rose 15 percent, boosted by
improved cost-controls and reservoir water levels.  Net income was 345.7 million baht ($11 million) compared
with 300.8 million baht in the year-earlier period. Revenue was
almost unchanged in the quarter at 953.5 million baht, the
