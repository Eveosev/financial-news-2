Italy’s one-year borrowing costs
fell to a record low at a sale of 6.5 billion euros ($8.7
billion) of bills, the first auction after the  European Central
Bank  unexpectedly cut its benchmark  interest rate .  The Rome-based Treasury sold 365-day bills at 0.688
percent, down from 0.999 percent at the previous auction Oct.
10. Investors bid for 1.80 times the amount offered, up from
1.72 last month.  “The ECB rate move has added to the positive environment
for short-dated peripheral paper, fueling the decline” in
Italian and Spanish government bill yields, Elia Lattuga, a
fixed-income strategist at UniCredit SpA, wrote in a note to
investors before the sale.  Italy’s 10-year bond yield rose 2 basis points to 4.2
percent after the sale at 11:10 a.m. in Rome, leaving the
difference with comparable German bunds at 236.4 basis points.  Italy redeems about 7.5 billion euros of bills Nov. 14.
Today’s sale comes after the country last week issued 22.3
billion euros of government inflation-linked bonds aimed at
retail investors. Following the record issue, the single biggest
ever by a European government, the Treasury may trim its
issuance plan for the rest of the year, Italian debt agency head
Maria Cannata told SkyTG24 television in an interview yesterday.  The country returns to the market tomorrow, with the sale
of as much as 5.5 billion euros of securities including three-year debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
