Hindalco Industries Ltd. (HNDL) ,  India ’s
second-largest aluminum producer, reported a 0.6 percent decline
in second-quarter profit, which missed analysts’ estimates, due
to lower metals prices.  Net income  dropped to 3.57 billion rupees ($56.1 million),
or 1.85 rupees a share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, from
3.59 billion rupees, or 1.87 rupees, a year earlier, the Mumbai-based company said today in a stock exchange filing. That missed
the 3.85 billion rupee median of 26 analyst estimates compiled
by Bloomberg. Sales at Hindalco, which also produces copper and
its byproducts, rose 2.3 percent to 63.05 billion rupees.  Earnings were hampered by weaker prices of aluminum and
copper on the London Metal Exchange. The average price of
aluminum, the lightweight metal used to make aircraft and
beverage cans, was 6.7 percent lower in the period, while copper
fell 8.8 percent.  Hindalco, which pegs its domestic sales to the dollar-denominated price of metals on the LME, benefited from the
rupee’s 11 percent decline against the greenback in the last
quarter, with revenue from aluminum rising 11 percent to 23.43
billion rupees. Copper sales declined 2.3 percent to 39.74
billion rupees.  Costs rose 2.4 percent to 59.6 billion rupees in the three-month period, according to the filing.  To contact the reporters on this story:
