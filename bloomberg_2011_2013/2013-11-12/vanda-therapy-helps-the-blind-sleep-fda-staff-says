  Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc. (VNDA) ’s
experimental drug should be approved to regulate the circadian
rhythms of blind people and help them sleep, a U.S. regulatory
reviewer said. The shares jumped 96 percent.  The medicine, known as tasimelteon, is effective at
synchronizing the body with a 24-hour cycle, Food and Drug
Administration staff said today in a  report  ahead of a Nov. 14
meeting of agency advisers. The drugmaker  climbed  to $13.30 at
the close in New York, its biggest increase since May 2009. The
shares have more than quadrupled in the last 12 months.  No approved treatments exist for the condition called
non-24-hour disorder, which affects as many as 95,000 totally
blind people in the U.S, Vanda said. Most people have a master
body clock that naturally runs longer than 24 hours and light
resets the clock, according to the Rockville, Maryland-based
company.  Patients with non-24-hour disorder now try the hormone
melatonin with mixed results. Vanda studied its compound’s
ability to “entrain” or modify circadian rhythms.  The FDA is expected to decide whether to approve
tasimelteon, which Vanda has proposed calling Hetlioz, by Jan.

is licensed to  Novartis AG (NOVN)  in the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
