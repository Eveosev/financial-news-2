Treasury  10-year (USGG10YR)  yields reached the
highest level in eight weeks, as signs America’s economy is
gathering momentum underpinned the case for the  Federal Reserve 
to reduce asset purchases.  The benchmark notes fell before the U.S. auctions $30
billion in three-year notes today. Treasuries maturing in longer
than 10 years slid 11 percent this year, the worst performers
among 144 sovereign indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Fed Bank of
Atlanta President  Dennis Lockhart  said a move by the central
bank to trim its $85 billion of monthly bond buying “could very
well take place” next month.  “Tapering may not be as far in the future as initially
thought,” said  Sean Simko , who oversees $8 billion at SEI
Investments Co. in Oaks,  Pennsylvania . “You had a couple of
data points that were better than expected, including payroll
numbers. There’s no reason the market will turn away from the
auctions this week. The levels are starting to look more
attractive.”  The U.S. 10-year yield climbed three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 2.77 percent as of 11:37 a.m. in New York
from the close on Nov. 8. The 2.5 percent note due in August
2023 fell 1/4, or $2.50 per $1,000 face amount, to 97 22/32. The
yield reached 2.79 percent, the highest level since Sept. 18.  Yield Level  The  30-year yield  rose two basis points to 3.86 percent
after increasing to 3.88 percent, the highest since Sept. 11.
The Treasury market was closed yesterday for Veterans’ Day.  The three-year notes scheduled for sale yielded 0.65
percent in pre-auction trading, compared with 0.71 percent at
the previous sale on Oct. 8. Investors bid for 3.05 times the
available debt last month, the lowest bid-to-cover ratio since
an auction in June.  Treasuries lost the most in four months Nov. 8 after a
report showed the economy added more jobs in October than
forecast, boosting speculation the Fed may slow bond purchases
as soon as its Dec. 17-18 meeting.  “The market is a bit oversold,” said Thomas di Galoma,
head of U.S. rates sales at ED&F Man Capital Markets in New
York. “The three-year note should go well, given the fact that
the market has backed up since the nonfarm-payroll number.”  Measure Assessment  The 14-day  relative strength   index (BFCIUS)  for the Treasury 10-year
note yield was at 62.8, according to Bloomberg data. The index
was at 48.5 on Nov. 7 before climbing to 61.3 the next day after
a Labor Department report showed U.S. employers added 204,000
jobs in October, exceeding the median estimate for a 120,000
gain in a Bloomberg survey. A reading lower than 30 or above 70
suggests the security may be poised for a change in direction.  The government is scheduled to sell 10-year notes tomorrow
and 30-year bonds on Nov. 14. The U.S. will also auction three-and six-month bills today.  The  extra yield  on 30-year bonds versus three-year notes
was little changed at 325 basis points after expanding to 328
basis points, the widest since September 2011, as investors
demanded a higher premium to hold longer-maturity debt due to
risk that growth will spur inflation.  Citigroup’s Surprise Index, which shows whether data beat
or fell short of economists’ forecasts, was at 18.9 yesterday
after rising to 19.4 on Nov. 8, the highest since Oct. 22.  Economic Reading  “Reports suggested that, unlike in  Europe , economic
recovery in the U.S. is more solid,” said Peter Osler, head of
interest-rates strategy at broker Marex Spectron Group Ltd. in
 London .  The Chicago Fed’s national  index , which draws on 85
economic indicators was 0.14 for September. It was forecast to
rise to 0.15, the highest level since February, according to the
median estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg News survey. The
August level was revised to 0.13 from 0.14.  The Bloomberg U.S. Financial Conditions Index reached a
record before  Janet Yellen  faces a confirmation hearing Nov. 14
to lead the Fed. The gauge, which combines everything from
money-market rates to yields on government and corporate bonds
to equity volatility, rose to 1.82, set for the highest closing
level in data going back to January 1994.  Fed officials will decide to pare purchases of Treasury and
mortgage-backed securities to $70 billion a month at their March
18-19 meeting, according to the median of 32 economist estimates
in a Bloomberg survey on Nov. 8. The central bank currently buys
$85 billion of debt a month and today purchased  $1.57 billion
in Treasuries maturing between February 2036 and February 2043.  Lockhart Views  “Confidence” in the economy is “key” in any cutbacks in
stimulus, Atlanta Fed’s Lockhart said in an interview with
 Bloomberg Radio . Lockhart will also speak on the economy in
 Alabama . Dallas Fed President  Richard Fisher  said in a speech in
 Melbourne  that monetary accommodation “becomes riskier by the
day.” His Minneapolis counterpart Narayana Kocherlakota is also
due to speak today.  Traders saw an 82 percent chance, from 74 percent a month
earlier, that policy makers will hold the U.S. benchmark rate
between zero to 0.25 percent by December 2014, according to Fed
funds futures data compiled by Bloomberg.  U.S. government debt  is becoming increasingly perilous to
options traders who are pushing up the cost to protect against
sudden losses by the most in a year, even as Fed stimulus
suppresses volatility. The cost to lock in fixed-interest rates
that are a half-percentage point above 10-year yields is now
about 17 percent higher than contracts tied to prevailing rates,
according to data compiled by Deutsche Bank AG.  To contact the reporter on this story:
