Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  Chief
Executive Officer  Brian T. Moynihan  said U.S. consumers are in
“pretty good shape” and spending more with credit cards.  After a lull earlier this year caused by higher tax rates
and uncertainty caused by political gridlock, spending is
rising, Moynihan said today at an investor conference sponsored
by his company in New York.  Moynihan, 54, is working to engineer a sustained rebound in
profit at the nation’s second-largest bank. He’ll have to
overcome slack demand from mortgage borrowers, a sluggish
national economy and continuing  legal claims  tied to faulty home
loans that have cost the Charlotte, North Carolina-based company
about $50 billion.  Bank of America closed at $14.40 yesterday in New York,
bringing its  gain  for this year to 24 percent and trailing the
28 percent advance in the KBW Bank Index of 24 lenders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
