Indian (SENSEX)  stock-index futures swung
between gains and losses before the release of consumer
inflation and industrial output data today.  SGX CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index futures for November delivery added 0.1
percent to 6,124 at 9:27 a.m. in  Singapore  after losing as much
as 0.3 percent. The underlying CNX Nifty Index fell 1 percent to
6,078.80 yesterday, a four-week low. The S&P BSE Sensex declined
0.9 percent to the lowest since Oct. 17. The Bank of  New York 
Mellon India ADR Index of U.S.-traded shares decreased 1.4
percent. One-month rupee forwards weakened for a fifth day.  Indian indexes slid yesterday as the rupee dropped to an
eight-week low against the dollar, threatening to accelerate
inflation.  Consumer prices  rose 9.9 percent in October from a
year earlier, compared with 9.84 percent in September, according
to the median of 28 estimates in a Bloomberg survey. Factory
output may have increased 3.5 percent in September, from 0.6
percent in August, a separate Bloomberg  survey  showed.  “The rupee is the most important factor now,” Kishor Ostwal, managing director at CNI Research Ltd., said in a phone
interview yesterday. “Inflation and factory output data will be
keenly watched.”  Copper producer  Hindalco Industries Ltd. (HNDL)  may say its
second-quarter profit rose to 3.85 billion rupees ($60.9
million) from 3.59 billion rupees a year earlier, according to
the median of 26 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Net incomes at 17 of the 21 companies in the Sensex that
have reported results exceeded analyst estimates, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. About 47 percent of the 30 companies
in the index missed forecasts in the previous quarter.  Global investors bought a net $57 million of Indian
equities on Nov. 8, a 25th day of purchases, data from the
regulator show. That took this year’s inflows to $16.6 billion,
the most after  Japan  among 10 Asian markets tracked by
Bloomberg.  The Sensex has gained 5.5 percent this year and trades at
13.5-times projected 12-month earnings, the cheapest in more
than two months. The MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index is valued at
10.4 times forecast profits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
