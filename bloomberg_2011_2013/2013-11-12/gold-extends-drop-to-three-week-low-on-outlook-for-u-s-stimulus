Gold declined for a fourth day to a
three-week low in London on speculation a strengthening U.S.
economy will spur the  Federal Reserve  to slow stimulus. Silver
reached the lowest in four weeks.  The Bloomberg U.S.  Dollar Index , a measure against 10 major
currencies, reached an eight-week high. U.S. employers added a
higher-than-expected 204,000 workers last month, Labor
Department data showed Nov. 8. Global equities are trading about
1.7 percent below a more than five-year high reached Oct. 30.  Gold is set for the first annual drop in 13 years as some
investors lost faith in the metal as a store of value and on
speculation a strengthening economy will spur the Fed to slow
debt purchases. Dallas Fed President  Richard Fisher , who said he
wouldn’t rule out backing a reduction in bond buying by March,
said in a speech in  Melbourne  today that monetary accommodation
“becomes riskier by the day.”  “The market seems concerned that the tapering of
quantitative easing may start sooner than later and that seems
to be weighing on sentiment,”  William Adams , an analyst at
Fastmarkets.com in London, wrote today in a report. “With
effervescent equity markets, a strong dollar and generally good
economic data, it seems as though precious metals are out of
favor.”  Gold for immediate delivery fell 0.2 percent to $1,280.64
an ounce by 9:55 a.m. in London. It reached $1,276.58, the
lowest level since Oct. 17. Bullion for December delivery lost
0.1 percent to $1,279.80 on the Comex in  New York . Futures
trading volume was 20 percent below average for the past 100
days for this time of day, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  ETP Holdings  Holdings in gold-backed  exchange-traded products  increased
for a fourth day yesterday, rising 0.1 metric ton to 1,876.7
tons, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Assets reached 1,874.9
tons on Nov. 5, the lowest since April 2010.  Silver for immediate delivery slid 1 percent to $21.1528 an
ounce in London, after falling to $21.068, the lowest since Oct.
15. Palladium fell 0.8 percent to $748.53 an ounce. Platinum
added 0.1 percent to $1,432.90 an ounce. It reached a three-week low of $1,425.48 yesterday.  A strike in  South Africa  over wages called by the  National
Union of Mineworkers  at Northam Platinum Ltd. that began Nov. 4
continues, Ecliff Tantsi, chief negotiator for the NUM, said by
phone.  To contact the reporters on this story:
