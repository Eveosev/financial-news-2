At least 29 people were killed and
about 30 were injured when a truck slammed into a bus late
yesterday on South Africa’s so-called “Road of Death.”  The accident occurred on the Moloto Road near Kwaggafontein
in Mpumalanga province, about 100 miles (161 kilometers)
northeast of Johannesburg, the government said in an e-mailed
statement. The bus belonged to Johannesburg-based Putco Ltd.,
the South African Press Association reported, citing company
spokesman Romeo More. More didn’t immediately respond to a voice
message and an e-mail seeking comment.  “This carnage must stop,” President Jacob Zuma said in an
e-mailed statement. “The fact that this particular road has
gained notoriety in the deaths of our people means there’s
something wrong that we need to address together.”  More than 10,000 people die each year on South Africa’s
roads. Traffic accidents cost Africa’s biggest economy 306
billion rand ($29 billion) annually, Transport Minister Dipuo Peters told Parliament in September.  Political parties called for an investigation into the
latest crash. It was the worst accident since Sept. 5, when 24
people died and 32 were injured after a truck hit four minibus
taxis and a car near Pinetown in KwaZulu-Natal province, about
340 miles southeast of Johannesburg. The truck driver is facing
murder charges.  To contact the reporter on this story:
