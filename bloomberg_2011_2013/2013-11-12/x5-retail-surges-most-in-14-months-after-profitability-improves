X5 Retail Group NV (FIVE) , the Russian
retailer controlled by billionaire  Mikhail Fridman  and his
partners, surged the most in more than a year after boosting
third-quarter profitability.  X5, Russia’s second-biggest retailer, rose as much as 7.4
percent in U.K. trading, the biggest intraday advance since
September 2012, and was up 6.9 percent at $17.45 a depositary
receipt as of 12:50 p.m. in London.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization rose 27 percent from a year earlier to $280
million, X5 said today in a statement. The Ebitda margin
expanded to 7.4 percent of sales from 6.1 percent a year
earlier.  Margins were “driven by improved conditions with
suppliers,” Anna Kochkina, an analyst at BCS Financial Group,
said by phone. “Investors who were short X5, had to buy
additional shares to cover their positions.”  The turnaround may not be sustainable, Kochkina said. X5
has to prove it can maintain profitability and stop a decline in
customer numbers in its stores, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
