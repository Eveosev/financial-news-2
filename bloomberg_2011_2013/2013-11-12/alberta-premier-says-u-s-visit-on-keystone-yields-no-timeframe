Alberta Premier Alison Redford said
she had a “robust discussion” with U.S. officials today about
the Keystone XL pipeline, though she said she got no indication
when an environmental review will be completed.  Redford spoke with reporters after a meeting with Senator
 Mary Landrieu , a Louisiana Democrat who backs the pipeline.
Landrieu said she will press the State Department to approve the
pipeline.  TransCanada Corp. (TRP)  has applied for a permit to build
the pipeline linking Canada’s oil sands with refineries on the
U.S. coast of the Gulf of Mexico.  To contact the reporter on this story:
