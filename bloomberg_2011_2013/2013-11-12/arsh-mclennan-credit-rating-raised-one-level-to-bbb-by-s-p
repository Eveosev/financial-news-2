Marsh & McLennan Cos. (MMC) , the largest
insurance broker by market value, had its credit rating lifted
one level to BBB+ by Standard & Poor’s as its performance
improves.  S&P cited “significant improvements in operating
performance, with robust growth in revenues, earnings, and
margins over the past three years, thanks in part to favorable
strategic and operational initiatives by management,” according
to a statement today about the New York-based broker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
