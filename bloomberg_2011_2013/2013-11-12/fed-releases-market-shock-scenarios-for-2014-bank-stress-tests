Six large banks, including JPMorgan
Chase & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., will need to test
their resilience against a 29.4 percent decline in U.S. stocks
and a 40.5 percent plunge in equities across Asia’s  emerging
markets , the Federal Reserve said.  The hypothetical losses are part of the “severely
adverse” scenario in  stress tests  created by the Fed to ensure
the biggest banks have sufficient capital and appropriate risk
management systems to survive financial turmoil. Released by the
Fed board today, the hypothetical conditions include extreme
volatility in foreign exchange markets, sovereign credit,
private equity portfolios and commodity markets.  The Fed on Nov. 1 outlined adverse and severely adverse
economic scenarios for the 30 biggest banks aimed at encouraging
them to build capital cushions.  In the “adverse” economic scenario, banks will be tested
against a global flight from long-term debt that pushes the U.S.
into a recession, with unemployment rising to 9.25 percent. The
yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note jumps to 5.75 percent by
the end of 2014, and corporate bond and mortgage rates also
rise.  In the Fed’s “severely adverse” scenario, the jobless
rate peaks at 11.25 percent, and U.S. housing prices slide 25
percent, while the euro area sinks into recession. Developing
economies in Asia also experience a “sharp slowdown,” the Fed
said.  Companies will have until the first week of January to
submit their capital plans, and the results will be released in
March.  To contact the reporters on this story:
