Argentina, the world’s biggest
biodiesel exporter, is increasing shipments of the fuel on
stronger U.S. demand, Oil World said.  Argentine exports of biodiesel made from soybean oil will
climb to 450,000 metric tons in the three months through
December, more than double the year-earlier 221,000 tons, the
researcher said today in an e-mailed report. The U.S. may
account for two-thirds of purchases from September through the
end of the year, it said. Argentina’s biodiesel production this
quarter may jump 57 percent from a year earlier to 670,000 tons.  “The U.S.A. has become the leading export destination for
Argentine biodiesel,” Hamburg-based Oil World said. “A large
part of the U.S. biodiesel imports is destined for re-export to
African and Asian countries.”  U.S. biodiesel output rose to a record 128.3 million
gallons in August, according to the most recent monthly data
from the Department of Energy. Inventories of soybean oil used
to make the biofuel fell to an eight-year low of 773,000 tons at
the end of the 2012-13 season on Sept. 30, and supplies may
slide further to 741,000 tons by the close of 2013-14, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture estimates.  Argentina’s annual biodiesel exports still will decline in
2013 to 1.224 million tons from 1.558 million tons a year
earlier, Oil World said. Shipments to the European Union tumbled
as the 28-country bloc made plans to institute anti-dumping
tariffs on both Argentine and Indonesian biodiesel, the
researcher said last month.  Argentina’s government may raise its  mandate  for domestic
biodiesel usage, with the Ministry of Industry calling for a 10
percent blend level in fuel by the end of the year, according to
Oil World.  In  Indonesia , biodiesel exports dropped 22 percent from a
year earlier to 118,000 tons in August, Oil World said.
Shipments in 2013’s first eight months were still a record 1.04
million tons, 12 percent more than the prior season, according
to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
