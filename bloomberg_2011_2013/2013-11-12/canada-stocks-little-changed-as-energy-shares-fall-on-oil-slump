Canadian  stocks  fell a second day as
raw-material and energy producers slumped after copper dropped
and crude prices tumbled to a five-month low.  BlackPearl Resources Inc. and  Legacy Oil & Gas Inc. (LEG)  lost at
least 1 percent as the price of crude declined for the first
time in three days on rising U.S. inventory forecasts. Air
 Canada , the best-performing Canadian stock this year, climbed
4.6 percent for a fourth day of gains. Teck Resources Ltd. and
Lundin Mining Corp. dropped more than 2.6 percent as copper
prices slid.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  fell 32.35
points, or 0.2 percent, to 13,326.04 at 4 p.m. in Toronto. The
benchmark Canadian equity gauge has advanced 7.2 percent this
year, the third-worst performance among global developed
markets, ahead of  Hong Kong  and Singapore.  “People are staying away from taking drastic positions
before the year-end,” said Brian Huen, managing partner with
Red Sky Capital Management Ltd. in Toronto. The firm manages
about C$220 million. “There’s a lot of different views
developing on what tapering will look like from the Fed, so more
people are talking about tapering in December. A lot of people
are clearly watching for that.”  Global equities have rallied this year as the U.S. Federal
Reserve refrained from curbing its $85 billion in monthly asset
purchases. Economists forecast the central bank will delay
tapering its asset purchases until March.  Bonterra Energy Corp. (BNE)  lost 3.6 percent to C$54.95, the most
since April, after the company reported third-quarter production
declined 6.6 percent compared with the previous quarter.  BlackPearl Resources lost 1 percent to C$1.91 and Legacy
Oil & Gas retreated 3.4 percent to C$6.53 as crude for December
delivery declined 2.2 percent to $93.04 in New York, the lowest
since May 31.  Bombardier Inc., the world’s third-largest planemaker,
dropped 2.4 percent to C$4.53 for a second day of losses. The
stock sank 10 percent on Oct. 31 for the biggest decline in more
than four years after posting a quarterly profit that missed
analysts’ estimates.  Wi-Lan  Wi-Lan Inc. (WIN)  rose 3 percent to C$3.44 and CGI Group Inc.
added 2.7 percent to C$37.11 as technology stocks added 1.1
percent as a group in the S&P/TSX.  Six of 10  industries  advanced in the benchmark Canadian
equity gauge on trading volume in line with the 30-day average.  National Bank of Canada  added 1.1 percent to C$92.52, a
record high, to pace gains among Canada’s largest lenders.  Air Canada, the nation’s largest airline, increased 4.6
percent to C$6.90, extending a five-year high. The stock has
surged 27 percent in the past four days. The carrier reported
third-quarter profit on Nov. 8 that beat analysts’ estimates
amid progress in its cost-cutting plan.  Air Canada is the  top-performing  stock in the S&P/TSX this
year with a 294 percent gain.  Teck Resources, the nation’s largest diversified miner,
dropped 2.6 percent to C$27.34 and Lundin Mining retreated 2.8
percent to C$4.58 as copper fell in  New York . Output in  China ,
the world’s largest user of the metal, increased 23 percent in
October to a monthly record.  To contact the reporter on this story:
