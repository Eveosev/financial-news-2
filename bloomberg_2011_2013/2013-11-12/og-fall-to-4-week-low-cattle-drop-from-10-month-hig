Hog futures fell to a four-week low
as lower costs for livestock feed boosted animal weights,
increasing prospects for pork supplies. Cattle dropped from the
highest in almost 10 months.  The average hog  carcass  weighed 212 pounds (96 kilograms)
on Nov. 7, up 2.2 percent from a year earlier, government data
showed. The price of corn, the main ingredient in feed, has
tumbled 38 percent this year on forecasts that the U.S. crop
will increase to a record.  “The biggest thing now is the carcass weights and how
we’ve seen those ratchet higher,” Ryan Turner, a risk-management consultant at FCStone Group Inc. in Kansas City,
Missouri, said in a telephone interview. The outlook for more
supplies “is a function of the new-crop corn in terms of
quality and price,” he said.  Hog futures for December settlement fell 1 percent to close
at 87.2 cents a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. The price touched 87.05 cents, the lowest for a most-active contract since Oct. 15.  Cattle futures for December delivery dropped 0.1 percent to
$1.34275 a pound. Earlier, the price reached $1.3475, the
highest since Jan. 15, on concern that U.S. beef supplies may
ebb.  Wholesale  beef  dropped for the fifth straight session, the
longest slump since July.  Feeder-cattle futures for January settlement rose less than
0.1 percent to $1.642.  To contact the reporter on this story:
