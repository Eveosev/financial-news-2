The Miami Dolphins and owner Stephen Ross postponed a meeting with Jonathan Martin at the request of
the National Football League, which is investigating the
lineman’s allegations of being harassed by teammates.  Ross had said he planned to meet today with Martin, who
left the team on Oct. 28, to “see how he’s doing and listen to
his concerns.”  Dolphins President Tom Garfinkel said yesterday that the
NFL and Ted Wells, a  New York  attorney overseeing an independent
probe into the harassment allegations, asked that the team’s
meeting with Martin be delayed until investigators meet with him
first.  “Out of deference to the process, we will cooperate with
their request,” Garfinkel said in a statement. “We look
forward to meeting with Jonathan directly as soon as possible.”  The Dolphins indefinitely suspended offensive lineman
Richie Incognito on Nov. 4 for conduct detrimental to the team
after an expletive-filled voice message he sent to Martin became
public. The Dolphins also asked the NFL to investigate.  Martin endured harassment “far beyond the traditional
locker room hazing” for the entire 1 1/2 seasons he spent with
the Dolphins and was physically assaulted by a teammate, his
lawyer, David Cornwell of Gordon and Rees LLP in Atlanta, said
on Nov. 6. The NFL the same day said Wells, who was involved in
investigations of the National Basketball Players Association
and the Syracuse University men’s basketball team, would oversee
the probe of the Dolphins.  To contact the reporter on this story:
