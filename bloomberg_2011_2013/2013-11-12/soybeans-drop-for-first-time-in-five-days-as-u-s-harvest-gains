Soybeans declined for the first time
in five days as harvesting in the U.S. approached completion
amid favorable weather conditions.  The contract for delivery in January dropped as much as 0.4
percent to $12.955 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, and
was at $12.99 by 11:40 a.m. in  Singapore . Futures gained 4.1
percent in the four days through yesterday.  Production will total 3.258 billion bushels this year, the
third-biggest ever, according to the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture . Dry weather this week will favor late corn and
soybean harvesting, MDA Information Systems LLC said yesterday.
The harvests are nearing completion, with 73 percent of corn and
86 percent of  soybeans  collected, USDA data show. The agency
will update its crop-progress report today.  “Seasonal harvest pressure is weighing on soybean
prices,” said Vanessa Tan, an analyst at Phillip Futures Pte in
Singapore. “With global corn inventories exceeding
expectations, we believe that abundant supplies will put a cap
on corn prices as well.”  Global inventories before the start of the Northern
Hemisphere harvests in 2014 will be 164.33 million tons,
compared with 151.42 million tons projected in September, the
USDA said Nov. 8.  Corn for delivery in December rose 0.4 percent to $4.365 a
bushel. Wheat for delivery in December gained 0.2 percent to
$6.475 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
