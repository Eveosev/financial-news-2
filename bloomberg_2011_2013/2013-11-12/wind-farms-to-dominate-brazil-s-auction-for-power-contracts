Wind-farm developers in  Brazil 
comprise 88 percent of the power projects enrolled in a Nov. 18
auction for contracts to sell electricity.  Solar farms represent 8 percent of the 10,460 megawatts of
registered projects, energy research agency Empresa de Pesquisa
Energetica said today on its  website . The remaining projects are
small hydroelectric dams and biomass plants.  Developers awarded contracts in the so-called A-3 auction
will have to start producing electricity in 2016, according to
EPE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
