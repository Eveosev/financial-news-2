Sarepta Therapeutics Inc. (SRPT)  plummeted
the most in 16 years after U.S. regulators questioned trial
results for the drugmaker’s experimental treatment for Duchenne
muscular dystrophy and indicated more data may be needed.  Sarepta, which has no products on the market, fell 64
percent to $13.16 at the close in New York in its biggest one-day drop since the shares began trading in June 1997. The stock
had gained 42 percent this year through yesterday.  The Food and Drug Administration called an application to
sell eteplirsen “premature,” Cambridge, Massachusetts-based
Sarepta said in a statement today, citing a meeting with the
agency last week. The FDA said new data and the failure of a
similar medicine in a clinical trial raise “considerable
doubt” about the design of Sarepta’s research, according to the
company.  “We are very disappointed with the FDA’s decision,” Chris Garabedian, Sarepta’s chief executive officer, said in the
statement. “We strongly believe in the potential of eteplirsen
to address a serious unmet medical need in DMD and we are
committed to its development.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
