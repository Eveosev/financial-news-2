Sacyr SA (SCYR) , a Spanish builder, and its
partners won a 41 million-euro ($55 million) contract to
increase water supplies in Cerro de Pasco, a central Peruvian
city suffering from shortages and wastewater discharge problems.  The Pasco municipal project includes construction of a new
wastewater-treatment plant, modernizing the sewer system,
upgrading water-catchment sources and expanding the city’s
drinking-water plant, the Madrid-based company said. Sacyr’s
current works in Peru include building two hydroelectric plants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
