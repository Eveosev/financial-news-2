Aberdeen Asset Management Plc dumped
its holdings of South Korean won as the nation’s central bank
said last month it may intervene to stem the currency’s gains.  Aberdeen says it sold the won, the best-performing
developing-nation currency since June, at 1,061 per dollar. La
Francaise Asset Management, which oversees about $51 billion,
cut half its Korean bond holdings on Oct. 30 as officials said
they may act to counter the “herd behavior” of speculators.  “I’ve taken profits given how much the Bank of  Korea  is
stepping in now,”  Edwin Gutierrez , a London-based  fund manager 
at Aberdeen, which manages $10 billion of emerging-market debt,
said in a Nov. 4 interview via e-mail. “I just learned not to
be too greedy this year. I’m looking for better levels to re-enter.”  Speculation that  South Korea  has now moved beyond rhetoric
and is selling the won echoes moves of policy makers from the
 Czech Republic  to  New Zealand . That’s sparking concern about a
re-run of 2010’s currency wars, when nations devalued to boost
exports. The won’s gains are already hurting  Asia ’s fourth-biggest economy, which last month lowered its 2014 growth
forecast to 3.8 percent, from 4 percent in July.  Biggest Gain  The won climbed 6.4 percent against the dollar since June
28, the most among 24 emerging-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg. It has been slipping since South Korea started
warning about the effects of its strength on the economy, and
was at 1,071.45 per dollar in  Seoul  today, from 1,054.35 on Oct.
24, the strongest since August 2011.  Officials have used the term “herd behavior” to warn off
speculators eight times since Sept. 24, the most since the last
two months of 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Finance Minister Hyun Oh Seok told lawmakers Nov. 1 that
authorities would act to counter the won’s strength, while  Bank
of Korea  Governor Kim Choong Soo said at the same hearing that
action should be taken to curb the currency’s volatility.  Central bank officials in Seoul declined to comment on
whether they’ve already intervened to sell won and buy dollars.  “I am not calling for a big weakening of the won,” said
Gutierrez. “I still love the medium-term story” of South
Korea’s fundamentals, he said. “It’s a case of them wanting to
slow the rate of appreciation.”  Current Account  Policy makers are fighting inflows from investors keen to
take advantage of the stability created by a record current-account surplus and the fastest economic growth in two years.  South Korea’s foreign-currency  reserves  jumped by $6.3
billion in October, the most in two years, to a record $343.2
billion, according to official data. The increase suggests the
central bank has been intervening “a lot,” Isabelle Mateos y Lago, the International Monetary Fund’s Korea mission chief,
said in a Nov. 1 interview in Seoul.  Won trading  on the local  spot market  reached the equivalent
of $9.6 billion on Oct. 24, the day the currency peaked,
compared with an average for this year of $8.5 billion,
according to data from Seoul Money Brokerage Services Ltd.  The extra activity reflects a “suspected amount of dollar
buying” by the central bank, said Kim Doo Hyeon, the chief
currency dealer at Korea Exchange Bank in Seoul.  ‘More Vocal’  “We love the Korean currency,” Marine Marciano, who
manages emerging-market assets at La Francaise in Paris, said by
phone on Oct. 30, the day she sold half of her won-denominated
holdings. “But the central bank is becoming more vocal.”  Central banks around the world are intervening in foreign-exchange markets or cutting rates, which also tends to weaken a
currency, to boost competitiveness. The IMF last month reduced
its forecasts for global economic growth to 2.9 percent in 2013
and 3.6 percent in 2014, from July’s projected rates of 3.1
percent and 3.8 percent.  New Zealand has said it may delay interest-rate increases
to depreciate its dollar, while Czech policy makers intervened
to weaken the koruna for the first time in 11 years last week.
Brazil Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  called such devaluations a
“currency war” in 2010.  The  New Zealand dollar  has tumbled almost 4 percent to
82.15 U.S. cents since reaching a five-month high of 85.44 on
Oct. 22, paring its advance in the second half of this year to
6.2 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The Czech koruna
fell 4.4 percent against the euro, the most ever, after the
central bank sold the currency on Nov. 7.  U.S. Warning  The U.S. Treasury Department said in an Oct. 30 report it
will urge South Korea to limit foreign-exchange intervention
“to the exceptional circumstances of disorderly market
conditions and to commit to transparency with respect to
foreign-exchange intervention.” South Korea is a member of the
Group of 20 developed nations, which the previous month pledged
to “refrain from competitive devaluation.”  A stronger currency makes exports less competitive. Seoul-based  LG Electronics Inc. (066570) , the third-largest smartphone maker,
posted a 46 percent decline in net income for the third quarter.
IBK Securities Co. said last month that the won’s gains may make
it difficult for the manufacturer’s earnings to recover.  Global funds poured a record $7.14 billion into Korean
stocks in September and $4.73 billion in October, exchange data
show. They’re attracted by South Korea’s current-account
surplus, which the central bank estimates will reach an all-time
high of $63 billion this year.  Gross domestic product  grew 3.3
percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, the fastest
since the final three months of 2011.  Citigroup Inc., the world’s second-biggest currency trader,
predicts these inflows will help boost the won to 1,050 per
dollar by year-end and 1,010 by the end of 2014. That compares
with median estimates in a Bloomberg survey of about 20 analysts
of 1,069 and 1,065.  “The won remains under appreciation pressure thanks to
robust economic fundamentals,” said Chang Jaechul, a Seoul-based economist at Citigroup. “The won is still attractive.
Intervention will be limited to slowing the pace of gains.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
