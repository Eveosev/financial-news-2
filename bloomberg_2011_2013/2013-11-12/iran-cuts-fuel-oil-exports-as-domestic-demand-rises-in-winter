Iran reduced  fuel oil  exports by
two-thirds to meet rising demand from domestic power plants in
the winter, according to an official at National Iranian Oil Co.  The country has been exporting about 200,000 metric tons a
month of 280-centistoke and 380-centistoke grades since October
and the volume is unlikely to increase until the end of January,
said the official, who asked not to be identified because of
company rules. Thatâ€™s down from 600,000 tons a month of overseas
sales earlier this year.  Iran is still shipping fuel oil abroad to meet its
obligations under international contracts, and most exports are
delivered within the  Persian Gulf , said the official.  To contact the reporter on this story:
