The  Houston Texans  released safety
Ed Reed, ending the five-time All-Pro’s tenure with the team
after playing seven games, and placed Pro Bowl running back
 Arian Foster  on season-ending injured reserve.  The 35-year-old Reed, who signed a three-year, $15 million
contract with the Texans in March, totaled just 14 tackles this
year. He missed the first two games of the National Football
League season while recovering from offseason hip surgery and
recently lost his starting job.  Reed’s release yesterday came two days after he said the
Texans were “outplayed” and “outcoached” in a 27-24 loss to
the Arizona Cardinals, the Houston Chronicle said. It was the
Texans’ seventh straight loss since a 2-0 start.  Reed had been demoted by Houston interim coach  Wade Phillips , who took over when  Gary Kubiak  suffered a mini-stroke,
and was in the game for just 12 plays against Arizona. He took
part in 32 plays the previous week.  Reed played his first 11 seasons with the Baltimore Ravens,
nine times earning invitations to the Pro Bowl and helping the
Ravens win last season’s Super Bowl.  The 27-year-old Foster, a Pro Bowl selection the past three
years, is scheduled to undergo back surgery. Foster rushed for
542 yards and one touchdown in eight games for the Texans this
season. He had rushed for at least 1,200 yards and 10 scores
each of the previous three seasons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
