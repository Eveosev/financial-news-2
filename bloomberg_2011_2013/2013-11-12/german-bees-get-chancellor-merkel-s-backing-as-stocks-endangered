German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s
bloc and the Social Democrats agreed to raise efforts to protect
the country’s bees as domestic stocks dwindle.  Bee colonies, which are “invaluable” for  Germany ’s
agriculture and ecosystem, are endangered, Deputy Environment
Minister Katherina Reiche and the Social Democrats’ Ute Vogt
said in a joint e-mailed statement. “We want to protect them.”  Bees help produce apples, tomatoes, nuts and other fruits
and seeds by pollinating, creating billions of euros in economic
value each year. Germany has seen higher-than-average bee deaths
during recent winters when the insects hibernate, according to
the German Beekeepers’ Association.  “We need joint efforts from the federal government and the
states,” Reiche and Vogt said in the statement. Parties have
agreed to continue funding research programs monitoring bee
stocks, they said.  Without insect pollination, about a third of the crops
humans eat would have to be pollinated by other means to
maintain yield, according to environmental group Greenpeace.  “In some specific regions of North America, East Asia and
Europe, the value of pollination can be as high as $1,500 per
hectare, money that farmers -- and society at large -- will be
losing if pollinators were to decline in those regions,”
Greenpeace said in its “Bees in Decline” study in April.  Merkel’s bloc and the Social Democrats are midway through
talks to form a coalition government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
