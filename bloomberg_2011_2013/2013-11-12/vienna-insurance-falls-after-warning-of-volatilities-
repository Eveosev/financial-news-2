Vienna Insurance Group AG (VIG) , Austria’s
biggest insurer, fell the most in more than three weeks after
saying its earnings will be marked by “volatilities” in 2013.  Vienna Insurance, which is located in the Austrian capital,
decreased as much as 2.3 percent, the largest intraday drop
since Oct. 21. The shares traded 2 percent lower at 38.02 euros
as of 9:26 a.m. local time, extending its decline this year to
5.8 percent.  The company faces “difficult” conditions in  Romania  and
an “adverse situation” at its Donau Versicherung unit’s motor
insurance business in  Italy , according to a statement it
published after the market closed yesterday. Vienna Insurance,
which is scheduled to report third-quarter earnings on Nov. 28,
didn’t supply a target for profit this year in its statement.  Vienna Insurance will probably report net income of 378
million euros ($506 million) this year, according to the average
of two  analyst estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. That would be a
6.9 percent decline from the 406.2 million euros it made  last
year .  Separately, Vienna Insurance agreed to buy Polish life
insurer Skandia  Poland , the Austrian company said in a statement
today. The firm didn’t disclose the purchase price for Skandia,
which wrote about 45 million euros of premiums in the first half
of the year, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
