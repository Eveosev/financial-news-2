China is expected to build more
renewable power plants through 2035 than the U.S., European
Union and  Japan  combined, according to the  International Energy
Agency .  The share of energy sources including hydropower, biomass,
wind and solar in world electricity supply will rise above 30
percent in that period, “drawing ahead of natural gas in the
next few years and all but reaching coal as the leading fuel for
power generation in 2035,” the Paris-based adviser to 28
nations said in its annual World Energy Outlook report
yesterday.  Wind and solar photovoltaic technology will boost renewable
output by 45 percent, helping it account for almost half of the
increase in global power generation through 2035, the IEA said.  Energy-related emissions will rise 20 percent in the
period, meaning global temperatures probably will advance more
than 3.6 degrees Celsius (6.5 Fahrenheit) in the long term,
above the maximum of 2 degrees internationally agreed as the
safe limit, it said.  “As the source of two-thirds of global greenhouse gas
emissions, the energy sector will be pivotal in determining
whether or not climate change goals are achieved,” it said.  New initiatives to curb greenhouse gas output in the U.S.,
 China ,  Europe  and Japan may help limit growth in energy-related
emissions, the agency said.  “The right combination of policies and technologies is
proving that the links between economic growth, energy demand
and energy-related carbon dioxide emissions can be weakened,”
the IEA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
