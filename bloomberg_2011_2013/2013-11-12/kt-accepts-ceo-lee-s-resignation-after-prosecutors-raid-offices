KT Corp. (030200) ,  South Korea ’s second-largest wireless carrier, accepted the resignation of Chief
Executive Officer Lee Suk Chae after prosecutors raided his home
and the company’s headquarters.  “Considering the ongoing investigations and the need to
solve the piles of pending issues, the board has decided to
accept his resignation offer,” KT said in an e-mailed statement
today. The board will meet next week to begin the search for a
successor to Lee, who offered to quit Nov. 3.  Prosecutors conducted the raids during the past month as
they investigate allegations KT incurred losses on asset sales
and bad investments.  People’s Solidarity for Participatory
Democracy , a South Korean civic group, filed a lawsuit against
Lee in February, alleging he caused about 80 billion won ($75
million) of losses to the company by selling property too
cheaply.  Lee also resigned as chairman of KT.  “Seeing executives and staff members suffering, I could no
longer delay the resignation,” Lee said in an e-mail to
employees Nov. 3. “I am also open to disclose all my salary and
stock bonuses, if the company can be freed from the recent
allegations and speculations.”  The board is seeking an early conclusion to the
investigation so it can focus on its global business expansion,
the company said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
