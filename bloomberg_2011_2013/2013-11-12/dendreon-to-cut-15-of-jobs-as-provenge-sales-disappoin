Dendreon Corp. (DNDN)  plans to cut 150
jobs, or about 15 percent of its workforce, to trim operating
expenses after sales of its prostate-cancer drug Provenge missed
analysts’ estimates.  Dendreon will take a $7.5 million charge related to
severance this quarter and next, the Seattle-based company said
in a regulatory filing today. The reductions will help save
about $125 million in operating expenses, with cost of goods
sold being reduced by about $30 million.  The drugmaker is cutting costs as sales of Provenge,
approved in 2010, fail to meet expectations. The drug,
Dendreon’s only marketed product, generated third-quarter
revenue of $68 million, the company reported today, missing the
$75 million average estimate of analysts. That’s a 13 percent
decline from a year earlier. Dendreon said in early August that
the medicine’s revenue wouldn’t increase this year as forecast.  “Despite the restructuring to save cash and runway, we
believe the negative sales trajectory will put pressure on the
stock today,” ISI Group analyst  Mark Schoenebaum  wrote in a
note to clients today.  Dendreon said in July 2012 that it would cut more than 600
jobs and reduce costs by $150 million as it sought to reach
profitability.  In October,  Bloomberg News  reported Dendreon is working
with  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  to find a buyer. The company declined
to comment at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
