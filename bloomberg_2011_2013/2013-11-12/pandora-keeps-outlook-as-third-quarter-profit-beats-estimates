Pandora A/S (PNDORA) , the Danish maker of
charm bracelets, reiterated its full-year forecasts after
posting higher third-quarter profit than analysts estimated.  Net income for the three months ended Sept. 30 rose to 612
million kroner from 380 million kroner a year earlier, the
Glostrup, Denmark-based company said in a statement today. The
average analyst  estimate  compiled by Bloomberg was for profit of
576 million kroner.  “The overall growth continues to be driven by an
increasing demand for Pandora’s products launched in the last 12
months,” Chief Executive Officer Allan Leighton said in the
statement, adding that store openings added to the growth.  Pandora, which last month raised its full-year forecasts,
has seen its shares more than double this year as more frequent
product introductions boost earnings. The jeweler now comes out
with new collections seven times a year instead of twice
previously. For Christmas, its offering includes a candy-cane
charm priced at 30 pounds ($48) in the U.K.  The Danish company reiterated today that it anticipates
2013 revenue of about 8.6 billion kroner ($1.5 billion) and a
margin on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization of about 30 percent. The jeweler also repeated it
expects to open about 195 Pandora-branded stores this year.  Third-quarter revenue was 2.3 billion kroner, up 26 percent
from a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
