Japanese  shares  gained, with the
 Topix (TPX)  index rising for a second day, as the yen held declines
against the dollar.  The Topix climbed 0.1 percent to 1,186.41 as of 9:01 a.m.
in Tokyo, with 19 of the 33 industry groups advancing. The
Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 0.2 percent to 14,295.99. The yen
traded at 99.18 per dollar after declining yesterday to 99.16,
the weakest closing level since Sept. 20.  “As well as the yen holding within the 99 per dollar
range, U.S. shares gained yesterday, indicating that overseas
the environment isn’t bad,” said  Toshihiko Matsuno , a
strategist at Tokyo-based SMBC Friend Securities Co. “Aside
from the megabanks, most major companies have reported earnings,
so we’re lacking in catalysts today.”  More than 700 Topix companies published earnings this month
through yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. and Mizuho Financial Group
Inc. are scheduled to report on Nov. 14.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed. U.S stocks rose yesterday, with the Dow Jones
Industrial Average extending a record, as investors awaited
retailer earnings reports to gauge the strength of consumer
demand and the likelihood of cuts to monetary stimulus.  To contact the reporters on this story:
