First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , the largest
builder of U.S. solar farms, agreed to sell electricity from a
40-megawatt plant in  Southern California  to four area cities.  Pasadena, Riverside, Colton and Azusa, California, signed
20-year contracts for power from the Kingbird project in Kern
County, First Solar said in a statement today.  First Solar, based in Tempe, Arizona, may begin
construction in 2014 and the project is expected to be complete
the following year. Terms werenâ€™t disclosed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
