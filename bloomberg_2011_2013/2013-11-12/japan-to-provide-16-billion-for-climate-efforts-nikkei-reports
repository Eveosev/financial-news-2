Japan ’s private and public sectors
plan to provide $16 billion by 2015 to help developing nations
tackle climate change, the Nikkei newspaper said today.  Japan’s contribution would equal more than 40 percent of
$35 billion in aid pledges expected from developed countries at
United Nations climate talks that began this week in  Poland , the
paper reported, without saying where it got the information.  The measure is part of a strategy on global warming to be
approved by Japan’s government on Nov. 15 and to be announced by
environment minister Nobuteru Ishihara at the UN talks,
according to the report.  Japan also plans to launch a satellite in 2017 to monitor
greenhouse gas emissions in Asia, Nikkei said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
