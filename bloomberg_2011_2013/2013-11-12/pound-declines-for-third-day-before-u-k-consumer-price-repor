The pound fell to a two-month low
against the dollar after a government report showed U.K.
inflation slowed more in October than economists forecast,
damping bets the central bank will raise interest rates.  Sterling weakened for a third day versus the euro before
the Bank of England led by Governor Mark Carney publishes new
economic forecasts in its quarterly Inflation Report tomorrow.
Policy makers have pledged to keep interest rates at a record
low as long as inflation expectations remain anchored to their 2
percent goal. Short-sterling futures contracts advanced, a sign
investors were paring bets on higher interbank borrowing costs.
U.K. government bonds rose.  “Interest-rate expectations are going to be pared back
after the inflation data,” said David Bloom, global head of
currency strategy at HSBC Holdings Plc in  London . “This has put
sterling on the back foot. Mr. Carney must be smiling. He hasn’t
had anything going his way for a long time.”  The pound dropped 0.3 percent to $1.5943 at 4:19 p.m.
London time after falling to $1.5855, the lowest level since
Sept. 13. Sterling slipped 0.7 percent to 84.39 pence per euro,
extending its three-day decline to 1.2 percent.  The U.K. currency will weaken toward $1.55 by year-end,
HSBC’s Bloom said. Sterling will end 2013 at $1.59, according to
the median estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg News survey.  ‘Technically Significant’  “The price action is technically significant,” Brown
Brothers Harriman & Co. analysts led by global head of currency
strategy Marc Chandler in New York, wrote in a note to clients.  The pound may decline toward its 200-day moving average at
$1.5496, after falling below the mid-October low of $1.5894, the
strategists said.  Annual  consumer-price inflation  slowed to 2.2 percent in
October from 2.7 percent in the previous month, the Office for
National Statistics said in London. That’s less than the 2.5
percent pace predicted by economists in a Bloomberg survey. A
separate report from the Royal Institution of Chartered
Surveyors showed a gauge of house prices climbed to the highest
since June 2002.  The implied yield on the short sterling contract expiring
in December 2014 fell four basis points, or 0.04 percentage
point, to 0.78 percent.  The Bank of England left its asset-purchase  target  at 375
billion pounds on Nov. 7, as predicted by all 46 analysts in a
Bloomberg survey. Officials kept the benchmark  interest rate  at
0.5 percent. The central bank has said it will keep borrowing
costs at a record low until  unemployment , currently at 7.7
percent, falls below 7 percent.  Recovery Strengthens  In the August Inflation Report, officials said unemployment
was unlikely to decline to the 7 percent threshold until late
2016. Since then, the recovery has strengthened with services,
construction and industrial production data all beating
economists’ forecasts.  The pound has strengthened 3.5 percent in the past three
months, the best performer of 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro
gained 1.3 percent and the dollar rose 0.2 percent.  The yield on the 10-year gilt fell one basis point to 2.80
percent after rising to 2.83 percent, the highest level since
Oct. 16. The 2.25 percent bond due September 2023 climbed 0.055,
or 55 pence per 1,000-pound face amount, to 95.315.  The extra yield investors demand to hold 10-year gilts
instead of similar-maturity German bunds narrowed four basis
points to 1.01 percentage points after expanding to 1.05
percentage points yesterday, the widest since 2005, according to
closing-price data compiled by Bloomberg.  The U.K. plans to sell 3.75 billion pounds of 2.25 percent
bonds due in September 2023 on Nov. 19 and 4.75 billion pounds
of 1.75 percent securities maturing in July 2019 on Nov. 21, the
Debt Management Office said today.  Gilts handed investors a loss of 3.5 percent this year
through yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes.
German bonds dropped 1.4 percent and U.S. Treasuries declined
2.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
