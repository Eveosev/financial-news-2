Gold held losses near a three-week
low as investors assessed the strength of the  U.S. economy  and
when the  Federal Reserve  will begin to reduce stimulus.  Bullion for immediate delivery was at $1,281.81 an ounce at
9:15 a.m. in Singapore from $1,282.80 yesterday, when the metal
fell for a third day to $1,279.16, the lowest since Oct. 17.  Gold lost 23 percent in 2013 as prospects for a recovery
damped demand for  haven assets  while inflation remained low. A
report today may show confidence among U.S. small businesses
fell in October to match the lowest level since April, after
data last week showed U.S. employers added more workers than
forecast. Fed Bank of Minneapolis President  Narayana
Kocherlakota  and Atlanta peer  Dennis Lockhart  speak today.  “Gold remains data-sensitive with quantitative easing in
the U.S. giving the main impulses,” Florian Richardt, manager
of sales and marketing at Heraeus Metals Germany GmbH & Co.,
wrote in a note. Quantitative easing refers to the Fed’s $85
billion a month bond-buying program.  Gold for delivery in December was at $1,281.30 an ounce on
the Comex from $1,281.10 yesterday, when prices reached
$1,278.10, the lowest since Oct. 17. Trading volume was 69
percent below the average for the past 100 days at this time.  Spot silver lost 0.2 percent to $21.382 an ounce, dropping
for a fourth day. Prices declined to $21.2503 yesterday, the
lowest level since Oct. 17.  Platinum was little changed at $1,432.58 an ounce after
reaching $1,425.48 yesterday, also the lowest since Oct. 17.
Palladium decreased 0.2 percent to $752.90 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
