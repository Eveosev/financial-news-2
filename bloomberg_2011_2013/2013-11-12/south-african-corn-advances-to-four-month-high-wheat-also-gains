Corn futures in  South Africa 
advanced to the highest level in more than four months in
Johannesburg. Wheat gained.  Yellow corn for delivery in December, the most active
contract, rose 1.3 percent to 2,394 rand ($230) a metric ton by
the midday close on the South African Futures Exchange. White
corn for delivery in the same month gained 0.5 percent to 2,467
rand a ton. For both contracts the closing price was the highest
since June 20.  South Africa is the continent’s biggest corn producer. A
meal made from white corn is a staple food in the nation and the
yellow variety is mostly fed to animals.  Wheat for December delivery gained 0.1 percent to 3,598
rand a ton, rising for a fourth session to the highest closing
price for the contract since December.  The nation, a net importer of wheat, is the sub-Saharan
region’s largest producer of the grain after  Ethiopia  and the
area’s biggest buyer after Nigeria and  Sudan , according to U.S.
Department of Agriculture data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
