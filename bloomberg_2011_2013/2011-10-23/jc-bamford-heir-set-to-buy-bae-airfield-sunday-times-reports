An airfield near Manchester will be
turned into a racecourse and film studio if  BAE Systems Plc (BA/) 
sells the property to the heir of JC Bamford Excavators Ltd.,
the Sunday Times reported, without saying where it got the
information.  Jo Bamford, 33, grandson of Joseph Bamford, who founded the
heavy machinery group, is in exclusive talks with BAE for the
site at Woodford which was put up for sale after the government
scrapped the Nimrod spy plane project, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
