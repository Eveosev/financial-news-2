Japan and  France  signed a treaty
calling for more information-sharing on security and terrorism,
Prime Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  said today after meeting his
counterpart  Francois Fillon  in  Tokyo .  Separately, the two countries will work together to improve
the safety of atomic power following the meltdowns at the
Fukushima Dai-Ichi power plant, the leaders said in a joint
statement. Japan and France will form a committee to promote
collaboration on nuclear energy security, the statement said.  The meeting between Noda and Fillon took place ahead of a
Group of 20 meeting hosted by French President Nicholas Sarkozy
in Cannes next week, which Noda is scheduled to attend.  After Fillon, German president  Christian Wulff  will visit
Noda tomorrow and British Prime Minister  David Cameron  on
Tuesday.
