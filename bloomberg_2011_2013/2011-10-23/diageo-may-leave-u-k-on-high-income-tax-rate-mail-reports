Diageo Plc (DGE)  may move its head office
overseas if the government doesnâ€™t abolish the 50 percent income
 tax rate , the Mail on Sunday reported, citing Chief Executive
Officer  Paul Walsh .  Having the tax rate for those earnings more than 150,000
pounds ($237,330) a year will not help the U.K. create jobs,
while scrapping it would bring more money to the country, he
told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
