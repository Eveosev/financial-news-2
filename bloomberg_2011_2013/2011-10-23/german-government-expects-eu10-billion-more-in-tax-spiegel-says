The German government expects to
collect about 10 billion euros ($14 billion) more in taxes this
year than it had estimated in the spring,  Spiegel  said, citing
unidentified people from the finance ministry.  Finance minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  has already planned an
extra 2 billion euros in his budget for next year and extra tax
income may even beat that by several hundred million euros, the
German magazine said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
