The European Union threatened
further sanctions against  Syria  in an effort to end a crackdown
against opponents of President Bashar al-Assad.  EU leaders “expressed our grave concern over the
continuing brutality against the civilian population in Syria,”
EU President  Herman Van Rompuy  said today in Brussels after a
meeting of EU heads of state and government. “If this
repression does not come to an end, the European Union will
impose further restrictive measures against the regime.” He
didn’t elaborate.  “President Assad must step aside to allow a political
transition to take place in Syria,” the leaders said in the
written conclusions of today’s meeting. “The EU will impose
further and more comprehensive measures against the regime as
long as the repression of the civilian population continues.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
