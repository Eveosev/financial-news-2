A Brazilian lawmaker who is
sponsoring a bill to overhaul civil aviation rules said he
plans to put an end to limits on foreign capital holdings in
domestic airlines,  O Estado de S.Paulo  reported today, citing an
interview with the congressman.  The proposal will ensure that the management of the company
will remain in the hands of domestic investors, lawmaker Bruno
Araujo told the Sao Paulo-based newspaper. Foreigners currently
cannot own more than 20 percent of Brazilian airlines, Estado
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
