Olympus Corp. (7733)  Chairman Tsuyoshi Kikukawa, under fire from shareholders for $687 million in
payments to advisers, canceled an appointment to speak at a
forum on social responsibility this week in Tokyo, according to
the event organizer.  The Nikkei Global Management Forum has removed Kikukawa
from the list of participants at its Oct. 25 session on “Global
Social Responsibility From  Japan  to the World,” according to
the event’s  website . Yoshiaki Yamada, a spokesman for Olympus,
declined to comment on the cancellation.  Olympus said it will seek a third-party probe into the
advisory fees after two overseas funds called for an
investigation and Nippon Life Insurance Co., the largest
shareholder, urged the maker of optical equipment to respond to
investor concerns. That followed revelations of the payments by
Michael C. Woodford, who was fired from the post of chief
executive officer on Oct. 14.  The Tokyo-based company on Oct. 19 said it paid $687
million in fees, including a $443 million buyback of preferred
shares, for the $2 billion purchase of Gyrus Group Plc in 2008.
A day earlier, Kikukawa said the amount was only about half as
much.  Shares of the world’s biggest maker of endoscopes have
fallen by half, erasing more than $4 billion in market value, in
the six trading days since Woodford was fired. Woodford,
Olympus’ first non-Japanese CEO, has said he was ousted for
challenging the payments to advisers on the Gyrus transaction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
