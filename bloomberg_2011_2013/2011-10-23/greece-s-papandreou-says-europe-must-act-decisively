Greek Prime Minister  George
Papandreou  said the debt crisis has spread beyond  Greece  and
called on European leaders to “act decisively” to put it to
rest.  “Greece has proven again and again that we are making the
necessary decisions to make our economy sustainable and make our
economy more just,” Papandreou told reporters before a European
Union summit in Brussels today. “We are a proud people, we are
a proud nation. We demand that respect of what we’re doing and
we are doing what we need from our side, the responsibility that
we are taking on with great pain to make Greece a different
country. But it’s been proven now that the crisis is not a Greek
crisis. The crisis is a European crisis. Now is the time that we
as Europeans need to act decisively and effectively.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
