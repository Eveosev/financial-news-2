The euro area is determined to avoid
triggering credit-default swaps in securing higher bondholder
losses on  Greece ’s debt and may produce a projection for the
overall writedown at an Oct. 26 summit, a Greek government
official told reporters today in Brussels on the condition of
anonymity.  The official said the 17-nation euro area is committed to
seeking deeper losses for bondholders on a voluntary basis and
in a way that would be legally secure. The person spoke as euro-
area government heads reworked a July 21 accord on a new aid
package for Greece that foresaw a 21 percent loss for
bonholders, a writedown now deemed inadequate because of
Greece’s economic slump.  Euro-area leaders are due to meet again in Brussels on Oct.
26 to continue work on a new rescue of Greece and on ways to
bolster the region’s rescue fund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
