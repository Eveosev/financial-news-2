Government of Singapore Investment
Corp. is “holding talks” in connection with a possible sale of
Bank Sarasin & Cie. AG,  Der Sonntag  reported, citing
unidentified sources.  Sarasin rose the most in 21 years Oct. 13 after
Handelszeitung reported that  Julius Baer Group Ltd. (BAER)  made a bid
for the Swiss wealth manager controlled by Rabobank Groep NV.
“Several potentially interested parties” are in talks about
buying a stake in Sarasin owned by Rabobank, Basel, Switzerland-
based Sarasin said at the time.  Franziska Gumpfer-Keller, a spokeswoman for Sarasin,
couldn’t be immediately reached for comment on the report in Der
Sonntag.  To contact the reporter on this story:
