The  International Monetary Fund 
stands ready to provide additional financing for  Europe , the
fund’s deputy managing director said.  “We stand ready to provide whatever the Europeans want
from us, whether it’s technical advice, assistance on monitoring
their economies, we can do that,” IMF Deputy Managing Director
Nemat Shafik said in an interview today at the  World Economic
Forum  in  Jordan . “And if it’s additional financing, we stand
ready to supply that, as well,” she said.  “We’ve said that the world economy was entering a very
dangerous phase,” Shafik said. “We said that because a
slowdown in Europe and the slowdown in the U.S. has meant that
global growth is likely to be slower than we’d expected.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
