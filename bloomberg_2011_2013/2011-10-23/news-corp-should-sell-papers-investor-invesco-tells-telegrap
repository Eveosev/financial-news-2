News Corp. (NWSA)  should sell its
newspapers and double the size of its share buy-back plan, Kevin
Holt of Invesco, a shareholder in the company, told the Sunday
Telegraph.  Newspapers no longer have a competitive advantage and
Invesco owns shares in the company in spite of the fact that
News Corp. has its U.K. newspapers, Holt told the Telegraph.  To contact the reporter on this story:
