Australian shares and Japanese  stock
futures  climbed after European leaders outlined plans to aid
banks, inching toward a revamped strategy to contain the Greece-
fueled debt crisis.  American depositary receipts of  Sony Corp. (6758) ,  Japan ’s No. 1
exporter of consumer electronics that gets 21 percent of its
sales in Europe, gained 1.4 percent from the closing share price

makers will announce significant measures to bolster the bailout
fund and resolve Greece’s debt crisis, while also supporting the
region’s banks,” said Stan Shamu, a strategist at IG Markets in
Melbourne. “The tight ranges that markets have been trading in
are likely to continue until a resolution is reached.”  Debt Crisis  European leaders meeting in Brussels at the weekend
excluded a forced restructuring of Greece’s debt, sticking with
the policy of enticing bondholders to accept “voluntary”
losses to help restore the country’s finances. The complete
blueprint will be formed Oct. 26.  New York-traded copper futures jumped 5.4 percent, the most

today after officials ruled out tapping the European Central
Bank’s balance sheet to boost the region’s rescue fund. The
gauge climbed 1.9 percent on Oct. 21, capping its longest weekly
rally since February, as European governments considered
deploying $1.3 trillion in funds to tame the crisis.  “Although a final decision on plans to handle European
sovereign debt is not due to be announced until Wednesday, the
reports from yesterday’s leaders’ summit may see investors on
the sidelines waiting for greater clarity,” said Ric Spooner,
chief market analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index declined 16 percent this year
through Oct. 21, compared with a 1.5 percent drop by the  S&P 500
