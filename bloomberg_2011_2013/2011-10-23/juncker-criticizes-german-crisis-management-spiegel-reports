Luxembourg’sJean-Claude Juncker
criticized  Germany ’s management of the euro debt crisis, saying
the “pace of organization in Berlin is slower than in other
capitals,”  Der Spiegel  reported, citing an interview.  Germany’s provisos for parliamentary control over the
decision-making process means the European Union can’t react as
swiftly as is necessary, the German news magazine cites Juncker
as saying.  Juncker heads the group of euro-area finance ministers,
which is gathered in Brussels as European leaders make a last-
ditch effort to stamp out the two-year-old financial crisis that
threatens to tip the world into recession.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
