German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said
the solution to the European debt crisis lies in “more
Europe.”  “We are preparing today the decisions for Wednesday,”
Merkel said today in Brussels as she arrived for a meeting of
European Union leaders. “That’s important because we’re dealing
with a technically complex process, such as how the EFSF
functions. That’s why we have to work very carefully; that’s why
we have to consider all possible details. That’s why today one
shouldn’t expect decisions of the eurogroup but Wednesday,” she
said.  “Everyone knows that we have to treat things very well and
such that solutions will come from it all,” Merkel said.
“That’s why today I think we’ll have very concentrated and
important discussions.”  The leaders “have to discuss, for example, how we want to
shape the coordination of the eurogroup on economic and
financial subjects in the future,” she said. “We need more
 Europe  and stronger intervention powers and treaty changes
mustn’t be a taboo here.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
