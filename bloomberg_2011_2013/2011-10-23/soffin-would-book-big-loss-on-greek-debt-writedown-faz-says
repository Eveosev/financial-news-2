Soffin,  Germany ’s financial-rescue
fund, would book a “very big loss” should investors take
writedowns on Greek debt,  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  said
yesterday, citing an interview with Soffin director Christopher Pleister.  Soffin has already written down 4.9 billion euros ($6.8
billion) of investments in Hypo Real Estate Holding AG and 1
billion euros for WestLB AG, the German newspaper cited Pleister
as saying.  The rescue fund has also set aside 3.9 billion euros for
FMS Wertmanagement, the bad bank in charge of winding down
assets from Hypo Real Estate, Pleister told FAZ.  To contact the reporter on this story:
