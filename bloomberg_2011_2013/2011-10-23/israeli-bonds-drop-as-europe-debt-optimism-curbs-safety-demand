Israel ’s 10-year government bond
fell, pushing the yield to the highest level in almost a month,
as speculation European leaders will find a solution to the
region’s debt crisis curbed demand for safer assets.  The yield on the benchmark 5.5 Mimshal Shiklit bond due
January 2022 advanced two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 4.72 percent at the 4:30 p.m. close in  Tel Aviv ., the
highest level since Sept. 25. The Tel Aviv Bond 40 Index and the
TA-25 Index of the country’s largest stocks advanced to the
highest in almost three months.  “Some confidence is returning to the local market on hopes
a solution for the debt crisis in  Europe  is close, which is
fueling investors’ appetite for riskier assets in the corporate
market,” Gil Chen, a bond trader, at I.B.I.-Israel Brokerage &
Investments Ltd. in Tel Aviv said by telephone. “There are also
more signs the Bank of Israel won’t cut borrowing costs at
tomorrow’s meeting.”  European leaders have descended on Brussels for meetings in
an effort to stamp out a two-year-old financial crisis that
threatens to tip the world into a recession. They have set a
self-imposed deadline of Oct. 26 to complete a plan to beef up
the euro bailout fund and cut  Greece ’s debt without triggering a
default.  Two-year interest-rate swaps, an indicator of investor
expectations for rates over the period were at 2.79 percent on
Oct. 21, holding at the highest level since Sept. 23. The  Bank
of Israel  will hold its key lending rate at 3 percent tomorrow,
according to 17 of 20 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  September Cut  Central bank Governor  Stanley Fischer  lowered the benchmark
interest rate for the first time in 2 1/2 years on Sept. 26,
citing the worsening global outlook. Three of the 20 economists
in the Bloomberg survey expect another quarter-point cut to 2.75
percent.  “The central bank may wait and hold  interest rates 
tomorrow as there are signs for a possible breakthrough in
Europe’s debt crisis,” Assaf Rosenberg, head of fixed-income
sales at Excellence Nessuah Investment House Ltd. in  Ramat Gan ,
Israel, said by telephone. “Also, global inflation may pose a
renewed risk as commodity prices advance, which in turn may not
justify an interest rate cut this time.”  Inflation Expectations  Crude oil closed at $87.40 a barrel on Oct. 21 after
surging 10 percent over the past three weeks.  The two-year breakeven rate, which reflects market
expectations for inflation over the time period, climbed 11
basis points to 173, implying an average annual inflation rate
of 1.73 percent. The yield on the CPI-linked bond due in June
2013 dropped seven basis points to 1.1 percent.  The Tel-Bond 40 Index of corporate bonds increased 0.2
percent and the TA-25  stock index  jumped 1.8 percent.  Investors withdrew a net 60 million shekels ($16.5 million)
from Israeli funds from Oct. 9 to Oct. 18, Meitav Investment
House Ltd. said today in an e-mailed report. The redemptions
included 220 million shekels from corporate-bond funds, while
stock funds raised 15 million shekels and money-market funds
pulled in about 170 million shekels.  The shekel gained 0.7 percent to 3.6339 against the dollar
on Oct. 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
