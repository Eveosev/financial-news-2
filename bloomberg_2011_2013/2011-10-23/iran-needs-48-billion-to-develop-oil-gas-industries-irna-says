Iran  needs to invest $48 billion to
spur development of its oil and natural-gas industries, the
official  Islamic Republic News Agency  reported, citing Deputy
Oil Minister Mohsen Khojasteh-Mehr.  Development of the South Pars gas field, the worldâ€™s
largest deposit of the fuel, is a priority, and funds will be
channeled there for as long as necessary, he said. Some $16
billion needs to be invested at the field, which Iran shares
with Qatar, Khojasteh-Mehr said, without specifying a date.  In 2009, Iran said that development of the remaining phases
of South Pars required investment of $40 billion over 10 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
