the population, the regulator said.  ECONOMY:  *The PP would win 45.4 percent of the vote, compared with

compared with 119 seats for the Socialists, according to El
Mundo.  EQUITIES:  *Iberdrola SA is bidding to build a natural-gas, combined-cycle power plant in Mexico’s Morelos state, El Economista
