EQT Partners AB and Bain Capital LLC
are considering a purchase of dental implant maker  Nobel Biocare
Holding AG (NOBN) , NZZ am Sonntag reported, citing two unidentified
sources.  EQT, a Stockholm-based private equity company, has been
looking at Nobel Biocare as a takeover target “for some time,”
 NZZ  reported today, citing the sources. EQT didn’t reply to a
written request for information, the newspaper said.  Bain, a U.S. buyout fund manager, has been trying to decide
for “several months” whether Nobel Biocare is a “buy” or
whether the shares will fall further, according to the report.
The  investment company  has had “informal contact” with Rolf
Watter, Nobel Biocare’s chairman, the report said. Bain declined
to comment on whether it was considering Nobel Biocare, while
Watter said the company hasn’t received an offer and isn’t “in
talks.”  Nicolas Weidmann, a spokesman for Nobel Biocare, confirmed
Watter’s comments to Bloomberg News today and said “so far we
have had no contact and are in no discussions with anyone.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
