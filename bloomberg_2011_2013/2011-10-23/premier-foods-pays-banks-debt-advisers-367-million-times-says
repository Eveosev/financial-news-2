Premier Foods Plc has paid almost
230 million pounds ($367 million) to banks and debt-
restructuring advisers in the past year, more than twice its
market value, the Sunday Times reported.  The maker of Hovis bread and Mr. Kipling cakes paid banks
120 million pounds last October to close out interest-rate swap
agreements that would otherwise have run until 2037, according
to the newspaper, which didnâ€™t say where it obtained the
information.  It also paid 9 million pounds in fees to debt-restructuring
advisers, the Times said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
