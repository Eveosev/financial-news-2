Premier  Wen Jiabao  said  China  must
continue controls over the  property market  and that construction
of public housing is at a “critical” stage, according to a
statement on the central government’s website.  Separately, the official Xinhua News Agency reported that
China will start assessing energy use at the provincial level
and implement controls on consumption, citing  Jiang Bing , head
of the National Energy Administration’s planning and development
department. Renewable energy use will be waived in the
assessment, the report said.
