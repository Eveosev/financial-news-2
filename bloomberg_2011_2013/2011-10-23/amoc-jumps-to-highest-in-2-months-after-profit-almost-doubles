Alexandria Mineral Oils Co. (AMOC)  climbed
to the highest level in almost two months after the Egyptian
petroleum-products producer said first fiscal-quarter profit
almost doubled.  Shares of the Alexandria, Egypt-based company rose 3.1
percent to 67.5 Egyptian pounds at 10:47 a.m. in Cairo, the
highest intraday level since Aug. 25. The benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30) 
gained 1 percent.  Net income for the three-months that ended Sept. 30 was
385.3 million Egyptian pounds ($64 million) compared with 205.5
million pounds a year earlier, the company said in a filing to
the Egyptian bourse today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
