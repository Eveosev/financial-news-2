South African Mines Minister Susan Shabangu has “intervened” to help end an eight-day strike at
 Xstrata Plc (XTA)  that’s cut output at the world’s largest exporter of
coal used in  power plants .  “The minister has intervened in the matter in the
interests of the sector,” Zingaphi Jakuja, a spokeswoman for
the minister, said in a mobile-phone interview today. “The
minister wants them to find solutions and to get them around the
negotiating table.”  As many as 6,400 workers have walked off the job since Oct.
16 to demand equal benefits for all employees under a share-
ownership program. Xstrata’s coal operations have been
“significantly impacted” by the strike, the company said on
Oct. 18.  The  National Union of Mineworkers  will meet with Xstrata
management tomorrow to resume talks to end the dispute, though
the strike is still ongoing, union spokesman Lesiba Seshoka said
today in a phone interview.  “There was a high-level intervention made to resolve the
impasse,” Seshoka said. “There will definitely be talks taking
place tomorrow.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
