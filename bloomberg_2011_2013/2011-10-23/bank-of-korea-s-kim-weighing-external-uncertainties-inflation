South Korea ’s central bank will
“normalize”  interest rates  as much as external uncertainties
allow, Bank of Korea Governor Kim Choong Soo said.  “We need to keep moving” to curb inflation that is
exceeding the central bank’s target limit of 4 percent, Kim told
reporters in Incheon, west of  Seoul . “Given the impact on the
entire economy, we cannot raise interest rates as much and as
fast as cutting them during a crisis.”  The Bank of Korea kept its benchmark seven-day repurchase
rate at 3.25 percent on Oct. 13 for a fourth straight month as
Europe’s debt crisis and a faltering U.S. recovery cloud the
outlook the country’s exports. Rising risks to growth prompted
 Indonesia  to unexpectedly cut interest rates this month,
followed by Brazil. The Philippines unveiled fiscal stimulus.  Kim, who was speaking on Oct. 21 in comments that were
released today, also said that the nation’s economic growth this
year may fall slightly short of an estimate of 4.3 percent
projected in July due to weakness in the U.S. and European
economies. Quarterly GDP growth slowed to 0.6 percent in the
third quarter from 0.9 percent in the second, according to a
survey by Bloomberg News. GDP data will be released on Oct. 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
