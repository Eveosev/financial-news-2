Jordan signed a $300 million loan
guarantee agreement with the U.S. today that aims to facilitate
extending credit to small and medium-sized businesses.  The loan guarantees, provided by the Overseas Private
Investment Corp. and the United States Agency for International
Development, seek to create more than 31,500 jobs by supporting
startups, Elizabeth Littlefield, president of the OPIC, said at
a meeting at the  Dead Sea  in Amman.  U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in March that
the U.S. would provide as much as $2 billion to back private
sector investment in the  Middle East  and North Africa, OPIC
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
