Italian Prime Minister  Silvio
Berlusconi  said his country’s economic fundamentals are solid
and he is confident of achieving a balanced budget in 2013.  “We aim to reach a balanced budget by 2013, but we could
reduce the debt even earlier by selling public real estate,”
Berlusconi told reporters today in Brussels after a summit of
European leaders. “There isn’t and there won’t be any risk for
 Italy .”  Berlusconi said he is thinking about a reform of the
pension system. The cabinet will discuss new measures at a
meeting tomorrow, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
