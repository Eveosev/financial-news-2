European Union President  Herman Van Rompuy  said he is confident of getting an agreement on bank
recapitalization at a summit of leaders on Oct. 26.   “The immediate  economic challenges  are serious: pressure
on banks and on sovereign bonds, slowing economic growth, rising
unemployment,” Van Rompuy said today after a meeting of the 27
EU heads of state or government. “We are taking political
action on all those fronts.”  The EU economy “must regain safe ground,” he said.
“Stimulating growth is essential for that. A perspective of
sustained economic growth can bring back confidence, create jobs
and absorb debt.” The leaders agreed to “accelerate those
measures in the single market which will create jobs and growth
in the short and medium term,”  Van Rompuy  said.  “Fiscal margins are currently limited for most member
states,” he said. “We therefore combine measures that bring
deficits under control with policies that cushion growth.”  Van Rompuy said  Europe ’s trade relations with international
partners “is another are another element of growth” and
leaders today “discussed how to use these relations more
strategically.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
