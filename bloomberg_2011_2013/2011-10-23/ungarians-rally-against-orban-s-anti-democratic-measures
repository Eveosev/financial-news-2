Tens of thousands of Hungarians
protested in Budapest against the policies of Prime Minister
 Viktor Orban  at a rally dubbed “I Don’t Like the System,”
claiming the government’s measures were “anti-democratic” and
“destroyed the rule of law.”  The demonstration was organized by a civic group formed on
social networking website Facebook Inc. and called “One Million
for Press Freedom,” initially set up to protest a media law
passed by Parliament last year and later amended at the request
of the European Union.  “They’re enacting anti-democratic and unjust measures and
thus build up an anti-democratic and unjust system,” Peter
Juhasz, spokesman for the group, told Bloomberg News. The
measures “destroy the rule of law,” he said.  The number of participants was close to 100,000, Juhasz
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
