Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  and
distressed-debt hedge fund Strategic Value Partners offered to
inject cash into Ferretti SpA in the second rescue of the luxury
yachtmaker in two years, the Sunday Times reported, without
saying where it got the information.  They offered to invest between 150 million euros ($206
million) and 180 million euros into the Italian company and cut
its debt further after lenders agreed to reduce the liabilities
to about 600 million euros from more than 1 billion euros in
2009 in exchange for a 53 percent stake, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
