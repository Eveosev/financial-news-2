European Union finance ministers
will meet Oct. 26 to complete work on bank-recapitalization
plans, EU leaders indicated in a draft statement today.  The finance chiefs, who met yesterday in Brussels for 10
hours, have progressed “on measures for the banking sector”
and should “finalize this work” at a meeting on Oct. 26, the
EU’s government heads said in the draft text obtained by
Bloomberg News.   The EU’s 27 leaders are meeting today in Brussels, with the
euro area’s 17 government heads due to gather in the afternoon
and again in three days to draw up a plan to stem the Greece-
triggered debt crisis. Bank recapitalization is one part.  “These measures will be an essential component of a
broader package whose other elements will be agreed by the euro
summit of Oct. 26,” according to the statement.   To contact the reporter on this story:
