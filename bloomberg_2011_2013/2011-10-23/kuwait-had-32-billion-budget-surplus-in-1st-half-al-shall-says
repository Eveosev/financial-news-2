Kuwait had a preliminary budget
surplus of 8.87 billion dinars ($32.2 billion) in the first half
of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2012,  Al-Shall Economic
Consultants  reported today, citing Finance Ministry data.  Income was 13.93 billion dinars, including oil revenue of
13.29 billion dinars, while spending was 5.06 billion dinars,
Al-Shall said in a weekly report.  By law, 10 percent of revenue is saved in the  Reserve Fund 
for Future Generations. The budget is based on an oil price of
