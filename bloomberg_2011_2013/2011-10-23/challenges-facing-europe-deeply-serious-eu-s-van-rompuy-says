Europe ’s economy faces “deeply
serious” challenges that the region’s leaders are working hard
to overcome, European Union President  Herman Van Rompuy  said.  “The current economic challenges are deeply serious:
slowing economic growth, rising unemployment, pressure on the
banks, and risks in sovereign bonds,” Van Rompuy said in his
opening remarks today at a summit of EU heads of state and
government in Brussels. “Our meetings of today and Wednesday
are important steps -- perhaps the most important ones -- in the
series to overcome the financial crisis. Even if further steps
will be needed,” he said.  “Some of those steps were and are unpopular; be it
measures taken in your countries or our joint decisions taken
here as a union,”  Van Rompuy  said. “These steps forward also
require simple and plain hard work.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
