Kuwait’s  Capital Markets Authority 
filed a case in the country’s court to challenge a cabinet
decree ending the tenure of three of its board members,
according to an e-mailed statement today.  The market regulator received the government’s decree
issued on Oct. 19 terminating the memberships of Saleh Mohammed
al-Yousif, Yousif al-Ali and Naif Falah al-Hajraf, the statement
said. The legal measures were taken to “emphasize the
authority’s independence,” according to the statement.  Kuwaiti newspapers reported that the government revoked
memberships of the three members for allegedly violating
regulations by maintaining second jobs while serving on the
board of the authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
