Investment in Australia’s resources
sector will surpass A$80 billion ($82 billion) annually by 2015,
boosted by development projects in oil and gas,  iron ore , coal
and copper, said research group BIS Shrapnel Pty.  “Demand for metals and minerals continues to be driven by
the long-term industrial development of  China  and  India ,”
Adrian Hart, senior manager of infrastructure and mining at BIS
Shrapnel, said in a report. “Mining companies are not overly
perturbed by current global economic conditions or the prospect
of new Australian taxes on resource profits or carbon.”  China, the world’s biggest metals’ buyer and Australia’s
largest trading partner, grew at an average pace of 9.5 percent
over the past four quarters, making it the fastest expanding
major economy. The rise in mine investment follows the approval
and start of several large projects that will proceed even if
global economic conditions remain weak, Hart said.  Mining investment in  Australia  rose 11 percent in fiscal
2011, recovering after new projects were shelved during the
global financial crisis, Sydney-based BIS Shrapnel said.
Investment in fiscal 2011 was A$50.1 billion and will increase a
further 66 per cent to A$83 billion by fiscal 2016, it said.  Australia is the world’s biggest exporter of iron ore, used
to make steel, and coal, as well as alumina, a raw material to
make aluminum metal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
