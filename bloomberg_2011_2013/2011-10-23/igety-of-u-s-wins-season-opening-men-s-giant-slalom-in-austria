Ted Ligety of the U.S. won today’s
giant slalom in Soelden,  Austria , the opening race of the men’s
 World Cup  ski season.  Ligety, the defending World Cup champion in the discipline,
had a time of 2 minutes, 22.00 seconds on the Rettenbach slope.
Alexis Pinturault of France finished 0.29 seconds behind in
second and Austrian Philipp Schoerghofer was 0.51 seconds back
in third place.  “It’s awesome, it’s sweet to keep it rolling from last
year,” Ligety said on the World Cup website.  The victory completes an American sweep of the season-
opening races after Lindsay Vonn won the women’s giant slalom in
Soelden yesterday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
