Conergy AG, a German solar group,
said Chief Financial Officer Sebastian Biedenkopf is to leave
the company.  Biedenkopf “has exercised his special right of termination
on the basis of the change in Conergy’s shareholder structure
which occurred in July of this year,” the company said in a
statement today. “According to the contractual arrangement he
will leave the company end of February 2012.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
