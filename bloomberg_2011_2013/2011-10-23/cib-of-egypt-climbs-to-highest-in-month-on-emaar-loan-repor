Commercial International Bank Egypt
SAE (COMI)  rose to the highest level in more than a month after Al Mal
reported the lender agreed to participate in a loan to property
developer Emaar Egypt.  Shares of the Cairo-based bank advanced 2.2 percent to 25
Egyptian pounds at 10:56 a.m. in Cairo, the highest intraday
level since Sept. 21. The benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  gained 1
percent.  The bank, also known as CIB, and the local unit of London-
based HSBC Holdings Plc have agreed to lend Emaar Egypt 2.1
billion Egyptian pounds ($351 million) for six years, Al Mal
reported, citing unidentified sources.  Fifty-six percent of the funds will be used to refinance
existing debt, while the remainder will be invested in Emaarâ€™s
three real-estate projects in  Egypt , the Cairo-based newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
