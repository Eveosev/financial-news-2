European leaders have to reach an
accord on the “orderly” management of Greek debt and the
recapitalization of banks to avoid a crisis, Pier Carlo Padoan,
chief economist of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development, told daily  il Messaggero .  If an accord isn’t reached by the G20 in Cannes, “the
prospects of a general crisis of the euro area will become much
stronger,” Padoan said in the interview. He added that the
consequences would also be “extremely serious for  Italy  with
the risk of a new recession.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
