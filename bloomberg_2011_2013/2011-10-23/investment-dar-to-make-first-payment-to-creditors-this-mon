Investment Dar Co., the Kuwait-
based owner of half of Aston Martin Lagonda Ltd., will make the
first payment to creditors before the end of October under a
plan to restructure 1.37 billion dinars ($5 billion) of debt.  “The decision to make this first payment well in advance
of the deadline set out in the court-approved restructuring plan
is in line with our objective of ensuring the plan’s effective
delivery,” Chairman Adnan al-Musallam said in an e-mailed
statement today.  The restructuring is being implemented under  Kuwait ’s
Financial Stability Law, which was enacted by the government in
April 2009 to bolster financial institutions hurt by the credit
crisis. Investment Dar, which missed a payment on a $100 million
Islamic bond in May 2009, started talks in 2009 to restructure
its debt after the financial crisis hit Kuwaiti banks and
investment firms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
