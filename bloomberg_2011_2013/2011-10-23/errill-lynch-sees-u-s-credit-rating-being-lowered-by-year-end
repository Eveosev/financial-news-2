The U.S. government’s credit rating
probably will be lowered again this year as the so-called super
committee fails to produce a credible plan to rein in budget
deficits, Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch unit said in a
note to clients.  While the impact of a downgrade may not be as severe as the
reaction in August when  Standard & Poor’s  cut the U.S.’s credit
grade, such an action is among the reasons that the risks are
increasing of a recession next year, according to Merrill Lynch
economists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
