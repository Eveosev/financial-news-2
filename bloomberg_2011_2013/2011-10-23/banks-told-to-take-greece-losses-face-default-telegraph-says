European leaders may trigger a
formal Greek default if banks refuse to accept losses of as much
as 140 billion euros ($195 million) on their holding of the
countryâ€™s debt, the Sunday Telegraph reported, citing an
unidentified European Union diplomat.  Some euro-zone members, backed by the  International
Monetary Fund , gave the banks the ultimatum this weekend
following a report that Greece could need a second bailout of as
much 450 billion euros, the Telegraph said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
