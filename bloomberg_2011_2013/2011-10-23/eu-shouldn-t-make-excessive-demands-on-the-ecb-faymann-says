Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann
said the European Union shouldn’t make excessive demands on the
 European Central Bank .  “The ECB, from its statutes and the legal possibilities we
gave it, is quite restricted,” Faymann told reporters today in
Brussels. “One shouldn’t ask of the ECB more than” it can
give.  Today’s summit of EU leaders won’t “solve everything for
all eternity,” Faymann said. “I don’t expect a global solution
that would mean we don’t have to meet anymore next month.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
