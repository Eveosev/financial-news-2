Shareholders of  Banca Popolare di
Milano Scarl (PMI)  voted for a group of candidates headed by Filippo
Annunziata, who was named chairman of the supervisory board.  More than 8,000 investors of the oldest Italian cooperative
bank yesterday voted on five lists of candidates for the newly
created supervisory board, the bank said in a stock-exchange
statement. The supervisory board will be in place through 2013,
it said.  Popolare Milano’s shareholders also voted in favor of
adopting a dual-committee structure, replacing the single board
with supervisory and management panels, it said. The Bank of
 Italy  had requested the lender to adopt that structure to limit
the influence of unions on decisions.  The five members of the management board, which will be
responsible for bank strategy, will be appointed by the new
supervisory panel. The management board names the chief
executive officer.  Annunziata’s list was backed by a group called Amici della
BPM, which defeated a rival list backed by Matteo Arpe. Arpe was
pitted against Andrea Bonomi, chairman of buyout firm
Investindustrial SpA, who favors the bank’s existing
reorganization plan. Investindustrial may raise its stake in
Popolare Milano to 9.9 percent, Bonomi said Oct. 17. The stake
increase decision will be based on “management appointments,”
he had said.  This week the lender plans to set terms for a share sale of
800 million euros ($1.11 billion).  Members of the supervisory board:  To contact the reporter on this story:
