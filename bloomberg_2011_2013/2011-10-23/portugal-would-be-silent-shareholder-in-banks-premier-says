Portugal ’s government has no
intention to “nationalize banks,” would be “silent
shareholder” if banks decide to tap the amount earmarked for
the country’s lenders under the bailout plan, Prime Minister
 Pedro Passos Coelho  told reporters in Brussels today.  Portugal’s external aid program includes 12 billion euros
for the recapitalization of banks.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
