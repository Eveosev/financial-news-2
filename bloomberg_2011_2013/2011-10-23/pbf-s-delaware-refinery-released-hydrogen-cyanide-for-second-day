PBF Energy Partners LP’s  Delaware 
City, Delaware, refinery released 200 pounds of hydrogen cyanide
from a catalytic cracker into the air for a second day.  Workers were trying to repair the boiler, according to a
 filing  yesterday with the National Response Center.  U.S. refineries must notify the response center if they
release hazardous substances in excess of reportable quantities,
according to the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund.
Bloomberg News couldn’t immediately verify that the information
in the NRC filing was accurate.  The PBF refinery has a processing capacity of 182,200
barrels a day, according to Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
