Amot Investments Ltd. (AMOT)  increased to
the highest level in almost four months after Clal Finance
Brokerage Ltd. raised its recommendation on the real-estate
developer to “buy” from “outperform.”  The shares climbed 3.6 percent to 9.84 shekels, the highest
since July 5, at the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv.  “Amot is our top pick in the sector with a diversified
portfolio, less leverage and potential for dividend
appreciation,” Yuval Ben Zeev, an analyst at Tel Aviv-based
Clal, wrote in a report today.  Ben Zeev, who increased his share-price estimate on Amot to
12.3 shekels from 11.8 shekels, also raised his recommendations
on  Azrieli Group (AZRG)  Ltd. and Reit 1 Ltd. to “outperform” from
“market perform.”  Azrieli increased 1.9 percent to 91.85 shekels, the highest
in a week. Reit 1 gained 1 percent to 6.72 shekels, the highest
since July 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
