Luke Donald  shot an 8-under-par 64
to win the Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals Classic and the
U.S. PGA Tour money title for 2011.  The 33-year-old Englishman overcame a five-shot third-round
deficit to finish the tournament at 17 under-par 271 today.
Justin Leonard was second, two shots back, after a final round
71 at the Magnolia & Palm Course at Disneyland in Lake Buena
Vista,  Florida .  “This is probably one of the most satisfying wins of my
career,” Donald told reporters. “Under pressure I was able to
pull off the shots when I needed to.”  Donald earns the right to play on the tour for five years
by winning the money title. He collected $846,000 with his
fourth victory on the  PGA Tour , taking his prize money in the
U.S. this year to $6.68 million. He also tops the European Tour
money list with 3.86 million euros ($5.34 million) in on-course
earnings this season.  Donald, the No. 1 player in the  Official World Golf
Ranking , had four birdies and two bogeys over the opening nine
holes today before firing off six birdies in a row from the 10th
hole.  He also won the World Golf Championships Match Play event
this year as well as the British PGA Championship, the European
Tour’s flagship event, and the Scottish Open. He tied for fourth
at the Masters Tournament and Players, was tied for eighth at
the U.S.  PGA Championship  and finished in a tie for third at the
season-ending Tour Championship.  Donald’s last stroke-play victory in the U.S. came at the
2006 Honda Classic.  Webb Simpson , another two-time winner on tour this year,
finished second on the money list, with $6.35 million in prize
money. Simpson finished in a tie for sixth place today, at 13
under par, after a third successive round of 69.  To contact the reporter on this story:
