Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik
Reinfeldt said it is a mistake to think that amending European
Union treaties will solve the debt crisis.  “To make a treaty change takes a long time, it’s very
uncertain for me what we would gain from that and we definitely
would face the risk of political unrest in many countries,”
Reinfeldt told reporters before a EU summit in Brussels today.  Sweden , one of 10 EU countries using its own currency, is
“very far from entering the euro,” he added. He said  Europe 
needs to boost its competitiveness, citing Ireland as an example
of a successful turnaround.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
