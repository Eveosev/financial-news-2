Fire damaged a building housing two
tax offices in the central Athens district of Exarchia following
an explosion,  ANA  reported.  Unidentified individuals climbed stairs to the balcony of the
first floor, smashed the office windows and threw inside a
makeshift incendiary device, consisting of five gas canisters,
which caused a fire that destroyed the entire floor and damaged
the buildingâ€™s facade on the second floor, the Athens-based
state-run  news agency  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
