National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC (NBAD) , the
 United Arab Emirates ’ second-biggest bank by assets, posted a 12
percent increase in third-quarter profit as gains from foreign-
exchange transactions offset investment losses.  Net income rose to 1.03 billion dirhams ($280 million), or
31 fils a share, from 919.8 million dirhams, or 27 fils, the
government-controlled bank said in an e-mailed  statement  today.
That beat the 965 million-dirham median estimate of three
analysts, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Operating
income grew 10 percent to 2 billion dirhams.  The results were “driven by higher-than-expected fees and
commissions, foreign-exchange gains and lower-than-expected
additions to loan-loss reserves, which more than offset
investment losses,”  Jaap Meijer , the Dubai-based head of the
banks team at HC Securities, said in an e-mail today. The bank
is "best-positioned" to benefit from  Abu Dhabi ’s 2030 plan to
diversify its economy, he said.  U.A.E. banks are recovering from the credit crisis, which
slowed lending, hurt  investment banking  and led to rising loan
defaults. The U.A.E. economy, the Arab world’s second-biggest
after  Saudi Arabia , will expand 4 percent this year after 3
percent in 2010, according to Standard Chartered Plc estimates.  “In turbulent and difficult global markets, NBAD has
produced another solid result,” Chief Executive Officer Michael Tomalin said in the statement. The bank will build organically,
widen and strengthen its network, systems and products, he said.  Foreign Exchange  Net gains from foreign exchange-related transactions more
than tripled to 206.6 million dirhams, the bank said. NBAD had a
loss of 27.8 million dirhams on investments in the quarter after
a 47.7 million-dirham gain a year ago.  Overall lending rose 13.6 percent in the nine months
through September to 155.8 billion dirhams, while deposits
increased 15.8 percent to 142.6 billion dirhams. Net bad-loan
charges were unchanged at 320.6 million dirhams, increasing the
proportion of bad loans to gross lending to 2.83 percent from
2.65 percent in the second.  NBAD shares have climbed 2.6 percent this year compared
with a 10 percent decline in the benchmark  ADX General Index. (ADSMI)
