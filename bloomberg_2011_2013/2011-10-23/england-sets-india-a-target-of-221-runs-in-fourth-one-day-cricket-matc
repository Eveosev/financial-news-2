England  set India a target of 221
runs as it tries to secure its first win in their one-day
international cricket series.  England reached 220 all out in their 46.1 overs in the
fourth match in Mumbai as Ravichandran Ashwin and Varun Aaron
took three wickets each and Ravindra Jadeja took two. The
visitors collapsed after reaching 112-2.  India already has an unbeatable 3-0 lead in the five-match
series. The hosts are looking to revenge a winless tour of
England earlier this year. They were swept in a four-match Test
series and also lost a one-day series 3-0 and a Twenty20 match.
England and India have on more one-day game and one Twenty20
game.  England won the toss, and elected to bat.  Tim Bresnan  was
top scorer with 45 runs, while  Kevin Pietersen  scored 41.
Captain Alastair Cook was out for 10, while Ravi Bopara and
Jonny Bairstow failed to reach double digits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
