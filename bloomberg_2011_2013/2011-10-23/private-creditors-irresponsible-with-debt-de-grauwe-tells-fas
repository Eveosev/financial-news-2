Private creditors, not governments,
were irresponsible with taking on debt,  Frankfurter Allgemeine
Sonntagszeitung  reported, citing economist Paul De Grauwe.  In the financial crisis banks took on risks because they
got money from central banks, which is the “moral hazard”
problem, De Grauwe, a professor at the  Catholic University  of
Leuven in Belgium, told the German newspaper in an interview.  The  European Central Bank  is right to buy bonds from the
endangered countries such as Ireland and Spain to avoid
contagion and return confidence to the market, De Grauwe told
FAS.  To contact the reporter on this story:
