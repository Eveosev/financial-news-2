Bahrain will seek more oil and gas
offshore as it plans to increase its refinining capacity by
2018, the country’s Energy Minister Abdul Hussain Ali Mirza said
at an energy and petrochemicals conference in Manama, the
capital of  the Persian Gulf state.  He said the country has plans to expand the refining
capacity to 400,000 barrels of crude per day. Its current output
is about 195,000 barrels per day.  Bahrain needs $15 billion over the next 20 years to expand
production capacity at its mature  oil fields , Bahrain Petroleum
Co.’s Hisham Zubari, the country’s lead negotiator on the
project, said Sept. 26 in Manama. HSBC Holdings Plc said in a
quarterly regional report on Oct. 6 that Bahrain will require an
oil price higher than $100 a barrel this year to balance its
budget, the first Gulf Arab state to have a breakeven price that
high.  The island nation is also seeking to recover natural gas,
he said. Bahrain’s proved gas reserves rank 10th in size in the
 Middle East , at 7.7 trillion cubic feet, or 0.1 percent of the
world total, according to the BP Statistical Review of World
Energy June 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
