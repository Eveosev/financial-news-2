A survey on flight fatigue conducted
by Cathay Pacific on 372 pilots revealed that 5.6 percent
responded to being moderately tired at the top of their
descents, the  South China Morning Post  reported.  The fatigue survey, conducted last November and December
asked pilots to rate how they felt when flights began
descending, ranked from one for fully alert to seven, as
completely exhausted. A rank of five represented being
moderately tired, the paper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
