Egypt  sold nine-month treasury bills
at the highest yield in more than two weeks as the  International
Monetary Fund  said the country’s economic outlook is “bumpy”
in the short term.  The Arab country met its target of raising 4.5 billion
Egyptian pounds ($753 million) at today’s auction, according to
 Central Bank  of Egypt data on Bloomberg. The average yield on
nine-month securities rose 10 basis points from a sale last week
to 13.725 percent, the highest level since bills issued on Oct.
4. The yield on three-month notes sold today fell 19 basis
points, or 0.19 percentage point, 12.242 percent.  The IMF is “very keen” to support the Egyptian government
in the wake of the uprising that ousted former President  Hosni
Mubarak  in February, the fund’s deputy managing director Nemat
Shafik, said today in an interview at the World Economic Forum
in Jordan. Egypt suspended negotiations with the IMF earlier
this year over a $3 billion loan and has instead turned to
Persian Gulf governments for economic assistance.  The costs of selling pound-denominated debt, which Egypt
relies on to finance its  budget deficit , are near the highest
levels in almost three years.  The yield on Egypt’s 5.75 percent 10-year dollar bond due
April 2020 fell less than 0.1 percent to 5.85 percent on Oct.
21. The pound was unchanged at 5.9755 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
