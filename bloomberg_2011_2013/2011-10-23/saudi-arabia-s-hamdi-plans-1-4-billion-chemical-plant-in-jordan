Al Hamdi Group, a Saudi Arabian
mining company, plans to build a $1.4 billion chemical plant in
 Jordan , the chairman said.  Construction will start in the second quarter, with the
factory producing 310,000 tons of phosphoric acid annually once
it is operational in less than two years, Abdul Karim al-Hamdi
said in an interview in Amman today.  “Our group has plans to invest more in the mining sector
in Jordan as this sector is very strategic and vital for the
group,” al-Hamdi said after signing an agreement with the
Jordan Investment Board. “We seek to open new markets in  South
Asia ,  India , Pakistan and some African countries. Demand for
fertilizers is on the rise.”  The total capacity will be eventually doubled, he said,
without specifying a timeframe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
