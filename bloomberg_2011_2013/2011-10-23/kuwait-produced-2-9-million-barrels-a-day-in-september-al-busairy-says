Kuwait, the fifth-largest producer
in OPEC, pumped 2.9 million barrels a day of crude in September
and sees current prices as reasonable for exporters and
importers, Oil Minister Mohammad al-Busairy said.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will
consider altering output in response to an increase in Libyan
production when it meets next in December, he told reporters at
a conference at the  Dead Sea  in Jordan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
