U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
said the debt crisis in the euro region is having a “chilling
effect” across all of  Europe .  “The crisis in the euro zone is having an effect on all
our economies, Britain included,” Cameron told reporters today
in Brussels as he arrived for a summit of European leaders.
“It’s having a chilling effect. We need to deal with this issue
and so it’s right to have a European Council and for the
European Council to discuss this issue here in Brussels today.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
