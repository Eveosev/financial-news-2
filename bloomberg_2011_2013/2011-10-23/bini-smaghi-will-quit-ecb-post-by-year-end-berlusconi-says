Lorenzo Bini Smaghi will quit his
post on the Executive Board of the  European Central Bank  by year
end, Italian Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  said.  “I’m sure that Bini Smaghi will realize that he cannot be
the casus belli of a relationship that is worsening between us
and France and that he will quit by the end of the year, as it
was agreed,” Berlusconi told reporters in Brussels today after
discussing the issue with French President Nicolas Sarkozy
during a summit of European leaders.  Sarkozy backed Italy’s Mario Draghi to head the ECB with
the understanding that Bini Smaghi would quit and make way for a
French candidate for the central bank’s board. Berlusconi passed
over Bini Smaghi this week as Draghi’s replacement at the  Bank
of Italy .  “What should I do, should I kill him?” Berlusconi said he
told Sarkozy today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
