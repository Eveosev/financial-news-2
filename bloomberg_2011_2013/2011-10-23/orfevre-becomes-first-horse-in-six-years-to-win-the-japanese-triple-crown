Orfevre became the first racehorse
to win  Japan ’s triple crown in six years and only the seventh
overall when he captured the 233 million yen ($3 million
dollars) Kikuka Sho, also called the Japanese St. Leger, at
Kyoto racecourse today.  Jockey Kenichi Ikezoe drove Orfevre, the pre-race favorite,
to the lead of the 18-horse field as they entered the closing
stretch of the 3,000-meter event in Kyoto, accelerating away
from the pack to record a 2.5-length victory from fast-closing
second favorite Win Variation.  “During the race he wanted to run on ahead so I was trying
to hold him back,” Ikezoe said in a post-race interview
broadcast on Fuji Television. “It’s a major relief as so many
people wanted this horse to win. I’m very proud that Orfevre
made me a triple crown-winning jockey. There’s definitely more
to come from him, more for his fans to cheer about.”  The one-two finish was a repeat of the Japan Derby at Tokyo
racecourse in May. Orfevre also won the Satsuki Sho, or Japanese
2000 Guineas, in April, making him the first winner of the three
so-called classic races for three-year-olds since Deep Impact in
2005.  Deep Impact gained a cult-like following during his triple
crown year and was credited by the Japan Racing Association with
helping to slow a slide in revenue. He was sold to a syndicate
of breeders for a record 5.1 billion yen in 2006.  The other horses to win Japan’s triple crown were Narita
Brian, Symboli Rudolf, Mr.C.B., Shinzan and Saint Lite.  To contact the reporter on this story:
