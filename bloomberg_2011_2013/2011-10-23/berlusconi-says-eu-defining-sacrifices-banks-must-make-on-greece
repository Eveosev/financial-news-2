 Italian Prime Minister  Silvio
Berlusconi  said the European Union is defining the
“sacrifices” that banks need to make on  Greece ’s debt.  Vittorio Grilli, head of the EU’s Economic and Finance
Committee, has been charged with negotiating deeper writedowns
for Greek bondholders. A July agreement foresaw 21 percent
losses on Greek debt for private investors.  “Grilli will hold negotiations with banks and funds to
define the sacrifices of the private sector and to avoid a Greek
default, because we don’t want any country to leave the euro,”
Berlusconi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
