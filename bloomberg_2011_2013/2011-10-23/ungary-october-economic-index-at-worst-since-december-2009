Hungary’s economic-sentiment index
slid for a sixth month in October, dropping to its lowest level
since December 2009 as business and consumer confidence fell.  The index declined to minus 24 from minus 20.9 the previous
month, the Budapest-based GKI research institute said today in
an e-mailed statement. The business confidence index dropped to
minus 14.9 from minus 11.7 in September, while the consumer
confidence index fell to minus 49.8 from minus 47.2.  “The escalation in pessimism has been on the cards for
eight months,” GKI said. Both business and consumer
expectations reached “rather low levels last seen in late 2009-
early 2010.”  Economic growth stalled in the second quarter after exports
slowed and investments fell. Gross domestic product may expand
0.6 percent in 2012, undershooting the government’s 1.5 percent
forecast, central bank President Andras Simor said Oct. 18.  Hungarians are struggling to repay Swiss franc-denominated
mortgages, which make up two-thirds of all such loans, after the
advance of the Alpine currency boosted repayments and triggered
defaults. The government raised excise taxes on tobacco and
diesel this year and will increase the value-added tax to a
European Union-high of 27 percent from 2012 to meet its budget-
deficit goals.  Households’ fear of unemployment and accelerating inflation
grew more quickly in October, GKI said. Business confidence fell
in all sectors except construction, with the outlook for
industry, whose exports helped pull the country out of
recession, “deteriorating significantly,” GKI said. Industrial
businesses’ willingness to employ new staff dropped.  GKI’s indexes are calculated based on a balance of positive
and negative answers to questions about the outlook for the
economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
