The Zimbabwe Revenue Authority
collected $660.7 million in the third quarter, surpassing its
$654.9 million target because of improved tax collection, the
Standard reported, citing Chairman Stanford Moyo.  Most of the revenue came from value-added tax, personal tax
and customs duty, which contributed $225.5 million, $148.6
million and $85 million respectively, Moyo said in a statement
published today in the Harare-based weekly newspaper.  “Cumulative net collections are now slightly below $2
billion against a target of $1.8 billion,” he said in the
statement. Moyo said this year’s target will be surpassed
because of improved economic performance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
