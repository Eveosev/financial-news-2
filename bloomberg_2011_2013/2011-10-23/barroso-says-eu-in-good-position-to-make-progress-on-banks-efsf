European Commission President  Jose
Barroso  said European leaders are in “good” position to make
progress on on their crisis-response measures.  “Tonight we will still have a lot of work,” Barroso told
reporters today in Brussels, where leaders are meeting. “I
think we should make significant progress on the rest of the
comprehensive package,” he said.  “I think we are in a good situation to make progress so
that we can finalize our work on Wednesday, namely with
agreements on  Greece , on banks, on leveraging the EFSF and on
governance,” Barroso said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
