There is speculation that  Deutsche
Bank AG (DBK)  co-Chief Executive Officer designate Anshu Jain will
become sole CEO while fellow co-CEO designateJuergen Fitschen
takes on the role of supervisory board chief, Spiegel reported.  People involved reject the idea and say it wouldn’t conform
to laws governing companies, the German news magazine reported
without identifying the people or specifying where it got the
information.  Deutsche Bank said July 25 that investment-banking chief
Jain and Fitschen, a management board member, will become co-
CEOs next year, while CEO  Josef Ackermann  may ascend to the role
of supervisory board chairman.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
