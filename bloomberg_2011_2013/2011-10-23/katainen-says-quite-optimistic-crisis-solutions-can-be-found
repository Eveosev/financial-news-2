Finnish Prime Minister  Jyrki
Katainen  said he is “quite optimistic” that European leaders
will find solutions to the debt crisis.  “We try to devise something and I’m quite optimistic that
today and on Wednesday we can find solutions,” Katainen told
reporters today in Brussels. “I wouldn’t like to speculate
before everything is ready,” he said.  “The important thing is that we can get a common scheme
for recapitalization for banks and then the lending capacity of
the EFSF is a crucial point,” Katainen said.  “The situation is very grave in the whole euro area,” he
said. “We have to find solutions for everybody.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
