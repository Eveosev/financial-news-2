European Union President Herman  Van
Rompuy  said a coordinated approach is needed on bank
recapitalization and he is confident of getting an agreement
among EU leaders at a summit on Oct. 26.   “Everybody agrees we need a coordinated scheme to
recapitalize the banks and improve their funding,” Van Rompuy
said today in Brussels after a meeting of European heads of
state and government. “Yesterday, the finance ministers made
good progress on this issue. They will be able to finalize the
details next Wednesday.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
