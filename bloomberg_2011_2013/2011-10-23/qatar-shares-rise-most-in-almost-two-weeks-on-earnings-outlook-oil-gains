Qatar’s shares gained the most in
almost two weeks after  United Development Co. (UDCD)  said earnings more
than quadrupled and oil advanced for a third week.  United Development, the Qatari real-estate and energy
investor, headed for the biggest gain in more than seven years.
 Qatar Electricity & Water Co. (QEWS) , the Middle East’s second-biggest
utility by market value, rallied 4.6 percent before earnings
scheduled for later this week. Qatar’s  QE Index (DSM)  advanced 0.7
percent, the most since Oct. 12, to 8,422.82 at 11 a.m. in Doha.
The  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index (BGCC200)  climbed less than 0.1 percent.  Qatar’s “earnings are good, which has been good for medium
to long-term investors,” said Nabil Farhat, a partner at Abu
Dhabi-based Al Fajer Securities.  Qatar National Bank SAQ (QNBK) , the Persian Gulf country’s biggest
bank by assets, posted a 31 percent gain in third-quarter profit
on higher income from lending. Qatar, the host of the 2022
soccer  World Cup  and biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas,
expects economic growth of about 16 percent in 2011 and projects
a budget surplus of $6.1 billion this fiscal year.  United Development shares soared 10 percent to 20.91
riyals, poised for the biggest surge since July 2004. Nine-month
profit soared to 1.8 billion riyals ($494 million) from 443.6
million riyals a year earlier.  Earnings Outlook  Qatar Electricity shares rallied 4.6 percent, the most
since April 13, to 145.9 riyals. The utility may report a 16
percent increase in third-quarter earnings to 424 million riyals
on Oct. 27, according to the median estimate of three analysts
on Bloomberg.  Crude for November delivery rose 0.7 percent to $87.40 a
barrel last week. The contract has surged 10 percent the past
three weeks. Gulf Arab oil exporters, including the  Saudi Arabia 
and Qatar, supply about a fifth of the world’s oil.  The  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  dropped 0.2 percent. About 12 million
shares have traded in the emirate today, compared with this
year’s daily average of 108 million shares.  Abu Dhabi ’s  ADX
General Index (ADSMI)  was little changed.  “The U.A.E. markets are quiet as they await earning
disclosures by corporates,” Al Fajer’s Farhat said.  Oman’s gauge, Kuwait’s measure and Bahrain’s BB All Share
Index gained less than 0.1 percent. Saudi Arabia’s  Tadawul All
Share Index (SASEIDX)  was little changed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
