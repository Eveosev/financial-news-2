European Commission President  Jose Barroso  said the European Union is pushing for a reinforcement
of the  International Monetary Fund  to help ensure global
stability.  “We’ve seen that the crisis is really global; we want to
reinforce the IMF,” Barroso told reporters today in Brussels
after a meeting of EU leaders. “The IMF is the most important
global institution for financial matters, and so it’s natural
that countries that have a large external surplus can contribute
to the common good, to the global stability in financial
terms.”  Barroso said he and EU President  Herman Van Rompuy  will
discuss the issue at the Group of 20 meeting next month.  “The G-20 should ensure that the IMF has adequate
resources to fulfill its systemic responsibilities and should
explore possible contributions to the IMF from countries with a
large external surplus,” the leaders said in the conclusions of
today’s meeting.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
