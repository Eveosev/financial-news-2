Facebook Inc. (FB) , owner of the world’s
most popular social-networking service, will outline its
strategy for the Android mobile operating system on April 4,
part of its push to get more revenue from wireless devices.  The company is working with  HTC Corp. (2498) , which sells Android-
enabled devices, to develop a modified operating system for a
smartphone, people with knowledge of the matter said last year.  The press event will be held at the company’s headquarters
in Menlo Park,  California . The invitation to members of the
media said “Come See Our New Home on Android.”  Facebook, which derived about 23 percent of its ad revenue
from mobile in the fourth quarter, is stepping up efforts around
wireless devices, where users increasingly access the service.
While Chief Executive Officer  Mark Zuckerberg  has said Facebook
has no plans to build its own phone, he sees opportunity for
more integration with smartphones.  “I think people want it to be very integrated into all of
the different devices that they have and that’s what we’re going
to focus on,” Zuckerberg said  on a Jan. 30 call  with analysts.
“So, rather than just building an app that’s a version of the
functionality that you have today, I think making it so that we
can just do - go deeper and deeper I think is going to be a big
focus for us.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
