Ohio State University  defeated the
sixth-seeded  University of Arizona  73-70 to advance to the
regional finals in men’s college basketball’s national
championship.  The second-seeded Buckeyes rallied from an 11-point first-
half deficit against the Wildcats and will play the winner of
tonight’s game between ninth-seeded La Salle and No. 13 Wichita
State for a place in the Final Four of the National Collegiate
Athletic Association tournament.  After  Arizona  tied it at 70-70 with 21.8 seconds to play,
LaQuinton Ross hit the winning 3-pointer with two seconds to
play.  Also tonight, Indiana, the No. 1 seed in the East, will
play fourth-seeded Syracuse for the right to face Marquette in
the regional finals. Third seed Marquette beat second seed Miami
71-61 in tonight’s first game.  Tonight’s meeting between the Hoosiers and the Orange is
the first in the NCAA tournament since  Indiana  beat Syracuse in
the 1987 title game.  The Buckeyes reached the Final Four in 2012, their second
visit to the national semifinals in five years, and won their
only NCAA title in 1960.  Marquette advanced to the regional finals for the seventh
time. The Golden Eagles won the title in 1977, were runner-up
three years earlier, and have reached the Final Four three
times, most recently in 2003.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
