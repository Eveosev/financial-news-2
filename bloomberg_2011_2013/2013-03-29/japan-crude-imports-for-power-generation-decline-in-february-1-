Japanese crude  imports  for power
generation fell 30 percent in February as warmer weather curbed
demand for electricity to heat buildings.  Japan , the world’s third-largest oil consumer, bought 1.17
million kiloliters of the fuel for producing electricity,
equivalent to 262,000 barrels a day,  data  from the Ministry of
Economy, Trade and Industry showed today. That’s down from 1.67
million kiloliters a year earlier. Total purchases slid 11
percent to 15.85 million kiloliters, the report also showed.
 Power plants  accounted for 7.4 percent of imports.  Temperatures in Japan averaged 6.2 degrees Celsius (43
degrees Fahrenheit) last month, compared with 5.4 degrees in
February 2012,  according  to the  Japan Meteorological Agency .
Electricity generated and purchased by the country’s 10 regional
power companies declined 7.2 percent from a year earlier to 78.5
billion kilowatt-hours because of the warmer weather and energy
conservation measures by customers, the Federation of Electric
Power Companies  said  March 14.  Crude shipments from  Vietnam , which produces grades that
Japanese generators can burn, dropped 55 percent from a year
earlier to 175,984 kiloliters, today’s data showed.  Iran Imports  Oil-product imports rose 1.2 percent to 3.48 million
kiloliters in the month, while exports slid 19 percent to 1.27
million, the ministry said. Domestic oil-product sales fell 7
percent to 17.39 million kiloliters.  Japan’s oil purchases from Iran declined 32 percent from
February 2012 to 953,848 kiloliters. The Persian Gulf nation,
which is under international sanctions on its energy exports
because of its nuclear program, was Japan’s sixth-biggest
supplier after  Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates, Qatar,
 Russia  and Kuwait.  Statistics based on custom-clearance data yesterday by the
Ministry of Finance showed a 16 percent increase in crude
imports from Iran. Today’s trade ministry figures are based on
data collected from buyers via questionnaire and include fuel in
so-called bonded storage tanks that haven’t yet passed through
customs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
