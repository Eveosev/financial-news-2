Tony Romo  agreed to a six-year
contract extension with the National Football League’s Dallas
Cowboys that would guarantee the quarterback $55 million, ESPN
 reported .  The deal’s $108 million total makes Romo the highest-paid
player in Cowboys history, the  Walt Disney Co. (DIS)  unit reported,
citing people in the NFL it didn’t identify. Rich Dalrymple, a
Cowboys spokesman, didn’t immediately return an e-mail seeking
comment.  Romo was entering the final season of a six-year, $67
million deal that he signed in 2007 and due to earn an $11.5
million salary in 2013, ESPN said.  Romo’s guaranteed money is $3 million more then that
promised to Baltimore Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco, who signed
a six-year, $120.6 million contract after winning the Super Bowl
last season, ESPN said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
