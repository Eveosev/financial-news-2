Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  headed for a quarterly loss as the Chinese government
tightened credit and continued property-market curbs.  Futures for delivery in October dropped as much as 1.5
percent to 3,767 yuan ($607) a metric ton on the Shanghai
Futures Exchange and were at 3,825 yuan at 10:30 a.m. local time.
The most-active contract has lost 4.1 percent this quarter.  China aimed to implement unified property registration
rules from 2014, according to a statement on the central
government’s website yesterday. The move may be a precursor to a
property sales tax and adds to wider economic concerns after the
government also imposed restrictions on wealth-management
products, said Zheng Ge, an analyst at Wanda Futures Co.  “The rebar market suffered another round of worries on the
policy front,” Zheng said by phone from Beijing. “We think
prices might fall further as inventory remains high and rebar
won’t be able to stage a meaningful rebound without bullish
expectations for the macro-economy.”  The average spot  price  of rebar was little changed at 3,669
 yuan  a ton yesterday, according to Beijing Antaike Information
Development Co. Spot  iron ore  at Tianjin port was little changed
at $137.30 a dry ton yesterday, according to The Steel Index Ltd.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
