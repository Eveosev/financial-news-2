The stronger economies in the
northern region of the euro area should accept a pickup in
inflation as their southern partners try to emerge from the debt
crisis by cutting wages, according to an International Monetary
Fund staff study led by Chief Economist Olivier Blanchard.  “If it wants the South to adjust, the North must accept
more inflation, a point that has been emphasized by the IMF but
has not been always fully understood,” Blanchard and his co-
authors wrote in the study, which reviews IMF advice to advanced
economies facing high unemployment.  “To meet the 2 percent inflation target at the euro area
level, inflation must be lower than the target in the South and
higher than the target in the North.”  The main tool to spur employment in countries such as
 Greece  is to improve competitiveness, the report said. While
measures to boost productivity are the best way to address it,
they take time to show results, leaving these nations little
choice but to cut relative wages and prices, it said.  The euro area as a whole, with an average unemployment rate
of 11.9 percent in January, is suffering its second recession
since 2008. Still, the austerity demanded by policy makers in
exchange for aid amid three years of debt woes is starting to
deliver the competitiveness needed to restore economic growth,
with the so-called peripheral euro nations reviving
manufacturing and trade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
