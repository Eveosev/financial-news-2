Copper declined in  Shanghai , poised
for a second straight quarterly drop, as U.S. jobless claims
gained and stockpiles swelled. Aluminum, zinc and lead also fell.  Metal for delivery in July on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
fell as much as 1.1 percent to 54,720  yuan  ($8,812) a metric ton
and was at 55,250 yuan at 9:45 a.m. in Shanghai. The most-active
contract has lost 4.5 percent this year. The London Metal
Exchange and Comex are closed today for a public holiday.  LME copper  inventories  rose to 569,775 tons, surging 78
percent in the first quarter, according to exchange data
released yesterday. That was biggest jump since the third
quarter of 2005, data compiled by Bloomberg showed. First-time
filings for U.S. unemployment benefits rose to the highest in
more than a month, as  consumer confidence  slid to a six-week low,
reports showed yesterday.  “The huge inventory and lackluster seasonal boom in  China 
are weighing on copper,” Yang Lan, an analyst at Dayou Futures
Co., said by phone from Shanghai. “If the March PMI on Monday
confirms the improvement shown in the preliminary data, copper
may find support at the current level.”  China will release the Purchasing Managers’ Index for March
on April 1. A preliminary reading released on March 21 by HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics stood at 51.7, compared with a
final reading of 50.4 for February.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
