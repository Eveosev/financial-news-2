Three double-magnums of Chateau Petrus 1990 and a bottle of the same Bordeaux producer’s 1947 vintage set records at an Acker Merrall & Condit auction in  Hong Kong , where the top lot was 1988  Romanee-Conti  Burgundy.  The three double-magnums of Petrus 1990 sold for HK$590,400 ($76,000) at the two-day auction and the single bottle of 1947 fetched HK$118,080, according to an e-mail from Acker. The case of Romanee-Conti 1988 Domaine de la Romanee Conti went for HK$984,000, compared with HK$907,500 paid for each of two similar 12-bottle lots at  Christie’s International Plc (CHRS)  in June.  Wine prices have revived over the past four months after the London-based Liv-ex  Fine Wine 50 Index (LXFW50)  slumped in November to its lowest level since March 2010. It has rallied 10 percent since then, including 2.9 percent in February, and in January advanced 3.5 percent, its biggest monthly gain for two years.  “These things go in cycles,” Acker Chief Executive Officer  John Kapon  said in a telephone interview from  New York . “It’s good to see. It’s not like Bordeaux is ever going away.”  A case of Chateau Lafite-Rothschild 1982 sold for HK$442,800, about 8 percent more than the 34,500 pounds ($52,600) paid for a similar 12-bottle lot at a Christie’s sale in London in February.  The Acker sale totaled HK$38.25 million, while an auction held by  Hart Davis Hart Wine Co.  in  Chicago  focused on Burgundy to fetch $4.42 million.  The top lot at the Hart sale was a 1990 Domaine de la Romanee-Conti assortment, which fetched $41,825, while three bottles of Romanee-Conti 1999 DRC sold for $35,850.
