Confidence among U.S. consumers
unexpectedly increased in March from the prior month as
Americans grew more optimistic about the outlook for the
economy.  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan  sentiment index 
advanced to a four-month high of 78.6, exceeding all estimates
in a Bloomberg survey, from 77.6 in February. The median
forecast was 72.6 after a preliminary March reading of 71.8.  Americans are finding relief in lower gasoline prices, a
rally in the  stock market  and housing’s recovery, helping
alleviate concern about federal spending cuts. A report earlier
today showed household spending rose in February by the most in
five months as income growth picked up.  “We will start to see the consumer become a little more
engaged this summer and into the second half of the year,”
 Russell Price , senior economist at Ameriprise Financial Inc. in
 Detroit , said before the report. “We are going to see some
improvement in  consumer confidence  as we go forward and people
put concerns about the sequester behind them.”  Forecasts in the Bloomberg survey ranged from 70 to 75. The
index averaged 64.2 during the recession that ended in June
2009, and 89 in the five years prior to the 18-month slump.  Consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of
the economy, gained 0.7 percent after a 0.4 percent advance the
prior month that was bigger than previously estimated, according
to Commerce Department figures released earlier today. The
median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 78 economists called
for a 0.6 percent rise. Incomes increased 1.1 percent, more than
projected.  Current Conditions  The Michigan survey’s  current conditions  index, which
measures whether Americans think it’s a good time to make big
investments and gauges consumers’ view of their personal
finances, rose to 90.7 this month from 89 in February. The
preliminary reading was 87.5.  The index of  expectations  six months from now, which more
closely projects the direction of  consumer spending , advanced to
70.8 this month from 70.2 in February. The initial reading was
61.7, the lowest since November 2011.  Other measures of confidence have shown some deterioration.
Bloomberg’s Consumer Comfort Index dropped to a six-week low in
the latest period. The Conference Board survey of  confidence 
fell to 59.7 in March from 68 a month earlier, the New York-
based private research group said March 26.  Labor market progress, a pickup in property values and
cheaper gasoline are giving Americans the wherewithal to keep
spending. Payrolls rose by 236,000 workers in February and the
jobless rate dropped to a four-year low of 7.7 percent from 7.9
percent, Labor Department figures showed earlier this month.  Home Prices  A report this week showed home prices in 20 U.S. cities
jumped 8.1 percent in the 12 months ended in January, the
biggest year-over-year gain since June 2006. The S&P/Case-
Shiller  index  of property values climbed 1 percent from
December.  The average price of a gallon of  regular gasoline  is
hovering close to $3.65, down from a recent high of $3.79 on
Feb. 26, according to figures from AAA, the largest U.S.
motoring group.  At the same time, workers are paying higher payroll taxes.
The levy that funds  Social Security  reverted in January to its
2010 level of 6.2 percent from 4.2 percent. A person earning
$50,000 is taking home about $83 less a month as a result.  “We saw traffic counts weaken as we moved into February,
which was more challenging than the fourth quarter,” Russell C.
Hammer, chief financial officer at Brown Shoe Co. in  St. Louis ,
said on a March 15 earnings call. “Like our peers, we continue
to monitor consumer activity in the wake of tax rate changes, as
we settle into the sequester.”  Consumers in today’s confidence report said they expect an
inflation rate of 3.2 percent over the next 12 months, compared
with 3.3 percent in the prior two months. Over the next five
years, Americans expected a 2.8 percent rate of inflation, the
lowest in four months and down from 3 percent in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
