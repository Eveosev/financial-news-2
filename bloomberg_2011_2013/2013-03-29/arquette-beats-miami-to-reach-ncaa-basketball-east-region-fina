Marquette University beat the
second-seeded University of Miami 71-61 to reach the regional
finals in the men’s national college basketball championship.  The Golden Eagles, seeded third in the East region, will
meet the winner of tonight’s game between top-seeded  Indiana  and
No. 4 Syracuse for a place in the Final Four at the National
Collegiate Athletic Association tournament.  Also tonight, the finalists in the West region will be
decided. No. 2 Ohio State faces sixth-seeded  Arizona  and No. 9
Wichita State takes on No. 13 La Salle.  It’s the seventh time Marquette has advanced to the
regional finals of the NCAA tournament. It won the title in
1977, was runner-up three years earlier, and has reached the
Final Four three times, most recently in 2003.  Miami was seeking to reach the regional finals for the
first time after also losing in the round of 16 in 2000.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
