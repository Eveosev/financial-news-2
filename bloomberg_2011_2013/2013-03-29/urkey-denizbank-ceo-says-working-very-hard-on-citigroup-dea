Denizbank AS (DENIZ) , owned by Russia’s OAO
Sberbank, said its offer to acquire Citigroup Inc.’s retail unit
in  Turkey  will become clear next month, according to comments
made today by the Turkish bank’s chief executive officer.  Both sides are working “very hard” to sign the deal,
Denizbank CEO Hakan Ates told Turkey’s Anatolia News Agency
today. Buying just the retail unit is a more difficult process
than acquiring the entire Turkish operation, he said.  Citigroup said Dec. 5 it would sell or scale back consumer
operations in Turkey, Pakistan,  Romania , Uruguay and  Paraguay  as
the New York-based bank cuts costs under new CEO Michael Corbat.
It said commercial and corporate-banking services in Turkey will
continue. Citi’s Turkish unit will focus on commercial and
corporate banking, the unit said in an e-mailed statement.  Ates said he couldn’t disclose the price Denizbank offered.
 Citigroup (C) ’s retail unit in Turkey may be valued at about $270
million, a source familiar with the matter told Bloomberg on
March 26, asking not to be identified as talks are private.  “We’re trying very hard not to have any job losses during
the process,” Ates told Anatolia. The 1,600 staff employed in
Citi’s retail unit would be maintained, he said.  Denizbank confirmed it was in talks to buy Citi’s Turkish
retail operations in a statement to the Istanbul Stock Exchange
on March 11. Denizbank shares gained 0.5 percent to 10.75 liras
($5.9) at 11:40 a.m. in Istanbul today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
