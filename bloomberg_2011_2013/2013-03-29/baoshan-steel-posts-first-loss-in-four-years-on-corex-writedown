Baoshan Iron & Steel Co. (600019) , China’s
biggest publicly traded steelmaker, posted its first quarterly
loss in four years after a 2.65 billion- yuan  ($427 million)
writedown for its suspended Corex plant.  The company’s net loss was 0.4 billion yuan in the three
months ended Dec. 31, compared with a profit of 1.04 billion
yuan a year earlier. The result was derived by deducting nine-
month figures from full-year earnings released today in a
statement. The loss was the first since the fourth quarter of
2008, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  Baoshan Steel in September halted a plant, including two
money-losing Corex technology facilities with a combined annual
capacity of 3 million tons on the outskirts of Shanghai. It
plans to move part of the assets to a new project in the
southern port of Zhanjiang and to set aside provisions for the
impairment of fixed assets.  China’s economy  rebounded  in the fourth quarter, with 7.9
percent growth in gross domestic product, from 7.4 percent in
the previous quarter, the worst in three years. The country’s
new leadership is focusing on urbanization, helping boost steel
demand and prices.  Baoshan closed unchanged at 4.73 yuan today in Shanghai
before the earnings announcement. The benchmark Shanghai
Composite Index gained less than 0.1 percent.  Asset Sales  The company’s full-year profit gained 41.1 percent to 10.4
billion yuan in 2012 after it sold stainless-steel and
specialty-steel units to its parent, Baoshan Steel said in the
statement. The result compares with 10.3 billion yuan of net
income in preliminary figures announced Jan. 9.  Corex technology enables manufacturers to make steel from
iron-ore pellets and unprocessed or non-coking coal, which is at
least 30 percent cheaper than regular coking coal. Baoshan
announced the asset writedown in the Jan. 9 statement.  China’s apparent consumption of steel, which includes
production and net imports, may rise 4.6 percent to 708.8
million metric tons in 2013, because of the nation’s spending on
railways and higher car sales, according to the mean estimate of
six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News this month. That’s
faster than 2012, when demand grew by 2.9 percent to 677.8
million tons.  The strongest start to passenger car sales in China since
2010 is also helping Baoshan Steel, which has half the domestic
market for automotive steel. Passenger-vehicle sales rose 20
percent to 2.84 million units in January and February from a
year ago, according to the China Association of Automobile
Manufacturers.  Baoshan on March 8 raised prices of hot-rolled and cold-
rolled steel products to the highest since June.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
