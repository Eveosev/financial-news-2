Fred Davis re-signed with the
National Football League’s Washington Redskins after missing
most of last season with an injured Achilles tendon.  The terms of the deal weren’t disclosed in  an announcement 
on the team’s website. The  Washington Post (WPO)   reported  Davis signed
for one year after visiting the Buffalo Bills and canceling a
trip to the  New York  Jets.  The 27-year-old tight end has spent his first five seasons
with Washington after being selected in the second round of the
2008 draft. Davis had 24 receptions for 325 yards in seven games
last season before the injury.  To contact the reporter on this story:
