BlackBerry is planning to offer
products for mid- and lower-income markets using its new
BlackBerry 10 operating system, the Canadian Press reported.  The phones would include keyboard and touch-screen models
in each category, expanding beyond the high-end Z10 and Q10
models it has already announced, the wire service said today,
citing an interview with Chief Executive Officer Thorsten Heins.  While lower-priced models using BlackBerry 10 would be
designed for markets such as India and  Indonesia , other
countries will still get new models using the earlier BlackBerry
7 system, the wire service said. The plan will help the Canadian
smartphone maker compete against Apple Inc. and Samsung
Electronics Co. as they develop products for similar markets,
the report said.  Heins also said he was skeptical of the idea of selling
BlackBerry’s hardware business to become only a service
provider, according to the Canadian Press. “BlackBerry is an
end-to-end solution,” he told the wire service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
