Palm oil declined, capping a fourth
quarterly loss in the worst run since 1999, on concern that
demand will slow as  Europe ’s debt crisis lingers, boosting
inventories in producing nations.  The contract for delivery in June fell 1.4 percent to 2,378
ringgit ($769) a metric ton on the  Malaysia  Derivatives
Exchange, the lowest settlement level for the most-active price
since March 14. Futures declined 2.5 percent since the beginning
of the year, the fourth straight quarterly loss in the worst
streak since 1999.  Shipments to European Union countries by Malaysia tumbled
18 percent in the first 25 days of March to 155,870 tons from a
month earlier, according to Societe Generale de Surveillance.
Total exports fell 7 percent to 1.1 million tons, it said March
25. Europe is the largest buyer of palm after India and  China ,
U.S. Department of Agriculture data show. The region’s economy
will contract for a second straight year in 2013, according to
the median of analysts’ forecasts compiled by Bloomberg.  “Driving prices down is an expectation that exports from
Malaysia will continue to decline,” said Arhnue Tan, vice
president at Alliance Research Sdn. “That may lead to high
inventory levels.”  Palm oil has tumbled 31 percent over the past year as
supplies from Indonesia and Malaysia, the largest producers,
expanded to a record and demand fell in Europe. Stockpiles in
Malaysia reached an all-time high in December.  Refined palm oil for September delivery fell 0.8 percent to
close at 6,246 yuan ($1,006) a ton on the Dalian Commodity
Exchange. Soybean oil for delivery in the same month lost 1.3
percent to end at 7,932  yuan  a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
