Great Wall Motor Co. (2333) , which posted
record profit last year, said it will set up Haval as a stand-
alone sport-utility vehicle brand to enhance its image and
better compete with marques such as Jeep and Land Rover.  Great Wall will separate the sales outlets for Haval from
those of its other brands. The automaker, based in Baoding in
China’s northern Hebei province, has sold more than 1 million
Haval SUVs in over 100 countries as of March 25, the company
said.  “We actually want to be the top SUV model in the world,”
Chairman Wei Jianjun said in Beijing today. “We want to
outperform other local brands and catch up with foreign brands
in terms of ability to charge premiums.”  Great Wall will focus on developing the Haval H series SUV
and higher end models after the spinoff and develop Haval into a
“professional SUV brand,” Wei said.  SUVs were the fastest-growing vehicle segment in China last
year, as consumers opted for more space than conventional sedans
offer. That helped Great Wall boost net income last year by 66
percent and more than double its share price.  The separation of the networks will take two to three
years, while the company plans to add the H9 SUV next year, Wei
said.  Great Wall said this week it plans to invest 10 billion
baht ($342 million) to open a factory in Thailand to produce
100,000 vehicles a year.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
