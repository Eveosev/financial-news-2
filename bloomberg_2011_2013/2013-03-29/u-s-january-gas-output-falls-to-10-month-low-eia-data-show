U.S. natural gas production in the
lower 48 states fell in January to the lowest level since March
2012 as gas-plant maintenance and frigid weather hampered
output, a government report today showed.  Production in the lower 48 states slid 0.9 percent to 72.1
billion cubic feet a day from a revised 72.77 billion in
December, the Energy Department’s Energy Information
Administration said in the monthly  EIA-914 report . Output was
down 0.8 percent in January from a year earlier.  Total U.S. output, including  Alaska , declined 0.8 percent
to 82 billion cubic feet a day in January from a revised 82.64
billion the previous month, the report showed. Production was
down 1.2 percent from January 2012.  “Louisiana had the largest decrease,” because of gas
plant maintenance, the EIA said in the report.  New Mexico  and
 Wyoming  slid because cold weather shut some production. “Other
states showed an increase of 0.5 percent, or 0.13 billion cubic
feet a day, as new wells continued to come online in the
Marcellus shale play.”  Louisiana output declined 3.8 percent to 7.18 billion cubic
feet a day in January and supplies in  Texas , the biggest
producing state, dropped 0.3 percent to 21.8 billion cubic feet
a day. Daily output in the Gulf of  Mexico  slid 2.4 percent to
4.08 billion cubic feet.  Supplies from the “other states” category, which includes
the Marcellus shale deposit in the Northeast, advanced 0.5
percent to 24.32 billion cubic feet a day from 24.19 billion in
December. Production in January was a record in government data
going back to 2005.  Oklahoma Decline  Oklahoma output grew by 0.4 percent to 5.71 billion cubic
feet a day while production in Wyoming dropped 3.2 percent to
5.73 billion.  Natural gas futures for May delivery fell 4.4 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $4.024 per million British thermal units yesterday
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The fuel gained 20 percent
in the first quarter. Markets are closed today for Good Friday.  The EIA-914 report covers gross withdrawals, which include
gas used for repressuring, quantities vented and flared, and
non-hydrocarbon gas removed in treating or processing
operations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
