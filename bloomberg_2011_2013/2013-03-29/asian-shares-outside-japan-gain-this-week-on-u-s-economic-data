Asian shares outside Japan
rebounded this week as U.S. economic reports showed signs of
recovery in the world’s biggest economy, even as concern mounted
that  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis is worsening.  James Hardie Industries SE (JHX) , a supplier of building
materials that counts the U.S. as its biggest market, advanced
2.8 percent in Sydney. Wharf Holdings Ltd., the developer
controlled by the family of billionaire Peter Woo, surged 9.8
percent in Hong Kong after underlying profit beat estimates.
Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s biggest carmaker, slid 0.4
percent in  Tokyo  as the yen gained against the dollar and euro.
GS Yuasa Corp. tumbled 9.2 percent after its batteries caught
fire in a Mitsubishi Motors Corp. factory and another melted in
an electric car.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 0.9 percent to 135.56
this week, capping a 4.8 percent gain for the quarter. The
measure’s third consecutive quarterly advance is its longest
such winning streak since March 2010. The gauge rallied this
year as improving economic data from the U.S. and speculation
that Japan will deploy more stimulus countered concern China
will move to cool its  property market .  “Average U.S. investors feel more secure about their jobs,
seeing their  house prices  go up, and think the crisis is well
behind them,” said  Andrew Pease , Sydney-based chief strategist
at Russell Investment Group, which oversees about $160 billion.
“We like  emerging markets  and Asia simply because, even though
there’s concern about Chinese policy tightening, earnings
numbers still look good.”  Relative Value  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index trades at 15 times average
estimated earnings, compared with 14.2 for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index and 12.6 for the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP) , according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Topix Index, Japan’s broadest share gauge, slid 0.4
percent this week. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average gained 0.5
percent to cap its best back-to-back quarterly performance since
1972. China’s Shanghai Composite Index slumped 3.9 percent.
 Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 was little changed. South Korea’s Kospi
Index advanced 2.9 percent, while Taiwan’s Taiex Index gained
1.6 percent.  Hong Kong ’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  climbed 0.8 percent, paring its
first quarterly loss since June. The gauge dropped 1.6 percent
this year.  Markets in Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and
India were closed yesterday for a holiday. Hong Kong, New
Zealand and Australia will reopen on April 2.  Property Values  Stocks rose after residential real estate prices increased
in January by the most since June 2006, according to the
S&P/Case-Shiller index on March 26. Orders for durable goods
climbed more than forecast in February, propelled by automobiles
and a rebound in commercial aircraft, a Commerce Department
report showed. The  S&P 500  rose to a record, wiping out losses
from the financial crisis.  James Hardie , which gets almost 70 percent of its sales in
the U.S., advanced 2.8 percent to A$10.01. Samsung Electronics
Co., a South Korean consumer-electronics exporter that counts
the Americas as its biggest market, gained 5 percent to 1.527
million won in Seoul.  Techtronic Industries Co. (669) , a maker of
power tools that relies on North America for 72 percent of
revenue, increased 2.6 percent to HK$18.90 in Hong Kong.  Shares in Hong Kong gained this week during the busiest
week for earnings, with about 240 companies reporting. About
half of the firms on the Hang Seng Composite Index that reported
earnings since Jan. 1, and for which Bloomberg has estimates,
exceeded analysts’ forecasts, according to  data  compiled by
Bloomberg.  Wharf, Shimao  Wharf Holdings (4) , Hong Kong’s third-biggest developer, surged
9.8 percent to HK$69.20. The company reversed losses, reporting
underlying profits for the fiscal year of HK$11 billion, beating
the HK$10.7 billion estimated by 17 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Shimao Property Holdings Ltd., controlled by billionaire
Hui Wing Mao, jumped 8.8 percent to HK$14.90, after boosting its
sales target 19 percent to 55 billion  yuan .  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (386) , Asia’s biggest refiner,
gained 4.5 percent to HK$9.14 in Hong Kong. The energy company
reported net income of 63.9 billion yuan ($10.3 billion), more
than the 61.8 billion yuan mean of 26 analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  “The U.S. is experiencing the best scenario in that its
economy is going strong while risk remains for the rest of the
world, namely Europe,” said Koji Toda, chief  fund manager  at
Resona Bank Ltd. in Tokyo, which oversees about 15 trillion yen
($158 billion).  Europe Concern  Concern Europe’s debt crisis is deepening grew even after
European finance officials agreed on a bailout for Cyprus as
Italy fails to end a political deadlock.  HSBC Holdings Plc (5) , Europe’s biggest lender, sank 1.3
percent to HK$82. Esprit Holdings Ltd., a clothier that gets
about 80 percent of sales from Europe, dropped 1.4 percent to
HK$9.34. Nippon Sheet Glass Co., a Japanese glassmaker that
counts Europe as its biggest market, slid 2.8 percent to 106 yen.  European governments and the  International Monetary Fund 
agreed Monday to lend Cyprus 10 billion euros ($13 billion) as
long as the country liquidated its second-largest bank and
forced losses on bank bondholders and deposits of more than
100,000 euros. Concern spread that the agreement lowers the
barrier for deposits being used to fund bailouts elsewhere.  Italian 10-year government bond yields jumped 21 basis
points on March 27 as Italy’s Democratic Party leader Pier Luigi
Bersani said there was no chance of a broad coalition.  Japan Exporters  Japanese exporters declined after the yen strengthened 0.3
percent this week against the dollar. A stronger yen trims the
overseas earnings of Japanese exporters when repatriated.  Toyota fell 0.4 percent to 4,860 yen. Honda Motor Co., an
automaker that gets about 80 percent of its sales outside of
Japan, fell 2.6 percent to 3,555 yen. Canon Inc., the world’s
biggest camera maker, lost 2.9 percent to 3,400 yen.  Among other stocks that fell, GS Yuasa dropped 9.2 percent
to 381 yen. One of the company’s lithium-ion batteries caught
fire while being tested at a Mitsubishi Motors factory in Japan
last week and another melted in an electric car. The incidents
are the latest involving the Kyoto-based maker as U.S. and
Japanese authorities probe the cause of overheated batteries
that grounded Boeing Co.’s 787 Dreamliners in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
