Ukraine swung to a state budget
deficit in the first two months of the year as spending rose,
according to the  Finance Ministry .  The fiscal gap of 2.3 billion hryvnia ($283 million)
compares with a surplus of 4.7 billion hryvnia in the same
period a year ago, the Kiev-based ministry said in a statement
on its  website  today.  Ukraine raised 21.6 million hryvnia in January-February by
selling state assets, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
