Pittsburgh defeated the Winnipeg Jets 4-0 for their 14th
straight National Hockey League victory, three off the league
record for consecutive wins set by the 1992-93 Penguins.  Chris Kunitz  and Evgeni Malkin added goals for the Penguins
(27-8). Malkin, who returned last night after being sidelined
for nine games with an upper-body injury, got his first goal in
three weeks.  Tomas Vokoun had 20 saves at Pittsburgh’s Consol Energy
Center for his 50th career shutout. Winnipeg is 18-15-2 this
season.  A Pittsburgh team led by  Mario Lemieux , now the franchise’s
owner, set the mark of 17 consecutive wins 20 seasons ago. The
current Penguins squad could tie that mark on April 3 at the  New
York  Rangers and break it two days later at home against the
Rangers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
