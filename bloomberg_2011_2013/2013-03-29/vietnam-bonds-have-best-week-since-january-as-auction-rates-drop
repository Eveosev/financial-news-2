Vietnam’s bonds completed the best
week since January, pushing the benchmark five-year yield down
to the lowest level since 2009, after the government sold debt
at lower  interest rates . The dong was little changed.  The State Treasury sold 3 trillion dong ($143 million) of
five-year notes at 8.45 percent yesterday and 3 trillion dong of
three-year securities at 7.84 percent, according to the Hanoi
Stock Exchange website. Those rates compared with 8.84 percent
and 8.18 percent, respectively, at the previous auctions of
those tenors.  The five-year yield this week slumped 50 basis points, or
0.50 percentage point, the biggest weekly decline since Jan. 18,
to 8.50 percent, the lowest level since Feb. 13, 2009, according
to a daily fixing from lenders compiled by Bloomberg. The rate
on  three-year  securities dropped 33 basis points to 7.89
percent, the lowest level since Nov. 12, 2007.  “The robust state of the  bond market  this week might be
attributable to the ongoing downward tendency” of auction
yields and ample liquidity in the banking system, Pham Thuy Linh
and Trinh Quang Dung, analysts at Hanoi-based Vietcombank
Securities Co., wrote in a research note yesterday.  The dong traded at 20,940 per dollar as of 4:30 p.m. in
Hanoi, from 20,945 yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
The  State Bank  of Vietnam set its  reference rate  at 20,828,
unchanged since December 2011, according to its website. The
currency is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either side
of the daily fixing.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
