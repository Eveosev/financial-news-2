Gibson Guitar Corp., maker of
instruments played by Led Zeppelin’s Jimmy Page and  Green Day ’s
Billie Joe Armstrong, agreed to buy control of  Teac Corp. (6803) ,
saying the deal allows the company to tap into Japanese cool.  The closely held guitar maker will pay 31 yen a share for
54.4 percent stake held by funds operated by Phoenix Capital
Co., Nashville, Tennessee-based Gibson said in an e-mailed
statement today. The deal values the stake at 4.9 billion yen
($52 million).  The acquisition gives Gibson high-end audio equipment, data
storage and sound recorders and adds to its brands that include
Wurlitzer jukeboxes. The deal is the largest purchase of a
Japanese company announced by a U.S.-based firm this year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The acquisition will allow “us to move the industry
forward,” Gibson Chief Executive Officer Henry Juszkiewicz told
reporters in  Tokyo , surrounded by a dozen guitars. “The vision
that we have is to create a new lifestyle with music and
sound.”  Teac sales slumped 28 percent in the year ended March 31,
2012, the 11th straight year of decline. The company cut its
sales outlook for this fiscal year on March 22 to 22.2 billion
yen, compared with 26.7 billion yen a year earlier.  The purchase also adds Cool  Japan  “technology and
innovation”  for Gibson, according to the statement. Cool Japan
refers to the creative industries and culture from food to manga
comics and fashion in the world’s third-largest economy.  To contact the reporters on this story:
