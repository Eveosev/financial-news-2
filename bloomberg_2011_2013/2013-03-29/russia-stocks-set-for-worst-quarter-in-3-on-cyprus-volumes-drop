Russian  shares  were poised for the
worst quarter in nine months on concern Cyprus’s debt crisis may
wipe out as much as $60 billion in Russian deposits and loans.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  added less than 0.1 percent to 1,435.21 by
3:43 p.m. in Moscow, paring its retreat this quarter to 2.7
percent. The dollar-denominated  RTS Index (RTSI$)  increased 0.2 percent
to 1,456.90. Trading volumes on the Micex were 64 percent below
the 30-day average and 10-day  price swings  slumped to 12.278.  Cyprus’s banks opened their doors to customers yesterday
for the first time in almost two weeks, with new rules curbing
access to cash. The Central Bank of Cyprus’s capital controls
will include a 300-euro ($383) daily limit on withdrawals and
restrictions on transfers to accounts outside the country. Most
markets were shut in Asia, Europe and Latin America for
holidays.  “We expect the Russian market to continue falling next
quarter,” Andrey Vashevnik, who manages $25 million as chief
investment officer at R&B Investment Fund Ltd. in Moscow, said
by phone from Moscow. “Cyprus spoiled the market’s mood this
quarter, deposits turned out to not be a safe investment.
Investors are in a bad mood, capital flight continues.”  Russian equity funds posted $235 million in outflows in the
week ended March 27, the most since September 2011, UralSib
Capital said in a note today, citing EPFR Global data.  Raspadskaya Dividend  Russian lenders and companies had about $31 billion in
Cypriot banks by the end of 2012, according to a report by
Moody’s Investors Service this month, while another $29 billion
has been given in loans to Cypriot firms with origins in Russia.
The benchmark Micex Index last week recorded its steepest
decline since May following a proposal to tax savings accounts
to secure a 10-billion euro bailout from the euro area.  OAO Raspadskaya, a coal producer, fell 1.5 percent to 58.79
rubles. The company said it doesn’t plan dividends for 2012. The
OAO Alrosa diamond producer surged 3.8 percent 32.15 rubles.  Russian equities have the cheapest valuations among 21
 emerging markets  tracked by Bloomberg. The Micex trades at 5.3
times estimated earnings. That compares with a multiple of 10.8
times for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, which has slid 2
percent this year.  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the largest dedicated
Russian exchange-traded fund, jumped 1 percent to $27.75
yesterday in New York. The RTS Volatility Index, which measures
expected swings in the stock futures, fell 5.1 percent to 17.46
today. The  Bloomberg-Russia gauge  added 0.2 percent to 97.38
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
