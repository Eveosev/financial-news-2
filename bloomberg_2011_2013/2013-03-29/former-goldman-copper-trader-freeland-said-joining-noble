David Freeland, previously a copper
trader at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., is joining  Noble Group Ltd. (NOBL) ,
Asia’s biggest commodity trader by sales, according to two
people with direct knowledge.  Freeland will be a copper trader based in London and will
join in April, said the people, who asked not to be identified
because the information hasn’t been made public. He will be
responsible for building up the company’s physical copper
business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Freeland worked
for Trafigura Beheer BV before joining Goldman.  Calls to  Stephen Brown , Noble’s director of corporate
affairs, and his two deputies weren’t answered, and he didn’t
immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment. The company’s
office in Hong Kong was closed for a public holiday.  Noble’s physical and derivatives metals trading are managed
by  Mark Hansen , who joined in June. The company hired Paul
Wilkes, formerly the head of industrial metals at Macquarie
Group Ltd., last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
