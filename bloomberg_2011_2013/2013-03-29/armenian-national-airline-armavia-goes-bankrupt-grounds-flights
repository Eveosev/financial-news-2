Armenian businessmen Mikayel
Baghdasarov’s Armavia, the country’s only carrier, declared
bankruptcy today and will cease flights starting April 1.  The company founded in 1996 was unable to pay debt
accumulated to the Zvartnots airport in Yerevan,  Armenia ’s
capital, and to its contractors, Armavia said in an e-mailed
statement today. The total debt was less than $50 million,
Baghdasarov told the Arminfo news service on March 15.  Europe ’s debt crisis has curbed travel and made governments
reluctant to prop up airlines amid the region’s deepest cost
cuts in a generation. Hungary’s Malev folded in February 2012,
while LOT Polish Airlines SA last week said it needs a
“painful” cost-cutting program to stay afloat. Aerosvit,
Ukraine’s biggest private airline, entered bankruptcy in
December.  Armavia’s owners have been diverting funds from other
businesses to fund the airline in the past three years, the
company said in its statement.  Armavia has 14 aircraft and was the first operator of
Sukhoi’s Superjet 100.  To contact the reporter on this story:
