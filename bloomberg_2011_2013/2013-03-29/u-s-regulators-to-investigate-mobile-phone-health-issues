Federal regulators today began an
inquiry into whether U.S. standards need to be updated to
protect people from mobile-phone radiation.  The Federal Communications Commission announced the
proceeding in an e-mail. The agency last reviewed standards in
1996, when fewer mobile phones were in use.  The FCC last June said it intended to begin the inquiry
announced today, and called the pending action a routine review.
Its  guidelines  set maximum radiation exposure levels based on
the amount of heat emitted by mobile phones.  There have been concerns that energy from phones held close
to the head may affect the brain and other tissues,  according to 
the  National Cancer Institute , part of the U.S. government’s
National Institutes of Health. The cancer institute said on its
website that studies of cells, animals and humans haven’t
produced evidence that radio energy can cause cancer.  The number of mobile phone calls per day, the length of
each call and the amount of time people use the phones have
increased, and phone technology has also undergone substantial
changes, the cancer institute said.  About 44 million people in the U.S. had mobile phones in
1996, according to FCC  figures . There were 332 million wireless
subscriber  connections  in 2011, according to CTIA-The Wireless
Association, a Washington-based trade group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
