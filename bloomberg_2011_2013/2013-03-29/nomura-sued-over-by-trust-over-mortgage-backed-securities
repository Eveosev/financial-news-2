Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) ,  Japan ’s
largest brokerage, was sued by a trust over an alleged breach of
contract involving $1.14 billion of mortgage-backed securities.  HSBC Bank USA, National Association, acting as trustee,
filed the suit in state Supreme Court in Manhattan yesterday,
accusing Nomura Credit & Capital Inc. of failing to comply with
obligations associated with 5,292 residential mortgages it
purchased and sold to the trust.  The trust said in a filing that it has suffered more than
$486 million in losses on the securities and will continue to
suffer damages because Nomura hasn’t complied with obligations
to furnish missing documentation and files for defective loans.  At least 1,448 of the loans don’t conform with information
provided by Nomura about their characteristics, such as
underwriting standards used at origination and information
provided to ratings agencies, the trust said in the filing.  Jonathan Hodgkinson, a spokesman for Nomura in New York,
said in an e-mail that the firm doesn’t comment on active legal
proceedings.  The case is Nomura Home Equity Loan Inc., Home Equity Loan
trust, Series 2007-3, v Nomura Credit & Capital Inc.,
651124/2013, New York State Supreme Court ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
