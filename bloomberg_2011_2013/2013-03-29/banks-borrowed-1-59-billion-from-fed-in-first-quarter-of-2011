The  Federal Reserve  said banks
ranging from El Dorado Savings Bank of Placerville,  California ,
to Denali State Bank of Fairbanks, Alaska, were among borrowers
from its discount window in the first quarter of 2011.  The Fed made more than 550  loans  to banks across the
country during the period, all of which were repaid, according
to data released today on its website. The central bank listed a
total of $1.59 billion in loans for an average amount of $2.83
million.  The discount window is the Fed’s main tool for providing
cash to banks that have temporary funding shortfalls. The loans
are fully collateralized and made by the system’s 12 reserve
banks. The discount  rate  has been at 0.75 percent since February
2010. The Fed releases the once-secret data with a two-year lag
every quarter as required by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act.  The transactions occurred a year and a half after the
longest recession since the Great Depression ended in June 2009.
The recovery faltered in that quarter as the economy grew at an
annualized rate of 0.1 percent after expanding more than 2
percent in each quarter of 2010. Growth accelerated again in the
second quarter of 2011 to a 2.5 percent pace.  The largest loan was $51 million on Jan. 28, 2011, to
Republic Bank of  Chicago , which was repaid by the  Oak Brook ,
Illinois-based firm three days later, the data show. The company
borrowed $276 million in 10 separate loans during the quarter,
according to the Fed report.  Republic, which has 16 offices around Chicago and about
$1.4 billion in assets, borrowed the money as it was expanding
into a new line of business servicing check-cashing firms with
operations from New York to  Florida , Chief Executive Officer
William Sperling said in a phone interview today.  ‘Better Safe’  “A lot of them are big chains,” Sperling said. “We
didn’t want to disappoint our customers, and we didn’t need as
much as we borrowed, but better safe than sorry.”  About half of the discount window loans reported by the Fed
were for amounts of less than $1 million, the data show.
Borrowers of those smaller amounts included First Bank Financial
Centre of Oconomowoc,  Wisconsin , and Farmers and Merchants  State
Bank  of Blooming Prairie,  Minnesota .  To contact the reporter on this story:
