The board of Mongolia’s Oyu Tolgoi
copper and gold mine agreed to continue funding the project
through April, Mining Minister Davaajav Gankhuyag said in a
mobile-phone text message.  The mine, 66 percent-owned by  Rio Tinto Group (RIO)  and 34
percent-owned by the Mongolian government, is operating on a
month-to-month budget and requires approval from the board of
directors. International investors currently cash fund the
entire project.  Puntsag Tsagaan, an Oyu Tolgoi board member, said earlier
this month that Mongolia won’t approve the budget for the entire
year until the company produces a feasibility study for phase
two of the project.  Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd. (TRQ) , the  Rio Tinto  unit that
controls the mine, says a phase-two feasibility study won’t be
available until 2014. Costs for phase one of the project totaled
$6.6 billion. A 2013 Oyu Tolgoi technical report estimates phase
two costs could reach $5.1 billion.  Rio Tinto and the Mongolian government are in talks to
remedy several disputes around the project, including alleged
cost overruns and management control. Three emergency
shareholder meetings have been held this year. A date for the
next shareholder meeting hasn’t been set.  To contact the reporter on this story:
