Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY) 
gained, capping its best back-to-back quarterly performance
since 1972, when “The Godfather” hit the screens and Atari
Inc. introduced its “Pong” video game.  The Nikkei 225 rose 0.5 percent to 12,397.91 in  Tokyo  today
on optimism Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and policy makers will
stimulate the economy. The measure added 19 percent this
quarter, extending the 17 percent gain in the previous three
months. That’s the best two-quarter advance since the period
ended December 1972, when the measure rose 37 percent. The
broader  Topix Index (TPX)  fell 0.2 percent to 1,034.71 today.  “It was like we had a big pile of dry hay, and Abe came in
and lit up a bonfire,” said Ichiro Takamatsu, who helps manage
150 billion yen ($1.6 billion) at Tokyo-based Bayview Asset
Management Co.  Bank of  Japan  Governor Haruhiko Kuroda will helm his first
central bank meeting next week. The former Asian Development
Bank president pledged yesterday to continue easing until a 2
percent inflation target is reached, in a sign he wants the
central bank to strengthen its commitment to ending deflation.  In the last six months of 1972, the Nikkei 225 surged 37
percent to close at 5,207.94. That was the year “The
Godfather,” starring  Marlon Brando  and  Al Pacino , was released
and went on to win three Oscars. Atari started selling millions
of its game consoles featuring “Pong,” and Japan hosted the
Winter  Olympic Games  in Sapporo.  “The economic and stock market environment in 1972 and now
are very similar,” said  Kenichi Hirano , a general manager and
technical analyst at Tachibana Securities Co. in Tokyo. “Stocks
have been rising for eight straight months and I think gains are
going to continue.”  Abe’s Change  Japanese stocks have rallied since Nov. 14, when elections
were announced that brought Abe to power on a platform of
increased stimulus and central bank easing.  Stocks on the Topix Index trade at 21.37 times estimated
earnings now, compared with 19.21 in December 1972, according to
data from Daiwa Institute of Research Holdings Ltd. Book value
is 1.21 now, compared with 2.88 in 1972, the data show.  The new government unveiled a 10.3 trillion yen spending
plan in January, and Abe convinced the  Bank of Japan (8301)  to double
its inflation target. Expectations that Abe can force the BOJ to
bring forward plans for unlimited asset purchases have helped
send the yen plunging 17 percent against the dollar since
November, boosting the overseas earnings outlook for the
nation’s exporters.  The Topix has risen 20 percent this quarter, extending last
quarter’s 17 percent gain. That’s the gauge’s best two
consecutive quarters since December 2005. Brokerages have posted
the biggest advance on the Topix since mid-November, boosted by
the recent stocks rally. All the Topix’s 33 industry groups have
risen in that period.  ‘Major Adjustment’  “Japanese stocks have simply gone through a major
adjustment, catching up with overseas stocks as government
policy and the yen changed direction,” said Isao Kubo, a Tokyo-
based equity strategist at Nissay Asset Management Corp., which
oversees about 5 trillion yen ($53 billion). “The adjustment
isn’t over yet and stocks may extend gains a bit more as we see
new policy content.”  In today’s trading, Mitsui Mining & Smelting Co., Japan’s
biggest zinc refiner, surged 11 percent, the biggest gain on the
Nikkei 225, after its equity rating was raised at Mitsubishi UFJ
Morgan Stanley. Oki Electric Industry Co., which makes
communication equipment, jumped 8.3 percent after disclosing
plans to cut costs by as much as 3 billion yen a year by
eliminating as many as 800 jobs.  Solar Tariffs  Electricity producers rose today after Japan gave its final
approval to cut tariffs on solar power. Tokyo Electric Power Co.
jumped 9.9 percent. Kansai Electric Power Co. and  Hokkaido
Electric Power Co. (9509)  climbed at least 3.4 percent.  Japan approved a recommendation to cut the tariff on solar
power by 10 percent for the fiscal year starting April 1 for 20
years, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said. The
reduction marks the first rate change since the country started
an incentive program for clean energy in July.  Among stocks that fell,  Panasonic Corp. (6752) , the maker of Viera
televisions, tumbled 7.1 percent, the biggest drop on the Nikkei
225, after its president said the company will keep its loss-
making plasma TV business.  Volume on the Nikkei 225 was 19 percent lower than its 30-
day average today. Markets in  Hong Kong ,  Australia ,  New Zealand ,
 Singapore  and  India  were shut for a holiday.  The Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index fell 2.9 percent
to 25.67 today, indicating traders expect a swing of about 7.4
percent on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporters on this story:
