Some people clip coupons and shop sales. Others wait until July to buy furniture and October to buy a new lawnmower because that's when they can get the best deals. And then there are those to whom money is no object. For the big spenders in our midst (and those who occasionally dream of a Donald Trump-like lifestyle), here are a few of the more luxurious home-related items we've seen of late: Reading by the fire is downright glamorous when the flames are burning in the LHD50SS Limited Edition Fireplace by  Napoleon . The gas  fireplace  is available as a one-sided or two-sided unit and comes standard with polished chrome trim. What makes this unit a real standout is the fact that its ember bed is filled with precision-cut crystals from Swarovski. The elegant fireplace has a "necklace tray" design that keeps the crystals perfectly displayed. The "Made With CRYSTALLIZED™ Swarovski Elements" logo is finely etched into the fireplace glass, and the unit comes with a certificate of authenticity. "The fireplace is like no other fireplace on the market," said David Coulson, national advertising manager with Napoleon Fireplaces & Grills. "This fireplace is evidence of Napoleon and Swarovski's shared passion for cutting-edge technology,  contemporary design  and artistic craftsmanship." The glimmering fireplace retails for approximately $10,500. If your cooking skills are limited to cuisine that comes out of a box or can, this stove isn't for you. But if you're a true foodie with cash to spare, you might take a look at  Electrolux's Molteni range cooker. The Molteni can be made-to-order and comes in all shapes and colors. Customers can choose an electric solid top, gas solid top, bain marie, hot cupboard, fryer, grill, fry top, hot surface, induction, gas burner and gas or electric static oven. For those who prefer to work with a French top, your Molteni will feature a thick cast iron plate that graduates in temperature from cool to hot across its span. Each cast-iron appliance weighs almost half a ton and measures up to 5 feet long and 2 feet wide. The range can even be outfitted with a security system, which makes sense because it retails for $100,000. If soaking in a cast-iron or porcelain tub seems pedestrian, you may want to check out the offerings from the Italian company  Baldi . Baldi's Rock Crystal Bathtub measures 8 feet across, can accommodate three people and was hand-carved from a single piece of rock crystal found in the Amazonian rain forest. The original was shown at Salone del Mobile in 2008 and was purchased by a Russian magnate, who reportedly paid nearly $860,000 for it. If your tastes run toward more classically inspired design, Italian designer Luca Bojola partnered with Baldi to create the company's Malachite Bathtub. Made from malachite, a bright green crystal, the tub sits on 24-karat gold-plated claw feet. It can be yours for a mere $222,000. If you purchase a Baldacchino Supreme bed, you'd better have a pretty spectacular nightstand to set next to it. Lacquered and patinated, the bed and canopy feature decorative applications in gold leaf. The chestnut-and-ash structure is trimmed with Italian silk and cotton fabrics, and the headboard can be customized with diamond buttons. The bed is a collaboration between British designer  Stuart Hughes  and  Hebanon  by Fratelli Basile Interiors in southwestern Italy. At $6.4 million, the Baldacchino Supreme is reportedly the most expensive bed for sale in the world. If you want to buy one, you'd better hurry. The designer has announced only two of these beds would be made — and one's already been purchased.
