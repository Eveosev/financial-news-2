Hyundai Development Co. (012630)  rose to an
11-month high in Seoul trading and paced gains by South Korean
builders on expectations the government will soon announce
measures to aid the country’s  property market .  Hyundai Development rallied 3.9 percent to 25,650 won as of
10:06 a.m. on the Korea Exchange, bound for the highest close
since April 2012. The 34-member Kospi Construction Index
advanced 1.3 percent, the second-best  performer  among 19
industry groups in the  Kospi index. (KOSPI)   South Korea  announced yesterday it will unveil a stimulus
package in April to spur the property market and revive an
economy that the government expects to grow 2.3 percent this
year, lower than a 3 percent forecast made in December. A
supplementary budget and details of the measures to encourage
property sales will be released over time, the  Finance Ministry 
said in a statement yesterday.  “Now is the time that expectations for real estate
policies could rise more than ever before,” Lee Sang Hun, an
analyst at HI Investment & Securities Co., said in a report
today. South Korea President Park Geun Hye pledged on her first
day in office Feb. 25 to revitalize the economy.  Finance Minister Hyun Oh Seok said on March 22 he would use
“all possible policy measures” to boost an economy that has
grown less than 1 percent from quarter to quarter for seven
periods. The number of housing transactions fell 14 percent to
47,288 in February, the least for that month in at least seven
years, according to the land ministry.  GS Engineering & Construction Corp. (006360)  added 2.4 percent,
Hyundai Engineering & Construction Co. rose 1.1 percent, and
Daewoo Engineering & Construction Co. climbed 1.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
