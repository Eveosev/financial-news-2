San Francisco  Giants catcher Buster Posey, the National League’s Most Valuable Player and batting
champion in 2012, signed a nine-year, $167 million contract with
the team, according to MLB.com.  The 26-year-old’s agreement includes a club option that
could raise the value of the contract to $186 million and is the
most lucrative contract in the Major League Baseball franchise’s
history, the website reported today citing an unidentified
person familiar with the deal.  Posey hit an NL-best .336 last season, with 24 home runs
and 103 runs batted in, becoming the first catcher in 40 years
to be named NL MVP.  He helped the Giants to their second World Series title in
the past three years, a four-game sweep of the  Detroit Tigers .
San Francisco also won a World Series title in 2010, when Posey
was named NL Rookie of the year.  Giants pitcher Matt Cain’s six-year $127.5 million deal was
the highest contract in team history before Posey’s contract,
according to MLB.com.  -- Editor: Michael Sillup  To contact the reporter on this story:
