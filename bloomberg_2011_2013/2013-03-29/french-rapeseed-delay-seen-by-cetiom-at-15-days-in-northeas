Rapeseed development in the
northeast of  France ,  Europe ’s largest grower of the oilseed, is
about 15 days behind normal after late planting and a difficult
start to spring growth, industry researcher Cetiom said.  Farmers in Lorraine, northern Burgundy and Haute-Marne, who
account for about 21 percent of France’s rapeseed area, have
already plowed under “the most catastrophic” fields, Paris-
based Cetiom wrote in a  report  dated yesterday. More tearing up
of rapeseed crops may follow in coming days before it becomes
too late to sow spring crops, Cetiom said.  France accounted for 28 percent of the European Union’s
rapeseed production last year, Eurostat data show. French
farmers  harvested  1.61 million hectares (3 million acres) of the
oilseed, almost exclusively planted as a winter crop, according
to Agriculture Ministry data.  “We’ve never seen a situation like this, that is to say
very weak vegetative development in autumn followed by a
difficult restart of vegetation,” Cetiom wrote.  Dry August and September weather meant farmers in France’s
northeast planted less winter rapeseed than intended, while poor
and late sprouting had already prompted them to plow under part
of the crop and reseed with winter grains, Cetiom reported in
November.  Soils are still too cold to sow sunflowers or corn as
replacement crops, according to the researcher.  To contact the reporter on this story:
