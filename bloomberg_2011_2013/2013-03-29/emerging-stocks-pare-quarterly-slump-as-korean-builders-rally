Emerging-market stocks rose to a two-week high, paring the worst start to a year since 2008, as investors speculated  South Korea  will announce measures to aid the nation’s  property market  and  Turkey ’s trade deficit unexpectedly narrowed.  Hyundai Development Co. (012630)  jumped to an 11-month high in  Seoul .  Haci Omer Sabanci Holding AS (SAHOL) , Turkey’s second-largest industrial group, had its biggest rally in almost two weeks. NHN Corp., a South Korean search-engine operator, advanced the most since March 19 after Shinhan Investment Corp. said prospects of its mobile messenger application will bolster its share price.  Gamuda Bhd. (GAM)  fell the most in two months in  Kuala Lumpur  after at least two brokerages downgraded the stock.  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  added 0.2 percent to 1,034.56 at 8 p.m. in Moscow, trimming its quarterly decline to 2 percent, with 221 stocks advancing and 83 falling today. South Korea announced yesterday it will unveil a stimulus package in April to spur the property market and revive an economy that the government expects to grow 2.3 percent this year, lower than a 3 percent forecast made in December.  “Most governments are trying to implement policies to boost economic growth and employment,” said Prapas Tonpibulsak, who helps manage about $5.5 billion as Chief Investment Officer at Krungsri Asset Management Co. in Bangkok. “This should benefit equity investments.”  Reports today showed U.S. consumer spending increased the most in five months in February and confidence among American consumers unexpectedly rose in March from the prior month.  Less Trading  South Korea’s  Kospi (KOSPI)  Index climbed 0.6 percent to a three- week high. The  Istanbul Stock Exchange National 100 Index (XU100)  advanced 0.8 percent, and  Russia ’s Micex Index added 0.3 percent. Most markets were shut in  Asia ,  Europe  and  Latin America  for holidays.  Trading volumes were 68 percent less than the 30-day average for the Micex, 12 percent below for Turkey’s benchmark gauge and 5.7 percent under the average on the Kospi.  Sabanci added 1.4 percent. The trade deficit was $6.96 billion in February, down from $7.29 billion the previous month. The median estimate among six economists in the survey predicted an $8.8 billion shortfall.  Profit Drops  OAO Raspadskaya, a coal producer, fell 2.2 percent after saying it doesn’t plan dividends for 2012.

A gauge of technology stocks in the  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  advanced 0.6 percent today, the most among 10 industry groups. The broader measure slipped 1.9 percent this month, trailing a 2.1 percent gain in the  MSCI World Index (MXWO)  of developed-country stocks. The developing-nations gauge trades at 10.5 times  estimated  12-month earnings, compared with the  MSCI World (MXWO) ’s multiple of 13.4, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The  emerging-markets  gauge’s worst start to the year since 2008 compares with the MSCI World’s 7.2 percent gain. Global equities slumped in 2008 as the U.S subprime mortgage crisis and collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. sparked the global financial crisis.

A cut in South Korean  interest rates  in April is possible, which should boost sentiment toward stock brokerages, Jun Bae Seung, an analyst at Shinyoung Securities, said by phone today.
