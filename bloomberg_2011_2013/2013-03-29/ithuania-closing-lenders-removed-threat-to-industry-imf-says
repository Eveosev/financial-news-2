Lithuania’s decision to close four
 credit institutions  removed risks from the nation’s financial
industry without destroying public trust in banks, the
International Monetary Fund said.  “This has removed an important threat to financial
stability and strengthened the overall soundness of the
financial system,” the IMF’s executive board in Washington said
in a  statement  on its website late yesterday.  Lithuania’s central bank has unified financial regulators
and strengthened bank supervision since Vitas Vasiliauskas
became its chairman in April 2011. In November 2011, the
regulator shut Bankas Snoras AB for suspected misappropriation
of assets, while this year it closed  Ukio Bankas (UKB1L)  AB and two
 credit unions , saying risky lending to related parties had made
them insolvent.  Having more supervisory staff, more inspections and
stricter rules for customer due diligence at credit institutions
has set the stage for loan growth in Lithuania after four years
of shrinking portfolios, the IMF said in a  staff report  that it
published with the statement.  Stress tests show that even under “severe conditions”
such as large declines of exports and output or large
increases in  interest rates , capital adequacy in the Lithuanian
banking industry would remain “well above the regulatory
minimum,” according to the IMF report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
