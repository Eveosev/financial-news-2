Syracuse University  beat top-seeded
 Indiana  University 61-50 to advance to the East regional final
in men’s college basketball’s national championship.  The fourth-seeded Orange will play No. 3 seed Marquette for
a place in the Final Four at the National Collegiate Athletic
Association tournament. The Golden Eagles beat the third-seeded
Hurricanes 71-61 in tonight’s first game in the round of 16.  The meeting between the Hoosiers and the Orange was their
first in the NCAA tournament since Indiana beat Syracuse in the
1987 title game. Indiana is the second of the four regional top
seeds to be eliminated after Gonzaga lost its second game in the
East region.  Syracuse took the lead for good at 4-3 after three minutes,
41 seconds at Verizon Center in  Washington  and led by 18 points
with 3:22 to play in the first half.   In the last game today, No. 9 Wichita State faces No. 13 La
Salle for the right to play No. 2 Ohio State in the West
regional final. The Buckeyes rallied from an 11-point first-half
deficit to beat the Wildcats 73-70 tonight.  Arizona  tied it at 70-70 with 21 seconds to play at Staples
Center in  Los Angeles  before LaQuinton Ross’s 3-point jumper
with two seconds remaining sealed the win for the Buckeyes.
Deshaun Thomas led Ohio State with 20 points and Ross added 17.  Syracuse won its only NCAA title 10 years ago and is in the
regional finals for the second straight year.  Marquette advanced to the round of eight for the seventh
time. The Golden Eagles won the title in 1977, were runner-up
three years earlier, and have reached the Final Four three
times, most recently in 2003.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
