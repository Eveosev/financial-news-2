All Nippon Airways Co. (9202) , Asiaâ€™s
largest airline by sales, won a five-star rating from Skytrax
after boosting service for non-Japanese passengers, becoming the
first Japanese airline to get the award, the carrier said.  ANA, which last year tied up with French patissier Pierre
Herme and the Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group, is focusing on
premium services as low-cost carriers Jetstar Japan Co. and
AirAsia Japan Co. challenge it for passengers on domestic
routes.  First and business class airline travel rose 9 percent
within the Far East last year, versus a year earlier, according
to the  International Air Transport Association . That compares
with 4.8 percent growth globally.  ANA joins six other companies that have received the award
previously from the airline consultant and rating company,
according to a statement from the Tokyo-based airline.  To contact the reporters on this story:
