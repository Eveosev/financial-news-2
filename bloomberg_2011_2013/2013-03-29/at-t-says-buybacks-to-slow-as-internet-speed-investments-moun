AT&T Inc. (T) , the largest U.S. phone
company, said it will slow the pace of share buybacks as it
embarks on a project to speed up its Internet speeds.  The board authorized 300 million new share repurchases
today, Dallas-based AT&T said today in a statement. The company
has already bought 239 million of the shares from the most
recent approval for 300 million buybacks last July, on top of
the 300 million it was permitted to buy in December 2010.  AT&T is spending more to extend its Long Term Evolution
mobile network and to install fiber-optic lines closer to more
customers to increase their speeds.  Capital expenditures  will
rise to a record $21 billion this year, up from $19.5 billion in
2012, AT&T said in January.  “Future repurchase decisions will be made
opportunistically, which will slow the pace of buybacks compared
to recent activity,” the company said.  AT&T reiterated a November forecast that it will keep its
ratio of net debt to earnings at 1.8, leaving out interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization. The measure climbed to 1.58 at
the end of 2012, up from 1.42 in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
