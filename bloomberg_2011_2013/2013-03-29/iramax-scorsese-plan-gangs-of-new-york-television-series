Miramax Film Corp. and director
 Martin Scorsese  are developing a TV series based on his film
“Gangs of New York,” the studio’s first production since
investors bought it from  Walt Disney Co. (DIS)   The show will expand from the movie’s focus on 19th-century
New York gangs to explain the birth of organized crime in
America, the closely held Santa Monica, California-based company
said yesterday in a statement.  The program marks the first new production announced by
Miramax since investors, led by Tom Barrack’s Colony Capital
LLC, bought the company in 2010 for more than $660 million. At
the time, the new owners said they planned to focus on
exploiting Miramax’s existing 700-movie library. The studio
didn’t say where or when the new show might air.  In December 2011, Miramax Chairman Richard Nanula said the
studio had signed agreements valued at $325 million licensing
its library to digital distributors including  Netflix Inc. (NFLX)  and
Hulu LLC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
