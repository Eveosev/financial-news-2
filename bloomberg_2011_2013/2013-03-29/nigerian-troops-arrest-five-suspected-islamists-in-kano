Nigerian troops arrested five
suspected Islamist militants in the northern city of Kano and
destroyed a house where they stored weapons, a military
spokesman said.  Security forces found more than a dozen improvised
explosive devices, bomb-making materials, Kalashnikov rifles and
machine guns in the building in the Gaida Ajawa district of the
city, Ikedichi Iweha, a spokesman for the joint military  task
force  in the region, said today in a statement handed to
reporters.  About 22 people were killed and 65 wounded on March 18 when
suspected members of the Islamist group Boko Haram detonated
bombs at a bus station in Kano’s Sabon Gari district.  Boko Haram has carried out attacks in the north and the
capital of Abuja since 2009 as part of a campaign to impose
Shariah law in  Africa ’s top oil producer. The most populous
African nation, with more than 160 million people,  Nigeria  is
roughly divided between a largely Muslim north and mostly
Christian south.  To contact the reporter on this story:
