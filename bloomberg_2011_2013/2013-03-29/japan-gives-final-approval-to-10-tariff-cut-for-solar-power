Japan  gave final approval to a
recommendation to cut the tariff for solar power by 10 percent
for the year starting April 1 to 37.8 yen (40 cents) per
kilowatt hour for 20 years.  The reduction marks the first rate change since the country
started an incentive program for clean energy in July. Rates for
other types of clean energy such as wind and geothermal will
remain unchanged, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry
said in a statement today.  Earlier this month, a government-appointed committee made
proposals for the tariffs; todayâ€™s announcement came after
approval by trade minister Toshimitsu Motegi.  The tariff for wind is 23.1 yen per kilowatt hour for 20
years, according to the ministry. Geothermal is 27.3 yen per
kilowatt hour for plants with capacity of 15,000 kilowatts or
larger, and 42 yen per kilowatt hour for smaller plants, both
for 15 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
