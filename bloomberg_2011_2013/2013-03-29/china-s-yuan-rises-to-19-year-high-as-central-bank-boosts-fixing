China’s yuan rose to a 19-year high
after the central bank raised its daily reference rate to the
strongest level in more than 10 months.  The People’s Bank of China increased the  fixing  by 0.08
percent to 6.2689 per dollar, the highest since May 2, 2012. The
currency is allowed to trade 1 percent either side of the rate.
The Purchasing Managers’ Index for manufacturing in March will
be 51, indicating a sixth month of expansion, according to the
 median estimate  in a Bloomberg News survey of economists before
official data on April 1. President Xi Jinping is on his first
foreign visit since taking over earlier this month and has held
meetings with the heads of the so-called BRICs nations of Brazil,
Russia and India as well as African countries.  “Investors continue to be convinced about the gradual
appreciation of the yuan,” said Samson Tu, a Taipei-based fund
manager at Uni-President Assets Management Corp., which oversees
$700 million. “The  yuan ’s recent strength is probably
politically driven as Xi is on overseas visits.”  The yuan climbed 0.06 percent to close at 6.2108 per dollar
in Shanghai, prices from the China Foreign Exchange Trade System
show. The currency, which gained 0.31 percent this quarter,
reached 6.2086 earlier, the strongest level since the government
unified official and market exchange rates at the end of 1993.
The spot rate advanced 0.02 percent this week, a fifth straight
weekly gain.  Yuan Deposits  Yuan deposits  in Hong Kong climbed to a record 652 billion
yuan ($105 billion) in February, the Hong Kong Monetary
Authority said. The city has the largest pool of yuan savings
overseas.  In the offshore market, the Chinese currency rose 0.05
percent to 6.2050 per dollar, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

6.3015 per dollar, a 1.4 percent discount to the spot rate in
Shanghai.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
