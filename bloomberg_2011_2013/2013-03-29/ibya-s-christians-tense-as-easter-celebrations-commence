Churches in  Libya ’s capital,
Tripoli, are tightening security measures before Easter
celebrations on concern that Christians will be targeted by
Islamist militants.  The doors of the Christ the King Church in the city’s Old
Town will be closed during services, Reverend Vasihar Baskaran,
vicar at the Anglican church, said in an interview. In previous
years they were left open, with people free to come and go, he
said.  “I asked the congregation not to linger in the courtyard,
and just to go home after the service,” Baskaran said. “We do
not want to provoke any distractions.”  Baskaran said he also cancelled a Palm Sunday parade
through the streets. Police guards are stationed around the
capital’s Coptic Church. Further east, the Vatican closed the
Congregation of the Holy Family of Sapoleto, a 100-year-old
monastery on the coast at Derna, and evacuated the Franciscan
Sisters of the Child Jesus convent at nearby Barca.  Islamists, suppressed under the 42-year rule of  Muammar Qaddafi , have been flexing their muscles in the security vacuum
that emerged after his ouster in 2011. Much of the violence has
been directed at the minority Sufi sect, through the ransacking
of their libraries and destruction of their mosques and shrines.  More recently, militants have attacked churches and
cemeteries. In February, a gunman shot at Catholic and Greek
Orthodox priests in Tripoli. Christians account for an estimated
1 percent of the population of 6.5 million and are mostly
foreign workers.  Dozens of people have also been arrested on charges of
proselytizing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
