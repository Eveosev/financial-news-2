Syracuse University  knocked out
top-seeded Indiana University 61-50 to advance to a regional
final in the men’s national college basketball tournament.  Fourth-seeded Syracuse topped Indiana and No. 3 seed
Marquette beat No. 2 Miami 71-61 last night in the East region.
No. 2 Ohio State overcame sixth-seeded  Arizona  73-70 and No. 9
Wichita State won 72-58 against No. 13 La Salle in the West.  “Our defense has been good all year and tonight it was
really good,” Syracuse coach  Jim Boeheim  said in a news
conference. “This is one of our best defensive teams ever.”  In the remaining round of 16 games in the National
Collegiate Athletic Association tournament tonight, it will be
top-seeded Louisville against No. 12 Oregon and No. 2 Duke
facing third-seeded Michigan State in the Midwest region, and No.
1 Kansas versus fourth-seeded Michigan and No. 15  Florida  Gulf
Coast playing third-seeded Florida in the South.  Michael Carter-Williams scored 24 points and Brandon Triche
added 14 for Syracuse (29-9) at the Verizon Center in Washington.
The Orange, who haven’t been to the Final Four since  New York 
Knicks’ leading scorer Carmelo Anthony led them to the title in
2003, will meet Marquette in the regional final.  1987 Rematch  The meeting between the Hoosiers and the Orange was their
first in the NCAA tournament since  Indiana  beat Syracuse in the
1987 title game. Indiana is the second of the four regional top
seeds to be eliminated after Gonzaga lost its second game in the
West region.  Victor Oladipo led the Hoosiers (29-7) with 16 points and
Christian Watford had 13.  Jamil Wilson came off the bench to score 16 points for
Marquette (26-8), which advanced to the regional finals for the
seventh time. It won the title in 1977, was runner-up three
years earlier, and has reached the Final Four three times, most
recently in 2003.  “It’s fantastic. It feels good not to have to worry about,
are you going to lose on a last-second shot or are you going to
win on a last-second shot?” Wilson told reporters. “To have a
cushion like that, these guys played with tremendous heart, and
we did it all game.”  Vander Blue and Davante Gardner each added 14 points for
the Golden Eagles at the Verizon Center.  Shane Larkin scored 14 points and Kenny Kadji added 11 for
Miami (29-7), which was seeking to reach the regional finals for
the first time after also losing in the round of 16 in 2000.  In the West region, Malcolm Armstead scored 18 points and
Carl Hall had 16 for the Shockers (29-8) at the Staples Center
in  Los Angeles . Jerrell Wright and reserve Tyrone Garland each
had 16 points for the Explorers (24-10).  OSU Wins  Arizona tied its game against Ohio State at 70-70 with 21.8
seconds to play, before LaQuinton Ross hit the winning 3-pointer
with two seconds remaining at the Staples Center.  “This is what every player grows up looking at on TV,
wanting to hit that big shot for an NCAA tournament team,” said
Ross, who scored 17 points. “It just feels great right now.”  Deshaun Thomas led the Buckeyes (29-7) with 20 points and
Aaron Craft added 13. Mark Lyons led the Wildcats (27-8) with 23
points and Solomon Hill followed with 16.  The Buckeyes rallied from an 11-point first-half deficit
against the Wildcats and will play Wichita State for a place in
the Final Four. Ohio State reached the Final Four in 2012, their
second visit to the national semifinals in five years, and won
their only NCAA title in 1960.  The NCAA championship game is April 8 at the Georgia Dome
in Atlanta.  To contact the reporter on this story:
