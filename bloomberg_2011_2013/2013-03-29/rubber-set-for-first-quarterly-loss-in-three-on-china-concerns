Rubber declined, heading for the
first quarterly loss since June, as swelling stockpiles and
slowing manufacturing in  China  signal weakened demand from the
world’s largest consumer.  The contract for delivery in September dropped as much as
1.8 percent to 270.1 yen a kilogram ($2,869 a metric ton), the
lowest level since March 18. Futures traded at 271.8 yen on the
 Tokyo  Commodity Exchange at 10:20 a.m., extending losses for
this quarter to 10 percent after two periods of gains.  China tightened curbs on the property market this month to
moderate prices. The nation’s manufacturing expanded at the
slowest pace in five months in February and retail-sales growth
slipped. Natural-rubber inventories climbed 1.9 percent to
115,991 tons, the highest level in about three years, data from
the Shanghai Futures Exchange showed March 22. The bourse will
update the data later today.  “Stockpiles in China may expand further as demand failed
to pick up,” Takaki Shigemoto, an analyst at research company
JSC Corp. in Tokyo, said today by phone.  China’s demand for the commodity may be unchanged this year
as consumption by the heavy-truck sector slows while tire output
for passenger vehicles climbs, according to Hangzhou Zhongce
Rubber Co. The country represents 34 percent of global rubber
demand, according to the International Rubber Study Group.  The contract for September delivery fell 0.3 percent to
22,030  yuan  ($3,545) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange.
Thai rubber free-on-board lost 0.9 percent to 86.05 baht ($2.93)
a kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research Institute
of  Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
