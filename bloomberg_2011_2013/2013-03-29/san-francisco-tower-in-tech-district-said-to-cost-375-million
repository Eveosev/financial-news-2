A  San Francisco  developer’s plan to
build a 54-story office and residential tower in the city’s
South of Market neighborhood will cost about $375 million,
according to a person familiar with details of the proposal.  Builder Jay Paul Co. plans to “immediately commence
construction” of an 800-foot (244-meter) high rise near the
site of the city’s new Transbay bus and rail terminal, the San
Francisco-based real-estate firm said yesterday in a statement.
The building will also be near an  office tower  planned by Boston
Properties Inc. and Hines that’s set to be the city’s tallest.  The 181 Fremont mixed-use tower will contain 684,000 square
feet (63,500 square meters), with 74 residential units, 420,000
square feet of offices, and retail space.  San Francisco has the best office outlook of any major U.S.
market for revenue growth per square foot through 2017,
according to research firm Green Street Advisors Inc. Average
downtown rents in the first quarter rose 12 percent from a year
earlier to $51.92, broker Cushman & Wakefield said.  San Francisco office sales last year included Columbia
Property Trust’s acquisition of 333 Market St. for $447 million,
or $680 a square foot, a deal made desirable because the
building is fully leased to  Wells Fargo & Co . through 2026,
Cushman said. Clarion Partners purchased 343 Sansome St. for
about $425 a square foot, the broker said.  Iconic Building  Designed by San Francisco-based Heller Manus, the 181
Fremont tower “will be a very iconic building,” Jay Paul,
principal and founder of Jay Paul Co., said in the statement.
“The unobstructed views and exoskeleton structural system that
allows for column-free layouts and floor-to ceiling windows will
be optimal for tech tenants.”  The building’s cost works out to $540 per square foot and
includes $75 million for the site and approvals from the city,
said the person familiar with the plan who asked not to be
identified because terms of the deal are private.  Jay Paul spokeswoman Tara Samuels said company officials
weren’t available to comment on the price due to the holiday.  The cost of buying land and developing an office building
is generally $500 to $700 a square foot in San Francisco,  Dan Fasulo , managing director of Real Capital Analytics Inc., said
in an e-mail yesterday. Jay Paul Co. acquired the parcel and
entitlements from locally-based SKS Investments, according to
yesterday’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
