The Detroit Tigers signed pitcher
 Justin Verlander  to a five-year contact extension, keeping the
2011 Cy Young Award winner from becoming a free agent in 2014.  Verlander’s extension is worth as much as $202 million,
which would make him the highest-paid pitcher in  Major League
Baseball , ESPN reported without citing the source of its
information. The Tigers didn’t disclose terms of the extension
on its website.  Verlander, a 30-year-old right-hander, had two years and
$40 million remaining on a four-year contract. The extension
increases the contract to seven years and $180 million with an
option for the 2020 season, pushing it to $202 million, ESPN
reported.  The deal surpasses a seven-year, $175 million contract
 Felix Hernandez  signed with the Seattle Mariners in February.  Verlander was runner-up to Tampa Bay’s  David Price  in
voting for last season’s American League Cy Young Award, given
to the league’s best pitcher.  He finished the regular season with a 17-8 record and a
2.64 earned-run average. Verlander won the Cy Young and the AL’s
Most Valuable Player award in 2011, going 24-5 with a 2.40 ERA
and 250 strikeouts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
