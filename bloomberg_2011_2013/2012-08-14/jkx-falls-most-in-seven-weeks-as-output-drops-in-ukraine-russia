JKX Oil & Gas Plc (JKX) , an oil and gas
producer active in Ukraine and  Russia , had the biggest intraday
decline in seven weeks after reporting a slump in output.  Shares declined as much as 7.4 percent and traded down 2.9
percent at 92.25 pence as of 9:30 a.m. in London. Production in
the first half fell to 7,481 barrels of oil equivalent a day
from 9,476 barrels a year earlier, the company said in its
earnings report today.  The explorer’s Koshekhablskoye project in southern Russia,
which will add output of about 7,000 barrels of oil equivalent a
day, was delayed and won’t reach capacity until next year, the
company said. JKX also took a charge against its Ukrainian
assets of $30.7 million.  “Russia has been a large project with difficulties, but
we’ve made progress,” Chief Executive Officer Paul Davies said
in a telephone interview. “We anticipate at least maintaining
production levels this year and we should see a reasonably
significant increase next year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
