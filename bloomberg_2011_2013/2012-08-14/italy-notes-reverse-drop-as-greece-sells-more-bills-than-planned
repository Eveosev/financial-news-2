Italian two-year notes reversed a
decline and Spanish securities pared a drop after  Greece  raised
more than its maximum target at an auction of bills.  The yield on Italy’s two-year note fell four basis points
to 3.44 percent at 10:25 a.m. London time. It earlier climbed as
much as eight basis points.  Spain ’s two-year rate was little changed at 4.27 percent
after climbing to 4.34 percent.  Greece sold 4.06 billion euros of three-month bills,
exceeding its 3.125 billion-euro target, according to the
Athens-based Public Debt Management Agency.  The rate on Greek debt due in February 2023 was 16 basis
points higher at 24.5 percent, with the price falling to 19.62
percent of face value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
