OAO Transneft,  Russia â€™s oil pipeline
operator, wants to raise tariffs to pay for a 125 billion-ruble
($3.9 billion) expansion plan for oil-product pipelines,
 Vedomosti  reported.  The Federal Tariff Service asked the government to allow
Transneft to absorb the extra costs in its tariffs, which may
increase by 1.5 percent to 2 percent, the Moscow-based newspaper
said, citing unidentified people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
