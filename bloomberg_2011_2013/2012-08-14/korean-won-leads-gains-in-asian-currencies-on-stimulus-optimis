Malaysia’s ringgit led gains among
Asian currencies after international investors boosted holdings
of the region’s assets amid speculation central banks in major
economies will act to spur growth.  Minutes released today from a  Bank of Japan (8301)  meeting last
month showed policy makers weren’t ruling out any options to
boost the economy, the biggest export market for the Philippines
and the second-largest for Thailand. The  MSCI (MXAP)  Asia Pacific Index
of stocks gained after demand rose at an Italian debt auction
yesterday, damping concern Europe’s debt crisis will worsen.
Global funds pumped almost $6 billion into Indian, South Korean,
Taiwanese and Thai stocks this month, exchange data show.  “Financial markets have been quite stable recently, making
it easier for investors to take some risks,” said Tohru Nishihama, an economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute Inc.
in Tokyo. “Speculation has been lingering about monetary easing
by central banks in major economies, which also encouraged some
fund inflows to  emerging markets .”  The ringgit strengthened 0.2 percent to 3.1153 per dollar
as of 4:23 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. South Korea’s won and Taiwan’s dollar added 0.1
percent to 1,129.78 and NT$29.965, respectively. The Bloomberg-
JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index held steady at 115.48. It touched
115.73 on Aug. 9, the highest level since May 15.  ‘Not Game-Changing’  Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President  John
Williams  said the central bank should begin a third round of
bond purchases amid signs U.S. growth is slowing, the San
Francisco Chronicle reported on Aug. 10. Germany last week
backed a European Central Bank bond-buying plan that may
alleviate the region’s debt problems.  Italy  sold 8 billion euros ($9.9 billion) of Treasury bills
at an auction yesterday, with investors bidding for 1.69 times
the amount offered, compared with 1.55 times last month.  The won snapped a two-day loss as the benchmark  Kospi (KOSPI)  index
of stocks rose 1.3 percent.  “There are some foreign inflows into the stock market that
are supporting the won,” said David Kang, a currency analyst at
Woori Futures Inc. in Seoul. “There is some small positive news
on Italy, but it’s not a game-changing situation.”  Taiwan’s dollar rose for the first time in three days
before data that’s forecast to show U.S. retail sales  increased 
0.3 percent last month, the first gain since March, according to
a Bloomberg survey, easing concern a recovery in the world’s
largest economy is losing momentum.  ‘Attractive Valuations’  “Foreign funds have been piling into Taiwanese stocks as
they see attractive valuations,” said Tarsicio Tong, a foreign-
exchange trader at  Union Bank of Taiwan (2838)  in Taipei.  India’s rupee dropped 0.5 percent to 55.6413 per dollar as
Director General of Foreign Trade Anup Pujari said exports slid
14.8 percent last month from a year earlier. Imports fell 7.6
percent, resulting in a $15.5 billion trade deficit, he said at
a briefing in  New Delhi  today. The benchmark wholesale-price
index increased 6.87 percent in July, the slowest pace in 32
months, official data showed today. The median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey was for a 7.2 percent rise.  Elsewhere, the Philippine peso was little changed at 41.917
per dollar and Indonesia’s rupiah was unchanged at 9,485.
China’s  yuan  strengthened 0.05 percent to 6.3586 and Thailand’s
baht advanced 0.1 percent from Aug. 10 to 31.44. Onshore
financial markets were closed in Thailand yesterday for a public
holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
