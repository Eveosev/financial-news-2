Rejlerkoncernen AB (REJLB) , a Swedish
technical consulting company, slipped the most in three months
after second-quarter net income fell 25 percent as the  European
debt crisis  continued to hinder profit.  Rejlers  declined  as much as 6.1 percent, or 4.5 kronor, to
69.25 kronor, its biggest intraday fall since May 18, and was
the sixth biggest faller on the  Stockholm OMX All-Share Index. (SAX) 
Shares traded 3.7 percent lower at 2.75 kronor as of 3:17 p.m.
in Stockholm, valuing the company at 805 million kronor ($120
million).  Second-Quarter net income fell to 12.9 million kronor from
17.4 million kronor a year earlier, the company said in a
statement today. Operating income fell 26 percent to 17.9
million kronor.  “The market prospects are mainly bright, but weak economic
development in Europe is affecting parts of the operations,”
the Stockholm-based company said in the statement. “The market
climate in Finland is improving
but still remains slightly weaker than in Sweden and Norway”,
it said.  Rejlers, which provides consultancy services in the fields
of electrical engineering, energy, mechanical engineering,
automation, electronics, IT and telecommunications, receives
almost 80 percent of its full-year sales from Sweden, according
to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
