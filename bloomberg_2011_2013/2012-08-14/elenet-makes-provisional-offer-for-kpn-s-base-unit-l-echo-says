Telenet Group Holding NV (TNET)  has made an
offer to buy  Royal KPN NV’s (KPN)  Base unit,  L’Echo  reported, citing
people familiar with the matter without naming them.  While Telenet has publicly denied an interest in Base, the
company last week put forward a provisional offer for the
Belgian mobile-phone operator, the newspaper said. The bid
envisages a joint acquisition of Base by Telenet and Belgian
cable operator Voo, according to L’Echo.  Telenet may make a binding offer for Base within the next
two weeks, L’Echo said. This contradicts a statement from the
company yesterday that it “is not pursuing any significant
acquisitions in the foreseeable future,” according to the
newspaper.  Vincent Bruyneel, spokesman for Telenet, was not
immediately available when called by Bloomberg News.  Telenet shares declined as much as 3.4 percent in Brussels
and traded at 34.80 euros at 9:07 a.m. local time, down 1.4
percent.  KPN is seeking to sell Base after ending discussions on a
potential merger involving its E-Plus wireless unit in  Germany .
The company, based in  The Hague , last month cut its dividend
forecast by 61 percent after earnings trailed analysts’
estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
