Peru’s dollar bonds fell, pushing
yields to three-week high, as a report showing U.S. retail sales
rose in July more than forecast damped speculation the  Federal
Reserve  will add to its monetary stimulus.  The yield on Peru’s benchmark 6.55 percent bond due March
2037 rose nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 3.82
percent at 12:15 p.m. in Lima, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The price fell 1.79 cents to 143.25 cents per dollar.  The yield fell to a record low 3.60 percent on Aug. 3 as
speculation the Fed will step up bond purchases to support the
world’s biggest economy spurred demand for emerging-market debt.
U.S. retail sales rose in July for the first time in four months
and exceeded forecasts, Commerce Department figures showed today
in Washington.  “The data have been getting better,” said  Enrique Alvarez , the head of Latin America fixed-income research at
IdeaGlobal in  New York . “The bets are still in favor” of
another round of bond purchases, “but the odds of it happening
have diminished.”  The sol was little changed at 2.6168 per  U.S. dollar ,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
