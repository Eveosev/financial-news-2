What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets, which open at 5 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade.  -- Corn futures are called to open 1 cent to 2 cents a bushel
higher on the Chicago Board of Trade, after a three-session
price slide sparks purchases by importers and U.S. livestock
producers,  Dave Marshall , a farm marketing adviser for Toay
Commodity Futures Group LLC in Nashville, Illinois, said in a
telephone interview.  -- Soybean futures may open 1 cent to 3 cents a bushel higher in
Chicago on signs of rising domestic processing activity and
increased global demand for soy-based  animal feed  and cooking
oils, Marshall said.  -- Wheat futures may open steady to 2 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT after a 34 percent jump in prices during the past two
months reduces overseas demand for U.S. supplies, Marshall said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
