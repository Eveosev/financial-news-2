Sunflower production in the European
Union,  Russia  and Ukraine will be lower than previously expected
after heat and dry weather in June and July damaged the oilseed
crop, Oil World wrote.  The three producers will harvest 24.8 million metric tons
of sunflower seed this year, the Hamburg-based researcher wrote
in an e-mailed report, cutting its July forecast by 660,000
tons. That compares with a 28.1 million-ton crop in 2011.  Sunflower seed is the world’s fourth-biggest oilseed crop
after soybeans, rapeseed and cotton seed, accounting for about 9
percent of global oilseed output last year, Oil World data show.
Sunflower-oil prices may rise relative to other cooking oils due
to the production drop, the researcher wrote.  “The volumes lost in sunflower seed and oil are likely to
be sufficiently large to have an impact on the global vegetable-
oil market,” Oil World wrote. “The losses come on top of the
prospective sharp decline in world production of soya oil in the
next six months.”  EU production of sunflower seed will drop to 7.22 million
tons from 8.2 million tons in 2011 on smaller crops in  France ,
 Hungary ,  Spain  and  Romania , according to Oil World, which
previously expected a harvest of 7.87 million tons.  Russia, Ukraine  Farmers in Russia will harvest 8 million tons of the
oilseed, down from 9.5 million tons last year and 400,000 tons
less than last month’s outlook, the report showed. Ukraine’s
sunflower-seed crop is seen falling to 8.6 million tons from 9.3
million tons, with the outlook cut by 600,000 tons.  The outlook for Northern Hemisphere sunflower-seed
production is “declining at an alarming rate,” Oil World
wrote. “Production prospects have considerably deteriorated as
a result of unfavorably hot and dry conditions.”  Importers in North Africa and  India  can still buy sunflower
oil from the  Black Sea region  at competitive prices compared to
 soybean oil  from Argentina due to more attractive freight costs,
according to Oil World.  While sunflowers are more drought-resistant than corn,
weather conditions in coming weeks will be “critical” and
yields may deteriorate further if there is no adequate rain
“soon,” Oil World wrote.  The production slide “will enforce a reduction in
crushings and strengthen the prices of sun seed, oil and meal in
the next months, spilling over also to rapeseed and products,”
the researcher wrote. “We are now in a transition period. We
would not be surprised if sun oil widens its price premiums
relative to soya oil, rape oil and palm oil.”  EU imports of sunflower seed are predicted to be 300,000 to
350,000 tons in the 2012-13 crop year compared with 322,000 tons
in the previous season, according to Oil World.  Turkey  will
import 650,000 to 750,000 tons, compared with 900,000 tons in
2011-12, the researcher forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
