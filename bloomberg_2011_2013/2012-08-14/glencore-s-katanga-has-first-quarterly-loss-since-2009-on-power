Glencore International Plc (GLEN) ’s  Katanga
Mining Ltd. (KAT)  unit, a copper producer in the  Democratic Republic 
of Congo, posted its first quarterly loss since 2009 after power
cuts trimmed output.  Katanga, 75 percent owned by the world’s biggest
commodities trader, reported a net loss of $916,000 for the
three months through June, the Zug, Switzerland-based company
said today in a statement. That compares with net income of
$43.7 million a year earlier and is its first  quarterly loss 
since the third quarter of 2009.  Power shortages in Congo resulted in about 17 days of lost
production in the quarter and 28 days in the first half, Katanga
said. It expects disruptions to decrease this half. Glencore is
scheduled to report first-half earnings Aug. 21.  Katanga said first-half net income was $16.7 million, down
from $85.5 million a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
