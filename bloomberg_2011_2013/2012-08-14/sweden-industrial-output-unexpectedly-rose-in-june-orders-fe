Swedish industrial production
unexpectedly climbed in June as the Nordic economy shows signs
of withstanding the  European debt crisis .  Industrial production  rose an annual 1.1 percent in June
after falling 2.4 percent the previous month, Stockholm-based
Statistics Sweden said today. Production was  estimated  to drop
1.1 percent, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg
survey of six economists. Output rose a  monthly  0.4 percent
compared with a 1 percent contraction  predicted by analysts .  The Swedish government may raise its growth forecasts
published last month since the “economy has proven more
resistant,” Finance Minister  Anders Borg  said last week after
second-quarter output expanded more than estimated.  Sweden’s  economy  grew 2.3 percent in the second quarter,
compared with analyst estimates of 0.6 percent. The government
last month raised this year’s growth forecast to 1.1 percent
following a better-than-estimated first three months of the
year, and cut its projection for 2013 growth to 3 percent.  Industrial orders from Swedish companies fell an  annual  1.9
percent and a  monthly  0.2 percent in June,  Statistics Sweden 
said today, suggesting waning demand may crimp output going
forward as the European debt crisis weighs on exports.  About 50 percent of Swedish output is sold abroad, of which
about 70 percent is bound for  Europe  where countries are cutting
spending to reduce private and public debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
