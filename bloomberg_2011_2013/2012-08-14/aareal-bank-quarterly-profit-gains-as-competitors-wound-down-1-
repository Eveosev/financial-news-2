Aareal Bank AG (ARL) , a German commercial-
property lender, said second-quarter profit climbed 12 percent
after picking up clients from failed Eurohypo AG and Westimmo.  Net income rose to 29 million euros ($36 million), from 26
million euros, the Wiesbaden-based lender said today. Operating
profit was little changed at 44 million euros.  Commerzbank AG said in June it’s winding down its Eurohypo
unit, once the biggest real estate lender in  Europe , after
WestLB did the same with its Westimmo division. Aareal targets
new business of 4.5 billion to 5.5 billion euros this year as
real-estate markets in  Germany ,  France  and  Poland  withstand
property slumps elsewhere in Europe.  “Former clients of Eurohypo and other failed real estate
lenders are seeking a safe haven and coming to us,” Chief
Executive Officer Wolf Schumacher said on a conference call
today. “We are benefiting from the situation as we can reach
higher margins.”  Aareal climbed as much as 2 percent in Frankfurt trading
and gained 1.3 percent to 14.88 euros at 10:51 a.m. The stock
has advanced 6.3 percent this year, giving the bank a market
value of 890 million euros.  The company sees “good potential for achieving full-year
consolidated operating profit that is only slightly below last
year’s very good result,” Schumacher said. “As economic risks
have increased we stick to our conservative business policy:
first funding and second new business.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
