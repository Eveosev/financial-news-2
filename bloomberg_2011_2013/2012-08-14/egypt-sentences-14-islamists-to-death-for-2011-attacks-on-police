An Egyptian criminal court in
Ismailia sentenced 14 Islamists to death for attacking a police
center and a bank in Sinai last year, the court said in a faxed
statement today.  The men were convicted of killing police and army officers,
as well as civilians in the attacks in Arish in north Sinai.
They formed an armed group that executed the attacks, the
statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
