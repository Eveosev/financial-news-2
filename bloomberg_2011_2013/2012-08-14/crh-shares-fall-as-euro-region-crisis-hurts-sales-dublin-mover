CRH Plc (CRH)  fell the most in nine months
in Dublin trading as Ireland’s biggest listed company said sales
will drop faster in  Europe  and growth in the Americas will slow.  CRH shares declined as much as 7.5 percent, the biggest
fall since November, to 14.35 euros. Second-half like-for-like
European sales will decline more than the 5 percent drop in the
first half and growth on that basis in the Americas will be
“well below” the 8 percent posted in the first six months, the
building materials company said today.  CRH said it is advancing a cost-cutting program in response
to “continued weakness in key European markets.” Euro-area
construction output fell 8.4 percent in May from a year earlier,
its fifth consecutive drop, according to Eurostat.  Germany ’s
 HeidelbergCement AG (HEI)  said last month it planned to improve
profitability with two cost-cutting initiatives.  “Overall, we see realities of the sector catching up with
CRH,” Ian Osburn, an analyst at ING, said in a note.
“Management outlook becomes much more bearish.”  The stock was down 7.1 percent at 14.42 euros at 3:02 p.m.
The shares have fallen 6.2 percent this year, giving the company
a market value of 10.4 billion euros ($12.8 billion).  CRH’s cost-reduction programs saved 50 million euros in the
first half of the year, bringing cumulative annualized savings
to 2.1 billion euros since 2007, the company said today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
