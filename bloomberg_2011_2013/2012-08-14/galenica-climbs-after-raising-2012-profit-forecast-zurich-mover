Galenica AG (GALN) , the worldâ€™s biggest
maker of iron-replacement drugs, rose the most in more than nine
months in Zurich after increasing its full-year profit forecast.  Galenica climbed as much as 4.5 percent, the biggest
intraday advance since Nov. 11. The stock traded 3.9 percent
higher at 581 Swiss francs as of 9:16 a.m. The shares have
advanced 7.1 percent this year, including reinvested dividends,
 compared  with a 12 percent gain in the Swiss Performance Index.  The Bern, Switzerland-based company expects profit to rise
this year, it said as it  reported  first-half earnings today.
Galenica said in March that 2012 profit would be unchanged.  First-half net income rose 13 percent to 119.6 million
francs ($123 million), and sales advanced 2.2 percent to 1.62
billion francs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
