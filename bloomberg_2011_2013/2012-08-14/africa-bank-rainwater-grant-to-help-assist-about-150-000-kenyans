The  African Development Bank  has
allocated almost $1 million for a rainwater harvesting grant
designed to assist about 150,000 Kenyans in rural, water-
stressed communities.  The 690,000-euro project from the African Water Facility
includes building separate improved ventilated latrines for boys
and girls in schools, installing water tanks for roof catchment
and farm ponds for surface runoff to help “minimize conflict
over water” and build resilience to drought conditions, the
AfDB said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
