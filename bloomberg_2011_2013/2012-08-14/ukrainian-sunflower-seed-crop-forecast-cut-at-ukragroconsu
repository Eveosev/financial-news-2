Ukraineâ€™s sunflower-seed crop is
poised to fall to 8.9 million metric tons this year because of
dryness and record heat, UkrAgroConsult said.  The country harvested 9.3 million tons of the seeds in
2011, the Kiev-based researcher said yesterday in an e-mailed
statement. The Russian sunflower-seed harvest will drop to 7.5
million tons from 9.5 million tons last year, UkrAgroConsult
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
