Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ,  Europe ’s
largest oil producer, raised $2.5 billion with its first bond
offering since 2010 in a three-part sale.  The company issued $1 billion of 1.125 percent, five-year
notes that yield 50 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, an equal portion of 2.375 percent, 10-year bonds
with a 70 basis-point spread, and $500 million of 3.625 percent
30-year debt that pays 82 basis points more than benchmarks,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The company’s Shell International Finance  unit , which last
issued dollar obligations due in three decades in March 2010,
will use proceeds for general corporate purposes, The Hague-
based  company  said today in a regulatory filing.  Shell’s longest outstanding maturity, its $1 billion of 5.5
percent bonds due March 2040, traded at 130.4 cents on the
dollar to yield 3.73 percent at 3 p.m. in  New York , according to
Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority. The company’s $750 million of 5.2 percent
dollar-denominated notes maturing March 2017 traded at 118.4
cents with a 1.1 percent yield Aug. 10.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley managed the
offering.  To contact the reporter on this story:
