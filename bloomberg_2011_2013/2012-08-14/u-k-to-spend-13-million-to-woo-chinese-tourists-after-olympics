The U.K. will spend 8 million pounds
($13 million) to attract Chinese tourists to take advantage of a
growing middle class in the world’s most populous nation,
Culture Secretary  Jeremy Hunt  said.  The U.K., capitalizing on the success of the London  Olympic
Games  that ended two days ago, is seeking to treble the number
of Chinese visitors to 500,000 a year by 2015, which Hunt said
would lead to more than 500 million pounds in annual extra
visitor spending and create 14,000 extra jobs.  “Only around 150,000 Chinese tourists visited our shores
last year,” Hunt told an audience of tourism workers at the
Tate Modern museum in London today. “The numbers are rising,
but it is still estimated that  France  attracts between 25 and 50
percent more Chinese visitors than the U.K. We simply cannot
afford such a comparatively small share of such an important
market.”  Hunt, who is married to a Chinese woman, has championed
U.K.-Chinese relations. The culture secretary spent more than
2,500 pounds of taxpayers’ money learning Chinese, according to
Freedom of Information requests published in  newspapers  last
year.  The minister, who faced calls for his resignation over his
handling of News Corp.’s 2010 bid for British Sky Broadcasting
Group Plc, said in an interview on July 20 he was now a “hero”
once again and refused to rule himself out as a future prime
minister. He was asserting his position within the Cabinet
before the ministerial reorganization that Prime Minister David Cameron plans for September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
