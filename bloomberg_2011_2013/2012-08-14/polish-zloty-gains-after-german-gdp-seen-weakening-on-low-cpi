The zloty strengthened against the
euro, breaking two days of losses, after  economic growth  in
 Poland ’s main trading partner  Germany  slowed less than
economists forecast.  The zloty gained 0.1 percent to 4.0916 per euro at
10:47 a.m. in Warsaw. The currency has weakened 1.2 percent
since reaching a one-year high on Aug. 6, the biggest loss among
more than 20 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.
The yield on the 10-year government bond rose 2 basis points to
4.978 percent.  German gross domestic product rose 0.3 percent from the
first quarter, when it gained 0.5 percent, the Federal
Statistics Office said in Wiesbaden today. Economists had
predicted a 0.2 percent increase, according to the median of 40
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. Germany is the target for
26 percent of Polish exports.  The zloty could weaken later today if inflation comes in
lower than expected when Poland releases July consumer price
data at 2 p.m., according to a research note published today by
Warsaw-based Pekao SA. Poland’s July inflation rate fell to 4.1
percent from 4.3 percent in June, according to the  median
estimate  of 33 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  “Slowing inflation is crucial to investors’ expectations
for interest rate cuts,” wrote economists at Pekao SA. “If
inflation drops more than the market consensus, expect short-
term yields to fall and the euro-zloty  exchange rate  to
stabilize above 4.10 per euro. Otherwise, we’ll see the zloty
trading at 4.04 to 4.10 and little change in yields.”  Any gain in shorter-maturity bonds could be temporary as
rising global food prices should push up Polish inflation in
August and September, ING Bank economists Rafal Benecki and
Grzegorz Ogonek wrote in a research note today.  The yield on Poland’s two-year government bond due in July
2014 rose 2 basis points to 4.017 percent today.  To contact the reporter on this story
