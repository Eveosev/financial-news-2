Abu Dhabi ’s benchmark stock index
advanced to the highest level in more than four months after
 Dana Gas PJSC (DANA)  and  Abu Dhabi National Energy Co. (TAQA)  posted higher
second-quarter earnings.  Dana Gas, which yesterday said it was committed to finding
a “consensual solution” on a $1 billion Islamic bond due in
two months, rose 2.6 percent and was the most traded stock on
Abu Dhabi’s index. State-run Abu Dhabi National Energy, also
known as Taqa, climbed to the highest since June after quarterly
profit gained 3 percent. The  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  advanced 0.3
percent to 2,553.56, the highest since April 8, at the close in
Abu Dhabi. Dubai’s  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  fell 0.2 percent.  Dana Gas said  second-quarter profit  climbed 46 percent to
181 million dirhams ($46 million) as investment income rose and
income-tax expenses fell. Taqa said  second-quarter net income 
increased to 447 million dirhams from 435 million dirhams a year
earlier.  “Better profit at Dana Gas helped boost sentiment today,”
said Nabil Rantisi, managing director of brokerage at Abu Dhabi-
based Menacorp.  Dana Gas shares have dropped 11 percent this year on
concern over its ability to repay debt and after its biggest
shareholder, Crescent Petroleum Co., said it has no plan to
provide cash to the gas producer. The stock gained the most
since Aug. 5, rising to 40 fils. Taqa shares climbed 1.6 percent
to 1.28 dirhams, the highest close since June 21.  Oil Gains  Crude oil for September delivery gained as much as 0.9
percent to $93.53 a barrel in New York on speculation that
inventories declined for a third week in the U.S., the world’s
biggest crude consumer. Gulf Arab oil exporters, including Qatar
and the United Arab Emirates, supply about a fifth of the
world’s oil.  Persian Gulf states will celebrate the Eid holiday, which
marks the end of Ramadan, next week, with  Saudi Arabia (SABIC) ’s market
closing for business from Aug. 18 through Aug. 22.  In Kuwait,  National Industries Group Holding (NIND)  rallied 5.4
percent, the most since Nov. 22, to 194 fils after the Kuwait-
based investment company said it’ll pay $475 million of Islamic
bonds on maturity. The company last month proposed a four-year
extension.  Kuwait’s  SE Price Index (KWSEIDX)  and the  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index (BGCC200) 
increased 0.2 percent.  Saudi Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX) , Oman’s
 MSM30 Index (MSM30) , Qatar’s QE Index and  Bahrain Bourse All Share Index (BHSEASI) 
gained less than 0.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
