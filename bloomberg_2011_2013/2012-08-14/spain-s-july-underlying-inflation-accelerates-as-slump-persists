Spain ’s underlying inflation
accelerated for a second month in July, even as the economy
slumped further into a recession that has pushed the
unemployment rate to almost 25 percent.  Core consumer inflation , which excludes energy and fresh
food, accelerated to 1.4 percent from 1.3 percent in June, the
National Statistics Institute in  Madrid  said today. Prices fell
0.7 percent from June. Economists forecast an annual gain of 1.3
percent, the median of four estimates in a Bloomberg News survey
showed.  Spain’s recession deepened in the second quarter as the
sovereign-debt crisis worsened, pushing the unemployment rate to
24.8 percent in June. Adding to pressure on consumers, Prime
Minister  Mariano Rajoy  is implementing more than 100 billion
euros ($124 billion) of budget cuts, including an increase in
value-added tax.  Amid weak demand, some retailers may absorb the sales-tax
increase rather than passing it on to customers, Deputy Economy
Minister Fernando Jimenez Latorre said on July 13.  Inditex SA (ITX) ,
the owner of fashion brand Zara, won’t raise prices to reflect
the increase in the main rate to 21 percent from 18 percent, the
Arteixo, Spain-based company has said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
