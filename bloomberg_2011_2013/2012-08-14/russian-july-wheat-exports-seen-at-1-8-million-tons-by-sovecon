Russia , the world’s third-biggest
 wheat  exporter last season, sold 1.8 million metric tons of the
grain abroad in July, more than double the prior month’s
shipments, researcher SovEcon said.  Exports were the second-highest for the month after the
record amount shipped in July 2011, Moscow-based  SovEcon  said on
its website today.  Egypt  and  Turkey  were the biggest buyers,
followed by Israel, Iraq and Georgia, it said.  Russia shipped 2.4 million tons of wheat in July of last
year and 723,100 tons in June 2012, according to Federal Customs
Service figures. Total grain exports in July of this year were
2.07 million tons, Agriculture Ministry data show.  Russia may be able to export 10 million to 12 million tons
of all grains in the current season begun July 1, according to
estimates by Deputy Prime Minister  Arkady Dvorkovich  on Aug. 8.
That compares with the 27.2 million tons shipped in the last
season, Agriculture Ministry figures show.  Wheat exports from Russia were 21.3 million tons in the
2011-12 season, according to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture .
Shipments are set to fall to 11 million tons in the current
period after drought affected fields across the country since
May, according to an  estimate  by the USDA’s Foreign Agriculture
Service in Moscow on July 26.  Wheat for December delivery fell 0.1 percent to $8.75 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade by 11:49 a.m. in Moscow.
Prices are up 34 percent in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
