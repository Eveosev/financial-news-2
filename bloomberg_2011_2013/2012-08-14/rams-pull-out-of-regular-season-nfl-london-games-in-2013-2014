The  St. Louis Rams  have withdrawn
from a commitment to play National Football League games in
London in 2013 and 2014.  The Rams will still play one of their eight regular-season
home games in London this season, facing the  New England
Patriots  on Oct. 28 at Wembley Stadium.  The Rams said they pulled out of the games to focus on
making upgrades to their stadium, the Edward Jones Dome. If the
Rams and the St. Louis Convention and Visitors Commission fail
to meet the NFL’s requirements for a “First Tier” stadium, the
team could get out of its lease and leave St. Louis after the
2014 season.  “Our attention needs to be on the ongoing First Tier
process,” Rams Chief Operating Officer Kevin Demoff said in a
statement. “We have worked closely with the NFL in coming to
this decision and remain key supporters of the international
series and its objectives.”  This season marks the first time that the Rams will play a
regular-season game outside the U.S.  The franchise previously played three American Bowl
preseason games, against the  Denver Broncos  in London in 1987,
against the San Francisco 49ers in Tokyo in 1989 and against the
 Kansas City Chiefs  in Berlin in 1990.  The NFL hasn’t yet said if another team will replace the
Rams in its London games in 2013 and 2014. The Rams tied for the
NFL’s worst record last season at 2-14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
