Gold was set to gain in  New York  on
speculation central banks may take more action to stoke growth.  The euro-area economy contracted in the second quarter
after the worsening debt crisis and tougher budget cuts forced
at least six nations into recessions, the European Union’s
statistics office in Luxembourg said today. Gold reached
$1,629.70 an ounce on Aug. 10, the highest since July 31, on
speculation central banks will need to take more action.  “It looks like the gold market will continue to be held up
by the sentiment of expected central-bank stimulation,” Marex
Spectron Group said in a report today. “The downside risk is
limited.”  Gold for December delivery rose 0.2 percent to $1,615 an
ounce by 8:03 a.m. on the Comex in New York. Bullion for
immediate delivery was 0.2 percent higher at $1,612.60 in
 London .  Holdings in bullion-backed exchange-traded products fell
1.1 metric ton from a record to 2,416.2 tons yesterday,  data 
compiled by Bloomberg show. Gold prices are up 3 percent this
year after 11 consecutive annual increases.  Europe ’s slump is deepening as governments struggle to
restore investor confidence in their ability to plug budget
deficits as some of the region’s largest companies including
Deutsche Bank AG eliminate jobs. In  Germany , investor confidence
unexpectedly dropped for a fourth month in August and the Bank
of  Japan ’s minutes of the July 11-12 meeting released today
cited the euro-area crisis among risks.  Silver Advance  Silver for September delivery rose 0.2 percent to $27.81 an
ounce. Palladium for September delivery gained 0.8 percent to
$579.20 an ounce. Platinum for October delivery was 0.8 percent
higher at $1,404.40 an ounce. Gold’s premium to platinum was at
14.7 percent in London today. It settled at 16 percent
yesterday, the most since at least 1987 based on closing prices,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  At least nine people were killed, including two policemen,
during four days of violent clashes at Lonmin Plc’s mines in
 South Africa ’s North West province. The third-largest platinum
producer’s Marikana complex was operating with low worker
attendance today, Barnard Mokwena, executive vice president of
human capital at Johannesburg-based Lonmin, said today. There
were no incidents of attacks overnight, he said.  To contact the reporters for this story:
