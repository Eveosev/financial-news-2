Bats Global Markets Inc., the third-
largest U.S. stock exchange operator, plans to create a program
to draw orders from retail customers to one of its two markets.  The Lenexa, Kansas-based company is seeking to compete with
the New York Stock Exchange’s initiative to attract buy and sell
requests from individual investors by offering them better
prices than are available to other market participants.  Nasdaq
OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ) , Direct Edge Holdings LLC and Bats have said
they’re working on plans similar to NYSE’s pilot program.  Exchanges are in competition with so-called equity
wholesalers, a category of market makers that executes orders
for individuals sent to them by retail brokers such as  TD
Ameritrade Holding Corp. (AMTD)  and Charles Schwab Corp. Knight Capital
Group Inc., Citadel LLC, UBS AG and Citigroup Inc. are the
largest wholesalers trading orders away from exchanges at prices
that match or improve on the levels offered publicly.  “A significant percentage of the orders of individual
investors are executed over-the-counter,” Bats BYX Exchange
said in its filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. About a third of equities volume takes place away
from exchanges, including orders from individual investors that
can be executed immediately. “The exchange believes that it is
appropriate to create a financial incentive to bring more retail
flow to the public market,” Bats said.  The SEC must approve today’s filing from Bats for it to
become effective.  To contact the reporter on this story:
