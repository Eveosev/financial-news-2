Netflix Inc. (NFLX) , the video-streaming
service, gained after Bank of America Corp. raised its rating on
the stock to buy from underperform.  Netflix, based in Los Gatos, California, rose 3.1 percent
to $61.76 at the close  New York  time. The  stock  has dropped 11
percent this year.  International expansion, smarter spending on content and
rising domestic profit, combined with the drop in the stock
after second-quarter results makes Netflix a compelling
purchase, Bank of America analysts led by Nat Schindler said
today in a note. They have a $72 price target on the stock.  Netflix plunged 25 percent on July 25, the most in nine
months, after the company said reaching its full-year goal of
adding 7 million new U.S. users would be “challenging” if the
current quarter’s most optimistic targets aren’t met.  To contact the reporter on this story:
