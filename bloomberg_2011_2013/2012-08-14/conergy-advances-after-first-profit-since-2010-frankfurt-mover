Conergy AG (CGYK) , a German solar-energy
company, had its biggest gain in three months after posting its
first operating profit in almost two years.  Conergy surged as much as 8.4 percent, the steepest
intraday gain since May 24, after reporting earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of 0.5 million
euros ($620,000) in the second quarter. That was the first
positive result since 2010.  “We continue to work hard on bringing Conergy back on
track and the results are an important milestone on our way,”
Chief Executive Officer Philip Comberg said in the statement.
“It clearly shows that our strategic realignment and improved
cost structures yield results.”  Conergy, once  Germany ’s largest solar company, and its
domestic counterparts are under pressure as subsidies fall at
home amid competition from Chinese rivals that has depressed
margins and panel prices.  Conergy, based in Hamburg, has been cutting jobs, halting
production of wafers and cells, and focusing on end-product
modules, power-plant development and services in a bid to become
profitable.  The shares were up 3.4 percent at 49 euro cents as of 9:40
a.m. local time, valuing the company at 78.8 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
