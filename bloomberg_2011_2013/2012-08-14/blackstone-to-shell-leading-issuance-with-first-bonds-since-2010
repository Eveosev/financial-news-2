Corporate issuers from  Blackstone
Group LP (BX)  to  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  are leading offerings of about
$12 billion in the U.S. by selling their first bonds in two
years with yields at about record lows.  Shell,  Europe ’s largest oil producer, raised $2.5 billion
in a three-part offering through its international finance  unit ,
and New York-based Blackstone borrowed for the first time since
September 2010 with a $650 million sale that included its first
30-year obligations, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Today’s dollar-denominated  offerings  exceed the daily average of
$6.7 billion this month through last week, which was 8 percent
higher than in July.  Companies including Philip Morris International Inc. and
American Express Co. are exploiting investment-grade borrowing
costs that dropped to an unprecedented 3.03 percent this month,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. Investors
are giving companies the opportunity to issue low-cost debt by
plowing money into the securities that yield more than U.S.
government bonds, according to  James Lee  of Calvert Investments.  “The capital markets window is wide open,” Lee, an
analyst at Bethesda, Maryland-based Calvert, which manages about
$12.5 billion, said in a telephone interview. “Pension funds
and insurance companies are looking for yield. There’s just
very, very strong demand out there, particularly for high-grade
names.”  Yields Decline  Average yields on investment-grade debt have declined 79
basis points this year to 3.11 percent, Bank of America Merrill
Lynch index data show. The measure was 3.64 percent a year ago.  Blackstone, the world’s largest private-equity firm, sold
$400 million of 4.75 percent debt due February 2023 that yielded
325 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries and $250
million of 6.25 percent, 30-year bonds with a 375 basis-point
spread, Bloomberg data show. Proceeds will be used for general
corporate purposes, Blackstone said today in a release.  The firm’s $400 million of 5.875 percent senior unsecured
notes maturing March 2021 traded at a high of 109.9 cents on the
dollar on July 23 to yield 4.48 percent, according to Trace, the
bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority.  Shell Issue  Shell sold $1 billion of 1.125 percent, five-year bonds
with a 50 basis-point spread, an equal portion of 2.375 percent
debt due in 2022 that yielded 70 basis points more than
benchmarks and $500 million of 3.625 percent, 30-year
obligations with a spread of 82 basis points. Shell, which last
issued dollar obligations due in three decades in March 2010,
will use proceeds for general corporate purposes, The Hague-
based  company  said today in a regulatory filing.  Shell’s longest outstanding maturity, its $1 billion of 5.5
percent bonds due March 2040, traded at 130.4 cents on the
dollar to yield 3.73 percent at 3 p.m. in  New York , Trace data
show.  Other borrowers include  Philip Morris , the world’s largest
publicly traded tobacco company, which raised $2.25 billion
divided evenly among five-, 10- and 30-year bonds, and New York-
based American Express, which offered an additional $750 million
of its 1.75 percent bonds due in 2015 first sold June 7.  DaVita Inc. (DVA) , the dialysis services provider whose biggest
shareholder is billionaire  Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway
Inc., sold $1.25 billion of 5.75 percent, 10-year notes with a
404 basis-point spread to help fund its $4.4 billion acquisition
of HealthCare Partners. Peter Grauer, the chairman of Bloomberg
LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News, has served on DaVita’s
board of directors since 1994.  Cenovus Energy Inc. (CVE) , the oil-sands producer spun off by
 Encana Corp. (ECA)  in 2009, issued $1.25 billion in a two-part
offering of 10- and 30-year securities.  To contact the reporters on this story:
