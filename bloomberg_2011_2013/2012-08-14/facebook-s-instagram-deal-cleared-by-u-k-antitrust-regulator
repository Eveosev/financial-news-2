Facebook Inc. (FB) , the world’s biggest
social-networking company, was cleared by Britain’s Office of
Fair Trading to complete its proposed $1 billion purchase of the
mobile photo-sharing application company Instagram.  The watchdog decided not to refer the deal to the U.K.
Competition Commission, where it would have been subjected to a
full investigation, the OFT said in a statement on its website
today. Facebook said in April it would buy the 2-year-old
startup to lure users of mobile devices.  U.S. regulators haven’t made a decision on the proposed
deal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
