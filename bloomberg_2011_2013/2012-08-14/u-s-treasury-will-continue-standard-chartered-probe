The U.S. Treasury Department said
its investigation of Standard Chartered Plc will continue after
the bank settled a  New York  money-laundering probe for $340

law enforcement partners to hold Standard Chartered accountable
for any sanctionable activity that occurred,” the Treasury said
in a statement sent by e-mail today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
