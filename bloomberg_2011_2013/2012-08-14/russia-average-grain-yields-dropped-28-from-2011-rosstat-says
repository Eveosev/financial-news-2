Russia ’s grain yields are 28 percent
smaller than a year earlier after drought curbed production,
according to the Federal State Statistics Service.  The average national yield was 2.3 metric tons a hectare
(2.47 acres) as of Aug. 1, down from 3.2 tons a year earlier,
the agency, known as Rosstat, said in an e-mailed statement
today. The Krasnodar region, Russia’s biggest grain-growing
area, reported a yield of 4.1 tons a hectare, down from 5.6 tons
a year earlier, it said. Stavropol, the second-biggest grower,
had yields of 2.4 tons, down from 4.1 tons in 2011, and Rostov,
the third-biggest region, was down to 2.4 tons from 3 tons,
Rosstat said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
