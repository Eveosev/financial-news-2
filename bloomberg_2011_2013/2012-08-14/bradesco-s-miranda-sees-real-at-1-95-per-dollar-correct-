(Corrects Miranda’s title to managing director.)  The real will strengthen to 1.95 per
dollar by yearend, according to Leandro de Miranda, managing
director and head of fixed income at Banco Bradesco BBI SA. The
outlook for a stronger currency will encourage more local debt
sales, and Bradesco is in talks with two large companies to sell
bonds denominated in reais, he said at the Bloomberg Brazil
Economic Summit in Rio de Janeiro.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
