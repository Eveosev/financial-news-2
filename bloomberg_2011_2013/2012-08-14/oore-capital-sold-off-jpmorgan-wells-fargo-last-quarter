Moore Capital Management LP, Louis Moore Bacon’s hedge fund, sold its stakes in  JPMorgan Chase &
Co. (JPM) ,  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  and U.S. Bancorp last quarter as
financial companies led declines in U.S. stocks.  The hedge fund sold 6.47 million shares of New York-based
JPMorgan, 6.83 million shares of Wells Fargo in San Francisco,
and 5.15 million shares of Minneapolis-based U.S.Bancorp,

million at the end of the first quarter.  Financial companies lost 7.3 percent in the second quarter,

Poor’s 500 Index.  Hedge funds  Eton Park Capital Management LP,
TPG-Axon Capital Management LP and Viking Global Investors LP
also cut their holdings of financial stocks in the period.  Eton Park, the New York hedge fund run by Eric Mindich,
sold 5.5 million shares of  Citigroup Inc. (C) , its entire stake,

filing.  As some hedge funds divested their bank stakes, London-
based Odey Asset Management LLP, run by  Crispin Odey , added to

companies its three largest U.S. stock holdings at the end of
the second quarter.  The hedge fund bought 269,373 shares of Wells Fargo,

to give back $2 billion, or 25 percent of his main hedge fund,
to investors, saying it may be too big for him to achieve past
returns as “liquidity and opportunities have become more
constrained.”  Moore, which is based in New York, added 275,000 shares of
the iShares iBoxx High Yield  Corporate Bond (HYG)  Fund in the quarter,
valued at $25.1 million as of June 30, and 120,000 shares of
