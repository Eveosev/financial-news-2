Ciena Corp. (CIEN) , a maker of equipment
and software for telecommunications and cable providers, fell
the most in a month after an FBR Capital Markets analyst
downgraded the stock, citing increased competition.  The  shares  decreased 7 percent to $16.65 at the close in
New York, the biggest decline since July 11. The stock has
gained 38 percent this year.  Scott Thompson , an analyst at FBR Capital Markets,
downgraded the Linthicum, Maryland-based company  today  to market
perform, the equivalent of a hold rating, from outperform. In a
research note, Thompson said  Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) ’s efforts to
merge its optical and routing platforms are making the equipment
market more competitive. He maintained a 12-month target price
of $18 a share.  “While we expect Ciena to continue to respond well to
several positive catalysts, we remain increasingly more
concerned about the negative,” Thompson wrote. “Given the run
the stock has had, move to the sidelines until we have more
visibility into what appears to be a rapidly changing
competitive environment.”  David Dixon, another analyst at FBR Capital Markets, said
in a separate  note  today that telecommunications carriers
 Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ)  and AT&T Inc. are reassessing
spending based on weaker domestic demand. Ciena will report
fiscal third-quarter  earnings  later this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
