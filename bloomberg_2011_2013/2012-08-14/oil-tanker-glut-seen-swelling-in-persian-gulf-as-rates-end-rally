A  surplus  of oil tankers seeking
cargoes in the  Persian Gulf  expanded, curbing an advance in
charter rates for the vessels.  There are 20 percent more very large crude carriers for
hire over the next 30 days than there are cargoes, according to
the median estimate of seven shipbrokers and  owners (TANKER)  surveyed by
Bloomberg News today. A week ago, the excess was 16.5 percent.  The cost of chartering the ships fell to 36.58 Worldscale
points yesterday, snapping six days of gains, according to data
from the  Baltic Exchange  in London. The ships are losing $4,648
daily, according to the bourse, whose calculations don’t take
account of speed alterations that can boost the vessels’
earnings by lowering their fuel consumption.  Owners are contending with vessel supply that’s expanding
faster than trade. The transportation capacity of the global
VLCC fleet will swell 6.9 percent to 188 million deadweight
tons, according to  Clarkson Plc (CKN) , the world’s largest shipbroker.
Demand for the vessels will grow 4.7 percent, it anticipates.  Worldscale points are a percentage of a nominal rate, or
flat rate, for more than 320,000 specific routes. Flat rates for
very voyage, quoted in U.S. dollars a ton, are revised annually
by the Worldscale Association in London to reflect changing fuel
costs, port tariffs and exchange rates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
