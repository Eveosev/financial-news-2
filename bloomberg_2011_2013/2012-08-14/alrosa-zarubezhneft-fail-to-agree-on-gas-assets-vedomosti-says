OAO Alrosa, a Russian diamond miner,
failed to reach agreement on selling natural-gas assets to
state-run  OAO Zarubezhneft (ZRNFT) , Vedomosti reported, citing
unidentified people familiar with the matter.  Alrosa owns Geotransgaz and Urengoy Gas Co., which have
combined 187 billion cubic meters of gas reserves, according to
the newspaper. Alrosa said in January the assets were “non-
core” and it planned to sell them to Zarubezhneft, an oil and
gas producer.  The parties failed to agree on price, as Alrosa was asking
for as much as $1.2 billion, Vedomosti said, adding that the
diamond miner is in talks with other potential investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
