The price of  Kenya ’s benchmark AA
coffee grade fell 6.1 percent to $275.23 a 50-kilogram bag at an
auction today, the first after a four-week recess, the Nairobi
Coffee Exchange said.  The average price for the top grade dropped from $292.99 at
the last sale on July 18, the board said in an e-mailed
statement today from the capital, Nairobi. Supplies of the grade
increased to 1,651 bags from 1,086 bags, it said. The average
price for all the beans sold climbed to $169 a bag from $166.37,
the board said. Supplies of all grades fell 28 percent to 23,333
bags, the exchange said.  “On the whole prices were high because of competition for
the beans after the recess,” Kizito Keya, a trader at Mumba
Coffee Ltd., said by phone from the city.  The following are details of today’s auction in U.S.
