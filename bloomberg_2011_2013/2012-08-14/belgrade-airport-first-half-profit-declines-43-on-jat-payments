Aerodrom Nikola Tesla AD (AERO) , Serbia’s
main airport, said first-half profit declined 43 percent from a
year earlier because of a failure by JAT Airways to pay for
services.  Net income fell to 495.2 million dinars ($5.2 million) from
874.1 million dinars even as the number of passengers rose 11
percent to 1.48 million and flights increased 1.8 percent to
21,361, the government majority-owned operator said in a
regulatory filing to the  Belgrade Stock Exchange .  JAT, Serbia’s state-owned flag carrier, accounted for more
than a half of all flights and owes almost 684 million dinars to
the airport, the company said.  Pretax profit fell almost 45 percent to 521.6 million
dinars. Sales were little changed at 2.92 billion dinars, the
airport said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
