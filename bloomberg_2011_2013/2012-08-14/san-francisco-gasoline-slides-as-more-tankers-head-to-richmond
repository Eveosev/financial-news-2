Spot gasoline in San Francisco
weakened to its smallest premium since before a fire at  Chevron
Corp. (CVX) ’s Richmond refinery as  oil tankers  bearing intermediate
feedstock sailed to the plant.  At least four vessels from Italy, Japan, Argentina and
Algeria are on their way to the Northern California refinery
with possibly as much as 1.8 million barrels of cargo such as
vacuum gasoil and  fuel oil , according to Bloomberg calculations
based in the ships’ capacities.  The material may provide a feedstock source for downstream
units that was lost when Chevron shut the plant’s only crude
unit after the Aug. 6 fire. Other parts of the refinery are
operating and making transportation fuels at reduced rates,
Melissa Ritchie, a Richmond-based spokeswoman for the refinery,
said in an e-mailed statement.  California-blend gasoline in San Francisco narrowed 10
cents to 22.5 cents a gallon above futures traded on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange  at 1:35 p.m. New York time, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the smallest premium since
the day of the fire.  California-blend gasoline in  Los Angeles  weakened 4.5 cents
to 14 cents over New York futures. The premium of conventional,
87-octane gasoline in Portland, Oregon, narrowed 0.5 cent to
22.5 cents.  California-blend diesel in San Francisco gained 5.5 cents
to 25 cents over heating oil futures in New York. The same fuel
in Los Angeles strengthened 2.5 cents to a premium of 21.5
cents. Low-sulfur diesel in Portland widened its premium 2 cents
to 31 cents a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
