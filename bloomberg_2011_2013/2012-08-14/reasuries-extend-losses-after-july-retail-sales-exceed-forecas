Treasuries fell after U.S. retail
sales rose for the first time in four months in July and
exceeded forecasts, damping demand for the safety of  U.S.
government debt .  Benchmark 10-year note yields  reached  the highest level
since May as the consumer-spending data and the Aug. 3 report of
stronger-than-forecast jobs gains reduced speculation the
 Federal Reserve  will add to its monetary stimulus.  U.S. debt 
fell earlier after the German economy expanded in the second
quarter at a faster pace than analysts forecast and the French
economy unexpectedly avoided a contraction.  “Today’s data, combined with the employment report, makes
it harder for the Fed to do another round of quantitative
easing,” said Gary Pollack, who manages $12 billion as head of
fixed-income trading at Deutsche Bank AG’s Private Wealth
Management unit in New York. With the Fed buying so much long-
term debt “yields are much lower than they should be.”  The benchmark 10-year yield rose eight basis points, or
0.08 percentage point, to 1.74 percent at 5 p.m. in  New York ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 1.625 percent
note due in August 2022 fell 21/32, or $6.56 per $1,000 face
amount, to 98 31/32. The yield is the highest since May 29.  The 10-year note has fallen seven times in the last eight
days. Treasury 10-year yields have risen from a record low 1.379
percent on July 25.  Yield Difference  The gap between yields on Treasuries maturing in two and 30
years reached 2.56 percentage points, the most since May 29, and
is up from 2.24 percentage points on July 25, the lowest since
January 2009.  The Fed bought $4.6 billion in Treasuries with maturities
of eight to 10 years today, according to the Fed Bank of New
York website. The purchases are part of the central bank’s
effort to support the economy by putting downward pressure on
long-term  interest rates .  The U.S. central bank has held its target for overnight
bank lending in a range of zero to 0.25 percent since 2008 and
plans to keep it there at least through late 2014 to stimulate
the world’s biggest economy. The Fed also bought $2.3 trillion
of mortgage and Treasury debt from 2008 to 2011 in two rounds of
so-called quantitative easing.  The 0.8 percent retail sales advance followed a 0.7 percent
decrease in June that was weaker than first reported, Commerce
Department figures showed today in  Washington . Economists
projected a 0.3 percent rise, according to the median forecast
in a Bloomberg survey. Sales excluding automobiles also climbed
0.8 percent.  Economic Data  “Tactically, it makes it tough to come in and buy bonds,”
said Larry Dyer, a U.S. interest rate strategist with HSBC
Holdings Plc in New York, one of 21 primary dealers that trade
with the Fed. “It’s a very good number, but it’s just one
month’s worth of data.”  Payrolls rose 163,000 in July following a revised 64,000
rise in June that was less than initially reported, Labor
Department figures showed Aug. 3.  The pickup in retail sales last month followed a quarter in
which household spending grew at the slowest pace in a year.
Consumer purchases, about 70 percent of the economy, expanded at
a 1.5 percent annual rate from April to June, according to
Commerce Department data.  “The retail sales number would suggest there was some
rebound in July from somewhat depressed June levels,” said
Donald Ellenberger, who oversees about $10 billion as co-head of
government and mortgage-backed securities at Federated Investors
in Pittsburgh.  Real Yields  The 10-year yield surpassed the level of U.S. consumer-
price increases. U.S. consumer-price inflation slowed to 1.6
percent in July from a year earlier, versus June’s 1.7 percent
reading, according to a Bloomberg survey of 40 economists before
the Labor Department report tomorrow.  Expectations for inflation have risen, according to yields
on Treasuries that protect investors from the impact of
inflation. The difference between 10-year yields on Treasury
Inflation-Protected Securities and conventional U.S. government
securities widened to 2.28 percentage points, near the most
since April and is up from 2.05 percent on July 12. The spread
represents the expected rate of inflation for the life of the
debt.  The  producer price index  rose 0.3 percent after an increase
of 0.1 percent in June, the Labor Department reported today in
Washington. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 78
economists called for a 0.2 percent gain.  Core inflation , which
excludes volatile food and energy prices, climbed 0.4 percent,
the most since January.  Market Focus  “I don’t think one number is a trend,” said  Ray Remy ,
head of fixed income in New York at Daiwa Capital Markets
America Inc., a primary dealer. “The market’s been focused on
 Europe  as well as a weakening U.S. economy.” German bunds
“seem to be in a bit of a retreat today, and our market is
going down in sympathy.”  German 10-year yields rose seven basis points to 1.47
percent while  Spain ’s bonds rose on speculation the nation is
edging closer to asking European policy makers to buy its debt
after Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  reiterated he will act in
best interests of his country.  The yield on 10-year Spanish bonds dropped 12 basis points
to 6.72 percent. Italian 10-year bond yields declined five basis
points to 5.85 percent, after rising to 5.95 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
