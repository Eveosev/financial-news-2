Nigeria ’s naira snapped four days of
gains, paring an earlier rise, as foreign-exchange sales from
 oil companies  operating in the West African nation waned.  The currency of Africa’s biggest oil producer fell 0.3
percent to 158.2 a dollar as of 2:45 p.m. on the  interbank
market  in Lagos, the commercial capital. The naira has risen 2.6
percent this year, the strongest performance in Africa after
Zambia’s kwacha, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The supply from oil companies is drying up and as such
the rates are moving up,” Femi Okegbenro, the chief dealer at
First Securities Discount House Ltd. in Lagos, said in an e-
mailed reply to questions today. “The naira had gained on the
back of oil companies sales of dollars” and “we expect to see
more volatility in the foreign exchange market from such
periodic flows.”  The naira had its best five-day performance in more than a
year last week as the  Central Bank of Nigeria  increased lenders’
reserve requirements to 12 percent of total assets from 8
percent after its monetary policy committee meeting on July 24,
when it held  interest rates  at 12 percent. A week later, it
restricted access to twice-a-week foreign-exchange auctions to
prevent dealers from buying foreign currency using naira
purchased from the central bank at a discount.  Yields on the West African nation’s 16 percent domestic
debt due 2019 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point,
to 16.49 percent, according to yesterday’s prices on the
Financial Markets Dealers Association website. Borrowing costs
on the West African nation’s $500 million of Eurobonds due 2021
were little changed at 5.14 percent today.  Ghana ’s cedi rose 0.1 percent to 1.951 a dollar in Accra,
the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
