Slovak economic  growth  slowed in the
second quarter to 2.7 percent from a year earlier as the euro
regionâ€™s debt crisis damped demand.  The result compares with a 3 percent increase in the
previous three-month period and a median estimate by five
economists in a Bloomberg survey for a 2.6 percent expansion. On
a quarterly basis, gross domestic product advanced a seasonally
adjusted 0.7 percent, the same as the revised figure for the
previous three months, the Slovak Statistical Office in
Bratislava said on its  website  today.  The economy in the eastern European Union country, which
adopted the euro in 2009, is slowing as the debt crisis in the
region cuts demand for exports. The government expects the
economy to advance 2.5 percent for the whole of 2012, down from
3.3 percent in the previous year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
