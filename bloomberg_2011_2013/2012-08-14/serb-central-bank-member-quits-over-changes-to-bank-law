A member of the National Bank of
 Serbia ’s governing council resigned today, joining the chairman
and two other colleagues who stepped down a week ago over
changes to the central bank law.  Kosta Josifidis quit his post saying that “essential
changes” to the concept of the central bank’s function entails
changes in personnel.  Chairman Bosko Zivkovic and council members Milojko Arsic
and Zorica Mladenovic resigned on Aug. 7 saying the new amended
central bank law “grossly violates basic internationally
accepted principles of the autonomy and independence of a
central bank from the government or individual interest
groups.” Governor Dejan Soskic and vice-governor Bojan Markovic
also resigned.  Lawmakers adopted the new law on Aug. 4, restoring
parliamentary control over the central bank, a move criticized
both by the  International Monetary Fund  and the European Union,
even as Serbia seeks to discuss a bailout program with the IMF
and continue on its path to joining the EU. They appointed
Jorgovanka Tabakovic, vice president of the ruling Progressive
Party, as the central bank’s new governor on Aug. 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
