Gulf Coast  gasoline strengthened as
U.S. inventories were expected to drop and a fire at a refinery
in Mexico may add to exports from the region.  Gasoline supplies probably fell 2 million barrels to 204.1
million, according to the median estimate of 10 analysts polled
by Bloomberg. Inventories are above the five-year average for
 this time  of year, data compiled by Bloomberg showed. The U.S.
Energy Department is scheduled to release the data tomorrow at
10:30 a.m. in  Washington .  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the Gulf Coast narrowed
its discount 0.25 cent to 10.25 cents a gallon versus futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 4:01 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery gained
1.6 cents to $2.9017.  A fire at Petroleos Mexicanos’ Madero refinery in  Mexico ’s
northern state of Tamaulipas may draw more U.S. fuel exports.
Production from the 190,000-barrel-a-day plant is reduced by
about 10 percent, said a press official who declined to be
identified citing the Mexico City-based company’s policy.  Pemex is evaluating the damage to a hydrodesulfurization
unit that caught fire last night and a timeline for the repairs
is expected to be ready later today, the person said.  Pemex is the world’s fourth-largest crude producing company
and Mexico is the biggest importer of U.S. petroleum products.
The nation imported 514,000 barrels a day of fuel in May,
accounting for 16 percent of  U.S. fuel exports , according to the
U.S. Energy Department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
