When the 2012  Olympic Games  came to a close on Sunday, India, the world's second-most populous country, stood a distant 55th on the  overall medals table , surpassed by Jamaica, Belarus and  New Zealand  among others. To many Indians, this was yet another sign of all the troubles that beset Indian sports other than cricket (the country's most popular game and, with Bollywood, its most enduring national obsession). These handicaps include: the absence of world-class facilities and support for the country's few top athletes; the inefficiencies of the country's bloated and supine sporting bureaucracy; farther down the ladder, the lack of sporting facilities in schools; and the absence of a culture of sporting excellence in general. Some Indians compared India's total of two silver and four bronze medals unfavorably to that of  China , which finished second with 87 medals in all. But that would be to miss the point.  India 's six medals at the London Olympics were its biggest-ever return from the event, doubling the three from Beijing in 2008. To a country starved of sporting success, these victories, even if insignificant in a global context, were something to be savored, not least because they were a reward for the  arduous struggles  waged by many of the victorious athletes in a largely unsympathetic environment. Earlier this month on World View,  Adam Minter wrote  of the unfortunate spectacle of Chinese weightlifter Wu Jingbiao apologizing for "disgracing the motherland" after he only won a silver in his category when he was heavily favored to win gold. The price of an Olympic silver or bronze was far better appreciated in India, which has won only nine golds in Olympic history -- eight of them decades ago in men's field hockey, a sport which it dominated in the first half of the 20th century. Further, the six medals of 2012 were a sign of how a long-term approach to success at the Olympics, devised and implemented by bodies other than India's specialist sports federations, is beginning to pay off. Most of the Indian athletes who won medals are the beneficiaries of assistance from  Olympic Gold Quest , an organization formed by the former Indian sportsmen Prakash Paduone and Geet Sethi to make world-class facilities and individualized training available to the most talented Indian athletes. OGQ is now just one of several corporate-funded organizations that seek to prove that India need not always be a laggard on the world sporting arena. In a piece published in June called  "How  Corporates Are Fuelling India's Gold Quest At The Olympics,"  Sanjiv Shankaran, Goutam Das and Anilesh Mahajan wrote: Geet Sethi, one of the OGQ founders,  wrote this week in the Deccan Chronicle  about the work being done by his organization, and focused in particular on the story of  Mary Kom , the pint-sized boxer who became a household name in India this month after she won a bronze in a weight category higher than the one she was used to fighting in: The question of why some countries win so many more Olympic medals than others is also one of great interest in India, which has always found itself mocked for its sporting insignificance relative to its population and its self-image as a rising world power. As Anirudh Sharma and Eric Haglund wrote in a fascinating paper called  "Why Do Some Countries Win More Olympic Medals?"  in 2008: "India’s one-sixth share in the world’s population translated into a 1/929 share in 2004 Olympic medals. While  Australia  won 2.46 medals per one-million population and Cuba won 2.39 medals per one-million population, India brought up the bottom of this international chart, winning a mere 0.0009 medals per one-million population. Why does the average Indian count for so little?" Sharma and Haglund explain, "In this article, we explore the concept of effectively participating population, arguing that not everyone in a country has equal access to competitive sports -– or for that matter, to other arenas, including the political and economic ones. Low medal tallies can arise both because a country has very few people and because very few of its people effectively participate." Conversely, certain kinds of Olympic success are also not to be set as benchmarks without a broader view of the complications and tensions involved, as  Shekhar Gupta observed in the Indian Express : For much of my childhood -- years when India drew a blank at the Olympics in 1988 ( Seoul ) and 1992 (Barcelona) -- success at the games was thought to be entirely beyond India, and Indians took a peculiar self-flagellating pleasure in their quadrennial reminders of this. Nor was it being clear that anything significant was being done in the years between successive editions of the Games to change this. The real achievement of India's 2012 Olympics challenge seems to be the reversal of this negative mindset once and for all, and the reassuring discovery that, every day between 2012 and 2016, success at the next Games in  Brazil  will be plotted relentlessly in athletics camps, gymnasiums, courts, stadiums -- and in boardrooms.
