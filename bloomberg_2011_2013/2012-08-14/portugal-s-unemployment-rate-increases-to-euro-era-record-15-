Portugal ’s jobless rate rose to a
euro-era record 15 percent in the three months through June as
the country’s economy contracted for a seventh quarter.  The unemployment rate increased from 14.9 percent in the
first three months and 12.1 percent in the second quarter of
2011, the Lisbon-based National Statistics Institute said today
in an e-mailed statement.  The government forecasts unemployment will increase to 15.5
percent for all of 2012 and to 15.9 percent in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
