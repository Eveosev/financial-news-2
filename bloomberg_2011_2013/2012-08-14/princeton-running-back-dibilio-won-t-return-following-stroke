Chuck Dibilio, last year’s Ivy League Football Rookie of the
Year, won’t return for the fall semester as he recovers from a
stroke, the New Jersey school said.  Dibilio, who turns 20 tomorrow, has been rehabilitating
since suffering the stroke on Jan. 19.  “Chuck has made amazing progress, and hopefully he will
make even more in the next few months,” Bob Surace, Princeton’s
football coach, said in a statement on the school’s website. “I
believe he is making the best decision for his future, and I’m
very hopeful we will see Chuck back on campus as a student in
the spring.”  Dibilio rushed for 1,068 yards last season, the most by any
true freshman in Ivy League history and the sixth-most by any
Princeton running back in a season. Princeton had a 1-9 record,
including 1-6 in league play.  To contact the reporter on this story:
