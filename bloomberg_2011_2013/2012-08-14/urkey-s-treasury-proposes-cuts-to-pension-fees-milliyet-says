The Turkish Treasury proposed a
draft law reducing management and entry fees charged by private
pension companies and will notify the providers this week,
 Milliyet  reported, without saying where it got the information.  The ceiling on management fees will be cut to 2 percent
from 8 percent and the fund management charge lowered to 2.2
percent from 3.65 percent, the Istanbul-based newspaper said.
The entrance fee will be cut to 10 percent of the gross monthly
minimum wage, which is now 940 Turkish liras ($525), from 50
percent, according to Milliyet.  To contact the reporter on this story:
