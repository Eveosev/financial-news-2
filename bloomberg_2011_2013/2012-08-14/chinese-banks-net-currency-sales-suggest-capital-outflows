China’s financial institutions sold
a net 3.8 billion  yuan  ($600 million) of foreign currency in
July, suggesting capital outflows after economic growth slowed
to a three-year-low.  Yuan  positions  at financial institutions accumulated from
foreign-exchange purchases stood at 25.658 trillion yuan at the
end of July, down from 25.661 trillion yuan in June, People’s
Bank of China data showed today.  The data help explain “tightness” in the  interbank market 
and add to arguments for a cut in banks’ reserve requirements,
said Dariusz Kowalczyk, a Hong Kong-based economist at Credit
Agricole CIB. The central bank and foreign-exchange regulator
played down risks of an exodus of funds after the country
reported a record $71.4 billion capital-account deficit in the
April-June period.  Today’s figures suggest the central bank may have
intervened in support of the currency last month for the first
time since April, which is “very unusual,” Kowalczyk said in a
note today. “Re-acceleration of growth is needed” for Chinese
companies to gain confidence in the outlook for the yuan and
help the currency turn around, he said.  Any net capital inflows or outflows in the second half will
be small, the PBOC said in a quarterly report released Aug. 2.  The yuan strengthened less than 0.1 percent today to 6.3586
in  Shanghai . The currency has weakened about 1 percent this year.  --Zhou Xin. Editors: Scott Lanman,  John Liu   To contact the reporter on this story:
