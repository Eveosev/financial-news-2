Wheat futures capped the biggest
three-session slump in 14 months on signs that this year’s
drought-fueled rally is eroding demand for grain from the U.S.,
the world’s largest exporter. Corn and soybeans declined.  Egypt , the largest wheat importer, said today it bought
60,000 metric tons from  Russia  at $313 a ton and an equal amount
from Ukraine at $313.88 a ton. Cargill Inc. had offered to sell
U.S. supplies for $344.53 a ton, according to two traders with
direct knowledge of the tender. Wheat futures rose as much as 51
percent since mid-June as drought damaged crops.  “U.S. wheat is not competitive on the world markets,”  Roy Huckabay , an executive vice president for the Linn Group in
 Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “Wheat’s premium to
corn will also slow demand from domestic livestock producers.”  Wheat futures for December delivery slumped 2 percent to
close at $8.5825 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. The most-active contract dropped 7.4 percent since Aug.
9, the biggest three-session slide since June 2011. Wheat is a
substitute for corn in animal-feed rations.  The grain also fell because rain may improve conditions for
crops in Australia,  Argentina  and parts of the southern U.S.
Great Plains, Huckabay said.  Above-average moisture may fall in parts of Nebraska,
Kansas and  Missouri  from Aug. 19 to Aug. 23, boosting soil
moisture for planting winter-wheat crops, Commodity Weather
Group LLC said in a report today.  Corn futures for delivery in December fell 0.4 percent to
$7.89 a bushel in Chicago, capping a three-day drop of 4.2
percent. The most-active contract reached a record $8.49 on Aug.
10, after the government said the worst U.S. drought since 1956
reduced yields to the lowest since 1995.  Soybean futures for July delivery slid 0.2 percent to
$15.98 a bushel on the CBOT. The price touched a record $16.915
on July 23.  Corn is the most valuable U.S. crop, followed by soybeans,
hay and wheat, USDA data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
