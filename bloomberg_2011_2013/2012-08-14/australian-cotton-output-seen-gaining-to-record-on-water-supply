Cotton production in  Australia , set
to be the world’s second-biggest shipper, may climb to a record
as water availability boosts yields even as the planted area
declines, according to Rabobank International.  The harvest may total 4.95 million bales in 2012-2013, the
bank said in a report today. Production was more than 4.5
million bales in 2011-2012, an all-time high, it said. A bale in
Australia weighs 227 kilograms (500 pounds).  Cotton fell 67 percent since reaching a record in 2011,
reducing costs for clothing retailers including Gap Inc., as
supply increased and slowing global growth hurt demand. The  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  on Aug. 10 cut its outlook for global
demand 0.8 percent to 108.16 million, 480-pound bales, while
boosting the outlook for world stockpiles by 3.1 percent.  “Having water available at a dry time will spur the
industry,” Rabobank analyst Tracey Allen said in an interview
at a cotton conference on the  Gold Coast  in Queensland state
today. “It really is the irrigated crops that will get us
through the season.”  La Nina-linked rains in parts of eastern Australia have
boosted water supply. Over the past fortnight, indicators such
as the Southern Oscillation Index have shown renewed trends
consistent with the early stages of an  El Nino , which brings
drier-than-normal weather to areas in the country’s east,
Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology said on its website today.
Temperatures may exceed El Nino thresholds before the end of
September, it said.  Cotton Australia  About 34,000 hectares (84,014 acres), or 30 percent of the
2011-2012 dryland cotton area, may be used for alternatives in
2012-2013 on lower prices and the outlook for drier-than-normal
weather, according to Rabobank’s report. Australian farmers will
sow the crop from about October.  Output in 2012-2013 may be about 4 million bales, according
to Adam Kay, Chief Executive Officer of producers’ group  Cotton
Australia . Production may drop 20 percent from 2011-2012 as
farmers curb plantings on lower prices, he said in an interview
on the Gold Coast today.  “We’ll see a very slight reduction in irrigated crops in a
couple of areas, but most are maintaining area,” Kay said.
“There may be a reduction in dryland crop due to the prices.”  Cotton for December delivery climbed as much as 1.6 percent
72.84 cents per pound on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York  and was at
72.28 cents at 1:36 p.m. Singapore time.  The U.S. is set to be the world’s biggest exporter of
cotton in 2012-2013 followed by Australia, according to the USDA.  To contact the reporter for this story:
