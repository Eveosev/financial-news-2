Kenya ’s shilling declined,
retreating from a two-week high as businesses took advantage of
the currency’s gains to buy dollars.  The currency of  East Africa ’s largest economy depreciated
as much as 0.8 percent to 84.25 a dollar and was trading 0.3
percent lower at 83.85 by 5:12 p.m. in Nairobi, the capital. The
shilling reached 83.60 yesterday, the strongest since July 30.  “The shilling has weakened on increased demand from
businesses trying to accumulate dollars as they take advantage
of the gains made by the shilling yesterday,” John Muli, a
dealer at Nairobi-based African Banking Corp., said in a phone
interview today.  The Central Bank of Kenya sold 3.3 billion shillings ($39
million) of seven-day  repurchase agreements  at a weighted
average yield of 8.651 percent, a central bank official, who
asked not to be named in line with policy, said today. The bank
sold 200 million shillings of 14-day term-auction deposits at
8.32 percent, the official said from Nairobi, the capital. The
bank received bids of 4.9 billion shillings.  The Tanzanian shilling weakened 0.4 percent to 1,577 to the
dollar, while  Uganda ’s shilling retreated 0.1 percent to 2,483
versus the U.S. currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
