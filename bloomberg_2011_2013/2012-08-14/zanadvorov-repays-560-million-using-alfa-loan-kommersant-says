Alexander Zanadvorov , owner of
Russian food retailer OAO Seventh Continent, repaid a $560
million personal loan to creditors, including U.S. hedge fund
Spinnaker and  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ,  Kommersant  said.  The repayment allowed him to free 75 percent shares of
Seventh Continent which had been used as collateral, the Moscow-
based newspaper said citing unidentified people familiar with
the matter. Zanadvorov got the money from  Russia â€™s Alfa Bank by
pledging 70 stores as a collateral, according to Kommersant.  The businessman plans to use Seventh Continent shares to
secure a $650 million loan from state-run VTB Group, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
