German 10-year bunds stayed lower
after reports showed the euro-area economy contracted in the
second quarter and investor confidence in  Germany  unexpectedly
fell for a fourth month in August.  The bund yield rose two basis points to 1.42 percent at
10:06 a.m. London time. Two-year notes were little changed, with
the yield at minus 0.044 percent.  Gross domestic product in the 17-nation currency bloc fell
0.2 percent from the first quarter, when it stagnated, the
European Unionâ€™s statistics office in Luxembourg said today.  The ZEW Center for European Economic Research said its
index of investor and analyst expectations, which aims to
predict economic developments six months in advance, declined to
minus 25.5 from minus 19.6 in July. Economists forecast a gain
to minus 19.3, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
