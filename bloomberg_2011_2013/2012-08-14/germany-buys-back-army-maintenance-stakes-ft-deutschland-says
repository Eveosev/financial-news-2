Germanyâ€™s  Defense Ministry  plans to
buy back a 51 percent stake in an army maintenance company it
sold to private investors seven years ago, Financial Times
Deutschland  reported , citing the government.  The decision marks the end of one of the biggest
privatization efforts of the Germany military, according to the
newspaper.  The stake in HIL Heeresinstandsetzungslogistik GmbH is held
by Krauss-Maffei Wegmann GmbH,  Rheinmetall AG (RHM)  and Diehl Group.
The ministry owns the other 49 percent, the newspaper said.  The company handles the repair and maintenance of about
7,000 armored vehicles and had almost 200 million euros in
revenue last year and 1.8 billion euros in contracts since 2005,
