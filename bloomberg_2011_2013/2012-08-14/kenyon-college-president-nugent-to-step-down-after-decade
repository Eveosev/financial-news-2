Kenyon College  President S. Georgia Nugent will step down at the end of the 2012-2013 academic year
after a decade in office.  Kenyon expects to name a new president by June, according
to a  statement  today from the Gambier, Ohio-based liberal arts
school.  During Nugentâ€™s tenure, Kenyon attracted a more diverse and
international student body and raised more than $60 million in
endowed financial aid, according to the statement. Nugent, 62,
came to Kenyon in 2003 from Princeton University.  To contact the reporter on this story:
