New Zealand’s dollar may fall
against its U.S. counterpart after descending from the top of
its year-long contracting range, according to Bank of America
Corp., citing  technical analysis .  The currency, nicknamed the kiwi, had an “impulsive
break” to 80.67 cents to the greenback that confirmed a top a
turn lower,  MacNeil Curry , head of foreign-exchange and
interest-rates technical strategy in New York at Bank of America
Merrill Lynch, wrote today in a research report. The kiwi will
likely fall to 78.41 cents and may decline as low as 74.89 cents
against the U.S. dollar.  New Zealand’s dollar “looks like it’s looking to carve out
a top,” Curry said in a telephone interview. “Aussie and kiwi
have been in this year-long contracting range,” he said,
referring to the Australian dollar.  The kiwi depreciated 0.4 percent to 80.56 cents today in
New York.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
