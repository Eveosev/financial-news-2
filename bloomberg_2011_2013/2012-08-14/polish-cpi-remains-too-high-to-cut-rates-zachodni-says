Polish  consumer-price growth , which
slowed more than economists forecasts in July to 4 percent, is
still too high for the central bank to cut  interest rates  this
year, according to economists at  Bank Zachodni WBK SA. (BZW)   Inflation slowed from 4.3 percent in June and was less than
the 4.1 percent median estimate of 33 economists in a Bloomberg
survey, the statistical office in Warsaw said today.  “It seems that this is not enough to encourage a majority
of MPC members to cut interest rates this year, especially as
CPI will remain close to 4 percent (much above target) until
late autumn,” economists at Bank Zachodni led by  Maciej Reluga 
wrote in a note to clients today. “Nevertheless, a gradual
easing of the council’s stance will probably be visible,
supporting the shorter end of the yield curve.”  Rate cuts next year can’t be ruled out, “especially if the
economic growth slowdown proves to be deeper than previously
expected,” the economists said in the note.  Poland’s central bank isn’t ruling out lowering borrowing
costs, though the case for doing so isn’t yet clear, Anna Zielinska-Glebocka of the rate-setting Monetary Policy Council
was cited as saying by PAP newswire after today’s data. The bank
should lower rates next month due to the euro area’s deepening
contraction and a recent weakening in Polish growth, Council
member Elzbieta Chojna-Duch said on TVN CNBC after the inflation
report.  Economic growth will probably slow to 2.7 percent this
year, the European Commission estimates, from 4.3 percent in
2011. Three of  Poland ’s top five export markets, the U.K., the
Czech Republic and Italy, are in a recession, while growth in
the other two,  France  and  Germany , is slowing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
