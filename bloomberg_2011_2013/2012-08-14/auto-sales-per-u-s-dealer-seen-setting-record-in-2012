U.S. auto sales per dealership may
climb to a record in 2012 as carmakers keep distribution outlets
stable and boost vehicle deliveries at a faster rate than
estimated, according to an industry consulting firm.  Annual sales per dealer will increase to an estimated 805
vehicles from a previous estimate of 785, consulting firm  Urban
Science  said today in an e-mailed statement. The Detroit-based
company updated its dealer franchise activity report from
February to include an annual sales estimate of 14.3 million
vehicles. The previous record was 784 per dealer in 2005.  The number of U.S. auto dealerships rose 0.02 percent to
17,770 in the first half of the year, according to the
statement.  “Automakers have kept their networks relatively flat,
giving existing dealerships the opportunity to take advantage of
increased sales volumes,” John Frith, vice president of retail
channel solutions at Urban Science, said in the statement.
“Dealers are making a profit for the first time in more than
three years without having to rely on their service departments
to do so.”  The number of U.S. auto dealerships usually falls about 2
percent annually, said Urban Science, which has compiled an
annual franchise activity report since 1990.  Urban Science also issued its first report for  China  today.
The world’s largest auto market has 19,890 automotive
franchises, the report said. The consulting firm estimates each
dealership averages 980 annual vehicle sales, Urban Science said
in a statement. The estimate is based on LMC Automotive’s
projected annual China sales volume of 19.5 million.  To contact the reporters on this story:
