Soybeans gained on speculation that
a 1 percentage point improvement in U.S. crop conditions won’t
ease supply concerns as drought persists in the Midwest.  Soybeans for November delivery advanced as much as 0.5
percent to $16.09 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, and
were at $16.0425 at 2:15 p.m. Singapore time. Corn for December
delivery rose as much as 0.7 percent to $7.975 a bushel and last
traded at $7.9575.  Less rain than normal will probably fall from  Montana  to
western  New York , including the Midwest, from Aug. 18 to 22,
according to Joel Widenor, the co-founder of Commodity Weather
Group LLC. Soybean crop  conditions  remained at the worst level
since 1988, with 30 percent rated good to excellent in the week
to Aug. 12, up from 29 percent a week earlier, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said yesterday.  “We would caution that the improvement in crop conditions
is small and does not change the overall bleak supply outlook,”
 Luke Mathews , a commodity strategist at  Commonwealth Bank of
Australia , said in a report today.  The U.S. soybean  harvest , the world’s largest, will total
73.3 million metric tons in the year beginning Sept. 1, down
from 83.2 million tons a year earlier, and smaller than the 83
million tons forecast last month, the USDA said Aug. 10.  The share of the U.S. corn crop that’s rated poor to very
poor expanded to 51 percent in the week ended Aug. 12, from 50
percent a week earlier. About 23 percent of the crop got the  top
ratings , unchanged from a week earlier and the smallest since
1988, according to the USDA.  U.S. corn production will fall to 10.779 billion bushels
(273.8 million tons) in the year beginning Sept. 1, from 12.358
billion bushels a year earlier, the USDA said Aug. 10, paring
its output estimate by 17 percent from last month. Yields will
average 123.4 bushels per acre, down from 146 bushels estimated
in July and less than 147.2 last year, the USDA said.  Wheat for December delivery rose as much as 0.6 percent to
$8.8125 a bushel and was last at $8.81.  To contact the reporter on this story:
