Evraz Plc (EVR) , a Russian steelmaker
part-owned by billionaire  Roman Abramovich , rose the most in a
week during London trading today after resuming operations at
its Highveld unit in  South Africa  following a strike.  Evraz rose as much as 3.4 percent today, the biggest
intraday gain since Aug. 7, and traded up 1.8 percent at 273.20
pence by 11:30 a.m. in London.  The South African unit, Evraz Highveld Steel & Vanadium,
reached an agreement with its biggest labor union after a four-
week strike, allowing operations to resume Aug. 13, the metals
producer said in a statement today. Highveld said yesterday by
e-mail that the steelworks were starting and would be fully
operational by the end of the month.  “Evraz is rising on the resumption of South African
operations and market improvement in  Russia ,” said Anton
Rumyantsev, an analyst at Troika Dialog in Moscow. Prices for
rebar, a key product for Evraz, have added 1 percent since last
week, he said, citing data compiled by Steel Business Briefing.  The unit has converted a three-shift system to a four-shift
system and agreed on “certain compensation” for workers hurt
financially by the change, according to the statement. The four-
week strike had “no material effect” on Evraz’s financial
performance, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
