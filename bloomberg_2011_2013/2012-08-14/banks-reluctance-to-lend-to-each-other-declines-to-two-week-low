European banks’ reluctance to lend
to one another dropped to the lowest in two weeks, according to
a money market indicator.  The difference between the forward-rate agreement on the
three-month euro interbank offered rate and overnight indexed
swaps, known as the  FRA/OIS spread , declined to 23.4 basis
points at 1:21 p.m. in  London , from 24 yesterday, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. The gap is the tightest since July 27.  The cost for European banks to borrow in dollars fell to
the lowest in more than a year. The three-month cross-currency
 basis swap , the rate banks pay to convert euro interest payments
into dollars, was 33 basis points below Euribor, the cheapest
since July 25, 2011, from 36 yesterday.  The one-year basis swap was 39.5 basis points below Euribor
from minus 40 yesterday. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Three-month Euribor, the rate  banks  say they see each other
lending in euros, was set at a record low 0.345 percent from
0.349 percent yesterday. The benchmark, derived from a daily
survey of banks for the European Banking Federation, fell for
the seventh day.  The London interbank offered rate, or Libor, for three-
month dollar loans rose to 0.437 percent from 0.435 percent
yesterday. Libor is published by the British Bankers’
Association.  The EBF’s euro overnight indexed average, or Eonia, of
unsecured lending deals was set at 11.2 basis points from 11.5
on Aug. 10. The Eonia swap, an estimate of average overnight
borrowing costs over the next three months, was at 7.1 basis
points from 7 yesterday.  Lenders increased  overnight deposits  at the ECB yesterday,
placing 326 billion euros ($403 billion) with the Frankfurt-
based central bank from 311 billion euros on Aug. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
