GAM Holding AG (GAM) , the asset manager
that split from  Julius Baer Group Ltd. (BAER)  almost three years ago,
said first-half profit climbed after booking a lower charge on
its stake in  Artio Global Investors Inc. (ART)   Net income rose to 35.9 million Swiss francs ($36.9
million) from 2.4 million francs a year earlier, Zurich-based
GAM Holding said today in a  statement . Stripping out the Artio
revaluation and other one-time items, profit dropped 30 percent
to 70.2 million francs.  GAM Holding posted a 22.5 million-franc charge after
reducing the value of its holding in New York-based Artio to
55.5 million francs as of June 30. The value of the stake was
cut by 92.2 million francs in the year-earlier period. The firm
reported first-half net inflows of 900 million francs.  “We have the ability to capture client flows even in an
environment where demand is thin and focused on specific, narrow
areas,” Johannes De Gier, chairman and chief executive officer
of GAM Holding, said in the statement. “Unless market
conditions were to improve dramatically, we expect uncertainty
to persist and to continue to impact client behavior.”  GAM Holding, which is buying back as much as 20 percent of
its shares by 2014, has climbed 9.3 percent in Zurich trading
this year.  GAM Holding said assets under management were little
changed at 111.1 billion francs during the second quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
