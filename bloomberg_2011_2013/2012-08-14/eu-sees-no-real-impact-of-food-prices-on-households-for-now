Surging food prices haven’t had a
“real impact” on European Union household budgets for now, and
any impact would be delayed.  “As far as households are concerned at this stage there
should not be any real impact,” Patrizio Fiorilli, a spokesman
for the European Commission, said at a briefing in Brussels
today. “If there is any impact it should be delayed.”  The  United Nations ’ Food & Agriculture Organization index
of 55 food items jumped 6.2 percent in July, the most since
2009, as drought reduced grain production in the U.S. and
 Russia , the FAO reported Aug. 9.  The increase in prices has mainly affected corn and
soybeans, according to Fiorilli.  To contact the reporters on this story:
