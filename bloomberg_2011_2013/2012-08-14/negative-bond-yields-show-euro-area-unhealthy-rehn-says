Negative bond yields in euro-area
countries highlight the weaknesses of the economy in the 17-
nation currency region, European Economic and Monetary Affairs
Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said.  “Negative bond yields are not a healthy phenomenon,” Rehn
said in a Bloomberg Television interview today in New York.
“They’re not good for  Germany  or Finland or Belgium. They are a
sign that the euro-zone economy is not doing well.”  The Finnish commissioner said the key is to restore
competitive balance in the currency union.  Belgium today sold three-month bills at a negative yield,
meaning investors paid to lend the country money.  To contact the reporters on this story:
