The largest commodity carriers fell
for a fifth day as prices for iron ore, their main cargo,
declined on weaker demand in  China , the biggest importer.  Daily earnings for Capesizes, the largest ships hauling the
steelmaking ingredient, decreased 4.6 percent to $3,590,
according to the  Baltic Exchange , the London-based publisher of
freight rates. The Baltic Dry Index, a broader gauge of raw-
materials shipping costs, fell 1.8 percent to 750, the lowest
since Feb. 29.  Iron ore prices are falling on sluggish demand, according
to Arctic Securities ASA.  Imported iron ore  with 62 percent
content at the port of Tianjin dropped 35 percent this month to
$113 a metric ton, within 10 cents of the lowest level since
December 2009, according to the Steel Index Ltd.  “There is still downside to Chinese  iron ore  prices driven
by lower demand,” Erik Nikolai Stavseth, an analyst at Oslo-
based Arctic, said in an e-mailed note today. “We thus maintain
a cautious view on freight rates.”  The losses extended across the smaller vessels tracked by
the index. Panamaxes, which carry about half as much as
Capesizes, fell 0.2 percent to $6,395 a day, according to the
exchange. Daily income for Supramaxes fell 1.4 percent to
$9,046, and Handysizes declined 2.2 percent to $7,416, according
to the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
