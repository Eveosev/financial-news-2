Dragon Oil Plc (DGO) , an explorer focused
on  Turkmenistan , will slow future increases in dividends as it
considers acquisitions.  The company today raised its first-half payout to
shareholders by 67 percent to 15 cents a share. Dragon Oil plans
to spend $200 million on buying back 5 percent of its shares,
the Dubai-based explorer said in a statement.  For dividends “I don’t see the same growth pattern
continuing in the future with the same pace,” Chief Executive
Officer Abdul Jaleel Al Khalifa said in a phone interview.  Dragon has been expanding in Iraq and  Tunisia  to diversify
from its main production base in Turkmenistan. It plans to bid
for exploration licenses in  Afghanistan  and is looking for
possible acquisitions with output expected to rise by as much as
15 percent a year through 2015. Dragon held $1.7 billion in cash
as of June 30.  “We still want to keep that money to grow the company and
always put it in the right place,” al Khalifa said. “It’s only
two or three acquisitions and all money is gone.”  Dragon had considered expanding in West Africa. In
February, it gave up plans to bid for  BowLeven Plc (BLVN) , a driller
working in Cameroon.  If Dragon meets its production forecast with the oil price
averaging at $95 a barrel, it “will end up with a $4 billion
cash pile, representing 85 percent of current market” value,
