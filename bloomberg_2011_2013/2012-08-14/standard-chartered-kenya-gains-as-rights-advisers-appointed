Standard Chartered Bank Kenya Ltd. (SCBL) ,
the country’s fourth-biggest lender, advanced in Nairobi trading
after appointing advisers for a rights offer.  Shares of the Nairobi-based lender climbed 1.6 percent to
196 shillings by the 3 p.m. close in the capital, the biggest
gain and highest price since Aug. 10.  Stanchart, as the lender is known, appointed Standard
Chartered Securities Kenya Ltd. to advise it on an offer of
stock to existing shareholders and named Standard Investment
Bank Ltd. as the lead sponsoring stockbroker, it said yesterday.  “The appointment of advisers shows they want to do it very
soon so people have begun taking positions,” Emma Mareri, an
analyst at Nairobi-based African Alliance Kenya Securities Ltd.,
said in a phone interview today.  In May, shareholders approved the rights offer aimed at
raising 3.2 billion shillings ($38.2 million). The bank will
offer 37 million ordinary shares to existing investors,
increasing the authorized share capital to 1.91 billion
shillings from 1.78 billion shillings.  Stanchart said Aug. 9 first-half profit surged 82 percent
to 4.54 billion shillings. Net interest income, the money banks
earn from charges on loans, advanced 62 percent to 7.33 billion
shillings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
