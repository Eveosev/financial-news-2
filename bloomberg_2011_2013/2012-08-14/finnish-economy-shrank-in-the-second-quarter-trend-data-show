Finland’s  econom y may have
contracted in the second quarter as the  European debt crisis 
weighs on exports in the northernmost euro member.  Second-quarter seasonally adjusted gross domestic product
shrank 1 percent from the prior three months, Helsinki-based
 Statistics Finland  said today on its website, citing preliminary
data based on the trend indicator. In the first-quarter, the
economy grew 0.8 percent, according to quarterly national
accounts, which have a different calculation method.  Finance Minister Jutta Urpilainen last week said that
growth next year may be “between zero and 1 percent” as the debt
crisis weighs on exports, lowering a 1.2 percent forecast. The
government expects a budget deficit of 6.6 billion euros ($8.2
billion) next year and plans 1.3 billion euros in tax increases
and 400 million euros in spending cuts.  Finland’s economy has been buoyed by domestic spending amid
record low  interest rates . The  European Central Bank ’s record-
low 0.75 percent  rate  has fed through to the Nordic economy,
where more than 93 percent of mortgages are linked to variable
interest rates.  Statistics Finland  is scheduled to publish second-quarter
GDP figures on Sept. 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
