Plug Power Inc. (PLUG) , the fuel-cell maker
that’s reported net losses each quarter since public trading
began, fell the most in four months after orders slowed and it
cut sales guidance for the year.  Plug Power, based in Latham, New York,  dropped  7 percent to
$1.13 at the close, the biggest decline since April 9. The
shares have dropped 45 percent this year.  The company reduced its 2012  sales forecast  to $30 million
to $35 million, down from prior guidance of $40 million,
according to a statement today. Plug Power’s second-quarter loss
narrowed to $6.48 million, or 17 cents a share, from $6.75
million, or 41 cents, a year earlier.  Delays in some orders will also reverse an expected
positive gross margin of 10 percent this year to a negative 5
percent to 10 percent, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
