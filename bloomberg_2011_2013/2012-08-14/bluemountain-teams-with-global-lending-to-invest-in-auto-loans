the New York-based credit investment firm, has partnered with an
auto finance company to collectively invest $100 million in sub-

Lending Services LLC and will have a majority interest in their
joint venture, according to a statement distributed by
Marketwire. Global Lending acquired the business of Resurgent
Auto Finance, a sub-prime car loan originator, which includes a
$38 million loan portfolio.  The partnership has obtained a $75 million senior debt
facility from UBS AG, according to the release.  Issuance of bonds tied to payments on subprime car loans

spotty credit records compares with $8.2 billion in the similar
