David Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital
Inc. bought shares of  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)  and  Xerox Corp. (XRX)  during
the second quarter while selling  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM)   Einhorn’s fund also bought Seagate Technology Plc and
Barrick Gold Corp., according to a government filing released
today. Greenlight increased its proportion of equity investments
in health-care shares and reduced technology stock weightings,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Greenlight returned 3.4 percent in the first half of the
year, according to an investor letter dated July 23, a copy of
which was obtained by Bloomberg News. Hedge funds gained 1.1
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Sprint, the third-largest U.S. wireless carrier, has risen
53 percent since the end of June, while printing company Xerox
slumped 8.8 percent. RIM, which makes the BlackBerry mobile
phone, plunged 50 percent during the second quarter.  Greenlight Capital Inc. disclosed in its July 23 letter
that it bought shares in Cigna Corp. and Coventry Health Care
Inc. during the quarter. The companies have unlevered balance
sheets and trade at single-digit price-earnings ratios, making
them cheap, Greenlight said in the letter.  “There is the additional unpriced upside in the
possibility that the election changes the political landscape,
resulting in a possible modification or repeal of Obamacare,”
the hedge fund said in the letter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
