Energy Development Corp. (EDC)  sank the
most in three months on speculation the largest Philippine
geothermal company will report “sharply lower” second-quarter
earnings today, according to Macquarie Group Ltd.  Energy Development  declined 3. percent to 5.71 pesos at
11:33 a.m. in  Manila , heading for the sharpest loss since May
16. It’s the biggest loser on the benchmark Philippine Stock
Exchange Index, which fell 0.2 percent.  “The market is anticipating Energy Development will report
earnings sharply lower than first quarter,” Alex Pomento, a
strategist at Macquarie’s Manila unit, said by phone today.
“Anticipation that earnings will be weak is dragging down the
stock.”  Profit may have slumped as Energy Development was forced to
supply power bought on the  spot market  at a loss to meet
contractual obligations after its Bacon-Manito geothermal
complex was closed for repair, Pomento said. First-quarter net
income was 2.7 billion pesos ($64.4 million).  The company said Aug. 10 that repairs on the plant may take
60 days longer than initially estimated. President Richard
Tantoco said on May 9 that the facility would resume operations
by September.  Tantoco couldn’t be reached for comment at his office,
while investor relations manager Erudito Recio couldn’t be
contacted on his mobile phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
