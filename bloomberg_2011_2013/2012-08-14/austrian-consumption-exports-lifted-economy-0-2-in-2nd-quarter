Austria’s economy expanded in the
second quarter after the Alpine republic’s manufacturers lifted
exports and people consumed more goods and services, the
government-backed Wifo economic research institute said.  Second-quarter gross domestic product, the value of goods
and services, rose 0.2 percent from the preceding three months,
Wifo said today in an e-mailed statement. Households consumed
and businesses exported 0.5 percent more in the period.  Wifo also revised its estimate for the first quarter of
this year to 0.5 percent from from 0.3 percent reported in June.
Austria’s economy has expanded 0.2 percent on a year-on-year
basis, according to Wifo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
