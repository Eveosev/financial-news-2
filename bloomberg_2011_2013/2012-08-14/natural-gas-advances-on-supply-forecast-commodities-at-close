New York, paced by a surge in natural gas.  The UBS Bloomberg CMCI index of 26 raw materials advanced
0.1 percent to 1,557.80.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas rebounded from a six-week low in New York on
forecasts for a smaller-than-normal stockpile increase in a
government report this week.  FirstEnergy Capital Corp. in Calgary predicted a supply
gain of 22 billion cubic feet for the week ended Aug. 10. The

September delivery rose 3.9 percent to $2.834 per million
British thermal units.  U.K. natural gas for delivery today climbed for a seventh
day, the longest streak since October 2009, as exports rose amid

pence a therm at 4:24 p.m. London time. September gas fell 0.4
percent to 56.55 pence a therm, equivalent to $8.87 per million
British thermal units. A therm is 100,000 Btu.  CRUDE OIL  Crude oil snapped a two-day decline on better-than-expected

barrels, of Saharan Blend crude oil via a tender to meet its
strategic supply requirements, according to the agency that

level of U.S. distillate inventories since 2004 may shrink
further as demand picks up before winter.  On the Nymex, heating-oil futures for September delivery
climbed 0.5 percent to settle at $3.0346 a gallon.  Gasoline futures for September delivery advanced 0.4
percent to $3.0014 a gallon.  BASE METALS  Copper rose in New York for the first time in three
sessions as stronger-than-estimated U.S. retail sales and German
economic growth bolstered the demand outlook for the metal.  On the Comex in New York, copper futures for December
delivery climbed 0.2 percent to $3.371 a pound.  On the  London  Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months rose 0.3 percent to $7,416 a ton ($3.36 a pound).  Tin and nickel advanced in London, while lead and aluminum
fell. Zinc was unchanged.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold retreated for the second straight day after retail
sales in the U.S. were better than expected, reducing pressure
on the  Federal Reserve  to announce measures to bolster the
economy.  On the Comex, gold futures for December delivery fell 0.6
percent to $1,602.40 an ounce.  Silver futures for September delivery slipped less than 0.1

the harvest is gathering pace in  Brazil , the world’s top
producer, boosting supplies.  On ICE Futures U.S. in New York, arabica coffee for

the price reached $1.6535, the lowest for a most-active contract

to 72.09 cents a pound.  Orange-juice futures for November delivery were unchanged
at $1.045 a pound.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS  Wheat futures capped the biggest three-session slump in 14
months on signs that this year’s drought-fueled rally is eroding
demand for grain from the U.S, the world’s largest exporter.  On the Chicago Board of Trade, wheat futures for December
delivery retreated 2 percent to $8.5825 a bushel. The most-

$15.98 a bushel.  LIVESTOCK  Feeder-cattle futures rose to a five-week high on signs of

dried pastures and forced producers to sell animals earlier than
normal.  On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, feeder-cattle futures
for October settlement rose 1.6 percent to $1.458 a pound, after
touching $1.45875, the highest since July 6.  Cattle futures for October delivery gained 0.4 percent to
