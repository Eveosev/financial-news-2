Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg
should resign to take responsibility for his failure to prevent
the bombing of his office last year that killed eight people,
Verdens Gang,  Norway ’s largest tabloid newspaper, said.  The July 22 Commission, which published its 500-page report
yesterday, also found that the police could have moved faster to
halt the shooting on Utoeya Island.  “He should have the decency to resign,”  VG wrote  in an
editorial today.  The probe into the mass hate killings by Anders Behring Breivik found there were “unacceptable” delays in police
response, adding that the perpetrator could have been stopped
earlier. Breivik on July 22 last year massacred 69 people --some
as young as 14 --- at a Labor Party youth camp on Utoeya, after
earlier detonating a car bomb by the prime minister’s office in
Oslo, killing eight. The group found that the bomb attack could
have been prevented if already adopted security measures had
been implemented.  “Public institutions that should have protected the
country and its people failed. The government could not have
been presented with a more devastating verdict,” VG said.  Stoltenberg “regrets deeply” the failures in the police’s
response and the delays in the implementation of adopted
measures to secure the prime minister’s office, he told a press
conference yesterday, where he was pressed on whether he had
considered resigning.  To contact the reporter on this story:
