Billionaire  Edward Lampert ’s RBS
Partners LP hedge fund has bought a stake in  Avon Products Inc. (AVP) ,
the cosmetics company that rejected a takeover offer from  Coty
Inc. (COTY)  earlier this year.  RBS purchased 145,922 shares of Avon, according to a filing
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Avon, the world’s largest door-to-door seller, rebuffed a
takeover bid from perfumer Coty earlier this year, saying it
would concentrate on a turnaround under new Chief Executive
Officer Sherilyn McCoy. T. Rowe Price Associates has the largest
holding in Avon, with 7.9 percent, followed by  Invesco Ltd. (IVZ)  with
4.9 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Avon, based in New York, has posted three straight years of
declining profits and earlier this month reported a 70 percent
decline in second-quarter earnings amid a sales slump in Europe
and China.  Lampert’s holding in Avon represents a 0.03 percent stake,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. His fund’s stake in  Sears
Holdings Corp. (SHLD) , where Lampert is also chairman, was little
changed compared with three months ago, according to the filing,
with RBS Partners holding about 43 million shares.  RBS Partners, based in Greenwich,  Connecticut , is a
management entity for Lampert’s primary hedge fund, ESL
Partners.  To contact the reporter on this story:
