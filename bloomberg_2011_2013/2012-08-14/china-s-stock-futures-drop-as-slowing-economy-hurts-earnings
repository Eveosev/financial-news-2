China’s stocks  rose, led by energy
producers and property developers, after the biggest one-day
decline in four weeks dragged valuations to a near-record low.   (600999) China Oil HBP Science & Technology Co. (002554) , which develops oil
and gas fields, surged 10 percent after the National Business
Daily reported the government may start second-round shale gas
auctions next month. China Vanke Co. led gains for developers
after falling by more than 6 percent in the previous two days on
concern property curbs will hurt earnings.  Citic Securities Co. (600030) ,
the nation’s biggest listed brokerage, dropped to a six-month
low, as the Securities Times reported the company had denied
speculation of “huge” losses on overseas investments.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  rose 0.3 percent to 2,142.52
at the close, after falling 1.5 percent yesterday. The index
trades at a price-to-book ratio of 1.61 times, compared with the
all-time low of 1.58 set on July 31, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  added 0.2 percent to 2,357.02.  “Valuations are pretty low and that’s why some investors
are willing to buy shares now betting on a short-term rebound,”
said Wu Kan, a Shanghai-based fund manager at Dazhong Insurance
Co., which oversees $285 million. “The whole economic picture
is still bleak.”  The Shanghai Composite tumbled 13 percent through yesterday
from this year’s high on March 2 on concern the economic
slowdown is deepening. The index is valued at 9.6 times
estimated profit, compared with the 17.4 average since Bloomberg
began compiling the  data  in 2006.  ‘Extremely Cheap’  “The market is oversold and is extremely cheap,” said  Liu Yang , chairwoman of Atlantis Investment Management Ltd., in an
interview with Bloomberg Television yesterday.  Vanke, the nation’s biggest property developer, added 1.9
percent to 8.58 yuan. The stock retreated 6.4 percent over the
past two days after a newspaper controlled by the central bank
said authorities want to keep funding for property tight.  Poly Real Estate Group Co. (600048) , the second biggest, rose 2.9
percent to 10.49 yuan. China Merchants Property Development Co.,
the third largest, gained 2.7 percent to 20.65 yuan.  China may start second-round shale gas auctions next month,
the National Business Daily reported, citing Zhang Dawei, deputy
director of oil and gas research at the Ministry of Land and
Resources.  China Oil HBP jumped 10 percent to 10.53  yuan . Kingdream
Public Co., which makes oil-field machinery, climbed 8.6 percent
to 19.20 yuan.  China Oilfield Services Ltd. (601808) , the drilling unit
of the nation’s largest offshore oil producer, added 3.2 percent
to 17.34 yuan.  Shale Gas Reserve  China is estimated to hold the world’s biggest shale-gas
resource with 25.1 trillion cubic meters of recoverable
reserves, Zhou Jiping, president of PetroChina Co., said at a
conference in  Kuala Lumpur  in June. PetroChina drilled shale-gas
wells in Sichuan province, which showed good prospects, he said.  Citic Securities slid 1.6 percent to 10.81 yuan, the lowest
close since Feb. 7. Board secretary Zheng Jing denied
speculation that the company had “huge” losses on its overseas
investments, the  Securities Times  said today. The Shanghai
Securities News reported the losses were 2.9 billion yuan
($455.8 million), citing market rumors. Two phone calls by
Bloomberg News to Zheng’s office in Beijing and Shenzhen weren’t
answered before working hours.
  Suning Appliance Co. (002024) , China’s biggest home appliance
retailer by market value, plunged 7.1 percent to 5.88 yuan, the
lowest close since November 2008. The company’s board approved a
plan to sell 8 billion yuan of 10-year bonds, with the proceeds
used to replenish working capital.  Bond Sale  The bond sale “probably means there’s a big investment
coming up with the fundraising,” Zhang Lu, an analyst at
Capital Securities in Shanghai, said by telephone. “It’s a big
amount. As such, the company may not be able to rake in profit
this year and next.”  China Merchants Securities Co. declined 1.8 percent to
10.08 yuan after it said first-half net income fell 36 percent
from a year earlier.  Chinese publicly traded companies are required to release
first-half earnings results in July and August. Of the 888
companies in the Shanghai Composite, the 216 that reported
second-quarter earnings had an average 0.6 percent profit
decline, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. Profit rose
2.8 percent in the first quarter, the data showed.  China’s economy will slow “considerably,”  Marc Faber , the
publisher of the Gloom Boom & Doom report, told  Tom Keene  and
Ken Prewitt in a “Bloomberg Surveillance” radio interview
yesterday.  Slowing Growth  “The growth rate we had in the last 10 years, which was
around 10 percent annually, is going to slow down
considerably,” Faber said. “I would rather wait to buy Chinese
stocks until we see the result of the stimulus packages.”  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese companies
traded in  Hong Kong  added 0.8 percent. The  Bloomberg China-US 55
Index (CH55BN) , the measure of the most-traded U.S.-listed Chinese
companies, was unchanged in New York yesterday.  Thirty-day  volatility  in the Shanghai index was at 14.3
today, compared with this year’s average of 17.5. About 6.6
billion shares changed hands in the gauge today, 18 percent
lower than the daily average this year.  --Zhang Shidong. With assistance from Weiyi Lim in Singapore.
