Japanese and Australian  stock
futures  gained after U.S. retail sales and German gross domestic
product rose more than forecast, boosting the outlook for Asian
exporters.  American depositary receipts of  Sony Corp. (6758) , a Japanese
consumer electronics exporter that gets almost 40 percent of its
revenue from the U.S. and Europe, rose 0.5 percent from the
closing price in Tokyo. Those of Toyota Motor Corp., Asia’s
biggest carmaker, climbed 0.8 percent after the Nikkei newspaper
reported  Japan  will offer subsidies for ultra-compact cars. ADRs
of Woodside Petroleum Ltd., Australia’s second-largest oil
producer, gained 0.7 percent after commodity prices advanced.  Futures on the Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in

futures added 0.1 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index rose
0.3 percent in Wellington.  The U.S. economic data “would temporarily weaken the
expectations for additional easing and is alleviating concerns
of the yen’s strength against the dollar, which is a good factor
for exporters,” said Hiroichi Nishi, an equities manager in
Tokyo at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  fell 0.1 percent
today. The gauge was little changed yesterday as a slump in
technology and financial shares reversed an earlier rally amid
better-than-estimated retail sales.  Retail Sales  U.S. retail sales climbed more than forecast in July as
 consumer spending  rebounded at department stores, auto dealers
and electronics outlets. The 0.8 percent advance, the first gain
in four months, followed a 0.7 percent drop in June, Commerce
Department figures showed. Economists projected a 0.3 percent
increase, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg
survey.  The yen depreciated to as low as 78.93 against the dollar
last night in Tokyo, compared with 78.45 at the close of  stock
trading . Against the euro, Japan’s currency weakened to 97.47
from 96.96. A weaker yen boosts the value of overseas income at
Japanese companies when repatriated.  In  Europe , the Federal Statistics Office in Germany said
gross domestic product rose 0.3 percent from the first quarter.
Economists predicted a 0.2 percent increase, according to the
median of 40 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. French GDP
was unchanged in the quarter, better than the 0.1 percent
decline economists had predicted.  Oil, Metals  Crude oil for September delivery advanced 0.8 percent to
settle at $93.43 a barrel yesterday in New York, snapping a two-
day decline. The London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six
industrial metals including copper and aluminum added 0.3
percent, rising for the first time in five days.  The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded Chinese
equities in the U.S rose 0.6 percent to 92.45 in New York
yesterday, the highest level since July 5. Yingli Green Energy
Holding Co. led the gain in the index.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  fell 6.7 percent from this
year’s high on Feb. 29 through yesterday amid concern Europe’s
sovereign-debt crisis will worsen and  China’s economy  is
slowing. The regional benchmark index traded at 12.4 times
estimated earnings compared with 13.6 times for the  S&P 500
Index  and a multiple of 11.6 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Of the 1,008 companies listed on the Asian benchmark gauge,
about 120 are scheduled to post earnings this week, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Of the 419 companies that have

has estimates, 43 percent have exceeded expectations.  To contact the reporters on this story:
