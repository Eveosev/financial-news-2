U.S. stocks pared earlier gains
after policy planning documents showed the U.K. is pressing for
the  European Central Bank  to share power with national
regulators as it takes over euro-area bank supervision.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.1 percent to
1,405.60 at 1:20 p.m. in New York, trimming an earlier advance
of as much as 0.4 percent.  The ECB should have a core set of central powers to oversee
all banks in the 17-nation currency bloc while delegating some
tasks to individual countries, under one option favored by the
U.K. and European Union economic policy officials. The ECB
supports a similar “light touch” approach that would leave day-
to-day supervision for most banks in the hands of national
authorities, according to the documents obtained by Bloomberg
News.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
