President  Barack Obama ’s move to
stop deportations of many undocumented immigrants brought to the
U.S. as children may benefit as many as 1.7 million people age
30 and under, according to estimates from the  Pew Hispanic
Center .  The new rules go into effect tomorrow. The Pew report said
that 950,000 people would be eligible immediately and another
770,000 people in the future as they meet the criteria set by
Obama. The Pew figures are twice as high as the estimate of
800,000 given when Obama announced the policy on June 15.  About 85 percent of those eligible to remain in the U.S.
and apply for permits allowing them to work are Hispanic,
according to the center, a project of the Washington-based Pew
Research Center.  Under the policy, the government would stop deportations of
those who arrived in the U.S. before age 16; have lived in the
U.S. for at least five years; are in school, have a high school
diploma or equivalent or have been honorably discharged from
military service; and don’t have any criminal convictions.  The policy would affect more than 10 percent of the
estimated 11.2 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S.,
according to Pew.  Congressional Republicans  have blocked action on
legislation with similar rules, known as the Dream Act. That
measure has been backed by Obama and opposed by presumptive
Republican presidential nominee  Mitt Romney .  Obama’s policy may buttress his political support from
Hispanics, who gave him 67 percent of their votes in 2008,
according to an analysis of exit polls by the Pew Hispanic
Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
