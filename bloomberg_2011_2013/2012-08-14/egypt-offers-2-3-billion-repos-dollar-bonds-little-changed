Egypt  will offer 30 percent fewer
seven-day  repurchase agreements  than last week after exceeding
its goal at a treasury-bond auction. The nationâ€™s dollar bonds
were little changed.  The Arab country will make available 14 billion Egyptian
pounds ($2.3 billion) of the contracts, allowing government
security holders to sell them back to access funds temporarily
at 9.75 percent, according to central bank data on Bloomberg.
The regulator sold 12.2 billion pounds of repos last week after
offering 20 billion pounds.  Egypt sold a combined 5.1 billion pounds of three-, five-
and 10-year bonds yesterday, or 100 million pounds more than its
target. Average yields on the three maturities advanced by
three, two and one basis points, respectively.  The yield on the 5.75 percent dollar bonds due in 2020
retreated less than one basis point, or 0.01 of a percentage
point, to 6.2 percent at 12:50 p.m. in Cairo, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The pound, subject to a managed float,
was also little changed at 6.0699 a dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
