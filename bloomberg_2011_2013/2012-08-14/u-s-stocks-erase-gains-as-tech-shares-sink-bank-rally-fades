U.S. stocks erased gains as
technology shares sank and financial companies reversed an
earlier rally.  The Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index fell less than 0.1 percent
to 1,403.92 at 3:33 p.m. New York time, after gaining as much as
0.4 percent earlier.  Stocks advanced earlier as retail sales rose more than
forecast and amid better-than-estimated economic data in Germany
and France.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
