Asian  stocks  rose, with the
benchmark index gaining a fifth time in seven days, as  Bank of
Japan  minutes showed policy makers weren’t ruling out any
options to boost growth, and before a retail sales report
expected to signal U.S. demand is recovering.  Yue Yuen Industrial Holdings Ltd. (551) , which makes shoes for
Nike Inc., rose 1.1 percent in  Hong Kong . Noble Group Ltd.,
Asia’s biggest-listed commodity supplier, surged 12 percent in
Singapore after second-quarter profit rose 39 percent.  Swire
Properties Ltd. (1972)  slumped 4.2 in Hong Kong after saying John Swire
& Sons Ltd. is selling shares in the commercial landlord.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  rose 0.4 percent to 120.58 as
of 7:39 p.m. in Tokyo, erasing yesterday’s losses as almost two
stocks advanced for each that retreated. The gauge climbed 3
percent last week, its biggest weekly gain since January, amid
speculation China will do more to support economic growth.  “The global central banks’ attitude to prevent economies
from falling into a serious slowdown is helping investor
sentiment,” said  Naoki Fujiwara , chief  fund manager  at Shinkin
Asset Management Co. in Tokyo, which oversees about $6.7
billion. “Data that would signal a rebound in the  U.S. economy 
and steady personal spending is positive.”  Asia’s benchmark gauge fell 6.9 percent from this year’s
high on Feb. 29 through yesterday amid concern earnings would be
hurt by Europe’s debt crisis and slower growth in China. The
index traded at 12.4 times estimated earnings compared with 13.6
for the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  and 11.6 for the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  BOJ Minutes  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average increased 0.5 percent. Shares
gained after minutes of the Bank of Japan’s last meeting showed
a few board members said the central bank should not dismiss any
policy options in combating risks to the economy.  South Korea’s  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  rose 1.3 percent.  Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index (AS51)  climbed 0.2 percent and Singapore’s Straits
Times Index both advanced 0.8 percent.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index climbed 1.1 percent and
Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.3 percent.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.2 percent
today. The gauge slid 0.1 percent yesterday after commodities
declined amid concern that Asia’s growth is slowing.  Sales at U.S. retailers probably rose in July for the first
time in four months, according to the median estimate of
economists polled before a Commerce Department report today. The
projected 0.3 percent increased follows a 0.5 percent drop in
June, according to the median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  U.S. Production  Output at U.S. factories, mines and utilities probably
climbed 0.5 percent in July after a 0.4 percent gain the
previous month, a separate report may show tomorrow.  Yue Yuen climbed 1.1 percent to HK$23.35 in Hong Kong,
while Uniden Corp., an electronic equipment maker that counts
North America as its biggest market, rose 5.9 percent to 181 yen
in Tokyo.  Noble (NOBL)  surged 12 percent to S$1.25 in Singapore after the
commodity supplier’s net income rose to $194.8 million in the
three months ended June 30 from $139.8 million a year earlier.  Swire Properties slumped 4.2 percent to HK$22.85 in Hong
Kong. John Swire & Sons will sell 234 million shares of the
company at HK$21.53 apiece, cutting its holdings in the company
to 3.71 percent from 7.71 percent, it said in a statement. John
Swire & Sons owns 44 percent of Swire Pacific Ltd., which owns
82 percent of Swire Properties.  To contact the reporter on this story:
