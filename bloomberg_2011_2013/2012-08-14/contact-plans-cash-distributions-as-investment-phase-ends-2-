Contact Energy Ltd. (CEN) ,  New Zealand ’s
largest publicly traded power company, will revert to cash
dividends next year and may return funds to shareholders from
2014 as it ends a phase of new investment.  “We’re coming to the end of this period of significant
 capital investment ,” Chief Executive Officer Dennis Barnes said
on a conference call from Wellington. Capital spending will drop
by more than two-thirds in 2013-14 and “that will be the time
where we start to return some of that cash back to
shareholders,” he said.  Contact has retained cash to help fund developments
including the 166-megawatt Te Mihi geothermal power plant that
is scheduled to finish next year. Dividends have been paid
through bonus shares, which the company buys back from
shareholders who elect that option.  The so-called profit distribution plan will be used for the
last time when Contact pays a 12 cents-a-share second-half
dividend in September, the company said in a statement today
after announcing net income rose 27 percent to NZ$190.4 million
($154 million) in the year ended June 30.  “It is pleasing to see an improvement in earnings that
should see Contact revert to cash distribution in 2013,”
Chairman Grant King said in the statement.  Contact shares rose 3 cents, or 0.6 percent, to NZ$4.88 as
at the 5 p.m. market close in Wellington.  Capital spending  will fall to about NZ$350 million in
2012-13 from more than NZ$550 million in the previous year, the
company said today. It is forecast to average NZ$100 million or
less for the three following years, Barnes said.  Electricity demand fell 0.1 percent in the year through
June 30 and is unchanged over the past two years, according to
Contact figures.  “In the current low demand growth environment we will not
be committing to further generation developments in the near
term,” Barnes said. “There is nothing today that would say to
me that significant new generation is needed any time in the
next five to six years.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
