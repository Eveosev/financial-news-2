India ’s rupee and bonds fell to the
lowest levels in a week after central bank Governor Duvvuri
Subbarao said high  inflation  has reduced room for policy
measures to spur the nation’s economic growth.  A government report showed today  wholesale prices  rose 6.87
percent in July from a year earlier, after gaining 7.25 percent
in June. That is still fastest pace among the largest  emerging
markets . Inflation was 5.2 percent in  Brazil , 1.8 percent in
China and 5.6 percent in  Russia  last month, according to
official figures.  “The Reserve Bank can’t be more hawkish,” Chong Wee- Khoon, a Hong Kong-based strategist at Societe Generale SA,
wrote in a note to clients today. Steps to boost funds in the
financial system are “unlikely, given inflation concerns,” he
wrote.  The rupee declined 0.6 percent to 55.66 per dollar in
Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched
55.78 earlier, the weakest level since Aug. 3. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price
options, fell five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to
10.10 percent.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 56.78 per
dollar, compared with 56.45 yesterday, and offshore non-
deliverable contracts were at 56.69 from 56.36. Forwards are
agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-
deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  The  Reserve Bank  of India held its  repurchase rate  at 8
percent, the highest level for a policy benchmark among major
Asian economies, and raised its inflation estimate for the
fiscal year through March 2013 to 7 percent from 6.5 percent on
July 31.  ‘No Space’  “Inflation is high,  oil prices , though they have come off
$100 a barrel, are at elevated levels, the external sector is
under stress,” Subbarao said in a speech in the southern state
of Kerala yesterday. “There is just no space for fiscal or
monetary response.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 rose two
basis points to 8.22 percent in Mumbai, according to the central
bank’s trading system. That is the highest level since Aug. 6.
One-year  interest-rate swaps , or derivative contracts used to
guard against fluctuations in funding costs, climbed three basis
points to 7.79 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
