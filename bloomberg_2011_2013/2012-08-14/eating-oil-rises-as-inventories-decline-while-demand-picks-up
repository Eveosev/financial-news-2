Heating oil rose on speculation the
lowest seasonal level of U.S. distillate inventories since 2004
may shrink further as demand picks up before winter.  Prices gained as inventories of heating oil and diesel
probably fell 275,000 barrels last week, according to the median
estimate of 10 analysts in a  survey  by Bloomberg News. The
Energy Department is scheduled to report last week’s inventories
at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in Washington. Stockpiles were 123.5
million as of Aug. 3, 19 percent below a year earlier,
department data show.  “Heating oil is strong because inventories are so low and
winter’s coming,” said  Addison Armstrong , director of market
research at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “We’ve
got quite a lot of heating oil we’re going to need to make.”  Heating oil for September delivery rose 1.63 cents, or 0.5
percent, to settle at $3.0346 a gallon on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange. (CME)   Recent refinery outages could be contributing to declining
inventories, said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at Price
Futures Group in Chicago.  Chevron Corp. (CVX) ’s Richmond, California,   HollyFrontier
Corp. (HFC) ’s Tulsa plant and  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Whiting refinery have reduced
production in the past month because of breakdowns.  Less Production  “All of that seems to suggest production of heating oil
and diesel is going to be a little less than it should be,”
Flynn said.  September-delivery gasoline rose 1.07 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $3.0014 a gallon on the exchange.  Inventories probably fell 2 million barrels last week, the
median estimate of 10 analysts in a survey by Bloomberg News.  Regular  gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, rose 1
cent to $3.702 a gallon yesterday, AAA data showed. That’s the
highest level since May 17. Prices have climbed 37.6 cents since
July 1, according to data from the nation’s largest motoring
organization.  To contact the reporter on this story:
