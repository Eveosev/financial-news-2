Madagascar will probably export as
many as 1,700 metric tons of vanilla in 2012 compared with 1,500
tons a year earlier, l’Express de Madagascar  reported , citing
evaluations from officials it didn’t identify.  Growers are paid 5,000 ariary ($2.21) for each kilogram
(2.2 pounds) of fresh vanilla, the Antananarivo-based newspaper
said on its website today. The price would rise by September, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
