Abu Dhabi National Energy Co. (TAQA) , the
state-run company known as Taqa, said second-quarter revenue
dropped 15 percent as fuel sales and commodity prices fell.  Revenue slid to 6.04 billion dirhams ($1.6 billion) from
7.07 billion dirhams, the company said today.  Net income  rose 3
percent to 447 million dirhams as operating expenses declined.
Taqa forecast a rebound in  gas prices .  U.S. natural gas prices averaged $2.354 per million British
thermal units last quarter, 46 percent less than the same period
of 2011. Taqa’s supplemental fuel income dropped more than half
to 979 million dirhams as customers used cheaper natural gas
instead. Brent oil averaged $108.76 in the second quarter,
compared with $116.99 in the same period a year earlier.  The first half of the year “has been a challenging period
for the global economy, a fact that can be clearly seen in
falling global commodity prices,” Chief Executive Officer Carl Sheldon said in a statement. “Prices have since recovered
somewhat, but overall gas price weakness has had a significant
impact on our North American performance.”  Oil and gas revenue dropped 4 percent to 2.99 billion
dirhams. Power and water sales gained 10 percent to 2.07 billion
dirhams.  The company, which spent $949 million in the first half, is
targeting annual capital expenditure of about $2 billion from
2010 to 2014, Sheldon said on a conference call today. Founded
in 2005, Taqa owns stakes in businesses that generate power or
produce oil and natural gas in the  Middle East ,  North America ,
the North Sea and  India .  “We think gas prices will come back,” Stephen Kersley,
chief financial officer, said on the call. “Gas in the $4 to $5
range is far more feasible.”  The shares  rose 3 percent to 1.30 dirhams as of 11:15 a.m.
in  Abu Dhabi  today. The stock has gained 8.3 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
