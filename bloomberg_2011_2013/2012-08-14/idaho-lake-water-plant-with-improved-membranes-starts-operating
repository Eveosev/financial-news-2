A $13 million water-treatment plant
with improved membranes to filter contaminants and particles
from Lake Pend Oreille waters in northern  Idaho  has started
operating.  The facility in Sandpoint, which replaced a sand filter
used for 30 years with a 0.1-micron membrane and expanded its
capacity from 3 million gallons a day to 10 million gallons,
will go through a 14-day testing period and officially go on
line later this year, the Bonner County Daily Bee reported.  Funding for the new plant at the lake, Idahoâ€™s largest,
mostly came from a water bond passed by Sandpoint voters in 2009
as well as higher utility rates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
