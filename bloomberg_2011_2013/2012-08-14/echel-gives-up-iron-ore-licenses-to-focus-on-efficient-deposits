OAO Mechel (MTL) , Russiaâ€™s biggest
producer of coal for steelmakers, gave up two iron-ore licenses
in the Irkutsk region of Siberia to focus on more efficient
deposits.  Korshunov Mining Plant, a  Mechel (MTLR)  unit, quit the
Tatyaninskoe and Krasnoyarovskoe licenses because of a low iron
content in the ore, Mechel said today in an e-mailed response to
questions. The company will instead focus on developing new
iron-ore deposits in Yakutia, home to the Elga coal field.  In March, Mechel acquired licenses for the Sivaglinskoe
deposit, whose 26.4 million metric tons of ore has an iron
content of 53 percent, and the Sutamsky iron-ore area which may
hold as much as 1.35 billion tons of iron ore resources.  To contact the reporter on this story:
