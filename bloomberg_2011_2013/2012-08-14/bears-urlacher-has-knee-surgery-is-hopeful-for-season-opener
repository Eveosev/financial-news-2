Chicago Bears linebacker Brian Urlacher had arthroscopic surgery after experiencing swelling in
the knee he injured during his final game last season.  Urlacher, 34, still hopes to be ready for the Bears’
season-opening game against the  Indianapolis Colts  on Sept. 9
after having the arthroscopic debridement procedure on his left
knee today, the National Football League team said on its
 website.   “I’ll be ready to play, for sure,” Urlacher, an eight-
time Pro Bowl selection, told reporters two days ago. “That’s
really all that matters to me. Preseason games and all these
practices, I’d love to be out there, but I’m not going to put
myself in jeopardy of missing the first game.”  Urlacher hasn’t practiced since July 31 after participating
in Chicago’s first four training-camp sessions. He sat out the
Bears’ offseason training program while recovering from the
injury he sustained in their season-ending win at the  Minnesota
Vikings  on Jan. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
