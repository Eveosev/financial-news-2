New York  Giants wide receiver Hakeem Nicks was activated from the physically unable to perform list
three months after breaking a bone in his right foot and said
he’ll be ready for the season-opening game.  Nicks, the second-leading receiver on the Giants’  Super
Bowl  championship team last season, passed his physical exam
yesterday and is eligible to return to practice for the first
time since the start of training camp.  The 24-year-old Nicks fractured the fifth metatarsal of his
right foot on May 24 while running a route during practice and
had a screw surgically inserted into the broken bone. Nicks said
being activated from the PUP list is an indication he’s on
schedule to play in the Giants’ Sept. 5 National Football League
regular-season opener against the  Dallas Cowboys .  “There have been no setbacks,” Nicks told reporters
yesterday in  Albany , New York. “I’m just going to take it one
step at a time and be out there catching passes from Eli
(Manning) and eventually getting our timing back.”  Nicks caught 76 passes for 1,192 yards and seven touchdowns
last season, second on the team to  Victor Cruz  in all three
categories. The fourth-year receiver led the Giants with 10
catches for 109 yards in the Super Bowl as New York beat the New
England Patriots 21-17.  “It feels good,” Nicks said of his foot injury. “I know
it’s probably going to take me getting over it within my head,
but that’s going to come with more reps on it and getting those
routes down and getting the timing back.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
