U.S. auto and environmental
regulators are delaying, past a self-imposed deadline of
tomorrow, the release of a final rule requiring automakers to
raise the average fuel-economy of their fleets to 54.5 miles per
gallon by 2025.  President  Barack Obama ’s administration didn’t say when it
will issue the rule, which would take effect for model-year 2017
passenger vehicles sold in the U.S.  “The rule is still undergoing interagency review and we
expect that process to be completed soon,” Lynda Tran, a
spokeswoman for the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, said today in an e-mail.  The rule and other administration actions “will nearly
double the efficiency of the vehicles we drive, helping to save
families thousands of dollars at the pump, slashing oil
consumption, and reducing harmful emissions,” Tran said.  NHTSA and the Environmental Protection Agency wrote the
rule, which was released as a proposal in November after Obama
announced an agreement with automakers on it in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
