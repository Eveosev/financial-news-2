Billionaire  George Soros ,  Steven A.
Cohen ’s SAC Capital Advisors LP and Moore Capital Management LP
were among holders of  Facebook Inc. (FB)  shares at the end of June.  The $25 billion Soros Fund Management LLC had 341,000
Facebook shares worth $10.6 million at the end of the period, a
regulatory filing shows. SAC’s 151,450 shares in Menlo Park,
California-based Facebook were valued at $4.71 million, while
Moore’s 15,000 shares were worth $466,000, according to filings.  Facebook raised $16 billion on May 17 in the largest-ever
technology IPO. Investors have been shunning the stock since
then on concern over the company’s ability to make money from
mobile users and amid speculation that insiders will sell shares
when restrictions on the sales are lifted this week. The stock
has fallen 46 percent from its $38 offering price.  Balyasny Asset Management LLC held put options on 650,000
Facebook shares at the end of the period,  filings  show. Put
options give the bearer the right to sell a stock at a
prearranged price at some future date.  Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for Stamford, Connecticut-
based SAC Capital, and  Patrick Clifford , a spokesman for Moore,
declined to comment.  Michael Vachon , a spokesman for Soros, and
Barry Colvin, a vice chairman at Balyasny, didn’t immediately
respond to requests for comment.  Money managers who oversee more than $100 million in U.S.
equities must file a Form 13F within 45 days of the end of each
quarter to list their holdings in stocks that trade on U.S.
exchanges, as well as options and convertible debt.  Tiger Global Management LLC, which was an investor in the
social network before its IPO, owned 1.96 million Facebook
shares valued at $60.9 million at the end of June, filings show.
GLG Partners LP held 695,360 shares worth $21.6 million.  To contact the reporters on this story:
