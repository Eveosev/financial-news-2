U.S. stock-index futures extended
gains, signaling the market may rebound after yesterday’s
retreat, as faster-than-forecast growth in American retail sales
bolstered optimism in the economy.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring next
month increased 0.4 percent to 1,408.6 at 8:35 a.m. in  New York .  The 0.8 percent advance  in retail sales, the first gain in
four months, followed a 0.7 percent decrease in June that was
weaker than first reported, Commerce Department figures showed
today. Economists projected a 0.3 percent rise, according
to the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey. Sales excluding
automobiles also climbed 0.8 percent.  The  S&P 500  fell for the first time in seven days
 yesterday , snapping its longest streak of gains since 2010, amid
concern about slowing Asian economic growth. The index is up
almost 10 percent from a five-month low in June amid speculation
central banks around the world will act to safeguard the global
recovery.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
