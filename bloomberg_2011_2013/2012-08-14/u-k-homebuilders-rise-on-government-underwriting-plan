U.K. homebuilders  gained after the
Financial Times reported that the British government is planning
to stimulate construction by underwriting bonds issued by non-
profit developers.  The plan will lower financing costs for non-profit
developers, known as housing associations, by guaranteeing
debts, the FT reported today, without saying where it got the
information.  Under the plan, housing associations and private developers
would agree to work together on larger housing projects, the FT
said. The proposal would also loosen regulations for publicly
traded homebuilders to include social housing in their
developments, according to the report.  The Bloomberg EMEA Homebuilders Index rose 1.2 percent.
 Persimmon Plc (PSN) , the U.K.â€™s largest homebuilder by market value,
was up 12 pence, or 1.8 percent, at 668 pence at the 4:30 p.m.
in  London , the highest in almost five months.  Bovis Homes Group
Plc (BVS)  rose 1.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
