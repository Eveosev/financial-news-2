European Union regulators suspended
their review of  United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) ’s bid for  TNT Express
NV (TNTE)  to seek more information from the parties on the deal.  The European Commission in Brussels suspended its deadline
for analyzing the transaction, it said on its website. The
decision comes less than a month after the EU regulator had
extended the initial deadline to Dec. 12.  “It doesn’t mean we make any judgments on the merits of
the case,” Ryan Heath, a spokesman for the EU, said by
telephone today. “Once the commission has all the necessary
information, it will reset the clock.”  UPS, the world’s biggest package-delivery company, is
seeking to expand in  Europe  with the biggest deal in its 105-
year history. It will vault to equal footing there with  Deutsche
Post AG (DPW) ’s DHL, the market-share leader. The tie-up with
unprofitable TNT will immediately add to earnings on an adjusted
basis once the deal is done, the company said in March.  The EU regulator previously said there are potential
competition concerns for small parcel delivery services, in
particular international express services, in several European
countries where the companies would have very high combined
market shares.  TNT Express still expects the deal to be completed in the
fourth quarter, Erik van Venetie, a spokesman for the company in
Hoofddorp,  Netherlands , said by telephone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
