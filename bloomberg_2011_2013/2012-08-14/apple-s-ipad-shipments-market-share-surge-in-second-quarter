Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s shipments of iPad
tablets surged 44 percent to 17 million in the second quarter,
giving the company its biggest share of the market in more than
a year as devices from competitors lost ground.  Apple’s market share climbed to 69.6 percent in the quarter
from 58.1 percent in the previous three-month period, according
to a report today from IHS. Cupertino, California-based Apple’s
share of the tablet market hasn’t been that high since the first
quarter of 2011, when it was 70 percent, IHS said.  With tablet sales predicted by research firm  Yankee Group 
to overtake those of personal computers by 2015, Apple is
preparing for challengers for its iPad.  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  later
this year will begin selling its Surface tablet, while Google
Inc. introduced its Nexus 7 device in June.  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) 
debut its Kindle Fire tablet last year.  “Apple is sending a clear message that it plans to
dominate this market over the long term,” said Rhoda Alexander,
an analyst at IHS, in a statement today. “Apple’s major media
tablet rivals, Google Inc. and Microsoft Corp., hope to
challenge Apple in the second half of the year, but will face
formidable headwinds.”  Amazon’s share of the tablet market slipped to 4.2 percent
in the second quarter from 5.8 percent in the previous three
months, IHS said. Samsung Electronics Co. had a 9.2 percent
share in the second quarter, down from 10.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
