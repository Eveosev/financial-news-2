Taiwan ’s dollar rose for the first
time in three days after foreign investors bought the island’s
stocks ahead of a report that economists predict will show U.S.
retail sales rebounded in July.  Global funds bought $151 million more local shares than
they sold yesterday, taking net purchases this month to $1.8
billion, exchange data show. The  Taiex index  of equities rose
0.6 percent and touched the highest level since May.  U.S. retail
sales  increased 0.3 percent last month, the first rise since
March, according to a Bloomberg survey before official figures
today, easing concern the recovery in the world’s largest
economy is losing momentum.  “Foreign funds have been piling into Taiwanese stocks as
they see attractive valuations,” said Tarsicio Tong, a foreign-
exchange trader at Union Bank of Taiwan. The fund flows and
improved sentiment are supporting the currency, he said.  Taiwan’s dollar strengthened 0.1 percent to close at
NT$29.965 against its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei
Forex Inc. It touched NT$30.029 yesterday, the weakest level
since Aug. 3. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, dropped seven basis
points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 3.40 percent.  The yield on Taiwan’s 1.25 percent bonds due March 2022 was
steady at 1.176 percent, according to Gretai Securities Market.
The  overnight money-market rate  was little changed at 0.389
percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Centre.  To contact the reporter on this story:
