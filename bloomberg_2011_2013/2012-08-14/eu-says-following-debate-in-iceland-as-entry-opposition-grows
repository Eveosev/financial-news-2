The European Union is following the
debate in Iceland as opposition to joining the bloc is growing
and will press ahead with negotiations as long as the country is
willing to proceed, said Peter Stano, a spokesman for
Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fule.  “It’s up to Icelanders to decide whether they want to
continue,” Stano said in a telephone interview. “If they
decide to stop the negotiations, of course nobody will force
them to continue.”  Of the 63 lawmakers in the Reykjavik-based  Althingi , 39
oppose continuing talks and may push the body to address the
option of dropping membership preparations before elections next
year, newspaper Morgunbladid reported yesterday, citing its own
tally based on interviews with lawmakers.  Iceland started EU-entry talks in July 2010 and may vote on
accession late next year, according to Foreign Minister Ossur Skarphedinsson. Of a total of 35 negotiating chapters for
membership, Iceland has opened 18 and completed 10, the EU said
in June. The primary challenges relate to agriculture, the
environment and fisheries, according to Fule.  “The European Union didn’t apply for Iceland to become a
member,” said Stano. When Iceland “decided that they wanted to
join we started the process and the member countries agreed with
beginning Iceland’s accession process. If Iceland decides to
stop, nobody will prevent it from doing that.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
