Almost two-thirds of small
businesses in the Federal Reserve Bank of  New York ’s region that
sought credit received some form of financing, according to a
poll conducted by the bank during the second quarter.  Thirteen percent were approved for the entire sum they
requested, 36 percent received a portion of their desired
financing and 14 received an undetermined amount, the survey of
544 small businesses in New York,  New Jersey  and  Connecticut 
showed. Respondents pointed to access to capital as the biggest
growth barrier, with 36 percent citing it as an impediment ahead
of talent or government regulations.  About 59 percent of the firms didn’t apply for credit in
the prior 12 months, with almost half of those opting not to
because they didn’t think they would receive financing, the poll
showed. Those “discouraged” borrowers were typically small and
had weaker sales, according to the New York Fed.  “Results suggest that discouraged firms and those that
could secure only partial financing are challenges in the small
business credit environment,” the New York Fed said in a
statement.  So-called microloans of less than $100,000 were in highest
demand and were tougher to obtain compared with larger ones, the
poll showed. The New York Fed collected responses in April and
May, typically from firms with fewer than 10 employees and less
than $5 million in annual revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
