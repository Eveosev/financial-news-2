Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-
bank lending  rate , opened at 0.14 percent, within the  Federal
Reserve ’s target of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.28 percent yesterday after trading
from 0.05 percent to 0.28 percent and averaging 0.13 percent,
according to ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker.  The central bank will acquire $4.5 billion to $5.5 billion
of Treasuries maturing from August 2020 to May 2022. The
purchases are part of the Fed’s program to replace $267 billion
of short-term debt in its portfolio with longer-term Treasuries
in an effort to keep borrowing costs low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
