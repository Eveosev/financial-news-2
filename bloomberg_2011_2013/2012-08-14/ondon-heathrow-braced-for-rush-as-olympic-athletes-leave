London  Heathrow airport  operator BAA
Ltd. said passenger numbers fell 4.1 percent last month as
Britons stayed at home to watch the Olympics and overseas
travelers delayed visits until after the games.  The customer total across BAA’s five U.K. airports dropped
to 9.63 million, with the number using Heathrow,  Europe ’s
busiest hub, down 4.4 percent from a year earlier at 6.57
million, the unit of Spanish builder  Ferrovial SA (FER)  said today.  While overall figures were lower, Heathrow racked up some
of its biggest totals for passenger arrivals. The busiest day
for incoming travelers in the run up to the Olympics was July
16, when the opening of the athlete village helped lift arrivals
to 103,346 and the total to 216,000, the high for the month.  BAA Chief Executive Officer Colin Matthews said in a
statement that passenger satisfaction scores were at record
levels as the airport drafted in volunteers to help ease travel.  London Gatwick , the capital’s second biggest airport and a
hub for discount and charter carriers, attracted 3.63 million
passengers in July, down 0.1 percent from a year earlier.  The figure was in line with forecasts, given the number of
people putting off vacations “in favor of staying at home to
soak up the Games,” CEO Nick Dunn said in a statement.  BAA sold Gatwick to Global Infrastructure Partners Ltd. for
1.51 billion pounds ($2.4 billion) in 2009 as part of a breakup
ordered by the U.K. Competition Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
