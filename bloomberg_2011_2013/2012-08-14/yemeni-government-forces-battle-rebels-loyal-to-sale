Rebels belonging to  Yemen ’s elite
Republican Guard clashed with Defense Ministry guards today in
the capital, Sanaa.  Soldiers from the Republican Guard, which is led by the son
of former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, have besieged the
ministry building. Government troops were deployed to prevent
the rebels from storming the building and forces are also
protecting the central bank.  Turmoil continues in Yemen even after a peace accord under
which Saleh stepped down after months of protests against his
33-year rule and was replaced in February by Abdurabuh Mansur Hadi, his deputy. Hadi is trying to reorganize the armed forces
and bring stability to the impoverished Arab nation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
