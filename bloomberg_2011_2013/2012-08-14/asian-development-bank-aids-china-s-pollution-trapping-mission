The  Asian Development Bank  is
helping  China  to trap and bury carbon-dioxide emissions as the
nation seeks to meet growing power demand without adding to
pollution.  The ADB will work with China on the demonstration and
deployment of so-called carbon capture and storage technology
with a grant of $2.2 million, the Philippines-based bank said
today in a  statement  on its website.  The world’s second-biggest economy is promoting low-carbon
technologies to meet a target of cutting greenhouse-gas
emissions by 17 percent per unit of gross domestic product in
its five-year plan through 2015. Nations from the U.K. to  Canada 
are promoting CCS because it gathers emissions from power
generation and industry for storage underground, though no
large-scale project at a fossil-fuel plant currently operates.  “There is an urgent need to fast-track the demonstration
and deployment of  carbon capture  and storage in the People’s
Republic of China to cut CO2 emissions from the energy and
industrial sectors and achieve the country’s long-term climate
change mitigation goals,” Annika Seiler, finance specialist for
energy at ADB’s East Asia department, said in the statement.  Incomplete policy, low financial support and inadequate
international funding are the main barriers to CCS in China,
according to the ADB. A planned road map will help initiate at
least two CCS demonstration projects by 2016, according to the
statement. The ADB will help assemble a team of experts to
advise the Chinese government on the plan.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
