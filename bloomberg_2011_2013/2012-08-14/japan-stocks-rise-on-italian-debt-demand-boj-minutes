Japanese  stocks  rose, with the
 Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average rising the first time in three days, as
minutes from the Bank of  Japan  showed policy makers weren’t
ruling out any options to boost the economy and on expectations
U.S. retail sales rose in July.  Uniden Corp. (6815) , an electronic equipment maker that counts
North America as its biggest market, climbed 5.9 percent.  Makita
Corp. (6586) , a maker of power tools that gets more than 40 percent of
its sales in Europe, rose 1.9 percent after the yen weakened.
Keisei Electric Railway Co. soared 6 percent after its price
estimate was raised by Nomura Holdings Inc. Nippon Yusen K.K.,
Japan’s top shipping line, slid 1.7 percent after the sector’s
rating was cut to neutral by JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The Nikkei 225 rose 0.5 percent to 8,929.88 at the 3 p.m.
close in  Tokyo . Volume was about even with the 30-day average
even as many traders took the week off for the O-bon holiday.
The broader  Topix (TPX)  Index added 0.4 percent to 749.53 today, with
more than three times as many shares advancing as falling.  “The markets don’t have many catalysts today,” said
Yoshihiro Ito, chief strategist at Okasan Online Securities Co.
in Tokyo. “The yen is slightly weakening, which is boosting
shares, and the situation abroad is calming down, including in
the U.S.”  The Topix has fallen 14 percent from this year’s peak on
March 27 on concern earnings would be hurt by  Europe ’s debt
crisis and slower growth in  China  and the U.S. The decline has
cut the price of shares on the gauge to 0.9 times book value,
compared with 2.2 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.5
for the Europe Stoxx 600 Index. A number less than one means
companies can be bought for less than the value of their assets.  Yen Weakens  Shares rose today after Japan’s currency slid against all
16 major counterparts, boosting the value of overseas income for
exporters. The yen fell as low as 78.46 to the dollar today in
Tokyo, compared with 78.30 at the close of  stock trading 
yesterday, and weakened to as low as 96.96 against the euro from
96.17.  Makita rose 1.9 percent to 2,832 yen. Shimano Inc., a
bicycle parts maker that gets more than 35 percent of its sales
in Europe, jumped 4 percent to 5,720 yen.  The  Bank of Japan  is weighing ways to expand stimulus and
prop up growth, according to minutes from a meeting last month
released today. Governor Masaaki Shirakawa and his colleagues
refrained from addition easing at the meeting, expanding an
asset-purchase program, while cutting its loan facility by the
same amount.  U.S. Retail  Exporters to North America gained on expectations U.S.
retail sales rose in July for the first time in four months as
employment picked up, economists said ahead of the Commerce
Department report today. The projected 0.3 percent advance
follows a 0.5 percent drop in June, according to the median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Uniden soared 5.9 percent to 181 yen. Noritsu Koki Co., a
photo-processor maker that generates almost 40 percent of its
sales from  North America , added 1.7 percent to 353 yen.  Keisei Electric Railway gained the most on the Nikkei 225,
rising 6 percent to 765 yen after Nomura raised the stock price
estimate for the railway operator 20 percent to 890 yen and
maintained a buy rating.  Shipping lines declined the most among the Topix’s 33
industry groups after JPMorgan cut the sector’s rating to
neutral from bullish, saying earnings momentum may deteriorate
through September. The  Baltic Dry Index (BDIY) , a measure of shipping
costs for commodities, fell for a 25th day yesterday, the
longest losing streak since February.  Nippon Yusen slid 1.7 percent to 171 yen and rival Mitsui
O.S.K. Lines Ltd. lost 2.2 percent to 218 yen. Kawasaki Kisen
Kaisha Ltd, the third-biggest shipper, sank 2.7 percent to 110
yen.  -- With assistance from Masaaki Iwamoto in Tokyo. Editors:  Jim
