Farmers in  Brazil  and Argentina are
forecast to plant more soybeans for harvesting this season in
response to higher prices, at the expense of wheat and corn
sowing, Oil World wrote.  Oilseed planting in Brazil will climb to a record 28.6
million hectares (70.7 million acres) from 27 million hectares
in 2011-12, the Hamburg-based researcher wrote in an e-mailed
report today.  Soybean prices have risen 19 percent in  Chicago  in the past
12 months, while corn prices advanced 11 percent. Brazil will
overtake the U.S. as the world’s largest soybean exporter in
2012-13, the U.S. Department of Agriculture forecasts.  “Brazilian farmers have already been active sellers of
new-crop soybean supplies to take advantage of the current
favorable prices,” Oil World wrote. “In the domestic market
soybean prices have been much more attractive for farmers than
corn owing to the ample domestic corn supplies.”  Brazil’s soybean area for harvesting in 2013 is forecast to
climb to 26.8 million hectares from 25 million hectares, while
the corn area is seen slipping to 14.7 million hectares from
15.1 million hectares.  An estimated 37 percent to 40 percent of next year’s
Brazilian soybean crop has been sold, compared with 12 percent
normally sold at this time of year, Oil World said.  Farmers in  Argentina  are predicted to sow 23.5 million
hectares of oilseeds, from 21.7 million hectares in 2011-12. The
soybean area is expected to climb to 20.1 million hectares from
18.7 million hectares and sunflowers will cover 2.1 million
hectares from 1.85 million hectares, Oil World wrote.  Argentina’s corn area is predicted to be 4.4 million
hectares from 5.03 million in the previous season and wheat is
forecast to be planted on 3.6 million hectares from 4.63 million
hectares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
