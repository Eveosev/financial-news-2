William A. Ackman, founder of
Pershing Square Capital Management LP, sold his  Kraft (KFT)  Foods Inc.
stake and bought about 21.9 million shares of  Procter & Gamble
Co. (PG)   Ackman also got rid of his stake in Family Dollar Stores
Inc., according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
filing yesterday that reflects holdings as of June 30.  Previously Ackmanâ€™s Pershing Square owned about $589.4
million of Northfield, Illinois-based Kraft and $165.5 million
of Matthews, North Carolina-based Family Dollar, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Pershing paid about $1.34 billion
for its P&G stake.  P&G, based in Cincinnati, is working to save $10 billion by
2016 by cutting jobs to improve its declining  profit . Considered
an activist investor, Ackman may push for leadership changes at
P&G, according to people familiar with the matter.  P&G, the maker of Tide laundry detergent, rose 0.4 percent
to $66.73 yesterday at the  New York  close. The shares have
gained 9.1 percent in the past 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
