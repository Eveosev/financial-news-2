Ethanol rose for the first time in
three days as gasoline gained and rains across the Midwest are
expected to bring only scattered relief to the corn crop.  Prices rose as gasoline settled above $3 a gallon for the
third time in four days. Much of the corn-growing region remains
parched and will get little help from forecast rain, according
to Joel Widenor, co-founder of Commodity Weather Group LLC in
Bethesda,  Maryland . The drought has left crops across the region
in the worst shape since 1988.  Denatured ethanol for September delivery rose 1.1 cents, or
0.4 percent, to settle at $2.576 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board
of Trade. It was the first increase since Aug. 9.  Corn for December delivery slid 3.25 cents, or 0.4 percent,
to $7.89 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  September-delivery gasoline rose 1.07 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $3.0014 a gallon on the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
