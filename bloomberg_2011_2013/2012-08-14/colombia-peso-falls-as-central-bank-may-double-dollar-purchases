Colombia’s peso fell the most in two
weeks after central bank co-director Cesar Vallejo said policy
makers are considering doubling daily dollar purchases to $40
million to curb the currency’s rally.  The peso slid 0.5 percent to 1,803.19 per  U.S. dollar ,
paring this year’s gain to 7.6 percent. That’s still the best
performance after the Chilean peso among 170 currencies tracked
by Bloomberg.  Vallejo’s comments in an interview yesterday come after
Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry urged Banco de la
Republica to raise minimum daily dollar purchases from $20
million, saying a strengthening peso threatens to undermine
local industry and farmers. Last month the central bank reversed
course and unexpectedly cut borrowing costs for the first time
since 2010 to buoy growth.  “Investors are carefully watching the risk of currency
intervention,” said Bernd Berg, an emerging-markets strategist
at Credit Suisse Group AG in Zurich. With growth momentum
declining and officials seeking to weaken the peso to support
exporters, traders “turn more cautious on the medium-term
outlook for the currency,” he said.  Colombia ’s central bank also lowered its 2012 economic
growth forecast on July 27 to a range of 3 percent to 5 percent
from a range of 4 percent to 6 percent. The quarter-point cut in
the overnight lending rate to 5 percent surprised 24 of 35
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The peso will likely trade in a range between 1,780 and
1,830 over the next couple of months, Berg predicts.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent peso-denominated debt
due in July 2024 closed unchanged at 6.64 percent, according to
the central bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
