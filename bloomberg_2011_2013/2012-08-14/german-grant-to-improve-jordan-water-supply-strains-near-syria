Germany  has granted Jordan, where
Syrian refugees in the north are straining water and health
resources, funds to upgrade its water network and drill new
wells.  Most of the 10 million-euro ($12.4 million) pledge by
Development Minister Dirk Niebel during a visit to Jordan will
go to strengthen water mains, dig wells and boost the number of
water tankers, the Economic Cooperation and Development Ministry
in Berlin said yesterday in a statement.  At least 150,000 Syrians fleeing their country’s civil
conflict have come to Jordan since May 2011, according to the
government. That’s put pressure on authorities to secure water
supplies that are already limited for both local residents and
the refugees, Water and Irrigation Minister Mohammad Najjar said
at the grant-signing ceremony.  To contact the reporter on this story:
