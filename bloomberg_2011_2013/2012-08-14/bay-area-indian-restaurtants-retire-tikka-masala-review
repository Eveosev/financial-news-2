San Francisco ’s Indian restaurants
are selling lighter and tangier dishes from the lower half of
the subcontinent.  Coconut flavors and seafood reign. Chicken tikka masala is
outre.  There’s a “vast sphere of Indian cuisine beyond the idea
of curry,” says Niloufer King, author of “My Bombay Kitchen.”  A Mumbai native, she has lived in the Bay area for more
than three decades. “This openness to regional cuisines could
be part of the growing trend towards micro-specialization.”  The variety of Indian food in San Francisco now trumps even
that in the  South Bay , home to Silicon Valley’s large Indian
population.  For surf-and-turf options in the city, start in the Mission
District.  Dosa is the best spot for a broad sampling of unfamiliar
Indian food. Both branches offer a tasting menu, while the
regular menu includes explainers and suggestions such as eating
with hands and ordering family-style. It’s one of only two
Indian places on the San Francisco Chronicle’s Top 100
Restaurants.  The namesake signature dish is a rolled-up crispy rice and
lentil crepe. The staple masala dosa ($11), served with spiced
potatoes and a trio of chutneys, is great for lunch.  Bollywood Music  Truffle oil dosa seems to go hand in hand with the
nightclub-style decor and obligatory Bollywood music. Wash it
down with the spicy Bloody Mary ’Curry’ ($8.50).  For dinner, the Chennai chicken appetizer ($10) almost
demands a drink, perhaps a Bengali gimlet ($10). Follow with
mango prawns ($17) and fish moilee ($29).  Dosa is at 995 Valencia St. and 1700 Fillmore St.

that’s its charm. The vegetarian menu harks back to the quick-
serve restaurants all over  India  that trace their roots to
Karnataka state’s Udupi region. Duck in for a combination meal
($11.95) of a vada, a donut-sized lentil dumpling; an idli, a
steamed rice cake; and a dosa. Or snack on uthapam, a savory
rice and lentil pancake ($7.95 and up).  Udupi Palace is at 1007 Valencia St. Information: +1-415-
970-8000;  http://www.udupipalaceonvalencia.com .  Coastal Cuisine  Gajalee serves cuisine of the Konkan coast, which includes
parts of Maharashtra, Goa and Karnataka. It isn’t affiliated
with the namesake chain in Mumbai but took me back home.  Start with calamari tossed with curry leaf ($7) and move on
to the whole, semolina-crusted pompano stuffed with spices and
pan fried ($17). Scoop up the Malvani fish masala ($13), which
gets its name from a town 300 miles (about 500 km) south of
Mumbai, with kombdivade, puffy bread made with rice and chickpea
flour. If you’re eating alone get the fish thali, a substantial
platter with vegetables, rice, bread and dessert ($17).  Wash everything down with sol kadhi ($3), a drink
traditionally made with kokum, a cousin of tamarind. Considered
a digestive, it has a unique sweet-and-sour flavor.  Gajalee is at 525 Valencia St. Information: +1-415-552-
9000.  Portuguese Influence  Viva Goa specializes in food of the former colony of
 Portugal , the country instrumental in bringing the chili pepper
to India. The Portuguese influence stands out in the popular
vindaloos ($9.99 and up) and in the lesser-known sorpotel
($12.99) -- a curried dish of pork meat, liver and fat with a
vinegar tang.  Don’t miss sour-and-spicy Goa fish curry ($11.99) and the
xacutti ($11.99), a curry made with coconut and poppy seeds.
Indulge in bebinca ($3.99), a multilayered cake made with
coconut milk.  Viva Goa is at 2420 Lombard St. Information: +1-415-440-
2600;  http://www.vivagoaindiancuisine.com .  Ruchi brings dishes native to Andhra Pradesh state, along
with an amalgam of South Indian cuisine. Pesarattu ($8) is a
great choice for an early lunch, a heartier version of a dosa.  For dinner, pair thick kal dosa ($8) with Nellore fish
curry ($12), which has a hint of tamarind and originates from
the namesake city near the  Bay of Bengal . Don’t miss Ruchi’s
take on the Hyderabadi biryani ($12), traditionally made by
cooking marinated meat and rice together.  Ruchi is at 474 3rd St. Information: +1-415-392-8353;
