Cameroon will treat 4,930 hectares
(12,182 acres) of cocoa farms for black pod disease, a fungus
that affects the beans, said Voundi Jacquinot, an official with
the Ministry of Agriculture and  Rural Development .  The areas to be treated are South, South West and Centre,
he said in a statement handed to reporters in Yaounde, the
capital, today. The work will be done before December, Jacquinot
said.  Black pod fungus spreads rapidly in times of heavy rain and
inadequate sunshine. Cameroon is  Africa â€™s fourth-biggest
producer of the chocolate ingredient.  To contact the reporter on this story:
