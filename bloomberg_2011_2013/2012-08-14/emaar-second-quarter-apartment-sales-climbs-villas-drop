     Aug. 14 (Bloomberg) -- Emaar Properties PJSC, the developer
of the world’s tallest tower in Dubai, said second-quarter
revenue from apartment sales more than doubled from the year-
earlier period. Sale of villas dropped 3 percent during the
period.  Income from apartment sales climbed to 699.3 million
dirhams ($190 million) from 265.6 million dirhams a year
earlier, according to  Emaar’s financial statement  posted on
Dubai’s stock market today. Revenue from sale of villas fell to
325.7 million dirhams from 337 million dirhams, while income
from the sale of land and commercial units declined to 116.2
million dirhams from 596.5 million dirhams.  Emaar said on July 29 that second-quarter profit more than
doubled, beating analysts’ estimates, as a one-time impairment
charge was not repeated and it cut costs. The company provided a
breakdown of revenue today.  The developer said the money owed by Amlak Finance PJSC,
the mortgage lender being reorganized by the United Arab
Emirates’ government, was lowered to 524 million dirhams at the
end of June from 595 million dirhams at the end of last year.
The amount is unsecured and earns an average return ranging from
1.4 percent to 3.13 percent a year compared with 3.13 percent to
4 percent lat year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
