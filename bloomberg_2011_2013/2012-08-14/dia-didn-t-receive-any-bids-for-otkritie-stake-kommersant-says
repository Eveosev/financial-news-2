Russia’s Deposit Insurance Agency
didn’t receive any bids for its 24.17 percent stake in Otkritie
Bank, Kommersant  reported , citing unidentified people close to
the lender.  The state-backed DIA received a stake in Otkritie after it
partnered with the lender to acquire RBR Commercial Bank in
November 2008 and VEFK Bank in April 2009. Otkritie later
consolidated its banking assets into a commercial bank. The DIA
was willing to accept bids of 7.5 billion rubles ($236 million)
for the stake, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
