(Corrects to say some companies signed gas purchase
agreements with Gazprom in second paragraph of story published
yesterday.)  Thirteen Turkish companies including
 Aygaz AS (AYGAZ) , owned by  Koc Holding AS (KCHOL) ,  OMV AG (OMV) ’s unit OMV Enerji and
Aksa Dogalgaz, a unit of Kazanci Holding AS, applied to the
energy-market regulator for licenses to import natural gas from
Russia.  Maya Petrol, Uzman Enerji, Angora Gaz, Bosphorus Gaz,
Nature Gaz, Hattusa Gaz, Bati Hatti Dogalgaz Ticaret, Akfel Gaz,
Coren Enerji and Kibar Enerji also applied to the Ankara-based
regulator, the state-run Anatolia news agency reported at the
weekend. Some of the companies have signed gas purchase
agreements with  Gazprom OAO (GAZP) , it said.  The companies will compete for 6 billion cubic meters of
gas, about 15 percent of  Turkey ’s annual consumption, which
state pipeline company Boru Hatlari ile Petrol Tasima AS, or
Botas, imported from  Russia  via Bulgaria, under a contract that
expired at the end of last year, according to the agency. The
pipeline supplies gas mainly to Istanbul, Turkey’s biggest city.  The firms are required to set up facilities within five
years to store as much as 10 percent of their annual gas imports
after starting operations, the agency said. The regulator last
year rejected all 26 firms that applied for gas import licenses
because they failed to sign contracts with Gazprom, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
