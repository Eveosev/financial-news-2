Isofoton SA, a Spanish photovoltaic-
panel maker, will begin construction next month on a $150
million solar plant in the  Dominican Republic .  Isofoton signed an agreement with the government in the
last week to sell power from the 50-megawatt project, which will
be located 15 kilometers (9.3 miles) from the capital city of
 Santo Domingo , the Madrid-based company said today
in a statement. Isofoton is part of the Affirma Group, according
to its website.    To contact the reporter on this story:
