The  Czech Republic  needs to stick to
the government’s proposed fiscal measures to cut the deficit to
below the European Union’s limit of 3 percent of economic output
next year,  CTK  newswire said, citing Premier Petr Necas.  The lower house of parliament approved in July a government
bill raising the value-added tax rates and creating a new tax
bracket for higher earners.  The upper house, controlled by the opposition Social
Democrats who are against the changes, is likely to reject the
proposed legislation at a session starting tomorrow. The lower
house may overturn the Senate’s vote in a new ballot.  To contact the reporter on this story:
