Corn and soybeans gained on
speculation that recent rains haven’t been enough to ease
drought conditions in the U.S. Midwest.  The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  left its corn crop
ratings unchanged yesterday, with 23 percent of fields in good
or excellent condition, while soybean ratings rose to 30 percent
in top  condition  from 29 percent a week earlier. Crops remained
in the worst shape since 1988. Areas of Iowa, Illinois and
Indiana got an inch (2.5 centimeters) of rain in the past seven
days, after having less than half the normal amount of moisture
in the past three months, National Weather Service data show.  “We would caution that the improvement in crop conditions
is small and does not change the overall bleak supply outlook,”
 Luke Mathews , a commodity strategist at  Commonwealth Bank of
Australia (CBA) , said in a report today.  Corn for December delivery rose 0.7 percent to $7.975 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade by 1:12 p.m. in London,
after dropping 3.9 percent in the previous two sessions.
Soybeans for November delivery advanced 0.5 percent to $16.0825
a bushel, after sliding 2.6 percent yesterday.  Corn touched a record $8.49 a bushel on Aug. 10 while
soybeans rallied to $16.915, the highest ever, on July 23. The
USDA slashed its forecast for the U.S. corn harvest by 17
percent on Aug. 10, projecting this year’s output at 10.779
billion bushels, a six-year low. Soybean production may total
2.692 billion bushels, the least since 2007.  Wheat for December delivery rose 0.6 percent to $8.8125 a
bushel in  Chicago . In Paris, November-delivery milling wheat
gained 0.3 percent to 258 euros ($319) a metric ton on NYSE
Liffe.  Russian Wheat  Russia ’s wheat crop may total 41.3 million tons, 10 percent
less than previously forecast, according to an estimate from
Paris-based farm adviser Agritel. The country’s exports will
slide to 8 million tons from last month’s forecast of 11
million, the company said in a report e-mailed yesterday.
Russia, the world’s third biggest wheat shipper last season, has
suffered from drought this year.  Egypt , the world’s biggest wheat importer, is seeking at
least 60,000 tons of the grain at a tender today, the  General
Authority  for Supply Commodities said yesterday. The country
purchased 120,000 tons of Russian wheat on Aug. 11. Algeria also
is seeking to purchase wheat, Agritel wrote on its website
today, without saying where it got the information.  To contact the reporters on this story:
