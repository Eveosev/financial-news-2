Japan’s Coast Guard said it will
prevent a group of  Hong Kong  activists from reaching disputed
islands in the  East China Sea , where a ship collision almost two
years ago soured relations between China and Japan.  Seven activists, four crew members and two journalists are
en route to islands known as Diaoyu in Chinese and Senkaku in
Japanese, David Ko, a spokesman for the group, said by telephone
today. They are expected to reach the area on Aug. 16, after
stopping for supplies in Taiwan, he said.  “The Coast Guard patrols the area around the Senkaku
islands 24 hours a day, 365 days a year,” Mariko Inoue, a
spokeswoman for Japan’s Coast Guard, said by telephone today.
“Of course, if a ship approaches from outside, we will prevent
it from getting there.”  The group, known as the  Action Committee for Defending the
Diaoyu Islands , intends to assert Chinese sovereignty by fishing
in the waters, Ko said. When Japan detained a Chinese captain
for 17 days in 2010 after his vessel collided with two Japanese
Coast Guard ships, China cut off ministerial talks.  Japan is also involved in a territorial spat with  South
Korea  over separate islets known as Dokdo in Korea and Takeshima
in Japanese. Japanese Prime Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  may postpone
a summit next month with South Korean President  Lee Myung Bak 
after Lee’s visit to the islets on Aug. 10, the Nikkei newspaper
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
