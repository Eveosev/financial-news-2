Telenet Group Holding NV (TNET)  denied a
report in L’Echo that it made an offer to acquire  Royal KPN NV’s (KPN) 
Base unit.  “I would like to confirm that Telenet will no longer
pursue an acquisition of Base as we formally stated yesterday,”
Vincent Bruyneel, a spokesman for the Mechelen, Belgium-based
company, said in an e-mail.  The Belgian newspaper today said Telenet last week
submitted a provisional offer for Base, KPN’s Belgian mobile-
phone operator. The bid envisages a joint acquisition of Base by
Telenet and fellow cable operator Voo, L’Echo said.  Telenet may make a binding offer for Base within two weeks,
L’Echo said, citing people familiar with the matter without
identifying them. That contradicts a statement from the company
earlier this week that it “is not pursuing any significant
acquisitions in the foreseeable future.”  “We don’t know where the rumors in L’Echo are coming from
but we would like to keep up our reputation of being transparent
to the financial markets,” Bruyneel said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
