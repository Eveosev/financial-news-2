Military Commercial Joint-Stock
Bank (MBB) ’s shares climbed to a two-month high as trading volumes
surged to a record on speculation the Hanoi-based lender is
close to selling a stake to a partner.  The stock gained 2.8 percent to 14,700 dong today in Ho Chi
Minh City Stock Exchange trading, the highest level since June
7. More than 22 million  shares  of Military Bank, as the lender
is known, changed hands today, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s the most since the stock debuted in November
and compares with the three-month daily average of 1.36 million.  “There is a rumor that a strategic partner is going to buy
a 15 percent stake of Military Bank,” said  Attila Vajda , a Ho
Chi Minh City-based broker at ACB Securities Co. “We are not
sure if it is true.”  Military Bank has been in talks with a foreign partner,
though there had been no result from the discussions yet, Deputy
Chief Executive Officer Cao Thi Thuy Nga said in a mobile-phone
text message in response to questions from Bloomberg. Any stake
sale would be less than 15 percent, she said.  Shares of Military Bank have rallied 42 percent this year,
outpacing a 22 percent increase in the benchmark VN Index.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
