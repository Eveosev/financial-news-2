Home Depot Inc. (HD) , the largest U.S.
home-improvement retailer, reported second-quarter profit that
topped analysts’ estimates and raised its forecast for profit
this year as customers spent more on remodeling projects.  Net income increased 12 percent to $1.53 billion, or $1.01
a share, from $1.36 billion, or 86 cents, a year earlier, the
Atlanta-based company said today in a statement. Analysts
projected 97 cents, the average of 25 estimates in a Bloomberg
survey.  Chief Executive Officer  Frank Blake  has reduced costs since
the housing crisis and shifted spending to new technology,
including handheld devices for employees to help customers find
merchandise and ring up purchases. Sales by stores open at least
a year rose 2.1 percent, the fifth straight quarterly increase,
as consumers visited more often and spent more per trip.  “It was a quarter of strong execution,”  John Tomlinson ,
an analyst at ITG Investment Research in  New York , said today by
telephone. His firm doesn’t rate shares. “They did a great job
on cost savings.”  Operating  expenses  declined 2.7 percent to $4.46 billion.
Revenue advanced 1.7 percent to $20.6 billion, trailing
analysts’ projection of $20.7 billion as warm weather pulled
sales into the previous quarter. Comparable-store sales trailed
the 2.6 percent average estimate of analysts surveyed by
Swampscott, Massachusetts-based researcher Retail Metrics.  Home Depot rose 3.6 percent to $54.71 at the close in New
York. The  shares  have climbed 30 percent this year.  Spending Gains  The number of purchases increased 0.6 percent to 374.9
million, and the average transaction value rose 1.8 percent to
$55.02, Home Depot said.  Profit this year will be about $2.95 a share, the company
said today. That’s up from a previous  forecast  of $2.90 and tops
analysts’ $2.92 average estimate.  Home Depot is benefiting from signs of life in the U.S.
housing market. Single-family housing  starts  have accelerated in
four straight months for the first time since 2010.  The rebound still is being tested by weak job gains, a
backlog of foreclosures and tight mortgage lending. The rate of
new-home sales slowed in June by more than 8 percent from the
previous month, the largest decline since February 2011.  Lowe’s Cos. (LOW) , the second-biggest home improvement retailer,
plans to report second-quarter results Aug. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
