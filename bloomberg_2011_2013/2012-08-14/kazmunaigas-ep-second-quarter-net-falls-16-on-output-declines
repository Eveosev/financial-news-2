KazMunaiGas Exploration Production (KMG) ,
the London-listed unit of  Kazakhstan ’s state-owned energy
company, said profit slumped 16 percent in the second quarter
from a year earlier as output and global  oil prices  declined.  Net income dropped to 46.2 billion tenge ($309 million)
from 55.3 billion tenge a year earlier, KazMunaiGas EP said
today in a statement. Total revenue fell 10 percent to 218
billion tenge.  Output fell about 3.5 percent in the second quarter to 3.03
million metric tons, or 248,000 barrels a day, according to
Bloomberg calculations based on first-half and first-quarter
results. Average Brent prices declined about 7 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  KazMunaiGas EP cut the output target for its biggest unit,
Uzenmunaigaz for this year, which “changes the picture for next
year, that is, the earlier announced production forecast for
2013 will probably also be corrected,” Abat Nurseitov, Deputy
General Director for Production, said today on a conference
call. The updated plan will available at the end of this year,
he said.  Output at Uzenmunaigaz will probably be 5 million tons this
year, rather than 5.8 million tons as earlier planned after
declines in the first half because of the effects of labor
unrest last year, bad weather in the first quarter and
deteriorating infrastructure and equipment, the company said.  The stock rose 0.1 percent to $18.60 by 2:57 p.m. in
 London , reversing losses of as much as 3.1 percent.  KazMunaiGas EP may cut  capital expenditures  by a
preliminary $35 million from the planned exploration spending
for this year, after canceling some drilling, Murat Mustafayev,
chief geologist, said on the conference call.  The Astana, Kazakhstan-based oil producer is preparing an
appeal of a tax assessment of 16.9 billion tenge for 2006 to
2008 based on an audit completed July 12 by Kazakhstan’s Tax
Committee, according to today’s statement.  In the first half, an increase in domestic prices helped
offset dropping exports and output in the first half of the
year. Total revenue fell 1.7 percent, while profit increased 6
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
