Estee Lauder  Cos., the maker of Mac
cosmetics and Clinique skin care, rose the most in nine months
after the company reported fourth-quarter profit and sales that
topped analysts’ estimates.  Estee Lauder advanced 9.3 percent to $60.13 at the close in
New York for the biggest jump since Nov. 3. The shares have
gained 7.1 percent this year.  Growth in China and airport stores and a jump in online
sales aided profit in the quarter, according to a statement
today.  Internet sales  could double as a percentage of total
revenue in the next five years from 5 percent today, Chief
Executive Officer Fabrizio Freda said. China and other overseas
markets will drive the online gain as sales climb to levels seen
in the U.S. and U.K., he said.  “We have proven to be able to grow in a growing market
like  China , but also in soft markets like  Italy ,” Freda said in
an interview.  Net income for the period ended June 30 rose 25 percent to
$51.2 million, or 13 cents a share, from $41.1 million, or 10
cents, a year ago, the company said. Excluding restructuring
costs, Estee Lauder earned 17 cents a share, topping the average
analyst estimate of a cent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Total sales jumped 9.2 percent to $2.25 billion, from $2.06
billion a year earlier. Analysts had estimated revenue of $2.21
billion.  For the current quarter, Estee Lauder forecast profit
excluding restructuring charges of 71 cents to 77 cents a share,
trailing analysts’ average estimate of 78 cents, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
