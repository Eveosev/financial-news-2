A ruling by  Germany ’s highest court
on the European Stability Mechanism, the euro-area’s future
permanent financial backstop, is unlikely to be delayed by a
complaint from plaintiffs led by German Professor Markus Kerber,
the  Handelsblatt  newspaper said.  There is no indication that a postponement of the Sept. 12
ruling has been ordered as a result of the complaint,
Handelsblatt said, citing a spokeswoman for the Karlsruhe-based
Federal Constitutional Court it didn’t name. Nobody could be
reached at the court’s press department when contacted by
Bloomberg News.  Germany’s top court is unlikely to allow proceedings at the
 European Court of Justice  to sway it from the deadline it has
set itself next month, the newspaper cited constitutional law
expert Joachim Wieland from the School of Administrative Science
in the town of Speyer as saying.  Kerber asked the Karlsruhe court to await the European’s
court’s ruling before issuing its own opinion.  Irish lawmaker Thomas Pringle, who challenged legislation
on the permanent backstop, was referred to the  European court 
after Ireland’s  Supreme Court  ruled that it can’t block the
government from ratifying domestic legislation on the ESM.  To contact the reporter on this story:
