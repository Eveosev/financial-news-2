Electricite de  France  SA, delayed
the start of its Chooz B-2, Cruas-1 and Paluel-3 nuclear power
plants, according to data on the website of grid operator Reseau
de Transport d’Electricite.  EDF gave start dates for its Chinon B-1, Fessenheim-2 and
Gravelines-1, RTE data show. The start date for Cruas-4 was
removed from RTE’s website.  The world’s biggest nuclear power plant operator has 37
reactors online, representing 64 percent of available nuclear
capacity, RTE data show. That’s the lowest since June 20. EDF’s
58 atomic plants generate about 78 percent of France’s power.  The table below lists EDF’s nuclear units that are out of
service, their generating capacity in megawatts, when they
stopped and the expected return date, if known, according to
RTE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
