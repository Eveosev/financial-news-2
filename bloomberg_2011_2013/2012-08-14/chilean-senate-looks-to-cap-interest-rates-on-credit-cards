Chile’s Senate will work with the
government to introduce legislation that would regulate the
maximum interest rate credit card companies can charge, the
Senate said in a  statement  posted on its website yesterday.  Introduced in part by Senate Economic Committee President
Eugenio Tuma, the proposal would complement a bill already under
discussion in Congress that would lower the maximum rate banks
can charge on some consumer loans, the Senate said. Senators
haven’t yet defined a maximum rate for credit cards.  To contact the reporter on this story:
