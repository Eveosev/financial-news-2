Portugal’s economy  shrank for a
seventh quarter in the three months through June as the
government cuts spending and raises taxes to trim its budget
gap.  Gross domestic product declined 1.2 percent from the first
quarter, when it fell 0.1 percent, the Lisbon-based National
Statistics Institute said in a preliminary report today.
Economists predicted a decline of 0.7 percent, the median of
nine estimates in a Bloomberg survey showed. GDP dropped 3.3
percent from a year earlier, the biggest decline since the
second quarter of 2009.  Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  is facing a recession
and rising unemployment as he seeks to meet the terms of a 78
billion-euro ($96 billion) aid plan from the European Union and
the  International Monetary Fund . As the country’s borrowing
costs surged,  Portugal  last year followed Greece and Ireland in
requesting a bailout.  To contact the reporter on this story:
