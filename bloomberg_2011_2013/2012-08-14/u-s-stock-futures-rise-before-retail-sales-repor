U.S. stocks  erased gains, sending
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lower for a second day, as a
slump in technology and financial shares reversed an earlier
rally amid better-than-estimated retail sales.  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  and  Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO)  posted the
 biggest declines  in the  Dow Jones Industrial Average . The S&P
500 Financials Index slipped 0.1 percent after earlier rising as
much as 0.7 percent.  Alcoa Inc. (AA)  retreated 1.6 percent, pacing
losses among commodity stocks.  Home Depot Inc. (HD)  increased 3.6
percent after quarterly earnings topped analysts’ estimates.  The S&P 500 dropped less than 0.1 percent to 1,403.93 at 4
p.m. in  New York , after earlier rising as much as 0.4 percent.
The Dow added 2.71 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to
13,172.14. Volume for exchange-listed stocks in the U.S. was
about 5.2 billion shares today, 20 percent below the three-month
average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The light volume demonstrates there’s just little
conviction right now,” Peter Tuz, who helps manage about $800
million as president of Chase Investment Counsel Corp. in
Charlottesville,  Virginia , said in a telephone interview. “It
is a symptomatic of the fact that people are just not that
interested in the equity market.”  Stocks rose early in the day after U.S. retail sales
climbed more than forecast in July as  consumer spending 
rebounded at department stores, auto dealers and electronics
outlets. The 0.8 percent advance, the first gain in four months,
followed a 0.7 percent drop in June, Commerce Department figures
showed. Economists projected a 0.3 percent rise, according to
the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey.  Producer Prices  A separate report showed wholesale prices increased more
than forecast in July, reflecting higher costs for automobiles,
cigarettes and pharmaceuticals.  Stocks worldwide advanced earlier after the Federal
Statistics Office in  Germany  said gross domestic product rose
0.3 percent from the first quarter. Economists predicted a 0.2
percent increase, according to the median of 40 estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey. French GDP was unchanged in the quarter,
better than the 0.1 percent decline economists had predicted.  “The market was up earlier on light volume,” said Eric Teal, chief investment officer at First Citizens Bancshares
Inc., which manages $4.5 billion in Raleigh,  North Carolina ,
said in a telephone interview. “The economic news has been
generally on the uptrend in the last few weeks despite ongoing
European concerns. With some of the summer seasonal factors
affecting the market, volume’s going to be soft.”  Volatility Index  The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index
rebounded after four days of losses, climbing 8.4 percent to
14.85. The gauge known as the  VIX (VIX)  lost 7.1 percent to 13.70
yesterday, the lowest level since June 2007.  U.S. equity volume yesterday reached the lowest level since
at least 2008 excluding holidays. About 4.5 billion shares
changed hands on all venues, the lowest level in data compiled
by Bloomberg going back four years that excludes the days
surrounding New Year’s, Christmas, Thanksgiving and Independence
Day.  Hewlett-Packard, the world’s largest maker of personal
computers, slid 1.3 percent to $19.36. Cisco, the largest maker
of computer-networking gear, lost 1 percent to $17.17.  Intel
Corp. (INTC) , the world’s largest chipmaker, retreated 0.8 percent to
$26.48.  Juniper Networks Inc. (JNPR)  erased 4.5 percent to $18.07 for
the biggest decline in the S&P 500.  Groupon Sinks  Groupon Inc. (GRPN)  plunged 27 percent to $5.51, the lowest level
since the company’s initial public offering in November. The
largest daily-deal website reported second-quarter revenue that
missed estimates as economic weakness in  Europe  curbed online
coupon sales. Revenue rose 45 percent to $568.3 million, the
Chicago-based company said yesterday. That fell short of the
average analyst estimate of $575.3 million, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Commodity companies lost 0.5 percent for the biggest drop
out of 10 groups in the S&P 500. Alcoa, the largest U.S.
aluminum producer, retreated 1.6 percent to $8.69. The  S&P 500 (SPX) 
Financials Index slipped 0.1 percent after earlier rising as
much as 0.7 percent.  Retailers had the biggest gain out of 24 groups in the S&P
500, climbing 0.9 percent.  Home Depot, the largest U.S. home-improvement retailer,
rose 3.6 percent to $54.71 for the biggest rally in the Dow.
Sales by stores open at least a year advanced 2.1 percent, the
fifth straight quarterly increase, as consumers visited more
often and spent more per trip.  Estee Lauder Cos., the maker of Mac and Clinique skin care,
added 9.3 percent to $60.13. Profit in the  fourth quarter  was 17
cents a share, exceeding the average analyst estimate by 1 cent.
Revenue during the period was $2.25 billion, beating the average
projection of $2.21 billion.  Monster Beverage Corp. (MNST)  climbed 10 percent, the most in the
 S&P 500 , to $58.59. The board of directors at the largest U.S.
energy drink maker authorized an additional $250 million in
buybacks, according to a statement from the company yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
