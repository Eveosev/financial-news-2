Copper rose in  New York  for the
first time in three sessions as stronger-than-estimated U.S.
retail sales and German economic growth bolstered the demand
outlook for the metal.  Retail sales in the U.S. increased 0.8 percent in July, the
first gain in four months and above the 0.3 percent median
forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists. The German economy
expanded 0.3 percent in the second quarter from the prior
period, more than the 0.2 percent estimate of economists,
Federal Statistics Office figures showed. The U.S. and Germany
are the second- and third-biggest consumers of the metal.  “There’s more optimism out there, and that’s what the
market is reflecting,”  Michael Smith , the president of T&K
Futures & Options in  Port St. Lucie , Florida, said in a
telephone interview. “We seem to be seeing more good economic
reports lately, so we may be turning the corner. And any good
news out of Europe is going to have a direct impact on copper.”  Copper futures for December delivery climbed 0.2 percent to
settle at $3.371 a pound at 1:06 p.m. on the Comex in New York.
The contract fell 2.1 percent in the previous two sessions.  China  is the largest copper consumer.  Stockpiles monitored by the  London  Metal Exchange slid 0.7
percent to 237,500 metric tons, the lowest since June 11, daily
exchange figures showed.  On the LME, copper for delivery in three months rose 0.3
percent to $7,416 a ton ($3.36 a pound).  Nickel for delivery in three months on the LME added 0.6
percent to $15,470 a ton. Orders to remove the metal from
warehouses jumped 57 percent to 15,630 tons, the highest since
at least October 1997, on bookings in Johor,  Malaysia .  Tin advanced in London, while lead and aluminum fell. Zinc
was unchanged.  To contact the reporters on this story:
