Sugar output in  India , the world’s
second-biggest producer and largest consumer, will fall for the
first time in four years in the season starting in October
because of dry weather, according to  Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG)   India’s production will fall 8 percent to 24.2 million
metric tons in 2012-13, after rising for three consecutive
years,  Kona Haque , an analyst at the bank in London, wrote in a
report e-mailed today. The monsoon, which accounts for more than
70 percent of its annual rainfall, has been 17 percent below
average since June 1, said the  India Meteorological Department .  “Even if rainfall improves over the coming weeks, a lot of
the damage has already been inflicted on this year’s output,”
Haque said. “Yields will fall sharply in the southern states
due to adverse weather.”  India’s sugar consumption will climb to 24.6 million tons
from 24.2 million tons in 2011-12, Macquarie estimates. The
country will export 2.8 million tons of the sweetener in the
current season and will be unable to keep shipping in 2012-13,
Haque said.  “Although the country will not have to dip into imports
due to opening stocks of around 3 million tons, we think it will
no longer be in a position to export,” Haque said.  Sugar prices in India have climbed 25 percent since June on
concerns about the next season’s output, Macquarie said. That’s
resulted in a halt to sugar exports as local prices exceeded
international levels, making shipments no longer economical, she
said.  Indian cane farmers may opt to sell their sugar cane to
producers of gur, an unrefined sweetener, as cane price arrears
reached a historical level in March, she said. That means the
farmer will sell to whichever industry can pay him faster,
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
