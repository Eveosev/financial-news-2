CEZ AS (CEZ) , the biggest Czech utility,
rose the most in almost three months after faster-than-expected
economic growth in Germany helped to lift the price of
electricity to a three-month high.  The stock increased 1.9 percent to 740 koruna, the steepest
one-day advance since May 21, outperforming the 1 percent gain
for the country’s 14-member  PX (PX)  equity index.  Power for next-year delivery in Germany, Europe’s biggest
economy that buys part of CEZ’s output, climbed as much as 0.5
percent to 50.25 euros per megawatt-hour. Stocks and commodities
rose after data today showed German economic growth and U.S.
retail sales beat estimates, while France avoided an economic
contraction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
