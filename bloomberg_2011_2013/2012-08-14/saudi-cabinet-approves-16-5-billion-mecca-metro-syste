Saudi Arabia ’s Cabinet approved the
construction of a metro system in the holy city of Mecca that
will cost $16.5 billion, the Saudi Press Agency reported.  The system, which is to have 182 kilometers (113 miles) of
track, will be built in three stages, with the first completed
in 2015 and the last finished by 2022, SPA said yesterday,
citing a statement from the Cabinet. The project includes a new
bus network to support the train, the  news agency  said.  The government last month shortlisted four groups to submit
bids to build the first electrical subway network connecting
major areas of its capital city,  Riyadh . The four groups, which
include France’s  Vinci SA (DG) ,  Siemens AG (SIE) , Canada’s  Bombardier Inc. (BBD/B) 
and  Strabag SE (STR) , central  Europe ’s biggest construction company,
should present their financial and technical bids for the
project within four months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
