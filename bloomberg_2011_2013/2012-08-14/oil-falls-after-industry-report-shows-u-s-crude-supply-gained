Crude was little changed in  New York 
ahead of reports today that may show U.S. manufacturing expanded
and fuel stockpiles declined, reinforcing speculation that
demand is improving in the worldâ€™s biggest oil user.  Futures rose as much as 0.1 percent, after dropping 0.5
percent earlier in the day, before a Federal Reserve report
projected to show output at factories, mines and utilities
increased 0.5 percent in July, according to the median forecast
in a Bloomberg survey. The U.S. Energy Department may report
today that stockpiles fell by 1.5 million barrels, according to
a separate Bloomberg News  survey .  Oil for September delivery traded at $93.24, down 18 cents,
at 4:14 p.m. Tokyo time. It earlier dropped to $92.97. The
contract advanced 70 cents yesterday to settle at $93.43. Prices
are down 5.5 percent this year.  Brent crude  for September settlement, which expires
tomorrow, was at $113.90 a barrel, down 13 cents, on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange. It rose 43 cents yesterday to
$114.03. The more-active October contract was at $112.06 a
barrel, down 9 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
