The  National Bank of Belgium  may
require the nation’s banks to hold more capital than required
under international rules agreed on by the  Basel Committee on
Banking Supervision ,  L’Echo reported , without saying how it
obtained the information.  The central bank will seek information from lenders this
month on how they plan to meet the new international standards,
known as Basel III, according to the newspaper.  The Basel rules are scheduled to begin being phased in at
the start of 2013. They would more than triple the amount of
core capital that lenders must hold compared to previous
international standards.  L’Echo didn’t say how large the extra requirements for
Belgian banks would be.  To contact the reporter on this story:
