The U.S. government’s finances have
deteriorated “gradually” since  Standard & Poor’s  stripped the
country of its top grade, Nikola Swann, an analyst for the
credit-rating company, said in an interview with newswire MNI.  America has had an AA+ rating with a negative outlook since
Aug. 5, 2011, when S&P downgraded the country for the first
time, citing the government’s failure to agree on a plan to
reduce deficits. The grade may be cut again by 2014, the New
York-based unit of McGraw-Hill Cos. said in a June 8 report.  “The U.S. fiscal profile has continued to gradually
deteriorate since last summer, at a rate in-between our base-
case scenario and our downside scenario of August 2011, keeping
the U.S. at the high end of our indebtedness range,” Swann said
in an  interview  published today by MNI.  Bond investors ignored the downgrade last year, driving
Treasury yields to the lowest levels in history, amid concern
the  U.S. economy  was stalling and as Europe’s debt crisis
intensified. Treasuries have returned about 6.4 percent since
the rating cut as of yesterday, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data.  The U.S. lacks a plan to regain the top rating, S&P analyst
 John Chambers  said in a February interview on  Bloomberg Radio .
The U.S. rating will come under pressure if policymakers fail to
agree on a deficit-cutting plan, Swann told MNI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
