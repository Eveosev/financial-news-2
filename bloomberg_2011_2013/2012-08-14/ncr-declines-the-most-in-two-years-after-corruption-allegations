NCR Corp. (NCR) , a maker of automated
teller machines and payment systems, tumbled the most in two
years after saying it received allegations about business
practices that might violate U.S. laws.  The information was delivered anonymously from a
“purported whistleblower,” Duluth, Georgia-based NCR said
today in a regulatory  filing . The actions alleged “might
constitute violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act,”
the filing said.  Should NCR be found guilty, it could be required to pay
penalties and its ability to generate revenue in certain parts
of the world may come under pressure, said Douglas Greiner, an
analyst at Compass Point Research & Trading LLC. The allegations
concern practices in  China , the  Middle East  and  Africa .  “The potential impact is legal risk and competitive
risk,” Greiner said.  Lou Casale, an NCR spokesman, didn’t return requests for
comment.  NCR shares fell 9.8 percent to $22.65 at the close in New
York, the biggest decline since April 23, 2010.  Some of the allegations relate to NCR’s business in Syria,
where it has ceased to operate, according to the filing.  “NCR has certain concerns about the motivation of the
purported whistleblower and the accuracy of the allegations it
received, some of which appear to be untrue,” the company said.
“NCR takes all allegations of this sort seriously and promptly
retained experienced outside counsel and began an internal
investigation that is ongoing.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
