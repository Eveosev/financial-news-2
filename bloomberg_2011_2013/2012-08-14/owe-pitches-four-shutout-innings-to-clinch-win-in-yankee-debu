Derek Lowe  pitched four shutout
innings for his first save since 2001 in his New York Yankees
debut, helping his new team to an 8-2 win over the Texas Rangers
in a matchup of the American League’s top two clubs.  Lowe signed with the Yankees yesterday as a free agent, two
days after the team put pitcher CC Sabathia on the 15-day
disabled list with a sore elbow. After David Phelps held the
Rangers to two runs in five innings, Lowe came on in relief and
limited Texas to two hits the rest of the way.  “He really saved our bullpen,” Yankees manager  Joe Girardi  said of Lowe. “His sinker was really good, his slider
was good and he got a lot of ground ball outs.”  Nick Swisher  hit a grand slam for his 200th career home run
and finished with five runs batted in.  Eric Chavez  added a homer
for the AL East-leading Yankees (68-47), who have won five of
their past six games. The Rangers fell to 67-47.  Lowe, 39, joined the Yankees three days after being
released by the Cleveland Indians. The 16-year Major League
Baseball veteran had an 8-10 record with a 5.52 earned run
average in 21 starts for the Indians this season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
