TUI AG (TUI1) , the owner of Europe’s
largest travel company, said third-quarter earnings rose as
revenue at the hotel and cruises divisions increased.  Underlying earnings before interest, taxes and amortization
rose to 102.3 million euros ($126.4 million) in the three months
through June from 96.2 million euros a year earlier, Hanover,
Germany-based TUI said in a  statement  today. That beat the 95.5-
million euro average of six analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  TUI completed the sale of a 17.4 percent stake in shipping
company Hapag-Lloyd to investor group  Albert Ballin  in June to
focus on tourism, and it has retained the right to sell its
remaining 22 percent holding in an initial public offering. The
company is also considering an offer for the Central European
tourism operations of its  TUI Travel (TT/)  Plc unit, people familiar
with the talks said this month. TUI reiterated today that full-
year sales will rise “moderately” and operating profit will
increase.  Sales gained 8 percent to 4.72 billion euros. That beat the
4.6 billion-euro average of seven analysts’ estimates compiled
by Bloomberg.  The tourism division, which includes a controlling stake in
TUI Travel as well as investments in holiday resorts and  cruise
ships , reported underlying Ebita of 122.4 million euros compared
with 104.5 million euros last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
