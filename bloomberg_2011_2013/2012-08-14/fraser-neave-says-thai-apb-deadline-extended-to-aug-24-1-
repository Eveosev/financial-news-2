Fraser & Neave Ltd. (FNN) , the company
that controls 40 percent of southeast Asian beermaker  Asia
Pacific Breweries Ltd. (APB) , said today a Thai bidder agreed to
extend the deadline for its offer for a stake in APB by more
than a week.  Kindest Place Groups, owned by the son-in-law of Thai
billionaire  Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi , offered to buy 7.3
percent of APB from Singapore-based F&N for S$55 ($44.10) a
share, potentially compromising an earlier offer from  Heineken
NV (HEIA) , the world’s third-biggest brewer, to take full control of
APB at a lower price.  The deadline for F&N to make a decision on Kindest Place’s
offer was originally Aug. 16 and was extended today to Aug. 24,
F&N said in a statement to the  Singapore  Stock Exchange.  Heineken already owns 42 percent of Singapore-based APB and
offered to buy F&N’s stake in the company at S$50 a share
followed by a mandatory tender offer for the remaining shares.
F&N’s board recommended its offer on Aug. 3.  Heineken, based in Amsterdam, has been seeking to protect
its hold over APB, a key emerging market asset, as sales growth
slows in developed economies including western  Europe  and the
U.S. Thai Beverage Pcl, controlled by Charoen, last month bid
for a 22 percent in F&N as Kindest Place bought 8.4 percent of
APB at the same time.  Heineken had said Kindest Place’s bid for the 7.3 percent
stake is “not comparable” to its offer for total control of
APB, and commented that its bid “represents compelling value”
for F&N and APB’s shareholders.  Heineken’s  shares  rose 0.2 percent to 44.08 euros in
Amsterdam. Heineken and F&N partially control APB through a
joint venture. F&N’s shares closed down 0.5 percent at S$8.55 in
Singapore before the announcement. APB’s shares rose 0.3 percent
to S$50.15.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
