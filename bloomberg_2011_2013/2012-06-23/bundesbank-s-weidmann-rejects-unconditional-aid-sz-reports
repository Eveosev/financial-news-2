Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann
has rejected calls by Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti  that
billions of euros in aid should be provided without having to
meet the conditions imposed, Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported in a
preview of an article to appear today.  Weidmann added in an interview that the proposal would
violate European Union agreements on state financing through
“printing presses,” the newspaper said.  Monti had called for the  European Central Bank  to buy
sovereign bonds, including from Spain and Italy, to reduce their
borrowing costs, the newspaper said. Monetary policy should be
tightened to ensure that the financial costs to member countries
will be limited, SZ cited Weidmann as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
