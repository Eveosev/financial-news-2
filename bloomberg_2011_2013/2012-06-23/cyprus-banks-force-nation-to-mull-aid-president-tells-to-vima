The need to recapitalize Cypriot
banks after taking losses on Greek  government bonds  is the
reason the island nation is facing a possible bailout, the
country’s president told  To Vima  in an interview.  The country is not facing a bailout “because of the
financial state of the economy but because of the need to
recapitalize Cypriot banks, which were significantly exposed to
the  Greek economy ,” President Demetris Christofias told the
Athens-based newspaper.  The so-called troika of the European Commission, the
European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund has
operated like a  “colonial force” by forcing austerity
measures and neo-liberal policies on bailed-out countries, the
newspaper cited Christofias as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
