Syria ’s President Bashar al-Assad,
battling civil unrest and calls for his removal from office,
retained key ministers including those handling the defense and
finance portfolios as he appointed a new prime minister.  Riad Hijab, a former agriculture minister, was named the
premier, the state-run  Syrian Arab News Agency reported . The 
cabinet, which replaces the 14-month-old government of Adil
Safar, will retain Dawoud Rajhah as defense minister, Walid al-
Muallem as foreign minister, Mohammad al-Jleilati as finance
minister and Mohammad Ibrahim al-Shaar as interior minister,
according to SANA. Said Muzi Hneidi will replace Sufian Alao as
oil minister.  The announcement came after Syria shot down a Turkish
military plane over the  Mediterranean Sea , further straining
relations between the neighbors that have been inflamed by
Syria’s repression of the uprising. A total of 25 people were
killed by Syrian forces today amid fighting across the country,
 Al Jazeera  reported, citing the Syrian Human Rights Network.  Syrian government forces have failed to crush the 15-month
revolt in a crackdown that the United Nations estimates has left
more than 10,000 dead. Assad, 46, is fighting to extend his
family’s four-decade hold on power. While more than 70 percent
of Syria’s population is  Sunni Muslim , Assad and the ruling elite
are in a minority, belonging to an offshoot of the Shiite branch of
Islam that predominates in Iran.  To contact the reporter on this story:
