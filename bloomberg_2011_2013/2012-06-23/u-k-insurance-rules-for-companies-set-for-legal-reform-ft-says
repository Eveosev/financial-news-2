The insurance rules for U.K.
companies may be changed for the first time since 1906 under
reforms proposed by the nationâ€™s Law Commission, the Financial
Times reported.  The new regulations would make it more difficult for
insurers to turn down claims by arguing claimants had failed to
disclose information that underwriters might consider relevant,
the London-based newspaper reported, citing unidentified people
with knowledge of the matter.  The Law Commission, which is responsible for reviewing
outdated laws, is expected to announce its proposals next week,
according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
