Doux SA,  Europe ’s largest chicken
processor, is for sale, Le Parisien reported, citing the
company’s court-appointed administrator.  The company, 80 percent owned by the Doux family, has close
to 430 million euros ($540 million) in debt, the newspaper
reported. Administrator Regis Valliot said the state of the
firm’s treasury forced him to look for a buyer, according to Le
Parisien.  To contact the reporter on this story:
