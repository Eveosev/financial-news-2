Aeon Co. (8267) , Japan’s biggest
supermarket chain, may sell assets into a real estate investment
trust to raise funds amid expansion overseas and acquisitions.  The retailer said it’s considering setting up the REIT
though “nothing has been formally decided,” in a statement
today to the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  The Japanese mall operator’s debt increased as it made
acquisitions to grow amid a recovery in demand following the
March 2011 natural disasters. Last year it agreed to pay 45
billion yen for regional grocers Marunaka Co. and Sanyo Marunaka
KK, to expand in the western part of the country.  Aeon had debt of 1.4 trillion yen ($17.4 billion) for the
fiscal year through February 2012, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Aeon’s property trust may raise as much as 200 billion yen
in an initial public offering this year, the Nikkei newspaper
reported earlier today, without citing anyone. The trust will
also borrow to fund as much as 300 billion yen in purchases of
20 or more properties from the mall operator, the report said.
Aeon will use proceeds from the IPO, the biggest by a Japanese
REIT, to build more shopping centers, Nikkei said.  The offering would be biggest in  Japan ’s equity market this
year, surpassing the 151 billion yen raised by  Mazda Motor Corp. (7261) 
in March. Companies have raised 479 billion yen in 45
transactions in the market so far in 2012, compared with 108
totaling 1.47 trillion yen in 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  The retailer this month agreed to buy 50 percent of Tesco
Plc’s Japan operation for a “nominal sum.” Aeon’s net income
rose 12 percent to 66.8 billion yen in the 121 months ended Feb.
29, the company reported in April.  Aeon has said it aims to drive growth by expanding in large
cities in Japan as well as entering retail markets in Vietnam
and  Cambodia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
