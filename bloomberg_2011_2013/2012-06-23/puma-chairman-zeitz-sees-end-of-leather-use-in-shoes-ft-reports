Puma SE (PUM) ,  Europe ’s second-largest
sporting-goods maker, will one day stop using leather in its
sports shoes and soccer boots because of the damage it causes to
the environment, the Financial Times reported, citing Jochen Zeitz, the company’s supervisory board chairman.  “I think eventually we’ll have to look at alternative
materials, there’s no question about it,” Zeitz, 49, said in an
interview at the Rio+20 summit, according to the London-based
newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
