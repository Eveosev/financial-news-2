Spain has a 1-0 lead over France at
halftime of their quarterfinal at soccer’s European Championship
on a headed goal from  Xabi Alonso .  Alonso, who is playing his 100th match for Spain, headed in
a cross from Jordi Alba in the 19th minute. The defending
champions controlled almost 70 percent of play in the opening
half, and had nearly 330 completed passes, double that of
France.  The winner of tonight’s match at Donbass Arena in Donetsk,
Ukraine will play Portugal in the semifinal.  Spain manager Vicente del Bosque added midfielder Cesc
Fabregas to replace striker  Fernando Torres  from the squad that
beat Croatia 1-0 in their last group game, going without a
striker against France.  France started with attacking midfielder Sami Nasir on the
bench, replacing him with another defender in preparation for
the Spanish attacks.  France hadn’t lost in 23 matches before losing to  Sweden  in
their last group game, ending the second-longest stretch without
defeat in its history.  Spain won the last European Championship and the 2010  World
Cup . France is the last team to knock Spain out of a
international tournament, winning a quarterfinal at the 2006
World Cup.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
