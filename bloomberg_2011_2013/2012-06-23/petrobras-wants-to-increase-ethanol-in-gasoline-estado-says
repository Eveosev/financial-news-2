Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Brazil’s
state-controlled oil company, wants to increase the amount of
ethanol used in gasoline to 25 percent, the head of the
company’s biofuels unit said yesterday, according to  O Estado de S.
Paulo .  The increase in ethanol content from the current 20 percent
will help ease fuel imports, Estado quoted Miguel Rossetto as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
