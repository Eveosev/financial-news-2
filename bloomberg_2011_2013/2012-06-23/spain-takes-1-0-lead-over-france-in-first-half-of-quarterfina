Spain took a 1-0 lead over France in
their quarterfinal at soccer’s European Championship when  Xabi
Alonso  scored in the first half.  Alonso, who is playing his 100th match for Spain, headed in
a cross from Jordi Alba in the 19th minute. The winner of
tonight’s match at Donbass Arena in Donetsk, Ukraine will play
Portugal in the semifinal.  Spain manager Vicente del Bosque added midfielder Cesc
Fabregas to replace striker  Fernando Torres  from the squad that
beat Croatia 1-0 in their last group game, going without a
striker against France.  France put midfielder Sami Nasir on the bench, replacing
him with another defender in preparation for the Spanish
attacks.  France hadn’t lost in 23 matches before losing to Sweden in
their last group game, ending the second-longest stretch without
defeat in its history.  Spain won the last European Championship and the 2010  World
Cup . France is the last team to knock Spain out of a
international tournament, winning a quarterfinal at the 2006
World Cup.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
