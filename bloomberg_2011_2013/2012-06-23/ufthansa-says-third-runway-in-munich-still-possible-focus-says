Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  Chairman
Christoph Franz said Munich residents may reconsider their
opposition to a third runway for the city’s airport as capacity
becomes tighter in a few years,  Focus  magazine reported.  The citizen vote to overturn the plan was “shortsighted”
and “also a bit arrogant,” the magazine quoted Franz as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
