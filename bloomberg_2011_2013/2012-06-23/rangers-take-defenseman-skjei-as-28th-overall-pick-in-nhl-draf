The New York Rangers selected
defenseman Brady Skjei as the 28th overall pick in the National
Hockey League draft.  Skjei had four goals and 18 assists in 56 games with the
U.S. Hockey’s National Team Development Program last season.  Skjei, 18 said he looked forward to skating under coach
 John Tortorella .  “I have seen Tortorella on film and I like the way he
coaches,” Skjei said. “He demands a lot and I’m a hard worker
so it’s good.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
