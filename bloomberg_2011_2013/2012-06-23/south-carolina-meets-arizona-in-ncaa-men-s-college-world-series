Two-time defending national champion
the University of  South Carolina  will meet the University of
 Arizona  in the finals of the College World Series.  South Carolina defeated Arkansas 3-2 yesterday to advance
to the best-of-three National Collegiate Athletic Association
baseball finals for the third consecutive year in Omaha,
Nebraska.  The Gamecocks, down by two runs to none, rallied in the
fifth inning to tie the score and then took the lead in the
seventh inning when Joey Pankake scored on a bases-loaded walk.  The teams meet for Game 1 tomorrow night with the second
game scheduled for the following night. If a third and deciding
game is needed, it will be played June 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
