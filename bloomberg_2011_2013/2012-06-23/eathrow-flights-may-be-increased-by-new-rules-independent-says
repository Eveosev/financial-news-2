London ’s Heathrow airport could
increase capacity by as many as 10 million passengers a year by
introducing so-called mixed mode flying, allowing runways to be
used for both take off and landing, the Independent reported.  Regulations being implemented next month will permit
simultaneous runway use in more circumstances, the newspaper
said. If extended further, the policy would enable Heathrow to
offer 15 percent more take off and landing slots, the London-
based newspaper said, citing a study by the air-traffic provider
NATS.  Heathrow, the U.K.’s busiest airport, operates near full
capacity, and the government has ruled out building a third
runway. The measure wouldn’t be an immediate capacity solution,
a NATS spokesman said, according to the Independent.  A trial of new rules aimed at reducing delays at Heathrow,
including allowing more overnight flights from  North America  and
Asia to land before 6 a.m., will begin on July 1, according to
the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
