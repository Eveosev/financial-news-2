U.K. 30-year government bonds rose
for the first time in three weeks on speculation the Bank of
England will expand its bond-buying program and focus purchases
on longer-maturity debt.  Ten-year gilts outperformed German bunds after minutes
released on June 20 showed Governor  Mervyn King  and three other
policy makers pushed to expand the so-called quantitative easing
program at their meeting this month, and were overruled 5-4 in a
vote. Sterling fell against the dollar on concern increased
asset purchases will debase the currency.  “I think the Bank of England will have to buy more long-
dated gilts than it did in the last round of quantitative
easing,” said  Sam Hill , a fixed-income strategist at Royal Bank
of Canada in  London . “Strong hints from the bank that more QE
is coming underpins the outlook for gilts.”  Thirty-year gilts advanced, pushing yields down 13 basis
points, or 0.13 percentage point, from last week to 2.96 percent
at 5 p.m. London time yesterday. The price of the 4.5 percent
security maturing in December 2042 rose 3.025, or 30.25 pounds
per 1,000-pound ($1,558) face amount to 130.655.  The  extra yield  investors demand for holding 10-year gilts
instead of similar-maturity German bunds narrowed to 14 basis
points, the lowest on a closing-market basis since Jan. 4, from
23 basis points last week.  RBC forecasts the  Bank of England  will increase the size of
the asset-purchase program by 75 billion pounds, to 400 billion
pounds, next month.  Economic Contraction  Longer-maturity gilts may extend gains next week, as a
report on June 28 will show the U.K. economy contracted 0.3
percent in the first three months of this year, according to
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  The pound fell 0.9 percent to $1.5581 this week and was
little changed at 80.5 pence per euro.  Sterling slid 1.7 percent in the past month, the worst
performer among 10 developed-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar fell 0.4
percent and the euro dropped 1.6 percent.  Gilts have returned 2.4 percent this year, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies as of June 21. German bunds rose
2.6 percent, and  U.S. Treasuries  gained 1.9 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
