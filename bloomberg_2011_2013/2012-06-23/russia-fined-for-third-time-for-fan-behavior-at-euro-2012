Russian soccer’s governing body was
fined 35,000 euros ($44,000) by the organizers of the European
Championship over the behavior of its fans.  UEFA issued the fine after Russian fans set off and threw
fireworks and displayed illicit banners during the Group A match
against  Greece  in Warsaw on June 16. It’s the third fine for the
Russian federation over supporter actions at the Euros.  The body was previously fined 30,000 euros for similar
incidents, as well as a fan entering the field, during the game
against co-host Poland in Warsaw on June 12.  The Russians were also fined 120,000 euros after fans
attacked stewards at the game against the  Czech Republic  in
Wroclaw, Poland, on June 8. UEFA also said Russia would be
docked six points in the next qualifying for the European
Championship if fans are involved in similar incidents again.  Russia failed to progress from the group stage of the
tournament, finishing third in four-team Group A.  UEFA also said it’s opened disciplinary proceedings against
Portugal after a fan tried to enter the field during the 1-0
quarterfinal win over Czech Republic in Warsaw two days ago.
UEFA will hear the case in two days, according to a  statement 
from the governing body.  To contact the reporter on this story:
