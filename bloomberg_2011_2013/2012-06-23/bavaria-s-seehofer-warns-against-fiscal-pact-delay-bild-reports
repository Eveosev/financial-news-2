A delay in Germany’s ratification of
 Europe ’s permanent bailout fund would send a “fatal signal” to
markets, Bavarian Prime Minister  Horst Seehofer  told  Bild am
Sonntag  newspaper in an interview.  Seehofer repeated that the federal government should boost
funding in certain areas, including a 1.5 billion-euro ($1.9
billion) increase in next year’s transport budget, in exchange
for states’ support for the European fiscal pact, Bild said in
an e-mailed preview of an interview to be published tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
