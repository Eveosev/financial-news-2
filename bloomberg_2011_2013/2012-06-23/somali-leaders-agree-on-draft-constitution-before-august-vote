Somali political leaders agreed on a
draft constitution as a step toward elections to be held in less
than two months to replace a transitional government, said
 Augustine Mahiga , the  United Nations ’ representative to the
country.  The charter must be approved by a constituent assembly,
which will meet for discussions next month, and then voted on in
a national referendum, Mahiga said in an e-mailed statement. The
agreement followed a meeting in the capital, Nairobi, attended
by President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, Speaker Sharif Hassan
Sheikh Adan, Prime Minister Abdiweli Mohamed Ali, Puntland’s
President Abdirahman Mohamed Mohamud, and the president of
Galmudug, Mohamed Ahmed Alin, it said.  The country is to have a new constitution by next month and
the Western-backed transitional government should be stepping
aside for an elected government by Aug. 20. “The transitional
period will end in less than 60 days and we have no time to
lose,” Mahiga said.  Somalia has had no effective central government since the
downfall of dictator Mohamed Siad Barre more than two decades
ago. The Horn of Africa government for the past five years has
been battling the al-Qaeda-linked al-Shabaab militia that seeks
to gain control of the country and establish Islamic law.  To contact the reporter on this story:
