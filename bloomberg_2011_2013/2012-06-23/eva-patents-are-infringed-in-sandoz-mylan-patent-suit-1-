Patent claims that  Teva
Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA)  brought against  Novartis AG’s (NVS) 
Sandoz unit,  Mylan Inc. (MYL)  and  Momenta Pharmaceuticals Inc. (MNTA)  are
infringed, valid and enforceable, a federal judge ruled.  U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones in Manhattan today ruled
that drug applications for the multiple sclerosis medicine
Copaxone made by Sandoz and Mylan “infringe all of the asserted
claims,” according to a court order.  The order doesn’t name Momenta, though in a statement
issued by Globe Newswire, the company’s Chief Executive Officer
Craig Wheeler said the company will appeal the ruling.  “We are disappointed that the court determined that Teva’s
patents were valid and infringed, and we look forward to reading
the full opinion to understand its reasoning,” Wheeler said in
the statement. “We remain confident in our legal position and
we intend to appeal.”  Teva sued Basel, Switzerland-based Novartis and Cambridge,
Massachusetts-based Momenta, saying that copies of Copaxone
would infringe four patents that expire in 2014.  Nina Devlin, a Mylan spokeswoman, and Novartis spokeswoman
Julie Masow didn’t immediately return calls after regular
business hours seeking comment on the ruling.  The case is Teva Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. v. Sandoz Inc.,
08-cv-07611, U.S. District Court, Southern District of  New York 
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
