Sharing debt between countries using
the euro isn’t a solution to the region’s crisis, said a senior
lawmaker in a party allied with  Chancellor Angela Merkel .  It’s not acceptable for “German savers, German companies
and the German state to pay for failed speculation” in Spain
and elsewhere, Hans Michelbach, the Christian Social Union’s
ranking member in parliament’s finance committee, said at a
meeting in Munich for medium-sized companies. His comments were
circulated by e-mail.  Stuctural changes are the way through the euro crisis,
Michelbach said.  The CSU, a party in the southern state of Bavaria, is
allied to Merkel’s  Christian Democratic Union .  To contact the reporter on this story:
