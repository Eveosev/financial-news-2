Wendel,  France â€™s largest publicly
traded investment firm, has almost 1.5 billion euros ($1.9
billion) in its treasury and is ready to buy five or six
companies, Investir-Le Journal des Finances  reported , citing an
interview with Chief Executive Officer Frederic Lemoine.  Wendel is looking particularly in France,  Germany  and the
Benelux region, Lemoine told the weekly. The CEO excluded
investing in biotechnology or information-technology companies
because they require particular expertise, or in industries such
as casinos and tobacco that would raise ethical and image
questions, Investir said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
