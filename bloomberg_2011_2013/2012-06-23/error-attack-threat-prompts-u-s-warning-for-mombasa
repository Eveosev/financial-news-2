The U.S. Embassy in  Kenya   warned  of
a possible “terrorist attack” in  Mombasa  and ordered all of
its staff to leave or avoid traveling to the port city until at
least July 1.  Although U.S. citizens are not bound by the same
restrictions as government workers, travelers should consider
the advice when planning their trip, according to a statement
dated yesterday on the Nairobi-based embassy’s website. “This
is to alert all U.S. citizens in Kenya, or planning to travel to
Kenya in the near future, that the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi has
received credible information of an imminent threat of a
terrorist attack in Mombasa, Kenya.”  The al-Qaeda-linked al-Shabaab militia has threatened to
carry out attacks in Kenya after the country deployed its army
in neighboring southern Somalia in mid-October to fight the
group. Al-Shabaab has waged a campaign since 2007 to oust the
United Nations-backed transitional government in Somalia.  The Kenyan army’s move followed a string of bomb attacks in
Nairobi, the capital, which have killed at least nine people,
and others in Mombasa and towns near the northeastern border
with Somalia. Kenyan police this week arrested two Iranians in
Nairobi suspected of terrorism, the  Associated Press  reported
yesterday, citing Aggrey Adoli, the police chief in charge of
the coast.  Authorities in Mombasa also seized 15 kilograms of a
powdery substance that could be used to make explosives after a
tip-off from one of the suspects, Adoli said, according to AP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
