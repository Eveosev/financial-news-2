Spanish  government bonds  had their
biggest weekly advance in almost five months and Italian
securities rose on optimism policy makers are taking steps to
reduce the borrowing costs of the region’s lower-rated nations.  Spain ’s 10-year yields fell from a euro-era high after
French President  Francois Hollande  said leaders are exploring
letting a euro-area rescue fund buy debt from countries that
have taken fiscal-consolidation steps. Similar-maturity
 Portuguese rates  fell below 10 percent for the first time in
more than a year after Finance Minister Vitor Gaspar said the
nation is “determined” to meet its deficit target. German
 bunds  fell for a third consecutive week.  “As long as the market is starting to see progress, then
it gives it a bit of confidence,” said Pablo Zaragoza, head of
interest-rate strategy for  Europe  and the U.S. at Banco Bilbao
Vizcaya Argentaria SA in  Madrid . “It is seeing that policy
makers might take some steps to rein in yields. That’s helped
Spanish and Italian bonds this week.”  Spanish 10-year yields fell 49 basis points, or 0.49
percentage point, over the week to 6.38 percent at 5:17 p.m. in
London yesterday, after reaching a euro-era high of 7.285
percent on June 18. That’s the biggest decline since the five
days through Jan. 27. The 5.85 percent security due January 2022
advanced 3.32, or 33.20 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,254) face
amount, to 96.24.  Portugal ’s 10-year yield fell 103 basis points to 9.49
percent, while similar-maturity Italian rates declined 13 basis
points to 5.80 percent.  ‘Virtuous Countries’  “We’re looking at the ways and means” to use the European
Stability Mechanism to bring down borrowing costs for “virtuous
countries,” Hollande told reporters after a summit of Group-
of-20 leaders in Los Cabos,  Mexico , on June 20. The  European
Central Bank  said yesterday it would relax some rules on the
collateral that banks can offer in exchange for central bank
loans.  German  10-year yields  jumped 14 basis points to 1.58
percent and climbed as high as 1.64 percent on June 20, the most
since May 3.  An index of executive and consumer sentiment in the 17-
nation euro area fell to 89.6 in June from 90.6 a month earlier,
according to the median estimate of 26 economists in a Bloomberg
survey before the European Commission report due for release on
June 28. That would be the lowest since October 2009. Italy
plans to sell five- and 10-year bonds the same day.  German debt returned 2.6 percent this year, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies as of June 21. Spanish securities
lost 5.1 percent, Portuguese bonds gained 27 percent and Italian
bonds rose 8.5 percent, the indexes showed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
