Kenyan Prime Minister  Raila Odinga 
said he agreed in a meeting with Russian President Vladimir
Putin to begin negotiations on direct flights between the two
countries.  The plan is to enable Kenya Airways Ltd. and Aeroflot to
start flying the route connecting Nairobi and Moscow, Odinga
said, according to a statement e-mailed from St. Petersburg.
Odinga is in the Russian city for a global economic forum.  “Kenya and Russia have agreed to initiate the process of
signing a bilateral air-traffic agreement,” the premier said in
the statement.  The flights would help establish stronger commercial ties
and spur trade in agricultural products, including the import of
fertilizer into Kenya and the export of fresh-cut flowers, as
well as boost tourism, Odinga said.  Executives from  OAO Lukoil (LKOH) , Russia’s second-largest oil
company, will send a delegation by the end of next month to
explore energy-industry opportunities in the East African
nation, Odinga said. London-based  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW)  announced
Kenya’s first oil discovery on March 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
