Premafin Finanziaria SpA (PF) , the
holding company controlling insurer Fondiaria-SAI, halted talks
with investment funds Sator Capital Ltd. and Palladio
Finanziaria SpA to rescue Fondiaria,  Il Sole 24 Ore  said.  Premafin’s board decided yesterday that there weren’t
“sufficient elements to go ahead with talks,” Il Sole reported
citing a board member it didn’t identify. Premafin will go ahead
with the alternative rescue plan proposed by  Unipol Gruppo
Finanziario SpA (UNI) , the daily said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
