Spain ’s Xabi Alonso scored twice to
help the defending champions defeat France 2-0 in their
quarterfinal at soccer’s European Championship.  Alonso, who is playing his 100th match for Spain, headed in
a cross from Jordi Alba in the 19th minute, and then added a
penalty kick in the 91st minute. Spain controlled almost 70
percent of play in the opening half, and had nearly 330
completed passes, double that of France, in tonight’s match at
Donbass Arena in Donetsk, Ukraine. By the 55th minute, France
had improved, now having 42 percent of the ball, according to
UEFA statistics.  Spain will play Portugal in the semifinal.  Spain manager Vicente del Bosque added midfielder Cesc
Fabregas to replace striker  Fernando Torres  from the squad that
beat Croatia 1-0 in their last group game, going without a
striker against France.  France started with attacking midfielder Sami Nasir on the
bench, replacing him with another defender in preparation for
the Spanish attacks.  France hadn’t lost in 23 matches before losing to  Sweden  in
their last group game, ending the second-longest stretch without
defeat in its history.  Spain won the last European Championship and the 2010  World
Cup . France is the last team to knock Spain out of a
international tournament, winning a quarterfinal at the 2006
World Cup.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
