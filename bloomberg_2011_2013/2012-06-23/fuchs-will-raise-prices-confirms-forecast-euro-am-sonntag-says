Fuchs Petrolub AG (FPE)  will raise prices
as the cost of raw materials increases,  Euro am Sonntag  cited
Chief Financial Officer Alexander Selent as saying in an
interview.  The maker of lubricants, based in Mannheim, Germany, is
well prepared for any possible dissolution of the euro area,
according to an e-mailed preview of the interview to be
published later today. Selent confirmed the companyâ€™s forecast
for 2012 sales, Euro am Sonntag said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
