Formula One Chief Executive Officer
 Bernie Ecclestone  is being investigated by U.K. tax authorities
on suspicion of  tax evasion , Germany’s  Focus  magazine reported,
without saying where it got the information.  U.K. authorities have asked Germany’s Finance Ministry for
help in the investigation, the magazine said. The backdrop to
the investigation is the bribery case involving a $44 million
payment to former Bayerische Landesbank Chief Risk Officer
Gerhard Gribkowsky, including the source of the bribery payment,
Focus said.  Paul Mathews, a spokesman for the London-based U.K. tax
office, declined to comment on the Focus report when contacted
by Bloomberg News today, citing the statutory confidentiality of
individual taxpayers.  Ecclestone could not be reached for comment today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
