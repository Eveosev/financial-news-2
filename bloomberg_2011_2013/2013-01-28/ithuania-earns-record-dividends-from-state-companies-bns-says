Lithuaniaâ€™s state-owned companies
paid the government a record 522 million litai ($203 million) in
dividends last year, six times more than in 2011, the Baltic
News Service reported, citing a draft Finance Ministry report.  Power utility Visagino Atomine Elektrine UAB paid 275
million litai of dividends from the profits of its  Litgrid AB (LGD1L) 
and  Lesto AB (LES1L)  subsidiaries, while railway operator Lietuvos
Gelezinkeliai AB paid 123 million litai, according to BNS.  The Klaipeda Port on the Baltic Sea made a 34 million litai
payment to the budget, its first ever, BNS said. The government
had targeted dividend revenue of 589 million litai in 2012,
according to the newswire.  To contact the reporter on this story:
