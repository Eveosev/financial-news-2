JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  paid about
$35.7 million for an interest in eight  Ormat Technologies Inc. (ORA) 
geothermal power plants in California and  Nevada .  JPMorgan plans to pay Ormat an additional $8.7 million for
25 percent of the value of production tax credits generated by
the plants through the end of 2016, the Reno, Nevada-based
developer said today in a statement.  The so-called tax equity investment gives JPMorgan
production tax credits and accelerated depreciation benefits
that Ormat isn’t able to use, because “we generate more
deductions for tax purposes than we are currently able to
utilize,” Ormat Chief Executive Officer Dita Bronicki said in
the statement. The production tax credit for geothermal is 2.2
cents a kilowatt-hour and applies to the first 10 years of a
plant’s operation.  The eight plants are part of Ormat’s Ormesa, Heber and
Mammoth complexes in  California  and its Steamboat and Brady
complexes in Nevada, Bronicki said today in an e-mail.  JPMorgan invested $24.9 million in four of Ormat’s Nevada
facilities in a similar transaction in February 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
