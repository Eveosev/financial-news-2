Lanxess AG (LXS) , the German chemical
maker whose pigments are used on the Eiffel Tower, plans to
invest 55 million euros ($74 million) in a factory in  China  to
add a new lighter tinge of red.  The factory, which will create 150 jobs, is being built at
the Ningbo Chemical Park on China’s east coast and will be
finished in the first quarter of 2015, Leverkusen-based Lanxess
said today.  Lanxess gets about 10 percent of its sales from China and
the country plays a “key role” in the German company’s growth
strategy, it said. The chemical maker already has a plant for
iron-ore pigments in Jinshan,  Shanghai , as well as factories in
 Germany  and Brazil.  “China is already the biggest market for iron-oxide
pigments in the world and is still growing fast,” Joerg Hellwig, head of the inorganic pigments unit, said in a phone
interview today.  The site in Ningbo will produce pigments that are more
yellowish-red in tint than those currently manufactured at
Lanxess’s biggest factory in Germany.  The Germany company has secured an extra plot of land at
the Chinese chemical park for potential expansion of production
although there are no concrete plans to build there at the
moment, Hellwig said.  Lanxess’s pigments are also used in water treatment and can
filter arsenic out of ground water, helping provide drinking
water in places like  Bangladesh , Hellwig said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
