Powerwave Technologies Inc., a maker
of antennas and amplifiers for wireless communications, filed
for bankruptcy protection after  losing  money in four of the past
five years.  The company, based in Santa Ana, California, listed debt of
$396 million and assets of $213 million in a Chapter 11 petition
filed today in Wilmington, Delaware. Chapter 11 is used by
companies that plan to stay in business while either
reorganizing or liquidating their assets.  The board found that bankruptcy is “in the best interest
of the company, its creditors and other parties,” Powerwave
said in the petition.  In February, Powerwave  announced  a restructuring plan
designed to cut manufacturing costs and conserve cash, in part
by firing about 60 workers. That was followed in September by
the announcement that 120 people would be fired and some offices
shut down.  The company makes equipment to boost signal strength for
wireless phone and data networks.  Powerwave fell as much as 82 percent after the filing. It
closed at 8 cents after falling 74 percent for the day in
trading in New York.  The case is  Powerwave Technologies Inc. (PWAV) , 13-10134, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporters on this story:
