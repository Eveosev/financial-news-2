Gome Electrical Appliances Holding
Ltd. (493) , China’s second-largest electronics retailer, said it
probably posted a loss last year after rents rose and slowing
economic growth in China damped consumer demand. The stock
dropped.  More investment in the company’s e-commerce business also
contributed to the loss, Beijing-based Gome said in a filing to
the Hong Kong Stock Exchange yesterday. The company said an
economic rebound in China is expected to create new market
opportunities.  The company reported a net loss of 686.7 million  yuan  ($110
million) for the first nine month of last year, compared with a
profit of 1.79 billion yuan a year earlier, on sales of 36.1
billion yuan, down from 44 billion yuan.  China ’s economy
expanded 7.8 percent in 2012, the least in 13 years. Growth is
expected accelerate to to 8.1 percent this year, according to
analysts polled by Bloomberg in December.  “Gome now has greater visibility of its future after a
difficult transition in 2012,” Chief Executive Officer Wang Junzhou said in a separate e-mailed statement.  The company shut nine stores in Beijing, or 15 percent of
its presence in the city, in the third quarter last year in an
effort to regain profitability, the 21st Century Business Herald
reported on Oct. 24. Gome also closed stores in Shanghai and
Guangzhou.  Gome fell as much as 5.3 percent to 90 Hong Kong cents
before trading at 91 Hong Kong cents at 9:48 a.m. today. Suning
Appliance Co. is China’s largest electronics retailer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
