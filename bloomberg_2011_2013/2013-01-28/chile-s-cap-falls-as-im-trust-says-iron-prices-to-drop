Cap SA (CAP) ,  Chile ’s largest iron-ore
miner, fell after the brokerage firm IM Trust SA cut its rating
on the stock and said average prices for the metal this year may
be 20 percent lower than estimated in March.  Shares dropped 0.6 percent to 17,390 pesos at 3:31 p.m. in
Santiago trading. The  stock  slid 1.4 percent last week, the
biggest decline since Dec. 7. Cap reached a four-month closing
high of 17,885 pesos on Jan. 10.  “Price estimates for the medium term have fallen and thus
we should not expect Cap’s stock price to reach new highs unless
expectations start to improve,” Jose Manuel Edwards, an IM
Trust analyst, wrote today in a report.  The company may also face higher energy costs after the
termination of an energy contract due in 2015 with Santiago-
based  Empresa Nacional de Electricidad SA , known as Endesa, he
wrote.  He cut his rating on Santiago-based Cap to the equivalent
of sell from hold. Iron-ore prices may average $123 a ton this
year, 20 percent lower than when IM Trust published its last
revision in March, according to the report. Prices in 2014 may
average $118 a ton, 13 percent below the prior estimate, he
wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
