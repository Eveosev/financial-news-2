Japanese stock futures fell as the
yen strengthened against the dollar for a second day, curbing
the earnings outlook for companies that make sales overseas.  American Depositary Receipts of Nissan Motor Co., which
gets about 80 percent of its sales abroad, lost 0.7 percent.
Shares of KDDI Corp. may be active as Japan’s second-biggest
mobile-phone company raised its profit forecast and announced a
2-for-1 stock split.  Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in
March closed at 10,775 in  Chicago  yesterday, down from 10,810 at
the close in  Osaka , Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at
10,770 in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time.  Australia ’s  S&P/ASX 200
Index (AS51)  rose 0.2 percent, poised for its longest streak of gains
since December 2004 and New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index fell less
than 0.1 percent.  “Given the bull run stocks have enjoyed on the back of
government-policy expectations, and the fact that investors are
largely skewed towards long positions, we consider the market
correction as no more than an adjustment of positions,” said
Shun Maruyama, chief Japan equity strategist at BNP Paribas SA
in  Tokyo . We’re “expecting a more sustainable rally after the
market consolidates,” he said.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average has climbed 25 percent since
elections were announced on Nov. 14 through Jan. 25 on optimism
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s new government will take the
necessary steps to fight deflation.  Japan ’s currency advanced from its weakest level versus the
dollar since 2010 as technical indicators signaled it may have
dropped too much. The yen climbed 0.2 percent to 90.70 per
dollar as of 7:45 a.m. in Tokyo.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index, the benchmark regional
equities gauge, traded at 14.3 times average estimated earnings
compared with 13.6 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 12.3
times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Futures on the S&P 500 Index fell 0.1 percent today. The
gauge yesterday dropped as a decline in pending home sales
overshadowed a gain in durable-goods orders, while investors
watched company earnings reports. About 6.1 billion shares
traded hands on U.S. exchanges yesterday, or 1.1 percent below
the three-month average.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. rose 0.1 percent to 99.72 in New York
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
