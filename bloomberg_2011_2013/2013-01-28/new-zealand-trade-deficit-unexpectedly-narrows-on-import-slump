New Zealand ’s annual trade deficit
unexpectedly narrowed in December as imports fell to an eight-
month low while dairy exports increased to the highest since
January last year.  Imports exceeded exports by NZ$1.21 billion ($1 billion)  in
2012 , compared with a revised NZ$1.39 billion shortfall in the
year through November,  Statistics New Zealand  said today in
Wellington. Economists expected a NZ$1.87 billion gap, according
to the median of seven forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey.  Exports fell 3.5 percent last year from 2011 as slowing
global demand curbed commodity prices and the New Zealand
dollar’s 6.6 percent gain cut returns. Policy makers are betting
that a recovery in key markets of Australia and  China , which
together take more than a third of the nation’s exports, will
help accelerate New Zealand’s economic recovery this year.  “Chinese GDP growth and iron ore demand have recovered
recently,”  Jane Turner , economist at ASB Bank Ltd. in Auckland,
said in a research note before today’s report.  The local currency was little changed after the report,
buying 83.37 U.S. cents at 10:48 a.m. in Wellington.  Prices for the nation’s commodity exports fell 5.2 percent
in December from a year earlier, according to an index from ANZ
Bank New Zealand Ltd. Still, the annual decline is narrowing
amid a 7 percent recovery in prices from the 28-month low
reached in July.  Exports to China rose 17 percent in 2012 from 2011. They
make up 15 percent of total overseas sales.  Aircraft Purchase  In December, imports fell 10 percent from the year-earlier
month to NZ$3.58 billion, the lowest since April, today’s report
showed. Economists predicted NZ$4.13 billion. A slump in
petroleum imports and the purchase of a large aircraft in the
year-earlier month contributed most of the decline.  Exports in December fell 5.1 percent from a year earlier to
NZ$4.07 billion. Economists predicted NZ$3.98 billion.  Overseas sales of milk powder, butter and cheese, which
make up about a quarter of total exports, fell 5.3 percent from
December 2011. Still, the monthly value of NZ$1.28 billion was
the highest since January 2011 as seasonal milk production
increases.  The slump in imports meant New Zealand had a monthly trade
surplus of NZ$486 million compared with NZ$300 million in
December 2011. Economists predicted a NZ$105 million deficit.
The November monthly deficit was revised to NZ$590 million from
NZ$700 million previously reported, led by a decline in the
value of imports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
