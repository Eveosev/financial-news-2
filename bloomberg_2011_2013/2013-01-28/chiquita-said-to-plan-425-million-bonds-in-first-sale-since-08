Chiquita Brands International Inc. (CQB) ,
a U.S. packaged-foods company, is planning to issue $425 million
of bonds with its first offering in about five years.  The owner of the namesake banana label may sell eight-year
notes, non-callable for three years, with pricing expected on
Jan. 30, according to a person familiar with the transaction.
Proceeds will be used to repay the Cincinnati-based company’s
credit facility and its $106.4 million of 7.5 percent notes due
2014, Chiquita said today in a filing.  The company last sold debt in February 2008, issuing $200
million of 4.25 percent, 8.5-year convertible debt, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Chiquita’s 7.5 percent securities
due 2014 traded at 100.4 cents on the dollar to yield 7.26
percent on Jan. 22, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting
system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Bank of America Corp.,  Wells Fargo & Co ., Goldman Sachs
Group Inc., and Barclays Plc are managing the new sale, said the
person, who asked not to be identified because terms aren’t set.  The company is also entering into a $200 million asset-
based revolving credit facility to help fund the debt repayment,
the filing said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
