Mitsubishi Chemical  Holdings Corp.,
 Japan ’s largest producer of the products, said it’s in talks to
supply coke to India’s  Tata Steel Ltd. (TATA)  after the loss of one of
its biggest customers.  Mitsubishi Chemical is seeking to secure customers abroad
and in Japan to make up for cuts in shipments to  Nippon Steel &
Sumitomo Metal Corp. (5401) ’s Kokura mill in southern Japan, said Kenta
Horie, a spokesman for Mitsubishi Chemical, who confirmed talks
with Tata Steel. The Japanese steelmaker, formed from the
October merger of Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd. and Nippon
Steel Corp., can source coke internally.  The chemical company imports coal from countries such as
 Australia  and processes it into coke to sell to steelmakers.
Sales from carbon products, including coke and carbon fiber, are
forecast to fall 15 percent to 230 billion yen ($2.5 billion) in
the year ending March 31, according to a Nov. 1 statement.  The Nikkei newspaper reported the talks with Tata Steel
earlier today, without saying where it obtained the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
