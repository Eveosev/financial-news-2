Steel reinforcement-bar futures
dropped from the highest level in more than six months on
concern that inventories are piling up in  China  as demand
remains weak before the Lunar New Year holiday.  Rebar for delivery in May fell as much as 0.5 percent to
4,056 yuan ($652) a metric ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange,
before trading at 4,063 at 11:09 a.m. local time. The most-
active contract reached 4,085 yuan on Jan. 25, the highest price
since July 6.  Rebar steel inventory  in China gained for a fifth week to
6.26 million tons, according to the Shanghai Steelhome
Information. The Chinese markets will be closed for the week-
long New Year break, which commences Feb. 9 this year.  “Despite signs of improving macro economy, the demand in
the  spot market  is conspicuously missing approaching the Lunar
New Year,” Ren Xinlei, an analyst at Luzheng Futures Co., said
in a report. “Inventory will rise again after the holiday.”  Spot  iron ore  at Tianjin port was unchanged at $148.60 a
dry ton on Jan. 25, according to The Steel Index Ltd. The
average spot  price  for rebar was at 3,729  yuan  a ton on the same
day, according to data from Beijing Antaike Information
Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
