GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK)  agreed to form a
joint venture in  India  to produce a six-in-one vaccine that will
immunize children in  developing countries  against infectious
diseases including polio.  The London-based drugmaker has agreed to form a 50-50
venture with India’s Biological E Ltd. to develop a product that
would combine Glaxo’s injectable polio shot with a vaccine
produced by Biological E that protects against five diseases
including diphtheria and tetanus, the companies said in an e-
mailed statement today.  Boosting vaccine production in India will help Glaxo gain
market share as smaller Indian rivals like billionaire Cyrus
Poonawalla’s Serum Institute of India Ltd. make inroads by
selling low-priced shots for developing countries. Poonawalla
said this month he is being urged to offer the injectable polio
vaccine at a third to a quarter of its current price.  Glaxo and Paris-based  Sanofi (SAN)  are the largest suppliers of
injectable polio vaccine, which is used in most developed
countries to protect children against crippling poliomyelitis.  Sanofi Pasteur, the vaccine-making unit of France’s largest
drugmaker, already has an Indian vaccine unit, Hyderabad-based
Shantha Biotechnics Pvt.  Shantha’s Shan6 inoculation will be an “affordable
answer” to six diseases including polio, said Olivier Charmeil,
president and chief executive officer of Sanofi Pasteur, said
