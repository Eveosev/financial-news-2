Jeremy Norris,  Barclays Plc (BARC) ’s head
of equity sales trading in Asia, will  leave  the bank later this
year, two people with knowledge of the matter said.  Norris, based in Hong Kong, will leave after a transition
period, the people said, asking not to be identified as the
information is private. He is retiring from the industry and his
pending departure isn’t part of recent job cuts at Barclays in
the region, they said.  Norris declined to comment on his plans, referring the call
to spokesmen for the London-based bank. Timothy Cuffe, a Hong
Kong-based spokesman for the bank also declined to comment.  Norris joined Barclays in April 2010, according to a
 statement  at the time. He was previously with CLSA Asia-Pacific
Markets in Hong Kong as global head of equities trading,
according to the statement.  Barclays is eliminating about 70  jobs , or 15 percent of its
investment banking positions in Asia, people with knowledge of
the matter said last week. The bank follows rivals including
Morgan Stanley in trimming jobs in the region as an economic
slowdown pares demand from companies for  investment banking 
services.  To contact the reporters on this story:
