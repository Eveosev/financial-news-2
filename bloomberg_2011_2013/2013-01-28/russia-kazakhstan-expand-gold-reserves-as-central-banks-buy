Russia and Kazakhstan expanded their
gold holdings in December, seeking to diversify their reserves
as the metal capped a 12th annual advance and investors raised
holdings to an all-time high.  Russian holdings climbed 2.1 percent to 957.8 metric tons
in December, taking the increase over 2012 to 8.5 percent,
according to data on the International Monetary Fund’s website.
Kazakhstan’s hoard expanded 1.7 percent to 115.3 tons last
month, and surged 41 percent over the year, the data showed.  Bullion has rallied as investors sought a haven from weaker
currencies and potential inflation, with governments from the
U.S. to  Europe  and  Japan  ramping up stimulus to promote faster
growth. Gold holdings in  exchange-traded products  reached a
record last month. Prices will rally this year and into 2014 on
central banks’ stimulus measures, according to Morgan Stanley.  Central banks need to “diversify into gold as the euro
zone is not yet out of the woods,” said Lynette Tan, a senior
investment analyst at Phillip Futures Pte. in Singapore. “This
will provide long-term support for gold prices.”  Gold for immediate delivery fell 0.1 percent to $1,657.57
an ounce at 1:26 p.m. in  London . The price increased 7.1 percent
last year, the smallest annual gain since 2008. The precious
metal reached a record $1,921.15 in September 2011 as Europe’s
debt crisis stoked speculation that the euro zone may fragment.  No Target  While the Russian central bank will continue buying gold,
the pace of the purchases may vary, First Deputy Chairman  Alexei Ulyukayev  told reporters this month. There’s no 10 percent
target for gold’s share in the reserves, Ulyukayev said.  Turkey ’s holdings jumped 14.5 percent to 359.65 tons last
month, according to the IMF data. The amount has increased due
to it accepting gold in its reserve requirements from commercial
banks. The Philippines’ gold reserves fell 1 percent in November
from October, the figures showed.  Countries bought 373.9 tons in the first nine months of
last year, according to the producer-funded World Gold Council,
which said in November that full-year additions for 2012 would
probably be at the “bottom end” of a range from 450 to 500
tons. Central banks purchased 456 tons in 2011.  Investor holdings in gold-backed ETPs rose 0.4 percent last
month, reaching a record 2,632.5 tons on Dec. 20, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. This month, they’ve contracted 0.8
percent as spot gold fell 1.1 percent.  Gold will rally this year and into 2014 as U.S. Federal
Reserve policy makers maintain asset purchases for two more
years to buttress the recovery of the world’s largest economy,
Morgan Stanley said in a report on Jan. 24. Prices will be
supported by investment and central-bank buying, analysts Peter Richardson and Joel Crane wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
