Corn rose on speculation that dry
weather may damage crops in  Argentina , while too much rain slows
planting in Brazil, increasing demand for U.S. supplies.
Soybeans were little changed.  Most corn fields in Argentina have received less than half
the average rainfall in the past 40 days, and hot, dry weather
during the next five days will increase stress on developing
crops, T-Storm Weather LLC said in a report today. As much as 6
inches (15 centimeters) of rain in the next 10 days will slow
crop sowing in central Brazil, the private forecaster said.  “Argentina weather is a growing concern and helped to
bring in some new buying,” Jeff Beal, a market analyst for
Rockford, Illinois-based Gulke Group Inc., said in a telephone
interview. “Rain-delayed planting in  Brazil  could help to
revive sluggish U.S. exports.”  Corn futures for March delivery rose 0.5 percent to $7.245
a bushel at 10:54 a.m. on the  Chicago  Board of Trade. Though
Jan. 25, the price gained 3.2 percent this month after the
government said that U.S. inventories as of Dec. 1 fell to the
lowest in nine years.  Soybean futures for March delivery dropped less than 0.1
percent to $14.405 a bushel in Chicago.  U.S. supplies inspected for export fell 17 percent to
40.667 million bushels in the week ended Jan. 24 from a week
earlier, the Department of Agriculture said today.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $76.5 billion in
2011, followed by soybeans at $35.8 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
