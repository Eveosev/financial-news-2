U.K. utilities are being encouraged
to pipe more water to drought-prone parts of the country such as
the southeast according to proposals outlined today by the
regulator Ofwat, the Telegraph reported.  Less than 5 percent of the U.K.’s water is currently traded
between water companies in different parts of the country, a
figure that’s almost unchanged since privatization in 1989, the
newspaper said.  Ofwat said it wanted to introduce more incentives for
companies to transfer water from areas where it is plentiful
such as the north to where it is scarcer like the southeast,
where drought led to hosepipe bans last year, the paper said.  Changing weather is making it more difficult to manage
water supplies, the regulator said, according to the Telegraph.
Four of the U.K.’s five wettest years on record have occurred
since 2000, with last year the wettest in  England  since
records began in 1910. Yet parts of England also suffered from
drought last year, hurt by driest 18 months in a century, the
paper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
