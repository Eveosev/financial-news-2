Hana Financial Group Inc. (086790) , South
 Korea ’s third-biggest financial services group by assets, rose
the most in almost four weeks in  Seoul  after announcing a plan
to make  Korea Exchange Bank (004940)  a fully owned unit.  Hana advanced as much as 5.9 percent, the biggest intraday
gain since Jan. 2, and traded at 40,850 won as of 11:05 a.m. in
Seoul. Korea Exchange Bank gained 5.2 percent to 7,710 won,
compared with the benchmark Kospi index’s 0.4 percent decline.  Korea Exchange Bank shareholders will be offered 0.1894 of
a Hana share for each share of KEB they own as Seoul-based Hana
seeks to delist the unit, the companies said in regulatory
filings. The move follows Hana’s 4.4 trillion won ($4 billion)
acquisition of more than half of KEB last year to help it
compete with bigger rivals amid an economic slowdown.  “The plan would bolster Hana’s capital and will improve
long-term efficiency and earnings,” Michael Na, a Seoul-based
analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc., said by phone. “Investors seem
to be betting on Hana’s long-term growth outlook with the plan.
KEB shareholders can also seek arbitrage profit from the
designated stock-swap ratio at the current price level.”  Hana owns 60 percent of KEB after buying stakes from
Dallas-based Lone Star Funds and Export-Import Bank of Korea.
The share-swap offer is pending approval at a  shareholders’
meeting  to be held in March, according to the filings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
