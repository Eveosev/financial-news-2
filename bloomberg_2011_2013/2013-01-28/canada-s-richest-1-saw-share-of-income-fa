Canada’s last recession dented the
fortunes of the country’s richest 1 percent, while the gap
between that group and the rest of the country widened over the
last two decades, government tax data show.  The incomes of the top 1 percent of taxpayers equaled 10.6
percent of the national total in 2010, after growing from 7
percent in the early 1980s to a peak of 12.1 percent in 2006,
Statistics Canada  said  today from Ottawa.  The median income for the richest of Canada’s 25.5 million
taxpayers was C$283,400 ($281,000) in 2010, about 10 times
greater than the C$28,400 median of the remaining 99 percent,
according to the report. The income disparity has widened from
1982 when the top 1 percent’s median income of C$191,600 was
about seven times larger than the rest.  Canada’s economy experienced a  recession  from the fourth
quarter of 2008 through the second quarter of 2009, the first
such contraction since 1990-91.  The proportion of women among top 1 percent in 2010 grew to
21 percent, almost double the 11 percent share reported in 1982,
Statistics Canada said.  The share of federal and provincial taxes paid by the
richest Canadians has also grown, to 21.2 percent in 2010 from
13.4 percent in 1982.  To contact the reporter on this story:
