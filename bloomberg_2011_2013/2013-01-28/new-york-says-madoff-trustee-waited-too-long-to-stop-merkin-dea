New York  Attorney GeneralEric Schneiderman told a federal judge that the Bernard Madoff
brokerage trustee’s three-year delay in trying to stop a $410
million settlement with a Ponzi scheme investor is contrary to
the legal principle that plaintiffs must be vigilant and not
wait an “unreasonable” time while efforts are expended by
other parties with claims against the alleged offender.  “For over three years, the NYAG expended significant
resources in pursuing and resolving the action against Merkin,”
Schneiderman said in a Jan. 25 filing in federal court in
 Manhattan , referring to the former Madoff investor J. Ezra Merkin. “A total of ten NYAG attorneys completed the initial
precomplaint investigation, leading to the filing of the
complaint in April 2009. Seven NYAG attorneys invested
significant portions of their time over three years in pursuing
the action from filing to settlement. Hundreds of Merkin
investors were contacted and interviewed during the initial
investigation.”  U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan last month
pulled the case out of  bankruptcy court , where it was started by
trustee  Irving Picard , saying it requires a ruling by a higher
court.  Schneiderman had agreed to settle a state lawsuit
against Merkin by allotting most of the settlement money to
investors in Merkin’s hedge funds and the rest to the state.
Picard responded by suing Schneiderman in bankruptcy court to
stop the deal, saying it obstructs his own efforts to collect
$500 million from Merkin and his funds for a different group of
investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
