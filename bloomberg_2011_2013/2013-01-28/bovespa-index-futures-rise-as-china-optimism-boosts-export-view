Bovespa-index futures gained after
an increase in Chinese industrial companies’ profits boosted
optimism about the economic outlook for  Brazil ’s top trading
partner.  Banco Bradesco SA, Brazil’s second-biggest bank by market
value, may be active after reporting fourth-quarter profit that
trailed analysts’ estimates. Shopping-mall owner BR Malls
Participacoes SA may move after Credit Suisse Group AG lowered
its recommendation to the equivalent of hold.  Bovespa-index  futures  climbed 0.4 percent to 61,420 at 9:08
a.m. in Sao Paulo. The real strengthened 0.1 percent to 2.0271
per dollar. Chinese stocks rose after the National Bureau of
Statistics said profits of industrial companies increased 17.3
percent in December. Earnings for the full year gained 5.3
percent.  Bradesco said today in a statement that adjusted net
income, which excludes one-time items, climbed to 2.92 billion
reais ($1.44 billion) from 2.77 billion reais a year earlier.
That compares with the 2.96 billion-real median estimate of
eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Brazil’s gross domestic product will expand 3.10 percent
this year, according to the median forecast in a Jan. 25 central
bank survey of about 100 economists published today. They had
forecast expansion of 3.19 percent a week earlier.  Bull Market  The  Bovespa (IBOV)  entered a  bull market  on Jan. 3 after rising 21
percent from last year’s low on June 5 as stimulus from central
banks around the world eased concern economic growth might miss
expectations while borrowing costs at a record low in Brazil
boosted equity demand. The index has since pared its advance to
17 percent.  Brazil’s benchmark equity gauge trades at 11.3 times
analysts’ earnings estimates for the next four quarters,
compared with 10.9 for MSCI’s measure of 21 developing nations’
equities, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Trading volume of stocks in Sao Paulo was 7.14 billion
reais on Jan. 24, which compares with a daily average of 7.25
billion reais in 2012, according to data compiled by the
 exchange . The  Sao Paulo  exchange was closed on Jan. 25 due to a
local holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
