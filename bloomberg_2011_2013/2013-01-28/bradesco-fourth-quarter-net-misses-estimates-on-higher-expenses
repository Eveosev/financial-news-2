Banco Bradesco SA (BBDC4) ,  Latin America ’s
second-largest lender by market value, said profit rose 5.4
percent, missing analysts’ estimates as costs increased for
wages and advertising.  Fourth-quarter adjusted net income, which excludes one-time
items, climbed to 2.92 billion reais ($1.44 billion) from 2.77
billion reais a year earlier, the Osasco, Brazil-based bank said
today in a statement. That compares with the 2.96 billion-real
 median estimate  of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Bradesco, led by Chief Executive Officer Luiz Carlos Trabuco Cappi, said personnel expenses jumped as workers in
 Brazil  received a 7.5 percent annual pay increase in September
as part of their collective-bargaining agreement. Consumer
prices rose 5.3 percent in the South American nation in the 12
months through September. The bank also said its advertising
spending boosted administrative expenses, while it increased
operating provisions on “tax and civil contingencies.”  “Our challenge is to gain productivity and efficiency to
reduce costs,” Cappi, 61, said on a conference call with
journalists after the results were released.  The bank  fell  3.1 percent to 36.59 reais in Sao Paulo at
5:40 p.m., the biggest decline in more than month. It compared
with a fall of 2.6 percent for  Itau Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB4) , Latin
America’s biggest lender by market value. The benchmark Bovespa
index dropped 1.9 percent.  Personnel Costs  Structural personnel expenses such as payroll rose 6.3
percent to 2.57 billion reais from a year earlier, according to
the statement. Administrative costs including advertising
increased 5.6 percent to 3.76 billion reais. The bank boosted
operating provisions by 40 percent to 1.13 billion reais.  Bradesco set aside 3.2 billion reais to cover bad loans in
the fourth quarter, down from 3.3 billion reais in the previous
three months and up from 2.66 billion reais a year earlier,
according to the statement. Defaults reached 4.1 percent in the
last three months of 2012, the same as in the third quarter and
up from 3.9 percent a year earlier.  “Despite our view that the credit cycle is improving, we
believe that the pace has been somewhat slower than we
anticipated,” Eduardo Nishio and Felipe Salomao, analysts at
brokerage Brasil Plural SA in  Sao Paulo , wrote in a report to
clients today.  Bradesco’s portfolio of loans expanded 12 percent to 385.5
billion reais from a year earlier, below the bank’s 14 percent
to 18 percent credit-growth guidance for 2012. Total assets
reached 879.1 billion reais, an expansion of 15 percent from
2011. Bradesco expects its loan-book expansion to accelerate 13
percent to 17 percent this year, according to the statement.  Target Midpoint  Cappi said there are several signs indicating the bank’s
portfolio of loans will expand 15 percent this year, at the
midpoint of the target.  “2013 is the year of Brazilian economy recovery,” he
said.  The net interest margin was 7.6 percent in the fourth
quarter, compared with 7.8 percent in the same period of 2011
and unchanged from the previous three months, according to the
statement. The indicator is a measure of profitability
represented by the gap between what banks pay depositors and
what they earn on loans.  Bradesco expects operating expenses to grow 4 percent to 8
percent this year, while fee and commission income will climb 9
percent to 13 percent in the same period, according to the
statement. The bank sees its interest income expanding 7 percent
to 11 percent in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
