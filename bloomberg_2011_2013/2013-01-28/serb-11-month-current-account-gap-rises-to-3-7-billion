Serbiaâ€™s current-account deficit
widened 14.7 percent in the first 11 months of 2012 from a year
earlier after the shortfall in November was the smallest monthly
gap since the start of the year.  The deficit widened to 2.747 billion ($3.69 billion)
through November, with the trade gap expanding 4 percent and
remittances dropping 5.8 percent on the year. Net foreign direct
investments turned positive to reach an 11-month total of 136.9
million euros, down from 1.617 billion euros in the same period
last year, according to the balance of payments report published
by the Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije today.  The central bank sees the full-year current-account gap at
3.1 billion euros, or 10.7 percent of gross domestic product.  To contact the reporter on this story:
