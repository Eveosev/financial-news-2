Laep Investments Ltd. (MILK11) , a Hamilton,
Bermuda-based private equity fund that invests in companies in
 Brazil , said it is selling shares because it needs an “urgent
capital injection” to pay creditors and suppliers.  Laep plans to raise $10.2 million by issuing 40.1 million
new class A shares at 25 cents apiece in the Luxembourg stock
exchange, the company said in a regulatory filing yesterday.
Laep also trades Brazilian depositary receipts, or BDRs, in  Sao
Paulo .  The share sale will “raise capital in the face of the
financial situation of the company, which needs an urgent
capital injection,” Laep said in the statement. Proceeds will
be used to pay creditors and suppliers, the company said.  Laep indirectly owns a 24.3 percent stake in dairy maker
LBR-Lacteos Brasil SA, which holds the rights to the Parmalat
brand in Brazil. The private equity fund also controls Daslu,
once Brazil’s biggest luxury department store, which filed for
 bankruptcy protection  in 2010 amid tax-evasion charges.  Laep BDRs slid 2.1 percent to 46 centavos at 10:18 a.m. in
Sao Paulo today, after earlier dropping as much as 4.3 percent.
The stock has plunged 88 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
