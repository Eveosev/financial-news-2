Treasury benchmark 10-year yields
rose to 2 percent for the first time since April as signs of
improvement in the global economy cut demand for the relative
safety of U.S. debt.  Treasuries have handed investors a 0.9 percent loss in
January, the worst monthly performance since March, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The  MSCI All-Country
World Index (MXWD)  of shares gained 5.4 percent in January including
reinvested dividends, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Benchmark 10-year  yields  fell to 1.99 percent as of 8:49
a.m. in New York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The
price of the 1.625 percent security due in November 2022 fell
12/32 to 96 23/32. The rate is still less than the average over
the past decade of 3.64 percent.  Yields climbed last week when the European Central Bank
said lender will repay more of its loans than forecast, spurring
optimism the worst of the region’s debt crisis is over.  The ECB said lenders will pay back 137.2 billion euros
($184.7 billion) of its three-year loans, so-called Longer-Term
Refinancing Operations, this week. The figure compares with the
median forecast of 84 billion euros in a Bloomberg survey of
economists.  In the U.S., employers probably added 160,000 workers in
January, after a 155,000 increase in December, based on
Bloomberg News survey of economists before the Labor Department
reports the figures on Feb. 1.  Central Banks  Federal Reserve policy makers said they may end their $85
billion monthly bond purchases sometime in 2013, with members
divided between a mid- or end-of-year finish, according to the
record of the Federal Open Market Committee’s Dec. 11-12
gathering.  Central banks in the U.S., the U.K. and Japan are all
buying bonds to pump money into their economies as they try to
spur growth. The European Central Bank has indicated it is
willing to do so.  “It should be possible to withdraw the additional credit
as the economy gets going,” billionaire investor George Soros
said in a Bloomberg News interview Jan. 26 at the World Economic
Forum annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland. “But it hasn’t been
done yet, and therefore there’s a fear that this could result in
runaway inflation.”  The  difference  between yields on U.S. 10-year notes and
same-maturity Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge
of trader expectations for consumer prices over the life of the
debt, widened to 2.56 percentage points last week. The average
over the past decade is 2.19 percentage points.  To contact the reporters on this story:
