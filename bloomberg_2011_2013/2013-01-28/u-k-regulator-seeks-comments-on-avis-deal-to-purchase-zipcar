Britain’s antitrust regulator is
seeking public comment on  Avis Budget Group Inc. (CAR) ’s takeover
offer for  Zipcar Inc. (ZIP)  to determine whether the proposed deal
could lessen competition in the U.K. market.  The Office of Fair Trading will accept comments until Feb.
11 on the $491 million offer, the watchdog said today in a
statement. Avis Budget’s Jan. 2 bid amounts to $12.25 a share, a
49 percent premium on the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based
company’s Dec. 31 closing price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
