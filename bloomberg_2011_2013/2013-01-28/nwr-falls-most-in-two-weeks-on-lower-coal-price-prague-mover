New World Resources Plc (NWR)  tumbled the
most in more than two weeks after the Czech mining company said
its thermal-coal price for this year fell.  The stock dropped 3.4 percent to 87.40 koruna by 10:43 a.m.
in Prague, the steepest decline since Jan. 15 and the worst
performance today in the  PX (PX)  equity index. NWR has fallen 10
percent in January, adding to a 28 percent retreat last year.  While customers agreed to buy coking coal for an average
103 euros a metric ton in the first quarter, up 3 percent from
the last three months of 2012, the price of thermal coal for
delivery this year fell 19 percent to 60 euros a ton, Amsterdam-
registered NWR said in a regulatory statement today.  “The announcement is pretty weak, especially due to the
fall in thermal-coal prices,” Petr Bartek, a stock analyst at
Ceska Sporitelna AS in  Prague , wrote in an e-mail to clients
today. NWR stock “looks a bit expensive compared to its weak
outlook for 2013.”  Bartek has a hold recommendation for NWR with a 94 koruna
price estimate, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
