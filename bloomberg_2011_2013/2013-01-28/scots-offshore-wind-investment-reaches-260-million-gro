Offshore-wind developers boosted
their investment in  Scotland  last year as projects with the
potential to power 3 million homes await approval, according to
the industry body Scottish Renewables.  The companies spent 65 million pounds in 2012, bringing the
total of their investments on the Scottish offshore-wind
industry to 164.5 million pounds ($260 million), most of it over
the past four years, the Glasgow-based group said. Last year’s
spending represents contracts for projects now in the planning
system that would provide 4 gigawatts of capacity, Scottish
Renewables said.  Most of the investment has been in research, including
environmental and technical-engineering surveys and project
demonstration, said Lindsay Leask, senior policy manager for
offshore renewables at the industry group. No projects have been
given consent yet and developing them in deep Scottish waters of
the  North Sea  is more difficult than in shallower waters around
the English and Welsh coasts, she said.  “This level of investment, made in advance of their
projects gaining consents, shows the considerable level of
confidence developers have in Scotland’s offshore wind sector,”
Leask said in the statement. “Once consents for projects are
granted, this will both motivate new entrants and strengthen
those existing companies who are already reaping the benefit of
diversifying into this emerging sector.”  Offshore wind may support as many as 28,000 direct jobs by
2020, Scotland’s First Minister  Alex Salmond  said in October.
Scotland aims to meet half its electricity needs from renewable
sources by 2015, he said at the time.  To contact the reporter for this story:
