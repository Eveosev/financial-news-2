Traders are expecting the euro to
extend its rally against the dollar, according to Lloyds Banking
Group Plc, citing derivatives measuring the difference between
implied volatility on calls and puts.  One-month 25-delta risk reversals, a gauge demand for calls
relative to puts, reached to 0.1, the highest since 2009,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The 17-nation common
currency has strengthened 1.9 percent this month, poised for a
sixth-straight gain, the longest stretch since 2003.  “Having spent a year looking at the euro downside, there’s
reason to say that now, they’re looking toward the euro
upside,” Adrian Schmidt, a foreign-exchange strategist at
Lloyds in  London , said by telephone. “It’s returned to a much
more normal market and almost suggests that there isn’t any risk
premium left in the euro.”  The 17-nation currency fell 0.1 percent to $1.3457 at 11:03
a.m. in  New York , after reaching the strongest level in almost
11 months on Jan. 25.  Traders increased bets the euro will gain against the
dollar, known as net longs, to 21,381 on Jan. 22, the most since
July 2011, from 7,315 the week before, Washington-based
