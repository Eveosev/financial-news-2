The Philippine peso declined for a
fourth day, the longest stretch of losses this year, on concern
the central bank will curb appreciation to support exports and
shore up the value of remittances from overseas workers.  The currency touched a two-week low of 40.760 per dollar
today as Governor Amando Tetangco said last week the monetary
authority will participate in the foreign-exchange market to
smooth sharp movements in the peso. Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas
reduced the interest paid on almost 1.7 trillion pesos ($42
billion) in its special-deposit accounts to 3 percent on Jan. 24
and Credit Suisse Group AG said the cut will help curb  currency
speculation  and spur lending.  “For the moment, the peso is just range-bound,” said
Rafael Algarra, executive vice president at  Security Bank Corp. (SECB) 
in  Manila . “We’ve seen how the central bank has actually curbed
the excess strength. Prospects for the  Philippines  continue to
be good and we should probably see more inflows.”  The peso fell 0.1 percent to 40.695 per dollar as of 11:06
a.m. in Manila, according to Tullett Prebon Plc. The currency
reached 40.550 on Jan. 14, the strongest level since March 2008.  The peso has advanced 5 percent in the past year, the best-
performance among Asia’s 11 most-active currencies, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The economy probably expanded 6.3 percent in the three
months through December from a year earlier, after an increase
of 7.1 percent in the prior quarter, according to the median
 estimate  of economists in a Bloomberg News survey before a
government report due Jan. 31.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, rose 10 basis
points, or 0.10 percentage point, to 4.1 percent today.  The yield on the government’s 8.125 percent notes due
December 2035 held at 5.4 percent, according to prices from
Tradition Financial Services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
