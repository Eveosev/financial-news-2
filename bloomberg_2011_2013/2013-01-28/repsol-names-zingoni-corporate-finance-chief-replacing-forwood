Repsol SA (REP)  named Maria Victoria Zingoni as its new corporate financial director, as Spain’s
largest oil producer lowers its borrowing costs to keep its
investment-grade debt rating.  Zingoni, Repsol’s director of  investor relations  since
2008, will take the job that supervises financial planning and
structuring, as well as risk management, according to a company
official who declined to be identified commenting on personnel
matters. Zingoni will replace Walter Forwood who is leaving the
company, and she will continue to report to Miguel Martinez,
Repsol’s chief financial officer. Her start date in the new job
is today.  Repsol, rated one level above junk and under a negative
outlook by Moody’s Investors Service, has a program to sell 4.5
billion euros ($6.1 billion) of assets by 2016 and pay down debt
after  Argentina  seized its YPF business in April without
compensation.  To contact the reporters on this story:
