The U.S. Open golf tournament will
be played at Winged Foot Golf Club in 2020, the sixth time the
Mamaroneck, New York, course will host the sport’s second-oldest
major.  The U.S. Golf Association, the sport’s governing body in
the U.S. and  Mexico , and club officials had been in discussions
for 18 months about bringing the tournament back. In 2008,
Winged Foot turned down an invitation to host the 2015 edition.  The 90-year-old private club previously hosted the U.S.
Open in 1929, 1959, 1974, 1984 and 2006, when Australia’s Geoff Ogilvy won as  Phil Mickelson  surrendered a one-shot lead with a
double-bogey on the final hole. That year was the first time the
club had hosted the Open in 22 years.  “Winged Foot is one of the quintessential U.S. Open
sites,” Tom O’Toole, chairman of the USGA’s championship
committee, said in a telephone interview. “It really is one of
those golf courses that is a fabulous test of golf, and that
trumps everything else.”  After Ogilvy’s victory seven years ago, the USGA had
intended to return to Winged Foot and was in the midst of
negotiations when the club’s membership declined. The 2015 event
will be played at Chambers Bay in University Place,  Washington .
During the 2006 Open, much of Winged Foot’s 18-hole East Course
was used for hospitality venues, parking and other
infrastructure needs.  “We realize the imposition that this creates on a club,”
O’Toole said. “We have to be very delicate with how we approach
this. The  New York  area is a special place for us. To be able to
go to that market on a course like Winged Foot, and with the
strength of corporate America in the area, it’s a great
combination.”  New York  The tournament will be the 20th U.S. Open played in New
York, the most of any state. Only  Pennsylvania ’s Oakmont Country
Club (9), New Jersey’s Baltusrol Golf Club (7) and Michigan’s
Oakland Hills Country Club (6) have currently hosted more U.S.
Opens than Winged Foot.  The tournament will follow the 2018 Open at Shinnecock
Hills Golf Club in Southampton, New York, and the 2019
tournament at  California ’s  Pebble Beach  Golf Links.
