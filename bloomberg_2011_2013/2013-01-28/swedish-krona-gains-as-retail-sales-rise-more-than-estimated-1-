Sweden ’s krona strengthened after
retail sales rose more than estimated last month, easing
pressure on the central bank to cut interest rates.  The krona climbed 0.45 percent against the euro to 8.6529,
the second-biggest gainer among 17 major currencies tracked by
Bloomberg. It rose 0.45 percent versus the dollar to 6.4294 as
of 3:44 p.m. in Stockholm.  Sales grew an annual 2.5 percent in December, compared with
0.9 percent the previous month, Stockholm-based Statistics
Sweden said today. The median estimate in a survey of five
economists by Bloomberg was for a 1.4 percent increase. Monthly
retail sales rose 1.2 percent.  “On balance we expect to see a moderately positive trend
in retail sales in 2013,” said Andreas Jonsson, an economist at
Nordea Bank AB in  Stockholm , in a note.  Sweden’s central bank on Dec. 18 reduced its benchmark
interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point for a fourth
time in a year, bringing it to 1 percent, as the Nordic country
suffers from slowing export demand. The bank predicted it will
keep the benchmark rate unchanged until the end of this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
