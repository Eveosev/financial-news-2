French retirement-home operators
including  Orpea SA (ORP) ,  Korian (KORI)  and  Medica SA (MDCA) , plunged in Paris
trading on signs the government will restrict rent increases.  Puteaux-based Orpea,  France ’s biggest publicly traded
operator,  lost  4.6 percent to 31.05 euros in Paris trading
today, its steepest one-day decline since Nov. 18, 2011. Korian
shares closed down 1 percent to 14.24 euros, after falling as
much as 7.5 percent in the session.  President Francois Hollande’s government wants to “act on
the cost of retirement homes,” Michele Delaunay, delegate
minister for the elderly and the dependent, was cited as saying
in an  interview  with  Le Parisien  two days ago. The minister also
told the newspaper that the facilities will no longer be allowed
to increase room costs for older people at will.  The minister’s comments sparked concern about potential
“uncertainty on the regulatory environment” for these
companies, Mathieu Chabert, an analyst at Bryan Garnier & Co. in
Paris, said in a telephone interview. “This is weighing on
shares of nursing-home operators today.”  Shares in  Medica , another retirement-home operator,
retreated 4.5 percent to 14.08 euros while rival  Le Noble Age (LNA) 
was down 5.4 percent to 11 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
