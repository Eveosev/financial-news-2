India’s (SENSEX)  benchmark stock index held
near a two-year high before the central bank’s  monetary policy 
review tomorrow.  The BSE  India  Sensitive Index, or Sensex, closed little
changed at 20,103.35, with volumes on the gauge lagging behind
the 30-day average by 16 percent. The index ended last week at
20,103.53, the highest level since Jan. 6, 2011.  Tata Motors
Ltd. (TTMT) , the owner of Jaguar Land Rover, climbed 2.5 percent while
state-run explorer Oil & Natural Gas Corp. dropped 1.8 percent.  The  Reserve Bank  of India will probably cut the benchmark
rate by 25 basis points to 7.75 percent tomorrow, according to
25 of 29 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The central bank last
reduced the rate by half a percentage point in April, and has
resisted calls from Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram for
further reductions to bolster an economy growing at the slowest
pace in a decade, citing high inflation.  “It feels like the night before Christmas for the markets
as investors wonder whether or not they’ll get a Santa visit,”
said Shankar Char, vice-president at ICICI Securities Ltd. in
Mumbai. “While the bigger picture remains a bit cloudy, foreign
funds continue to pour money into Indian stocks.”  The government’s  economic-policy overhaul may boost room
to focus on spurring growth, the RBI said in a report released
after market closed. Still, the authority signaling the scope
for easing is limited by risks such as elevated prices. While
gains in the benchmark  wholesale-price index  slowed to a three-
year low of 7.18 percent last month, inflation has stayed above
the RBI’s comfort level of 5 percent the past three years.  Auto Stocks  Tata Motors climbed 2.5 percent to 308.55 rupees, and
motorcycle maker  Hero MotoCorp Ltd. (HMCL)  jumped 1.9 percent to
1,798.35 rupees, its biggest jump since Dec. 12. ONGC dropped
1.8 percent to 334.95 rupees after closing on Jan. 25 at its
highest level in more than two years.  Maruti added 0.5 percent to 1,608.15 rupees, the highest
since Dec. 14, 2009. The stock rallied 3.9 percent on Jan. 25 as
third-quarter  profit  at the unit of  Suzuki Motor Corp. (7269)  more than
doubled to 5.01 billion rupees, beating the 4.89 billion-rupee
median  analyst  estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  Two out of 13, or 15 percent, of Sensex-listed stocks that
have reported December-quarter  earnings  have trailed forecasts,
compared with 40 percent in the previous two quarters, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  The Sensex has advanced 3.5 percent this year, extending
last year’s 26 percent jump, as government efforts to open up
more industries to overseas investment and cut fuel subsidies
helped lure foreigners. Overseas funds have  bought  a net $3.01
billion of shares this year through Jan. 23, according to the
regulator, surpassing the previous January record of $2.18
billion set last year.  Record Flows  Inflows surged to $24.5 billion in 2012, the highest among
10 Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg, excluding  China , helping
the Sensex to post its biggest annual gain in three years. The
gauge trades at 15.9 times estimated earnings, compared with a
multiple of 10.9 times for the  MSCI Emerging Markets Index. (MXEF)   Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , operator of the world’s largest
refining complex, retreated 1.6 percent to 897.55 rupees, its
steepest decline since Oct. 8. The company’s KG-D6 and NEC-25
fields are among 14 oil and gas blocks that have been declared
“no-go” areas by India’s defense ministry, barring any
exploration or production activity, the  Press Trust of India 
reported, citing people it didn’t identify.  The S&P CNX  Nifty Index (NIFTY)  on the National Stock Exchange of
India was little changed at 6,074.80 while its January futures
traded at 6,078.15. India VIX, which gauges the cost of
protection against losses in the Nifty, gained for a third day,
rising 2.7 percent to 15.17, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
