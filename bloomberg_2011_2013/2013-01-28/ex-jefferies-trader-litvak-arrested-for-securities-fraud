A former Jefferies & Co. managing director was arrested and accused of defrauding customers of more than $2 million on trades of residential mortgage-backed securities, prosecutors said.  Jesse C. Litvak, 38, of  New York , was arrested today at his home and charged with 16 counts including securities fraud, fraud connected with the Troubled Asset Relief Program and making false statements to the federal government, Connecticut U.S. Attorney David Fein said in a statement.  Alleged victims include “numerous” investment funds, among them six established by the U.S. Treasury Department in 2009 as part of its response to the financial crisis, according to the statement. Litvak also defrauded private investment funds, according to the statement.  “Illegally profiting from a federal program designed to assist our nation in recovering from one of our worst economic crises is reprehensible,” Fein said in the statement.  Litvak is charged with 11 counts of  securities fraud  and may face as long as 20 years in prison on each count if convicted. He is also charged with one count of TARP fraud, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison, and four counts of making false statements to the government, each punishable by as much as five years in prison.  Customer Complaint  A customer complained to Jefferies in November 2011 that it had been overcharged for some mortgage-backed securities, according to Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or Finra, records, which didn’t identify the customer. Jefferies settled the case in March for $2.2 million, according to the records.  Litvak was hired by Jefferies in April 2008 and was fired on Dec. 21, 2011, according to the indictment. He previously worked for RBS Greenwich Capital, according to Finra’s records.  Litvak said in a Delaware Chancery Court filing in October that he was under investigation by the U.S. attorney for  Connecticut , the Office of the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, Finra and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. He is seeking money from Jefferies to cover his legal fees. The firm said in a court filing that the matter should be resolved in arbitration.  The SEC today filed a  lawsuit  against Litvak in federal court in Connecticut, accusing him of defrauding investors in more than 25 trades from 2009 to 2011.  “Every Jefferies counterparty in each transaction in this indictment got the exact bond bargained for at a price each wanted to pay,”  Patrick J. Smith , an attorney with DLA Piper in New York who is representing Litvak, said in a statement.  Sophisticated Investors  “These were principal transactions between sophisticated market participants,” Smith said. “There were no ‘commissions’ on any of these trades. All of the profits that Jefferies earned on each trade were well within industry norms for the mortgage- backed bonds in this case.”  Litvak didn’t “cheat anyone out of a dime,” Smith said.  “In fact, most of these trades turned out to be hugely profitable,” Smith said. “The allegation that Jesse defrauded any counter-party -- PPIP or private -- is simply untrue. Jesse looks forward to the trial in this case so that his name can be cleared and he can get on with his career.”  Richard Khaleel, a spokesman for New York-based Jefferies, declined to comment on the case.  Complete Information  “The kind of false claims made by Mr. Litvak repeatedly were unfit for a used car lot let alone the marketplace for mortgage-backed securities,” George Canellos, deputy director of the SEC’s enforcement division, said today on a conference call. “Some of Litvak’s customers were sophisticated investors, but the law does not allow you to lie to some types of investors and not others. All investors are entitled to truthful and complete information.”  Litvak pleaded not guilty today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Holly Fitzsimmons in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and was released on a $1 million bond pending a May 6 appearance before U.S. District Judge Janet Hall in  New Haven , Fein said today in a conference call with reporters.  The Treasury Department started the Legacy Securities Public-Private Investment Program in 2009 in response to the financial crisis, using more than $22 billion of TARP bailout funds to help the market for investments including residential mortgage-backed securities, according to Fein’s statement.  Housing Bubble  Pools of home loans securitized into bonds were a central part of the  housing bubble  that helped send the U.S. into the biggest recession since the 1930s. The market collapsed, and the crisis swept up lenders and investment banks as the market for the securities evaporated.  More than 100 firms applied to manage one of the nine funds established under the program, and each received $1.4 billion to $3.7 billion of bailout money to invest along with private capital, according to Fein’s statement.  Litvak is accused of misrepresenting the asking price of sellers of residential mortgage-backed securities to buyers or vice versa, keeping the difference for Jefferies, according to Fein’s statement.  Litvak is also accused of misrepresenting to buyers in other transactions that the bonds in Jefferies’s inventory were being offered for sale by a fake third-party seller, according to Fein’s statement.  Fake Seller  The fake seller was created by Litvak, allowing him to charge an extra commission that Jefferies wasn’t entitled to, according to Fein’s statement.  Litvak’s trading revenue “steadily declined” each year he was at Jefferies, from a profit of more than $40 million in 2009 to a loss of more than $10 million in 2011, and his scheme “increased the profitability of his trades,” according to the indictment.  Mortgage-bond salesmen usually charge a commission of between 4 ticks -- 4/32 of 1 percent -- and 8 ticks on trades where they act as middlemen to match a buyer and a seller, according to the indictment. Litvak in some cases earned profits of as much as 6 percent. He once told another trader, “f this 4-8/32 sht.”  In December 2009, he told a  fund manager  at Wellington Management Co., “winner winner chicken dinner......he is gonna sell em to me at 75-28 as I told him to not get cute and just sell the bonds so you can own them at 76.” Jefferies had actually bought the bonds nine days earlier for 70 cents on the dollar.  Joint Initiative  Litvak is being prosecuted in coordination with the  RMBS Working Group , a joint federal and state initiative started last year to probe misconduct related to the financial crisis, according to Fein’s statement.  A total of 121 people have been charged with crimes related to TARP. Litvak is the first to be charged under a 2009 law that makes it illegal to defraud the government in relation to TARP, said  Christy Romero , special inspector general for the program.  Congress authorized $700 billion for the financial rescue in October 2008, and President  George W. Bush  signed the bill into law. TARP, which spent $418 billion to stabilize banks including Citigroup Inc. and Morgan Stanley and fund bailouts of companies such as American International Group Inc. and General Motors Co. , will ultimately cost taxpayers $24 billion, the  Congressional Budget Office  estimated in October.  The six funds established by the Treasury Department that are alleged to be victims of Litvak’s are managed by Angelo Gordon & Co. LP, AllianceBernstein Holding LP, BlackRock Inc., Invesco Ltd., RLJ Western Asset Management LLC and Wellington Management Co. LLP, according to the indictment.  Other victims of Litvak’s alleged scheme include billionaire  George Soros ’ Soros Fund Management LLC, Magnetar Capital and  Putnam Investments , according to the indictment.  The civil case is SEC v. Litvak, 13-132, U.S. District Court, District of Connecticut (New Haven).
