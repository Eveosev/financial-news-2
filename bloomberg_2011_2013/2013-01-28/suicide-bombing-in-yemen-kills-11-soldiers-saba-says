A suicide bombing targeting a
military checkpoint in the central Yemeni city of Radaa today
killed 11 soldiers and wounded 17, the state-run Saba news
agency said in a text message.  The suicide bombing came hours after the military began a
campaign against al-Qaeda militants in the province of al-
Baidha, where Radaa is located.  The government said on Jan. 25 that the co-founder of
Yemen-based al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, Saudi citizen
Saeed al-Shihri, died after succumbing to wounds sustained in
Yemen on Nov. 28. Al-Shihri commanded all Saudi operatives in
the group and oversaw attacks on the Yemeni military in the
Abyan region.  Al-Qaeda has used bases in Yemen to strike Western targets
inside the country as well as mount cross-border attacks on
Saudi Arabia, the worldâ€™s largest crude exporter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
