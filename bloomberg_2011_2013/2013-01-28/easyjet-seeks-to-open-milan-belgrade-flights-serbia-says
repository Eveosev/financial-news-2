EasyJet Plc (EZJ)  requested from  Serbia  to
start seasonal flights between Milan, Italy and the Serbian
capital as of April 15.  The Luton, England-based carrier wants to fly four times a
week on the route through end-October, Serbia’s  Civil Aviation
Directorate  said in an e-mailed statement. It takes about two
weeks to process such applications, directorate spokeswoman
Katarina Andric-Milosavljevic said in a telephone interview.  No airline currently offers Belgrade-Milan flights
“although demand is considerable,” the directorate said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
