Loyalists of Jordan’s King Abdullah II dominate the newly elected lower house of parliament,
according to final results announced by the Independent
Elections Commission today.  The 150-seat lower house includes 30 members of the
previous parliament and about 70 lawmakers who are tribal
leaders, historically known for their loyalty to the royal
family. It also includes two members arrested before the Jan. 23
elections on charges of vote-buying.  Jordan’s Muslim Brotherhood, the country’s largest
opposition group, which boycotted the elections in protest at
the electoral law, which it says favors the king’s supporters.  Despite that, turnout rose to 57 percent of voters from 53
percent in 2010, the commission said.  Zaki Bani Irsheid, the Brotherhood’s deputy leader,
dismissed today’s results, saying in an interview “the current
lower house is similar to the previous, inefficient one.  ‘‘It lacks true opposition,’’ Bani Irsheid said in a
telephone interview today.  Riots erupted in some parts of Jordan last week after the
turnout data was released, the state-run Petra news agency
reported. In Irbid, protesters blocked the main highway that
connects the city with Al Huson.  To contact the reporter on this story:
