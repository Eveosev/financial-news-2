Beijing recommended children, the
elderly and those with illnesses stay indoors today because of
rising pollution levels as smog covered the Chinese capital.  The concentration of PM2.5, the fine air particulates that
pose the greatest health risk, was 321 micrograms per cubic
meter at 8 a.m. near  Tiananmen Square  and had averaged 299
micrograms in the past 24 hours, according to the Beijing
Municipal Environmental Monitoring Center’s website. The  World
Health Organization  recommends 24-hour  exposure to PM2.5  of no
higher than 25.  Pollution levels increased after fog covered large parts of
eastern and central  China . Visibility in the cities of Beijing
and Tianjin and portions of Henan, Anhui and Jiangxi provinces
may fall to less than 200 meters, according to the National
Meteorological Center, which also asked residents in those areas
to  take precautions  for declining air quality.  Beijing’s environmental monitoring center said yesterday
that the city’s air quality may not see any “noticeable
improvement” in the next two to three days.  The city has already proposed rules that would scrap old
vehicles, ban new cement and steel factories, and impose fines
for street vendors barbecuing food by roadsides on smoggy days
after PM2.5 readings reached a record 993 micrograms this month.
Long-term exposure to fine particulates raises the risk of
cardiovascular and respiratory diseases as well as  lung cancer ,
according to the WHO.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
