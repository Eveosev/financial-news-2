Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
widened for a fifth day as oversupply kept the additive from
keeping pace with a rally for the motor fuel.  The spread widened 3.24 cents after  Hess Corp. (HES)  said it will
shut the Port Reading, New Jersey, refinery at the end of
February and sell its terminal business.  Gains for gasoline futures “seemed to be driven by the
announcement of Hess Corp.’s exit from the refinery business,”
said Michael Breitenbach, an analyst and trader at Blue Ocean
Brokerage LLC in New York. “Ethanol was left in the dust.”  The grain-based additive was 53.18 cents cheaper than
gasoline, based on prompt-month contracts for both commodities,
the widest since Jan. 10. The spread was 49.94 cents Jan. 25.  Denatured ethanol for February delivery advanced 2.7 cents,
or 1.1 percent, to $2.403 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the highest level since Dec. 6. Prices have risen 9.7
percent this year.  Stockpiles of the fuel in the week ended Jan. 18 were 20
million barrels, up 1.4 percent from a year earlier, an Energy
Information Administration report showed, the highest for this
time of  year  since the Energy Department’s statistical agency
began tracking weekly data for ethanol in June 2010.  Ethanol producers have sought to deal with the glut and
higher corn prices by reducing output.  Poet LLC, the second-biggest U.S. ethanol maker, said Jan.
25 that it will idle a plant in Macon,  Missouri , on Feb. 1,
because there isn’t enough corn available.  Inventories ‘Heavy’  “Despite the recent ethanol plant shutdowns, inventories
still remain slightly heavy,” Breitenbach said.  Corn for March delivery jumped 8.5 cents, or 1.2 percent,
to $7.2925 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  Gasoline for February delivery rose 5.94 cents, or 2.1
percent, to $2.9348 a gallon on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.  In cash market trading, ethanol in New York added 2.5
cents, or 1 percent, to $2.495 a gallon and on the West Coast
the additive increased 2 cents to $2.59, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Ethanol in  Chicago  climbed 1.5 cents to $2.385 a gallon and
on the Gulf Coast the biofuel slipped 2 cents to $2.40.  To contact the reporter on this story:
