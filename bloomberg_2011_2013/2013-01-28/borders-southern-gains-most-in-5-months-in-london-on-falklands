Borders & Southern Petroleum Plc (BOR) 
rose the most in five months in London after raising estimates
for a gas condensate discovery off the Falkland Islands.  The company jumped as much as 25 percent, the biggest gain
since Aug. 23. The Darwin find may hold about 210 million
barrels of gas condensate, a light crude associated with gas
production, rather than the prior 190 million-barrel estimate.  Borders last year found gas and some oil in a drilling
campaign south of the islands, two years after  Rockhopper
Exploration Plc (RKH)  made the first commercial discovery to the north
of the archipelago  Margaret Thatcher  went to war to keep British
in 1982. Darwin would be commercial at an oil price of $65 a
barrel, according to a feasibility study commissioned by
Borders. It’s looking for partners for its next drilling
campaign as Brent crude trades at higher than $100 a barrel.  “We have a portfolio containing a very attractive
discovery along with an exploration prospect inventory of
quality and depth,” Borders Chief Executive Officer Howard Obee
said in a statement. “The company is now moving into an
exciting new phase, as we look to appraise the discovery and add
to the discovered resources through further exploration.”  Borders rose 13 percent to 27 pence by 8:45 a.m. in London.  Falkland Oil & Gas Ltd. (FOGL) , an explorer with licenses to the
south of the islands, and Rockhopper also climbed in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
