Estonian renewable energy output
rose by two percentage points to 14.9 percent of total
consumption last year, helped by increased electricity
production from biomass in the first eight months of the year.  The share of renewables in overall consumption exceeds the
11.3 percent target for 2013, Tallinn-based grid operator
Elering AS said in an e-mailed statement today.  Electricity output from biomass, the biggest source of
renewable energy, increased by 15 percent last year due to co-
burning with oil shale in Eesti Energia ASâ€™s two main power
plants near Narva, northeastern  Estonia , Elering said. Still,
biomass output fell from September when the government decided
to stop using biomass at the plants to reduce costs for the
consumers who subsidize renewable energy directly through their
energy bills.  Wind output rose 23 percent due to three new wind parks,
Elering said.  Estonia this month opened the remaining two thirds of its
 electricity market  to competition. Parliament is discussing
changes to the electricity market law that would link the
renewable-energy subsidies to the market price of electricity
and reduce the subsidies by 15 percent to 20 percent.  The changes, which need clearance for state aid from the
European Commission, would save consumers as much as 300 million
euros ($404 million) until 2020, the Cabinet said last October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
