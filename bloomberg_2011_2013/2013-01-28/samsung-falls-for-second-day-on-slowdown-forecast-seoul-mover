Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , the world’s
largest maker of smartphones, fell for a second day in Seoul
trading after warning about a slowdown in global demand and
saying a stronger won will cut operating profit this year.  The company dropped 3.2 percent to close at 1,372,000 won,
the lowest since Nov. 20. The company, also the world’s largest
maker of TVs, declined 2.5 percent on Jan. 25.  South Korea ’s biggest company by market capitalization said
Jan. 25 it expected “somewhat weaker” demand for smartphones
this year amid market saturation in developed nations and
competition in the low-end sector for Chinese suppliers.  Apple
Inc. (AAPL)  has also plunged 17 percent this year on concerns about
smartphone demand.  “Strong growth in the smartphone market has come to an
end,” said Doh Hyun Woo, a Seoul-based analyst at Mirae Asset
Securities. “There are also persistent concerns about Samsung’s
first-quarter earnings.”  The electronics company may report net income as low as 8
trillion won in the period, Doh said. He had earlier expected
8.8 trillion won, he said.  The stronger won may cut operating profit by 3 trillion won
($2.8 billion) this year, Samsung said Jan. 25. The currency has
jumped about 1.7 percent against the dollar since Sept. 28,
compared with a 14 percent decline for the yen, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. A stronger won cuts the repatriated
value of South Korean exporters’ overseas sales.  The company boosted fourth-quarter  net income  76 percent to
7.04 trillion won, surpassing the 6.8 trillion-won average of
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
