Defunct trading firm Swift Trade
Inc. lost an appeal over an 8 million-pound ($12.6 million) fine
for market abuse from the U.K. Financial Services Authority.  Swift Trade, which was dissolved in December 2010, was
fined for “layering,” in which multiple buy orders for shares
are submitted and withdrawn to manipulate the price of a
security, the FSA said in an e-mailed statement. The practice
led to a “misleading impression of supply and demand and an
artificial share price,” the FSA said.  “This was a particularly cynical case where a business
model was based on market abuse,” Tracey McDermott, director of
enforcement at the FSA, said in an e-mailed statement.  The Ontario Securities Commission also found that Swift
Trade breached securities laws by providing software and an
electronic trading system for around 4,500 unregistered traders
in 2008, according to a 2011  report . The firm failed to
establish proper controls and supervision, adequately monitor
its clients’ trading, or produce accurate trading records, the
agency said.  The company had appealed the penalty at a London tribunal
in June, saying that the fine was “entirely disproportionate”
to its activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
