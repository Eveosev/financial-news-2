A defendant accused of gang raping
and murdering a student in New Delhi in an attack that shocked
 India  has been declared a juvenile by a court, meaning the
maximum sentence he can receive is three years in jail.  The Juvenile Justice Board in India’s capital said the male
is 17 years old, citing his school records, CNN-IBN television
 reported . Prosecutors have sought the death penalty for the
other five accused who are being tried in a specially convened
fast-track court.  “Sentencing is far too lenient for juveniles in India,”
D.B Goswami, a Supreme Court lawyer specializing in criminal
cases said in an interview after the ruling. “If you are old
enough to rape a woman, then you are old enough to know what you
are doing and face the consequences.”  Indian political leaders have been calling for tougher
sentences for criminals under the age of 18 in the wake of the
woman’s murder. The brutal attack on the medical student as she
returned home after watching a movie on Dec. 16 triggered street
protests and drew attention to the scale of sexual violence
against women in the world’s largest democracy.  A woman was raped every 22 minutes in 2011, according to
the  National Crime Records Bureau . There were 572 cases of rape
reported in  New Delhi  that year, a 23 percent increase from
2008. The rise may reflect a greater confidence in reporting
assaults.  To contact the reporter on this story:
