Turkey’s  stocks  fell the most in 16
months as a credit rating upgrade anticipated by some analysts
failed to materialize from Moody’s Investors Service.  The benchmark  ISE National 100 Index (XU100)  dropped 4.2 percent,
the most since September 2011, to 81,165.81 at the close in
Istanbul. The index  lost  3.5 percent within 1 1/2 hours of 1:50
p.m., 10 minutes before Moody’s issued a statement outlining
conditions for an upgrade. Of the 100 stocks, 98 fell, with
trading volume at 38 percent above the gauge’s 30-day moving
average. The measure hit a record high on Jan. 24.  An hour before its 5 p.m. conference call on Turkey,
Moody’s said it would consider raising the rating to investment
grade if “the government made further progress in lowering its
external vulnerabilities.” The government can achieve this goal
by “structurally reducing the current-account deficit,
increasing foreign-exchange reserves, or reducing the private
sector’s external borrowing,” it said in an updated credit
opinion.  “Turkey partially met the first two conditions, while the
third condition is impossible to meet,”  Ozgur Altug , the chief
economist at Istanbul-based BGC Partners, said in an e-mailed
comment to clients today. The company’s “insistence on
structural problems” appears to be “a little bit
discouraging,” Altug said.  The nation’s banking  index  slid 5.6 percent. The three-day
decline in lenders’ stocks was the steepest loss since August
2011.  Turkiye Is Bankasi (ISCTR)  AS slumped 7.3 percent,  Akbank TAS (AKBNK) 
dropped 5.7 percent,  Turkiye Halk Bankasi AS (HALKB)  fell 5.5 percent
and  Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN)  slipped 4.8 percent.  Fitch Ratings raised Turkey’s credit rating to BBB- on Nov.
5, its lowest investment grade. Moody’s rates Turkey at Ba1, one
level below investment grade. Standard & Poor’s rates the
country two levels below that threshold.  Financing of the current-account gap renders Turkey
vulnerable and the country’s savings rate trails many of its
peers,  Sarah Carlson , an analyst at Moody’s, said in a
teleconference call.  To contact the reporter on this story:
