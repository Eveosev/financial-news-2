Wheat gained for a second straight
session after weather in the southern U.S. Great Plains was
drier than forecast, increasing concern that the worst drought
since the 1930s will curb grain production.  About 0.03 inch of rain (0.1 centimeter) fell in Hays,
 Kansas , where nearly an inch was forecast on Jan. 25, said  Jeff McReynolds , the owner of McReynolds Marketing and Investments.
Telvent DTN meteorologists who last week projected that rain
would fall in Kansas said today dry weather will persist “with
no relief in sight.”  “We went home on Friday with a chance that somebody might
get a meaningful amount of precipitation, and that didn’t
happen,” McReynolds said by telephone from his office in Hays.  Wheat futures for March delivery gained 0.4 percent to
settle at $7.7925 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. The price has risen 0.2 percent this month.  In the U.S., wheat is the fourth-largest crop, valued at
$14.4 billion in 2011, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government
data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
