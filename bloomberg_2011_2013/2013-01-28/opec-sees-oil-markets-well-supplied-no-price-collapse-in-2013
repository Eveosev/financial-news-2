Global crude markets will remain
well supplied in 2013 to meet growing demand and OPEC doesn’t
expect prices to drop this year, OPEC Secretary-General Abdalla El-Badri said.  “At present the market is well-balanced. Looking ahead for
2013 the market is expected to remain well-supplied to meet
expected demand growth,” he said during a conference at Chatham
House in London today. Resource availability to meet growing
demand “is not an issue,” he said.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries doesn’t
“envision a price collapse” in 2013 and concerns about
geopolitical instability “should not be overblown,” he said.  Brent crude oil prices have closed above $110 a barrel
every day this month after rallying 3.5 percent in 2012 to
$111.11. OPEC, which supplies about 40 percent of the world’s
oil, cut crude output by 465,000 barrels a day in December to
30.4 million barrels a day, the lowest since October 2011, led
by a reduction in Saudi Arabia, the group said in a Jan. 16
monthly report. That’s still 800,000 a day more than the average
29.6 million the group estimates it will need to supply to
consumers in 2013.  There is no need for OPEC to cut oil supply if economies
are struggling, El-Badri said. OPEC meets next on May 31.  Success that the U.S. has had in building up production
from oil shale deposits will be difficult to match in other
countries because that industry is still at “very early
development stages,” he said. “Questions remain about how
sustainable this growth will be in the long term,” he said.  Peak oil will not come in the near future, El-Badri said,
referring to the theory than eventually a point in time will
arrive when total world production will start to decline from
the highest level it will ever reach.  “We appear to have moved on from the peak oil debate the
industry was having only a few years ago,” he said. “Peak oil
will come one day but not for the foreseeable future.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
