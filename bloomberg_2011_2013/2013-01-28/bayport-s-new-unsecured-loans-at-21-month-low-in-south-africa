Bayport Financial Services Pty Ltd.,
a South African provider of unsecured credit, sold the fewest
new loans in 21 months as it tightened the lending criteria for
customers after the market expanded.  The company granted 12,266 new loans in December, the least
since April 2011, the company said in a statement today on its
website. About 193 million rand ($21.6 million) in loans were
made, down from 235 million rand in November, it said.  The value of consumer loans not backed by assets surged 39
percent in the year through September to 140 billion rand,
according to the Johannesburg-based National Credit Regulator.
The loans accounted for 10 percent of  consumer credit  at the end
of September. Johannesburg-based  Transaction Capital Ltd. (TCP) , which
controls Bayport, cut its approval rate to less than 10 percent
as it targeted less-risky customers, Chief Financial Officer
David Hurwitz said.  “It’s deliberate, but it’s not a recent reaction to market
conditions,” Hurwitz said by phone from Johannesburg today.
“We have consistently, for an extended period of time, been
cautious.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
