Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) , Japanâ€™s largest
trading house by market value, today announced plans to build
three solar power stations with total capacity of 95 megawatts
as it deepens its presence in alternative energy.  Mitsubishi and C-Tech Corp., a clean energy and
telecommunications unit of  Chubu Electric Power Co. (9502) , will build
a 77 megawatt station in Aichi prefecture in central Japan, the
companies said in a statement today. It is estimated to cost
more than 20 billion yen ($220 million), with 80 percent of the
funding raised through project financing, according to the
statement.  The trading company will also build a 12 megawatt station
and a 6 megawatt solar plant in Fukushima prefecture in
northeastern  Japan , it said in a separate statement. The total
cost will be about 6 billion yen and Mitsubishi wants to raise
as much as 80 percent of the cost through project financing,
Takashi Shiwaku, a spokesman, said by phone today.  Mitsubishi has announced plans for a total 97 megawatts of
solar capacity including the three plants today, according to
Shiwaku. The company wants to expand its capacity to 200
megawatts by 2020.  The Fukushima stations will start operation from mid-2014
and the Aichi plant will begin by March 2015, according to the
statements.  To contact the reporters on this story:
