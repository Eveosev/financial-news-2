Nigeria’s naira fell the most in
almost a week on demand for dollars to fund gasoline imports.  The currency of  Africa ’s largest oil producer weakened 0.1
percent, the most since Jan. 23 on a closing basis, to 157.13 a
dollar as of 3:42 p.m. in Lagos, the commercial capital,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Nigeria relies on imports to meet 70 percent of its fuel
needs because of inadequate refining capacity, according to the
Petroleum Ministry. Fuel imports have been a source of pressure
on the naira, according to the central bank.  “Some oil importers got their import permit from the
Pipeline and Petroleum Pricing Regulatory Agency last week and
are demanding dollars,” Tunde Ladipo, chief executive officer
of Lagos-based Valuechain Investment Ltd., said by phone today.  The Central Bank of Nigeria kept its benchmark interest
rate unchanged for the eighth time on Jan. 21. The regulator,
which sells dollars to lenders at auctions on Mondays and
Wednesdays to stabilize the naira, sold $150 million at today’s
auction, unchanged from the sale on Jan. 23, it said in an e-
mailed statement.  The  inflation rate  in December eased to 12 percent, from
12.3 percent in the previous month, as the effects of flooding
that damaged agricultural output last year began to subside.  The yield on the country’s 16.39 percent domestic bonds due
January 2022 fell two basis points 11.28 percent in the
secondary market, according to Jan. 25 data on the  Financial
Markets Dealers Association  website.  The yield on $500 million of Eurobonds due January 2021
rose three basis points to 3.802 percent today.  Ghana ’s cedi weakened 0.1 percent to 1.8985 a dollar in
Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
