Ben Steele, who joined hedge fund
Armajaro Asset Management LLP last year to start a pool trading
shares of financial companies, has died. He was 35.  He died on Jan. 25 of a suspected heart attack, according
to  Andrew Mitchell , a spokesman for the London-based firm.  Armajaro, which oversees about $2 billion, started the
Global Financials fund last year to expand beyond its roots in
trading commodities. The firm hired Steele and Peter Walters
from asset manager  TT International Ltd. (TTI)  to run the pool.  Before joining Armajaro in May, Steele was co-portfolio
manager of the TT Long/Short Financials fund, which posted an
average gain of 9.7 percent a year since it opened in 2005,
according to a marketing document for the Armajaro Global
Financials fund obtained by Bloomberg News.  Steele joined TT in 2005 from Frankfurt-based  Deutsche Bank
AG (DBK) , where he led European financials trading, according to the
Armajaro prospectus. He started at Deutsche Bank in 1999 after
receiving an Economics degree from Englandâ€™s Durham University.  Armajaro, started in 2002 by former Phibro LLC trader
 Anthony Ward , has six hedge funds in addition to the financials
fund. Ward, 52, oversees two pools focused on commodities such
as cocoa and coffee. The company also has a fund that trades
emerging-market stocks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
