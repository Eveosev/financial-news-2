Government of Singapore Investment
Corp.  invested in a mortgage program that will provide loans for
commercial property in the U.K., Laxfield Capital said.  The lending program will invest as much as 1 billion pounds
($1.6 billion) over the next 24 months, Laxfield, a London-based
mortgage company, said in a  statement  on its website. GIC, the
Singapore sovereign wealth fund managing more than $100 billion
of the city’s reserves, confirmed the investment in an e-mail
and declined to disclose the amount of the funds injected.  Real estate investments accounted for 10 percent of GIC’s
portfolio as of March 2012, unchanged from the previous year,
the state fund said in its latest annual review, published in
July. Property investments are “part of the diversified
portfolio that GIC manages and serves as a good hedge against
inflation,” according to a recent statement.  The Laxfield program “complements our existing direct
junior debt investment strategy which we will continue to
pursue,” Chris Morrish, regional head of  Europe  at GIC Real
Estate said in the statement.  The program will provide loans between 40 million pounds
and 185 million pounds with duration of five to seven years for
commercial properties including office, residential and retail,
Laxfield said. The program will also seek joint investments with
other lenders where GIC will retain “a substantial junior
investment in each loan,” according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
