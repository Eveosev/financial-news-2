General Motors Co. (GM) , planning to
invest $1.5 billion in its North American factories this year,
today said it would spend $600 million to expand a Kansas
vehicle-assembly plant.  The project includes construction of a new paint shop and
installation of a new stamping press, GM said in a statement on
its website. The Detroit-based automaker is introducing about 20
new vehicles in the U.S. this year, including 13 Chevrolet
models, to freshen its product lineup, which has grown stale
following the company’s 2009 bankruptcy reorganization.  Mark Reuss , president of GM North America, earlier this
month provided the $1.5 billion figure for the company’s 2013
North American factory investment plans. GM has announced more
than $10.2 billion since July 2009, Reuss said at the Automotive
News World Congress in  Detroit .  The Fairfax Assembly Plant in  Kansas City , Kansas, which
employs about 3,900 people, builds the Chevrolet Malibu and
Buick LaCrosse sedans. In 2011, GM announced $20 million of
upgrades for the plant and $136 million in 2010, according to
the company’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
