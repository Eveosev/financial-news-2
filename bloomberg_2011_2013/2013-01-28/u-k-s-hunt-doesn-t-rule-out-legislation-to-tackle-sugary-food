Health Secretary  Jeremy Hunt  said he
doesn’t rule out legislation on food high in sugar, in a bid to
tackle a growing obesity problem in England.  “In the end, this is a matter of individual choice,” Hunt
told ITV Plc’s “The Agenda” program today when asked about the
possibility of a new law. “It’s a matter of people making
decisions about their own lives but I don’t rule it out and
there are things that we’re doing.”  Hunt said he does not favor legislation if manufacturers
and supermarkets such as Tesco Plc and J Sainsbury Plc can work
toward a so-called “responsibility deal” to bring down the
sugar content in food. He called legislation a “blunt tool” to
tackle the problem.  More than 60 percent of adults and a third of 10- and 11-
year-olds are overweight or obese in  England , according to the
nation’s Department of Health.  “I just think that it’s a very blunt tool because in the
end you can say we want to have certain children’s cereal have
less sugar content and people will find another something that
calls itself a cereal that has more sugar content in it,” Hunt
said. “Much more important is things like the way that
supermarkets present fresh fruit, and do they have offers on
fresh fruit and fresh produce as they do on sugary products.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
