Jos. A. Bank Clothiers Inc. (JOSB)  plunged
the most in more than four years after saying annual profit will
fall 20 percent amid lost sales from unseasonably warm weather
and U.S. political uncertainty.  Shares of the century-old maker of men’s apparel  fell  15
percent to $39.28 at the close in New York, the biggest one-day
drop since September 2008. Competitor  Men’s Wearhouse Inc. (MW)  also
declined today, falling 5.9 percent to $31.21, the biggest one-
day drop since June.  While sales for the fiscal year ending Feb. 2 will exceed
$1 billion for the first time, the increase will be offset by
higher marketing expenses and lower gross margin, the Hampstead,
Maryland-based retailer said in a statement after the close of
trading on Jan. 25. Jos. A. Bank said the fourth quarter started
slowly, hurt by superstorm Sandy, uncertainty around the  U.S.
presidential election  and the fiscal cliff, and was further
affected by warm weather.  “Going into the critical holiday selling season, starting
on Black Friday, we believed we had a strong marketing and
promotional strategy for the period,” Chief Executive Officer
R. Neal Black said in the statement. “However, many of the
promotional items and a large part of our holiday assortment
were items that sell best in cold weather and the weather was
unseasonably warm.”  Jos. A. Bank, founded in 1905, fell 13 percent in 2012,
snapping three straight years of gains. The shares were up 8.7
percent this year through Jan. 25 compared with a 9.1 percent
gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Retailing Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
