Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners
LP increased its offer for  Western Wind Energy Corp. (WND)  to C$2.60 a
share, calling it the “best and final offer.”  Brookfield also said that the company’s application to the
Ontario Securities Commission, announced yesterday, was “part
of Western Wind’s continuing strategy to frustrate the offer and
prevent the sale,” according to a statement today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
