Rubber retreated from the highest
level in almost a week as investors sold the commodity after the
yen’s decline against the dollar stalled, reducing the
attractiveness of contracts based in the Japanese currency.  The contract for delivery in June lost 0.2 percent to 311.1
yen a kilogram ($3,417 a metric ton) at 11:38 a.m. on the Tokyo
Commodity Exchange after advancing to 313.8 yen, the highest
level since Jan. 22. Futures for July delivery, listed on the
bourse today, traded at 314.4 yen.  The dollar reached its highest level in 2 1/2 years versus
the yen before data forecast to show a pickup in U.S. durable
goods orders, adding to signs of a recovery in the world’s
biggest economy. It traded at 91.06 yen after climbing to 91.26
yen, the highest level since June 2010.  “Investors locked in profits as the yen broke through 90
per dollar, the level that ruling party politicians had
previously described as appropriate,” said Takaki Shigemoto, an
analyst at research company JSC Corp. Excessive decline in the
yen may be negative for  Japan ’s economy as costs to import fuels
and foods will increase, curbing consumption, he said.  Rubber for May delivery fell 0.2 percent to 25,510  yuan 
($4,096) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange. Thai rubber
free-on-board added 0.3 percent to 97.80 baht ($3.27) a kilogram
on Jan. 25, according to the Rubber Research Institute of
 Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
