American International Group Inc. (AIG) 
posted the largest gain among big insurers as Sanford C.
Bernstein & Co. said the stock presents a “once in a
generation” opportunity after the firm repaid a U.S. rescue.  “With the Treasury out, and AIG a public company once
again, this will be the year that the company begins to make
progress on driving earnings, returns to buying back stock, and
likely institutes a dividend,” Josh Stirling, an analyst at
Bernstein, said in a note to investors today.  AIG rallied 1.6 percent to $37.30 at 4:01 p.m. in  New York ,
the  top increase  in the 22-company Standard & Poor’s 500
Insurance Index. The advance brought this year’s gain to 5.7
percent, after a 52 percent  surge  in 2012. New York-based AIG
repaid the last of its $182.3 bailout in December, more than
four years after the company’s near collapse and a U.S. rescue
wiped out most of the equity value.  The insurer still trades at about half of its book value
while rivals  Ace Ltd. (ACE)  and Travelers Cos. change hands today at
more than the measure of assets minus liabilities.  “We see a once in a generation low-risk chance to buy a
recovering franchise at a substantial discount,” wrote
Stirling, who reiterated his  outperform rating  on the company.
“Investors will rotate from bidding for the now expensive
quality names to scouring for value among the turnaround
stories.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
