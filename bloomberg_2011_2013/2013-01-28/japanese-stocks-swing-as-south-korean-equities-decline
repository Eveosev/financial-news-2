Most Asian  shares  outside Japan rose
after Chinese industrial profits increased for a fourth month.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average retreated after capping its
longest weekly winning streak in more than 40 years.  Anhui Conch Cement Co. led gains among Chinese makers of
the material in Hong Kong after Shenyin & Wanguo Securities Co.
recommended the sector. Nintendo Co. and  Sony Corp. (6758)  climbed more
than 3.4 percent on a report China may lift a ban on imports of
game consoles. Fanuc Corp. and Hitachi High-Technologies Corp.
each slumped more than 7 percent in Tokyo on earnings concern.  More than three stocks rose for every two that fell today
on the  MSCI Asia Pacific excluding Japan Index , which slipped
0.5 percent at 7:36 p.m. in Hong Kong. The regional gauge is
denominated in U.S. dollars so declines of more than 1 percent
today by the Taiwan dollar and South Korean won reduced the
value of companies in the measure. The gauge gained 2.1 percent
this year through Jan. 25 amid signs of recovery in the world’s
two biggest economies.  “Asian markets tend to do well when global economic
prospects are improving,” said Khiem Do, Hong Kong-based head
of Asian multi-asset strategy at Baring Asset Management
Ltd.,which manages about $51 billion. “Around the world you
have prospects of improving economies and therefore improving
corporate earnings. The two largest economies are behaving in a
positive fashion, and Japan has announced a lot of policies that
are more reflationary.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index, which includes Japanese
companies, lost 0.3 percent to 131.3. The gauge rallied 10
percent from Nov. 14 through Jan. 25, as the announcement of
Japanese elections sparked optimism a new government would add
stimulus to fight deflation.  Relative Value  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index, the benchmark regional
equities gauge, traded at 14.3 times average estimated earnings
compared with 13.7 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 12.3
times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  slid 0.9 percent. The gauge on Jan. 25
capped an 11-week advance, the longest such streak since at
least 1970 as the yen weakened, boosting the earnings outlook
for exporters. Volume on the equity benchmark was about 7
percent lower than the 30-day intraday average.  “In the short-term, investors are looking at bad earnings
results as a reason to sell, especially as stocks rose a bit too
fast in such a short space of time,” said Masayuki Kubota, who
helps oversee the equivalent of $1.8 billion at Daiwa SB
Investments Ltd. in Tokyo. “I’m still optimistic about the
future of stocks.”  Outlook Boosted  Japan’s Cabinet Office today boosted its outlook for real
gross-domestic-product growth to 2.5 percent in the year to
March 31, 2014, up from a previous projection of 1.7 percent.  South Korea’s Kospi Index retreated 0.4 percent today even
after  consumer confidence  climbed to the highest level in eight
months as incoming President Park Geun Hye pledges to boost
economic growth and welfare spending.  South Korea’s won and the Taiwan dollar tumbled the most in
16 months against the dollar as the yen’s slide to a 2 1/2-year
low fanned speculation central banks will seek weaker exchange
rates to protect exports.  Samsung Electronics Co., the world’s largest maker of
smartphones, dropped 3.2 percent to 1.372 million won. The
company warned about a slowdown in global demand and said a
stronger won will cut operating profit this year.  Taiwan’s Taiex Index rose 0.6 percent. Singapore’s Straits
Times Index gained 0.2 percent, Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  rose
0.4 percent and China’s Shanghai Composite Index jumped 2.4
percent to its highest close since June 2012. Markets in
Australia are shut today.  China Profit  Chinese shares gained after mainland industrial companies’
profit rose 17 percent to 895 billion yuan ($144 billion) in
December from a year earlier, the  National Bureau of Statistics 
said yesterday in Beijing.  Cement companies rose in Hong Kong after Shenyin & Wanguo
said demand for the material may exceed expectations this year
on infrastructure investment, rising property sales and
urbanization. Anhui Conch advanced 3.5 percent to HK$29.75.
China National Building Material Co. increased 2.6 percent to
HK$12.06, while  China Shanshui Cement Group Ltd. (691)  gained 2.1
percent to HK$5.48.  China Coal Energy Co. advanced 1.2 percent to HK$8.62 in
Hong Kong. Sany Heavy Industry Co., a construction machinery
maker, rose 5.2 percent to 11.15  yuan  in Shanghai.  U.S. Shares  Futures on the S&P 500 were little changed today. The
measure gained 0.5 percent on Jan. 25 amid better-than-estimated
corporate earnings, rising an eighth day to cap its longest
winning streak since 2004.  Nintendo, which produces the Wii gaming console, jumped 3.4
percent to 9,630 yen in Osaka, while PlayStation 3 maker Sony
surged 9.1 percent to 1,407 yen in Tokyo. The companies climbed
after China Daily reported the nation is considering lifting a
ban on the manufacture, sale and import of game consoles that
has been in place since 2000, citing an unidentified government
official.  Korea Exchange Bank (004940)  advanced 6.3 percent to 7,790 won after
Hana Financial Group Inc. announced a buyout plan for the Seoul-
based lender. Hana gained 3.2 percent to 40,500 won.  Fanuc and  Hitachi High-Tech (8036)  dropped the most on the MSCI
Asia Pacific Index after cutting profit forecasts. Fanuc fell 7
percent to 13,550 yen in Tokyo after reducing its profit
forecast by 15 percent for the fiscal year, citing the strong
yen. Hitachi High-Tech tumbled 10 percent to 1,768 yen after
lowering its operating profit forecast 33 percent for the year.  China Cosco Holdings Co., the nation’s biggest shipping
company, fell 5.1 percent to HK$4.08 in Hong Kong, the  biggest
drag  on the MSCI Asia Pacific excluding Japan Index. The company
said it faces trading restrictions on its China shares amid a
forecast for a “significant” loss in 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
