Chinese stocks  climbed for the first
time in four days in New York, led by  Youku Tudou (YOKU)  Inc., as
rising industrial profits added to signs the world’s second-
largest economy is recovering.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. added 0.1 percent to 99.72 in New
York. Youku Tudou, owner of China’s most-used video websites,
jumped to a seven-month high after Deutsche Bank AG rated it a
new buy.  Qihoo 360 Technology Co. Ltd. (QIHU) , a Beijing-based Internet
software developer, dropped after saying that its applications
were removed from  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iTunes store.  Suntech Power
Holdings Co. (STP)  led a slump in solar stocks.  Net income for Chinese industrial companies increased 17.3
percent from a year earlier to 895 billion  yuan  ($144 billion)
in December, the National Bureau of Statistics said Jan. 27,
after a 22.8 percent jump in November. Earnings for the full
year gained 5.3 percent. The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  of
domestic Chinese shares rallied to the highest level since June.  “This industrial profits data is certainly favorable and
it’s one of several positive economic indicators that we’ve been
seeing lately coming out of China,”  Tim Ghriskey , chief
investment officer at Solaris Group LLC, which manages about $2
billion in assets including Chinese stocks, said yesterday by
phone in New York. “It’s certainly made us re-look our exposure
to China and we’re more inclined to increase it at this point.”  Youku Jumps  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the largest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., slipped 0.3 percent to $40.96,
extending last week’s 1.4 percent decline. The Standard & Poor’s

share in initiating coverage.  The stock has advanced 12 percent over the past six days,
its longest winning streak since December 2010. Youku’s 34
percent surge this year has made it the biggest gainer on the
Bloomberg China-US gauge, which has climbed 0.6 percent in 2013.  Baidu Inc. (BIDU) , owner of  China ’s most-used web search engine,
rose 3.1 percent to $111.39 in New York, the biggest jump in two
weeks. Baidu is preparing to start a real-time bidding platform,

Francisco yesterday.  Economic Growth  Industrial sector profits may grow by an average 30 percent

expect the incident to have any meaningful financial or
operational impact, Xu said. Apple spokesman  Tom Neumayr 
declined to comment on whether Qihoo’s apps had been removed
when contacted by phone.  Unfair Competition  Separately, Qihoo management was called in to the Beijing
