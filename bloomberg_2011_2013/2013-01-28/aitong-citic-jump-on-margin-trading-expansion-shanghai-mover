Haitong Securities Co. (600837)  led a rally
for brokerages in Shanghai on improved earnings prospects for
the industry after the government said it would allow more
stocks to be used for margin trading and short selling.  Haitong Securities, the nation’s second-biggest listed
brokerage, jumped the most in two weeks, rising 6.3 percent to
10.82  yuan  at 11:11 a.m. local time. Citic Securities Co., the
largest, surged 5.2 percent to 14.24 yuan. The financial gauge
in the CSI 300 index including brokerages rose 3.3 percent, the
most among 10 industrial groups, and headed for the highest
close since April 2011.  Shanghai will expand the number of stocks allowable for
margin trading and short selling to 300 from 180 currently,
according to a statement from the city’s stock exchange.
Shenzhen will increase the number to 200 from 98, its exchange
said in another statement. The changes will take effect Jan. 31.  “This will increase the commission earnings of
brokerages,” He Zongyan, an analyst at Shenyin & Wanguo
Securities Co., said in a phone interview from  Shanghai  today.
“Brokerages will also benefit from the boost in liquidity.”  Combined profits for  China ’s 114 brokerages fell 16 percent
in 2012 from a year earlier as revenues dropped 5 percent, He
Li, analyst at Essence Securities Co., wrote in a report on Jan.
