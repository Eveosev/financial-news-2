Copper advanced for the first time
in four days as data from  China , the world’s biggest consumer,
added to signs a rebound is gaining momentum and  Japan  raised
its economic outlook, boosting demand for industrial metals.  The metal for three-month delivery climbed as much as 0.5
percent to $8,070 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange and
was at $8,063 at by 4:31 p.m. in Tokyo. The price fell 0.4
percent last week. Futures for May delivery dropped 0.4 percent
to end at 58,620  yuan  ($9,418) a ton on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange.  Chinese industrial companies’ profits rose for a fourth
month in December, adding to signs the country’s economic
rebound is gaining momentum. Japan’s Cabinet Office said today
that real gross domestic product will be 2.5 percent in the year
to March 31, 2014, upgrading a previous 1.7 percent forecast.  “Economic data from China and Japan lent support to the
copper,” said Hwang Il Doo, a senior trader at  Korea Exchange
Bank (004940)  Futures Co. in Seoul. A drop in stockpiles in London and
Shanghai was also supportive for the market, he said.  Stockpiles of copper monitored by the LME fell 0.6 percent
to 342,900 tons, daily exchange figures showed on Jan. 25. That
capped a weekly drop, the first in eight. Inventories monitored
by the Shanghai Futures Exchange declined last week for the
second week to 205,120 tons, data from the bourse showed.  Economic reports later this week may show U.S. employers
added 160,000 workers to payrolls last month after a 155,000
December increase, while manufacturing is stabilizing, housing
is improving and consumers are more confident. The  Federal
Reserve  starts a policy meeting Jan. 29.  Futures for delivery in March rose 0.3 percent to $3.6625 a
pound on the Comex in  New York . On the LME, aluminum and lead
