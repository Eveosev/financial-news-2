Southern Copper Corp. (SCCO) , the largest
producer of the metal in Peru and Mexico, fell the most in
almost three months in  Lima  trading as analysts reduced their
ratings of the stock.  Southern Copper, a unit of Grupo Mexico SAB, declined 3.5
percent to $39.79 at 1 p.m. in Lima, the biggest one-day decline
on a closing basis since Nov. 6. The stock pared its gain to 11
percent over the past year.  BB&T Capital Markets lowered the stock to the equivalent of
sell from hold while JPMorgan Chase & Co. reduced it to hold
from buy.  “The stock was hurt by all these reports coming out at the
same time,” Edwin Paz, a Lima-based trader with Provalor SAB,
said today in a telephone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
