Tottenham said it reached an
agreement to bring German midfielder Lewis Holtby from Schalke
this month.  The soccer player agreed to come to north London at the end
of the season, but Spurs negotiated an early release, it said
today on its website. Terms of the pact weren’t released.  Holtby has scored four times in 27 matches for Schalke.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
