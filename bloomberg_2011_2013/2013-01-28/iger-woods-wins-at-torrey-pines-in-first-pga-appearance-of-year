Tiger Woods won the Farmers
Insurance Open by four shots in his first appearance this season
on golf’s U.S. PGA Tour.  Woods shot level-par 72 in the final round for a four-round
total of 14-under-par 274 at Torrey Pines in La Jolla,
 California . Defending champion Brandt Snedeker and Josh Teater
tied for second place at 10-under par.  The finish was delayed until today after fog wiped out play
on Jan. 26.  It’s the seventh time Woods, 37, has won the tournament,
while he also won the U.S. Open at Torrey Pines in 2008, the
last of his 14 major titles. Woods now has 75 career wins on the
PGA Tour, second to Sam Snead, who claimed 82 titles.  Woods said he’d play the Farmers Insurance Open the same
day Qatar Golf Association President Hassan al Nuaimi told
reporters Woods was “not worth” a $3 million appearance fee to
take part in the Qatar Masters, which  England ’s Chris Wood won
yesterday with an eagle at the final hole for his first European
Tour title.  The Farmers tournament begins with a round each on the
North and South courses at Torrey Pines, with the final 36 holes
taking place over the South course. The winner collects $1.1
million.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
