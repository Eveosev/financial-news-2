     Jan. 28 (Bloomberg) -- BlackRock Inc. and  PNC Financial
Services Group Inc. (PNC)  view collateralized loan obligations as
offering some of the best value in the credit markets after
securitized debt rallied last year.  “You can be pretty bullish across the entire  capital
structure ,” Leland Hart, a managing director at BlackRock, the
world’s largest asset manager, said today during a panel
discussion at the American Securitization Forum’s annual
conference in  Las Vegas .  Prices of CLOs, which are created by slicing speculative-
grade company loans into a series of new securities with varying
risks, have soared along with sales as depressed yields on
Treasuries and calming markets push investors to seek
potentially higher returns. Values of residential and commercial
mortgage securities have also gained.  CLOs still “are very cheap,” while some other securitized
debt is more dangerous, Gagan Singh, chief investment officer at
PNC’s bank unit, said. “This will be the year of sector
selection. Last year you wanted to be long risk.”  Bank of America Corp. forecasts as much as $75 billion of
CLO issuance this year. The first three weeks of the year were
more active than the first two months of 2012, when $3.1 billion
of funds were arranged, according to Bloomberg data. There were
$52.6 billion of deals backed by widely syndicated loans issued
in 2012.  “The limiting factor on CLO formation will actually be the
supply of loans,” Hart said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
