China  needs more stringent
requirements for approval of generic versions of  biologics ,
complex drugs made from living cells, to ensure their safety and
effectiveness, according to an industry report.  Generic copies of biological drugs can be registered as new
products in China with fewer testing requirements than originals,
according to the report, led by the  R&D-based Pharmaceutical
Association Committee . The industry group represents drugmakers
including  Roche Holding AG (ROG)  and  Pfizer Inc. (PFE)   “An abbreviated regulatory process with lower standards
poses significant risks on product safety and efficacy,”
according to the report, issued today in Beijing. “This
regulation framework is inconsistent with global norms and can
expose patients to unknown risk.”  China’s market for biologics is about 18 billion  yuan  ($2.9
billion), or 2 percent of the world’s total, according to the
committee. Globally, $25 billion worth of branded biologic drugs
will  lose patent protection  by 2016, facing competition from
biosimilars that may have a value of $19.4 billion by next year,
according to Dublin-based Research & Markets.  Merck KGaA (MRK)  agreed last June to develop lower-cost copies of
biotechnology cancer treatments with Indian partner  Dr. Reddy’s
Laboratories Ltd. (DRRD) , while Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH is planning
to test a generics version of Roche’s top-selling biological
drug Rituxan.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
