The pound fell for a third day
against the euro after Mark Carney, who will become governor of
the Bank of England in July, said central banks around the world
have room to ease monetary policy further if needed.  Sterling dropped to the weakest level in 13 months versus
the common currency after an industry report showed U.K.  home
prices  declined in January from a year earlier. Government data
last week showed gross domestic product shrank more than
economists forecast, tipping the nation back toward recession.
Inflation expectations climbed to the highest since June 2011 on
bets for more stimulus. Gilts fell for a third day.  “The market judges what Carney said as being dovish,”
said  Roberto Mialich , a currency strategist at UniCredit Global
Research in Milan. “Economic reports out of the U.K.,
especially the GDP data, have not looked very encouraging. The
pound is likely to remain under pressure.”  The pound depreciated 0.6 percent to 85.73 pence per euro
at 4:27 p.m. London time after declining to 85.76 pence, the
weakest since Dec. 7, 2011. The U.K. currency fell 0.7 percent
to $1.5686 after dropping to $1.5683, the lowest since Aug. 20.  Carney, currently governor of the Bank of Canada, said
policy in developed countries isn’t “maxed out” and central
bankers can be flexible in meeting inflation goals. The current
task of monetary policy is to ensure key economies “achieve
escape velocity,” Carney told the World Economic Forum’s annual
meeting on Jan. 26 in Davos, Switzerland.  House Prices  U.K.  house prices  dropped 0.3 percent in January from a
year earlier and were unchanged from the previous month,
property researcher Hometrack Ltd. said in a statement.  The pound has had the poorest start to a year versus the
euro since the single currency was introduced in 1999,
depreciating 5.1 percent since Dec. 31.  Sterling has weakened 3.4 percent this month, the second-
worst performer after the yen of 10 developed-market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro
strengthened 2.7 percent and the dollar gained 0.5 percent.  The 10-year  break-even rate , a gauge of annual inflation
expectations derived from the difference between yields on gilts
and inflation-linked securities, increased for a sixth day,
widening two basis points to 3.15 percentage points, the most
since June 2011.  The 30-year break-even rate also rose two basis points to
3.42 percentage points.  ‘Inflation Protection’  “It is understandable that inflation protection is in
demand when the incoming Bank of  England  governor signals he is
prepared for it to take some time for inflation to come back
down to target,” said Sam Hill, a fixed-income strategist at
Royal Bank of Canada in London.  Ten-year gilt  yields rose five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 2.10 percent. The 1.75 percent bond
maturing in September 2022 fell 0.395, or 3.95 pounds per 1,000-
pound face amount, to 96.95.  Short-sterling futures advanced as investors added to bets
that borrowing costs will stay lower for longer. The implied
yield on the December 2013 contract dropped two basis points to
0.58 percent.  The Debt Management Office plans to sell bonds maturing in
2044 through banks this week.  Gilts handed investors a loss of 1.7 percent this month
through Jan. 25, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and
the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German
bonds also dropped 1.7 percent and Treasuries fell 0.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
