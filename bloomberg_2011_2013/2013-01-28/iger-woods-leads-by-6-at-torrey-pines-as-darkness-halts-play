Tiger Woods  has a six-shot lead with
11 holes to play at the U.S.  PGA Tour ’s Farmers Insurance Open,
which he’s seeking to win for the seventh time.  After fog wiped out play two days ago at Torrey Pines in  La
Jolla , California, organizers sought to play the third and
fourth rounds yesterday. Woods finished seven holes in the final
round -- making three birdies to get to 17-under-par -- before
darkness halted play last night.  Woods, who is making his season debut on the PGA Tour, will
resume play today at 2:10 p.m.  New York  time. Woods will be
seeking a 75th PGA Tour title and to match his seven wins at
both the World Golf Championships-Bridgestone Invitational and
the Arnold Palmer Invitational.  “I’ve got to continue executing my game plan,” Woods said
at a news conference. “I’ve got 11 holes to play and I’ve got
to go out and play them well.”  The largest margin of victory at the Farmers Insurance Open
is eight shots by Woods in 2008, when he won the event for the
fourth straight year. He also won the tournament in 1999 and
2003 at Torrey Pines, which was the site of his U.S. Open
victory in 2008.  Defending champion Brandt Snedeker and  Nick Watney  are tied
for second at 11-under par.  To contact the reporter on this story:
