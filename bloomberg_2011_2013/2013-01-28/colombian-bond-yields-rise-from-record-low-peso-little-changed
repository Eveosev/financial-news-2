Colombia ’s peso bonds dropped for
the first time in seven days, pushing yields up from a record
low as traders pared bets on a cut in the target lending rate at
the central bank’s policy meeting today.  Yields on the government’s 10 percent peso-denominated debt
due in 2024 climbed one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point,
to 5.24 percent at 10:19 a.m. in Bogota, according to the
central bank. The price fell 0.117 centavo to 140.247 centavos
per peso. Yields dropped on Jan. 25 to 5.23 percent, the lowest
close since the securities were first issued in 2009.  “The market already has a rate cut today priced in, but
there’s always the possibility of a surprise,” said William Florez, a fixed-income strategist at Helm Bank SA’s brokerage in
Bogota. “There are always people who prefer to sell and take
the profit because of the fear.”  Yields have tumbled 42 basis points in January in what
would be their eighth monthly drop on speculation the central
bank will cut its 4.25 percent overnight lending rate at its
policy meeting today to support the nation’s economy.  Banco de la Republica  will lower its benchmark by a
quarter-percentage point, according to 31 of 33 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. The other two expect policy makers to
leave borrowing costs unchanged.  The peso was little changed at 1,780.67 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
