Earnings for the largest oil tankers
fell the most since 2008 last week amid slowing demand to
charter the vessels, said Clarkson Research Services Ltd.  Daily returns for very large crude carriers slumped 43
percent to $14,090, according to figures on the website of
Clarkson, a unit of the world’s largest shipbroker. The drop was
the biggest since Aug. 22, 2008, its data showed. Each of the
tankers can haul 2 million barrels of oil.  Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest crude exporter, cut daily
production by 300,000 barrels in December, Oslo-based investment
bank RS Platou Markets AS said today in an e-mailed report that
cited International Energy Agency data. VLCCs began losing money
on the benchmark voyage to Asia from the Middle East on Jan. 24,
assessments of returns by the Baltic Exchange in  London  showed.  “Chartering activity has the last week been reduced and
brokers say the February loading program is behind the normal
schedule,” Platou said. “This has led to more than 100 VLCCs
available to load in the Middle East Gulf over the next month,
the highest since October 2012.”  The exchange’s assessments fail to account for owners’
efforts to improve returns by securing cargoes for a voyage’s
return leg or by reducing speed to burn less fuel, known as
slow-steaming. The  price  of fuel, or bunkers, the industry’s
biggest expense, rose 0.9 percent to $632.04 a metric ton, the
highest level since Oct. 24, figures compiled by Bloomberg from
25 ports showed.  Spot Market  Daily earnings for single journeys, known as spot voyages,
slumped to $9,600 from $23,600 a week earlier, Sam Margolin, an
analyst at investment bank Dahlman Rose & Co. in New York, said
in an e-mailed report today.  The combined carrying capacity of the world VLCC fleet will
expand 5.3 percent this year, below demand growth of 6.3
percent, Clarkson data showed.  Daily losses for the tankers on the benchmark Saudi Arabia-
to-Japan voyage widened to $6,443 from $5,252 on Jan. 25, data
from the London-based Baltic Exchange showed. VLCCs earned money
in only four sessions in the third quarter on the journey.  Charter  rates  for VLCCs on the route, at the lowest level
since September 2009, slid 1.7 percent to 30.44 Worldscale
points, the exchange’s figures showed. The decline was the 11th
in a row.  The Worldscale system is a method for pricing oil cargoes
on thousands of trade routes. Each individual voyage’s flat
rate, expressed in dollars a ton, is set once a year. Today’s
level means hire costs on the benchmark route are 30.44 percent
of the nominal Worldscale rate for that voyage.  The Baltic Dirty Tanker Index, a broader measure of oil-
shipping costs that includes vessels smaller than VLCCs,
declined 1.4 percent to 637, according to the exchange. The
retreat was the biggest since Jan. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
