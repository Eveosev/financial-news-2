Brazil ’s real rallied, strengthening
beyond 2 per dollar for the first time since July, after the
central bank auctioned foreign-exchange swap contracts to shore
up the currency and contain inflation.  The real rallied 1.7 percent to 1.9955 per dollar at the
close in Sao Paulo, reversing an initial loss after the central
bank sold all $1.85 billion of contracts offered. The gain was
the biggest since June 29, pushing the currency to its strongest
level since July 2.  The intervention surprised traders, who had speculated that
the central bank would refrain from rolling over $1.8 billion of
currency swap contracts maturing Feb. 1, Joao Paulo de Gracia
Correa, the head of  currency trading  at Correparti Corretora,
said by phone from Curitiba, Brazil.  “The auction took everybody by surprise,” he said in a
telephone interview. “The central bank should leave the real at
this level in the short term to relieve inflation pressure.”  Policy makers swung in 2012 between selling currency swaps
to prevent the real from falling too quickly and offering
reverse currency swaps to protect exporters by keeping the real
from strengthening beyond 2 per dollar. The central bank sold
all 37,000 of currency swap contracts offered today.  Most swap rates on contracts expiring after October 2015
climbed as analysts raised their 2013 inflation estimate for a
fourth week, increasing pressure on policy makers to lift
borrowing costs.  Consumer prices will rise at an annual rate of 5.67 percent
in 2013, according to the median estimate in a central bank
survey of about 100 analysts published today. That compares with
a projection of 5.65 percent in the previous week.  Bank Minutes  The best policy for containing consumer price increases is
to keep the target rate at a record low for a “sufficiently
prolonged period,” the central bank reiterated in minutes of
its Jan. 15-16 meeting published last week.  Annual inflation has exceeded the 4.5 percent midpoint of
the central bank’s target range for 28 consecutive months. The
IPCA index of  consumer prices  rose 5.84 percent in December from
a year earlier after increasing 5.53 percent in the prior
period, the national statistics agency reported Jan. 10.  Economic growth slowed to 1 percent last year, the central
bank estimates, following expansion of 2.7 percent in 2011 and
7.5 percent in 2010.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2017 rose five
basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 8.81 percent, the
highest level on a closing basis since Nov. 22.  To contact the reporters on this story:
