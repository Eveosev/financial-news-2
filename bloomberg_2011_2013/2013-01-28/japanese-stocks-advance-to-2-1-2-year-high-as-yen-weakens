Japanese  shares  declined, with the
 Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average retreating after capping its longest
streak of weekly gains since 1970, as  Fanuc Corp. (6954)  and  Advantest
Corp. (6857)  led declines on earnings concerns.  Factory-robotics maker Fanuc sank 7 percent after lowering
its profit outlook. Advantest dropped 5.3 percent on a report
the world’s biggest maker of memory-chip testers will miss its
operating profit forecast. Toyota Motor Corp. lost 0.6 percent
even after reporting global sales rose last year. Nintendo Co.

 China Daily  newspaper said the country may lift a ban on imports
of game consoles.  The Nikkei 225 fell 0.9 percent to 10,824.31 at the close
of trading in Tokyo after earlier gaining 0.7 percent. The
measure capped an 11-week advance on Jan. 25, the longest such
streak in 43 years. The broader Topix Index, which is the most
sensitive to swings in the yen since at least 1994, fell 0.4
percent to 913.78.  “I’m still optimistic about the future of stocks,” said
 Masayuki Kubota , who oversees the equivalent of $1.8 billion at
Daiwa SB Investments Ltd. in Tokyo. “The yen is weakening as
policy makers take economic stimulus measures, U.S. economic
data is likely to be strong and  China’s economy  is recovering.
But in the short-term, investors are looking at bad earnings
results as a reason to sell, especially as stocks rose a bit too
fast in such a short space of time.”  The Topix has risen 27 percent since elections were
announced on Nov. 14 through Jan. 25 on optimism Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe’s new government will take the necessary steps to
fight deflation. The gauge is trading at 1.09 times book value,
compared with 2.07 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.16
for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  U.S. Stocks  Futures on the  S&P 500  rose 0.1 percent today. The measure
gained 0.5 percent on Jan. 25 amid better-than-estimated
corporate earnings, rising an eighth day to cap its longest
winning streak since 2004.  Fanuc sank 7 percent, the biggest decline on the Nikkei
225, after the company cut its operating profit forecast by 13
percent to 178 billion yen after export competitiveness was hurt
by the “superstrong” Japanese currency.  Advantest declined 5.3 percent, the second-biggest decline
on equity benchmark, after the Nikkei newspaper reported the
company is likely to miss its operating profit forecast due to
fewer orders from Apple Inc. suppliers and weaker PC demand.  Kansai Electric Drops  Also among shares that fell,  Kansai Electric  Power Co. lost
0.4 percent after broadcaster NHK reported that  Japan ’s nuclear
agency will warn that a fault under a Japan Atomic Power Co.
reactor may be active, with Kansai Electric holding a stake in
the utility.  For stocks that gained, console-maker Nintendo advanced 3.4
percent to 9,630 yen while PlayStation 3 manufacturer Sony
jumped 9.1 percent to 1,407 yen, the biggest support on the
Topix.  China  is considering lifting a ban on the manufacture,
sale and import of game consoles that has been in place since
the year 2000, China Daily reported, citing an unidentified
government official.  Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. gained 1.4 percent after winning
U.S. clearance for its alogliptin diabetes treatment.  The Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index rose 7.3 percent
