Nordex SE (NDX1) , a German wind-turbine
maker, agreed to furnish 50.4 megawatts of power equipment to
Akuo Energy SAS for a project in Uruguay.  The 24 turbines will be erected in Uruguay’s southern
region of Florida, 100 kilometers (62 miles) from the capital
city of Montevideo, Nordex said today in a statement.  Akuo Energy, a French renewable-energy developer, will sell
the wind farm’s electricity to state-run power company
Administracion Nacional de Usinas y Transmisiones Electricas for
20 years, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
