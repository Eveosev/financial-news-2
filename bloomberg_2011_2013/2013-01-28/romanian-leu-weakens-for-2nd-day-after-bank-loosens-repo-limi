The Romanian leu weakened for a
second day after the central bank increased the amount it offers
to commercial lenders at weekly repurchase-agreement auctions.  The currency depreciated 0.4 percent to 4.3873 per euro,
the lowest level on an intraday basis since Jan. 15, at 12:55
p.m. in Bucharest today. Yields on  Romania ’s July 2019 euro-
denominated bonds rose 2 basis points, or 0.02 percentage point,
to 3.85 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Banca Nationala a Romaniei loosened the funding cap to
9 billion lei ($2.8 billion) today from 6 billion lei a week
earlier, the central bank said today in its auction
announcement. The bank has restricted leu sales at its repo
auctions since October to help prop up the currency.  An International Monetary Fund mission will end a visit to
Bucharest tomorrow and will present its conclusions after
reviewing the country’s progress under a 5 billion-euro ($6.7
billion) precautionary agreement. Romanian Prime Minister Victor
Ponta said on Jan. 25 that he asked for an extension of the
loan, which expires at the end of March, until June to complete
“more structural reforms.”  The Romanian Finance Ministry also said on Jan. 25 that the
2012  budget deficit  totaled 14.8 billion lei, or 2.5 percent of
gross domestic product, above the target of 2.2 percent of GDP
agreed with the IMF.  To contact the reporter on this story:
