U.S. lawmakers said they doubt the
leadership of the National Football League Players Association
considers human growth hormone a problem and the organization’s
“remarkable recalcitrance” has blocked progress toward testing
for the drug.  In a letter sent today to union Executive Director
 DeMaurice Smith , the House Committee on Oversight and Government
Reform said it would go directly to the association’s members to
gauge their views on HGH use and testing.  The panel also asked for documents from the union,
including its most recent drug-testing proposal, by Feb. 8.  “The players association’s resistance to implementing an
HGH test has led us to question whether the NFLPA leaders
actually believe that HGH is a problem in the sport,” read the
letter, signed by committee Chairman  Darrell Issa , a Republican
from California, and the ranking Democrat,  Elijah Cummings  of
 Maryland .  The letter comes about two weeks after  Major League
Baseball  and its players union agreed on random, in-season blood
testing for HGH, a banned strength builder.  George Atallah, a spokesman for the NFLPA, said in a
telephone interview that the union intends to cooperate with the
panel.  “In the same way that members of Congress are
representatives of their constituents, this union takes its
direction from the players,” Atallah said. “If the committee
decides to hold a hearing, we look forward to participating. The
players have made all information on this topic available to the
NFL and to the committee.”  Test Limits  HGH is considered a performance-enhancing drug because of
its ability to grow muscle and aid recovery after training. It’s
not detectable in urine, unlike anabolic steroids.  The NFL and its union agreed in the collective bargaining
deal signed in 2011 to implement HGH testing.  Shortly after, the committee said in the letter, the union
questioned the reliability of the existing HGH test. The letter
said the  National Basketball Association  and its union have made
progress toward an agreement on HGH testing.  “Despite being the first of the major professional sports
leagues to agree to test for HGH, the NFL has now fallen far
behind its counterparts in implementing the agreement,” Issa
and Cummings said.  They cited the  Green Bay Packers ’ Jeff Saturday, a member
of the union’s executive committee; the  New York  Jets’  Antonio Cromartie ; and the Washington Redskins’ London Fletcher as
players who have called for HGH testing.  “We intend to take a more-active role to determine whether
the position you have taken -- that HGH is not a serious concern
and that the test for HGH is unreliable -- is consistent with
the beliefs of rank-and-file NFL players.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
