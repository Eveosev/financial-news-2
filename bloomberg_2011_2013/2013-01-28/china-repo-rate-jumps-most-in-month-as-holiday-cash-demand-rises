China ’s benchmark money-market rate
jumped the most this month amid speculation cash demand is
picking up before the Lunar New Year holiday.  The People’s Bank of China gauged demand for sales of
seven-day reverse-repurchase contracts this week, according to a
trader at a primary dealer required to bid at the auctions.
Money-market operations drained funds from the financial system
in each of the last four weeks. Demand for cash tends to climb
before the weeklong Lunar New Year break, which commences Feb.
11, and aggravates funding stress as families exchange gifts,
buy new clothes and get together for meals.  “Overall liquidity is getting a bit tighter with less
reverse repos and Chinese New Year getting closer,” said
Weisheng He, a Shanghai-based strategist at Citigroup Inc.
Still, increases in money rates may be limited as the central
bank is likely to step up cash infections, he said.  The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, climbed 30 basis points to 3 percent as of
10:21 a.m. in  Shanghai , according to a weighted average compiled
by the National Interbank Funding Center. That was the biggest
increase since Dec. 31.  The one-year interest-rate swap, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repo rate, increased one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.18 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. It reached 3.13 percent last week,
the lowest level since Nov. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
