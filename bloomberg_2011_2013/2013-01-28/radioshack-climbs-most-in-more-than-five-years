RadioShack Corp. (RSH) , the electronics
retailer seeking a new chief executive officer, climbed the most
in more than five years.  RadioShack advanced 22 percent to $3.22 at the close in  New
York , the biggest gain since July 7, 2006. The shares gained 14
percent Jan. 25.  RadioShack tumbled 78 percent last year as the company
posted three straight quarterly losses and suspended its
dividend. The company has been seeking a new chief executive
officer since September, when James Gooch stepped down and Chief
Financial Officer Dorvin Lively took on the additional duties of
interim CEO.  Bruce Bishop, a spokesman for the Fort Worth, Texas-based
company, didnâ€™t immediately return a telephone message and e-
mail seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
