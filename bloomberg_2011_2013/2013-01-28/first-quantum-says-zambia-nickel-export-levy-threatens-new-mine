First Quantum Minerals Ltd. (FQM) ,
Zambia’s biggest copper producer, wants the government to waive
a 10 percent levy on nickel-concentrate exports that the company
said threatens its newest mine.  If the duty remains, the economics of the Enterprise
project, located in the northwest of the country, are
“borderline,” Tristan Pascall, an assistant general manager at
the company, said on Jan. 25.  “To take nickel concentrate out of the country under the
current export-levy arrangements pretty much kills this
project,” he said in a speech at the Sentinel mine, almost 500
kilometers (311 miles) northwest of Lusaka, the capital.  Zambia,  Africa ’s biggest copper producer, introduced a 10
percent levy on the export of ore and concentrates in November
2011 as it sought to increase local value addition to mineral
products. The government waived the levy for the export of
manganese ore and concentrate in February last year.  The Enterprise operation, which will be the only nickel
producer in the country after Albidon Ltd. mothballed its Munali
mine in December, will produce 38,000 metric tons of the
stainless steel raw material annually in its first phase, the
company said on Dec. 12. Phase two could reach 60,000 tons
yearly. There are no nickel smelters in Zambia and the scale of
the mine  First Quantum (FM)  is building doesn’t justify constructing
one, according to John Gladston, resource optimization manager
for the Trident project, which incorporates the Sentinel and
Enterprise mines.  Nickel Decline  Together with a 38 percent increase to the initial
production rate First Quantum had planned at Sentinel,
Enterprise will cost $275 million, the company said on Dec. 12.  Nickel for delivery in three months has retreated 16
percent over the past year.  London  Metal Exchange stockpiles
rose to the highest since April 2010 last week. The corrosion-
resistant material climbed 1.3 percent to $17,860 pound by 4:28
p.m. in London. Copper slid 3.9 percent over the same period,
and gained 0.7 percent to $8,103.50 a pound.  First Quantum has a 60,000-ton stockpile of copper
concentrate worth $100 million at its Kansanshi mine, about 10
kilometers north of Solwezi, Operations Director Matt Pascall
said in a speech.  “We can’t export it because there is a 10 percent export
levy on concentrate,” he said. “We can’t treat it here because
the three smelters are chock-a-block, they can’t take another
ton of copper.”  Trident Project  First Quantum, which announced a $5.1 billion hostile bid
for  Inmet Mining Corp. (IMN)  on Dec. 16, is spending $2 billion on its
Trident project, which will help increase its Zambian copper
production to almost 700,000 tons yearly by 2015, said Matt
Pascall, who is chairman and Chief Executive Officer Philip Pascall’s brother. Tristan is Philip’s son.  The company is also spending $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion
on an expansion at Kansanshi, already Africa’s biggest copper
mine, Matt Pascall said. That includes a $650 million copper
smelter, and will lift the operation’s copper output by 60
percent from 2012 to 2015, he said.  The Zambian government has accused mining companies of
avoiding as much as $2 billion in taxes a year. Chileshe
Kandeta, spokesman for the Ministry of Finance, didn’t respond
to an e-mail and two phone calls seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
