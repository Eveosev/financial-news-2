Latvia  meets most euro-adoption
criteria and is poised to join the currency area as planned in
2014, the  International Monetary Fund  said.  The Baltic country already meets state-debt and budget-
deficit thresholds, the Washington-based lender said today in an
Article IV and staff report.  “Prospects for meeting the inflation and interest rates
are more uncertain, since these criteria depend on the EU
institutions’ determination of the countries to be used for the
reference value calculation,” the IMF said. Representatives
from the European Commission and  European Central Bank  “assured
the authorities the criteria would be applied fairly.”  Latvia agreed on a 7.5 billion-euro ($10.1 billion) bailout
in 2008 after its second-biggest bank needed a state rescue and
a real estate bubble burst. It kept its currency, the lats,
pegged to the euro even as the economy plunged by more than 20
percent in 2008-2009, the biggest collapse in output in the
world at the time.  Gross domestic product, which advanced 5.7 percent in the
first three quarters of 2012, may expand 3.7 percent this year,
before accelerating to about 4.2 percent in 2014-2015, the IMF
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
