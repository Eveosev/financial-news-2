U.K. farmers may plant 50 percent
more spring bean crops this year than in 2012 following wet
weather that prevented seeding last autumn, said Frontier
Agriculture Ltd.  The price premium commanded by beans over wheat will narrow
to about 35 pounds ($55) a metric ton, Frontier, a joint  venture 
of Cargill Inc. and Associated British Foods Plc, said today in
a  statement  on its website. The Witham St. Hughs, England-based
grain marketer said the area sown with winter beans probably
declined about 15 percent to 20 percent.  “Even at these levels, it’s a great starting point for
marketing the crop, especially when there are opportunities for
additional human-consumption premiums,” pulse trader Andy Bury
said in the statement. “Demand for human-consumption beans will
remain strong, providing we supply the right quality.”  Lower  price levels  may stimulate demand from livestock
producers, who might substitute domestic beans for more
expensive soybean meal, according to the report. Seed supplies
for both beans and peas will be tight in the U.K. in coming
months, Frontier said.  The company controls 25 percent of the nation’s grain
market and has an equal share of the seed market, according to
its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
