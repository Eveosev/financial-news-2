Analysts covering  Brazil  boosted
their forecast for 2013 inflation and cut their growth estimate
for the fourth straight week, as price pressures continue strong
even as the economy struggles to accelerate.  Brazil’s inflation in 2013 will accelerate to 5.67 percent,
according to the median estimate in a central bank survey of
about 100 analysts published today. The economists had forecast
5.65 percent the previous week. Gross domestic product will
expand 3.10 percent this year, the survey showed, down from 3.19
percent the previous week.  President  Dilma Rousseff ’s government has expanded measures
aimed at spurring activity in the world’s second-largest
emerging market after two years of declining growth. Increased
consumption driven by tax cuts and near record-low unemployment
has been overshadowed by falling investment and weak business
confidence.  Economic growth slowed to 1 percent last year, the central
bank estimates, following expansion of 2.7 percent in 2011 and
7.5 percent in 2010. Even so, annual  inflation  quickened to 6.02
percent through mid-January, the national statistics agency said
Jan. 23, and has exceeded the central bank’s 4.5 percent target
for the last 29 months.  Policy makers said on Jan. 24 that the balance of risks for
inflation has worsened in the short term and reiterated that the
best policy for bringing price increases to target is to keep
rates at a record low for a “sufficiently prolonged period.”  Economists in the survey maintained their prediction for
2014 inflation at 5.50 percent and boosted their growth estimate
to 3.65 percent from 3.60 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
