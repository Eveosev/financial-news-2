Gold futures retreated to a two-week
low amid signs that the global economy is improving, easing
pressure on central banks to announce more stimulus measures.  Chinese industrial companies’ profits rose for a fourth
month in December, the National Bureau of Statistics said
yesterday. Orders for U.S. durable goods climbed more than
forecast in December, a Commerce Department report showed today.
The  Federal Reserve  starts a two-day policy meeting tomorrow.
Bullion retreated to a four-month low on Jan. 4 after minutes of
a Fed meeting showed some policy makers favored ending $85
billion in monthly bond purchases this year.  “Gold is losing its safe-haven status as the global
economy is showing signs of improvement,”  Adam Klopfenstein , a
senior market strategist at Archer Financial Services Inc. in
Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “Some people are on the
sidelines waiting for the Fed’s decision.”  Gold futures for April delivery slid 0.2 percent to settle
at $1,655 an ounce at 1:41 p.m. on the Comex in New York, after
touching $1,653.20, the lowest for a most-active contract since
Jan. 11. Last week, prices slumped 1.7 percent, the biggest drop
in more than a month.  Trading volume in New York was 79 percent higher than the

$30.78 an ounce in New York, declining for the third straight
session.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
April delivery slumped 1.9 percent to $1,662.30 an ounce, the
biggest drop since Dec. 20.  Anglo American Platinum Ltd. (AMS) , the
world’s biggest producer of the metal, has put plans to cut as
many as 14,000 jobs in  South Africa  on hold for two months, the
 National Union of Mineworkers  said.  Palladium futures for March delivery fell 0.1 percent to
$740.55 an ounce on the Nymex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
