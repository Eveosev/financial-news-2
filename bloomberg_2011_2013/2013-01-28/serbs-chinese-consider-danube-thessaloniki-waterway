Serbia’s government and China
Gezhouba Group Corp. agreed to conduct a feasibility study for a
Balkan waterway that would connect the Danube with the Aegean
Sea on the Mediterranean.  The 655-kilometer waterway across Serbia, Macedonia and
Greece would link the Danube and the Morava rivers with Vardar
in Macedonia to form a commercial route leading to the Greek
port of Thessaloniki, the government said on its  website  after
the Natural Resources and Mining Minister Milan Bacevic signed
the memorandum of understanding with Gezhouba in Beijing.  The Chinese company will provide “expert support” for
geological and land surveys for the study, while financing
options may be considered later, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
