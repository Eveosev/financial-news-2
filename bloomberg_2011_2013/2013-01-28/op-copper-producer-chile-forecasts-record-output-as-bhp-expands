Chile , the world’s biggest copper-
producing nation, said output probably will reach a record high
this year as  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  ramps up supply and state-owned
Codelco starts a new mine in the Atacama Desert.  Production from mines rose 3.2 percent last year to 5.43
million metric tons from 5.26 million tons in 2011, Mining
Minister Hernan de Solminihac said in a presentation in Santiago
today. Output will rise 3 percent to 5.6 million tons this year,
exceeding a record 5.56 million tons set in 2007, and total 5.75
million tons in 2014, according to estimates released by the
government’s copper commission  Cochilco .  The commission left its average price estimate for this
year unchanged at $3.57 a pound, de Solminihac said. World
copper supply will exceed demand by 56,000 tons this year and
68,000 tons in 2014, he said.  Melbourne-based BHP will increase output by 20 percent this
fiscal year at its Escondida mine in Chile’s Atacama Desert, the
company said Jan. 23.  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  also boosted output at
its Los Bronces mine last year.  Codelco probably will boost supplies to 1.7 million tons
this year as it begins output at the Ministro Hales mine, Chief
Executive Officer Thomas Keller said Jan. 23 in an interview.  World copper supply will increase 3.3 percent this year,
while demand is set to grow 0.6 percent, according to the
government estimate.  Copper futures for delivery in March added less than 0.1
percent to $3.654 a pound at 10:39 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. Cochilco also predicted copper prices between 2002 and
2020 will average $2.65 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
