U.K.  house prices  stagnated in
January and the number of new buyers looking for homes fell as
concern over the euro-area debt crisis and the impact of the
government’s fiscal squeeze hit demand, Hometrack Ltd. said.  Prices in England and  Wales  were unchanged from December,
after declining for the previous six months, the property
researcher said in a statement today. The number of new buyers
registering with agents fell 9.9 percent from a month earlier,
while the number of properties listed for sale fell 6.8 percent.  A lack of houses and apartments for sale has supported
prices, offsetting the fall in demand. Data last week showed
Britain’s economy contracted more than forecast in the final
quarter of 2012, raising prospects of the first triple-dip
recession in its history.  “Fears over Europe, the economic outlook, the impact of
austerity, lower incomes growth and mortgage availability have,
over the last two years, weighed heavily on demand and kept
pricing under general downward pressure,”  Richard Donnell ,
director of research at London-based Hometrack, said in the
statement. “Housing demand remains sensitive to the impact of
external factors on  consumer confidence .”  On the year, house prices fell 0.3 percent, Hometrack said.
Still, 79 percent of real-estate agents surveyed were more
optimistic about the prospects for the U.K. housing market over
the next few months.  In  London , values rose 0.3 percent, as global uncertainty
boosted demand for homes in the center of the capital, Hometrack
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
