Wheat fell for the fourth time in
five sessions as rain from  Arkansas  to Ohio boosts prospects for
soft, red winter crops that are now in dormancy.  As much as a half-inch of rain (1.3 centimeters) fell in
parts of the region, improving subsoil moisture in areas where
the worst U.S. drought since the 1930s curbed crop prospects
last year, National Weather Service data show. Futures gained 19
percent last year.  “The improved moisture is expected to help out the
wheat,”  Brian Hoops , the president of Midwest Market Solutions
in Springfield, Missouri, said in a telephone interview. “It’s
too early to say it’s going to be a major benefit to the crop,
but it’s certainly not going to hurt.”  Wheat futures for March delivery slid 0.2 percent to $7.75
a bushel at 10 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade. The price
through Jan. 25 was down 0.2 percent this month.  In the U.S., wheat is the fourth-largest crop, valued at
$14.4 billion in 2011, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government
data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
