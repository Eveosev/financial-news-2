Australian and New Zealand bonds
tumbled, boosting their benchmark 10-year yields to the highest
in at least four months, as gains in Asian stocks sapped demand
for the relative safety of  government securities .  The so-called Aussie dollar rose against 14 of its 16 major
counterparts after data showed the nation’s business confidence
for December rebounded by the most in more than a decade. New
Zealand’s currency, nicknamed the kiwi, gained, snapping a
three-day drop against the greenback after the nation’s annual
trade deficit unexpectedly narrowed.  “The bond yields in  Australia  and New Zealand jumped quite
a bit,” said  Joseph Capurso , a currency strategist in Sydney at
 Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) , the nation’s largest lender.
“The global environment of higher bond yields, as well as a
rise in equity markets, is providing some support to the Aussie
and kiwi.”  Yields on Australia’s 10-year government bonds increased
nine basis points to 3.5 percent at 4:53 p.m. in Sydney, after
touching 3.51 percent, the most since Aug. 16. The comparable
rate in New Zealand jumped 10 basis points, or 0.1 percentage
point, to 3.66 percent, the highest since Sept. 19.  Australia’s dollar rose 0.4 percent to $1.0454 from the
close yesterday when it touched $1.0385, the least since Jan. 2.
It advanced 0.2 percent to 94.83 yen after earlier falling as
much as 0.5 percent.  New Zealand ’s dollar climbed 0.3 percent to
83.68 U.S. cents and rallied 0.2 percent to 75.91 yen.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of shares climbed 0.8 percent.  Confidence Jumps  National Australia Bank Ltd.’s confidence index, based on a
survey of more than 500 companies, rose to 3 from minus 9,
according to a report released today. The increase is the
biggest improvement in sentiment since October 2001. The
business conditions gauge, a measure of hiring, sales and
profits, improved to minus 4 from a revised minus 6.  “It is likely that much of the change in sentiment was a
result of improvements in financial and equity markets,” NAB
Chief Economist  Alan Oster  said in the report. “Whether this
feeling of relative optimism will be sustained into the New Year
remains to be seen.”  In New Zealand, imports exceeded exports by NZ$1.21 billion
($1 billion) in 2012, compared with a revised NZ$1.39 billion
shortfall in the year through November, the statistics office in
Wellington said today. Economists expected a NZ$1.87 billion
gap, according to the median of seven forecasts in a Bloomberg
News survey.  Prime Minister John Key said New Zealand’s exchange rate is
high and the outlook for economic growth remains strong. He
spoke at the start of a parliament session today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
