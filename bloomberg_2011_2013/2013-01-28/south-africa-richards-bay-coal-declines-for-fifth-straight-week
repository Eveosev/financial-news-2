Coal export prices at  South Africa ’s
 Richards Bay , the continent’s biggest terminal for shipping the
fuel, declined for a fifth straight week.  Coal for  immediate delivery  fell 66 cents, or 0.8 percent,
in the week to Jan. 25 to $84.84 a metric ton, according to IHS
McCloskey data on Bloomberg. That’s the longest streak of weekly
drops since June.  The fuel is quoted on a free-on-board basis, which excludes
delivery costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
