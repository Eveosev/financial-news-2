Fitch Ratings  said the temporary
suspension of the  U.S. debt  limit removes the near-term risk to
the nation’s AAA credit rating.  Agreement on a credible medium-term  deficit reduction  plan
consistent with sustaining the economic recovery would likely
result in the affirmation of the rating and revision of the
outlook to stable from negative, Fitch said in a statement. In
the absence of such a plan, the negative outlook would likely be
resolved with a downgrade later in 2013.  Fitch had previously said that failure to increase the debt
ceiling in a timely manner would prompt a review of the U.S.
sovereign rating. Congress broke an impasse on Jan. 2 on how to
avert the so-called fiscal cliff by passing legislation skirting
income-tax increases for more than 99 percent of households. The
U.S. House of Representatives voted on Jan. 23 to temporarily
suspend the nation’s borrowing limit.  “This is definitely helpful for  market sentiment ,” Sireen Harajli, a foreign-exchange strategist in  New York  at Credit
Agricole SA, said in a telephone interview. “It seems that
markets are looking for a decent gain.”  Benchmark 10-year  yields  were little changed at 1.95
percent as of 7:23 6:56 a.m. New York time, according to
Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The price of the 1.625
percent security due in November 2022 fell 2/32, or 63 cents per
$1,000 face amount, to 97 1/32.  To contact the reporter on this story:
