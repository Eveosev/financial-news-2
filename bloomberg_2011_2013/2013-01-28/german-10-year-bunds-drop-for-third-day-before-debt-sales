Italian 10-year bonds fell for the
first time in five days after data showed  consumer confidence  in
the country declined this month to the lowest in more than 15
years, undermining demand for the nation’s assets.  Italy’s two-year notes fell for an eighth day as it sold
6.63 billion euros ($8.92 billion) of debt. Yields on the
nation’s  10-year bonds  climbed after falling to the lowest level
in more than two years last week. Italy is due to hold elections
on Feb. 24-25, and its central bank cut its 2013 growth estimate
this month. German bunds dropped as the region’s biggest economy
sold 2.07 billion euros of 12-month bills at a positive yield
for the first time in seven months.  “There are some jitters surrounding  Italy ,” said
Christian Lenk, a fixed-income analyst at DZ Bank AG in
 Frankfurt . “The stories surrounding the election are adding
political pressure and might be weighing on the bonds.”  Italy’s 10-year bond yields climbed eight basis points, or
0.08 percentage point, to 4.21 percent at 4:45 p.m. London time,
after falling to 4.07 percent on Jan. 25, the lowest level since
November 2010. The 5.5 percent security maturing in November
2022 fell 0.685, or 6.85 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to
110.57. Two-year note yields advanced eight basis points to 1.57
percent.  Italy’s confidence index dropped to 84.6, the lowest since
the series began in 1996, from 85.7 percent in December, the
Italian statistics office Istat said in  Rome  today. Economists
had predicted an increase to 86, according to the median of 12
forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey.  Italian Growth  Italian GDP will probably contract 1 percent this year, the
Bank of Italy said on Jan. 18 in its economic bulletin. That
compares with a July estimate of a 0.2 percent reduction.  Italy sold 4 billion euros of zero-coupon notes maturing in
December 2014 and 2.63 billion euros of inflation-linked bonds
due in 2018.  Germany ’s 10-year yield climbed six basis points to 1.70
percent, after reaching 1.71 percent, the highest level since
Sept. 17.  Germany sold 12-month securities at an average yield of
0.1319 percent, the Bundesbank said in a statement today. That’s
the  highest auction yield  since October 2011, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Two-year German note yields rose above the rate on similar-
maturity U.S. securities for the first time since February 2012.
Two-year German yields were 0.30 percent, while U.S. rates were
0.29 percent.  LTRO Repayments  The German  note  yields earlier jumped to a 10-month high of
0.32 percent, extending an increase last week after the European
Central Bank said lenders planned to repay more loans borrowed
under the credit-boosting Longer-Term Refinancing Operations
than analysts estimated.  While measures to stem the region’s debt turmoil have
helped reduce Italy’s 10-year bond yields by more than 300 basis
points from their 2012 high, the ECB predicts the currency
bloc’s economy will shrink 0.3 percent this year. ECB President
Mario Draghi said last week that the “jury is still out” on
whether investor optimism can be reflected in economic momentum.  “There is a lot of focus on the LTRO and the repayments
and that should continue to influence the market this week,”
said Niels From, chief analyst at Nordea Bank AB in Copenhagen.
“Things in the euro-region appear to be improving but we need
to see it confirmed in the economic data.”  Yield Spread  Investors should buy Spanish two-year notes or 10-year
bonds while selling similar-maturity Italian debt, betting the
yield difference, or spread, between the two securities will
narrow, interest-rate strategists at Citigroup, including
London-based Robert Crossley, wrote in a Jan. 25 note to
clients.  “We expect the hunt for yield and fear of underperformance
of peers to drive the risk-on move further, and by extension,
benefit higher-yielding Spanish bonds more than their Italian
counterparts,” they wrote.  Spanish 10-year bonds  yielded  104 basis points more than
similar-maturity Italian securities today, compared with an
average of 10 basis points less over the past five years,
according to closing-price data compiled by Bloomberg.  Volatility on Finnish bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today, followed by those of the Netherlands and  Austria ,
according to measures of 10-year or similar-maturity debt, the
yield spread between two- and 10-year securities, and credit-
default swaps.  German bunds handed investors a loss of 1.7 percent this
month through Jan. 25, according to indexes compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. French bonds dropped 1.5 percent and Italian
securities returned 2.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
