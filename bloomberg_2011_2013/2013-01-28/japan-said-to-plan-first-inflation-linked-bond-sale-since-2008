Japan  plans to sell its first
inflation-lined bonds in almost five years after it stopped
offering the securities amid a lack of demand.  The Ministry of Finance will seek to sell several hundred
billion yen of inflation-linked debt in the fiscal year starting
in April, according to two government officials speaking on
condition of anonymity due to the government’s policy.  A majority of institutional investors said they aren’t
considering buying the so-called linkers, ministry officials
told reporters in Tokyo on Jan. 22 after a meeting with bond
dealers. Some primary dealers, those obliged to bid at the
government auctions, suggested the resumption of sales should be
delayed until the second half of the fiscal year.  Barclays Capital analyst Chotaro Morita said in note today
that he anticipates that the ministry will sell the debt as
early as July-to-September this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
