Wheat sowing in  Canada , set to be
the world’s third-largest shipper, will probably expand as much
as 10 percent this year spurred by a rally in prices, according
to the nation’s wheat board.  Area may rise 5 percent to 10 percent from 9.63 million
hectares (23.8 million acres) last year, as growers switch to
wheat from less profitable crops including oilseeds and rye,
said Bruce Burnett, a weather and crop surveillance specialist
at the Canadian Wheat Board, which monopolized the country’s
exports for 70 years until a new  law  was enforced in 2012.  Rising production in Canada may help ease supply concerns
after global  inventories  declined for a third straight year as
dry weather from Australia to  Russia  shriveled crops. A
persistent drought in the U.S. threatens to curb the 2013-2014
harvest in the world’s largest shipper, with the winter-crop
already in its  worst  condition when it became dormant in
November since at least 1985. Futures soared 19 percent last
year, reaching a four-year high of $9.4725 a bushel in July.  “Farmers are optimistic about next year,” said Burnett,
who has been tracking weather conditions and crop outlook in
Canada for 22 years, referring to the 2013-2014 marketing year
beginning Aug. 1. “Prospects for prices look reasonably good
for farmers,” he said in an interview from Winnipeg Jan. 25.  Wheat for March delivery gained 0.7 percent to $7.8225 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade at 4:35 p.m. Singapore
time. That takes the gain for the most-active contract in the
past 12 months to 21 percent.  Locking in Prices  “A lot of the farmers are going to lock in those prices
for a portion of their crop,” Blair Rutter, an executive
director of  Western Canadian Wheat Growers Association , said by
phone from Winnipeg on Jan. 25. “It wouldn’t surprise me to see
a 10 percent increase in spring-wheat planting.”  Last year’s spring-wheat planting reached 6.85 million
hectares, representing 71 percent of total areas seeded to
wheat, including the winter-crop and durum variety, Statistics
Canada data showed. Harvests of all varieties reached 27.2
million tons in the 2012-2013 marketing year, the Ottawa-based
agency said.  The Prairies will probably have near to above normal
precipitation through the rest of the winter-season, boosting
soil moisture for the spring planting season,  Bryce Anderson , an
agricultural meteorologist at DTN, said in an e-mail on Jan. 25
from Omaha,  Nebraska .  Farmers seeded 902,000 hectares with winter-wheat last
fall, for harvest in the year beginning Aug. 1, according to
 Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada . The harvest may rise to 3.79
million tons from 3.73 million tons in 2012-2013 marketing year,
Patrick Girard, media relations officer at the agriculture
ministry, said in an e-mail, citing a government forecast.  Canada was the largest exporter after the U.S. until 2008,
according to World Trade Organization data based on calendar
year. The country may sell 18.5 million tons in the global trade
year ending June 30, making it the largest shipper after the
U.S. and  Australia , U.S. Department of Agriculture data showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
