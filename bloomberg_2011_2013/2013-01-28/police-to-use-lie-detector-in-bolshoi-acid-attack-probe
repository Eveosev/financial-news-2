Russian police will use a lie
detector when questioning witnesses as they investigate an acid
attack on the Bolshoi Theater’s artistic director,  Sergei Filin .  Several people will undergo polygraph tests, a spokesman
for the Moscow police said by phone today. Investigators spoke
last week with the Bolshoi ballet’s principal dancer,  Nikolai
Tsiskaridze , as well as other employees of the theater and
Filin’s relatives and acquaintances.  Filin, a former star dancer at the ballet company, was
attacked with acid outside his home in the Russian capital on
Jan. 17. His face and eyes were damaged during the assault that
police and colleagues said may be linked to his work.  After several operations, doctors have managed to save
Filin’s eyesight, the Interfax news service reported, citing the
country’s chief ophthalmologist, Vladimir Neroyev. The Bolshoi
artistic director can see well for a person who has undergone
such a trauma, Neroyev said, according to Interfax.  Filin said in an  interview  with NTV television broadcast
yesterday that he forgave whoever carried out the attack.  To contact the reporter on this story:
