Taiwan financial shares rose the
most in almost two weeks after the island’s central bank relaxed
rules on yuan deposits and loans.  Cathay Financial Holding Co. (2882) , Taiwan’s biggest lender by
market capitalization, rose 1.3 percent to NT$32.55 as of 11:15
a.m. in Taipei, the highest in more than three months.  Mega
Financial Holding Co. (2886) , the island’s third biggest lender by
market value, advanced as much as 1.5 percent. The Taiwan Stock
Exchange Financial and Insurance Industry  index  advanced as much
as 1.4 percent, the biggest intraday gain since Jan. 10.  Taiwan’s central bank said Jan. 25 that banks will be
allowed to take yuan deposits and make loans in the currency by
the Lunar New Year. China, Taiwan’s biggest trading partner, is
seeking to facilitate greater use of the currency across the
Taiwan Strait and enlarge the  yuan ’s role in global finance.  “The central bank’s announcement on Friday on yuan
business helped bolster sentiment toward local financial
stocks,” said Sam Hsieh, a Taipei-based fund manager at Fuh Hwa
Securities Investment Trust Co. “Local banks will benefit from
handling fees and interest spreads from yuan deposits and
loans.”  Under the new rules, individuals would be allowed to
deposit as much as 20,000 yuan ($3,200) a day in accounts with
local banks and that lenders will be able to conduct yuan
business. A cross-strait agreement to facilitate use of the yuan
in Taiwan was signed by the two governments in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
