Reopening the U.S. mortgage
securitization pipeline is a vital step toward a housing market
recovery that will boost the wider economy, Comptroller of the
Currency  Thomas Curry  said today in a Las Vegas speech.  “Underwriting standards will need to find a new
equilibrium of risk and reward for a sustainable mortgage
market,” Curry said in remarks prepared for an American
Securitization Forum conference. “Getting the securitization
pipeline flowing again is a critical component in turning this
picture around.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
