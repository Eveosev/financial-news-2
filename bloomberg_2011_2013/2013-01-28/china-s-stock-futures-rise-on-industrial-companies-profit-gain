China’s stocks  rose, driving the
benchmark index to the highest level in seven months, after
industrial profits climbed for a fourth month in December.  Sany Heavy Industry Co. led a rally for heavy machinery
stocks after a report showed industrial companies’ net income
increased 17.3 percent last month. Citic Securities Co. advanced
to the highest level since April 2011 after regulators expanded
the number of stocks allowed for margin trading and short
selling. Kweichow Moutai Co., the biggest maker of baijiu
liquor, dropped the most in seven weeks after Credit Suisse
Group AG cut the stock to neutral.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  rose 2.4 percent to 2,346.51,
the highest close since June 1. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  climbed 3.1
percent to 2,651.86. The  Shanghai  index has risen 19.7 percent
since approaching a near four-year low on Dec. 3 amid signs of
an economic recovery. The CSI 300 rallied 26 percent.  “Industrial company profits are fueling gains for the
index,” Huang Cendong, an analyst at Tebon Securities Co., said
from Shanghai by phone today. “In the longer term, we expect
Chinese stocks to rally as company earnings in general will be
better this year.”  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  added 0.7 percent.
The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN)  lost 0.9 percent in  New York  on
Jan. 25. Average trading volumes in the Shanghai index were 3.9
percent higher than the 30-day average. The 30-day  volatility 
was at 20.6 on Jan. 25, compared with last year’s average of
17.1. The index trades at 10.1 times estimated earnings,
compared with 10.9 for the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index.  Industrial Profit  Industrial companies’ net income increased in December from
a year earlier to 895 billion yuan ($144 billion), the National
Bureau of Statistics said yesterday, after a 22.8 percent jump
in November. Earnings for the full year gained 5.3 percent.  The “earnings data bode well for  China ’s listed companies’
earnings to be released in coming weeks,” Lu Ting, China
economist at Bank of America Corp. wrote in a note to clients.
“We expect the NBS industrial earnings growth to peak in the
first half of 2013 at around 25 percent.”  A gauge of industrial companies in the CSI 300 rose 2.8
percent, the most in two weeks. Sany Heavy, the biggest maker of
construction machinery, jumped 5.2 percent to 11.15  yuan .
Zoomlion Heavy Industry Science & Technology Co., the second
largest, added 3.7 percent to 9.24 yuan.  The CSI 300 Financial Index rose 4.8 percent, the highest
close since April 2011. Citic Securities, the largest-listed
brokerage, jumped 5.9 percent to 14.34 yuan. Haitong Securities
Co., the second-biggest, rose 8.2 percent to 11.01 yuan.  Margin Trading  Shanghai will expand the number of stocks allowable for
margin trading and short selling to 300 from Jan. 31, according
to a statement from the city’s stock exchange. Shanghai
currently allows 180 stocks for margin trading and short
selling. Shenzhen will increase the number to 200 from 98, that
city’s stock exchange said in another statement.  “This will increase the commission earnings of
brokerages,” He Zongyan, an analyst at Shenyin & Wanguo
Securities Co., said in a phone interview from Shanghai today.
“Brokerages will also benefit from the boost in liquidity.”  Moutai (600519)  led a decline for consumer-staples producers,
sliding 5.6 percent to 178.50 yuan after its stock rating was
cut from outperform at Credit Suisse. Volume growth for “high-
end” Moutai producers may drop 3 percent this year, Credit
Suisse said in a report dated today. Wuliange Yibin Co., the
second-biggest maker of baijiu after Moutai, slumped 2.5 percent
to 24.49 yuan.  -- Editors: Allen Wan, Chan Tien Hin  To contact the reporter on this story:
