Iranian officials have detained 11
local journalists on charges of collaborating with foreign
media, state-run news agencies reported.  The journalists, who worked for newspapers including Arman,
Etemaad, Bahar, Shargh and the Iranian Labour News Agency, were
arrested yesterday afternoon at their workplaces,  the  Mehr  news
agency said. They are accused of cooperating with Farsi-language
media based abroad, Mehr said.  Iran’s judiciary will soon issue a statement on the matter,
it added. News of the arrest was confirmed by the publisher of
the Etemaad daily, Elias Hazrati, as well as a number of other
journalists on the news desks of the other newspapers, Mehr
said.  Iranian authorities often accuse western-based media of
seeking to destabilize the Islamic Republic by publishing
negative reports about the government. Officials are also
sensitive to Farsi-language media such as BBC Farsi which
attract a large local audience.  It isn’t unusual for Iranian authorities to crack down on
the press in the period before elections. Iranians will vote on
June 14. to determine who will succeed outgoing President
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Some 45 journalists are behind bars in
 Iran , according to a December report by the  Committee to Protect
Journalists.   To contact the reporter on this story:
