Offshore wind power installations in
Europe rose by a third in 2012 and may increase by another 20
percent this year as developers build bigger farms in deeper
waters, the European Wind Energy Association said.  Siemens AG (SIE)  had the biggest share of the market, with the
Munich-based conglomerate taking 74 percent of installations,
according to a  report  on the EWEA website.  Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL) ’s
Repower unit was second with 19 percent, while Bard Holding GmbH
had the rest of the market.  The 1,166 megawatts of installations is a 33-percent
increase on 2011’s 874 megawatts. The Brussels-based lobby group
said European Union nations lag goals in the National Renewable
Energy Action Plans they submitted to the EU. Total
installations across Europe reached 4,995 megawatts, less than
the goal of 5,829 megawatts through 2012 set by eight nations.  “Solid installation figures do not alter the fact that the
wind industry is being hit by political and regulatory
instability, the economic crisis, the higher cost of capital and
austerity,” Justin Wilkes, political director of the industry
group, said in the statement.  A further 14 projects that are being built will boost
offshore wind capacity by 3,300 megawatts when completed, EWEA
said. The average size of an offshore farm rose 36 percent to
271 megawatts, it said.  Bigger, Deeper  “The trend towards larger projects is expected to continue
over the coming years,” EWEA said. “Both average water depth
and distance to shore are expected to increase.”  EWEA forecasts grid connections to total 1,400 megawatts
this year, and 1,900 megawatts in 2014. Grid connection delays
in  Germany , political in-fighting over electricity market reform
in the U.K. and environmental constraints in Belgium have held
projects back.  The report showed Belgium, Germany and Ireland are all
undershooting their planned targets by more than 20 percent,
with France so far failing to install any turbines. The U.K.,
 Sweden  and  Denmark  are all ahead of plans.  The U.K. led installations in 2012, with 234 of the 293 new
turbines, totaling 854 megawatts, EWEA said. Belgium, Germany
and Denmark were the other three nations to install turbines at
sea, connecting 185 megawatts, 80 megawatts and 47 megawatts
respectively, according to EWEA.  European Wind  A total of 10 European nations now have 1,662  wind turbines 
connected in 55 farms at sea, totaling 4,995 megawatts,
according to the report. The U.K. has 59 percent of that,
followed by Denmark, with 18 percent, Belgium with 8 percent,
Germany with 6 percent and the Netherlands with 5 percent.
Sweden,  Finland , Ireland,  Norway  and  Portugal  are the other five
countries with offshore wind power in Europe.  Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) , the second-biggest historical
offshore wind turbine provider, had no new installations at sea
in 2012, after putting up just one experimental device in 2011,
according to the EWEA. Siemens now has 58 percent of installed
offshore wind capacity in Europe, Vestas has 28 percent and
Repower has 8 percent.  Aarhus, Denmark-based Vestas is developing an 8-megawatt
device called the V164 that it says it will only make to order.
The manufacturer has said it’s seeking a partner to help develop
the turbine, and in August said it’s in talks for a “strategic
cooperation” with  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd (7011) , without
specifying the nature of the discussions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
