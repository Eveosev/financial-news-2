Merial Ltd., an animal-health
products unit of Sanofi,  France ’s largest drugmaker, was sued by
Horizon Valley Generics Inc., which asked for a ruling that it
doesn’t violate Merial’s patent for  Frontline  flea and tick
control products for pets.  HVG and its Libourne, France-based parent, Ceva Sante
Animale SA, are asking a judge to find Merial’s patent covering
the fipronil-based treatment is invalid, according to a
complaint filed today in federal court in Wilmington,  Delaware .  HVG and Ceva Sante have asked for a jury trial to allow
them to market a generic alternative in the U.S. in the near
future. The companies said in court papers they are initiating
the lawsuit against Duluth, Georgia-based Merial because of
track record of aggressive litigation against competitors.  Merial has litigated “its fipronil-related patent rights
to stop perceived competitors from bringing to market, or even
attempting to develop, products that could potentially compete
with its Frontline series of products,” HVG lawyers said in the
lawsuit. Merial has brought at least five separate lawsuits
claiming infringement of the fipronil-based patent in the last
several years, according to court filings.  Jack Cox, a spokesman for  Sanofi (SAN) , didn’t immediately return
a phone call and e-mail message seeking comment on the lawsuit.  The case is Horizon Valley Generics Inc. v. Merial Ltd.,
U.S. District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To see the patent, click: 6,096,329.  To contact the reporter on this story:
