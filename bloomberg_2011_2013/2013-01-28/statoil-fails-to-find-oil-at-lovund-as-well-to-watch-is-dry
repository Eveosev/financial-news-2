Statoil ASA (STL) , Norway’s biggest oil
and gas producer, failed to find petroleum at the Lovund
prospect in the Norwegian Sea after saying last year it was a
“well to watch.”  The exploration well, the first at license 386, will be
abandoned, the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate said today in a
 statement  on its website. The prospect, in the Helgeland Basin
northwest of Trondheim, was drilled to a depth of 2,988 meters
(9,800 feet) below the sea.  Statoil is seeking new finds to counter falling output at
aging deposits and increase production by a quarter to 2.5
million barrels of oil equivalent a day in 2020. In November,
the Stavanger-based company  included  Lovund on its “wells to
watch” list for 2013, together with the Lupin prospect in the
North Sea and Apollo in the Barents Sea.  “It’s a little disappointing,” Ole-Jacob Storvik, an
analyst at Fearnley Securities AS in Oslo, said in a telephone
interview from Oslo. “But they’ve had a very good exploration
year in 2012, both in Norway and internationally.”  Statoil, two-thirds owned by the Norwegian state, operates
about 80 percent of the country’s oil and gas production. It
made two “high-impact” discoveries off Norway last year, which
are defined as holding more than 250 million barrels of oil
equivalent or 100 million barrels net for Statoil.  Statoil fell as much as 1.2 percent to 144.8 kroner in Oslo
trading, and was at 145 kroner as of 12:04 p.m. local time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
