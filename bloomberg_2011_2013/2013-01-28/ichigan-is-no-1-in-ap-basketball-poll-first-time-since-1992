The  University of Michigan  is ranked
No. 1 in the Associated Press Top 25 men’s college basketball
poll for the first in 21 years.  The Wolverines (19-1) received 51 of the 65 first-place
votes from a national panel of media members to move up from No.
2. The University of  Kansas  (18-1) received 13 first-place votes
and is ranked second, with the final vote going to No. 4 Florida
(16-2).  Duke University (17-2) fell to No. 5 from No. 1 after
losing 90-63 to Miami on Jan. 23, the school’s worst loss in 23
years. Indiana (18-2), the top-ranked team in the preseason, is
third.  Syracuse (18-2) is No. 6 in the poll, followed by Gonzaga
(19-2) and  Arizona  (17-2). Butler (17-3) and Oregon (18-2)
complete the Top 10.  Michigan , led by guard Trey Burke’s 17.9 points per game,
and Kansas are the only one-loss teams in the National
Collegiate Athletic Conference’s top division. The Wolverines
last held the AP poll’s top spot at the start of the 1992-93
season, the sophomore campaign for Chris Webber, Jalen Rose,
Jimmy King, Ray Jackson and Juwan Howard, a group known at the
“Fab Five.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
