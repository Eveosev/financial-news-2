U.S. stocks  fell, following the longest rally for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index since 2004, as a drop in pending home sales overshadowed a rise in durable- goods orders while investors watched earnings.  AK Steel  Holding Corp. lost 7.4 percent after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. downgraded the shares. Caterpillar Inc. added 2 percent as it forecast faster growth in the year’s second half.  Facebook Inc.

It would take a lot to really convince everyone that happy days are here, and we can just ride this off into the sunset.”  The index of contracts for the purchase of previously owned homes fell 4.3 percent to 101.7 in December after a revised 1.6 percent increase in November, the National Association of Realtors reported today.

The S&P 500 is about 4.2 percent below its all-time high of 1,565.15 set in October 2007.  ‘Earnings Numbers’  “The earnings numbers at this point really have to come through and validate where the market is,”  Mark Freeman , who oversees about $14 billion as chief investment officer at Westwood Holdings Group Inc. in  Dallas , said in a phone interview. “The market wants to see the numbers, if you will.”  The S&P 500 has rallied 5.2 percent this month for the best start of a year since 1987.
