Air France-KLM (AF) ,  Europe ’s biggest
airline, said it will create a regional travel subsidiary as it
seeks to regain market share from low-cost competitors on short
and medium-haul destinations.  The division, a fully-owned subsidiary of the carrier’s
main French unit, will be called HOP!, operate a fleet of 98
aircraft and offer 530 daily flights, the company said at a
press conference in Paris today.  “HOP! aims to become the reference airline on inter-
regional routes in France and Europe with a competitive offer,
quickly adaptable to market changes and competition, for
business or leisure travel,” Air France said in a statement.  Air France is following other airlines such as  Deutsche
Lufthansa AG (LHA)  in creating a discount short-haul subsidiary as
established carriers feel the squeeze from no-frills
competitors. The Hop! offering would also help Air  France  feed
passengers into the Paris-Charles de Gaulle hub for long-haul
routes.  The regional airline would seek to reach break even by 2014
or 2015, and will garner as much as 900 million euros ($1.21
billion) in revenue initially, on a loss of as much as 30
million euros, the company said.  The airline said Jan. 7 that it would introduce a discount
fare on short-haul routes from France, in a push to stem the
loss of market share. The reduced fare, branded MiNi and
available on 58 routes from Feb. 6, will exclude rights to air
miles and free hold baggage, according to Air France.  To contact the reporter on this story:
