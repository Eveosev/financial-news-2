Siemens AG (SIE)  has chosen  Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS)  to advise on the sale of its water technologies unit,
Reuters reported, citing two people familiar with matter.  The sale may officially begin in the second quarter, the
 news agency  said, citing the sources. Siemens announced plans to
dispose of the water unit, which has annual sales of about 1
billion euros ($1.35 billion), in November. Siemens and Goldman
Sachs declined to comment, Reuters said.  Several potential bidders have approached Munich-based
Siemens, according to the news agency. It said industry sources
expect  Xylem Inc. (XYL)  and  Pentair Ltd. (PNR)  to be interested as much of
Siemensâ€™s water business is focused on North America.  Asian suitors may include  Kurita Water Industries Ltd. (6370) ,
 Hyflux Ltd. (HYF) ,  Hitachi Ltd. (6501)  and  Marubeni Corp. (8002) , one of the people
cited said. Private equity buyers are also expected to show
interest, Reuters said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
