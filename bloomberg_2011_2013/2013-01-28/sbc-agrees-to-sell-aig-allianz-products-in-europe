HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Europe’s largest
bank by market value, agreed to sell products from insurers
 American International Group Inc. (AIG)  and  Allianz SE (ALV)  in countries on
the continent.  AIG will pay $55 million in cash for a 10-year agreement
covering non-life-insurance products to be sold in Turkey,
France and other nations, London-based HSBC said yesterday in a
statement. Allianz agreed to pay 23 million euros ($30 million)
in a decade-long agreement for sales of life-insurance and
pension products in Turkey and elsewhere, the Munich-based firm
said in a  statement.   Peter Hancock , chief of AIG’s property-casualty unit, said
in May that he has been focusing more on writing profitable
business than on building premium revenue. He boosted the New
York-based insurer’s focus on emerging markets and reduced
business in segments that require more capital.  “We are pleased that this long-term collaboration will
allow us to expand our existing distribution arrangement and
operations platforms,” Dan Doherty, president of consumer
insurance for AIG’s Europe, Middle East and Africa regions, said
in a statement.  AIG said it agreed to acquire HSBC Assurances IARD, a
French subsidiary, for as much as $14.5 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
