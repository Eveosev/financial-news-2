The  United Arab Emirates  is planning
to complete a bankruptcy law soon and has referred it to the
 finance ministry  for implementation, the state-owned  Emirates
News Agency  reported, citing Younis Al Khoori, Director General
at the Ministry of Finance.  The law was drafted by the finance ministry, economy
ministry and the central bank, and would be applied in all seven
emirates, the agency said.  The legislation must be reviewed by various committees
before being approved by the national federal council and
ultimately the cabinet, according to the agency.  Link to BFW story: {SUID: MGWSSH6TTDS0}  To contact the reporter on this story:
