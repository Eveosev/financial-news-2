Jeff Walker, Asia-Pacific head of
insurance at  Barclays Plc (BARC) ’s investment banking unit, has left as
Britain’s second-largest bank started cutting jobs last week,
two people with knowledge of the matter said.  Walker, who joined the financial institutions group in 2011
from Daiwa Capital Markets  Hong Kong , was previously chief
executive officer at Prudential Assurance Co. in Hong Kong. Nina Zhou, a managing director in the same group, and David Han, co-
head of Korea investment banking, also left, the people said,
asking not to be identified because the matter is private.  Angie Tang, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for Barclays,
declined to comment on the departures. Walker, Zhou and Han
didn’t return calls made to their office or mobile phones.  Barclays plans to eliminate at least 15 percent of its
investment banking positions in  Asia , involving about 70 jobs,
people with knowledge of the matter said last week. Barclays
doesn’t plan to exit any markets or product areas in the region,
one of the people said.  Jiho Kim, who was co-head of Korea investment banking with
Han, will be the sole head, one of the people said. The bank
last week denied a Korea Economic Daily report that it was
planning to shutter investment banking operations in  South
Korea . The office there remains “open and fully operational,”
Barclays said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
