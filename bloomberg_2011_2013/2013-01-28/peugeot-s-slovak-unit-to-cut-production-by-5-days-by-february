PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG)  will suspend
production at its Slovak factory today and during four days in
February because of slowing demand in western  Europe , the
spokesman said.  The company still maintains its plan to exceed output from
2012, when it assembled almost 215,000 vehicles in its factory
in Trnava, western Slovakia, Peter Svec, the spokeswoman for the
Slovak unit said in an e-mailed statement today.  The French carmaker makes Citroen C3 Picasso and Peugeot
208 models in the Slovak factory, which became operational in
2006. Peugeot’s European sales slumped 19 percent in December
from the same month in 2011, exceeding the 16 percent decline
for all manufacturers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
