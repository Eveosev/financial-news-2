Former U.K. Energy Secretary Chris
Huhne pleaded not guilty to a charge of perverting the course of
justice in a London court today for a trial that is scheduled to
start Feb. 4.  Both Huhne, 58, and his ex-wife Vicky Pryce were charged
last year by U.K. prosecutors over obstruction allegations
linked to a 2003 speeding offense, according to the Crown
Prosecution Serviceâ€™s indictment.  Huhne resigned as U.K. Energy Secretary in Feb. 2012 after
becoming the first serving Cabinet minister to be charged with a
serious criminal offense in modern times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
