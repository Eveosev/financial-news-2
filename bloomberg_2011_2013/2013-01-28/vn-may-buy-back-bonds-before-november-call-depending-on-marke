(Corrects stake on sale and price in third paragraph of
story published Jan. 28.)  TVN SA (TVN) , Poland’s second-largest
television network, may use the cash from its Onet.pl sale to
buy back bonds before a November deadline and may refinance
remaining notes depending on market conditions.  “As we said before, the majority of proceeds from the sale
of Onet will be used to buy back bonds,” Tomasz Pozniak, the
head of the company’s investor relations, said in a phone
interview on Jan. 25. “Currently it’s not beneficial to buy
back bonds as the price is comparable to the early redemption
price we will have in November. If the price was lower than the
November call, then it would be in our benefit.”  In November TVN sold 75 percent of  Poland ’s largest web
portal Onet.pl to Vidalia Investments Sp. z o.o., a unit of
Ringier Axel Springer Media AG, for 956.3 million zloty ($306
million) in cash. The broadcaster swapped the remaining 25
percent in Onet for a 25 percent stake in Vidalia.  The broadcaster, which in 2011 posted its first annual loss
since its stock started trading in Warsaw in 2004, is selling
businesses as the economic slowdown hurts the ad market. Last
year it also merged its pay-TV unit with  France ’s  Canal Plus .  The company’s outstanding bonds include 593 million euros
of 2017 securities paying 10.75 percent and 175 million euros of
2018 notes paying 7.875 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Pozniak says TVN is considering refinancing the
current debt.  “It’s a good time” for refinancing “and we are looking
at such an opportunity as well,” he said. “Our average cost of
debt is at about 10 percent, while in this market it is possible
to get somewhere around 7 percent.”  The company is yet to make a decision on any refinancing
and according to Pozniak, the current market could “absorb” a
bond sale of 500 million euros to 600 million euros.  “The market believes that the high-yield  bond market 
should be strong at least until mid 2013,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
