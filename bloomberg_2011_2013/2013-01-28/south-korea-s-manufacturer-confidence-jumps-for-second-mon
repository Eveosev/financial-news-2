South Korean manufacturers’
confidence increased for the second straight month as signs of
improving domestic demand buoyed business sentiment.  An  index  measuring expectations for February increased to
72 from 70 for January, the  Bank of Korea  said in a statement in
 Seoul  today. A measure of expectations at  non-manufacturing
companies  advanced to 70 from 68. A reading below 100 indicates
that pessimists outnumber optimists.  Improving domestic demand sent  consumer sentiment  to the
highest level in eight months in January while the December
unemployment rate stayed at a four-year low, adding to signs
that  Asia ’s fourth largest economy is recovering. Gross domestic
product grew 0.4 percent in the fourth quarter from the previous
period, after two quarters of growth declines.  “Although timid, recovery is taking place,” said Oh Suk
Tae, a Seoul-based economist at Standard Chartered Bank  Korea .
“Progress is slow due to the won’s recent gains, which are
slowing corporate investment. The pace of global economic
recovery is also an uncertainty,”  The won has risen 20.43 percent against the yen and 7.5
percent against the dollar over the past six months, making it
Asia’s best performing currency in that time.  An index measuring  consumer confidence  rose to 102 for
January from 99 in December, the Bank of Korea said yesterday.
Today’s index is based on a survey conducted between Jan. 15 and
Jan. 22 with responses from 1,484 manufacturers and 1,062 non-
manufacturers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
