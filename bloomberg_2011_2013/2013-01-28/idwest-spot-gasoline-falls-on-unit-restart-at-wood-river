Gasoline weakened the most in two
weeks in the U.S. Midwest as  Phillips 66 (PSX)  restarted a unit at its
Wood River refinery near  St. Louis .  Phillips 66 resumed work by an alkylation unit at the
356,000-barrel-a-day plant on Jan. 25 after shutting Jan. 22, a
person familiar with the turnaround schedule said. A benzene
extractor, a part of the unit, is expected to halt Feb. 28 for
22 days of work, said the person, who asked not to be identified
because the information isn’t public.  Rich Johnson , a Phillips 66 spokesman based in Houston,
declined to comment on the alkylation unit or the status of
today’s operations at Wood River. The plant is the second-
largest in the Midwest, behind  BP Plc (BP/) ’s  Whiting refinery , which
has a capacity of 420,000 barrels a day, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Conventional gasoline  in the Group 3 region slipped 0.5
cent to 17 cents a gallon below futures on the  New York
Mercantile exchange  at 2:36 p.m. It was the  biggest slide  and
first decline since Jan. 16.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel in the region advanced 0.38 cent to
2.75 cents a gallon below heating oil futures.  Conventional gasoline  to be blended with ethanol in the
U.S. Gulf Coast dropped 1.2 cents to 20.5 cents below futures,
while reformulated gasoline slipped 1 cent to trade at an 18-
cent discount. Ultra-low-sulfur diesel in the region
strengthened  0.12 cent  to 0.13 cent under heating oil futures.  The same diesel was unchanged at a premium of 5 cents in
 New York . The discount of reformulated,  84-octane gasoline 
narrowed 0.38 cent to 0.75 cent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
