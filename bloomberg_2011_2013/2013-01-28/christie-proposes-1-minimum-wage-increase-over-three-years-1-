New Jersey Governor  Chris Christie 
proposed increasing the state’s minimum wage by $1 over a phase-
in period of three years.  Christie conditionally vetoed Democrats’ legislation, which
had sought to raise the wage to $8.50 an hour in March from
$7.25 and tie future increases to changes in the U.S. Consumer
 Price Index . He also proposed a 25 percent increase in the New
Jersey Earned Income Tax Credit, which benefits workers of low
and moderate incomes.  Christie, 50, a Republican seeking a second term, said in a
statement that the Democrats’ measure was “lopsided” because
it would harm small businesses while helping wage earners.  New Jersey Chamber of Commerce Chief Executive Officer
Thomas Bracken called Christie’s proposal a “reasonable
compromise.”  Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver, a Democrat from  East
Orange , said the legislature will push for a referendum on the
November ballot.  “We just need a simple majority of votes out of the
Assembly and the Senate, which we know we will have,” Oliver
said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
