Kenya , the world’s largest exporter
of black tea, expects earnings from shipments to increase 3.6
percent this year as production increases.  Revenue from tea exports may increase to 116 billion
billion shillings ($1.3 billion) from 112 billion shillings in
2012, Tea Board of Kenya Managing Director Sicily Kariuki told
reporters today in the capital, Nairobi. Output may climb to 373
million kilograms (820.6 million pounds) from 369.5 million
kilograms on improved weather, she said.  “Kenya experienced good and well distributed rainfall
coupled with moderate temperatures towards the last quarter of
2012,” Kariuki said. “Good weather conditions continued into
the first half of January 2013.”  Tea is the biggest generator of foreign exchange in Kenya,
 East Africa ’s biggest economy and host to one of the world’s
biggest auctions of the leaves in the port city of  Mombasa .  The average tea price at weekly sales in Mombasa advanced
to $3.18 per kilogram in 2012 from $2.90 a year earlier, Kariuki
said. The prices are expected to average $3.20 this year, she
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
