Kenya’s  trade gap  in November
widened as the discovery of the first crude oil deposit fueled
demand for imports of machinery and equipment.  The deficit reached 83.8 billion shillings ($957.2 million)
compared with 81.8 billion shillings in the same month a year
earlier and 62.4 billion shillings in October, the Kenya
National Bureau of Statistics said in a  report  on its website.  Oil exploration in the East African nation increased
following discoveries by  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW)  and  Africa Oil Corp (AOI)  last
year. Imports of machinery for oil and gas development has put
the country’s current account balance under pressure, the World
Bank said in a December report. Kenya is also making
“substantial” investments to upgrade roads and boost
electricity generation after years of neglect, the bank said.  Imports climbed by 3.6 billion shillings to 129.9 billion
shillings in November from a year earlier, while exports rose
1.5 billion shillings to 46.1 billion shillings, the statistics
agency said.  Coffee exports more than doubled to 4,109.6 metric tons in
November from 1,989.9 tons a year earlier, generating a 24
percent increase in revenue to 1.5 billion shillings. Shipments
of horticulture products rose 6 percent to 18,347 tons, fetching
7.7 billion shillings, up from 6.6 billion shillings, the agency
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
