The regulator of the $3.7 trillion
U.S. municipal bond market is moving to make indexes publicly
available so investors can more easily gauge the prices of
securities.  The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, which crafts
rules for the state and local government bond market, said it
plans to provide benchmark yields available on its website that
reports securities trades. Such indexes are now available
through fee-based services, such as Bloomberg LP and Thomson
Reuters Corp.  The benchmarks would improve the ability of individual
investors to determine the fairness of prices. Many of the bonds
trade infrequently because they’re sold by small governments
that don’t borrow often. Nearly half of all municipal bonds are
held by households, according to Federal Reserve data.  The board said today it is working with companies that
produce such indexes and may be able to make so-called yield
curves -- which show the difference in yields between bonds
based on how long until the debt is repaid -- within the next
three months.  “It’s all about transparency and trying to provide the
investor community and the issuer community with more and more
data,” Jay Goldstone, the chairman of the Alexandria, Virginia-
based board, said today on a conference call with reporters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
