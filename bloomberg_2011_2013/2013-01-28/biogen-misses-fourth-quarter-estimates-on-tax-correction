Biogen Idec Inc. (BIIB)  reported fourth-
quarter profit that exceeded analysts’ estimates after adjusting
for a correction in tax accounting related to a Denmark
facility, as sales of its multiple sclerosis drugs rose.  Earnings excluding one-time items were $1.40 a share,
Weston, Massachusetts-based Biogen said today in a statement.
Without the 12-cent tax expense, adjusted profit beat by 6 cents
the average of 25 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The
accounting correction added $29 million in expenses.  Revenue rose 6.9 percent to $1.42 billion, topping
analysts’ $1.39 billion average estimate. The company forecast
2013 earnings, adjusted for one-time items, of $7.15 to $7.25 a
share. Analysts had estimated $7.25 a share, on average.  “Revenue and EPS guidance is in-line with the street,”
 Mark Schoenebaum , an analyst with ISI Group, wrote in a note to
clients today. Fourth-quarter “revenue results look generally
strong.”  Biogen gained 2.6 percent to $149.99 at the close in New
York, the biggest one-day increase since Nov. 20. The shares has
increased 27 percent in the past 12 months.  Net income declined 2.7 percent to $292.1 million, or $1.23
a share, from $300.2 million, or $1.22, a year earlier, the
company said.  Sales of Biogen’s top-seller, the multiple sclerosis drug
Avonex, increased 7.1 percent to $753.2 million, while those for
Tysabri, another drug for MS, increased 9.6 percent to $295.2
million.  Biogen said it is prepared to begin selling a pill for MS,
BG-12, in the second quarter under the brand name Tecfidera, and
is expecting to start selling two hemophilia medicines late this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
