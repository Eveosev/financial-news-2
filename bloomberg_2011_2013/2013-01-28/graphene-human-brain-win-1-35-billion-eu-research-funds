University-led research projects to
investigate graphene and the functioning of the human brain each
won  1 billion euros  ($1.35 billion) in European Union funding,
the European Commission said.  Researchers at  Sweden â€™s Chalmers University will lead a
project to investigate graphene, the thinnest and toughest
material ever produced which conducts electricity 30 times
faster than silicon. Royal Philips Electronics NV, Alcatel-
Lucent SA,  Thales SA (HO)  and  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  are among companies involved
in the program. Another project simulating the way the human
brain works is led by researchers at the Ecole Polytechnique
Federale of Lausanne, Switzerland, and includes  SAP AG (SAP) ,  Cray
Inc. (CRAY)  and  International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)   The EU said the funding will be paid out over 10 years with
an initial grant of up to 54 million euros to each project this
year, according to an e-mailed statement. The two projects were
selected over 19 others.  To contact the reporter on this story:
