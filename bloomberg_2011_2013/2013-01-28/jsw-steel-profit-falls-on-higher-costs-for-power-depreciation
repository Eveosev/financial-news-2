JSW Steel Ltd. (JSTL) , India’s third-
biggest producer, posted an 18 percent drop in third-quarter
profit as costs surged because of an increase in depreciation
and power expenses.  Net income , excluding unit  JSW Ispat Steel Ltd. (JSWI) , was 1.37
billion rupees ($25.4 million) in the three months ended Dec.
31, compared with 1.68 billion rupees a year earlier, the
Mumbai-based company said today in a statement. The median
estimate of 8 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for a profit of
2.46 billion rupees. Sales climbed 5 percent to 82.7 billion
rupees.  Total costs at JSW, in which Japan’s second-biggest
steelmaker  JFE Holdings Inc. (5411)  holds a 16 percent stake, rose 5.8
percent to 74.8 billion rupees in the quarter, according to the
statement. Finance costs jumped 39 percent to 4.55 billion
rupees, while power and fuel costs increased 12 percent to 4.93
billion rupees. Depreciation and amortization expenses also
gained 12 percent to 4.98 billion rupees.  JSW  shares  rose 0.7 percent to 870.70 rupees at the close

 compared with  a 17 percent advance in the benchmark BSE  India

fell more than 40 percent last quarter. Production at the
company’s biggest factory in Karnataka state rose 8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
