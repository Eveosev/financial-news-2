American Airlines  mechanics, bag
handlers and other ground workers represented by the  Transport
Workers Union  will receive an immediate 4.3 percent raise if the
bankrupt carrier merges with  US Airways Group Inc. (LCC)   The raise is included in a memorandum of understanding that
the union negotiated with the carriers, and follows similar
agreements reached with pilots and flight attendants, the TWU
said today in a  statement . The TWU represents more than 20,000
American employees, the most of any union.  US Airways  has been pursuing a merger with the larger
American since shortly after the  AMR Corp. (AAMRQ)  unit sought
bankruptcy protection in November 2011. American, which has
sought to emerge from bankruptcy on its own, has said it expects
a decision on its future within weeks.  “Our members have made incredible sacrifices to keep
American Airlines afloat,”  Jim Little , TWU international
president, said in the statement. “If there is a merger, their
critical role must be recognized. This agreement is a step in
that direction.”  American negotiated concessions that allowed it to cut
$1.06 billion from annual spending, a central part of its
restructuring plan. The Fort Worth, Texas-based carrier is
eliminating 10,000 positions, with all but 1,800 of the cuts
coming through early-out programs and attrition.  A combination of American, the third-biggest U.S. airline,
and No. 5 US Airways would pass United Continental Holdings Inc.
to become the world’s biggest airline, based on passenger
traffic.  To contact the reporter on this story:
