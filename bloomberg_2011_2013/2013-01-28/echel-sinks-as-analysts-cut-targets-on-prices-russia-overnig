OAO Mechel (MTL)  posted the biggest
decline among Russian stocks in the U.S. last week as analysts
cut target prices for the Moscow-based coal producer on concern
over debt and falling commodities.  American depositary receipts of Mechel, Russia’s biggest
maker of steelmaking coal, slumped 3.7 percent in the week to
$6.82, the steepest decline on the  Bloomberg Russia-US Equity
Index. (RUS14BN)  The gauge of the most-traded Russian companies in the
U.S. added 1.4 percent last week, led by CTC Media Inc. and
 Polyus Gold International Ltd. (PGIL)  Futures expiring in March on the
RTS Index were unchanged at 161,890 in U.S. hours Jan. 25.  Mechel’s price target was reduced the most by analysts last
week of the 50 companies on Russia’s Micex Index, except for
preferred shares of OAO Transneft, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. Alfa Bank, Russia’s top private lender, cut its target for
Mechel ADRs by 30 percent Jan. 16, while Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. reiterated its sell rating, citing the “challenging” coal
market and the company’s debt position.  “Mechel is more vulnerable than almost any other Russian
mining company to declining commodities prices,” Alexei Morozov, an analyst at UBS AG who rates Mechel hold, said by
phone from Moscow Jan. 25 “It’s Mechel’s debt that makes it so
vulnerable to commodities prices.”  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the largest dedicated
Russian exchange-traded fund, jumped 1.9 percent last week to
$30.95, the highest close since Sept. 14. The RTS Volatility
Index, which measures expected swings in the stock futures, fell
0.3 percent to 19.84 in the New York day Jan. 25.  Raw Materials  With net debt of  $9.3 billion  as of Dec. 1, according to
its website, Mechel is the most indebted Russian mining company
after the world’s biggest aluminum producer United Co. Rusal.  The  Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index (CRY)  of raw materials
futures prices has lost 5.4 percent in the past year, making it
more difficult for Mechel to repay its creditors. The company’s
revenue fell 15 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier
to $2.7 billion, the lowest level in two years, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Mechel slipped 4.2 percent in Moscow last week to 207.2
rubles, or the equivalent of $6.9. It was the second-biggest
decliner on the  Micex (INDEXCF)  gauge after OAO VSMPO-Avisma Corp., the
world’s largest titanium maker.  The average price of coking coal, a commodity used to make
steel, will decline 19 percent to $170 a ton in 2013, from $209
in 2012, UBS’ Morozov said. The median price for hot rolled
coil, a benchmark steel price, is expected to decline 1.8
percent to $560 a ton in 2013 from $570 in 2012, according to
UBS.  Asset Sales  Mechel has identified assets it plans to sell, including
steel plants in Lithuania, Ukraine and the U.K., ferro-alloy and
energy-generating assets and the international arm of its steel
trader, to help reduce debt. As much as 25 percent of its coal
mining unit may also be sold to a strategic investor, the
company said Sept. 25.  Mechel (MTLR)  almost breached loan agreements
last year before agreeing with banks to revise covenants.  The company probably won’t be able to sell all of its
assets for sale “because of poor demand,” UBS’ Morozov said.  Global depositary receipts of Polyus Gold, Russia’s biggest
producer of the metal, surged 12 percent last week in New York
to $3.44, the highest close since Oct. 22. Polyus rallied 13
percent in London, a record weekly jump. Trading volumes were
more than twice the daily average over the past three months,
data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  CTC Soars  The mining company may increase dividends should
billionaire  Mikhail Prokhorov ’s Onexim Holdings Ltd. sell his
37.8 percent stake in Polyus, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said
in a Jan. 25 report, reiterating its buy recommendation on the
stock.  CTC Media Inc. (CTCM) , a Nasdaq-listed Russian television company,
jumped 8.9 percent last week to $10.11, the highest level since
May. Volumes were more than 2.5 times the three-month daily
average.  CTC’s television channel, the Moscow-based company’s
biggest source of revenue, saw its share of viewers 4 years and
older rise to the fourth biggest in the nation for the first
time since March 2012, data researcher TNS Global said in a Jan.
24 report.  OAO Mobile TeleSystems (MBT) , Russia’s biggest mobile-phone
company, fell 2 percent to $19.21 in New York Jan. 25, trimming
its gain last week to 0.8 percent.  Ronnie Moas, president of Standpoint Research Inc. in New
York, cut his recommendation on MTS’ ADRs to hold from buy,
according to a Jan. 25 report.  Ruble Basket  Oil, Russia’s biggest export earner, rose for a seventh
consecutive week, the longest stretch of weekly gains since
2009, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Crude oil for March delivery fell 0.1 percent to $95.88 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange Jan. 25, ending the
week up 0.3 percent. Brent oil for March delivery settled
unchanged at $113.28 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange Jan. 25.  Urals crude , Russia’s main export
blend, fell 0.2 percent to $112.4, cutting its advance last week
to 1.4 percent.  The ruble weakened for the first time in five days versus
the central bank’s  dollar-euro basket , losing 0.3 percent to
34.7193 Jan. 25. Ruble futures due in March showed the currency
little changed at 30.270 per dollar in U.S. hours Jan. 25, after
the ruble strengthened 0.1 percent to 30.0325 per dollar.  United Co. Rusal (486) , the world’s largest aluminum producer,
dropped 2.9 percent to HK$4.73 in Hong Kong trading as of 11:11
a.m. local time. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index was little changed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
