David Grosse, Asia chief operating
officer of CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, is leaving the Credit
Agricole SA’s brokerage unit at the end of this month, said Anna
Tehan, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman.  Donald Skinner, who was previously the head of  Hong Kong 
and  China  for CLSA, will take over his responsibilities, Tehan
said in an e-mailed response to Bloomberg questions. Grosse is
leaving to pursue other opportunities, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
