Theolia (TEO)  SA, the French wind-power
developer that averted bankruptcy in 2010, rose to the highest
price in 4 1/2 months in Paris trading after agreeing to take
control of Germany’s Breeze Two Energy GmbH & Co.  Theolia jumped 6.5 percent to 1.65 euros, the highest close
since Sept. 3, after announcing the 35.5 million-euro ($47.8
million) transaction.  The takeover gives Theolia 337 megawatts of operating wind
farms in Germany and  France , more than doubling its installed
capacity to 634 megawatts, the Aix-en-Provence-based company
said today in a statement. That’s a boon to a stock that slumped
about 75 percent in three years after a funding shortage almost
tipped the developer into insolvency.  With electricity sales from Breeze Two’s projects,
Theolia’s revenue will swell to 100 million euros a year from
67.5 million euros in 2011, according to the company.  Breeze Two, owned by Luxembourg-registered Monument Trust
Ltd., financed its wind parks through a 470 million-euro bond
offering in 2006. Under today’s deal, Theolia will buy a portion
of the notes for 35.5 million euros using a 34 million-euro
loan. The loan, maturing in 2026, is non-recourse, under which
the lenders recoup payments from the venture’s profits.  Breeze Two’s estimated enterprise value of 309 million
euros is “reflected in this transaction,” Theolia said,
without giving further financial details. The French developer
and officials at Breeze Two in Darmstadt,  Germany , couldn’t
immediately be reached for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
