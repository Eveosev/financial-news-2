A gauge of U.S. corporate credit
risk rose as pending U.S. home sales declined in December for
the first time in four months and before the  Federal Reserve ’s
policy announcement later this week.  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, climbed 0.9
basis point to a mid-price of 85.8 basis points at 4:40 p.m. in
 New York , according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The measure
reached 84.9 on Jan. 25, the lowest since September.  Uneven progress in the housing recovery may stoke investor
concern that an economic slowdown will impair companies’ ability
to repay debt. The index of contracts for the purchase of
previously owned homes fell 4.3 percent to 101.7, the National
Association of Realtors reported today in  Washington . The
 Federal Open Market Committee  will issue its policy statement on
Jan. 30 and is expected to keep the U.S. federal funds target
unchanged at 0.25 percent, a Bloomberg survey projects.  “The market will be on hold until the Fed’s next FOMC
decision on Wednesday,”  Adrian Miller , director of fixed income
strategy at New York-based GMP Securities LLC, said in a
telephone interview. “The outcome could be significant and will
have a noticeable impact on the corporate swaps.”  Hess Swaps  The credit-swaps index typically rises as investor
confidence deteriorates and falls as it improves. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  The cost of protecting  Hess Corp’s (HES)  debt from losses for
five years rose after the energy company said it will sell its
fuel storage terminal and exit the refining business. Default
swaps on the company’s debt advanced 9 basis points to 144.5
basis points at 3:41 p.m. in New York, Bloomberg prices show.  The U.S. high-yield par default rate for 2012 was 1.9
percent, according to a report today by  Fitch Ratings , lower
than the 4.6 percent average from 1980 through 2012. The ratings
company projects that default activity in 2013 will remain in
line with 2012. The weighted average recovery rate for the 2012
defaults was at 50.2 percent, according to the analysts, led by
Mariarosa Verde.  High Yield  The  risk premium  on the Markit CDX North American High
Yield Index increased 3.2 basis points to 433.1 basis points,
Bloomberg prices show.  The average relative yield on junk-rated debt dropped 1.5
basis points to 458 basis points, led by spreads on the bonds of
technology companies, which fell by 3.9 basis points to 485
basis points, Bloomberg data show. High-yield, high-risk debt is
rated below Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service and lower than
BBB- at  Standard & Poor’s . A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
