Huaneng Power International Inc. (902) ,
the publicly traded unit of  China ’s largest electricity
producer, said 2012 profit rose more than fourfold because of
higher tariffs and lower coal costs.  Profit climbed “primarily due to the carryover effect of
the tariff adjustments in 2011, the decrease of coal price in
2012 and the effective cost controls by the company,” the
Beijing-based power generator said in a  statement  to the Hong
Kong stock exchange yesterday, without giving full-year numbers.  China raised prices charged by coal-fired power plants to
distributors, known as on-grid tariffs, by 0.026 yuan per
kilowatt-hour effective Dec. 1, 2011. Coal prices, which
averaged 821 yuan ($132) per ton in 2011, dropped to 699  yuan 
per ton in 2012, benefiting power generators such as Huaneng
Power and China Resources Power Holdings Co., according to
research a note from Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. on Jan. 22.  Huaneng Power declined 0.6 percent to HK$7.23 at the noon
trading break in Hong Kong. The benchmark  Hang Seng Index  gained
0.5 percent. The company will report its full annual earnings in
March.  The 340 percent increase in profit to at least 5.72 billion
yuan was lower than the  mean estimate  of 6.2 billion yuan from
15 analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News . Huaneng’s net was 1.3
billion yuan in 2011, according to the exchange filing.  Profit was less than expected because of a write off
related to loss-making power plants, Pierre Lau, head of Asian
utilities and clean energy research at Citigroup Inc., wrote in
a note today.  The plants are primarily in western and inland Chinese
provinces, where power tariffs are below the national average,
according to the Citigroup research note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
