Chateau Mouton-Rothschild 2003
climbed to its highest level for nine months on London’s Liv-ex
wine market, with five cases selling for 3,295 pounds ($5,180)
each, according to data on Liv-ex’s  Cellar Watch  website.  That was the most paid for that vintage of the Bordeaux
first-growth wine on the exchange since April 13 last year, and
was 24 percent up from a low of 2,661 pounds reached on Aug. 18,
according to Liv-ex data.  As Chinese demand for premium Bordeaux approached its peak
in October 2010, 20 cases of  Mouton  2003 sold at  Sotheby’s  in
 Hong Kong  in October 2010 for HK$84,700 ($10,900) each, more
than double the current Liv-ex price.  The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 index, comprising 10 recent
vintages of the five Bordeaux left-bank first-growths, has risen
3 percent since the start of the year, after a drop of 9.7
percent in 2012.  Mouton 2003 is the fourth-biggest gainer in the Fine Wine
50 over the past year, behind Chateau Margaux 2001 and the
Mouton 2002 and 1999 vintages, according to Liv-ex data. That’s
based on merchant list prices in Europe surveyed by Liv-ex.  Mouton is run by Baron Philippe de Rothschild's heir 
Julien de Beaumarchais de Rothschild and his mother,Baroness Philippine de Rothschild.
