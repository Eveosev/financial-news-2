India ’s rupee fell to the lowest
level in a week on speculation importers boosted purchases of
the dollar to pay month-end bills.  The  Reserve Bank  of India today said the government’s
economic policy overhaul may boost room to focus on spurring
growth, while signaling the scope for monetary easing is limited
by risks such as elevated inflation. The central bank  will
lower borrowing costs to 7.75 percent from 8 percent, according
to 25 of 29 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Three predict a
reduction to 7.5 percent and one sees no change.  “We are seeing month-end demand for dollars, largely from
 oil companies ,” said Ravi Ranjit, chief manager at Federal
Bank. “Any deviation from expectations at tomorrow’s policy
review would lead to a sharp move in the currency, and investors
will also be focused on the tone of the statement.”  The rupee declined 0.4 percent to 53.9150 per dollar in
Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched
53.9550 earlier, the weakest level since Jan. 21.  One-month implied volatility in the rupee, a gauge of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, rose
20 basis points, or 0.20 percentage point, to 10 percent.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 54.90 per
dollar, compared with 54.68 on Jan. 25, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 54.78 versus 54.59. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
