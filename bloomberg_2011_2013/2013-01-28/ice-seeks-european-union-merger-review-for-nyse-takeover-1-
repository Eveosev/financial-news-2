IntercontinentalExchange Inc. (ICE)  will
seek a European Union merger review of its plans to buy NYSE
Euronext to avoid multiple probes across the 27-nation bloc.  While ICE must formally ask U.K., Portugal and Spain to
approve the deal, it said it will ask for EU regulators to take
charge of examining the transaction, according to a regulatory
filing published today. ICE said it expects to file for EU
approval in the first half of this year.  The exchanges intend to ask national regulators to pass the
deal to the European Commission so that clearance is required
only from one authority, ICE said in a regulatory filing today.
The Brussels-based commission can demand jurisdiction over deals
that have a cross-border impact.  ICE, the 12-year-old energy and commodity futures bourse,
agreed on Dec. 21 to acquire  NYSE Euronext (NYX)  for cash and stock
worth $8.2 billion. EU regulators blocked Deutsche Boerse AGâ€™s
purchase of NYSE last year, citing concern over competition in
derivatives and clearing and rejecting arguments the combined
exchange would be a regional champion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
