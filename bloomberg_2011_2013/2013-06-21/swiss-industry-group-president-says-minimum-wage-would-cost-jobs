  Switzerland  should reject a
proposal to introduce a national  minimum wage  because companies
would have to cut jobs to pay for the increased wage bill,  Hans
Hess , President of industry body  Swissmem , said.  “When you just do what the initiative wants, a 4,000 franc
($4,313) monthly minimum wage, companies can’t afford that and
jobs will be lost,” Hess said at a conference in Fribourg,
about 160 kms (99 miles) drive from the capital Zurich.  Swiss workers cost 10 times more than their Romanian or
Chinese counterparts, he said. Swiss unemployment rose to 3.2
percent in May from 3.1 percent in April. Euro-area unemployment
increased to a record 12.2 percent in April.  Swissmem represents manufacturers including  ABB Ltd. (ABBN) ,
 Sulzer AG (SUN)  and OC Oerlikon Corp. which accounted for 9.2 percent
of Swiss gross domestic product in 2012 and about a third of
exports, according to the lobby  group ’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
