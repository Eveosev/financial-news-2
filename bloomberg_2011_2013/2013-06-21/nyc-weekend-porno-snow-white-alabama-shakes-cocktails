Things don’t end well for the Disney beauty in “WS,” Paul McCarthy’s lewd installation at the Park Avenue Armory. Not for the faint-hearted, or kids under 17. The installation includes a creepy forest in the center hall and little dwellings in which horror unfolds, often involving horny big-nosed dwarfs and, in one case, a broomstick.  “WS” runs through Aug. 4 at 643 Park Ave. Information: +1-212-744-8180;  http://www.armoryonpark.org .

Don’t play? Just hum in the DUMBO ConEd Farragut Substation.
