U.S. stocks rose, recovering from
early losses, as consumer staples and health-care companies led
the market higher following the worst plunge for the Standard &
Poorâ€™s 500 Index in 19 months.  The S&P 500 added 0.2 percent to 1,591.86 at 1 p.m. in New
York after losing 0.7 percent earlier and plunging 3.9 percent
in the previous two days as Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S.
Bernanke said the central bank may begin to reduce bond
purchases this year if risks to the economy continue to abate.  Stock trading may be more volatile than usual today as
futures and options contracts expire in a process known as
quadruple witching. Trading volume for S&P 500 stocks was 85
percent higher than the 30-day average at this time of day.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
