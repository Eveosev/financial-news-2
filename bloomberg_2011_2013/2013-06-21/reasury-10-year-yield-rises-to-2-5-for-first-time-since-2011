Treasury 10-year note  yields  rose
past 2.5 percent for the first time in 22 months as investors
fled  U.S. debt  with the Federal Reserve forecasting growth
strong enough to allow policy makers to stop buying bonds.  Yields on the benchmark security for everything from
mortgages to corporate loans  surged  this week by the most since
the Iraqi war after Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said June 19
the central bank may begin dialing down quantitative  easing  this
year and end it in mid-2014. Yields on German bunds touched a
14-month high, while the dollar rallied.  “Bernanke has moved the range higher, and we still have
liquidation going on,” said  Sean Murphy , a trader at Societe
Generale SA in New York, one of the 21 primary dealers that
trade with the Fed. “But the market is still in price-discovery
mode. The range is undefined. There is value around these
levels, but with an unwind like this there is still a lot of
confusion on where we should be.”  Ten-year (USGG10YR)  yields climbed 12 basis points, or 0.12 percentage
point, to 2.53 percent at 5 p.m.  New York  time, according to
Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. It touched 2.55 percent, the
highest since Aug. 8, 2011. The yields increased 40 basis points
on the week, the most since March 2003.  The price of the 1.75 percent note due in May 2023 slid
31/32, or $9.69 per $1,000 face amount, to 93 6/32.  Thirty-year (USGG30YR)  bond yields advanced seven basis points to 3.58
percent and touched 3.60 percent, the highest since September
2011. They rose 28 basis points on the week, the most since
August 2009.  ‘Technically Significant’  The 10-year note yield may extend its increase to 2.75
percent after closing above a technical level at 2.52 percent,
according to  Ian Lyngen , a government-bond strategist at CRT
Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . That’s the 61.8
percent Fibonacci retracement level from a July 1, 2011, high,
he said. Fibonacci analysis is founded on the theory that prices
tend to rise or fall by specific percentages after reaching a
new highs or lows.  The level of “2.5 percent is psychologically significant,
and 2.52 percent is technically significant,” Lyngen said. “If
we are holding that level, it’s constructive for the market and
we should consolidate in this new yield range of 2.3 percent to
2.5 percent. If we break the range, we could rise as high as
2.75 percent.”  The so-called term  premium  on Treasury 10-year notes rose
to 0.27 percent, the highest since July 2011, according to a
Columbia Management Investment Advisers LLC model. It turned
positive this week for the first time since October 2011. The
premium reached an all-time low of minus 0.64 percent last July.  ‘New Reality’  “The market is adjusting to the new  reality ,” said  Thomas Roth , senior Treasury trader in New York at Mitsubishi UFJ
Securities USA Inc. “People have been hiding in bond funds.
Bond funds have been piggy-backing off the Fed. The adjustment
process may take us a little further than you would think.”  Bernanke, speaking this week after a two-day meeting of the
 Federal Open Market Committee , said reducing bond purchases
would depend on the economy achieving the central bank’s
objectives. Policy makers are forecasting growth of as much as
2.6 percent this year and 3.5 percent in 2014.  The Fed has been buying $45 billion of  U.S. government debt 
and $40 billion of mortgage securities each month to put
downward pressure on borrowing costs in its third round of asset
purchases. It purchased $1.5 billion today of Treasuries due
from February 2036 to May 2042.  Reduction Forecast  The central bank will cut its monthly bond purchases to $65
billion at its Sept. 17-18 policy meeting, according to 44
percent of 54 economists surveyed by Bloomberg after Bernanke’s
June 19 press conference. In a June 4-5 survey, only 27 percent
forecast tapering would start in September.  The central bank left unchanged its statement that it plans
to hold its target  interest rate  at almost zero, where it’s been
since 2008, as long as unemployment remains above 6.5 percent
and the outlook for inflation doesn’t exceed 2.5 percent.
Bernanke said a rate increase is still “far in the future.”  Fed-funds futures showed a 54 percent probability policy
makers will raise the benchmark  interest rate  by at least a
quarter-percentage point at their December 2014 meeting, versus
a 14 percent chance at the start of May.  The gap between yields on 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation-Protected Securities of comparable maturity narrowed
to 1.94 percentage points, the least since January 2012. The
difference, known as the 10-year  break-even  rate, represents the
bond market’s expectations for the rate of growth in consumer
prices during the life of the debt.  Volatility Climbs  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch MOVE index climbed to 103.73, the highest level
since November 2011. The daily average this year is 62.  “People are re-evaluating what is going on here,” said
 Charles Comiskey , head of Treasury trading at Bank of  Nova
Scotia  in New York, one of 21 primary dealers that trade with
the Fed. “They’re going to start increasing short-term interest
rates in the second half of 2014.”  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators reversed
their bets on 10-year note futures for a sixth straight week as
of June 18, taking a  net-long  position, according to U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.  Speculative long positions, or wagers prices will rise,
outnumbered short positions by 31,229 contracts on the Chicago
Board of Trade. A week earlier, traders were net-short 9,195
contracts.  German 10-year  bund  yields climbed to 1.74 percent, the
highest level since April 2012. Stocks fluctuated, with the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index losing as much as 0.7 percent and
gaining 0.7 percent. The dollar rose against 12 of its 16 most-traded counterparts.  To contact the reporters on this story:
