Abby Wambach eclipsed her U.S.
countrywoman Mia Hamm’s scoring record in international soccer
by taking her career tally to 160 goals.  Wambach, 33, tied Hamm’s mark with her second goal and
broke it with her third in a 5-0 win over South Korea at Red
Bull Arena in Harrison, New Jersey, last night. Wambach got four
goals in the first half of the exhibition game.  “So proud of you, my friend,” Hamm, 41, who retired in
2004 with 158 goals in international games, wrote on her Twitter
page. “You are a warrior and true champion. Enjoy this.”  Ali Daei scored 109 career goals for  Iran , the record for
men’s international soccer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
