Taiwan’s 10-year bond yield rose
this week to a 21-month high and the local dollar fell as
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the central bank
may taper its stimulus this year.  Bernanke said June 19 that $85 billion a month of debt
purchases, known as quantitative easing, may be trimmed this
year and ended in 2014 if the  U.S. economy  performs in line with
estimates. Global funds sold $1.4 billion more Taiwanese stocks
than they bought this week, taking net sales this month to $3.2
billion, according to exchange data.  “The prospect of less quantitative easing has caused
outflows and selloffs in Asian assets, including Taiwan’s,”
said Tobby Lin, a fixed-income trader at Yuanta Securities Co.
in Taipei. “But in a way, Taiwan’s being hurt less than
countries in  Southeast Asia  and  South Korea .”  The yield on the 1.125 percent notes due March 2023 climbed
seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, this week to 1.427
percent in Taipei, according to Gretai Securities Market prices.
That’s the highest yield for a benchmark 10-year note since
September 2011. The rate rose four basis points today.  The  Taiwan dollar  fell 1 percent since June 14 to NT$30.28
against its U.S. counterpart, Taipei Forex Inc. prices show. The
currency weakened 0.4 percent today, after trading 0.3 percent
stronger one minute before the 4 p.m. close. The central bank
has sold the currency in the run-up to the close on most days in
the past year, according to traders who asked not to be
identified.  Forwards Fall  One-month non-deliverable forwards dropped 1.1 percent this
week to NT$30.18 against the greenback, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts were steady today. One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in the
 exchange rate  used to price options, rose 94 basis points to 5.7
percent since June 14 and fell six basis points today.  The  overnight interbank lending  rate was little changed at
0.384 percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the
Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
