Taiwan  health authorities said a
local woman was found with H6N1 avian influenza, the first ever
reported infection of the viral strain in a person.  A 20-year-old woman from Central Taiwan started showing flu
symptoms including fever, cough and muscle pain on May 5 and
sought hospital treatment on May 8, Taiwan’s Centers for Disease
Control said in a statement on its  website  today. She was given
 Roche Holding AG (ROG) ’s Tamiflu medicine and was discharged from the
hospital May 11.  Authorities were notified of the case on May 20, the agency
said. Whole genome sequencing later found the virus to be a
novel H6N1 strain of avian influenza, it said.  The patient, who works at a breakfast stand, hasn’t
traveled overseas or been exposed to poultry or birds, the
agency said. A total of 36 close contacts have been identified
with four experiencing flu-like symptoms, though none were found
to be infected with the H6N1 strain, it said. Health and
agricultural authorities in Taiwan will continue their
surveillance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
