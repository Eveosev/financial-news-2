Dish Network Corp. (DISH) , the satellite-TV
company that abandoned its bid for  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) , will
redeem $2.6 billion of bonds it issued last month to help fund
the planned acquisition.  The company will redeem on June 24 its $1.25 billion of 5
percent bonds due May 2017 at 100 cents on the dollar and its
$1.35 billion of 6.25 percent notes due May 2023 at 101 cents on
the dollar, plus accrued and unpaid interest, the Englewood,
Colorado-based company said today in a regulatory filing.  The company was required to redeem the securities if it
failed in its bid for Sprint, based on terms of the bond sale
completed on May 15. Investors negotiated during the marketing
period to increase the redemption price on the 10-year bonds to
101 cents from par during the first six months.  The 2017 bonds were quoted as high as 100.5 cents on the
dollar to yield 4.87 percent on May 28 before falling to 100
cents, yielding 5 percent, yesterday, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg.  The 2023 securities were quoted as a low as 99.2 cents to
yield 6.36 percent on June 6 before rising to a high of 100.8
cents, yielding 6.14 percent, on June 19, Bloomberg prices show.
They were quoted at 100.5 cents to yield 6.18 percent yesterday.  Dish did not specify its reasons for abandoning its Sprint
bid, according to the filing, and is making way for  SoftBank
Corp. (9984)  to acquire the third-biggest U.S wireless carrier.  SoftBank sold $3.3 billion of bonds denominated in dollars
and euros to help fund its Sprint bid on April 18, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The sale was not contingent on the
dealâ€™s closing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
