Palm oil  fell to the lowest level in
a week on concerns that a weakening Indian currency and slowing
growth in China will curb imports by the biggest buyers of the
commodity used in everything from noodles to biofuel.  The contract for September delivery lost 0.9 percent to
2,439 ringgit ($762) a metric ton on the Bursa Malaysia
Derivatives, the lowest closing level for most-active futures
since June 14. Palm for local  physical delivery  in July was at
2,455 ringgit, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Interbank lending rates spiked to record in China this week
because of a cash crunch, amid waning confidence about the
prospects for the world’s second-largest economy. The rates
retreated today after the monetary authority was said to have
made funds available to lenders. India’s rupee headed for its
biggest weekly loss since September 2011 after plunging to a
record against the  U.S. dollar  yesterday.  “In India, the rupee has depreciated quite a bit over the
past week, so that could impact their purchasing” power, said
Ivy Ng, an analyst at CIMB Investment Bank Bhd. China’s
financial and economic situation “could lead to short-term
slowing down of demand.”  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley and UBS AG have
cut their 2013 GDP forecasts for China as the country’s
manufacturing and exports growth trailed estimates.  Refined palm oil for January delivery dropped 3.2 percent,
the biggest loss at close since Feb. 25, to 5,998  yuan  ($978) a
ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange , while  soybean oil  for
delivery in the same month fell 2.8 percent to 7,478 yuan.  Soybean oil for December delivery fell 0.1 percent to 47.16
cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade, while soybeans for
delivery in November declined 0.4 percent to $12.7975 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
