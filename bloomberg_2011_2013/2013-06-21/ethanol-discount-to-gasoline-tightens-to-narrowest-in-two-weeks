Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
tightened to the narrowest in more than two weeks with
production of the biofuel behind year-ago levels.  The spread, or price difference, contracted by 3.35 cents
to 29.77 cents a gallon. Output of the fuel has been  below-average  this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The Energy
Information Administration said June 19 that  output  last week
declined 1.2 percent to 873,000 barrels a day, down 3 percent
from the same period in 2012.  “We’re seeing some producers buying in the front,” said
Jim Damask, a manager at StarFuels Inc. in Jupiter,  Florida .
“Whenever you see producers buying, you know the market is
pretty tight.”  Denatured ethanol for July delivery rose 0.8 cent to $2.464
a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade. Prices have gained 13
percent this year.  Gasoline for July delivery slumped 2.55 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $2.7617 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is
made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to filling
stations.  The additive’s discount to gasoline is the narrowest since
June 5.  Ethanol  stockpiles  have dropped 22 percent to 16.5 million
barrels in the past year, the EIA, the Energy Department’s
analytical arm, said this week.  Corn Declines  Corn for July delivery decreased 11.5 cents to $6.6175 a
bushel in Chicago. The corn crush spread, or the cost difference
between a gallon of ethanol and the corn needed to make it, was
at 6 cents, up from 1 cent yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  Compliance with the ethanol blending law is tracked by
Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs, certificates attached
to each gallon of biofuel that refiners can submit to the
government or trade.  Corn-based ethanol RINs climbed 2 cent to 95 cents and
 advanced RINs , which cover Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol and
biodiesel, added 1 cent to $1.03, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  Spot Market  In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago increased 5
cents to $2.49 a gallon; in the U.S. Gulf prices increased 3.5
cents to $2.575; on the West Coast the fuel gained 3.5 cents to
$2.78; and in  New York  the additive jumped 2 cents to $2.56 a
gallon, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  New York’s premium over Chicago narrowed 3 cents to 7 cents
while the U.S. Gulf’s discount to the West Coast was unchanged
at 20.5 cents.  The U.S.  imported  65,000 barrels a day of the fuel last
week, the second highest amount this year, trailing the 67,000
barrels in the week ended Jan. 18, EIA data show.  Anhydrous ethanol in  Sao Paulo  cost $2.29 a gallon last
week, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up 93.58 percent of the total
U.S. gasoline pool last week, down 0.5 percent from last week,
EIA data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
