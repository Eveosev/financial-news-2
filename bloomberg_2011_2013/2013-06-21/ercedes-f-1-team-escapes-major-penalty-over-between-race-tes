Daimler AG (DAI) ’s  Mercedes Grand Prix 
team escaped sanctions such as a fine or points deduction after
being accused of breaking a ban on Formula One teams testing
cars between races.  A panel appointed by the sport’s ruling body Federation
Internationale de l’Automobile said in a statement it was
reprimanding Mercedes and suspending it from participating in a
three-day test for younger drivers.  Pirelli & C. SpA (PC) , Formula One’s tire supplier, also
received a reprimand.  Top-ranked Red Bull and Ferrari had complained the practice
in May to test Pirelli tires gave third-placed Mercedes an
unfair advantage because it used this season’s racing car
instead of an older model.  The panel made its ruling after a hearing in Paris
yesterday.  Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton is fourth in the Formula One
drivers’ championship after seven of 19 races and his teammate
Nico Rosberg is sixth.  Red Bull’s defending champion Sebastian Vettel tops the
standings, Ferrari’s Fernando Alonso is second and Kimi
Raikkonen of Lotus is third.  The next race is the June 30 British Grand Prix at
Silverstone.  To contact the reporters on this story:
