Beacon Power LLC, the maker of
power-storage systems that was  bought  by Rockland Capital last
year, began construction of a 20-megawatt flywheel system in
 Pennsylvania .  The project in Hazle Township will have 200 flywheels,
Tyngsboro, Massachusetts-based Beacon said today in a statement.
The first 4 megawatts of capacity will go into operation in
September and the entire plant is expected to be running in the
second quarter of 2014.  Beacon’s systems store power using 2,500-pound (1,134-kilogram) carbon-fiber cylinders rotating as fast as 16,000
times a minute. The kinetic energy can be quickly converted into
electricity and transferred to the grid to meet sudden surges in
demand.  The project will be the first flywheel storage system in
use in PJM Interconnection LLC’s 13-state power market that
stretches from Illinois to  Delaware , according to the statement.  Beacon received a $43 million U.S. Energy Department loan
guarantee to develop the technology and filed for bankruptcy in
2011. Rockland purchased Beacon’s assets in March 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
