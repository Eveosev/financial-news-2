Thunder Horse  crude strengthened on
the  spot market  after  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  shut production on a
competing platform.  Shell is performing scheduled maintenance on the Mars
Platform in the  Gulf of Mexico , Kayla Macke, a Houston-based
spokeswoman for the company, said in an e-mail yesterday. The
work is expected to last a few weeks.  Mars and Thunder Horse are medium-density crudes delivered
by pipeline to the  Louisiana Offshore Oil Port ’s storage caverns

other platforms, moved 290,000 barrels a day to Clovelly in
March, according to Shell’s  website .  BP Plc (BP/)  can produce up to
250,000 barrels of Thunder Horse crude a day, according to the
company’s  website .  Thunder Horse crude  strengthened by 50 cents to a premium
of $5.25 a barrel over West Texas Intermediate in Cushing,
 Oklahoma , at 2:06 p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Mars Blend weakened by 50 cents to a premium of $1 a barrel
versus WTI. Poseidon weakened 15 cents to a 45-cent-a-barrel
