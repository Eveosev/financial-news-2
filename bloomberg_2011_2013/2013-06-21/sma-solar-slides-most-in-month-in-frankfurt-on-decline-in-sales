SMA Solar Technology AG (S92) ,  Germany ’s
biggest solar company by market value, fell the most in almost a
month in  Frankfurt  after forecasting a plunge in revenue.  SMA slid as much as 7.5 percent, the biggest intraday drop
since May 24, after saying by e-mail today that second-quarter
sales may be in a range of 240 million to 280 million euros
($370 million), compared with 429 million euros a year earlier.  The Niestetal-based producer of inverters used to convert
energy from solar panels into power that can be transmitted on a
grid plans to cut staffing to counter the slump. It’s in talks
with its works council on cuts above those announced in October,
spokeswoman Susanne Henkel said, confirming a Reuters report.  DPA reported the sales numbers late yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
