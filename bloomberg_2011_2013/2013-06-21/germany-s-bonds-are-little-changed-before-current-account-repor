German government bonds dropped for
a second day, pushing  10-year (GDBR10)  yields to the highest level since
April 2012, as demand for fixed-income assets fell amid concern
that policy makers around the world will reduce stimulus.  Benchmark bunds posted the biggest weekly loss in five
months and all euro-region sovereign bonds declined after
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said policy makers may
end stimulus in mid-2014.  Greece ’s 10-year rates rose above 11
percent to the highest in almost two months the Democratic Left
party said it had left the nation’s coalition government.  “Selling pressure continues, not only on bunds, but global
fixed income,” said  Michael Leister , an interest-rate
strategist at Commerzbank AG in  London . “This pattern seems to
suggest that these policy-accommodation-removal concerns are
still weighing on the market.”  Germany ’s 10-year bund yield rose six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 1.73 percent at 5 p.m. London time after
reaching 1.74 percent, the highest since April 26, 2012. The
price of the 1.5 percent security due in May 2023 fell 0.54, or
5.40 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,312) face amount to 97.97. Ten-year yields headed for a  weekly  increase of 21 basis points, the
most since the five-day period ended Jan. 4.  ‘Alarming’ Yields  Greek 10-year bonds declined for a third day, pushing the
yield above 11 percent for the first time since May 2. The rate
advanced 64 basis points to 11.30 percent, after touching 11.64
percent, the highest level since April 29.  Greece’s Democratic Left, which holds 14 parliamentary
seats, has asked ministers and officials to resign their
government positions, it said in an e-mailed statement. The
remaining coalition partners New Democracy and Pasok have 153
seats in 300-seat chamber.  “The yield increase in peripherals is becoming alarming,”
 Peter Schaffrik , head of European interest-rate strategy at
Royal Bank of Canada in London, wrote in a note to clients. That
may prompt the European Central Bank to take some action, “at
least verbally,” he said.  Spain’s 10-year bond yield rose six basis points to 4.91
percent, after earlier falling nine basis points. The rate has
increased 33 basis points this week, the most since the period
ended Aug. 31, 2012.  Spanish 10-year yields have dropped from a euro-era  record 
7.75 percent set on July 25 and have returned 4.6 percent this
year through yesterday, according to the Bloomberg Spain
Sovereign Bond Index. The yield reached this year’s low of 3.94
percent on May 3.  Italy’s 10-year yield climbed seven basis points to 4.62
percent, while the rate on similar-maturity  French (GFRN10)  debt
increased as much as six basis points to 2.33 percent, the
highest since July 11, 2012.  German bonds handed investors a loss of 1.6 percent this
year through yesterday, according to Bloomberg  World Bond
Indexes. (BSPS)  Italian bonds earned 1.9 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
