Treasury yields declined from the
highest levels since 2011 amid speculation a selloff after
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said the Fed may slow
bond purchases this year was excessive.  U.S. government securities fluctuated as stocks rose.
Benchmark  10-year (USGG10YR)  yields had their biggest one-day jump this
week since October 2011 after Bernanke said June 19 the central
bank may end $85 billion in monthly bond purchases under
quantitative easing in mid-2014.  “We’ve had a pretty decent selloff, and it’s probably time
to put money in the bond market,” said Thomas di Galoma, head
of U.S. rates sales at ED&F Man Capital Markets in New York.
“Although a taper is not generally good for the market, the
economy is still struggling at 1.5 to 2 percent range in growth
and inflation is extremely low.”  The 10-year yield fell as much as four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 2.38 percent before rising one basis
point to 2.43 percent at 9:51 a.m. New York time, according to
Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 1.75 percent note due in May
2023 declined 1/8, or $1.25 per $1,000 face amount, to 94 2/32.
The yield surged 17 basis points on June 19 and reached 2.47
percent yesterday, the highest level since Aug. 8, 2011. It has
added 30 basis points this week, the most since July 2011.  The 30-year yield fell one basis point to 3.5 percent after
dropping as much as five basis points earlier. It rose 17 basis
points during the prior two days and reached 3.55 percent, the
highest since September 2011.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose for the first time in
three days, gaining 0.5 percent.  Bernanke Comments  Bernanke, speaking this week after a two-day meeting of the
Federal Open Market Committee, said reducing bond purchases
would depend on the economy achieving the central bank’s
objectives. Policy makers are forecasting growth of as much as
2.6 percent this year and 3.5 percent in 2014.  “There is an element of the Treasury market being
oversold,” said Soeren Moerch, head of fixed-income trading at
Danske Bank A/S in Copenhagen. “Bernanke’s comments turned out
to be more hawkish than many had anticipated, but he reiterated
it’s all data-dependent. The market seems to be taking a pause
to monitor the next round of economic numbers to see if there is
a strong ground for the Fed to turn off its liquidity tap.”  The Fed has been buying $45 billion of U.S. government debt
and $40 billion of mortgage securities each month to put
downward pressure on borrowing costs in its third round of asset
purchases. It will buy as much as $1.75 billion today of
Treasuries due from February 2036 to May 2043, according to the
Fed Bank of New York’s  website .  Interest Rate  The central bank has kept its  target rate  for overnight
lending between banks at zero to 0.25 percent since December
2008 to support the economy.  The Fed will cut its $85 billion in monthly bond purchases
by $20 billion at its Sept. 17-18 policy meeting, according to
44 percent of 54 economists surveyed by Bloomberg after
Bernanke’s June 19 press conference. In a June 4-5 survey, only
27 percent forecast tapering would start in September.  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch MOVE index climbed to 96.02 yesterday, the most
recent available data. It was the highest level since December
2011. The daily average this year is 60.8.  Trading  volume  has been rising, with the amount changing
hands through ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of U.S.
government debt, averaging $403 billion a day since the start of
May. That’s up from an average of $281 billion in the first four
months of the year. Volume climbed to $569 billion yesterday,
the highest since May 31.  U.S. Economy  Economic reports next week on U.S. home prices and durable
goods may add to the case for the Fed to curb stimulus.  Orders for  durable goods  rose 3 percent in May, expanding
for a second month, according to the median estimate of
economists in a Bloomberg News survey before the Commerce
Department on June 25. A separate report the same day will show
the  S&P/Case-Shiller (SPCS20Y%)  index of property values jumped 10.6
percent in April from a year earlier, the surveys show.  The Treasury will auction $35 billion in two-year notes on
June 25, an equal amount of five-year debt the following day and
$29 billion in seven-year securities on June 27.  To contact the reporters on this story:
