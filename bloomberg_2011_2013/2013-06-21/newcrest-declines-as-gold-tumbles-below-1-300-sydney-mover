Newcrest Mining Ltd. (NCM)  plunged to its
lowest in nine years in Sydney as Australian gold producers
declined after bullion tumbled to the lowest since 2010.  Newcrest, Australia’s biggest producer, fell 6.6 percent to
A$10.03, lowest since May 10, 2004 at 11:32 a.m. Local time.
 OceanaGold Corp. (OGC)  dropped 7.6 percent and  Alacer Gold Corp. (ASR)  slid
9 percent. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index fell 0.7 percent.  Gold tumbled below $1,300 an ounce, while the dollar headed
for a weekly gain against all of its 16 major peers after
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  this week said stimulus
may be reduced. Bullion has slumped 23 percent this year and is
heading for the biggest annual drop since 1981, as some
investors lose faith in gold as a protection of wealth.  Bernanke’s comments were “producing a U.S. dollar rally,
which is by nature a negative for the yellow metal,” said Anson Rosewall, an institutional dealer at BBY Ltd. in Sydney. “In
terms of gold stocks, the question is how many of these guys can
survive in an environment of unwinding central bank stimulus by
the Fed.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
