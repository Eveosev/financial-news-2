China’s fuel oil imports surged to
the  highest level  in five years last month as the country
boosted purchases from  Iran , customs data show.  Imports of the residual fuel, used by  power plants  and so-called teapot oil refineries, rose 19 percent to 2.83 million
tons from a month earlier, according to data e-mailed by the
General Administration of Customs in Beijing today. That’s the
most since May 2008. Shipments from Iran climbed to 526,203 tons
in May, the highest since February 2004 when Bloomberg started
tracking the data.  Iran ranked as China’s second-largest fuel oil supplier in
May after Russia, which shipped 632,078 tons, the data show.
 Singapore  was the third-biggest with 460,872 tons. Supplies from
Iran cost $609.98 a ton, compared with $629.49 from Singapore
and $685.75 from Russia, according to the data.  China bought a total of 804,034 tons of Iranian  fuel oil  in
the first  five months  of this year, compared with about 1,322
tons in 2012 and 428 tons in 2011.  The nation imported 2.4 million tons of  crude  from the
Persian Gulf country in May, 6.4 percent more than a year
earlier, the data shows. That’s the biggest volume since
December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
