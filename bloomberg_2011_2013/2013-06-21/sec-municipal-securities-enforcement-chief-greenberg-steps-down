Elaine Greenberg, head of the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement unit that polices
the $4 trillion municipal  securities market , is leaving the
agency for the private industry.  Greenberg, who joined the SEC’s Philadelphia regional
office in 1987, has led enforcement actions related to municipal
securities offerings against the states of  New Jersey  and
 Illinois  as well as the city of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, the
SEC said in a statement today.  “Elaine’s leadership of the unit and her efforts on behalf
of investors have been groundbreaking and have had a tremendous
impact on the behavior of participants in the municipal
securities and public pensions markets,” SEC Commissioner
Elisse Walter said in the statement.  Under her leadership, Greenberg’s unit also brought cases
over bid-rigging and pay-to-play schemes, the SEC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
