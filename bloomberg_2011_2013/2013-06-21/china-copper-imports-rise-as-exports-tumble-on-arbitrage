Imports of refined  copper  by  China ,
the biggest user, rebounded in May from the lowest level in
almost two years as the price difference between  Shanghai  and
 London  prompted traders to place orders.  Inbound shipments were 232,155 metric tons last month, data
from the General Administration of Customs showed today. That
compared with 183,023 tons in April and 301,990 tons a year ago,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Exports tumbled for a
second month to 14,445 tons from 29,072 tons a month earlier,
the data showed.  China’s manufacturing is shrinking at a faster pace in June,
as a preliminary reading of the Chinese Purchasing Managers’
Index by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics stood at 48.3,
indicating contraction. Copper prices in London fell to $6,692 a
ton earlier today, the lowest level in 20 months.  “Price differentials between London and Shanghai in April
were encouraging to arbitrage traders,” Jia Zheng, an analyst
at East Asia Futures Co., said by phone from Shanghai.
“Arrivals in June will probably be steady.”  Arbitrage traders buy copper in London at a lower price and
sell in Shanghai at a higher level. Metal for delivery in
October on the Shanghai Futures Exchange closed little changed
at 49,650  yuan  ($8,097) a ton at 3 p.m. local time, $90 higher
than the three-month contract on the London Metal Exchange at
$6,843.25 a ton, including a 17 percent value-added tax.  Copper-concentrate  imports  fell to 729,393 tons in May from
842,838 tons in April, customs data showed. That was the lowest
level since February, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Imports of scrap-copper climbed to 362,351 tons in May from
336,634 tons in April, with arrivals from the U.S. rising to
81,943 tons from 72,413 tons, according to today’s data.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
