Steel reinforcement-bar futures rose
on speculation government polices supporting purchases of first
homes and the fastest gain in property prices in two years will
stoke more construction.  Rebar for delivery in October on the  Shanghai  Futures
Exchange rose as much as 1.9 percent to 3,547  yuan  ($578) a
metric ton, erasing and earlier decline of 1.5 percent, and
traded at 3,518 yuan at 11:08 a.m. It fell 1.3 percent
yesterday, the first loss in six days, and is headed for a third
weekly gain.  China will support people seeking to buy their first homes
and authorities will boost credit support for industries the
government has defined as strategic or labor-intensive, the
State Council said June 19. New home prices in Beijing, Shanghai
and Guangzhou posted the biggest gains in May since at least
January 2011, official statistics released this week showed.  “The property sector is showing signs of strengthening
demand and government policies can be read as favoring housing
construction and therefore steel consumption,” Xia Caijun,
analyst at GF Futures Co., said by phone from Guangzhou.  Iron ore  prices for immediate delivery at Tianjin port in
 China  yesterday gained 0.5 percent to $120.60 a dry ton,
according to The Steel Index Ltd. The raw material is a key
ingredient for steel production.  The average  spot price  for rebar in China was unchanged at
3,387 yuan a ton yesterday, according to data from Beijing
Antaike Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
