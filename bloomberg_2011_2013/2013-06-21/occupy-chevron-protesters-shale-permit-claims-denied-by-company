Chevron Corp. (CVX)  said it has necessary
approvals to begin work on a shale-gas license in Poland after
protesters opposed to land being fenced off occupied the site.  “Chevron respects the right of individuals to express
their opinions within the law,” Grazyna Bukowska, a spokeswoman
for the U.S. oil business’s Polish subsidiary, said by e-mail.
“Our exploration program is progressing.”  Occupy Chevron (Poland) called for the second-largest U.S.
oil company to abandon its plans and leave the land, saying on
the group’s  website  that the producer hadn’t received approval
to build fences on the site in the village of Zurawlow. Calls by
Bloomberg to a phone number on the website went unanswered.  Chevron says Poland is key for regional operations, even as
 Talisman Energy Inc. (TLM)  exited last month and  Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO) 
said it was seeking ways to dispose of its 11 Polish licenses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
