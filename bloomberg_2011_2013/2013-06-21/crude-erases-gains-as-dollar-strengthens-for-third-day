West Texas Intermediate crude fell
to a two-week low as the dollar rose on expectations the  Federal
Reserve  will trim its monthly bond purchases in September and on
concern that China’s cash squeeze may curb its economic growth.  Prices capped the first weekly loss in three as the Dollar
Index reached a two-week high. About 44 percent of economists in
a Bloomberg survey June 19-20 saw the Fed tapering stimulus,
compared with 27 percent June 4-5. China’s one-day repurchase
rate touched a record yesterday, prompting speculation the
central bank was forced to pump liquidity.  “The dollar strength is definitely weighing on prices,”
said  John Kilduff , a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund that focuses on energy. “Crude oil is coming
down because the Fed is reducing its support. There is a lot of
concern over the situation in China and this potential
disruption within China’s banking system.”  WTI for August delivery dropped $1.45, or 1.5 percent, to
$93.69 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest
settlement since June 4. The volume of all futures traded was 19
percent above the 100-day average for the time of day at 2:55
p.m. The July contract expired yesterday after falling $2.84 to
$95.40, the biggest loss since Nov. 7. Front-month futures have
decreased 4.3 percent this week.  Brent for August settlement fell $1.24, or 1.2 percent, to
end the session at $100.91 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange. The European benchmark grade’s premium
over WTI widened to $7.22 from yesterday’s $7.01, the narrowest
since January 2011.  Dollar Climbs  The Dollar Index, which measures the greenback against six
other major currencies including the euro, increased as much as
0.7 percent to 82.524, the highest level since June 6. A
stronger dollar reduces oil’s appeal as an investment
alternative.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index trimmed gains to 0.2
percent after rising as much as 0.7 percent earlier.  “The dollar is king now and you are seeing crude falling
further,” said Bill Baruch, a senior market strategist at
Iitrader.com in  Chicago . “We are moving with the equities.”  The Fed will trim its monthly bond purchases to $65 billion
in September from the current $85 billion and end buying in June
2014, according to the plurality of estimates by economists in
the Bloomberg survey.  Bernanke, speaking on June 19 after a two-day meeting by
the  Federal Open Market Committee , said the Fed may begin
dialing down its unprecedented bond buying this year and end it
in mid-2014 if the economy achieves the Fed’s objectives. His
remarks sparked a selloff in global financial markets, with
stocks falling and bond yields rising for two days.  Bernanke’s Remarks  “We are still driven by Bernanke’s remarks,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group in
Chicago. “The dollar is the currency that everybody wants to
own for the short term and the stronger dollar is adding
pressure on oil.”  The People’s Bank of China used reverse-repurchase
agreements to inject funds into selected banks, Hexun reported
today, citing an unidentified person close to the central bank.
The total was less than 400 billion  yuan  ($65 billion), the
financial news website said.  China’s net exports of  diesel  dropped to the lowest level
in seven months as  Asia ’s largest oil refiner exhausted its
export quota and faced the weakest oil consumption in nine
months.  Chinese Consumption  Overseas sales of diesel exceeded imports by 177,004 metric
tons in May, according to data e-mailed by the General
Administration of Customs. That’s equivalent to 42,600 barrels a
day and is the lowest level since October, when net exports
declined to 107,277 tons, data compiled by Bloomberg shows.  The country’s apparent oil demand, or domestic refinery
output plus net import of refined oil, was 9.53 million barrels
a day last month, the weakest since August, customs data showed.  “If  China  is not going to consume oil as they have been,
there is no reason for oil to hit the $100 level,” Baruch said
about WTI crude.  The U.S. and China, the world’s two largest oil-consuming
countries, accounted for about a third of total global demand in
2012, according to  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Statistical Review of World Energy.  In the U.S., crude inventories climbed 313,000 barrels to
394.1 million in the week ended June 14, the Energy Information
Administration reported on June 19. Stockpiles reached an 82-year high of 397.6 million on May 24.  ‘Further Weakness’  “The oil market is vulnerable to further weakness due to a
lack of physical tightness, particularly in the U.S.,” said  Tim Evans , an energy analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in  New
York , in an e-mail.  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
August was 21.8 percent, up from 21.4 percent yesterday, data
compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 612,605
contracts as of 2:55 p.m. It totaled 812,238 contracts
yesterday, 33 percent higher than the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.84 million contracts.  To contact the reporters on this story:
