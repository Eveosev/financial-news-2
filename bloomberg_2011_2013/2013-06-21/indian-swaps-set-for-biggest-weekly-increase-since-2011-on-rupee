India ’s one-year  interest-rate swaps 
completed the biggest weekly jump since October 2011 on concern
the rupee’s slide to a record low will limit room for the
central bank to cut  interest rates .  The local currency touched an all-time low of 59.98 per
dollar yesterday after the U.S. signaled it may reduce stimulus
policies that have boosted fund flows into  emerging markets . A
weaker rupee increases the cost of imported goods including oil,
boosting the risk of faster price increases. The  Reserve Bank  of
India refrained from cutting borrowing costs on June 17 for the
first time in four reviews, citing inflation risks.  “The currency’s depreciation is pushing back rate-cut
expectations,” Vivek Rajpal, a strategist at Nomura Singapore
Ltd., said in a phone interview today. “That is pushing up swap
rates.”  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, climbed 21 basis
points, or 0.21 percentage point, this week to 7.43 percent in
Mumbai, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That is the biggest
weekly increase since October 2011. The rate fell three basis
points today.  RBI Governor Duvvuri Subbarao held the  repurchase rate  at
7.25 percent on June 17 after cutting by 75 basis points this
year. The RBI will next review policy on July 30. Asia’s third-largest economy grew 5 percent in the year ended March 31, the
least in a decade, official data show.  Bonds Decline  Government bonds  completed a second weekly decline. The
yield on 8.15 percent government bonds due June 2022 rose eight
basis points this week to 7.62 percent, according to the central
bank’s trading system.  The rate fell two basis points today after the  finance
ministry  auctioned 150 billion rupees ($2.5 billion) of notes
due in 2019, 2023, 2030 and 2041 as planned.  Global funds cut  holdings  of rupee bonds by $3.9 billion
this month as the local currency fell. An offering of debt-purchase permits to foreigners was undersubscribed yesterday for
the first time since October.  India sold limits worth 392 billion rupees to overseas
investors yesterday, compared with a target of 420.22 billion
rupees, according to two people familiar with the matter, asking
not to be identified as they aren’t authorized to speak to the
media.  To contact the reporter on this story:
