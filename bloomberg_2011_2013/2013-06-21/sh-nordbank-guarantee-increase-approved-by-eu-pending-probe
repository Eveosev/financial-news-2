HSH Nordbank AG, the world’s largest
shipping lender, won provisional approval from the European
Commission for the restoration of a 10 billion-euro ($13.2
billion) guarantee from the German states of Hamburg and
Schleswig-Holstein, pending an in-depth probe into the measure.  The Brussels-based commission  said  it will investigate
whether the plan to increase the guarantee from 7 billion euros
is in line with European Union state-aid rules.  “The commission has doubts about whether, given changed
market circumstances, the restoring of the guarantee is still
covered by its earlier decision and whether it is appropriate,”
it said in an e-mailed statement today. During the principal
investigation procedure, it “will examine in detail to what
extent the measure is compatible with the aid rules.”  Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein, which control the bank,
welcomed the preliminary approval, saying it will strengthen HSH
Nordbank’s capital ratio and give the lender more time to
restructure its business.  HSH Nordbank is trying to reduce bad loans to shipping
clients struggling to service their debt amid a slump in demand,
overcapacity of vessels and low freight rates that is crippling
operators.  Shipping loans make up 27 billion euros of the lender’s 125
billion-euro portfolio, Chief Executive Officer Constantin von Oesterreich said on May 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
