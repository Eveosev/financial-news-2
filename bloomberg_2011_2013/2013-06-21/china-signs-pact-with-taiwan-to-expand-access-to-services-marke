China  and  Taiwan , governed
separately since a civil war six-decades ago, agreed to give
each others companies greater access to their services markets
as commercial ties deepen across the  Taiwan Strait .  The agreement allows Taiwanese companies to take
controlling stakes in China joint ventures, streamline approvals
and expand geographic operations in sectors including banking,
hospitals, construction and tourism, according to the text of
the pact posted on Taiwan’s Straits Exchange Foundation website.
It was signed today in  Shanghai  by the heads of the SEF and
China’s Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits.  Economic ties have surged since Ma Ying-jeou became
Taiwan’s president in 2008 and instituted policies to build
relations with China. The sides in 2010 signed the Economic
Cooperation Framework Agreement, or ECFA, which has paved the
way for other pacts including one for investment protection
reached last year, today’s services accord and another for
agricultural and industrial goods still under discussion.  Today’s agreement “marks the first significant progress in
the expansion of cross-strait commercial ties” since ECFA,
 Peter Kurz , head of Taiwan research at Citigroup Inc., wrote in
a June 18 report. The financial industry will be the biggest
beneficiaries, he wrote.  The services agreement signed today ratifies measures
announced earlier that allow Chinese investors to hold larger
stakes in Taiwan banks and establish pilot areas in which
Taiwanese brokerages can hold controlling shares in China
ventures, according to Kurz.  To contact the reporter on this story:
