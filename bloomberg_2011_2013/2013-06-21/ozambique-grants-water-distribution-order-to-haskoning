Two Dutch companies, Royal
HaskoningDHV and Vitens Evides International, will develop a new
water distribution system for Mozambique’s capital of Maputo to
supply drinking water to about 550,000 residents.  Design works are planned to be completed in April with
construction to start at the end of 2014, HaskoningDHV, an
Amersfoort, Netherlands-based project management and engineering
consultant, said on its  website . The contract for the venture
partners is 2.2 million euros ($2.9 million).  The water system for Maputo will be part of a project
funded by $130 million from the  World Bank  that will initially
supply 60,000 cubic meters of treated drinking water a day to
the capital from Corumana Dam, HaskoningDHV said. Capacity will
double in a second phase to 120,000 cubic meters a day, it said.  “The new system will improve drinking water quality and
quantity, and will reduce the costs per liter for the
inhabitants that now depend on unreliable sources,” Bob Bakker,
HaskoningDHV project director, said in the statement.  “As well as helping to improve existing living conditions,
the system will be future-proofed to accommodate Maputo’s
rapidly growing population,” Bakker said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
