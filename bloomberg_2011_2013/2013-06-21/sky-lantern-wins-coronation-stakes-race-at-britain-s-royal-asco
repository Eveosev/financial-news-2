Sky Lantern, the joint favorite, won
the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot.  Ridden by jockey Richard Hughes, the filly came from the
back of the 17 horses in the race, the biggest event on today’s
schedule. She is trained by Richard Hannon.  Sky Lantern was the 9-2 joint favorite with Big Break,
which didn’t place.  France ’s Kenhope was second, with Irish
Guineas winner Just The Judge placing third.  Five-day Royal Ascot, held in Berkshire west of  London , is
Britain’s richest race meeting, with prize money of 4.5 million
pounds ($6.9 million).  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
