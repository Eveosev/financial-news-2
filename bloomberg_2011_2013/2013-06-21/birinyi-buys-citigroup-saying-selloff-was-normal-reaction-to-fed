The selloff that pushed the  Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  down almost 4 percent was a “normal
correction” amid evolving Federal Reserve policy and created
opportunities in bank stocks, according to Laszlo Birinyi.  Birinyi, among the first to advise buying shares before the
bull market began in 2009, bought  Citigroup Inc. (C)  and Goldman
Sachs Group this week, he said in an interview with  Trish Regan 
and Tom Keene on Bloomberg Television’s “Street Smart.”  “To me this is just a normal correction reacting to some
unexpected news,” Birinyi, president of Birinyi Associates
Inc., said. “I still think you’re in a  bull market .”  Goldman Sachs declined 0.1 percent to $155.23 at 3:27 p.m.
New York time today, while Citigroup sank 1.8 percent to $47.03.
Birinyi said he isn’t buying  Bank of America Corp. , which
slipped 1.1 percent to $12.75.  The S&P 500 dropped 3.9 percent June 19 and 20 after Fed
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said he may start tapering a bond-buying program meant to stimulate the economy. While the
benchmark gauge for U.S. equity is down 4.3 percent since the
all-time high May 21, it’s gained 136 percent since the 12-year
low in March 2009.  Birinyi said he’s betting against gold-mining companies by
selling short shares of Newmont Mining and Barrick Gold Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
