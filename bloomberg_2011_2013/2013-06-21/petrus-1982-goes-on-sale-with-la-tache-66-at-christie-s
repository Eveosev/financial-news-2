A case of Chateau Petrus 1982
Pomerol carries a top estimate of 50,000 euros ($67,000) at a
Christie’s International Plc sale in Paris this month alongside
2005 wines from neighboring Chateau Le Pin and 1960s Burgundies.  A 12-bottle lot of Le Pin is priced to fetch as much as
27,000 euros while three cases of Domaine de la Romanee-Conti
1966 La Tache Burgundy are estimated at as much as 24,000 euros
each, according to Christie’s online catalog.  The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index of top Bordeaux vintages has
risen 5 percent this year, with a 3 percent decline since mid-March following a gain of 8 percent in the previous 10 weeks.
Price cuts on Bordeaux 2012 futures over the past two months
have weighed on the broader wine market.  “We’re seeing a slight strengthening of prices,” said
David Elswood, International Director of Wine in Europe and Asia
at Christie’s in  London . “Bordeaux’s returning.”  The average price for Petrus 1982 at auctions last month
was $67,800, down from $71,000 at the end of last year,
according to data compiled by London-based Liv-ex on its Cellar
Watch website. A case fetched as much as $86,500, including
fees, at Christie’s in Hong Kong on May 25.  A half-case of Echezeaux 1989 Cote de Nuits Grand Cru from
producer Henri Jayer is estimated to fetch as much as 22,000
euros while a magnum of Chateau Mouton-Rothschild 1945 is priced
in the sale to fetch as much as 18,000 euros.  Among historic wines in the sale, a lot comprising four
bottles of Chateau Mouton-Rothschild from separate nineteenth-century vintages back to 1865 carries a top estimate of as much
as 60,000 euros, while a magnum of the same estate’s 1945 wine
is priced at as much as 18,000 euros.  Here is a list of global wine auctions scheduled so far
