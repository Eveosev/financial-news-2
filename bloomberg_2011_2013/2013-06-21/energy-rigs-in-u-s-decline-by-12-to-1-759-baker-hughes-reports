Oil and gas rigs in the U.S. fell by
12 this week to 1,759, according to  Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI)   Oil rigs  slipped by eight to 1,405, data posted on Baker
Hughes’ website show. The  gas count  decreased by four to 349,
the Houston-based field-services company said.  Energy rigs  in the U.S. have fallen this month after five
straight quarters of declines. The count is set to rebound this
year as producers respond to an increase in oil an natural gas
prices, according to London-based  Barclays Plc. (BARC)   “While we believe a material increase in activity
throughout the major gas basins would likely require sustained
prices above the $5 level, we do not expect this to materialize
this year,” James C. West, an oil services and drilling analyst
at Barclays’ investment-banking unit in New York, said in a
research note June 17. “However, we continue to believe that
current levels are supportive of an uptick in activity in low
cost gas basins.”  Natural gas for July delivery slid 8.1 cents, or 2.1
percent, to $3.796 per million British thermal units on the New
York Mercantile Exchange at 1:25 p.m. New York time, up 49
percent from a year ago.  U.S. gas stockpiles  expanded by 91 billion cubic feet in
the week ended June 14 to 2.438 trillion cubic feet, down 19
percent from year-earlier inventories, the Energy Information
Administration, the Energy Department’s statistical arm, said
yesterday. Supply increases have exceeded the five-year average
for three consecutive weeks.  Crude Production  U.S. oil output fell a second week, slipping 1.3 percent to
7.13 million barrels a day last week, EIA data show. Production
reached 7.37 million barrels a day in the week ended May 3, the
most since 1992. Stockpiles gained 313,000 barrels to 394.1
million, according to the EIA.  Crude for August delivery tumbled $1.41, or 1.5 percent, to
$93.73 a barrel today on the Nymex. Prices have gained 2.2
percent this year.  The number of permits issued for drilling in the U.S. Gulf
slowed in the first five months of 2013, with 54 issued for new
wells, down from 91 a year ago, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , Tana Exploration and LLOG
Exploration have been issued the most permits this year for
drilling in the Gulf, according to a June 18 Bloomberg
Industries analysis.  Oil output from North Dakota’s Bakken formation, the
largest U.S. shale play,  gained  to a record 727,149 barrels a
day in April, according to preliminary data compiled by the
state Industrial Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
