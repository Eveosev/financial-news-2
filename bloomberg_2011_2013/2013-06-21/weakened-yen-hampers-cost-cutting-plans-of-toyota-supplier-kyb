KYB Corp., a Japanese supplier to
companies including  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  and  Hitachi Construction
Machinery Co. (6305) , said the yen’s slide is making imported parts
from Asia more expensive, hampering efforts to pare purchasing
costs.  Using parts from outside  Japan  won’t provide much of a
benefit should the currency remain at current levels of 95 yen
to 100 yen per dollar, Executive Officer Masao Ono said June 19
in an interview in Tokyo. KYB, which aims to reduce costs 15
percent by March 2015, will seek other ways to economize,
including having its factories in  North America  and  Europe  use
components from suppliers in Asia.  The yen’s 13 percent decline since Prime Minister Shinzo
Abe’s election victory on Dec. 16 is undermining cost reductions
at Tokyo-based KYB as the company faces pressure from customers
to reduce its product prices. The yen has weakened the most
among Group of 10 currencies in the past six months, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The yen depreciated at a fast pace just when we outlined
a plan to import overseas-made parts,” Ono said.  KYB holds a 40 percent global share of excavator cylinders,
selling to customers such as Caterpillar Inc. It’s also the
nation’s biggest maker of car shock absorbers.  Yen Benefits  While KYB faces higher-than-expected costs, the weaker yen
also benefits business by boosting the value of overseas sales,
Senior Executive Officer Yasusuke Nakajima said in the interview.
The company forecast  profit  will increase 28 percent to 10
billion yen ($103 million) in the financial year to March 31
after a 44 percent decline in the previous year.  Imports from  China , Taiwan and  South Korea  accounted for
2.5 percent of KYB’s total purchases last year. Customers are
asking for a 15 percent price cut over the three-year period
through March 2015, according to Nakajima.  The company’s plan was to double imports to 3 percent of
total purchasing costs in the year ended March 31, increasing
that to about 10 percent in three years, Ono said.  The yen, which traded at 97.27 yen to the dollar as of 9:15
a.m. in Tokyo, fell as low as 103.74 yen on May 22, the weakest
since October 2008.  Despite the weakening yen, domestic manufacturers won’t
stop shifting production into Asia and other growing economies
to tap market growth, Nakajima said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
