Al Noor Hospitals Group Plc raised
221 million pounds ($342 million) in the United Arab Emirates’
first initial public offering this year as the Abu Dhabi-based
provider of health-care services seeks funds to expand.  Al Noor sold 38.5 million new and existing shares, or 32.9
percent of its equity, at 575 pence each, it said in an e-mailed
statement today. The sale, which led to a  London  Stock Exchange
listing, was managed by  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. and  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  and raised 97 million pounds in new
money for Al Noor, it said. The shares, which started
conditional trading today, gained 0.4 percent to 577 pence at
11:04 a.m. in London.  The money will help the group expand in Abu Dhabi and fund
its “entry into other key emirates and the wider Gulf
Cooperation Council,” Kassem Alom, Al Noor’s chief executive
officer, said in the statement. Plans “include the development
of existing hospitals, growing our network of outpatient medical
centres and pursuing organic and acquisition growth.”  Shares of Abu Dhabi-based  NMC Health Plc (NMC) , which raised 117
million pounds in 2012 in an IPO on the LSE, have surged 51
percent in 2013, outpacing a 38 percent advance for  Abu Dhabi ’s
benchmark stock index. Al Noor has the biggest market share
among private health-care services providers in Abu Dhabi for
both outpatients and inpatients, according to the company.
Profit last year climbed 19 percent to $60.5 million.  Potential Acquisitions  The U.A.E.’s stock markets are soaring this year amid an
economic recovery after the global credit crisis curbed the
demand for riskier assets. Abu Dhabi’s  benchmark index  is the
fourth-best performing gauge among 94 tracked by Bloomberg
globally, while Dubai’s  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  is the third.  Al Noor has identified a specialty center and a group of
medical facilities for potential acquisitions valued at about
$50 million, it said in a statement last month. The group will
use cash in hand and $75 million of IPO proceeds to repay a loan
of about $118.1 million, it said at the time.  Dubai-based private equity company Ithmar Capital will
retain a 28 percent stake in Al Noor after selling some shares
in the offering, today’s statement said. Ithmar bought a stake
in Al Noor in June 2010 as part of a plan to invest 1 billion
dirhams ($272 million) in the health-care industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
