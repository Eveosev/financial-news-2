Copper pared a third weekly drop,
rebounding from the lowest level in 20 months, after  China ’s
central bank was said to have made funds available to lenders
amid a cash squeeze.  Copper for delivery in three months rose as much as 0.7
percent to $6,817 a metric ton on the  London  Metal Exchange,
after dropping to $6,692, the lowest since October 2011. It
traded at $6,797.25 at 10:40 a.m. in  Shanghai  and has retreated
4.1 percent this week. The LME Index of six primary base metals
retreated 2.5 percent yesterday to 2,947.2, the lowest since
July 2010.  China’s benchmark money-market rates retreated from records
after the central bank was said to have made funds available to
lenders amid a cash squeeze. The  S&P 500  declined by the most
since November 2011 yesterday, while the dollar headed for a
weekly gain against all of its 16 major peers as Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said on June 19 the central bank may
start dialing down its stimulus effort this year.  “LME copper has reached a key technical level, and there
should be some tentative buying,” Liang Lijuan, an analyst at
COFCO Futures Co., said by phone from Beijing. “An effective
breach of $6,600-$6,700 could lead to another $1,000 fall, so
people are asking themselves whether this is justified.”  Aluminum in London climbed 0.4 percent to $1,805 a ton
after dropping for 11 straight sessions to the lowest level
since 2009 as stockpiles monitored by the LME rose to a record
yesterday. Nickel, zinc and lead climbed.  Copper for delivery in October on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange dropped 0.8 percent to 49,340  yuan  ($8,048) a ton. The
September futures contract on the Comex rose 0.4 percent to
$3.085 per pound.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
