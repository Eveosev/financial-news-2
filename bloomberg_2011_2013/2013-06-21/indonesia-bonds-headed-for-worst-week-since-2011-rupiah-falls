Indonesia ’s bonds completed their
worst week since November 2011 and the rupiah declined on
concern the  Federal Reserve  will taper its stimulus program,
damping appetite for emerging-market assets.  Overseas investors pulled 17.3 trillion rupiah ($1.7
billion) from local-currency sovereign  debt  this month through
June 18, poised for the biggest monthly outflow since September
2011, finance ministry data show. Indonesia may announce a
decision on fuel-price increases tonight, which the government
took into account when it raised its inflation estimate to 7.2
percent in the revised budget from 4.9 percent previously.
Inflation has averaged 6 percent in the last six years.  “This global issue has a significant impact on Indonesian
assets as the degree of freedom for investors to step in and out
of the country is relatively high,” said Leo Rinaldy, an
economist at PT Mandiri Sekuritas in Jakarta. “We will see the
impact of the fuel-price hike on the rupiah after the external
turbulence wanes.”  The yield on the 5.625 percent bonds due May 2023 climbed
48 basis points this week, the most since the five days ended
Nov. 25, 2011, to 6.91 percent as of 4:22 p.m. in Jakarta,
prices from the Inter Dealer Market Association show. The yield
rose four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, today and was
at the highest since October 2011.  Bank Indonesia  will give yields room to rise, after buying
1.2 trillion rupiah of government notes in the secondary market
yesterday, Deputy Governor Perry Warjiyo told reporters in
Jakarta today. The central bank is always ready to continue dual
intervention until conditions have calmed, he said.  The Fed may curtail monthly bond purchases later this year
and halt the program around mid-2014 if the economy performs in
line with its projections, Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said this
week.  Rupiah Drops  The cost of insuring Indonesian debt against default using
five-year  credit-default swaps  rose 75 basis points this week to
267 yesterday, the highest level since October 2011, according
to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices
quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  Indonesia will announce a decision on fuel-price increases
tonight, which will take effect at midnight, Energy and Mineral
Resources Minister Jero Wacik told reporters today. The rise
will reduce oil imports, improve the  trade balance  and boost the
rupiah to meet the 2013 state budget assumption for an average
rate of 9,600 per dollar, Finance Minister Chatib Basri said in
a June 19 interview.  Foreign Investors  “The timing of this fuel-price hike is unfortunate as
foreign investors are focused on sentiment rather than the
structural improvement in Indonesia,” said Rinaldy, who
forecast the rupiah will trade at 9,780 by the end of the year.  The rupiah declined for a sixth week, losing 0.6 percent to
9,930 per dollar, prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg
show. It traded at a 4 percent premium to one-month non-deliverable forwards, which slid 2.8 percent to 10,345, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, climbed 2.08
percentage points this week and 33 basis points today to 15.67
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
