Temperatures are expected to push
into the 90s from Chicago to Boston, including New York, during
the next five days, said  Matt Rogers , president of Commodity
Weather Group LLC.  Readings may be at least 5 degrees Fahrenheit (2.8 Celsius)
above normal today until June 25 from Nebraska to the Canadian
Maritimes, said Rogers, in Bethesda,  Maryland .  “We have Boston and New York City in the low 90s at the
peak of the event” early next week, he said.  Above-average temperatures in large population areas of the
East and Midwest can spur natural gas demand as more people turn
to air conditioning to keep cool.  Power plants  will account for
32 percent of U.S. gas consumption this year, Energy Information
Administration data show.  Temperatures in New York’s Central Park are expected to
reach 90 on June 24 and June 25, according to the  National
Weather Service . In Boston’s Back Bay, readings may climb to 90
on June 25.  Chicago may peak at 91 on June 23 and Washington is likely
to reach that mark from June 23 to 25, the weather service said.
Montreal may top out at 91 on June 25, according to Environment
Canada.  Temperatures in the eastern U.S. and Canada are expected to
fall to seasonal ranges from June 26 to June 30, Rogers said.  The normal average reading for June 26 in  New York City  is
about 75 degrees, according to  MDA Weather Services  in
Gaithersburg, Maryland. In Boston, it’s 71; in Chicago, 73; in
Houston, 84; in  St. Louis , 79; and in Burbank, California, 72.  To contact the reporter on this story:
