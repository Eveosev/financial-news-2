Gold rose from the lowest since 2010
on speculation that the slump may spur purchases. The metal had
its worst week since April after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  said the bank may curb its stimulus.  Prices slid 6.4 percent yesterday, a day after Bernanke
said the central bank may start reducing $85 billion in monthly
debt buying this year and end the program in 2014. The metal
touched $1,268.70 an ounce earlier today, the cheapest since
Sept. 16, 2010. Physical demand was “again aggressive
yesterday, and overnight, in  Europe ,” according to Kitco Metals
Inc. a precious-metal refiner and research company in  Montreal .  Bullion has fallen 23 percent this year, heading for the
biggest annual drop since 1981, as some investors lose faith in
it as a store of value and speculation grew that the Fed will
taper debt-buying that helped fuel a 12-year bull run through
last year.  “There’s always physical demand that might come in a bit
stronger, considering the move we had,” Marc Ground, a
commodity strategist at Standard Bank Plc in Johannesburg, said
by telephone. “I don’t think we’ll get back to where we were
anytime soon. The gold market is getting used to the idea that
liquidity won’t be as forthcoming anymore.”  Gold Price  Gold futures for August delivery added 0.5 percent to
settle at $1,292 at 1:49 p.m. on the Comex in  New York . Prices
tumbled 6.9 percent this week.  CME Group Inc., owner of the Comex, increased the
exchange’s margin requirements for gold, making it more
expensive for speculators to trade. CME said yesterday the
minimum cash deposit for futures will rise 25 percent to $8,800
per 100-ounce contract at today’s close.  “The trend has been and will continue to be lower until
the central banks of the world extricate themselves from the
forefront of market thought,” Carlos Perez-Santalla, a broker
at Marex North America LLC, said in an e-mailed report. “Gold
will remain under pressure.”  Bullion entered a  bear market  in April, extending the
retreat from its all-time high of $1,923.70 in September 2011.
Global  holdings  in exchange-traded products fell 5.1 metric tons
to 2,106.1 tons yesterday, the lowest since March 2011, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Price Slump  “The worst of the current round of decline is probably
behind us, as gold prices may stabilize and rebound,” Jeffrey Christian, managing partner at CPM, said in an interview in
Zhaoyuan,  China , today. “It’s going to be very important to see
in the next few days how enthusiastic investors are. If they
signal they are waiting for still lower prices, that will be
very negative.”  The slump in gold prices triggered a drop in related
equities.  Newcrest Mining Ltd. (NCM) ,  Australia ’s biggest producer,
slid 3.7 percent in Sydney, taking this year’s loss to 53
percent. It said this month it will write down the value of its
assets by as much as A$6 billion ($5.5 billion) after prices
slid.  The  Standard & Poor’s GSCI (SPGSCI)  gauge of 24 commodities dropped
5.6 percent since the end of December, the MSCI All-Country
World Index of equities rose 3.4 percent and the U.S. Dollar
Index added 3.2 percent. A Bank of America Corp. index shows
Treasuries lost 2.4 percent.  Silver futures for July delivery gained 0.7 percent to
$19.959 an ounce in New York, after falling to $19.31, the
lowest since August 2010. It retreated 9.1 percent this week,
the biggest drop since April. An ounce of gold bought as much as
65.55 ounces of silver in  London , the most since August 2010.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
July delivery climbed 0.4 percent to $1,369.50 an ounce,
narrowing the weekly loss to 5.4 percent. Trading volume was 87
