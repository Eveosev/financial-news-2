Peru ’s sol strengthened for the
first time in five days after the central bank intervened
yesterday by selling dollar-indexed certificates.  The sol appreciated 0.4 percent to 2.7830 per  U.S. dollar 
at today’s close, according to prices from Datatec. The advance
pared the currency’s weekly decline to 2.2 percent.  “The central bank provided liquidity, which calmed the
market, and that’s what we’re seeing today,” said Antonio Diaz,
a trader at Banco Internacional del Peru SAA in Lima. “It sent
a good signal to the market.”  Banco Central de Reserva del Peru sold 779 million soles
($280 million) in dollar-linked contracts yesterday, the highest
daily amount this year. The sol plunged 1.5 percent yesterday to
a two year low of 2.7930 after the U.S. Federal Reserve said it
may start paring a stimulus program this year, triggering a
selloff in emerging-market assets.  Peru’s central bank offered to sell 300 million soles of
the certificates today but didn’t find any takers, according to
its website.  The yield on Peru’s benchmark local-currency bonds due
August 2020 increased nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage
point, to 5.57 percent today, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The price slid 0.58 centimo to 113.17 centimos per
sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
