At first glance, the Pacific Palisades home is classic — a comfortable mansion appropriately priced for the area, but it doesn't look like the home belonging to an actor like Tom Hanks. That's because the home at  956 Corsica Dr, Pacific Palisades, CA 90272  is just one of three properties the veteran actor owns in the area with wife Rita Wilson. The couple bought a more spectacular (and star-worthy) contemporary home three years ago for $26 million. They also own another property that they picked up in 2010 for $1.45 million, and a prime Malibu Colony home that they bought in 1991. The couple bought this home earlier in their acting careers in 1988, right on the heels of Hanks' Oscar nomination for "Big." Hanks was just coming into his own as a Hollywood star, after his roles in "Splash," "The Money Pit" and "Dragnet." Today, a string of popular movies include his name on the credits. Hanks and Wilson appeared in "Sleepless in Seattle" together in 1993. Hanks' Pacific Palisades home is described as a "legendary villa" hidden behind privacy walls and hedges. Built in 1929, the classic house has decorated archways and frescoed ceilings with chandeliers. The highlight of the home is the many loggias and patios — each surrounded by lush greenery and gardens. The Spanish-style home measures 6,289 square feet with 4 bedrooms and 5.5 baths. The master suite includes a fireplace, private beauty salon and opens up to a terrace with ocean views.
