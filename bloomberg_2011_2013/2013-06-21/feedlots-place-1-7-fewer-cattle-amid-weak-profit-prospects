U.S. feedlots reduced the number of
cattle added to their herds in May by 1.7 percent, a smaller
decline than analysts projected, amid weak profit prospects.  About 2.049 million  head  of cattle were moved into feedlots
last month, compared with 2.084 million in May 2012, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said today in a report. Twelve
analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News  projected a 5.3 percent
drop, on average. The feedlot herd totaled 10.736 million as of
June 1, down 3.1 percent from a year earlier. Analysts expected
a 3.6 percent decline.  For the month of May, feedlots were losing $145 per head,
according to  Rich Nelson , chief strategist at Allendale Inc. in
McHenry,  Illinois , who cited USDA data. High costs for animals
and higher-than-expected feed prices contributed to the losses,
said Elaine Johnson, an analyst at Cattlehedging.com.  “Overall, the numbers were down just because the losses at
the feedlot level are kind of concerning,” Johnson, based in
Westminster,  Colorado , said in an interview before the report.
“The placements a year ago were big, and we’re just not seeing
that this year.”  Feedlot operators typically buy year-old cattle that weigh
about 500 pounds (227 kilograms) to 800 pounds, called feeders.
The animals are fattened on corn until they weigh about 1,300
pounds, when they are sold to meatpackers.  Feedlots sold 1.948 million animals to meatpackers last
month, down 3.4 percent from a year earlier and the second-lowest level for the month of May since the data series began in
1996, according to USDA. Analysts expected a 1.9 percent slide,
on average.  Cattle futures for August delivery rose 0.3 percent to
$1.20325 a pound at 9:45 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. The price declined 9.3 percent this year through
yesterday.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement climbed 0.3
percent to $1.448 a pound. The commodity slumped 6.4 percent
this year through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
