Dish Network Corp. (DISH)  said it’s
dropping a bid to buy  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) , a day after the
target company raised an offer for  Clearwire Corp. (CLWR)   Dish will also redeem senior notes maturing in 2017 and
2023 as a result of abandoning the transaction, the Englewood,
Colorado-based company said today in a statement.  Dish is also bidding for Clearwire as part of a broader
struggle between the pay-television company and Tokyo-based
 SoftBank Corp. (9984)  to enter the U.S. wireless market. Sprint
rejected Dish’s unsolicited offer earlier in June.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
