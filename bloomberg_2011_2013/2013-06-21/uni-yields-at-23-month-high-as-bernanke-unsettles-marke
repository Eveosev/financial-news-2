Yields in the $3.7 trillion
municipal-bond market rose to the highest in almost two years,
following U.S. Treasuries, amid concern that the  Federal Reserve 
will halt monthly debt purchases by the middle of 2014.  The yield on general-obligation munis maturing in 20 years
rose 0.21 percentage point to 4.37 percent this week, the
highest since July 28, 2011, according to Bond Buyer Index data.
The index has jumped 0.44 percentage point in the past two
weeks, the biggest increase since January 2011. Bonds in the
index have an average Moody’s Investors Service rating of Aa2,
third-highest.  Investors pulled $2.2 billion from muni-bond mutual funds
this week, Lipper US Fund Flows data show, the heaviest outflow
this year, as a Bloomberg survey of 54 economists said the
Federal Reserve will end buying by June 2014. More than $5
billion was drained from funds in the past three weeks,
according to Lipper.  Comments this week by Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  on the central bank’s outlook “sent munis into a
tailspin,” said Dan Toboja, vice president of municipal trading
at Ziegler Capital Markets in  Chicago .  Rising yields and continued outflows have left the market
“in a state of disarray,” he said in an e-mail.  Interest rates  on top-rated munis maturing in 10 years rose
about 0.05 percentage point to 2.46 percent as of 1 p.m. in  New
York , data compiled by Bloomberg show. That is the highest since
November 2011. The yield on similar maturity Treasuries has
surged 0.36 percentage point this week, the most since August
2009.  States and cities are poised to sell $8.4 billion in debt
next week, including a $1.3 billion general-obligation bond sale
by  Illinois , its biggest since May 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
