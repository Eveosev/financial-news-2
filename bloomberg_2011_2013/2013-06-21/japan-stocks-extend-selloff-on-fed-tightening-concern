Japanese  stocks  advanced, erasing
earlier declines, as exporters rebounded after the yen weakened.
Shares earlier followed U.S. stocks lower amid continued concern
about the potential for tighter monetary conditions in the
world’s largest economy.  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , a carmaker that gets 47 percent of sales
in  North America , swung to a 2 percent gain from a 3 percent
loss as the yen fell.  Dowa Holdings Co. (5714) ,  Japan ’s biggest silver
producer, soared 8.5 percent after Bank of America Merrill Lynch
recommended its shares.  Kirin Holdings Co. (2503) , Sumitomo Electric
Industries Ltd. and Central Japan Railway Co. dropped at least
2.4 percent after surging before the close yesterday.  The Topix index added 0.7 percent to close at 1,099.40 in
 Tokyo  after retreating as much as 2.9 percent. The gauge rose
4.1 percent this week, the first weekly advance in a month.  The
Nikkei 225 Stock Average climbed 1.7 percent to 13,230.13, after
sliding to as low as 12,702.67.  “Once the Nikkei drops below 13,000, the market tends to
stop falling,” said  Gentoku Kiyokawa , Tokyo-based head of
Japanese  investment management  at BNP Paribas Investment
Partners, which oversees the equivalent of $647 billion.
“Japanese stocks seem almost done with the correction. They
started falling first and have declined the most.”  The Topix has fallen about 14 percent from an almost five-year high on May 22 after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s growth
strategy disappointed investors and amid concern global stimulus
will be cut. The gauge is still up 28 percent this year.  Volatility Continues  Japan’s broader equity measure has swung an average of
about 3.2 percent daily since May 22. The Topix’s 30-day
historic  volatility  was at 40.84 today, near its highest level
since the 2011 earthquake and tsunami.  Volume on the Topix was about 24 percent below the 30-day
average. Low volume amplifies price swings, said  Yutaka Miura , a
senior technical analyst at Mizuho Securities Co., a unit of
Japan’s third-biggest lender by market value.  “We’re not going to see big buying until the market
stabilizes,” Miura said. “The market has been so volatile that
investors can’t place orders easily.”  Futures on the  S&P 500  increased 0.5 percent. The index
fell 2.5 percent yesterday in New York, its biggest loss in 19
months. The Fed will probably taper its $85 billion in monthly
bond buying later in 2013 and halt purchases around mid-2014 as
long as the world’s largest economy performs in line with Fed
projections, Bernanke said on June 19.  Mixed Blessings  Scaling back U.S. stimulus will have mixed outcomes for
Japanese equities. It will damp demand for risk assets globally,
while at the same time causing the dollar to strengthen against
the yen, buoying the earnings outlook for exporters.  Exporters rose as the yen dropped against all but one of
its 16 major counterparts, weakening for a fifth day against the
dollar. Honda added 2 percent to 3,580 yen and  Canon Inc. (7751) , a
camera maker that gets 79 percent of its revenue abroad, rose
1.7 percent to 3,270 yen.  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , a carmaker that
generates about 80 percent of its revenue outside Japan, gained
2 percent to 1,030 yen.  Japanese stocks gained even as most other regional gauges
fell, with the MSCI Asia Pacific excluding Japan Index dropping
0.6 percent.  Retailers climbed the most among the Topix’s 33 industry
groups, with  Fast Retailing Co. (9983) , Asian’s biggest apparel chain,
rising 4.8 percent to 31,050 yen. The retailer controlled by
Tadashi Yanai, Japan’s richest man, accounted for about 26
percent of the Nikkei 225’s net increase today.  Dowa Soars  Dowa Holdings jumped 8.5 percent to 872 yen, the most since
May 10, after Bank of America Merrill Lynch upgraded its rating
to buy, citing growth in non-commodity areas such as electronic
materials, environmental management and recycling, and
automotives.  Kirin, Japan’s largest brewer by market value, slumped 4.9
percent to 1,588 yen after jumping 4.3 percent just before the
close yesterday.  Sumitomo Electric Industries Ltd. (5802)  lost 4.4
percent to 1,176 yen and Central Japan Railway Co. slid 2.4
percent to 11,230 yen after similar surges. The share movements
yesterday were “treated as normal,” Japan Exchange Group Inc.
spokesman Kazuhiko Yoshimatsu said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
