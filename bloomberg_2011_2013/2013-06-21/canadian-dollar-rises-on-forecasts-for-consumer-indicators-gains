The Canadian dollar fell to an
almost two-year low after the nation’s inflation rate in May
accelerated at a slower rate than economists forecast and retail
sales for April rose less than projected.  The currency registered its biggest weekly decline since
September 2011 as the  consumer price index  gained 0.7 percent in
May from a year ago, following a 0.4 percent April gain that was
the slowest since October 2009, while retail sales added 0.1
percent,  Statistics Canada  said from Ottawa. The currency
dropped versus the majority of its most-traded counterparts as
crude oil, the country’s biggest export, erased earlier gains.  “We outperformed risk assets yesterday, so it probably
left us vulnerable to a weak number today,”  David Watt ,
Toronto-based chief economist at the Canadian unit of HSBC
Holdings Plc, said by phone. “We’re in this environment of
modest struggling growth, and retail sales are reflecting
that.”  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is known, fell 0.7
percent to C$1.0457 per  U.S. dollar  at 5 p.m. in Toronto. It
touched C$1.0489, the weakest level since Nov. 25, 2011. One
loonie buys 95.63 U.S. cents.  The currency has declined six straight days and dropped
2.8 percent this week, the steepest fall since a 5.1 percent
tumble in the five days ending Sept. 23, 2011.  Oil, Bonds  Crude-oil futures fell 1.6 percent to $93.92 per barrel in
 New York . The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of stocks gained 0.3
percent.  Canadian  government bonds  fell, pushing 10-year note yields
up 12 basis points, or 0.12 percentage point, to 2.45 percent,
the highest level since October 2011. The yield has risen 78
basis points since May 2 after the U.S. Federal Reserve said it
was prepared to taper four years of extraordinary stimulus
measures that pushed yields to record lows as economic
conditions evolve.  Canada’s core  inflation rate , which excludes eight volatile
products, advanced at a 1.1 percent pace for a second month.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast that total inflation
would be 0.9 percent and the core rate would be 1.2 percent.  In a separate report, Statistics Canada said that  retail
sales  rose in April to C$39.5 billion ($38.1 billion).
Economists forecast a 0.2 percent gain in a Bloomberg survey
with 23 responses.  ‘Unimpressive’ Sales  “Retail sales were unimpressive,”  Adrian Miller , director
of fixed-income strategies at GMP Securities LLC in New York,
said in an e-mail. “I see nothing in the recent Canadian data
that suggests anything other than sub-2 percent growth in 2013
as support from business investments and  consumer spending  fail
to materialize as some have predicted or hoped.”  Canada’s growth is slowing as the consumers who led it out
of recession pare spending and exporters facing a shaky global
economy look increasingly unlikely to offset the decline.  The median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg
calls for growth to slow to 1.7 percent this year before
accelerating to 2.4 percent in 2014 and 2.75 percent in 2015.  Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce’s  CIBC World Markets 
lowered its forecast for the Canadian dollar to C$1.05 by the
fourth quarter from C$1.03 previously.  “Slower growth in  China  makes us less constructive on
commodity currencies,” CIBC economist Andrew Grantham said in a
note to clients. The Canadian dollar will fare better than its
Australian counterpart because it is less dependent on China, he
said.  The loonie will end the year at C$1.03 according to the
median forecast of 59 economists in a Bloomberg survey, up from
C$1.02 at the end of May.  The Canadian dollar has fallen 1.3 percent over the past
month against nine developed nation currencies tracked by the
Bloomberg Correlation Weighted Index. It trails only the
currencies of fellow commodities exporters  Australia ,  New
Zealand  and  Norway , down 5.9 percent, 4.9 percent and 4.1
percent. The U.S. dollar gained 0.8 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
