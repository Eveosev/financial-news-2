Hong Kong   stocks  fell a fourth day,
heading for the longest weekly losing streak in 4 1/2 years,
amid concern a worsening credit crunch for Chinese banks and a
stalling recovery in the world’s second-largest economy will
hamper earnings.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd.  sank 2.4
percent, leading financial shares lower. The world’s largest
lender hasn’t risen a single day this month. Galaxy
Entertainment Group Ltd. dropped 6.6 percent as JPMorgan Chase &
Co. cut its recommendation on the the Macau casino operator
founded by billionaire Lui Che Woo.  China  Resources Land Ltd.,
the second-biggest mainland developer traded in Hong Kong,
retreated 3 percent.  The  Hang Seng Index  dropped 1.9 percent to 20,003.57 as of
9:45 a.m. in Hong Kong, extending this week’s slide to 4.6
percent. The equity benchmark is heading for a sixth week of
declines, the longest such losing streak since October 2008. All
but one of the 50 companies on the index fell, with volume 50
percent above the 30-day intraday average. The  Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  lost 2.2 percent to 9,058.63.  “We see a lack of recovery momentum in China,” Tai Hui,
Hong-Kong based chief market strategist for  Asia  at JPMorgan
Asset Management, which oversees about $1.5 trillion globally,
said in a Bloomberg TV interview. “What’s happening in China
with the data as well as the liquidity squeeze have added to
uncertainty. The government and central bank are willing to let
the economy go through some pain.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
