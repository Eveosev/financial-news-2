Enel Green Power SpA (EGPW) , a unit of
 Italy â€™s biggest utility, agreed to work with U.K.-based 40South
Energy Ltd. to install a wave energy machine off Tuscany.  40South will install and commission the 150-kilowatt
machine in the sea at Punta Righini, Rome-based Enel Green said
in a  statement  on its website. It will generate enough
electricity to power more than 80 homes, it said.  After the pilot project is completed, Enel Green plans to
examine the possibility of installing more generators in other
marine environments, it said in the statement.  Europe  has the potential to install as much as 100
gigawatts of energy from the waves and tides in the next three
decades, according to the European Ocean Energy Association.
More than 600 million euros ($793 million) has been invested in
the industry by European Union member states in the last seven
years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
