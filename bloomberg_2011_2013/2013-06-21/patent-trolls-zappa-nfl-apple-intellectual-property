U.S. Federal Trade Commission
Chairwoman Edith Ramirez said the agency should conduct a broad
probe of patent-assertion entities, known as “patent trolls”
to those who accuse them of abusing the system.  Ramirez said yesterday she would like to see a full-fledged
inquiry to determine whether the entities’ activities hamper or
encourage innovation and competition. President  Barack Obama 
earlier this month announced a crackdown on patent litigation in
an effort to protect technology, finance and retail companies
from lawsuits and demands for fees.  The crackdown includes five executive actions and seven
recommendations that require congressional action. A White House
commission report said more than 100,000 companies were
threatened with infringement last year by patent-assertion
entities, whose sole business is to obtain patents and use them
to extract royalties from other businesses.  The entities are “driving the increase in patent
litigation and targeting firms in a growing slice of the
economy,” Ramirez said at a workshop yesterday sponsored by the
Washington-based American Antitrust Institute and the Computer
and Communications Industry Association, a trade group whose
members include  Google Inc. (GOOG)  and  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  “The costs to
consumers from PAE activity appear increasingly tangible and
direct.”  Abusive patent lawsuits are a growing drain on companies
and the courts, though not all businesses that own patents
without making products are “trolls,” according to a report
released June 4 by the White House Council of Economic Advisers,
the National Economic Council and the Office of Science and
Technology Policy.  The FTC and the antitrust division of the U.S. Justice
Department conducted a joint workshop on patent assertion
entities in December.  At yesterday’s workshop, Ramirez said antitrust enforcers
“have a role to play in advancing a greater understanding of
the impact of PAE activity and using our enforcement authority,
where appropriate, to curb anticompetitive and deceptive
conduct.”  Standard Innovation Wins Order Barring Infringing Sex Toys  Standard Innovation Corp. , a Canadian maker of sex toys,
persuaded the U.S. International Trade Commission to issue an
exclusion order barring the entry of products that infringe a
patent.  The ITC, a Washington-based agency with the power to bar
the importation of products that infringe U.S. patents, said
June 17 that products infringing patent 7,931,605 cannot be
imported, distributed or sold. That patent, issued in April
2011, covers an “electro-mechanical sexual stimulation device
to be worn during intercourse.”  The ITC  order  specifically bars a vibrator made by  Lelo
Inc.  of  San Jose ,  California . The commission found that the
disputed patent is valid.  In a June 17  statement , Ottawa-based Standard Innovation
said the patent covers its  We-Vibe  device, and clams that the
ITC ruling acknowledged the product as “truly innovative.”  For more patent news, click here.  Trademark  Frank Zappa ’s Widow Seeks to Register ‘Captain Beefheart’ Mark  Adelaide Gail Zappa, the widow of musician  Frank Zappa ,
applied to register the stage name of one of Zappa’s
collaborators as a trademark, according to the database of the
U.S. Patent and  Trademark Office .  Zappa filed her application to register “Captain
Beefheart” for music-related uses including the downloading of
ringtones and musical and video recordings. According to the
patent office, she has until Dec. 18 to file a statement of the
use of the mark.  Captain Beefheart , whose real name was Don Glen Vliet,
performed with Zappa early in their careers, before they became
estranged over artistic issues. They reportedly  reconciled 
shortly before Zappa’s death in 1993 from the complications of
prostate cancer.  According to  a  New York  Times obituary, Beefheart died from
multiple sclerosis in December 2010 at the age of 69.  Zappa has been a zealous defender of her late husband’s
 intellectual-property  rights. She has filed at least five
copyright-infringement suits since 2000, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  NFL Puts New Jersey Towns on Notice Over Super Bowl Licenses  Although the next  Super Bowl  game won’t take place until
Feb. 2, 2014, the  New York/New Jersey Super Bowl Host Committee 
has already sent warning letters to all 565 New Jersey
municipalities warning them of the  National Football League ’s
trademark-licensing rules, the Bergen Record newspaper  reported .  The letter warned that while communities can bill
themselves as a “Super Community,” they are barred from using
the logos of the NFL, the trophy awarded the game’s winner and
the Super Bowl itself, according to the newspaper.  Communities whose officials work with the committee and who
are approved will be allowed to use the snowflake logo for the
game on their websites and advertising materials, the newspaper
reported.  Violators of the NFL trademark guidelines will initially
receive a warning letter or phone call, followed by more serious
measures for those that don’t cooperate, the Record reported.  For more trademark news, click here.  Copyright  Apple Denies Fixing E-Book Prices in Antitrust Trial Closing  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  got one last chance to defend itself from U.S.
charges it led publishers in a scheme to fix the prices for
electronic books, as a lawyer for the company told a judge that
it did nothing wrong.  “Apple did not conspire with a single publisher to fix
prices in the e-books industry,”  Orin Snyder , Apple’s lawyer,
told U.S. District Judge Denise Cote in his closing argument at
the end of a civil antitrust trial in  Manhattan . “Apple acted
lawfully and did not violate the antitrust laws.”  The government claims Apple and five of the biggest book
publishers conspired to move the e-books market to a model that
raised prices and harmed consumers. The trial focused on
December 2009 and January 2010, when Apple was racing to sign
contracts with the publishers and build an iBookstore in time
for the introduction of the iPad.  Cote, who will decide the case without a jury, interrupted
Snyder repeatedly with questions. In a court conference before
the trial, Cote told lawyers for both sides her “tentative
view” was that the government has evidence that Apple
“knowingly participated in and facilitated a conspiracy to
raise prices of e-books.”  Apple is the last defendant remaining in the case after the
five publishers sued by the government avoided trial by
settling.  The settling publishers are Verlagsgruppe Georg von
Holtzbrinck GmbH’s Macmillan unit,  CBS Corp. (CBS) ’s Simon & Schuster,
 Lagardere SCA (MMB) ’s Hachette Book Group,  Pearson Plc (PSON) ’s Penguin unit
and News Corp.’s HarperCollins. The No. 1 publisher, Random
House Inc., isn’t involved in the U.S. suit.  The government is seeking an order barring Apple from
alleged anticompetitive actions, including price fixing, in the
market for digital books. The U.S. isn’t asking for money
damages.  A group of states is also seeking fines and unspecified
damages. If Apple is found liable in the trial, damages will be
determined in a separate proceeding. A win for the government
may fuel class actions by private plaintiffs seeking triple
damages permitted under antitrust law.  The case is U.S. v. Apple Inc., 12-cv-02826, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  Vatican Tells WIPO Copyright Laws Can Hinder the Blind  A representative of the Roman Catholic Church urged that
copyright laws be modified to provide better services to those
who are visually impaired, Catholic News Service  reported .  Speaking at a World Intellectual Property Organization
conference June 18, Archbishop Silvano M. Tomasi said that
copyright law has never been an end to itself and that the goal
of the copyright system is the enhancement of human good through
the dissemination of creative work, according to CNS.  Tomasi, the Vatican’s permanent observer to United Nations
agencies, said that although audio books and text-to-speech
tools provide a quicker and cheaper way to get content to the
blind than translating them into Braille and printing them,
present-day copyright laws often provide obstacles to the use of
new technology to aid the blind, CNS reported.  He referred to a section of the Universal Declaration of
 Human Rights  that specifies that individuals have the right to
participate in the cultural life of their communities and
benefit from the arts and sciences, according to CNS.  For more copyright news, click here.  IP Moves  Gowlings Hires Brian Kingwell, Former Smart & Biggar Partner  Gowlings Canada Inc. hired  Brian Kingwell  for its patent
