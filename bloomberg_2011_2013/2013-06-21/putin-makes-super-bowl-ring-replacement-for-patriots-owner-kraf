Russian President  Vladimir Putin  said he’s having a replacement made for the Super Bowl ring New England Patriots owner  Robert Kraft  accused him of pilfering.  It will be “an expensive object, made from a nice metal, with a stone,” Putin said during a panel discussion with German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the  St. Petersburg Economic Forum  in his hometown today.  The Moscow-based newspaper Kommersant reported at the time that Putin tried on the ring, which is studded with 124 diamonds, and then pocketed it after Kraft showed it to him during a meeting with U.S. executives in Russia. Kraft then issued a statement saying the ring was a gift, “an act of serendipity, and one that I am honored to have experienced.”  Kraft rekindled the debate at an awards ceremony in  New York  last week when he told a crowd that Putin did indeed put the ring in his pocket and walk out of the room after trying it on and saying, “I could kill someone with this,” the New York Post reported.  That was just “a humorous, anecdotal story that Robert re-tells for laughs,” an unidentified Patriots spokesman said in comments posted on the  National Football League ’s website.  “In 2005, I was standing right behind the president and I saw how he was given this ring as a present,”  Dmitry Peskov , Putin’s spokesman, told reporters in the U.K. over the weekend, where Putin attended the Group of Eight summit.  Putin said today that he doesn’t remember either Kraft or the ring.
