 Rapeseed yields in  France ’s north
and east, which account for about half of the country’s growing
area, are forecast to fall from last year on poor planting
conditions and excess rain, researcher Cetiom said.  Harvesting across the region will be 15 days or more
delayed after cold spring weather hampered growth, with the bulk
of rapeseed to be cut between July 20 and Aug. 10, the Paris-based technical center for oilseed crops wrote in an  online
report  today.  Temperatures in the north of France averaged 11.6 degrees
Celsius (52.9 degrees Fahrenheit) in May, 2.1 degrees below
normal and the fifth month in a row that was colder than usual,
agriculture ministry weather data show. France has received 36
percent more rain than usual since March 1, the data show.  “We’re seeing a very big delay of vegetation compared to
normal,” Cetiom wrote. “This delay is mainly explained by an
non-existent spring, with average temperatures below normal in
March and May.”  France’s rapeseed production may fall to 4.8 million metric
tons this year from 5.43 million tons in 2012, grain-industry
group Coceral forecast today.  In the Burgundy and Franche-Comte regions, with a growing
area estimated at 201,600 hectares (498,154 acres) this year,
yields are expected to be around 3 tons per hectare, according
to Cetiom.  “The strong rainfall in spring, coupled with difficulties
of establishment in autumn on the northern part, will negatively
affect the yields but maybe less than could be feared,” the
researcher wrote.  Growing Area  Yields in the Lorraine region may be around 2.6 tons per
hectare, compared with yields ranging from 2.3 tons to 2.8 tons
in 2012, according to Cetiom. The growing area is estimated at
92,500 hectares this year, down from 137,900 hectares in 2012,
and the plowing under of the worst fields will “mechanically”
lift yields, the researcher said.  In Champagne, yields are expected to be around the same
level as last year’s 3.4 to 3.5 tons per hectare, the report
showed. The growing area in Champagne-Ardenne is estimated at
191,700 hectares this year from 197,900 hectares in 2012.  In Picardy, Nord-Pas-de-Calais and Seine-Maritime, with a
combined 215,200 hectares in rapeseed planting, yields are
estimated to be 3.5 to 3.7 tons per hectare from 4 to 4.2 tons
in 2012, according to Cetiom.  Difficult crop establishment as well as unrealized planting
intentions may still reduce the area for Burgundy, Lorraine and
Champagne-Ardenne by a combined 5,000 to 10,000 hectares below
government estimates, Cetiom said.  The late harvest will create “delicate” establishment
conditions for the next crop, also because grains face similar
delays to rapeseed, according to the researcher.  “In addition, the heavy soils remain saturated with water
and are only drying out very progressively,” Cetiom wrote.
“Major difficulties in soil preparation are to be expected.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
