Hong Kong   stocks  erased declines
after China’s benchmark money-market rates retreated from record
highs, easing concern that China’s banks are facing a credit
crunch. Utilities shares also advanced.  Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. (27)  dropped 6.9 percent after
JPMorgan Chase & Co. cut its recommendation on the the Macau
casino operator founded by billionaire Lui Che Woo. Zijin Mining
Group Co., China’s biggest gold miner by market value, sank 3.6
percent.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd.  reversed
losses to climb 1.5 percent, with the world’s biggest bank
heading for its first gain this month.  “We see recent share price weakness as a buying
opportunity” for lenders’ stocks, said Simon Ho, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Citigroup Inc. “Valuations have just fallen
below the recent trough. Big banks have stronger capital and
liquidity.”  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  slid 0.3 percent to 20,323.20 as of
2:41 p.m. in Hong Kong after erasing a 2 percent loss. The gauge
is heading for a 3.1 percent slide this week, a sixth week of
declines and the longest losing streak since October 2008. Three
shares fell for each that rose, with volume nearly double the
30-day intraday average. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI) 
added 0.2 percent to 9,281.82, reversing a 2.4 percent drop.  To contact the reporter on this story:
