U.K. government bonds fell for a
second day, pushing 10-year yields to the highest level in 15
months, as speculation the  Federal Reserve  will reduce debt
purchases reduced demand for fixed-income securities.  Ten-year gilt yields headed for their biggest weekly
increase since January 2009, while the spread over similar-maturity bunds expanded for a fifth day. Sovereign bonds across
the world have tumbled since Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said
June 19 that policy makers may begin paring asset purchases this
year and end them in mid-2014. The pound weakened against the
dollar and the euro.  “The market is getting quite concerned about the end of
quantitative easing,” said Simon Peck, a rates strategist at
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in London. “Everything comes
down to what goes on in the Treasury market and the hawkish
surprise we got this week has obviously affected that. One of
the most interesting things in the past few weeks has been the
propensity of gilts to underperform bunds in a selloff.”  The benchmark 10-year gilt yield rose 12 basis points, or
0.12 percentage point, to 2.42 percent at 4:34 p.m. in  London ,
the highest since March 21, 2012. The 1.75 percent bond due
September 2022 fell 0.965, or 9.65 pounds per 1,000-pound
($1,538) face amount, to 94.54.  The yield has climbed 36 basis points  this week , the most
since the period ended Jan. 23, 2009.  Fed Purchases  The Fed will trim its monthly bond purchases to $65 billion
in September and end buying in June 2014, according to the
plurality of estimates by economists in a Bloomberg survey
conducted June 19-20.  The 10-year  Treasury yield  has increased 37 basis points
this week, while the rate on similar-maturity  German bunds  has
climbed 22 basis points.  The  extra yield  investors demand to hold 10-year gilts
instead of bunds widened five basis points to 68 basis points.  Gilts have handed investors a loss of 2.9 percent this year
through yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes.
German bonds dropped 1.6 percent and Treasuries declined 2.2
percent, the indexes show.  Britain’s budget deficit narrowed in May as  government
spending  declined and the Treasury got a 3.2 billion-pound boost
from a tax cooperation deal with  Switzerland . Net borrowing
excluding temporary support for banks was 12.7 billion pounds
compared with 15.6 billion pounds a year earlier, the  Office for
National Statistics  said.  The Debt Management Office is scheduled to sell a 3.5
percent gilt maturing in 2068 via banks next week.  The pound fell 0.8 percent to $1.5379 after declining to
$1.5369, the lowest level since June 5. It has slumped 2.1
percent this week. The U.K. currency depreciated 0.1 percent to
85.31 pence per euro.  Sterling has declined 0.6 percent this year, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-market currencies. The euro gained 5.2 percent, the
best performer, and the dollar rose 5.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
