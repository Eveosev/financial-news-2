Two  News Corp. (NWSA)  journalists at its
Sun tabloid were charged with conspiring to commit misconduct in
a public office as part of a probe into bribery at the company.  Jamie Pyatt, a regional reporter at the Sun, and  John
Edwards , the tabloid’s photo editor, worked with others to pay
more than 30,000 pounds ($46,350) to public officials, army
personnel and hospital workers in exchange for information about
patients and details about the work of a member of the royal
family, U.K. police and prosecutors said in separate statements
today.  Pyatt, 49, and Edwards, 49, were ordered to appear at a
London court July 18. Robert Neave, a health care assistant at
the psychiatric hospital Broadmoor, will also be charged with
conspiring to commit misconduct in a public office, the  Crown
Prosecution Service  said.  News Corp. newspapers have been the focus of wide-ranging
investigations over the past three years that have uncovered
alleged phone hacking and bribery at two tabloids. News Corp.
Chairman  Rupert Murdoch  closed the News of the World after
revelations journalists had illegally accessed messages on the
mobile phone of a murdered school girl.  About 80 journalists and public officials have been
arrested in connection with the criminal probes so far. A three-month trial into allegations of voice-mail interception is
scheduled to start in September.  A spokesman for News Corp.’s U.K. unit declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
