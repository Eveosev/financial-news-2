Canadian  stocks  rose for the first
time in three days as metals prices rebounded after yesterday’s
rout in commodities.  Wi-Lan Inc. surged 14 percent after renewing a patent
licensing deal with Samsung Electronics Co. Premier Gold and
Nevsun Resources Ltd. jumped at least 5.1 percent to pace gains
among raw-materials stocks as gold, silver and copper advanced.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  rose 95.89
points, or 0.8 percent, to 12,064.46 at 10:03 a.m. in Toronto.
The gauge plunged 2.4 percent yesterday for the biggest drop in
two months and is down 1 percent for the week.  Markets worldwide slumped yesterday, a day after U.S.
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the central bank,
which buys $85 billion of Treasury and mortgage debt each month,
may begin reducing purchases this year and end the program in
2014 should the  U.S. economy  continue to improve.  Metals rebounded after a rally in the dollar yesterday sent
the S&P GSCI Index of 24 commodities to its biggest loss since
December 2011, with gold and silver at the lowest since 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
