Apax Partners LLP, the London-based
private-equity firm, raised 5.8 billion euros ($7.5 billion) for
its eighth fund, more than 3 billion euros less than its
original target.  The Apax VIII fund increased the company’s total committed
capital to more than $40 billion, Apax said today in a
statement. It began the fund in May 2011 with a 9-billion-euro
target, holding an initial close, the point at which the manager
can begin to invest, of 4.3 billion euros in March 2012, said
Sarah Rajani, an Apax spokeswoman.  Private-equity funds are having more difficulty raising
capital, with the average time spent marketing rising to 18
months from 14 1/2 months in 2008, according to data provider
Preqin Ltd.  “We believe the strength of commitments received reflects
confidence in our ability to add real value and is a clear
endorsement of Apax’s global growth investing model,” Martin Halusa, Apax’s chief executive officer, said in the statement.  Apax said about 51 percent of the commitments were in euros
and 49 percent were in U.S. dollars, with North American
investors making up the largest portion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
