Wind Power LLC, a unit of Ukraine
energy company DTEK Holdings BV, won a 138 million-euro ($182
million) loan from Landesbank Berlin AG for a wind farm in the
nation’s south.  The 10-year loan will fund the second phase of the Botievo
venture in Zaporizhia with a total capacity of 105 megawatts,
DTEK said today in an e-mailed statement. Construction at the
site is slated to finish in 2014, according to the company.  Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS)  of Denmark is supplying turbines to
the park and the nation’s export credit agency Eksport Kredit
Fonden backed the deal, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
