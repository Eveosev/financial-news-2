Asian  stocks  outside Japan fell,
with a regional gauge heading for its lowest close since
September, on concern the  Federal Reserve  will reduce stimulus
and  China ’s economic slowdown may deepen amid a cash crunch.  Guangzhou R&F Properties Co. dropped 2.4 percent, pacing
losses among Chinese developers even as the nation’s money-market rates retreated from records.  Newcrest Mining Ltd. (NCM) ,
 Australia ’s No. 1 gold producer, slumped 3.7 percent as the
bullion headed for its biggest weekly drop since September 2011.
 Honda (7267)  Motor Co. rose 2 percent, leading a rebound among Japanese
exporters after the yen weakened.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Excluding Japan Index lost 0.8
percent to 420.43 as of 7:04 p.m. in Hong Kong, paring losses of
as much as 1.4 percent. More than two shares fell for each that
rose on the measure. Global markets tumbled yesterday after
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said on June 19 the central bank may
start dialing down its stimulus effort if the economy achieves
sustainable growth, and as money market rates in China surged to
record highs.  “People have been buying so much stuff over the last few
years because  interest rates  have been so low,”  Mark Matthews ,
who helps oversee $282 billion as Singapore-based head of Asia
research at Bank Julius Baer & Co., said in a Bloomberg
Television interview from Hong Kong. “That era is coming to an
end and prices will reflect that. The general backdrop to world
markets is OK because the  U.S. economy  is improving. China is
the one thing that could upset markets”  Cash Crunch  China’s  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  slipped 0.5 percent at the
close, paring a loss of as much as 2 percent.  Hong Kong ’s Hang
Seng Index fell 0.6 percent and posted its sixth straight weekly
decline, the longest losing streak since the 2008 global
financial crisis. A gauge of Chinese shares in Hong Kong has
lost 24 percent since February 1.  “The economy’s not performing within expectations, the Fed
is causing volatility among global markets and our shortage of
liquidity is creating a big issue,” Deng Wenyuan, an analyst at
Soochow Securities Co., said by phone.  The overnight  repurchase rate  dropped 442 basis points, or
4.42 percentage points, to 8.43 percent in  Shanghai , according
to a daily fixing compiled by the National Interbank Funding
Center. That is the biggest drop since October 2007 and follows
an unprecedented 527 basis point jump yesterday.  South Korea ’s Kospi index declined 1.5 percent and Taiwan’s
Taiex index slid 1.3 percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index
dropped 0.4 percent and New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index lost 0.8
percent.  ‘Almost Done’  Japan’s Topix index added 0.7 percent, after falling 2.9
percent earlier. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average gained 1.7
percent, erasing losses of as much as 2.4 percent. Both gauges
retreated more than 13 percent from their May 22 highs. The
Topix has swung an average of 3.2 percent daily since the high.  “Japanese stocks seem almost done with the correction,”
said  Gentoku Kiyokawa , Tokyo-based head of Japanese  investment
management  at BNP Paribas Investment Partners, which oversees
the equivalent of $647 billion.  The benchmark MSCI Asia Pacific Index was little changed at
127.64, paring earlier losses of 1.5 percent and heading for a
2.4 percent decline this week. Shares on the gauge traded at
12.3 times estimated earnings yesterday compared with 14.4 for
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 12.6 times for the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Futures on the  S&P 500 Index  added 0.7 percent. The gauge
fell 2.5 percent yesterday, posting its biggest loss since
November 2011. About 9.4 billion shares changed hands yesterday
in the U.S., the highest volume of the year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Stimulus Exit  The Fed may reduce its $85 billion monthly bond purchases
by $20 billion at the end of its September policy meeting, a
Bloomberg survey of economists showed.  “The exit from easy monetary policy has begun,” Salman Ahmed, a London-based global strategist at Lombard Odier
Investment Managers, which oversees $46 billion, said in an e-mail. “The eventual exit path is uncertain as it will depend on
how the U.S. economy evolves from here.”  Chinese developers and lenders declined. Guangzhou R&F
Properties sank 2.4 percent to HK$11.56 in Hong Kong. Shimao
Property Holdings Ltd., a mainland developer controlled by
billionaire Hui Wing Mau, fell 1.8 percent to HK$14.06.  Bank of
Communications Co. , China’s fifth-largest lender by market
value, slid 1.9 percent to HK$5.22. China Minsheng Banking Corp.
dropped 2.1 percent to HK$7.85.  Newcrest, Zijin  Galaxy Entertainment  declined 8.4 percent to HK$39.35 in
Hong Kong, the most since October 2011, after JPMorgan cut its
recommendation on the stock to neutral from overweight.  Gold producers tumbled as the price of bullion headed for a
6.8 percent decline this week, the biggest weekly drop since
September 2011. Newcrest Mining sank 3.7 percent to A$10.35 in
Sydney. Zijin Mining Group Co., China’s biggest bullion
producer, slumped 6 percent to HK$1.58 in Hong Kong.  Japanese exporters advanced as the yen headed for a fifth
day of decline. A weaker currency boosts the value of overseas
income at carmakers and electronics manufacturers when
repatriated. Honda, which gets about 83 percent of sales outside
of  Japan , gained 2 percent to 3,580 yen. Canon Inc., the world’s
biggest camera maker, rose 1.7 percent to 3,270 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
