Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL)  will finalize
its purchase of a 49 percent stake in Virgin Atlantic Airways
Ltd. on June 24, Chief Executive Officer  Richard Anderson  said.  “On Monday, we’ll announce the closing,” Anderson said
today in a weekly recorded message to employees.  Delta President Ed Bastian will join Virgin Atlantic CEO
Craig Kreeger in New York for the event, Anderson said. The
carriers will begin a codeshare agreement that allows passengers
to book tickets on each other’s planes on a single itinerary, he
said.  Delta, based in Atlanta, can proceed after winning
regulatory approval from the European Commission and the U.S.
Justice Department yesterday, Anderson said. Delta and Virgin
Atlantic, which is 51 percent owned by U.K. billionaire  Richard Branson , are still seeking antitrust immunity from the U.S.
Transportation Department that would allow them to jointly set
fares and schedules and act as a single entity.  Delta is buying the Virgin stake from  Singapore Airlines
Ltd. (SIA)  for $360 million to increase its share of the trans-Atlantic market, the world’s richest segment of premium
passengers. The move is also a challenge to  British Airways (IAG)  and
 AMR Corp. (AAMRQ) ’s American Airlines, who now control more than half of
that service.  To contact the reporters on this story:
