Wi-Lan Inc. (WIN) , a Canadian owner of
patents for wireless products, rose the most in more than two
years after renewing a deal with  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  for
technology used in the South Korean smartphone maker’s devices.  Wi-Lan jumped 11 percent to C$4.71 at the close in Toronto,
the biggest one-day gain since May 2011. The stock has risen 4
percent this year.  The agreement covers long-term licensing for mobile phones,
tablets, laptops and networking equipment, the Ottawa-based
company said in a statement today. The deal adds “significantly
greater patent scope,” Wi-Lan said, without specifying the
terms or the length of the license.  With the Samsung deal, Wi-Lan is riding the popularity of
phones like the Galaxy S series, which rival  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone
in popularity. Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung is the biggest
phonemaker to use Google Inc.’s Android operating system, which
accounted for 75 percent of the global smartphone market in the
first quarter of this year, according to IDC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
