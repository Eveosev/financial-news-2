India ’s rupee headed for its biggest
weekly loss since September 2011 after plunging to a record
yesterday, as the U.S. signaled it is prepared to phase out a
stimulus program that contributed to inflows.  The currency dropped 3.6 percent from June 14 to 59.68 per
dollar as of 10:14 a.m. in Mumbai, the biggest decline since the
five days through Sept. 23, 2011, according to prices from local
banks compiled by Bloomberg. The 14-day relative-strength index
climbed to 79, above the 70 threshold that signals the
greenback’s rally is poised to end.  The rupee will probably strengthen to 59 per dollar “in a
few days” after touching an unprecedented 59.98 as the sell-off
seems excessive and on speculation the  Reserve Bank  of India
will intervene, according to HDFC Bank Ltd. India is prepared to
curb currency volatility,  Raghuram Rajan , chief economic adviser
at the  finance ministry , said in  New Delhi  yesterday.  “Fundamentally, we still have a current-account deficit
and that will need financing through inflows,” said Ashtosh
Raina, head of foreign-exchange trading at HDFC Bank in Mumbai.
“However, the rupee does seem overstretched and we seem set for
a correction from these levels.”  The currency fell 0.2 percent today. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of expected moves in the  exchange rate 
used to price options, rose 169 basis points, or 1.69 percentage
points, this week to 12.59 percent.  Rupee Debt  India’s central bank probably sold dollars around the
rupee’s record low yesterday to prevent the currency from
sliding past 60 a dollar, three traders said, asking not to be
named as the information isn’t public.  The South Asia nation needs capital inflows to bridge a
shortfall in its  current account , the broadest measure of trade,
which the government estimates widened to a record of around 5
percent of gross domestic product in the year ended March 31. A
weaker currency risks stoking inflation in India, which ships in
80 percent of its oil.  The  Federal Reserve  said June 19 it could taper its $85
billion in monthly bond buying later this year and halt
purchases in mid-2014 as long as the world’s largest economy
performs in line with central bank projections.  Global funds have cut holdings of rupee debt by $4.8
billion since May 22, when Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  first
signaled that stimulus may be cut back.  India sold 391.7 billion rupees ($6.6 billion) of debt-purchase quotas to foreign investors yesterday, lower than the
target of 420.2 billion rupees, two people familiar with the
matter said, asking not to be identified as they aren’t
authorized to speak to the media. That’s the first time since
October that an auction has been undersubscribed.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards dropped 3.7 percent
since June 14 to 60.69 per dollar, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts fell 3.7 percent
to 60.84. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a set
price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
