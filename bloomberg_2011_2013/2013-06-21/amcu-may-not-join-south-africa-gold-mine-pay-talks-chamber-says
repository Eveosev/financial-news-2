The Association of Mineworkers and
Construction Union, which represents about a fifth of gold
miners in South Africa, may not participate in this year’s wage
negotiations, the Chamber of Mines said.  “No demands have been received from AMCU as yet,” the
Chamber of Mines, which represents the country’s biggest gold
producers, said in a  statement  on its website today. “While we
would hope, as an industry, to engage in a single forum, this is
not necessarily a forgone conclusion.”  The AMCU, led by Joseph Mathunjwa, is the second-biggest
union in South Africa’s gold industry, counting 17.2 percent of
workers as its members, the Chamber said. The National Union of
Mineworkers, which is aligned with the ruling  African National
Congress , is the industry’s biggest union with 64.3 percent of
miners. Mathunjwa used to be a NUM member before founding AMCU
and becoming its president.  “Irrespective of whether negotiations take place in one
forum or not, the industry will be taking a common approach,”
the Chamber said. Wage talks are expected to take place in the
middle of next month.  AMCU officials couldn’t immediately be reached by phone for
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
