Bernard Madoff’s art, including
carpets and works by  Andy Warhol  and Henri Matisse, will go to
auction to raise money for customers of his Ponzi scheme, said
the trustee liquidating the Madoff brokerage. The artwork,
insured for more than $575,000, formerly decorated Madoff’s
offices in Manhattan’s Lipstick Building and the borough of
Queens, trustee Irving Picard said in a federal court filing in
Manhattan today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
