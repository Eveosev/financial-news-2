Ben S. Bernanke  has inadvertently
created the biggest arbitrage opportunity in the Chilean  bond
market  in 20 months.  Yields on Chile’s $750 million of bonds due 2022 surged to
a record 3.71 percent yesterday, part of a global rout as the
Federal Reserve Chairman mapped out a timetable for the end the
bank’s unprecedented bond buying this week. With the sell-off,
an investor who buys $10 million of the bonds and converts them
to pesos using  cross-currency swaps  would get 0.61 percentage
point more in interest than similar-maturity local notes. That
would provide an extra $602,000 by the time the bonds mature,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The last time valuations of Chile’s dollar-denominated
bonds fell so far out of line with local fixed-rate debt was in
October 2011 as European leaders debated a bail-out for  Greece .
The distortions in the nation’s  bond market  are amplified
because only three percent of Chile’s local notes are held by
foreigners, shielding them from the global capital flight.
Historically, yields on dollar bonds have been 0.19 percentage
point lower than local notes after swapping.  “It is becoming more attractive to buy in dollars and swap
to pesos,” said Rodrigo Blazquez, a swaps trader at Deutsche
Bank AG in Santiago. “The pain has been felt more in
derivatives where there are more offshore investors. There
shouldn’t be much flow of sales in local bonds but we are seeing
flows in the swaps.”  Lehman Collapse  The yield on Chile’s dollar bonds due in 2022 rose 108
basis points, or 1.08 percentage points, in the past month. At
the same time, 10-year peso bond yields climbed 32 basis points
to 5.4 percent.  The  10-year swap spread , or the gap in yields between bonds
and swaps, rose 39 basis points, or 0.39 percentage point, to 19
basis points yesterday from minus 20 basis points on May 9. The
difference reached 23 basis points on June 4, the highest since
the aftermath of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s bankruptcy in
2008.  Chile’s 10-year swap yields have soared almost twice the
increase on  peso  bonds in the past month, climbing 58 basis
points to 5.57 percent.  Mexican swap spreads have also widened. The five-year swap
spread in Mexican pesos climbed 24 basis points to 90 basis
points on June 19, the highest since October 2008. The yield gap
between  Mexico ’s dollar bonds due 2022 and its similar-maturity
peso notes after swapping widened 30 basis points to 93 basis
points June 20, when Bernanke said the Fed may start phasing out
quantitative easing, or QE.  ‘More Attractive’  The  extra yield  an investor could get from buying a 10-year
Chilean bond and swapping it into inflation-linked notes instead
of fixed-rate debt also reached 0.64 percentage point yesterday,
the highest since 2008, according to Bloomberg calculations.
That gap is almost three standard deviations from the mean of
the past five years, meaning the likelihood of it occurring over
that span is less than 0.3%  “It’s more attractive today to buy abroad than in  Chile ,”
said Valentin Carril, who oversees $5 billion as the chief
investment officer of Principal Vida Chile in Santiago.
“Normally, they move in the same direction, but spreads have
moved differently. It’s something we haven’t seen very often
before.”  Default Swaps  Yields on Chile’s 10-year  peso  bonds have climbed 0.32
basis points to 5.4 percent in the past month, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with a yield increase of
117 basis points on peso notes due in 2024 from Mexico, where
foreign investors own 56 percent local fixed-rate debt.  Felipe Alarcon, an economist at Banco de Credito &
Inversiones in Santiago, says the surge in Chilean dollar bond
and swap yields as well as its credit-default swaps will be
short-lived.  Chile’s five-year credit-default swaps, a measure of the
cost of protecting the nation’s dollar debt against losses, rose
to 113 basis points as of 3:51 p.m. today in  New York  from 72
basis points a month earlier.  The jump in swap yields also indicates that traders now
expect the central bank to leave the benchmark  interest rate  on
hold at 5 percent at the next meeting, cut it to 4.5 percent by
yearend before raising to 4.75 percent in April, according to
 Banco de Chile (CHILE)  data.  “That doesn’t make much sense,” Alarcon said. “It’s a
clear sign of overshooting. The same is true of the country
risk. The risk of default hasn’t changed. What we have seen is a
capital flight back to the U.S.”  Yield Spread  As recently as June 19, they predicted the bank would lower
the rate to 4.75 percent in July and again in the next following
three months.  The extra yield investors demand to buy Chile’s 10-year
dollar bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries fell five basis points
to 140 basis points today after surging 42 basis points
yesterday. The Chilean peso appreciated 0.5 percent to 511.67
per dollar today in Santiago, after falling 2.8 percent
yesterday.  Sebastian Ide, head of rates trading at Banco de Chile in
Santiago, said that while the jump in swap yields creates an
arbitrage opportunity for investors, it means that it’s more
expensive for companies to sell debt in dollars and exchange
those dollars for pesos.  “Today the idea of issuing abroad doesn’t make sense,” he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
