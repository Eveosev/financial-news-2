Natural gas futures may climb next
week as a hot start to summer drives demand from  power plants  to
run air conditioners, a Bloomberg survey showed.  Five of 11 analysts, or 45 percent, predicted that futures
will gain on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  through June 28.
Four, or 36 percent, said gas will drop and two said prices will
stay the same. Last week, 54 percent of participants said gas
would advance.  Temperatures will above normal across most of the lower 48
states from June 25 through July 4, according to MDA Weather
Services in Gaithersburg,  Maryland . Gas prices fell yesterday
for the first time in four days after a government report showed
an above-average supply gain for the third consecutive week.  “We expect U.S. natural  gas prices  to continue to correct
higher as the industry transitions into the peak cooling
season,” Teri Viswanath, director of commodities strategy at
BNP Paribas SA in New York, said in an e-mail yesterday. Hotter
weather may push prices back above $4, she said.  Natural gas futures fell 8.6 cents, or 2.2 percent, to
$3.877 per million British thermal units yesterday on the Nymex.
Prices are up 3.9 percent this week, headed for the first gain
in four weeks. The futures are up 16 percent this year.  The high in  Dallas  on June 28 may be 101 degrees (38
Celsius), 7 higher than the usual reading, according to
AccuWeather Inc. in  State College ,  Pennsylvania . Philadelphia’s
high on July 1 may be 3 above normal at 89 degrees.  Power plants will account for 32 percent of U.S. gas
consumption this year, according to the Energy Information
Administration.  Supply Report  Gas inventories  rose 91 billion cubic feet to 2.438
trillion in the week ended June 14, above the five-year average
gain for the period of 80 billion, EIA data show.  A  deficit  to the average narrowed to 1.9 percent from 2.4
percent the previous week. Supplies were 18.7 percent below
 year-earlier levels , the least since March 8.  The gas survey has correctly forecast the direction of
prices 50 percent of the time since its June 2004 introduction.  Bloomberg’s survey of natural-gas analysts and traders asks
for an assessment of whether Nymex gas futures will probably
rise, fall or remain neutral in the coming week. This week’s
results were:  RISE   FALL   NEUTRAL  5      4      2  To contact the reporter on this story:
