Qatar General Electricity & Water
Corp. has started the process of procuring two desalination
plants to support the country’s infrastructure boom, Global
Water Intelligence said without citing anyone.  The Qatar company, known as Kahramaa, is planning to build
two plants with a combined water capacity of almost 1 million
cubic meters a day, GWI said. One will be 15 kilometers (9
miles) south of Doha and combined with a 2,000-megawatt power
plant while the other will be at the Ras Laffan industrial site
north of the capital, the U.K. publisher said.  Both plants will be developed using private finance, GWI
said yesterday. The biggest liquefied natural gas producer is in
midst of an infrastructure boom as Qatar’s leaders look to
invest income from its reserves.  To contact the reporter on this story:
