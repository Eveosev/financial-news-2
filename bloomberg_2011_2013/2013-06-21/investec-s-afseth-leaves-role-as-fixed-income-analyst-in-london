Elisabeth Afseth said she is leaving
her position as a fixed-income analyst at Investec Bank Plc in
London after she was told her job was at risk.  Afseth, who joined Investec as part of its takeover of
brokerage Evolution Group Plc, spoke in a phone interview last
week. A spokesman for Investec at Newgate Communications in
London declined to comment on Afseth’s position when contacted
by e-mail today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
