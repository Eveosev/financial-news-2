Homebuilders in the U.S. are less
vulnerable to increases in mortgage rates than their falling
share prices would suggest, according to David Goldberg, an
analyst at UBS AG.  As the CHART OF THE DAY shows, a Standard & Poor’s index of
builders has lost 18 percent since May 14, when the gauge closed
at its highest level since June 2007. The average 30-year fixed
mortgage rate rose 0.51 percentage point during the period to
3.93 percent, according to data compiled by Freddie Mac.  Higher bond yields have laid the groundwork for further
increases. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, a benchmark
for rates on many home loans, rose 0.28 point in the past four
days to 2.41 percent.  Yet it’s premature to expect the housing market to falter,
Goldberg wrote yesterday in a report. Many prime locations have
a dearth of homes for sale, he wrote, and higher financing costs
probably won’t deter buyers much until next year’s second half.  “We don’t view today’s buyer as constrained,” the New
York-based analyst wrote. Purchasers tend to have higher income
and better credit ratings than in past years, he wrote, which
makes them less sensitive to mortgage rates and prices than
entry-level buyers.  Goldberg cited  Beazer Homes USA Inc. (BZH)  and  PulteGroup Inc. (PHM)  as
favorites among the 10 homebuilders he covers. Beazer, based in
Atlanta, is the group’s only buy-rated stock. PulteGroup, based
in Bloomfield Hills,  Michigan , has a neutral rating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
