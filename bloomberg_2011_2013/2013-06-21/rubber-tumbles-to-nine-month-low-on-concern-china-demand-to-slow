Rubber declined to a nine-month low
amid concerns that an economic slowdown in  China , the biggest
buyer, will reduce demand for the commodity used in tires.  The contract for delivery in November on the Tokyo
Commodity Exchange plunged as much as 4.2 percent to 228 yen a
kilogram ($2,345 a metric ton), the lowest level since September,
at 10:06 a.m. local time. Futures are heading for a sixth weekly
fall and have lost 24 percent this year.  Commodities from gold to crude oil slumped amid concern the
 Federal Reserve  will phase out stimulus and China’s economic
slowdown may deepen as a cash crunch worsens. Asian stocks also
fell, with the regional benchmark MSCI Asia Pacific Index
heading for its biggest two-day decline since August 2011.  “All risky assets declined yesterday, forcing many market
players to close their positions,” said Naohiro Niimura, a
partner at research company Market Risk Advisory Co. in Tokyo.  The MSCI All-Country World Index of global equities plunged
the most in 19 months yesterday after Fed Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  said bond buying that has fueled gains in markets
around the world may be trimmed this year and ended in 2014
should risks to the  U.S. economy  continue to decrease.  China consumed 3.85 million tons of natural rubber last
year, representing 34 percent of global consumption, according
to the International Rubber Study Group.  The contract for September delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange lost as much as 4.3 percent to 17,000  yuan  ($2,774) a
ton, the lowest since 2009. Thai rubber free-on-board was
unchanged at 86.50 baht ($2.77) a kilogram yesterday, according
to the Rubber Research Institute of Thailand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
