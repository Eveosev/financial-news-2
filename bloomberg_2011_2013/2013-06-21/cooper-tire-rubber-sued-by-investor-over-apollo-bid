A  Cooper Tire & Rubber Co. (CTB)  investor
sued to block the company’s $2.5 billion takeover by  Apollo
Tyres Ltd. (APTY) , saying the offer of $35 a share is too low.  Company directors have an obligation to get the best
possible price, the Booth Family Trust said in a filing made
public today in Delaware Chancery Court in Wilmington.  “The proposed transaction is the result of an unfair
process,” and “was negotiated and entered into in bad faith,”
the trust said in the complaint.  Cooper Tire doesn’t comment on litigation, Anne L. Roman, a
company spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.  The company, based in Findlay, Ohio, said June 12 it would
be bought by Gurgaon, India-based Apollo to expand business
around the world.  Cooper Tire fell 1.4 percent to $30.55 in  New York  trading
at 11:15 a.m.  The case is Booth Family Trust v. Cooper Tire & Rubber Co.,
CA8668, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
