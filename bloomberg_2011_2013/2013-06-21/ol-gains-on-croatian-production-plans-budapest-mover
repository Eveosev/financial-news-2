Mol Nyrt.,  Hungary ’s largest
refiner, rose after the chairman of its  INA  Industrija Nafte
d.d. unit said it wants to raise its Croatian oil and gas
production to counter losses from shuttered Syrian fields.  Mol’s shares strengthened as much as 1.1 percent and traded
0.5 percent higher at 16,780 forint by 11:48 a.m. in Budapest,
paring this week’s drop to 0.2 percent. Turnover amounted to 62
percent of the three-month daily average.  INA closed its facilities in  Syria  last year, resulting in
a profit drop in 2012 and in the first quarter of this year. The
Zagreb-based refiner plans an output increase “over the next
couple of years” from the Croatian mainland and offshore in the
Adriatic Sea, management board Chairman Zoltan Aldott said in an
interview in Zagreb on June 18.  “Croatia is one of Mol’s core countries and Croatian
barrels are one of the most profitable ones in Mol’s upstream
portfolio,” Peter Szentirmai, a Budapest-based analyst at  KBC
Groep NV (KBC) ’s broker unit, wrote in an e-mailed report today. “It
would be desirable to increase production of high-margin
Croatian barrels.”  Aldott’s comments are “good news” for Mol, Budapest-based
Equilor Befektetesi Zrt. wrote in a research report today. Mol
has lost 5.5 percent so far this year, compared with a 3.4
percent increase by the benchmark BUX stock  index , according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
