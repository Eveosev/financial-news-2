A case of Richebourg 1985 Domaine de
la Romanee-Conti fetched $34,300 at a Zachys sale in New York
this month as Burgundy wines including Musigny and Chambertin
accounted for four of the top five lots.  A 12-bottle lot of Musigny Maison Leroy 1985 fetched
$26,950, a case of Musigny J.F. Mugnier 1993 sold for $23,275
and the same quantity of Chambertin Clos de Beze Armand Rousseau
1993 attracted a winning bid of $20,825, according to a
statement from Zachys after the two-day sale ended June 14.  Demand for vintage Burgundies has underpinned the market
this year as appetite remains muted for Bordeaux. The Liv-ex
Fine Wine 50 Index has dropped 3 percent since mid-March, after
four months of gains, as the sales campaign for 2012 Bordeaux
wine futures weighed on the broader wine market.  “Even though demand is relatively subdued at present,
prices appear to have bottomed out,” William Beck, partner of
London-based Wine Asset Managers LLP, which has $20 million
under management, said in a market analysis this month.  Among top Bordeaux in the sale by Zachys, a 10-bottle lot
of Chateau Petrus 1982 Pomerol sold for $36,750 while six
bottles of the same grower’s 2005 wine fetched $18,375. The
auction raised a total of $3.56 million.  Following is a table of major wine auctions held so far
this year, with the total sold. Links are to auction websites or
