PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG) ,  Europe ’s
second-largest carmaker, has received more than 24,000 orders
for the 2008-model crossover that the company sees as key to
reviving deliveries and earnings.  The 2008, already built at Peugeot’s factory in Mulhouse,
 France , will be made in Wuhan,  China , starting in 2014 and in
Porto Real,  Brazil , a year later, said Sacha Farkas, a spokesman
at the Paris-based manufacturer. By the time all three plants
are producing the 2008, annual sales of the model will total
200,000 vehicles, he said, reiterating a goal outlined in early
March, when Peugeot started taking orders.  The carmaker, which reported a 576 million-euro ($758
million) operating loss last year, has a target of reducing cash
consumption 50 percent this year to 1.5 billion euros by
reducing spending while adding models. Peugeot is betting on the
new 208 compact city car and the 2008, a derivative of that
vehicle, to help it keep market share in Europe, where the
industrywide sales are falling for the sixth year in a row.  Maxime Picat, head of the Peugeot brand, said on May 22
that he’s “very confident” of sales being supported by models
such as the 208 and 2008 and a new version of the 308 sedan
coming out later this year to compete with European market
leader  Volkswagen AG. (VOW)   The 2008 and the Captur built by Peugeot’s main domestic
competitor,  Renault SA (RNO) , are part of the French manufacturers’
efforts to woo younger drivers and gain a foothold in a segment
that has grown 45 percent since 2007. The market for compact
crossovers may more than double by 2016.  The Mulhouse plant’s workforce totals about 7,700
employees, with about 250 people on temporary contracts,
according to Philippe Kalb, a spokesman at the site. The number
of shifts working on the 2008 assembly line at Mulhouse will
increase to 1.5 from 1 as of Sept. 16, the company said in a
statement in May. Other models built at the factory include the
Citroen brand’s C4 sedan and premium DS4 model.  To contact the reporter on this story:
