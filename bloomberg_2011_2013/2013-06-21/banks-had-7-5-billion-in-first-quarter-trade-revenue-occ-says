U.S. banks and savings institutions
had trading revenue of $7.5 billion in the first quarter, a 7
percent increase from a year earlier, the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency said in a report.  “As we see nearly every year, first quarter trading
revenues were quite strong,” Kurt Wilhelm, director of the
OCC’s Financial Markets Group, said in a statement released
today with the agency’s Quarterly Report on Bank Trading and
Derivatives Activities.  The revenue increase of $466 million from the year-earlier
period reflected “strong client demand for risk-management
products as investors increased their hedging and positioning
against potential changes in monetary policy,” Wilhelm said in
the statement. He also cited the reduced net impact of valuation
adjustments that had adversely affected trading revenue in prior
quarters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
