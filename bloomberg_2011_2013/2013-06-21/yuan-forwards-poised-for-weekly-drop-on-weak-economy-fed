Yuan  forwards had their biggest
weekly drop this month on concerns that China’s economy is
cooling and inflows will slow after the  Federal Reserve  said
it’s prepared to reduce monetary stimulus.  The People’s Bank of China set the yuan’s  reference rate 
0.11 percent lower at 6.1766 per dollar today, the most since
May 10. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said on June 19 the central
bank could taper its $85 billion of monthly bond purchases this
year and end the program in 2014 if the  U.S. economy  achieves
sustainable growth. China reported this week foreign direct
investment rose the least in four months, while a gauge of
manufacturing signaled a contraction.  “We see risk of the Chinese yuan weakening,” said
 Jonathan Cavenagh , a strategist at  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  in
Singapore. “Capital flows will be reversing. Growth momentum is
definitely more questionable.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards declined 0.43 percent
this week to 6.2957 as of 4:37 p.m. in Hong Kong, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts rose 0.15 percent
today. The  discount  to the spot rate was 2.6 percent, the
deepest since February 2009.  In the onshore  spot market  in Shanghai, the yuan dropped
0.06 percent in the past five days to 6.1342 per dollar,
according to China Foreign Exchange Trade System prices. The
rate, which is allowed to diverge from the fixing by a maximum 1
percent, fell 0.10 percent today. The yuan has strengthened 1.6
percent this year, the best performer among Asia’s 11 most-traded currencies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Some ‘Bearishness’  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan was little changed
this week and rose 0.04 percent today to 6.1303 per dollar.  Investors should sell the offshore yuan against the dollar,
Westpac’s Cavenagh said, adding that non-deliverable forwards
have already priced “a bit of bearishness.”  The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against the
currencies of six major trading partners, climbed 1.5 percent
this week, headed for its biggest gain since the period ended
July 6.  China’s economy  may slow to 7.4 percent to 7.6 percent this
year, Economic Information Daily reported, citing Zhang Ping,
deputy head of an economic institute under the  Chinese Academy
of Social Sciences . Gross domestic product growth last year was
7.8 percent.  The Chinese currency’s appreciation may slow and the yuan
could become less of an “anchor” for Asian currencies,
Citigroup Inc. analysts led by Johanna Chua wrote in a note to
clients.  Inflows Slow  Yuan positions  at China’s financial institutions
accumulated from sales of foreign exchange, an indication of
capital inflows, rose 66.9 billion yuan ($10.9 billion) in May,
the central bank reported June 14. That’s the smallest gain
since November.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, increased 15 basis
points, or 0.15 percentage point, this week to 1.93 percent. The
gauge advanced five basis points today.  Inbound non-financial investment increased 0.3 percent from
a year earlier to $9.26 billion, after a 0.4 percent gain in
April, the government reported on June 18.  The preliminary reading of 48.3 for a Purchasing Managers
Index for June, compares with the 49.1 median forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey of 15 economists, HSBC and Markit
Economics data showed yesterday. May’s final reading of 49.2 was
the first one below 50 since October, indicating a contraction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
