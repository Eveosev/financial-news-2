Colombia ’s peso was headed for its
biggest weekly drop since May 2012, prompting Finance Minister
 Mauricio Cardenas  to say yesterday that the government may wind
down its foreign-exchange intervention.  The currency fell 0.2 percent to 1,942.70 per  U.S. dollar 
at 11:44 a.m in Bogota, the weakest level on a closing basis
since December 2011. The peso extended its weekly drop to 3.1
percent after the  Federal Reserve  said on June 19 that it may
wind down a stimulus program that has boosted emerging-market
assets. The peso has fallen 9.1 percent this year, the biggest
decline after the South African rand and Brazilian real among 24
emerging-market dollar counterparts tracked by Bloomberg.  Cardenas said yesterday in Bogota that “‘we already have
done our job’’ as the peso plunged toward 1,950, which he has
called the ‘‘equilibrium rate.’’ U.S. Treasury 10-year note
yields rose today to their highest since August 2011 after Fed
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said this week that policy makers may
end $85 billion in monthly bond purchases under quantitative
easing in mid-2014.  ‘‘You had big inflows into  emerging markets  because of
quantitative easing,’’ Bernd Berg, an emerging-market strategist
at Credit Suisse Group AG in Zurich, said in a telephone
interview. ‘‘Now you have yields rising in the U.S.’’  Berg said the Colombian peso may weaken to 2,000 by the end
of the third quarter, compared with a previous forecast of
1,780. He predicts the peso may trade at 1,970 in a year, weaker
than a previously forecast 1,835.  Yields on benchmark Colombian peso bonds due in July 2024
climbed seven basis points to 6.97 percent today and have
increased 60 basis points this week, according to the stock
exchange. Yesterday they jumped 31 basis points, closing at
their highest level since July 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
