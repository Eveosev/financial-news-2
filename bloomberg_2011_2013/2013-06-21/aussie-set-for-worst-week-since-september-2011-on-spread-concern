Australian  government bonds  suffered
their  biggest weekly rout  since 2001 as the  Federal Reserve 
signaled it may begin tapering stimulus this year, reducing the
appeal of the South Pacific nation’s assets.  The Aussie dollar was set for its biggest weekly drop
versus the greenback since September 2011 after Fed Chairman  Ben
S. Bernanke  said quantitative easing could end next year if
economic improvement continues. Volatility in the currency
jumped to the highest in 1 1/2 years as Chinese money-market
rates surged to a record.  “It’s as if Bernanke has ratified this recent rise in bond
yields,” said  Tony Morriss , the head of interest-rate research
at  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  in Sydney. “The
market has moved relatively aggressively to price in unwinding
of extraordinary policy support.”  The  yield  on  Australia ’s benchmark 10-year government bond
closed up 12 basis points, or 0.12 percentage point, at 3.76
percent, the highest since April 23, 2012. Its 39-basis-point
climb this week was the most since November 2001.  New Zealand ’s 10-year government bond yield rose one basis
point to 4.1 percent, the highest close since April 2012,
following a 30 basis points surge yesterday, the most since
October 2008. It gained 37 basis points this week, the biggest
gain since March 2009.  The Fed may start dialing down its unprecedented bond-buying program this year and end it in mid-2014 if the economy
finally achieves the sustainable growth policy makers have
sought since the recession ended in 2009, Bernanke said June 19.  ‘Not Ready’  The U.S. central bank left the monthly pace of its bond
purchases unchanged at $85 billion at the conclusion of a policy
meeting that day, while saying that “downside risks to the
outlook for the economy and the labor market” have diminished.  “Hopes that Fed chief Bernanke would attempt to assuage
market concerns about tapering have been blown apart,”  Mitul Kotecha , the global head of foreign-exchange strategy in  Hong
Kong  at  Credit Agricole SA (ACA) , wrote in a research note. “Risk
assets were just not ready for this revelation.”  Australia’s dollar has depreciated 11 percent over the past
three months, the most among 10 developed-market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. New Zealand’s
dollar is the second-worst performer with a 5.6 percent slide.  Oversold Signal  The Aussie pared its weekly slide against the greenback to
3.6 percent as a technical indicator signaled recent declines
may have been too fast. It rose 0.3 percent to 92.24 U.S. cents
as of 5:31 p.m. in Sydney from yesterday, when it fell 1.1
percent to 91.97, the lowest close since September 2010.  The currency’s relative strength index versus the greenback
slid to 29 yesterday, a level that some traders see as a sign
that an asset’s price is poised to reverse course.  New Zealand’s kiwi dollar gained 0.2 percent to 77.71 U.S.
cents after tumbling 1.8 percent yesterday, the most since April
15, to close at 77.57, the lowest since June 2012. The currency
has fallen 3.5 percent this week, the biggest five-day decline
since November 2011.  One-month implied volatility in the Aussie versus the
greenback, based on currency options, declined 11 basis points
to 14.84 percent, after touching 15.4 percent yesterday, the
highest since December 2011.  “The volatility is definitely going to continue,” said
 Kieran Davies , chief economist at Barclays Plc in Sydney.
“We’re at a point where you’ve got both offshore and onshore
influences conspiring to push the Australian dollar lower.”  Growth Slowdown  Growth in Australia and New Zealand is slowing along with
 China , their biggest trading partner. Economists polled by
Bloomberg this month raised forecasts for the possibility of an
Australian recession in the next 12 months to 10 percent, from 5
percent in May.  New Zealand’s economy grew a less-than-forecast 0.3 percent
in the first quarter, slowing from a 1.5 percent expansion in
the previous three months, government data showed yesterday.
China’s manufacturing  Purchasing Managers ’ Index dropped more
than estimated this month to 48.3, compared with 49.2 in May,
HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics said yesterday. Readings
below 50 signal contraction.  The People’s Bank of China added 50 billion  yuan  ($8.2
billion) to the financial system yesterday after a cash squeeze
drove money-market rates to record highs, according to Bank of
Communications Co.  “China’s government is on a belated mission to curb the
growth of the shadow banking system,” Sharon Zollner, a
Wellington-based senior economist at ANZ, wrote in a note to
clients. “These moves are not dissimilar to developments in
U.S. markets leading up to the collapse of  Lehman Brothers .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
