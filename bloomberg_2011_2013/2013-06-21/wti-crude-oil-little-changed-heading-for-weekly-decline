West Texas Intermediate crude pared
earlier gains to trade little changed after posting the biggest
drop in seven months yesterday. Prices are headed for the first
weekly decline since May.  Energy and other commodities sank yesterday after the U.S.
Federal Reserve signaled it will scale back economic stimulus.
 China ’s central bank injected funds to alleviate the worst cash
crunch in at least a decade.  “The oil market, indeed most commodity markets, are trying
to assess whether yesterday’s Fed-induced selloff was
overdone,” Nic Brown, head of commodities research at Natixis
in London, said in an e-mailed response to questions. “Some
support is probably coming from the addition of liquidity in
Chinese money markets overnight.”  WTI for August delivery was 3 cents lower at $95.11 a
barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  at 1:46 p.m. London time after earlier advancing as
much as 70 cents. The volume of all futures traded was 5 percent
above the 100-day average. The July contract expired yesterday
after falling $2.84, or 2.9 percent, to $95.40, the biggest loss
since Nov. 7.  Brent for August settlement was unchanged at $102.15
a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. It
dropped $3.97, or 3.7 percent, yesterday. The European benchmark
grade ended the session yesterday at a premium of $7.01 to WTI,
the narrowest since January 2011. The spread is at $7.04 today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
