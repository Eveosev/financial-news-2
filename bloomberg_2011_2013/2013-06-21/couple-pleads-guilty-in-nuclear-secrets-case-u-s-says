A husband and wife who worked as
contractors at the  Los Alamos National Laboratory  in  New Mexico 
have pleaded guilty after being accused of trying to leak U.S.
nuclear secrets.  Pedro Mascheroni, 77, and Marjorie Roxby Mascheroni, 70,
entered guilty pleas yesterday to violations of the Atomic
Energy Act in federal court in Albuquerque, according to a
statement from Kenneth Gonzalez, the U.S. attorney for New
Mexico. Pedro Mascheroni faces as long as five-and-a-half years
in prison and his wife as long as two years, according to the
statement.  The couple admitted that they provided classified nuclear
information to an undercover U.S.  Federal Bureau  of
Investigation agent who they thought worked for the Venezuelan
government. The U.S. didn’t accuse  Venezuela  of any wrongdoing,
according to the statement.  Erlinda Johnson, a lawyer for Roxby Mascheroni, declined to
comment on the plea. Robert Cooper, a lawyer for Mascheroni
didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail after regular business
hours seeking comment.  The case is U.S. v. Mascheroni, 10-2626, U.S. District
Court, District of New Mexico ( Albuquerque ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
