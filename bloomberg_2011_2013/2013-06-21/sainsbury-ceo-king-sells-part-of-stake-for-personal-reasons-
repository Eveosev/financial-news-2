J Sainsbury Plc (SBRY)  Chief Executive
Officer Justin King sold part of his stake in the U.K.’s third-largest grocer for about 900,000 pounds ($1.38 million) amid
continued conjecture over when he will hand over the reins.  King disposed of 248,039 shares at 366 pence each, the
London-based company said in a statement today, reducing his
holding to about 1.3 million shares. Sainsbury shares fell 1.9
percent to 358 pence at the close of trading in London.  “Justin is selling the shares for personal reasons and as
far as the speculation is concerned there is nothing new to
say,” spokesman Trevor Datson said. “Justin’s very happy here
and he is looking forward to being part of our future success.”  King, 52, said in January he was “here for the long term”
after reports that the retailer may be planning for succession.
Sainsbury has reported 34 successive quarters of same-store
sales growth under his stewardship.  Formula One Chief Executive Officer Bernie Ecclestone said
in an interview published May 31 that he rejected a proposal by
the auto-racing series owner CVC Capital Partners Ltd. to have
King, an avid motor-racing fan, work alongside him.  To contact the reporter on this story:
