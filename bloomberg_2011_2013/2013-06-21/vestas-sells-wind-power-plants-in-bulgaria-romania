Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS)  agreed to
sell wind power plants in  Bulgaria  and  Romania  to Lukerg Renew,
improving the company’s cash holdings and adding to earnings.  Vestas, the wind-turbine producer with the most installed
capacity, will reap 127 million euros ($168 million) from the
sale in the second and third quarters, it said in a statement.  “Development and ownership of projects is not part of
Vestas’ regular business model,” the Aarhus, Denmark-based
company said today. They were “co-developed by Vestas, among
other things, to increase Vestas’ share of green electricity.”  The company is trying to end two years of losses, saying in
February it put some factories up for sale to pare fixed costs
by 400 million euros in the two years through 2013.  The sales “help reinforce the impression that Vestas is
working fast to get into better financial shape,”  Jacob Pedersen , an analyst at  Sydbank A/S (SYDB)  in Aabenraa, Denmark, said
in a note, reiterating his buy recommendation on the company.  The stock rose 2.8 percent to 74.35 kroner by 11:06 a.m. in
Copenhagen, with the share price more than doubling this year.  Vestas is selling the 70-megawatt Gebeleisis wind farm in
the Galati region in Romania, operational since February, and
the 14-megawatt Hrabrovo plant in Bulgaria’s Dobrich region. The
Hrabrovo deal, worth 17.6 million euros, is subject to approval
by Bulgarian competition authorities, Vestas said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
