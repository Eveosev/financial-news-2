House Speaker  John Boehner  lost support from more than one-fourth of his Republican colleagues as the chamber rejected a $939 billion agricultural-policy bill, the latest in a series of embarrassments handed to him by his own party.  Sixty-two Republicans joined Democrats in the 195-234 defeat of the measure yesterday. Many members of the speaker’s party opposed the legislation’s crop-subsidy provisions while Democrats were displeased over cuts to the food-stamp program.  The vote shows how difficult it will be for Boehner to win passage of other legislative initiatives including an immigration law rewrite, raising the nation’s debt limit and changing the tax system. Republicans control the House 234-201.  “It is an embarrassment for the entire Republican conference,” Republican strategist  John Feehery  said in an interview yesterday. “They need to figure out how to legislate this year. If they don’t, it doesn’t bode well for immigration or fiscal negotiations.”  The rejection of the farm bill is the latest of several legislative defeats for Boehner. In February 2011, Republicans were seven votes short of extending provisions of the Patriot Act; in September 2011 a temporary spending bill failed when more than 40 Republicans voted against it.  Boehner, an  Ohio Republican , had to cancel votes to avoid other losses -- in July 2011 on a bill to raise the nation’s debt ceiling and in December 2012 he scuttled voting on a plan to avoid year-end tax increases and spending cuts.  ‘Trust’ Leader  “It’s a failure of followership,” said Feehery, who previously served as an aide to former Republican House Speaker Dennis Hastert. “You’ve got to trust your leader.”  The farm bill, which would benefit crop-buyers such as  Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. (ADM) , grocers including  Supervalu Inc (SVU) . and insurers including  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFG)  and  Ace Ltd (ACE) , has been working through Congress for almost two years. The current authorization for U.S. Department of Agriculture programs, passed in 2008, was extended last year after the Senate approved a plan and the House declined to consider its own.  The bill rejected yesterday proposed cutting $20.5 billion, or 2.5 percent, from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as  food stamps , over 10 years. The provision would tighten eligibility in a way that would drop about 1.8 million people from the program, according to the  Congressional Budget Office .  Insurance Subsidies  The measure also would have boosted insurance subsidies to growers of corn, wheat and other crops. House Democratic LeaderNancy Pelosi of California and  Steny Hoyer  of  Maryland , the second-ranking House Democrat, voted against the plan.  Farm bills are passed with bipartisan support about every five years. The current law starts to expire in stages Sept. 30, although farm groups told Congress last year that the dates could slip if they knew what federal policy would be before they had to place orders for the spring planting. Federal dairy law expires Dec. 31 and would revert to a 1949 law that could double the price of milk.  The bill lost Democratic support after Republicans added a provision, sought by supporters of the anti-tax  Tea Party , that would let states run pilot projects to set work requirements for food-stamp recipients.  Urging Opposition  Small-government groups urged Republicans to oppose the bill. Heritage Action, the advocacy sister organization of the  Heritage Foundation  led by former South Carolina Republican Senator  Jim DeMint , ran radio advertisements against the bill in targeted lawmakers’ districts.  All except one of the 62 Republicans who voted against the bill also backed the food-stamp amendment that Democrats opposed, according to data compiled by  Bloomberg News .  Pelosi called the bill’s defeat a “major amateur hour” by the Republican majority.  “The Republican bill would have unconscionably increased hunger across America,” she said in a statement.  House Majority Leader  Eric Cantor , a Virginia Republican, supported the amendment and blamed Democrats, saying they “chose politics over progress and meaningful reform.” Boehner’s office issued no statement after the vote.  Republicans said Democrats knew the amendments were coming and still chose to kill the bill by withholding support. Plus, they said, the vote would only have advanced the bill to a House-Senate negotiation that the additional food stamp cuts might not have survived.  ‘Blows Up’  Representative  Collin Peterson  of  Minnesota , the top Democrat on the House Agriculture Committee, said more Democrats were ready to vote for the bill until the House adopted the amendment on work requirements for food-stamp recipients.  “I don’t know how you can blame us, we’re not in charge,” Peterson said in an interview. “If you overreach, you get nothing and that’s what we’ve been trying to tell people,” Peterson said in an interview. “You take things too far and sometimes it blows up on you.”  Peterson said he told Cantor he lost about 15 votes between changes to the dairy program and the amendment allowing work requirements for food stamps.  Minnesota Democrat Rick Nolan said he had been assigned a list of 12 Democrats he was supposed to persuade to vote for the farm bill. Earlier this week, he was doing that and told reporters he was optimistic the bill could pass.  ‘Poison Pills’  “In the end there were simply too many poison pills by the extreme Republican right,” Nolan said. “And I simply could not support it.” He voted against the bill.  President  Barack Obama ’s budget office said this week it would recommend a veto of the House bill.  “The administration believes that Congress should achieve significant budgetary savings to help reduce the deficit without creating hardship for vulnerable families -- for example, by reducing crop insurance subsidies,” said the  statement  from the Office of Management and Budget.  House leaders can try again later with the bill, or bring up a revised measure. The Senate passed a $955 billion version of farm legislation two weeks ago.  Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid , a Nevada Democrat, said in a statement yesterday the House should take up his chamber’s plan, which was approved 66-27 on June 10. Still, with House leadership seemingly unable to manage its own affairs, passage this year could be difficult, said former Representative  Tom Davis , a Virginia Republican who chaired the  National Republican Congressional Committee  during his time in Congress.  Needing Friends  “It used to be, you would vote for a bill to get it to conference and fix it there, or you’d vote for something because you needed your friends to vote for your bill later. The Tea Party shut that off, and that makes it hard for Boehner,” he said in a telephone interview yesterday.  Major farm groups largely expressed disappointment the bill didn’t pass and vowed to try to help pass a plan this year.  “It remains imperative to get a new farm bill passed before the current one-year extension expires in September,” said the National Council of Farmer Co-Operatives, whose members include CHS Inc. and Growmark Inc., in a statement. “America’s farmers and ranchers deserve the certainty.”  The unexpected defeat left House leaders grappling for what to do next. “This proved to be a heavier lift than even I expected,” said Representative  Frank Lucas  of  Oklahoma , the Republican chairman of the Agriculture Committee, which recommended approval of the measure. “I expect there will be a next step.”  The Senate bill is S. 954. The House bill is H.R. 1947.
