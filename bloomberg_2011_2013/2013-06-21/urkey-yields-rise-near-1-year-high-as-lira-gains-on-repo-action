Turkey ’s bond yields rose to the
highest in a year after the central bank did not provide funding
in its one-week repo auction for a third day and sold dollars.
The lira erased its gains after Premier Recep Tayyip Erdogan
said the “main opposition will pay price for backing protest.”  Yields on two-year benchmark notes surged 44 basis points
to 8.05 percent, the highest on a closing basis since July 5.
The yield on 10-year  bonds  also climbed for a second day and
traded 33 basis points higher at 8.65 percent.  Turkey’s central bank did not provide funding at the 4.5
percent policy rate today. It sold $50 million today and $350
million yesterday, intervening for a third time since anti-government protests broke out at the end of May. Turkish people
will not bow to artists and writers who are “humiliating”
them, Erdogan said at a party rally in the central Anatolian
city of Kayseri today.  The lira depreciated 0.4 percent to 1.9458 per dollar,
weakening for a fifth day to a record low and wiping out gains
of as much as 0.7 percent.  The 14-day relative strength index for the USDTRY cross
rose to 75, from 73 yesterday. A level above 70 indicates to
some technical analysts that the local currency is oversold
relative to the euro and poised for a rebound.  The cost of funding in the Turkish  interbank market  rose to
5.69 percent today, the highest level since April 12. The
central bank’s weighted  average cost of funding  the lenders rose
to 5.26 percent yesterday, the highest level since April,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
