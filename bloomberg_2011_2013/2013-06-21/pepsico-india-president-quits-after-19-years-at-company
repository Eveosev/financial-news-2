PepsiCo Inc. (PEP)  said India President
Manu Anand has left to join another company after working at the
world’s largest snack food maker for 19 years.  “Leaving PepsiCo is Manu’s personal decision,” PepsiCo
said in an e-mailed statement today. “It has absolutely nothing
to do with performance. PepsiCo is one of the largest food and
beverage businesses in India and has been consistently
witnessing double digit volume growth.”  Anand became the chairman of PepsiCo’s Indian operations in
January 2011 and joined the Purchase, New York-based company in
1994, it said in a separate statement. His successor will be
announced in due course, it said.  As part of its push into the second most populous nation,
PepsiCo last year said it would spend 3.97 billion rupees ($66.7
million) over five years to sponsor the world’s richest cricket
tournament in  India . The Indian Premier League has been marred
this year with allegations of spot-fixing, where players
manipulate specific actions in a game, after police arrested
players and team officials.  PepsiCo’s share of the carbonated beverage market has
fallen to 36.4 percent last year, from 40.1 percent in 2007,
according to data from researcher Euromonitor Plc. Coca-Cola
Co.’s share rose to 60.9 percent from 57 percent in the same
period.  The changes at PepsiCo come as top officials at Coca-Cola
were elevated this week. Atul Singh, who oversees Indian
operations, was promoted to deputy president for the Pacific
region, which includes India,  Greater China  and  Korea , the
company said in an e-mailed statement on June 19.  PepsiCo shares closed 2.5 percent lower at $78.91 in  New
York  trading on June 20, while Coca-Cola closed 3.2 percent
lower at $39.13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
