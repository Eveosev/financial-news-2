Luxembourg Finance Minister Luc Frieden said European Union plans on sharing tax data lack
coherence and could drive investors away.  Frieden said the EU shouldn’t move ahead with a new
proposal to require automatic exchange of information on more
kinds of income because global standards aren’t in place. The
European Commission this month proposed making dividends,
 capital gains  and other forms of financial income subject to
automatic exchange of information among tax authorities
beginning in 2015.  “This is not coherent and also not efficient in the fight
against tax fraud,” Frieden told reporters in Luxembourg today.
“If these products fall under automatic information exchange in
 Europe , but not in the U.S. and Asia, it will lead to an outflow
of capital from Europe.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
