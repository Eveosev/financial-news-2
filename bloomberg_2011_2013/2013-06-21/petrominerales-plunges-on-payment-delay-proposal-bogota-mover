Petrominerales Ltd. (PMGC)  fell the most on
Colombia’s benchmark stock index, extending the biggest three-day slide in two months as the oil producer seeks to delay a
bond-repayment deadline.  Petrominerales dropped 3.5 percent to 11,100 pesos at 12:29
p.m. in Bogota, capping an 11 percent decline over the past
three days. The benchmark  Colcap index  fell 0.2 percent today.  The Calgary-based company, which gets most of its output
from Colombia, said yesterday it’s seeking a six-month
postponement of an August option that lets holders of $144
million of convertible bonds claim immediate repayment. The
company has said the delay will give it more time to raise money
by selling its 5 percent stake in the Ocensa pipeline, which
runs from Colombia’s oil-rich eastern plains to the Caribbean
coast.  “The company showed that it has real liquidity problems,
and people keep selling the stock on that concern,” Maria Adelaida Velasquez, a Medellin-based analyst at brokerage
Serfinco said in a telephone interview.  Norsk Tillitsmann ASA, the trustee for the bonds, has set a
July 5 meeting to approve the delay, according to a notice to
investors. The company’s pipeline assets are valued at $328.3
million on its financial statements, according to the notice.  According to the company’s statement, Petrominerales has
already received support from holders of $60 million of the
bonds, or about 42 percent of the amount outstanding.  To contact the reporter on this story:
