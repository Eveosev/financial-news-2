The following is the text of
 Canada ’s retail sales report for April as released by
 Statistics Canada .  Retail sales edged up 0.1% to $39.5 billion in April,
following flat sales in March. Stronger sales at motor vehicle
and parts dealers were offset by weaker sales at gasoline
stations.  In volume terms, retail sales increased 0.5%.  Higher sales were reported in 6 of 11 subsectors,
representing 51% of total retail sales.  The largest sales increase in dollar terms among all
subsectors was a 1.4% advance at motor vehicle and parts dealers.
Higher sales at new car dealers (+2.2%), particularly truck
sales, led the gain. This was the fourth consecutive monthly
increase in sales at new car dealers. Used car dealers reported
a third straight monthly sales decline, falling 0.9%. Other
 motor vehicle  dealers (-4.7%) and automotive parts, accessories
and tire stores (-1.3%) were both down from the previous month.  Receipts at general merchandise stores rose 0.7%, as a
result of higher sales at “other general merchandise stores”
(+1.9%). Department store sales were down 0.8% from March,
declining for the second consecutive month.  Electronics and appliance stores posted a 2.1% gain, the
third increase in four months following a downward trend in 2012.  Gasoline station sales fell 2.9% in April, mainly
reflecting lower prices at the pump.  The 1.9% decline in sales at clothing and clothing
accessories stores did not offset the sales gain in March. Lower
sales at clothing stores (-2.6%) accounted for most of the
decline.  Lower receipts at building material and garden equipment
and supplies dealers (-1.0%) more than offset gains made in
February and March. Sales in this subsector have been relatively
flat since the middle of 2012.  Sales up in seven provinces  Retail sales rose in seven provinces in April. Alberta
(+1.7%) reported the largest increase in dollar terms, on the
strength of new and used car sales.  Following four straight monthly declines, sales in
Saskatchewan grew 1.8%.  The 0.6% sales gain in Manitoba did not offset the decline
in March.  Sales in all four Atlantic provinces were up in April, led
by a 2.3% gain in  Nova Scotia .  The largest decline in dollar terms occurred in  Quebec 
(-0.7%), where sales fell for a second month in a row, with
widespread decreases across store types.  After rising for three straight months, sales in Ontario
declined 0.4%.  The 0.7% sales decrease in British Columbia did not offset
the gain in March. Sales in this province have been relatively
flat since the middle of 2012.  It is possible to consult tables of unadjusted data by
