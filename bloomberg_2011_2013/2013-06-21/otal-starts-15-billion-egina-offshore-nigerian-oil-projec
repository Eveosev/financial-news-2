Total SA (FP) ,  Europe ’s third-biggest oil
company, will start developing  Nigeria ’s offshore Egina field
for $15 billion as part of a plan to boost production.  First oil from the field, which is part of the OML 130
block, is expected at the end of 2017, with output reaching
200,000 barrels of oil a day, according to a statement. A Total
official said development costs will be around $15 billion.  The project can be started after Total obtained the
necessary approvals from Nigeria to award the main contracts,
the statement showed.  Total Chief Executive Officer Christophe de Margerie has
said the explorer will use proceeds from asset sales to pay
dividends and develop oil and gas projects rather than make
acquisitions. The French company has also pledged to try harder
to make large oil and gas discoveries in a bid to raise
production.  The Egina project calls for 44 wells connected to a 330
meter-long floating production, storage and offloading vessel
which can store 2.3 million barrels, Total said in today’s
statement. Locally worked hours will reach about 75 percent for
Egina as part of a plan to boost local content of Nigerian
projects.  Total is operator of Egina with a 24 percent interest. The
other partners are Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation,
South Atlantic Petroleum of Nigeria,  Cnooc Ltd. (883)  and Petroleo
Brasilero SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
