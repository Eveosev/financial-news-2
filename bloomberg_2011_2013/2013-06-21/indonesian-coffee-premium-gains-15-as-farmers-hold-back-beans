Buyers of coffee from Indonesia, the
world’s third-biggest producer of the robusta variety, are
paying a 15 percent higher premium for their beans as farmers
hold back supplies due to lower prices, said Volcafe Ltd.  Indonesian beans for shipment in July and August are at a
premium of $230 a metric ton to the price on NYSE Liffe in
 London , the Winterthur, Switzerland-based unit of trader ED&F
Man Holdings Ltd. said in a report e-mailed today. That’s up
from $200 a ton last week. Robusta coffee is heading for a fifth
week of declines, the longest slump since Jan. 6, 2012.  “With current low prices, farmers are holding back
again,” Volcafe said in the report. “Most of the exporters are
facing a tough situation to cover. We expect more shipment
delays and wash-outs might be inevitable,” it said, referring
to exporters’ needs to buy and potential shipment cancellations.  Heavy rain in Indonesian coffee areas probably slowed the
harvest, MDA Weather Services in Gaithersburg,  Maryland , said in
a report e-mailed yesterday. Rainfall amounted to 0.25 inch to
2.75 inches in Sumatra, where the country’s main growing region
is located, and 3 inches to 6 inches in Java. The country is
gathering its 2013-14 crop that started in April.  Farmers are storing coffee “in wet conditions, which has
an effect on the quality as we see more and more mouldy beans,”
Volcafe said. Exporters and domestic roasters are competing to
buy beans at 17,000 rupiah ($1.7) a kilogram (2.2 pounds) to
18,000 rupiah a kilogram, the trader said. Inventory held by
exporters is estimated to be below 30,000 tons, “which very
low.”  Buyers of coffee from  Vietnam , the biggest robusta grower,
are paying a premium of $160 a ton to the exchange price,
Volcafe data showed. That’s up from $135 a ton a week earlier.
Robusta beans are used in instant coffee.  Demand  The “local market is trading smaller volumes on a daily
basis,” Volcafe said. “On the other hand, demand keeps showing
up for nearby positions.”  Stockpiles in  Ho Chi Minh City  were about 205,000 tons and
farmers were still holding 310,000 tons of coffee, Volcafe said.  In  India , supply is “very tight” as farmers hold on to
their coffees, according to the report. Farmers there are
estimated to be holding 20 percent of the robusta production.  Robusta coffee for September delivery gained 0.8 percent to
$1,750 a ton by 4:31 p.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
