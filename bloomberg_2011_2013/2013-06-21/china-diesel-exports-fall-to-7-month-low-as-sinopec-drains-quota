China ’s net exports of  diesel 
dropped to the lowest in seven months as  Asia ’s largest oil
refiner exhausted its export quota and faced the weakest oil
consumption in nine months.  Overseas sales of diesel exceeded imports by 177,004 metric
tons in May, according to data e-mailed by the General
Administration of Customs in Beijing today. That’s equivalent to
42,600 barrels a day and is the lowest level since October, when
net exports declined to 107,277 tons, data compiled by Bloomberg
shows. May’s figure slid 39 percent from April.  China, the world’s second-biggest oil consumer, is reducing
diesel exports as its largest refiner used up export allowances.
 China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (386) , or Sinopec, shipped “several
thousand” tons from its Maoming refinery in  Guangdong province 
last month through its trading arm, China International, a
company official who asked not to be identified, said on June
14. Unipec, as the unit is known, won’t export any diesel
cargoes in June, according to the official.  The country’s apparent oil demand, or domestic refinery
output plus net import of refined oil, was 9.53 million barrels
a day last month, the weakest since August, today’s data showed.
Diesel output will fall 0.3 percent to 43.2 million tons this
quarter, according to Xinhua News Agency’s China Oil, Gas &
Petrochemicals newsletter on May 1, citing research by the
nation’s top energy producer, China National Petroleum Corp.  China exported 415,698 tons of gasoline in May, the customs
data shows. That’s about 113,000 barrels a day. Coal imports,
including lignite, rose 5.6 percent from a year earlier to 27.57
million tons last month. The country imported 1.35 million tons
of liquefied natural gas for the month, a 19 percent increase.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
