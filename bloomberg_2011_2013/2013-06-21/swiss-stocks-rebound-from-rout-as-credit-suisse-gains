Stocks in Switzerland  rebounded from
the biggest slide in 20 months as investors bought shares
trading near the cheapest valuations since February.  Credit Suisse Group AG, Switzerland’s second-largest
lender, advanced 1.2 percent after tumbling 4.2 percent
yesterday. Addex Therapeutics Ltd. jumped 6.5 percent.  The  Swiss Market Index (SMI)  gained 0.6 percent to 7,539.56 at
10:05 a.m. in Zurich. The gauge plunged 3.1 percent yesterday
after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the U.S.
central bank may cut bond purchases later this year if the
world’s largest economy strengthens in line with its forecasts.
The broader  Swiss Performance Index (SPI)  rose 0.4 percent today.  “What you have is a change in environment towards
normalization,”  Virginie Maisonneuve , who helps oversee $359
billion as head of global equities at Schroder Investment
Management Ltd. in London, said in a phone interview. “The
market needs to adjust. In this change there is going to be fear
and some companies that are good companies will suffer. Those
cases will definitely bring buying opportunities.”  The SMI yesterday closed at 14.2  times  its members’
estimated earnings, the cheapest valuation since February,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Equities may have bigger swings than usual today as futures
and options contracts expire in a process known as witching.  Credit Suisse (CSGN)  rose 1.2 percent to 25.65 Swiss francs.
Addex, the biotechnology company based in Geneva, rallied 6.5
percent to 3.62 francs, rebounding from four days of losses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
