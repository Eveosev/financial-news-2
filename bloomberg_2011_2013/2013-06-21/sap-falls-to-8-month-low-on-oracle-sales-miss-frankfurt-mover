SAP AG (SAP) , the largest maker of
business-management software, slumped to an eight-month low
after competitor  Oracle Corp. (ORCL)  reported quarterly sales that
missed estimates, fueling concerns about weaker license demand.  Oracle, based in Redwood, California, also forecast profit
per share for the current quarter at the low end of a range of
analyst projections. SAP shares declined as much as 2.5 percent
to 55.20 euros, their lowest intraday price since Oct. 29, and
were down 2 percent as of 11:15 a.m. in Frankfurt trading.
Volume was 81 percent of the three-month daily average.  Software buyers, led by those in the U.S., are increasingly
opting for software they can access via the web rather than for
packages that take weeks or months to be installed on their own
servers. Oracle and Walldorf, Germany-based SAP have both
 acquired  a series of cloud software providers to meet this
demand and to keep  Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM)  and  Workday Inc. (WDAY)  from
taking parts of their core business.  “The structural shift seems to be happening faster than
anticipated, and these two dinosaurs are feeling it,” said
 Thomas Becker , an analyst at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt who
recommends investors hold SAP shares. Still, “the correlation
between the two isn’t that high -- a string of bad quarters for
Oracle doesn’t necessarily mean SAP is suffering the same.”  SAP which was the fifth-best performer in Germany’s 30-company benchmark DAX Index last year with a 49 percent gain,
has lost about 8.6 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
