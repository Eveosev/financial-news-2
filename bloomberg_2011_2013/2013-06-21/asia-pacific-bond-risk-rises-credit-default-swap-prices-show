The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region against non-payment
rose, according to credit-default swap traders.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  gained 5 basis points to 166 basis
points as of 8:21 a.m. in  Singapore , according to Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc prices. The benchmark surged 29.5 yesterday,
the most since September 2011, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index jumped 10 basis points to
147.5 as of 10:23 a.m. in Sydney, according to National
Australia Bank Ltd. prices. The measure is on track for its
highest close since Nov. 16, after jumping 15.2 basis points
yesterday. That was the sharpest rise since March 20, according
to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices
quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index increased 8 basis points to
123.5 as of 9:22 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices show. The
gauge is set for its biggest daily advance since June 13 and for
its highest close since March, CMA prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
