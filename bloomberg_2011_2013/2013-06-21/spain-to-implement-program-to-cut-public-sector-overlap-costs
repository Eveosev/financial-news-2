Spain  plans to eliminate overlap in
the civil service and improve efficiencies in an effort to cut
37.7 billion euros ($49.8 billion) in costs, Deputy Prime
Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria said.  The cost savings are being achieved from 2012 to 2015,
Saenz de Santamaria said in a televised media conference today.
The savings will also come from proposed changes by local
governments.  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy ’s cabinet approved a report
with 218 measures, of which 78 affect the central government and
the remainder Spain’s regions. The program is part of government
initiative to trim Spain’s budget deficit of 10.6 percent of
gross domestic product, the widest in the European Union and
more than three times the limit set for EU members.  “It seeks to strengthen fiscal discipline and
transparency,” Saenz de Santamaria said. It also “seeks to
change the culture of the administration to bring it closer to
the citizen,” she said.  The plan will be discussed with the regions in coming
weeks, Budget Minister Cristobal Montoro said. Measures
concerning the regions will be voluntary, he said. The
government also  plans to study ways to reduce size of the
country’s black market economy, Montoro said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
