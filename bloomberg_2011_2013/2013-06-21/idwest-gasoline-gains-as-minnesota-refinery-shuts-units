Midwest spot gasoline strengthened
after Flint Hills Resources Inc. shut units at the Pine Bend
refinery in  Minnesota  because of a  power failure .  Conventional, 85-octane gasoline, or CBOB, in Chicago
gained 1 cent to 21 cents a gallon below futures on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  at 12:37 p.m. The  differential  has narrowed
11 cents in the past two days after falling to the biggest
discount since March 1, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Flint Hills’  330,000-barrel-a-day Pine Bend plant  suffered
a power loss, resulting in the automatic shutdown of several
units. Jake Reint, a company spokesman, said he couldn’t comment
any further on the units or repairs that may be under way.  In the Group 3 market, which covers states from  Oklahoma 
north to Minnesota, conventional 87-octane gasoline gained 0.25
cent to a 9.75-cent discount.  When a refinery takes units offline, it typically results
in lower regional supplies and strengthening of spot prices.  Gasoline inventories  in the U.S. Midwest climbed 507,000
barrels to 49.7 million barrels in the week ended June 14,
according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data.
 Distillate fuel  supplies dropped 197,000 barrels to 27.3 million
during the same time period, the lowest level since May 24.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel strengthened 0.75 cent in
Chicago to  2.75 cents  below futures on the Nymex, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Group 3 ULSD gained 0.25 cent to a
1-cent premium.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  in Chicago, a rough measure for
gasoline and diesel fuel based on West Texas Intermediate oil in
Cushing, Oklahoma, increased 64 cents to $16.84 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
