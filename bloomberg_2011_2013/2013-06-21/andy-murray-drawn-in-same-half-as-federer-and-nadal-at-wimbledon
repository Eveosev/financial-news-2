U.S. Open champion Andy Murray was
drawn in the same half as defending champion  Roger Federer  and
two-time winner  Rafael Nadal  at next week’s Wimbledon tennis
championships.  Switzerland’s Federer and Nadal of Spain are due to meet in
the quarterfinals, with the winner of that match scheduled to
play the second-seeded Murray in the semi-finals.  Top-seed Novak Djokovic of Serbia may face former finalist
Tomas Berdych of the Czech Republic in the quarterfinals,
followed by either fourth-seeded David Ferrer of Spain or Juan
Martin Del Potro, the No. 8 seed from Argentina, in the semi-finals.  Federer beat Murray in last year’s final, while Nadal has
handed the 26-year-old three defeats at the All England Club.  To contact the reporter on this story:
