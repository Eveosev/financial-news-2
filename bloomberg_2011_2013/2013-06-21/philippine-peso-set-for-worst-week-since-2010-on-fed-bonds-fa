The Philippine peso headed for its
worst week in three years on speculation U.S. policy makers will
trim monetary stimulus that fueled capital inflows.  The  Federal Reserve  may cut its monthly bond purchases to
$65 billion in September and stop buying in June 2014, according
to estimates by economists in a Bloomberg survey, after Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  signaled the start of tapering this year if the
economy improves in line with projections. The yield on the
 Philippines  five-year bonds rose the most in more than two years
after Treasurer Rosalia de Leon said yesterday she’s in talks
with six banks on a plan to sell peso debt to individuals.  “There is a lingering concern the liquidity that drove the
rally in  emerging markets  will subside,” said Lito Mercado,
head of trading at Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. in Manila.
“There is also some supply concerns on retail bonds.”  The peso fell 2.5 percent this week to 43.89 per dollar at
the noon trading break in Manila, its biggest drop since May
2010, according to Tullett Prebon Plc. The currency fell 0.2
percent today and touched 44.20 earlier, the weakest level since
Jan. 9, 2012.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, rose 31 basis points,
or 0.31 percentage point, to 9.45 percent  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas will keep a strategic presence
in the  currency markets , Governor Amando Tetangco said yesterday.
The peso is affected by external events, Assistant Governor Cyd
Amador said today.  The yield on the 2.125 percent government bonds due May
2018 rose 35 basis points to 3.165 percent today, according to
midday fixing prices at Philippine Dealing & Exchange Corp.
That’s the highest level for a benchmark five-year note since
April 29 and the biggest increase since February 2011, based on
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Philippines sold a record 188 billion pesos ($4.3
billion) of 25-year retail bonds in October 2012. The Treasury
will release its third-quarter auction plan before month-end.  To contact the reporter on this story:
