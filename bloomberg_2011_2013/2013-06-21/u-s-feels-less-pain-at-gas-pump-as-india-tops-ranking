The U.S., the world’s biggest oil
consumer, is among the nations feeling the least pain at the
gasoline pump, while  India  tops the list of 60 countries ranked
by Bloomberg.  A gallon of regular gasoline cost Americans 2.5 percent of
their daily income in April, 55th out of 60 nations, according
to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. In India, a gallon cost 16
percent more than a worker’s daily wage. Venezuelans paid 0.1
percent of income to buy a gallon, the least in the world, the
data show.  The price of regular unleaded gasoline in April was $3.52 a
gallon in the U.S., ranking 51st in prices, lower than China,
where a gallon went for $4.75, and Pakistan, where it cost
$3.95. The highest pump price was in Turkey, where motorists
paid $9.98 a gallon. That’s about 32 percent of their daily
income. Norwegian drivers paid $9.97, or 3.5 percent of income.  Motorists in  Venezuela , a nation that subsidizes gasoline
to cap prices, paid 4 cents a gallon.  The price list was created using data compiled by Bloomberg
from sources including Associates for International Research
Inc., Europe’s Energy Portal, U.S. Energy Information
Administration, the  International Monetary Fund  and the  World
Bank . Prices for the U.S. and European Union countries are from
April 16. Prices for all other countries are from April 4-12.  Oil futures for August delivery fell 26 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $94.88 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
Gasoline futures dropped 0.3 percent to $2.7794 a gallon.  Regular  gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, fell 0.4
cent to $3.592 a gallon yesterday, according to Heathrow,
Florida-based AAA, the largest U.S. motoring group.  To contact the reporters on this story:
