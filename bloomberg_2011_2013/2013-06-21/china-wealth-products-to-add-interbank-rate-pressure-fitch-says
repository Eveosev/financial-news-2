China ’s interbank rates, which rose
to a record yesterday, will be under upward pressure as more
than 1.5 trillion  yuan  ($245 billion) of wealth management
products mature this month, according to  Fitch Ratings .  Mid-tier banks, with an average of 20 percent to 30 percent
of their deposits in such products, face the most difficulty as
tight liquidity constrains their ability to meet repayment
obligations, Fitch said in an e-mailed statement today. Issuance
of new products and borrowing from the  interbank market  are
among the most common sources of repayment for maturing
products, according to the ratings company.  Interbank rates spiked this week as the monetary authority
refrained from using open-market operations to address a cash
squeeze in the world’s second-largest economy. An intraday gauge
of the  overnight repurchase rate  touched a record 30 percent
yesterday and fell to 8.43 percent today, according to a daily
fixing in Shanghai after the central bank injected funds to
alleviate the crunch.  While Chinese authorities’ “hands-off” response may be
more effective in cooling shadow banking than previous efforts,
such an approach “also increases repayment risk among banks,
and raises the potential for a policy mis-step and/or unintended
consequences,” Fitch analysts led by Charlene Chu wrote in the
statement.  Chinese regulators are forcing trust funds and wealth
products to shift underlying assets into publicly traded
securities as they seek to curb lending that doesn’t involve
local banks -- so-called shadow banking.  To contact the reporter on this story:
