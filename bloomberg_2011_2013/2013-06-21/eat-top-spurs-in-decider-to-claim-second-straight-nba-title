The Miami Heat defeated the San
Antonio Spurs 95-88 in a decisive seventh game to clinch a
second straight National Basketball Association championship.  The Heat join the 1994 Houston Rockets and the Los Angeles
Lakers of 1988 and 2010 as the only teams to win the last two
games of the championship series at home since 1985.  San Antonio failed to win a fifth title and to become the
first team to take Game 7 on the road since  Washington  beat
 Seattle  in 1978. Home teams have now won six straight deciders
and 15 of 18 in total.  The Heat have won twice in three straight visits to the
title round since LeBron James joined from the Cleveland
Cavaliers. The Dallas Mavericks won in Miami in Game 6 in 2011
to earn their first NBA title and the Heat took five games to
overcome the Oklahoma City Thunder last year.  Miami, which won 27 consecutive regular-season games this
year for the second-longest run in NBA history, won two straight
games for the first time since sealing a series victory against
the Chicago Bulls in the second round of the playoffs on May 15.  Miami locked up its third NBA title as it became the first
team to successfully defend since the 2010 Los Angeles Lakers.  San Antonio failed to win the title for the first time in
six Finals appearances. Only the Bulls, who went 6-0 in the
championship round with Michael Jordan, are undefeated among
teams who have contested the Finals multiple times.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
