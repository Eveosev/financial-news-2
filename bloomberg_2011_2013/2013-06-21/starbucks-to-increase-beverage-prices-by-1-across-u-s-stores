Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) , the world’s largest
coffee-shop operator, will increase prices for some beverages at
its U.S. company-operated retail stores.  Prices will rise by a national average of 1 percent
starting June 25, and will vary slightly in different regions,
said  Jim Olson , a spokesman for the Seattle-based company. In
some areas this will be the first price increase on Starbucks
products in 18 months to two years, he said.  “The vast majority of our pricing will not change,” Olson
said in a phone interview today. “This will affect, in most
stores, less than a third of beverages sold.”  He declined to specify which beverages will increase in
price, and said the move won’t affect grande or venti sized
brewed coffee, or the company’s signature frappuccinos or
refreshers in the majority of stores.  Starbucks’s 7,000 U.S. company-operated retail stores
generated $10.5 billion in  revenue  in 2012, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The shares had  gained  17 percent in the last 12 months
through yesterday while the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index also
gained 17 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
