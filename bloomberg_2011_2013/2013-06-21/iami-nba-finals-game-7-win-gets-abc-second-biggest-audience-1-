Game 7 of the National Basketball
Association Finals on ABC, in which the  Miami Heat  won their
second-straight championship, drew 26.3 million viewers, the
network’s second-largest audience for a pro basketball game.  The seven-game series pitting the Heat against the San
Antonio Spurs averaged 17.7 million viewers, up 5 percent from
last year,  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s ESPN, which produced the telecast
for ABC, said today in an e-mailed statement.  The drama of a full series and the prospect of Heat star
 LeBron James  winning his second-straight NBA title helped build
the audience. In Miami, more than 44 percent of the households
watched game 7, while more than 46 percent of the homes in San
Antonio tuned in, ESPN said earlier. The Heat beat the Spurs
95-88.  The highest-rated pro basketball game on ABC was the 2010
Game 7 final in which the Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Boston
Celtics.  Disney, the world’s largest entertainment company,  gained 
1.2 percent to $62.73 at the close in New York. The stock has
gained 26 percent this year, compared with 12 percent for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
