TalkTalk Telecom Group Plc (TALK)  fell the
most in six weeks after Citigroup Inc. analysts said  BT Group
Plc (BT/A)  may be poised to lure broadband customers away from rivals
with its free sports programming.  TalkTalk declined 6 percent, the biggest drop since May 9,
to 220.9 pence at the close in  London . That pared the  stock ’s
gain in 12 months to 34 percent. BT advanced 1 percent today.  Citigroup advised clients to sell TalkTalk shares and buy
BT after surveying broadband users about their likelihood of
switching to BT’s service when the company’s sport channels go
live later this summer. BT Sport is giving subscribers free
access to its three channels, which will show sports including
premier league soccer and rugby hosted by broadcasting
personalities such as Clare Balding and Jake Humphrey, formerly
of the British Broadcasting Corp.  “The survey showed that a quarter of households are
interested in BT Sport and 13 percent are prepared to switch
broadband supplier or pay to get it, on top of those with BT
broadband already who can get it for free,” analyst Simon Weeden said in the note.  TalkTalk shares plunged 12 percent on May 9, the day that
the BT plan was unveiled.  British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc (BSY) ,
the U.K.’s most popular pay-TV service, fell 6.2 percent that
day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
