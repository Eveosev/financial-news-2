Brazil ’s real, Chile’s peso and
Turkey’s lira may fall “significantly” to curtail widening
current account deficits, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  The lira, South African rand and India’s rupee would need
to depreciate about 30 percent on a trade-weighted basis, while
the real and peso need to fall about 20 percent, London-based
analyst Themistoklis Fiotakis wrote in a note today. While the
assessments aren’t forecasts, they signal where the currencies
“might ultimately belong,” the analyst said.  The currencies are among the worst performers in emerging
markets over the past month, with the real falling 10 percent
since May 21, as the  Federal Reserve  signaled plans to taper off
monetary stimulus. Rising bond yields in U.S., Germany and  Japan 
are attracting funds away from  emerging markets , making it more
difficult for the countries to finance the deficits in their
current accounts, the broadest measure of international trade
and service.  “A larger exchange rate depreciation might be necessary,
which will bring external accounts back into full balance,”
Fiotakis wrote. “Although some of the recent shifts may prove
to be overshoots in the short term, the EM bond and FX selloff
of the last month is likely to constitute only a small part of a
longer trend for EM assets.”  Brazil’s current account deficit widened to a record $73
billion in the year through May,  equivalent  to 3.2 percent of
gross domestic product, according to a central bank report
today. Chile’s  deficit  reached 4 percent of the GDP in the first
quarter, the widest since 1998, while Turkey’s amounted to 5.9
percent at the end of March, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
