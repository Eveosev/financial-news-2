India , the world’s second-biggest
consumer of wheat and rice, approved sale of the grains from
state inventories to curb a rally in domestic prices, Food
Minister K.V. Thomas said. Wheat futures in Mumbai fell.  The government will sell 10 million metric tons of wheat
and 500,000 tons of rice, Thomas told reporters in New Delhi
today after a cabinet meeting. Export plans were not discussed
at the meeting, he said. The food ministry will soon send a
separate proposal to the cabinet to export 2 million tons of
wheat through state-run trading companies at a minimum price of
$300 a ton, he said.  Futures in Mumbai rallied 14 percent since the start of
April, compared with a 6.2 percent increase in prices in  Chicago 
during the same period. India may not be able to export at
higher prices as wheat from the  Black Sea region  is cheaper.  Wheat from Russia and Ukraine costs $260 to $270 a ton,
said Tejinder Narang, an adviser with  Emmsons International
Ltd. (EMSI) , a New Delhi-based trader. The highest bid for State
Trading Corp.’s 100,000-ton wheat tender, which was opened
yesterday, was for $300.40 a ton, while two other bidders quoted
less than $300, he said.  Wheat futures for delivery in July on the National
Commodity & Derivatives Exchange Ltd. were at 1,573 rupees per
100 kilograms (220 pounds) at 1:55 p.m. in Mumbai, down from as
high as 1,594 rupees earlier. The September-delivery contract
fell 0.4 percent to $7.05 a bushel on the Chicago Board of
Trade.  The government will sell 8.5 million tons of wheat to bulk
buyers including biscuit and bread makers at a base price of
15,000 rupees ($252.59) a ton, Thomas said. Traders will have to
bid for the wheat, he said. The remaining 1.5 million tons will
be offered to state governments, small traders and cooperatives
at the base price, he said.  The cabinet may next week consider a plan to sell 7.5
million tons of wheat and rice to the poor at subsidized rates,
he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
