Standard Chartered Plc’s  Asia  units
have sold a record amount of structured notes in 2013, led by
issuance in South Korea.  The bank’s South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong units
raised the equivalent of $2.5 billion this year as of June 17
from securities tied to  interest rates , credit and foreign
exchange, the most for any full-year period, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Sales in South Korea, which surged almost
three-fold, accounted for 75 percent, the data show.  Issuance of structured notes in Asia’s fourth-largest
economy accelerated this year on demand for high-yielding
investments. London-based Standard Chartered is increasing its
dominance in the market, almost doubling its share to 74 percent
as of the end of May, according to data compiled by Bloomberg,
which doesn’t track securities issued by brokerages.  Valerie Tay, a Singapore-based spokeswoman for  Standard
Chartered , declined to comment on the company’s structured-note
issuance in Asia.  Structured notes can allow banks to raise funds cheaply as
the lenders can effectively sell on the securities from their
swap counterparts to investors at lower costs than what they
would pay for regular-debt issuance, according to Chae Kyu
Cheol, a researcher at Nice Pricing & Information, a Seoul-based
bond pricing agency. The products also incur extra
administrative expenses, he said.  Diversifying tenors, coupon types and counterparties
through structured-note issuance is positive for the lender,
said Sabine Bauer, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Fitch Ratings,
which rates the bank at  AA- (STAN) , its fourth-highest level.  To contact the reporter on this story:
