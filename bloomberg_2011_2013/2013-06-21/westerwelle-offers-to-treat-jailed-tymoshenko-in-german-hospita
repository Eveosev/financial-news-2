German Foreign Minister  Guido Westerwelle  said his country is ready to offer medical treatment
to Ukraine’s jailed former Prime Minister  Yulia Tymoshenko  and
urged the former Soviet state to end “selective justice.”  Westerwelle met Ukraine’s President Viktor Yanukovych today
in Kiev as the eastern European nation seeks to reach an accord
with the European Union.  Ukraine planned to sign an EU Association Agreement in
December 2011 that includes free trade area with the 27-nation
bloc. The pact has been delayed by the imprisonment of
Tymoshenko for abuse of office, a move the EU deems selective
justice. Tymoshenko, who has been in a hospital since May 2012
because of back pain, also faces a murder charge. The EU wants
Ukraine to release Tymoshenko and improve its judiciary and
electoral system in order to sign the accord in November.  “The question of Tymoshenko remains pressing,” said
Westerwelle in remarks broadcast by Ukrainian private TV Channel
5. “There is not much time left and Ukraine still needs to do a
lot” for the accord.  Westerwelle said that Tymoshenko has “all rights for a
fair trial and necessary medical treatment.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
