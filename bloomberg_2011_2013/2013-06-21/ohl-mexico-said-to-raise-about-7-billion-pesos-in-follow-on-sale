OHL Mexico SAB (OHLMEX*) , the Mexican unit of
Spanish construction company  Obrascon Huarte Lain SA (OHL) , raised
about 7 billion pesos ($525 million) in a follow-on offering
yesterday, according to two people with direct knowledge of the
deal.  The total includes an overallotment option for
underwriters, said the people, who asked not to be named because
the details are still private. The price of 29 pesos per share
represents a 2.8 percent discount to yesterday’s closing value
of 29.84 pesos.  Alberto Guajardo, an investor relations official with
 Mexico  City-based OHL Mexico, didn’t respond to phone calls and
e-mails seeking comment on the offering price.  OHL Mexico planned the share sale to replenish cash,
finance its investment plan and pay some  debt , according to an
investor presentation posted on the website of the Mexican stock
exchange.  OHL Mexico builds and helps operate infrastructure in  Latin
America ’s second-biggest economy including toll roads, bridges
and the Toluca airport close to Mexico City, which the company
says will benefit from spillover as the capital’s airport nears
maximum capacity.  The construction company sold the shares as emerging-market
stock indexes plunged after the U.S. Federal Reserve signaled on
June 19 it may pare monetary stimulus. Mexico’s benchmark IPC
index of 35 companies has  plummeted  4.9 percent in the past two
days, the worst rout since September 2011, and the nation’s
currency depreciated 3.5 percent against the dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
