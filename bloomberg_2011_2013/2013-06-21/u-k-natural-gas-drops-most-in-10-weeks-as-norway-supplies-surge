U.K. natural gas for same-day
delivery dropped the most in almost 10 weeks after supplies from
 Norway  surged and temperatures remained above normal for the
season.  The  within-day  contract fell as much as 7.3 percent to
54.95 pence a therm, the biggest drop since April 15, according
to broker data compiled by Bloomberg. It was at 55.30 pence at
10:20 a.m. in  London , equivalent to $8.56 per million British
thermal units.  Gas flows into Britain from Norway rose to as high as 98
million cubic meters a day today before dropping to 62 million,
the average for the past 30 days, according to data from Gassco
AS, Norway’s pipeline operator. The Norpipe from Norway into
 Germany  is shut for three weeks starting June 3, cutting flows
into the Emden gas terminal.  Day-ahead U.K. gas  has averaged 70 pence this year, 19
percent more than in the same period last year, the broker data
show.  Demand will be 175 million cubic meters today, according to
a forecast by  National Grid Plc (NG/)  at 10:02 a.m. That would be the
lowest since Sept. 29.  The nation’s pipelines will contain 375 million cubic
meters at 6 a.m. tomorrow, compared with 340 million today, the
network manager said.  The average U.K. temperature for the balance of day will be
17.4 degrees Celsius (63 Fahrenheit), compared with a seasonal
normal of 14.4 degrees, according to MetraWeather data using the
ECMWF model on Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
