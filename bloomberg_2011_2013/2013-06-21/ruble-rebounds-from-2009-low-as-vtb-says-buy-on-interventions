The ruble rebounded from the lowest
level in almost four years after oil jumped and VTB Capital
recommended buying the currency as  Russia ’s central bank slows
declines with stronger interventions.  The ruble dropped 0.7 percent against the central bank’s
dollar-euro basket to 37.5602 by 1:15 p.m. in Moscow, rallying
from the weakest close since September 2009. The ruble is down
2.9 percent in the week, heading for its steepest five-day slump
since June 3 last year.  Russia’s bonds and currency joined a global rout yesterday
after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the
central bank may cut bond purchases that have fueled asset-price
gains, and end the program in 2014 should risks to the  U.S.
economy  abate. After the ruble’s recent selloff the central bank
might increase its daily interventions to about $400 million
from about $200 million on June 18 and June 19, VTB Capital
analysts Maxim Korovin and Anton Nikitin said.  “Interventions would provide strong resistance against a
weaker ruble in the short term,” they wrote in an e-mailed
note, recommending investors sell the dollar and basket against
the ruble.  The central bank has spent the equivalent of 58.6 billion
rubles ($1.8 billion) of foreign currency since May 29 to curb
the ruble’s slide. Bank Rossii, which reports currency
intervention data with a delay and steps up interventions if the
ruble weakens beyond certain levels,  spent  the equivalent of
6.43 billion rubles on June 19.  Brent oil rose 0.8 percent to $102.92 per barrel after
tumbling 3.7 percent yesterday. Crude and natural gas provide
about 50 percent of Russian state revenue.  Rising Volatility  The ruble strengthened 0.7 percent to the dollar to
32.8235, giving it a 3.4 percent loss in the last five days, the
sixth-worst performance among 24 emerging-market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg.  The ruble’s three-month volatility rose two basis points to
11.4975, the highest since October 2012, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  The yield on benchmark OFZ bonds due February 2027 declined
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 7.96 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
