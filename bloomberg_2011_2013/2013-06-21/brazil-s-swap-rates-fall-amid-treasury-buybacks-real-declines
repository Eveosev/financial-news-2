Brazil ’s swap rates dropped for the
first time in six days as investors speculated the Treasury’s
buyback auctions will reduce bond yields after a six-week rout.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2015 fell 17
basis points, or 0.17 percentage point, to 10.29 percent at
10:23 a.m. in Sao Paulo, paring their increase this week to 72
basis points. The real dropped for a sixth straight day,
depreciating 0.1 percent to 2.2605 per dollar.  The Treasury plans to buy back fixed- and floating-rate
debt today in the fourth unscheduled auction in a week to
bolster demand for the securities amid a market rout fueled by
concern that the  Federal Reserve  will curtail stimulus. The real
has tumbled 4.9 percent this week, the worst performance among
24 emerging-market currencies.  “It’s positive that the Treasury is doing these auctions
because it helps to calm the market,” Ures Folchini, the head
of fixed income at Banco WestLB do Brasil SA in Sao Paulo, said
in a telephone interview. “Brazil is going to continue to
follow external markets.”  Consumer prices as measured by the IPCA-15 index rose 0.38
percent in the month through mid-June, the national statistics
agency reported today. The median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg was for an increase of 0.36 percent.
Annual inflation accelerated to 6.67 percent, higher than the
6.50 percent upper level of the central bank’s target range.  To contact the reporters on this story:
