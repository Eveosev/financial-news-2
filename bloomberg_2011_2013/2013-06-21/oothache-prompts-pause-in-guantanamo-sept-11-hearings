A fifth day of pretrial hearings in
the case against five men accused of masterminding the Sept. 11,
2001, terrorist attacks paused when the military judge refused
to proceed until learning more about one suspect’s toothache.  The judge, U.S. Army Colonel James Pohl, halted proceedings
for an hour this morning at the naval base in Guantanamo Bay,
Cuba, because he wasn’t sure why Ammar al Baluchi wasn’t in
court. The judge sent a military officer back to al Baluchi’s
cell at a distant prison camp to ask whether he waived his
attendance because of the toothache or for some other reason.  “At this point before me, I have an issue of non-waiver,”
Pohl said at the start of today’s hearing.  The adjournment was the latest delay in legal proceedings
that are moving at a snail’s pace. Entire weeks of pretrial
hearings have been lost because of weather or technical
problems, while other logistical glitches, along with related
legal issues, have slowed days of testimony.  Al Baluchi, who’s accused of helping finance the attacks,
and his uncle, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, are among five defendants
facing trial for organizing the hijacking of passenger airplanes
that killed almost 3,000 people when they were crashed into the
World Trade Center in  Manhattan , the Pentagon in  Virginia , and
in a field in  Pennsylvania .  The five may face the death penalty if convicted before a
military tribunal. They are charged with conspiring to finance,
train and direct the 19 hijackers who seized the four planes, as
well as terrorism, hijacking aircraft, conspiracy, murder in
violation of the laws of war and attacking civilians. A trial is
at least a year away.  Military Witness  The five detainees have been in court for a week of
hearings, which the judge seeks to schedule every other month.
Whenever a defendant elects not to attend court, a military
officer begins the day by taking the witness stand and
testifying about his absence.  Today, Lt. Commander George Massucco testified about the
absence of two defendants, al Baluchi and Mustafa al Hawsawi,
who’s also accused of helping finance the attacks.  Massucco said he went to al Baluchi’s cell shortly before
6 a.m. and asked if he wanted to attend. Al Baluchi, also known
as Ali Abdul Aziz Ali, put a hand to his face and said no,
complaining of a toothache and possibly a broken tooth, Massucco
said.  On cross-examination, defense lawyer James Connell began
asking about the extent of his client’s toothache and whether he
was receiving medical attention. That prompted Pohl to ask why
Connell was posing such questions. Connell said he wanted to
know why his client elected to skip court: because of his
toothache or for some other reason.  Chipped Tooth  Pohl called an adjournment to learn more about al Baluchi’s
toothache and whether his decision not to appear in court was
voluntary. An hour later, Massucco returned to say al Baluchi
had intended to appear in court until chipping a tooth last
night. Al Baluchi said his waiver was voluntarily, Massucco
said.  With hearings resumed, Connell questioned a military lawyer
about a search of legal documents in the detainees’ possession
and about prison rules that the defense says interferes with the
lawyer-client relationship.  One such rule bars the defense lawyers from showing their
clients documents about the historical nature of jihad.  A broadcast of the testimony was viewed by reporters at
