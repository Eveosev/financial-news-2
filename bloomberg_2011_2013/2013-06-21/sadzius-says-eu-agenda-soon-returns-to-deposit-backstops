European Union finance ministers
will soon turn their attention to standardizing national
deposit-guarantee schemes, Lithuanian Finance Minister Rimantas Sadzius said today.  “I think it will come up very soon,” said Sadzius, whose
nation in July will take over the EU’s rotating administrative
presidency. “It is another very urgent question, especially
keeping in mind that we will have European elections next
year.”  The deposit-guarantee rules, proposed in 2010, will set
standards for how each nation protects bank accounts up to
100,000 euros ($131,000) as guaranteed by EU law. The rules have
been on hold while the EU wrestles with other elements of its
banking union strategy. In Luxembourg today, talks among the 27
nations focused on new rules on how to prop up or shut down
failing banks without triggering a new round of crisis.  Sadzius said nations need to move quickly in order to hold
negotiations on the deposit-guarantee rules with the current
European Parliament, one more item on an already crowded agenda.
He said Lithuania’s EU presidency will put financial-sector
issues at the top of its agenda.  “The overall topic of banking union, in all its diversity,
will stay on our table,” Sadzius said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
