Euro-area finance ministers may need
to hold additional meetings ahead of leaders’ summits of the 17-nation bloc, according to a work program posted on the
Eurogroup’s  website .  “In order to ensure an optimal preparation of euro summit
meetings, adjustments might be needed to the Eurogroup meeting
calendar,” the Eurogroup said. “It may be considered to have
an additional dedicated Eurogroup meeting before Euro summit
meetings.”  Euro-area finance ministers will discuss Greece,  Spain  and
the bloc’s overall economic condition when they next meet July 8
in Brussels, the work program said. In September, they will
discuss rescue programs in Cyprus, Portugal and Ireland, and in
October they are again scheduled to discuss Spain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
