Serbia  is expected to be a
“significant” grains exporter this year with about 1 million
metric tons of wheat available for international buyers,
according to the country’s Chamber of Commerce.  Harvesting began a week early in the northern breadbasket
region of Vojvodina “because wheat is ripening faster now due
to hot weather,” Milan Prostran, the Agriculture Secretary of
the Serbian Chamber of Commerce, said in an interview in
Belgrade today.  Yields are expected to top 5 tons per hectare (2.47 acres)
in Vojvodina and between 3.5 to 4 tons in central Serbia,
producing about 2.3 million tons of wheat, Prostran said. This
would leave the country with “a surplus of around 1 million
tons and we will become a serious exporter after two years when
we were selling between 500,000 and 600,000 tons a year.”  Wheat output will rise 22 percent year-on-year to 2.3
million tons from 557,396 hectares, with average yields rising
to 4.17 tons from 3.97 tons per hectare in 2012, the Statistics
Office said yesterday. The nation typically consumes about 1.3
million tons of wheat a year.  Grain traders will continue to supply neighboring Bosnia-Herzegovina, Montenegro, Macedonia and Albania, while seeking
new markets in the  Middle East  and relying on  Egypt  for some
amount, Prostran said.  He expects greater global and domestic output to depress
domestic wheat prices this year.  The price of last year’s crop dropped 0.75 percent to trade
at 22.38 dinars per kilogram or $260 per ton at the Novi Sad
Commodity Exchange today, according to the bourse’s website.  “The price of around 20 dinars per kilo could be
sufficient to cover all the production costs, still the price
for new wheat may fall to between 17 and 19 dinars per
kilogram,” Prostran said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
