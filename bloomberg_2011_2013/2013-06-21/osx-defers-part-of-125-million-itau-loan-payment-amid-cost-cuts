Billionarie  Eike Batista ’s  OSX
Brasil SA (OSXB3)  oil shipper, the worst performing Latin American stock
this year, rescheduled part of a $125 million debt payment to
Banco Itau BBA SA due today as it struggles to cut costs.  “The company’s financial management routine includes
assessing short-term debts, whose scheduled payments the company
has partly been paying and partly postponing,” Rio de Janeiro-based OSX said in an e-mailed response to questions, without
disclosing any amounts or dates. Today’s deadline was to pay
half of a $250 million loan from the Sao Paulo-based bank’s
Nassau branch in 2012, according to a June 20 Credit Agricole SA
note to clients.  OSX has plunged 85 percent this year after its main client,
Batista’s OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA oil producer,
repeatedly failed to meet production targets. That was the
biggest drop of more than 700 Latin American stocks worth at
least $100 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  A judge this week issued an injunction for OSX to rehire
about 300 workers it fired in May after scaling back
construction of a shipyard.  OSX was created by Batista primarily to supply platforms to
oil producer OGX, his flagship enterprise. OGX had its  credit
rating  cut by  Fitch Ratings  last week to CCC, or seven levels
below investment grade, on concern that it will run out of cash
by year-end after missing production targets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
