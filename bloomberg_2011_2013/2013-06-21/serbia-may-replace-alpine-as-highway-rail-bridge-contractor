Koridori Srbije ,  Serbia ’s state-run
road development company, may replace a local unit of Alpine Bau
GmbH as the highway contractor after the Austrian builder filed
for insolvency.  Alpine is making parts of the Balkan nation’s north-south
highway, with an eastern offshoot to  Bulgaria , worth a combined
59.3 million euros ($78.4 million). Koridori may call new
tenders complete the sections if Alpine confirms it can’t carry
on, Belgrade-based company said in an e-mailed statement. The
stretches with bridges and tunnels near the southeastern town of
Dimitrovgrad are financed by the  World Bank  and the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development.  Alpine, owned by  Fomento de Construcciones & Contratas SA ,
also signed a 9 million-euro contract with Serbia’s national
rail company Zeleznice Srbije in 2010 to build a rail bridge by
August 2012.  The structure is only 20 percent complete, even after
Zeleznice paid the full amount from a  European Investment Bank 
loan, and the company is now “reviewing options how to
proceed” with the project, said Nenad Stanisavljevic,
Zeleznice’s spokesman in a phone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
