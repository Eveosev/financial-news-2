Pork inventories in the U.S.
rose 4.1 percent at the end of May from a year earlier, the
government said, as overseas demand for U.S. meat slowed.  Warehouses held 661.786 million pounds of pork, up
from  636.017  million on May 31, 2012, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said today in a report. Inventories fell 5.6
percent from a revised 700.977 million pounds at the end of
April that was larger than initially reported.  U.S.  exporters  shipped 1.61 billion pounds (732,444
metric tons) of pork in the four months through April 30,
down 15 percent from the same period a year earlier, the
latest USDA data show. Pork production is projected to rise
0.7 percent this year and add another 2.6 percent in 2014,
the government has forecast.  “Part of the deal is January, March, even though
April, exports in pork have not been too good,”  Bob Brown ,
an independent market consultant in Edmond,  Oklahoma , said
in a telephone interview before the report. “Whenever
you’re at a particular level of exports, and then it drops
off, the market has a hard time getting adjusted to that.”  Hog futures for August settlement fell 0.7 percent to
97.6 cents a pound at 8:01 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Prices advanced 15 percent this year through
yesterday.  As of May 31, stockpiles of  pork bellies , which are
cured and sliced to make bacon, fell 16.6 percent from a
year earlier to 54.740 million pounds, according to today’s
report. Warehouse supplies of ham rose 21.5 percent from a
year earlier to 156.550 million pounds.  Chicken-meat inventories at the end of May were 5.9
percent larger than a year earlier at 679.338 million
pounds, the USDA said. Beef supplies fell 3.9 percent to
478.528 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
