Soybeans fell, poised for a second
weekly decline, on speculation that a cash squeeze in  China  may
cap economic growth and slow purchases from the world’s biggest
buyer. Corn dropped.  Soybeans for delivery in November lost as much as 0.6
percent to $12.7775 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, and
were at $12.795 by 11:23 a.m. in  Singapore . The contract is
heading for a 1.4 percent drop this week after a 2.4 percent
loss in the previous five-day period.  Interbank lending rates spiked in China this week to
records because of a cash crunch, amid waning confidence about
the prospects for the world’s second-largest economy. The rates
retreated today after the monetary authority was said to have
made funds available to lenders. Total net U.S. soybean export
sales fell 66 percent to 161,113 metric tons in the week ending
June 13 from a week earlier, Department of Agriculture data show.  “Weaker Chinese economic activity is raising fears for a
marked slowdown in oilseed import demand this year, which in
turn is weighing on prices,”  Luke Mathews , a strategist at
 Commonwealth Bank of Australia , wrote in a report today.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley and UBS AG have
cut their 2013 growth forecasts for China as the country’s
industrial output and exports slowed.  Corn for delivery in December, after the U.S. harvest, lost
0.3 percent to $5.59 a bushel, falling for a second day. Wheat
for September delivery gained 0.4 percent to $7.0105 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
