The following is the text of
 Canada ’s  consumer price index  report for May released
by  Statistics Canada .  The Consumer  Price Index  (CPI) rose 0.7% in the 12 months
to May, following a 0.4% increase in April. The year-over-year
rise in the May CPI was led by higher shelter costs, notably
natural gas.  Natural gas prices advanced 15.4% in the 12 months to May,
the largest increase since December 2008. The May increase was
the third year-over-year gain in four months in the natural gas
index. These increases came after 25 consecutive declines.  Natural gas prices rose on a year-over-year basis in May
across the country, with Alberta posting the largest advance.  12-month change in the major components  For the second consecutive month, the shelter and food
components were the main upward contributors to the rise in the
CPI, while the transportation component was the main downward
contributor.  Shelter costs rose 1.3% in the 12 months to May, matching
the increase in April. In addition to natural gas, rent and
property taxes rose on a year-over-year basis. In contrast,
mortgage interest cost declined 4.1%.  Food prices rose 1.3% year over year in May, after
increasing 1.5% in April. Compared with May 2012, consumers paid
more for food purchased from stores, notably fresh vegetables
(+5.8%) and bakery products (+3.9%). Prices for fresh fruit and
meat also rose in the 12 months to May, although at a slower
rate than in April.  Transportation prices fell 0.5% in May compared with the
same month a year earlier, following a 2.1% decrease in April.
The smaller decline in the transportation index was led by
gasoline prices, which fell less in the 12 months to May (-1.5%)
compared with April (-6.0%). Prices for the purchase of
passenger vehicles also decreased year over year in May.  Prices for alcoholic beverages and tobacco products
advanced 2.5% on a year-over-year basis in May, led by higher
prices for cigarettes in most provinces. Consumers also paid
2.1% more for alcoholic beverages purchased from stores, notably
beer.  12-month change in the provinces  Consumer prices rose in eight provinces in the 12 months to
May with the largest increase occurring in  Alberta . The
exceptions were New Brunswick and British Columbia, where prices
declined on a year-over-year basis.  Prices in Alberta rose 2.3% in the 12 months to May
following a 1.3% increase in April. Compared with the same month
a year ago, consumers paid 1.6% more for gasoline in May after
paying 7.4% less in April. The year-over-year increase in
natural gas prices was also a contributor to the rise in
Alberta’s CPI.  Prices in British Columbia fell 0.6% in the 12 months to
May after declining 0.8% in April. British Columbia was the lone
province to record a year-over-year price decline for food
purchased from restaurants. Homeowners’ replacement cost also
decreased.  In  New Brunswick , consumer prices decreased 0.1% in the 12
months to May following a 0.2% decline in April. Compared with
the national average, the province posted larger year-over-year
price decreases for gasoline (-5.4%) and for prescribed
medicines (-15.2%).  Seasonally adjusted monthly Consumer Price Index increases  On a seasonally adjusted

( http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/62-001-x/2013005/technote-notetech2-eng.htm ) rose 1.1% in the 12 months to May, matching
the increase in April.  On a monthly basis, the seasonally adjusted core index
