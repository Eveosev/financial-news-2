Federal authorities have filed
charges against former National Security Agency contractor
Edward Snowden and asked the government in Hong Kong to detain
him, the Washington Post reported.  The charges were in a sealed complaint filed in the Eastern
District of Virginia, according to the Post, citing unnamed U.S.
officials. Snowden most recently worked for federal contractor
 Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corp. (BAH) , which is based in McLean,
Virginia.  Snowden, 29, disclosed two secret government surveillance
programs that collect telephone and Internet data to the Post
and U.K.â€™s Guardian newspaper. The Guardian reported he is in
hiding in Hong Kong.  To contact the reporter on this story:
