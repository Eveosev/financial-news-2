France’s cost of borrowing for 10
years tumbled to a record low before the  European Central Bank ’s
interest-rate decision today.  The treasury sold 4.02 billion euros ($5.3 billion) of 2023
debt at an average yield of 1.81 percent, less than the previous
record of 1.94 percent set a month ago. It also sold 990 million
euros of 2032 bonds and 2.92 billion euros of 2021 bonds.  The record-low borrowing costs come as ECB President  Mario Draghi  is expected to react to plunging European inflation and
economic confidence by trimming the central bank’s benchmark
rate by a quarter-point to a record low of 0.5 percent,
according to 44 out of 70 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  “An interest rate cut makes sense,” Tobias Blattner and
Emily Nicol, economists at Daiwa Capital Markets in  London , said
in a note to clients. “By cutting its refinancing rate, the ECB
would send a strong signal that rates will stay at record low
levels for some time to come.”  In France, the euro area’s second-largest economy, jobless
claims have jumped to a record high of 3.22 million, while the
 consumer price index  has dropped for seven straight months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
