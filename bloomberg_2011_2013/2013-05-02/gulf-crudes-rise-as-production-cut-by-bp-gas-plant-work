Gulf Coast crudes strengthened as work
was reported to be starting at a gas-processing plant in
Pascagoula,  Mississippi , that handles offshore  Gulf of Mexico 
production.  Thunder Horse  gained 80 cents to a premium of $10 over
domestic benchmark West Texas Intermediate at 2:47 p.m.
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Production of that
crude and other Gulf Coast oils will be shut in, said James
Flores, chairman and president of  Plains Exploration &
Production Co. (PXP) , on the company’s first quarter earnings call.  “We do have this unscheduled shut in of the BP gas plant
at Pascagoula, Mississippi, for maintenance,” Flores said.
“It’s shutting in a tremendous amount of oil production in the
Gulf of Mexico, it’s shutting in Thunder Horse, Na Kika, Horn
Mountain, Marlin, and so forth for 36 days.”  Light Louisiana Sweet strengthened by 30 cents to $11.30 a
barrel over WTI at 2:47 p.m., according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet rose by 25 cents to $11.75 a
barrel over WTI.  Eugene Island crude and Bonito Sour gained 35 cents each to
$9.45 over WTI.  Poseidon’s premium strengthened 80 cents to a $7.50-a-
barrel premium and Mars Blend gained 45 cents to $7.40 a barrel
over WTI. Southern Green Canyon rose 40 cents a barrel to a
$6.50 premium.  Bakken weakened $1.25 a barrel to a discount of $3.50 a
barrel against WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
