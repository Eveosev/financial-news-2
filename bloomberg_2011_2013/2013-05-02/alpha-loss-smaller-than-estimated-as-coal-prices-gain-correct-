(Corrects headline to say loss instead of profit.)  Alpha Natural Resources Inc. (ANR) , the
second-biggest U.S. coal producer, posted a smaller-than-
estimated first-quarter loss after an increase in the price of
the commodity mined in the Western U.S. and sold to power
utilities.  The net loss widened to $110.8 million, or 50 cents per
share, from $28.8 million, or 13 cents, a year earlier, the
Bristol, Virginia-based company said in a statement today. The
loss excluding restructuring costs and other one-time items was
47 cents, smaller than the 57-cent average of 23 analystsâ€™
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales fell to $1.33 billion
from $1.93 billion, exceeding the $1.32 billion average of 14
estimates.  The price of thermal coal extracted in the Powder River
Basin -- an area than straddles states including  Wyoming , where
Alpha operates two mines -- averaged $9.74 a ton in the first
quarter, 6.9 percent higher than a year earlier. U.S. demand for
coal used to generate electricity has recovered as the price of
natural gas, a competing fuel, has risen from a decade low
reached a year ago.  Alpha has cut about half of its production in the central
Appalachian region since it purchased Massey Energy Co. in 2011.  Alpha rose 0.7 percent to $7.47 in New York yesterday. The
shares have tumbled 52 percent in the past 12 months.  Peabody Energy Corp. is the biggest U.S. coal producer by
revenue.  (Alpha has scheduled a conference call at 10 a.m.  New York 
time. Dial +1-877-407-8029.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
