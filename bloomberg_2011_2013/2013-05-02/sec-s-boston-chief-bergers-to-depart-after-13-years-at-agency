David Bergers, the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission’s acting deputy chief of enforcement, is
leaving the agency.  Bergers, 45, who has spent about 13 years at the SEC,
became head of the agency’s Boston office in 2006, the agency
said today in a statement. He will depart the agency “this
spring,” according to the statement.  “David has been a tremendous asset to the agency,” SEC
Chairman Mary Jo White said in a statement. “Not only does he
have a deep understanding of the laws we enforce, but he also
has a deep appreciation for the mission of the SEC.”  Bergers has led hundreds of investigations into investment
and financial fraud, and also played a central role in the 2010
restructuring of the enforcement unit and the writing of rules
for the agency’s whistleblower program, the SEC said. Bergers
also received the agency’s Stanley Sporkin award in 2010 for
exceptional work in securities enforcement, the SEC said.  Bergers earned a law degree from Yale Law School in 1992
and also holds a bachelor’s degree from Eastern Nazarene College
in Quincy,  Massachusetts .  “I have been incredibly fortunate to serve alongside the
agency’s talented and dedicated staff working hard every day to
protect investors,” Bergers said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
