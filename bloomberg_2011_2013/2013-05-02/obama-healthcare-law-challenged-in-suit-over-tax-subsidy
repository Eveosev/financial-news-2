Opponents of the Obama
administration’s health-care overhaul sued the U.S. over an 
Internal Revenue Service  rule that extends tax subsidies to
individuals in states that declined to set up insurance
exchanges authorized under the law.  The individual subsidies by law were supposed to be
available only in states that had agreed to set up insurance
exchanges as clearinghouses for the purchase of medical
coverage, according to a complaint filed today in federal court
in  Washington .  By providing the subsidies in the 33 states that declined
to set up exchanges, the healthcare overhaul, known as the
Affordable Care Act, makes insurance “less unaffordable,”
according to the complaint. It subjects some people to “a
requirement to purchase costly, comprehensive health insurance
that they otherwise would forgo,” the plaintiffs claimed.  At the same time, the extension of the allegedly unlawful
subsidies triggers financial penalties against some businesses
that don’t offer employees health coverage, according to the
complaint.  The lawsuit was filed by seven individuals and businesses
from seven states that have opted not to set up their own
insurance exchanges. The federal government will operate
exchanges in states opting out of establishing their own.  The case is Halbig v. Sebelius, 13-cv-00623, U.S District
Court,  District of Columbia  (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
