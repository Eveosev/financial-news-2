A  Medtronic Inc. (MDT)  device used to
stimulate the brain to treat Parkinson’s disease and other
neurological conditions has a potentially life-threatening flaw
that triggered the highest-level warning from U.S. regulators.  The wires on the ends of Medtronic’s deep brain stimulators
can be damaged by a cap designed to protect the delicate
electronics while they are being inserted, the Minneapolis-based
company said today in a statement. The wires, known as leads,
can be harmed when the connections inside the cap are twisted
during surgery or when the cap is removed.  The U.S.  Food and Drug Administration  classified the issue
as a Class 1 recall, meaning there is a reasonable probability
that the defect could cause serious health consequences or
death. Medtronic alerted physicians to the problem in February
and has changed the manufacturing in an effort to fix the issue.
The change is under FDA review.  The wires may need to be replaced for the patient to get
proper treatment if there is extensive damage, the company said.
The caps aren’t used in all surgeries to implant the deep brain
stimulators and they don’t always cause harm. If the patients
receive therapy as expected after the device is implanted, they
aren’t likely to be affected by the flaw, the company said.  Deep brain stimulation uses electrical pulses to treat
 Parkinson’s disease , tremors, obsessive-compulsive disorder and
painful, involuntary muscle contractions known as  dystonia . It
is also used outside of the U.S. for hard-to-treat epilepsy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
