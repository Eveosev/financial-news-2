New World Development Co. (17) , the  Hong
Kong  builder controlled by billionaire  Cheng Yu-tung , received
permission from the city’s stock exchange to proceed with the
separate listing of the company’s local hotels.  The three hotels will be listed by means of “stapled”
securities including shares and preferred shares in NW Hotel
Investments Co. and units in NW Hotel Investments trust,
according to a Hong Kong stock exchange filing yesterday.  The company said it hadn’t determined how much it plans to
raise through the sale. New World may seek as much as $1 billion
in a hospitality listing, two people with knowledge of the
matter said in March. At $1 billion, the IPO would be the
biggest in Hong Kong since People’s Insurance Company Group of
China Ltd. raised $3.6 billion in November.  After the listing, New World will hold at least 35 percent
of the units and its parent, Chow Tai Fook Enterprises Ltd.,
will own more than 50 percent. New World will consolidate the
hotel company’s results into its own financial statements and
said it doesn’t need shareholder approval to proceed.  The new company plans to pay out to shareholders all of its
distributable income in the period from the listing through June
30, 2015, and 90 percent after that, according to the filing.  The spinoff will hold New World’s interests in the Grand
Hyatt Hong Kong, Renaissance Harbour View Hotel Hong Kong and
Hyatt Regency Hong Kong, according to the filing. New World said
it will offer to sell its Hyatt Regency Sha Tin stake to the new
company when it has necessary consents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
