Minerva SA, Brazil’s third-largest
beef producer, advanced the most in seven weeks after  Standard &
Poor’s  raised its  credit rating  by one level.  The shares gained 3.3 percent to 11.77 reais at 1:26 p.m.
in Sao Paulo, the biggest one-day gain since March 13 on a
closing basis. The BM&FBovespa Small Cap index fell 0.1 percent,
resuming trading after a holiday on May 1. The meatpacker’s
bonds rose 0.3 cent to 107.77 cents on the dollar, the highest
price since April 11.  S&P raised the Barretos-based company’s rating to BB-, or
three levels below investment grade, after markets closed on
April 30, citing its improved capital structure and liquidity
levels. Minerva has increased gross margins and cash-flow
generation, according to S&P.  “Cattle prices will continue to be favorable in the next
two to three years, contributing to Minerva’s gradually
improving credit metrics,” S&P analysts wrote in the report.  Minerva shares have gained 4.6 percent this year, while the
small cap index dropped 3.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
