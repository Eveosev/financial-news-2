China ’s benchmark  stock  index fell
after a three-day holiday as reports showed weaker growth in the
nation’s manufacturing and industrial companies’ profits.  Jiangxi Copper Co., the largest producer of the metal,
dropped 2.8 percent after forecasting a 50 percent slump in
first-half profit. Sany Heavy Industry Co. paced declines for
construction-related stocks after reporting lower profit. China
Vanke Co. led developers higher after home sales rose in April.
Official and private manufacturing data over the past two days
showed a weaker expansion, adding to concerns the nation’s
economic slowdown is extending into the second quarter.  The  Shanghai Composite (SHCOMP)  fell 0.2 percent to 2,174.32 at 1:02
p.m. local time, even as 493 stocks gained and 406 dropped. The
CSI 300 Index was little changed at 2,447.69. China’s financial
markets were shut from April 29 through May 1. The  Hang Seng
China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  dropped 0.9 percent.  After the manufacturing reports, “there are expectations
the economy will continue sliding,” Liu Guangming, an analyst
at Dongxing Securities Co., said today from Beijing. “Earnings
lack positive surprises. There’s hardly any positive news to
push up stocks today.”  The Bloomberg China-US 55 Index lost 1.4 percent yesterday,
with U.S.-traded shares of  Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd.  sliding
2.5 percent from an almost three-week high and Yanzhou Coal
Mining Co. retreating to a four-year low. The Standard & Poor’s
500 Index slipped 0.9 percent.  Manufacturing Slowdown  The Shanghai gauge has slumped 11 percent from a Feb. 6
high on concern slowing growth is hurting  earnings . The index
trades at 11.6 times reported profit, compared with the five-
year average of 16.9, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  Gauges of energy and material stocks in the CSI 300
declined 1.6 percent, the most among 10 industry groups. Jiangxi
Copper plunged 2.9 percent to 20.23 yuan after posting a 32
percent slide in first-quarter profit. China Shenhua Energy Co.,
the biggest coal producer, slumped 1.5 percent to 20.19 yuan.  China’s official  Purchasing Managers’ Index (CPMINDX)  fell to 50.6,
the National Bureau of Statistics and China Federation of
Logistics and Purchasing said yesterday, falling short of a 50.7
median forecast of 31 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey and a
March reading of 50.9. A private survey by HSBC Holdings Plc and
Markit Economics had a final reading of 50.4 for April, down
from the preliminary level of 50.5, a report today showed.
Readings above 50 signal expansion.  A gauge of new orders showed growth at a five-month low and
an output index rose at a weaker pace, according to today’s
statement. A measure of new export orders showed a contraction,
mirroring a drop reported yesterday by the government.  Profits Slump  Sany Heavy, the biggest maker of construction machinery,
slid 2.3 percent to 9.54  yuan  after saying first-quarter net
profit slumped 44 percent from a year earlier. China Eastern
Airlines Corp., the second-biggest domestic carrier, dropped 1.6
percent to 3.01 yuan.  Net income for industrial companies increased 5.3 percent
in March from a year earlier to 464.9 billion yuan ($75
billion), down from a 17.2 percent pace in the first two months,
the National Bureau of Statistics  said  on April 27.  Quarterly profit at 53 percent of the companies in the
Shanghai index missed estimates, according to data on 225
corporate results compiled by Bloomberg since Feb. 16.  A measure of  property stocks  in the Shanghai gauge rose 1.5
percent, the most among five industry groups. China Vanke, the
biggest developer, advanced 2 percent to 11.25 yuan. Poly Real
Estate Group Co., the second largest, increased 1.6 percent to
11.81 yuan. Chinese  home prices  rose 1 percent in April from the
previous month to 10,098 yuan ($1,640) a square meter, according
to Soufun Holdings Ltd.  Stocks Outlook  ZTE Corp. led gains for telecom companies, surging 5.7
percent to 11.99 yuan. China’s second-biggest maker of mobile-
phone equipment returned to profit in the first three months of
this year because of an asset sale, after posting two straight
quarterly losses.  “The market slumped earlier on the PMI news and overall
corporate earnings weren’t great,” said Tang Yonggang, an
analyst at Hongyuan Securities Co. in Beijing. “After
reflecting on the negative news, investors started looking at
companies that have a better outlook for the second quarter. In
the short term, the index will fluctuate. There’s little room
for more declines, but also not much reason to drive stocks up
either.”  China’s securities regulator plans to raise the minimum
proportion equity funds should have in shares, a move that may
drive investments into the worst-performing major Asian stock
market in the past year.  A stocks fund will be defined as one that holds more than
80 percent of its assets in equities, according to revised
industry rules posted on the China Securities Regulatory
Commission website. That compares with 60 percent now.  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (FXI) , the largest Chinese
 exchange-traded fund  in the U.S., sank 1.5 percent to $37.19 in
 New York , slumping from a six-week high.  Suntech Power Holdings
Co. (STP) , once the world’s largest solar-panel maker, fell the most
in two weeks after reporting a 48 percent sales drop.  -- Editors: Allen Wan, Richard Frost  To contact the reporter on this story:
