Crude oil options volatility fell as
the underlying futures snapped a two-day losing streak after
government report showed jobless claims sank to a five-year low.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
June, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 24.42 percent at 4:10 p.m. on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , down from 25.9 percent yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate for June delivery climbed $2.96 to
settle at $93.99 a barrel on the Nymex, the first advance in
three days. Futures rose after Labor Department figures showed
U.S. jobless claims fell  18,000 to 324,000  in the week ended
April 27, the fewest since January 2008.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
June $90 puts with volume of 4,346 contracts at 4:13 p.m. They

were June $85 puts, which retreated 26 cents to 16 cents a
barrel with 2,531 lots changing hands.  Puts, or bets that crude futures will fall, accounted for
59 percent of electronic trading volume and were the five most-
traded contracts. Bearish bets made up 66 percent of the volume
of 242,482 contracts yesterday.  June $80 puts were the most-active options in the previous
session, with 13,844 lots changing hands as they gained 5 cents
