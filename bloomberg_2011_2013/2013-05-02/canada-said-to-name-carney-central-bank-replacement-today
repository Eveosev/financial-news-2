Finance Minister Jim Flaherty may name
a replacement for Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney as early
as today, according to a person familiar with the plans.  The announcement would be made at about 4 p.m. in Ottawa,
said the person who asked not to be identified because the plans
aren’t public.  Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s cabinet must approve the
choice of governor, which is chosen from a list provided by the
central bank’s board of outside directors. Flaherty has said he
wanted to name a replacement in April and told reporters earlier
this week that the process is drawing to a close.  Dan Miles, a spokesman for Flaherty, said today he had
nothing new to report on the process. Bank of Canada spokesman
Jeremy Harrison said he had no comment on the matter.  Carney gave a lecture in  Edmonton , Alberta late yesterday
and then boarded an overnight flight to Toronto before taking a
connecting flight to Ottawa at about 7 a.m., instead of staying
in Toronto where he is scheduled to participate in a panel
discussion tomorrow.  Economists in a Bloomberg survey after Carney announced his
departure named Senior Deputy Governor Tiff Macklem as the most
likely replacement. The second-most likely candidate is Export
Development Canada Chief Executive Officer Stephen Poloz,
JPMorgan Chase & Co. said in a March 19 report. The Globe and
Mail newspaper said Stanford University finance professor
Darrell Duffie is also a candidate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
