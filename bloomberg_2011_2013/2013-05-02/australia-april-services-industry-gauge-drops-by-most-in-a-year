A gauge of Australia’s services
industry dropped in April by the most in a year as sales, new
orders and employment declined amid weakening domestic demand.  The performance of services  index  fell to 44.1 from 49.6 in
March, the Australian Industry Group and  Commonwealth Bank of
Australia (CBA)  said in Sydney today. The 5.5 point drop was the
biggest since April 2012 and the gauge hasn’t been above 50, the
dividing line between expansion and contraction, since January
last year.  Traders are pricing in a better than 50 percent chance
Reserve Bank of Australia Governor  Glenn Stevens  will lower the
benchmark interest rate to a record 2.75 percent next week after
six reductions -- totaling 1.75 percentage points -- from
November 2011 to December 2012. The government will deliver its
budget on May 14 that is likely to contain measures to plug an
erosion of  tax revenue  that reflects the nation’s weaker
economy.  “The result highlights the low levels of business
confidence, the impact of actual cuts in government spending and
fears of further spending cuts in the coming federal budget,”
Innes Willox, AIG’s chief executive officer, said in a
statement. “In the face of general weakness across large
sections of the domestic economy, now is not the time to be
cutting back on aggregate spending and raising taxes.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
