     May 3 (Bloomberg) -- LinkedIn Corp., the biggest online
professional-networking service, fell the most in almost two
years after forecasting sales that trailed analysts’ estimates,
raising concern that mobile advertising will be slow to kick in.  LinkedIn tumbled 13 percent to $175.59 at the close in  New
York , the biggest decline since Aug. 8, 2011. That sliced its
year-to-date gain to 53 percent.  Revenue in the current period will be $342 million to $347
million, LinkedIn said yesterday in a statement. That missed the
$359.7 million average analyst projection, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. While the company revamped its smartphone
site and announced plans to spend $90 million on mobile
newsreader Pulse, ad revenue on wireless devices may not be
rising fast enough to keep up with traffic growth, said Aaron Kessler, an analyst at Raymond James & Associates Inc.  “It could be the desktop-to-mobile shift, and they don’t
have as much advertising on mobile,” said Kessler, who has the
equivalent of a hold rating on the stock and is based in  San
Francisco . LinkedIn’s ad business came in weaker than projected,
Kessler said.  Before the announcement, LinkedIn’s stock had more than
quadrupled since the company’s initial public offering almost
two years ago. Even after today’s decline, it has a price-to-earnings ratio of about 502. Though less expensive than  Facebook
Inc. (FB) , which trades for more than 1,400 times earnings, the ratio
is many times higher than Google Inc. or Yahoo! Inc., which are
valued at less than 26 times earnings.  Mobile’s Ascent  LinkedIn’s results come a day after Facebook, the biggest
social-networking site, reported revenue that beat analysts’
predictions, with its mobile business making up about 30 percent
of ad sales. LinkedIn and Facebook, like many popular Web
applications, are testing ways to make money from mobile ads.  LinkedIn, based in  Mountain View ,  California , didn’t break
out mobile revenue in its release. In the conference call
following the announcement, Chief Executive Officer  Jeff Weiner 
said that 30 percent of customers visited through the mobile
apps in the first quarter, up from 19 percent a year earlier.  Total sales in the first quarter climbed 72 percent to
$324.7 million from $188.5 million a year earlier. Analysts on
average had  estimated  $318.2 million. Net income more than
quadrupled to $22.6 million, or 20 cents a share, from $5
million, or 4 cents, a year ago.  Annual Sales  The full-year sales forecast also trailed estimates. The
company said 2013 revenue will be $1.43 billion to $1.46
billion, compared with the average analyst estimate of $1.5
billion, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  LinkedIn’s biggest  revenue  generator is still its talent-solutions product, aimed at helping recruiters fill jobs. Sales
in that unit jumped 80 percent to $184.3 million. Ad revenue
increased 56 percent to $74.8 million, while premium-subscription sales rose 73 percent to $65.6 million.  Membership increased 7.9 percent from the fourth quarter to
218 million. That number has about doubled since the IPO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
