An OfficeMax Inc. shareholder sued to
block a proposed $1.17 billion takeover by  Office Depot Inc. (ODP) ,
calling the deal “grossly inadequate.”  The acquisition, announced by the companies on Feb. 20,
would combine the second- and third-biggest U.S. office-supply
businesses behind market leader  Staples Inc. (SPLS)  Stockholders of
Naperville, Illinois-based OfficeMax would get 2.69 shares in
Office Depot for each one of their shares.  “OfficeMax, if properly exposed to the market for
corporate control, would bring a price materially in excess of
the amount offered in the proposed transaction,” the OfficeMax
shareholder, Eric Hollander, said in a complaint filed today in
federal court in  Chicago .  Hollander is seeking to proceed on behalf of all OfficeMax
shareholders affected by the merger plan. He’s asking for an
order blocking consummation of the deal unless and until
OfficeMax gets an agreement “providing the best available terms
for shareholders.”  Also named as defendants are OfficeMax Chairman Rakesh Gangwal, Chief Executive Officer Ravichandra K. Saligram, six
other board members and Boca Raton, Florida-based Office Depot.  Hollander accused the individual defendants of breaching
their fiduciary duty to OfficeMax stockholders and Office Depot
of aiding and abetting that breach. He is seeking a court order
compelling the individual defendants to account for all damages
sustained by the investor class.  Nicole Miller, a spokeswoman for OfficeMax, had no
immediate comment on the lawsuit. Brian Levine, a spokesman for
Office Depot, didn’t immediately reply to an e-mail request for
comment after regular business hours.  The case is Hollander v.  OfficeMax Inc. (OMX) , 13-cv-03330, U.S.
District Court, Northern District of  Illinois  (Chicago).  To contact the reporter on this story:
