The pound stayed higher against the
euro and the dollar after a report showed U.K. construction
shrank less than economists predicted last month.  Sterling gained 0.1 percent to 84.62 pence against the euro
at 9:34 a.m. London time, and was also 0.1 percent firmer
against its U.S. counterpart, at $1.5565.  To contact the reporter on this story:
