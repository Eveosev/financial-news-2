Australia  is expected to affirm plans
to buy as many as 100  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT)  F-35 fighter jets
when it releases its Defense White Paper tomorrow, Reuters said,
citing defense sources and analysts it didn’t identify.  The paper will call for the purchase of 12 Boeing Co. EA-
18G Growler electronic warfare planes as a stopgap for the F-
35’s, which have been hampered by cost overruns and delays,
Reuters reported.  Australia is expected to commit to building a fourth
advanced air warfare destroyer, partly built by BAE Systems Plc
and Spain’s Navantia SA, as well as advance with plans for 12
attack submarines, Reuters said, citing the defense sources.  To contact the reporter on this story:
