It could be a big day in the debate over too-big-to-jail. Denis McInerney, the head of the fraud section for the Justice Department's criminal division, is scheduled to make an appearance Friday to discuss the agency's oft-criticized practice of settling major corporate-crime cases without prosecuting the companies. He'll be speaking at a conference in Washington sponsored by the trade publication  Corporate Crime Reporter . There should be some fireworks, too. One of his fellow panelists will be University of Michigan law professor  David Uhlmann , a former chief of the Justice Department's environmental-crimes section, who has been an outspoken critic of the government's increasing reliance on deferred-prosecution and non-prosecution agreements. Why is it, for example, that the Justice Department's antitrust division and environmental-crimes unit tend to demand guilty pleas from corporate defendants, but large banks are almost always allowed to settle investigations without them? "We're hoping to kick off a national conversation about the double standard in our criminal-justice system -- one for corporations and one for individuals," said Russell Mokhiber, the editor of Corporate Crime Reporter. There surely needs to be one. (Jonathan Weil is a Bloomberg View columnist.)
