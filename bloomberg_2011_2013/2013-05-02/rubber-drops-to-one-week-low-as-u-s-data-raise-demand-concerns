Rubber declined to the lowest level in
more than a week as  Japan ’s currency advanced, cutting the
appeal of the yen-denominated futures, and reports showed a
slower pace of growth in U.S. manufacturing and payrolls.  The contract for October delivery lost as much as 3.4
percent to 250.8 yen a kilogram ($2,578 a metric ton), the
lowest most-active price since April 24. Futures traded at 253.7
yen on the  Tokyo  Commodity Exchange at 10:54 a.m., extending
this year’s losses to 16 percent.  The yen climbed to 97.09 per dollar toward a two-week high,
after the  Institute for Supply Management ’s factory  index 
yesterday showed manufacturing in the U.S. expanded in April at
the slowest pace in four months. U.S. companies added 119,000
jobs last month, the least since September, according to figures
from ADP Research Institute.  “Data from the U.S. raised demand concerns,” Takaki Shigemoto, an analyst at research company JSC Corp. in Tokyo,
said by phone.  U.S. light-vehicle sales  climbed 8.5 percent to 1.29
million in April, according to researcher Autodata Corp,
trailing the average estimate of nine analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg for an 11 percent increase to 1.31 million.  Rubber for September delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange lost 1.8 percent to 18,745  yuan  ($3,045) a ton.  Thai rubber free-on-board gained for a seventh session on
April 30, rising 1.5 percent to 85.80 baht ($2.92) a kilogram,
according to the Rubber Research Institute of  Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
