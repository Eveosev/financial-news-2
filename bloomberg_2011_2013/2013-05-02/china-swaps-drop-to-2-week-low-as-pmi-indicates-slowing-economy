China’s benchmark  interest-rate swaps 
fell to the lowest level in more than two month as manufacturing
data indicated growth in the world’s second-largest economy is
slowing further.  The final April reading of 50.4 for China’s Purchasing
Managers’ Index released today by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics compares with 51.6 for March and a preliminary level
of 50.5 on April 23. A figure above 50 indicates expansion.
Local markets resumed trading today after a three-day holiday.  “The market is dominated by concerns about a slowdown in
growth,” said  Frances Cheung , a strategist at Credit Agricole
CIB in  Hong Kong . “The latest PMI number added to that concern,
and rates are generally soft. In the near term, there seems to
be no trigger for rates to go higher.”  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, declined seven
basis points, or 0.07 percentage points, from April 26 to 3.19
percent in Shanghai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s the lowest level since Feb. 22.  China’s gross domestic product increased 7.7 percent in the
first quarter, less than analysts’ forecasts and below the 7.9
percent pace in the final three months of 2012. Growth in
industrial companies’ profits slowed in March, an April 27
report showed.  The People’s Bank of China sold 30 billion  yuan  ($4.9
billion) of 28-day  repurchase agreements  at a yield of 2.75
percent today, according to a central bank statement posted on
the Chinese government bond clearing house’s website.  The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, fell 60 basis points from April 26 to 2.95
percent in Shanghai, according to a weighted average compiled by
the National Interbank Funding Center.  The yield on 3.52 percent government bonds due February
2023 fell two basis points from April 26 to 3.41 percent,
according to data from the Interbank Funding Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
