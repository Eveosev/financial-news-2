Beyonce, a dinosaur parade and a Catalan tasting menu are among Muse’s arts and leisure recommendations for  London  this Bank Holiday weekend.  STAGE  The story of a boy with Asperger’s syndrome snagged seven Oliviers last weekend. You can still see “The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time” (a National Theatre production) in the West End. Luke Treadaway -- who beat Rupert Everett and James McAvoy to the best-actor trophy -- plays the teenager probing a strange canine death. Staged in the round at the Apollo by Marianne Elliott (another Olivier winner):  http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk  or +44-20-7452-3000.  Ending soon (May 11) at the Royal Court is “The Low Road,” Bruce Norris’s freshly penned critique of capitalism, where a banker extols the virtues of greed in a World Economic Forum panel:  http://www.royalcourttheatre.com , +44-20-7565-5000.  DINING  Mestizo celebrates  Mexico ’s May 5, 1862 victory in the Battle of Puebla with a special Sunday brunch. The menu includes three kinds of pozole stew: red, green and white. There may be better cities than London for Mexican food, yet Mestizo is a very sure bet. Information:  http://london.mestizomx.com/events  or +44-20-7387-4064.  The Ledbury ranked 13th in this week’s World’s 50 Best Restaurants awards. This Notting Hill establishment is a favorite of visiting chefs, and for good reason. You’d be lucky to get a better meal in London, and prices are reasonable for such high-quality cooking. It’s essential to book early. Information:  http://www.theledbury.com  or +44-20-7792-9090.  VISUAL ARTS  Call it mail-order art: Starting in the summer of 1945, Alexander Calder posted a series of small-scale, collapsible works to Paris for a gallery show, and asked a certain Jean-Paul Sartre to write the catalog essay.  Many of those works are now handsomely displayed at Pace London, looking as fresh as if they were made yesterday. The upstairs paintings, on the other hand, look too much like Miro’s. Roughly a quarter of the show is for sale.  “Calder After the War” ends June 7 at Pace London, 6 Burlington Gardens, W1S 3ET:  http://www.pacegallery.com  or +44-20-3206-7613.  MUSIC  Good luck finding tickets to Beyonce’s run of shows: the 20,000-seat O2 has sold out for all six nights. Many tickets can be found online, with prices varying from 25 pounds to 400 pounds. Expect a slew of pop hits, costume changes galore and more fireworks than last year’s Jubilee celebrations.  The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour, through Sunday at O2, Peninsula Square, SE10 0DX. Information:  http://www.theo2.co.uk ,  http://www.beyonce.com  and +44-20-8463-2000.  The I’ll Be Your Mirror Festival at Alexandra Palace on Saturday has a lineup including indie rock acts such as the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Jon Spencer. Alexandra Palace Way, N22 7AY. Information: +44-20-8365-2121 or  http://www.alexandrapalace.com .  OTHER LONDON OUTINGS  If you can’t fly out to Catalonia to try out the world’s best restaurant El Celler de Can Roca, there is an alternative.  Some of its suppliers, from Barcelona’s historic Boqueria market, are bringing their produce to the Streets of Spain festival on the South Bank this weekend. There’s also a pop-up five-course tasting menu you can sample. It’s all part of the  Real Food Festival . Information:  http://bit.ly/12Zqtzm  or  http://www.realfoodfestival.co.uk .  Tyrannosaurus Rex makes a comeback this Bank Holiday weekend: In  “Walking with Dinosaurs”  -- adapted from the BBC TV series -- life-sized prehistoric creatures trundle across Wembley Arena in a battle for survival. Through May 6. Information:  http://www.wembleyarena.co.uk .  (Farah Nayeri writes for Muse, the arts and leisure section of Bloomberg News. The opinions expressed are her own.)
