Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , Germany’s biggest
lender, hired three people for its U.S. investment-grade debt
group, including an analyst and two traders.  Anthony McCutcheon, an analyst covering technology, media
and telecommunications companies, will be joining from HSBC
Holdings Plc, according to  Renee Calabro , a spokeswoman for the
bank in New York. Michael Gorun, who trades bonds of financial
companies, will come from Barclays Plc, and Yannis Giovanidis,
an index-options trader, joined from UBS AG on April 22, Calabro
said in a telephone interview.  Deutsche Bank is the fifth most-active underwriter of
investment-grade debt in the U.S. this year, from seventh place
last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The notes
have returned 2 percent this year, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data, as the  Federal Reserve  holds benchmark
borrowing costs at about zero for a fifth year, spurring
investors to buy riskier assets.  Issuance from the most creditworthy to the riskiest
borrowers has surged to $1.43 trillion this year, topping last
year’s $1.41 trillion tally in the same period, Bloomberg data
show.  Apple Inc. (APPL) , the largest U.S. maker of smartphones, sold
$17 billion of bonds on April 30 in the biggest U.S. corporate
offering on record. Deutsche Bank was one of the underwriters on
that sale along with Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
