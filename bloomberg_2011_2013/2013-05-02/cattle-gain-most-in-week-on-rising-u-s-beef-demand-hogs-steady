Cattle futures headed for the biggest
gain in a week on signs of climbing demand for U.S. beef. Hogs
were little changed.  Meatpackers processed 369,000 cattle in the first three
days of this week, up 0.5 percent from a week earlier and 0.8
percent more than the same period in 2012, government data show.
Wholesale  beef  surged 1.6 percent yesterday to $1.9949, the
highest since at least January 2004, U.S. Department of
Agriculture data show.  “When you’ve got better meat prices, cash can follow that,
and those fundamentals can help the futures rally too,” Paul Beere, a grain and livestock adviser at Prime Agricultural
Consultants in Brookfield,  Wisconsin , said in a telephone
interview. “It’s the temperatures warming up, and you’re
starting to see people grill out.”  Cattle futures for June delivery rose 0.8 percent to $1.235
a pound at 9:39 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. A close
at that level would be the biggest increase for the most-active
contract since April 24.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement climbed 0.4
percent to $1.493 a pound.  Hog futures for June settlement fell 0.1 percent to 92.875
cents a pound. Prices gained 8.4 percent this year through
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
