Andritz AG (ANDR) , the second-biggest maker
of hydropower turbines, lost a fifth of its value after cost
overruns at a Brazilian pulp mill caused a profit warning.  Andritz fell as much as  24 percent , the most ever, and was
down 18 percent, or 9.11 euros, at 40.37 euros by 10:02 a.m. in
the Austrian capital. More than eight times as many shares
changed hands than the average trading volume over the last 90
days. The Graz, Austria-based company’s market value fell by
almost 1 billion euros ($1.32 billion) to 4.2 billion euros.  Cost overruns at a Brazilian pulp mill being built by
Andritz caused the company to report “significantly” lower
profit than expected. First quarter net income fell by 92
percent to 4.1 million euros, the company reported after markets
closed on April 30. Order intake dropped 5.4 percent to 1.29
billion euros.  “This could raise concerns over Andritz’s capacity to win
new large-scale order awards given the potential reputational
damage and its more conservative bidding approach going
forward,” wrote Citigroup analyst Alex Atienza, who is
“neutral” on Andritz shares, in a research note.  Goldman Sachs maintained its “conviction buy”
recommendation on Andritz shares while lowering its six-month
price target to 66 euros, the bank wrote today in a research
note. “Andritz is strongly positioned to benefit from long-term
growth trends,” Goldman said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
