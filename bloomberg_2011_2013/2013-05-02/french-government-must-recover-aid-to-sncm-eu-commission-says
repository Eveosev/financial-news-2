The French government must retrieve
public funds granted to Societe Nationale Corse-Mediterranee, a
ferry company operating in the Mediterranean, the European
Commission said in an e-mailed statement today.  Grants given to the company since July 2007 to operate
ferry routes during peak periods breach European Union state aid
rules, the commission said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
