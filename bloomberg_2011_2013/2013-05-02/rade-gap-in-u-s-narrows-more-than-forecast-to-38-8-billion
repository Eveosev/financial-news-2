The U.S. trade  deficit  narrowed more
than forecast in March to its second-lowest level in three years
as imports of consumer goods and business equipment declined.  The gap shrank 11 percent to $38.8 billion from a revised
$43.6 billion in February, the Commerce Department reported
today in Washington. The median  forecast  in a Bloomberg survey
of 67 economists called for a $42.3 billion deficit. Imports
dropped by the most since February 2009 as the U.S. shortfall
with  China  fell to a three-year low.  Boosting shipments of American-made goods may prove
difficult as companies such as Dow Chemical Co. contend with
slower growth in parts of Asia and struggling economies in
Europe. At the same time, U.S. demand for imports has waned as
businesses stockpile less and households cut back on purchases.  “We’re going to get an upward boost to first-quarter
growth from trade,” said Brian Jones, senior U.S. economist at
Societe Generale in New York. Still, “imports being down means
weaker domestic demand.”  Another report showed  first-time claims  for jobless
benefits unexpectedly declined last week to the lowest level in
more than five years. Applications for unemployment insurance
payments fell by 18,000 to 324,000 in the week ended April 27,
the fewest since January 2008, the Labor Department said.
Economists forecast 345,000 claims, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  Stocks Climb  Stocks rose, with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
rebounding from the biggest drop in two weeks, after the jobless
claims figures and as the European Central Bank cut its key
interest rate to a record low. The S&P 500 advanced 0.9 percent
to 1,596.28 at 11:45 a.m. in New York.  Bloomberg survey estimates ranged from deficits of $38.5
billion to $45 billion. The Commerce Department revised the
February shortfall from an initially reported $43 billion.  Imports decreased 2.8 percent, the most since February
2009, to $223.1 billion in March from $229.6 billion in the
prior month. Purchases of foreign-made capital equipment and
consumer goods dropped.  The import figures included 215.7 million barrels of crude
oil compared with 204.8 million the prior month. Accounting for
three extra days in March than in February, crude oil imports
averaged about 7 million barrels a day, the lowest since March
1996.  Excluding petroleum, the trade shortfall narrowed to $17.7
billion in March from $22.2 billion.  Fewer Exports  Exports decreased 0.9 percent to $184.3 billion, reflecting
fewer overseas sales of foods, motor vehicles, capital equipment
and consumer goods.  Trade subtracted 0.5 percentage point from economic growth
in the first quarter, the most since the last three months of
2011, the Commerce Department reported on April 26. GDP rose at
a 2.5 percent annualized rate from January through March after
0.4 percent gain.  The economy is projected to cool to a 1.5 percent pace in
the current quarter and then accelerate in the last half of
2013, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists from April 5
to April 9.  Overseas Economies  Dow Chemical has noted slower economies in  Europe  and some
Asian economies. Chinese demand for chemicals and materials was
down 3 percent in the first quarter from a year ago, Dow
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Andrew Liveris said.  “We are seeing decent improvements in the United States as
well as in southeast Asia and  Brazil ,” Liveris said on an April
25 earnings call. “But China has not seen strong market
traction coming out of the Lunar New Year, and conditions in
Europe remain very weak.”  “Consumption is down. They have pushed down government
spending on all wasteful areas, including frivolous things like
banquets. So I would tell you China is soft, but starting to
show trend-positive,” he said. “Importantly, conditions do
seem to be stabilizing in the global macro environment, which is
a positive sign.”  For  Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC) , based in Findlay,  Ohio , a
slowdown in exports early in the year was due in part to muted
demand in Europe.  “There were a number of factors that tended to cause a bit
of a weakness in the export market,” Mike Palmer, senior vice
president of supply, distribution and planning, said on an April
30 earnings call. “Certainly, there was Europe.”  Today’s report showed the trade gap with China narrowed to
$17.9 billion from $23.4 billion. The deficit with  Canada 
dropped to $2.3 billion from $2.5 billion and with  Mexico 
widened to $5.3 billion in March from $4.3 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
