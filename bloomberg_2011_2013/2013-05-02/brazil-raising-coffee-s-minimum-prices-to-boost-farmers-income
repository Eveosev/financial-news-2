Brazil , the world’s biggest coffee
producer and exporter, is raising the minimum domestic prices
for the commodity to help increase income for farmers after
international prices slumped.  Agriculture Minister Antonio Andrade plans to announce the
new benchmarks for arabica and robusta coffee in a news
conference in Brasilia scheduled for 3 p.m. local time today,
according to an e-mailed statement. The minimum price for the
mild-tasting arabica variety is currently 261 reais ($130) per
60-kilogram (132-pound) bag and the one for robusta coffee is
156 reais per bag.  Arabica coffee futures in  New York  have declined 23 percent
in the past year after Brazil reaped a record crop last year and
is set to almost match the amount this year. The minimum prices
are the benchmark for government purchases of coffee from
producers.  Coffee for July delivery jumped as much as 4.2 percent
today after the ministry said it would announce a new minimum
price. It rose 3.8 percent to $1.398 per pound at 12:30 p.m. on
ICE Futures U.S. in New York.  Joao Rabelo, the  Finance Ministry ’s undersecretary for
agricultural policy, said in an April 18 interview that the
government was studying the increase of the minimum price to
help coffee growers and planning an announcement within weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
