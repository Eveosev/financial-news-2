GT Advanced Technologies Inc. (GTAT) , a U.S.
supplier of manufacturing equipment for solar and energy-
efficient lighting products, fell the most in two weeks after
saying some customers may not honor purchase agreements.  GT Advanced retreated 4.9 percent to $3.67 at the close in
 New York , the most since April 15.  The company reported a backlog of $851 million, after
eliminating $356 million in orders for sapphire furnaces that it
determined “are unlikely to convert to sales in the foreseeable
future,” Nashua, New Hampshire-based GT Advanced said in a
statement yesterday after the close of regular trading.  While the customers haven’t canceled these orders and
remain “contractually obligated,” GT Advanced said the sales
are “at risk.” Its backlog is now about $352 million for
sapphire furnaces, which are used to make light-emitting diodes.  “Leaving them in reported backlog, in the company’s view,
is no longer a good indicator of the company’s revenue
potential,” according to the statement.  “The hefty cut in backlog is a concern,”  Pavel Molchanov ,
an analyst at Raymond James & Associates Inc. in Houston, wrote
in a note to investors today. “This puts backlog below the $1
billion level, which management has previously targeted.”  The company also has backlogged orders for $491 million of
systems that make polysilicon, the main raw ingredient in solar
cells, and $8 million for photovoltaic production equipment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
