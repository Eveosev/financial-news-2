RSA Insurance Group Plc (RSA) , the U.K.’s
biggest non-life insurer by market value, said first-quarter
revenue rose about 5 percent driven by its Canadian and emerging
markets businesses.  Net written premiums, a measure of sales, increased to 2.3
billion pounds ($3.6 billion) in the three months to March 31,
compared with 2.2 billion pounds a year earlier, the London-
based company said in a statement today. Sales in Canada gained
18 percent, while emerging markets climbed 16 percent, it said.  “We are confident in delivering good premium growth on a
constant exchange rate basis, ” Chief Executive Officer Simon Lee said in the statement. “We continue to expect the business
to grow both organically and through selective bolt-on
acquisitions.”  RSA, which insures cars, homes and ships in the U.K.,
Scandinavia and  emerging markets , said its Canadian unit
benefited from its 2012 purchase of L’Union Canadienne and its
emerging markets unit was helped by acquisitions in  Argentina 
last year. Premiums from its Scandinavian business were little
changed, while U.K. and Western Europe rose 1 percent.  The company, which had businesses in 50 countries 10 years
ago now operates in 31 countries as it exited some regions. RSA
left the  Czech Republic  in 2012 and completed the sale of its
business in the Dutch Caribbean in April 2013, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
