Coffee futures rose, heading for the
biggest increase in four months, on speculation that supplies
will be limited by government price supports in  Brazil , the
world’s top producer.  Brazil will announce today a guaranteed minimum price at
which the government would buy beans from farmers, after
arabica-coffee futures fell to a 33-month low in March. In the
week ended April 23, money managers and other large speculators
reduced their net-short position, or bets on a drop in prices,
by 32 percent, U.S. government data show.  The Brazil announcement will “just keep supplies from
hammering the market,”  Jack Scoville , a vice president for
Price Futures Group, said in a telephone interview from  Chicago .
“At least for today, we’re getting some relief to the upside.”  Arabica coffee for July delivery rose 3.5 percent to
$1.3935 at 11:32 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York, heading
for the biggest increase for the most-active contract since Jan.
