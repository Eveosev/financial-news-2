Canadian  stocks  rose, erasing an
earlier loss, as commodities prices rebounded and better-than-
estimated earnings from Manulife Financial Corp. boosted
financial shares.  Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. advanced 1.7 percent as
crude rose the most in almost six months. Yamana Gold Inc. added
2.7 percent as gold gained the most in a week. Manulife
Financial, the country’s largest insurer, climbed 3.9 percent
after earnings beat estimates. Canadian National Railway Co. and
Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. increased more than 1.2 percent.
 Catamaran Corp. (CCT) , a pharmacy services provider, slumped 7.2
percent after reporting sales that missed estimates.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  rose 58.35
points, or 0.5 percent, to 12,379.64 at 4 p.m. in Toronto. The
benchmark equity gauge earlier fell as much as 0.4 percent.
Trading volume was 5.8 percent lower than the 30-day average.  “The TSX is going through a period of revaluing where
commodities will trade,” said Kash Pashootan, a  fund manager 
with First Avenue Advisory of Raymond James Ltd. in Ottawa. He
manages about C$125 million ($124 million). “We’ve had a lot of
good news overnight, we’ll see some days where the market
bounces and buyers will step in and buy.”  Oil rose for the first time in three days and metals
rallied as U.S.  jobless claims  unexpectedly dropped last week to
the lowest since January 2008 and the  European Central Bank  cut
 interest rates  to a record low today.  The Federal Reserve yesterday maintained the rate of bond
buying and said it is “prepared to increase or reduce the pace
of its purchases.”  Trade Surplus  Canada posted its first  trade surplus  in a year in March,
breaking the longest string of deficits in at least 25 years as
exporters shipped more energy and mineral products abroad.  The  Bank of Canada  said after the close of regular trading
that Stephen Poloz, the chief executive officer of the nation’s
export-financing agency, will replace  Mark Carney  as head of the
central bank on June 3.  Canadian Natural Resources rose 1.7 percent to C$29.49 as
crude for June delivery gained 3.3 percent to settle at $93.99 a
barrel in  New York , its biggest one-day increase since Nov. 6.  Yamana Gold added 2.7 percent to $11.97, rebounding from a
6.5 percent slide yesterday. Gold futures jumped 1.5 percent to
settle at $1,467.60.  Financial stocks  contributed  most to gains in the S&P/TSX,
rising 0.7 percent as a group.  Manulife Financial gained 3.9 percent to C$15.33. The
company reported earnings of 28 cents a share, ahead of
expectations for 27 cents a share. Sun Life Financial Inc. rose
2.3 percent to $28.97.  Industrials Gain  Industrial shares rallied 0.8 percent. Canadian National
Railway rose 1.2 percent to $98.46 and Canadian Pacific Railway
jumped 2.8 percent to $126.64.  Health care stocks slumped 3.7 percent, dragged lower by
Catamaran. The company, based in Lisle,  Illinois , dropped 7.2
percent to C$53.37, the biggest loss since October 2011. Sales
of $3.22 billion fell short of the $3.53 billion analysts
estimated.  Catamaran maintained its previous 2013 forecast for
adjusted earnings of $1.81 to $1.88 per share and sales of $14.2
billion to $14.6 billion.  Goldcorp Inc. (G) , the biggest gold producer by market value,
lost 0.6 percent to C$28.91 as earnings and output missed
estimates. The company reported adjusted first quarter profit of
31 cents a share, trailing the 38-cent average of 21 analyst
estimates according to a Bloomberg survey. Sales fell to $1.02
billion from $1.21 billion.  The company produced 614,600 ounces of gold in the quarter,
