Israel Chemicals Ltd. (ICL)  advanced the
most in more than a week on bets declines last month after
 Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc.  scrapped a proposed takeover
bid were overdone.  The  shares  gained 1.9 percent, the most since April 23, to
42.99 shekels at 2:24 p.m. in Tel Aviv. They slumped 9.3 percent
last month, making it the second-worst performer on Israel’s
benchmark TA-25 Index. The measure was little changed today.  Potash Corp. on April 25 scrapped the proposed bid after
Israeli workers and politicians opposed what would have been the
second-largest takeover in the  Middle East . Finance Minister
Yair Lapid said last month he would reconsider how resource
developers are taxed and would set up a panel to re-examine what
he called “the state’s rights” in natural resources that are
managed by private companies.  “At current  price levels  the shares present an attractive
entry point,” said Roni Biron, a Tel Aviv-based analyst at  UBS
AG (UBSN) , who has a buy rating on the share. “The uncertainty over a
potential royalties increase is an overhang in the near term,
but the scope for a meaningful hike in royalties is limited.”  Israel Chemicals said in July its Dead Sea Works unit
signed an agreement with the government to raise royalty on
annual potash sales exceeding 1.5 million tons to 10 percent
from 5 percent.  Israel Chemicals’ controlling shareholder Israel Corp.
advanced 0.7 percent to 2,310 shekels. The shares were the worst
performer on the TA-25 last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
