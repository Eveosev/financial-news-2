Genmab A/S (GEN)  rose the most in almost two
months in Copenhagen trading after U.S. regulators granted
“breakthrough therapy” designation to an experimental cancer
drug the Danish company is developing with  Johnson & Johnson. (JNJ)   Genmab surged as much as 10 percent,  the most since  March
8. The stock advanced 9.7 percent to 158.5 kroner as of 11:02
a.m. in the Danish capital.  Genmab’s  daratumumab  is being developed to treat multiple
myeloma, a type of cancer that starts in the plasma cells in
bone marrow. The designation by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, announced late yesterday, may speed up the
market introduction of the treatment to 2015 from 2017, Michael Novod, an analyst with Nordea in Copenhagen, said in a note
today.  Breakthrough therapy is “the strongest possible
designation the FDA can award to highlight an unmet medical need
and potentially speed up development times considerably,” Novod
said. “Furthermore, we expect it to massively increase
awareness about the project.”  The market for multiple myeloma is “set to grow rapidly,”
approaching $9 billion in 2020 amid better diagnosis and
treatment of the disease, Novod said in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
