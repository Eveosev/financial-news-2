German and Finnish two-year government
notes rallied after European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi 
said policy makers had a strong consensus on todayâ€™s interest-
rate cut and had an open mind on negative deposit rates.  Two-year German yields fell three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to minus 0.01 percent at 2:12 p.m. London
time, while the rate on similar-maturity Finnish notes dropped
as much as six basis points to minus 0.006 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
