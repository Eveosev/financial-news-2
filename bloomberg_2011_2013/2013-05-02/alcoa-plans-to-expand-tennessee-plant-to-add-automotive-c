Alcoa Inc. (AA) , the largest U.S. aluminum
producer, will expand a plant in  Tennessee  to meet increasing
demand for the lightweight metal in cars and trucks.  Alcoa will spend $275 million in the next three years at
its rolling mill in Alcoa, Tennessee, the New York-based company
said today in a statement.  Alcoa announced in September 2011 it would spend $300
million to expand automotive-products capacity at its Davenport,
Iowa, facility. Work there is expected to be finished this year,
the company said in today’s statement.  Alcoa permanently closed its smelter in the eponymous
Tennessee city last year as part of curtailments that reduced
smelting capacity by 531,000 metric tons a year. Yesterday, the
company said in the next 15 months it will evaluate making a
further 460,000 tons of reductions.  Automakers this year are on pace to sell the most cars and
light trucks in the U.S. since 2007, with deliveries rising 6.9
percent through April to 4.97 million, according to researcher
Autodata Corp.  General Motors Co. (GM)  is targeting a 15 percent
weight reduction of its vehicles through the 2016 model year,
and Ford Motor Co. has set a goal to take 250 to 750 pounds (113
to 340 kilograms) from each of its models as they are refreshed.  The  auto industry  will consume 4 percent more aluminum this
year as the average North American car adds 14 pounds of the
metal in 2013 compared with last year, according to research by
Lloyd O’Carroll, an analyst at Davenport & Co. in Richmond,
Virginia.  Vehicle manufacturers are working to make lighter cars and
trucks as regulators require automakers to reach an average  fuel
efficiency  for their fleets of 54.5 miles per gallon (23.2
kilometers per liter) by 2025.  To contact the reporters on this story:
