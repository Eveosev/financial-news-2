Hillary Clinton called Tony Bennett “the Henry Kissinger of music.”  The crooner said Clinton was “the greatest ambassador in the whole world.”  The mutual-admiration society convened last night at the  Atlantic Council ’s Distinguished Leadership Awards dinner at the Ritz-Carlton.  They were honored along with  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  Chief Executive and Chairman John Watson, singer Juanes, and Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the secretary general of NATO. The bipartisan Atlantic Council promotes transatlantic partnerships.  Clinton sat next to Kissinger and opposite Bennett for dinner. Among the guests were Alan Greenspan, Israeli Ambassador Michael Oren, and arts patron Adrienne Arsht, the namesake of the Council’s new Latin America Center.  “When I returned to Washington in 2008, all I could talk about was what was happening in Miami,” Arsht said, “and how important it was for us to focus on Latin America, and start being aware of the values in that continent that are so similar to ours.”  After the poached prawns and crusted lamb loin, Bennett and Juanes performed “The Shadow of Your Smile.” The evening ended with the ballroom singing “Happy Birthday to You” to Kissinger, who will turn 90 on May 27.  Tisch’s Lincoln  If you want to be seen as a “national player” in the hotel business, you have to have a property in Washington, said Jonathan Tisch, the co-chairman of  Loews Corp. (L)  He stood in the lobby last night of the Loews Madison Hotel, welcoming guests to a reception celebrating its $21 million redesign and 50th anniversary. The hotel became part of Tisch’s chain earlier this year.  President John F. Kennedy opened it in 1963. Over the years, it was known as the favorite destination of traveling dignitaries.  Tisch said the hotel will now be amenable to “group travelers” and families.  JFK lobster stew was served along with chocolate-covered strawberries. A fabric pattern on a sofa in the Kennedy White House was duplicated for the wallpaper in the guest rooms.  Tisch said he’s an Abraham Lincoln fan, his favorite monument the mammoth memorial to the 16th president, which he never tires of visiting.  Orange Sea  Orange was everywhere at the Dutch Embassy Tuesday night in celebration of King Willem-Alexander’s accession to the throne of the Netherlands.  Ambassador Rudolf Bekink sported an orange bowtie as he stood with his wife, Gabrielle, welcoming arrivals on the orange carpet.  The reception featured traditional Dutch eel, herring and Heineken served inside a tent with orange Chinese lanterns.  Television screens replayed the pageantry of the accession festivities back home.  Among the revelers was Michelle DeMoor, senior director of international policy and government relations for Philips Electronics North America Corp. She wore lavender nail polish from OPI.  “I guess I should have gotten orange,” she said of her recent manicure, while observing a sea of orange scarves, hats and pro-monarch buttons around her.
