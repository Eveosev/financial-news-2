Crop prices gained on concerns that
slow planting progress and worsening crop conditions in the
U.S., the world’s biggest exporter of corn and wheat, will curb
yields and reduce global supplies. Soybeans advanced.  Corn for July delivery advanced as much as 0.2 percent to
$6.48 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and was at $6.475
by 9:56 a.m. in  Singapore . Wheat for July delivery gained 0.2
percent to $7.225 a bushel.  Farmers  sowed  only 5 percent of corn as of April 28,
trailing the five-year average pace of 31 percent, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said April 29. About 33 percent of
winter wheat was in good or excellent  condition , down from 64
percent a year earlier, it said. Wheat yields in southwest
 Kansas  and northwest  Oklahoma  were estimated at 34.1 bushels an
acre yesterday, and crops are about three to four weeks behind
normal growth, a survey of 50 fields showed.  “U.S. crop concerns remain significant,”  Luke Mathews , a
commodity strategist at  Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) , wrote in
a report today. “Attention will quickly return to the overall
dire situation in the U.S. corn belt, as another cold, wet
system is set to stall fieldwork again over the next few days.  Cold temperatures will slow the warm up of soils and
further delay spring field work in the North Plains, while a
significant freeze is possible in parts of the Central and South
Plains, forecaster DTN said in a report yesterday.  Wheat output in Oklahoma, the second-biggest U.S. grower of
winter varieties, may tumble 45 percent this year because of
drought and freeze damage, the Oklahoma Wheat Commission, said
yesterday. Production may drop to 85.5 million bushels from
154.8 million a year earlier, she said.  Soybeans for July delivery advanced as much as 0.4 percent
to $13.7875 a bushel before trading at $13.745.  To contact the reporter on this story:
