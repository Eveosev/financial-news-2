Asian Development Bank President
Takehiko Nakao comments on the yen and  Japan ’s monetary
expansion. He spoke in a press conference at the lender’s annual
meeting in Noida on the outskirts of New Delhi.  “This is in my personal capacity, regarding the Japanese
yen.  “The monetary expansion was needed to get out of deflation.
For 20 years there has been persistent deflation.  “Yen appreciated after European sovereign crisis and
Lehman crisis, so in a way the depreciation of yen can be
explained as an adjustment from the past. So, in a way, Japanese
yen depreciation is a reflection of the global financial
situation.  “It is clearly stated by the G-20 that we don’t use
currency depreciation to enhance our competitiveness. The
exchange rate should be determined by the market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
