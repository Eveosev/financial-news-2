Brazil’s swap rates dropped as the
 European Central Bank  signaled that the region’s economy remains
weak, fueling speculation that the Latin American nation’s
policy makers will limit increases in borrowing costs.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2015 fell four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 8.21 percent at 11:57
a.m. in  Sao Paulo . The real depreciated 0.5 percent to 2.0112
per  U.S. dollar .  “The whole world is in a problematic economic situation,”
Paulo Gala, a strategist at Fator Corretora in Sao Paulo, said
in a telephone interview. “The central bank may not have much
room to raise rates.”  Swap rates declined as ECB President  Mario Draghi  said
today the monetary authority will continue to lend banks as much
money as they need at least until mid-2014. Policy makers
lowered the target lending rate to a record low 0.5 percent.  Brazil’s central bank board voted 6 to 2 on April 17 to
raise its  benchmark  by 25 basis points to 7.50 percent from a
record low 7.25 percent and said in its statement accompanying
the decision that “external uncertainties” required “that
monetary policy be managed with caution.”  Consumer prices  rose at an annual rate of 6.59 percent in
March, exceeding the 6.50 percent upper limit of the central
bank’s preferred range for the first time since November 2011.
The target is 4.50 percent, plus or minus 2 percentage points.  President  Dilma Rousseff  said in a national television and
radio address on May 1 that “Brazil will never abandon fight to
control inflation.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
