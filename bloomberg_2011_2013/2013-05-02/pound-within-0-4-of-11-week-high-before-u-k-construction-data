The pound rose against the euro after
an industry report showed U.K.  construction  improved last month
and as European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said the
region’s policy makers are open to negative  interest rates .  Sterling fell for the first time in seven days versus the
dollar. The U.K. currency has risen 2.7 percent in the past
month against the greenback after slipping 6.5 percent in the
first quarter and climbed yesterday as data showed  manufacturing 
shrank in April by less than economists predicted. U.K.
government bonds rose, pushing 10-year yields to the lowest
since September.  “At the moment, the U.K. economy is surprising more
downbeat expectations” and allowing the pound to rally, said
 Lee Hardman , a currency strategist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi
UFJ Ltd. in  London . The past month’s advance against the dollar
“is a corrective rebound phase after a sharp decline in the
first quarter.”  The pound gained 0.6 percent to 84.18 pence per euro at
4:38 p.m. London time after appreciating to 84.08 pence. It
reached 83.98 pence on April 26, the strongest level since Jan.
24. Sterling dropped 0.3 percent to $1.5505. It climbed to
$1.5606 yesterday, the highest since Feb. 13.  An index of building-industry output increased to 49.4 from
47.2 in March, Markit and the  Chartered Institute of Purchasing
and Supply  said today. While that was below the 50 level that
indicates contraction, it was more than the median forecast of
48 in a Bloomberg News  survey  of nine analysts.  The gauge hasn’t been 50 or above since October.  ECB ‘Ready’  Europe ’s common currency fell against all but one of its 16
major peers, slipping 1 percent to $1.3055, after the ECB cut
its  key rate  to a record-low 0.50 percent.  “We will look at all the incoming data and stand ready to
act if needed,” Draghi said at a press conference in
Bratislava, the Slovakian capital. Asked if further action could
include charging banks to park excess cash with the ECB
overnight, he said: “We will look at this with an open mind.”  The pound has gained 2.5 percent in the past month, the
best performer among 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro rose 1.6
percent, while the dollar dropped 0.4 percent.  The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee meets next
on May 8-9. Governor  Mervyn King  has wanted to expand the U.K.
central bank’s 375 billion-pound asset-purchase  target  for three
consecutive months and has been outvoted by a majority on the
nine-member policy committee, minutes of their meetings show.  Not Enough  “The data that we’ve been seeing hasn’t been as bad as
expected,” said Jane Foley, senior foreign-exchange strategist
at Rabobank International in London. Still “the data has just
not been good enough for the market to see good reasons for
additional momentum.”  The 10-year gilt yield fell three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 1.62 percent after reaching 1.61 percent,
the least since Sept. 3. The 1.75 percent bond maturing in
September 2022 rose 0.29, or 2.90 pounds per 1,000-pound face
amount, to 101.14.  Gilts have returned 2.1 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
