Generac Holdings Inc. (GNRC) ’s $1.15 billion
term loan supporting a dividend and refinancing is being led by
JPMorgan Chase & Co., which will host a lender meeting tomorrow,
according to a person with knowledge of the transaction who
asked not to be identified because the information is private.  The generator maker is paying a dividend of as much as $5 a
share, the company said today in a regulatory filing. The new
financing will include a $150 million asset-based revolving
 credit line  that will be undrawn at closing, Generac said.  Generac, based in Waukesha,  Wisconsin , will incur about
$335 million in debt from the payout, according to the filing.
It has about $801 million outstanding under a  term loan  due in
May 2018, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The debt,
obtained last year, began paying interest at 5 percentage points
more than the London interbank offered rate with a 1.25 percent
minimum on the lending benchmark, the data show.  In a revolving line of credit, money may be borrowed again
once it’s repaid; in a term loan it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
