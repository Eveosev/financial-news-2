Sheikh Salman bin Ibrahim Al Khalifa
of Bahrain was elected president of the Asian Football
Confederation and vowed to reform the governing body after
several officials were banned.  Sheikh Salman got 33 of the 45 votes cast in the vote today
in  Kuala Lumpur  and his term will last until the next AFC
Congress in two years, according to a statement on the governing
body’s website. The Bahraini will also join the executive
committee of FIFA, soccer’s world governing body.  “We should look carefully at our challenges such as match-
fixing, which is a disease,” Sheikh Salman said. “We have zero
tolerance to match-fixing and corruption practices and we need
to make full use of all our tools to fight this phenomenon. This
problem should not only be tackled from the football side only,
but also we need good policing and support from the
governments.”  The election follows the resignation of former AFC
President Mohamed Bin Hammam in December. Bin Hammam will never
work in soccer again, FIFA said, after an ethics investigation
found the Qatari violated its ethics code with alleged conflicts
of interest during his time as AFC president and as a member of
the FIFA executive committee in 2008-11. Bin Hammam denied
wrongdoing.  Earlier this week, FIFA suspended executive committee
member Vernon Manilal Fernando of  Sri Lanka  for eight years for
an unspecified breach of its ethics code.  To contact the reporter on this story:
