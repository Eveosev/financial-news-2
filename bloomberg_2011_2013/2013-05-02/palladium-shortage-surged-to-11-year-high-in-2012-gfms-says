Palladium’s deficit rose to the
biggest in 11 years in 2012 as  strike action  in South African
mines curbed supply and demand expanded, Thomson Reuters GFMS
said. Platinum slipped into a deficit for the first time since
2004.  Palladium supply fell 4 percent to 8.19 million ounces as
usage expanded 5 percent to 9.32 million ounces, the highest on
record, the London-based researcher said today in a report.
Excluding sales from Russian state stocks and investor selling,
demand outstripped supply by 1.12 million ounces, the biggest
gap since the 1.3 million-ounce shortfall in 2001, GFMS said.  Both metals are mostly used in vehicle pollution-control
devices and jewelry, with palladium favored mainly for gasoline-burning engines in the U.S. and  Asia  and platinum for diesels in
 Europe . This year “may mark the end” to sales from Russian
government inventories, a state secret, after deliveries halved
last year, GFMS predicted. The global economy will grow 3.3
percent in 2013, from 3.2 percent in 2012, according to the
 International Monetary Fund .  “Constrained supply should maintain positive investor
sentiment and allow prices to lift marginally,” William
Tankard, a research director at GFMS said in a telephone
interview yesterday.  Palladium for immediate delivery fell 1.8 percent this year
to $691.07 an ounce by 2:28 p.m. in  London  today. It will trade
between $660 and $800 by the end of the year and will average
$725 an ounce, GFMS said. Platinum, down 3.1 percent to
$1,491.60 an ounce this year, will trade between $1,375 and
$1,750 by December and average $1,600, the report showed.  Russian Stockpiles  Sales from Russian palladium stockpiles may halve again
this year to 200,000 ounces before ceasing from 2014, Tankard
said. Deliveries fell to 400,000 ounces in 2012, from 800,000
ounces a year earlier, according to GFMS.  Palladium will see another “sizable deficit” in 2013 of
between 800,000 and 900,000 ounces, Tankard said. Last year’s
shortage widened from 279,000 ounces in 2011 on supply decline
driven by a 10 percent drop in  South Africa  and as Russian
output fell 3 percent.  Production will rise “only marginally” this year as South
African output remains “stifled,” while auto companies will
drive demand increase, according to GFMS. Autocatalyst demand
surged 9 percent last year as jewelry usage shrank 4 percent.  Platinum demand outpaced supply by 83,000 ounces in 2012,
from a 803,000-ounce surplus a year earlier. Supply slumped 10
percent to 7.1 million ounces on output disruptions in top
producer South Africa, GFMS said. Refined output fell 12 percent
to the lowest since 2001, according to the researcher.  Scrap Recycling  The market will post a surplus of about 100,000 ounces this
year, Tankard said. Global output will increase by 2 percent as
autocatalyst scrap recycling exceeds 1 million ounces for the
first time, while South African output remains restrained, GFMS
said.  Platinum consumption rose 1 percent to 7.19 million ounces
last year as jewelry demand expanded 9 percent, GFMS said. The
metal’s use in vehicles fell 4 percent affected by “weakness”
in the European automotive industry and rising substitution by
cheaper palladium, the researcher said. Investors bought 237,000
ounces, compared with 145,000 ounces in 2011.  Bloomberg competes with  Thomson Reuters  in selling
