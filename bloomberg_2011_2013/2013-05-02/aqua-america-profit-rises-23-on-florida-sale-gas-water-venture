Aqua America Inc. (WTR) , the second-biggest
water utility in the U.S. by market value, said profit climbed
almost 23 percent in the first quarter, helped by the disposal
of two-thirds of the company’s operations in Florida.  The water company also said in a statement that revenue for
the quarter was $180 million compared with $164 million a year
earlier, with $59 million spent on infrastructure upgrades in
the period, including pipe replacements.  The Aqua-PVR Water Services venture to supply raw water to
natural gas producers in the Marcellus Shale in  Pennsylvania  can
now provide water to gas drilling sites along 56 miles of
pipeline and has pumped 128 million gallons of water to the gas
producers, Aqua America said in yesterday’s statement.  The shares of Aqua America, which has completed four
acquisitions in 2013, have climbed 24 percent this year compared
with a 12 percent gain by American Water Works Co., the largest
U.S. water utility. Aqua America is based in  Bryn Mawr ,
Pennsylvania.  To contact the reporter on this story:
