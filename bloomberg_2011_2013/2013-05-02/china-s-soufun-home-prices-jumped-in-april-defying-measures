China’s new  home prices  jumped in
April by the most since December, defying the government’s
tightened property curbs, according to  SouFun Holdings Ltd. (SFUN)   Prices jumped 5.3 percent from a year earlier last month,
1.4 percentage points faster than March and the biggest gain
since housing costs ended eight months of declines in December,
the nation’s biggest real estate web owner said today in its
survey of 100 cities. The 10,098  yuan  per-square-meter (10.76
square feet) average price was 1 percent higher than in March
and 6 basis points lower than the previous month.  Home prices in March rose in the most cities tracked by the
government since September 2011 and housing sales jumped 69
percent in the first quarter, even as the government has
accelerated implementing curbs to control prices.  Thirty-five city governments issued details of property
measures by an April 1. Former Premier  Wen Jiabao  ordered the
central bank to raise down-payment requirements for second
mortgages in cities with excessive cost gains and told local
governments with the biggest price pressures to tighten home-
purchase limits and set price-control targets.  “Looking ahead, cities with excessively fast price gains
still face risks of a further policy tightening,” SouFun said
in the statement.  The average home prices of the 10 biggest cities rose 1.3
percent from March and jumped 7.9 percent from a year earlier,
according to SouFun.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
