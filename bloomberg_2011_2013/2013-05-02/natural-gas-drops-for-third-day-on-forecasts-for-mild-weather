Natural gas futures dropped the most
in nine months in  New York  after a government report showed that
U.S. stockpiles expanded by more than forecast.  Gas slid 7 percent, the biggest one-day decline since Aug.
2, after the Energy Information Administration said inventories
rose 43 billion cubic feet in the week ended April 26 to 1.777
trillion cubic feet. Analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg
showed a gain of 29 billion. Unusually cold weather into early
spring helped eliminate a  supply glut  that emerged in late 2011.  “It was a bearish injection and it may set the tone for
future storage reports,” said Kent Bayazitoglu, an analyst at
Gelber & Associates in Houston. “The big question is whether
we’re going to start seeing mega-injections that really start to
refill inventories.”  Natural gas for June delivery fell 30.1 cents to $4.025 per
million British thermal units on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the lowest settlement price since April 9. Gas traded
at $4.291 before the storage report was released at 10:30 a.m.
in  Washington . Trading volume was 56 percent above the 100-day
average as of 2:4 p.m. Prices are down 3.1 percent this week,
headed for the second straight decline.  The discount of May to October futures, a measure of supply
expectations for the summer, widened 0.7 cent to 9.7 cents.  June $4 puts were the most active options in electronic
trading, gaining 8.3 cents to 11.6 cents per million Btu on
volume of 1,932 at 2:43 p.m. Puts accounted for 59 percent of
trading volume.  Options Volatility  Implied volatility for June at-the-money options was 32.71
percent at 2:30 p.m., up from 31.25 percent yesterday. Implied
volatility for July options was 33.52 percent, up from 32.09
percent.  The stockpile increase was smaller than the five-year
average gain for the week of 67 billion cubic feet, department
data show. A  deficit  to the five-year average widened to 6.2
percent from 5.1 percent the previous week, the biggest such gap
since February 2011. Supplies were 30.9 percent below year-
earlier inventories, compared with 31.8 percent in last week’s
report.  MDA Weather Services in Gaithersburg,  Maryland , predicted
mostly normal or higher-than-average temperatures in the lower-
48 states from May 7 through May 11.  Mild Weather  The low in New York on May 8 may be 52 degrees Fahrenheit
(11 Celsius), matching the normal reading, and the high may be
66, according to  AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College ,
 Pennsylvania . The low in  Boston  on May 8 may be 52 degrees
Fahrenheit (11 Celsius), 4 more than usual, and the high may be
65.  About 50 percent of U.S. households use gas for heating,
according to the Energy Information Administration, the
statistical arm of the Energy Department. Power generation
accounts for 33 percent of gas consumption.  The EIA’s monthly EIA-914 report on April 30 showed that
gross gas production in the  lower-48 states  climbed 1.3 percent
to 73.22 billion cubic feet a day in February from a revised
72.3 billion the previous month. It was the biggest percentage
gain since October 2011 and the first increase in three months.  U.S. output rose 0.8 percent to 82.88 billion cubic feet a
day from a revised 82.2 billion, the most since November.  “New wells were brought online in the Marcellus and Bakken
Shales,” which drove the biggest volume gains, the EIA said in
the report. Output in  Texas , the top producing state, gained
with new Eagle Ford shale wells while New Mexico production
increased with warmer weather, the government said.  Production Report  Gas production rose to an all-time high of 28.5 trillion
cubic feet in 2011, led by record output from shale deposits,
the EIA said in a report Jan. 7. Shale accounted for 30 percent
of total production in 2011, up from 22 percent the previous
year.  The boom in oil and natural gas production helped the U.S.
cut its reliance on imported fuel. The U.S. produced 84 percent
of its own energy in 2012, the most since 1991, EIA data show.
The measure of self-sufficiency rose to 88 percent in December,
the highest since February 1987.  The relative strength index, or RSI, dropped to 46.17 as of
2:44 p.m., the least since February. A number above 70 is
considered by some traders to be a signal to sell contracts
while a number below 30 may be a sell signal. The RSI last
traded above 70 on April 19.  To contact the reporters on this story:
