Russia , the world’s biggest oil
producer, boosted crude and condensate  production  1.5 percent in
April from a year earlier to 10.47 million barrels a day, close
to a post-Soviet era record.  Daily output grew 0.2 percent from March, according to
preliminary data sent by e-mail today from the Energy Ministry’s
CDU-TEK unit. The record of 10.49 million barrels was reached in
November. Soviet-era production in Russia peaked at 11.48
million barrels a day in 1987.  Russian supply will be stable or increase slightly this
year,  Vagit Alekperov , the chief executive officer of the
nation’s second-biggest producer OAO Lukoil, said April 30 in
 St. Petersburg . President  Vladimir Putin  has called for output
to be maintained at more than 10 million barrels a day.  Exports in April rose 6.4 percent from the previous month
to 5.58 million barrels a day as seasonal refining maintenance
peaked. Shipments were up 1.1 percent from a year earlier.  Natural gas output advanced 0.3 percent last month from a
year earlier to 1.86 billion cubic meters a day, the data show.
Gazprom, Russia’s gas export monopoly, cut production 3.7
percent to 1.33 billion cubic meters a day.  OAO Rosneft, the world’s largest publicly traded oil
producer by volume, produced over 4 million barrels of crude and
condensate in Russia last month, including from its TNK-BP
assets. The state-controlled company purchased TNK-BP for $55
billion in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
