Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC) ,  Canada ’s
largest insurer, said first-quarter profit dropped 56 percent on
charges related to equity markets and interest rates, and as
insurance sales in Asia and Canada declined.  Net income  fell to C$540 million ($535.8 million), or 28
cents a share, from C$1.23 billion, or 63 cents, a year earlier,
the Toronto-based firm said today in a statement. The insurer
was expected to earn 27 cents a share, based on the  average
estimate  of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Manulife, owner of Boston-based John Hancock Financial,
said it had a 23 percent decline in total insurance sales
compared with a year earlier.  Among its competitors, Manulife
is the most affected by changes in equity markets and the least
linked to fluctuations in interest rates, Canadian Imperial Bank
of Commerce analysts including  Robert Sedran  said in an April 15
note. The company had record wealth sales of C$12.4 billion, up
43 percent from last year, and record funds under management of
C$555 billion.  “While insurance sales fell short of our expectations in
the first quarter, due to our taking a leadership role in
pricing to reflect lower interest rates, we also generated
record wealth sales,” Chief Executive Officer Donald Guloien,
56, said in the statement.  Manulife fell 0.9 percent to close yesterday at C$14.76 in
Toronto. The shares have gained 9.3 percent this year, outpacing
the 2.8 percent  advance  of the 44-company S&P/TSX Financials
Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
