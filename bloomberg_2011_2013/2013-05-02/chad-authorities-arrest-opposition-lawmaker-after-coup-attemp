Chadian authorities arrested
opposition lawmaker Saleh Maki and “several” civilians and
military personnel after stopping a coup attempt, government
spokesman Hassan Sylla Bakari said.  The suspects had been planning the overthrow for four
months prior to their arrests, Bakari said on national
television in the capital, N’Djamena. As many as eight people
were killed and at least 15 were injured in clashes between the
plotters and security forces,  Agence France-Presse  reported,
citing a person it didn’t identify.  “An attempt to destabilize the state was foiled,” Bakari
says. A group of individuals “wanted to undermine the
institutions of state.”  Chad , which produces 114,000 barrels of oil a day and has a
$9.49 billion economy, has been ruled by President Idriss Deby
since he seized power in a coup in December 1990. In 2008, 270
people were killed during fighting between government forces and
rebel fighters who entered N’Djamena in an attempt to overthrow
Deby, according to  Medecins Sans Frontieres , the Geneva-based
medical charity.  Deby, who turns 61 this year, also survived another attack
on his rule when army defectors tried to shoot down his aircraft
while he was returning from a trip abroad in 2006.  N’Djamena was calm this morning, with increased security in
the north and south of the city.  To contact the reporter on this story:
