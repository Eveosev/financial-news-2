  Arena Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ARNA) , the maker
of the weight-loss drug Belviq, said it is withdrawing its
application to gain regulatory approval in  Europe  for the
obesity medicine.  Arena will review its application to the European Medicines
Union for Belviq, approved in the U.S. in June as the first new
obesity drug in 13 years, before deciding when to resubmit it,
the San Diego-based company said today in a statement.  The pill, being promoted in  North America  by Tokyo-based
 Eisai Co. (4523) , works in a similar way to fenfluramine, part of the
fen-phen appetite-suppression drug combination pulled from
pharmacies in 1997 when it was linked to heart valve
abnormalities. It will be available in the U.S. after the Drug
Enforcement Administration completes a review to classify Belviq
based on its potential for abuse.  Arena didn’t give a timetable for its application in
Europe, saying it was “evaluating the best approach for
submitting at a later date.”  Shares declined 14 percent to $7.25 in extended trading at
5:01 p.m.  New York  time after gaining 2.1 percent to close at
$8.40.  Arena’s drug, previously known by its chemical name as
lorcaserin, was rejected by the FDA in 2010 because the agency
had concerns about cancer. Advisers to the agency determined the
benefits of the drug outweighed the risks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
