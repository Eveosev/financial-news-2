Palm oil  fell to the lowest level in
more than a week as crude oil declined, reducing the appeal of
vegetable oils as feedstock for biofuels.  The contract for July delivery fell as much as 1.2 percent
to 2,258 ringgit ($740) a metric ton on the Bursa Malaysia
Derivatives, the lowest price for most-active futures since
April 23, and ended the morning session at 2,268 ringgit.
Futures declined 3.9 percent in April.  West Texas Intermediate crude traded near the lowest level
in more than a week after government data showed U.S. stockpiles
climbed to the highest in 82 years. A record 5.6 million tons of
palm oil was used for fuel in 2012, according to Oil World, a
Hamburg-based research company.  “Crude oil weakened quite substantially and that will
affect biodiesel demand for palm oil,” said Alan Lim Seong Chun, an analyst at Kenanga Investment Bank Bhd. Futures also
declined after soybean and  soybean oil  prices fell, he said.  “Because these two products are usually used as
substitutes, cheaper soybean oil may not bode well for price
outlook for crude palm oil,” Lim said.  Soybeans for July delivery were little changed at $13.7325
a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, after declining 1.9
percent yesterday. Soybean oil was at 48.79 cents a pound from
48.85 cents yesterday. Soybean oil’s  premium  over palm was at
$333.26 a ton today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Refined palm oil for September delivery retreated as much
as 2.1 percent to 5,826 yuan ($947) a ton on the  Dalian
Commodity Exchange , the lowest price for the most-active
contract since October 2009. Soybean oil fell 1.5 percent to
7,194  yuan  a ton, poised for the lowest close since February
2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
