The European Union said  Italy ’s
payment of overdue bills to companies will be taken into account
in the EU’s economic forecasts due tomorrow.  “The program for the repayment of commercial debt by Italy
-- this is set out in the stability program and we take that
into account” in the EU forecasts, Simon O’Connor, spokesman
for EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn ,
told reporters today in Brussels.  O’Connor said last month that the repayment program was
unlikely to interfere with deficit and debt reduction in Italy.
“We believe this can be done while ensuring the exit of
Italy from the excessive-deficit procedure,” O’Connor said on
April 8. The EU “strongly supports” the Italian move, he said.  European Commission President  Jose Barroso  said today that
he is “very confident that it will be possible” for Italy to
exit the deficit procedure. He made the remarks after meeting
with Italian Prime MinisterEnrico Letta in Brussels.  O’Connor said the commission “will take into account any
new information that is made available by Italy” before it
issues country-specific recommendations for the 27 EU nations in
late May. “The earlier the information comes in the better,”
he said.    Letta on April 29 pledged a series of tax cuts to boost
economic growth and create jobs. Barroso said his confidence in
Italy exiting the EDP program is subject to the details and
implementation of those measures.  “We trust the government will finance these in a credible
way, in order to keep the deficit below 3 percent of GDP in
2013, and achieve and maintain a balanced budgetary position in
structural terms,” Barroso said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
