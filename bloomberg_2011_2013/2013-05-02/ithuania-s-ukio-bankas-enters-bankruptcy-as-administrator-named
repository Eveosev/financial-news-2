A Lithuanian court began bankruptcy
proceedings against Ukio Bankas AB at the request of the central
bank, which shut the Kaunas-based lender in February because of
risky loans to related parties.  Kaunas District Court today also issued a decree naming the
firm Valnetas UAB as Ukio’s bankruptcy administrator, the court
said on its website. The decisions may be appealed within 10
days, according to the statement.  Ukio was  Lithuania ’s fourth-largest bank by deposits when
it was closed. The lender’s liabilities exceeded its assets by
1.2 billion litai ($463 million) as of March 18, the Bank of
Lithuania in Vilnius, Lithuania’s capital, said last month,
citing financial statements prepared by Ukio’s temporary
administrator, Adomas Audickas, and auditor KPMG Baltic.  The permanent bankruptcy administrator will determine how
and when to seek recovery of Ukio’s assets, which include claims
on a majority stake in Scottish premier-league soccer club Heart
of Midlothian as well as the team’s stadium in Edinburgh,
Audickas said in a phone interview on April 30.  Valnetas, which like Ukio is based in the central
Lithuanian city of Kaunas, specializes in corporate bankruptcy
and restructuring, according to its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
