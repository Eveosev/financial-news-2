 Liquefied natural gas for delivery to
Northeast Asia fell for a 11th straight week, driven by weak
demand for short-term cargoes, according to Energy Intelligence.  Spot cargoes for delivery during the next four to eight
weeks dropped to $14.75 per million British thermal units, the
research company said on the website of its World Gas
Intelligence publication. Thatâ€™s down from $14.80 per million
Btu on April 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
