South African corn dropped for the
first time in three days after prices fell in the U.S. yesterday
as better weather for planting was predicted for this week.  White corn for delivery in July, the most active contract,
dropped 1.5 percent to 2,198 rand ($245) a metric ton, the most
since April 24, by the close in Johannesburg. The yellow variety
for delivery in the same month, fell 1.4 percent to 2,182 rand a
ton.  Corn closed 0.5 percent lower at $6.4675 a bushel yesterday
on the Chicago Board of Trade on speculation that warm, dry
weather this week will firm muddy soil in the Midwest and allow
farmers to accelerate planting.  “Last night the American price was down as weather
services predicted better planting conditions for the coming
week,” Thys Grobbelaar, an analyst at Klerksdorp, South Africa-
based Senwes Ltd., said by phone today.  Commodity Weather Group, based in the U.S., yesterday
scaled back rain forecasts and expected dry weather to return
through May 15, even as it said rain was moving into  Nebraska 
and western  Iowa  and would move east in the next four days,
temporarily halting planting.  America is the world’s largest producer of corn and output
from  South Africa  is the biggest on the continent. The white
variety is a staple food in the country while the yellow variety
is mainly used as  animal feed .  Wheat for delivery in July gained 0.7 percent to 3,500.20
rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
