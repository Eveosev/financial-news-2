The yield on  India ’s benchmark 2022
bond dropped to the lowest level since 2010, and the rupee rose
to the highest in more than two months after the government
reduced a levy on overseas investments in local debt.  The so-called withholding tax, charged on interest income
earned by foreigners on rupee-denominated notes, will be reduced
to 5 percent from 20 percent, Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram said in parliament on April 30. Global funds boosted
their  holdings  of the bonds to a record $36.22 billion on April
29, exchange data show. Local debt and the currency pared gains
ahead of the central bank’s interest-rate review tomorrow. Most
economists in a Bloomberg survey predict an  interest-rate 
reduction.  “The withholding tax reduction should make Indian bonds
more attractive,” Nagaraj Kulkarni and Priyanka Kishore,
Standard Chartered Plc analysts based in Singapore and Mumbai,
wrote in a report today. The  tax cut  also “adds to the bullish
rupee sentiment,” they wrote.  The yield on the 8.15 percent securities due June 2022
ended little changed from April 30 at 7.73 percent in Mumbai,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 7.68 percent
earlier, the lowest level for a benchmark 10-year note since
July 2010. Indian financial markets were shut yesterday for a
local holiday.  The rupee also ended little changed at 53.8150 per dollar,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 53.6650
earlier, the strongest since Feb. 28, and a “strong” technical
support level, according to  HDFC Bank Ltd. (HDFCB)  One-month implied
volatility in the rupee, a gauge of expected moves in the
 exchange rate  used to price options, rose 30 basis points from
yesterday, or 0.30 percentage point, to 8.80 percent.  Rate Meeting  The  Reserve Bank  of India today said space for monetary
policy to support economic growth remains constrained by
elevated consumer-price inflation and a record current-account
deficit. The monetary authority will lower its  repurchase  rate
to 7.25 percent from 7.5 percent tomorrow, according to 33 of 40
economists in a Bloomberg survey. Six see no change and one
predicts a cut to 7 percent.  The European Central Bank today cut its key interest rate
to a record low as the 17-nation euro region struggles to emerge
from recession.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 54.81 per
dollar, compared with 54.74 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 54.41 versus 54.31. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
