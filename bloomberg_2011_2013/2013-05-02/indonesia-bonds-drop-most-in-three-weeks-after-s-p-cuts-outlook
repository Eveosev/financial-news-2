Indonesian  government bonds  fell, with
the 10-year yield rising the most in more than three weeks,
after  Standard & Poor’s  cut its outlook on the country’s debt
rating. Rupiah forwards dropped by the most since January.  S&P revised its view on the nation’s debt to stable from
positive, citing a stalling of reform momentum and a weaker
external profile in a statement today. The company maintained
Indonesia’s rating at its highest junk level of BB+.  The yield on the 5.625 percent notes due May 2023 rose five
basis points to 5.56 percent as of 5:39 p.m. in Jakarta, the
most since April 8, prices from the Inter Dealer Market
Association show. The yield dropped seven basis points last
month after climbing 38 basis points in the first quarter.  “This news may become a turning point for bonds to correct
after the rally in April as investors reevaluate  Indonesia ,”
said I Made Adi Saputra, a fixed-income analyst at PT Nusantara
Capital Securities in Jakarta. The 10-year yield may reach 5.7
percent by the end of June, he forecast.  The rupiah’s one-month non-deliverable forwards declined
0.5 percent to 9,790 per dollar, the biggest drop since Jan. 28,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. They traded at a 0.6 percent
discount to the spot rate, which was steady at 9,727 per dollar,
prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg show.  A daily  fixing  used to settle the derivatives was set at
9,727 today by the Association of Banks in  Singapore , compared
with 9,722 on April 30. One-month implied volatility for the
rupiah, a measure of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to
price options, dropped six basis points, or 0.06 percentage
point, to 5.55 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
