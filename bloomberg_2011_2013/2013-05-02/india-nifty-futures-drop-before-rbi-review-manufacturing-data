Indian (SENSEX)  stock futures dropped before
the  Reserve Bank  of India meets to review monetary policy
tomorrow, and before today’s release of manufacturing data.  SGX CNX Nifty Index futures  for May delivery fell 0.2
percent to 5,959.5 at 10:05 a.m. in Singapore. The underlying
CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index advanced 0.4 percent to 5,930.20 on April 30.
The S&P BSE Sensex index gained 0.6 percent to 19,504.18. Indian
markets were closed yesterday for a public holiday. The Bank of
 New York  Mellon India ADR Index of U.S.-traded shares fell 0.9
percent yesterday.  The Sensex capped its biggest monthly gain since November
last month as slowing wholesale-price inflation and a drop in
gold and oil stoked speculation the central bank will cut
borrowing costs tomorrow. The RBI may lower its key rate by 25
basis points, according to the median estimate of 40 economists
in a Bloomberg survey. HSBC Holdings and Markit Economics
release manufacturing data for April today. The purchasing
managers’ index dropped to a 16-month low in March.  “The rally over the past few days has been very good,
hence some amount of caution is creeping in,”  Arun Kejriwal ,
director at Mumbai-based Kejriwal Research & Investment
Services, said by telephone today. “A 25 basis-point rate cut
is already in the price, only a bigger rate cut will take the
markets higher from here.”  Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI) , India’s biggest mobile phone company,
may say fourth-quarter profit declined 24 percent to 7.65
billion rupees ($142 million) from 10.1 billion rupees a year
earlier, according to the median of 26 analyst estimates in a
Bloomberg survey.  Foreign funds bought a net $122 million of local shares on
April 29, taking their net investment in equities this year to
$11.15 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Inflows last
year totaled $24.5 billion, the most among 10 Asian markets
tracked by Bloomberg, the data show.  The Sensex trades at 13.1 times  projected 12-month profits ,
compared with MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index’s 10.4 times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
