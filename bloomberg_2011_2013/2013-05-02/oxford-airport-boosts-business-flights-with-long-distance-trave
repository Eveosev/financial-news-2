London Oxford Airport  has more than
doubled the number of departing business flights since 2006,
making it the U.K.’s fifth-largest hub for corporate travelers,
ahead of Stansted and London City Airport.  Daily business aviation departures rose to an average of
8.1 in 2012, compared with 3.2 in 2006, the airport said in a
statement today, citing figures from Eurocontrol. More than
5,900 corporate flights flew to and from the airport last year,
compared with 24,674 at London’s Luton airport, the top U.K.
airport for business flights.  London Oxford has sought to attract larger  business jets  by
adding ground-handling equipment, boosting its fire and rescue
capabilities and increasing the licensed take-off distances of
the runway. The addition of two Global Express jets by  Hangar 8
Plc (HGR8) , formerly based at the U.K.’s second-largest corporate hub,
Farnborough, has added cities like  Chicago  and Mumbai to its
charter destinations.  “These aircraft bring the wider world to Oxford’s front
door,” James Dillon-Godfray, the airport’s development
director, said in the statement.  Located about 11 kilometers (6.8 miles) north of Oxford and
about 100 kilometers from central London, the airport was
rebranded as London Oxford Airport in 2009.  Biggin Hill and Northolt were third and fourth in 2012 in
corporate flights, according to Eurocontrol’s OneSky Database.  To contact the reporter on this story:
