Great-West Lifeco Inc. (GWO) , the owner of
Putnam Investments, said Chief Executive Officer Allen Loney
will retire and that Raymond L. McFeetors will step down as
chairman.  Chief Operating Officer Paul A. Mahon, 49, will succeed
Loney, and R. Jeffrey Orr, a director since 2002, has been
appointed to succeed McFeetors, the Winnipeg, Manitoba-based
company said today in a statement after reporting first-quarter
results. Loney’s retirement will take effect tomorrow, said
Marlene Klassen, a spokeswoman for the insurer. Loney and
McFeetors, 68, will remain as directors, according to the
statement.  Loney, who led Great-West since the 2008 financial crisis
and received compensation totaling C$4.44 million ($4.41
million) for 2012, worked in various roles at the firm over more
than four decades and took the helm a year after Great-West
acquired Putnam, the U.S. mutual-fund business.  The insurer bought Putnam in August 2007 from Marsh &
McLennan Cos. for $3.9 billion, the largest acquisition ever in
 Canada ’s insurance industry. Great-West’s $1.73 billion purchase
of Irish Life Group Ltd. in February was the second-biggest.  Earlier today, Great-West reported that first-quarter
profit climbed 15 percent to C$517 million, or 54 cents a share,
from $449 million, or 47 cents, a year earlier.  Great-West  advanced  1.3 percent to C$27.63 at 4 p.m. in
Toronto. The shares have climbed 13 percent this year, compared
with the 3.5 percent gain of the 44-company Standard &
Poor’s/TSX Financials Index.  Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC) , the largest life insurer in
Canada, also had a leadership change today. Vice Chairman
Richard DeWolfe succeeded Gail Cook-Bennett as chairman, the
Toronto-based company said in a statement. Manulife rose 3.9
percent to C$15.33.  To contact the reporter on this story:
