U.K. Defense Secretary Philip Hammond
said evidence of chemical weapons use in  Syria  is “compelling
but not conclusive” and “hard evidence” will be needed to
mobilize international action against the Syrian regime.  “There is compelling but not conclusive evidence that
chemical weapons have been used,” Hammond said today in a
briefing for reporters at the British embassy in Washington.
“We need to continue to build that evidence base.”  Hammond, echoing President  Barack Obama ’s call for more
investigation, said conclusive evidence that the Syrian
government used chemical weapons would be critical for the U.K.
to support any military intervention.  “We went to war in Iraq based on evidence that proved not
to be correct,” Hammond said. “We have to be absolutely sure
we are on firm ground and we’re not looking at another dodgy
dossier.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
