Golden State Warriors coach Mark
Jackson was fined $25,000 by the  National Basketball Association 
for accusing the  Denver Nuggets  of dirty play.  The fine was announced today by Stu Jackson, the NBA’s
executive vice president of basketball operations, who said
Jackson’s comments were an attempt to influence officials.  The Warriors host the Nuggets in Game 6 of their first-
round playoff series tonight, with Golden State leading 3-2 and
needing one more win to eliminate Denver.  Jackson told reporters after the Warriors’ 107-100 loss at
Denver two nights ago in Game 5 that the Nuggets had attempted
to take cheap shots at Golden State top scorer Stephen Curry.  “They tried to send hit men at Steph,” Jackson said
following that game. “There were some dirty plays early.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
