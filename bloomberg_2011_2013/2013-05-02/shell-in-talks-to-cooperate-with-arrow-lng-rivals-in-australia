Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , Europe’s
biggest oil company, said its Arrow Energy Ltd. venture in
 Australia  is in cooperation talks with competitors building
liquefied natural gas projects in Queensland state.  Shell has deliberately delayed a decision to go ahead with
a proposed LNG project on Australia’s east coast through its
Arrow venture with PetroChina Co. amid cost inflation in the
country, Shell Chief Financial Officer Simon Henry said today on
a call with reporters.  BG Group Plc (BG/) ,  ConocoPhillips (COP)  and  Santos
Ltd. (STO)  are building three projects on Queensland’s  Curtis Island 
at a cost of more than $60 billion.  “We are talking with all of the three current companies
about the potential to cooperate,” Henry said after Shell
reported a surprise increase in first-quarter profit.
“Australian cost inflation is a significant challenge, not only
on current projects, but future potential projects.”  Shell said in November it may delay until 2014 a decision
on whether to go ahead with the Arrow venture.  Shell’s current 23 percent stake in Perth-based  Woodside
Petroleum Ltd. (WPL)  isn’t a strategic holding, Henry reiterated. The
company sold 10 percent of Woodside at A$42.23 a share in
November 2010.  “While it remains non-strategic, it is valuable,” he said.
“We have no intention of divesting at the wrong part of the
cycle, so we’re not in any particular hurry.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
