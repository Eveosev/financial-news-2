China ’s  yuan  advanced to a 19-year
high after the central bank raised the currency’s reference rate
by the most in more than six months amid speculation U.S.
monetary stimulus will spur faster gains. Volatility surged.  The yuan strengthened 0.15 percent to close at 6.1560 per
dollar from April 26 in  Shanghai  as markets reopened after a
three-day holiday, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade
System. The People’s Bank of China set the  fixing  0.2 percent
stronger, the most since Oct. 15, at 6.2082 per dollar.  Morgan Stanley boosted its year-end forecast for the yuan
to 6.1 from 6.3 this week, citing prospects for a widening in
the trading band and an increase in market participants. The
 Federal Reserve  said it will keep buying $85 billion of bonds a
month and signaled it may raise purchases should growth weaken.  “Investors are expecting China will widen the band, which
means the yuan will appreciate faster,” said  Daniel Chan , a
Hong Kong-based executive vice president at Glory Sky Global
Markets Ltd. “The dollar is likely to stay weak based on the
Fed statement, which continues to drive inflows to higher-
yielding currencies such as the yuan.”  The currency earlier touched 6.1537 per dollar, the
strongest level since the government unified the official and
market exchange rates at the end of 1993. The spot is allowed to
diverge a maximum 1 percent from the daily fixing, which was set
today at the highest since a dollar peg ended in July 2005.  Speculation for a change in the trading band heightened on
April 18 when PBOC Deputy Governor Yi Gang said it would be
widened “in the near future.” The last revision was announced
on April 14, 2012, when it was doubled.  Volatility Climbs  One-month implied volatility in the onshore yuan, a measure
of exchange-rate swings used to price options, rose 21 basis
points, or 0.21 percentage point, to 1.68 percent. That’s the
biggest increase since Dec. 13 and the highest since Jan. 14.  China’s manufacturing is showing signs of slowing. HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics announced today a final April
reading of 50.4 for its  Purchasing Managers ’ Index, compared
with 51.6 for March and a preliminary reading of 50.5. The
official PMI issued yesterday was 50.6 last month, compared with
the 50.7  median forecast  in a Bloomberg News survey and a March
reading of 50.9. Levels above 50 signal expansion.  “Although China’s PMI has slowed down, it’s still
relatively stable,” said Chan. “The U.S. economic rebound
could be losing some steam and that will feed into a weaker
dollar.”  In  Hong Kong ’s offshore market, the yuan rose 0.07 percent
to 6.1576 per dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It earlier touched a record 6.1560. Twelve-month non-deliverable
forwards climbed 0.1 percent to 6.2242, trading at a 1.1 percent
discount to the spot rate in Shanghai.  Hong Kong’s  yuan deposits  rose to a record 668 billion yuan
($109 billion) at the end of March, the Hong Kong Monetary
Authority said on April 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
