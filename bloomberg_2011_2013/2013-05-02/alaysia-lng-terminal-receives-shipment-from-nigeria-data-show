Petroliam Nasional Bhd.,  Malaysia ’s
state-owned oil and gas producer, received a cargo of liquefied
natural gas at its Sungai Udang receiving terminal in Melaka,
according to ship-tracking data.  The Seri Bijaksana, with a capacity of 152,888 cubic
meters, arrived yesterday at Melaka on the western coast of
peninsular Malaysia, according to ship transmissions captured by
IHS Fairplay on Bloomberg. The tanker sailed from Nigeria LNG
Ltd.’s Bonny Island terminal, where it loaded the supercooled
natural gas and departed March 27.  Wilson Lee, a Petronas spokesman in Kuala Lumpur, said over
the phone he didn’t know if the Melaka terminal recently
received its first LNG cargo. Kudo Eresia-Eke, an Abuja-based
official at Nigeria LNG, didn’t reply to an e-mail sent outside
normal working hours.  Petronas is scheduled to start operations at its 3.8
million metric ton-a-year Melaka terminal by mid-2013, according
to an e-mail sent March 8 from Azman Ibrahim, a company
spokesman based in  Kuala Lumpur .  To contact the reporter on this story:
