MGM China Holdings Ltd. (2282) , a Macau
casino venture between  MGM Resorts International (MGM)  and casino
mogul  Stanley Ho ’s daughter Pansy Ho, posted a 9.7 percent rise
in first-quarter profit as mainland visitors spent more.  Adjusted property earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, or property Ebitda, increased to
$180.5 million from $164.5 million a year earlier, according to
the U.S.-based parent’s filing on PR Newswire. That compares
with the median estimate of $182 million from four analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Net revenue at MGM China for the quarter ended in March
rose 6 percent to $748 million, MGM International said.  The company has only one casino in Macau and faces rising
competition as bigger rivals expand.  Sands China Ltd. (1928) , Galaxy
Entertainment Group Ltd. and  Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd. (6883)  are
adding new resorts to lure more gamblers from China’s mainland.  MGM China broke ground on Feb. 27 on its first resort on
Cotai, a piece of reclaimed land in Macau envisioned as Asia’s
equivalent of the Las Vegas strip.  Casino revenue  in Macau, the only place in China where
casino gambling is legal, raked in $38 billion casino revenue
last year, six times that of Las Vegas strip. Deutsche Bank AG
estimated casino revenue will rise 17 percent to $44.5 billion
this year.  MGM China fell 2.2 percent to HK$17.90 at the close of  Hong
Kong  trading, before the earnings announcement. The stock has
climbed 28 percent this year, outperforming the benchmark Hang
Seng Index’s 0.05 percent gain.  Turnover at MGM China’s VIP-room gambling tables rose 15
percent from a year earlier, volumes increased 26 percent for
main-floor tables and 19 percent for slot machines, MGM said in
the filing. The unit had operating income of $99 million
compared with $68 million a year earlier, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
