Redefine Properties Ltd. (RDF) ,  South
Africa ’s second-biggest real estate developer, swung to a profit
of 1.16 billion rand ($128 million) in the first half as it
improved properties and raised rents.  Net income compared with a 511 million-rand loss a year
earlier, the Johannesburg-based company said in a statement
today. Revenue advanced to 1.85 billion rand in the six months
through February, from 1.6 billion rand as the company renewed
leases at an average rental increase of 7.2 percent even as
vacancies grew, it said.  Redefine is raising cash through bonds and a share issue to
finance acquisitions and new projects. The company spent 5
billion rand in cash and shares to amass a 46 percent stake in
 Fountainhead Property Trust (FPT) , blocking  Growthpoint Properties
Ltd.’s (GRT)  higher bid.  “The local trading environment remains challenging and is
anticipated to remain subdued in the medium term,” the company
said. “Distributable income is anticipated to grow in the
second half at a similar rate to the interim period.”  The stock advanced 0.6 percent to 10.80 rand a share on
April 30, its highest price since at least 2000. Redefine was
unchanged at 9:15 a.m. local time today, and has gained 15
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
