Power stations and factories in the
European Union’s emissions market probably doubled their use of
United Nations carbon offsets to meet their pollution limits
last year, according to a survey of analysts.  Companies have surrendered about 600 million Certified
Emission Reductions and Emission Reduction Units for 2012,
compared with 254.6 million offsets in the previous year,
according to the median estimate of five analysts surveyed by
 Bloomberg News  in the past two days. The European Commission
will today publish data on how many offsets were used to match
emissions at more than 12,000 installations.  Offset use has surged as credits for emissions of
hydrofluorocarbon-23 and nitrous oxide, used in the production
of refrigerators and nylon, lose their eligibility in the EU
market at the end of the second phase of the market, which ran
from 2008 through 2012. As many as 240 million certificates were
available to buyers as of April 30, the deadline for compliance,
UN data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Under EU rules, companies can use a maximum of 1.4 billion
tons of UN offsets for compliance in the second phase of the
market, which is equivalent to 68 percent of last year’s
emissions cap set by the EU. Any unused quota of eligible
credits may be used in the third phase that runs through 2020.  The estimate of offsets used in 2012 by European emitters
means that installations in the world’s largest carbon market
may transfer as many as 1.9 billion unused EU permits into the
third phase, which started in January, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  UN Certified Emission Reductions and Emission Reduction
Units represent the cutting of one ton of carbon dioxide
equivalent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
