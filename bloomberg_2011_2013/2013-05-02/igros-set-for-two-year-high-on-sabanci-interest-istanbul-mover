Migros Ticaret AS (MGROS)  surged to a two-year
high after  Carrefour SA (CA) ’s Turkish joint-venture partner said
it’s considering buying the grocery chain.  The shares  rose 2.4 percent to 23.8 liras at the close in
Istanbul, the highest level since May 2011. Almost 6.2 million
shares traded, more than six times the stock’s three-month daily
average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The  Borsa
Istanbul National 100 (XU100)  index jumped 3.1 percent to the highest
since at least January 1988.  CarrefourSa Carrefour Sabanci Ticaret Merkezi AS (CARFA) , a joint
venture of Carrefour and Haci Omer Sabanci Holding AS, may
consider acquiring Migros, Sabanci’s retail group chief Haluk Dincer told reporters in Istanbul today. Sabanci said April 30
it will raise its stake in CarrefourSa by 12 percentage points
to 50.8 percent.  “There’s an interest toward Turkish equities in general,”
Cemal Demirtas, head of research at Ata Invest in Istanbul, said
by phone today. Sabanci may focus on making CarrefourSa
profitable before it considers acquisitions, he said.  The company reported an annual loss of 5.5 million liras
($3.1 million) last year, its fourth in a row.  Profit at Migros, owned by private equity firm BC Partners
Ltd., will probably climb 35 percent to 118.8 million liras this
year, according to the average estimate of 22 analysts  on
Bloomberg.  Eighteen analysts recommend buying the shares, while
seven say hold and three sell, the data  show .  To contact the reporter on this story:
