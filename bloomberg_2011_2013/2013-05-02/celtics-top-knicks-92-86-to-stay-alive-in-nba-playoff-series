Kevin Garnett  had 16 points and 18
rebounds as the Boston Celtics avoided National Basketball
Association postseason elimination for the second straight game
with a 92-86 victory last night at the New York Knicks.  The Knicks still lead the best-of-seven first-round series
three games to two, with Game 6 set for tomorrow night at
Boston’s TD Garden.  The Celtics opened a 15-point lead early in the fourth
quarter and held off a Knicks rally thanks to consecutive 3-
pointers by  Jeff Green , who had 18 points to lead Boston. The
Knicks scored the first 11 points of the game, only to trail by
six points at halftime and by 69-60 entering the fourth period.  “We talked before the game that we were going to have to
overcome tremendous emotion at the start of the game and that
happened,” Celtics coach Doc Rivers told reporters. “Everybody
just wanted to be in the fight tonight, and everyone did their
part.”  Last night’s game ended with a verbal exchange between
Celtics reserve Jordan Crawford and the Knicks’ Carmelo Anthony
and  Raymond Felton  after the final buzzer. There was some
pushing and shoving as players and coaches tried to keep them
apart.  The Knicks-Celtics winner advances to play the survivor of
the series between the  Indiana Pacers  and the Atlanta Hawks. The
Pacers lead that series 3-2 after a 106-83 home win last night.  The Pacers, who were led by  David West ’s 24 points and  Paul George ’s 21 points and 10 rebounds, can finish off the Hawks
with a win in Game 6 at Atlanta tomorrow night.  Rockets Win  Also last night,  James Harden  had 31 points and the Houston
Rockets stayed alive in their playoff series with a 107-100 win
at the Oklahoma City Thunder, who got 36 points from  Kevin Durant . The Thunder still lead the series 3-2, with Game 6
tomorrow night at Houston.  Tonight, the Brooklyn Nets try to avoid elimination for the
second straight game as they play in Chicago against the Bulls,
who have a 3-2 series lead. The Golden State Warriors, leading
3-2 in their series against the Denver Nuggets, try to wrap up
that series at home.  Brandon Bass  and  Jason Terry  had 17 points apiece and  Paul Pierce  added 16 last night for the Celtics, who were 11-for-22
on 3-pointers and made all 17 of their free throw attempts. The
Knicks were 5-for-22 from behind the 3-point line.  Anthony was 8-for-24 shooting while scoring 22 points to
lead the Knicks. J.R. Smith, who sat out Game 4 of the series
because of a suspension, went 3-for-14 from the field and scored
14 points.  Anthony Struggles  Anthony’s 22 points were the fewest he’s had in a game
since he scored the same amount on March 27 against the Memphis
Grizzlies.  New York  is still seeking to win its first playoff series
since 2000, when it beat the Toronto Raptors and Miami Heat
before falling to the Pacers in the Eastern Conference finals.
They wrapped up both of those series on the road.  The Knicks were trying to clinch a series at their Madison
Square Garden home for the first time since June 11, 1999, when
they beat Indiana 90-82 in Game 6 to advance to the NBA Finals -
- where they lost to the San Antonio Spurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
