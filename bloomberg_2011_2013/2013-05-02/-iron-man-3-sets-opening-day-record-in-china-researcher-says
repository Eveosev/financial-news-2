Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s “Iron Man 3,” the
first big release of the summer movie season, set a record for
opening-day ticket sales in  China , according to BoxOffice.com.  The official figure is $18.7 million, the  film researcher 
said today, citing Burbank, California-based Disney. The total
is projected to increase to $21.5 million after all Chinese
cinemas showing the movie complete their reporting.  Disney’s Marvel division and Beijing-based DMG
Entertainment crafted a version of the film for audiences in
China, now the world’s second-largest movie market. The retooled
picture highlights Chinese actors and includes additional China
footage. Showings in the U.S. start tonight.  Chinese actor Wang Xueqi appears in both versions, along
with star Robert Downey Jr., and both will include scenes filmed
in Beijing in December. The Chinese version will also feature
actress Fan Bingbing and include bonus footage for the Chinese
fans, according to an April 24 statement from Disney.  Disney  rose  1.1 percent to $63.88 at the close in New York.
The stock has gained 28 percent this year, compared with 12
percent for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
