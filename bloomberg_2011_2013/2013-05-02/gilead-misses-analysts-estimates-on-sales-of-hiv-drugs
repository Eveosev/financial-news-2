Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD) , the world’s
biggest maker of AIDS medicines, reported first-quarter profit
that missed analysts’ estimates on declining sales of its HIV
drugs.  Net income  increased to $722 million, or 43 cents a share,
from $442 million, or 28 cents a share, a year earlier, the
Foster City, California-based company said today in a statement.
Earnings, excluding some items, of 48 cents a share fell short
by 2 cents of the average of 24 analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Revenue rose 11 percent to $2.53 billion.  Gilead shares rose 79 percent  last year , the most since
1995, as sales of of HIV drugs increased and optimism built
about its experimental hepatitis C therapies leading a $20
billion market. Sales of the treatments in the U.S. alone may
reach $6.5 billion in 2014 or 2015 after it wins regulatory
clearance,  Mark Schoenebaum , an analyst with  International
Strategy & Investment Group in New York, said in a note to
clients in March.  “Gilead could utterly annihilate 2014 consensus numbers,”
Schoenebaum wrote in his note. “I have a hard time believing
the stock doesn’t continue to go higher. And in a worse case,
stock probably won’t go down.”  Revenue rose 11 percent to $2.53 billion compared with
analysts’ estimates of $2.59 billion. Sales of its HIV drugs,
Atripla and Truvada, declined 4 percent to 1.58 billion in the
quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
