Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU) , the second-
largest U.S. life insurer, gained the most since 2011 as profit
beat estimates, fueled by results outside the U.S.  The insurer jumped $4.39, or 7.4 percent, to $63.67 at
10:31 a.m. in New York. The shares have advanced about 19
percent since Dec. 31.  Operating profit was $2.28 per share, beating by about 42
cents the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
The Newark, New Jersey-based insurer benefited from stronger
results at its international business, which focuses on Asia,
and from its deal to acquire  Hartford Financial Services Group
Inc. (HIG) ’s individual life insurance operations, Prudential said in
a statement yesterday.  “This may have been Prudential’s best quarter ever, and we
are affirming our top pick rating,”  Eric Berg , an analyst at
RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a research note today.
“Prudential’s rapidly expanding Japan business, representing
half of the company’s earnings, is providing ballast to the
company’s earnings growth.”  In the international unit, operating income jumped 47
percent to $877 million in the first quarter. The company
benefited from lower costs tied to integrating units it bought
from American International Group Inc. as well as business
growth, according to the statement.  MetLife Inc. (MET) , the largest U.S. life insurer, also gained
after profit beat estimates. The shares climbed 2.7 percent to
$39.43.  Operating profit at New York-based MetLife was $1.48 a
share, exceeding the $1.30 average estimate of analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg. Operating earnings rose 11 percent in Asia,
MetLife said yesterday in a statement.  The KBW Insurance Index gained 0.7 percent, as 16 of its 24
companies advanced.  Lincoln National Corp. (LNC) , the Radnor,
Pennsylvania-based insurer, tumbled 3.7 percent after operating
profit missed the average estimate of analysts. Claims costs
from  life insurance  were higher than expected, according to a
statement yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
