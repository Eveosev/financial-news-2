Swiss stocks  dropped, after the
benchmark index completed its longest streak of monthly gains in
seven years, as  Swisscom AG (SCMN)  reported worse-than-expected sales
and profit for the first quarter.  Swisscom fell 1.3 percent, for the second-biggest drop on
the Swiss Market Index.  ABB Ltd. (ABBN)  slid 1 percent after peer
Siemens AG cut its full-year earnings forecast.  Transocean Ltd. (RIG) ,
the worldâ€™s biggest supplier of offshore rigs, rose 2.1 percent.  The  SMI (SMI)  dropped 0.4 percent to 7,871.29 at 9:37 a.m.in
Zurich, as the market reopened after the Labor Day holiday. The
gauge rallied 1.2 percent in April, its eighth consecutive month
of gains, as investors bet that central banks will maintain
economic stimulus. The broader Swiss Performance Index lost 0.4
percent today.  The European Central Bank will lower its benchmark rate by
25 basis points to a  record low  of 0.5 percent today, according
to 44 of 70 economist  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. The

Bratislava, Slovakia. ECB President  Mario Draghi  will hold a
press conference 45 minutes later.  The volume of shares changing hands in SMI-listed companies
today was almost double the average of the past 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
