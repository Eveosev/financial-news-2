Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA) ,  EasyJet Plc (EZJ)  and
other European discount will offer more than 30 million seats
for the first time this month, extending growth that’s seen them
boost capacity by 14 percent a year over the past decade.  Low-cost carriers have added more than 20 million seats to
their market share in 10 years, versus an increase of 2.8 just
million seats at their full-service rivals, according to a
report published today by flight schedule data provider OAG.  The trend has driven former flag-carriers including  Air
France-KLM Group (AF)  and  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  to revamp short-haul
operations in a bid to stave off no-frills peers, OAG Executive
Vice President John Grant said in London. Still, in mature
markets like  Europe  and the U.S., the rapid capacity growth of
the low-cost sectors appears to have plateaued, he added.  “The complete polarization of legacy versus low-cost is
beginning to merge into a hybrid situation, with the legacy
airlines frequently using the more sophisticated product
offering of some of the low-cost carriers,” Grant said.  While the U.K. is Europe’s biggest market for discount
airlines, with more than 8.8 million international seats as of
this month, the low-cost model’s greatest penetration has been
in  Spain , where it accounts for 51 percent of domestic capacity
and 54 percent of the market for foreign flights, OAG said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
