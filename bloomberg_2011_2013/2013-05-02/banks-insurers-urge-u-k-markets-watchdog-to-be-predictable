Regulated financial firms urged the
month-old Financial Conduct Authority to open better lines of
communication with the industry and implement rules in a
predictable manner.  The FCA should be “proportionate and predictable in its
approach” said Graham Beale, chairman of the FCA Practitioner
Panel, a group that monitors regulatory developments and
includes representatives from  Barclays Plc (BARC) ,  London Stock
Exchange Group Plc (LSE)  and Direct Line Insurance Group Plc, in a
survey published today.  The FCA on April 1 took over the market abuse and consumer
finance enforcement duties from the Financial Services
Authority, which was phased out by lawmakers who blamed it for
failing to prevent the financial crisis in 2008. Around 80
percent of senior finance executives surveyed by the panel said
they wanted the FCA to be clearer on regulatory changes than its
predecessor.  “As the FCA, we have changed our approach and the way we
regulate, and we are becoming a more forward-looking,
predictable and engaged regulator which acts from a position of
greater understanding of the industry,” Martin Wheatley, chief
executive officer of the FCA, said in an e-mailed statement.  The survey also found that only around a quarter of the
1,470 respondents thought the FCA would be able to promote
competition in financial services.  “There is still a lack of clarity in the sector about how
exactly the FCA will work, especially in areas where the FCA has
an extended remit compared with what the FSA was tasked to do,”
Ian Michael of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of England
and  Wales , said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
