Gleacher & Co. (GLCH) , the brokerage that
closed its fixed-income business, should fire Chief Executive
Officer Thomas Hughes, according to private-equity firm
MatlinPatterson Global Advisers LLC.  Hughes, 55, should be replaced along with Chief Operating
Officer John Griff for the brokerage’s “disappointing
results,” MatlinPatterson said today in a regulatory filing.
The New York-based private-equity firm, which owns about 29
percent of Gleacher, said the company should wind down, pursue a
merger or sale, or reinvest assets in a more promising venture.
Hughes and Griff didn’t immediately respond to messages seeking
comment.  Activist shareholder Clinton Group Inc., part of a
coalition with a 7.7 percent stake in the brokerage, said in a
regulatory filing last month that Gleacher should seek a “rapid
rebirth” as an asset manager. The two investment firms
nominated competing slates of directors ahead of Gleacher’s
annual meeting, scheduled for May 23.  Gleacher said April 10 that it’s closing the fixed-income
business, which generated most of the New York-based company’s
revenue, as salesmen defected and customers suspended trading.
The brokerage was in talks to combine with Sterne Agee Group
Inc., people familiar with the matter said at the time.
Gleacher’s stock, which has dropped 62 percent in the past two
years, was little changed today at 71 cents a share.  To contact the reporters on this story:
