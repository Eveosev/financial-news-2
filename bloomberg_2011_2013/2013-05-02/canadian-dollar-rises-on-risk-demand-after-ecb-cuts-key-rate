The Canadian dollar fell against its
U.S. counterpart after Stephen Poloz, head of the nation’s
export-financing agency, was named to lead the Bank of  Canada 
amid concern he may be more amenable to easier monetary policy
than the official he will succeed.  The currency strengthened earlier versus most of its major
counterparts as stimulus measures by the  European Central Bank 
and  Federal Reserve  boosted demand for higher-yielding
currencies and stocks and commodities rose. Canada’s central
bank announced Poloz’s appointment, effective June 3, in a
statement today from Ottawa.  “The consensus view on the street is that he’s probably a
pretty dovish candidate that will probably lead to easier
monetary policy than we otherwise would have expected,” Jamie Price, director of fixed income at Macquarie Private Wealth in
Toronto, said in an interview.  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is known for the image
of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, declined 0.2 percent to
C$1.0105 per  U.S. dollar  at 5 p.m. in Toronto. It gained earlier
as much as 0.2 percent to C$1.0060. The loonie reached a 10-week
high of C$1.0052 yesterday. One Canadian dollar buys 98.95 U.S.
cents.  The Canadian currency slid 0.7 percent versus the euro to
C$1.3198.  Poloz will succeed  Mark Carney , who’s scheduled to depart
June 1 and take over as  Bank of England  Governor a month later.  Resisted Joining  Canada’s central bank has resisted joining Group of Seven
peers in taking extraordinary measures to stimulate expansion,
even amid the slowest six months of  growth  since the 2009
recession.  Canadian government bond yields of 1.41 percent compared
with those of G-7 peers that average 0.92 percent, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. The yield gap has
averaged about 52 basis points, or 0.52 percentage points, over
the past year.  The ECB cut its  key rate  to a record low 0.5 percent today,
a day after the Fed said it will boost bond buying under
quantitative easing if needed. The  Bank of Canada ’s benchmark
rate is 1 percent.  Canada’s benchmark 10-year government bonds rose today,
with  yields  falling one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point,
to 1.67 percent, the lowest level since July. The 1.5 percent
security maturing in June 2023 gained 8 cents to C$98.43.  Oil Gains  Crude oil, the country’s largest export, rose 3.3 percent
to $94.03 per barrel, and Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of raw
materials climbed 1.9 percent. The S&P TSX benchmark gained
58.35 points to 12,379.64.  Poloz, 57, is chief executive officer of  Export Development
Canada , a government trade financing agency. He joined EDC in
1999 as chief economist after three years with Bank Credit
Analyst Research in  Montreal  and 14 years at the Bank of Canada
in roles that included head of the research department.  Policy makers in the world’s 11th largest economy are
grappling with a strong currency and sluggish global demand that
are hampering exports, record consumer-debt loads that are
curbing spending and inflation below the central bank’s 2
percent target.  The Canadian dollar has risen 0.4 percent this year against
nine other developed-nation currencies tracked by the Bloomberg
Correlation Weighted Index. The greenback has gained 2.5 percent
and the euro has added 1.3 percent, while the yen has tumbled
10.5 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
