Beazer Homes USA Inc. (BZH) , an Atlanta-
based builder, rose the most in almost 15 months after reporting
a narrower quarterly loss and saying it expects to become
profitable in the second half of the fiscal year.  Beazer had a loss from continuing operations of $19.1
million, or 78 cents a share, for the second quarter ended March
31, compared with a loss of $37.9 million, or $2.41, a year
earlier, the company said in a statement today. It should have a
profit in the fiscal fourth quarter, Chief Executive Officer
Allan Merrill said.  “Management’s profitability forecast is an unexpected
positive catalyst,” Jay McCanless, an analyst with Sterne Agee
& Leach Inc., wrote in a note today. McCanless, who  rates  Beazer
buy, raised his price target by $1 to $22 after the report.  Beazer rose 10 percent to $18.52, the biggest advance since
Feb. 3, 2012. The stock has gained 9.7 percent this year.  Demand for new homes has been growing as buyers seeking to
take advantage of low  mortgage  rates find a tight  supply  of
existing homes for sale. New homes sold at an annual pace of
417,000 in March, capping the strongest first quarter since
2008, the Commerce Department reported April 23.  “With a substantially higher backlog, improving margins
and tight control of fixed costs, we expect to report positive
net income for our fiscal fourth quarter, which should allow us
to be profitable for the second half of fiscal 2013,” Merrill
said in the statement.  The 11-member Standard & Poor’s Supercomposite Homebuilding
Index, which doesn’t include Beazer, rose 3.5 percent today and
has gained 18 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
