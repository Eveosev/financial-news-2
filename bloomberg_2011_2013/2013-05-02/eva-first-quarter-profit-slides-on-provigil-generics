Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) ’s
first-quarter profit fell 26 percent as a branded drug lost
patent protection and opportunities diminished to introduce new
generic medicines.  Earnings excluding some costs declined to $960 million, or
$1.12 a share, from $1.3 billion, or $1.47, a year earlier, the
Petach Tikva, Israel-based company said in a statement today.
Profit beat the average estimate of $1.11 a share from 20
analysts  surveyed  by Bloomberg.  Teva’s branded-drug sales dropped as Provigil, a sleep-
disorder medicine it got in the $6.5 billion acquisition of
Cephalon Inc. in 2011, lost patent protection last year. Sales
of generics were higher in last year’s first quarter as Teva
began selling seven new products and benefited from a
partnership with Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. for copies of Pfizer
Inc.’s Lipitor.  Revenue from Copaxone, the branded multiple-sclerosis
treatment that is Teva’s best-selling product, increased 17
percent in the quarter to $1.1 billion as Teva boosted the price
of the injection. Copaxone faces new competition from Biogen
Idec Inc.’s Tecfidera, which grabbed an 8 percent share of the
MS pill market in the week ended April 19, according to
Bloomberg Industries.  Feedback from doctors suggests some Tecfidera patients are
switching from Copaxone, according to Marko Kozul, an analyst
with Leerink Swann & Co.  Levin’s Forecast  Chief Executive Officer Jeremy Levin said in November that
revenue this year will be between $19.5 billion and $20.5
billion while earnings excluding some costs will be $4.85 to
$5.15 a share. With no immediate replacement for the expected
decline in Copaxone revenue as competition from oral drugs
increases, Levin has pledged to cut as much as $2 billion of
costs in the next five years.  Teva shares fell 0.5 percent to 136.50 shekels at 2 p.m. in
 Tel Aviv , when trading was halted for the announcement. The
stock touched a 19-month low today. The more actively traded
American depositary receipts have lost 14 percent in the past
year including reinvested dividends,  compared with  a 32 percent
return for the Bloomberg  Europe  Pharmaceutical Index.  Sales dropped 3.9 percent to $4.9 billion, beating the
average estimate of $4.86 billion. Revenue from generic drugs in
the U.S. fell 27 percent to $895 million. In Europe, generic
sales rose 9 percent to $873 million.  Teva will hold a conference call with analysts at 8 a.m.
