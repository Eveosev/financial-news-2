SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. (SNC) ,  Canada ’s
biggest engineering company, said first-quarter profit fell 19
percent as it booked provisions on two contracts.  Net income declined to C$53.6 million ($53.2 million), or
35 cents a share, from C$66.3 million, or 44 cents, a year
earlier, Montreal-based SNC-Lavalin said today in a statement.
Revenue rose 6.3 percent to C$1.9 billion, in line with the
average estimate in a Bloomberg survey of five analysts.  Chief Executive Officer Robert Card is trying to reshape
the company after a corruption scandal involving his predecessor
that led to a fraud investigation and investor lawsuits. Under
Card, who took over Oct. 1, SNC-Lavalin has hired a compliance
officer, appointed a new chief financial officer, and a
president for the company’s newly created resources and
environment unit.  Results in the quarter include C$32 million in additional
costs from an undisclosed infrastructure project, as well as
C$17 million in provisions for costs in connection with a mining
contract that was suspended, SNC-Lavalin said. The provisions
led to operating losses in two of the company’s units:
infrastructure and environment, and mining and metallurgy.  SNC-Lavalin fell less than 1 percent to C$43.45 in Toronto
yesterday. The  stock  has gained 7.8 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
