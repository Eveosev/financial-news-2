Arabtec Holding Co. (ARTC) , the company
building a branch of the Louvre in  Abu Dhabi , said first-quarter
profit dropped 26 percent as costs increased.  Net income  fell  to 62.5 million dirhams ($17 million), or 4
fils a share, from 84.1 million dirhams, 5 fils, the company
said today in a stock exchange statement. Direct costs surged 25
percent to 1.35 billion dirhams, wiping out a 20 percent jump in
revenue to 1.55 billion dirhams.  Arabtec, which helped build the world’s tallest tower in
Dubai, in February replaced its management and said it plans to
more than double its market value. The Dubai-based company said
it’s planning to raise 6.4 billion dirhams through bond and
share sales to bolster its oil-and-gas installation business and
expand in affordable housing.  The construction company’s backlog grew to 20.4 billion
dirhams at the end of the first-quarter, from 19.7 billion a
year earlier. Arabtec formed a venture with  South Korea ’s
Samsung Engineering Co. last month to further expand its oil and
gas business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
