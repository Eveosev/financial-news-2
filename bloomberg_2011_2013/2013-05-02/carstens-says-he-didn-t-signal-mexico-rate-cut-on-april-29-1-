Mexico ’s central bank Governor Agustin Carstens said he was misunderstood by investors who earlier this
week interpreted his comments on interest rates as a sign policy
makers may cut borrowing costs in the second half of the year.  “The market, or the interpretation that was given to my
comment, was that I was in some way prejudging a movement on
interest rates,” Carstens told reporters today in Mexico City.
“That wasn’t my intention.”  Carstens told Radio Formula on April 29 that policy makers
may consider reducing borrowing costs if the annual inflation
rate falls below 4 percent from 4.72 percent in early April. The
peso weakened after that statement, and fixed-rate government
peso bond yields plunged to record lows the next day. Today, the
peso rose as much as 0.3 percent after Carstens said policy
makers aren’t indicating any bias on future  interest rate  moves,
and strengthened 0.2 percent as of 2:47 p.m. in Mexico City to
12.1779 per dollar.  After cutting its benchmark interest rate in March for the
first time since 2009, the central bank kept the overnight rate
unchanged at 4 percent on April 26. Policy makers’ statement
accompanying last month’s decision made no direct mention of a
possible rate move.  The market will keep pricing in a rate cut for the second
half of the year, even after Carstens’ comments, said Alejandro
Padilla, a strategist at Grupo Financiero Banorte SAB.  Adverse weather conditions and other factors that pushed
inflation above the central bank’s target range are expected to
be temporary, Carstens said in the April 29 Radio Formula
interview. He also said that day that inflation should slow to
within the 2 percent to 4 percent target range in the second
half of the year.
