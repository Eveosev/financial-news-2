Deyaar Development PJSC advanced to
the highest level in more than eight months after the property
developer said a recovery in Dubai’s real-estate industry helped
first-quarter profit more than double.  The  shares surged  4 percent to 39.5 fils, the highest since
Aug. 23, at the close in the emirate. About 118 million shares
were traded, eight times the three-month daily average,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The benchmark  DFM
General Index (DFMGI)  retreated 0.4 percent.  Dubai’s real-estate industry is recovering from the global
financial crisis, which drove down prices more than 60 percent
and brought the emirate to the brink of a default in 2009.
Deyaar’s profit rose to 19.4 million dirhams ($5.3 million) from
9.4 million a year earlier, while revenue advanced 36 percent to
204 million dirhams.  The stock’s  14-day relative strength index  rose to 70
today. A reading above that level indicates to some analysts
that a security or index is poised to decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
