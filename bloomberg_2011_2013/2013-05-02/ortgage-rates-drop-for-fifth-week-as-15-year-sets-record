Mortgage rates  in the U.S. fell for a
fifth week, with costs for a 15-year loan reaching a record low,
adding support for housing demand as  home prices  climb.  The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage dropped to
3.35 percent in the week ended today from 3.40 percent, McLean,
Virginia-based  Freddie Mac (FMCC)  said in a statement. The average 15-
year rate decreased to 2.56 percent from 2.61 percent.  Low home-loan rates are fueling demand for home purchases,
helping to boost prices as the  inventory  of properties for sale
is close to the lowest in a decade. Residential real estate
values rose in February by the most since May 2006, the
S&P/Case-Shiller  index  of 20 U.S. cities showed this week.  “Low rates have certainly created demand in the
marketplace, but there is not enough supply,” said  Keith Gumbinger , vice president of HSH.com, a Riverdale, New Jersey-
based mortgage-information website. “The low interest rate
environment is likely to persist for some time yet.”  The Case-Shiller index jumped 9.3 percent from February
2012, more than economists forecast, after advancing 8.1 percent
in the year ended in January. Compared with the prior month,
prices in February rose the most since 2005.  The record rate for a 30-year mortgage is 3.31 percent,
reached in November, according to  Freddie Mac .  To contact the reporter on this story:
