CME Group Inc. (CME) , the world’s largest
futures market, said first-quarter profit fell 12 percent as
lower non-operating revenue and fees per contract cut sales.  Net income dropped to $235.8 million, or 71 cents a share,
from $266.6 million, or 80 cents a share, a year earlier,
Chicago-based CME said today in a statement distributed by PR
Newswire. Excluding a $12 million expense from foreign exchange
losses, the company said it earned 73 cents a share, matching
the average estimate of 19 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  CME Group received on average 78.5 cents per contract,
below the forecast of 79.7 cents per contract expected by Rich
Repetto, an analyst with Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP in  New
York . The year-ago figure was 81.1 cents per contract, according
to the company. There were also two fewer trading days in the
first quarter compared to the year-earlier period, Repetto said,
which can cut revenue by 3 percent.  “They’ve seen a trend in lower screen counts and lower
demand” for non-transaction services like the revenue it
generates by selling data and information services, Repetto said
yesterday before the results were released.  Revenue fell 7.2 percent to $718.6 million last quarter,
from $774.6 million a year ago, the company said.  Revenue from selling market data and information services
fell 29 percent to $80.9 million in the quarter from $114.2
million a year ago, CME Group said.  About 12.5 million contracts changed hands per day during
the period on CME Group’s markets, which offer futures based on
 interest rates , equity indexes, commodities and energy products.
That was up 1 percent from the year earlier average of 12.3
million per day, the company said last month.  CME Group  shares  have risen 18.7 percent this year through
yesterday. They fell 1.2 percent to $60.13 yesterday in New
York.  (CME Group will hold a conference call for analysts and
