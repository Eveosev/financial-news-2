Poland ’s bond yields fell to a record
on speculation today’s interest-rate cut by the  European Central
Bank  and local manufacturing plunging to a 3 1/2-year low will
put pressure on the nation’s policy makers to further cut rates.  Yields on the government’s 10-year bonds dropped 11 basis
points, or 0.11 percentage point, to 3.15 percent at 4:37 p.m.
in Warsaw, after slumping 68 basis points in April, the most
since November 2008. The zloty gained 0.6 percent, the most in
four weeks, to 4.1390 against the euro.  The ECB cuts its main refinancing rate by 25 basis points
to a record 0.5 percent. Poland’s central bank kept its rates
unchanged at 3.25 percent, also a record low, in April after
reducing them by 150 basis points between November and March.
The policy makers will announce the rates decision on May 8.  “The cut by the ECB may be viewed by rate council members
as a signal that exterior conditions have weakened more than
thought,” Pawel Radwanski, a fixed-income analyst at Raiffeisen
Bank Polska, said by phone.  Poland’s manufacturing PMI slumped to 46.9 in April, the
lowest level since July 2009 and below the 47.8 median-estimate
of 21 economists in a Bloomberg survey. The data “will keep up
pressure for further interest rate cuts,”  Agata Urbanska , an
economist at HSBC Holdings Plc, said in the PMI report.  The Polish central bank will cut rates by 25 basis points
in May, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and  Capital Economics  said in
separate research notes today.  Nine-month forward rate agreements, derivatives used to bet
on interest rate changes, traded 65 basis points below the
Warsaw Interbank Offered Rate, signaling scope exists for almost
three quarter-point rate reductions over the next nine months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
