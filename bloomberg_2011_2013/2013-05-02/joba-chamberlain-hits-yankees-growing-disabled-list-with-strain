Joba Chamberlain becomes the latest
player sidelined by injury for the New York Yankees, as the
relief pitcher was placed on the 15-day disabled list because of
a strained oblique muscle in his right side.  Chamberlain joins shortstop  Derek Jeter , third basemen  Alex Rodriguez  and Kevin Youkilis, first baseman Mark Teixeira,
outfielder Curtis Granderson, catcher Francisco Cervelli and
pitchers Ivan Nova and Michael Pineda on the disabled list.  Chamberlain, a 27-year-old right-hander, hasn’t pitched
since April 27 because of the injury. He has a 3.86 earned run
average and one save in 10 appearances this Major League
Baseball season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
