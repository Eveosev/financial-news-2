Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  sued
Desarrolladora Homex SAB,  Mexico ’s biggest homebuilder by
revenue, seeking $26.7 million over a canceled derivatives
transaction.  Homex owes the payment after the company last month
requested that the 2009 agreement be cancelled and Credit Suisse
agreed, the Swiss bank said in a complaint filed today in  New
York  State Supreme Court in Manhattan.  “Homex breached, and continues to breach, its contractual
obligations under the master agreement,” Credit Suisse said in
the filing.  Homex and peers in the Mexican homebuilding industry have
struggled to prevent declines in their cash reserves as the
government shifts subsidies to promote more capital-intensive
apartment construction in cities, instead of individual homes in
commuter towns.  Marena Rubio, a Homex press official, didn’t respond to an
e-mail seeking comment on the case. Phone calls to her office
went unanswered.  Urbi Desarrollos Urbanos SAB, the biggest Mexican builder
by the number of homes, was sued in the same court last month by
Credit Suisse and Barclays Plc, Britain’s second-biggest lender,
over financial derivatives.  Homex shares traded in Mexico rose 0.84 pesos to 10.73
pesos. Its shares traded in the U.S. rose 29 cents, or about 5.8
percent, to $5.26. Homex bonds due in 2020 fell 2.64 cents to
58.35 cents on the dollar at 4:05 p.m. in New York, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The yield rose 1.07 percentage
points to 21.64 percent.  The case is Credit Suisse AG v. Desarrolladora Homex SA,
651581-2013, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
