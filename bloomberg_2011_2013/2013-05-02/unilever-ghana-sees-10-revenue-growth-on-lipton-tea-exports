Unilever  Ghana  Ltd. expects sales to
grow by 10 percent in 2013 as the food and household-goods maker
starts making Lipton Tea in Ghana for export into French-
speaking Western African countries.  The locally-processed tea “will no doubt improve our top
line in terms of sales as well as profitability,” Managing
Director David Mureithi said in an interview last week in the
port city of Tema, where the company is based, 30 kilometers (19
miles) from the capital, Accra.  “Our forecast is to reach a turnover of 310 million
cedis” ($157 million) in 2013, Mureithi said. Sales in the
first quarter declined 1 percent to 75.8 million cedis, the
company said on April 29. In 2012, revenue was 282 million
cedis.  The Ghananian unit is part of London and Rotterdam-based
 Unilever NV (UNA) ’s push into  developing countries , which it expects
account for 90 percent of annual sales growth over the next
decade. The company said on April 30 it would spend as much as
292.2 billion rupees ($5.4 billion) increasing a majority stake
in its Indian unit as it seeks to generate more emerging-market
profit.  “Pressure on consumer purchasing power” has weighed on
Unilever’s sales growth in Ghana after the government cut
subsidies on gasoline and utilities to help narrow the  budget
deficit , Mureithi said. The managing director said last month he
would leave the company on May 1 to pursue other interests.  Weakening Cedi  Unilever Ghana shares have advanced 58 percent this year,
compared with a 50 percent gain on the Ghana Stock Exchange
Composite Index. It is valued at 843 million cedis.  The company, which also  makes  Lux soap and Blue Brand
spread, reported a 44 percent fall in net income last year after
a weakening cedi caused input costs to soar. The cedi declined
14 percent in 2012 and is down 3.6 percent this year, the worst
performer in West Africa, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It rose for the first time in four days to 1.97 per
dollar by 3:58 p.m. in Accra on April 30. Markets were closed
for a public holiday yesterday.  Ghana’s economic growth has boosted demand for dollars in
the country, pushing the cedi lower as the current account
deficit widened to $4.9 billion in 2012 from $3.5 billion in
2011, according to the  finance ministry .  Unilever Ghana has invested 7.5 million cedis in the tea
factory, the first to be built in the world’s second-biggest
cocoa producer. It will process as much as 1,000 tons of Lipton
tea a year for sale in countries including Mali,  Burkina Faso ,
 Benin  and  Ivory Coast , Mureithi said.  The plant will process raw tea mainly imported from  Kenya 
and Sri Lanka. “This is expected to reduce the cost of
producing tea by 15 percent” because of lower tax and custom
charges, Mureithi said. Pre-packaged tea would be bulkier and
therefore more expensive to transport.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
