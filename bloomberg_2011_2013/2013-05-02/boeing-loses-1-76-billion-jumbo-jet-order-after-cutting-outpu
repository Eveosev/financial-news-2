Boeing Co. (BA)  lost an order of five 747-8
jumbo-jet freighters with a value of $1.76 billion less than a
month after cutting production of the plane because of flagging
demand for its biggest, most-expensive model.  Boeing reached an agreement with Dubai Aerospace Enterprise
Ltd. to cancel the order,  Jim Proulx , a spokesman for the
Chicago-based planemaker, said today. DAE still has an order for
five twin-engine 777 cargo jets, said Proulx, who declined to
comment on the prospects of that purchase.  DAE’s pullback leaves Chicago-based Boeing with 54 unfilled
orders for the 747-8, the four-engine plane with the iconic
humpbacked fuselage. The monthly output is being reduced to 1.75
planes from two starting in early 2014 amid weakness in air-
freight shipments, Boeing said on April 19.  Delays and cost overruns have plagued the upgraded version
of the 747, which made longer airline routes possible in the
1970s because of its size and range. The 747-8 freighter went
into service in October 2011, almost six years after the first
order for the plane. Boeing booked writedowns of $1.35 billion
in 2009 and $685 million in 2008 related to costs for the
plane’s development and production, according to  filings .  The 747-8 freighter has a selling price of $352 million and
the passenger version, known as the Intercontinental, costs
$351.4 million, according to Boeing’s website. Of the planes
pending delivery, 28 are freighters and 26 are passenger jets.  Fuel Costs  Boeing has had more success with its wide-body 777
aircraft, which features a twin-engine design that saves
maintenance and fuel costs. Boeing said yesterday it’s offering
an upgraded version of the 777 to customers and expects the new
plane to be in service by the end of this decade.  The loss of 747 orders isn’t a surprise after Boeing
reduced production and cited weakness in the cargo market, said
 Michael Derchin , an CRT Capital Group analyst based in  Stamford ,
 Connecticut . The passenger version of the four-engine plane
hasn’t caught on with airlines, which are looking to cut fuel
costs, he said.  “The market for it is limited. It’s primarily a cargo
carrier,” Derchin said in an interview. “You don’t see too
many four-engine airplanes with jet fuel north of $3 per
gallon.”  DAE has been canceling purchases after ordering 200 planes
from Boeing and rival Airbus SAS at the Dubai air show in 2007.
DAE has since canceled all its Airbus orders. Telephone calls
made to DAE went unanswered.  Financial Crisis  DAE was set up in 2006 with the goal of becoming the
world’s largest airplane lessor. The global financial crisis in
2008 and 2009 disrupted those plans. The company reported 2011
net income of $121.7 million, up from $10.3 million a year
earlier, on revenue of $1.8 billion, according to a statement.  Boeing said in a February filing that the 747 has “a
number of unsold freighter and Intercontinental production
positions beyond 2013.” Orders for the plane will pick up when
freight demand does, Jim McNerney, Boeing’s chief executive
officer, said on an April 24 conference call.  “As the only provider of very large freighters, we believe
our fuel-efficient 747-8 is well positioned to benefit our
customers once cargo market conditions improve,” McNerney said.  The company has received an order for three planes this
year after getting two orders for a total of seven jets in 2012.  Air freight volume  dropped  1.1 percent in the first three
months this year from a year earlier, led by a 4.6 percent
decline in Asia Pacific international cargo, according to the
 International Air Transport Association .  Shares of Boeing  rose  1.1 percent to $92.21 at the close in
 New York . The stock has gained 22 percent this year, outpacing
the 12 percent advance for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
