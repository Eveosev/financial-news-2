Australia ’s government bonds rose,
sending 10-year yields to the lowest in more than five months as
stocks declined on concern the global economy is slowing.  The so-called Aussie remained lower before data forecast to
show manufacturing contracted in  Germany  and expanded at a
weaker pace in  China . New Zealand’s dollar declined for a third
day against the yen after Auckland-based Fonterra Cooperative
Group Ltd., the world’s largest dairy producer, said whole milk
powder prices fell for the first time this year.  The  bond market  is “reacting to the weak headline global
growth numbers and the outlook for RBA policy in the near
term,” said  Andrew Salter , a Sydney-based foreign-exchange
strategist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.
“Germany has weakened more than most in the market anticipated.
To the extent that we do get a confirmation of that weakness, I
think we should see risk taken off the table.”  The  yield  on Australia’s 10-year bonds fell eight basis
points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 3.02 percent, a level
unseen since Nov. 16. The three-year rate touched 2.53 percent,
the lowest since Nov. 19.  The Australian dollar touched $1.0250 and declined 0.2
percent to $1.0256 as of 11:16 a.m. in Sydney from yesterday,
when it dropped 0.9 percent. It lost 0.2 percent to 99.86 yen.  New Zealand ’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, traded at 84.91
U.S. cents from 84.99 yesterday, when it weakened 0.8 percent.
The currency slid 0.1 percent to 82.69 yen, having fallen 1.2
percent in the previous two sessions.  The MSCI World Index of stocks declined 0.7 percent
yesterday, while the Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB  index  of raw
materials dropped 1.7 percent.  Global Growth  The  Purchasing Managers’ Index (EC11CHPM)  of Chinese manufacturing
probably fell to 50.5 in April from 51.6 the previous month,
according to the median estimate of economists surveyed by
 Bloomberg News  before HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics
release the data today.  A government report yesterday  showed  Chinese manufacturing
expanding at a slower pace last month. China is the biggest
trading partner for both Australia and New Zealand.  Economists in a separate Bloomberg poll  estimate  the final
reading of a factory index in Germany remained at 47.9 in April,
below the 50 level and indicating contraction. Markit Economics
will release its figures today.  Milk powder for July delivery declined 4.8 percent,
according to a trade-weighted index on Fonterra’s
GlobalDairyTrade website. It was the first fall since Dec. 18.
The near-term contract for New Zealand product fell to $6,001 a
metric ton from a record $6,283 on April 16.  Australia’s Bureau of Statistics will report on the number
of building approvals in March today.  Interest-rate swaps  data compiled by Bloomberg show traders
see a 43 percent chance the  Reserve Bank  of Australia will lower
its benchmark to 2.75 percent at the next meeting on May 7.  To contact the reporters on this story:
