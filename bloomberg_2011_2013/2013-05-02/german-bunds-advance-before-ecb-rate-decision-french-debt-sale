European government bonds rallied
after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi signaled
officials will consider charging lenders to park excess cash
with the central bank overnight in a bid to boost the economy.  Germany ’s two-year note yields fell below zero while those
on  10-year bunds  dropped to the lowest level since July after
the ECB cut its benchmark interest rate to a record 0.5 percent
and Draghi said another decrease is possible. The rates on
French, Finnish and Belgian 10-year debt slid to all-time lows
and Spanish bonds climbed after the ECB President said monetary
policy will remain accommodative for as long as needed. Euribor
futures rose as investors raised bets on lower borrowing costs.  “Draghi hinted that the ECB is ready to act more
aggressively if needed,” said Alessandro Giansanti, a senior
rates strategist at ING Groep NV in Amsterdam. “The ample
liquidity in the market will be supportive for lower core
yields” referring to the euro area’s higher-rated securities.  German two-year  yields fell five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to minus 0.031 percent at 4:35 p.m.  London 
time, after reaching minus 0.036 percent, the lowest since April
2. The 0.25 percent security maturing in March 2015 rose 0.085,
or 85 euro cents per 1,000-euro ($1,305) face amount, to 100.52.  The yield on similar-maturity Finnish notes dropped as much
as seven basis points to minus 0.02 percent, the least since
Dec. 12. A negative yield means investors who hold the security
until it matures will receive less than they paid to buy it.  Unprecedented Step  “We will look at all the incoming data and stand ready to
act if needed,” Draghi told reporters at a press conference in
the Slovakian capital, Bratislava, after the ECB lowered its key
rate by 25 basis points. Asked if further action may include the
unprecedented step of taking the deposit rate negative from
zero, he said: “We will look at this with an open mind.”  German 10-year yields slid four basis points to 1.17
percent, after reaching 1.15 percent, the  lowest  level since
July 23.  French (GFRN10)  10-year yields dropped to 1.659 percent, the
least since Bloomberg began compiling the data in 1990. The rate
on similar-maturity Belgian bonds slipped to 1.913 percent.  The implied yield on the Euribor futures contract expiring
in June 2014 fell four basis points to 0.22 percent.  Draghi also said the ECB will continue to lend banks as
much money as they require at least until mid-2014. The
Frankfurt-based central bank has also started to consult with
European institutions to improve the flow of credit to companies
using collateralized loans, he said.  ‘Dovish Message’  “The main point to take home here is the dovish message on
the economy, on liquidity and the willingness to support risky
assets going forward,” said Gianluca Ziglio, executive director
of fixed-income research at Sunrise Brokers LLP in London.
“Discussing the possibility of a cut in the deposit rate has
broken a taboo.”  Spanish 10-year yields dropped as much as nine basis points
to 4.05 percent, while the rate on similar-maturity  Italian (GBTPGR10) 
securities fell up to 13 basis points to 3.78 percent, both the
lowest since October 2010.  Volatility on Greek bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today followed by those of Finland and Spain, according
to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between two- and
10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  German government bonds returned 1.1 percent this year
through yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg
and the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.
French bonds gained 1.7 percent, while Spanish securities earned
8.2 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
