International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) 
obtained a record-low 1.625 percent coupon on seven-year dollar-
denominated debt and tied an all-time low for three-year
securities.  IBM’s $1.25 billion of notes due May 2020, which yield 67
basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, beat a 1.65
percent rate on $750 million of debt sold last July by
semiconductor maker Texas Instruments Inc., according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The largest computer-services provider also sold $1 billion
of notes due in 2016 at a 0.45 percent coupon, matching a
record-low for that maturity obtained by Apple Inc., Texas
Instruments, Unilever Plc and Walt Disney Co., Bloomberg data
show. The debt pays a relative yield of 25 basis points.  The bonds may be rated Aa3 by Moody’s Investors Service,
according to a person familiar with the transaction, who asked
not to be identified citing lack of authorization to speak
publicly.  IBM, based in Armonk,  New York , last sold debt in February,
issuing $1 billion each of two-year, floating-rate notes and
1.25 percent, five-year securities, Bloomberg data show.  Bank of America Corp., BNP Paribas SA, Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc and  Wells Fargo & Co . managed today’s
offering.  To contact the reporter on this story:
