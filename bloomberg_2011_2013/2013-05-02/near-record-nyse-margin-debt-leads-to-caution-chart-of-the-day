Borrowing to buy U.S. stocks is close
enough to a record to cause concern that prices may not rise
much longer, according to Cullen Roche, founder of Orcam
Financial Group LLC.  The CHART OF THE DAY compares the total amount of margin
debt at  New York  Stock Exchange member firms, according to data
compiled by the exchange, with the performance of the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index.  Margin debt amounted to $379.5 billion in March, the latest
month available. The total was the second-highest in the history
of the NYSE’s figures, going back to 1959. The highest was the
$381.4 billion recorded in July 2007.  “It’s rather alarming to see NYSE margin debt just shy of
its all-time high,” Roche wrote yesterday in a posting on his
Pragmatic Capitalism blog. The borrowing points to “a fragile
foundation” for the current advance in stocks, he wrote.  The 2007 record was set three months before the end of a
five-year bull market, which sent the S&P 500 to an all-time
high. The index surpassed its peak five weeks ago, after more
than doubling from its March 2009 low, and later closed as much
as 2.1 percent higher.  Investors owed $92.2 billion in March after subtracting
credit balances in cash and margin accounts, according to the
NYSE’s data. Holders of cash accounts have to pay the entire
purchase price for stocks up front, while those with margin
accounts can borrow as much as 50 percent of the price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
