 An Icelandic court ruled that a
former executive of failed lender  Kaupthing Bank hf  must repay
loans given to him by the lender to buy its shares.  Ingolfur Helgason, the ex-head of Kaupthing’s Icelandic
operations, is personally liable for the 1.1 billion-krona ($9.5
million) loan the bank extended to him for purchases, according
to the ruling announced today by the Reykjavik District Court.  Less than two weeks before Kaupthing’s failure in October
2008, its board sought to revoke personal liability on loans
given to a number of employees in connection with purchasing
stock in the bank. The decision followed a drop in the lender’s
share price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
