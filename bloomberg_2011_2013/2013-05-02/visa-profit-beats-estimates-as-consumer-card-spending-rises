Visa Inc. (V) , the biggest payments
network, posted a fiscal second-quarter profit that beat
analysts’ estimates as spending on credit and debit cards rose.  Net income  for the three months ended March 31 fell 1.7
percent to $1.27 billion, or $1.92 a share, from $1.29 billion,
or $1.91, a year earlier, when there were more shares
outstanding, the Foster City, California-based company said
yesterday in a statement. That beat the $1.81 average estimate
of 32 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Net income a year earlier
was helped by a one-time tax-related gain of $208 million.  Visa, led by Chief Executive Officer  Charlie Scharf ,
increased  dividends  and stepped up share repurchases as the firm
gained financial flexibility after joining rival  MasterCard Inc. (MA) 
in agreeing to a multibillion settlement with merchants over
card swipe fees. Visa also struck a deal in February with
JPMorgan Chase & Co., the biggest U.S. card lender, to let the
bank tailor payment solutions for merchants.  “The No. 1 opportunity for us is to move transactions from
cash onto our electronic platform,” Scharf, 48, said on a
conference call with analysts. “The ecosystem is evolving and
we need to evolve as well to make sure that we remain
competitive.”  The payment processor raised its forecast for adjusted
annual earnings per share growth to about 20 percent, from the
“high teens” projected in February.  Shares Advance  Visa rose 2.1 percent to $169.55 in extended trading
yesterday. The shares climbed 9.5 percent this year through the
close of regular trading,  outpacing  the 4.2 percent advance for
the 70-company Standard & Poor’s 500 Information Technology
Index.  MasterCard, the world’s second-largest payments network by
processed transactions, said yesterday that first-quarter profit
increased 12 percent to $766 million. Revenue at the Purchase,
New York-based firm climbed 8.4 percent to $1.91 billion, short
of the $1.93 billion estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg survey.
The stock fell 2.4 percent to $539.82.  Visa’s total operating revenue climbed 15 percent to $2.96
billion, beating the $2.85 billion estimate of analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg.  Worldwide spending on Visa payment cards climbed 8.8
percent to $1.03 trillion, adjusted for currency fluctuations,
according to the statement. Processed transactions rose 6.2
percent to 13.9 billion. Cross-border volume, a measure of
spending by cardholders outside their home countries, advanced
10 percent.  Spending on Visa debit cards in the U.S. rose 0.3 percent
to $285 billion, the first increase in a year, according to the
statement. U.S. credit-card purchases climbed 9.1 percent to
$244 billion.  U.S. consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent
of the nation’s economy, cooled in March after higher payroll
taxes took effect in January. Scharf seeks to bolster Visa’s
growth outside the U.S. as the company has said it hopes to get
more than half of its revenue abroad by 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
