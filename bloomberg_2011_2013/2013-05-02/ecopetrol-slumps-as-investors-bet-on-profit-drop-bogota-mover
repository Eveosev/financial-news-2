Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL) , Colombia’s state-
controlled oil company, fell the most in two weeks as analysts
forecast a fourth straight decline in quarterly profit.  Shares slid 1.9 percent to 4,305 pesos at 1:41 p.m. in
Bogota and earlier fell as much as 2.6 percent, the steepest
intraday decline April 15. The shares have lost 21 percent since
Ecopetrol reported on Feb. 15 that fourth-quarter net income
decreased 18 percent.  The company based in Bogota will report a 6.5 percent
decline in first-quarter profit from a year earlier to 3.99
trillion pesos, according to the average of five estimates in a
Bloomberg survey. That would be the fourth straight year-on-year
quarterly drop.  “It’s an exit of investors who don’t want to be exposed to
the results,” Omar Escorcia, an analyst with Asesores en
Valores SA, said by telephone from Medellin.  Ecopetrol is scheduled to publish first-quarter results
after the close of trading tomorrow.  Petroleo Brasileiro SA,  Brazil ’s state-controlled oil
company, gained as much as 2.7 percent in  Sao Paulo  as crude  oil
prices  climbed for the first time in three days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
