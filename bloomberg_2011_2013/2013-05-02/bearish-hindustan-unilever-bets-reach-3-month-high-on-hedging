 Traders are buying the largest amount
of bearish options on  Hindustan Unilever Ltd. (HUVR)  in three months to
hedge against declines in a stock that surged 17 percent
following a Unilever Plc offer to raise its stake.  The  ratio  of outstanding puts to sell the shares versus
calls to buy was at 1.3 at 11:03 a.m. in Mumbai, the highest
level since January 22, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Open
interest, or the number of outstanding put options contracts on
Hindustan Unilever, was 18,467 today compared with the 20-day
average of 2,346, the data show. There were 14,621 outstanding
call contracts, more than the average of 2,148.  Shares of Mumbai-based Hindustan Unilever, which makes
soaps and detergents, rose 17 percent on April 30 after its
parent said it will spend as much as 292.2 billion rupees ($5.4
billion) to lift its majority stake. The put-call ratio for  ITC
Ltd. (ITC) , a rival of Hindustan Unilever, was 1.05.  “Traders are buying puts to hedge against their bullish
stance on the stock and its futures contracts,” Manoj Murlidharan, vice president at Mumbai-based  India Infoline Ltd. (IIFL) ,
said in a phone interview today. “The stock is likely to get
support at 550 rupees.”  Hindustan Unilever lost 1.3 percent to 576.1 rupees today.
May call options with a strike price of 600 rupees and put
options with a 560-rupee strike have the largest ownership among
bullish and bearish contracts, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Puts give the right to sell a security for a certain
amount, called the strike price, by a given date. Calls convey
the right to buy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
