Centaurus Capital Ltd., a London-based
hedge-fund manager that bets on corporate takeovers, is
returning money to clients to allow it to make investments
without seeking the support of its outside backers.  “We are keen for the investment flexibility that running
our own money will deliver,” Randel Freeman, Centaurus’ chief
investment officer, said in a statement today. “We are
extremely grateful for the support of our investors.”  Centaurus manages less than $500 million, said two people
with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified
because the firm is private. The company was started in 2000 by
former BNP Paribas SA traders Freeman and Bernard Oppetit.  The Centaurus Global Event Opportunities Fund gained 4.2
percent through March of this year after rising 11 percent in
2012, the people said.  Other event-driven hedge funds , which bet on corporate
actions including mergers, bankruptcies and share buy-backs,
advanced 3.9 percent on average in the first quarter and 8.9
percent last year, according to Chicago-based Hedge Fund
Research Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
