Caroline Kennedy, the only surviving
child of the late President  John F. Kennedy , listed for sale
about 90 acres of land in  Martha’s Vineyard , a resort island off
the Massachusetts coast.  Two waterfront parcels in the town of Aquinnah are on the
market -- a 39.5-acre (16-hectare) property available for $20
million, and a 53.5-acre piece for $25 million, according to the
listings for 6 Red Gate Farm and 8 Red Gate Farm.  “An exclusive waterfront property with incredible views of
Squibnocket Pond, with further views over towering sand dunes to
the Atlantic Ocean,” the listing for 6 Red Gate Farm reads.
“Plenty of privacy with varied topography and easy pond access.
Yours to create a marvelous estate.”  The land is part of a 366-acre stretch that has been
private since Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis bought it in 1978, said
John O’Connell, broker and owner of Vineyard Realty Group in
Edgartown,  Massachusetts .  The property is “a piece of the island that very few
people have seen,” said O’Connell, who isn’t involved in the
sale.  Corporate records for Red Gate Farm LLC, which owns the
land, lists Edwin A. Schlossberg as the person responsible for
the parcels. He is the husband of Caroline Kennedy, who is
expected to be Obama’s choice as the next U.S. ambassador to
 Japan .  To contact the reporter on this story:
