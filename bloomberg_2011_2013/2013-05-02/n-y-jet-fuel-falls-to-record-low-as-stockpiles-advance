Jet fuel weakened to a  record low 
against futures in  New York  Harbor after supplies increased for
a third week and refinery utilization neared a seven-month high.  Stockpiles of jet fuel on the U.S. East Coast, known as
PADD 1, added  480,000 barrels  to 11.2 million in the week ended
April 24, the highest level since Sept. 7, according to U.S.
Energy Information Administration data. Refinery utilization
rates increased to 90 percent, almost a  seven-month high .  No. 54 jet fuel  in the New York Harbor weakened 1 cent to
13.5 cents a gallon below futures on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  at 5:04 p.m., the lowest level since at least 1991,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Reformulated, 84-octane gasoline advanced 0.25 cent to 0.5
cent a gallon under futures.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  weakened
0.62 cent to a premium of 1.38 cents a gallon.  The 3-2-1 crack spread in New York, a rough measure of
refining margins for gasoline and diesel fuel based on West
Texas Intermediate in Cushing,  Oklahoma , dropped 44 cents to
$15.39 a barrel, a second consecutive daily decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
