Petroleo Brasileiro SA,  Brazil ’s
importer of liquefied natural gas, is set to receive a spot
cargo from  Qatar  today, according to ship-tracking data.  The Expedient, with a capacity of about 148,000 cubic
meters, will arrive at  Rio de Janeiro , according to ship
transmissions captured by IHS Fairplay on Bloomberg. The tanker
sailed from Qatar’s Ras Laffan port, where it loaded the
supercooled gas and departed March 9.  Brazil’s driest rainy season in a decade has reduced
hydropower supply, boosting the country’s demand for immediate,
or spot, LNG cargoes, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a January
report. Petrobras, as the Brazilian company is known, has a
floating re-gasification terminal at Guanabara Bay near Rio de
Janeiro.  Qatar’s LNG producers, Qatargas and Rasgas, load cargoes at
Ras Laffan port. Christopher Evans, Qatargas’ Doha-based
spokesman, and a Petrobras official in Houston didn’t reply to
e-mails seeking comment. A Rasgas official in Doha didn’t
respond to a call to his office phone seeking comment.  Brazil doesn’t have long-term LNG supply contracts with
Qatar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Hispania Spirit, with a capacity of around 138,000
cubic meters, made the most recent shipment to the Guanabara Bay
terminal when it delivered a cargo from  Trinidad & Tobago  on
April 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
