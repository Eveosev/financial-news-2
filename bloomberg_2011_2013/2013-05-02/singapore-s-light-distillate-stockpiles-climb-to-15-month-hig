Light-distillate inventories in
 Singapore ,  Asia ’s largest oil-trading and storage center, rose
1.1 percent to the highest level in almost 15 months, according
to a unit of the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore stockpiles including naphtha, gasoline and
reformate gained 133,000 barrels to 11.7 million in the seven
days to yesterday,  International Enterprise Singapore  said today
in an e-mailed statement. Supplies climbed a third week to the
highest since the period ended Feb. 8, 2012.  Stockpiles of  middle distillates  including gasoil, or
diesel, and kerosene rebounded 1.32 million barrels, or 15
percent, to 10.4 million, the ministry’s data showed. Supplies
increased the most since Dec. 5.  Residual-fuel inventories including  fuel oil  and low-sulfur
waxy residue and excluding bitumen gained 2.03 million barrels,
or 12 percent, to 18.5 million barrels, according to the data.
That’s the highest level since March 13.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
