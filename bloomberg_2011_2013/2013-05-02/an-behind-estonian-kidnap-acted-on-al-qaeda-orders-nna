(Corrects date of abduction in first paragraph.)  The mastermind behind the March 2011
abduction of seven Estonians in Lebanon is in police custody and
acted upon orders from al-Qaeda in  Iraq , the official National
News Agency said today.  It said the 30-year-old man was also given orders to kidnap
more foreigners even after the seven were released a few months
later, the agency said, citing a police statement.  The Estonians were captured while cycling in eastern
Lebanon. Two Lebanese soldiers were killed and several were
injured in February when an army unit dispatched to make an
arrest in the case was ambushed by gunmen in the eastern town of
Ersal, according to an army statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
