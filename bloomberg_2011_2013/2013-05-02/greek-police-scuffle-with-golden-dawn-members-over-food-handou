Greek police used tear gas early this
morning against members of the nationalist  Golden Dawn  party in
central  Athens  after the group tried to hand out free food
packages in Syntagma, the city’s main square in front of
parliament.  Anti-immigrant Golden Dawn, which has 18 members in
Greece’s 300-seat parliament, said the food handout for Orthodox
Easter was for Greeks only.  Athens Mayor George Kaminis said yesterday the planned
event represented racist and xenophobic charity and the city
would do whatever necessary to stop it.  To contact the reporter on this story:
