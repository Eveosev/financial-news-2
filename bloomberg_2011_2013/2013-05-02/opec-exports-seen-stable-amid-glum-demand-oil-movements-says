The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will keep shipments little changed this
month as “glum” demand in the U.S. and Europe counters rising
consumption in Asia, tanker tracker Oil Movements said.  The group that supplies about 40 percent of the world’s oil
will ship 23.67 million barrels a day in the four weeks to May
18, stable from 23.68 million in the previous period, the
researcher said today in an e-mailed report. The figures exclude
 Angola  and  Ecuador . U.S. crude imports by tanker have fallen
about 13 percent this year, the consultant said.  “Import demand in the west is dead,”  Roy Mason , the
company’s founder said by phone from Halifax,  England . “If
there’s going to be a ramp-up this summer the demand is going to
have to come from the east.”  Middle East shipments will be little changed at 17.35
million barrels a day in the four weeks to May 18, compared with
17.36 million during the month to April 20, according to Oil
Movements. That figure includes non-OPEC members Oman and Yemen.  Crude on board tankers will average 468.34 million barrels
to May 18, up 0.3 percent from the previous period, data from
Oil Movements show. The researcher calculates the volumes by
tallying tanker bookings. Its figures exclude crude held on
vessels for storage.  OPEC’s members are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar,  Saudi Arabia , the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela. The group will next meet on May 31 in
Vienna to discuss output policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
