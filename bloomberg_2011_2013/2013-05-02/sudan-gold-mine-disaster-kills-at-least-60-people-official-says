A gold mine collapse in  Sudan ’s
western region of Darfur killed at least 60 people and left
potentially dozens more trapped in a shaft 40 meters (130 feet)
deep, a local commissioner said.  Rescue efforts are under way at the informal mine, Haroun
Al-Hussein, a local commissioner in the town of Al-Sireaf in the
Jebel Amer region of North Darfur state, said today by phone.  Sudan is boosting gold production to offset the loss of
three-quarters of its oil ouput when  South Sudan  seceded in July
2011. The country made $2.2 billion from gold exports in 2012,
President Umar al-Bashir told parliament on April 1, and plans
to export about 50 metric tons of the metal this year.  Fighting over gold mining rights in the Jebel Amer region
this year led to what London-based  Amnesty International  called
Darfur’s “worst instance of violence in recent years.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
