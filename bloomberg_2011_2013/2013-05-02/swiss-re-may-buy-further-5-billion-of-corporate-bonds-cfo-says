Swiss Re Ltd. (SREN)  Chief Financial Officer
George Quinn said the world’s second-biggest reinsurer may
invest another $5 billion in corporate debt and infrastructure
this year as it shifts away from low-yielding  government bonds .  Swiss Re shifted $1.7 billion into corporate and
securitized credit and infrastructure in the first quarter, said
Quinn, adding that it doesn’t make sense for the Zurich-based
company to wait for  interest rates  to rise. European Central
Bank President  Mario Draghi  has stoked expectations that
officials will deliver an interest rate cut today.  “We expect to continue the move toward credit in the
coming quarters,” Quinn said in a phone interview today. “If
we do the same every quarter, we’re talking about another $5
billion or so in credit, which is another 3 percent to 4 percent
shift in asset allocation in the remainder of this year away
from government bonds and cash to credit.”  Swiss Re in February reported $1.53 billion in realized
gains after selling government bonds last year. The reinsurer
could add to its $500 million investment in infrastructure debt
announced in November and may “slightly” raise its equity
holdings, Quinn said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
