Japan ’s government bonds rose, pushing
yields on 10-year and 30-year debt to the lowest in almost two
weeks, as stocks fell and the central bank said the monetary
base expanded, increasing speculation more funds will flow into
fixed-income securities.  The Bank of Japan unveiled a plan on April 4 to double the
monetary base, a measure of money in Japan’s economy, in two
years through increased buying of government bonds. The central
bank said today the amount jumped 23 percent last month from a
year earlier, the most in two years, indicating progress toward
the BOJ’s goal.  The yield on the benchmark 10-year note fell three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 0.56 percent as of 3:16
p.m. in  Tokyo , after touching 0.555 percent, the lowest since
April 19, according to Japan Bond Trading Co., the nation’s
largest interdealer debt broker.  Benchmark 10-year bond futures for June delivery rose 0.37
to 145.12 at the 3 p.m. close on the Tokyo Stock Exchange after
earlier touching 145.15, the highest level since April 8. The
30-year yield declined as much as two basis points to 1.56
percent, a level unseen since April 19. The five-year rate
dropped to 0.215 percent, the lowest since April 12.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average dropped 0.8 percent, the
biggest decline since April 18, boosting demand for the relative
safety of government debt.  The BOJ last month increased monthly bond purchases to
exceed 7 trillion yen ($72 billion) at Governor Haruhiko
Kuroda’s first policy meeting in charge. The central bank said
it will bolster bond purchases to double the monetary base --
cash in circulation and the money that financial institutions
have on deposit at the central bank -- by the end of 2014.  To contact the reporters on this story:
