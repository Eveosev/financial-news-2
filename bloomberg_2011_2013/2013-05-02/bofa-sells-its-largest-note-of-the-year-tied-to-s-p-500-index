Bank of America Corp.  sold $108.5
million of five-year structured notes tied to the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index, its largest offering since November.  The securities, issued April 25, yield at least 23.4
percent a year if the benchmark doesn’t fall below its initial
value and protect against 20 percent of losses, according to a
 prospectus  filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. The  Charlotte , North Carolina-based bank distributed
the notes, which it valued at 94.9 cents on the dollar, for a
2.5 percent fee.  Bank of America has sold $1.58 billion of U.S. structured
notes this year in 51 offerings, a decline of 25 percent from
the year-earlier period and its slowest first four months since
2010, according to data that Bloomberg started compiling then.  Its average offering size this year is $30.9 million, the
most of any bank that sells the products in the U.S., Bloomberg
data show. That compares with $820,000 for UBS AG, which has the
smallest average and offers an electronic sales platform to
improve efficiency and cut costs.  Matt Card, a spokesman for the bank, didn’t respond to
phone and e-mail requests for comment on the deal or total
sales.  Bank of America issued $123.9 million of two-year
securities also linked to the  S&P 500  on Nov. 29, its most
recent offering that was larger.  The April note is the second biggest of the year tied to
the S&P 500, Bloomberg data show. Morgan Stanley sold $110
million of 15-year securities linked to the stock benchmark on
Jan. 15, according to a  prospectus  filed with the SEC.  Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts whose
value is derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
or events such as changes in  interest rates  or the weather.  To contact the reporter on this story:
