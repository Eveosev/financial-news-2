The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region against non-payment
increased, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  rose one basis point to 107 basis points
as of 8:30 a.m. in  Singapore , Westpac Banking Corp. prices show.
The gauge slid 14.8 basis points last month, according to data
provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index advanced two basis points to
84 as of 9:38 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Deutsche Bank AG
prices. Thatâ€™s the biggest increase since April 16 after the
benchmark declined for six consecutive days, according to CMA,
which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by
dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index climbed one basis point
to 107 basis points as of 9:30 a.m. in Sydney, according to
National Australia Bank Ltd. prices. The measure is poised for
its first increase since April 26, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
