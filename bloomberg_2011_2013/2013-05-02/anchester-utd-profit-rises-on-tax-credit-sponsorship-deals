Manchester United Plc (MANU) , the champion of
English soccer’s Premier League, said fiscal third-quarter
profit more than tripled after a tax credit and as the club
benefited from additional sponsorship agreements.  Net income rose to 3.6 million pounds ($5.6 million), or 2
pence a share, in the three months ended March 31, compared with
1.1 million pounds, or a penny, in the year-earlier period,
according to a Business Wire statement today.  Sales at the record 20-time English champion rose 30
percent to 91.7 million pounds, paced by a jump in commercial
revenue as sponsorship income rose 52 percent. The team, which
won the English title this season with four games to spare,
signed agreements with two financial services companies and a
social-game maker.  “Each of our three primary sectors -- commercial,
broadcasting and matchday -- delivered strong top-line gains and
helped us achieve a record third quarter,” Ed Woodward, the
team’s executive vice chairman, said in the statement.  Gross debt declined 13 percent to 367.6 million pounds, the
team said. It had 36.2 million pounds in cash at the end of the
quarter, and there was a non-cash tax credit of 6.7 million
pounds.  Staffing costs rose 25 percent in the period, pushing
operating expenses up 19 percent to 79 million pounds, United
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
