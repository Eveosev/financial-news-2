Ethanol’s discount to gasoline widened
after a government report showed production of the biofuel
climbed to the highest level in 10 months.  The price difference, or spread, expanded 0.13 cent to
26.16 cents a gallon on Energy Information Administration data
showing ethanol production last week was the most since June 29.
Gasoline surged after the Labor Department said  applications  for
 unemployment benefits  fell to the least in five years last week.
Corn-based Renewable Identification Numbers declined.  “Run rates are up, certainly at the highest this year,”
said Will Babler, a broker at Atten Babler Risk Management LLC
in Galena,  Illinois .  Denatured ethanol for June delivery rose 6 cents, or 2.4
percent, to $2.519 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. The
May contract, which expires tomorrow, advanced 11.4 cents to
$2.713 a gallon.  Gasoline for June delivery gained 6.13 cents, or 2.3
percent, to $2.7806 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Corn is the primary feedstock used to produce ethanol in
the U.S., with one bushel distilling into at least 2.75 gallons
of the renewable fuel.  Drought in the Midwest last summer scorched crops and
inflated production costs, prompting companies to cut
operations.  Corn Futures  Corn for May delivery climbed 15.75 cents, or 2.3 percent,
to $6.975 a bushel in  Chicago .  The corn crush spread was 18 cents a gallon, up from 12
cents yesterday, the highest since Dec. 2, 2011. The spread was
minus 35 cents on Dec. 31. The amount doesn’t include revenue
from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of
ethanol production, which can be fed to livestock.  Corn-based ethanol RINs  decreased 1.3 percent to 76.5
cents, the first drop since April 24, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. Advanced RINs, which cover biodiesel and Brazilian
sugarcanes ethanol, rose 1.2 percent to 85 cents.  RINs are certificates attached to each gallon of biofuel,
used by the government to track compliance with mandates for
blending with petroleum. Refiners can keep RINs or trade them.  Ethanol  stockpiles  fell 3.2 percent last week to 17 million
barrels a day, down 23 percent from a year earlier, the EIA, the
Energy Department’s statistical arm, said in the report
yesterday.  Output Outlook  Babler said the higher returns to make the fuel from corn
are enticing companies to increase output.  Production climbed 0.5 percent to 857,000 barrels a day, up
11 percent from the 770,000 barrels a day in the week ended Jan.
25, the lowest level in records going back to June 2010.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up about 96 percent of the
total U.S. gasoline pool in the week ended April 26, up from 93
percent the previous week and the most since April 5, EIA said
yesterday.  U.S. companies made no  imports  of the fuel last week, down
from 39,000 barrels a day the previous week, it said.  Anhydrous ethanol in  Sao Paulo  cost $2.58 a gallon as of
April 26, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  In cash market trading, ethanol rose 12.5 cents to $2.68 a
gallon in the Gulf, 4.5 cents to $2.62 in Chicago and 4.5 cents
to $2.76 in  New York , data compiled by Bloomberg show. On the
West Coast, the biofuel slumped 0.5 cent to $2.77 a gallon.  New York Harbor’s premium to Chicago was unchanged at 14
cents while  Gulf Coast ’s discount to the West Coast narrowed 13
cents to 9 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
