GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA Chief Executive Officer
Gerard Mestrallet said the idling of gas-fired power plants in
Europe has created a crisis on a greater scale than one that saw
uncompetitive steel plants shutter.  “The crisis of Europe’s gas plants is far worse than that
at the height of what hit the steel industry in terms of
overcapacity,” Mestrallet said today at a hearing on  France ’s
future energy mix. “This sector is stricken.”  Utilities including GDF Suez SA and EON SE are idling gas
plants and turning to cheaper coal. The switch lowers profit for
gas plants, which generate almost a quarter of European power,
and shrinks the market for suppliers led by OAO Gazprom. It also
increases emissions.  The European Parliament last month rejected a proposal to
rescue the carbon market through so-called backloading, which
would have cut the number of carbon permits to shore up prices
and make polluting more costly.  “We have to reestablish a carbon signal,” Mestrallet said
today. “Coal is being chosen ahead of gas so gas plants are
being stopped. This is an enormous problem.”  GDF Suez is closing, or mothballing, more than 8,000
megawatts of capacity in  Europe  from 2009 to 2013.  The utility took 2 billion euros ($2.6 billion) of charges
for 2012, mainly incurred on gas-fired power stations because of
the weakness in Europe’s power market. Lower demand, the falling
price of carbon-emission permits and the relative expense of gas
compared with coal have combined to make generation
unprofitable.  To contact the reporter on this story:
