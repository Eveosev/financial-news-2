LG Uplus Corp. (032640)  shares surged the most
in 14 months, leading gains among South Korean mobile-phone
carriers on speculation lower marketing costs will boost profit.  LG Uplus, the nation’s smallest mobile-phone operator,
rallied 8.2 percent to 11,250 won as of 12:40 p.m. Seoul time,
poised for its steepest advance since Feb. 22, 2012. The stock
was the  best performer  in the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index. SK
Telecom Co. climbed 5.2 percent as it reported first-quarter net
income that beat estimates.  Telecommunications companies’ second-quarter earnings will
be “very solid” as the number of South Korean users who
switched service providers fell 21 percent to 700,444 in April
from a year earlier, KTB Investment & Securities Co. wrote in a
report today. Lower switching rates may give companies scope to
cut the amount spent on marketing.  “The subsidy war has eased and the cut in marketing
expenses can also lead to profit increases,” Hwang Sung Jin, an
analyst at HMC Investment Securities Co., said by phone today.
“Expectations are rising that telecom companies’ earnings will
improve further from the second quarter.”  The Kospi Communication Index surged 6.6 percent today, the
most since February 2002. The gauge was the  best performer  among
19 industry groups in the Kospi index.  LG Uplus reported on April 30 first-quarter net profit of
74.3 billion won ($68 million), exceeding the 52.6 billion won
median estimate of analysts compiled by Bloomberg. SK Telecom
today posted first-quarter net income of 345.9 billion won,
compared with the consensus estimate of 327.3 billion won.  SK Telecom,  South Korea ’s biggest wireless operator, jumped
5.2 percent to 203,500 won.  KT Corp. (030200) , the country’s second-
largest mobile-phone carrier, surged 6.8 percent, the most since
March 2010, to 38,500 won.  -- Editors: Darren Boey,  Matthew Oakley   To contact the reporters on this story:
