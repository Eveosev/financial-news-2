The following is the text of
 Canada ’s international merchandise trade report for March
from  Statistics Canada .  Canada’s merchandise exports increased 5.1% in March and
imports rose 1.7%. As a result, Canada’s trade balance went from
a deficit of $1.2 billion in February to a surplus of $24
million in March.  Exports grew to $40.5 billion in March, and have been on an
upward trend since July 2012. Gains were recorded in all
sections during the month and export volumes were up 5.1%.  Imports rose for a third consecutive month to reach $40.4
billion, their second highest value on record. The main
contributors to the monthly increase were energy products and
metal and non-metallic mineral products. Overall, prices grew
1.4% and volumes were up 0.3%.  Exports to the  United States  rose 4.0% to $29.5 billion in
March, on higher exports of motor vehicles and parts and energy
products. Imports from the United States were up 2.0% to $25.6
billion, a third consecutive monthly advance. Consequently,
Canada’s trade surplus with the United States increased from
$3.2 billion in February to $3.8 billion in March.  Exports to countries other than the United States rose 7.9%
to $11.0 billion in March. All principal trading areas
registered gains, with Japan (+25.2%) recording the largest
percentage increase. Imports from countries other than United
States grew 1.2% to $14.8 billion. As a result, Canada’s trade
deficit with countries other than the United States decreased
from $4.4 billion in February to $3.8 billion in March.  Higher volumes lead increase in exports  Exports of energy products rose 3.9% to $9.1 billion in
March, mainly because of a 24.8% increase in volumes of natural
gas. Exports of this commodity group have been on an upward
trend since May 2012, primarily the result of higher prices.
Also contributing to the rise in exports of energy products were
refined petroleum energy products and other energy products.  Exports of motor vehicles and parts increased 6.1% to $5.8
billion, as volumes were up 4.8% and prices rose 1.2%. All
groups recorded an increase in value, led by passenger cars and
light trucks (+6.2%).  Exports of  consumer goods  rose 5.6% to $4.3 billion, as a
result of higher volumes and prices. Exports of food, beverage
and tobacco products were the main contributors to the gain, up
14.4% to a record high of $2.0 billion.  Exports of metal ores and non-metallic minerals rose 13.2%
to $1.7 billion in March. Copper ores and concentrates
contributed the most to the increase, the result of higher
volumes (+94.9%).  Exports of aircraft and other transportation equipment and
parts increased 13.4% to $1.5 billion, on higher volumes.
Aircraft,  aircraft engines  and aircraft parts rose for a third
consecutive month to lead the overall increase in this section.  Widespread gains in imports  Imports of energy products increased 7.5% to $3.8 billion
in March, as volumes rose 4.9%, and prices were up 2.5%. Higher
imports of crude oil and crude bitumen led the way, increasing
18.1% to $2.5 billion after three consecutive monthly declines.  Imports of metal and non-metallic mineral products rose
5.8% to $3.5 billion. Widespread gains in the section were led
by unwrought precious metal and precious metal alloys, which
increased 21.8% entirely on higher volumes.  Imports of aircraft and other transportation equipment and
parts were up 15.8% to $1.2 billion in March. The increase was
the result of higher volumes (+13.9%).  Imports of motor vehicles and parts rose 2.4% to $7.0
billion, their highest value since July 2012. An increase in
imports of motor vehicle engines and motor vehicle parts (+4.6%)
was the main contributor to the monthly gain. Volumes of motor
vehicles and parts increased 1.3% and prices were up 1.1%.  In contrast, imports of basic and industrial chemical,
plastic and rubber products declined 8.1% to $3.2 billion in
March, on lower volumes (-9.7%). Imports of lubricants and other
petroleum refinery products, as well as basic chemicals posted
the largest declines.  Note to readers  Merchandise trade is one component of Canada’s
international balance of payments (BOP), which also includes
trade in services, investment income, current transfers as well
as capital and financial flows.  International merchandise trade data by country are
available on both a BOP and a customs basis for the United
States,  Japan  and the  United Kingdom . Trade data for all other
individual countries are available on a customs basis only. BOP
data are derived from customs data by making adjustments for
factors such as valuation, coverage, timing and residency. These
adjustments are made to conform to the concepts and definitions
of the Canadian System of National Accounts.  Data in this release are on a BOP basis, seasonally
adjusted and in current dollars. Constant dollars are calculated
using the Laspeyres volume formula (2007=100).  For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonal
adjustment and identifying economic trends

X201000311141&amp;lang=fra) .  Revisions  In general, merchandise trade data are revised on an
ongoing basis for each month of the current year. Current year
revisions are reflected in both the customs and BOP based data.  The previous year’s customs data are revised with the
release of the January and February reference months as well as
on a quarterly basis. The previous two years of customs based
data are revised annually and are released in February with the
December reference month.  The previous year’s BOP based data are revised with the
release of the January, February and March reference months.
Revisions to BOP based data for the previous three years are
released annually in June with the April reference month.  Factors influencing revisions include late receipt of
import and export documentation, incorrect information on
customs forms, replacement of estimates produced for the energy
section with actual figures, changes in classification of
merchandise based on more current information, and changes to
seasonal adjustment factors.  Revised data are available in the appropriate CANSIM tables.  To contact the reporter on this story:
