Lazard Ltd. (LAZ) , the largest independent
merger-advisory firm, hired Larry Slaughter as a managing
director and vice chairman in its  investment-banking  business.  Slaughter, 49, was previously co-head of North American
investment banking at New York-based  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the
biggest U.S. lender, and also served as head of European
investment banking corporates in London, Lazard said today in a
statement. He spent 26 years at the bank and focuses on
transactions in industrials and automotives, the advisory firm
said.  Lazard has targeted at least $125 million in expense
reductions, giving the Hamilton, Bermuda-based company
flexibility to hire senior employees, Chief Executive Officer
Ken Jacobs, 54, told investors last week on a conference call.
Slaughter resigned from JPMorgan as part of a long-standing plan
to do something new with his career, the Financial Times
reported in February, citing an interview.  “We have known and respected Larry for many years,”
Antonio Weiss, Lazard’s global head of investment banking, said
in the statement. “His industry knowledge, sound judgment and
dealmaking skills will be of great value to our clients.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
