Zealand Pharma A/S (ZEAL) , the Danish
drugmaker, rose the most in seven weeks in Copenhagen trading
after partner  Sanofi (SAN)  said it will step up commitment to develop
diabetes treatment Lyxumia as a rival drug faces setbacks.  The Glostrup, Denmark-based drugmaker advanced 2.6 percent,
the most since March 13, to 79 kroner with trading volume at 78
percent of the three-month daily average.  Lyxumia is used in combination with Paris-based Sanofi’s
Lantus drug to help stimulate the production of insulin and is
set to compete with Novo Nordisk A/S’s experimental medicine
Tresiba. Bagsvaerd, Denmark-based Novo said yesterday it may
take five more years to gain U.S. approval to sell the drug
after regulators requested additional tests.  Tresiba’s delay is “really good news for us,” Sanofi
Chief Executive Officer  Chris Viehbacher  said today on a
conference call. “Priority has been assigned to a fixed-ratio
combination of Lantus/Lyxumia” after the “recent competitor
setback in the U.S.,” the drugmaker said in its  earnings
report .  To contact the reporter on this story:
