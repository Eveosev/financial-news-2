Robert Diamond , ousted as chief
executive officer of  Barclays Plc (BARC)  after the U.K. bank was fined
for rigging interest rates last year, said he was unaware of the
mechanics of how the London interbank offered rate was set,
according to the New York Times.  Before the scandal broke, he wouldn’t have known who at the
bank was responsible for submissions to the benchmark, Diamond
said in an interview with the newspaper today. As he turned
through the pages of internal e-mails among traders uncovered by
regulators he felt “physically sick,” he was cited as saying.  He was ousted by Bank of England government  Mervyn King ,
who told Barclays chairman Marcus Agius at a July 2 meeting that
Diamond no longer had the confidence of his regulators, the  New
York  Times reported. Diamond says his initial reaction is still
that King didn’t have the authority to do that, the Times said.  Diamond also told the newspaper he underestimated the U.K.
public’s anger against banks and their executives. He’s now
considering plans to start a firm that will buy stakes in
businesses in Africa and Europe, according to the Times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
