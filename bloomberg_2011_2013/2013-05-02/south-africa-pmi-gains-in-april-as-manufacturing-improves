  South Africa ’s purchasing managers’
 index  rose in April, signaling that factories probably expanded
output, Kagiso Tiso Holdings said.  The seasonally adjusted index increased to 50.5 from 49.3
in March, Johannesburg-based  Kagiso  said in an e-mailed
statement today. A number above 50 indicates growth in factory
output. The Bureau for  Economic Research , based at the
University of Stellenbosch near  Cape Town , conducts the PMI
survey for Kagiso.  “While this is a positive sign, the level of the index
suggests that manufacturing production remains under pressure,”
Abdul Davids, head of research at Kagiso, said. “Our key
trading partners continue to grapple with tough conditions.”  Manufacturing and mining, which account for about 20
percent of the economy, have struggled to return to levels
before a recession in 2009 because of strikes at mines last year
and slumping demand from  Europe . Gross domestic product will
probably expand 2.6 percent this year, close to last year’s
growth of 2.5 percent, according to the National Treasury.  The sub-index measuring business activity rose 4.5 points
to 52.2, while the new sales orders index increased 1.7 points
to 53.7, Kagiso said. The employment index dropped 0.5 point to
42.1, indicating manufacturers shed jobs, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
