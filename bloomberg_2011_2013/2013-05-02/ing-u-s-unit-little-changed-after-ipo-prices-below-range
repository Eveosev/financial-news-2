ING U.S. Inc. (VOYA) , the New York-based unit
of the largest Dutch financial-services company, climbed almost
7 percent in its trading debut after raising $1.27 billion in
its initial public offering.  The stock rose $1.34 to $20.84 at the close in  New York .
ING U.S. sold 65.2 million shares yesterday for $19.50 each,
after offering 64.2 million shares for $21 to $24 apiece.  ING Groep NV took its U.S. unit public after agreeing to
sell global-insurance and investment-management operations to
win European Union approval of its 2008 bailout from the
Netherlands. Jan Hommen, chief executive officer of the
Amsterdam-based parent, has overseen more than 25  asset
disposals  for at least 20 billion euros ($26 billion) in
proceeds. Rodney Martin, the CEO of ING U.S., helped  American
International Group Inc. (AIG)  repay its rescue by divesting assets.  ING U.S. will be renamed Voya Financial after the IPO and
the switch will take about two years, the company has said. The
stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol
VOYA.  ING U.S., which has about 13 million customers and sells
 life insurance , annuities and retirement products, received $600
million of gross proceeds from the offering, which it plans to
combine with about $1.4 billion of payments from subsidiaries
and $1.1 billion from a planned debt sale to help repay
borrowings, filings show.  ING U.S.’s IPO is the second largest in the U.S. this year,
behind the $2.6 billion initial offering by Pfizer Inc.’s
animal-health unit  Zoetis Inc. (ZTS) , which included an overallotment,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. led ING U.S.’s sale.  Annuities  ING U.S. scaled back from selling equity-linked retirement
products known as variable annuities. It was the fourth-largest
seller of the contracts in 2007 and had dropped out of the top
20 by 2011, according to data from industry group Limra.  The insurer is focusing on managing assets for retail
clients and institutional investors and selling protection
products such as life insurance. The retirement segment provided
49 percent of operating  earnings  before taxes in 2012, and
individual life accounted for 21 percent, the IPO filing shows.  The net loss in the three months ended March 31 was about
$190 million to $230 million, ING U.S. said in a filing last
week. The loss was driven by hedges that guard against falling
stocks on variable annuities. Operating earnings before taxes in
the ongoing business were about $270 million to $290 million,
ING U.S. said.  ING Groep (INGA) , which has pledged to repay all 10 billion euros
in state support by 2015, so far has returned 7.8 billion euros,
as well as 2.4 billion euros in interest and premiums. After the
IPO, ING was set to own 75 percent of its U.S. unit. ING has to
dispose of the entire division by the end of 2016.  To contact the reporters on this story:
