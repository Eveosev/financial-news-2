Many people assume that it's possible for a person to be an effective leader without being likable. That is technically true, but you may not like the odds.  In a study of 51,836 leaders, we found just 27 who were rated at the bottom quartile in terms of likability but in the top quartile in terms of overall leadership effectiveness  — that's approximately one out of 2,000.   Our likability index, based on data collected from 360 assessments, measures a broad set of behaviors that go far beyond smiling and having a pleasant personality.  To see the complete list, and take a self-assessment of your personal likability, click  here. Likability sounds like an immutable trait — something people either have or don't. But our experience in working with thousands of leaders suggests otherwise. Our 360 data from these 50,000+ leaders highlighted seven key steps executives can take to substantially increase their likability.  You can be more likeable. Identify two of the actions from the list above that would most help you in your current situation.  A great way to start would be to ask for feedback and ask team members to identify which activities would have the most value to them. Make a plan, identifying some specific steps you will take to improve, and then stick to it. Ask others for feedback on your progress. And, oh by the way,  if you are a man, this is even more important   for you to consider, because in all probability, you are less liked than your female counterparts, and that's hindering your effectiveness as a leader.
