     May 2 (Bloomberg) --　Japanese  stocks  fell, with the Topix
Index heading for the first back-to-back decline in two weeks,
after reports showed U.S. manufacturing and hiring slowed and as
the yen rose, weighing on the earnings outlook for exporters in
the Asian nation.  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , a construction machinery maker that gets 30
percent of its sales in the Americas, dropped 2.5 percent.
 Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s biggest carmaker, slid 1.4
percent after its U.S. sales missed estimates in April. Takeda
Pharmaceutical Co. added 1.9 percent after a judge threw out a
$6.5 million jury verdict against  Asia ’s biggest drugmaker over
its Actos diabetes treatment.  The Topix slid 0.6 percent to 1,151.57 at 9:20 a.m. in
Tokyo with about two stocks dropping for each that rose. The
 Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  dropped 0.5 percent to 13,730.93.
Japanese markets will be closed tomorrow and on May 6 for public
