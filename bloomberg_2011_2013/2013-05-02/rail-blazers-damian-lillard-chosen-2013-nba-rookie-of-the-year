Damian Lillard of the  Portland Trail
Blazers  was the unanimous choice as National Basketball
Association rookie of the year, the league said.  “I can’t stop smiling,” Lillard said last night when he
was given the Eddie Gottlieb Trophy.  The sixth overall selection in the 2012 NBA draft, Lillard
set an rookie record by making 185 3-pointers, surpassing the
166 made by Golden State’s Stephen Curry during his 2009-10
rookie season.  Among rookies, Lillard ranked first in scoring with 19.0
points per game, assists with 6.5 per game and 38.6 minutes per
game. Lillard assisted on 36.5 percent of Portland’s field goals
while scoring 23.9 percent of his team’s points.  The 22-year-old point guard received all 121 first-place
votes from a panel of sports writers and broadcasters in the U.S.
and Canada to become the first unanimous choice since the Los
Angeles Clippers’ Blake Griffin in 2011.  Anthony Davis  of the New Orleans Hornets was second in the
voting and the  Washington Wizards ’ Bradley Beal was third.  To contact the reporter on this story:
