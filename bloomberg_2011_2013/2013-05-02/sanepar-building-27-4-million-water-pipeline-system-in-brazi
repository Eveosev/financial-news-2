Cia. de Saneamento do Parana , the
Brazilian water utility, is building a 55 million-real ($27.4
million) pipeline project that will double the water supply of
the city of Londrina.  Sanepar, as the company is known, will build 22 kilometers
(13.7 miles) of pipes connecting the Tibagi river in the
southern state of Parana to the local water-supply system, the
Curitiba, Brazil-based company said today in an e-mailed
statement.  The project, along with another 16.5 million-real expansion
to a water-treatment plant, is expected to be complete in the
second half of 2014, according to the statement. When complete,
the system will be able to deliver 2,400 liters (633 gallons) of
water a second, up from 1,200 liters now, enough to meet demand
through 2030 in the cities of Londrina and Cambe.  The network supplies about 55 percent of the two citiesâ€™
water demand now, Sanepar said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
