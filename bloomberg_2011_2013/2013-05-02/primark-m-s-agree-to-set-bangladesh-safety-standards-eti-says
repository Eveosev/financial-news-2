U.K. retailers including  Associated
British Foods Plc (ABF) ’s Primark chain and  Marks & Spencer Group Plc (MKS) 
will take a “common approach” to fire and building safety in
Bangladesh following a series of industrial accidents.  The  Ethical Trading Initiative , whose members also include
 Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) ’s Asda chain, said today that its retailers
who source from Bangladesh will improve factories to an agreed
minimum standard. The mandates of health and safety committees
in unsafe factories will be “strengthened,” ETI also said in a
statement, without being more specific.  Rescue efforts at a factory complex in Savar, Bangladesh
continued today where at least 433 people have died. The
disaster was at least the third reported industrial accident in
the South Asian nation since November, when 112 people died in a
fire at a workshop that was producing clothes for companies
including Wal-Mart.  “We are appalled by the recent factory fire tragedies, and
last week’s deplorable Savar building collapse,” ETI Director
Peter McAllister said in the statement. “Together with our
company, trade union and NGO members, we are committed to
driving real, sustainable change for workers by tackling the
chronic, widespread health and safety issues that plague
 Bangladesh ’s garment sector.”  An alliance between retailers, unions and international
agencies is due to be announced on May 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
