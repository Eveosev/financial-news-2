Investors that bought U.K. commercial
property outside of  London  this year generated returns that were
a third higher than assets in the capital as a lack of
competition pushed down prices, according to research firm
International Property Databank Ltd.  Yields on offices, shops and warehouses purchased outside
of London were 6.5 percent for the year through March, compared
with 4.3 percent in the city, IPD said today in an e-mailed
statement. That’s the widest margin since June 2007.  Investors trying to avoid high prices in London are looking
to cheaper real estate outside the capital as a six-year decline
in values slows, IPD said. The amount of commercial real estate
investment in central London last year surpassed the rest of
Britain for the first time as overseas buyers preferred the
U.K.’s largest city, broker DTZ said in a report yesterday.  “The decision now for investors is how much risk they are
willing to tolerate,” Greg Mansell, head of research at London-
based IPD, said in the statement. Regional properties “can hold
their own when in the right hands,” offering better income and
value growth than London.  The value of regional commercial real estate fell 0.9
percent from January through March, a slower decline than in
2012, IPD said. Properties in “second tier” cities such as
Birmingham and Leeds had yields of about 7 percent after values
dropped by about 42 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
