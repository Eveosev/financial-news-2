 The U.S. Transportation Department
shut down a Niagara Falls, New York-based sightseeing company,
declaring its drivers and buses “an imminent hazard to public
safety.”  The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration order to
cease all operations applies to Coach USA Tour Inc., a small-
fleet operator, the agency said in a statement today. The shut-
down company isn’t affiliated with the Coach USA Inc. of
Paramus,  New Jersey , which operates Megabus.com.  The Niagara Falls company wasn’t testing its drivers for
drug or alcohol use and wasn’t properly maintaining its
vehicles, FMCSA investigators found.  To contact the reporter on this story:
