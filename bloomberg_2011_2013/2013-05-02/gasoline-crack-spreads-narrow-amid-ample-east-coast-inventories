Gasoline crack spreads narrowed for a
second day after the government reported U.S. East Coast
stockpiles of the motor fuel increased to the highest level in
more than a year.  The fuel’s  premium  over June West Texas Intermediate
slipped 82 cents to $22.36 a barrel. The  spread  to Brent
weakened 83 cents to $13.43. The Energy Information
Administration said yesterday gasoline inventories in PADD 1,
which includes the  New York  Harbor delivery point for futures
contracts, grew 1.18 million barrels last week to 61.7 million,
the highest level since March 9, 2012.  “Gasoline futures are going to remain under pressure due
to the high inventories in New York and the anticipated arrivals
from  Europe  as refineries over there return from maintenance,”
said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in
Houston.  Gasoline for June delivery fell 0.42 cent to $2.7151 a
gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 9:41 a.m. on
volume that was 19 percent above the 100-day average.  Inventories of reformulated gasoline to be blended with
ethanol, or RBOB, in PADD 1, which is the grade delivered
against Nymex futures, rose 759,000 barrels to 21.8 million
barrels.  “I expect that crack spreads are going to remain under
pressure,” Lipow said. “We saw a significant number of
gasoline cargoes diverted away from New York Harbor toward the
 Gulf Coast . That’s indicative of high inventories in New York.”  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for June delivery gained 2.13
cents, or 0.8 percent, to $2.8102 a gallon on the Nymex. Trading
volume was 17 percent below the 100-day average.  Gasoline at the  pump , averaged nationwide, rose 0.3 cent to
$3.525 a gallon, AAA said on its website today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
