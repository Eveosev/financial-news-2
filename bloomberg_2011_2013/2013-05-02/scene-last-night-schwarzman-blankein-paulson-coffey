Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein and  Blackstone Group LP (BX)  President Tony James listened to Crosby, Stills and Nash last night.  “‘Wooden Ships’ is my favorite,” said James after the concert at Jazz at Lincoln Center. “I used to put it on when I was in college. I’d sit in my room and listen to the song over and over.”  The gala raised $3.7 million, said Valentino Carlotti, a board member of the institution and a partner at Goldman Sachs.  At the post-concert dinner, Graham Nash, David Crosby and Stephen Stills table-hopped.  Then a “second line” of musicians (among them Wynton Marsalis and Vince Giordano) and supporters (such as Lisa Schiff and her daughter Ashley Ramos) wove past guests (including Len Blavatnik, whose Warner Music Group owns the Crosby, Stills and Nash catalog).  Salmon Paper  Meanwhile, Blackstone Chairman  Steve Schwarzman  and SkyBridge Capital II LLC founder Anthony Scaramucci stopped in at the Financial Times 125th anniversary party held at a mansion on East 63rd Street.  “I love the FT,” Schwarzman said. “I think it’s the most international paper, and you hear about things you can’t hear elsewhere.”  “Have you seen any criminal defendants?” said  Preet Bharara , U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, standing in a courtyard where musicians, dressed as newsies at the request of the FT event planners, played jazz.  Hat Luncheon  The gala fundraising started before noon in Central Park at the annual Hat Luncheon of the park’s conservancy.  “It’s a beautiful day, isn’t it?” said hedge-fund manager John Paulson in a soft voice. He’d started it with a bicycle ride in the park and was about to receive a medal for his support, including a $100 million gift last year.  Paulson’s wife, Jenny, dressed in a white Alexander McQueen pantsuit with hand-painted dragonflies, accepted on their behalf.  “Central Park stole my heart a long time ago,” she said, noting the park’s springtime “explosion of colors as magnolias, cherry blossoms, tulips and azaleas bloom.”  “The crabapples are at their best,” said Douglas Blonsky, president and CEO of the Central Park Conservancy.  Representing  JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM) , a sponsor of the event, was Kelly Coffey, deputy CEO of its U.S. private bank. As for the hats: one was decked with teddy bears, another had a snake, and another riffed on the frilly bone booties for a crown roast. The event raised $3.3 million.
