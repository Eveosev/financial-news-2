Tokyo Steel Manufacturing Co. (5423) ,  Japan ’s
biggest producer of steel from scrap iron, expects to see an
improvement in business in the second half this fiscal year
prompted by Abenomics, the economic-stimulus policies introduced
by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.  “Things will remain tough in the first half as steel
demand has yet to be strong enough,” Managing Director Kiyoshi Imamura said April 30 in an interview at the company’s Tokyo
headquarters. A recovery will begin in the six months to March
31, aided by public spending and urban development projects
which will lift the company’s steel production by 22 percent to
1.1 million metric tons in the period, he said.  To capitalize on Abenomics,  Tokyo  Steel is this year
downplaying production of steel sheets for cars and electric
appliances in favor of conventional construction steel. Japan’s
ruling Liberal Democratic Party has proposed spending 200
trillion yen ($2.1 trillion) over 10 years to strengthen the
country’ infrastructure.  Construction steel will account for 55 percent of steel
production in the current year, up from 45 percent in the year-
ago period, Imamura said. Steel sheets will account for 45
percent of production.  The company will need to await a price recovery in the
global steel market to protect earnings before it takes
advantage of the weakening yen to increase sales volumes,
Imamura said.  Currency to Weaken  The Japanese currency, which traded at 97.12 yen to the
dollar as of 9:19 a.m. in Tokyo, has fallen 12 percent since Abe
took office on Dec. 26, easing cost pressures at domestic
manufacturers from  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  to  Komatsu Ltd. (6301)   The yen will likely fall below 100 yen against the dollar
and may reach 105 yen to 110 yen later this year, backed by the
strength of the dollar amid optimism that a surge in shale gas
production will boost the U.S. economy, Imamura said.  Tokyo Steel last month reported a fourth consecutive year
of losses after booking a 129 billion yen ($1.3 billion)
impairment charge related to its steel sheet plant in central
Japan. It aims to return to a profit of 2 billion yen in the
year to March 2014 as demand recovers in the second half and
depreciation costs decline.  Tokyo Steel fell as much as 3.6 percent to 378 yen as of
9:55 a.m. on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The stock has fallen
almost 10 percent this year, compared with a 32 percent gain in
the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average.  To contact the reporters on this story:
