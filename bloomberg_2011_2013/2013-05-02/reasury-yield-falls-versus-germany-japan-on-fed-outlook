Treasury 10-year note yields traded
almost at this year’s low before a report tomorrow forecast to
show the U.S. added fewer jobs than required to reduce the
nation’s unemployment  rate .  U.S. debt  was little changed after the  Federal Reserve 
reiterated yesterday its pledge to buy U.S. securities as it
tries to spur the economy. Economists predict the Labor
Department’s monthly employment report tomorrow will show
employers hired 140,000 workers in April, after an 88,000 gain
the previous month that was the smallest since June. The jobless
rate is forecast to be unchanged at 7.6 percent. Volatility in
the Treasury market set a record low yesterday.  “Most people expect it to be on the weak side of
consensus,” said  Ray Remy , head of fixed income in New York at
Daiwa Capital Markets America Inc., one of 21 primary dealers
that trade with the Fed, referring to the jobs report. “The
market is fairly close to its highs. We’ll stay well-bid until
we see the new news.”  The benchmark 10-year note  yield  dropped one basis point or
0.01 percentage point to 1.63 percent as of 5 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The price of the 2
percent note due in February 2023 added 1/32 or $0.31 per $1,000
face amount to 103 3/8.  The yield slid to 1.61 percent yesterday, the least since
Dec. 11. It reached a record low 1.38 percent on July 25.  ECB Cut  The  European Central Bank  led by President  Mario Draghi  cut
its key  interest rate  to a record low as the 17-nation euro
region struggles to emerge from recession. Policy makers meeting
in Bratislava today lowered the main refinancing rate to 0.5
percent from 0.75 percent, a move predicted by 45 of 70
economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  U.S. yields during the next month to six weeks are “going
to go lower” because the major central banks are easing, Remy
of Daiwa said.  Applications for unemployment insurance payments fell
18,000 to 324,000 in the week ended April 27, the fewest since
January 2008, Labor Department figures showed today in
 Washington . Economists forecast 345,000 claims, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  “The claims numbers have been improving,” said  Tom Porcelli , chief U.S. economist at  RBC Capital Markets , LLC, one
of 21 primary dealers that trade with the Fed. “Ahead of
tomorrow’s jobs numbers it will be hard to take any outsized
position. The hiring side of the equation has been very
lackluster. You really need to see the hiring side accelerate
from here.”  Yield Difference  The  difference  between U.S. and Japanese 10-year yields
shrank to 1.04 percentage points yesterday, the narrowest since
Jan. 14 based on closing prices. The  extra yield  10-year
Treasuries offered over same-maturity German bunds narrowed to
41 basis points yesterday, the smallest since February. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  U.S. and German government securities have both returned 1
percent this year, while those in  Japan  gained 2 percent,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  The Fed said yesterday it will keep buying bonds at a
monthly pace of $85 billion while standing ready to raise or
lower purchases as economic conditions evolve. The  Bank of Japan 
is buying more than 7 trillion yen ($72 billion) of bonds a
month as part of its own plan to spur growth.  Fed Purchases  The U.S. central bank purchased $1.5 billion of Treasuries
maturing from February 2036 to August 2042 today, according to
the New York Fed’s website.  Fed purchases have held down both yields and volatility.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s  MOVE index  measuring price
swings set a record low of 49.04 basis points yesterday. The
average for the past year is 62.91 basis points.  Treasury gains may turn to losses during the year ahead,
based on a Bloomberg survey. The 10-year yield will increase to
2.43 percent by the end of the first quarter of 2014, based on
the responses with the most recent projections given the
heaviest weightings.  The U.S. will sell $32 billion in three-year notes, $24
billion in 10-year debt and $16 billion in 30-year bonds on
three consecutive days starting May 7, the Treasury announced
yesterday.  The Treasury said it may gradually decrease coupon auction
sizes and estimated its first floating-rate auction will be held
in the fourth quarter this year or in the first quarter of 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
