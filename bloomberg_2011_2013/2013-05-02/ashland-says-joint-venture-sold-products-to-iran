Ashland Inc. (ASH) , the biggest producer of
specialty papermaking chemicals, said a 50-50 joint venture with
Switzerland’s  Clariant AG (CLN)  sold products to Iran without the
approval of the U.S. government.  Units of the ASK Chemicals GmbH venture sold “granulate,
coatings and hot top products” from Oct. 1 through March 1 to
entities that may be owned or controlled by the Iranian
government, Covington, Kentucky-based Ashland said today in its
10-Q filing. The products generated 715,000 euros ($934,000) of
sales and 75,000 euros of profit, Ashland said.  The products are used in metal casting, said  Gary Rhodes ,
an Ashland spokesman.  ASK’s supervisory board unanimously voted in March to end
transactions with Iran and ASK is terminating all business in
the country, Ashland said in the filing.  No one at Clariant in Switzerland answered phone calls
outside of normal business hours.  The Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of
2012 requires publicly traded companies to disclose transactions
with Iran’s government that aren’t authorized by the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
