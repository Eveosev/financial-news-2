Corp. Geo SAB (GEOB) ,  Mexico ’s second-biggest
homebuilder by sales, rebounded from a 10-year low as volatility
surged amid speculation about how President Enrique Pena Nieto’s
housing policies will affect the industry.  Geo climbed 21 percent to 5.02 pesos as of 2:31 p.m. in
Mexico City. The stock’s 30-day volatility, a measure of price
swings, increased to the highest since 1998, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Desarrolladora Homex SAB, the country’s
 biggest  homebuilder, advanced 9.2 percent. Urbi Desarrollos
Urbanos SAB, the third-biggest, jumped 11 percent. The benchmark
IPC  index  fell 0.4 percent.  Shares of Mexico’s biggest homebuilders have plummeted this
year, pushing the Habita gauge of six stocks down 56 percent, as
they struggle to adapt to changes in the industry. Government
subsidies on which the builders depend for growth have been
shifting toward development of capital-intensive apartment
buildings in urban areas over single-family houses in commuter
towns or the countryside, crimping cash flows.  “All the news in the short-term is very uncertain, and the
volatility will continue to be very high,” Jorge Lagunas, who
oversees about $200 million in stocks at Grupo Financiero
Interacciones SA, said in a telephone interview from Mexico
City. “It’s totally a coin flip in the short term.”  Geo has lost 67 percent this year, while Urbi  sank  76
percent and Homex retreated 60 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
