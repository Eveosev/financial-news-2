Warren Buffett , the billionaire
chairman of  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , said men need to help
remove obstacles to women’s professional success to improve the
economy.  “If obvious benefits flow from helping the male component
of the workforce achieve its potential, why in the world
wouldn’t you want to include its counterpart?” Buffett wrote in
an  essay  on Fortune magazine’s website today. “The closer that
America comes to fully employing the talents of all its
citizens, the greater its output of goods and services will
be.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
