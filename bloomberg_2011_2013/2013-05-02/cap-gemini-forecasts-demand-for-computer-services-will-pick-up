Cap Gemini SA, (CAP)  a French competitor to
International Business Machines Corp., forecast that demand for
computer services will pick up in the second quarter after
bookings improved in February and March.  Shares of the Paris-based company jumped as much as 4.1
percent in Paris trading. Cap Gemini, whose clients include
luxury carmaker Rolls-Royce, reported today first-quarter
revenue shrank 2.6 percent to 2.5 billion euros ($3.3 billion).
Bookings improved over the quarter, reaching 2.17 billion euros,
just under last year’s 2.21 billion euros.  “We have a decent pipeline for the second quarter,” Cap
Gemini Chief Executive Officer Paul Hermelin said on a
conference call. “We expect a significantly improved context in
the second quarter in  France  and we’ve seen encouraging signs in
North-America.”  The company, which makes about 40 percent of its revenue
from France and the U.S. combined, confirmed its forecast for a
revenue increase of 1.2 percent in 2013, excluding acquisitions
and currency fluctuations. It had sales of 10.26 billion euros
last year. French rival Atos said last week that demand will
improve during the year after reporting first-quarter sales it
said were a low point of 2013.  Cap Gemini shares traded up 3.6 percent at 36.19 euros at
11:46 a.m. in Paris.  To contact the reporter on this story:
