The dollar snapped its biggest advance
against the euro in two weeks before the U.S. releases April
jobs data after the previous report disappointed with employers
adding the fewest positions in nine months.  The euro yesterday dropped versus 15 of its 16 major peers
after European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said policy
makers may take the unprecedented step of charging banks to hold
excess reserves.  Australia ’s dollar was set for its longest
weekly losing streak versus the  New Zealand  currency in 12 years
as traders raised bets the bigger nation’s  Reserve Bank  will cut
borrowing costs next week.  “The data has softened recently and that could show up in
non-farm payrolls,” said  Richard Grace , the Sydney-based chief
currency strategist and head of international economics at
 Commonwealth Bank of Australia . “If the number is weak, the
 U.S. dollar  will go down a little as will long bond yields.”  The dollar traded little changed at $1.3067 per euro as of
7:11 a.m. in  London  after rising 0.9 percent yesterday, paring
this week’s decline to 0.3 percent.  The U.S. currency fetched 98.10 yen from 97.94 yesterday
and 98.05 on April 26. The 17-nation euro was at 128.16 yen from
127.95, heading for a 0.3 percent climb on the week.  Japanese markets are closed today and on May 6 for
holidays.  Payrolls increased by 140,000 workers after an 88,000 gain
in March, according to the median forecast of economists
surveyed by  Bloomberg News  before a Labor Department report. The
 unemployment rate  may have stayed at 7.6 percent, matching
March’s reading as the lowest since December 2008.  Fed, ECB  The Dollar Index, which Intercontinental Exchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against currencies of six trading
partners, fell on May 1 after the  Federal Reserve  said it will
maintain its bond buying at a pace of $85 billion a month to
spur growth and is prepared to raise or lower the amount as
economic conditions evolve. It was little changed at 82.243
today.  The ECB, meeting in Bratislava, Slovakia, cut its  benchmark
rate  by a quarter-percentage point to 0.5 percent yesterday. It
reduced its marginal lending rate, which banks use for overnight
credit, to 1 percent, from 1.5 percent, and kept its deposit
rate at zero.  ‘Technically Ready’  Asked at a press conference if further action could include
taking the deposit rate into negative territory, Draghi said the
central bank is “technically ready” and that “we will look at
this with an open mind.” He said the ECB also will continue to
lend banks as much money as they need at least until mid-2014.  “Draghi has opened up more flexibility to act on rates to
the downside,” Greg Gibbs, a Singapore-based senior currency
strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, wrote in a note
to clients. “As such, we might expect the euro to be more
responsive to negative news than it has been to date.”  The euro may decline toward $1.2950, “but it’s a less
compelling trade from here,” he wrote.  A report today will probably show that euro-area producer-
price inflation slowed to the lowest annual rate in three years,
according to the median estimate of analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Factory-gate prices  in the 17-nation economy rose 0.6
percent in March from a year earlier, compared with a 1.3
percent increase in the prior month, the European Union’s
statistics office in Luxembourg is forecast to say.  The euro has declined 1.9 percent in the past three months,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes that track
10 developed-market currencies. The yen has dropped 3.3 percent
and the dollar gained 2.9 percent.  Rate Cut  The Australian dollar was poised to decline this week
against 14 of its 16 most-traded peers as swaps traders see a 59
percent chance the nation’s central bank will lower its
benchmark rate from 3 percent on May 7, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The RBA will cut rates by 62 basis points
over 12 months, according to a Credit Suisse Group AG  index .  The Australian dollar fell to NZ$1.2034, the weakest since
October 2009, before trading 0.1 percent lower at NZ$1.2045,
down 0.6 percent this week. It’s poised for a seventh week of
declines that would be the longest losing streak since March
2001. The Aussie rose 0.2 percent to $1.0263, while the  New
Zealand dollar  gained 0.3 percent to 85.20 U.S. cents.  “We’re still short the pair,” said  Imre Speizer , a
strategist in Auckland at  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) , referring to
positions betting on declines in the Australian currency versus
New Zealand’s. “Our view all along was that Aussie-kiwi would
fall because of the relative central bank paths.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
