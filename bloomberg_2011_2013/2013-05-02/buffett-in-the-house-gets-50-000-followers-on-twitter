Warren Buffett , the chairman of  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , topped 80,000 followers on Twitter as he sent his first message on the social media site.  “Warren is in the house,” Buffett wrote in the post, sent today during an event on women in leadership sponsored by Fortune magazine at the University of Nebraska Omaha. He sent the post at about 12:20 p.m. New York time and had more than 59,000 followers an hour later.  Buffett, 82, will host Berkshire’s shareholders May 4 at the company’s annual meeting in Omaha. The billionaire, whose Twitter handle is @WarrenBuffett, joins celebrities from pop singer Justin Bieber to Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates on the site.  The number of Twitter users following Buffett trails the more than 38 million receiving updates from Bieber, and the 11.1 million following Gates, who’s a director of Berkshire and plays cards with Buffett.  “Welcome to Twitter @WarrenBuffett,” Gates said in a Twitter post. “First ever Twitter bridge tourney starts now. I bid 3 hearts.”  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which turned to Buffett for a capital injection in the financial crisis, also sent a message. “Please welcome our friend @WarrenBuffett to @twitter by following him today,” the bank said.  Buffett isn’t following any other people on Twitter.
