The average price for regular
gasoline at U.S. pumps fell 11.04 cents a gallon in the past two
weeks to $3.5363 a gallon, according to Lundberg Survey Inc.  The survey covers the period ended April 19 and is based on
information obtained at about 2,500 filling stations by the
Camarillo, California-based company. The average price has
fallen 25.87 cents from the peak on Feb. 22, and 37.64 cents
from the price on April 20, 2012, she said.  “This two-week drop of just over 11 cents replicates just
what the U.S. benchmark West Texas intermediate oil price did,”
 Trilby Lundberg , president of Lundberg Survey, said yesterday in
a telephone interview. “Crude is not the only factor, but it is
overwhelmingly the main factor.”  The trend of lower gasoline prices may reverse soon because
of rising worldwide demand and the cost of meeting U.S.
renewable-fuel standards, Lundberg said.  Gasoline futures on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  fell
9.12 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $2.7724 a gallon in the two weeks
ended April 19. Futures have declined 1.4 percent this year.  U.S. gasoline stockpiles  fell 633,000 barrels in the week
ended April 12 to 221.7 million, according to the Energy
Information Administration. PADD 1, or U.S. East Coast,
inventories rose 674,000, EIA data show.  Gasoline  demand , measured by deliveries to wholesalers, was
at its lowest seasonal point in the past five years.  Weaker Demand  West Texas Intermediate oil on the Nymex fell $4.69, or 5.1
percent, to $88.01 a barrel in the two weeks to April 19. Prices
have dropped 4.1 percent this year.  Crude  inventories  sank 1.23 million barrels in the week
ended April 12 to 387.6 million, the first decline in four
weeks, according to data from the EIA, the Energy Department’s
statistics arm. Supplies at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery
point for the Nymex futures contract, increased 2.2 percent to
51.1 million barrels, a 10-week high.  Oil will probably fall this week on signs that economic
growth is slowing and as U.S. production rose to a 20-year high,
a Bloomberg survey showed.  Thirteen of 27 analysts, or 48 percent, forecast crude will
drop through April 26. Eight respondents, or 30 percent,
predicted a gain. Six said there would be little change. For
last week, 39 percent of analysts projected an increase, with 36
percent predicting a decline.  The highest price in the lower 48 U.S. states among the
markets surveyed was in  Chicago , where the average was $3.97 a
gallon, Lundberg said. The lowest price was in Tulsa, Oklahoma,
where customers paid an average of $3.21 a gallon.  Regular gasoline on  Long Island ,  New York , averaged $3.76 a
gallon, according to Lundberg. Drivers in  Los Angeles  paid an
average of $3.93 a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
