Red Bull’s Sebastian Vettel won the
Bahrain Grand Prix today to extend his lead in the Formula One
drivers’ standings.  Vettel finished ahead of Lotus duo  Kimi Raikkonen  and
Romain Grosjean after 57 laps of the Sakhir circuit, in a repeat
of last year’s first three.  Vettel, who started No. 2 on the grid, controlled the race
from the third lap. His 9.1-second victory was the 25-year-old
German’s second win this season and the 28th of his career.
Vettel is seeking a fourth straight world title.  “It was a faultless, seamless race from start to finish,”
Vettel said at the post-race ceremony. “The pace was
phenomenal, the car was very quick. We took good care of the
tires and it all paid off.”  Paul di Resta of Force India was fourth today and  Lewis Hamilton  of Mercedes fifth.  Nico Rosberg  of Mercedes, who
started on pole, could only finish ninth.  Vettel also won in Malaysia on March 24. He has 77 points,
followed by Raikkonen (67), Hamilton (50), Ferrari’s  Fernando Alonso  (47) and Mark Webber of Red Bull (32).  Today’s grand prix, the fourth of a 19-race schedule,
passed off without disruption after clashes between police and
political protesters away from the circuit in the days before
the race.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
