Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  said Britain’s tax authorities have increased the amount
of money collected from wealthy individuals by 10 percent.  The Revenue and Customs High Net Worth Unit that deals with
the tax affairs of about 5,800 people with wealth of at least 20
million pounds ($34 million) raised about 220 million pounds in
the tax year that ran through March, compared with 200 million
pounds in the previous tax year, according to the Treasury.  The effort is “a demonstration not just of our seriousness
of intent when it comes to improving our fight against  tax
avoidance , but actually the fact that we are getting better
results and getting more money in,” Osborne told reporters in
Washington ahead of the publication of the figures in London
today.  Osborne is seeking to show voters that he’s making the rich
contribute to Britain’s austerity program. The opposition  Labour
Party  has attacked his decision to reduce the top rate of income
tax to 45 percent from 50 percent earlier this month.  Osborne on April 9 gave individuals evading tax through the
 Isle of Man , Guernsey and Jersey three years to pay up or face
prosecution. The top 1 percent of earners paid 26.5 percent of
total income tax in the fiscal year that ran through March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
