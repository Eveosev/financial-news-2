Plans in the euro area to allow the
direct recapitalization of failing banks must stick to a
hierarchy of responsibility that starts with the banks’
shareholders, the German Finance Ministry said.  In its report for April, the ministry said a “liability
cascade” must prevail in any attempt to save a bank, allowing
the European Stability Mechanism to allocate resources on its
main job of averting state insolvencies.  “From the German government’s point of view, it’s
important to limit the volume for direct recapitalization to
allow the ESM to focus on its core task,” the ministry in
Berlin said today. “It’s also important that the liability
hierarchy is followed,” it said, echoing comments made by
Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble in Brussels this month.  Citing legal concerns, Schaeuble rejected pressure from his
euro-area peers to agree to rush to set up a centralized
European banking resolution authority and fund to break the link
between bank failures and state insolvency, saying that changes
to the European Union’s treaty may be required.  Amid efforts to establish a banking union, it is the
“uppermost priority” for  Germany  to press ahead with sealing
an agreement on the EU’s bank restructuring and closure
directive that includes so-called bail-in rules for bank
investors, the ministry said.  The report also said March tax revenue at the federal and
state level, minus municipal receipts, rose 5.7 percent compared
with a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
