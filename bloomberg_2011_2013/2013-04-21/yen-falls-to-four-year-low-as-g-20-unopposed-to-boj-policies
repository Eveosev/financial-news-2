The yen fell to a four-year low
against the dollar and Japanese stock futures rose after the
 Bank of Japan (8301) ’s stimulus policies were unopposed at a Group of
20 meeting.  The yen dropped to 99.78 per dollar, having briefly touched
99.98 per dollar, the weakest level since April 14, 2009.
Futures contracts on the  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  climbed 1.7
percent to 13,600 in  Chicago . Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
futures advanced 0.1 percent. Futures on Australia’s  S&P/ASX 200
Index (AS51)  gained 0.2 percent.  Meeting for the first time since the BOJ unleashed new
measures aimed at delivering 2 percent inflation within two
years, G-20 finance ministers reiterated a February vow to avoid
“competitive devaluation,” while stopping short of singling
 Japan  out for criticism. Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda
emerged from the talks saying he was emboldened to press ahead
with his campaign to defeat 15 years of deflation.  “The G-20 have decided not to view the aggressive stimulus
in Japan as a problem,” said Stewart Richardson, who helps
oversee $100 million as partner and chief investment officer at
RMG Wealth Management LLP in  London . “Traders will take this as
a green light to sell the yen.”  In a nod to concerns that stimulus in one economy often
creates challenges elsewhere and could fuel asset bubbles, the
G-20 officials meeting in Washington heightened their commitment
to being “mindful of unintended negative side-effects stemming
from extended periods of monetary easing.”  Kuroda Confident  Kuroda told reporters after the meeting that “winning
international understanding gives me more confidence to conduct
monetary policy appropriately. We will continue our qualitative
and quantitative easing for the next two years.”  China’s slower expansion in the first quarter is “normal”
as the world’s second-largest economy sacrifices growth to make
structural reforms, People’s Bank of China Governor  Zhou Xiaochuan  told Bloomberg News outside a meeting of the
International Monetary Fund in Washington on April 20. While a
“mild” slowdown in the global economy does have an impact on
China, the 7.7 percent growth rate in gross domestic product is
“overall normal” compared with the government’s 2013 target of
7.5 percent, Zhou said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
