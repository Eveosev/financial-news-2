West Texas Intermediate crude
traded near the highest price in a week as investors speculated
that declines over the past three weeks were excessive. Hedge
funds cut bullish bets on WTI by the most in almost two months.  Futures fluctuated in  New York  after gaining the past two
days. WTI fell in the seven days ended April 19 for a third
weekly decline, the longest run since November. Money managers
reduced net-long positions, or  wagers  that U.S. prices will
rise, by 6.8 percent in the week ended April 16, according to
the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s Commitments of
Traders report on April 19. It was the biggest drop since the
period ended Feb. 26.  “While we’re holding around this zone, the outlook is
starting to look more positive for oil,” said  Michael McCarthy ,
a chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney. “We should
see a floor under oil at current levels. A lot of the falls that
we’ve seen, not only in oil but other industrial commodities,
were related to the weaker growth numbers that we’ve seen out of
 China  and the U.S.”  WTI for May delivery, which expires today, was at $88.14 a
barrel, up 13 cents, in electronic trading on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  at 3:06 p.m. Singapore time. The more-active
June future was up 18 cents at $88.45. The volume of all
contracts traded was 10 percent below the 100-day average. Crude
gained 28 cents to $88.01 on April 19, the highest closing price
since April 16, while dropping 3.6 percent over the week.  Triangle Pattern  Brent for June settlement on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange slid 14 cents to $99.51 a barrel. The front-
month European benchmark grade was at a premium of $11.06 to
WTI, from $11.38 on April 19.  WTI for June delivery will probably rebound as futures stay
within a triangle pattern on the weekly chart going back to
September, Stephanie Aymes, a London-based technical analyst at
Societe Generale SA, said in a e-mailed report on April 19. The
technical formation has a lower and upper boundary of about $86
and $98 a barrel this week.  Net-long positions in WTI held by money managers, including
 hedge funds , commodity pools and commodity-trading advisers,
declined by 13,298 futures and options combined to 183,032, the
least since the week ended March 19, the CFTC report showed.
Hedge funds and other large speculators reduced bullish U.S.
gasoline wagers by 10,350 futures and options combined, or 16
percent, to 53,506. It was the lowest level since July.  Pump Prices  The average price for regular gasoline at U.S. pumps fell
11.04 cents a gallon in the past two weeks to $3.5363, according
to Lundberg Survey Inc. The survey covers the period ended April
19 and is based on information obtained at about 2,500 filling
stations by the Camarillo, California-based company. The average
price has dropped 25.87 cents from the peak on Feb. 22, and
37.64 cents from the price on April 20, 2012, Lundberg said.  The  International Monetary Fund  lowered its global economic
growth forecasts for 2013 on April 16. The projection for the
U.S., the world’s largest oil consumer, was cut to 1.9 percent
from 2 percent. China, the second-biggest crude user, was
reduced to 8 percent from 8.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
