El Al Israel Airlines Ltd. (ELAL)  fell the
most in more than four months as some flights leaving Ben-Gurion
International Airport were canceled as workers went on strike to
protest an agreement that would increase competition.  El Al shares  sank 8.5 percent, the most since Dec. 17, to
0.531 shekel at the close in  Tel Aviv . The shares have lost 13
percent since the Histadrut labor federation said on April 18 it
would strike until a proposed “Open Skies” agreement is
modified. The benchmark TA-25 Index fell less than 0.1 percent.  The strike began at 5 a.m. today, disrupting outgoing
flights of El Al and two smaller local carriers, Israir Airlines
& Tourism Ltd. and Arkia Israeli Airlines Ltd. The Israeli
Cabinet today approved the accord with the European Union,
designed to increase competition and lower fares by allowing
carriers on both sides to fly to more destinations.  “It’s a rarity but in this case, the interests of El Al’s
management and its employees are aligned in preventing this
agreement from going forward,” Adar Etzioni, head of research
at Migdal Capital Markets Ltd. in Tel Aviv, said today by phone.
“The Open Skies accord would threaten El Al by boosting
competition and it would force the company to lay off workers.”  Lower Prices  Ofer Eini, head of  Israel ’s national Histadrut labor
federation, urged the government to delay a vote on the
agreement in today’s Cabinet meeting and begin negotiations to
protect workers’ rights. Approving the agreement “could lead to
the collapse of the Israeli airlines,” Eini said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday.  The agreement will “lower the prices of flights to and
from Israel and increase incoming tourism,” Prime Minister
 Benjamin Netanyahu  said in an e-mailed statement following the
cabinet meeting.  El Al said the implementation of the agreement in its
current form is expected to adversely affect all Israeli
airlines, according to a statement filed to the Tel-Aviv Stock
Exchange today after the market closed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
