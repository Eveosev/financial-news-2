(Corrects yen low as data for  currency trading  corrected.)  The yen slid toward the 100 per
dollar level not seen for four years, extending its longest
streak of monthly losses in more than a decade, as the  Bank of
Japan (8301) ’s stimulus policies weren’t opposed by the Group of 20.  Japan ’s currency dropped against most of its 16 major
counterparts after BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda emerged from the
talks saying he was emboldened to press ahead with the campaign
to defeat deflation. The central bank meets this week after
pledging April 4 to double the monetary base in two years.
 Europe ’s 17-nation currency halted last week’s decline against
the greenback before Giorgio Napolitano is sworn in to a second
term as Italian president.  “There’s nothing really in our view to stop the yen from
continuing to weaken here,” said Ray Attrill, Sydney based
global co-head of currency strategy at National  Australia  Bank
Ltd. “We are having a little bit of tug-of-war, I think, up
close to 100. I’ve no doubt we’ll go through it at some point.”  Japan’s currency fell to 99.90 per dollar, the weakest
level since April 11,  before trading at 99.87 as of 10:47 a.m.
in  Tokyo , from 99.52 in  New York  on April 19. It was quoted at
99.98 at 3:22 a.m. Tokyo time, a level that hasn’t been seen
since April 14, 2009.  The yen has fallen 5.7 percent since the end of March, when
it completed a sixth-straight monthly drop in its longest losing
stretch since 2001.  The yen dropped 0.6 percent to 130.63 per euro. Against
Australia’s dollar, it fell 0.6 percent to 102.92 yen. The euro
advanced 0.2 percent to $1.3081, after declining 0.5 percent
last week.  Short Positions  “Winning international understanding gives me more
confidence to conduct monetary policy appropriately,” Kuroda
told reporters after the G-20 meeting. “We will continue our
qualitative and quantitative easing for the next two years.”  The BOJ is scheduled to deliver its next policy statement
on April 26.  Futures traders increased bets that the yen will decline
against the dollar, figures from the Washington-based Commodity
Futures Trading Commission showed last week. The  difference  in
the number of wagers by  hedge funds  and other large speculators
on a decline in the yen compared with those on a gain -- so-
called net shorts -- was 93,411 on April 16, compared with net
shorts of 77,697 a week earlier.  “The 2009 high comes in near 101.45 yen and is the next
immediate target,”  Marc Chandler , the New York-based global
head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co.,
wrote in an e-mailed note to clients. “That said, a failure to
break the 100 yen level convincingly, while Japanese investors
continue to sell foreign bonds, would hit the bearish yen
psychology.”  Selling Bonds  Japanese investors were net sellers of foreign bonds during
the week ended April 12 according to figures based on reports
from designated major investors released by the Ministry of
Finance last week. Japanese investors sold 331.9 billion yen
($3.3 billion) in overseas  bonds and notes , the data showed.  The yen has dropped 5.6 percent in the past month, the
worst performer among 10 developed nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation Weighted Indexes. The euro has risen 1
percent and the dollar has gained 0.4 percent.  In  Italy , Napolitano could begin consultations on a new
government as soon as tomorrow. The resignation of Democratic
Party leader Pier Luigi Bersani increases the chances that
Napolitano can convince the remnants of Bersani’s Democrats to
join a coalition with Silvio Berlusconi’s People of Liberty
party and end a stalemate that’s left Italy without a new
government eight weeks after elections.  “As long as we can avoid the inevitability of elections,
this weekend’s development is positive in that regard, then,
that provides a little bit of support under the euro,” said
Attrill at NAB.  To contact the reporters on this story:
