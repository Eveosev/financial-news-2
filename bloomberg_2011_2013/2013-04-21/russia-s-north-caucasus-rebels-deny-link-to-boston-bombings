Rebels in  Russia ’s North Caucasus
region denied any link to the April 15 attack on the Boston
Marathon in a statement posted on the  vdagestan.com  website.  “The Caucasian Mujahedeen are not fighting with the  United
States of America ,” according to the  statement , which was
attributed to unidentified Mujahedeen commanders in Dagestan.
“We are at war with Russia, which is responsible not only for
the occupation of the Caucasus, but also for heinous crimes
against Muslims.”  An FBI-led probe is looking into a six-month trip suspect
Tamerlan Tsarnaev, an immigrant of Chechen descent, took around
two years ago to Chechnya and neighboring Dagestan, both regions
of Russia that have been embroiled in Islamist separatist
movements.  Tamerlan, 26, was killed during a gunfight with the police
after two explosions on April 15 near the finish line of the
Boston Marathon that left three dead and more than 170 people
wounded. His 19-year-old brother, Dzhokar, is being held in a
Boston hospital where he is in serious condition after being
taken into custody April 19.  vdagestan.com claims to be the official website of what it
terms the “Dagestan Province of the Caucasus Emirate” and
features calls for jihad and images of Islamist fighters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
