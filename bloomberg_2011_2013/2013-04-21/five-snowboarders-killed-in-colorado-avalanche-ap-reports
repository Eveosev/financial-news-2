Five snowboarders have been killed
in an avalanche on Colorado’s Loveland Pass, the  Associated
Press  said, citing said Clear Creek County Sheriff Don Krueger.
A sixth snowboarder survived.  The victims’ bodies were recovered several hours after the
slide yesterday, which was about 600 feet (183 meters) wide and
eight feet deep, Krueger told AP.  Krueger said authorities were “pretty sure” the
snowboarders triggered the avalanche, the news agency reported.
The victims’ identities weren’t immediately known.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
