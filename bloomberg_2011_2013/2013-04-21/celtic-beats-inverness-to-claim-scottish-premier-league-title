Celtic beat Inverness Caledonian
Thistle 4-1 to win the Scottish Premier League and claim its
44th national soccer championship.  The hosts, needing a point to retain the title at Celtic
Park, got two Gary Hooper goals around one from Joe Ledley to
put away Inverness. Georgios Samaras scored in the 88th minute,
while Aaron Doran got a goal for the visitors in stoppage time.  The victory gives Celtic an unbeatable 15-point lead over
Motherwell, which beat Dundee United 3-1 two days ago, with four
games left in the season.  Celtic has now won a record eight Scottish Premier League
titles, one more than Rangers. The two Glasgow clubs have
combined to win every championship since the SPL began in 1998.  Rangers this season won the fourth-tier Third Division
title after being dropped from the SPL last July. The record 54-
time Scottish champion was put into the lower league for going
into liquidation after the U.K. tax authorities rejected a
proposal to allow the club to avoid bankruptcy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
