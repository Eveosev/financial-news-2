Dividends in the U.K. shrank by 25
percent in the first quarter, their first decline since 2010, as
drug companies and insurers cut their payments and last year’s
special distributions from Vodafone Group Plc and Cairn Energy
Plc weren’t repeated.  Payouts to shareholders by British companies decreased to
14.1 billion pounds ($21.5 billion) in the three months through
March from 18.8 billion pounds in the year-earlier period,
Capita Registrars said in a statement today, citing data from
Exchange Data International Ltd. Excluding one-time payments,
dividends grew 6.1 percent in the period.  “Dividends cannot continue to outstrip profit growth
indefinitely,” Justin Cooper, chief executive officer of Capita
Registrars, said in the statement. “While we do still expect
healthy growth, it will be at levels more consistent with the
performance in company profits.”  Pharmaceutical companies were the biggest drag on payouts
last quarter, according to Capita. In January,  AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) ,
the U.K.’s  second-largest drugmaker , cut its second interim
dividend to $1.90 a share from $1.95 a year earlier.  Vodafone,  Europe ’s biggest mobile-phone company, and Cairn
Energy, a U.K. oil explorer, paid a combined 4.4 billion pounds
in one-time dividends in the first quarter of 2012, Capita said.  Dividends at companies in the  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  will grow 7.4
percent this year after increasing 6.6 percent in 2012,
according to analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Capita forecast that U.K. dividends will total 80.5 billion
pounds in 2013, compared with 80.4 billion pounds in 2012.
Special payments will fall to 1.9 billion pounds from 6.8
billion pounds, Capita predicted.  To contact the reporter on this story:
