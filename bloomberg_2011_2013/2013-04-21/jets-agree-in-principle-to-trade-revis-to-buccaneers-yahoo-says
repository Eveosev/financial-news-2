The  New York  Jets have agreed in
principle to trade All-Pro cornerback  Darrelle Revis  to the
 Tampa Bay Buccaneers ,  Yahoo Sports  reported.  The Jets will get undisclosed draft picks and Revis will
have a long-term contract that will make him one of the highest-
paid non-quarterbacks in the  National Football League , Yahoo
said, citing multiple sources it didn’t identify.  An All-Pro choice in three of his first five seasons, Revis
played only two games last year before tearing a knee ligament.
His ability to limit the NFL’s best pass catchers earned him the
nickname “Revis Island,” a phrase he trademarked.  Revis is undergoing a physical examination today in Tampa
Bay and a final agreement with the Buccaneers may be reached
tonight or tomorrow morning, the report said.  The Jets are willing to let Revis go because the team was
almost $20 million over the league salary cap when General
Manager John Idzik arrived in January. If the Jets don’t trade
Revis or meet his salary demands they risk losing him without
compensation when he becomes an unrestricted free agent after
the 2013 season.  The Buccaneers have $28 million of salary cap space, giving
them the ability to match Revis’s demand of about $15 million to
$16 million a year in pay, Yahoo said.  The Jets had a combined 14-18 record to miss the playoffs
the past two seasons following back-to-back appearances in the
American Football Conference championship game.  The Buccaneers went 7-9 last season in Greg Schiano’s first
season as coach.  To contact the reporter on this story:
