The  World Bank  gave the first hints
of its new strategies crafted under the presidency of Jim Yong Kim during a development committee meeting yesterday, Russian
Deputy Finance Minister Sergei Storchak said.  The poverty-fighting lender, with projects ranging from
building bridges to education and health-care loans, plans to
focus on specific areas where it has “an obvious competitive
edge,” Storchak told reporters today in Washington. He was
attending the spring meetings of the bank and  International
Monetary Fund .  “The efforts of the bank will be concentrated on very
specific areas and will be very selective,” Storchak said.
“This is a general approach, what the main priorities will be
is still not clear.”  Earlier this month, Kim vowed to boost the lender’s
contribution to easing the effects of  climate change  as part of
a new goal to eliminate extreme poverty by 2030.  A physician by training, Kim took over the institution in
July 2012 and spent much of his first six months conferring with
staff and directors. With pressure from the largest emerging
economies, which are setting up their own  development bank , Kim
may need to demonstrate the value of a lender still dominated by
the richest nations.  The World Bank made loans worth almost $53 billion in the
fiscal year that ended June 30, 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
