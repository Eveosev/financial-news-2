     April 21 (Bloomberg) --Darrelle Revis has agreed to terms
with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, his agents Neil Schwartz and
Jonathan Feinsod said via their  Twitter account .   The  New York  Jets will get undisclosed draft picks and
Revis will have a long-term contract that will make one of the
highest-paid non-quarterbacks in the National Football League,
Yahoo reported today.  An All-Pro cornerback in three of his first five seasons,
Revis played only two games last year before tearing a knee
ligament. His ability to limit the NFL’s best pass catchers
earned him the nickname “Revis Island,” a phrase he
trademarked.  The Buccaneers have $28 million of salary cap space, giving
them the ability to match Revis’s demand of about $15 million to
$16 million a year in pay, Yahoo said.  The Jets had a combined 14-18 record to miss the playoffs
the past two seasons following back-to-back appearances in the
American Football Conference championship game.  The Buccaneers went 7-9 last season in Greg Schiano’s first
season as coach.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
