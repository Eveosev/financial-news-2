Giorgio Napolitano was sworn in for
a second term as Italian president, fueling hopes he can bring
an end to the country’s political gridlock two months after
inconclusive elections.  Italy’s two biggest coalitions pressed Napolitano to accept
another term after Parliament failed to elect a president in
five ballots that started on April 18. The standoff led to the
resignation of Democratic Party leader Pier Luigi Bersani, the
partial victor in February’s inconclusive vote, after his allies
scuttled his first two picks.  The Democratic Party and Former Prime Minister Silvio
Berlusconi’s People of Liberty set the stage on April 20 for a
possible coalition government by coming together to give
Napolitano another seven-years in office.  To contact the reporters on this story:
