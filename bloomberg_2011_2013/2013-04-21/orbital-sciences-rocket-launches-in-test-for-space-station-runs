An  Orbital Sciences Corp. (ORB)  rocket
lifted off in its first test flight as the company prepares to
eventually deliver cargo to the International Space Station.  Orbital’s Antares rocket launched at 5 p.m. Washington time
from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s Wallops
Flight Facility on Virginia’s Eastern Shore.  The Dulles, Virginia-based company isn’t sending an
unmanned spacecraft to the station in this practice run, which
involves only a simulated version of the supply ship. If the
test is successful, Orbital may begin regular deliveries to the
station as early as September under a $1.9 billion contract.  Orbital is following billionaire Elon Musk’s Space
Exploration Technologies Corp., which last May became the first
company to deliver cargo to the station.  Orbital’s first launch attempt on April 17 was scrubbed
about 12 minutes before liftoff because a data cable prematurely
disconnected from the rocket. An attempt yesterday was delayed
because of wind.  To contact the reporter on this story:
