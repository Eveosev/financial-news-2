France’s Raphael Jacquelin won a
marathon three-way playoff to clinch victory in golf’s Open de
Espana today.  Jacquelin, Germany’s Maximilian Kieffer and Felipe Aguilar
of  Chile  finished the regulation 72 holes on 283, 5-under par at
Parador de El Saler.  The sudden-death playoff then lasted until the ninth extra
hole, matching a European Tour record dating from the 1989 Dutch
Open. Jacquelin finally won with a birdie.  It was Jacquelin’s first win on the tour for just over two
years, and he picked up a check for 250,000 euros ($327,000).  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
