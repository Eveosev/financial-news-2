The combination of this month’s
retreat in global equities and gains by U.S. consumer stocks has
made American companies the five biggest in the world for the
first time in eight years.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ,  Apple Inc. (AAPL) , Google Inc.,  Berkshire
Hathaway (BRK/A)  Inc. and  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  are now the largest by
market value, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
PetroChina Co., one of three Chinese stocks in the top five last
year, slipped to No. 6. Two companies that relied on banking
profits, Citigroup Inc. and General Electric Co., fell out since
American firms last held the leading spots at the end of 2004.  The shift in the rankings, a barometer of investor
expectations for profits and economic growth, shows increasing
confidence in Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s $2.3
trillion of stimulus spending. Gains in retailers, computer-
device makers and media companies have preceded increases in
gross domestic product in the past as markets anticipated
improving consumer demand.  “U.S. authorities have done an incredible job of
maintaining the recovery and encouraging the consumer,” said
 Henk Potts , who helps oversee $282 billion as an equity
strategist at Barclays Wealth in London. His team ranks U.S.
shares as their top asset for 2013. “An aggressive policy is
working. The U.S. consumer is in great shape. That trend
continues to be very supportive of economic growth.”  Weekly Loss  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  fell  2.1 percent to
1,555.25 last week, its biggest loss in five months, as concern
the Fed will end its stimulus through bond buying sent copper
into a  bear market  and oil down 3.6 percent. Of 103  companies  in
the S&P 500 that posted earnings this month, 51 percent trailed
analyst sales forecasts, the most since 2009.  Since 2010, the stock market’s biggest retreats have
started  this time of year . The  S&P 500  fell 9.9 percent between
April 2 and June 1 in 2012, and 19 percent from April through
October 2011. The benchmark gauge climbed 0.5 percent to
1,562.50 at 4 p.m.  New York  time today.  Stocks with profits tied to American consumers have  led  a
130 percent advance in the S&P 500 since March 2009 after
trailing the index in the last  bull market . Wal-Mart, the
world’s biggest retailer, jumped 15 percent this year. Berkshire
Hathaway, the largest investor in Coca-Cola Co., is up 17
percent.  Largest Stocks  The rise of  U.S. companies  in world rankings comes as the
largest stocks in the world shrink. The average market value of
the 10 biggest was $273 billion this week, a 9.2 percent decline
from the end of the third quarter, even as the S&P 500 rose 5.8
percent in the period and the MSCI All-Country World Index of
developed and emerging economies advanced 6.2 percent.  No company in the world is worth more than $400 billion for
the first time since 2011. The balancing shows the breadth of
the  global rally.  Unlike in the 1990s, when gains were
concentrated in the largest companies, the advance since 2009
has been spread evenly among the S&P 500’s constituents. A  gauge
that strips out market bias  in calculating the S&P 500’s return
is up 190 percent since March 2009, or 1.5 times as much as the
market-weighted gauge.  Economic reports this month slowed the rally. The S&P 500
fell 0.4 percent on April 5 after the Labor Department said
employers added the fewest workers in nine months. It fell 0.3
percent a week later, when March retail sales unexpectedly fell,
according to the Commerce Department. In the days between the
reports, shares gained 2.6 percent.  Chinese Companies  U.S. companies got bigger as Chinese stocks shrunk. Losses
averaged 9 percent this year in three equities that occupied the
top five as recently as September: Beijing-based  PetroChina (857) ,
Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. the world’s most
profitable lender, and  China Mobile Ltd. (941) , the largest phone
company by users, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Economic expansion growth in China unexpectedly lost
momentum last quarter as gains in factory output and consumption
weakened, government figures April 15 showed. GDP rose 7.7
percent, less than the 8 percent median of economists’
forecasts. Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  lost 7.6 percent since
Jan. 30, while the Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index fell
to an almost four-year low in December.  “ China’s economy  has failed to live up to the expectations
priced into its stock market,” said Howard Ward, chief
investment officer at Rye, New York-based Gamco Investors Inc.,
which oversees $36.7 billion. “Our economy has generally
exceeded very low expectations.” The U.S. is “the better
risk/reward option,” he said.  Fed Debate  Concern the slowdown will hurt global growth just as the
Fed debates ending the bond-buying program known as quantitative
easing has sent the S&P 500 down 2.4 percent since reaching a
 record on April 11 . U.S. profit growth slowed last year to a
quarterly average of 4.7 percent, less than one-fifth the rate
during 2010 and 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “We need global GDP growth, we can’t do it in the U.S.
alone,” Barry Bannister, equity strategist at Stifel Nicolaus &
Co. in Baltimore, said in an April 17 phone interview. “We are
not going to hit new highs without global GDP.”  The  International Monetary Fund  cut its 2013 world growth
projection the last four quarters to 3.3 percent. That  compares
with  4.8 percent for 2012 and 5.7 percent in 2011, IMF data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  PetroChina Passed  The U.S. took over the biggest-companies ranking this month
when Wal-Mart’s 4.6 percent gain sent its market value to $258
billion, passing PetroChina. Shares of the store chain have
risen 6 percentage points more than the S&P 500 in 2013,
reaching a record high last week. The retailer may say in May
that  first-quarter earnings  rose 5 percent, according to analyst
estimates.  Berkshire Hathaway, the Omaha, Nebraska-based holding
company run by billionaire  Warren Buffett , climbed 17 percent
this year to become the world’s fourth-largest at $259 billion.
Buffett  said  March 1 that Berkshire’s five most profitable non-
insurance  units , which include toolmaker Iscar and chemical
company Lubrizol, will boost earnings in 2013.  Apple became the world’s most valuable company in January
2012, a spot it held for 12 months as consumer demand for its
iPhones and iPods helped more than double profits on record
revenue. At its largest in September 2012, the Cupertino,
California-based company was worth $658 billion, exceeding its
closest peer, Exxon, by about $240 billion. The 44 percent drop
since then left it at $374 billion, No. 2 on the list.  Google Rally  Google (GOOG)  increased 13 percent since the end of 2012 and its
market capitalization reached a record $278 billion in March.
The  Mountain View , California-based company, a member of the S&P
500  technology group , is up 4.4 percent since it reported
profits last week that topped analyst projections as advertisers
boosted spending on mobile and video promotions.  Gains in consumer stocks have preceded above-average
economic growth in past bull markets. Following quarters in
which they rallied the most or second-most in the S&P 500, GDP
expanded 3.1 percent, compared with the historic average of 2.9
percent, according to data since 1990 compiled by Bloomberg.  Consumer companies are  beating analyst earnings estimates 
by 4.3 percent so far this season, about 0.5 percentage point
more than the rate for the S&P 500. Of the 15 companies that
have reported, 11 have exceed analyst estimates.  Lennar, Mattel  Lennar Corp. (LEN) , the third-largest U.S. homebuilder, hit an
almost six-year high in March after posting better-than-
estimated profit and a 34 percent jump in orders.  Mattel Inc. (MAT) 
last week climbed the most in three months after the world’s
largest toymaker said profit and revenue beat estimates.  Out of the world’s top 50 companies by market value, 26 are
now American. That’s on track for the highest annual total since
2005. The number fell to 21 at the end of 2007, from as high as
35 in 2001, as losses in so-called subprime debt roiled
financial firms and pushed the U.S. into a recession.  “The U.S. looks like a bright spot within the developed
world,” said Tristan Hanson, who helps oversee about $1.5
billion as head of  asset allocation  at Ashburton Ltd. in London.
“The housing market is recovering, credit is recovering, the
labor market is recovering. You may be a bit frustrated with the
pace, but there is recovery there.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
