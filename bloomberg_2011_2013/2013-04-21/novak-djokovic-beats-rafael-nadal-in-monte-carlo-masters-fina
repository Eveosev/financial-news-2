Novak Djokovic beat  Rafael Nadal  in
straight sets in today’s final of tennis’s Monte Carlo Masters,
ending the Spaniard’s quest for a ninth straight title at the
clay-court tournament.  Serbia’s Djokovic, top-ranked by the ATP, defeated No. 5
Nadal 6-2, 7-6 (7-1).  Nadal, an 11-time Grand Slam winner, had won his previous
46 matches at the Monte Carlo event, including two victories
over Djokovic in finals. The pair hadn’t played each other since
the final of the 2012  French Open , Nadal’s last major title.  After dominating the first set today, Djokovic had to break
back twice to take the second set into a tie-break.  In March, Nadal beat Juan Martin del Potro to win his
record 22nd ATP World Tour Masters tennis title at the BNP
Paribas Open at  Indian Wells , California.  He’d returned in February after a seven-month layoff
because of a knee injury. Since then he’s also won clay-court
titles in Sao Paulo and Acapulco after a runner-up finish at his
comeback event in Chile.  To contact the reporter on this story:
