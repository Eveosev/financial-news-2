General Motors Co. (GM)  plans to more
than triple sales of its luxury Cadillac brand in China by 2015
by targeting affluent buyers in smaller cities as competition
intensifies in the world’s largest auto market.  GM will introduce Cadillac’s global portfolio to China and
add one locally produced model a year through 2016, according to
Bob Socia, GM’s China head. The Detroit-based automaker plans to
expand the number of dealerships for the brand in China to 200
this year, up from 70 outlets in 2011.  “At the moment, tier-one cities’ market is large but the
market is getting saturated,” Kevin Chen, general director of
the Cadillac division at Shanghai GM, said yesterday in an
interview at the Shanghai Auto Show. “But tier-two and tier-
three, there’s high potential for growth.”  GM Chief Executive Officer Dan Akerson has set a goal for
the luxury brand to be competitive with Bayerische Motoren Werke
AG’s BMW and  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Audi. To achieve that, Cadillac has
to close the gap with the German luxury marques in China, where
McKinsey & Co. forecasts luxury auto sales will more than double
to three million by 2020 from last year.  GM sold 30,010 Cadillacs in China last year, trailing
Audi’s 405,838, BMW’s 327,341 and  Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Mercedes-Benz at
196,211 units, according to company figures.  To help attract Chinese consumers, GM signed up actor Brad Pitt to help promote Cadillac. The automaker is targeting to
sell 100,000 units a year in the country in 2015, accounting for
10 percent of the luxury market, according to Socia.  Most of the Cadillacs sold in  China  would be built in the
country to lower costs and protect against currency fluctuation,
Socia told reporters on April 20. Companies pay a 25 percent
tariff on imported vehicles, making them less competitive
against locally made autos.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
