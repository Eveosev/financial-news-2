The Miami Heat and Oklahoma City
Thunder opened their first-round National Basketball Association
playoff series by winning by a combined 52 points, as home teams
improved their postseason start to 8-0.  Miami, the defending NBA champion and top seed in the
Eastern Conference, beat the Milwaukee Bucks 110-87 yesterday as
LeBron James had 27 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists.  The Thunder, the No. 1 seed in the West, routed the Houston
Rockets 120-91 behind 24 points from  Kevin Durant  and a 19-
point, 10-assist, 8-rebound effort from  Russell Westbrook .  “We just wanted to take care of our home court,” Durant
said in a televised interview. “We didn’t do anything yet.
We’ve just got to continue to get better.”  The  San Antonio  Spurs and Indiana Pacers also had Game 1
playoff wins yesterday, with the Spurs beating the Los Angeles
Lakers 91-79 and the Pacers topping the Atlanta Hawks 107-90.
It’s the first time since the 2003-04 postseason that home teams
won the opening game in all eight first-round series.  Oklahoma City, Indiana and San Antonio also host the second
games in the best-of-seven series on April 24. There are two NBA
games scheduled for today, with the Brooklyn Nets hosting the
 Chicago Bulls  in the East and the Memphis Grizzlies visiting the
Los Angeles Clippers in the West.  The Heat opened their playoff campaign by shooting 56
percent against the eighth-seeded Bucks. James hit 9-of-11 shots
while finishing two assists shy of a triple-double.  Dwyane Wade added 16 points for Miami, which will host Game
2 tomorrow.  In Oklahoma City, the Thunder raced to a 13-2 lead in the
opening minutes and cruised to the win over eighth-seeded
Houston. Serge Ibaka added 17 points for Oklahoma City.  Spurs’ Win  In San Antonio,  Tim Duncan  had 17 points and 10 rebounds as
the Spurs, seeded second in the West, jumped out to a 12-point
first-quarter lead. The seventh-seeded Lakers never got closer
than four points the rest of the way.  Manu Ginobili and  Tony Parker  each had 18 points for the
Spurs, who improved to 36-6 at home this season.  Dwight Howard  had 20 points and 15 rebounds to lead the
Lakers, who made the playoffs by ending the regular-season with
a five-game winning streak. Los Angeles is without five-time NBA
champion  Kobe Bryant , who suffered a ruptured left Achilles
tendon on April 13.  In Indianapolis, Paul George led the Pacers with 23 points,
11 rebounds and 12 assists, helping Indiana rebound after losing
five of seven games to end the regular season.  Triple-Double  George hit his first 17 free throws before missing his
final foul shot and finished with Indiana’s first triple-double
in the postseason since Mark Jackson on May 13, 1998.  George Hill  added 18 points and Roy Hibbert had 16 points
and eight rebounds for the third-seeded Pacers.  Jeff Teague  had
21 points for the sixth-seeded Hawks.  Two days ago, the  New York  Knicks rallied past the Boston
