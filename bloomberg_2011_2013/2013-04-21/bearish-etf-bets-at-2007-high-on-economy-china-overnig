Bets (FXI)  on declines in the largest
Chinese exchange-traded fund are surging to the highest level
since 2007 on concern a slowdown in the world’s second-largest
economy will stifle company earnings.  Short interest on the  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund 
climbed to 48.6 million shares, or 3.2 percent of the total
outstanding at the end of March, the most since June 2007, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN) 
of the most-traded Chinese stocks in the U.S. slumped 1.1
percent in  New York  last week, led by solar manufacturers.  Chinese economic growth slowed to 7.7 percent in the first
three months of this year, government data released April 15
showed, missing the 8 percent median economist estimate. The
Bloomberg China-US gauge fell to 11.7 times  estimated earnings 
two days later, the cheapest level since September. Investors
withdrew $256 million from the iShares ETF this month through
April 18, after taking out $824 million in March, the most since
January 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “I am cautious,” Elena Ogram, who holds fewer Chinese
stocks than global benchmarks in her $50 million portfolio of
emerging-market assets at Bank Bellevue AG, said by phone from
Zurich April 18. “There’s more uncertainty and less visibility.
I am not expecting spectacular earnings from Chinese
companies.”  Of the 55 companies on the China-US stock measure, 16 are
scheduled to report quarterly earnings this week, including
 China  Life Insurance Co., Yanzhou Coal Mining Co.,  Guangshen
Railway Ltd. (GSH) ,  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (386)  and Baidu Inc.  Bona Film Group Ltd. (BONA) , a Beijing-based film company, has
lost 4.7 percent since April 1 when it unexpectedly reported
earnings losses for the fourth quarter.  Sinopec Earnings  Adjusted income for China Petroleum, Asia’s largest
refiner known as Sinopec, will probably decline to 0.22
 yuan  (3.6 cents) per share for the first quarter, from 0.24 yuan
the previous three months, according to the average of two
analysts estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The company is scheduled 
to report results April 25.  American depositary receipts of Beijing-based Sinopec 
tumbled 4 percent to $108.93 last week, the steepest weekly
drop since February.  The iShares ETF ended last week 0.1 percent higher at
$36.05, after sliding to the lowest level since Sept. 28 April
17. The fund, which tracks the  FTSE China 25 Index (XIN0I)  of the
biggest Chinese companies, has slumped 11 percent this year, led
by a 25 percent  decline  in Hong Kong-listed shares of China Coal
Energy Co. and a 24 percent slide in shoe retailer  Belle
International Holdings Ltd. (1880)   Slowdown `Normal'  The expansion of the Chinese economy accelerated for the
first time in eight quarters at the end of 2012, stoking
optimism that the nation would drive a global recovery. The 
disappointing first-quarter gross domestic product data pushed 
the  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  to the lowest level since Dec. 24 
April 15. The gauge of domestic Chinese stocks rallied 1.7 percent 
last week.  Shares of the China ETF on loan, or short interest, doubled
from 24.8 million at the end of March 2012, Bloomberg data show.
The short interest increased to 3.2 percent of total outstanding
shares, from 1.39 percent a year earlier. Short sales involve
borrowing a security such as a stock, then selling it in
anticipation of a price decline.  The slower expansion in the first quarter is ``normal'' as
China sacrifices economic growth to make structural reforms,
People's Bank of China Governor  Zhou Xiaochuan  said in an interview
at a meeting of the  International Monetary Fund  in  Washington 
April 20.   Telecom Gains  China Telecom Corp., the nation’s biggest fixed-line
carrier, rallied 3.6 percent April 19 to $48.33, trimming its
weekly decline to 0.1 percent, after Morgan Stanley rated the
company a top pick. The Beijing-based company has “strong
execution, better earnings visibility and a rising dividend
yield,” analysts led by Navin Killa wrote in a note April 19.  China Unicom (CHU) , the country’s second-largest mobile-phone
company, advanced 7.1 percent last week, the biggest five-day
gain since November, to $13.68. China added 13.7 million new
mobile phone subscribers in March, compared with 9.93 million in
February, data from the Beijing-based Ministry of Information
Industry show.  Guangshen Railway Ltd., which runs the only train line
linking mainland China to  Hong Kong , climbed 7 percent last
week, the most in more than a month to $24.77 in U.S. trading.
Shenzhen-based Guangshen and Daqin Railway Co. will benefit most
from the reorganization of the Chinese rail system, China Galaxy
Securities said in a note April 19.  Slumping Solars  E-House China Holdings Ltd. (EJ) , a property agent based in
 Shanghai , increased 9.2 percent in the week, the most since
January, to $4.64. E-House posted the biggest advance on the 
China-US index last week.  Housing prices in Guangzhou rose 11.1 percent from a year
earlier, while those in Beijing climbed 8.6 percent and Shanghai
posted a 6.4 percent increase, the National Bureau of Statistics
said April 18. All cities showed the biggest gains since January 
2011 when the government changed its methodology for the data.  LDK Solar Ltd., (LDK)  once the world’s second-biggest maker of
wafers used in solar panels, slipped 11 percent to $1.08 last
week after it reported a seventh consecutive loss in the
fourth quarter. Suntech Power Holdings Co., whose main unit was
forced into bankruptcy after defaulting on a $541 million bond
repayment last month, declined 13 percent to 65 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
