The New York Rangers got a pair of
goals from  Ryan Callahan  in a 4-1 win over the New Jersey Devils
that eliminated their division rivals from National Hockey
League playoff contention.  Taylor Pyatt and Derek Stepan also had goals for the
Rangers (24-17-4), who won their third straight game to pull
even with the Ottawa Senators for the  seventh playoff seed  in
the Eastern Conference at 52 points. The Rangers have three
regular-season games remaining, starting tomorrow at the  Florida
Panthers .  “We are playing some of our most consistent hockey at an
important time,” Rangers coach  John Tortorella  told reporters.
“I don’t know if it’s because of where we are at in the
standings, but I hope we continue it.”  The Devils fell to 17-18-10 and will miss out on the
Stanley Cup playoffs for the second time in three years.  The Columbus Blue Jackets also continued their playoff push
by beating the San Jose Sharks 4-3 on Ryan Johansen’s goal with
one minute, 37 seconds remaining. The Blue Jackets (22-17-7)
tied the Minnesota Wild for the seventh playoff spot in the
Western Conference, three points ahead of Detroit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
