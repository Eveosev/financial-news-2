Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will miss the  Jackson Hole  monetary policy conference
this year, Reuters said, citing an unidentified Fed spokeswoman.  Bernanke is currently not planning to attend the meeting in
August because of a “personal scheduling conflict,” Reuters
cited the spokeswoman as saying. It would be the first time that
Bernanke will miss the event since taking charge of the Fed in
2006, and the first time in 25 years that a Fed chairman will
not attend the meeting, Reuters said.  Calls by  Bloomberg News  to two spokesmen for Bernanke
weren’t answered.  Bernanke has used the symposium of global central bankers
and economists, held annually in Jackson Hole,  Wyoming  to signal
the Fed’s monetary-policy intentions. Last year, he said at the
event that he wouldn’t rule out a third round of quantitative
easing to spur U.S. economic growth.  U.S. gross domestic product rose at a 3.1 percent annual
rate in the first quarter after expanding at a 0.4 percent pace
in the final three months of 2012, according to the median
forecast of 67 economists surveyed by Bloomberg ahead of
Commerce Department data due April 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
