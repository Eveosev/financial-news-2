Carmelo Anthony scored a game-high
36 points to help the New York Knicks beat the  Boston  Celtics
85-78 in the first game of their best-of-seven National
Basketball Association playoff series.  In the second Eastern Conference game yesterday, the
Brooklyn Nets routed the Chicago Bulls 106-89. In the Western
Conference, the Denver Nuggets defeated the Golden State
Warriors 97-95 and the Los Angeles Clippers beat the Memphis
Grizzlies 112-91.  In today’s games, the defending champion and top-seeded
Miami Heat host the Milwaukee Bucks and the Atlanta Hawks travel
to the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference games, while the
Houston Rockets entertain the top-seeded Oklahoma City Thunder
and San Antonio Spurs are home against the Los Angeles Lakers in
the Western Conference.  The second-seeded Knicks were down 70-63 with one minute,
20 seconds left in the third quarter after Paul Pierce’s 3-
pointer at Madison Square Garden.  New York  then scored 18 points
and held Boston to eight in the fourth quarter.  “We stayed with it,” Anthony, the Knicks’ leading scorer,
said in a televised interview. “We knew we were making minor
mistakes. We corrected them.”  J.R. Smith had 15 points and Raymond Felton added 13 for
the Knicks, who host Game 2 on April .  Jeff Green led the Celtics with 26 points, followed by
Pierce with 21 and Avery Bradley with 15.  Nets Win  At Barclays Center, Deron Williams had 22 points and Brook
Lopez contributed 21 points as the Nets made their first playoff
appearance since 2007.  “As good a year as we’ve had, I think we’re still fighting
for more respect,” Nets interim coach P.J. Carlesimo told
reporters. “It will come from us advancing.”  The Nets moved out to a 25-point halftime advantage, 60-35,
hitting 16 of 20 shots in the second quarter.  “That was a hell of a performance,” Carlesimo said. “I
thought we competed extremely well, defended extremely well, and
we pushed the ball and shared the ball.”  The fourth-seeded Nets expanded their lead by as many as 28
points at nine minutes, six seconds into the third quarter on
Gerald Wallace’s free throw which gave Brooklyn a 70-42 lead at
Barclays Center.  Carlos Boozer had 25 points and Nate Robinson came off the
bench to score 17 points for the fifth-seeded Bulls, who visit
the Nets for Game 2 on April 22.  Nuggets Win  In the Western Conference, Andre Miller hit a driving layup
with one second left to give the Nuggets a 1-0 playoff lead over
the Warriors at the Pepsi Center in Denver.  The Nuggets, trailing 48-44 at the half, outscored the
Warriors 27-16 in the third quarter and then watched Golden
State, trailing by as much as eight points, tie the game in the
fourth quarter at 81-81 on Stephen Curry’s layup with seven
minutes, 13 seconds left in the game.  Golden State was behind by eight three minutes later when
Miller’s free throw gave the Nuggets an 89-81 lead. Curry made a
23-foot 3-pointer with 14 seconds left to catch up 95-95. Miller
hit the basket for the win.  Miller came off the bench to score 28 points and Ty Lawson
