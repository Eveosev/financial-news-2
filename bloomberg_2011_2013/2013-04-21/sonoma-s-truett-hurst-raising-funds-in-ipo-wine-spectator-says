Sonoma County wine company
Truett-Hurst is planning to raise a net $26.5 million through
an initial public offering of stock, Wine Spectator reported.  The company, which owns Sonoma brands Truett-Hurst, VML,
Healdsburg Ranches and Bradford Mountain and bottles private
labels for Trader Joe’s Co., Total Wine & More and  Safeway Inc. (SWY) ,
more than doubled sales last year to $12.7 million from $5.4
million in 2011, Wine Spectator said. Partners Phil Hurst, Paul
and Heath Dolan and Bill Hambrecht, founder of W.R. Hambrecht +
Co., are behind the offering, according to Wine Spectator.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
