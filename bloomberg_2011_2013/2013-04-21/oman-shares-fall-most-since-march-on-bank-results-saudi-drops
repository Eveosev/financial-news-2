Oman’s  benchmark stock index 
dropped the most in three weeks after the nation’s banks
reported first-quarter profit that missed analysts’ estimates.  Muscat-based  Bank Sohar (BKSB)  posted its biggest drop in almost a
month. Bank Muscat SAOG, the sultanate’s largest lender which
last week said quarterly profit fell 25 percent, lost 1.4
percent. The banks were the biggest decliners on the benchmark
 MSM30 Index (MSM30) , which retreated 0.9 percent to 6,144.98 at the
close in the Omani capital. The Bloomberg GCC 200 Index lost 0.2
percent at 2:30 p.m. in Riyadh.  Bank Sohar fell for a third day, trimming its gain this
year to 7.4 percent, after the lender’s first-quarter profit of
6.1 million rials ($16 million) missed the 6.3 million-rial
median estimate of  three analysts  compiled by Bloomberg. Bank
Muscat’s quarterly net income came in 23 percent below estimates
last week after the lender booked a provision and said net
interest margins were squeezed. The shares are up 7.6 percent
this year.  “This is simply profit booking that got accelerated by the
less-than-impressive results of banks,” said Adel Waleed Nasr,
local brokerage manager at United Securities LLC in Muscat.
“The steep rise in shares of holding and investment companies
have helped raise expectations.”  Oman National Investment Corp.  slumped  4.7 percent, the
most since May 14, while  Gulf Investment Services Co. (GISI)  lost 3.4
percent, the most since July 24. Bank Sohar fell 3.1 percent to
0.189 rial. Bank Muscat decreased to 0.620 rial, the lowest
since April 3.  Sipchem Profit  Oman’s index was the biggest decliner in the six-nation
Gulf Cooperation Council, where measures in  Saudi Arabia  and
Bahrain dropped 0.2 percent and 0.5 percent, respectively.  Saudi
International Petrochemical Co. (SIPCHEM)  fell 1.1 percent after the
company reported a 57 percent slump in  first-quarter profit .  Abu Dhabi ’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  rose 0.3 percent and Dubai’s
DFM General Index increased 0.5 percent. Kuwait’s SE Price Index
was the GCC’s  biggest gainer , advancing 0.6 percent, while
Qatar’s QE Index rose less than 0.1 percent. Egypt’s EGX 30
Index fell 0.1 percent, led by  Orascom Construction Industries (OCIC) ,
which decreased 0.7 percent.  In Israel, the benchmark  TA-25 Index (TA-25)  gained 0.1 percent and
the yield on the government’s benchmark 4.25 percent bonds
maturing in 2023 fell for a fifth day, losing two basis points,
or 0.02 of a percentage point, to 3.65 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
