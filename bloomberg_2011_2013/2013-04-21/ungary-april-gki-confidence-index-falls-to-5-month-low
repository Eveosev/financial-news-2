Hungary’s  economic-sentiment  index
deteriorated to its weakest level in five months in April,
driven by a plunge in business confidence.  The index fell to minus 21.7, the worst since November,
from minus 18.5 in March, the GKI research institute in Budapest
said in an e-mailed statement. The consumer-confidence gauge
declined to minus 38.9 from minus 37.3, while business
confidence dropped to minus 15.6, the worst since September,
from minus 11.9.  Hungary’s  economy  is in its second recession in four years
after the euro-area crisis cut export demand and domestic
consumption declined. The government raised taxes on energy,
retail, telecommunication companies and levied the highest bank
tax in  Europe , curbing lending and investment.  “The biggest deterioration in sentiment was among
manufacturing companies, a similar degree of pessimism in the
sector was last seen in autumn 2009,” GKI said.  Gross domestic product will fall 0.1 percent this year
after shrinking 1.7 percent in 2012, the European Commission
said Feb. 22. The government lowered its growth forecast for
this year to 0.7 percent from 0.9 percent previously.  GKI’s indexes are calculated as a balance of positive and
negative answers to questions about the outlook for the economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
