Boston Scientific Corp. (BSX) , the second-
biggest maker of implanted heart devices, won an appeals court
ruling in a patent-infringement case against Johnson & Johnson.  The  U.S. Court of Appeals  for the Federal Circuit in
 Washington   today  upheld a lower court ruling that four patents
on drug-coated stents owned by J&J’s Cordis unit are invalid
because the company failed to accurately describe the invention.
The case is one of multiple disputes between J&J and Boston
Scientific over stents, mesh tubes that prop open arteries.  The decision may also benefit  Abbott Laboratories (ABT) , which is
being sued by Cordis over the same technology and had won a
district court ruling last year that the patents were invalid.
 Abbott Park , Illinois-based Abbott makes Xience stents and
licenses the Promus stent to Natick, Massachusetts-based Boston
Scientific.  Cordis’s Cypher stent uses rapamycin, also called
sirolimus, to limit the growth of scar tissue that can cause the
artery to narrow. Cordis’s patents were for compounds derived
from rapamycin, and the appeals court ruling centered on whether
scientists had actually done research on derivatives as Cordis
claimed or the company merely added language to the patent that
any potential analog is covered.  The case stemmed from Boston Scientific lawsuits that
sought rulings that the Promus stent wasn’t infringing the
patents. Promus uses the compound everolimus to prevent tissue
growth.  Boston Scientific last year agreed to pay New Brunswick,
New Jersey-based J&J $1.73 billion to end some of the other
patent lawsuits between the companies over stent technology.  The case is Boston Scientific Corp. v.  Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) ,
2010-1230, 2010-1231; 2010-1233; and 2010-1234, U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Washington). The lower court
cases are Boston Scientific Corp. v. Johnson & Johnson, 07cv033,
07cv0348, 07cv409, 07cv765, all U.S. District Court for the
District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
