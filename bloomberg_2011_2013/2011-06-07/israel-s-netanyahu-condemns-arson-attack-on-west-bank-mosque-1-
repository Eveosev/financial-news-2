Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned an apparent arson attack against a  West Bank 
mosque overnight. “This was a criminal act whose purpose was to
create a provocation,” Netanyahu said in a text message from
his office today.  The mosque in a village near Ramallah suffered some fire
damage after a burning tire was thrown inside it, Israeli police
spokesman  Micky Rosenfeld  said. The outside of the mosque was
also defaced with graffiti, Rosenfeld said, including the Hebrew
expression “price tag.”  This expression is used by some members of the Jewish
settler community in the West Bank to describe retaliatory
actions against the removal of unauthorized settlement outposts.
One such outpost was evacuated by Israel this week.  The U.S. condemned the attack. “All sides must do all they
can to prevent attacks and incitement of this kind,” said Tommy Vietor, National Security Council spokesman. “We note the
Israeli government’s condemnation of this attack and call for
the perpetrators to be held accountable.”  Peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians stalled
shortly after they began in September 2010. Negotiators for both
sides met with Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  in  Washington 
this week to discuss restarting the talks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
