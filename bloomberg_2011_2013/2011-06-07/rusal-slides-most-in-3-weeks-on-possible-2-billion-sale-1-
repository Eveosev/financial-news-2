United Co. Rusal, the world’s largest
aluminum producer, dropped the most in three weeks after the
company was said to be considering a share sale of as much as $2
billion to reduce debt.  The company’s depositary receipts slid 2.5 percent to
387.99 rubles by the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, their biggest
one-day loss since May 16.  The stock dropped as much as 1.7 percent yesterday after
two people familiar with the matter said Rusal may sell new
shares equating to a stake of 7 percent to 10 percent, for a
value of about $1.5 billion to $2 billion. Rusal’s shares listed
in  Hong Kong  slumped as much as 4.6 percent to HK$10.80 today.  Investors expect the company to offer “a solid discount”
if the offering goes ahead, Marat Gabitov, an equity analyst at
Unicredit SpA in Moscow, said in an e-mailed report today. While
the valuation range implies a discount of as much as 6 percent,
investors could demand a higher one at the actual placement,
Gabitov said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
