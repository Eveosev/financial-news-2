The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign debt was little changed in  Europe , according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of swaps on 40 companies
with mostly high-yield credit ratings declined 2 basis points to
387, and the Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 investment-grade
companies fell 0.5 to 103.25, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.
A decline signals improvement in perceptions of  credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments rose 1 basis point to 189, according to CMA.
Contracts on  Greece  increased 5 to 1,396, Ireland rose 2 basis
points to 652 and Portugal climbed 3.5 to 678.5 while Spain rose
2 to 243, Italy increased 1 to 151 and  Belgium  was 1 higher at
135.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers decreased 1 basis point to 152.5 and the
subordinated index was 1 lower at 253.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.7 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
