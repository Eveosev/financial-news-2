Liberty Media Corp. said Bank of New
York Mellon Trust Company NA has appealed a  Delaware  Court of
Chancery ruling that the pending splitoff of the Liberty Capital
and Liberty Starz tracking stock groups won’t constitute
disposition of the assets of Liberty Media LLC.  John C. Malone, the billionaire chairman of Liberty Media,
won a ruling in April from Judge J. Travis Laster that his
splitoff of the Capital Group and Starz Group won’t violate an
agreement involving Bank of New York Mellon.  Liberty Media asked the Delaware  Supreme Court  to expedite
the appeal “and hopes to complete the splitoff prior to Sept.
23, which is the last trading day” available under terms of the
contract, the company said in a statement today.  Liberty sued the bank as bond trustee in August 2010 asking
the Wilmington court to declare that the action wouldn’t be a
disposition of assets upon which bondholders had claims.  The case is Liberty Media Corp. v. Bank of New York Mellon
Trust Co., CA5702, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
