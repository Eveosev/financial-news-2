Lebanon froze the assets of the North
Africa Commercial Bank S.A.L. to enforce United Nations
sanctions against the regime of Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi ,
An Nahar newspaper reported.  The move will not affect the local market as the bank
maintains limited activities in Lebanon, said the Beirut-based
 newspaper .  The North Africa Commercial Bank, founded in 1973 in
 Beirut , is majority-owned by the Libyan Foreign Bank, which
holds a 99.54 percent stake, the bankâ€™s  website  said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
