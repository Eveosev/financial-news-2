Extract Resources Ltd. (EXT)  said it’s in
discussions to sell a stake in its Husab uranium project to
Namibia’s state-owned Epangelo Mining Co.  “We continue to have discussions with Epangelo,” Chief
Executive Officer Jonathan Leslie said in a phone interview
today from London. The talks with the government involve a
potential “transaction on a commercial basis,” he said.  Extract, the uranium explorer 43 percent owned by  Kalahari
Minerals Plc (KAH) , expects Husab to become the second-biggest uranium
deposit in the world, Leslie said. Extract has “no reason for
concern” on its application for a mining license in Namibia, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
