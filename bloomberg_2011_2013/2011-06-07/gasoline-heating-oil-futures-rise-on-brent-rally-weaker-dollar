Gasoline rose in  New York  on
speculation refinery outages may tighten supply and as Brent
crude in London rallied.  Futures gained as much as 1.5 percent as Valero Energy
Corp.’s 310,000-barrel-a-day refinery in  Port Arthur , Texas, had
a power disruption causing unit shutdowns yesterday. The U.S.
currency touched a one-month low against the euro. Brent oil
rose as a report that Iranian submarines had entered the Red
Sea increased concern that Middle East tensions would spread.  “Products are getting led up by Brent and on the stronger
euro,” said  Phil Flynn , vice president of research at PFGBest
in Chicago.  Gasoline for July delivery advanced 1.95 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $2.9694 a gallon at 10:01 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange .  Brent crude  gained 75 cents to $115.23 a barrel on the
London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The dollar sank 0.6
percent to $1.4666 versus the euro, the lowest intraday level
since May 5.  “The dollar is getting whacked this morning,” said
Dominick Chirichella, senior partner at the Energy Management
Institute in New York.  Gasoline stockpiles probably rose 1.05 million barrels last
week, according to the median estimate of 14 analysts in a
survey by Bloomberg News. Inventories of distillates, including
diesel and heating oil, likely increased 1.25 million barrels.  The Energy Department is scheduled to report last week’s
inventories at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in Washington.  Regular gasoline at the pump fell 1 cent to $3.761 a
gallon, AAA said on its website.  Heating oil for July delivery added 0.96 cent, or 0.3
percent, to $3.027 a gallon on the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
