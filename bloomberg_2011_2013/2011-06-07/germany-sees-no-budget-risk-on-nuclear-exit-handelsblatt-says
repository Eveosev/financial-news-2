Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s plan to
close  Germany ’s nuclear power plants by 2022 won’t trigger
indemnity payments to the reactor operators,  Handelsblatt 
reported, citing Norbert Barthle, the budget spokesman in
parliament for Merkel’s  Christian Democratic Union .  The shutdown of Germany’s oldest reactors after the nuclear
incident in  Japan  is legally sound, the newspaper cited Barthle
as saying. The German government’s decision last year to levy a
tax on nuclear fuels was made independently of an extension of
nuclear plants’ operating lives that has since been reversed, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
