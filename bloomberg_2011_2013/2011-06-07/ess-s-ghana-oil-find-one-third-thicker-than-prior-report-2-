Hess Corp. (HES) , the New York-based oil
company, said it found crude and natural-gas condensate one-
third thicker than previously reported in its Paradise well off
 Ghana .  The three layers of oil total 490 feet (150 meters) thick,
Hess said in a statement today. That compares with 370 feet in
two intervals the company reported on April 27, before drilling
an additional 1,100 feet to a total depth of 16,436 feet.  It’s the second discovery reported off Ghana this week.
Kosmos Energy Ltd., based in Dallas, reported an oil deposit 3
meters thick yesterday in its Banda exploration well in the
adjacent West Cape Three Points lease.  “Hess needs to accelerate its production growth to be more
in line with peers,” Brian Youngberg, a St. Louis-based analyst
for Edward Jones & Co. who rates the shares “buy” and owns
none, said today in a telephone interview. “Exploratory finds
go a long way toward helping that and Ghana so far this year has
been the biggest find.”  Hess operates the well in the Deepwater Tano / Cape Three
Points area and owns 90 percent of it, according to the
statement. Ghana National Petroleum Corp., the state-owned  oil
company , owns the remainder.  The Hess announcement was made before regular trading began
on U.S. markets. Hess rose 87 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $75.25
at 8:11 a.m. in  New York . Before today, the shares have fallen
2.8 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
