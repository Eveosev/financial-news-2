Gold futures fell from a five-week
high as European debt concerns eased, eroding the appeal of the
precious metal as a haven.  The euro reached a one-month high against the dollar after
the  European Central Bank  signaled its approval of Greek bond
rollovers. Yesterday, gold reached $1,555 an ounce, the highest
since advancing to a record $1,577.40 on May 2.  “The  risk premium  has come out of gold,” said Matt Zeman,
a strategist at Kingsview Financial in Chicago. “People are not
quite as nervous about  Greece .”  Gold futures for August delivery fell $3.20, or 0.2
percent, to settle at $1,544 at 1:47 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. The decline pared this year’s gain to 8.6 percent.  Gold’s losses may continue to accelerate after the metal
failed to rally toward a record yesterday, said Tom Pawlicki, an
analyst at MF Global Ltd. in  Chicago .  “The immediate focus of the market will be on yesterday’s
bearish reversal,” Pawlicki said. “The reversal was made after
the market broke out to a new one-month high, which suggests
that the breakout was rejected.”  Still, the price may reach $1,650 over the next few months,
Pawlicki said.  The  Federal Reserve  has said it will stop buying Treasuries
as part of its so-called quantitative easing program at the end
of the month.  “There are still lingering questions on whether the Fed
will continue to pump money into the financial system, which is
negative for the dollar and positive for gold,” said Zeman of
Kingsview.  Silver futures for July delivery rose 26.4 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $37.046 an ounce on the Comex.  Palladium futures for September delivery climbed $10.80, or
1.4 percent, to $809.50 an ounce on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange. Earlier, the price rose as much as 1.6 percent to a
three-month high of $811.80.  Platinum futures for July delivery rose $9.50, or 0.5
percent, to $1,830.70 an ounce on the Nymex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
