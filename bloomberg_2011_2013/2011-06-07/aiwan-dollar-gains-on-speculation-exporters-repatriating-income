Taiwan ’s dollar rose for a second day
on speculation exporters were repatriating income in
anticipation of further appreciation.  Overseas sales climbed 25 percent from a year earlier to a
record $27.3 billion in April and the currency has strengthened
5.7 percent this year, the most among Asia’s 10 most-used
currencies. Government data tomorrow is expected to show exports
rose 8.7 percent in May, according to the median forecast in a
Bloomberg survey of economists.  The  Taiwan dollar  rose 0.1 percent to NT$28.728 against its
U.S. counterpart as of 9:59 a.m. local time, from NT$28.750 on
June 3, according to Taipei Forex Inc. Financial markets were
closed yesterday for a public holiday.  “So many exporters want to sell dollars at NT$28.70,”
said  Henry Lin , a Taipei-based foreign-exchange trader at Taiwan
Shin Kong Commercial Bank. “The central bank may intervene a
little bit.”  Government bonds  fell before NT$40 billion of 10-year notes
are auctioned today. The yield on the 1.375 percent note due
March 2021 increased one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point,
to 1.43 percent, according to Gretai Securities Market.  Data today is expected to show inflation quickened to 1.64
percent in May from 1.34 percent the previous month, according
to the median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg News survey.
That would be the highest rate since February 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
