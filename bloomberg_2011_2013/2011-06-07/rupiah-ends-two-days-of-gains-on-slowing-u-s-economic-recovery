Indonesia ’s rupiah traded near a
seven-year high as global funds increased ownership of the
nation’s debt.  Overseas investors boosted holdings of Indonesian
government bonds by 15 percent this year to 225.65 trillion
rupiah ($26.5 billion) as of June 3, official data show. The
currency pared earlier losses after the  finance ministry  sold 7
trillion rupiah of debt in an auction today, more than its
target of 5 trillion rupiah, the  debt management office  said in
a statement on its website.  “There’s strong demand for Indonesia’s bonds as we can see
from today’s auction,” said said Mika Martumpal, a currency
analyst at PT Bank Commonwealth in Jakarta. “Inflation is
manageable and that’s helping the  bond market .”  The rupiah was unchanged at 8,513 per dollar as of 4:25 p.m.
in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It earlier
fell 0.2 percent to 8,530. The currency touched 8,506 yesterday,
the strongest level since March 2004.  Ten-year  government bonds  were little changed. The yield on
the 8.25 percent note due July 2021 was unchanged at 7.35
percent, according to prices from the Inter-Dealer Market
Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
