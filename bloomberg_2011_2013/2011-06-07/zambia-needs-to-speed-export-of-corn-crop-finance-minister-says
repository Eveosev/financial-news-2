Zambia’s Food Reserve Agency needs to
speed up the export of the bumper corn crop in 2009/2010 to
raise money to buy the latest harvest, Finance and National
Planning Minister  Situmbeko Musokotwane  said.  The agency also needs to free up space for the new crop at
warehouses across the country, Musokotwane said by phone from
the capital, Lusaka, today.  The southern African nation recorded a corn harvest of 3
million metric tons in 2010/11, up from 2.8 million tons the
year earlier, Agriculture Minister Eustarckio Kazonga said on
May 11. President Rupiah Banda said on May 28 that the
government would buy all the 3 million tons. Zambia consumes
about 1.4 million tons of corn per year, according to the
National Farmers Union website.  The country recorded two consecutive bumper harvests after
placing about 900,000 farmers on a seed and fertilizer program,
Kazonga said. Zambia,  Africa ’s top copper producer, wants to
diversify its economy away from the metal to agriculture and
tourism, Musokotwane said in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
