Democratic Republic of Congo’s formal
and informal taxes are limiting economic growth and the
development of business, the  World Bank  said.  Taxes levied by state officials against smaller companies
have “paralyzed” private-sector development and contributed to
unemployment, the Washington D.C.-based development bank said in
a report released today in Kinshasa, the capital.   “There has been no growth in employment” among small and
medium-sized businesses between 2006 and 2010, according to the
report on Congo’s economy. Companies employing more than 100
people with the clout to fight the taxes have fared better,
“but as these businesses aren’t numerous, it hasn’t had a
significant impact on employment.”  Poverty, which is still “omnipresent,” has been reduced
in recent years by improvements in agriculture and macroeconomic
stability, it said. Reforms to regulate state agencies, make
trade more efficient and strengthen the judicial system will all
help to increase growth and employment in the coming years, the
report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
