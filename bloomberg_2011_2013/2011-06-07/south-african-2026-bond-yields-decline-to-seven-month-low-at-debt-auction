South African government borrowing
costs fell to a seven-month low at a weekly auction as investors
raised bets the central bank won’t increase rates soon to slow
price advances in  Africa ’s biggest economy.  The Pretoria-based  Reserve Bank  sold 1.4 billion rand ($207
million) of bonds maturing in 2026 at an average yield of 8.4
percent, it said on its Bloomberg page. The yield was the lowest
since the auction of Nov. 2 and 27 basis points, or 0.27
percentage point, lower than at the previous auction of the debt
on May 3. Investors bid for 3.3 times the amount offered.  Forward-rate agreements effective in November, which
investors use to lock in  interest rates , have dropped 19 basis
points since May 13, the day after the central bank left its
benchmark rate unchanged at 5.5 percent, even as it revised its
inflation estimates higher. Inflation was driven by fuel and
food prices, not consumer demand, Deputy Governor  Daniel Mminele 
said on May 27.  “The market continues to bet against pre-emptive hikes,”
Rand Merchant Bank analysts led by Theuns de Wet said in a
research note.  The central bank also sold 700 million rand of notes due in
2020 at an average yield of 8.19 percent, the lowest since Nov.
9 and 11 basis points lower than at the previous auction on May
24. Investors bid for 1.8 times the amount on offer.  The extra yield investors expect to buy the South African
15-year debt over U.S. treasuries of similar maturity has
narrowed 27 basis points since May 17, when the Pretoria-based
statistics agency reported consumer inflation was 4.2 percent in
April, less than the 4.4 percent median estimate by economists.
The central bank’s Monetary Policy Committee on May 12 held its
benchmark interest rate at 5.5 percent, a 30-year low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
