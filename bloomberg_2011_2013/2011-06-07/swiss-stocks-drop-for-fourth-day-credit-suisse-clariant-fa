Swiss stocks declined for a fourth
day, the longest losing streak in 2 1/2 months, as watchmakers
and financial companies retreated.  Swatch Group AG (UHR) , the world’s biggest maker of timepieces,
and Cie. Financiere Richemont SA, the owner of the Cartier
brand, fell more than 1 percent.  UBS AG (UBSN)  and  Credit Suisse Group
AG (CSGN) , the nation’s biggest banks, declined at least 0.8 percent.
 Clariant AG (CLN)  slid 2.3 percent.  The  Swiss Market Index (SMI)  of the biggest and most actively
traded companies dropped 39.41, or 0.6 percent, to 6,330.65 at
the 5:30 p.m. close in Zurich. The measure has fallen 5.8
percent from this year’s high on Feb. 18 as U.S. manufacturing
and jobs reports fueled concern that the recovery in the world’s
largest economy is faltering and as speculation grew that Greece
will default on its debt. The broader Swiss Performance Index
also lost 0.6 percent today.  “Many uncertainties, such as the European debt crisis, the
economic situation in the U.S. and  China , the consequences of
the earthquake in  Japan , will probably be responsible for
nervous markets,” said Benno Galliker, a trader at Luzerner
Kantonalbank.  European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet
yesterday gave his first signal endorsing measures to encourage
investors to buy new Greek bonds to replace maturing securities
as officials seek to stem the nation’s debt crisis.  Greek Assistance  Central bank policy makers have opposed any measure that
could be classed as a default to avoid what European Union
Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn said would
be a “Lehman Brothers catastrophe.”  A report today showed Swiss inflation was little changed in
May as a stronger franc curbed price pressures, giving the
central bank room to keep borrowing costs near zero next week.
Consumer prices increased 0.4 percent from a year earlier after
advancing 0.3 percent in April, the Federal Statistics Office in
Neuchatel said.  Swatch fell 1 percent to 403.20 Swiss francs and Richemont
dropped 1.3 percent to 53.45 francs.  UBS slipped 1.5 percent to 15.65 francs and Credit Suisse
fell 0.8 percent to 35.19 francs.  Clariant, a producer of emulsions and pigments, dropped 2.3
percent to 18.42 francs even as it raised its 2011 sales and
margin targets. Chief Executive Hariolf Kottman vowed to make
acquisitions to push annual sales beyond 10 billion francs ($12
billion) by 2015, and margins above 17 percent.  Actelion, Schulthess  Actelion Ltd. (ATLN)  gained 0.5 percent to 44.99 francs. The
appointment of Chief Operating Officer Otto Schwarz means the
company may be open to a sale, Kepler Capital Markets said.  Schulthess Group (SGRN)  AG, the maker of washing machines and
dryers, surged 3.2 percent to 58.90 francs after  NIBE Industrier
AB (NIBEB)  said it has a 85.26 percent stake in the company, releasing
the preliminary interim results of its offer.  Groupe Minoteries SA (MIP) , an operator of flour mills, jumped 22
percent to 502 francs, the highest since at least 1990. The
shares have risen 30 percent since the company acquired Steiner
Muehle AG on May 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
