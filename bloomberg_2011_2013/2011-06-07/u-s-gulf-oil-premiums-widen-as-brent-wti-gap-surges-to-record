U.S. Gulf oil grades strengthened as
the spread between the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate
and Brent widened to the largest ever after a key oil supply
pipeline resumed shipments to the U.S. Midwest.  “TransCanada’s pipeline returned to service so you would
expect that they would pump at their maximum capacity to make up
for this outage,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil
Associates LLC in Houston. “That would increase the supplies
into the Midcontinent.”  The 591,000-barrel-a-day line, which delivers crude from
Hardisty,  Alberta , to  storage tanks  in Patoka,  Illinois , and
Cushing,  Oklahoma , was restarted June 5 after shipments were
halted following a May 29 leak. James Millar, a TransCanada
spokesman, said the pipeline would meet all June commitments.  The gap between WTI and its European counterpart for June
delivery increased $2.19 to $17.66 a barrel as of 2:24 p.m. in
New York. When Brent gains versus WTI, it strengthens the value
of low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil
priced against the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium gained 65 cents to $17.35
over WTI as of 2:17 p.m. in  New York , according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet added 75 cents to $17 a
barrel over the benchmark.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend widened $1 to $12 a barrel. Poseidon gained 80 cents to
$11.40 over WTI.  Thunder Horse’s premium widened 65 cents to $16.65 a
barrel. Southern Green Canyon slipped 25 cents to $10 a barrel
over WTI.  West Texas Sour’s discount narrowed 25 cents to $1.75 a
barrel.  The premium for Syncrude gained 25 cents to $8.50 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
 tar sands  in Alberta.  The discount for Western Canada Select was unchanged at
$20.50 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
