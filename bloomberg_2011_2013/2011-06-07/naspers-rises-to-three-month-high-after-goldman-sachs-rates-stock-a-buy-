Naspers Ltd. (NPN) , Africa’s biggest media
company, advanced to the strongest level in almost three months
after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. rated it a “buy” in new
coverage.  The stock increased 1 percent to 404 rand at 10:23 a.m. in
Johannesburg, the highest since March 11.  Goldman Sachs analysts, including Alexander Balakhnin, put
a price estimate of 528 rand on the company, which has
television and Internet interests in Africa, Brazil, Russia and
 China .  “We believe investors are underestimating the value of
Naspers’ Internet and pay-TV assets,” the analysts wrote in the
note dated today.  Naspers’s pay-television business is well-positioned to
remain a dominant operator in  South Africa  and will be able to
build up leadership in sub-Saharan Africa over the long term,
according to the analysts.  “We believe the shares will benefit from a re-rating of
core assets and a narrowing of the holding company discount.”  Naspers indirectly owns 39.3 percent of Mail.ru and about
35 percent of Tencent. Goldman Sachs sees a 35 percent upside
for Mail.ru Group, the Russian Internet service, and 4 percent
upside for China’s biggest social media Internet service  Tencent
Holdings Ltd. (700) , according to the research note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
