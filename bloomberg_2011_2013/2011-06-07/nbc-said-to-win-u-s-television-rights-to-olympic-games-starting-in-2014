Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s  NBC Universal  will
pay $4.38 billion to retain the U.S. rights for the Olympics
through 2020, outbidding  Walt Disney Co. (DIS)  and  News Corp. (NWSA)   NBC Universal will air the 2014 winter Olympics in Sochi,
Russia, the 2016 summer games in Rio de Janeiro, and the 2018
and 2020 games, Philadelphia-based Comcast and the  International
Olympic Committee  said in a statement today.  Comcast expects the 2014 and 2016 games to be profitable,
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Brian Roberts said on a
conference call. NBC Universal is paying $2 billion to broadcast
those games, little changed from last year’s  Winter Games  in
Vancouver and next year’s Summer Games in London. Those cost
$2.2 billion, including about $200 million in sponsorship rights
when General Electric Co. controlled NBC.  “It was important for them to retain these rights,” said
Neal Pilson, former president of  CBS Sports . “They consider the
Olympics a franchise.”  NBC Universal, which has broadcast every Summer Games since
1988 and every Winter Games since 2002, will pay $2.38 billion
for the 2018 and 2020 Olympics, for which host cities haven’t
yet been selected. The IOC delayed bidding in March 2009 during
the financial crisis.  Comcast, owner of sports outlets including Versus and Golf
Channel, can use the Olympics to promote its networks to a much
larger audience, said Pilson, now president of Pilson
Communications Inc. in Chappaqua, New York.  Today’s agreement also allows Philadelphia-based Comcast to
create an Olympics channel, according to the IOC.  Dedicated Teams  Having four more Olympics also allows Comcast and NBC
Universal to keep one production team dedicated to the Games and
reach sponsorship agreements over multiple years, Pilson said.
 General Electric Co. (GE) , which sold control of NBC to Comcast in
January, said in April 2010 the network lost about $223 million
on the Vancouver Games, narrower than the $250 million loss it
originally estimated.  Comcast, the biggest U.S. cable system operator, rose 10
cents to $24.02 at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market
trading. The shares have climbed 9.3 percent this year.  ESPN offered $1.4 billion for the rights to the 2014 and
2016 games, while Fox bid $3.4 billion for all four Olympics,
said two people with knowledge of the amounts who weren’t
authorized to talk publicly.  NBC plans to air all Olympics included in the newest
contract live as opposed to delaying some events to air during
prime-time in the U.S., Roberts said on the call. Some events
will be rebroadcast during primetime, he said.  “We have a smart plan to allow the super fan to watch live
no matter the time zone difference with the host city,” Roberts
said on the call.  To contact the reporters on this story:
