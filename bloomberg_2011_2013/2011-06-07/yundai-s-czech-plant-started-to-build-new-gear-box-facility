Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) ’s Czech car plant
in Nosovice began construction on a second unit that will
manufacture gear boxes, a spokesman said.  The new facility, to be finished next year, is part of the
factory’s plan to boost annual capacity to 300,000 cars from
200,000, spokesman Petr Vanek said by phone today. The carmaker
will invest 3.5 billion koruna ($212 million) to boost capacity
at its Nosovice plant, located east of Prague.  Hyundai’s Czech unit supplies cars to markets in Germany,
the U.K., Russia and Israel. About 4 percent of its total
production is shipped to showrooms in the  Czech Republic .  Hyundai’s Czech unit plans to hire 650 workers this year
and add another 250 next year, according to Vanek. It should
start a third production shift in the autumn, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
