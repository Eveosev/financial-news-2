Ukraine’s grain harvest will probably
total 45 million to 46 million metric tons this year, according
to a forecast by the country’s Agrarian Confederation.  The Confederation, a producers’ group based in  Kiev ,
expects grain exports of 20 million to 21 million tons, it said
in a statement on its  Website  late yesterday.  The corn harvest will probably reach 15 million tons this
year after farmers planted 3.4 million hectares of the crop,
confederation director said in the statement.  Corn planting advanced to 3.4 million hectares as of
yesterday, compared with 2.7 million hectares a year earlier,
the  Agriculture Ministry  said yesterday in an e-mailed
statement. Spring grain plantings reached 7.6 million hectares,
or 1.8 percent more than a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
