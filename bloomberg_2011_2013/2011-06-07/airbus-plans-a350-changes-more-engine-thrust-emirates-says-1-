Airbus SAS may boost the performance
of its planned A350 jet with enhancements including more thrust,
seeking to outflank any revamped version of the  Boeing Co. (BA)  777.  Upgrading the A350-1000, as the largest version of Airbus’s
new twin-engined widebody jetliner is known, could require
revisions to the model’s Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc turbines,
Emirates President  Tim Clark  said in an interview in Singapore.  “They’ve said that changes are on the way and hinted at
increased thrust,” Clark said. “The idea is to get increased
takeoff weight, but they haven’t given me details yet.”  Customers have been urging Airbus to increase the A350’s
range and capacity after it developed the model in response to
Boeing’s smaller 787. Qatar Airways Ltd., the A350’s No. 1
customer, and International Lease Finance Corp., the biggest
aircraft lessor, both said today they favor a performance boost.  Boeing is meanwhile studying modifications to defend the
16-year-old 777 against the new Airbus, which is slated to enter
service in the next two years. The U.S. company will watch
Airbus’s production schedule and the A350’s ramp-up before
deciding whether to improve the 777 or offer an all-new variant,
 Jim Albaugh , its commercial airplanes chief, said today.  “We’ll respond in kind,” Albaugh said at a briefing in
Singapore, where airlines are gathered for the annual meeting of
the  International Air Transport Association . “We’re spending a
lot of time looking at the 777 and what upgrades we could do to
an existing plane, and what derivatives we could do.”  Longer Routes  Rolls-Royce’s Trent XWB is the only engine on offer for the
A350 series. Josh Rosenstock, a spokesman for the London-based
company, declined to comment on its plans for the model today.  Sean Lee, a spokesman for Toulouse, France-based Airbus in
Singapore, declined to comment, saying the planemaker will brief
the press on the A350 at the  Paris Air Show  later this month.  Increasing the takeoff weight of the A350-1000 would allow
the plane to carry more fuel, which could then be used to fly
longer routes or carry more passengers in competition with
Boeing’s long-haul 777-300ER.  Change of Plan  “It would be a change of strategy with Rolls-Royce and
Airbus having said that the XWB engine would be sufficient,”
Matthew Hickman, an analyst at MF Global UK Ltd. in  London , said
today in a note to investors. “This is positive for both because
the engine is now better focused on the end markets.”  Hickman, who rates Rolls-Royce “buy,” said the indicated
cost of a new engine for the A350 is “close to $2 billion” and
could create a delay from 2014 to 2016, though with the -800 and
-900 versions of the plane on schedule a redesign could have
“less of an effect in the long run than might first be thought.”  Clark said that Emirates, the world’s biggest airline by
international traffic, hasn’t been pressing for changes, though
it’s the biggest joint customer for the competing models. The
Dubai-based carrier is the No. 2 client for the A350, with 70 on
order, including 20 -1000s, and has outstanding commitments for
the 777 that will make it the Boeing plane’s biggest user.  Qatar Airways , the No. 1 customer for the A350, with 80 on
order, said today that the -1000 will require a larger wing, as
well as a bigger engine with more thrust.  “We’d like increased weight, we’d like increased range,”
CEO Akbar al Baker said in an interview at the Singapore event.
“Airbus says the plane will compete with the 777-300ER, so let
us see.”  ILFC Keen  International Lease Finance Corp., the world’s biggest
plane lessor by fleet value, has 20 A350s on order and also said
it favors a more powerful variant.  “We’d welcome more performance for the A350-1000,” CEO
Henri Courpron said today on the fringes of the IATA meeting.  The A350-1000 is designed to carry 350 people in a three-
class formation as far as 8,000 nautical miles, according to
Airbus’s  website . The first delivery is scheduled for 2015. The
A350-900, which is due to begin operations two years earlier,
will be able to fly 100 miles further carrying 314 people. The
planemaker is also developing a smaller -800 variant.  Rolls-Royce is unlikely to completely change the engine on
the A350-1000 for a different model as that would likely force
alterations to the plane’s design, Clark said. Instead, it will
probably need to alter the core of the Trent powerplants so that
they extract more thrust from the same size fan, he said.  Airbus had 574 orders for the A350, across the three
different versions, as of the end of April.  The planemaker’s parent, European Aeronautic, Defence &
Space Co., was trading 0.3 percent higher at 21.53 euros as of
2:58 p.m. in Paris.  To contact the reporter on this story:
