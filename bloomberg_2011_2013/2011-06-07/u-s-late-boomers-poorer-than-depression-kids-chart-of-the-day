The last of the U.S.  baby boomers 
have ended up poorer than the prior two generations, including
those born during the Great Depression and World War II.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows the median household income of
Americans born between 1956 and 1965 was $64,179 in 2010, when
the group was in their 45-to-54 peak earning years. The median is
the number where half of those in the sample earned more and
half earned less.  Harvard University’s Joint Center for Housing Studies said
the median for the “younger baby boom” was less than the
$73,401 earned in 2000 by the generation born between 1946 and
1955, when they were in their peak earning years, and the
$71,617 earned in 1990 by those born from 1936 to 1945. The
figures were expressed in 2009 dollars and adjusted to remove
the effects of inflation.  “After the 2001 recession, employment regained little
ground before the Great Recession struck in 2007,”  the report
said . “This trend significantly lowered the income trajectory
of the younger baby boomers compared with those of their older
counterparts and the pre-boomers. Indeed, the younger baby
boomers have ended their peak earning years of 45-54 with lower
household incomes than those of the older baby boomers.”  The U.S. has recovered only 1.8 million of the more than
8.7 million jobs lost since January 2008, according to Labor
Department figures. A report last week showed the  unemployment
rate  rose to 9.1 percent in May, the highest this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
