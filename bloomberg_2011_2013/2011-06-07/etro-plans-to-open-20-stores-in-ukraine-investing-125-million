Metro AG (MEO) ,  Germany ’s largest retailer,
will invest 1 billion hryvnia ($125 million) to open about 20
new Ukrainian stores by 2013 as the economy rebounds for a
second year after the deepest recession since 1994.  “With its huge population and the economy returning to
strong growth again, Ukraine represents a very attractive market
for modern retailing”, said Chief Executive Officer Eckhard Cordes in capital Kiev today, according to an e-mailed
statement. “We are convinced that there is still great growth
potential for our sales divisions in the coming years.”  The Dusseldorf, Germany-based company seeks to expand in
the eastern European country, which has 46 million people and an
economy that the government forecast to expand 4.7 percent this
year. Gross domestic product advanced 4.2 percent in 2010.  Metro, which opened its first store in  Kiev  in 2003,
already operates 26 stores in 18 Ukrainian cities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
