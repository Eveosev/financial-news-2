Ford Motor Co. (F)  Chief Executive
Officer  Alan Mulally  said that while the economy is the
automaker’s main concern, he expects conditions to improve in
the second half of the year.  “Our biggest concern of course is that the economy has
slowed a little bit from where we thought it would be,” Mulally
said today in a Bloomberg Television interview. “Having said
that, most of the economists believe that it’s going to start
picking up in the second half with everything that’s been put in
place, both monetarily and fiscally.  "We believe with the economy coming back we’re going to
exceed our performance from last year," he said.  Ford, the second-largest U.S. automaker, said today its
global sales will rise 50 percent by 2015 to 8 million vehicles
a year as it delivers more small cars and boosts revenue in
 Asia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
