The German DFL Football League may
offer soccer matches exclusively via the Web and mobile devices
from 2013, to replace programs currently run on the country’s
public ARD broadcaster,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing
unidentified people within the company.  DFL aims to attract new bidders and achieve higher prices
for the exclusive right to show the content, the newspaper said,
adding that regulators will have to approve the plan. Yahoo!
Inc. is among companies that may bid for licenses, the company’s
German vice chief Heiko Genzlinger was cited as saying.  Sky Deutschland AG (SKYD) , as well as the ARD, ZDF and Sport1
channels, currently pay 412 million euros ($603 million) a year
to DFL, which represents the country’s 36 professional clubs,
Handelsblatt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
