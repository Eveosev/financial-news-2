U.S. airlines posted their second-
worst April on-time rate in the 17 years records have been kept
as storms complicated air-traffic operations, federal data show.  Flights landed within 15 minutes of their scheduled arrival
75.5 percent of the time, the worst for that month since 75.4
percent in April 2000, according to Transportation Department
 figures  issued today in  Washington .  At least 250 people were killed April 27 as tornadoes and
severe storms slammed into the Southeast, making it the single
deadliest day for tornadoes in the U.S. since 1974, according to
the  Associated Press . April 27 accounted for three of the four
flights that were stuck on the tarmac for longer than three
hours that month, according to the agencyâ€™s data.  Delays caused by factors such as weather and heavy traffic
rose to 8.1 percent of flights in April from 4.8 percent a year
earlier, according to the data. Cancellations increased to 2
percent from 0.7 percent in April 2010, the agency found.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
