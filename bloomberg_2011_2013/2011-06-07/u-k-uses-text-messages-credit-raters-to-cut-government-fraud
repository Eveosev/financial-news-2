British civil servants have turned to
credit-rating companies and  text messages  in an effort to reduce
the 21 billion pounds ($35 billion) the government estimates it
loses to fraud and error each year.  In pilot programs, revenue officials sent texts to 31,500
people who paid a lot of tax late in 2010 to urge them to meet
the deadline, while their counterparts who pay welfare ran
credit checks on 20,000 claimants, Cabinet Office Minister
Francis Maude said. Meanwhile, the Department for Transport
asked a data analytics company to detect overpayments to
suppliers.  By widening these and other checks, the government expects
to save 1.5 billion pounds over the next four years, Maude said
in an e-mailed statement.  “We will no longer allow a culture of ignoring or
accepting fraud,” he said. “Every pound defrauded from the
government means that there is less to spend on front-line
services like health care, education, policing and defense.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
