The Slovak government is sticking to
its  budget-deficit  targets for the coming years, Finance
Minister Ivan Miklos said.  Reducing the budget deficit to 4.9 percent of gross
domestic product this year and 3.8 percent of GDP in 2012 is a
“top priority” of the Slovak administration, Miklos said today
in response to Fitch Ratings’ comments that the goals may be
overshot.  If needed, the government is ready to take additional
measures to make sure the goals are met, while better-than-
expected economic growth will also help close the fiscal gap,
Miklos told journalists at a press conference in the Slovak
capital Bratislava.  Even as Fitch yesterday affirmed Slovakia’s rating at A+,
the agency’s fifth-best grade, it forecast the shortfall to
reach 5.7 percent of GDP in 2011 and 4 percent in 2012,
respectively. The agency said there is a risk that the
government won’t be able to implement all planned budget-saving
measures.  The government of Premier Iveta Radicova, in power since
July, has already cut spending and raised excise and value-added
taxes to narrow the budget gap, which shot up to almost 8
percent of GDP after the economy slipped into a recession two
year ago. The four-party coalition still needs to agree on more
budget measures at a time when austerity is causing its
popularity to drop.  To contact the reporter on this story:
