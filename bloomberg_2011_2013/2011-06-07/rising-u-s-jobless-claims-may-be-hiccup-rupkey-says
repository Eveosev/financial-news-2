Rising jobless claims could be “a
little hiccup” for the U.S. economy, said  Chris Rupkey , chief
financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in New
York.  “It’s kind of like watching a horror movie,” Rupkey said
today in a radio interview on “Bloomberg Surveillance” with
Tom Keene. “I’m kind of hoping we’re at the worst point here.”  During May, initial claims for state unemployment insurance
averaged 426,000 a week, according to Labor Department
statistics. From January through April, the weekly average of
jobless claims was 411,000 a week.  “We’re certainly not going in a double-dip” recession,
Rupkey said.  (In the U.S., hear Bloomberg Radio on satellite radio: Sirius
