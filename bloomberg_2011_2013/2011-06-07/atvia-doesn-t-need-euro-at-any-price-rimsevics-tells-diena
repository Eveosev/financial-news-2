Latvia  doesn’t need to adopt the euro
“at any price,” central bank Governor Ilmars Rimsevics said,
according to the newspaper  Diena .  “I have never stressed that the euro needs to be
introduced at any price,” Rimsevics said in an interview with
the Riga-based newspaper. “First of all in Latvia we have to
create the necessary conditions for growth. And if we are a
state that meets the criteria to introduce the euro, we can take
a pause and think, ‘Is it needed?’”  Latvia plans to lower its budget deficit to 2.5 percent of
economic output next year so it can adopt the euro in 2014.  The euro isn’t a “magic wand” whose introduction will
make the country twice as rich, he told the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
