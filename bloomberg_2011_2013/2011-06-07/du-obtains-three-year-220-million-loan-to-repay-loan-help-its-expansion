Du, the second-biggest phone company
in the  United Arab Emirates , obtained a three-year loan to
finance part of 3 billion dirhams ($817 million) of debt due
this month.  The $220 million club loan facility will pay annual
interest of 1.45 percent over Libor, the company also known as
 Emirates Integrated Telecommunications Co. (DU)  said in a  statement 
to the Dubai bourse today. “The remaining balance of the
existing facility will be settled using the company’s existing
resources,” according to the statement.  Du, which competes with Emirates Telecommunications Corp.,
had a cash balance of 2.9 billion dirhams at the end of March,
according to the company’s financial statement posted on
Bloomberg. The Dubai-based company will use part of its cash
reserves to repay the debt, it said in an e-mailed response to
questions today.  Du plans to spend as much as 1.7 billion dirhams this year
on infrastructure, Chief Executive Officer Osman Sultan said
April 25. The company’s first-quarter profit more than doubled
to 205.8 million dirhams as the number of mobile and fixed-line
subscribers grew. The net income was after the company set aside
50 percent of profit as royalty payment to the government.  The lead arrangers for the club loan were  National Bank of
Abu Dhabi PJSC (NBAD) ,  Emirates NBD PJSC (EMIRATES)  and  Samba Financial Group. (SAMBA) 
Mashreq Bank PSC was the co-arranger.  Du shares have gained 10 percent this year. They fell 0.3
percent to 3.15 dirhams in Dubai trading, giving the company a
market value of 14.4 billion dirhams.  To contact the reporter on this story:
