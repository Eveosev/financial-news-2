China ’s money-market rate dropped to
the lowest level in a week on speculation maturing central bank
bills will add money to the financial system.  The People’s Bank of China sold one-year bills at a yield
of 3.3058 percent, unchanged for a ninth week, according to a
statement on its web site. A total of 226 billion yuan ($34.9
billion) of central bank bills and repurchase agreements will be
redeemed this week, according to Guo Caomin, a bond analyst at
Industrial Bank Co.  “The huge maturing amount this week is helping ease the
liquidity shortage,” said Shanghai-based Guo. “If there is no
increase in reserve-requirement ratios in the short term, the
easing of the shortage may continue.”  The seven-day repurchase rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, dropped 24 basis points to 3.24 percent as
of the 4:30 p.m. close in  Shanghai , according to a weighted
average rate compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center.
It slid as much as 31 basis points to 3.16 percent, the lowest
level since May 30.  One-year interest-rate swaps, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, gained one basis
point to 3.44 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It earlier touched 3.41 percent, the lowest since May 30.  Faster Inflation  China’s inflation may have accelerated to 5.6 percent last
month, from 5.3 percent in April, as a drought in central and
southern provinces drove up food prices, according to China
International Capital Corp. China’s central bank has raised
lenders’ reserve-requirement ratios five times this year to help
drain liquidity and curb inflation.  The monetary authority today sold 2 billion yuan of the
one-year central bank bills and 100 billion yuan of  repurchase
agreements .  The yield on the 3.6 percent government bond due February
2016 climbed one basis point to 3.41 percent, according to the
Interbank Funding Center. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  China’s finance ministry will sell at least 30 billion yuan
of five-year bonds at a yield of 3.40 percent tomorrow,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. The
highest forecast was 3.45 percent and the lowest 3.38 percent,
the survey of 18 finance companies showed.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
