The U.S. raised its forecast for
natural gas production in 2011 by 2.2 percent and increased its
outlook for prices.  Marketed gas production will average 64.61 billion cubic
feet a day in 2011, up from 63.23 billion estimated in May, the
Energy Department said in its monthly  Short-Term Energy Outlook ,
released today in  Washington . The estimate is up 4.5 percent
from 61.83 billion produced in 2010.  Production in the  Gulf of Mexico  will average 5.46 billion
cubic feet a day, down from 5.56 billion estimated last month,
according to the report from the department’s Energy Information
Administration. Lower-48-state output is pegged at 58.11
billion, up from 56.63 billion.  “Production continues to grow at a strong pace despite a
significant decline in gas-directed drilling activity,” the
government agency said.  Total gas consumption will average 67.06 billion cubic feet
a day, up from 66.48 billion estimated in May.  Gas prices  at the benchmark  Henry Hub  in Erath,  Louisiana ,
will average $4.25 per million British thermal units, up from
the previous estimate of $4.24, according to the department.  LNG Shipments  LNG imports will average 1 billion cubic feet a day this
year, up from 940 million forecast in May.  Demand for gas from power plants will average 20.3 billion
cubic feet a day, up from the previous estimate of 20.29
billion. Industrial demand will average 18.65 billion, compared
with 18.43 billion predicted last month.  Inventories may surpass 3.8 trillion cubic feet at the end
of October because of higher production and a mild summer
relative to last year, the department said. Stockpiles totaled a
record 3.84 trillion cubic feet in November 2010, according to
Bloomberg data.  Demonstrated peak working gas capacity was 4.049 trillion
as of April 2010, according to the department. The measure is
the sum of the highest inventory level in each storage facility
over the previous five years, excluding supplies needed to
maintain adequate pressure.  Natural gas for July delivery rose 0.4 cent to settle at a
10-month high of $4.831 per million Btu on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Prices have gained 9.7 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
