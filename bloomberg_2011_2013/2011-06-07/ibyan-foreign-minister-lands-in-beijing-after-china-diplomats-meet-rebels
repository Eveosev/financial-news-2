Libyan Foreign Minister Abdul Ati Al-
Obeidi arrived in  China  today for a three-day visit, after the
Foreign Ministry in Beijing yesterday confirmed its diplomats
had met with rebel leaders.  Al-Obeidi’s itinerary includes a meeting with his Chinese
counterpart, ministry spokesman Hong Lei told reporters in
Beijing today. Hong yesterday said that Chinese diplomats from
the country’s Egyptian embassy recently met officials from the
Interim Transitional National Council in the Libyan city of
Benghazi. The council represents Libya’s opposition, which is
fighting  Muammar Qaddafi  for control of the country.  Hong, responding to questions about whether China was
seeking to mediate between the two sides, said “China is
working along with the international community to resolve the
Libyan crisis politically.”  Foreign Minister  Yang Jiechi  will meet with Al-Obeidi
during his visit to “exchange views on a political resolution
to the political crisis with the special envoy of the Libyan
government,” Hong said. “We believe that the future of Libya
will be determined by the Libyan people themselves.”  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
