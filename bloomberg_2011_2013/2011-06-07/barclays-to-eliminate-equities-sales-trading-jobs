Barclays Capital , the investment-
banking unit of London-based  Barclays Plc (BARC) , eliminated fewer than
50 jobs in its equities division worldwide, according to a
person familiar with the matter.  The cuts affected employees in sales, trading and research,
said the person, who requested anonymity because the plan isn’t
public. The move, part of a mid-year performance assessment,
wasn’t made because of declining revenue, the person said.  Barclays, the U.K.’s third-largest bank by assets, said in
April that pretax profit at its investment bank fell 33 percent
as revenue from fixed-income, currencies and commodities trading
tumbled. Equities-trading revenue at global investment banks,
including Barclays Capital, will drop an average of 12 percent
in the second quarter, compared with the previous three-month
period, according to an estimate yesterday by Kian Abouhossein,
a  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  analyst.  Brandon Ashcraft, a spokesman at Barclays Capital in New
York, declined to comment.  Dealbreaker.com  reported the job cuts yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
