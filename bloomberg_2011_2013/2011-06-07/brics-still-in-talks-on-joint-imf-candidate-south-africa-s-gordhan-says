Brazil, Russia, India, China and
 South Africa  are still in talks to nominate a joint candidate to
head the International Monetary Fund, South African Finance
Minister  Pravin Gordhan  said.  The focus must shift to the role of the IMF and the agenda
of the new managing director of the fund, rather than on the
candidate, Gordhan told reporters in Cape Town today. Countries
have until June 10 to nominate candidates.  “The BRICS countries have also been consulting on this
issue and the process is not completed yet,” Gordhan said.
“There might be something that comes out of it, there might be
nothing that comes out of it.”  Emerging economies have urged an end to the convention of
naming World Bank presidents from the U.S. and the head of the
 International Monetary Fund  from Europe. The 187-member IMF aims
to pick a successor to Dominique Strauss-Kahn by the end of
June, after he resigned last month following his arrest in New
York on charges of attempted rape and sexual assault.  French Finance Minister  Christine Lagarde  has emerged as
the front-runner for the IMF job with the backing of the
European Union.  To contact the reporter on this story:
