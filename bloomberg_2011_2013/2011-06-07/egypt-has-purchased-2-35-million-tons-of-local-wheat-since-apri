Egypt  has purchased 2.35 million
metric tons of wheat from local farmers since the buying season
began on April 15, Solidarity and Social Justice Minister Gouda Abdel Khaleq said in an interview.  The amount, which Abdel Khaleq said he expects to increase
to more than 3 million metric tons, surpasses the 2.1 million
metric tons that the North African country bought locally last
year, he said in Sadat City, about 94 kilometers (58 miles)
northwest of Cairo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
