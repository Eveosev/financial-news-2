European Union carbon allowances were
little changed near their lowest level in almost two weeks.  December carbon futures fell 1 cent to 16.68 euros ($24.43)
a metric ton today as of 9:20 a.m. London time on the ICE
Futures Europe exchange. German power for 2012 rose 25 cents to
59.65 euros a megawatt-hour, according to broker data compiled
by Bloomberg.  The profit available from coal plants in  Germany  next year
jumped 36 percent in the past month to 7.22 euros a megawatt-
hour today, based on a so-called dark-spread calculator that
accounts for fuel and carbon costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
