European Commission  President  Jose Barroso  said the region’s economy is “at a critical juncture”
as it faces “many uncertainties.”  “The recovery is gaining ground, but it is very uneven
across the continent,” Barroso said today in a statement issued
by the commission, the European Union’s Brussels-based
executive. “Many uncertainties remain.”  The commission today is issuing recommendations to the 27
EU governments on their budget programs over the next 12 to 18
months, with a focus on economic growth, jobs and public
finances. The recommendations will be debated by European
leaders at a summit on June 23-24, the commission said.  “We know that achieving the goals we have collectively set
ourselves means sometimes hard choices,” Barroso said. “But
these efforts, if made seriously and by all, will allow  Europe 
to leave the crisis behind it and safeguard our future
prosperity.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
