Romania signed three contracts valued
at 428 million euros ($627 million) with construction companies
to build and design highways financed mainly by the European
Union, Transport Minister Anca Boagiu said.  The ministry awarded a contract worth about 167 million
euros to Austria’s  Strabag SE (STR) , while a group led by  Italy ’s
 Astaldi SpA (AST)  won a contract of 147 million euros, according to an
e-mailed statement today. Two private companies from Romania and
Italy got the third contract worth 114 million euros.  “So far, we have organized auctions to award projects of 3
billion euros from the 5.7 billion euros the EU is giving us
until 2013 to build roads and highways,” Boagiu said in the
statement. “We plan to sign construction contracts for the
remaining projects by the end of the year.”  The Balkan nation that joined the EU in 2007 has been using
the EU money and other resources to upgrade its transportation
system. The government plans to sell minority stakes in its
utilities  Transelectrica SA (TEL)  and Transgaz SA and in the largest
oil company OMV Petrom SA to gain funds for financing
infrastructure investments.  Last month, Romania awarded five contracts valued at 693
million euros to Austria’s Alpine Bau GmbH, Italy’s Impregilo
SpA and to three groups led by Romanian companies Spedition UMB
and Romstrade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
