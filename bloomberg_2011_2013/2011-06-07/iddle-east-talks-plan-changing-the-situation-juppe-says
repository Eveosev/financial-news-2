France ’s proposal to restart Israeli-
Palestinian peace talks in Paris this summer, with a one-year
deadline for an accord, is “changing the situation,” French
Foreign Minister  Alain Juppe  said.  “There will be positive developments during the next
weeks,” Juppe told reporters after meetings at the  United
Nations  in New York. “It is very difficult and the past decades
have shown you need determination and tenacity to be involved in
this situation, but we have tenacity and we will continue to
move forward.”  Peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians broke down
last September after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
declined to extend a 10-month freeze on building settlements in
the  West Bank .  While Juppe said Palestinian Authority President  Mahmoud Abbas  has expressed “approval and readiness” to participate in
the French-backed negotiations, the Palestinian ambassador to
the UN said Abbas was “in principle sympathetic.”  Ambassador Riyad Mansour said both sides would have to
“refrain from unilateral actions, which for us means a halt to
settlement activities.”  Israel is studying the proposal “very closely” and will
respond “in the coming days,” Juppe said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
