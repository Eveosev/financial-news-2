Hydroelectric reserves in  France  rose
last week, boosting the supply of water for power generation in
 Europe ’s second-biggest power market.  Water reservoirs for electricity production increased 3
percentage points to 59 percent full at the start of this week,
according to data on the  website  of Reseau de Transport
d’Electricite, a unit of Electricite de France SA.  Reserves are 12 percentage points below the same week last
year and 13 points lower than in 2009. France gets about 20
percent of its power capacity from running water through
turbines. Utilities can retain water for use when demand and
prices are higher.  RTE compiles data from generators EDF,  GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA and
Societe Nationale d’Electricite & de Thermique. The three
companies produce more than 90 percent of France’s electricity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
