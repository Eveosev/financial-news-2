Belarus wants to buy Russian natural
gas at domestic prices if it sells its remaining 50 percent
stake in pipeline operator Beltransgaz to OAO Gazprom, First
Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Semashko said, Belta reported.  Belarus would like to sign a new gas-supply contract with
 Russia  when the existing deal expires Dec. 31, the news service
quoted Semashko as saying today in Ivatsevichi in the west of
the country.  An agreement to sell the Beltransgaz stake to Gazprom,
bringing the monopolyâ€™s ownership to 100 percent, is almost
ready to be signed, Semashko said, according to Belta.  Belarus paid Russia $223 per 1,000 cubic meters of gas in
the first quarter, the Belapan news service has reported.  To contact the reporters on this story:
