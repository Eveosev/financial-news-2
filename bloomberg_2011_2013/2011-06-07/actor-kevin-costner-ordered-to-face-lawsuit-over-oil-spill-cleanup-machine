Actor  Kevin Costner  must face a
lawsuit in which he’s accused of cheating partners, including
actor Stephen Baldwin, of their share of profits on floating
oil-water separators sold to  BP Plc (BP/)  to help clean up last year’s
Gulf of Mexico oil spill.  U.S. District Judge Martin Feldman in New Orleans today
rejected Costner’s request to be dismissed from the case, which
is set for a non-jury trial in May.  Costner’s former partners claim he tricked them into
selling their shares in Ocean Therapy Solutions LLC for
$1.9 million days before BP paid an $18 million deposit for the
floating centrifuges. The machines ultimately played a small
role in cleaning up the worst offshore  oil spill  in U.S.
history.  Costner, whose movies include “Field of Dreams” and
Waterworld,” is accused by his former partners of withholding
knowledge of the BP sale from them “through a series of half-
statements and non-disclosures in order to lure plaintiffs into
a cheap sale of their interests,” Feldman said in a 32-page
order. These claims satisfied the legal requirements for letting
the case proceed to trial, Feldman said.  Wayne Lee, Costner’s attorney, didn’t immediately return a
call seeking comment.  The case is Contogouris v. Westpac Resources LLC,
2:10-cv-04609, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
 Louisiana  (New Orleans).  To contact the reporters on this story:
