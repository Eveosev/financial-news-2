Turkish bond yields rose a third day
and the lira appreciated after the currency reached a level that
had prompted the central bank to lower its dollar buying in
daily auctions on May 30.  The lira strengthened 0.6 percent to 1.5774 per dollar at
5:49 p.m. in Istanbul. The currency strengthened 0.2 percent to
1.9471 against the equal-weighted euro-dollar basket.  “When the lira reached 1.95 against the basket, the
central bank reduced dollar buying auctions by $10 million and
this gave an impression to market players that 1.95 is the
bottom level,” Henza Tukel, a currency trader at Turk Ekonomi
Bankasi AS in Istanbul, said in e-mailed comments. “We now know
what one market player wants and does not want, and this is the
central bank.”  The currency appreciated 0.7 percent against the U.S.
currency on May 31, the day after the central bank cut its daily
dollar buying to $40 million from $50 million. The Ankara-based
policy maker said in a separate statement on May 30 it may
reduce the size of its dollar purchases further if international
capital inflows continue to slow.  Yields on two-year benchmark bonds fell as much as 7 basis
points to 8.87 percent in the secondary  debt market  after the
Treasury sold two-year benchmark bonds at the highest yields in
three months in an auction today. Yields rose one basis point,
or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.95 percent, the highest level in
a week, at 5 p.m. in Istanbul, according to the TEB local
benchmark bond index.  The  ISE National 100 index (XU100)  of stocks rose for a second day,
increasing 1.5 percent to 64,463.23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
