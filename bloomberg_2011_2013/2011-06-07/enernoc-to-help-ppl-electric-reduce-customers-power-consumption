Enernoc Inc. (ENOC) , a power-management
service provider, agreed to help a unit of  PPL Corp. (PPL)  reduce its
customers’ electricity consumption when demand is high.  The 300-megawatt demand-response capacity agreement will
help PPL Electric Utilities Corp. reach state load-reduction
targets, Enernoc said today in a statement.  Enernoc pools electricity consumption from multiple
companies, which receive lower power rates in exchange for
allowing their service to be cut at times of high demand. The
Boston-based company will monitor customers’ power usage to cut
demand on PPL Electric’s grid by as much as 300 megawatts. The
contract must be approved by the Pennsylvania Public Utility
Commission.  Enernoc fell 49 cents, or 3 percent, to $15.94 at 12:07
p.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Its shares have fallen 33
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
