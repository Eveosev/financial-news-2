Asia  fuel oil ’s discount to crude
narrowed to the lowest since March. Royal Dutch Shell Plc bought
cargoes of naphtha and gasoline in Singapore, the region’s
biggest oil-trading center.  Fuel Oil  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude narrowed $1.16, or 19
percent, to $5.03 a barrel, based on calculations by Bloomberg.
The difference is the least since March 16, showing refiners’
losses from turning oil into residual products decreased.  Benchmark 180-centistoke fuel oil rose $2, or 0.3 percent,
to $661.50 a ton, according to Bloomberg data. The price of 380-
centistoke fuel oil, mainly used as marine fuel, climbed $1, or
0.2 percent, to $651.50.  The premium, or viscosity spread, of 180-centistoke fuel
oil to 380-centistoke grade was up $1 to $10 a ton, Bloomberg
data showed.  Hin Leong Trading Pte purchased three cargoes of 380-
centistoke fuel oil. Chevron Corp. sold two cargoes, one for
loading June 22 to June 26 at a premium of $6 a metric ton to
 Singapore  quotes and a second shipment loading June 27 to July 1
at the same price.  Kuo Oil Ltd. sold the third one for loading from June 22 to
June 26 at a premium of $6.  Light Distillates  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded  Brent crude  fell $5.49,
or 5.7 percent, to $90.58 a metric ton, calculations by
Bloomberg showed. This crack spread dropped for the second time
in seven days, signaling increasing profit from making the
petrochemical feedstock.  Open-specification naphtha for delivery to Japan declined
$3, or 0.3 percent, to $959 a ton, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Benchmark 92-RON gasoline in Singapore rose 40 cents,
or 0.3 percent, to $118.35 a barrel.  Vitol Group purchased three 50,000 barrel cargoes of 92-RON
gasoline, according to traders that participate in the market.
It took one loading from June 23 to June 27 from BP Plc at
$118.30 a barrel, a second from July 3 to July 7 from Total SA
at the same level and a June 27 to July 1 parcel at $119.40.  Shell bought two shipments of 97-RON. It got one from
Mercuria Energy Trading loading from June 27 to July 1 at
$124.90 a barrel and a second cargo at $125.50 from Vitol
loading from June 24 to June 28.  Shell also purchased 25,000 metric tons naphtha loading to
 Japan  for the second half of August at $958 a metric ton.  Gasoline’s premium to naphtha rose to $13.70 from $13
yesterday, based on Bloomberg data. A widening reforming margin
shows it’s more profitable to turn naphtha into gasoline.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil’s premium to Asian benchmark Dubai crude, known as
the crack spread, advanced 37 cents to $20.30 a barrel at 4:08
p.m. Singapore time, based on data from PVM Oil Associates, a
London-based broker.  Gasoil, or diesel, with 0.5 percent sulfur fell 50 cents,
or 0.4 percent, to $127.45 a barrel, according to Bloomberg
data. Jet fuel fell 30 cents, or 0.2 percent, to $128.15.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil was unchanged at 65 cents, the
lowest since April 13, PVM said. This regrade has narrowed for
four straight days, indicating it’s less profitable to produce
 aviation fuel  over diesel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
