Maple Energy Plc (MPLE) , an oil and natural-
gas producer with operations in Peru, surged the most in two
years as investors bet that yesterday’s plunge was excessive.  Shares in the company, which is building a $245 million
ethanol plant, rose the most since October 2008, adding 17
percent in Lima trading to 84 cents at 12:26 p.m. New York time.
The stock plunged 20 percent yesterday after former army rebel
Ollanta Humala won Peru’s June 5 presidential elections,
spurring speculation his government would seek to take greater
control of the country’s natural resources.  Humala pledged early in his campaign to renegotiate mining
and oil contracts and rewrite trade accords and the
Constitution. He moved away from those comments later, saying he
would emulate the pro-market policies of former Brazilian
President  Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva .  “The stock hit bottom,” Daniel Romero, an analyst at
Lima-based investment fund NC&F Inversiones SA, said today in a
telephone interview. “The mutual funds and other institutional
investors saw a buying opportunity.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
