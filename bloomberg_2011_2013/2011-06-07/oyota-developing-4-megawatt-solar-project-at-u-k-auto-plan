Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the Japanese
automaker, is developing a 4-megawatt solar project in the U.K.
to help power its manufacturing plant in Burnaston.  British Gas unit  Centrica Plc (CNA)  is installing 10 million
pounds ($16.4 million) of photovoltaic panels at the site,
Toyota said today in a statement.  Toyota is the first automaker to install a large-scale
solar plant in the U.K., and follows projects in other European
countries by peers  Renault SA (RNO)  and Volkswagen AG unit Seat.  The ground-mounted system is expected to deliver power in
July and will generate enough energy to build about 7,000 cars a
year, according to the statement. If connected to the grid
before August, the plant will avoid cuts to incentives for solar
projects that were announced this month by the government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
