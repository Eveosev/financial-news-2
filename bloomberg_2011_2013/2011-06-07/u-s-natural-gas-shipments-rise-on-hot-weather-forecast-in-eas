Scheduled natural gas deliveries to
U.S. electricity generators rose for a second day as
meteorologists forecast higher temperatures in the east that may
increase air-conditioner use.  A sample of scheduled deliveries to  power plants  in the
U.S. and Canada shows shipments rose 4.5 percent to 19.2 million
dekatherms (18.7 billion cubic feet), according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Shipments to power generators in  New York  jumped
55 percent.  Cooling demand in New York and Philadelphia will be twice
normal until at least June 14, while the Southeast will be above
normal, according to Belton, Missouri-based forecaster Weather
Derivatives. Power plants use 30 percent of U.S. gas supplies.  “Mostly sunny skies under a ridge could enhance daytime
heating and raise afternoon highs” for mid-Atlantic states, MDA
EarthSat Weather of Gaithersburg, Maryland, said in a note to
clients.  The high in New York today reached 86 degrees Fahrenheit
(30 Celsius), 9 above normal, according to AccuWeather Inc. of
 State College , Pennsylvania.  Scheduled shipments for U.S. residences fell 17 percent to
23.6 million dekatherms after a 2.9 percent gain yesterday.  Wholesale gas at the Tetco M3 hub in New York, where gas is
delivered to the Northeast, rose 13.97 cents, or 2.7 percent, to
$5.3998 per million British thermal units on the
Intercontinental Exchange.  Gas at the  Henry Hub  in Erath, Louisiana, the delivery
point for futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
fell 0.3 cents to $4.8262 per million Btu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
