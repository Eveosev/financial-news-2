The first tropical depression of the
season formed today in the eastern Pacific off the coast of
 Mexico  and is expected to move harmlessly out to sea as it
strengthens into a hurricane later this week.  The storm is about 365 miles (587 kilometers) south of
Acapulco with maximum winds of 30 mph, and is moving northwest
at 3 mph, the  National Hurricane Center  in Miami reported.  “Gradual strengthening is forecast and the depression
could become a tropical storm within the next day or so,”
according to the bulletin. The storm is expected to reach
hurricane strength, with winds of at least 74 mph, by June 10,
according to the  center’s tracking maps .  A storm gets a name when its winds reach 39 mph. Adrian is
the first name on the 2011 eastern Pacific list, the center
said.  In the Atlantic, the chances that a low pressure system
over the northwestern  Caribbean Sea  will develop into a storm
have fallen. The storm has a 20 percent chance of forming, down
from 50 percent yesterday, according to the hurricane center.  The system was 100 miles (161 kilometers) south-southwest
of Grand Cayman, the center  said  today in a bulletin at 8 a.m.
New York time. It may cause flash floods and mudslides in parts
of Haiti, the  Dominican Republic , Cuba and  Jamaica .  To contact the reporters on this story:
