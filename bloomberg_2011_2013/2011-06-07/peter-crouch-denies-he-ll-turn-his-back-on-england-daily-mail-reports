Tottenham striker  Peter Crouch  denied
he’s turned his back on playing for England, although he’s
disappointed at not making the starting line-up, the Daily Mail
reported.  The  Mail on Sunday  said two days ago that Crouch, 30,
wouldn’t play for England again under coach Fabio Capello after
he was left out of the matchday squad for the Euro 2012 soccer
qualifier with Switzerland on June 4.  “Do I want to carry on playing for England? Yeah, of
course,” the Daily Mail cited Crouch as saying today. “I would
never give up playing for my country at any stage. It’s an
honor.”  Since starting the Euro 2012 qualifier with Montenegro at
Wembley in October, Crouch has made only a substitute’s
appearance in the November exhibition match against France, the
 Daily Mail  said. He’s scored 22 goals in 42 games for England.  Goalkeepers Paul Robinson and  Ben Foster  are among players
who have already made themselves unavailable. England drew 2-2
with Switzerland at Wembley at the weekend and tops Group G on
goal difference from Montenegro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
