British Airways agreed to pay $89.5
million to hundreds of freight customers to settle a group
lawsuit in the U.S. over its involvement in a global price-
fixing cartel.  The deal, which must be approved by a judge in New York,
will resolve claims by companies that purchased shipping
services from British Airways during the cartel that lasted from
2000 through 2006, the customers’ law firm Hausfeld LLP said
today in a statement.  “We will continue our efforts to pursue recoveries for the
huge number of victims of this cartel both in the U.S. and
around the world,” Michael Hausfeld, a lawyer for the freight
shippers, said in the statement.  British Airways,  Air France-KLM (AF)  Group and nine other
carriers were fined a total of 779.4 million euros ($1.15
billion) in November 2010 by European Union regulators for
coordinating air-cargo fuel and security surcharges. The London-
based carrier pleaded guilty to price fixing to authorities in
the U.S.,  Australia  and  Canada  and was later fined by a South
Korean regulator.  “We are pleased that we have reached a settlement over
these claims made by cargo customers in the U.S.,” British
Airways spokesman Euan Fordyce said today in a phone interview.  British Airways is part of the International Consolidated
Airlines Group SA, after the company completed its merger with
 Spain ’s Iberia in January.  The case is In re: Air Cargo Shipping Services Antitrust
Litigation, 06-MD-1775 (JG) (VVP), U.S. District Court, Eastern
District of  New York  (Brooklyn).  To contact the reporter on this story:
