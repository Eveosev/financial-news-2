Sudan’s annual inflation rate climbed
to 16.8 percent in May from 16.5 percent in April as food prices
rose in the African country, the Khartoum-based  Central Bureau
of Statistics  said.  Prices of food and non-alcoholic drinks, the biggest
component of the consumer-price index, rose 18.8 percent in May,
the same as the previous month, the Khartoum-based agency said
today in a statement handed to reporters. In the month, prices
increased 1.7 percent.  Sudan is targeting inflation of 12 percent and economic
growth of 5 percent for this year, according to Finance Minister
Ali Mahmoud Abdel Rasoul. Inflation averaged 13 percent last
year, the statistics agency said, higher than the target for
that year of 9 percent to 11 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
