South African reserves fell for the
first time in six months in May, sliding 1 percent as the dollar
strengthened against other major currencies including the euro
and the pound, the central bank said.  Gross gold and foreign currency reserves declined to $50.1
billion from $50.6 billion in April, the Pretoria-based  Reserve
Bank  said on its website today. Net reserves fell to $45.9
billion from $46 billion. The dollar gained against 14 out of 16
major currencies tracked by Bloomberg in May, advancing 3
percent against the euro.  “The decrease in the gross reserves was primarily due to
valuation adjustments associated with the appreciation of the
 U.S. dollar  against other major currencies,” the central bank
said.  Gold reserves, which account for about 12 percent of gross
reserves, decreased by $8 million to $6.2 billion in May from
the previous month, the data showed. The spot price of gold fell
0.6 percent last month.  The rand has climbed 2.7 percent against the dollar since
the beginning of March, undermining the competitiveness of
exports. The currency was at 6.768 against the dollar as of 8:20
a.m. in Johannesburg from 6.7767 before the data was released.  “We have an overvalued currency driven by flows of
capital,” hurting manufacturing industry, Trade Minister Rob Davies said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
