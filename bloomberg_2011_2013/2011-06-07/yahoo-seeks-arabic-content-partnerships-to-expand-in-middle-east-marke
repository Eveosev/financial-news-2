Yahoo! Inc. Chief Executive Officer
 Carol Bartz  said there is a “huge opportunity” for Internet
growth in the Middle East, where the search-engine provider is
seeking more Arabic-language content partners.  “The Middle East and North Africa is one of the most
exciting markets for us at Yahoo, with a combination of rapid
user growth and a very attractive advertising market with
incredible potential,” an e-mailed Yahoo statement cited Bartz
as telling reporters in Dubai today.  “Arabic is also one of the fastest-growing languages on
the Internet, yet only 1 percent of online content is in Arabic
today,” she said. Part of Yahoo’s investment in the region “is
to facilitate the growth of the Arabic language online.”  Yahoo acquired the Arabic-language Internet venture
 Maktoob.com Inc.  in 2009. Yahoo Maktoob has become the second-
largest news destination in the region after Doha-based Al
Jazeera, according to the statement. It also has the largest
market share of display advertising in the  Middle East  and North
Africa, at 40 percent, according to the statement.  Yahoo, based in Sunnyvale,  California , plans to invest more
in video on demand to provide content from popular Arabic-
language television series, films and music videos, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
