President  Barack Obama ’s gain in
public estimation from the killing of  Osama bin Laden  has
evaporated and two out of three people disapprove of his
handling of the  U.S. economy , a Washington Post-ABC News poll
indicated.  Fifty-seven percent of those questioned said the economy
hasn’t started to recover and, while 42 percent were of the
opinion that a recovery has started, only 7 percent said it’s a
strong one.  Obama came out higher than five of six potential Republican
candidates in the poll; Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney,
however, is level with Obama at 47 percent, according to the
poll.  A random national sample of 1,002 adults was questioned by
phone between June 2 and June 5. The results of the survey have
a sampling-error margin of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points,
the Post said.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
