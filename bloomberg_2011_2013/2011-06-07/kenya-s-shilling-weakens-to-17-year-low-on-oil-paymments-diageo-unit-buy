Kenya ’s shilling depreciated to the
weakest in 17 years against the dollar as oil importers bought
the U.S. currency to make payments and on bets Diageo Plc’s
Kenyan unit was buying dollars to pay for its purchase of
SABMiller Plc’s 20 percent stake in Kenya Breweries Ltd.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy slumped as
much as 0.9 percent to 87.75 per dollar and was trading 0.8
percent down at 87.65 by 5:41 p.m. in the capital, Nairobi. A
close of this level will be the weakest since March 1994.  Oil, which has climbed 8.2 percent this year, fell in  New
York  on speculation that OPEC may raise output quotas when the
group meets in Vienna tomorrow. Diageo’s  East African Breweries
Ltd. (EABL)  agreed to buy SABMiller’s’ stake in Kenya Breweries for
19.5 billion shillings ($225 million) as part of an agreement to
end cross shareholdings in each other’s operations, it said
yesterday.  “The weakening of the shilling is being driven by increase
demand from oil importers and speculation of East African
Breweries buying dollars to enable it pay for the 20 percent
stake,” Julius Kiriinya, a dealer at Nairobi-based African
Banking Corp., said in a phone interview today.  Kenya’s inflation rate, which jumped to a 25-month high in
May, is expected to rise further this year as dry weather curbs
agricultural production, central bank Governor Njuguna Ndung’u
said on yesterday.  Kenya’s monetary policy committee raised the benchmark
interest rate by a quarter percentage point to 6.25 percent and
the  cash reserve ratio  by a quarter of a percentage point to
4.75 percent, the central bank said on May 31.  Finance Minister  Uhuru Kenyatta  is expected to present the
budget for the 2011/2012 fiscal year tomorrow in the national
parliament.  To contact the reporter on this story:
