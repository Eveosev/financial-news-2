Private-equity firms may be starting
a wave of leveraged buyouts that could help companies with
strong potential to be acquired perform better than the overall
market, according to  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ’s Bankim Chadha.  Firms have more than $1.5 trillion in purchasing power
available to finance deals and possible target companies have
cash flow levels that can support debt repayments,  New York- 
based Chadha, the firm’s chief U.S. equity strategist, wrote in
a note today. Investors should consider buying a basket of 50
stocks, including  Gap Inc. (GPS)  and  Symantec Corp. (SYMC) , deemed the top
potential LBO candidates in the  Standard & Poor’s  1500 Index, he
said.  Global merger and acquisition activity has picked up this
year, increasing 22 percent by dollar value to $1.04 trillion
compared with the same period in 2010, Bloomberg data show.
Companies are beginning to spend their record cash hoards and
take on debt after credit markets dried up following the 2008
stock-market rout. The availability of financing and low rates,
along with corporate free cash flow and sales growth potential
mean private-equity deals will follow, Chadha says.  “We think conditions are very supportive of an up cycle in
LBOs,” Chadha wrote. “Credit markets are robust, equity
valuations look attractive, and corporate fundamentals strong.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
