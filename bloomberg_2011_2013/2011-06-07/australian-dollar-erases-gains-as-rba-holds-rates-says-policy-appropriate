The Australian dollar fell, erasing
earlier gains, after the central bank held borrowing costs
unchanged and said current policy settings are “appropriate.”  The so-called Aussie declined to $1.0703 as of 2:33 p.m. in
Sydney from $1.0744 before the decision and $1.0713 yesterday in
 New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
