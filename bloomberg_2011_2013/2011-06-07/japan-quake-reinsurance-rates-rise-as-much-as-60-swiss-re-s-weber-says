Reinsurers, taking record first-
quarter losses on  Japan ’s earthquake and other disasters, are
raising prices for coverage of temblors in the Asian nation by
as much as 60 percent, Swiss Reinsurance Co. said.  “On the reinsurance side, typical rate increases we have
seen on April 1 are between 20 and 50, or 20 and 60 percent,”
said Matthias Weber, head of property and specialty at Swiss Re,
the world’s second-biggest reinsurer. “Other perils increased
as well, but it’s significantly less. There it’s more of the
order of 5 to 10 percent in Japan,” Weber said today at the
Bloomberg Link Japan conference in  New York .  Reinsurers had their most costly start to a year in the
first quarter because of natural disasters including floods and
a cyclone in  Australia  and a quake in  New Zealand . The first-
quarter insured losses may exceed $52.6 billion,  according  to
Aon Benfield, the reinsurance broker of Chicago-based Aon Corp.
That compares with $40.6 billion in losses for all of 2010.  The magnitude-9 earthquake in Japan and ensuing tsunami on
March 11 damaged  Tokyo  Electric Power Co.’s nuclear plant in
Fukushima prefecture, 220 kilometers (137 miles) north of Tokyo,
leading to the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986.  The catastrophe, which Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  called the
country’s worst crisis since World War II, left more than 23,000
people dead or missing and destroyed or damaged more than
510,000 homes, according to the  National Policy Agency .  The government estimates damage from the quake and tsunami
may reach 25 trillion yen ($312 billion). Kan said he plans a
second extra budget for reconstruction after Parliament approved
a 4 trillion-yen package in May.  Insurer Losses  Munich Re , the world’s biggest reinsurer, said last month
it had a quarterly loss of 947 million euros ($1.4 billion) on
claims related to the disasters. Berkshire Hathaway Inc., run by
billionaire  Warren Buffett , said the Japan disaster alone may
lead to costs of about $1.1 billion for its insurance segment.
 American International Group Inc. (AIG) ’s first-quarter profit slumped
85 percent in part on costs tied to earthquakes.  To contact the reporters on this story:
