Serena Williams  will make her tennis
comeback at a Wimbledon warm-up event after almost a year out of
tennis through injury and illness.  The former world No. 1 received a wild-card entry for a
grass-court event in Eastbourne,  England , that starts June 11,
the U.K.’s Lawn Tennis Association said in a statement.
Wimbledon starts June 20.  Two foot operations and treatment for a blood clot in her
lung prevented Williams from playing a tournament since she won
Wimbledon last year, her 13th Grand Slam singles title.  “I am so excited to be healthy enough to compete again,”
Williams said in the LTA statement. “These past 12 months have
been extremely tough and character building.”  Serena’s sister, Venus, will also be in the main draw of
the grass-court warm-up that contains 13 of the top 20 players
including French Open champion  Li Na , the statement said.  Editors: Christopher Elser  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
