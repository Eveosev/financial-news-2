The rand strengthened against the
dollar, reversing its biggest decline in two weeks, after the
central bank’s foreign currency and gold reserves fell in May
and on reduced purchases.  The rand advanced as much as 0.7 percent to 6.7198 per
dollar and traded 0.6 percent stronger at 6.7220 at 4:18 p.m. in
Johannesburg. Earlier, the currency weakened as much as 1.1
percent to 6.8392 per dollar. It gained 0.1 percent to 9.8643
per euro.  Gross gold and foreign currency reserves declined to $50.1
billion from $50.6 billion in April, the Pretoria-based  Reserve
Bank  said on its website today. Net reserves fell to $45.9
billion from $46 billion. The figures indicate the bank bought
about $217 million dollars in May, less than the $555 million it
purchased in April, according to Standard Bank Group Ltd.  “The numbers suggest that after a period of aggressive
intervention, the authorities are doing less to combat rand
strength,”  John Cairns  and Nema Ramkhelawan, currency
strategists at Rand Merchant Bank in Johannesburg, said in a
research note. “The bottom line is that the authorities can’t
do much about the currency even if they wanted to.”  Finance Minister  Pravin Gordhan  said today  South Africa 
can’t counter currency appreciation on its own, though it would
continue to accumulate reserves “to the extent that
affordability allows.” He was responding to comments yesterday
by Trade and Industry Minister Rob Davies, who said the rand is
overvalued and the government is considering ways of limiting
currency strength.  Greek Debt Rollover  The rand extended gains, following the euro stronger, after
the  European Central Bank  signaled its approval of Greek bond
rollovers and German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  told U.S.
President  Barack Obama  the region will overcome its debt crisis.  The rand often tracks the euro, the currency of most of
South Africa’s trade, with a statistical correlation of 0.83 in
the past month. A value of 1 would mean they moved in lock step.  “We should see some slight rand recovery this morning on
the back of the euro-dollar, which remains the key intraday
indicator to watch,” Cairns and Ramkhelawan wrote.  Bonds advanced after a weekly debt sale where South African
government borrowing costs fell to a seven-month low as
investors raised bets the central bank won’t increase rates soon
to slow price advances in  Africa ’s biggest economy.  Bond Sale  The Pretoria-based Reserve Bank sold 1.4 billion rand ($207
million) of bonds maturing in 2026 at an average yield of 8.4
percent, it said on its Bloomberg page. The yield was the lowest
since the auction of Nov. 2 and 27 basis points, or 0.27
percentage point, lower than at the previous auction of the debt
on May 3. In the secondary market, the bonds climbed 0.8 percent
to 118.29 rand, lowering the yield 10 basis points, or 0.1
percentage point, to 8.38 percent.  The central bank also sold 700 million rand of notes due in
2020 at an average yield of 8.19 percent, the lowest since Nov.
9 and 11 basis points lower than at the previous auction on May
24. The debt climbed in the secondary market, reducing the yield
10 basis points to 8.14 percent.Investors bid for 1.8 times the
amount on offer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
