Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU) , the
second-largest U.S. life insurer, instituted a share-buyback
program for the first time since 2007 and said it will purchase
as much as $1.5 billion through the middle of next year.  Chief Executive Officer John Strangfeld is expanding
outside the U.S. and scaling back commodities operations as he
seeks a return on equity of 13 percent to 14 percent.  “The attainment of that is not possible without
appropriate capital deployment, and that capital deployment
either has to be investing in the business, which would be our
natural preference, or it has to be in capital management,” he
said at a conference last week.  Prudential, Allstate Corp. and Lincoln National Corp. are
among insurers returning capital to investors after unprofitable
periods in 2008 or 2009.  Newark , New Jersey-based Prudential
boosted its annual dividend 64 percent last year to $1.15 a
share, its highest payout since 2007.  Prudential’s $1.5 billion could repurchase 25.2 million
shares, based on today’s closing price of $59.56 on the New York
Stock Exchange. That represents 5.2 percent of the shares
outstanding as of April 30, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Management will time its repurchases based on “market
conditions and other considerations,” the company said in a
statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
