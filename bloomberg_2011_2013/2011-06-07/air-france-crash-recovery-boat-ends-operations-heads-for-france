The recovery of bodies and parts of
the Air  France  plane that crashed into the Atlantic Ocean two
years ago has ended.  The Ile de Sein vessel’s operations “came to an end” on
June 3 and it is heading back to France, the country’s BEA air
accident investigator said in a statement on its website today.
The boat will transfer the airplane parts and take human remains
to a forensic mortuary when it reaches France next week.  The vessel helped collect evidence, including the two
flight recorders that store data and cockpit voices, to help
explain the worst disaster in the airline’s history. An
investigation by the BEA found that the  Airbus A330  lost speed
and stalled before beginning a three-and-a-half minute plunge
into the ocean on June 1, 2009.  The crash of flight AF447 en route to Paris from  Rio de
Janeiro  killed all 228 people aboard. In total, the bodies of
127 people have been found, including 50 in the days following
the crash,  Agence France-Presse  said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
