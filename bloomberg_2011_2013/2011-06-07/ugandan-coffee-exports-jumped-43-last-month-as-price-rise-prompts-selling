Coffee exports from Uganda,  Africa ’s
second-largest grower, rose 43 percent in May as some farmers
took advantage of higher prices, according to an official at the
Uganda Coffee Development Authority.  Shipments increased to 253,270 bags from 177,380 bags a
year earlier, the official said from the capital, Kampala. The
person isn’t authorized to speak to reporters and declined to be
identified. A bag weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds).  Exports during the month surpassed an earlier forecast of
210,000 bags and 176,561 bags exported the previous month,
authority reports show. Robusta coffee traded on NYSE Liffe in
 London  was 94 percent higher in May than a year earlier. The
robusta variety accounts for 85 percent of  Uganda ’s coffee crop.  Shipments in the year to Sept. 30 may be 2.6 million bags,
the authority said April 13. Exports from the start of the
season on Oct. 1 through May declined to 1.75 million bags from
1.78 million bags a year earlier, authority figures show.  Uganda ranks behind  Ethiopia  in Africa’s coffee production.
It has experienced dry weather since December, which the
government attributes to climate change. More than 95 percent of
Uganda’s crop requires rain rather than irrigation, according to
the authority.  Uganda earned $243.6 million from the sale of beans
last season, down from $291.3 million a year earlier, according
to the authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
