South Africa â€™s  High Court  ruled that
Zimbabwean government property in South Africa can be seized to
compensate farmers whose land was taken, the  Times  reported,
citing Willie Spies, a lawyer with Afriforum, which represented
the farmers.  The court rejected an appeal by Zimbabwe of a ruling last
year that allowed three Zimbabwean farmers to have four
properties owned by the government seized after they were forced
off their farms during land grabs by Zimbabwe war veterans, the
Johannesburg-based newspaper cited Spies as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
