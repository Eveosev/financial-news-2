European stocks were little changed
as the benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index traded close to a 10-
week low. U.S. futures rose and Asian shares swung between gains
and losses.  Royal Ahold NV advanced 0.8 percent after reporting first-
quarter net income that beat analysts’ estimates.  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell 0.1 percent to
271.84 at 8:03 a.m. in  London . The gauge retreated to a 10-week
low yesterday amid mounting concern that the global economy is
weakening. Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures gained 0.4
percent, while the MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose less than 0.1
percent today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
