Qatar Telecom  QSC, the Persian Gulf
country’s biggest company by revenue, said it will close its
Virgin Mobile service following instructions from the country’s
telecommunications regulator.  The company, called Qtel, plans to migrate all existing
Virgin Mobile Service customers to its Hala service, it said in
an e-mailed statement today. Customers can also request a
refund. The country’s telecom regulator, ictQatar, said in an e-
mail sent late yesterday, that all Virgin-branded SIM cards must
be deactivated by Aug. 4.  The Qatari regulator ruled in July that Qtel broke the law
when it partnered with Virgin Mobile, an arm of Virgin Group
Ltd., to offer mobile services under the Virgin brand using the
Qtel network. That decision came after  Vodafone Qatar , Qtel’s
only competitor in the emirate, threatened to take legal action
against ictQatar for allowing the partnership.  Qtel announced its partnership with Virgin in May last year
as it faced growing competition from Vodafone Qatar, which
entered the market in 2009, breaking Qtel’s monopoly.  To contact the reporter on this story:
