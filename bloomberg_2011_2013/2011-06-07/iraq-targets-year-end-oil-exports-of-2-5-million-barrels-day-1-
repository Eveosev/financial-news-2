Iraq  is targeting year-end crude
exports of 2.5 million barrels a day compared with an average of
2.2 million barrels a day in the past five months, the country’s
oil minister said.  The Gulf state is producing 2.7 million barrels a day, Oil
Minister Abdul Kareem al-Luaibi told reporters today before the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries meeting in Vienna.  Iraq will meet with Royal Dutch Shell Plc next week in
Istanbul to discuss its southern gas joint venture, the minister
said. The current deal with Shell will lead to “losses” for
the country and if no agreement is completed, Iraq will either
cooperate with other international  oil companies  or develop the
projects through “national efforts.”  Iraq is engaged in a study to recalculate oil production
targets based on “economic benefits,” which could lead to the
country extending the “plateau period” for projects to 12-13
years while lowering production, he said.  The nation aims to increase export capacity by 1 million
barrels a day by November, when it will open a single-point
mooring facility at Basra, al-Luaibi said.  Export capacity in southern Iraq is 1.75 million barrels a
day, al-Luaibi said. The country’s total oil export revenue in
May was $7.5 billion, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
