The supply of  oil tankers  competing
for Middle East crude, the world’s biggest cargo-loading region,
fell to its lowest in almost four months as demand strengthened,
vessels cut speeds and some ships stayed in the Atlantic Ocean.  The excess of vessels seeking cargoes over the next 30 days
declined to 9 percent from 12 percent a week ago, according to
the median estimate of six shipbrokers and two owners surveyed
by Bloomberg News today. That marks the lowest supply relative
to their expected demand since Feb. 15.  An increase in Persian Gulf shipments to U.S. refineries
over the past several months left some vessels seeking cargoes
in the Atlantic Ocean, limiting their availability in the  Middle
East , said Jeff McGee, a London-based analyst at Simpson, Spence
& Young Ltd., the world’s second-largest shipbroker. Reduced
sailing speeds may also have lowered supply, he said.  Frontline Ltd., the world’s biggest operator of
supertankers, has dropped 36 percent in Oslo trading this year
as growth in the supply of vessels outpaces demand. Chairman
 John Fredriksen  said last month ship prices would collapse
within two years, at which point he would become a buyer of the
vessels again.  To contact the reporter on this story:
