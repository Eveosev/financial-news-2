Telefonos de Mexico SAB’s fees to
connect calls in rural areas will be slashed by 95 percent by
the Federal Telecommunications Commission, Reuters  reported ,
citing three unnamed sources in the phone industry.  The ruling, made in late May, hasn’t been officially
announced because the agency must formally notify Telmex, the
report said. The decision will reduce fees to 4 centavos a
minute from 75 centavos, Reuters said.  Billionaire  Carlos Slim , who controls Telmex, met with
agency personnel last week to argue against the rate reduction,
saying the company needs the fees to recoup investments in rural
areas, Reuters said, citing two unnamed people who had spoken to
meeting participants. Communications and Transportation Minister
Dionisio Perez-Jacome promised to review the decision, the
report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
