Boston Bruins  forward Nathan Horton
will miss the rest of the Stanley Cup Final with a concussion
sustained on a high hit from  Vancouver Canucks  defenseman Aaron Rome last night.  The  National Hockey League  called a disciplinary hearing
today to review the  hit  that sent Horton off the ice on a
stretcher during the Bruins’ 8-1 victory in Game 3 in  Boston .  Horton had passed the puck and was distracted when Rome
lowered his shoulder and dropped him to the ice. Rome was
assessed a 5-minute major penalty for interference and a game
misconduct.  Horton, 26, has eight goals and nine assists this
postseason for Boston, which trails 2-1 heading into Game 4 on
tomorrow night.  To contact the reporter on this story:
