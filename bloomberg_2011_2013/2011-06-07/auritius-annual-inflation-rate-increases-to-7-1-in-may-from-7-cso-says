Mauritius’s inflation rate was little
changed at 7.1 percent in May, the country’s statistics agency
said, easing pressure on the central bank to increase its
benchmark interest rate.  Inflation compared with 7 percent the month before, the
Port Louis-based Central Statistics Office said in a statement
on its website today. Prices were unchanged during the month.  The economy “has already absorbed the recent price
increases on the world market,” Renganaden Padayachy, an
economist at the Ebene-based Mauritius Chamber of Commerce &
Industry, said by phone. “On this trend, it’s highly improbable
that we will reach double-digit inflation by year-end. It is
reducing pressure on the Bank of Mauritius to increase rates.”  The central bank increased its benchmark rate by 0.5
percent to 5.25 percent on March 28 after inflation accelerated
for six consecutive months. The bank may tighten monetary policy
further if inflation gets out of control, Governor Rundheersing
Bheenick said in an interview with l’Express newspaper on May
30.  “Stability in the interest rate should prevail now,”
Padayachy said.  The rupee weakened 0.2 percent to 27.7 against the dollar
as of 11:25 a.m. in  Port Louis .  To contact the reporter on this story:
