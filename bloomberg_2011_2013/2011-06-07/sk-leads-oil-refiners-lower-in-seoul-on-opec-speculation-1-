SK Innovation Co.,  South Korea ’s
biggest oil processor, led refiners lower in Seoul trading on
speculation OPEC may raise crude output quotas, increasing
supplies in Asia.  Shares of the Seoul-based company dropped 5.8 percent to
219,500 won on the Korea Exchange, the most since May 23. The
benchmark Kospi stock index fell 0.7 percent.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will meet
in Vienna tomorrow to decide production quotas. The
 International Energy Agency  said on May 19 it saw “an urgent
need” for more oil to help bring down high prices, which have
risen 38 percent in the past year.  “OPEC is psychologically affecting Korean oil shares,”
said Park Yeon Ju, an analyst at Daewoo Securities Co., who has
buy recommendations on SK Innovation and  S-Oil Corp. (010950)  “As those
stocks have risen much this year, the speculation is providing
an excuse for them to take profits.”  S-Oil, South Korea’s third-largest refiner, fell 3.4
percent to 141,000 won, paring its gains this year to 52 percent.
SK Innovation has risen 13 percent in 2011, while the Kospi
gained 2.4 percent.  OPEC may raise output limits tomorrow by as much as 1.5
million barrels a day from actual production,  Michael Wittner ,
the New York-based head of oil-market research at Societe
Generale SA, wrote in a note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
