Buying prices for new panamax
commodity-hauling ships will drop 10 percent by the end of next
year as slumping charter rates curb owners’ vessel purchases,
said Maritime Strategies International Ltd.  Prices will “trough” in 2012’s second quarter and be at
$30 million by the end of the year, Adam Kent, a director at the
freight forecaster, said during a conference in  London  today.
That compares with around $33 million to $33.5 million now, he
said.  There are 648 panamaxes on order at shipyards worldwide,
equating to 34 percent of the trading fleet of 1,886 vessels,
according to data from Clarkson Research Securities Ltd., a unit
of the world’s biggest shipbroker. Charter rates for the vessels
provided by the  Baltic Exchange  have slipped 2.3 percent in 2011
after falling 49 percent last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
