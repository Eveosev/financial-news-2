EasyJet Plc (EZJ) ,  Europe ’s second-largest
discount carrier, started selling flexible tickets via its
website today to attract more business travelers.  EasyJet is seeking to boost its share of the lucrative
business travel market by luring customers from carriers
including British Airways and  Air France-KLM (AF)  Group. The airline
is also increasing daily flights on routes from bases in London,
Paris and Geneva to attract more business passengers.  “We have seen a growing trend of business travelers
choosing to fly EasyJet,” Chief Executive Officer Carolyn McCall said in a statement today.  EasyJet aims to lift its business travelers to 21 percent
of total passengers from 18 percent currently, McCall said in
March. Yields, a measure of fares, are higher for some business
customers as they tend to book later and pay extra for options
such as priority boarding. EasyJet had previously only sold the
tickets through business booking channels.  The flexible fares, which start at 99.99 pounds ($164),
allow passengers to change the date of their flights up to two
hours before departure, the company said. The tickets will also
let customers check a bag at no extra cost and give them
priority boarding passes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
