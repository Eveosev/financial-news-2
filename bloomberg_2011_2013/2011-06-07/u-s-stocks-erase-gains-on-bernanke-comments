U.S. stocks erased gains as Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the economic recovery has
been “uneven” and “frustratingly slow,” while giving no
indication the central bank plans a new round of stimulus.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was little changed at
1,285.85 at 3:57 p.m. in  New York  after rallying as much as 0.8
percent earlier.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
