Oil climbed for a second day in New
York after a report showed U.S. crude supplies declined the most
since December and on speculation OPEC will increase production
quotas, signaling global fuel demand will climb.  Futures gained as much as 0.7 percent after the industry-
funded  American Petroleum Institute  said crude stockpiles fell
5.5 million barrels to 366 million. OPEC will raise its output
target at a meeting in Vienna today, according to a Gulf
delegate with knowledge of the matter. The U.S. raised its
forecast for global oil consumption for this year.  “The spike can be attributed to the API data,” said
 Jonathan Barratt , managing director of Commodity Broking
Services Pty in Sydney, who predicted crude will average $100
this year. “It’s a bit of a knee-jerk reaction. The U.S. came
out with their forecast and said they expected more demand.
That’s a bullish view and as a result there may be a bit of
pressure” for OPEC to increase output, he said.  Crude for July delivery advanced as much as 70 cents to
$99.79 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange and was at $99.21 at 11:52 a.m. Sydney time. The
contract yesterday rose 8 cents to $99.09. Prices are 38 percent
higher the past year.  Brent crude  for July delivery fell 53 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $116.25 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The contract yesterday gained $2.30, or 2
percent, to $116.78. Prices are up 61 percent the past year.  OPEC Quotas  The European benchmark contract traded at a premium of
$17.05 a barrel to U.S. futures yesterday. The difference
between front-month contracts in  London  and New York reached a
record $19.54 on Feb. 21. It averaged 76 cents last year.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will
raise its production quota for the first time since 2008 to help
replace lost Libyan supplies and meet growth in demand later
this year, a Gulf delegate said.  OPEC is producing 2 million barrels a day above its
official ceiling, the delegate said, declining to be named
because he isn’t authorized to speak publicly. An increase in
the output targets would help replace missing supplies from
 Libya  and meet demand-growth projections for later this year.  Production quotas will likely increase by 1.5 million
barrels a day, analysts from Societe Generale SA and Morgan
Stanley said in reports yesterday. That would be about a quarter
of the group’s spare capacity, based on Bloomberg estimates.  U.S. Imports  OPEC had 5.94 million barrels a day in spare capacity in
May, down 2.7 percent from April, based on Bloomberg estimates.
Spare capacity was 6.31 million barrels a day in March, the
highest level since May 2009.  U.S. crude-oil supplies last week fell the most since the
week ended Dec. 31, according to the American Petroleum
Institute. Gasoline supplies declined 390,000 barrels to 212.3
million, the report said.  Crude imports dropped 11.9 percent, the third-biggest
decline this year. Starting May 29, the 591,000-barrel a day
Keystone pipeline, operated by TransCanada Corp., was shut
because of a leak at a pump station. The system extends from
 Alberta  to the Nymex delivery point at Cushing,  Oklahoma .  Stockpiles at the Petroleum Administration for Defense
District 2, which includes the Midwest states of Illinois and
Oklahoma, fell by 2.6 million barrels last week, the largest
decline since October. Cushing supplies slid 1.5 million barrels
to the lowest since Feb. 25.  DOE Report  An Energy Department report today may show crude
inventories slipped by 1.38 million barrels while gasoline
stockpiles increased by 1.05 million, according to a Bloomberg
News survey of analysts.  Oil-supply totals from the American Petroleum Institute and
DOE have moved in the same direction 72 percent of the time over
the past year. The API collects stockpile information on a
voluntary basis from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and
pipelines. The government requires that reports be filed with
the Energy Department for its weekly survey.  The U.S. Energy Department raised its forecast for global
oil consumption for this year to 88.43 million barrels a day
from 88.08 million in May, according to its monthly Short-Term
Energy Outlook, released yesterday. It cut its price forecast to
an average $101.91 for 2011 from $102.67 last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
