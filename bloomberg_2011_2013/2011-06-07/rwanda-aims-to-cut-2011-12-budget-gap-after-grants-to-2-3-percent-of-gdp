Rwanda plans to narrow its budget gap
to 2.3 percent of gross domestic product in the year through
June 2012 on increased donor grants and  tax revenue , said Fred
Quarshie, an adviser to the Minister of Finance and  Economic
Planning .  The shortfall will shrink from 4.2 percent in the current
fiscal year, Quarshie said by phone yesterday.  The deficit before grants will narrow to 13.7 percent of
GDP from 15 percent, Quarshie said. Grants to the government
will increase 19 percent to 444.7 billion Rwandan francs ($743
million), while tax revenue is expected to rise by 57.7 billion
francs to 501.4 billion.  Spending will increase to 1.12 trillion francs from 984
billion, according to a statement from the Ministry of Finance
yesterday. The full budget will be presented to parliament later
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
