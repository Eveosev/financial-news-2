Brazil’s Center South, the world’s
largest producing region, will harvest an estimated 33 million
tons of sugar this year, less than previously expected on lower
crop yields, said Raizen, a sugar cane venture between Cosan SA
Industria & Comercio and  Royal Dutch Shell Plc. (RDSA)   “Crop yields and sucrose content are even lower than we
had expected,” Pedro Mizutani, operations vice president at
Raizen, the world’s largest sugar-cane processor, said today in
an interview. “We are falling short about 4 percent compared
with the Unica industry association numbers.”  Sugar output in Brazil’s Center South, which accounts for
about 90 percent of the country’s sugar and ethanol production,
is estimated at 34.5 million metric tons, Unica said March 31.  Cane output in the region is estimated between 555 million
tons and 560 million tons this year, Mizutani said at an ethanol
conference in  Sao Paulo . That is less than Unica’s estimate of
568.5 million tons.  Brazil  is the world’s largest sugar producer. It accounts
for about 54 percent of the world’s exports, according to the
 U.S. Department of Agriculture .  To contact the reporter on this story:
