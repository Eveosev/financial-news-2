Kuwait ’s investment companies will
only need a single license to operate lending and investment
businesses, said Asaad al-Banwan, chairman of the Union of
Investment Companies.  The Central Bank of Kuwait sent a circular to investment
companies last month asking them to “reconsider their
positions,” Al-Banwan said in an e-mailed statement today. The
circular “is not forcing the companies to do anything,” though
they can choose to secure two licenses for each business, he
said.  Local newspapers, citing the circular, have said investment
companies will be required to seek separate licenses to operate
the two businesses to avoid any overlap in supervision by the
central bank and the newly formed  Capital Markets Authority .  The Kuwait City-based union represents the country’s
investment companies and has 44 members, according its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
