The International Monetary Fund’s 26
billion-euro ($38.1 billion) loan to  Portugal  “entails
important risks,” the agency’s staff said in a report prepared
to assess the country’s request for assistance.  The measures attached to the loan “may fail to alleviate
sovereign debt concerns, with an adverse impact on government
financing prospects,” IMF staff wrote in a May 17 report that
was posted on the fund’s website today. “In particular,
refinancing risks from the closure or contraction of the
Treasury bills market represent a near-term refinancing risk for
the government.”  Other threats cited by the IMF staff include the needed
support from Portugal’s population and from the political class,
lower-than-expected growth and deepening problems in other
European countries.  The IMF approved the loan May 20 as part of a joint 78-
billion bailout with the European Union in the latest effort to
stem the region’s sovereign-debt crisis. On June 5, Socialist
Prime Minister Jose Socrates was unseated by opposition  Social
Democrats .  “Higher funding costs, rating downgrades, increasing non-
performing loans, and portfolio losses could generate additional
liquidity and solvency pressures on banks,” the IMF staff
wrote. “Resort to public recapitalization could have
macroeconomic, fiscal, and confidence effects.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
