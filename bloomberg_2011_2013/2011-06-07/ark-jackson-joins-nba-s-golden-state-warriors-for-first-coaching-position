Former  New York  Knicks All-Star guard
Mark Jackson was selected as the new coach of the  Golden State
Warriors , his first coaching job at any level.  Jackson, 46, who has been part of ABC’s broadcast team for
the National Basketball Association Finals, played 17 seasons in
the NBA for seven teams and ranks third in career assists with
 10,334 .  “He epitomized leadership as a player in this league,”
Warriors owner Joe Lacob said in an e-mailed release. “We think
that characteristic -- and many other positive traits -- will
translate very well into his coaching duties with our young
team.”  Terms of the agreement weren’t disclosed by the team.  Jackson replaces Keith Smart, who wasn’t retained by the
Warriors after going 36-46 in his one season leading the club.  “I’m really elated about this opportunity and I’m looking
forward to the challenge of building the Warriors into a
perennial contender,” Jackson said in the team release.  A native of  Brooklyn , New York, Jackson played at St.
John’s University with former Warriors General Manager Chris Mullin before being chosen as NBA Rookie of the Year in 1987-88
with the Knicks. He was an All-Star in 1988-89.  The Warriors, who have made the postseason once since 1994,
were bought by Lacob and Peter Guber for a record $450 million
in July 2010 from Chris Cohan.  On May 20, the team announced that  Jerry West , who won
seven championships as a player and front-office executive for
the  Los Angeles Lakers , had joined the Warriors as a board
member.  To contact the reporter on this story:
