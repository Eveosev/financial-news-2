Copper declined for the first time in
three days, joining a drop in global equities and other
commodities including oil, on speculation slowing economic
growth may trim metals demand.  The metal for three-month delivery fell as much as 0.4
percent to $9,100 a metric ton by 8:03 a.m. Singapore time. The
metal had risen 2.4 percent in the past two days on concern
output disruptions in  Chile  may worsen an expected shortage of
the metal this year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
