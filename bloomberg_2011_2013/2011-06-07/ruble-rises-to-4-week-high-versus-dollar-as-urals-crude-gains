The ruble strengthened to its highest
level in four weeks versus the dollar as  Russia ’s Urals crude-
oil export blend climbed.  The ruble appreciated 0.4 percent to 27.7226 per dollar at
the 5 p.m. close in Moscow, its strongest since May 11. The
Russian currency was little changed at 40.6801 per euro, leaving
it steady at 33.5535 versus the central bank’s target dollar-
euro basket.  Urals rose 0.4 percent to $112.23 a barrel after a 2.1
percent drop yesterday. Futures trading in  New York  retreated
after a Gulf delegate with knowledge of the matter said the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will increase its
production quota tomorrow to help replace missing supplies from
Libya and meet demand growth. Crude for July delivery added as
much as 30 cents earlier.  Russia’s currency may strengthen “a little bit more”
against the dollar,  Gaelle Blanchard , an emerging-market analyst
at Societe Generale SA in  London , wrote in response to e-mailed
questions. “But if coming economic data continue to be weak
this will fuel worries about the global growth outlook and could
weigh on  oil prices .”  The yield on Russia’s dollar bonds due in 2020 fell two
basis points to 4.54 percent. Ruble notes due in August 2016
rose, with the yield falling four basis points to 7.44 percent.
The yield on Russia’s ruble Eurobond due in 2018 declined five
basis points to 6.81 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
