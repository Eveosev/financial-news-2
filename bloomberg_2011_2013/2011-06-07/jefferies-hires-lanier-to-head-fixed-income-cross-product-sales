Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF) , the investment
bank that’s been expanding since the financial crisis, hired
Clifford Lanier to head fixed-income cross-product sales.  Lanier was a managing director in fixed income and head of
generalist sales at Frankfurt-based  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , New York-
based Jefferies said today in a statement. He was also a
director in Merrill Lynch & Co.’s fixed-income strategic
solutions group, according to the statement.  Jefferies has been building its fixed-income business by
hiring employees from  UBS AG (UBSN) , Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley
this year. The firm hired Jerome Doyle from UBS as a managing
director in its municipal-securities trading unit. Jefferies
also added Sean George and Richard Roche, from Deutsche Bank and
 Morgan Stanley (MS) , respectively, as managing directors and senior
traders in its investment-grade corporate-bond business.  Lanier’s “experience in cross-product sales will make a
meaningful and immediate contribution as we continue the
expansion of our global fixed-income business,” William Jennings and Johan Eveland, global co-heads of fixed income,
said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
