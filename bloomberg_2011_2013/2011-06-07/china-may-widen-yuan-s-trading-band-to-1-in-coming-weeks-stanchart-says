China  may widen the yuan’s trading
band in the “next few weeks” as policy makers favor a more
flexible  exchange rate  to combat inflation, according to
Standard Chartered Plc.  The range may be widened to allow the currency to trade as
much as 1 percent on either side of a daily fixing set by the
People’s Bank of China, currency strategists Callum Henderson
and  Robert Minikin  wrote in a research note today. It was last
widened to 0.5 percent from 0.3 percent in May 2007. The yuan is
allowed to swing as much as 3 percent on either side of
reference rates versus the euro, yen and  Hong Kong  dollar.  “A wider trading band could create the conditions for
modestly faster appreciation near-term to temper persistent
inflation,” Henderson and Minikin wrote in the report.
“Another big one-off revaluation looks unlikely, as officials
have ruled this out and because the global economy is slowing.”  Government data due June 14 is expected to show inflation
accelerated to 5.5 percent last month from 5.3 percent in April,
according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of
economists. That would be the fastest pace since July 2008. A
stronger yuan helps limit price gains by making imports cheaper.  Standard Chartered  reiterated a recommendation that
investors buy the yuan using 12-month non-deliverable forwards,
predicting an appreciation to 6.2 per dollar. The contract was
little changed today at 6.3620 as of 9:13 a.m. in Hong Kong, a
1.8 percent premium to the spot rate of 6.4796 at the end of
last week in  Shanghai , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Financial markets in China were closed yesterday for a holiday.  Henderson and Minikin also noted “increasing value” for
shorter-dated yuan forwards. The one-month contract was little
changed at 6.4780, a 0.02 percent premium to the spot rate.  The currency reached a 17-year high of 6.4777 on June 1 and
the central bank set its reference rate versus the dollar at
6.4816 today, the strongest level since July 2005.  To contact the reporters on this story:
