The Polish zloty advanced on
predictions that the central bank will raise interest rates for
the fourth time this year as inflation accelerates.  The zloty added 0.2 percent to 3.9485 per euro as of 2:43
p.m. in Warsaw. One-month forward contracts, used to gauge
investors interest-rate expectations, rose five basis points,
trading 22 basis points above three-month Warsaw Interbank
Offered Rate.  The Narodowy Bank Polski in Warsaw will increase the
benchmark seven-day interest rate by a quarter point to 4.5
percent when it concludes its two-day meeting tomorrow,
according to 26 of 33 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Seven
analysts predicted the rate won’t be changed.  “Everyone seems to be discounting a rate increase
tomorrow,” said  Nigel Rendell , an emerging-market strategist at
RBC Capital in  London . “If they don’t do it we may see the
zloty weaken.”  Polish policymakers accelerated rate increases, adding 75
basis points to the benchmark in three steps this year, on
concern that inflation will boost expectations for higher prices
and spur wages demands. The Polish inflation rate rose to 4.5
percent in April from 4.3 percent in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
