Swansea City will sign striker 
Danny Graham for a club-record 3.5 million pounds ($5.8 million)
from Watford, the Welsh soccer club said on its website.  Swansea won promotion to the Premier League with a playoff
victory over Reading last month.  The Swans said they agreed today on personal terms with 25-
year-old Graham, who will sign on a four-year contract. Watford
will receive 15 percent of any profit above the 3.5 million
pounds if heâ€™s sold on.  Graham was top scorer in the Championship with 24 goals
last season.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
