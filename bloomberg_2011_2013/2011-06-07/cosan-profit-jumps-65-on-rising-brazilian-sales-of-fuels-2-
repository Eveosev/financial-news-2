Cosan SA Industria & Comercio, which
jointly controls the world’s largest sugar-cane processor with
 Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , said quarterly profit jumped 65 percent
on increasing sales of ethanol, gasoline and lubricants.  Net income rose to 486.8 million reais ($309.1 million) in
the fiscal fourth quarter that ended March 31, from 294.7
million reais a year earlier,  Barra Bonita , Brazil-based Cosan
said today in a statement. Profit of 159 million reais excluding
some items was expected by the average of four analysts in a
Bloomberg survey.  Demand for fuel in Latin American’s largest economy is
increasing after it expanded for a sixth straight quarter,
growing 4.2 percent from a year earlier in the first three
months of this year. About 42 percent of  Brazil ’s cars have
engines that can run on gasoline or just ethanol, according to
the country’s Anfavea automakers association.  Cosan’s revenue from fuels grew 12 percent from a year
earlier in the quarter to 2.68 billion reais, pushed by sales of
diesel and gasoline. Sugar sales fell 19 percent to 985.1
million reais after a drought pared cane output.  Cosan gained 21 centavos, or 0.9 percent, to 24.81 reais in
 Sao Paulo  trading at 10:42 a.m.  New York  time. Before today, the
stock dropped about 10.2 percent this year, more than the 8.1
percent decline in the benchmark Bovespa index.  Raw sugar for July delivery advanced 0.48 cent, or 2
percent, to $0.2407 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.  Cosan reported earnings under International Financial
Reporting Standards for the first time and provided comparable
year-earlier figures using the same guidelines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
