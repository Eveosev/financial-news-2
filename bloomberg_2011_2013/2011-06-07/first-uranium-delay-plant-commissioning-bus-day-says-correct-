(Corrects spelling of name in second paragraph.)  First Uranium Corp. (FIU)  plans to postpone
the commissioning of its uranium plant at its tailings treatment
business in  South Africa  to conserve cash, Business Day
reported, citing Chief Executive Officer Deon van der Mescht.  The Mine Waste Solutions plant was to be commissioned in
September and may be delayed to next year, the Johannesburg-
based newspaper cited Van der Mescht as saying. The decision is
to keep cash ahead of a convertible debenture maturing in June
next year, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
