Siemens AG (SIE) , Europe’s largest
engineering company, plans to refinance at least $5 billion of
credit lines ahead of maturity, two people familiar with the
situation said.  Lenders have held discussions with the company to renew,
possibly in the third quarter, financing due in March, said the
people, who declined to be identified because the talks are
private.  Siemens won the lowest interest rate on a European company
loan in nearly a decade in 2005 when it arranged the deal with
Deutsche Bank AG, Citigroup Inc. and six other banks. The credit
cost 15 basis points more than the London interbank offered rate
on drawn funds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Alexander Becker, a spokesman for Munich-based Siemens,
declined to comment. The company said May 4 it expects profit
this year to rise at least 75 percent, more than it previously
anticipated, as customers buy more industrial equipment and a
unit overhaul starts to pay off.  Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings rank Siemens’s debt A+.  Banks have reduced the average interest they charge for
loans to similarly rated companies in  Europe  to 37.5 basis
points this year from 80 basis points more than benchmark
lending rates in 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
