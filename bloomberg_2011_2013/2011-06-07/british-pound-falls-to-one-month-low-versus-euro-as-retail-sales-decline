The pound weakened against the euro
for a sixth straight day after a report showed U.K. retail sales
unexpectedly declined in May.  Sterling also dropped against the  New Zealand dollar  and
Swedish krona after the British Retail Consortium said sales at
stores open at least 12 months, measured by value, fell 2.1
percent from a year earlier, compared with a 5.2 percent
increase in April. Economists had forecast a 2 percent gain. The
U.K. Debt Management Office plans to auction 1 billion pounds
($1,635) of inflation-linked bonds due in March 2040 today.  The pound slipped 0.3 percent to 89.41 pence per euro as of
7:36 a.m. in  London , the weakest since May 5. Sterling climbed
less than 0.1 percent to $1.6370 and gained 0.3 percent to
131.44 yen.  The pound fell and U.K. government bonds rose yesterday
amid deepening concern that the governmentâ€™s austerity drive is
damping growth and will compel the central bank to keep  interest
rates  on hold for longer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
