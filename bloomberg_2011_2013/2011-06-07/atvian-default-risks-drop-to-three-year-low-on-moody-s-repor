The cost of insuring Latvian bonds
against non-payment fell to the lowest in three years after
Moody’s Investors Service yesterday raised its outlook on the
Baltic country’s debt to positive from stable.  Latvian credit-default swaps declined to 194.8 basis points
at 10:30 a.m. in  London , the cheapest level since June 2008, CMA
prices show. Credit-default swap prices drop as investor
perceptions of the borrower’s creditworthiness improve.  To contact the reporter on this story:
