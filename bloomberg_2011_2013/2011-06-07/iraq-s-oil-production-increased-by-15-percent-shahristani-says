Iraq ’s oil production has risen to
2.63 million barrels a day, up by 15 percent from the same
period last year, according to Hussain al-Shahristani, deputy
prime minister for energy affairs.  Crude exports averaged 2.18 million barrels a day in the
first five months of 2011 and are expected to increase in the
second half of the year, he said during a Cabinet meeting on the
government’s performance in its first 100 days.  Revenue from the exports in the first five months reached
$34.1 billion, which exceeds the $25.4 billion forecast by the
government for the period, he said.  “This is due to the increase in export levels and the rise
in world oil prices,” he said.  Prices averaged $103.6 a barrel, he said.  Two offshore mooring facilities with a total capacity of
1.8 million barrels a day will start operating in the southern
oil hub of Basra at the end of the year, and two more with
similar capacity will open in early 2012, he said.  Iraq, home to the world’s fifth-biggest oil reserves, needs
foreign investment and expertise to help boost energy exports
and rebuild an economy shattered by years of conflict, economic
sanctions and sabotage. The country has signed 15 gas and oil
licenses since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that ousted the regime
of former President  Saddam Hussein . Exports from the semi-
autonomous Kurdish region resumed last month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
