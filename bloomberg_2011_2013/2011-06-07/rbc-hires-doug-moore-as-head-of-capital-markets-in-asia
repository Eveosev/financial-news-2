Royal Bank of Canada (RY) , the country’s
largest lender by assets, said it hired Doug Moore as head of
 RBC Capital Markets  in Asia.  Moore, based in Hong Kong, has 23 years of business and
financial experience, which included building a financial
services business for Credit Suisse in Hong Kong, the Toronto-
based bank said today in an e-mailed statement. Moore, 53, will
be responsible for expanding the firm’s business in Asia, and
will report to Mark Standish and Doug McGregor, co-chief
executive officers of RBC Capital Markets.  Moore’s appointment follows RBC Capital Markets’
announcement in November of a new trading floor in Hong Kong,
doubling its capacity.  RBC also said Andrew Turczyniak, CEO of the firm’s
operations in  Hong Kong , will be head of strategic
relationships.  To contact the reporter on this story:
