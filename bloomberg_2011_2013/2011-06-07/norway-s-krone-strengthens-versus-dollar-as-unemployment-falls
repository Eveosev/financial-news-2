Norway’s krone appreciated against 12
of its 16 major counterparts as a report showed unemployment
declined more than expected in May, reinforcing speculation that
central bankers will increase borrowing costs.  The krone advanced versus the dollar as the non-seasonally
adjusted jobless rate fell to 2.5 percent from 2.8 percent in
April, the  Labor and Welfare Organization  said today in a
statement. That’s the lowest in 18 months. The median forecast
of nine economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for a drop to 2.6
percent. Sweden’s krona also strengthened.  “The labor market data is a concern for the Norges Bank,”
said  Carl Hammer , chief foreign-exchange strategist at SEB AB in
 Stockholm . “There should be some concern of rising wage growth,
and we are pencilling in gradual rate hikes, with another two
increases likely this year.”  The krone strengthened 0.6 percent versus the dollar to
5.3486 as of 10:22 a.m. in London. The Norwegian currency was
little changed at 7.8462 per euro.  Sweden’s krona appreciated 0.7 percent to 6.1458 per
dollar. It gained 0.1 percent versus the euro to 9.0164.  The Norwegian central bank raised its benchmark rate on May
12 to 2.25 percent from 2 percent, its first increase in a year.
The bank has signaled it will raise its rate to an average of
2.49 percent in the fourth quarter and to 3.92 percent by the
final three months of next year.  Norway’s consumer confidence index slipped to 27.7 in the
second quarter, down from 29.2 in the previous quarter, a survey
by Finance Norway also showed today.  Norway’s krone has climbed 2.7 percent against a basket of
nine developed-market peers this year, according to Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes, the fourth best
performance among the 10 currencies tracked by the measure.
Sweden’s krone is the third-best performer, adding 3.1 percent,
the indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
