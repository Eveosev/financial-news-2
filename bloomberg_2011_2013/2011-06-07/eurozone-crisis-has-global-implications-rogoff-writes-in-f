If the euro survives and subsequently
achieves a status equivalent to that of the dollar as a reserve
currency, it will provide an impetus toward currency
consolidation elsewhere, said  Kenneth Rogoff , an economics
professor at  Harvard University .  Writing in the Financial Times, Rogoff said that if, on the
other hand, the eurozone is pulled apart, many decades could
elapse before any other region adopts a similar program.  At present it looks as though the euro, which was meant to
give greater resilience in the face of financial crisis,
amplifies shocks rather than otherwise, for Europe’s peripheral
countries are in weak competitive positions and no currency
depreciation mechanism is available to them, Rogoff wrote.  European leaders’ plans to achieve effective devaluation
through wage adjustment seem fanciful; the only clean rescue
would be if European growth far exceeded expectations, which is
unlikely, he said.  The question now is whether the common currency is
sustainable politically; if the global economy doesn’t soon
resume rapid growth, an answer won’t be long delayed, Rogoff
concluded.  To contact the reporter on this story:
