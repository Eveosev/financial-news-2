Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) 
will develop new and existing mines in  North America , where
output will continue to play a significant role in boosting
global copper supplies, Harry Conger, the head of Freeport’s
Americas unit, said today at a Metal Bulletin conference in New
York.  Freeport, the world’s largest publicly traded copper
producer, is projecting higher sales though 2013. Chief
Executive Officer Richard Adkerson is moving to counter falling
output by resuming operations suspended during the financial
crisis of 2008 and 2009. The Phoenix-based company restarted its
Chino copper mine in  New Mexico  in April and has begun mining at
the Miami project in  Arizona .  To contact the reporters on this story:
