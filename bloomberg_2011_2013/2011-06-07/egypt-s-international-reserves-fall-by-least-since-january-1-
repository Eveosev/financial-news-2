Egypt ’s international reserves
dropped in May by the smallest amount since January, when a
revolt that toppled President  Hosni Mubarak  started.  Net international reserves declined to $27.2 billion from
$28 billion in April, the fifth straight monthly drop, according
to central bank data published today on its  website . Reserves
peaked at $36 billion in December and fell to $35 billion in
January. Reserves slipped to $30.1 billion in March from $33.3
billion in the previous month, central bank data show.  “This is a positive indicator,” Mona Mansour, co-head of
research at Cairo-based investment bank CI Capital, said of the
slower decline. “As security improves and when there are smooth
operations for business, this will reflect positively on the
reserves,” she said by phone, adding that it’s difficult to
predict when the decline will be reversed.  The turmoil that accompanied the uprising that unseated
Mubarak in February has crimped revenue from tourism, industrial
output and taxes. The  International Monetary Fund  has forecast
that economic growth may slow to 1 percent this year, the lowest
rate since 1992.  To contact the reporter on this story:
