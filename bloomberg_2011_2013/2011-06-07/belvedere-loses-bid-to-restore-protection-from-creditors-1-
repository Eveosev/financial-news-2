Belvedere SA (BVD) , the maker of Sobieski
vodka, lost a bid to restore its protection from creditors that
was lost in April, a group representing bondholders said today
following a French appeals-court ruling.  “The company must now assume the consequences and face up
to its obligations,” the investors said in a statement after
today’s decision at the court in Dijon,  France . The group called
for “real negotiations concerning debt repayment” with
Belvedere.  The vodka maker lost its creditor-protection status after
failing to meet the obligations to sell off assets laid out in
its recovery plan, according to the floating rate note holders’
statement.  Belvedere filed for pre-insolvency protection in 2008 after
breaching the FRN covenant by repurchasing more of its stock
than terms allowed. That could have enabled holders of the FRN
notes to ask for early repayment on notes due in 2013. A
recovery plan was approved by the court in November 2009.  Alain Ribeyre, a lawyer for Belvedere, didn’t immediately
return calls for comment. Belvedere “honored in full its
obligation to pay the first installment of the plan,” the
company said in  April  when announcing it would appeal.  Belvedere shares were suspended today at the company’s
request pending the announcement of the decision.  To contact the reporter on this story:
