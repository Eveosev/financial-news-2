Antena 3 de Television SA (A3TV)  and Gestora
De Inversiones Audiovisuales La Sexta SA resumed merger talks,
 Cinco Dias  reported, citing unidentified people close to the
matter.  Last February, Antena 3 Chairman Jose Manuel Lara showed an
interest in resuming talks after an initial attempt failed over
how to distribute management roles in the resulting group, the
newspaper said.  Antena 3 shares climbed 1.3 percent to 5.58 euros at 9:43
a.m. trading in  Madrid .  To contact the reporter on this story:
