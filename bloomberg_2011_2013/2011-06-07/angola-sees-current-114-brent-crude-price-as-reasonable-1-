OPEC-member  Angola  is comfortable
with current prices for  Brent crude  of $114 to $115 a barrel,
the country’s oil minister said before flying to Vienna for the
group’s meeting to review its target for oil production.  “At that level it can be considered acceptable,” Jose Maria Botelho de Vasconcelos said today in the country’s capital
city, Luanda. “For us, the price is reasonable, is good.”  Angola is one of 12 members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries. The group meets tomorrow to
consider a possible increase in output amid signs that  oil
prices  may be hurting the global economy. July contracts of
Brent crude, a benchmark for Angolan oil, were trading at
$114.45 a barrel, down 3 cents, at 12:13 p.m. on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  Angola, which vies with  Nigeria  as Africa’s top oil
producer, will not reach its annual target of 1.9 million
barrels a day, de Vasconcelos said. “As a yearly average, it
will not be possible,” he said. “We’re working to recover
production that fell by the end of last year, mainly in Block 18
where the production drop was drastic.”  The nation’s output in May averaged 1.6 million barrels to
1.65 million barrels a day, “very far from 1.9 million planned
in the state budget,” he said. Angola pumped 1.61 million
barrels a day on average last year, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Sonangol Holdings, the state oil company, continues to look
for a new partner to take over the stake that  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) 
holds in the Block 31 concession, de Vasconcelos said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
