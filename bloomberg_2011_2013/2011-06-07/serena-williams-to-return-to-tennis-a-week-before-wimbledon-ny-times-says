Serena Williams  will return to tennis
the week before Wimbledon after being sidelined almost a year
with injuries, the  New York Times  reported.  Williams, 29, who has 13 Grand Slam singles titles and was
ranked No. 1 in the world until last October, will return for a
grass-court tournament in Eastbourne,  England , on June 13 and
then seek to defend her Wimbledon title starting June 20, the
newspaper reported.  Two foot operations and treatment for a blood clot in her
lung have prevented the American from playing a tournament since
Wimbledon last year. There was no news of a return on Williamsâ€™s
 website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
