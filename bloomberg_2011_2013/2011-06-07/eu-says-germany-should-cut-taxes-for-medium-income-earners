The European Commission said  Germany 
should cut taxes for low and middle-income earners, lending
support to a demand of the junior partner in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government.  “Addressing the tax wedge, which remains high especially
for low and middle incomes, would improve incentives to work
while allowing wage increases to be translated to a greater
extent into higher disposable incomes and domestic demand,” the
commission said in a report published in Brussels today.  The tax reductions should be part of a “growth-friendly
consolidation course” and be done in a way that doesn’t swell
the  budget deficit , the commission said. While risks to the
budgetary outlook “appear broadly balanced” in 2011, the
shortfall in coming years may exceed forecasts, it said.  The pro-market Free Democrats are seeking more than 10
billion euros ($15 billion) in tax cuts for people on middle and
lower incomes or a reduction of the so-called solidarity
surcharge paid on income tax, Bild newspaper reported May 27,
citing unnamed party officials. A reduction of the surcharge is
“not an issue,” Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble ’s
spokesman, Martin Kotthaus, said May 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
