Barclays Plc (BARC) , unsuccessfully sued by
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. for $11 billion, is seeking
dismissal of the defunct firm’s remaining claim for $500 million
in allegedly unpaid bonuses.  Lehman asked a U.S. bankruptcy judge in May to rule on its
claim, saying the U.K. bank didn’t pay all of the $2 billion in
bonuses it agreed to when it bought Lehman’s North American
business in 2008. Barclays, which has said it paid all the
required bonuses and other compensation, said it would ask Judge
James Peck in Manhattan on June 17 to dismiss the complaint,
according to a court filing.  “There can be no genuine dispute that the $2 billion
number that was listed on the 9/16/08 financial schedule
initialed by Steve Berkenfeld was an estimate for the
compensation obligations Barclays was assuming,” Barclays’s
lawyer Jonathan Schiller said in a letter to Peck. Included in
the amount was severance payments, he said.  Berkenfeld, a former Lehman executive, is now with London-
based Barclays.  Kimberly Macleod , a Lehman spokeswoman, didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  Yesterday, Peck ordered Barclays to return $2 billion in
margin assets to the trustee liquidating the remains of Lehman’s
brokerage and pay about $270 million in interest. Barclays said
it would appeal the ruling.  The main case is In re  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) , 08-
13555,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of  New York 
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
