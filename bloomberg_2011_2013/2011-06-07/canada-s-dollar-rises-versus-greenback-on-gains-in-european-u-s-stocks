Canada ’s dollar advanced against its
U.S. counterpart for the first time in three days as investors
sought higher-yielding assets.  The Canadian currency retreated from its high of the day as
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the U.S. central
bank should maintain record monetary stimulus to boost a
“frustratingly slow” economic recovery. The greenback fell
against most major peers as increased risk appetite damped
demand for refuge currencies.  “The U.S. dollar has been sold off in general across the
board, and that has helped dollar-Canada,” said Matt Perrier,
director of currency sales at Bank of Montreal’s BMO Capital
Markets unit in Toronto.  Canada’s currency, nicknamed the loonie for the image of
the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, strengthened 0.7 percent to
97.45 cents per  U.S. dollar  at 5 p.m. in Toronto, from 98.09
cents yesterday. It weakened to 98.52 cents on June 3, the least
since March 21. One Canadian dollar buys $1.0262.  The loonie reached its strongest level of the day, 97.32
cents, before trimming gains as Bernanke told bankers at a
conference in Atlanta that until the U.S. sees “a sustained
period of stronger  job creation , we cannot consider the recovery
to be truly established.”  Canada ships about 75 percent of its exports to the U.S.  The loonie capped its fifth weekly loss on June 3 after
U.S. Labor Department data showed American payrolls grew at the
slowest pace in eight months, increasing by 54,000 jobs in May.
That was less than a third the 165,000-position gain that
economists forecast in a Bloomberg survey.  Bonds Fall  Canadian  government bonds  fell today, pushing the yield on
the benchmark 10-year note up four basis points to 3.03 percent.
A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. The price of the 3.25
percent security maturing in June 2021 dropped 33 cents to
C$101.89. Government debt has returned 2 percent this year after
gaining 6.2 percent in 2010, according to a Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index.  The loonie rose after Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said
yesterday he’ll seek to bring the federal government back into
surplus by 2014 through cuts in government operating costs and
the elimination of tax loopholes. Flaherty, whose  Conservative
Party  won a majority in last month’s election, presented a
fiscal plan similar to one he proposed in March.  “It was a fairly well received budget, and that also may
be helping the Canadian dollar bounce a little bit higher here
today, too,” said John Kurgan, a Toronto-based senior market
strategist at Lind-Waldock & Co., a unit of MF Global Canada.  Canadian Jobs  Employers added a net 20,000 jobs to payrolls in May after
a 58,300 gain in April, and the  unemployment rate  remained at
7.6 percent,  Statistics Canada  will probably say on June 10,
according to the median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  “We’re going to be watching that for some sort of sign in
terms of the strength of the Canadian economy,” Kurgan said.  Canada’s currency strengthened today against 10 of its 16
most-traded counterparts. It rose the most against the South
Korean won, gaining 1 percent.  The loonie fell 0.2 percent versus the euro to C$1.4320
after yesterday reaching the weakest level in 15 months versus
the shared currency, C$1.4371.  “The Canadian dollar was cheap, and poised for a bit of a
bounce,” said  David Watt , senior currency strategist at Royal
Bank of Canada’s RBC Capital Markets unit in Toronto.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced as much as 0.8
percent before erasing the gain as Bernanke spoke. It ended the
day down 0.1 percent. Crude oil, Canada’s biggest export,
fluctuated after reaching a two-week low. Crude for July
delivery fell to as low as $97.74 a barrel in  New York , the
least since May 24, before trading at $99.71, up 0.7 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
