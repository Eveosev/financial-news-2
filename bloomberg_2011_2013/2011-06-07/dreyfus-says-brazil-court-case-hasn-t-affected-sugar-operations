A unit of Louis Dreyfus & Cie SA in
 Brazil  said a preliminary court decision by the country’s Labor
Ministry to suspend its ability to hire outside workers for
“certain agricultural activities” hasn’t affected operations.  A preliminary court decision suspended the rights of LDC
Bioenergia SA, a subsidiary that produces sugar, to hire
outside workers for the sectors of mechanization and transport
of sugar cane in Jaboticabal, in the state of  Sao Paulo ,
according to a statement on the Labor Ministry  website .  “This decision has not affected neither production nor
industrial operations,” Cassia Schittini, a spokeswoman for the
company, said in an e-mail response to questions today. The
company’s Sao Carlos sugar mill in Jaboticabal is operating
“normally,” she said.  LDC Bioenergia started “exercising its right of
defense” after the preliminary decision by the 2nd Labor Court
of the First Instance was made, the company said in a statement
on June 2. Dreyfus has taken the steps necessary to comply
with the decision, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
