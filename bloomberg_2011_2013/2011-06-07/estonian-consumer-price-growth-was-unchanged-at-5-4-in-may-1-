Estonian consumer-price growth was
unchanged in May as food and fuel prices declined.  Consumer prices rose 5.4 percent from a year earlier, the
same as in April, the Tallinn-based statistics office said on
its website today. The result compares with a median forecast of
5.5 percent in a Bloomberg survey of five analysts. In the
month, prices rose 0.1 percent.  Annual inflation, which has exceeded 5 percent for seven
months, will start slowing as global price pressures on food and
fuel are declining, Finance Minister Juergen Ligi said on May
26. Estonia’s adoption of the euro in January boosted consumer
prices by 0.2 to 0.3 percentage points in the first quarter, in
line with the experience in other countries, the European
Union’s statistics office said last month.  Food and non-alcohol beverage prices fell a monthly 0.2
percent, the office said, adding that such prices rose 12.2
percent on year. Transport prices fell 0.5 percent from April to
rise 3.5 percent from a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
