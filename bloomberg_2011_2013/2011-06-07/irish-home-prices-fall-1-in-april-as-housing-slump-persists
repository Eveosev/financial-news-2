Irish  home prices  fell 1 percent in
April from March as a housing slump persisted, the  Central
Statistics Office  in Cork said on its website.  Values declined 12.2 percent from a year earlier and have
dropped 40 percent since peaking in 2007, the office said today.  Irish  house prices  have plunged after quadrupling in the
decade through 2007, pushing the economy into recession. The
share of Irish private home loans in arrears or restructured
rose to 11 percent in the three months though March, the central
bank said last month.  Dublin house prices fell 0.7 percent in April from March
and have dropped almost 46 percent since their peak in 2007, the
statistics office said. In the rest of Ireland, values fell 1.3
percent in April from March and 36 percent since 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
