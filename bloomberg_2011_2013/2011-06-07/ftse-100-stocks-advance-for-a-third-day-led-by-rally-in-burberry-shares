U.K. stocks closed little changed as
gains at  Mitchells & Butlers Plc (MAB)  and  Resolution Ltd. (RSL)  offset
losses in  Whitbread Plc. (WTB)   Mitchells & Butlers jumped 3.8 percent after the Daily Mail
said a group of investors may bid as much as 1.7 billion pounds
($2.8 billion) for the pub company. Resolution advanced 2.8
percent as the insurance buyout firm said it plans to buy back
250 million pounds of shares.  Rio Tinto  Group led basic-resource
shares higher, gaining 1.2 percent. Whitbread fell 1.8 percent
after a downgrade from Barclays Plc.  The benchmark  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  increased 1.49, or less than
0.1 percent, to 5,864.65 at the 4:30 p.m. close in London. The
FTSE All-Share Index also rose less than 0.1 percent, while
Ireland’s ISEQ Index slid 0.4 percent after being closed
yesterday for a public holiday.  The FTSE 100 lost 1.4 percent last week, its biggest
decline in a month, after reports on U.S. employment and factory
orders trailed economists’ forecasts, adding to concern that a
recovery in the world’s largest economy may be faltering.  “The biggest blue-chip gainer in  London  is Resolution,”
said  Anthony Grech , the head of research at IG Index in London.
“Investors are clearly seeing today’s news as a vote of
confidence in the company. The medium-term risk is that any
early strength may well prove too tempting for investors looking
to reduce recent losses.”  Retail Sales  In the U.K., a report today showed that retail sales
unexpectedly fell in May as consumers’ uncertainty about their
jobs and incomes increased, according to the British Retail
Consortium. Sales at stores open at least 12 months, measured by
value, fell 2.1 percent from a year earlier. That compares with
a 5.2 percent increase in April that was spurred by spending
over public holidays for Easter and the royal wedding.  Mitchells & Butlers jumped 3.8 percent to 331.9 pence, its
largest gain in four months. The  Daily Mail  reported that the
pub owner may receive a cash bid from a group including Irish
entrepreneurs J.P. McManus and John Magnier, billionaire
investor Joe Lewis and a private equity firm. The newspaper did
not say where it got the information.  Resolution rallied 2.8 percent to 308.3 pence after the
insurance buyout firm founded by  Clive Cowdery  announced a share
buyback as part of a plan to return 500 million pounds to
investors over the next year. The company will purchase stock on
the open market from tomorrow, while a further 250 million
pounds will be handed to shareholders in the first half of 2012.  Rio, Xstrata  Rio Tinto gained 1.2 percent to 4,199 pence and  Xstrata Plc (XTA) 
rose 1.1 percent to 1,370.5 pence.  Ashtead Group Plc (AHT)  jumped 3.4 percent to 176 pence as UBS AG
recommended investors buy the shares before the construction-
equipment rental company reports earnings on June 16. The
brokerage said that per-share profit may top analyst estimates
by as much as 20 percent.  Findel Plc (FDL)  soared 23 percent to 6.37 pence after the U.K.
home-shopping and education supplies company said its full-year
results were “robust” and current trading matches its
forecast. The company’s annual loss before tax narrowed to 1.4
million pounds from 74.8 million pounds a year earlier.  Whitbread fell 1.8 percent to 1,552 pence after Barclays
lowered its recommendation for the owner of the Premier Inn and
Costa Coffee brands to “equal weight” from “overweight.”  Hochschild Mining Plc (HOC)  declined 2.3 percent to 488.5 pence
after Citigroup Inc. lowered its recommendation for the producer
of silver in  Peru  to “hold” from “buy.” The shares sank 8.5
percent yesterday after Ollanta Humala won the South American
nation’s presidential election.  To contact the reporter on this story:
