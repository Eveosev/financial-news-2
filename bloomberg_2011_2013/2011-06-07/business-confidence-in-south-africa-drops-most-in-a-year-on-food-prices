South African business confidence
fell the most in a year in the second quarter as rising food and
fuel prices curbed  consumer spending , Rand Merchant Bank said.  The RMB/BER index decreased to 48 from a three-year-high of
55 in the first quarter, the investment bank, a unit of
Johannesburg-based  FirstRand Ltd. (FSR) , said in an e-mailed statement
today. A reading above 50 indicates more companies are
optimistic than are pessimistic about prevailing business
conditions, the bank said.  “Lower confidence in the trade sectors can mainly be
attributed to some weakening in households’ ability to spend,”
RMB said. “Rising energy costs and higher food prices are
fueling consumer price inflation. As a result, real growth in
compensation is being squeezed.”  While the recovery in  Africa ’s biggest economy has
strengthened, with growth accelerating to an annualized 4.8
percent in the first quarter, vehicle sales rose the least in 17
months in May, an industry group said on June 2. The purchasing
managers’ index eased for the third consecutive month in May,
Kagiso Securities Ltd. said on June 1. Inflation accelerated to
4.2 percent in April, according to the country’s statistics
office.  The confidence index for retailers slipped to 47 in the
second quarter from 58, while the index for wholesalers dropped
to 47 from 65, RMB said. The motor trade index declined to 76
from 84, it said.  The business confidence index is compiled by RMB and the
University of Stellenbosch’s Bureau for Economic Research.  To contact the reporter on this story:
