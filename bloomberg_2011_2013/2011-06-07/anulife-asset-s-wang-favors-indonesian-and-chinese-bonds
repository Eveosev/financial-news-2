Yu-Ming Wang, head of Asian fixed
income at Manulife Asset Management in  Hong Kong , comments on
the region’s debt markets, particularly Indonesia. Wang, who
oversees $28 billion of assets, was in Jakarta yesterday.  “Indonesia and China are the favorites because of higher
 interest rates  and appreciating currencies. Japanese bonds are
giving the worst returns because of low interest rates and a
depreciating yen.  “The central bank’s policies provide positive support to
the Indonesian capital market by encouraging foreign investors
to participate in long-term bonds and short-term deposits.
Indonesia’s improving credit rating, which may soon reach
investment grade, will encourage foreign investors to allocate
more funds in Indonesian assets.  “ The strengthening of the rupiah will control inflation
at a relatively low level which automatically provides positive
outcomes for the Indonesian  bond market .  To contact the reporter for this story:
