Telkom  South Africa  Ltd. said a
Nigerian court found in favor of Helios Towers Nigeria in a
dispute about the validity of a lease contract for which Helios
claims it’s owed $252 million.  Helios Towers Nigeria, a unit of London-based Helios
Investment Partners LLP, lodged a damages claim against Telkom’s
Multi-Links unit regarding the leasing of mobile-phone towers in
Nigeria. Multi-Links argued that the lease was invalid because
the government hadn’t authorized building on the land where
Helios Towers placed the equipment. A judge in Nigeria’s
commercial capital of Lagos found the contract to be valid.  “Multi-Links is reviewing the implications of the judgment
and all options will be considered,” Telkom said today in a
regulatory statement. It said a hearing hasn’t been scheduled
regarding Helios Towers  Nigeria ’s damages claim.  The court’s finding may delay Multi-Links’s restructuring,
which included the sale of its CDMA technology business to
Visafone Communications Ltd. The sale, announced on April 1, is
subject to settlement of the Helios Towers case.  “Irrespective of the litigation in respect of the Master
Lease Agreement, the parties are still continuing to perform in
terms of the agreement,” Telkom said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
