Financial stocks, the worst-
performing of 10 industry groups in the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index this year, will keep trailing the market if history is any
guide, according to Birinyi Associates Inc.  Banks tend to perform better than other companies in the
early stages of a bull market and lag behind them for the
remainder, according to a study by Westport, Connecticut-based
Birinyi on the previous nine bull markets since 1962. The shares
on average achieved 44 percent of their gains in the first two
months of a bull market. After that, banks trailed in seven out
of the nine occasions.  “If history holds, the underperformance of banks is likely
to continue for the remainder of the current bull market,”
Torie Jenkins and Jeffrey Yale Rubin, analysts with Birinyi,
wrote in a note to clients yesterday.  The  S&P 500 Financials Index (S5FINL)  has slumped 6.6 percent this
year, the most among the gauge’s 10 industries, amid the biggest
net revenue drop for the largest banks in three years and
increased regulatory scrutiny. In the current bull market, which
began with the S&P 500’s 12-year low in March 2009, banks beat
broader indexes over the first seven months. Financials’
relative price ratio to the benchmark peaked at 0.19 on Oct. 14,
2009, and has since declined to 0.16, Bloomberg data show.  Technical analysts study charts of trading patterns and
prices to predict changes in a security, commodity, currency or
index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
