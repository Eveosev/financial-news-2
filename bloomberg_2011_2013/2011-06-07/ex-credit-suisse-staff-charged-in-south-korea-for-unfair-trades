Two former employees of  Credit Suisse
Group AG (CSGN) ’s Hong Kong branch were charged by  South Korea 
prosecutors with making 23.6 billion won ($22 million) in unfair
profits through convertible-bond and stock transactions.  The pair invested in 12 companies between April 2005 and
May 2006 by acquiring 101 billion won of bonds that could
convert into shares while at the same time borrowing stock from
the 12 companies, the  Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office 
said in a statement on its website today.  They collaborated with two former officials of the Seoul-
based Kyobo Securities Co., the arranger of the convertible bond
sales, according to the statement. Prosecutors said in the
statement that the convertible-bond purchases were reported to
regulators while the stock transactions were kept secret. The
Korea Times reported the charges yesterday.  Sheel Kohli, a spokesman at Credit Suisse in  Hong Kong ,
declined to comment. Officials at Kyobo Securities were not
immediately able to comment.  Four of the 12 companies invested in are no longer listed
and most of the remaining companies are financially weak,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
