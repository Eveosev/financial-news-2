Co-operative Bank of Kenya Ltd. (COOP) , the
east African nation’s fourth-biggest lender by assets, retreated
to a 1 1/2-month low on concern the cost of cutting 34 senior
managerial jobs will hurt earnings.  Co-op Bank, as the lender is known, declined 0.3 percent to
17.25 shillings by the  3 p.m. close in Nairobi, the lowest
level since April 20.  “In the short run it will have an adverse effect because
they have to pay a severance package, but in the end it is good
for the bank,” Renaldo D’souza, an analyst at Nairobi-based
Genghis Capital Ltd., said in a phone interview today.  Co-op Bank fired the managers to cut costs and to increase
efficiency by reducing reporting layers,  Business Daily  reported
today. The bank’s wage bill last year rose 17 percent to 4.5
billion shillings ($51 million), after the number of employees
rose by about 20 percent to 2,766, the Nairobi-based newspaper
said, citing a memo to employees from Managing Director Gideon
Muriuki.  A bank official said the company has no comment on the
newspaper report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
