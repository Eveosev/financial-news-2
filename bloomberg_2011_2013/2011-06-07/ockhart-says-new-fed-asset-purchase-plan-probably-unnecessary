President  Dennis Lockhart  said the central bank probably won’t
start a new program to purchase assets and that the pace of
economic growth would make such additional stimulus unnecessary.  “There is a very high bar to another round of asset
purchases and my forecast for the economy really would not need
another round,” Lockhart said today in response to an audience
question after a speech in Charlotte, North Carolina.  To contact the reporter on this story:
