Zambia, Africa’s biggest copper
producer, will invest the $160 million it will earn from its
sale of a stake in  Equinox Minerals Ltd. (EQN)  to  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) 
in other mining projects, Finance Minister  Situmbeko Musokotwane 
said.  The money will also be used to settle state-owned Zambia
Consolidated Copper Mines Investment Holdings Plc’s debt,
Musokotwane said by phone today from Lusaka, the capital. He
didn’t say what mining projects the company planned to invest
in.  ZCCM-IH agreed to sell its 2.28 percent stake in Equinox as
part of unconditional approval for Barrick’s C$7.3 billion ($7.5
billion) takeover of the company and the copper producer’s
Lumwana mine in the southern African country, the Zambian
company said on June 1.  Zambia is Africa’s biggest copper producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
