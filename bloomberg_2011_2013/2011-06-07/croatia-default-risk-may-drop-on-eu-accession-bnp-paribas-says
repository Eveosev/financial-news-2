Croatia  default risks are likely to
decline on possible approval this month of the Balkan country’s
bid to join the European Union, according to BNP Paribas SA.  Investors should sell credit-default swaps insuring
Croatia’s government bonds against non-payment at 254 basis
points on expectations they will decline to 220 basis points,
the French lender wrote in a report to clients dated today. CDS
drop as perceptions of the borrower’s creditworthiness improve.  The former Yugoslav republic is “very close” to
concluding accession talks with the 27-nation bloc and “very
good news” for the Balkan country may arrive on June 10,
European Commission President  Jose Barroso  said today in
Strasbourg, France. Croatia seeks to join the EU as of July
2013.  “This would mean a significant boost for the economy as
the EU funds earmarked for Croatia total almost 8 percent of the
country’s GDP,”  Bartosz Pawlowski , emerging-market strategist
at BNP in London, wrote in the report. The approval would
“remove a significant chunk of the country’s credit risk,” he
wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
