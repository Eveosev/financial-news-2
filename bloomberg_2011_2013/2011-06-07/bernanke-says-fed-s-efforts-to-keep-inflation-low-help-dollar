Federal Reserve  Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the central bank’s efforts to keep inflation low
and stable are helping the dollar.  “The Federal Reserve’s efforts to keep inflation low, and
in particular in many cases lower than our trading partners, is
a positive factor for the dollar,” he said in response to
questions following a speech in Atlanta today.  “There is a very strong case that what the Fed needs to do
to provide good fundamentals for the dollar in the medium term
is to first keep inflation low and stable, and secondly to help
the economy recover and be strong.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
