The Brazilian Treasury may postpone
to next year part of the 55 billion reais ($34.9 billion) it
plans to transfer to the state development bank, known as BNDES,
O Estado de S.Paulo newspaper reported, without saying how it
obtained the information.  The Treasury, which borrows money to increase the bank’s
capital, isn’t willing to raise the full amount this year, the
Sao Paulo-based newspaper said. A spokesman for the  Finance
Ministry  wasn’t immediately available to comment when called by
Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
