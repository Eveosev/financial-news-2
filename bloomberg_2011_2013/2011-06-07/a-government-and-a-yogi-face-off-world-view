Two important Indian entities, one individual and the other corporate, hit a rough patch last week. The first is  Baba Ramdev , a prominent yoga guru with millions of followers. The second is the Indian government, which at its lowest moment in the crisis appeared to have the support of no one but the members of its parliamentary majority.  The two produced a spectacle -- some would say a farce -- that riveted the country, along with a story so rich in rhetoric and incident that it seems almost criminal to sketch it out in just a few paragraphs. The Baba, a voluble, charismatic, long-haired, saffron-robe-clad figure in his 50s, has been a national figure for at least a decade because of his work as a tele-yogist on the spiritual television channel  Aastha . Earlier this year, he achieved a new level of fame by entering the national battle  against corruption  and political malfeasance. By general consensus, this has become the most pressing question in Indian democracy over the last year, following the revelation of  several scams inside the  government  resulting in a loss to the public exchequer of billions of rupees,.  The Baba, whose own vast empire has   annual revenue  of almost $250 million  and whose bases include a  small island  in Scotland bought for him by two of his followers, put his own particular spin on the matter,  saying that  if all " black money " were to be confiscated and returned to the public coffers, "our economy will be so huge, our currency will be so strong that our one rupee will be equal to $50" -- an idea with great romantic appeal in a country that is beginning to think of itself as a world power. The government was already embarrassed in April, when the social activist  Anna Hazare  began a fast unto death -- a concept with a particular resonance in Indian politics because of its use by  Mahatma Gandhi  against the British Raj -- on the issue of the  Jan Lokpal Bill , a proposed law that would create an independent agency in the central government and in each state with authority to investigate corruption . So it had reason to be worried when the Baba demanded some action on the issue of black money and made several other demands (such as the application of the death penalty for those convicted of corruption) in  a letter to the government in May . The missive, while full of slapdash logic and contorted syntax, is worth quoting at length: So, when Ramdev arrived in Delhi on June 2 with plans to begin his own fast unto death two days later, the government decided to act preemptively by engaging with the yogi. In a widely criticized move, it  sent a delegation of four Cabinet officials , including Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee, to the Delhi airport to " 'explain and convince' Ramdev of the steps taken to flush out black money and end corruption and, in the process, persuade him to call off his proposed fast." Ramdev hedged for a while,  apparently agreeing  at another private meeting with the government the next day to call off his protest after a symbolic duration of one day: Saturday, June 4. But when  his fast, attended by about 50,000 supporters at  New Delhi's Ramlila Grounds , showed no signs of coming to an end the next day, the government, in another widely criticized move,  sent in the police  to clear the grounds morning and dispel Ramdev's congregation with tear gas and sticks.  The result, unsurprisingly, was pandemonium, with many of the Baba's supporters complaining of having been beaten. Ramdev's response was not without an element of farce. Having disappeared among his followers, he briefly went missing, and was detained by the police close to dawn as he was trying to make his escape  dressed as a woman , with a cloth wrapped around his beard. He was flown to Dehradun, and the next day  reappeared at the site of his yoga trust in Haridwar , where he gave  his own version of events , said he would bring claims of police brutality to the courts, and vowed to carry on his crusade. Ferocious mudslinging from every interested party ensued. The Congress Party accused Ramdev of being a fraud, and alleged that his crusade was being " remote-controlled " by the main opposition party, the BJP, and its parent body, the RSS. The BJP was guilty of rhetorical excesses of its own in  comparing the crackdown  to the  Emergency of 1975 . Of all the responses, some of which can be read  here , perhaps the most cogent reaction came from the Communist Party of  India  (Marxist), which said,  "Clearly the backstage deal between the government and Ramdev fell apart, but this brings little credit to either party and indeed raises question about the credibility of both." The responses in the Indian media to this ugly episode were predictably sharp. Writing in the Hindu,  Siddharth Varadarajan  observed that "sending four senior ministers to the airport to welcome the yoga instructor-turned-upstart politician and then hundreds of policemen to extern him were both acts of gutlessness which the Congress party will find hard to live down." The Baba also came in for criticism: The editor of Open magazine,  Manu Joseph, mocked Ramdev's pretensions  and also those of the wider middle-class anti-corruption movement at large, saying: In a piece entitled " Political Leaders Go AWOL " in the Indian Express, the columnist  Tavleen Singh  was harsh on the government and drew attention to its lack of connection with the governed: Meanwhile, the civil-society representatives on the committee for the Jan Lokpal Bill  boycotted a scheduled meeting  with the government to protest the raid on Ramdev. The Hindustan Times  reported that  the government had begun an investigation into Ramdev's assets: Some good sense may eventually emerge from this churning, but you shouldn't hold your breath. Or maybe you should:   Ramdev says it's good for you. (Chandrahas Choudhury is the  New Delhi  correspondent for the World View blog. The opinions expressed are his own.)
