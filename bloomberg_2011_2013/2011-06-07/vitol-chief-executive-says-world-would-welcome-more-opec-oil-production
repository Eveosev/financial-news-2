The global crude market would
“welcome” increased oil production from OPEC, Vitol Group
Chief Executive Officer Ian Taylor said after attending the Asia
Oil and Gas Conference in  Kuala Lumpur  today.  “We’ve lost  Libya , that’s sweet oil that theoretically
would be good to replace,” Taylor told reporters. “The markets
are in small backwardation, which would suggest there’s just
about enough oil. Stock levels aren’t bad, I could not say the
market is incredibly tight.”  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will meet
in Vienna June 8 to decide production quotas. Fighting in Libya
has cut supplies from  Africa ’s third-largest producer by almost
90 percent, according to Bloomberg estimates. The nation
produces the light, sweet crude favored by refiners.  While demand for oil will continue to increase in the
second half of the year, it will be at a slower pace than in
2010, Taylor said. The current oil price is “accepted” by the
market, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
