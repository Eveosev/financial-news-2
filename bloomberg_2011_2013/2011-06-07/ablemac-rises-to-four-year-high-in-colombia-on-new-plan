Tableros & Maderas de Caldas SA, a
Colombian wood-products maker, rose to a record in Bogota as
investors bet the planned opening of a medium-density fiberboard
plant will boost sales.  The stock advanced 0.8 percent to 13 pesos at 4 p.m. New
York time, the highest closing price since 1998.  The fourth-quarter plant opening “will have a very
positive impact on 2012 first-quarter results,” Nicolas Velasquez, an analyst at Celfin Capital, said in a phone
interview from Medellin.  Celfin initiated coverage on May 24 with a “buy”
recommendation and year-end target price of 16.6 pesos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
