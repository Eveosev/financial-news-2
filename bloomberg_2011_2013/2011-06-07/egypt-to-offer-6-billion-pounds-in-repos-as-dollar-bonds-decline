Egypt ’s central bank will offer 6
billion Egyptian pounds ($1 billion) in seven-day repurchase
contracts, or repos, at an auction today, compared with 8
billion pounds last week, according to data it published on
Bloomberg.  The contracts allow banks to sell  government securities 
back to the central bank to access funds at an interest rate of
9.25 percent. It accepted all bids, totalling 7.58 billion
pounds, for repo agreements last week.  Egypt’s 5.75 percent dollar bond due April 2020 fell,
pushing the yield three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point,
higher to 5.61 percent at 10:15 a.m. in Cairo. The pound was
little changed at 5.941 against the dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
