Two more senators from  Brazil ’s
ruling coalition today backed a congressional investigation into
the rise in wealth of Cabinet chief  Antonio Palocci ,  Folha de
Sao Paulo  reported, without saying where it obtained the
information.  With the support of Senators Cristovam Buarque and Pedro
Taques, both members of the Democratic Workers Party, opposition
parties now have 22 of the 27 signatures they need to start the
probe in the 81-seat upper house, the Sao Paulo-based newspaper
said on its website. So far, five senators from parties that
support President Dilma Rousseff’s government back the proposal,
Folha said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
