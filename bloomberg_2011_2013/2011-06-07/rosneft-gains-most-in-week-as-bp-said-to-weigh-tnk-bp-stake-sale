OAO Rosneft jumped to its highest
level in more than a month after BP Plc was said to have
considered selling a stake in its Russian joint venture to the
country’s largest oil producer.  The shares climbed 2.5 percent to 243.54 rubles by the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow, their strongest since April 29.  BP is considering selling its stake in TNK-BP to Rosneft
after its billionaire partners blocked a $7.8 billion share swap
and Arctic exploration deal with the state-run company, said two
people with knowledge of the matter.  “A blocking stake in TNK-BP would be quite useful as a
bargaining tool in the future for Rosneft,” Julian Rimmer, a
trader of Russian shares at CF Global Trading in  London , said in
e-mailed comments. “One would assume that BP would be selling
at reasonable rather than expensive valuations.”  TNK-BP’s shares rose for a second day, adding 0.9 percent
to 86.26 rubles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
