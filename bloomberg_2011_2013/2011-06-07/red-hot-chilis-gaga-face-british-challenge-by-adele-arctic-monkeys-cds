It’s time to get past the silly name
and quirky accent: The Arctic Monkeys are leading a new Britpop
invasion.  The title of their fourth album, “Suck It and See,” is
less outrageous than it sounds. It’s a northern English
expression meaning try something new, like boiled candy.  Some listeners found the guitar-heavy riffs on the
quartet’s last CD, “Humbug” (2009), indigestible. They may be
pleasantly surprised this time, with songwriter Alex Turner back
on top. He’s in a playful mood, with titles such as “Don’t Sit
Down ‘Cause I’ve Moved Your Chair” and lines like “If you’re
gonna try and walk on water, make sure you wear your comfortable
shoes.” Rating: ****.  The  Monkeys’  indie rock isn’t as chart friendly as the Fab
Four, though it has been getting attention in the U.S. The CD’s
release this week has stolen thunder from the Red Hot Chili Peppers’ announcement of a comeback record in August.  Britons have been scaling the U.S. charts. Adele’s
excellent “21” is one of the year’s bestsellers, though Lady Gaga is hot in pursuit. Mumford & Sons played Coachella and more
U.K. groups are heading over for summer festivals.  The  Wild Beasts  are Domino label mates with the Monkeys.
Their album “Smother” is a worthwhile acquired taste, with
Hayden Thorpe’s countertenor voice floating over hypnotic
electronica on songs like “Lion’s Share.” Rating: ****.  The self-titled debut by  James Blake  is another of the
year’s more rewarding releases. His dubstep genre features bass
samples and processed vocals that sound like croaky robots. On
“Lindisfarne I,” Blake uses technology to conjure up the
atmosphere of an ancient monastery. Rating: ****.  Friendly Fires  is a trio from  St. Albans ,  England ,
currently at the end of a North American tour. “Pala,” the
band’s latest release, evokes a punk party that likely will stir
mass gyrations at outdoor concerts. Rating: ***.  For an off-the-wall British choice, there’s Duran Duran.
That wasn’t a misprint --  Duran Duran , whose career started in
1978. Ignore the years of ridicule and imagine that the group’s
latest album, “All You Need Is Now,” produced by Mark Ronson,
was recorded straight after the 1982 “Rio.” It’s not at all
bad. Rating: ***.  A very different act, also hailing from Birmingham, is
 Clare Maguire . Her contralto is part Susan Boyle, part  Amy Winehouse  and works well on the single “Ain’t Nobody.”
Download that number, and pass on the rest of “Light After
Dark” -- the gothic drama gets wearying. Rating: **.  The Arctic Monkeys and Wild Beasts are on Domino, Blake on
Universal/A&M and Friendly Fires on XL, priced from about $8 or
9 pounds. Clare Maguire is on Polydor, available on import into
the U.S. The Duran Duran CD is on S-Curve/Tape Modern, with a
deluxe edition for about $5 more. Download fees vary across
services.  Information:  http://www.arcticmonkeys.com/
