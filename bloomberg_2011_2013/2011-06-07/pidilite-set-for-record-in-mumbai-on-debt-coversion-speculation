Pidilite Industries Ltd. (PIDI)  headed for a
record close on speculation that more bondholders of  India ’s
biggest adhesives producer will offer to convert the debt into
shares, reducing the company’s cash outgo to meet redemptions.  The stock rose 1.2 percent to 165.7 rupees at 2:29 p.m. in
Mumbai, bound for the record close since its debut in January
1994. More than 980,000 shares, six times the three-month daily
average, changed hands, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “The stock is reacting to the buzz that the company may
receives more offers from bondholders to convert their debt to
equity,” said Nilesh Karani, assistant vice president of
research at Magnum Equity Broking Ltd. in  Mumbai . “Pidilite
will save on cash if that happens.”  Pidilite issued 116,462 shares to a bondholder who opted to
convert three bonds, each worth $100,000, into shares, the
company said in an exchange filing yesterday. The company has
369 foreign convertible bonds worth $36.9 million outstanding,
it said. The company must pay $139.37 for every $100 borrowed if
the debt sold in December 2007 is not converted to shares,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Company Secretary Savithri Parekh declined to provide
further details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
