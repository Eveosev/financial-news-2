The Group of 20 leading nations will
seek to control price volatility in agricultural commodities by
gathering more market information on stocks and production, the
Financial Times reported, citing an interview with French
Agriculture Minister Bruno Le Maire, who is leading the project.  The Agriculture Market Information System will be discussed
by agriculture ministers in Paris on June 22 and 23, and the
 Food and Agriculture Organization  of the  United Nations  will be
asked to create a secretariat for the project, the FT said,
citing unidentified officials.  To contact the reporter on this story:
