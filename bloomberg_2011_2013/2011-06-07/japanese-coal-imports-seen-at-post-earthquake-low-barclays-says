Amrita Sen, a commodities analyst
with  Barclays Capital  in London, comments on the outlook for
Japanese coal imports, which fell 19 percent to 12.9 million
metric tons in April compared with the month-earlier period,
according to data from the Japanese  Finance Ministry .  On March 11, the country, the biggest importer of coal for
power, was hit by an earthquake and tsunami that crippled Tokyo
Electric Power Co.’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant. Other
atomic reactors were shut down. Ports for handling coal were
also damaged. Sen spoke in an interview today and refers to coal
in terms of metric tons.  “The trough is now. I would not expect to see a further
fall in imports. The question is when they will pick up. It’s
conditional on when the ports come back on line.”  “Infrastructure is being rebuilt. I would expect by the
end of the third quarter, for sure, for imports to pick up
again. It might be earlier.”  “The loss in Japanese ports was about 13.5 million tons”
of coal-moving capacity.  “That’s the swing. And then, you say two of them were very
badly damaged and two were damaged. So, maybe six to seven
million tons come back on line by the third quarter.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
