Coffee exports from  Brazil , the
world’s largest producer, climbed 3.7 percent last month,
according to the country’s coffee exporters council, known as
CeCafe.  Shipments, which include robusta, arabica and instant
coffee, advanced to 2.62 million bags last month, the group said
today in an e-mailed statement. That’s up from 2.53 million a
year earlier.  Exports of the arabica variety fell 2.5 percent to 2.05
million bags, while robusta shipments more than doubled to
344,758 bags, the council said.  Europe  was the biggest importer
of Brazilian coffee in the first five months of the year,
accounting for 55 percent of total sales, CeCafe said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
