Slovenia’s credit rating, on a par
with  Spain  and higher than Italy and  Portugal , remained
unchanged at AA with a negative outlook after the government’s
defeat over pension changes,  Standard & Poor’s  said.  The rejection of the government’s plan to extend the
 retirement age  indicates failing support for the government and
may frustrate its aims to constrain budget spending, Marko Mrsnik, a S&P analyst in Madrid, said in yesterday’s statement.  “The defeat is likely to lead to a stalemate in using
changes to the pension system to address the budgetary
challenges arising from Slovenia’s aging population,” Mrsnik
said. The system probably won’t be tackled before 2013, he said,
and there may be a no-confidence vote or early elections.  Slovenians rejected the proposal with a 72 percent majority
in a referendum on June 5, ignoring calls from European Union
leaders to adopt pension changes that are burdening public
spending, which ballooned during the global recession.  Prime Minister Borut Pahor, who’s facing growing calls for
early elections, said Slovenia will propose a budget review or a
special legislation to make up for the shortfall. Officials
including Labor Minister Ivan Svetlik have estimated the direct
cost of the pension-change rejection at more than 300 million
euros ($439 million).  The Adriatic nation is rated AA at S&P, the third-highest
investment grade and an equivalent at  Fitch Ratings . Elections
are now scheduled for autumn 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
