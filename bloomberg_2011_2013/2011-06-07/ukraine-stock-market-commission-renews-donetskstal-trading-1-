Ukraine’s Securities and Stock Market
State Commission said it renewed bond trading of metal producer
PrAT  Donetskstal , while maintaining a trading suspension on the
shares.  The Kiev-based commission made the decision today as “it
doesn’t influence corporate conflict,” according to an e-mailed
statement.  The commission suspended trading of Donetskstal and its
units, including Yasynivka Coke and Pokrovske Mine, on May 20
for up to a year to “protect the rights of shareholders and to
prevent corporate conflict widening.”.  Donetskstal said May 30 it will appeal the decision.  To contact the reporter on this story:
