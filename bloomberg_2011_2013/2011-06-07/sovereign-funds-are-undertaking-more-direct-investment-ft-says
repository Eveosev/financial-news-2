Sovereign wealth funds have responded
to the financial crisis by making more direct investments,
rather than channelling funds through third-party asset
managers, the Financial Times reported, citing a study to be
published today by Monitor, a U.K. consulting company.  Investments now tend to be smaller than before 2008, when
they were rarely less than $100 million, according to Victoria Barbary, an analyst at Monitor, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
