The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 11:35 a.m. New York time.  The IGBC Index fell 0.3 percent to 14,394.44, while the
Colcap Index declined 0.4 percent to 1,747.19.  Empresa de Telecomunicaciones de Bogota SA (ETB CB), the
state-run phone company serving Colombia’s capital, rose 1.4
percent to 729 pesos on expectations that Bogota’s mayor’s
office will submit a proposal this week that would allow the
city to sell part or all of its 86.6 percent stake in the
company, said Santiago Melo, an analyst at brokerage Alianza
Valores SA.  Telefonica SA (TEF)  , Spain’s biggest phone operator,
hasn’t ruled out the possibility of buying a stake in ETB,
Alfonso Gomez, head of Telefonica in Colombia, told Caracol
radio on June 3, according to the station’s website.  Colombian companies with operations in Peru fell after
Peru’s stock market plunged 12 percent yesterday, the most on
record, as  Ollanta Humala , a one-time ally of Venezuelan
President  Hugo Chavez , edged out Congresswoman Keiko Fujimori in
a June 5 runoff vote.  The Peru election will likely “hit a handful of Colombian
companies,” said Melo. “This could go on a bit longer if
Humala doesn’t make a pro-market statement.”  Bancolombia SA (BCOLO)  , Colombia’s biggest bank and
owner of Leasing Peru, fell 0.8 percent to 29,040 pesos, the
lowest in a week.  Interconexion Electrica SA (ISA)  , a Colombian energy
company that won rights last year to build a transmission line
in Peru with  Empresa de Energia de Bogota SA (EEB)  , fell 1.6
percent to 12,660 pesos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
