Ethanol futures rebounded from a two-
week low in  Chicago  as gasoline climbed and corn gained amid
concern over a smaller crop.  The grain-based biofuel rose 0.8 percent on speculation
that farmers will forgo planting and take crop-insurance
payments rather than risk a lower yield, signaling higher costs
to produce ethanol. Gasoline, with which the additive is mixed,
increased on Middle East tensions and a weaker dollar.  “It was outside markets,” said Michael Breitenbach, an
analyst and trader at Blue Ocean Brokerage LLC in New York.
“The planting issue continues to be a factor with corn. Ethanol
is the nexus between the ‘ags’ and the energies. You’re seeing
some uncertainty in both markets.”  Denatured ethanol for July delivery rose 2.2 cents to
settle at $2.622 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
steepest one-day gain since May 25.  In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago added 0.5 cent
to $2.605 a gallon and in  New York  the gasoline additive slipped
1 cent, or 0.4 percent, to $2.69, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Ethanol was unchanged in the U.S. Gulf at $2.755 a gallon
and on the West Coast at $2.77.  Corn futures for July delivery gained 4.5 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $7.365 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at
least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  Gasoline for July delivery advanced 4.2 cents to settle at
$2.9919 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices
touched $2.9947. The contract covers reformulated gasoline,
which is made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to
filling stations.  Average ethanol mills in  Iowa  are losing 9 cents on every
gallon produced, while plants in  Illinois  are losing 5 cents on
a spot basis, according to Ag Trader Talk, an online grains
information service in Clive, Iowa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
