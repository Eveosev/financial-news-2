U.S. regulators extended the comment
period for Dodd-Frank Act risk-retention rules that could make
it more difficult or expensive for borrowers to get mortgages.  The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the  Federal
Reserve , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., Securities and
Exchange Commission, the  Federal Housing Finance Agency  and the
Department of Housing and Urban Development announced the
extension in a statement today. The comment period, which was to
end June 10, was extended to Aug. 1.  Dodd-Frank, the regulatory overhaul enacted last year,
requires lenders and bond issuers to keep a 5 percent stake in
loans they bundle for sale to investors. Forcing the industry to
share potential losses was meant to rein in risky lending and
avoid mistakes that led to a flood of subprime mortgages, which
helped trigger the 2008 financial collapse.  The law requires regulators to exempt home loans that are
deemed safe, including those with fixed  interest rates  and long
repayment terms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
