The U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., receiver for Downey Savings & Loan Association, sued
Amerifund Financial Inc. and affiliated individuals in federal
court seeking more than $1 million in damages.  The FDIC alleges breach of contract, professional
negligence and civil fraud in the complaint against Amerifund, a
mortgage broker, filed June 3 in U.S. District Court in  Santa
Ana , California.  Amerifund, based in Spring Valley, California, and its
agents, processing mortgages for Downey in 2004 and 2005,
“caused borrowers’ financial statements to be altered or
misstated” in loan applications, the FDIC said. Had true income
and debts been disclosed, borrowers wouldn’t have qualified for
Downey loans, according to the complaint.  Downey Financial Corp., the S&L’s parent, sought Chapter 7
liquidation in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in Wilmington,  Delaware , in
2008, citing as much as $50 million in assets and $500 million
in debts. U.S. Bancorp subsequently acquired Downey.  Amerifund’s phone number was not in service today and
company owner Eric M. Anderson couldn’t immediately be located
for comment.  The case is Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. v. Amerifund
Financial Inc., 11CV840, U.S. District Court, Central District
of  California  (Santa Ana).  To contact the reporter on this story:
