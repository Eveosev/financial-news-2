Warren Buffett ’s Burlington Northern
Santa Fe Railroad Co. and Union Pacific Railroad Co. were sued
by Oxbow Carbon & Minerals LLC over claims they conspired to
drive up costs for shipping coal and other products.  Oxbow, which mines and markets coal and natural gas, said
the railroads have since at least 2003 conspired and colluded
with other rail companies to fend off competition for freight
services, increasing transportation costs that are ultimately
passed on to businesses and consumers, according to the price-
fixing complaint filed today in federal court in  Washington .  Closely held Oxbow, founded by William Koch, son of the
founder of Koch Industries Inc., seeks a judgment that the
railroads are violating federal antitrust laws and should pay
unspecified triple damages for freight overcharges, according to
the complaint. Oxbow is based in  West Palm Beach ,  Florida .  “BNSF has not colluded or conspired in violation of any
law,” Steve Forsberg, a spokesman for Fort Worth, Texas-based
Burlington Northern, said in an e-mail. “We will respond
through the legal process after we have had an opportunity to
fully review the complaint.”  Buffett’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , based in Omaha,
Nebraska, bought Burlington Northern last year.  Tom Lange, a spokesman for Omaha-based Union Pacific, said
the company hasn’t seen the complaint yet and declined to
comment.  The case is Oxbow v. Union Pacific, 11-01049, U.S. District
Court, District of Columbia (Washington)  To contact the reporter on this story:
