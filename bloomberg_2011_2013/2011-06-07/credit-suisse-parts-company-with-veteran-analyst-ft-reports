Tony Shiret, 55, a retail analyst who
worked for  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  for 18 years, has been made
redundant, the Financial Times reported, without saying where it
got the information.  Shiret, who was a noted critic of Marks & Spencer Group Plc
under the leadership of  Stuart Rose , couldnâ€™t be reached for
comment yesterday and Credit Suisse declined to comment, the
