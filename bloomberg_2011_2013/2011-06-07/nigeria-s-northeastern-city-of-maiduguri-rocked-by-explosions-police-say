At least five people were killed when
three blasts went off today in the northeastern Nigerian city of
Maiduguri, including one at the state government secretariat, a
police spokesman said.  “Five people have been confirmed dead and 14 are seriously
wounded,” a Borno state police spokesman, Lawal Abdullahi, said
by phone from the city.  In a separate incident, a gunman in the city suspected to
be an Islamic militant shot dead Ibrahim Mohammed, a Muslim
cleric, late yesterday at his home, Abdullahi said.  Authorities in  Nigeria ’s north have blamed a radical
Islamic sect, Boko Haram, which draws inspiration from
Afghanistan’s Taliban movement, for a spate of bomb attacks and
killings targeting government officials and the security forces.  Nigeria,  Africa ’s top oil producer and most populous
country, is roughly split between a mainly Muslim north and a
predominantly Christian south. More than 14,000 people died in
ethnic and religious clashes in the West African nation between
1999 and 2009, according to the Brussels-based  International
Crisis Group .  To contact the reporter on this story:
