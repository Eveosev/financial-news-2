Boeing Co. (BA)  said it is studying
modifications to its 777 wide-body aircraft to defend the jet’s
position against the Airbus A350 that is slated to enter
services in the next two years.  The U.S. planemaker is watching the schedule of the Airbus
A350’s entry into production and the jet’s ramp-up before
deciding on improvements or an all-out new variant of the 777,
 Jim Albaugh , the commercial airplanes chief, said today at a
briefing with reporters in  Singapore .  “We’re spending a lot of time looking at the 777 and what
upgrades we could do to an existing plane, and what derivatives
we could do,” the executive said. “We’ll respond in kind.”  To contact the reporters on this story: Andrea Rothman in Paris
