Colombia  will back Mexico central
bank Governor Agustin Carstens to lead the International
Monetary Fund, Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry told
reporters in Bogota.  Colombia joins Uruguay as the second country to endorse
Carstens to succeed  Dominique Strauss-Kahn  as managing director.
Brazil has said it will support French Finance Minister
 Christine Lagarde .  “In conversations with the Mexican government we have
manifested our support for Carstens,” Echeverry said.  Carstens, 52, has said he expects emerging markets to
support his candidacy once there is a final list of nominees to
serve as the IMF’s next managing director. Any of the  IMF ’s 187
member nations has until June 10 to nominate candidates for the
position, the fund said in a May 20 statement.  Canadian Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said today his
government hasn’t decided yet who to back. Flaherty, speaking to
reporters in Montreal, said he knows both leading candidates
well and that there could be other candidates who come forward.  Carstens, in Canada today, will visit Washington on June
13.  Editors: Bill Faries, Harry Maurer  To contact the reporter on this story:
