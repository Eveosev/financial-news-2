Zimbabwean farmers have planted less
than 5,000 hectares (12,355 acres) of winter wheat this year,
below 10 percent of the targeted 60,000 hectares, the state-
controlled  Herald  said.  Farmers haven’t been able to afford fertilizer and seed
even with government subsidies, the Harare-based Herald said on
its website, citing Berean Mukwende, vice president of the
 Zimbabwe  Farmers’ Union, which represents mainly small and
medium-scale farmers. Cuts in electricity supply have added to
the decline in wheat production because the crop, grown in
Zimbabwe’s dry winter, needs irrigation.  Zimbabwe consumes about 450,000 metric tons of wheat
annually. The country has never produced sufficient wheat to
meet its needs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
