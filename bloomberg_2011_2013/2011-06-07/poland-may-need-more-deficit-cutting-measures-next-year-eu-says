Poland  may need to take additional
steps to narrow next year’s budget deficit because economic
growth may be weaker than the government foresees, the European
Commission said.  “The macroeconomic scenario underpinning the budgetary
projections is plausible, while based on slightly too favorable
growth assumptions for 2012,” the European Union’s executive
arm said in a report published today. “Risks to budgetary
targets are tilted to the downside.”  Finance Minister Jacek Rostowski said last month that
Poland was on target to meet its goal of narrowing the general
government deficit to 2.9 percent of gross domestic product,
below the EU limit of 3 percent, next year. The  International
Monetary Fund  estimates the gap at 5.6 percent of GDP this year
and 3.6 percent in 2012.  The government expects the economy to grow 4 percent this
year and next after expanding 3.8 percent in 2010.  The programs “set out an ambitious public finance
consolidation plan,” the commission said. Poland should “take
additional measures, if necessary, to reduce the general
government deficit to below 3 percent of GDP by 2012.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
