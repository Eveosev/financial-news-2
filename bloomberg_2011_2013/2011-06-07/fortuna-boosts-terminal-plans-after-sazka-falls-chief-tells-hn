Fortuna Entertainment Group NV (FORTUNA)  plans
to operate as many as 3,000 lottery terminals by the end of the
year as its main rival and the market leader Sazka AS is in
bankruptcy, Chief Executive Officer Jiri Bunda told  Hospodarske
Noviny  in an interview.  The company which started offering lottery tickets last
month, sold 150,000 pieces in first two weeks and earned 800,000
koruna ($48,318) of profit after paying winnings, Bunda told the
newspaper.  Fortuna, which is controlled by Penta Investments offered
to pay as much as 2.5 billion koruna for Sazka assets after a
court sent state-owned lottery operator Sazka into bankruptcy on
May 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
