Sasol Ltd. (SOL)  expects its olefin and
surfactant unit, originally purchased from  RWE AG (RWE) , to have an
operating profit margin of 7 percent to 11 percent,  Financial
Times Deutschland  said, citing an interview with Sasol executive
Andre de Ruyter.  Sasol, which has said it will examine options for the
olefin and surfactant unit after restructuring it, doesn’t plan
to sell the business, Ruyter said, according to the newspaper.  Sasol had tried to sell the unit, which has annual sales of
about 2.5 billion euros ($3.65 billion) in 2005 after a few
years of “below-average performance,” the manager told FTD.  To contact the reporter on this story:
