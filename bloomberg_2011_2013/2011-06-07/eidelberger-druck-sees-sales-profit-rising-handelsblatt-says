Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG (HDD)  is
working “step by step” toward annual sales of 3 billion euros
($4.4 billion),  Handelsblatt  reported, citing an interview with
Chairman Bernhard Schreier.  The company is unlikely to reach that target this fiscal
year, although it’s taking “a good step in that direction,”
the newspaper quoted Schreier as saying in an e-mailed preview
of an article to be published tomorrow. Revenue at that level
would boost earnings before interest and taxes to more than 150
million euros, the newspaper cited Schreier as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
