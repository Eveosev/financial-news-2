Boeing Co. (BA) ’s commercial aircraft
chief,  Jim Albaugh , said today he’s not certain that so-called
unducted-engine technology will ever be viable.  “I have a hard time believing that’s ever going to be
viable, though I’m not going to dismiss it,” Albaugh said at a
press briefing in  Singapore .  General Electric Co. (GE) ,  United Technologies Corp. (UTX) ’s Pratt &
Whitney and Rolls-Royce Holding Plc are all separately studying
an unducted fan, which has blades on the outside of a jet
turbine. The design may take a dozen years to develop, they say.  Albaugh reiterated that Chicago-based Boeing is looking at
offering either a re-engined version of its 737 narrowbody plane
or an all-new model, and that a potential successor would be
available in 2019 or 2020.  To contact the reporter on this story:
