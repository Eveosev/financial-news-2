CMC Holdings Ltd. (CMCH) , a Kenyan car
dealer, rose after the company said it plans to spend as much as
1 billion shillings ($11.5 million) to expand its operations.  CMC climbed as much as 1.2 percent to 13.10 shillings
before trading 5 cents, or 0.4 percent, higher at 13 shillings
by 11:20 a.m. in Nairobi. A close at this level would be the
highest since Nov. 26.  The company plans to hire more people to sell its vehicles
in  Kenya  and neighboring countries,  Business Daily  reported,
citing Managing Director Bill Lay. The money, which will be
sourced from its own balance sheet, will also be used to hire
staff to offer repair and maintenance services, the Nairobi-
based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
