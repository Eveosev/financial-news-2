OAO Gazprom jumped the most since
February after  China , the world’s biggest energy consumer, said
it may sign a deal to import Russian natural gas ahead of
President Hu Jintao’s visit later this month.  The shares climbed 4.5 percent to 204.65 rubles by the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow, their biggest gain since Feb. 24.  “Before Hu’s state visit, there will be a major agreement
on natural gas,” China’s Assistant Foreign Minister Cheng
Guoping told reporters in Beijing today. Hu’s visit will take
place June 15-18, he said.  Gazprom was climbing “as expectations rise” for the
announcement of a deal, Julian Rimmer, a trader of Russian
shares at CF Global Trading, said today in e-mailed comments.  “The Russians have been playing hardball in negotiations
and refusing to accept a lower price than that commanded for
their gas in  Europe ,” he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
