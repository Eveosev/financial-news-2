The  Philadelphia 76ers  are exploring
a sale, according to the president of the holding company that
owns and operates the National Basketball Association team.  “I can confirm that we are in discussions about the future
of the team, but these discussions are confidential and we
cannot talk about the details,” Comcast-Spectacor President
Peter Luukko said in a statement.  Luukko’s announcement followed an ESPN report that Joshua Harris, a director at Apollo Global Management LLC, a private-
equity firm that went public in March, is in talks to buy the
team. The Walt Disney Co. unit cited people that it didn’t
identify.  Luukko’s statement didn’t address a specific buyer.  Harris would buy the team from Ed Snider, who controls it
through Comcast-Spectacor, which also owns hockey’s Philadelphia
Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center, where both clubs play,
according to ESPN.  The company would continue to own and operate the arena,
with the 76ers as a tenant, ESPN said.  Harris didn’t immediately return a telephone message and an
e-mail seeking comment.  The Harris-led group also includes  David Blitzer , who in
2002 moved to London from  New York  to create the European office
of the  Blackstone Group LP (BX) , the biggest private-equity firm,
ESPN said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
