Demand for vegetable oils and fats in
the European Union will drop for the first time in 22 years as
usage for biodiesel slides, researcher Oil World said.  EU demand for 17 oils and fats in the marketing season
started in October will drop 400,000 metric tons to 30.4 million
tons, the researcher estimated today in a report. Rapeseed oil
and  palm oil  consumption will experience “by far” the biggest
reductions, it said.  “This is mainly caused by reduced consumption of oils and
fats for biofuels, primarily in the January to March 2011
quarter, when vegetable oil prices were unusually high and
commanded record premiums relative to fossil fuels,” Oil World
said in the report.  Rapeseed oil usage is estimated to fall to 9.74 million
tons in the current season, down from 9.96 million tons the
previous season. Demand for palm oil is forecast to slide to 5.1
million tons, down from 5.78 million tons the previous season,
according to Oil World.  Biodiesel output will remain stagnant in  Europe  at 9.3
million tons in 2011. Production of the fuel may decline in the
January to September period, the researcher said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
