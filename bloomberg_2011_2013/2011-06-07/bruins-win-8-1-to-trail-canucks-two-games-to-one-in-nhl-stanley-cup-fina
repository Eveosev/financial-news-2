The  Boston Bruins  beat the Vancouver
Canucks 8-1 in Game 3 of the National Hockey League’s Stanley
Cup Final.  The Canucks lead the best-of-seven series by two games to
one after tonight’s matchup at TD Garden in  Boston , which will
host Game 4 on June 8.  The Canucks lost on their previous trips to the series in
1982 and 1994. The Bruins have been beaten five times in the
Stanley Cup Final, most recently in 1990, since they collected
the last of their five NHL titles in 1972.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
