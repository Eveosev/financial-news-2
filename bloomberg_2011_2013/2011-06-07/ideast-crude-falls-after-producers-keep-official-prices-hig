Middle East crude oil grades fell
against their benchmarks on speculation that producers kept
prices too high for refiners to justify purchases.  Murban for August loading slipped 1 cent to a premium of 10
cents a barrel to its official selling price, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Qatar Marine for the same period also
declined 1 cent to a premium of 1 cent a barrel over the
official level, Bloomberg data showed.  Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. has set its May official prices
and the Murban grade was lowered 5.8 percent to $113.60 a
barrel, the company said in notices sent yesterday to buyers.
That means the grade is at a premium of $5.22 to Dubai for the
same period, the most since July 2008, according to Bloomberg
calculations.  Oman crude for immediate loading dropped 85 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $108.05 barrel, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Dubai oil for loading in August fell 85 cents to
$107.59. Murban decreased 0.8 percent to $112.38.  The Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps for July was unchanged
at $6.55 a barrel, PVM said. The exchange for swaps for August
dropped 1 cent to $6.30 a barrel.  Oman futures for August delivery fell 14 cents to $108.43 a
barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange  at 6:49 p.m. Singapore
time, with 804 contracts traded. The settlement price was at
$108.78 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  To contact the reporter on this story:
