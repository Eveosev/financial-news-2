France ’s drought, the worst in half a
century, has triggered a 10 percent rise in the slaughter of
livestock due to a lack of animal feed,  Les Echos  reported,
citing government officials.  Earlier-than-normal slaughtering of French milk cows began
about 10 months ago and accelerated at the start of the year,
according to the government’s national crops office
FranceAgriMer, quoted by the newspaper.  Higher meat production would come at a time when beef
consumption has dropped 4.1 since the start of the year and veal
is down 6 percent,  Les Echos  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
