U.S. gasoline demand at the pump slid
2.9 percent last week as Americans returned to work after the
Memorial Day holiday weekend, according to a  MasterCard Inc. (MA) 
SpendingPulse report.  Motorists bought an average 9.19 million barrels a day in
the week ended June 3, down from 9.46 million the previous week,
the second-biggest payments network company said.  Averaged over four weeks, gasoline use was 1.3 percent
below the same period in 2010. It was the 11th consecutive
decline in the average.  During the four-day holiday driving period that began on
May 27, drivers pumped 35.3 million barrels, 2.1 percent below a
year earlier. Demand was down 3.5 percent on May 27, and down
1.2 percent for the other three days.  “This suggests people didn’t fill up Friday and took
shorter trips,” John Gamel, director of economic analysis for
SpendingPulse, said in an interview. “Prices have declined
rapidly, but they’re still 40 percent above a year ago.”  The average pump price dropped 3 cents to $3.79 a gallon.  The report from Purchase, New York-based MasterCard is
assembled by MasterCard Advisors, the company’s consulting arm.
The information is based on credit-card swipes and cash and
check payments at about 140,000 U.S. gasoline stations.  Visa Inc. (V)  is the biggest payments network company by
transactions processed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
