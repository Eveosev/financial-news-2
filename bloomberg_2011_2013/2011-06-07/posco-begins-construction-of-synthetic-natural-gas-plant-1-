Posco (005490) ,  South Korea â€™s largest
steelmaker, began construction of a synthetic natural gas plant
in South Jeolla province to reduce fuel costs.  The plant will use a high pressure, high temperature
process to produce 500,000 metric tons of gas a year from coal
when it is completed by the end of 2013, the Pohang, South
Korea-based company said in an e-mailed statement today.  Posco forecast the plant will save 150 billion won ($139
million) in power generation costs per year, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
