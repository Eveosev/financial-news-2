Senegal’s government needs to boost
revenue and cut non-essential spending to finance investment in
the  energy industry , the  International Monetary Fund  said.  The IMF commented after its first review of a three-year
advisory program to the West African state that began in
December.  While Senegal’s economic performance under the program was
“satisfactory,” it needs to do more to reduce regular power
outages that have damped economic growth, the IMF said in a
statement on its website yesterday. The fund advised the West
African nation to use part of a $500 million Eurobond sale last
month to boost generating capacity.  “Although there is some space for temporarily higher
fiscal deficits, a substantial contribution will need to come
from additional revenue measures and reprioritizing
expenditure,” the IMF said, citing the fund’s Deputy Managing
Director Nemat Sahfik.  To contact the reporter on this story:
