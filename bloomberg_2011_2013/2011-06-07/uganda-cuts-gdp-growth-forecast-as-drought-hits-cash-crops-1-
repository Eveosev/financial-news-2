growth forecast for the 2010-11 fiscal year to 6.3 percent

poor rains.  The government has previously forecast growth of 6.4
percent for the 12 months through June, the Finance Ministry
said in a budget document handed to reporters in the capital,

sugar cane and exported horticulture experienced a huge decline

investment in energy, roads and rail links, the ministry said.
