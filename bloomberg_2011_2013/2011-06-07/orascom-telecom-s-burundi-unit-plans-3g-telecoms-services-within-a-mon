Orascom Telecom Holding SAE (ORTE) ’s
Burundian unit said it may introduce a third-generation mobile-
phone network in the East African country within the next month
as it seeks to expand its subscriber base.  U-Com Burundi SA carried out a test of the new system on
May 31, spokesman Christian Kabirigi said in an interview today
from Bujumbura, the capital. The network enables faster
transmission of data and allows mobile-phone users to download
music and video to their handsets.  U-Com is Burundi’s biggest mobile-phone company with more
than 1 million subscribers, Kabirigi said. The company competes
with state-owned Onatel; Econet Wireless Holdings Ltd.;
Africell, owned by VTL Holdings; and Lacell SU, according to
 Business Monitor International , the London-based research group.  Burundi’s government has said it plans to sell Onatel to
private investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
