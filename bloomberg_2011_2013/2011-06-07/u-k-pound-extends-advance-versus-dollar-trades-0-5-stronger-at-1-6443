The pound rose against the dollar and
the yen as stocks advanced after European Central Bank President
 Jean-Claude Trichet  signaled his support for Greek government
bond rollovers, lifting demand for riskier assets.  The U.K. currency gained versus the dollar for the third
day in four. Data showed U.K. home prices rose 0.1 percent in
May, following a 1.4 percent decline the previous month. Ten-
year gilts fell as the U.K. Debt Management Office sold 1
billion pounds ($1.64 billion) of inflation-linked bonds due in
March 2040. The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  advanced 0.2 percent and the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index increased 0.5 percent. The pound
weakened for a sixth day against the euro.  “The pound’s a touch stronger against the dollar, which
looks relatively weak across the board,” said  Lee Hardman , a
currency strategist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in
London. “The move against the yen suggests slightly improved
risk appetite.”  The pound strengthened 0.5 percent to $1.6440 as of 4:29
p.m. in London. Sterling climbed 0.7 percent to 131.872 yen, and
slipped 0.1 percent to 89.23 pence per euro.  Sterling touched its weakest level on record today in
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes, a measure of 10
developed-market currencies.  Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s coalition government is
pushing through the biggest spending cuts since World War II.
The  Bank of England  has kept its main interest rate unchanged at
a record-low 0.5 percent since March 2009 and bought 200 billion
pounds of bonds under a so-called quantitative easing program
that ended in February 2010. Policy makers will announce their
latest decision on June 9.  ‘Iffy’ Data  “Sterling is looking a little bit firmer, but that data is
still looking iffy,” said  Steve Barrow , head of research for
Group-of-10 currencies at Standard Bank Plc in London, referring
to the U.K. housing data.  The 10-year gilt yield climbed six basis points to 3.33
percent, heading for its biggest daily gain since April 27. It
reached 3.22 percent on June 3, the lowest since November 30.
The 3.75 percent security maturing in September 2020 fell 0.50,
or 5 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 103.31. Two-year
yields added two basis points to 0.90 percent.  Investors bid for 2.3 times the amount of index-linked
gilts on sale, the DMO said. The bonds were allotted at a real
yield of 0.587 percent.  Gilts have handed investors 2.5 percent this year after
returning 7.6 percent last year, according to indexes compiled
by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies.  Gilt Futures  They advanced amid optimism the government would control
Britain’s record deficit after the coalition between Cameron’s
Conservatives and  Nick Clegg ’s Liberal Democrats replaced the
Labour party after last year’s election.  Gilt futures may rise as high as 121.91 should the price of
the September 2011 contract breach a so-called resistance level
at 121.03, UBS AG said, citing trading patterns.  “Gilts are bullish while they trade above the 119.87 mid-
point,”  Richard Adcock , head of fixed-income technical strategy
at UBS in London, wrote in an e-mailed report today.  The long gilt future contract expiring in September slipped
0.5 percent to 120.00. It reached 121.03 on June 3, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  “A break above Friday’s high at 121.03 will be the next
bullish trigger, opening the door to our objective marked by the
October extreme at 121.91,” Adcock wrote.  To contact the reporters on this story:
