The U.K.’s Financial Services
Authority recommended that companies offering investments
described as “guaranteed,” “protected” or “secure” should
be required to state precisely what those terms mean, the
Financial Times reported.  So-called structured products, which offer investments in
traded equities with some degree of protection, are being
marketed without “clear and adequate justification for the
descriptions used,” the newspaper cited the regulator as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
