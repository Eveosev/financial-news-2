Spanish billionaire Enrique Banuelos
is seeking to replace the board of Brasil Ecodiesel Industria &
Comercio de Biocombustiveis & Oleos Vegetais SA after plans to
merge it with crop producer Vanguarda do Brasil SA failed.  “Brasil Ecodiesel’s board member and shareholder Silvio
Tini refused to analyse the merger proposal on claims it would
dilute his own stake,” said Marcelo Paracchini, Chief Executive
Officer of Veremonte Participacoes SA in Brazil, Banuelos’s
holding company. “It is a case of conflict of interests,” he
said in a phone interview from  Sao Paulo  yesterday.  Veremonte proposed to merge Sao Paulo-based Brasil
Ecodiesel and Vanguarda, in which it holds a 50 percent stake,
in April. The entity would have had a combined value of 2.16
billion reais, the company said.  Banuelos is the controlling shareholder of Ecodiesel, with
22.4 percent of shares held through the Vila Rica I Fundo de
Investimento em Participacoes fund. Brasil Ecodiesel confirmed
the call from the Vila Rica fund for an extraordinary meeting to
discuss replacing the board in a regulatory filing late
yesteday.  Ecodiesel’s board has seven members. Four of them were
appointed by shareholder Tini, two by Veremonte and one is an
independent member, Paracchini said. The new board would have
two members appointed by Tini and Veremonte each, Paracchini
said.  Vanguarda is a soybeans, cotton and corn producer in
 Brazil . It plants 230,000 hectares (568,300 acres) of soybeans,
corn and cotton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
