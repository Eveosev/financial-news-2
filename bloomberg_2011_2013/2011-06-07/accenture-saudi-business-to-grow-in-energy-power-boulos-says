Accenture Plc (ACN) , the world’s second-
largest technology consultant, aims to expand in  Saudi Arabia ’s
energy, utilities and petrochemical industries, said Omar
Boulos, managing director of Accenture in the  Middle East .  In Saudi Arabia, Accenture’s biggest market in the region,
the company will grow more quickly than the 17 percent year-on-
year sales growth in the information technology services
industry in the kingdom, Boulos said in a phone interview today.
Accenture also expects either to match or outperform growth in
the advisory services markets in United Arab Emirates, Qatar and
Kuwait, Boulos said.  Accenture bought a majority stake in the IT services unit
of Saudi Arabia’s Al Faisaliah Group, the company said in a
statement today. It didn’t disclose financial details or the
size of the holding.  “This will help us accelerate building up our presence”
in key industries like energy and utilities, Boulos said, adding
the company also sees good prospects in healthcare and financial
and retail industries in the kingdom.  Saudi Arabia will be the source of a growing amount of
business for the company, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
