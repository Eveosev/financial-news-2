Ukrainian lender VAT Nadra Bank
increased its capital by $22.6 million with a subordinated loan
from investors.  Ukraine’s central bank has approved the capital increase,
Kiev-based Nadra said in e-mailed statement today.  Nadra was state-managed from February 2009 when it ran out
of cash during the global financial crisis. Ukrainian
businessman Dmitry Firtash acquired 89.9 percent of the bank’s
statutory capital on May 4 this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
