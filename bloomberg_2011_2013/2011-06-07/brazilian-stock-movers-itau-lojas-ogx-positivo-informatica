parentheses and prices are as of 4 p.m. New York time. Preferred
shares are usually the most-traded class of stock.  The Bovespa Index rose 0.2 percent to 63,217.85.  Brazilian consumer prices rose at their slowest pace since
September last month, as a stronger currency cut costs for
imported consumer products and fuel prices slumped. Prices rose
0.47 percent in May, the government’s statistics agency said
today, matching the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 39
economists, and less than the 0.77 percent increase in April.  B2W Cia. Global do Varejo, (BTOW3 BS)  Brazil ’s largest
online retailer, advanced 1.6 percent to 21.90 reais as

retailer, gained 3.4 percent to 16.09 reais. MRV Engenharia &
Participacoes SA (MRVE3 BS), Brazil’s fifth-biggest homebuilder

largest bank by market value, rose 1.5 percent to 35.55 reais as
Barclays Plc initiated coverage with an “overweight” rating.  OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA (OGXP3 BS), the  oil
company  controlled by Brazilian billionaire Eike Batista, rose
2.2 percent to 15.51 reais as Chief Financial Officer Marcelo Faber Torres said the company is “fully funded” after selling
$2.56 billion in a bond sale.  Positivo Informatica SA (POSI3)  (POSI3 BS), Brazil’s biggest
computer maker, declined 8.7 percent to 7.82 reais. Positivo
said yesterday that its shareholders aren’t in talks to sell the
company to Lenovo Group Ltd. Positivo shares surged 26 percent
