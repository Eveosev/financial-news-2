Avaya Inc., the phone-equipment maker
owned by private-equity firms  Silver Lake  and TPG Capital, may
file for an initial public offering that would seek to raise
about $1 billion, according to a person with direct knowledge of
the matter.  The company may file as early as this week, said the
person, who declined to be identified because the plans aren’t
public. The  Basking Ridge , New Jersey-based company, spun off
from Lucent Technologies Inc in 2000, was taken private in 2007
for $8.2 billion.  Avaya, which sells phones and related equipment to
corporate clients, boosted sales 22 percent in the fiscal year
ending in September, according to regulatory filings. The
company bought Nortel Networks Corp.’s enterprise-
telecommunications unit for $915 million in 2009, gaining more
corporate phone equipment.  Skip MacAskill, a spokesman for Avaya, didn’t return a
phone call requesting comment. Jennifer Farrelly, a spokeswoman
for Silver Lake, and  Owen Blicksilver , spokesman for TPG,
declined to comment.  The Wall Street Journal reported Avaya’s IPO plans earlier.  More than 15 technology companies have filed for a public
offering this year, an increase of 45 percent from last year.
LinkedIn Corp., the largest professional-networking site, had a
valuation as high as $11.6 billion in its first day of trading
last month, while online coupon site Groupon Inc. filed to raise
$750 million last week.  To contact the reporters on this story:
