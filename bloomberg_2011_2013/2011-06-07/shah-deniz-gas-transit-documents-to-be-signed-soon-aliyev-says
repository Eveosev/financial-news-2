All documents necessary for the
transport of natural gas from the BP Plc-led Shah Deniz deposit
in Azerbaijan to  Europe  “will soon be signed,” President  Ilham
Aliyev  said today in Baku.  The U.S. and European Union-backed Southern Corridor plan
to bring Caspian gas to Europe via Turkey and bypassing  Russia 
will rely on gas from the $20 billion second phase of the Shah
Deniz development.  Pipeline projects including the OMV AG-led Nabucco project,
 Statoil ASA (STL)  and E.ON AG’s Trans Adriatic Pipeline and the
Interconnector Italy-Turkey-Greece link led by Edison SpA, Depa
SA and Boru Hatlari Ile Petrol Tasima AS, or Botas, are vying
for gas volumes from Shah Deniz-2.  To contact the reporters on this story:
