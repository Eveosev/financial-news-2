Oil options volatility edged higher
as the underlying futures gained 8 cents amid speculation that
an increase in OPEC production quotas will reduce spare capacity
and cause tight supplies when demand rebounds.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
July, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 32 percent as of 4 p.m. in  New York , up
from 31.9 percent yesterday.  Crude oil for July delivery settled at $99.09 a barrel on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the first gain in three days,
rebounding from a two-week low. Futures have risen 39 percent in
the past year.  The most active contracts in electronic trading today were
July $95 puts, with 3,536 lots changing hands. They dropped 11
cents to 68 cents a barrel. July $90 puts, the next-most active
option, slipped 4 cents to 23 cents a barrel with 2,360 lots
trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  Nymex distributes real-time data for electronic trading and
releases information on floor trading, where the bulk of options
trading occurs, the next business day.  July $95 puts were the most active options traded in the
previous session, with 4,454 lots changing hands. They gained 17
cent to 79 cents a barrel. The next-most active options, August
$90 puts, increased 13 cents to $1.05 a barrel on volume of
3,366 lots.  Open interest was highest for December 2012 $80 puts with
46,177 contracts. Next were December 2011 $120 calls with 42,067
and December 2011 $150 calls with 38,540.  To contact the reporter on this story:
