South Korea ’s won dropped as U.S.
labor-market data added to evidence the global economic recovery
is losing traction, damping the outlook for exports.  U.S. payrolls grew at the slowest pace in eight months in
May and the jobless rate unexpectedly climbed to 9.1 percent,
the highest level this year, Labor Department data released on
June 3 showed.  “Concerns that a global economic recovery led by the U.S.
may be delayed is damping demand for riskier assets,” said
Jeong Mi Young, a currency analyst at Samsung Futures Inc. in
Seoul. “Some importers are trying to buy the dollar, limiting
further declines in the won.”  The won dropped 0.2 percent to 1,082.05 per dollar from
June 3 as of the 3 p.m. close in  Seoul , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Korean financial markets were closed
yesterday for a holiday. The currency has strengthened 4.1
percent this year.  South Korea’s exchange rate is determined by economic
fundamentals and supply and demand, and the government hasn’t
tried to artificially weaken the won to help the economy,
Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan said in parliament in Seoul today.  The government’s five-year bonds gained, with the yield on
the notes due March 2016 dropping four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 3.79 percent, according to prices from
Korea Exchange Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
