The government of  Australia ’s  New
South Wales  state scrapped a plan to reduce incentives for
energy generated under a solar power initiative after failing to
gain enough support to pass the measure in parliament.  Australia’s most populous state won’t proceed with the plan
to cut retroactively the payments to owners of small solar
projects to 40 Australian cents (43 cents) a kilowatt-hour from
60 cents, Premier Barry O’Farrell said today in a  statement .  The solar program, started in 2009, attracted more than
160,000 participants, driving the cost to the state to as much
as A$1.4 billion, O’Farrell said. European countries including
 Spain  and the  Czech Republic  have reduced payments for existing
solar systems under initiatives to feed power to the grid due to
rising expenses.  “I wanted to do everything possible to reduce the cost to
taxpayers of the solar bonus scheme and keep a lid on
electricity prices,” O’Farrell said in the statement today.
“However, I am a realist and there is no point putting up
legislation to the upper house which is going to be rejected.”  The original rate of 60 cents was reduced to 20 cents in
October for new projects. The cut announced in May would have
affected those who qualified for the initial incentive rate.  The  Clean Energy Council , which represents the industry in
Australia, said today that it welcomed the decision.  “The new government has inherited a difficult situation,
but it has honored the investment of solar households,” said
Matthew Warren, the group’s chief executive officer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
