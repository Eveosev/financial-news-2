Day-ahead electricity in eastern
Europe fell as lower prices in  Germany  reduced power imports
from the  Czech Republic  and  Poland .  Czech day-ahead power decreased 0.4 percent to 61.09 euros
($89.59) a megawatt-hour, according to broker data compiled by
Bloomberg. Polish electricity for tomorrow declined 0.3 percent
to 228.31 zloty ($84.79) a megawatt-hour, according to Polish
power exchange data compiled by Bloomberg.  Hungarian electricity, traded on the Budapest-based power
exchange, lost 2.3 percent to 59.95 euros a megawatt-hour,
according to the bourse’s website. The equivalent contract in
Germany, a benchmark for eastern Europe, fell 3.6 percent to
59.80 euros, broker data show.  The Czech Republic has 17,625 megawatts of capacity
installed, according to Bloomberg data. The country was
exporting 1,418 megawatts of power to Germany between 12 p.m.
and 1 p.m., according to  Entsoe , the European Transmission
System Operators transparency platform. Exports of Polish
electricity were set to decline tomorrow as more maintenance is
planned, according to  PSE Operator , the country’s transmission
system operator.  Bloomberg tracks power prices from brokers including GFI
