SunPower Corp. (SPWRA) , the second-largest
U.S. solar panel maker, raised its second-quarter revenue
outlook and cut its fiscal 2011 margin forecast because of
pricing pressure and a shift from utility-scale projects in
 Italy .  SunPower lowered its gross margin guidance for fiscal 2011
to 15 percent to 17 percent from a previous range of 20 percent
to 22 percent and raised its second-quarter revenue outlook to
$550 million to $600 million from a previous $475 million to
$525 million, the San Jose, California-based company said today
in a statement.  The company sees annual adjusted profit of $1.20 to $1.70 a
share. The average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
was $1.68 a share.  “In response, we rebalanced our product allocation in
Italy away from  power plants  and toward our European residential
and commercial business where demand remains strong,”  Tom Werner , SunPower president and chief executive officer, said in
the statement.  Italy, the world’s second-largest solar market after
Germany, said on May 5 it will cut incentive rates for
photovoltaic energy. The policy change would lead to $14 million
to $29 million in charges and one-time expenses and in 2011,
SunPower said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
