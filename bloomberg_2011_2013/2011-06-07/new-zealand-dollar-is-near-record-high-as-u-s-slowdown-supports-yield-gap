The Australian and New Zealand
dollars fell as lingering concern about  Europe ’s debt crisis and
the U.S. economy damped demand for growth-sensitive currencies.  The Aussie and kiwi declined against the majority of their
16 most-traded counterparts after the  International Monetary
Fund  said its 26 billion-euro ($38 billion) loan to Portugal
“entails important risks.” The currencies also fell as stock
losses sapped demand for higher-yielding assets.  “Europe’s situation is grave even though people have been
rather optimistic,” said  Tsutomu Soma , a bond and currency
dealer at Okasan Securities Co. in Tokyo. “Commodity currencies
are losing momentum with the U.S. economy slowing.”  Australia’s dollar fell 1 percent to $1.0613 at 11:15 a.m.
in  New York , from $1.0721 yesterday. The Aussie dropped 1.3
percent to 84.78 yen, from 85.87.  New Zealand ’s dollar declined 0.6 percent to 81.54 U.S.
cents from 82.05. It touched a record 82.64 U.S. cents on May
31. The kiwi fell 0.9 percent to 65.11 yen.  The MSCI World Index fell 0.6 percent.  The measures attached to the loan for Portugal “may fail
to alleviate sovereign debt concerns, with an adverse impact on
government financing prospects,” IMF staff wrote in a May 17
report that was posted on the fund’s website yesterday.  U.S. Recovery  Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said yesterday the
central bank should maintain record monetary stimulus to boost
an “uneven” and “frustratingly slow” recovery in the
economy.  The Reserve Bank of Australia yesterday held  interest rates 
unchanged and said current policy settings are appropriate. The
 Reserve Bank  of New Zealand is forecast to keep its benchmark
rate at 2.5 percent tomorrow, according to all 15 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Data showed today that Australia’s home loans gained 4.8
percent in April following a revised 1.1 percent decline in
March. Employers added 25,000 jobs in May after cutting 22,100
in April, while the jobless rate was unchanged at 4.9 percent,
according to the median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg
survey before the statistics bureau data tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
