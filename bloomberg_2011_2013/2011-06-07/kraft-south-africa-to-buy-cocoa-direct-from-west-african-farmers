Kraft Foods Inc. (KFT) ’s South African unit
will pay extra for  cocoa beans  sourced directly from West
African farmers to make its Cadbury Dairy Milk chocolate bar,
securing it  Fairtrade  certification, the company said.  Thousands of farmers in the world’s top producing region
for the chocolate ingredient will receive internationally agreed
Fairtrade prices and a further $200 per metric ton to invest in
local business and community development, the world’s second-
biggest food company said in an e-mailed statement today.  Fairtrade certification requires a company to pay cocoa and
sugar producers an additional amount, which is used for programs
from building wells to hiring local teachers for the community.  Fairtrade Label  South Africa , which confirmed that it
issued the certification for Kraft, is part of a network it says
represents 500,000 African small-scale producers and farm
workers. The group of 24 organizations worldwide seeks to secure
better deals for farmers around the world.  Cocoa for July delivery dropped 0.4 percent to 1,772 pounds
($2,907) a metric ton on NYSE Liffe in  London  yesterday, having
earlier fallen to 1,765 pounds, the lowest price since August
2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
