U.S. Bancorp, the fifth-largest U.S.
lender by deposits, will focus on increasing its dividend after
regulatory capital levels are set, Chief Financial Officer
Andrew Cecere said.  The bank is aiming for a payout ratio of 30 percent to 40
percent in the “long term,” Cecere said today at an investor
conference hosted by  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  in New York. Share
buybacks are a priority after the dividend and will have a
similar ratio, he said.  “First and foremost is the dividend level,” Cecere said.
“That leaves us plenty of opportunity to invest back in the
business.”  U.S. Bancorp boosted its quarterly dividend by 150 percent
to 12.5 cents in March. The Minneapolis-based lender’s board
also approved the repurchase as many as 50 million shares. U.S.
Bancorp is waiting to repurchase shares until it has “more
clarity” about regulatory capital levels, Cecere said.  U.S. Bancorp rose 2 cents to $24.13 at 11:53 a.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have fallen 11
percent this year through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
