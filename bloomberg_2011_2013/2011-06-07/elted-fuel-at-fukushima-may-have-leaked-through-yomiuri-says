The melted fuel at Tokyo Electric
Power Co.’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear power station may have
leaked through the pressure vessels of the Nos. 1 to 3 reactors,
the Yomiuri newspaper reported.  The Japanese government will submit a report to the
 International Atomic Energy Agency  that raises the possibility
the fuel dropped through the bottom of the pressure vessels, a
situation described as a “melt through” and considered more
serious than a “meltdown,” according to the report, which
cited the document.  To contact the reporter on this story:
