The  Swiss franc  weakened against all
16 major counterparts tracked by Bloomberg as data showed
consumer prices were steady last month, damping speculation that
the nation’s central bank will raise borrowing costs.  The franc weakened for the first time in three days versus
the euro. Consumer-price inflation in May was unchanged from a
month earlier, the Federal Statistics Office in Neuchatel said
today. Prices rose 0.4 percent from a year earlier. Economists’
median estimate was for a monthly decline of 0.1 percent. The
franc reached a record against the dollar before declining.  “The CPI data won’t spook the  Swiss National Bank , which
remains relatively dovish,” said  Chris Walker , a foreign-
exchange strategist at UBS AG in  London . “The SNB doesn’t want
to give any more incentive to buy the franc. They’re still
worried about the level of the franc, which is mainly driven by
external factors, such as risk appetite.”  The franc depreciated 1.1 percent to 1.22960 per euro as of
4:33 p.m. in London. It reached 1.20543, the strongest on
record, on June 2. The Swiss currency dropped 0.4 percent to
83.84 centimes per dollar after reaching 83.27 earlier, the
strongest since at least 1971.  The SNB’s rate announcement is scheduled for June 16. The
central bank kept its three-month Libor target at 0.25 percent
at its last meeting in March.  The Swiss currency has strengthened amid concern that the
European sovereign-debt crisis will deteriorate, spurring
investor demand for a haven.  The franc has climbed 5.6 percent against a basket of nine
developed-market peers this year, according to Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes, the best performance
among the 10 currencies tracked by the measure.  Switzerland ’s central bank sold 793 million francs ($944
million) of 91-day Treasury bills at an average yield of 0.079
percent today. That’s little changed from the previous auction
of similar-maturity securities on May 31, which were allotted at
0.08 percent. The SNB plans to sell bonds due 2031 tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
