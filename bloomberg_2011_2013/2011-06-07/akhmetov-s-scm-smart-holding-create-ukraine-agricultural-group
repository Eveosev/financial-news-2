System Capital Management Group,
owned by Ukraine’s richest man, Rinat Akhmetov, and LLC Smart
Holding, owned by Ukrainian businessman Vadim Novinsky, formed
an agricultural company called HarvEast.  HarvEast will manage 200,000 hectares of agricultural
lands, cattle and pig farms, combine feed production and other
agricultural assets, System Capital Management, also known as
SCM, said in a statement on its Website today.  “The decision to invest in agriculture corresponds with
SCM’s development strategy,” said SCM Chief Executive Officer
Oleh Popov in the statement. One of SCM’s strategic goals is
“diversification and increasing the shasre of non-industrial
businesses.”  The group took over the agriculture assets of the
Mariupolsky Metallurgical Plant of Ilyich, which belongs to
Metinvest Holding LLC. Metinvest is 75 percent-owned by SCM and
25 percent by Smart Holding.  After the formation of the holding is completed next year,
it will operate in Donetsk, Zaporizhzhya, Cherkasy, Zhytomyr
regions and in the Crimean peninsula, according to the Website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
