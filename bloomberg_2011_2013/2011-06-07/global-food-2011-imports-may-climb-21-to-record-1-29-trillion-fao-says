Global food imports may rise 21
percent to a record $1.29 trillion this year, with “poorer”
countries spending up to 30 percent more than last year, the
 Food and Agriculture Organization  of the  United Nations  said.  Costs of grain-based commodities and vegetable oils may
account for 40 percent of the increase, the FAO said in a report
on its website today. Livestock bills may rise an average 17
percent, sugar and beverages by 26 percent and vegetables and
fruits by 13 percent, it said.  “This is going to be quite an increase for countries which
are already vulnerable, for countries which are already
experiencing a strong food inflation,”  Abdolreza Abbassian , a
senior economist at the Rome-based FAO, said on an FAO webcast.  Food costs were near a record in May, buoyed by rising meat
and dairy prices, the FAO said in a separate report today.
Staple foods including corn will more than double in two decades
unless action is taken, Oxfam International said last week.  “The supply situation as good as it may seem is barely
meeting the demand and therefore prices remain at very
stubbornly high levels,” Abbassian said. “They’ve been like
this for almost six months and the prospects for the new season
seem to suggest the same situation may prevail for still some
time.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
