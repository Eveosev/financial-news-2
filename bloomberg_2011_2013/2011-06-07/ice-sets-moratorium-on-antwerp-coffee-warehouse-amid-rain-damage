ICE Futures U.S. imposed a moratorium
on certification of coffee stored at an Antwerp warehouse
because of roof damage caused by heavy rainfall.  Certification of 200 lots will be suspended until the
coffee meets the  New York  exchange’s delivery standards, the
ICE’s Warehouse and License Committee said yesterday in a  notice 
on its website.  Arabica-coffee futures for July delivery rose 3 cents, or
1.2 percent, to $2.635 a pound at 10:04 a.m. on ICE in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
