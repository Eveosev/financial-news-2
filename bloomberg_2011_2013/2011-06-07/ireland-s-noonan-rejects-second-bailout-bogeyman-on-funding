Ireland’s government faces “no
urgency” to return to international debt markets because the
state is funded into the second half of 2013, Finance Minister
 Michael Noonan  said today.  The government can draw on as much as 65 billion euros
($95.4 billion) to run the state from its 85 billion-euro
European Union-International Monetary Fund rescue package,
Noonan said in the parliament in Dublin today. Noonan said the
state will require 75 billion euros in funding to the end of
2013 and won’t seek additional emergency aid this year or next.  “If you want to scaremonger and frighten the children and
talk about the bogeyman coming down the chimney, go ahead and do
it,” Noonan said in response to a question on whether the
country would seek a second bailout.  The finance minister said Ireland still plans to return to
bond markets in the second half of 2012 if the yield on Irish
debt falls below the interest rate on the aid. The yield on 10-
year bonds was at 10.77 percent today.  Noonan also said funds needed to recapitalize the country’s
bank’s may be less 20 billion euros, compared with the 35
billion euros earmarked in the EU-IMF bailout.  The difference in yield between Irish and German 10-year
bonds was at 768 basis points today compared with an average of
606 points in the week after Ireland agreed to its international
bailout in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
