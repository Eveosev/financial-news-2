Belarus raised retail gasoline prices
for the fourth time this year in a bid to stem the illegal
outflow of oil products to neighboring countries after it
devalued its currency.  Prices at the pump rose an average 31 percent today,
pushing the cost of 95-octane fuel to 5,800 Belarusian rubles
($1.17 at the official central  bank rate ), state energy holding
Belneftekhim said in a statement. That’s equal to about $4.40
per gallon, more than in the U.S.  The increases were needed “to protect the domestic market
from non-sanctioned exports of oil products by lowering the
disparity of car-fuel prices in Belarus and neighboring
countries,” Belneftekhim said today.  Belarus, which devalued its currency by 36 percent against
the dollar last month, is seeking foreign currency to help cover
the gap between what it imports and what it exports. That
current account deficit reached 16 percent of gross domestic
product last year, more than  Greece , which has a 50 percent
chance of defaulting, Moody’s Investors Service said June 1.  The Russian-led Eurasian Economic Community agreed to
provide the former Soviet republic with a $3 billion, 10-year
bailout loan on June 4 and is seeking a second stabilization
loan from the  International Monetary Fund . The IMF in 2009
agreed to lend Belarus $3.44 billion.  “Stop Gasoline,” an activist group, said in a statement
that it plans to block traffic in downtown Minsk tonight to
protest the rising prices of gasoline.  To contact the reporters on this story:
