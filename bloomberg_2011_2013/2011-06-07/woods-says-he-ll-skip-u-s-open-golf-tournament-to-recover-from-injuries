Tiger Woods  said he will skip next
week’s U.S. Open golf championship as he recovers from knee and
ankle injuries.  Woods, the winner of 14 major golf championships, disclosed
his plans in a statement on his  Twitter  page.  “Not playing in U.S. Open,” Woods wrote. “Very
disappointed. Short-term frustration for long-term gain.”  Mark Steinberg , Woods’s agent, said the golfer won’t
require surgery and will continue to undergo rehabilitation.  It’s “all about the long-term and being smart,” Steinberg
said in an e-mail.  Woods, 35, sustained the injuries during the third round of
April’s Masters Tournament, the year’s first major. He
aggravated the injuries and withdrew from the Players
championship in May after nine holes.  At the time, Woods had said he would “do whatever is
necessary to play in the  U.S. Open .” The tournament, the
season’s second major, is scheduled for June 16-19 at
Congressional Country Club outside  Washington .  “I know he’s a great competitor and he wants to get out
and win,” Mark O’Meara, Woods’s friend and current golfer on
the 50-and-over Champions Tour, told reporters today at New
York’s Westchester Country Club. “It wouldn’t be easy being
thrown right in the mixer and coming back at a course like
Congressional. It’s been a longer road back than would be
expected. Every year that goes by, it only gets tougher, and he
knows that.”  Woods hasn’t won a tournament since November 2009. He’s
fallen to No. 15 in the Official World Golf Ranking after
holding the No. 1 spot for a record 281 weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
