Japanese stocks gained for the first
time in four days as  Tokyo Electric  Power Co. advanced after the
government said it didn’t support a breakup of the utility and
as carmakers climbed.  Tokyo Electric, operator of the nuclear plant crippled by
the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, rebounded from yesterday’s
record 28 percent plunge.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  climbed 2.2 percent
after the company said it will be able to announce earnings
forecasts this week, boosting confidence that the world’s No. 1
carmaker is recovering from the quake. Camera-maker  Canon Inc. (7751) 
sank 2.6 percent after the end of a share buyback program.  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average gained 0.7 percent to 9,442.95
at the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo, fluctuating between gains and
losses more than 20 times in the morning session after the yen
rose against the dollar last night. The broader Topix rose 0.7
percent to 813.76. Stocks in the index trade at an average of
0.93 times book value, the lowest level among the world’s 15
largest equity markets.  “Shares are undervalued,” said  Naoki Fujiwara , who helps
oversee $6 billion in Tokyo at Shinkin Asset Management Co.
“The currency is stable after temporarily touching a level
stronger than 80 yen.”  Japan’s currency traded near its highest in a month today.
The yen gained to as high as 79.98 yen to the  U.S. dollar 
yesterday, the highest intraday level since May 5, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. A strong yen reduces the value of
overseas sales when repatriated.  Thin Volume  Shares fluctuated today amid thin volume. The total value
of stocks traded on the Topix fell to 1.27 trillion yen today,
15 percent less than the 12-month average.  The Topix has tumbled 12 percent since a magnitude-9
earthquake and tsunami devastated  Japan ’s northeast coast,
disabling Tokyo Electric’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant and leaving
almost 24,000 people dead or missing.  Tokyo Electric rallied 4.4 percent to 216 yen after Chief
Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said the power company’s
liquidation should be avoided to protect victims of the disaster
entitled to compensation. Edano was responding to comments
yesterday by Tokyo Stock Exchange President  Atsushi Saito , who
said Tokyo Electric should be put into  bankruptcy protection .  Chubu Electric Power Co. advanced 2 percent to 1,152 yen.
Kansai Electric Power Co. rose 2 percent to 1,226 yen.  Toyota Forecast  Toyota climbed 2.2 percent to 3,285 yen after the carmaker
said it will announce full-year earnings forecasts for the year
ending in March 2012 on June 10 in Tokyo. The carmaker has
delayed the announcement because supply chain disruptions from
the quake have made it difficult to predict production levels.  Separately, the Nikkei newspaper reported the carmaker will
raise Prius wagon production to 5,000 a month from an earlier
planned 3,000 a month by August or September.  “Production is gradually normalizing, and there is an
expectation of business circumstances recovering a lot
quicker,” said  Hiroichi Nishi , equities manager at SMBC Nikko
Securities Inc. “Auto companies will announce their full-year
forecasts soon, which they couldn’t figure out before either.”  Toyota-related companies also gained.  Denso Corp. (6902) , a maker
of car air-conditioners and airbags, rose 1.6 percent to 2,818
yen. Aisin Seiki Co., which makes transmissions and clutches,
increased 2 percent to 2,888 yen.  Nissan Motor Co. and  Mitsubishi Motors Corp. (7211)  both advanced
at least 2 percent.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index yesterday retreated 1.1
percent to the lowest level since March 18 in  New York , falling
for a fourth day in New York amid concern economic growth is
slowing and the  Federal Reserve  will boost  capital requirements 
for the nation’s largest banks.  Canon sank 2.6 percent to 3,745 yen, the biggest drop on
the Nikkei 225, after announcing it completed a 50 billion yen
($623 million) stock buyback.  To contact the reporter on this story:
