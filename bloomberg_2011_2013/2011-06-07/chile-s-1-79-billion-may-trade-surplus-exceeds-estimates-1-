Chile ’s trade surplus in May more
than tripled from the previous year to a bigger-than-forecast
$1.79 billion, the central bank said on its website.  The median estimate of 10 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
was for a trade surplus of $1.78 billion. Chile imported $5.94
billion in May and exported $7.74 billion, including $4.15
billion in copper, according to central bank data. Copper prices
averaged $4.06 a pound in May compared with $3.17 a pound a year
before.  The price of copper, Chile’s biggest export, will remain
high for “a very long period of time,” President Sebastian Pinera said in an interview with Bloomberg Television last
month.  “Not only copper but all commodity prices are very high
basically because there has been a strong change in the
structure of the world economy,” said the Harvard-trained
economist. “Countries like  China  are growing very rapidly and
they are demanding a lot of these kind of commodities. And I
think that will continue.”  Chile’s peso gained 0.3 percent to 467.25 per  U.S. dollar 
at 8:34 a.m. New York time from 468.45 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
