Kingsgate Consolidated Ltd. (KCN) , an
Australian gold producer, rose the most in more than two years
in Sydney trading after receiving approvals to access all mining
areas at its Chatree gold mine in  Thailand .  Kingsgate, based in Sydney, rose 14 percent to A$8.62 at
the 4:10 p.m. local time close, the biggest gain since Dec. 3
2008, trimming losses for the year to 21 percent.  The approvals will “ensure a strong second half to
calendar 2011,” Gavin Thomas, chief executive officer of
Kingsgate, said today in a statement. Production at the mine
will total about 150,000 ounces next fiscal year, Kingsgate said.
Combined with the company’s other producing assets, output will
be about 250,000 ounces, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
