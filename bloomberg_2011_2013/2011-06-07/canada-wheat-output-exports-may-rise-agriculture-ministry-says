Canada ’s production of wheat,
excluding durum, may rise to 21 million metric tons in the year
beginning Aug. 1, up from an estimated 20.142 million a year
earlier, the Canadian Agriculture Ministry said.  About 7.39 million hectares may be harvested, up from 7.024
million a year earlier, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada said
today in an e-mailed report. Inventories at the end of next year
may drop to 4.5 million tons, compared with 4.8 million a year
earlier, in part as exports increase, the ministry said.  Canada’s durum production may rise to 4.5 million tons from
3.025 million a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
