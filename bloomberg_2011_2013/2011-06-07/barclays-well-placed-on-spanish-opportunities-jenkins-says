Barclays Plc (BARC)  is “well placed” to
take advantage of consolidation in European markets including
Spain, according to retail and business banking Chief Executive
Officer  Antony Jenkins .  “You will have seen the speculation around our interests
in Spain,” he said today at a conference in  New York  organized
by Deutsche Bank AG. “We are well placed to take advantage of
the consolidation we see happening in the European markets but
will only consider these opportunities if they meet our strict
financial hurdles.”  The bank may acquire Spanish savings bank  Caja de Ahorros
del Mediterraneo (CAM) , or CAM, with guarantees from the Bank of
Spain, El Confidencial reported earlier today citing
unidentified people close to the matter. CAM said on May 27
“doubtful” loans were 8.5 percent of total lending at the end
of March, the month its planned merger with three other Spanish
savings banks fell apart.  Barclays’s plan of improving or selling businesses with
poor returns, reducing costs and improving revenue means the
bank can achieve its planned return on equity of 13 percent by
2013, he said.  “Our targets for returns are ambitious but achievable and
Barclays is not ramping up risk in order to achieve them,”
Jenkins said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
