Vancouver  Canucks defenseman Aaron Rome was suspended for the rest of the Stanley Cup Final for a
hit that knocked  Boston Bruins  forward Nathan Horton out of the
championship series with a concussion last night.  Horton had passed the puck and was distracted when Rome
lowered his shoulder and dropped him to the ice. Rome was
assessed a 5-minute major penalty for interference and a game
misconduct.  “The hit by Rome was clearly beyond what is acceptable in
terms of how late it was delivered after Horton had released the
puck,” said  Mike Murphy , the  National Hockey League ’s senior
vice president of hockey operations. “And it caused significant
injury.”  Horton, 26, has eight goals and nine assists this
postseason for  Boston , was taken off the ice on a stretcher
during the Bruins’ 8-1 victory in Game 3 in Boston.  Vancouver leads the series 2-1 heading into Game 4 tomorrow
night.  Rome, a defenseman who has one goal in the playoffs, was
suspended for four games. If the Final ends before Game 7, the
suspension will carry over to the start of the 2011-2012 regular
season, the NHL said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
