Gold rose to a three-week high as
mounting tensions in  Egypt  spurred demand for the precious metal
as an investment haven.  Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak  defied calls for his
immediate resignation as thousands of protesters demanded an end
to his 30-year rule. Gold headed for the third straight weekly
gain after slumping 6.1 percent in January. In 2010, the price
jumped 30 percent, the 10th straight annual gain.  “All eyes are on Egypt,” said  Frank McGhee , the head
dealer at Integrated Brokerage Services LLC in Chicago. “The
crisis turned the gold market, so gold hasn’t technically had a
correction. If it becomes a bloody revolution, gold will be seen
as a haven.”  Gold futures for April delivery rose $4.30, or 0.3 percent,
to $1,366.80 an ounce at 10:50 a.m. on the Comex. Earlier, the
price reached $1,369.70, the highest for a most-active contract
since Jan. 20.  Silver futures for March delivery climbed 6.6 cents, or 0.2
percent, to $30.16 an ounce.  Palladium futures for March delivery fell $1.60, or 0.2
percent, to $819.30 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  Platinum futures for April delivery dropped $2.20, or 0.1
percent, to $1,828.60 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
