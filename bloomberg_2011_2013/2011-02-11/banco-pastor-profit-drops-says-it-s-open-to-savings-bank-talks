  Banco Pastor SA , whose origins date
back to 1776, sees a chance to acquire savings banks as  Spain ’s
banking system restructures, said Deputy General Manager Susana
Quintas.  “We are about to see a once in a lifetime opportunity so
we are considering it very seriously,” Quintas said in a
Bloomberg Television interview today when asked if Pastor might
be interested in acquiring savings banks, known as cajas. She
couldn’t specify which lenders it might be interested in buying
because “you have to kiss many frogs before you find your
handsome prince.”  Spanish lenders are under pressure to bolster their
financial strength after the government said it would require
listed companies to have core capital of at least 8 percent, and
10 percent if they don’t have private shareholders and rely on
wholesale funding. Pastor last week announced a growth plan in
which it will seek to double profits and increase its core
capital ratio to 9.8 percent in 2013 from 8.46 percent in
December.  Quintas said in the interview that pressure on net interest
income remains the bank’s main concern. Even so, competition
among banks to offer aggressive returns on deposits is easing,
she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
