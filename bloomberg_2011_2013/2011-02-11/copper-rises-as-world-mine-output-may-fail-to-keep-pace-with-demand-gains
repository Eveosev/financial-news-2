Copper erased gains on renewed
concern that  China , the world’s largest user, will step up
measures to combat asset-price gains after raising borrowing
costs this week for the third time in four months.  Three-month copper on the  London  Metal Exchange fell as
much as 0.2 percent to $9,911 a metric ton and was at $9,922 at
3:02 p.m. in  Singapore , extending this week’s loss. The metal,
which ended last week at $10,050 a ton, reached a record $10,160
a ton on Feb. 7. Contracts in Shanghai and  New York  also fell.  China’s central bank imposed differentiated reserve
requirement ratios on some of the nation’s small and medium-
sized lenders after the Lunar New Year holiday that ended Feb.
8, the official China Securities Journal reported today, citing
an unidentified person.  “There is talk that the reserve ratio for all commercial
banks will be raised this evening, and that’s weighing on
sentiment,” Cheng Xiaoyong, an analyst at Baocheng Futures Co.,
said from Zhejiang.  May-delivery metal on the  Shanghai  Futures Exchange, which
re-opened on Feb. 9 after the Lunar New Year break, dropped as
much as 0.6 percent to 75,400 yuan ($11,433) a ton, erasing an
earlier gain of 0.9 percent. Futures in New York lost as much as
0.5 percent to $4.52 a pound after climbing 0.8 percent earlier.  Copper in London has declined 1.2 percent this week after
the People’s Bank of China raised the one-year lending rate by a
quarter point and the one-year deposit rate an equivalent amount
on Feb. 8, ahead of a report next week that economists say may
show inflation accelerated to the fastest in 30 months.  Sentiment Affected  “The impact is really on  market sentiment  rather than
having any real effect on combating inflation,” Li Rong, chief
analyst at Great Wall Futures Co., said from Shanghai.  Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak  defied growing calls for
his resignation, raising concerns about escalating geopolitical
tension in the Middle East.  “These latest developments in  Egypt  will be negative for
sentiment in the market,” Kelvin Tay, Singapore-based chief
investment strategist at UBS Wealth Management, said on
Bloomberg Television. “Sentiment in the Asia-Pacific market has
not been positive.”  Tin climbed as much as 1 percent to a record $31,800 a ton,
surpassing the previous peak of $31,650 reached on Feb. 8,
before dropping 0.3 percent to $31,400. Output of refined tin by
PT Timah,  Indonesia ’s largest producer, was 40,413 tons last
year, down from 45,086 tons in 2009, the company said Feb. 7.  Tin was the LME’s best performer last year, jumping 59
percent as supplies from Indonesia, China and the Democratic
Republic Congo dwindled. China is the world’s largest producer
and Indonesia the largest exporter.  Aluminum and lead in London were little changed at $2,535 a
ton and $2,507 a ton respectively. Zinc fell 0.4 percent to
$2,440 a ton, while nickel rose 0.5 percent to $27,980 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
