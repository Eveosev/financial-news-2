Turkish President Abdullah Gul will
travel to  Iran  on Feb. 13 with a delegation of more than 100
businesspeople seeking trade opportunities, the state-run
Anatolia news agency reported.  The delegation will meet with Iranian business leaders in
the cities of Tehran, Isfahan and Tabriz, Anatolia said. On Feb.
14, Gul and Iranian President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  will speak at
a Turkish-Iranian business forum, it said.  Turkey and Iran are experiencing “a golden age” in trade
relations, partly because United Nations and U.S. sanctions are
driving more business to Iran through Turkey, said Riza Amuzgar,
head of the Turkish-Iranian council at Turkey’s Foreign Economic
Relations Board, according to Anatolia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
