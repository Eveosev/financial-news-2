  Telekom Malaysia Bhd ., a state-
controlled telecommunications provider, signed an agreement with
Indonesia’s PT XL Axiata and PT Mora Telematika to jointly build
a 400-kilometer submarine cable system between the two countries.  Telekom Malaysia is investing $4 million in the project,
which is expected to start operations by the fourth quarter of
this year, Executive Vice President Rozaimy Rahman told
reporters after the signing ceremony in  Kuala Lumpur  today.  “The design of this cable system has taken into
consideration current and future high capacity requirements for
next generation Internet applications,” he said.  Telekom Malaysia shares fell 0.5 percent to 3.86 ringgit in
Kuala Lumpur trading at 4:52 p.m. local time. XL Axiata is the
Indonesian unit of  Axiata Group Bhd ., Malaysia’s second-biggest
mobile-phone operator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
