The following is the text of
the U.S. trade balance report for Dec. released by the
Commerce Department.  Goods and Services  The U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Bureau of Economic
Analysis, through the  Department of Commerce , announced
today that total December exports of $163.0 billion and
imports of $203.5 billion resulted in a goods and services
deficit of $40.6 billion, up from $38.3 billion in
November, revised.  December exports were $2.8 billion
more than November exports of $160.1 billion.  December
imports were $5.1 billion more than November imports of
$198.5 billion.  In December, the goods deficit increased $2.3 billion from
November to $53.6 billion, and the services surplus was
virtually unchanged at $13.0 billion.  Exports of goods
increased $2.8 billion to $116.6 billion, and imports of
goods increased $5.1 billion to $170.1 billion.  Exports
of services were virtually unchanged at $46.4 billion, and
imports of services were virtually unchanged at $33.4
billion.  The goods and services deficit increased $3.5 billion from
December 2009 to December 2010.  Exports were up $19.6
billion, or 13.7 percent, and imports were up $23.1
billion, or 12.8 percent.  Goods (Census basis)  The November to December increase in exports of goods
reflected increases in capital goods ($1.5 billion);
industrial supplies and materials ($1.1 billion);
automotive vehicles, parts, and engines ($0.6 billion);
and other goods ($0.2 billion).  A decrease occurred in  consumer goods  ($0.3 billion).
Foods, feeds, and beverages were virtually unchanged.  The November to December increase in imports of goods

($5.2 billion); other goods ($0.3 billion); foods, feeds,
and beverages ($0.2 billion); and automotive vehicles,
parts, and engines ($0.1 billion).  Decreases occurred in
capital goods ($0.5 billion) and consumer goods ($0.4
billion).  The December 2009 to December 2010 increase in exports of
goods reflected increases in industrial supplies and

($1.5 billion); automotive vehicles, parts, and engines
($0.9 billion); and other goods ($0.8 billion).  The December 2009 to December 2010 increase in imports of

consumer goods ($3.7 billion); automotive vehicles, parts,
and engines ($2.0 billion); foods, feeds, and beverages
($1.1 billion); and other goods ($0.3 billion).  Services  Services exports were virtually unchanged from November to
December.  A decrease in travel was largely offset by an
increase in other private services (which includes items
such as business, professional, and technical services,
insurance services, and financial services).  Changes in
the other categories of services exports were small.  Services imports were virtually unchanged from November to
December.  Changes in all categories of services imports
were small and mostly offsetting.  The December 2009 to December 2010 increase in exports of
services was $2.7 billion.  The largest increases were in
other private services ($0.8 billion), travel ($0.8
billion), and passenger fares ($0.5 billion).  Within
other private services, the largest increase was in
business, professional, and technical services.  The December 2009 to December 2010 increase in imports of
services was $1.7 billion.  The largest increases were in
other private services ($0.6 billion), other
transportation ($0.5 billion), which includes freight and
port services, and travel ($0.3 billion).  Within other
private services, the largest increase was in business,
professional, and technical services.  Goods and Services Moving Average  For the three months ending in December, exports of goods
and services averaged $160.6 billion, while imports of
goods and services averaged $199.6 billion, resulting in
an average trade deficit of $39.1 billion.  For the three
months ending in November, the average trade deficit was
$40.4 billion, reflecting average exports of $157.6
billion and average imports of $197.9 billion.  Selected Not Seasonally Adjusted Goods Details  The December figures show surpluses, in billions of
dollars, with Hong Kong $2.2 ($1.9 for November),
Singapore $1.3 ($0.5), Australia $1.2 ($1.2), and Egypt

unchanged at $0.1 billion (0.1 percent).  For November,
revised import carry-over was $0.1 billion (0.1 percent),
revised down from $0.6 billion (0.3 percent).  The seasonally adjusted goods data for January through
November were revised to align the seasonally adjusted
months with the annual totals.  Services exports for November were revised up $0.3 billion
to $46.4 billion.  The revision was mostly accounted for
by an upward revision to travel.  Services imports for
November were revised up $0.1 billion to $33.4 billion.
The revision was mostly accounted for by upward revisions
to travel and passenger fares.  SOURCE: U.S. Commerce Department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
