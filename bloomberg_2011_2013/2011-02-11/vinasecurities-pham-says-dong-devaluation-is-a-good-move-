Alan T. Pham, chief economist at
VinaSecurities Joint-Stock Co., a brokerage unit of  Vietnam ’s
biggest fund manager, comments on the country’s currency
devaluation. Pham spoke by phone from the U.S.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam devalued the dong by about 7
percent today, the most since at least 1993, seeking to curb the
nation’s trade deficit and cut into the gap between the official
and black-market exchange rates for the currency.  “The move should be no surprise because of the government
statement in December that they would devalue the currency after
Tet.  “However, I was a little bit surprised by the amount of
the devaluation. In terms of timing, I think it is now quite
reasonable to take this move because it was already widely
expected.  “This is also a good move to keep the currency stable for
quite some time and I think the currency now will be stable
because both monetary and fiscal policies have been kept tight.  “The central bank now is adopting a crawling peg policy --
a technical economic name for managing the foreign-exchange rate
in a very flexible manner in respond to market conditions. It
means that the market and investors can expect more frequent,
more flexible currency-adjustment policies.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
