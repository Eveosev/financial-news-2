Nigeria’s  third-biggest opposition
party said it was backing President  Goodluck Jonathan , the
candidate of the ruling People’s  Democratic Party , in an April
election.  “His candidature will unite the country and guarantee
peace in the Niger Delta where Nigeria derives most of its
revenue,” Victor Umeh, national chairman of the All Progressive
Grand Alliance, said by phone today from the city of Awka in the
southeast where the party has the bulk of its support.  Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation and the continent’s
biggest oil producer, will hold a presidential election on April
9. Jonathan will run against Muhammadu Buhari, a northern Muslim
and former military ruler who is the candidate for the Congress
for Progressive Change, and Nuhu Ribadu, ex-anti-graft boss and
candidate of the Action Congress of  Nigeria .  The All Progressive Grand Alliance was founded by
Chukwuemeka Ojukwu who led the attempted secession of the oil-
rich southeastern region known as Biafra that sparked the 1967-
70 Nigerian civil war.  To contact the reporter on this story:
