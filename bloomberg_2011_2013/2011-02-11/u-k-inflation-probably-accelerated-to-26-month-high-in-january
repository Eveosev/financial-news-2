U.K. inflation probably accelerated
in January to the fastest since November 2008 as oil, food, and
other commodity costs rose and the government increased  sales
tax  to control a record deficit.  Consumer prices probably rose 4 percent from a year earlier
after gaining 3.7 percent in December, according to the median
forecast of 30 economists in a Bloomberg survey. The Office for
National Statistics in  London  will publish the data at 9:30 a.m.
on Feb. 15.  The surge will sharpen Bank of England policy makers’
dilemma as they face a 14-month bout of inflation above their 2
percent target while the biggest fiscal squeeze since World War
II takes hold. The bank left its key interest rate at a record
low of 0.5 percent yesterday and its bond-purchase plan at 200
billion pounds ($320 billion). Governor  Mervyn King  will present
new quarterly economic forecasts Feb. 16.  “The bank is between being pushed to hiking rates to
contain inflation, which may be temporary, and keeping rates
where they are to avoid impairing the economic recovery,” Fabio Fois, an economist at  Barclays Capital  in London, said in an
interview before the report. “For the time being they’ll try to
keep rates where they are, giving more weight to the recovery.
We see the first increase in November.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
