Senator Barbara Mikulski, a  Maryland  Democrat, asked federal regulators to investigate
Potomac Electric Power Co. for storm-related power interruptions
that affected thousands of customers in January.  Mikulski wrote to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
Chairman Jon Wellinghoff, seeking an investigation into whether
Pepco failed to comply with national standards for electric
reliability before the winter storms.  “I urge FERC to use all at its disposal to understand the
consistently unreliable service at Pepco, and take all
appropriate action to remediate it,” Mikulski wrote in the Feb.
4 letter. She also asked the Senate Energy and Natural Resources
Committee to hold hearings to determine how to improve electric
reliability.  FERC has authority to fine companies as much as $1 million
a day for failing to meet standards set by the North American
Electric Reliability Corp. Wellinghoff hasn’t responded to
Mikulski’s request, an agency spokeswoman said.  Pepco, a subsidiary of  Pepco Holdings Inc ., serves 778,000
customers in  Washington , D.C., and Maryland. A late January
snowstorm knocked out power for more than 200,000 customers. The
Maryland Public Service Commission in August began investigating
reliability issues at Pepco.  “Pepco welcomes the active involvement of Senator Mikulski
and other policy makers in helping establish a better system of
standards that will help all of us provide a more effective
level of reliable electric service at a reasonable cost,” said
Clay Anderson, a company spokesman.  #<235553.637876.2.1.77.31389.96>#
