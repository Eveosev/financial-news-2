  Brazil ’s government is considering a
way to cut a federal tax on payrolls without reducing tax
receipts, Brasil Economico reported, without saying where it
obtained the information.  To compensate for the loss in revenue, the government is
considering an increase in a federal  sales tax , the Sao Paulo-
based newspaper reported. A second alternative under study is to
reinstate a tax on financial operations, known as CPMF, Brasil
Economico said.  The  Finance Ministry ’s press office didn’t immediately
respond to a call by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporters on this story:
