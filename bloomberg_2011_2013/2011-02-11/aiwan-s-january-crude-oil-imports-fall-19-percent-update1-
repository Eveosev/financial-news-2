  Taiwan , which imports more than 99
percent of its crude oil needs, reduced purchases of the fuel in
January after a refiner shut plants for scheduled maintenance.  Shipments fell 19 percent from a year earlier to 25.3
million barrels, the  Ministry of Finance  said in Taipei today.
The island’s January crude oil bill dropped 4.4 percent to $2.3
billion, the ministry said in a statement.  CPC Corp. , Taiwan’s state-owned oil company, shut its No.
11 crude distillation unit at Talin refinery from Nov. 20 to Jan.
7 and its No. 1 crude unit at Taoyuan from Nov. 26 to Jan. 11
for maintenance, according to Vice President Paul Chen. The
plants heat the fuel and separate it into oil products.  To contact the reporters on this story:
