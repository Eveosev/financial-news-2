Malawi is suffering from a fuel
shortage because the country doesn’t have enough foreign
currency to pay importers, Finance Minister Ken Kandodo said.  “The situation is pathetic,” Kandodo said in parliament
in the capital, Lilongwe, yesterday. “We have inconvenienced
the public and the economy is affected.”  Importers are demanding cash payments because Petroleum
Importers Ltd. hasn’t repaid all debts from deliveries made on
credit, Grain Malunga, the minister of energy, said on Capital
Radio yesterday.  The southern African nation’s yearlong fuel shortage has
worsened, with motorists being forced to buy gasoline on the
black market for 700 kwacha ($4.64) a liter, more than double
the official price, the Nation newspaper reported yesterday. The
government plans to establish a national  oil company  to manage
oil stocks.  The fuel crisis was exacerbated by structural reforms
recommended by the international monetary agencies that
commercial banks give out foreign currency and not the central
bank, Malunga said.  “Commercial banks are not prioritizing the importation of
fuel,” he said.  Earnings from tobacco sales should be deposited at the
central bank and not at commercial banks, Kandodo said. Malawi’s
annual fuel bill is $300 million, Kandodo said.  Malawi earns 60 percent of its foreign exchange from
tobacco sales, which generated $410.6 million last year,
according to the Tobacco Control Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
