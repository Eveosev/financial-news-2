  Warner Chilcott Plc  put-option
trades surged to a three-month high in the U.S. with the most-
active contracts having a strike price 2.6 percent below today’s
close.  Almost 7,000 puts to sell the maker of birth-control pills
changed hands today, 29 times the four-week average and more
than four times the number of calls to buy. The most-traded
contracts were the February $23 puts, which will expire next
week. They accounted for almost nine-tenths of all put volume
and jumped 57 percent to 55 cents. The Ardee, Ireland-based
drugmaker gained 1.2 percent to $23.62.  The February $23 puts traded 5,970 times, almost triple the
open interest of 2,371 before today. Today’s total volume of
8,527 contracts is almost half of the 18,858 outstanding options
before today.  The company has rallied 24 percent from its 15-month low in
November, three times more than the 7.8 percent increase for
health-care companies in the Russell 1000 Index.  Warner Chilcott’s implied volatility, the key gauge of
option prices, for at-the-money options expiring in 30 days
jumped to 43.47 from 35.66 yesterday.  Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the
right to sell. Investors use options to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities they own, speculate on
share-price moves or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will
rise or fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
