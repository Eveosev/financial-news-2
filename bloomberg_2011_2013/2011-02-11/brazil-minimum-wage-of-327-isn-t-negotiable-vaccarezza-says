Congressional allies of  Brazil ’s
President Dilma Rousseff won’t negotiate a monthly minimum wage
that exceeds 545 reais ($327), said Candido Vaccarezza, the
government’s leader in the lower house.  “There is no room for an agreement that exceeds 545
reais,” Vaccarezza said in a telephone interview from  Sao
Paulo . Lawmakers in the ruling coalition who “vote against the
proposal will be considered dissidents.”  Estado de S.Paulo newspaper reported today that the
government was willing to approve a minimum wage of as much as
560 reais if its congressional allies don’t back the 545-real
proposal. The lower house is scheduled to vote Feb. 16.  Government spending increases by 286.4 million reais for
every one-real increase in the  minimum wage , according to the
Budget Ministry. The Rousseff administration’s 2011 budget,
which was slashed by 50 billion reais earlier this week, assumes
a wage of 545 reais.  “How could we cut 50 billion reais and agree to a higher
minimum wage?” Vaccarezza said. “It makes no sense.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
