$85.58 a barrel on the Nymex, the lowest closing price since

record high based on settlement prices.  Gasoline  Gasoline for March delivery dropped 0.46 cent to $2.4652 a
gallon on the Nymex as higher temperatures were projected for
much of the U.S. from Feb. 16 to Feb. 24. The March gasoline

percent, to settle at $2.6958 on the Nymex. The heating oil
