A majority of Danes would vote
against joining  Europe ’s single currency bloc if a referendum
were held tomorrow, Berlingske Tidende reported, citing a Gallup
Denmark poll.  Fifty percent of respondents said they would reject euro
adoption, compared with 41 percent in favor of the currency
switch, the poll showed. Nine percent answered they either
wouldn’t vote or were unsure, Berlingske said.  The poll indicates Danish opposition to joining the currency
bloc is the greatest in almost 15 years, according to
Berlingske. Danes last voted against euro membership in 2000.
The central bank uses monetary policy to maintain the krone’s
peg to the euro in a 2.25 percent band.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
