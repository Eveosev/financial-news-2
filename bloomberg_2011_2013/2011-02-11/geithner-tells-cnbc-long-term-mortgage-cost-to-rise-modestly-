U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said the cost of a mortgage to Americans will “rise
modestly” and the government should play a “targeted role” to
facilitate home-buying.  “Over the long run, the cost of a mortgage will rise
modestly for the average American homeowner,” Geithner told
CNBC in a segment broadcast today. “We think it’s very
important for the government to continue to play a role, a
targeted role” to ensure that “Americans that need help to
find a home, to rent a home, or own a home get that help.”  Geithner today presented Congress with a set of options for
weaning the $11 trillion mortgage market from its dependence on
the government, while calling for changes to be phased in
“responsibly and carefully” to avoid economic disruptions.  The report delivered by Geithner and Housing and Urban
Development Secretary Shaun Donovan presents three approaches
for a future housing finance system. It also calls the
government to shrink “and ultimately wind down”  Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac , the bailed-out government-sponsored enterprise
companies that helped fuel the housing bubble before being
felled by investments in subprime mortgages.  Geithner told CNBC he wants “the private market to play
the dominant role, and this is going to take time.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
