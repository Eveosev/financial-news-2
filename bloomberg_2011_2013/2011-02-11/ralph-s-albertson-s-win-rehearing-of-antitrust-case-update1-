  Safeway Inc .,  Supervalu Inc .’s
Albertson’s and  Kroger Co .’s Ralph’s supermarket chains won
rehearing of a U.S. appellate court ruling that their 2003
accord to share profits during strikes violated antitrust law.  A three-judge panel of a federal appeals court in San
Francisco in August overturned a lower court ruling that the
agreement, reached during a conflict with the companies’ unions,
didn’t violate antitrust law.  A larger panel of judges will rehear the case, the court
said in an order today that didn’t give a reason. The
supermarket companies had argued that the agreement, which
called for sharing profits if any of the three were singled out
for a strike, wasn’t anticompetitive because it lowered prices
for consumers by reducing labor costs.  California sued the three grocers in 2004, saying the so-
called mutual strike assistance agreement violated federal
antitrust laws and led to higher prices. A 141-day strike and
lockout at the companies’ Southern  California  stores was the
longest in the industry’s history and was mainly over proposals
requiring workers to share health-care costs and establish a
two-tier pay system.  The case is State of California v. Safeway, 08-55671, 9th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals (San Francisco).  To contact the reporter on this story:
