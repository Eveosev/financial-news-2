Turkish bonds and stocks gained on
bets that an increase by the industry regulator in provisions
for banks’ non-performing loans may mean the central bank won’t
hike reserve requirements for the third time and cause banks to
raise funds by selling bonds.  Bonds strengthened for the first week in five, with yields
on benchmark two-year lira debt falling 13 basis points to 8.37
percent at 6 p.m. in Istanbul. The main  ISE National 100 index 
of shares rose 308.82, or 0.5 percent, to 64,730.35, curbing
this week’s losses to 0.9 percent. Banks including Turkiye
Garanti Bankasi AS led gains.  Turkey’s banking regulator said today that it will end an
exemption on provisioning for non-performing loans introduced in
2009. The exemption will end on March 1, the Ankara-based
regulator said in a statement on its website.  The step by the watchdog probably means the central bank
won’t increase reserve requirements for the third time since the
start of December after its Monetary Policy Committee meets on
Feb. 15, Fatih Keresteci, a strategist at HSBC Holdings Plc in
Istanbul, said in a telephone interview today.  The banking index of shares has dropped 19 percent since
reaching a record high on Nov. 9, partly on concern the reserve
requirement hikes will hurt profits. Turkish bond yields have
risen as much as 165 basis points from a record low of 6.9
percent on Jan. 5.  Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS climbed 4 kurus, or 0.6 percent,
to 7.32 liras. Turkiye Is Bankasi AS, the biggest listed bank,
increased 4 kurus, or 0.8 percent, to 5.22 liras.  The lira gained 0.5 percent to 1.5845 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
