Turkey’s benchmark  ISE National 100
Index  fell for a second day, dropping 344.82, or 0.5 percent, to
64,076.71 at the 12:30 p.m. break in trading in Istanbul.  The following stocks were active. Symbols are in
parentheses.    Akbank TAS  (AKBNK TI), the Turkish lender part owned by
Citigroup Inc., dropped 16 kurus, or 2 percent, to 7.70 liras
before reporting earnings during the mid-day break of 2.86
billion liras ($1.8 billion) in 2010, missing the 2.97 billion-
lira average estimate of 24 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.    Turk Ekonomi Bankasi AS  (TEBNK TI), dropped 8 kurus, or 4
percent, to 1.94 liras after reporting earnings rose 43 percent
to 300.3 million liras in 2010. The bank’s results are “not
strong,” Alpay Dinckoc, an analyst with Oyak Securities, said
in a telephone interview. Most of the bank’s 2010 profit growth
came in the form of a 180 million lira start-up fee for
insurance business with Zurich Insurance AS, Dinckoc said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
