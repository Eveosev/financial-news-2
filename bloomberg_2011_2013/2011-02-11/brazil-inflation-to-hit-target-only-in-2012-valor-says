Brazilian government economists
forecast inflation may exceed the upper end of the country’s
target range in the first half of the year and will slow to the
4.5 percent midpoint of the target goal in 2012, Valor Economico
said, without identifying where it obtained the information.  Officials estimate that a 50 billion reais ($29.9 billion)
cut to the 2011 budget announced Feb. 9 is equivalent to
increasing the benchmark interest rate by about 100 basis
points, or one percentage point, the Sao Paulo-based newspaper
reported.  The government targets inflation of 4.5 percent, plus or
minus two-percentage-points to accommodate price shocks.  The  Finance Ministry ’s press office didn’t immediately
respond to a call by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporters on this story:
