  Corning Inc . put-option trades
jumped to a three-month high after a single bet that profits if
shares of the world’s biggest maker of glass for flat-panel
televisions fall at least 1.3 percent by August.  An investor bought 28,000 August $22 puts and sold the same
number of August $18 puts, a strategy known as a “spread,”
according to Trade Alert LLC, a New York-based provider of
options-market analytics.  More than 74,000 puts to sell the stock changed hands
today, almost eight times the four-week average and more than
five times the number of calls to buy. The most-traded contracts
were the August $18 puts, which accounted for more than a third
of all put volume and fell 8.8 percent to 52 cents. The Corning,
New York-based company rose 0.9 percent to $22.36.  “Today’s option activity suggests at least one investor is
looking to protect a long equity position into the summer months
or a bet that the shares will drift back to their pre-earnings
level over the next 6 months,” said  Patrick Mortimer , director
of options trading at Pipeline Trading Systems LLC in  New Hope ,  Pennsylvania .  Corning gained 8 percent to $21.21 Jan. 25 after reporting
fourth-quarter profit of 46 cents a share excluding some items.
The company is up 16 percent this year, compared with a 7.8 gain
for information technology companies in the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index.  Corning’s implied volatility, the key gauge of option
prices, for at-the-money options expiring in 30 days rose to
29.10 from its one-month low of 24.34 in January.  Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the
right to sell. Investors use options to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities they own, speculate on
share-price moves or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will
rise or fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
