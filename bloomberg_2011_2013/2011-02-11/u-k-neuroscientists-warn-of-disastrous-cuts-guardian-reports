Cuts in U.K. government funding for
neuroscience research, together with pharmaceutical companies’
declining interest, will have a serious effect on British
efforts in a key field, according to more than 80 academic
scientists, the Guardian reported.  The government-funded Biotechnology and Biological Sciences
Research Council is cutting support for neuroscience on the
ground that it has attracted too great a proportion of funding,
the newspaper said.  In a letter to the council, the scientists urged that the
cuts be reconsidered; Colin Blakemore, a professor of
neuroscience at Oxford University, said “one of the most
successful areas of science in Britain” is being “demonised”
because of that very success, the Guardian reported.   David Nutt, a professor of neuropsychopharmacology at  Imperial College London , said “virtually no neuroscience is
being done by pharmaceutical companies in Britain,” the
newspaper reported.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
