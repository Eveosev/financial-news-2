  R.J. Reynolds  Tobacco Co. must pay
$260,000 in damages to a Florida man who said he developed
cancer and emphysema from smoking, a jury decided after a trial
that started with his lawyer asking for $10 billion.  Six jurors in state court in Tampa, Florida, deliberated
for less than two hours today before awarding $250,000 in
punitive damages to Leroy Kirkland, 71, who said he became ill
after decades of smoking Pall Mall and Salem cigarettes made by
R.J. Reynolds, a unit of Winston-Salem, North Carolina-based  Reynolds American Inc .  The same jury yesterday decided the case in Kirkland’s
favor and concluded he had suffered $100,000 in damages. Jurors
found him 90 percent responsible for his illnesses, reducing the
compensatory damage award to $10,000.  “It could have been and should have been more,”
Kirkland’s lawyer, Willie Gary, said after the jury announced
its punitive-damage verdict. “But this is my first tobacco
trial.”  In his opening statement Jan. 27, Gary said he would prove
Kirkland was due more than $10 billion in punitive damages,
which is more than half the market capitalization of Reynolds
American.  Gary, who won a $500 million verdict against a funeral-home
chain in a contract dispute and $240 million over claims that
Walt Disney Co. stole his clients’ theme-park idea, said he has
500 tobacco clients.  ‘Personal Responsibility’  “The jury might have been troubled by the industry’s
conduct, but they showed that they did believe in personal
responsibility,” said Stephen Kaczynski, a lawyer for Reynolds.  Kaczynski said no decision had been made whether to appeal
the decision.  The suit by Kirkland is one of more than 8,000 individual
claims by smokers filed in state and federal courts throughout
Florida after the state’s supreme court in 2006 threw out a $145
billion punitive-damage verdict against the industry and ended a
class action filed on behalf of  Florida  smokers.  So far, smokers have won 22 of 33 verdicts in these
“Engle” cases -- named after  Howard Engle , the lead plaintiff
in the unsuccessful class action, according to Edward L. Sweda Jr., senior attorney for the Tobacco Products Liability Project,
which tracks the suits.  The case is In re Engle Progeny Cases Tobacco Litigation,
08-CA-673, Florida Circuit Court, Hillsborough County (Tampa).  To contact the reporters on this story:
