  Kenya ’s plan to sell five state-
owned sugar mills may be delayed until next year because of a
crowded legislative schedule, the  Daily Nation  reported, citing
Saulo Busolo, chairman of the country’s sugar board.  The parliamentary calendar is full with issues relating to
a new Constitution, the Nairobi-based newspaper cited Busolo as
saying. Lawmakers are required to approve the sale plan.  The Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, or
Comesa, gave Kenya protection against conditions of a free trade
agreement for privatization until February 2012, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
