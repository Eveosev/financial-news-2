  Boliden AB , Scandinavia’s only
copper producer, said fourth-quarter profit rose 72 percent as
surging global demand for commodities pushed up prices.  Net income climbed to 1.41 billion kronor ($217 million)
from 821 million kronor a year earlier, Stockholm-based Boliden
said today in a statement. That beat the 1.31 billion-krona
average estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The
company declared a 5-krona dividend, 35 percent of 2010 profit.  Copper for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange increased 29 percent in the quarter from a year earlier
to an average $8,614 a metric ton. Boliden said Jan. 18 it will
invest 3.9 billion kronor to raise zinc-ore output by 79 percent
at its Garpenberg mine in Dalarna,  Sweden .  Boliden plans to spend 1.3 billion kronor to increase its
output from electronics scrap to 120,000 tons from 45,000 tons,
Chief Executive Officer Lennart Evrell said on a conference call
today. It plans to invest between 4 billion and 5 billion kronor
this year, Chief Financial Officer Johan Fant said on the call.  Copper producers have benefited as demand for the metal,
particularly from  China , boosts prices. Xstrata Plc, whose
copper output is the largest contributor to its earnings, posted
an 86 percent jump in annual net income on Feb. 8, while  India ’s  Hindustan Copper Ltd . said third-quarter profit rose 69 percent.  Boliden’s mined copper output soared 88 percent to 21,367
tons in the quarter after the company added capacity at the
Aitik mine. Production of the finished metal declined 1 percent
to 85,323 tons at its smelters.  Overall sales advanced 21 percent to 10.1 billion kronor.  Costs Rise  Operating costs increased after Boliden booked a one-time
provision of 85 million kronor as it raised production, and
about 50 million kronor related to the expansion of the Aitik
mine, the company said. Depreciation climbed by 281 million
kronor because of Aitik’s new facility, it said. The company’s
2010 operating costs rose to 11.64 billion kronor from 10.10
billion kronor a year earlier, CFO Fant said.  Boliden shares gained 0.4 percent to 136.10 kronor by the
5:30 p.m. close in  Stockholm .  The company mined 79,900 tons of zinc in concentrate, up 8
percent, after commissioning a new open-pit mine and raising
production capacity in the Boliden area of Sweden’s Vasterbotten
county. Zinc metal output was 117,494 tons, up 1 percent,
according to the statement.  Boliden posted a gain of 501 million kronor from currency
hedging in 2010 and said debt was 4.6 million kronor, pushing
its debt-to-equity ratio down to 24 percent by the end of the
fourth quarter from 46 percent a year earlier.  Net income for the year surged 58 percent to 3.96 billion
kronor, according to the statement. Annual sales rose 33 percent
