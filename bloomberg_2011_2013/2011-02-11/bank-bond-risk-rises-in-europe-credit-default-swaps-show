The cost of insuring against losses
on European bank bonds rose, according to traders of credit-
default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to the senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers rose 3 basis points to 166, and the
subordinated index was up 6 at 279, according to JPMorgan Chase
& Co. at 8:30 a.m. in London. An increase signals deterioration
in perceptions of  credit quality .  The cost of protecting corporate bonds from default also
rose, with the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50 companies
with mostly high-yield credit ratings 3 basis points higher at
404. The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings was up 1.25 basis points at 98.75,
JPMorgan prices show.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.6 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
