Rates to haul coal,  iron ore  and
other dry-bulk commodities may be set to rebound as activity
quickens after a weeklong holiday in  China , Deutsche Bank AG
said.  The Baltic Dry Index of commodity-shipping costs gained 13
percent this week, the most since August, to 1,178 points after
sliding on Feb. 4 to the lowest level since January 2009. It’s
still down 34 percent this year.  Financial markets in China, the world’s biggest consumer of
iron ore for steelmaking, were shut through Feb. 8 for the Lunar
New Year holiday. Shipping rates also slid this year as the
worst floods for half a century in the Australian state of
Queensland, which supplies about half the world’s seaborne
market for coal to make steel, closed mines and rail links.  “We believe a window has appeared that will push freight
rates higher over the next six months,” London-based Deutsche
Bank analyst  Michael Lewis  wrote in the report, dated today. The
bank remains “cautious” over a 12-month horizon, estimating
that the fleet will expand by 16 percent this year as demand
climbs 7.6 percent, he said.  Companies ordered too many ships in 2007 and 2008, when the
Baltic Dry Index averaged 6,730 points. That fell to 2,687
points over the next two years, according to the  Baltic
Exchange , which publishes assessments for more than 50 maritime
routes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
