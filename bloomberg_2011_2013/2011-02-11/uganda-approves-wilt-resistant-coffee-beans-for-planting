  Uganda  approved planting of seven
strains of the robusta bean that are resistant to coffee-wilt,
the country’s Coffee Development Authority said.  Sixteen independent farmers are joining the Kawanda
Research Institute in producing the beans, the authority said
today in an e-mail from the capital, Kampala. It didn’t give its
planting targets for the new strains.  Coffee wilt disease, a fungus that predominantly affects
the robusta variety, was first detected in Uganda in 1993 and
has destroyed about 150 million trees, according to the
authority, which oversees the industry. Most were replaced
through a replanting program that started in 1994, authority
spokesman David Kiwanuka said today by phone.  The disease cost Uganda an estimated $500 million over the
past 10 years, according to the website of  CABI International , a
not-for-profit development organization. Output by smallholders
in the East African country has halved because of the fungus,
the Wallingford, England-based group said.  Uganda is  Africa ’s biggest producer of robusta beans, with
the variety accounting for 85 percent of total exports.
Ugandan coffee production dropped to 2.7 million 60-kilogram
(132-pound) bags last season, from more than 4 million bags in
1996-97, partly due to the effects of the disease, according to
the development authority. Uganda’s replanting program aims to
boost production to 4.5 million bags by 2015, the UCDA has said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
