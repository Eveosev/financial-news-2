  Turkey ’s current-account deficit
widened in December from a year earlier, posting a record
shortfall for the second month in a row, the central bank said.  The deficit rose to $7.5 billion from $3.2 billion in the
same month of 2009, the central bank in Ankara said on its
website today. It was the widest gap since 1984 when the bank’s
data series began and exceeded the median estimate of $7 billion
in a Bloomberg survey of nine economists.  The shortfall is expanding as a growing economy pulls in
imported goods, fuel and raw materials. At the same time,
European demand for Turkish-made goods such as cars and washing
machines is weak. The central bank has increased the money banks
must set aside against consumer loans in the past two months to
rein in demand and slow the widening of the deficit.  “This is a very large number but it’s almost two months
old, and at least the central bank saw this coming and has
acted,” Ozan Gaziturk, an economist at Sekerbank AS in
Istanbul, said by phone. “The bank has essentially been trying
to reduce the current-account gap since December.”  The deficit for the whole of 2010 was $48.6 billion, or
about 7 percent of estimated gross domestic product. The
government’s medium-term plans forecast a gap of $39.3 billion
and predict a deficit of 5.4 percent of GDP this year.  Foreign Investment  The economy probably expanded 8 percent last year, Finance
Minister  Mehmet Simsek  said yesterday in  Abu Dhabi .  Net foreign direct investment was $1.9 billion in December,
bringing the total for the year to $8.9 billion, compared with
$8.4 billion in 2009, the bank said today.  Foreign investors sold a net $785 million in Turkish shares
in December, it said. There was an inflow of $453 million into
Turkish lira-denominated bonds in the month.  The bank has combined increased reserve-requirement ratios
with cuts to the benchmark interest rate that have taken it to a
low of 6.25 percent. The lira has weakened 4.8 percent since the
first rate cut on Dec. 16, making imports more expensive. The
currency was 0.4 percent weaker at 1.5977 per dollar at 10:18
a.m. in Istanbul.  Exports rose 18 percent in December to $11.9 billion, while
imports surged 37 percent to $20.6 billion, the statistics
office said Jan. 28. Exports grew 23 percent in January,
according to preliminary figures from the Turkish Exporters’
Assembly.  To contact the reporters on this story:  Steve Bryant  in Ankara at
