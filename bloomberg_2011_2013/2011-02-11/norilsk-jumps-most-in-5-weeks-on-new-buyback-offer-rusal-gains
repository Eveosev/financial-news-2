OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel rallied the
most in five weeks in Moscow trading after the world’s biggest
nickel producer increased its offer to buy back shares from
United Co. Rusal in a bid to end an ownership feud.  Norilsk shares climbed as much as much as 5.3 percent, the
biggest intraday gain since Dec. 29, before trading 4.3 percent
higher at 7,145.45 rubles at 6:45 p.m. in Moscow. Rusal’s
depositary receipts added 3.8 percent to 501.49 rubles.  Norilsk offered $12.8 billion cash for 20 percent of its
shares, according to a statement on its website. The offer is
valid until 6 p.m. on March 4 in Moscow, the statement said.
Norilsk in December offered $12 billion for 25 percent.  One of Rusal’s Russian depositary receipts equals 10
ordinary shares traded in  Hong Kong .  To contact the reporter on this story:
