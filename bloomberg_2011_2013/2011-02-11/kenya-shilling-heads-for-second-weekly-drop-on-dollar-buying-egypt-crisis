  Kenya ’s shilling weakened, heading
for a second week of declines versus the dollar, as demand for
the U.S. currency from telecommunications and fuel-retail
companies increased and as  Egypt ’s political crisis intensified.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy depreciated
as much as 0.6 percent to 81.70 per dollar from a close of 81.20
yesterday and was 0.2 percent down at 81.35 by 12 p.m. in
Nairobi, extending its decline this week to 0.3 percent.  “The shilling weakened on demand from energy and
telecommunication businesses and is expected to trade within the
81.50-81.70 range due to the ongoing political crisis in Egypt
following the refusal by the president to step down as earlier
anticipated,” Dickson Magecha, dealer at Nairobi based Standard
Chartered Bank Ltd., said in a phone interview today.  Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak  defied calls for his
immediate resignation, agreeing only to delegate powers to his
deputy, as thousands crammed into central Cairo demanding an end
to his 30-year rule. Oil futures climbed as the north African
nation’s crisis stoked concern that unrest may curb oil flows
through Egypt’s Suez Canal and spread to other oil-producing
nations in the Middle East.  Egypt imports an estimated 24 percent of black tea from
Kenya, the world’s biggest exporter of the variety.  To contact the reporter on this story:
