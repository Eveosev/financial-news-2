Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak  and
his family have arrived in the resort town of  Sharm El-Sheikh  in
the Sinai Peninsula,  Al Arabiya  television and the Associated
Press reported today, without saying where they got the
information.  Mubarak left Cairo from a military airbase in the suburbs
and was accompanied by Lieutenant General Sami Hafez Enan, chief
of staff of the Egyptian Army, the Chinese news agency Xinhua
reported, citing an unidentified airport official.  Egyptians today vowed to hold their biggest demonstrations
so far during the crisis over the countryâ€™s leadership after
Mubarak went on national television to defy calls for his
immediate resignation. Mubarak, 82, reiterated his intention to
stay in office, while handing day-to-day powers to Vice
President  Omar Suleiman  in a bid to placate opponents who demand
an end to his 30-year rule.  To contact the reporter on this story:
