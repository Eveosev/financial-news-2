  Malaysia ’s ringgit completed a
weekly loss, snapping a two-week rally, on concern monetary
tightening in the region will damp economic growth, prompting
investors to cut holdings of emerging-market assets.  The currency retreated from a 13-year high as exchange data
showed global funds were net sellers of $2.6 billion of equities
in the five biggest markets outside Japan. The FTSE Bursa
Malaysia KLCI Index of shares has declined 2.3 percent, headed
for its biggest weekly slide since May 2010.  Government bonds 
advanced today, paring a weekly loss, after demand rose at an
auction.  “The market is concerned about the impact of policy
tightening in  China , with central banks in Southeast Asia likely
to follow suit,” said Akira Banno, a treasury adviser at Bank
of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur . “Fund
repatriation out of stock markets has been a stronger factor
affecting the ringgit.”  The ringgit dropped 0.3 percent to 3.0505 per dollar as of
4:06 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur from 3.04 on Feb. 2, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The ringgit reached 3.0290 on Feb. 4 in
London trading, the strongest level since October 1997.  China raised its deposit rate for a third time in four
months on Feb. 9 to counter inflation. Economists forecast
prices may have increased 5.4 percent last month from a year
earlier, versus 4.6 percent in December. China, including  Hong
Kong , is Malaysia’s biggest export market.  A government report showed yesterday factory output in  Southeast Asia ’s third-largest economy rose 4.2 percent in
December from a year earlier, versus 5.4 percent in November.
Economists had forecast a 5.0 percent gain.  Bond Auction  The treasury sold 4.5 billion ringgit ($1.5 billion) of
August 2014 notes at an average yield of 3.434 percent in the
single-largest debt offering since October 2009. Investors
submitted bids for 2.2 times the amount of notes on sale,
compared with 1.6 times at the previous sale of three-year notes
in October last year. The yield dropped to 3.41 percent after
the auction.  “Yields are attractive and appear to have priced in some
rate hikes ahead,” said Ben Eeh, a fixed-income analyst at
Kumpulan Wang Persaraan, which manages more than 60 billion
ringgit of pension funds in Kuala Lumpur. “As a new benchmark
bond, it should be a popular bond to own.”  The yield on the 3.21 percent bonds due May 2013 fell three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 3.27 percent today,
according to Bursa Malaysia. The rate climbed six basis points
from Feb. 2 and earlier reached 3.35 percent, the most since
October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
