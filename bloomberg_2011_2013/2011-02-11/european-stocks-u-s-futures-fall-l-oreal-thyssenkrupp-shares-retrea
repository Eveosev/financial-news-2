European stocks retreated after
Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak  defied calls for his immediate
resignation, increasing concern that the region will become more
unstable. U.S.-index futures and Asian shares slid.  L’Oreal SA slumped 5.3 percent after the world’s largest
cosmetics maker reported profit that failed to beat analysts’
estimates. ThyssenKrupp AG fell 2.6 percent as  Germany ’s largest
steelmaker reported earnings that matched analysts’ predictions.  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index lost 0.3 percent to
285.9 as of 8:04 a.m. in  London .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
