  Coca-Cola Co .,  Abbott Laboratories 
and T. Rowe Price Group Inc. are among 12 Standard & Poor’s 500
Index companies that may boost their dividends next week,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Coca-Cola, the world’s largest soft-drink maker, may raise
its quarterly payout to 48 cents from 44 cents, according to
Bloomberg estimates that factor in earnings and options prices.
Drugmaker Abbott may increase its dividend to 48 cents from 44
cents, while T. Rowe may declare a payout of 30 cents, up from
27 cents.  Two-thirds of dividend-paying companies in the U.S. equity
benchmark will return more money to owners this year after the
biggest dividend decline in dollar value on record in 2009,
according to  Howard Silverblatt , senior index analyst at S&P.  The companies are holding a near-record amount of cash
after earnings topped estimates for seven straight quarters. As
of Dec. 31, cash on balance sheets totaled $3.33 trillion, 12.6
percent of assets, according to Ned Davis Research Inc. in  Venice ,  Florida . Cash peaked in the third quarter at $3.46
trillion, 13.1 percent of assets, according to Ned Davis.  Other companies projected to increase dividends this week,
