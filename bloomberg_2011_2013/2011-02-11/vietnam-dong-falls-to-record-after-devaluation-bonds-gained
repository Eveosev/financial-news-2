  Vietnam ’s dong slid to a record
low against the  U.S. dollar  after the central bank devalued
the currency for the fourth time in 15 months.  Government
bonds  gained.  The dong dropped 6.7 percent to 20,798 per dollar as of
3:20 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The State Bank of Vietnam said today that it will fix the
reference rate for the currency at 20,693 versus 18,932
yesterday. It also narrowed the trading band to 1 percent on
either side of the rate from 3 percent before.  “There is still a crisis of confidence out there,”
said  Nizam Idris , a strategist at UBS AG in Singapore.
“There’s still more pressure for the currency to depreciate
some more.”  The dong traded yesterday on the black market at 21,300,
8.5 percent weaker than the official rate, and this afternoon
weakened to as much as 21,550, according to a telephone
information service run by Vietnam Posts & Telecommunications.  The yield on the benchmark five-year government bonds
fell 2 basis points to 11.522 percent, from 11.540 percent
yesterday, according to a daily fixing price from banks
compiled by Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  --Nguyen Kieu Giang in Hanoi. With reporting by Jason Folkmanis in  Ho Chi Minh City .  Editors: Jan Dahinten, Lars Klemming.  To contact the Bloomberg News Staff on this story:
