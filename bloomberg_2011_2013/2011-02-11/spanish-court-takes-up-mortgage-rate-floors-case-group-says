A Spanish court agreed to consider a
complaint against a practice by lenders of setting so-called
floors, or minimum  interest rates , for mortgage payments,
according to  Adicae , a group that represents bank customers.  A mercantile court in Madrid will examine the complaint
against 45 banks and savings banks by the group, Adicae said
today in an e-mailed statement.  Banks in  Spain  used the limits, written into some mortgage
contracts, to curb how low interest rates could go as the 12-
month Euribor, the benchmark rate for most Spanish home loans,
dropped as low as 1.22 percent last March from 5.39 percent in
July 2008. The practice helped Spanish lenders protect their
margins. About nine out of every 10 Spanish mortgages have a
floating rate.  Spanish banks have to offer customers products to cover
interest-rate risk, the country’s banking association said today
in a statement sent by e-mail. “In themselves, these products
can’t be considered either irregular or abusive.”  No one was available for comment at the 11th mercantile
court in  Madrid  when contacted by Bloomberg.  The Bank of Spain has said the floors are not abusive
because they were agreed to by customers. Adicae says lenders
benefited by as much as 7.5 billion euros ($10.2 billion) in
2010 because of the practice and that 4 million families were
affected by it.  To contact the reporter for this story:
