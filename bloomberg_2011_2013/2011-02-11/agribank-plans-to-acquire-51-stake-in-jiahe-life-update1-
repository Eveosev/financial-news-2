  Agricultural Bank of China Ltd .
plans to acquire a 51 percent stake in Jiahe Life Insurance Co.
for 2.59 billion yuan ($393 million), according to a statement
from the lender to the Hong Kong stock exchange today.  The Beijing-based bank held a board meeting today and
agreed to acquire the stake in Jiahe by purchasing about 1.04
billion new shares, the statement said.  Agricultural Bank joins other Chinese lenders in branching
into the insurance business to reduce dependence on revenue from
loans.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China  Ltd. plans to
invest 1.2 billion yuan for a 60 percent stake in Axa SA’s
insurance venture with China Minmetals Corp., ICBC President
Yang Kaisheng said in October.  Agricultural Bank’s third-quarter net income climbed 30
percent to 24.3 billion yuan. Its stock dropped 0.82 percent to
HK$3.61 today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
