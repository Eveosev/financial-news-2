Royal Dutch Shell Plc’s head of
shipping, Jan Kopernicki, wants governments to allow military
attacks on motherships used by Somali pirates to hijack vessels,
 Lloyd’s List  reported, citing an interview.  Governments have less than two months to act, Kopernicki,
also chairman of Maritime UK and president of the London-based
Chamber of Shipping, said, according to the newspaper.
Kopernicki and other shipping executives discussed the matter
with U.K. shipping minister Mike Penning on Feb. 7, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
