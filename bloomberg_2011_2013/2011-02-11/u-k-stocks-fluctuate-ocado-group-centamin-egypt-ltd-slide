U.K. stocks fluctuated between gains
and losses as Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak  defied calls for
his immediate resignation, increasing concern that the region
will become more unstable.    Ocado Group Plc  had a record 16 percent drop as John Lewis
Partnership Plc’s pension fund sold its entire shareholding in
the online grocer.  Centamin Egypt Ltd ., a gold company operating
in the North African country, sank 4.5 percent.  Guinness Peat
Group Plc  surged 8.7 percent after announcing plans to sell
assets and return the proceeds to shareholders.  The benchmark FTSE 100 gained 1.04, or less than 0.1
percent, 6,021.05 as of 1:58 p.m. in London. The gauge has
gained 0.4 percent this week, extending its rally since March
2009 to 71 percent. The  FTSE All-Share Index  also climbed less
than 0.1 percent, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index advanced 0.9
percent.  “The chance of conflict has increased significantly,”
Timothy Ash, head of emerging-markets research at Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc, wrote in an e-mailed note late yesterday.
“Further instability in  Egypt  will have significant regional
consequences, raising concern over possible disruption of trade
through the Suez canal, oil prices, the regional peace process
and perhaps even further knock-on effects.”  Egypt Revolt  Mubarak, 82, reiterated he intends to stay on as president
of Egypt until September in a broadcast announcement last night,
raising concern his administration will fail to quell unrest
that the United Nations says has resulted in 300 deaths over the
past two weeks. The protests, inspired by the popular revolt in
Tunisia, have sparked concern contagion will grip a region that
holds more than 50 percent of the world’s known oil reserves.  Ocado lost 16 percent to 240.1 pence, the biggest drop
since its initial public offering in July, after  John Lewis ’s
pension plan sold its entire stake in the company for 265 pence
a share. The fund had 57.3 million Ocado shares, or a 10.4
percent holding, according to Bloomberg data.  Centamin Egypt slid 5.7 percent to 132 pence, bringing this
week’s drop to 8.3 percent.    Regal Petroleum Plc  lost 2 percent to 36.5 pence as Geo-
Alliance Oil-Gas Public Ltd. and Heamoor Ltd. said they don’t
plan to make a takeover offer for the oil and gas producer.  Guinness Peat Group surged 8.7 percent to 37.5 pence, the
biggest gain since June. The owner of the world’s largest thread
maker is planning to sell most of its investments and return the
proceeds to shareholders. The assets are valued at about 610
million pounds ($977 million), the company said.    Legal & General Group Plc  climbed 3.5 percent to 122.9
pence. Nomura Holdings Inc. said it prefers the insurance
company to Prudential Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
