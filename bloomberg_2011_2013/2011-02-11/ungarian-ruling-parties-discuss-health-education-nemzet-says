Hungarian ruling-party lawmakers
yesterday discussed health care and education during a three-day
meeting in preparation for the spring parliamentary session,
 Magyar Nemzet  reported, without citing anyone.  Prime Minister  Viktor Orban ’s Fidesz party and its
Christian Democrat allies are preparing changes of “national
significance” that will extend to education, according to the
Budapest-based newspaper. Lawmakers also discussed plans for a
new Constitution, it said.  The government will submit proposals to improve efficiency
in health care and education to lawmakers within 10 days, Magyar
Nemzet said, citing a statement from  Peter Szijjarto , Orban’s
spokesman. “Serious professional consultations” will take
place in the next two or three months and decisions will be made
within half a year, the newspaper said.  The two parties decided to ban building  power plants  or
dams on the Hungarian section of the Danube, Szijjarto told
reporters during the meeting, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
