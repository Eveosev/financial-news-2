Oil and natural gas rigs operating
in the U.S. dropped from a two-year high as futures prices
declined, according to data published by  Baker Hughes Inc .  The combined rig count tumbled by 18 to 1,721, its first
decline this year, Baker Hughes said today on its  website .
The count rose to a 22-year high in 2008, peaking at 2,031.  Oil rigs decreased by 13 to 805. Last week, they were at
the highest level since at least 1987. Natural gas rigs lost
five to 906. The gas rig count remained down 44 percent from a
peak of 1,606 in 2008.  Crude for February delivery fell $3.45, or 3.9 percent, to
$85.58 a barrel this week on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
the biggest weekly drop since November.  Gas for February delivery dropped 4 cents, or 9.3 percent,
this week to $3.910 per million British thermal units. The gas
decline was the biggest in a single week since August.  Baker Hughes also reported that miscellaneous rigs, which
primarily drill for geothermal energy, were unchanged from the
week before at 10.  Among major producing states, the rig count fell by six in
Oklahoma, four in Colorado, two in Louisiana and one each in
Alaska, Arkansas,  New Mexico ,  Pennsylvania  and Wyoming. Rig
counts rose by two in North Dakota and one in  Texas .  Rigs on land fell by 17, or 1 percent, to 1,679. Rigs in
inland waters were unchanged from the week before at 16.  The rig count for offshore production and the  Gulf of
Mexico  in particular both dropped by one to 26.  Canadian rigs gained four, or 0.6 percent, to 630.  To contact the reporter on this story:
