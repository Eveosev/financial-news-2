  Ageas , the insurer that groups the
remains of Fortis, said the Brussels commercial court ruled its
undated convertible floating-rate notes sold in 2002 are valid
and won’t need to be redeemed at face value.  The court upheld the position of Ageas, the insurer, based
in Brussels and the Dutch city of Utrecht, said today in a
statement. Two Luxembourg-based funds holding a combined 458 so-
called FRESH securities with a face value of 114.5 million euros
($154.8 million) had sought the reimbursement of the notes’
nominal value.  Fortis raised 1.25 billion euros in 2002 selling the
convertible floating-rate notes that pay a quarterly coupon of
1.35 percent higher than the three-month euro interbank offered
rate. The notes last traded at 50 percent of face value. The
securities can be exchanged for Ageas shares when the stock
price rises to 31.50 euros, more than 13 times yesterday’s
closing price.  TreeTop Asset Management SA, the  fund manager  that started
the litigation on behalf of two of its funds, didn’t immediately
reply to an e-mail seeking comment. The Luxembourg-based company
manages about 1.4 billion euros, according to a statement on its
website.  Ageas rose as much as 2.1 percent after trading resumed
following the publication of the ruling and increased 2 cents to
2.31 euros at 4 p.m. in Brussels, valuing the insurer at 6.06
billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
