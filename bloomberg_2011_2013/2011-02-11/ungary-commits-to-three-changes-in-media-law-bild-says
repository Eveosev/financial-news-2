Hungary has told the European
Commission it will modify three points in its new media law,
 Bild Zeitung  reported, citing a letter from the country’s
vernment.  Foreign media companies will no longer have to register
with Hungarian authorities and won’t be subject to high fines if
they agree to abide to the revised rules, the newspaper said.
Pay TV channels won’t have to comply with the law’s requirement
of “balanced reporting,” Bild said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
