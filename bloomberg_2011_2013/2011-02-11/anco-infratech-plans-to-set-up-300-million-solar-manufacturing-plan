  Lanco Infratech Ltd ., an Indian
energy and infrastructure company, plans to build a plant in
Chhattisgarh to produce purified silicon, cells and other
components for solar photovoltaic facilities.  The plant in Rajnandgaon district will have a capacity of
250 megawatts a year and will produce ingots, wafers,
photovoltaic cells, modules and polysilicon, the company said in
an e-mailed statement.  The first phase of the project will require an investment
of 13.7 billion rupees ($300 million) and will start production
by 2012, it said.  The plant will be located within a special economic zone, a
type of duty-free enclave intended to promote trade by providing
special infrastructure and support services.  The companyâ€™s Lanco Solar Holdings unit also builds
projects and provides construction and contracting services. The
unit plans to build as much as 300 megawatts of its own capacity
over the next two years and contract work for up to 500
megawatts of solar thermal and photovoltaic plants in  India ,  Europe , the U.S. and  Canada , it said.  Lanco Solar has signed power purchase agreements for a 5-
megawatt photovoltaic plant and 100-megawatt solar thermal plant
in Rajasthan state, as well as a 35-megawatt photovoltaic plant
in Gujarat state, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
