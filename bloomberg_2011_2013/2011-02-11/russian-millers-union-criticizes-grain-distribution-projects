  Russia ’s distribution of stockpiled
grains to regions and sales from state inventories through
tenders are penalizing some millers, the country’s Millers’
Union said.  The distributions “put millers of different regions in the
non-competitive position,” the union said in a statement on its
 website . The union said it asked First Deputy Prime Minister  Viktor Zubkov  to examine the issue.  The deliveries at fixed low prices are confined to four
“privileged” regions, while some millers don’t have access to
the tenders, the union said.  The government, seeking to control food price inflation
after Russia’s worst drought in a half century damaged crops,
said in December it would sell as much as 500,000 tons of grain
from stockpiles in five monthly releases. Zubkov said last month
that the government sent more than 1 million tons to the regions
and another 2 million tons will be distributed.  President  Dmitry Medvedev  urged the government Feb. 9 to
suspend the tenders and find more effective ways to distribute
stockpiles, Interfax reported. The government will decide in two
weeks whether to halt the tenders and concentrate on sending
grain directly to the regions, the news agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
