     Feb. 11 (Bloomberg) --- Political turmoil in  Egypt  has cut
imports of cheaper flour from the North African nation into East
Africa, providing a boost for local millers,  Business Daily 
reported.  Only five containers with 121.4 metric tons of wheat flour
for the Ugandan and Kenyan markets have been shipped through
Mombasa port this year, the Nairobi-based newspaper reported,
citing the Kenya Ports Authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
