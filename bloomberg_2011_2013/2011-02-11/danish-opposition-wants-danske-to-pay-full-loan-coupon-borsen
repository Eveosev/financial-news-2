Danske Bank A/S should have to pay
the interest rate on its 24 billion-krone ($4.4 billion) hybrid
capital loan in full even if it repays the Danish state two-
years early,  Denmark ’s main opposition parties said according to
newspaper Borsen.  Borsen cited the Social Democrats’ finance spokesman Morten
Boedskov and the Socialist People’s Party finance spokesman Ole
Sohn.  That would mean Danske will still have to pay 3 billion
kroner in interest for the two years, Copenhagen-based Borsen
said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
