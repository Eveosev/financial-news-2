Asia marine  fuel oil , gasoil and jet
fuel rose for a sixth week. Gasoline fell by the most in 16
weeks on signs that stockpiles in the U.S., the biggest consumer
of the fuel, are growing amid slower demand.  Light Distillates  Benchmark 92-RON gasoline for loading from Singapore
dropped 2.3 percent this week, the most since Oct. 22, to
$105.65 a barrel, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Open-
specification naphtha for delivery to Japan fell 0.2 percent
this week to $872.50 a metric ton.  Gasoline’s premium to naphtha narrowed to $10.50 a barrel
compared with $12.85 on Feb. 2. A narrower reforming margin
means the profit from turning naphtha into gasoline is falling.  The premium of Japan-delivered naphtha to  Brent crude , or
the crack spread, fell to $107.42 a ton from $108.40 at the end
of Asian trading on Feb. 2, according to Bloomberg data. Markets
were closed on Feb. 3 and Feb. 4 in Singapore because of the
Lunar New Year holiday.  U.S. gasoline supplies increased 4.66 million barrels to
240.9 million last week, the highest level since March 1990, the
Energy Department said this week.  Cargill Inc. bought 25,000 tons of naphtha for second-half
April delivery from Glencore International AG at $872 a ton.
Noble Group sold 50,000 barrels of 92-RON gasoline loading Feb.
26 to March 2 to BP Plc at $106 a barrel. Noble sold 50,000
barrels of 92-RON loading March 9 to March 13 to BP at $105.70 a
barrel.  Arcadia Petroleum Ltd. bought 50,000 barrels of 92-RON
loading March 8 to March 12 from Royal Dutch Shell Plc at
$105.50 a barrel.  Fuel Oil  Benchmark 180-centistoke fuel oil rose 0.5 percent this
week to $589.25 a ton. The price of 380-centistoke fuel oil,
used mainly as marine fuel, climbed to $578.75, gaining for a
sixth week, as demand in  Singapore  increased.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade, or the viscosity spread, was unchanged from last week at
$10.50 barrel. The spread was at $22.50 a ton yesterday, the
widest since Aug. 14, 2008, as the value of the less-viscous
grade used at  power plants  surged relative to the thicker fuel
used mainly in ships, Bloomberg data showed.  Singapore’s residue or fuel oil stockpiles fell 17 percent
to 15.8 million barrels in the nine days ended Feb. 9, a unit of
the trade ministry said yesterday. Supplies are at the lowest
since July 2009.  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude, or crack spread,
widened to $6.50 a ton from $5.53 a week earlier, Bloomberg data
showed.  Shell bought 20,000 tons of 380-centistoke fuel oil for
loading March 9 to March 13 from Vitol at a premium of $12 a ton
to Platts prices. Shell also bought 20,000 tons of the same
grade for loading March 1 to March 5 at a premium of $8 a ton to
Platts prices published in the remaining days of February.  Middle Distillates  Benchmark gasoil with 0.5 percent sulfur rose 2 percent to
$115.65 a barrel, Bloomberg data showed.  Jet fuel  increased 1
percent to $117.80 a barrel. Both products posted gains for the
sixth week.  Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude rose to $17.79 a barrel
from $16.89 a week earlier, Bloomberg data showed.  Total SA sold 250,000 barrels of gasoil with sulfur content
of 0.5 percent to Vitol Group at a discount of 10 cents to
prices published by Platts in the remaining days of February.
The cargo is for loading March 9 to March 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
