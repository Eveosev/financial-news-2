Ontarioâ€™s government said it
suspended approval of offshore wind-power projects, citing
concern that more research is needed on their effect on the
environment.  The Canadian province has also stopped accepting
applications for its renewable energy  subsidy program , its
government said today in a  statement .  Ontario said there is only one offshore wind project in a
freshwater lake in operation in the world, in  Sweden , and that
it would not approve any projects in Canadian lakes until more
research is conducted.  By 2018, Ontario plans to add 10.7 gigawatts of renewable
energy under its  Long Term Energy Plan  while eliminating coal-
fired power generation by 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
