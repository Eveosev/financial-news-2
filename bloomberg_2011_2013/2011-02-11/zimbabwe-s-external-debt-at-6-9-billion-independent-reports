  Zimbabwe ’s external debt was $6.9
billion at the end of last year, the  Zimbabwe Independent  said,
citing a central bank report.  The debt amounts to 103 percent of the southern African
nation’s gross domestic product, according to the bank, the
Harare-based newspaper reported.  Fifty-seven percent of the debt is owed by central
government, the Independent said. State-owned businesses
represent another 35 percent and private industry accounts for
the remaining 8 percent, the paper reported.  Calls to the Harare-based  central bank  to obtain the report
weren’t answered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
