The world’s wind turbine order
intake rose 75 percent in the second half of last year, reaching
the highest level of activity in two years, MAKE Consulting
said.  “The continuing recovery in order activity, which began in
Q4 2009, provides much needed relief to turbine vendors with
dwindling backlogs,” the Hoejbjerg, Denmark-based industry
consultant said in a note on its website today. Order intake for
2010 rose 48 percent with 75 percent of that growth originating
from the Americas and the Asia and Pacific regions, MAKE said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
