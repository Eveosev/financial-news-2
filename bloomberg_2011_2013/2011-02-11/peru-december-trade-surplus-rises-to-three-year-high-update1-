earlier, the agency said in an e-mailed report today.  Exports increased 22 percent to $3.64 billion, the agency
said. Minerals accounted for almost two-thirds of the total.
Imports jumped 31 percent to $2.57 billion, led by purchases of
crude oil, cars and mobile phones, it said.  For the whole of 2010, the nation’s trade surplus was $7.13
billion, the agency said. Exports rose 31 percent to $35.1
billion last year and imports increased 36 percent to $27.3
billion.  The sol strengthened 0.1 percent to 2.7645 per dollar at
