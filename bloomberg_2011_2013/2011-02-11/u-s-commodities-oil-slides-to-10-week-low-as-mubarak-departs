Crude oil fell to a 10-week low
after Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak  stepped down and handed
power to the military, reducing concern that shipments from the
Middle East will be disrupted.  Oil dropped 1.3 percent after Vice President  Omar Suleiman 
made the announcement on state television today. Protests to
unseat Mubarak sparked concern that shipments through the  Suez
Canal  would stop and that unrest would spread to other countries
in the Middle East and North Africa.  “Mubarak’s resignation should end the crisis in  Egypt ,”
said  John Kilduff , a partner at Again Capital LLC, a  New York- 
based hedge fund that focuses on energy. “The security premium
that appeared when the unrest began will probably come out of
the oil price.”  In other markets, corn futures rose to a 31-month high as
global demand continued to outpace supplies, eroding inventories
in the U.S., the world’s biggest grower. Sugar dropped. The UBS
Bloomberg Constant Maturity Commodity Index declined 0.5 percent
to 1,708.91.  Oil futures for March delivery declined $1.15 to $85.58 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest
settlement since Nov. 30. The price reached a two-year high of
$92.19 on Jan. 31 amid the unrest in Egypt.  Corn    Mexico , the second-biggest buyer of U.S. corn, purchased
210,000 metric tons for delivery before Aug. 31, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said. U.S. export sales in the week
ended Feb. 3 were 51 percent higher than the average of the
prior four weeks. The USDA forecast domestic inventories before
this year’s harvest will be equal to 5 percent of consumption,
the second-lowest ever.  “Corn demand has yet to show signs of slowing,” said  Shawn McCambridge , the senior grain analyst for Prudential Bache
Commodities LLC in Chicago. “The tightening supply-and-demand
balance sheet will boost prices until demand slows and provide
farmers an incentive to plant more this year.”  Corn futures for May delivery rose 7.75 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $7.1725 a bushel on the  Chicago  Board of Trade.
Earlier, the price reached $7.175, the highest for a most-active
contract since July 9, 2008. The grain has surged 91 percent in
the past year.  Sugar  Sugar fell to a two-month low on speculation that rising
output will erase a global-supply deficit that last week sent
futures to a 30-year high.  Sugar may shift to a surplus for the first time in three
years, said Mike Zarembski, a senior commodity analyst at
OptionsXpress Holdings Inc. in Chicago. Prices probably will
drop in 2010 as  Brazil  boosts output, Lindsay Jolly, a senior
economist at the  International Sugar Organization , said this
month. Sugar has doubled since the end of May after adverse
weather damaged crops.  “The potential for world sugar supplies to move back into
a surplus this year could send prices sharply lower and put an
end to this historic bull-market run,” Zarembski said in a
report.  Raw sugar for May delivery fell 0.8 cent, or 2.6 percent,
to 29.39 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York . Earlier,
the price touched 28.86 cents, the lowest since Dec. 10.  Commodities settled as follows:  Precious metals:
