Spot gasoline in the Midwest
strengthened after  ConocoPhillips  said a flare smoked at its
Ponca City refinery in Oklahoma because of frigid weather.  Emissions were reported yesterday from the east flare at
the plant, according to a filing with the Oklahoma Department of
Environmental Quality. Skylar McElhaney, a spokeswoman for the
department, said the “issue was resolved.”  Also in Oklahoma,  Explorer Pipeline Co. , based in Tulsa,
canceled Cycle 5 on its oil products line because a destination
“couldn’t handle” products. Tom Jensen, a spokesman for the
line, said in a telephone interview. He declined to identify the
destination.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Midwest, or Group 3, narrowed 0.5 cent to 2 cents a gallon
versus futures on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:36 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery
increased 0.27 cent to $2.4475.    Gulf Coast  spot gasoline narrowed its discount 0.37 cent to
6.13 cents a gallon.  The Explorer pipeline isn’t experiencing operational
issues, Jensen said.  “We haven’t had any power curtailments this week” because
of weather, he said.  The line, which transports gasoline,  diesel fuel  and jet
fuel from the Gulf Coast to the Midwest, was shut earlier this
month at the request of the power company during bad weather,
Jensen said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
