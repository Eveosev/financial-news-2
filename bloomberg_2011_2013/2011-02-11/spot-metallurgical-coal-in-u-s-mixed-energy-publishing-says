Coking coal prices on the U.S. spot
market were mixed as the market tried to assess demand following
supply disruptions in  Australia , Energy Publishing said.  Spot prices for low-volatility coking coal declined $10, or
3 percent, to $320 a ton in the week ended today, according to
the  Knoxville, Tennessee-based  data provider. High-volatility
coal gained $28.23, or 11 percent, to $287.50.  “The Europeans haven’t reacted yet but have more to think
about,” Energy Publishing said. “Bid-ask spreads have narrowed
some from what they had been the past three weeks.”  Energy Publishing says it surveys buyers and sellers of
coal to determine pricing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
