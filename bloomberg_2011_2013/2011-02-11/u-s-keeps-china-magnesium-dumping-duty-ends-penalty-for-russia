The U.S. will maintain anti-dumping
duties on imports of Chinese magnesium after a review of the
measure, according to a statement on the U.S. International
Trade Commission’s website.   The review found that revoking the penalty would lead to a
“continuation or recurrance of material injury,” it said.  The duty on imports from  Russia  will be revoked, it said.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
