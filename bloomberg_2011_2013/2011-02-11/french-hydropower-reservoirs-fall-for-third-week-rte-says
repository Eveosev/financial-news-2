Hydroelectric reserves in  France 
fell for a third week, reducing supplies of water to generate
electricity in  Europe ’s second-biggest power market.  Water reservoirs for electricity production slid 6
percentage points to 51 percent full at the start of this week,
according to data on the  website  of Reseau de Transport
d’Electricite, a unit of Electricite de France SA.  Reserves are 3 percentage points below the same week last
year and 16 points lower than in 2009. France gets about 20
percent of its power capacity from running water through
turbines. Utilities can retain water for use when demand and
prices are higher.  RTE compiles data from generators EDF,  GDF Suez  SA and
Societe Nationale d’Electricite & de Thermique. The three
companies produce more than 90 percent of French electricity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
