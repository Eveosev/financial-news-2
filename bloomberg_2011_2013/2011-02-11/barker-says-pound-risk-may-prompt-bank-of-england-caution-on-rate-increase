Former Bank of England policy maker  Kate Barker  said officials may be wary of increasing  interest
rates  if it risks stoking gains in the pound that would
undermine Britain’s economic recovery.  “Having a reasonably weak sterling is very helpful, that
is certainly a reason why you’d expect a lot of caution on
changing rates,” Barker said in an interview in London. “The
bank would certainly be uncomfortable if sterling appreciated
strongly, because that would solve the inflation problem but it
would be depressing the economy at a time when actually you
really, really want to see a better current account.”  The pound has gained against 15 of the U.K.’s 16 most-
traded currencies this year as soaring inflation prompted
investors to raise bets on when the bank will raise its
benchmark interest rate. Barker said that exporters, which have
benefited from the pound’s 20 percent drop since the start of
2007, could withstand some gains in the currency.  “Rates going up a quarter percent, is that really going to
push sterling up and suddenly make this considerable competitive
boost from the pound go away? It doesn’t seem very likely,” she
said. “But hey, exchange rate forecasting, who can do that?”  Analysts forecast the pound will strengthen next year to 80
pence per euro, the currency of Britain’s biggest trading
partner, Bloomberg data show. It was at 84.5 percent per euro
late yesterday in  London . Inflation reached 3.7 percent in
December and Bank of England Governor  Mervyn King  forecasts the
rate may exceed 4 percent, more than twice the 2 percent target.  ‘Pretty Pleased’  Policy makers held the key rate at a record low of 0.5
percent yesterday to nurture the recovery, and left their bond-
purchase plan at 200 billion pounds ($322 billion). Barker said
that during the financial crisis, the weaker pound gave the bank
grounds to expect they could salvage the recovery.  “One of the things that made us feel more confident that
we could turn the economy around was the fact that sterling fell
during the crisis, and we were pretty pleased about that,” said
Barker, who served on the bank’s Monetary Policy Committee from
2001 until May last year. Still, “I’m sure the bank doesn’t
have a target for the  exchange rate .”  Barker said setting policy when inflation is above target
and growth has had “the wind taken out of its sails” presents
the bank with challenges in preserving its credibility.  “Economic judgments at the moment are very difficult,
because the economy is in a difficult state, and the credibility
and public perception risks are unusually high,” she said. “It
would be quite dangerous if the view that they’re really
targeting something else came into play.”  ‘Credibility Question’  Former policy maker DeAnne Julius said this week that the
bank’s credibility has suffered because it hasn’t changed policy
amid a 13-month bout of above-target inflation. Barker said
there may be other credibility tests.  “If you start putting rates up when the economy’s quite
weak, then you start to have the credibility question, ‘Do we
really want these people running our economy?’” Barker said. In
addition, “If you thought a rate increase was really going to
be misinterpreted as the start of some great tightening, then
you’d really worry about it, and that’s when communication is
going to be incredibly important.”  She also said policy makers are wary of a rate increase
creating a big jump in bond yields. The yield on the U.K.’s 10-
year gilt has risen 49 basis points this year to 3.88 percent,
the highest in nine months.  “The danger you run is that the whole yield curve moves up
very sharply and then you have more of an effect on growth than
you really wanted,” she said. “It’s one of the many things
committee members are dealing with.”  Barker said that whenever the bank starts tightening
policy, there’s no reason for it to make big moves. Policy maker  Andrew Sentance  has been arguing since June for a “gradual”
increase in borrowing costs to control inflation.  “It would be a bit odd for the policy choice to be between
rates being where they are or moving up to 3 percent,” she
said. “In some ways a small rise, a quarter or even half, might
be relatively costless for growth.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
