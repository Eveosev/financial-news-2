The Spanish government created tax
breaks to encourage hiring young people and the long-term
unemployed in a bid to lower the 43 percent youth jobless rate.  Companies will get a reduction of 75 percent to 100 percent
in social-security taxes for offering part-time work to people
up to 30 years old and the long-term jobless, Labor Minister
Valeriano Gomez told a news conference in  Madrid  today. The
incentives last a year in an attempt to spur employment in 2011.  A new subsidy will be created for unemployed workers in
training, Deputy Prime Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba told the
briefing. The program will cost 400 million euros ($540
million), with spending cuts from other ministries funding half
of that amount. The subsidies will last six months and the
budget won’t be exceeded, the ministers said.  Spain’s unemployment rate is the highest in the European
Union at 20 percent, rising to 43 percent among people younger
than 25, after a decade-long construction boom lured Spaniards
out of school and into building jobs. The collapse of the debt-
fueled boom pushed  Spain  into its worst economic slump in six
decades, swelling the  budget deficit  to the third largest in the
euro region.  To contact the reporters on this story:
