  Zenergy Power Plc , a developer of  energy-efficiency  technology for smart grids and wind farms,
dropped a record 25 percent in  London  after saying it lacked
funding and was seeking a takeover.  The shares dove 6 pence to close at 18 pence. The U.K.
company said today in a filing that it hired Matrix Corporate
Capital LLP and Woodside Capital Partners to seek a buyer.  “Zenergy’s business can best be developed as part of a
larger group with access to the necessary funding and commercial
relationships to enable commercialization” of its intellectual
property and products, Zenergy said in the statement.  The company has patents for increasing energy efficiency in
power production, from coils and magnets that have higher
electrical conductivity to devices that protect power grids
against damaging surges of electricity, such as those caused by
short circuits or lightning.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
