Cocoa is being smuggled from  Ivory
Coast  into  Ghana  via canoes that travel along the  Tano river ,
which borders the two nations, the Daily Graphic reported today,
citing Isaac Akligbe, police commander in Ghanaâ€™s Enchi
district.  The illegal traders outnumber police in the area, the
Accra-based newspaper cited Akligbe as saying. Ghanaian officers
were forced to release two trucks carrying beans on Feb. 7 after
smugglers threatened to kill the police who stopped them, the
newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
