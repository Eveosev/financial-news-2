  Vallourec SA , a French producer of
steel pipes for the oil and gas industry, increased a new credit
line to 1 billion euros ($1.36 billion) after lenders offered
more than it sought.  The five-year revolving credit will partially refinance
loans maturing in 2012 and 2013,  Boulogne Billancourt , France
based Vallourec said in a statement. Money in a revolving credit
can be borrowed again once itâ€™s been repaid.  Banco Santander SA, BNP Paribas SA, Commerzbank AG, Credit
Agricole CIB, HSBC Holdings Plc, Natixis, Societe Generale SA
and Banque Federative du Credit Mutuel arranged the deal and
were joined by 14 other lenders, according to the statement.  Vallourec initially asked banks for 850 million euros,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company agreed to
pay interest of 65 basis points more than the euro interbank
offered rate on money it draws from the facility, Bloomberg data
show. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
