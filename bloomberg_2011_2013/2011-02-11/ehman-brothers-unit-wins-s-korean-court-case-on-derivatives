A European unit of  Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc . won a South Korean court case raised by Korea
Investment & Securities Co., which sought to recover 353 billion
won ($314 million) of losses on credit-linked notes it bought
before the U.S. investment bank’s collapse.  The  Seoul Southern District Court  today dismissed a request
by a Korea Investment unit, which was seeking repayment of
principal and interest from Lehman Brothers International Europe,
according to a document posted on the court’s website.  Korea Investment filed the suit at the Seoul court in
February last year, claiming Lehman’s European unit should pay
back principal and interest after failing to recoup 300 billion
won worth of credit-linked notes it purchased from Lehman
Brothers Treasury Company Co. in 2006. Lehman collapsed in
September 2008 in the biggest U.S. bankruptcy.  The court found that Lehman’s European unit isn’t
responsible for the securities Korea Investment bought, lawyers
for Korea Investment and Lehman Brothers said in telephone
interviews. Seol Kwang Ho, a lawyer for Korea Investment, said
the firm may consider appealing the ruling.  To contact the reporter on this story:
