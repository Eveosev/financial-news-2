Australian Open champion  Kim Clijsters  next week will reclaim the No. 1 spot in women’s
tennis from  Caroline Wozniacki .  Clijsters, who also is the two-time reigning U.S. Open
champion, beat Australia’s Jelena Dokic 6-3, 6-0 today in the
Paris Open quarterfinals to ensure she’ll move up to the top
spot when the new WTA tour rankings are released on Feb. 14.  The 27-year-old Belgian will be making her fourth
appearance at No. 1. She first reached the top spot in August
2003, and moved to No. 1 again in October 2003 and in January
2006.  She won the 2009 U.S. Open as a wild-card entry after a 20-
month break from tennis during which she got married and gave
birth to her daughter, Jada. Clijsters has spent a total of 19
weeks at No. 1,  Clijsters last month won her first Australian Open crown by
defeating  China ’s  Li Na  in the final in Melbourne. Denmark’s
Wozniacki has not played in a tournament since losing to Li in
the Australian Open semifinals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
