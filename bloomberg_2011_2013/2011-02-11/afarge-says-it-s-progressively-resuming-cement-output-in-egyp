  Lafarge SA , the world’s largest
cement maker, has been resuming production of the building
material in  Egypt  since Feb. 6, after a halt caused by the
uprising against President Hosni Mubarak’s rule intensified.  “Production is progressively resuming since Sunday,”
Christel des Royeries, a spokeswoman for Paris-based Lafarge,
said by telephone today.  Egypt generated 704 million euros ($943 million) of revenue
for the company in 2009, equal to 4.4 percent of total group
sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
