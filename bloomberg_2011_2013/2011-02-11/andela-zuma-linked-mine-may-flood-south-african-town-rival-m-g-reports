Aurora Empowerment Systems Ltd. has
halted pumping at its Grootvlei mine in South Africa,
threatening to flood the nearby town of Nigel and a mine shaft
owned by  Gold One International Ltd ., Johannesburg’s Mail &
Guardian reported, citing employees and labor union officials.  The pumps, needed to prevent ground water from rising, were
removed and brought to the surface this week, the newspaper
said. Water at the mine is rising by a meter a day and could
flood the mine within five to eight months, Gideon du Plessis, a
spokesman for the Solidarity union said, according to the
newspaper.  Aurora’s Managing Director is Zondwa Mandela, a grandson of
former South African President  Nelson Mandela , while the
company’s chairman is Khulubuse Zuma, a nephew of Jacob Zuma,
the country’s current president.  Calls to Khulubuse Zuma’s mobile phone weren’t answered and
his phone wasn’t accepting messages. Calls to  Zondwa Mandela ’s
phone didn’t connect.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
