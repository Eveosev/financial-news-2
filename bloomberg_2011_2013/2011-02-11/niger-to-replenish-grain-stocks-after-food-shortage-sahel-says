Niger’s  ruling military junta plans
to buy 85,000 metric tons of grains from farmers to guarantee
food provisions for citizens following shortages last year, Voix
du Sahel reported.  The West African nation’s reserves of grains were depleted
during the 2010 crisis and the purchases will restock supplies,
the Niamey-based, state-owned broadcaster cited Seydou Sadou,
director general of Nigerien Agricultural Products, as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
