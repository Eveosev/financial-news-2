  Russia ’s debt may surge to 585
percent of gross domestic product by 2050 as the population
declines and the government ramps up spending, pushing the  credit rating  below investment grade, Standard & Poor’s said.  The population will probably shrink to 116 million by 2050
from 140 million last year, forcing the government’s age-related
expenditures to rise to 25.5 percent of GDP from 13 percent in
2010 in the rating agency’s “base-case scenario,” S&P credit
analysts led by  Frank Gill  in  London  said in a research note e-
mailed today and dated Feb. 8.  The demographic decline will lead to “prolonged fiscal
imbalances,” putting Russia’s credit rating under “rising
pressure” after 2015, according to S&P. Russian government debt
is rated BBB at  Standard & Poor’s , two notches above junk. The
country’s state debt made up 9.5 percent of GDP, Finance
Minister Alexei Kudrin said on Feb. 2.  “Russia’s aging population will likely place substantial
pressure on economic growth performance and public finances,”
the analysts wrote. “By 2035, we expect that Russia’s fiscal
indicators will have weakened such that they would be more in
line with sovereigns currently rated in the speculative-grade
category, because, in our view, the projected improvement in GDP
per capita would not be able to offset the potential fiscal
deterioration.”  The government may be forced to raise the  retirement age  to
cope with the crisis, Kudrin has said. Russia’s population,
which has posted 14 years of declines before rising by 23,300 to
141.9 million in 2009, will fall to 139 million by 2031 under
the government’s  baseline forecast.   Pension Age  The pension age is now 60 for men and 55 for women. The
country may have 112 working people for 100 pensioners in two
years and reach parity by 2030, compared with the current ratio
of 128 to 100, according to Kudrin.  The population shrank by 81,600 from the end of 2009 to
141.8 million on Dec. 1, according to latest data from the
 Federal Statistics Service  published on Feb. 9. The average  life
expectancy  for men is about 61.8 years and 74.2 years for women.  Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  made tackling Russia’s
demographic crisis a priority during his eight years as
president, starting payments to women for each second child. In
2007, he approved a long-term plan for halting the decline that
aimed to stabilize the population at about 142 million by 2015
and to spur growth to 145 million by 2025.  ‘Moderate’ Spending  The government’s spending on its aging population will
remain “moderate” until the early 2020s before pension outlays
soar as more people approach retirement, S&P said. Spending on
pensions is expected to increase to 18.8 percent of GDP by 2050
from 9.4 percent last year, the rating company estimates.  Pensions will rise 8.8 percent in 2011 after readjustment
for inflation, following an increase of about 45 percent last
year, Putin  said  during a meeting with Health Minister Tatyana Golikova on Jan. 31. That increase amounts to 277 billion rubles
($9.4 billion) a year in additional government outlays,
according to Golikova.  Russia’s old-age dependency ratio, defined as the number of
people aged 65 and older divided by the number of those between
the ages of 15 and 64, will increase to 39 percent by 2050 from
18 percent in 2010, S&P said.  The population aged 15 to 64 reached a maximum in Russia in
2005,  Ivan Tchakarov , chief economist for Russia and the former  Soviet Union  at BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research in Moscow,
wrote in a Jan. 21 research note. The age group will only peak
in 2025 in  China , 2030 in  Brazil  and 2045 in  India , according to
Tchakarov.  Labor Costs  The shrinking workforce will increase labor costs,
accelerating Russia’s per capita growth to 4.9 percent this year
from 4.4 percent in 2010, making it the richest one of the so-
called BRIC countries along with Brazil, Merrill Lynch
estimates.  Russia’s increasing wealth means its debt rating will
likely be raised three notches to A by 2015 before coming under
pressure as a result of its demographic decline, S&P said today.  Even so, the agency’s base-case scenario is “not a
prediction,” the analysts wrote.  “Rather, it is a simulation that highlights the importance
of age-related spending trends as a factor in the evolution of
sovereign creditworthiness,” according to the report.
“Historically, once governments are confronted with
unsustainably rising debt burdens, they usually react by
tightening their fiscal stances or reforming their expenditure
programs.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
