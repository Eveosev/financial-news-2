Ethanol futures declined in  Chicago 
on ample supply of the fuel and lower consumption.  The alternative fuel slipped from a 30-month high two days
after an Energy Department report showed supply climbed to 19.6
million barrels last week, the highest since July 16. Production
of conventional gasoline blended with ethanol fell 0.6 percent
to 4.66 million barrels a day.  “People are kind of stepping back a little,” said Will Babler, a broker at First Capitol Risk Management LLC in Galena,  Illinois . “It’s been a little interesting in the front-end
where producers are getting squeezed a little bit.”  Denatured ethanol for March delivery slipped 1 cent, or 0.4
percent, to $2.465 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices yesterday settled at $2.475, the highest since July 31,
2008. Futures are 43 percent higher than a year ago.  In cash market trading ethanol was unchanged in the U.S.
Gulf at $2.525 a gallon and on the West Coast at $2.56,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  New York  fell 2.5 cents, or 1 percent, to $2.535
a gallon and in Chicago the additive increased 2 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $2.435.  Average ethanol mills in Iowa are losing 9 cents on every
gallon produced and plants in Illinois are losing 6 cents on a
spot basis, according to Ag Trader Talk, an online grains
information service in Clive,  Iowa .  To contact the reporter on this story:
