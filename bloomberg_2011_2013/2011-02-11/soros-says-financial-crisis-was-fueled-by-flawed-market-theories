Billionaire  George Soros  said the
financial crisis was avoidable and was caused by market
participants and regulators following flawed market theories.  “It’s the theories adopted by both the regulators and the
market participants that proved to be false,” Soros, 80, said
in an October 2010 interview released today by the Financial
Crisis Inquiry Commission on its website. “It’s the efficient-
market hypothesis and the rational expectations theory.”  The efficient-market hypothesis holds that prices reflect
all relevant information available to market participants. Under
the rational expectations theory, people make decisions based on
their rational outlook while influenced by past experiences.  Soros, chairman and founder of Soros Fund Management LLC in
New York, said the U.S. government made a mistake in failing to
prevent the 2008 implosion of investment bank Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc.  “I don’t think Lehman should have been allowed to fail,”
he said in the interview. “The Fed, in my opinion, has very
wide discretionary powers which were not used.”  Soros, who reportedly made $1 billion betting against the
British pound in 1992, says he is retired from investing.  To contact the reporters on this story:
