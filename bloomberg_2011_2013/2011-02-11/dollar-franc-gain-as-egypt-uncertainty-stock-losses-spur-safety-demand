 The dollar rose for a second day
against the euro as a decline in Asian stocks and concern the
turmoil in  Egypt  will deepen spurred demand for safety assets.  The dollar gained to $1.3566 per euro as of 10:52 a.m. in
Tokyo from $1.3603 in  New York  yesterday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
