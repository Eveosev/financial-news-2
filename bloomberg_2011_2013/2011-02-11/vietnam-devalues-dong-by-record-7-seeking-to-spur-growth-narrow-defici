  Vietnam  devalued the dong by about 7
percent, the most since at least 1993, seeking to curb the
nation’s trade deficit.  The dong slumped as low as 20,850 per dollar as of 9:14 a.m.
in Hanoi, compared with 19,498 yesterday. The  State Bank  of 
Vietnam fixed the  reference rate  at 20,693 dong today, versus 18,932 
yesterday, according to its Web site. The authority also narrowed 
the trading band, allowing the dong to rise or fall 1 percent either
side of the rate, compared with 3 percent previously.  “I’m quite surprised by the size as it’s very steep,”
Dariusz Kowalczyk, senior economist and strategist at Credit
Agricole CIB in  Hong Kong  said in a telephone interview. “It
seems the authorities are trying to support exports and to
support growth, rather than to fight inflation. That’s very
surprising because inflation in Vietnam is a major problem.”  The monetary authority devalued the dong in November 2009
and February and August last year, amid concern the nation may
run short on foreign capital needed to fund a trade deficit,
which reached $1 billion in January, according to the
government’s figures. Currency reserves fell to $13.6 billion at
the end of last year, down from $14.1 billion in September and
$23.9 billion in 2008, according to  Citigroup Inc .  “These measures will help to manage the  exchange rate  more
flexibly, suiting foreign currency supply and demand,” the
central bank said in the statement. It will “also help curb the
trade deficit.”  Moody’s cut Vietnam’s sovereign credit rating in December,
citing the risk of a balance-of-payments crisis and a drop in
foreign reserves as inflation reached a two-year high and the
currency weakens. Consumer prices increased 12.2 percent last
month from a year earlier, compared with 11.8 percent in
December, according to data from the General Statistics Office.  “One of our top priorities now is to stabilize the macro
economy in order to maintain the pace of growth,” Nguyen Van
Thao, deputy chief administrator of the ruling Vietnamese
 Communist Party’s Central Committee , said on Jan. 19. The
government forecasts the economy will expand by up to 7.5
percent this year, compared with 6.7 percent in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
