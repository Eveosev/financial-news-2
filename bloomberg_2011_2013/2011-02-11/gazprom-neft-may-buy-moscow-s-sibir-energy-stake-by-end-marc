OAO Gazprom Neft, the oil arm of  Russia ’s natural gas exporter OAO Gazprom, may buy the remaining
shares of Sibir Energy from the city of Moscow as early as this
month.  The company may buy the 22.4 percent stake in February or
March, Ekaterina Stenyakina, Gazprom Neft spokeswoman said today
by phone from Moscow. She didn’t say a price.  Sibir Energy owns half of a Siberian oil production venture
with Royal Dutch Shell Plc that last year supplied Gazprom Neft
with more than 80,000 barrels a day, according to the company.
Gazprom Neft and Sibir also control the Moscow Refinery, which
processed 10.15 million tons of crude last year.  Gazprom Neft spent $2.51 billion in building up a stake of
about 80 percent in the company between April 2009 and May last
year. In July, it sold about 3 percent to Moscow, the oil
producer said in its third-quarter financial statement.  Russia appointed Sergei Sobyanin Mayor of Moscow in
October, replacing Yury Luzhkov who had run the city for 18
years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
