  Deutsche Lufthansa AG ’s code-share
arrangements with Turkish Airlines on routes between Germany and
Turkey are being probed by European Union antitrust officials
over concerns they may be harming competition.  The European Commission in Brussels said it is also
investigating similar code-sharing between Brussels Airlines and
TAP SGPS SA,  Portugal ’s state-owned airline.  “While code-share agreements can provide substantial
benefits to passengers, some types of such agreements may also
produce anti-competitive effects,” the commission said in an e-
mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
