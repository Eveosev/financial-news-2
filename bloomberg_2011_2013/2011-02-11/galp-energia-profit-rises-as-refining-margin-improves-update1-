  Galp Energia SGPS SA ,  Portugal ’s
biggest oil company, said fourth-quarter profit rose 16 percent
after its refining margins improved.  Adjusted net income rose to 40 million euros ($54 million)
from 34 million euros a year earlier, the Lisbon-based company
said in a regulatory filing today. That compares with the 38.8
million-euro average estimate in a Bloomberg survey. Profit on
this basis excludes one-time items and inventory changes.  Galp is expanding exploration in regions such as Brazil’s
offshore Santos Basin, where the Lula project is located, and  Angola  to improve access to crude supplies and rely less on
refining and sales of fuel in Portugal and  Spain . Its refining
business recovered last year after the global recession curbed
demand for oil products.  “The depressed economic environment in Iberia and the
Sines refinery outage in the first quarter of 2011 will impact
operating performance,” Galp said in a presentation today. The
Sines refinery is restarting after it was shut last month to
install new units as part of a conversion project, Chief
Executive Officer Manuel Ferreira de Oliveira said today.  The oil company’s stock rose 4.1 percent to 15.385 euros,
the highest close since June 2008.  Eni SpA ,  Italy ’s biggest oil
company, and Portuguese holding company Amorim Energia BV each
control a third of Galp.  Petrobras Talks    Petroleo Brasileiro SA , Brazil’s state-controlled oil
company, on Feb. 7 said it ended talks with Eni about the
purchase of a stake in Galp. Eni Chief Executive Officer  Paolo Scaroni  on Feb. 8 said the Italian oil producer isn’t in talks
with anyone to sell its stake in Galp after negotiations with
Petrobras collapsed.    Total SA ,  Europe ’s third-largest oil producer, also
reported earnings today and posted a 23 percent increase in
fourth-quarter profit on higher production and prices. Brent oil
prices averaged 16 percent more in the fourth quarter than in
the year-earlier period.  Galp’s adjusted earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization rose 18 percent to 177 million
euros in the quarter. Galp forecasts Ebitda will climb 15
percent to 20 percent a year from 2009 to 2014.  Refinery Upgrades  The company plans to invest 4 billion to 4.5 billion euros
through 2014 on projects including the Lula field and on
refinery conversions to increase diesel output and improve
margins.  No further shutdowns are planned for this year as a result
of work on conversion projects at the company’s two refineries,
Ferreira de Oliveira said. The Oporto refinery will start full
production in the second quarter after the conversion project is
completed, while Sines will start by the end of the year, the
company said in a presentation today.  Galp used its refineries at about 63 percent of capacity in
the quarter. The company processed 15 percent less crude, while
the volume of its refined-product sales fell 5.1 percent. Its
refinery in Oporto can process about 90,000 barrels a day, while
the Sines plant has a 220,000-barrel-a-day capacity.  The refining margin, a measure of profit from converting
crude into fuels, widened to $2.30 a barrel in the quarter from
$0.90 a year earlier.    Santos Basin   Galp’s fourth-quarter average working production climbed 14
percent to 20,100 barrels a day, while average net entitlement
output rose 17 percent to 14,300 barrels a day, helped by the
Tombua-Landana field in Angola. Galp estimates gross output at
that project will be about 60,000 barrels a day in 2011.  The company targets total working crude production of
20,000 barrels a day for the first quarter.  Galp said proved and probable reserves, on a net
entitlement basis, were 397 million barrels of oil and natural
gas at the end of last year, compared with 35 million barrels at
the end of 2009, after adding Brazilian fields. In Angola, the
volume of reserves fell to 20 million barrels from 35 million
barrels. Galp’s contingent resources fell to 2,356 million
barrels from 3,065 million barrels at the end of 2009.  In  Brazil , the company has stakes in four offshore blocks
in the Santos Basin, including the Lula and Jupiter finds.
Petrobras is developing offshore deposits that include the
Americas’ two largest oil discoveries since  Mexico ’s Cantarell
field in 1976.  The Lula field, formerly known as Tupi, holds an estimated
6.5 billion barrels of recoverable oil and equivalents. Galp is
also a partner of Petrobras at Cernambi, which holds 1.8 billion
barrels of estimated reserves.  To contact the reporter on this story:
