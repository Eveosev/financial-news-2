Asian currencies dropped this week,
led by  South Korea ’s won, as global funds trimmed holdings of
regional shares on concern economic growth and corporate
earnings will be hurt by interest-rate increases.  Overseas investors pulled $3.8 billion from stock markets
in South Korea,  Taiwan  and Thailand during the week, exchange
data show. China’s central bank raised interest rates for the
third time in four months, joining  India , Indonesia, South  Korea 
and Thailand in having boosted borrowing costs this year to tame
inflation. Vietnam devalued the dong by about 7 percent
yesterday, the most since at least 1993, to help rein in the
nation’s trade deficit.  “What’s been driving currencies lower in  Asia  is a bit of
a sell-off in equity markets, reflecting concerns of tightening
policy and rising inflation,” said  Brian Jackson , a Hong Kong-
based senior strategist at Royal Bank of Canada. “People are
focusing on higher  interest rates  making it difficult for some
companies to borrow and this leads to lower equities and a
weaker currency.”  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the
region’s 10 most-traded currencies excluding the yen, fell 0.3
percent during the week. The won slumped 2.2 percent to 1,128.47
per dollar and the  Singapore  dollar slid 0.9 percent to S$1.2851,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Malaysia’s ringgit
slipped 0.9 percent to 3.0575.  Dong Devaluation  Vietnam’s dong slid to a record low against the  U.S. dollar 
after the central bank devalued the currency for the fourth time
in 15 months. The dong dropped 6.6 percent to 20,875 per dollar
yesterday. The State Bank of  Vietnam  said yesterday that it will
fix the reference rate for the currency at 20,693 versus 18,932
on Feb. 10. It also narrowed the trading band to 1 percent on
either side of the rate from 3 percent before.  The won touched a one-month low of 1,128.70 yesterday
after the Bank of Korea reported producer-price inflation
accelerated to a two-year high of 6.2 percent in January and
unexpectedly held off from raising interest rates. Nine of 12
economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast the seven-day
repurchase rate would be raised by a quarter of a percentage
point from its current level of 2.75 percent. Three predicted no
change.  “Markets don’t like monetary-policy surprises and this was
a surprise,” said  Tim Condon , the head of Asian research in
Singapore at ING Groep NV, the largest Dutch financial services
company. “Most people were anticipating a rate hike. Korea has
an inflation problem.”  Fund Repatriation  The ringgit retreated from a 13-year high of 3.0290 per
dollar recorded on Feb. 4 as government data showed industrial
output moderated in December. Production gained 4.2 percent from
a year earlier, compared with a revised 5.4 percent the previous
month.  “The market is concerned about the impact of policy
tightening in  China , with central banks in Southeast Asia likely
to follow suit,” said Akira Banno, a treasury adviser at Bank
of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. “Fund
repatriation out of stock markets has been a strong factor
affecting the ringgit.”  Indonesia’s rupiah strengthened 0.5 percent this week to
8,948 per dollar after the government reported the fastest
economic growth in six years. Gross domestic product rose 6.9
percent from a year earlier in the fourth quarter, the most
since 2004.  Elsewhere, the Philippine peso slid 0.1 percent to 43.815
per dollar and India’s rupee lost 0.2 percent to 45.69. Taiwan’s
dollar declined 0.1 percent to NT$29.23, while China’s yuan was
little changed at 6.5919.  To contact the reporters on this story:
