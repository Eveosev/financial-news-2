Emerging-market assets will post
single digit returns and underperform developed peers this year

according to  RBC Capital Markets .  Investors will move money out of Brazil, Russia, India and
China and shift funds to Mexican and Chilean pesos, the Polish
zloty and the South Korean won, RBC analysts including Nick Chamie, head of emerging-markets research in Toronto, said in an
e-mailed research note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
