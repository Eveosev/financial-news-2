The 240-year-old Moscow prison where
Hermitage Capital lawyer Sergei Magnitsky died in 2009 will open
a tanning parlor next month to boost morale among inmates who
rarely see the sun.  “There just isn’t enough sunlight at the  Butyrk a,” Sergei
Tsygankov, a spokesman for the Moscow branch of the Federal
Penitentiary Service, by phone today. “Ultraviolet rays are
needed at the pretrial facility.”  President  Dmitry Medvedev  in September urged lawmakers to
approve “softer” forms of detention for people who haven’t
been convicted of a crime, after several died in police custody.
Magnitsky spent almost a year in Butyrka, during which he said
he was abused and denied medical treatment to force him to drop
fraud allegations against officials. His death sparked outrage
from Europe Union lawmakers, who called for visa bans on
Russians involved in the case.  The tanning beds will be available to all of Butyrka’s
1,700 inmates who can afford the service, which costs 10 rubles
(34 U.S. cents) a minute.  “If a suspect is used to tanning, he may visit the parlor
since he hasn’t been convicted yet,” Tsygankov said. All of
Moscow’s pretrial facilities now offer amenities such as fitness
rooms and  Internet access  but the tanning beds are an experiment
unique to Butyrka, Tsygankov said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
