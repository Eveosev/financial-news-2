The European Union will urge the
Group of 20 nations to find ways to make major emerging-market
currencies such as  China ’s yuan more convertible on foreign-
exchange markets.  “On the diversification of reserve assets, we should
explore how the internationalization of the key emerging-market
currencies can be best progressed,” according to a document
prepared for EU policy makers attending a meeting of G-20
finance officials next week in Paris. “This could also
contribute to a more multi-polar system.”  The comments underline the pressure on China to make its  exchange rate  more flexible. The U.S. Treasury Department on
Feb. 5 said China had made “insufficient” progress in allowing
its currency to rise and said the yuan remains “substantially
undervalued.”  The 27-member EU also will urge the G-20 to look at
including more currencies in the basket that form special
drawing rights at the  International Monetary Fund , though
controls on the use of SDRs should be kept strict, according to
the document, which was obtained by Bloomberg News.  “The EU could agree to explore in more depth whether a
limited number of currencies of systemically important countries
should over time be added to the SDR basket to reflect global
economic realities,” according to the paper, which was prepared
by senior officials from EU finance ministries. Care should be
taken in their use because “regular unconditional allocations
of SDRs could risk moral hazard as countries would have
permanent access to low interest rate liquidity.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
