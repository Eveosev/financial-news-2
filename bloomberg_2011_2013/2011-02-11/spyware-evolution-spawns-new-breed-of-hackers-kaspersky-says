Hackers across the globe are taking
cyber crime to a new level, using social networks to collect
personal information and steal people’s identities, according to
Kaspersky Lab,  Russia ’s largest anti-virus software developer.  A “new breed” of cyber criminals is targeting personal
information beyond the traditional data for credit cards, Kurt
Baumgartner, a senior security researcher at Kaspersky, said at
a company-sponsored conference in Moscow today. A new generation
of malware targets every piece of data that can be stolen.  “This year will be more of a turning point,” Baumgartner
said. The aim of the new spyware “is to steal everything,
whether it’s your hair color, your eye color, whom you know,
where you are and creating data warehouses to maintain an
exchange of this information about you.”  Publishing streams of data from embassy cables by Julian Assange’s WikiLeaks will further motivate criminals seeking gain
through publicizing private information.  “You should take WikiLeaks very personally even if you
were not affected directly,” Stefan Tanase, senior security
researcher at Kaspersky, said at the same conference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
