Hungarian Prime Minister  Viktor Orban ’s ruling Fidesz party lost support this month,
Nepszabadsag  reported , citing an Ipsos poll.  Fidesz had 31 percent backing among all eligible voters,
the lowest since winning elections in April, compared with 34
percent last month, the Budapest-based newspaper said today,
citing Ipsos. Support rose to 12 percent from 11 percent for the
Socialist Party, the biggest opposition group, while 44 percent
were undecided or said they didn’t plan to vote, it said.  Ipsos surveyed 1,500 voting-age Hungarians between Feb. 1-

2.5 percentage point margin of error.  To contact the reporter on this story:
