The benchmark index for U.S. stock
options dropped to a four-week low as U.S. stocks extended a
second straight weekly gain after Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak  resigned and  consumer confidence  rose.  The VIX, as the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility
Index is known, fell 2.5 percent to 15.69 today. The gauge fell
to an intraday low of 15.55 at 11:03 a.m., minutes after Mubarak
stepped down. That’s close to the three-year closing low of
15.45 in December. The index measures the cost of using options
as insurance against declines in the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index, which rose 0.6 percent to 1,329.15.  Benchmark indexes began erasing an early slide after the
Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary index of
consumer sentiment for the month climbed to an eight-month high
of 75.1. Stocks extended gains as Mubarak bowed to the demands
of protesters that have occupied central Cairo for the past
three weeks demanding an end to his 30-year rule. He handed
power to the nation’s military.  VIX futures dropped. The most-traded contracts were the
March futures, which declined 1.4 percent to 18.05. The most-
active VIX options were the March $22.50 calls, which fell 8.2
percent to 78 cents.  In  Europe , the benchmark gauge of stock-market volatility
rose for a second day. The  VStoxx Index , which measures the cost
of protecting against a decline in shares on the Euro Stoxx 50
Index, gained 1 percent to close at 19.95 in Frankfurt. The Euro
Stoxx 50 stock index advanced fell less than 0.1 percent to
3,024.37.  To contact the reporter on this story:
