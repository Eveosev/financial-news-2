Italy’s benchmark  FTSE MIB Index 
slipped 1 percent to 22,379.19 at 11:13 a.m. in Milan, dropping
for a fourth day. The measure has fallen 1.1 percent this week.  The following stocks were among the most active in the
Italian market today.  Mittel SpA (MIT IM) slipped 0.7 percent to 3.08 euros. The
Italian holding company posted a loss of 200,000 euros in its
first fiscal quarter versus a profit a year earlier.    STMicroelectronics NV  (STM IM), a chipmaker with clients
including Nokia Oyj, slid 3.7 percent to 8.57 euros. Nokia,
which is forming a software partnership with Microsoft Corp.,
fell after the company’s plan to move to Microsoft’s Windows as
its primary software platform was seen as a sign of the depth of
its challenge taking on Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android
platforms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
