Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in Indonesian trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of the 4 p.m. Jakarta-time close.  The  Jakarta Composite index  advanced 18.12 points, or 0.5
percent, to 3,391.77, rising for the first time in five days.
The measure has fallen 3 percent this week.  PT Adaro Energy (ADRO IJ), Indonesia’s second-largest coal
mining company, gained 3.3 percent to 2,375 rupiah. PT Semen
Gresik, the nation’s biggest cement producer, may seek
additional coal supply of 2 million tons for its new plants,  Bisnis Indonesia  reported, citing Semen Gresik Finance Director
Cholil Hasan. Adaro is one of Semen Gresik’s coal suppliers, the
report said. Hasan couldn’t be reached when called at his office.  PT Garuda Indonesia (GIAA IJ),  Indonesia ’s biggest airline,
dropped 17 percent to 620 rupiah on its first day of trading in
Jakarta. The company said Jan. 26 it sold 6.4 billion shares at
750 rupiah each, the bottom of the price range at which the
shares were offered.  “Investors see an increase in global  oil prices  impacting
Garuda’s profit,” said Norico Gaman, head of research at PT BNI
Securities in Jakarta. “Garuda can’t increase ticket prices or
it won’t be competitive with other airlines. That’s why
investors see the fair price for Garuda shares between 500 and
600 rupiah.”  PT International Nickel Indonesia (INCO IJ), the nation’s
biggest producer of the metal, fell 2 percent to 5,000 rupiah,
the biggest drag on the Jakarta Mining Index today. Nickel for
three-month delivery declined yesterday by the most since Dec.
23, losing 1.9 percent to $27,850 a metric ton in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
