OAO Sberbank,  Russia ’s largest bank,
rallied the most in almost four months after earnings more than
doubled in January as the lender cut reserves against bad debt.  Sberbank rose as much as 4.8 percent to 101.06 rubles and
traded at 100.86 rubles as of 6:04 p.m. on Moscow’s Micex stock
exchange. That’s the steepest intraday jump since Oct. 21, when
the stock increased 6.1 percent. The 30-stock  Micex index  was up
2.2 percent today.  Net income under Russian accounting standards climbed to
26.7 billion rubles ($910 million) last month. Sberbank set
aside 5 billion rubles for bad loans, down from 20 billion in
the same period last year, according to a statement on its
website. Net interest income for January rose 0.6 percent and
net fees and commissions by 17 percent, the bank said.  “We view the published results as strong,” TKB Capital
said in an e-mailed note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
