Robusta coffee prices in  London  are
attracting sales offers from Vietnam, the world’s largest
grower, Hamburg-based coffee brokerage Eugen Atte GmbH said.  The NYSE Liffe coffee price was $140 a metric ton over the
bean selling price in Vietnam yesterday, up from $120 a ton on
Jan. 27, Atte said in a report e-mailed today and dated
yesterday. Robusta coffee prices in London have climbed 7.4
percent this year.  “Exporters like to take advantage of the higher Liffe
market,” Atte said in the report. Beans are being offered at
“differentials next to tenderable parity,” meaning sellers are
starting to break even.  Tenderable parity corresponds to the costs sellers have to
bring coffee from Vietnam and sell it on NYSE Liffe.  “We are going to see more flow of robusta from January to
June,”  Andrea Thompson , an analyst at CoffeeNetwork in  Belfast ,  Northern Ireland , said by telephone today. Coffee exports from
Vietnam may rise about 9.4 percent to 1.28 million tons this
calendar year, the  government  forecast Feb. 9.  Production in the 2010-11 crop year, which began Oct. 1,
will rise 4.6 percent to about 1.12 million tons, while planted
area expanded 1.8 percent to 548,200 hectares (1.35 million
acres), the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
