  Grifols SA ,  Europe ’s largest maker
of blood-plasma products, said it agreed to give the U.S.
Federal Trade Commission at least 30 days’ notice of the closing
date for its $3.6 billion purchase of Talecris Biotherapeutics
Holding Corp.  The transaction won’t close before March 21, the Barcelona-
based company said in a regulatory  filing  today.  Grifols agreed with U.S. regulators last week to extend the
deadline for antitrust approval of the purchase until March 6,
according to a Feb. 4 filing.  “The scenario hasn’t really changed,” Luis Navia, a
Madrid-based analyst at Espirito Santo Research, said by phone
today. “We still have to wait for the FTC’s decision, which is
the most important.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
