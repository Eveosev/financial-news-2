Canadian natural gas for March
delivery fell as forecasts of warmer-than-normal weather in U.S.
consuming regions reduced demand for exports from  Canada .  Temperatures will be above average in the U.S. East and
Midwest from Feb. 16 to Feb. 20, the National Weather Service
reported. U.S. heating demand will be 18 percent below normal
levels from Feb. 12 to Feb. 18, according to Weather Derivatives
in Belton,  Missouri .  Alberta gas for March fell 6 cents, or 1.8 percent, to
C$3.195 per gigajoule (about $3.06 per million British thermal
units) as of 2:40 p.m. New York time, according to  NGX,  a
Canadian Internet market. Gas traded on the exchange is shipped
to users in Canada and the U.S. Northeast, Midwest and West
Coast.  Gas at the Alliance Pipeline delivery point near  Chicago 
dropped 20.63 cents, or 4.8 percent, to $4.0586 per million Btu
on the  Intercontinental Exchange , the lowest price since Nov.
19. Alliance is an express line that can carry about 1.5 billion
cubic feet a day to the Midwest from western Canada.  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, prices slipped 3.2 percent to $3.6849 per million Btu,
the lowest price since Nov. 8, according to ICE. At Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded for California markets, gas
fell 2.5 percent to $3.8045.  NYME Trading  Natural gas for March delivery fell 7.6 cents, or 1.9
percent, to settle at $3.91 per million Btu on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange .  The U.S. Northeast and Midwest account for about 64 percent
of Canada’s gas export, according to the National Energy Board
of Canada.  Canada exported 3.255 trillion cubic feet of gas in 2009,
55 percent of total production, according to  the Canadian Gas
Association .  Volume on  TransCanada Corp. ’s  Alberta  system, the biggest
gas-gathering network in the nation, was 16.4 billion cubic
feet. Volume on the system dropped by 666 million cubic feet in
the past four hours.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 4.22 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 1.81 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity  on TransCanada’s British Columbia
system, which carries gas to the U.S. border at Eastport, Idaho,
was 704 million cubic feet. The system was forecast to carry
2.06 billion cubic feet today, about 74 percent of capacity.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.92
billion cubic feet at 1:20 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
