Philippine three-year bonds declined
for a second week as policy makers raised inflation assessments
for this year and next.  The central bank raised its 2011 inflation forecast
yesterday to 4.4 percent from 3.6 percent and boosted the 2012
estimate to 3.5 percent from 3 percent. The monetary authority
kept borrowing costs at a record-low 4 percent for a 14th
straight meeting yesterday. Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Deputy
Governor Diwa Guinigundo said after the decision in  Manila  that
there’s enough policy “toolkit” in place to fight inflation.  “With the adjustment in the 2011 and 2012 targets by the
central bank, it signals they are expecting inflation to
accelerate,” said Rafael Algarra, a treasurer at Security Bank
Corp. in Manila. “If they don’t let  interest rates  go up to
combat imported inflation they may allow appreciation of the
currency.”  The yield on the 6.25 percent bond due January 2014
increased 27.5 basis points during the week to 5.35 percent as
of 4:08 p.m. in Manila, according to Tradition Financial
Services. The rate fell 15 basis points from yesterday. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  The peso slipped 0.3 percent today to 43.815 per dollar,
according to prices from inter-dealer broker Tullett Prebon Plc.
It dropped 0.1 percent this week.  Overseas investors sold $48 million more local stocks than
they bought this week, bringing net sales so far this month to
$88 million, according to exchange data.  To contact the reporter for this story:
