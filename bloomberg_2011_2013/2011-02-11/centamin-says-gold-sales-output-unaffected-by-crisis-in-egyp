  Centamin Egypt Ltd ., a gold company
operating in the North African nation where protesters have
taken to the streets demanding the overthrow of the president,
said production hasn’t been affected by the political turmoil.  “We can reassure and confirm that production and gold
sales continue as normal,” spokesman Bobby Morse said by phone
from London today.  Centamin slipped as much as 8.6 percent in London trading,
the most in three weeks, as political instability in  Egypt 
continued. Shares in the company were down 5.6 pence, or 4
percent, at 134.4 pence at 11:58 a.m. in London, extending the
decline this year to 24 percent.  Egypt’s default risk jumped the most in more than a week
and the country’s bonds sank as President Hosni Mubarak
yesterday defied calls for his immediate resignation after more
than two weeks of protests.  To contact the reporter on this story:
