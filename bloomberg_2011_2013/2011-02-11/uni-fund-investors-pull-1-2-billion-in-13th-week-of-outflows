Investors withdrew about $1.2
billion from U.S. municipal-bond mutual funds this week, the
13th-straight period of withdrawals, Lipper US Fund Flows said.  Outflows have totaled $24.8 billion since mid-November,
according to data released yesterday by  Lipper , a Denver-based
research company. The $1.1 billion that investors took out in
the week ended Feb. 2 was the least in two months, Lipper said.  “Outflows are beginning to subside,” said Justin Hoogendoorn, director of capital markets at BMO Capital Markets
in  Chicago .  Investors pulled $4 billion in the week ended Jan. 19, the
most since Lipper started compiling data in 1992.  Some investors exited the $2.86 trillion municipal  debt
market  amid a prediction of municipal defaults amounting to
“hundreds of billions of dollars” by  Meredith Whitney , an
analyst who correctly projected Citigroup Inc.’s dividend cut
two years ago. She spoke Dec. 19 on CBS Corp.’s “60 Minutes.”  In the wake of the national recession, 44 states face a
combined $125 billion of budget deficits next fiscal year,
according to a study by the Washington-based Center on Budget
and Policy Priorities, a nonprofit group focused on issues
affecting lower-income Americans.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Matt Robinson  in New York at
