  Duratex SA , a Brazilian producer of
wood panels and bathroom fixtures, rose the most in nine months
after being rated “outperform” in new coverage at JPMorgan
Chase & Co.  Duratex climbed 5.3 percent to 16.30 reais at 3:15 p.m. New
York time, the biggest gain since May. The Bovespa index
advanced 1.8 percent to 65,755.66.    Brazil ’s growing housing market and incomes are likely to
be the main drivers for Duratex’s sales, Debbie Bobovnikova and
Lucas Ferreira, analysts at JPMorgan, wrote in a note to clients
dated today. Investors have already accounted for higher
borrowing costs as the central bank works to curb inflation, the
analysts said.  “Interest-rate headwinds are largely priced in and make
for an attractive entry point,” Bobovnikova and Ferreira wrote.  Yields on interest-rate futures contracts indicate that
investors expect rates to end the year at 13 percent. Duratex
fell 13 percent this year through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
