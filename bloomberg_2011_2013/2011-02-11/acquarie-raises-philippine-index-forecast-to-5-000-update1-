Macquarie Group Ltd. is raising its
forecast for the Philippine Stock Exchange Index even as concern
over accelerating inflation dragged the market to the world’s
third-worst performance this year.  The benchmark Philippine  stock index  may rally to 5,000
over the next 12 months, compared with a previous forecast of
4,500, said Alex Pomento, a Manila-based strategist at
Macquarie, citing a “stable” economy and the potential for
earnings “upgrades.”  The Philippine index has dropped 15 percent since reaching
an all-time high on Nov. 4 amid speculation rising food, oil and
transportation costs will spur policy makers to lift  interest
rates  from a record low. It’s the worst performer this year
after benchmark gauges for India and  Egypt  among 90 measures
tracked by Bloomberg globally.  “The correction driven by fears of rising inflation is
overdone and has made valuations cheap,” Pomento said in an
interview. “Philippine fundamentals have not changed
significantly to merit the market correction.”  The index gained 0.3 percent to 3,749.15 at the noon close
of trading today in  Manila , trimming its 2011 loss to 11
percent. The gauge is valued at 12.2 times reported earnings and
last week traded at the lowest compared with the MSCI Emerging
Markets Index since August. Its multiple relative to estimated
earnings is 12.1 times, the lowest in a year.  Macquarie’s forecast for the Philippine stock index
represents a rally of 33 percent over the next 12 months. An
advance to 5,000 would lift the measure’s valuations to 13 times
this year’s forecast earnings, the lower end of the 10 times to
18 times range for the gauge over the past decade, according to
Pomento.  To contact the reporter on this story:
