  Carillion Plc , which manages
buildings for companies including BT Group Plc, said it agreed
on a cash offer for  Eaga Plc  valuing the energy-services company
at about 306.5 million pounds ($492 million).  Carillion said it’s offering 120 pence per share, which
takes into account Eaga’s interim dividend, for the Newcastle
Upon Tyne-based company. The new entity would have support-
services sales of about 3 billion pounds, Carillion said in a
statement on Regulatory News Service.  Last October, Carillion predicted that its support services
sales would grow to twice that of U.K. construction as the
government outsources more work. Eaga said Feb. 3 it had been
approached by an “independent strategic party.”  “The acquisition brings together two complementary
companies, enhancing Carillion’s position as one of the U.K.’s
leading support services  companies,” Carillion Chairman Philip Rogerson said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
