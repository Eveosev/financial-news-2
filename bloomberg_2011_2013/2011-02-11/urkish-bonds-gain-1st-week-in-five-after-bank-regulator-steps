Turkish bonds gained on bets that an
increase by the industry regulator in provisions for banks’ non-
performing loans may mean the central bank won’t hike reserve
requirements that have caused banks to raise funds by selling
bonds.  Bonds strengthened, with yields on benchmark two-year lira
bonds falling 14 basis points to 8.36 percent at 3:12 p.m. in
Istanbul, heading for the first weekly decline in five weeks.  Turkey’s banking regulator said today that it will end an
exemption on provisioning for non-performing loans introduced in
2009. The exemption will end on March 1, the Ankara-based
regulator said in a statement on its website.  The step by the watchdog probably means the central bank
won’t increase reserve requirements for the third time since the
start of December when its Monetary Policy Committee meets on
Feb. 15, Fatih Keresteci, a strategist at HSBC Holdings Plc in
Istanbul, said in a telephone interview today.  Turkish bond yields have risen as much as 165 basis points
from a record low of 6.9 percent on Jan. 5.  Non-performing loans were 19.9 billion liras ($12.5
billion) at the end of 2010, decreasing from a record 21.9
billion liras the previous year, according to data published by
the regulator on its web site.  The lira declined 0.1 percent to 1.5933 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
