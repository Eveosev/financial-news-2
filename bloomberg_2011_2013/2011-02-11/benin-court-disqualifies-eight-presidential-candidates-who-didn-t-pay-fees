Benin’s Constitutional Court
disqualified eight candidates from contesting the Feb. 27
presidential election after they didn’t pay fees to enter the
race, said Robert Dossou, president of the body.  The candidates are required to pay 15 million CFA francs,
he told reporters in Cotonou, the commercial capital, today. The
court approved the application of 15 candidates, he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
