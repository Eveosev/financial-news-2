Inflation in  Germany ,  Europe ’s
largest economy, accelerated to the fastest in more than two
years in January, led by higher costs for food and energy.  The inflation rate, calculated using a harmonized European
method, increased to 2 percent after rising an annual 1.9
percent in December, the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden
said today, confirming an initial estimate published on Jan. 27.
That’s the fastest since October 2008. In the month, consumer
prices fell 0.5 percent after rising 1.2 percent in December.  German companies have stepped up hiring and output to meet
both increasing export orders and reviving domestic demand,
fueling the economy’s fastest expansion on record last year.
With unemployment at the lowest in almost two decades, companies
may find it easier to pass on higher energy costs just as labor
unions seek to push through more pay.  “There have been some commodity-price increases, but they
are not yet visible in the core rate,” said Gebhard Stadler, an
economist at BayernLB in Munich. “The German economy is looking
very good at the moment.”  Non-harmonized inflation accelerated to 2 percent in
January from 1.7 percent, today’s report showed. In the month,
prices decreased 0.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
