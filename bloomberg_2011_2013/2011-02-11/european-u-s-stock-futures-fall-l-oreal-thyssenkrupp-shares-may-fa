European stocks rose as Egyptian
President  Hosni Mubarak  resigned with immediate effect and  consumer confidence  in the U.S. rose in February, showing that
the recovery in the world’s largest economy is strengthening.  Michelin & Cie. climbed 3.7 percent as the world’s second-
largest tiremaker announced that full-year profit exceeded
analysts’ projections. Nokia tumbled 14 percent after announcing
that it will make phones for Microsoft Corp.’s mobile operating
system.  L’Oreal SA  sank 4.2 percent after the world’s largest
cosmetics maker reported profit that failed to beat analysts’
estimates.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index gained 0.4 percent to 287.99 at
the 4:30 p.m. close in  London , extending its climb to 0.7
percent this week. The gauge reached the highest level since
September 2008 earlier this week, pushing the measure to about
16 times the reported earnings of its companies, near the
highest level in nine months, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “The announcement of Mubarak’s resignation is good news,”
said Markus Huber, the head of German sales trading at ETX
Capital in London. “It has removed some of the uncertainty in
the region and has triggered a market rally, even though the
transition could still take a fair amount of time.”  European stocks extended their gains as Mubarak stepped
down as president of  Egypt  and handed power to the military,
bowing to the demands of protesters who have occupied Tahrir
Square in central Cairo for the past few weeks. Egyptians
streamed out of Friday prayers today vowing to topple Mubarak
after he yesterday defied calls to resign.  Mubarak Quits Presidency  “Mubarak has decided to relinquish the office of the
presidency,” said Vice President  Omar Suleiman  in a statement
on state television today. “He has instructed the Supreme
Council of the armed forces to take over the affairs of the
country.”  In the U.S., the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan
preliminary February index of consumer sentiment rose to 75.1
from 74.2 in January, in line with average economist projection
of 75 in a Bloomberg News survey.  Some 74 percent of the 348 companies in the  S&P 500  that
have reported results since Jan. 10 topped per-share earnings
projections, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In Europe,
56 percent beat forecasts, the data show.  National benchmark indexes climbed in 12 of the 18 western
European markets. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index increased 0.7
percent and  Germany ’s DAX Index added 0.4 percent, while  France ’s CAC 40 Index rose 0.2 percent.  Michelin, Nokia  Michelin jumped 3.7 percent to 59.18 euros, leading makers
of autos and car parts higher in the Stoxx 600. The tiremaker
reported 2010 net income of 1.05 billion euros ($1.42 billion),
exceeding the average analyst estimate of 911 million euros.  Michelin also named Jean-Dominique Senard to succeed Michel Rollier as chief executive officer. Rollier, 67, will hand over
the CEO post to Senard, 58, in the coming months, following a
vote by shareholders at an extraordinary meeting on May 13.
Senard joined Michelin in 2005 as finance chief.  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG and Daimler AG, the world’s
biggest makers of luxury cars, surged 2.3 percent to 63.14 euros
and 1.9 percent to 56.51 euros, respectively. Volkswagen AG,  Europe ’s largest carmaker, increased 2.6 percent to 128.20
euros. The company said group deliveries rose 20 percent in
January on demand from  China ,  India  and Latin America.  Nokia plunged 14 percent to 7 euros, its largest decline in
18 months, after the world’s biggest maker of mobile phones
announced that it will use Microsoft’s Windows Phone as its
primary software platform -- a sign of the depth of the
challenge in taking on Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android.  L’Oreal, ThyssenKrupp  L’Oreal declined 4.2 percent to 85.72 euros after the maker
of Maybelline lipstick posted 2010 net income that rose to 2.24
billion euros from 1.79 billion euros a year earlier. That
missed the average profit estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg for 2.27 billion euros. UBS AG downgraded the shares
to “neutral” from “buy,” saying the results were “slightly
disappointing.”    ThyssenKrupp AG  fell 2.7 percent to 30.29 euros as
Germany’s largest steelmaker predicted that it will post a wider
full-year loss at its Steel Americas unit than it previously
forecast.    Ocado Group Plc  sank 11 percent to 255 pence, the largest
decline since its initial public offering last July, as John
Lewis Partnership Pensions Trust sold its entire stake in the
online grocer at 265 pence a share. The pension fund was Ocado’s
second-biggest shareholder.  To contact the reporter on this story:
