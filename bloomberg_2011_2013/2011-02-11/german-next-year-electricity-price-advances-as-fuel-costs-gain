German electricity for delivery next
year gained as rising fuel prices signaled more expensive
generation costs for utilities in  Europe ’s biggest market.  Baseload power for 2012, the regional benchmark contract,
increased 50 cents, or 1 percent, to 52.40 euros ($71.30),
according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg at 6:25 p.m.
Berlin time. That’s the highest since Feb. 7. Baseload is
delivered around the clock.  Hard coal for next-year delivery to Amsterdam, Rotterdam or
Antwerp rose for a second day, gaining as much as 0.4 percent to
$118.50 a ton. The fuel accounted for 18 percent of Germany’s
power generation in 2009.  Germany  also produces electricity from
lignite, or brown coal, as well as natural gas, nuclear, wind
and solar plants.  Bloomberg tracks power prices from brokers including GFI
Group Inc., ICAP Plc, Spectron Group Ltd., Tradition and Tullet
Prebon Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
