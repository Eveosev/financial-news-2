  Total SA , Europe’s biggest refiner,
said  Petroplus Holdings AG  is one of three candidates to buy its
Lindsey plant in the U.K.  Petroplus is one of three candidates, said Jean-Jacques Mosconi, Total’s head of strategy and economic intelligence, at
a presentation today of fourth-quarter results.  Total is aiming to lower European refining capacity to 1.8
million barrels of oil a day this year from 2 million barrels a
day in 2010, according to the Paris-based company. The target
includes the sale of Lindsey, as well as a dismantling of the
Flanders refinery near Dunkirk, France, and lower output at its
Normandy plant.  “Is it easy to sell a refinery today?” said Chief
Executive Officer Christophe de Margerie. “The answer is no,”
he said, adding that he wants a deal this year.  A sale of Lindsey would cover the company’s goal of
reducing capacity by 500,000 barrels a day, he said, referring
to a drop from 2006. “We have no other targets. In  France  we
have pledged not to sell a refinery for five years and we will
respect this.”  In  Asia , including  China , Total is in talks for “more than
one possible industrial investment,” said Michel Benezit, head
of refining at the company. The partnerships would be three-way,
including one local producer.  Total today reported fourth-quarter refinery throughput
fell 11 percent from a year earlier mainly due to strikes at
plants in France and a shutdown of a distillation unit at
Lindsey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
