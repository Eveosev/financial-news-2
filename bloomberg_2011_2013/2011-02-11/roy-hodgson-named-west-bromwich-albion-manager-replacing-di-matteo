  Roy Hodgson  was named manager of
West Bromwich Albion, taking over for the fired Roberto Di Matteo as the English club fights to avoid relegation from the
Premier League.  Hodgson signed a contract until June 2012, West Brom said
in a  statement  on its website. The 63-year-old left as Liverpool
manager on Jan. 8 after just six months.  Di Matteo was fired five days ago after a run of 13 defeats
in 18 games. West Brom is 17th in the Premier League, above the
three-team relegation positions on goal difference. The team is
in its first season back in the top division after being
promoted from the second-tier Championship last year.  Michael Appleton, who was appointed interim manager when Di
Matteo was fired, will remain in charge for tomorrow’s home game
against West Ham, West Brom said.  Hodgson was hired at Liverpool in July after leading Fulham
to the final of the Europa League last season.  The Reds won just 7 of 20 Premier League matches and were
12th in the standings, 19 points behind leader Manchester
United, when Hodgson left by what the club said was “mutual
consent.”  Hodgson has also coached in the Premier League at Blackburn
Rovers. His career also includes spells at Inter Milan, Bristol
City and Udinese as well as coaching the national teams of  Switzerland  -- guiding the country to the 1994  World Cup  --
Finland and the United Arab Emirates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
