Serbian Prime Minister  Mirko Cvetkovic  said the government will not risk the country’s
macroeconomic stability by accepting wage demands by unions that
have organized several strikes,  Vecernje Novosti  newspaper
reported.  “The exchange rate and inflation would spin out of
control” if authorities increase wages for thousands of
teachers, health workers and police officers, the newspaper
quoted Cvetkovic as saying in an interview. He also rejected
opposition calls for early parliamentary elections and dismissed
speculation in the local media that he offered his resignation
to President  Boris Tadic , the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
