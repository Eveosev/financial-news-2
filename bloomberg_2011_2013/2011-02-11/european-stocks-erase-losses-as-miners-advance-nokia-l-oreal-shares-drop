gains by basic-resource companies offset declines by Nokia Oyj
and L’Oreal SA. Asian shares and U.S. index futures fell.  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose less than 0.1
percent to 286.85 at 8:43 a.m. in  London , after earlier falling
as much as 0.5 percent. The gauge is up 0.3 percent this week.
The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.7 percent, while futures on
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.3 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:  David Merritt  at
