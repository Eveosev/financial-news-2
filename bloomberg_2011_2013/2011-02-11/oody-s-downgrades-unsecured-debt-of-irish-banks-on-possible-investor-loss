Bank of Ireland Plc and five other
Irish lenders had some senior debt ratings cut by Moody’s
Investors Service on concern that investors may be asked to
share the cost of saving the country’s financial system.  Bank of Ireland’s unguaranteed senior unsecured debt rating
was lowered to Ba1 from Baa2, Allied Irish Banks Plc was reduced
to Ba2 from Baa3 and Anglo Irish Bank Corp. was trimmed to Caa1
from Ba3, Moody’s said in a statement today. The ratings were
kept under review for further possible cuts.  Irish Finance Minister  Brian Lenihan  said on Feb. 7 that
the government is pressing for a “substantial discount” on 20
billion euros ($27.3 billion) of unsecured senior bank bonds.
Opposition political parties have also said they’ll seek
European agreement to share losses with some senior bank
bondholders after the Feb. 25 elections.  “While some of these statements may reflect the current
pre-election debate, Moody’s is increasingly concerned that they
represent a growing underlying threat for senior creditors,”
Moody’s said.  The government raised the issue with the European Union
during negotiations for its 85 billion-euro rescue package in
November only to be rebuffed by the  European Central Bank ,
Lenihan has said. Ireland has already injected about 46 billion
euros into its banks.  Moody’s also cut the ratings for EBS Building Society and
Irish Life & Permanent Plc to Ba2 from Baa3, and Irish  Nationwide Building Society  was lowered to Caa1 from Ba3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
