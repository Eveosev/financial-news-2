Corn traded near a 30-month high in
Chicago, heading for a second weekly advance, on increased
demand amid tight supply. Wheat and soybeans climbed.  Global corn stockpiles are expected to fall 16 percent to
122.5 million metric tons in the year through August, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said Feb. 9. It also predicted lower
Argentine output. U.S. exporters sold 1.1 million tons of the
grain in the week ended Feb. 3, up 51 percent from the prior
four-week average, the USDA said yesterday.  “USDA corn inventories and  Argentina ’s latest output
forecast were constantly cut on bad weather conditions,”
Jonathan Bouchet, an analyst at OTCex Group in Geneva, said in a
report today. “The market remains extremely tight.”  Corn for May delivery gained 1 cent, or 0.1 percent, to
$7.105 a bushel at 10:33 a.m. London time on the Chicago Board
of Trade. The grain is up 4.7 percent this week and yesterday
reached $7.15, the highest level for the most-active contract
since July 2008.  “Tight supply for corn and better-than-estimated export
sales helped boost gains,” Ker Chung Yang, an analyst at
Phillip Futures Pte, said by phone from  Singapore . Advances in
corn have a spillover effect on wheat, he said.  U.S. corn inventories before the harvest are forecast to
fall to the lowest in 15 years, Rabobank said in a report. Corn
will be the “upside leader” in agricultural commodities, it
said.  Wheat, Soybeans  Wheat for March delivery gained 5 cents, or 0.6 percent, to
$8.6775 a bushel, heading for a fourth weekly advance. The grain
has added 9.3 percent this year. Milling wheat for March
delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in Paris advanced 0.2 percent to
276.50 euros ($373.96) a ton.  Soybeans for March delivery rose 1.5 cents, or 0.1 percent
to $14.345 a bushel in  Chicago . The oilseed reached $14.5575,
the highest price for a most-active contract since July 2008, on
Feb. 9.  Rice for March delivery was little changed at $16.165 per
100 pounds. The grain reached $16.335, the highest level since
Nov. 5, 2008, on Feb. 9. It may track a rally in wheat prices as
consumers seek alternatives, according to Robert Zeigler,
director general of the International Rice Research Institute.  “If wheat production falls, people will have to substitute
with something in their diet,” Zeigler said in an interview on
Bloomberg Television today. “Rice is the easiest one.”  There are no signs of panic buying for now, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
