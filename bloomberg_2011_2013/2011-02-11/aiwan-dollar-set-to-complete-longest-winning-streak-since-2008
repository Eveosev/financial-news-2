  Taiwan ’s dollar had its biggest
daily decline this year as the island’s stock index dropped the
most in five months.  Bonds rose, with benchmark five-year yields falling the
most in a month, as investors sought the relative safety of
government debt. The Taiex stock index slid 2.6 percent, the
most since Aug. 25.  “On the debt side, the stocks slump helped support the  bond market  today,” said Samson Tu, who helps manage $1.6
billion of fixed-income securities in Taipei at Uni-President
Assets Management Corp. “The local dollar has been
outperforming regional currencies in the past few months.”  Taiwan’s dollar fell 0.4 percent to NT$29.230 against its
U.S. counterpart as of the 4 p.m. local time close, according to
Taipei Forex Inc. It was the biggest daily decline since Dec. 31.
The currency slipped 0.1 percent for the week, the first five-
day drop since November. It has strengthened 3.9 percent so far
this year, the best performance among  Asia ’s 10 most-traded
currencies.  The yield on the 1 percent bond due January 2016 fell three
basis points to 1.111 percent, the biggest decline since Jan. 3,
according to Gretai Securities Market. The yield gained five
basis points from 1.057 percent on Jan. 28. The market was
closed from Jan. 31 to Feb. 7 for the Lunar New Year holiday.  Exports rose 16.6 percent in January from a year earlier,
after climbing 19.1 percent the previous month, the government
reported today. That compared with the 15 percent median
forecast of economists in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
