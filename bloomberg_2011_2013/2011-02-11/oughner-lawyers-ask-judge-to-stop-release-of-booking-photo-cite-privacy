Federal prosecutors can drop two
charges against accused shooter Jared Lee Loughner for the
Tucson, Arizona, murders of U.S. District Judge John Roll and
Gabriel Zimmerman, an aide to Representative  Gabrielle Giffords .  U.S. District Judge Larry Alan Burns, who is presiding over
the case against Loughner, ordered the charges “dismissed
without prejudice to the government to later refile these
charges,” according to a court filing published today. The
order didn’t state a reason.  Robbie Sherwood, spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office
in Tucson, said Feb. 12 that prosecutors sought the dismissal to
give them more time to prepare charges which could bring the
death penalty.  “It was completely as expected,” Sherwood said in a
telephone interview. “It’s a formality to clear these
complaints off the books to make way for them to come back for a
superseding indictment.”    Judy Clarke , Loughner’s lead attorney, didn’t immediately
return a phone message.  Loughner, 22, pleaded not guilty to an indictment for the
attempted killing of Giffords and two other members of her staff
at a Jan. 8 community meeting outside a Tucson supermarket.
While separately charged in a complaint with the killing of Roll
and Zimmerman at the meeting, Loughner hasn’t been indicted on
those counts.  Federal law requires a defendant be indicted before a case
may proceed, giving prosecutors 30 days to seek one from a grand
jury.  The case is U.S. v. Loughner, 11-00187, U.S. District
Court, District of Arizona (Tucson).  To contact the reporter on this story:
