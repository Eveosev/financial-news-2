United Co. Rusal, the world’s
biggest aluminum producer, declined in  Hong Kong  trading after
the stock wasn’t included in the MSCI Russia Index.  Rusal fell as much as 5.5 percent after MSCI Inc.  said  it
didn’t make any changes to the index in its February review. On
Feb. 7, Rusal’s shares jumped to the highest since their debut
on Jan. 27, 2010, on speculation the Moscow-based company would
join the index, UralSib Financial Corp. said at the time.  The aluminum producer may still be included in the index
from May 16 after MSCI measures the liquidity of the company’s
Russian depositary receipts, VTB Capital said by e-mail today.  Rusal slid 34 cents, or 2.7 percent, to HK$12.48 by the 4
p.m. close of Hong Kong trading, the biggest drop since Jan. 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
