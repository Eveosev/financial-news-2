  BBVA Banco Frances SA , the Argentine
unit of  Spain ’s Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA, surged the
most in more than five weeks after reporting profit that
exceeded analysts’ estimates and proposing a dividend.  The Buenos Aires-based bank rose for the first time in
three days, gaining 5.3 percent to 15.80 pesos in Buenos Aires
trading, its steepest climb since Jan. 3.  The nation’s third-largest bank by revenue said today
fourth-quarter net income rose to 398 million pesos ($99
million), according to a regulatory filing. The bank also said
it may pay an 804 million-peso cash dividend, or about 1.50
pesos per share.  Banco Frances’s profit was higher than the 345 million
pesos forecast by Buenos Aires-based brokerage Allaria Ledesma &
Cia Soc. de Bolsa, while the dividend was twice what was
projected, analyst Guido Bizzozero said today in an e-mail.  The brokerage upgraded Banco Frances after the earnings
report to “buy” from “hold” with a 17.60 peso share price by
the end of the year, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
