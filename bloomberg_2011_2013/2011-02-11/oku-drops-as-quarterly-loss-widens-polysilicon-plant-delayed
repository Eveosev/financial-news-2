  Hoku Corp ., a solar power developer
and supplier, fell the most in almost six months, after its
third quarter loss widened and management raised their estimate
of costs to complete a polysilicon plant in Idaho.  Hoku dropped 14 cents, or 5.4 percent, to $2.44 as of 10:51
a.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Earlier it fell 8.1 percent
to $2.37, its biggest percentage decline since August 19. It has
retreated 7.6 percent this year.  For the quarter ended Dec. 31, Hoku’s loss was $3 million,
or 6 cents a share, more than double the $1.3 million, or 6
cents, a year earlier, Honolulu-based Hoku said in a statement
after the close of regular trading yesterday. Financing delays
slowed construction and increased costs for the polysilicon
plant it’s building in Pocatello,  Idaho ,  said Chief Executive
Officer Scott Paul.  “We are behind schedule, and we are over budget,” Paul
said in the statement. “We will experience approximately three
to six months of delays in completing construction of the first
2,500 metric tons of capacity.” The plant will eventually be
able to produce 4,000 metric tons of polysilicon a year.  Costs to complete the first phase of construction will be
about $600 million, and an additional $100 million will be
needed to reach full capacity, he said. In May the company said
it expected to spend about $400 million to reach capacity of
4,000 tons.  Hoku will “work with” customers regarding delays in
polysilicon deliveries, which he now expects will begin in the
second half of this year.  Tianwei New Energy Holdings Co., a Chinese integrated solar
product maker, in September 2009 bought a 60 percent stake in
Hoku Corp. and is its largest shareholder.  To contact the reporter on this story:
