  Volkswagen AG  vehicles are under
review by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration after reports of engines stalls, some at highway
speed, that may be related to fuel-pump failures.  The auto-safety regulator received reports of one accident
and 160 complaints from owners and the company about engine loss
of power and stalling,  NHTSA  said in a posting on its website
today. The power loss and stalling was related to high-pressure
pumps failing and contaminating the fuel system with debris, the
agency said.  About half of the reports involved stalling with “many of
these alleging stall incidents at highway speeds in traffic with
no restart,” the agency said.  NHTSA is reviewing model years 2009 and 2010 of the
Volkswagen Jetta and Golf and the Audi A3 that have TDI clean-  diesel engines , totaling about 97,272 vehicles.  The regulator, which received 52 of the complaints directly
and the rest through the Wolfsburg, Germany-based automaker,
upgraded its investigation to an engineering analysis, a step
that can lead to a recall.  “We take these matters very seriously and are cooperating
fully with NHTSA during its investigation,” Sheriece Matias, a
U.S.-based spokeswoman for Volkswagen, said in an e-mail. “We
will continue to work closely with the agency as the analysis
continues.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
