  Summer Infant Inc ., a maker of
infant health and safety products, is recalling 1.7 million
video baby monitors following two strangulation deaths, the U.S.
Consumer Product Safety Commission said.  The devices’ electrical cords can present a hazard to
infants and toddlers if placed too close to a crib, the CPSC
said. A 10-month-old girl from  Washington  died in her crib in
March 2010. In November, a six-month-old boy from Conway,  South
Carolina , became strangled in a cord of a monitor placed on a
changing table, the agency said today in an e-mailed statement.  The company is not offering to replace the products.
Consumers should call Summer Infant at 1-800-426-8627 to receive
a new warning label for electric cords and revised instructions,
the CPSC said.  Consumers should immediately check the location of video
monitors, including wall-mounted cameras, to make sure cords are
out of children’s reach, the agency said.  The Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based company sold the
monitors, manufactured in  China , at retailers nationwide for $60
to $300.  In a separate action, Summer Infant is recalling 58,000
Slim and Secure Video Monitors with rechargeable batteries after
reports the batteries can rupture, causing property damage, the
CPSC said.  The battery-operated monitors were sold at Babies “R” Us
stores from September 2009 to May 2010 for about $200, the CPSC
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
