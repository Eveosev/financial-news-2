  Zimbabwe  will probably approve
proposals from nine airlines to resume flights to the country,
the  Zimbabwe Independent  reported, citing Annajlia Hungwe,
spokeswoman for the  Civil Aviation Authority of Zimbabwe .  Air France, KLM, Austrian Airlines, Egypt Air, Swiss Air
AG, Bulgarian Airlines, Qantas Airways, Emirates Airline and
Lufthansa applied to fly to Zimbabwe again, the Harare-based
newspaper cited Hungwe as saying on its website.  Eighteen airlines stopped flights to Zimbabwe over the past
decade because of a political and economic crisis in the
southern African country, the newspaper said. Zimbabwe rejected
applications from airlines in  South Africa , Malaysia and the
United Arab Emirates in 2008, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
