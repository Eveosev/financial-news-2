  Hungary ’s main equity index snapped
three days of losses, rising from its lowest level in more than
five weeks. Mol Nyrt. gained after KBC Securities said the stock
is its “top pick” among central European refiners.  The BUX gauge of 12 companies rose 1.3 percent, the most in
a week, to 22,369.95 at the 5:06 p.m. close in Budapest, after
falling to its lowest since Jan. 4 yesterday. The index slid 3.8
percent this week, the most since the five days ended Nov. 26.  Mol, which has a 31 percent weighting in the BUX, added 1.3
percent to 21,625 forint, paring the week’s retreat to 4.3
percent. Hungary’s biggest oil company slumped to the lowest in
five weeks yesterday.  KBC kept its “buy” rating on Mol, according to a report
to clients today. The brokerage cut Mol’s Polish peers PKN Orlen
SA and Grupa Lotos SA to “sell” from “hold” in the note.  OTP Bank Nyrt., Hungary’s biggest lender, rose 1.7 percent
to 5,700 forint, snapping a three-day decline. Magyar Telekom
Nyrt., the country’s largest phone operator, advanced 1.1
percent to 537 forint after a 3.3 percent drop yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
