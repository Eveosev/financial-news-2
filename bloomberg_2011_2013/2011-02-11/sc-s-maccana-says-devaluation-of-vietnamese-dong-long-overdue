Fiachra MacCana, managing director
and head of research at  Ho Chi Minh City Securities Corp .,
comments on the devaluation of the Vietnamese dong in a
telephone interview.  The dong was devalued by about 7 percent today, the most
since at least 1993, as the government seeks to curb the
nation’s trade deficit. The  State Bank  of  Vietnam  fixed the
reference exchange rate to 20,693 dong per dollar from 18,932
yesterday and narrowed the trading band to 1 percent from 3
percent, according to a statement on its website.  “It’s long overdue to close the gap between the unofficial
markets and the official ceiling. The key point will be watching
the dong movements in the unofficial markets over the next few
days or weeks so see if they can bring the unofficial rate down
toward the new official ceiling.  “As far as the stock market is concerned, the rate has
been 21,000 for a couple of months already. It doesn’t change
the real economy. It’s a resurrection of normalcy in the  currency market . So the stock market should welcome it.  “It’s the local investors who worry about the currency
much more” than the foreign investors “because if there’s a
huge gap, then they focus more on arbitrage and the gold market.
When the gap is closed, the stock market suddenly becomes a more
reasonable investment.”  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
