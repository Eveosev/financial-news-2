  JJB Sports Plc , an unprofitable U.K.
sporting goods retailer, said its future depends on landlords
and unsecured creditors approving a restructuring of its
properties that would allow it to close at least 45 stores.  That company voluntary arrangement depends on raising
capital after JJB’s current 31.5 million-pound ($50.4 million)
share placing and on continued bank facilities, the Wigan,
England-based company said in a statement on Regulatory News
Service. The second funding attempt will probably need to be
bigger than the current one, the company said.  If JJB’s biggest shareholders and the creditors won’t back
the new arrangement, or the company is unable to raise more
finance, it will “no longer be able to trade as a going
concern” and receivers, liquidators or administrators would be
brought in, the company said in the statement.  JJB said today it may close as many as 45 “significantly
underperforming” stores and consider shutting another 50. JJB
needs new funds plus the creditor arrangement to help it survive
after saying weak holiday sales mean it’s likely to breach
banking covenants.  JJB fell 0.13 pence, or 2.9 percent, to 4.38 pence in  London . The shares have fallen 76 percent over the past 12
months, giving it a market value of 28.5 million pounds.  The company needs more than 75 percent of unsecured
creditors in terms of value to agree. About 150 outlets are
“core to the group’s future,” the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
