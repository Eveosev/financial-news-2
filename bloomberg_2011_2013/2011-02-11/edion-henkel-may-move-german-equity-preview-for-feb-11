German stocks fluctuated between
gains and losses as Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak  defied
calls for his immediate resignation, increasing concern that the
region will become more unstable.    ThyssenKrupp AG , Germany’s biggest steelmaker, slipped 2.9
percent after saying first-quarter net income fell.  IVG
Immobilien AG  retreated 2.8 percent after selling shares.  Carl
Zeiss Meditec AG  gained 3.6 percent after reporting earnings.  The benchmark  DAX Index  slipped 3.22, or less than 0.1
percent, to 7,337.06 as of 2:25 p.m. in Frankfurt, bringing its
weekly advance to 1.7 percent. The gauge has rallied 6.1 percent
this year amid optimism that the global economic recovery is
gathering strength. The broader HDAX Index also fell less than
0.1 percent today.  “There’s still a belief that Egypt will see a peaceful
transition of power, but the theme of  risk aversion  does seem to
be creeping back onto the cards ahead of the weekend break,”
said  Chris Weston , an institutional dealer at IG Markets in
Melbourne.  Speaking in a televised address last night, Mubarak handed
day-to-day powers to Vice President Omar Suleiman, while
reiterating that he plans to stay on until elections in
September, prompting U.S. President  Barack Obama  to urge the
country’s authorities to take further steps to resolve the
crisis.  Oil Reserves  Mubarak’s broadcast last night was rejected by tens of
thousands of opponents in Tahrir Square in Cairo who are
demanding an end to his 30-year rule. Violence that erupted as
the protests gained momentum has left about 300 people dead,
according to the United Nations, and sparked concern about
contagion in the region, which holds more than 50 percent of the
world’s known oil reserves.  The German inflation rate, calculated using a harmonized
European method, increased to 2 percent in January after rising
an annual 1.9 percent in December, the Federal Statistics Office
in Wiesbaden said today, confirming an initial estimate
published on Jan. 27. That’s the fastest since October 2008. In
the month, consumer prices fell 0.5 percent after rising 1.2
percent in December.  ThyssenKrupp lost 2.9 percent to 30.23 euros, the biggest
retreat in almost three weeks, as the company reported first-
quarter net income fell to 142 million euros ($192.5 million)
from 164 million euros.  The steelmaker also said it expects a wider full-year loss
at its Steel Americas unit than the company had previously
anticipated on costs from the start of new plants in the U.S.
and Brazil.  Banks Retreat    Deutsche Bank AG  and  Commerzbank AG  followed European
banking shares lower. Germany’s two biggest banks dropped 0.5
percent to 45.775 euros and 1.1 percent to 5.738 euros,
respectively.  IVG Immobilien declined 2.8 percent to 7.04 euros.
Germany’s largest commercial real estate company raised about 87
million euros in a capital increase, placing 12.6 million shares
at 6.90 euros each.  Carl Zeiss Meditec advanced 3.6 percent to 14.5 euros. The
maker of medical lasers said first-quarter earnings before
interest and taxes rose to 24 million euros from 18.7 million
euros, as revenue increased.  To contact the reporter on this story:
