  Renault SA  Chief Executive Officer  Carlos Ghosn  said sales of electric cars may become “a pillar”
of profitability in 2013,  Les Echos  reported, citing an
interview with Ghosn.  Renault and its Japanese affiliate Nissan Motor Co. should
sell electric cars worth 1.6 million euros ($2.2 billion) by
2016, the CEO said, according to the newspaper. The
profitability of Renault’s small cars, including the future Clio
IV, should increase profitability by 2013, while its high-end
cars won’t add to the company’s profit by then, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
