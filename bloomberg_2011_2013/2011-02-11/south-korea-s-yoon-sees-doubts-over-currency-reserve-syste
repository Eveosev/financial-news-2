Policy makers need to discuss
whether a global currency-reserve system focused on the  U.S.
dollar  is sustainable, South Korean Finance Minister Yoon Jeung Hyun said.  A “long-term challenge is to decide whether the current
international monetary system that uses a particular currency as
reserve currency can remain sustainable throughout the world,”
Yoon said in a speech in Seoul today.  French President  Nicolas Sarkozy , who holds the rotating
leadership of the Group of 20 and Group of Eight this year, has
also raised the issue of reducing the dollar’s role as a reserve
currency. His Finance Minister  Christine Lagarde  said on Jan. 25.  France ’s aim as G-20 chair is to foster debate on the monetary
system, which could include a “slight change from pure dollar
to a greater use of more euros, more other currencies, even more
sterling.”  “There are many economists and policy makers who criticize
the current system for its tendency to bring on repeated
financial crises, impose exorbitant prices for crisis prevention,
and aggravate global imbalance through competitive accumulation
of foreign reserves,” Yoon said.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said on Feb. 9 the
U.S. dollar’s role as the largest international reserve currency
is “pretty stable” and that he doesn’t expect that to change.
The dollar may be becoming more attractive because “problems”
with the euro, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
