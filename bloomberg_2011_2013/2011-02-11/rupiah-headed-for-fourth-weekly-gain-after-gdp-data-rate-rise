  Indonesia ’s rupiah had its biggest
weekly gain this year after the government reported the economy
expanded at the fastest pace in six years and the central bank
lifted borrowing costs.  Government bonds  fell.  The currency touched a three-month high as global funds
bought $24 million more Indonesian equities than they sold this
week through yesterday. Gross domestic product grew 6.9 percent
in the three months through December from a year earlier, the
most since the quarter ended December 2004, the statistics
bureau said on Feb. 7. Bank Indonesia unexpectedly raised the
benchmark interest rate at the end of last week.  “The sentiment is all on Bank Indonesia hiking the
interest rate,” said Wiling Bolung, head of treasury at ANZ
Panin Bank in Jakarta. “I think the central bank will increase
the interest rate more. The GDP numbers were good.”  The rupiah rose 0.6 percent for the week to 8,943 per
dollar as of 4:29 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It was unchanged from yesterday. The currency touched
8,898 on Feb. 9, the strongest level since Nov. 11.    Bank Indonesia  lifted its  reference rate  to 6.75 percent
from a record-low 6.50 percent on Feb. 4, the first increase
since October 2008.  Consumer prices in  Southeast Asia ’s biggest economy rose
7.02 percent last month from a year earlier, after a 6.96
percent gain in December, Central Bureau of Statistics data
showed. That was the fastest pace since April 2009.  Ten-year benchmark bonds declined. The yield on the 8.25
percent note due July 2021 climbed 10 basis points this week to
9.01 percent, according to prices from the Inter-Dealer Market
Association. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
