Bundesbank President  Axel Weber  will
resign from his post on April 30, the German government said.  Weber “expressed the wish” to step down during a meeting
with Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin today, Steffen Seibert,
her chief spokesman, said in a statement.  The Chancellor and Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble , who
also attended the meeting in the Chancellery, “took note of
this decision while respecting Professor Weber’s personal
reasons” for resigning, the statement said.  A successor to Weber will be announced “during the course
of the coming week,” it said.  A Bundesbank spokesman declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
