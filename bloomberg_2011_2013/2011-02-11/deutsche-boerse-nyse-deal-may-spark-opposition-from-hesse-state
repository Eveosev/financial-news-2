  Deutsche Boerse AG  and NYSE Euronext
may be challenged if their merger plans would shift  Frankfurt ’s
stock exchange out of Germany, a regional authority said.  The economy ministry of Hesse, the German state where
Frankfurt is located, is the stock exchange’s regulator and is
empowered to intervene in deals, said a spokesman who couldn’t
be identified, in line with ministry policy.  “It’s possible that moving away the stock exchange from
Germany or substantial parts of it outside the country could
allow us to block the plan,” the spokesman said. “You cannot
just close down the Frankfurt exchange because under the rules
you have duty to keep it running.”    Deutsche Boerse  AG and  NYSE Euronext  said Feb. 9 that they
are in advanced talks about a merger that would create the
world’s biggest exchange operator. The combined organization
would be home to publicly traded companies worth about $15
trillion, or 28 percent of global stock-market value, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The deal must be notified with Hesse authorities once a
decision has been made to “substantially” change the ownership
structure of Deutsche Boerse, the spokesman said. The regulator
then has one month to decide whether to veto the deal.  Andreas von Brevern, a spokesman for Deutsche Boerse in
Frankfurt, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
