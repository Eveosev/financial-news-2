The European Union said it expects
Ireland to make capital injections into  Allied Irish Banks Plc ,
Bank of Ireland Plc and EBS Building Society “as soon as
possible” to ensure respect for the terms of international aid.  Under its 85 billion-euro ($115 billion) aid package in
November, Ireland agreed to recapitalize the three lenders by
the end of February to increase their core Tier 1 capital
ratios, a gauge of financial strength, to at least 12 percent.
The government this week announced a delay in the measures until
after Feb. 25 elections, saying “this issue should be addressed
by the incoming government.”  “We understand this is temporary and the Irish authorities
will proceed as soon as possible with this recapitalization in
order to bridge this capital ratio of 12 percent as agreed under
the program,”  Amadeu Altafaj , spokesman for EU Economic and
Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn , told reporters in
Brussels today.  Ireland’s bailout was led by the European Commission -- the
EU’s executive arm -- and the  International Monetary Fund . The
commission and IMF are each providing 22.5 billion euros for
Ireland, while the euro area’s European Financial Stability
Facility is offering 17.7 billion euros.  The Irish package also includes a total of 4.8 billion
euros in loans from the U.K.,  Sweden  and  Denmark  and 17.5
billion euros from Ireland’s National Pension Reserve Fund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
