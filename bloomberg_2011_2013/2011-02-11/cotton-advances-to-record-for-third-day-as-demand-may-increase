Cotton futures surged to a record
for a third straight day as increased exports from the U.S., the
world’s largest shipper, signaled that global demand remains
robust.  Orange juice  was unchanged, while coffee declined.  In the week ended Feb. 3, U.S. cotton shipments jumped 26
percent from a week earlier, the Department of Agriculture said
yesterday. Prices have more than doubled in the past year as
adverse weather slashed global crops and mills boosted purchases
in  China , the biggest user.  “The U.S. export sales showed that despite the high price
of cotton, demand isn’t dipping,” Ker Chung Yang, an analyst at
Phillip Futures Pte, said by telephone from  Singapore .  Cotton for March delivery climbed 2.39 cents, or 1.3
percent, to settle at $1.8997 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. at
2:56 p.m. in New York. Earlier, the fiber touched a record
$1.9455.  Global output will be 115.25 million bales in the year
ending July 31, 0.2 percent lower than a January forecast, the
USDA said on Feb. 9. Demand will total 116.55 million bales, the
agency said.  Prices jumped 13 percent this week, the biggest weekly gain
since early December.  Futures may climb to $2 a pound, Judith Ganes-Chase, a
Katonah, New York-based commodity consultant, said, without
specifying a time frame. After that, the fiber may be vulnerable
to a drop, she said.  “We will see a huge increase in planting globally because
of the way cotton has run up, and that will gradually start
pressurizing prices,” she said.  U.S. cotton farmers will increase acreage by 14 percent
this year, the National Cotton Council said on Feb. 5.  Orange-juice futures for March delivery was unchanged at
$1.6525 a pound in  New York . The most-active contract lost 4.3
percent this week.  Arabica-coffee futures for March delivery fell 2.9 cents,
or 1.1 percent, to $2.5495 a pound on ICE. In  London , robusta-
coffee futures for May delivery fell $4, or 0.2 percent, to
$2,255 a ton on NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporters on this story:
