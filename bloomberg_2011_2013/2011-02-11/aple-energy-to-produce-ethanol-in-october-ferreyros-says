  Maple Energy Plc , a crude and
natural-gas producer with operations in Peru, plans to start
ethanol production at its $245 million plant in October, General
Manager Guillermo Ferreyros said.  Lima-based Maple aims to start selling part of its 35
million gallons of annual output to refineries operated by  Repsol YPF SA  and Petroleos del Peru SA before year-end,
Ferreyros said today. The company will also export ethanol to
the United States and the European Union, he said.  “We’re going to sell to all the gasoline producers here,”
Ferreyros said in a telephone interview in Lima. “By law,
refiners in Lima will have to incorporate a 7.8 percent ethanol
mix in gasoline starting in June.”  Maple’s ethanol project is part of $10 billion in
investment commitments expected in Peru’s energy industry over
the next seven years, according to the country’s Energy
Ministry. Companies including  Pure Biofuels Corp .,  Heaven
Petroleum Operators  and Peru’s Romero Group are investing $100
million in biofuel projects using crops such as canola.  Maple fell 2 pence, or 2.8 percent, to 68.5 pence in London
trading. The stock has climbed 3 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Alex Emery  in Lima at
