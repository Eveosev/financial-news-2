  Tunisia ’s interim prime minister,
Mohamed Ghannouchi, plans to organize an international
conference to support his country’s political and economic
reforms, French Prime Minister Francois Fillon said after a
telephone call with his North African counterpart.  The conference will be held “soon” in Carthage, a seaside
suburb of Tunis, Fillon said in a statement. Fillon said he
wants to start talks as soon as possible on granting Tunisia
closer trade privileges with the European Union.  French Finance Minister  Christine Lagarde  will visit
Tunisia to help prepare for the conference, Fillon said.  Ghannouchi told the Financial Times newspaper earlier this
week that the political upheaval that toppled President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali last month cost Tunisia $5 billion to $8
billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
