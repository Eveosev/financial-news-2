  Microsoft Corp .’s Bing search engine
gained market share in the U.S. last month, while market leader  Google Inc . lost 1 percentage point, according to  ComScore Inc .  Bing accounted for 13.1 percent of searches in January, up
from 12 percent the previous month, Reston, Virginia-based
ComScore said. Google dropped to 65.6 percent.  Microsoft has added search features, stepped up the
marketing of Bing and teamed up with former rival Yahoo! Inc. to
attract more users. At the same time, it’s drawn complaints from
Google that Bing is “copying” query results, rather than relying
on its own algorithms. Microsoft denied the accusation, saying
the data in question comes from customers.  While Google remains dominant, its loss of market share
last month is “meaningful,” Ben Schachter, an analyst with
Macquarie Group in  New York , said in a research note. Still,
ComScore’s data doesn’t capture queries made on mobile devices,
where Google may have an even bigger lead, he said.  The companies are vying for a larger piece of search
advertising. The market will generate $13.6 billion in the U.S.
this year, up from $12.4 billion in 2010, according to New York-
based research firm EMarketer Inc.  Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, fell 47 cents to
$27.50 today on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Google, located in
Mountain View, California, dropped 6 cents to $616.44, while
Sunnyvale, California-based Yahoo rose 19 cents to $16.62.  Yahoo, which uses Bing on its websites, accounted for 16.1
percent of queries last month, up from 16 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
