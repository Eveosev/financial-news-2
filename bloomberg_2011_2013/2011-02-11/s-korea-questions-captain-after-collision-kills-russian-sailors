questioning the captain of a Hyundai Heavy Industries Co.
container ship that collided with a Cambodian-flagged freighter,
killing four Russian sailors and leaving seven others missing.  The freighter was sailing from Japan to  China  when it

the coast guard, said by telephone today. The collision took
place on Feb. 9 in the ocean off Ulsan, to the southeast of the
Korean peninsula, Lee said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
