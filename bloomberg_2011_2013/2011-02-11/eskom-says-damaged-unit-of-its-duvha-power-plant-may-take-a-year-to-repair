Eskom Holdings Ltd., supplier of 95
percent of  South Africa ’s power, will take a year to fix a plant
damaged during routine tests, adding to strains on supply in a
country already threatened by shortages as soon as next month.  Unit 4 of the Duvha Power Station suffered extensive damage
when a 600 megawatt unit was taken down yesterday for regular
tests on a turbine, Hilary Joffe, a spokeswoman for the state-
owned utility, said in an e-mailed response to questions today.
All five other units of the 3,600-megawatt plant are operating.  South Africa, the continent’s largest economy, is battling
to meet demand for electricity and, according to Eskom, may face
a shortfall of as much as 2,000 megawatts next month. Power use
is expected to grow by 2 percent this year, Eskom estimates.  The faulty unit at Duvha will add to capacity shortages in
the country, which currently has a reserve margin of about 8
percent, Vincent Maposa, an analyst at Frost & Sullivan’s Energy
and Power Research, wrote in an e-mailed note today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
