  Palm oil  swung between gains and
losses near the highest level in almost three years as some
analysts said that the edible oil’s rally may curb demand,
while monthly data showed lower stockpiles and output in  Malaysia .  The April-delivery contract on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange gained as much as 0.9 percent and dropped as much
0.8 percent before closing 0.7 percent higher at 3,955
ringgit ($1,295) per metric ton in Kuala Lumpur. Yesterday,
the price reached 3,967 ringgit a ton, the highest level
since March 2008. Prices climbed 1.5 percent this week.  Prices of palm oil have surged 48 percent in the last
six months as bad weather has hurt yields of oilseed and
grain crops globally amid growing demand for cooking oils and
food. The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  this week cut
forecasts for crop inventories held before this year’s
harvests.  “Palm oil prices at such high levels could result in a
slowdown in demand as affordability in poorer countries will
be affected adversely,” Tan Ting Min, an analyst at Credit
Suisse Group AG, said in a report today. “The current palm
oil rally could be closer to its end.”  The price of palm oil is approaching its peak and may
drop in the second half, according to a report today from
CIMB Investment Bank Bhd. The lender cut the plantation
industry to “neutral” after most plantation stocks
outperformed.  The strength is “unsustainable,” Alvin Tai, an analyst
at OSK Research Sdn. in  Kuala Lumpur , wrote in a report today.
Still, the price may continue to stay “relatively firm” due
to tightness in supply, Tai wrote.  Lower Output  Palm oil production in Malaysia, the second-largest
grower after  Indonesia , dropped to the lowest level in almost
four years in January as floods hampered harvesting and cut
yields amid the annual low-production season.  Output fell 14.2 percent from a month earlier to 1.06
million tons, the lowest level since February 2007, the
Malaysian Palm Oil Board said yesterday. Stockpiles shrank to
1.4 million tons, the smallest amount since July.  March-delivery soybeans, which can be crushed to make a
rival cooking oil, rose as much as 0.7 percent to $14.4225 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and were at $14.375 at
6:07 p.m. in  Singapore . The oilseed reached $14.5575 a bushel
on Feb. 9, the highest price since July 2008.  September-delivery palm oil on the  Dalian Commodity
Exchange  fell 0.4 percent to close at 10,160 yuan ($1,541) a
ton. CME Group Inc.’s most-active May palm-oil contract,
pegged to the Malaysian benchmark price, rose 1.2 percent to
$1,270.25 a ton at 3:04 p.m. in Singapore.  To contact the reporter on this story:
