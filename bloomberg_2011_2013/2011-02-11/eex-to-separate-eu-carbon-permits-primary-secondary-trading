The European Energy Exchange AG said
it will as of March 1 separate secondary trading of European
Union carbon-dioxide allowances from primary auctions of
permits, which it handles for the German government.  Continuous trading of EU carbon permits expiring in
2011-2015 and primary auctions of allowances for delivery in
December 2011 and 2012 will be carried out through two different
products, named FEUA and F2EA, the Leipzig, Germany-based
exchange said in a statement on its  website  dated Feb. 8.  “The changes in the EEX product structure are available
for all trading participants in the simulation environment for
testing purposes as of now,” the exchange said.  EEX started handling carbon sales for  Germany ’s Environment
Ministry last year and said it’s preparing to take part in a
tender to help operate EU auctions planned for 2013 in the
world’s biggest emissions market.  Germany plans to auction on the derivatives market 570,000
allowances for December each week from January through October
in 2011 and 2012. The country will also hold weekly sales of
300,000 spot allowances from January through October and auction
870,000 spot permits weekly from November onward, according to
the EEX.  From March 1, the call phase of the auction on the  derivatives market  will be extended from 15 minutes to 2 hours
and will begin at 1 p.m. local time and end at 3 p.m., EEX said.  “Afterwards, auctioning will take place,” the exchange
said. “After the end of an auction, the F2EA product cannot be
traded until the next auction. In the future, trading in the
product for continuous secondary trading, FEUA, will not be
interrupted during the primary market auction.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
