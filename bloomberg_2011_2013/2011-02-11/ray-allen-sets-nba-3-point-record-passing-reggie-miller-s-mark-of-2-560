  Ray Allen  became the National
Basketball Association’s career leader in 3-point shots made as
the  Boston  Celtics lost 92-86 to the  Los Angeles Lakers .  Allen, a Celtics guard, broke Reggie Miller’s record of
2,560 3-point scores in the first quarter last night at TD
Garden in Boston. He ended the game with 2,562 3-pointers.  At the first timeout after the record-breaking shot, Allen
went to a courtside table to hug Miller -- who was at the game
as a TV commentator for TNT. Allen, 35, also hugged his mother
and his wife as the crowd gave him a standing ovation.  “I almost felt a little embarrassed because there was so
much attention surrounding this 3-point record,” Allen told
reporters after the game. “I’ve never really experienced that
because this is a team sport -- very rarely do you get that
emotional individual support.”  Allen went 3-for-8 from 3-point range in the game, giving
him a 40 percent conversion rate on 6,433 attempts in his 15-
year NBA career. He has played 1,074 games for the  Milwaukee
Bucks , Seattle SuperSonics and Celtics.  “I’m just so happy for him, because this is one of the
best guys, he’s so humble,” Miller said as part of the
broadcast. “This is great for the game of basketball.”  Allen, who led the Celtics with 20 points, tied Miller’s
mark with 4:13 left in the first quarter and broke the record 2
1/2 minutes later.  “It’s an unbelievable accomplishment,”  Kobe Bryant , who
led the Lakers with 23 points, said in a televised interview.
“It’s a testament to all the hard work he’s put in.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
