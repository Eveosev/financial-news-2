  Unipetrol AS  fell for a fifth day to
its lowest in more than 10 months after the largest Czech oil
refiner posted a fourth-quarter loss and said it will shut down
a facility later this year.  The stock slid 3.9 percent to 171 koruna at 4:24 p.m., its
lowest close since April 8, valuing the company at 31 billion
koruna ($1.73 billion). It lost 10 percent this week, the most
since the five days ended May 7. Almost 570,000 shares changed
hands today, more than double the daily average over the past
three months.  Unipetrol yesterday had the biggest daily drop since June
after the company said the net loss in the three-month period
was 68 million koruna. The company will shut down its Litvinov
facility in August for 51 days for an upgrade.  “Unipetrol posted relatively weak results,” Radim Kramule, an analyst at Ceska Sporitelna AS, the Czech unit of
Erste Group Bank AG, wrote in a report today. “The negative
market reaction to the results may linger on for some time.”  The decline has pushed the stock’s 14-day relative-strength
index to 22, its lowest since the week Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. collapsed in September 2008. Readings lower than 30 suggest
to some technical analysts that a security may rise.  The selloff has been “overdone,” Prague-based Kramule
said in the report. “We are of opinion that Unipetrol should
trade around 180 koruna to 190 koruna a share.”  The Czech Republic’s main PX index of 15 companies gained
0.2 percent to 1,238.2 today, paring this week’s decline to 1.3
percent. Coal company  New World Resources NV  had its biggest
daily advance in a week, rising 1.2 percent to 279 koruna.  To contact the reporter on this story:
