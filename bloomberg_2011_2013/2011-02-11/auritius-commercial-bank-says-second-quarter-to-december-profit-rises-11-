  Mauritius Commercial Bank , the
Indian Ocean island nation’s biggest lender and company by
market value, said second-quarter profit climbed 12 percent as
interest income advanced.  Net income rose to 1.05 billion rupees ($36 million)
compared with 939.1 million rupees, the Port Louis-based company
said in a statement published on the Stock Exchange of
Mauritius’s website today. Interest income increased to 2.46
billion rupees from 2.34 billion rupees. For the six months
through December, the group’s net income advanced to 2 billion
rupees from 1.7 billion rupees a year earlier.  “MCB’s results for the rest of the year should capitalize
on the momentum in asset growth already achieved over the last
year, with full-year results expected to reflect the trend of
the first semester,” the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
