Hovensa LLC said a fire in a
distillate desulfurizer broke out at its St. Croix refinery in
the  U.S. Virgin Islands .  “The rest of the refinery remains in production” and all
employees and contractors have been accounted for,  Alex Moorhead , a company spokesman, said in an e-mail. The unit is on
the west side of the 525,000-barrel-a-day refinery, he said.  Hovensa, a joint venture of state oil company Petroleos de
Venezuela SA and  Hess Corp ., said on Jan. 26 it would shut some
processing units permanently at the plant, cutting crude
distillation capacity to 350,000 barrels a day to trim losses.  The west side of the refinery, which is the original part,
will be shut down, Hess Corp. Chief Executive Officer John Hess
said in an earnings call Jan. 26. The east side is more modern
and efficient, he said.  The refinery receives and processes crude oil from around
the world via tankers. It sends finished products, including
heating oil and gasoline, to the U.S. Gulf and East coasts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
