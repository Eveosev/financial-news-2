Anna Fenninger won the super
combined to give Austria its second women’s title at the  Alpine
World Championships  in Garmisch-Partenkirchen,  Germany .  Fenninger, 21, finished with a total time of 2 minutes,
43.23 seconds in the event, which combines separate runs in the
downhill and slalom. She matches the gold medal won by
countrywoman Elisabeth Goergl in the super-G three days ago.  Tina Maze of Slovenia was second, 0.09 seconds behind
Fenninger, and Sweden’s Anja Paerson was 0.27 seconds back in
third place.  Lindsey Vonn of the U.S., the reigning overall World Cup
champion, sat out the afternoon slalom after finishing 12th in
the morning downhill. Vonn suffered a minor concussion in
training last week and will try to defend her downhill world
title in two days.  Germany’s Maria Riesch, the Olympic super combined
champion, could only finish 11th after being 15th following the
downhill.  To contact the reporter on this story:
