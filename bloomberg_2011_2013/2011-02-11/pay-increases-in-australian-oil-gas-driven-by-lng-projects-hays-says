Australian energy companies are
paying engineers, geologists and other contractors 35 percent
more this year as liquefied natural gas ventures fuel
competition for labor, the U.K.’s largest recruiting firm said.  Contractors in  Australia  are receiving $1,080 a day, on
average, compared with $800 a day last year, Matt Underhill, a
Sydney-based managing director of oil and gas for  Hays Plc , said
by phone. That’s almost $22,000 a month, assuming 20 days’ work.  Average salaries for “professionals” in the Australian
oil and gas industry for 2011 are 90 percent above the global
mark, rising 5 percent to $143,700, compared with a little-
changed $75,813 worldwide, Hays found in a survey conducted in
September and October. The more than $30 billion in Queensland
state coal-seam gas-to-LNG ventures approved by BG Group Plc and  Santos Ltd . are set to increase labor demand and drive up pay
further, Underhill said in a Feb. 9 interview.  “That’s going to put everything into overdrive,”
Underhill said. “There’s already a big battle in the West for
skills with mining and LNG projects, and now we’re going to up
the ante by putting another player into the competition with
coal-seam gas work.”  Companies may need to look increasingly overseas, including
the U.S. and  Canada , to satisfy the demand, Underhill said.
“Local talent doesn’t exist in some disciplines,” he said.
“Some of the employers are reluctant to do that, but I think
that’s going to change.”  The Hays survey included about 11,000 responses, he said.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
