Hong Kong stocks rose, paring the
benchmark index’s worst weekly drop since May, as exporters
gained on a better-than-estimated U.S. jobless report,
countering developers’ drop on concern  China  will further
tighten monetary policy.    Foxconn International Holdings Ltd ., a contract maker of
mobile-phones that receives 16 percent of its revenue from the
Americas, climbed 3.7 percent.  Tencent Holdings Ltd . jumped 5.3
percent after Credit Suisse AG boosted its share-price estimate

a state-controlled developer, dropped 1.1 percent.  “We’re riding on the U.S., Europe recovery, and favor
export-related companies, whose revenue is generated from the
U.S. and who have the ability to keep their costs under control
in China,” said Danny Yan, a Hong Kong-based fund manager at
Haitong International Asset Management, which oversees $600
million.  The Hang Seng Index climbed 0.5 percent to close at
22,828.92, after falling as much as 1.2 percent. The measure has
fallen 4.5 percent this week. That’s the gauge’s biggest weekly
decline since the week ended May 7.  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of so-called H shares
of Chinese companies rose 0.5 percent to 12,081.82.  The  Hang Seng Index  has lost 0.9 percent this year as
concerns over China’s tightening of monetary policy to tame
inflation counter optimism that improving U.S. economic reports
point to a broad-based recovery in the world’s biggest economy.  U.S. Employment  Shares in the gauge traded at an average 12.3 times
estimated earnings, compared with about 17.2 times at the start
of 2010.  Foxconn rose 3.7 percent to HK$5.63. Li & Fung Ltd., the
biggest supplier to retailers including Wal-Mart Stores Inc.,
climbed 2.1 percent to HK$46.  The number of Americans filing first-time claims for  unemployment insurance  fell to the lowest since July 2008 last
week. Applications for jobless benefits decreased by 36,000,
more than forecast, Labor Department figures showed.  Tencent surged 5.3 percent to HK$197.30, the biggest jump
on the Hang Seng Index, after Credit Suisse boosted its share-
price estimate for the stock to HK$227 from HK$203.  Property Stocks  China Resources Land fell 1.1 percent to HK$12.74.  Agile

1.8 percent to HK$11.10.  Sales of new homes in Shanghai fell by 25 percent in
