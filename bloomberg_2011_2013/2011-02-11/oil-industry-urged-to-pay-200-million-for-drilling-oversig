The U.S. oil industry should pay
about $200 million a year to support stricter and more efficient
oversight of drilling in the  Gulf of Mexico , a member of the
 National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill  said.  The funding, which is about 7 cents to 12 cents a barrel of
oil produced, would help hire rig inspectors and engineers to
review energy companies’ well designs, Donald Boesch, a member
of the panel, said today at a hearing of the House Committee on
Transportation and Infrastructure.  The April explosion at  BP Plc ’s Macondo well in the Gulf of
Mexico was caused by systemic management failures by the company
and its main contractors, and lack of efficient regulatory
oversight, the commission said last month. The blowout killed 11
people, destroyed a $365 million rig, and spewed crude for 87
days, closing a third of the Gulf to commercial fishing.  The commission didn’t determine which agency would collect
the $200 million, said Boesch, president of the University of
Maryland Center for Environmental Science.  To contact the reporter on this story:
