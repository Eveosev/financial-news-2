President Barack Obama will visit  Intel Corp ., the world’s biggest chipmaker, on Feb. 18 to
continue to make the case for more investments in innovation and
education.  The president will travel to the company’s  Hillsboro,
Oregon , campus, which includes several research and development
laboratories focusing on ways to improve digital technology. He
will also get a tour of the “world’s most advanced
semiconductor manufacturing facility” with Intel Chief
Executive Officer  Paul Otellini , according to a White House
statement.  The president will learn about Intel programs designed to
train workers in advanced technology, according to the
statement.  In his Jan. 25  State of the Union address , the president
said, “We need to out-innovate, out-educate, and out-build the
rest of the world.” Since then he has visited  Michigan ,
Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, three states that could help decide
the 2012 presidential election, in an effort to make the case
for more investments in infrastructure, education and
innovation.  To contact the reporters on this story:
