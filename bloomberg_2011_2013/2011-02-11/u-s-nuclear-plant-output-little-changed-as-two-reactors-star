U.S. nuclear-power output was little
changed for a sixth day after  Entergy Corp . started the River
Bend 1 reactor in Louisiana and DTE Energy switched on the Fermi
unit in Michigan, according to the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission.  Production from U.S. reactors fell 36 megawatts from
yesterday to 94,479 megawatts, or 93 percent of capacity,
according to a  report  today from the NRC and data compiled by
Bloomberg. Five of 104 units were offline.  Entergy is operating its 989-megawatt River Bend 1 reactor
at 1 percent of capacity after shutting it for refueling on Jan.
16. The plant is located about 24 miles (39 kilometers)
northwest of Baton Rouge.  DTE Energy is running its 1,122-megawatt Enrico Fermi
reactor in Michigan at 2 percent of capacity after idling it on
Jan. 31 to replace a condenser pump. The plant is on Lake Erie,
25 miles south of Detroit, where DTE is based.    Exelon Corp . slowed its 619-megawatt Oyster Creek unit in  New Jersey  to 90 percent of capacity from full power on Feb. 9.
The plant is located 33 miles north of  Atlantic City .  To contact the reporter on this story:
