Turkish stocks and lira fell as the
country’s biggest banks missed profit estimates for 2010 and the
current account deficit reached the highest in more than two
decades.  The main  ISE National 100 index  of shares fell 344.82, or
0.5 percent, to 64,076.71 at 12:30 p.m., when the first session
ended. The lira dropped 0.5 percent to 1.6 per dollar, heading
for the weakest closing price this month. Yields on benchmark
two-year lira bonds fell 3 basis points to 8.47 percent.    Akbank TAS  and  Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS , two of the three
biggest listed banks, have reported earnings this week that
missed analysts’ estimates. The current account deficit more
than doubled in December to $7.5 billion from $3.2 billion in
the same month of 2009, the central bank in Ankara said on its
website today. That was the widest gap since 1984 when the
bank’s data series began.  Akbank said today that profit last year rose 4.8 percent to
2.86 billion liras, when it was expected to earn 2.97 billion
liras, according to a Bloomberg survey. Garanti said yesterday
full-year net income rose 6.2 percent to 3.15 billion liras,
missing a Bloomberg estimate of 3.25 billion liras.  To contact the reporter on this story:
