Colombia’s peso fell for a third
week as prices declined for commodities including oil, the South
American nation’s biggest export.  The peso slid 0.8 percent in the past five days to 1,886
per  U.S. dollar  at 3:51 p.m. New York time. The currency fell
0.2 percent today from 1,881.48 yesterday.  “It’s a commodity effect and something we should continue
to see in the next couple of weeks,” said Julian Ramirez, an
analyst at brokerage Proyectar Valores SA in Bogota.  Crude accounts for about 40 percent of Colombia’s exports
and coal makes up 15 percent. Oil fell to a 10-week low in New
York after Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak  stepped down and
handed power to the military, reducing concern that shipments
from the Middle East will be disrupted.  The yield on benchmark 11 percent bonds due July 2020 fell
for a third day, dropping 2 basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 8.11 percent, according to  Colombia ’s stock exchange.
The price rose 0.149 centavo to 118.476 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
