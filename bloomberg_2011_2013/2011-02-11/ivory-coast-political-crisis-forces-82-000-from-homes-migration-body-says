The political crisis in the  Ivory
Coast  has forced almost 82,000 people from their homes,
according to the International Organization for Migration.  About 42,000 people have registered themselves as
internally displaced in the west of the country, the
organization said in a  statement  on its website today. Another
34,500 Ivorians have sought refuge in neighboring Liberia, while
smaller numbers have sought refuge in Mali, Burkina Faso and
Niger, the IOM said, citing data from aid groups including
Caritas and the  United Nations ’ refugee agency.  “The longer the crisis continues, the greater the
potential for a mass population movement,” IOM Director General
Eugenio Ambrosi said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story: Jason McLure in Accra on
