The  U.S. trade deficit  widened in
December for a second month as the cost of imported oil climbed
to the highest level in two years.  The gap grew 5.9 percent to $40.6 billion, in line with the
$40.5 billion median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of
economists, Commerce Department data showed today in Washington.
Excluding petroleum, the shortfall shrank to $15.3 billion, the
smallest since March.  For all of 2010, the trade gap surged 43 percent, the
biggest jump in a decade, as the recovery in spending led to
record imports of consumer goods. At the same time,
manufacturers like  Caterpillar Inc . benefited from a drop in the
value of the dollar that drove the biggest annual increase in
exports in two decades, capped by record demand in December from
China and newly industrialized Asian nations.  “The world has still got strong demand for American
manufactured goods, with robust growth in countries like
China,” said  David Semmens , an economist at Standard Chartered
Bank in New York. Additionally, “American consumers are coming
back, which means imports will keep rising.”  Another report today showed  consumer confidence  rose in
February to the highest level in eight months, a sign falling
unemployment and rising stock prices may be comforting
households. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan
preliminary February index of consumer sentiment increased to
75.1 from 74.2 in January.  Economists projected the gauge would rise to 75, according
to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey.  Share Prices  Stocks fell on concern the unrest in  Egypt  will escalate
following yesterday’s decision by President Hosni Mubarak’s not
to step down. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index maturing dropped
0.2 percent to 1,319.37 at 10:20 a.m. in  New York .  The trade gap was projected to widen, according to the
median forecast of 77 economists surveyed. Estimates ranged from
deficits of $37.4 billion to $43.5 billion. The Commerce
Department didn’t revise the November shortfall of $38.3
billion.  The trade gap climbed to $497.8 billion in 2010 from $374.9
billion the prior year. The shortfall was still below the $698.8
billion shortfall registered in 2008.  Exports increased 17 percent in 2010, the biggest one-year
gain since 1988. Imports also improved 20 percent, the most
since 1984.  Influence on Growth  After eliminating the influence of prices, which are the
numbers used to calculate gross domestic product, the trade
deficit increased in December to $46 billion from $45.2 billion.  Imports rose 2.6 percent to $203.5 billion, the most since
October 2008. The value of crude oil purchases increased to
$22.5 billion from $19.8 billion. The average price per barrel
of imported crude reached $79.78, the highest since October
2008.  American households have contributed more to the recovery
in recent months, propelling the gain in demand for foreign
goods.  Consumer spending , which accounts for 70 percent of the
economy, rose at a 4.4 percent annual pace in the fourth
quarter, the biggest gain in four years, according to Commerce
Department figures.  The gain in imports is supplementing improving sales
overseas.  China , set to become the world’s second-largest
economy this year, expanded 9.8 percent in the fourth quarter
from a year earlier.  India  grew 8.9 percent in the third quarter
and  Brazil , South America’s largest economy, advanced 6.7
percent.  Foreign Demand  Exports increased 1.8 percent to $163 billion, the most
since July 2008, led by sales of autos, chemicals and industrial
machines.  Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of construction
equipment, posted fourth-quarter profit that topped analysts’
estimates as sales advanced in China,  Australia  and Latin
America. The Peoria, Illinois-based company said 2011 sales will
top $50 billion after coming in at $42.6 billion last year.  “Sales are improving in every region, and are at or near
records in the developing world,”  Mike DeWalt , director of
investor relations at Caterpillar, said on a Jan. 27
teleconference. “Over the past quarter, we’ve become somewhat
more positive about economic growth in the developed economies
of  North America ,  Europe , and Japan.”  The U.S. trade gap with China narrowed to $20.7 billion in
December from $25.6 billion the prior month. Demand for American
goods from countries in the European Union climbed to the
highest level since October 2008.  Lower Dollar  Since reaching a one-year high on June 7, the dollar has
dropped 8.1 percent through yesterday against a trade-weighted
basket of currencies. The decrease makes American goods cheaper
to buyers abroad and will keep spurring manufacturing, which
expanded for an 18th consecutive month in January.  President Barack Obama, who has set a goal of doubling
American exports by 2014, said last month in his State of the
Union address that the U.S. has made progress.  “Already, our exports are up,” Obama said Jan. 25.
“Recently, we signed agreements with India and China that will
support more than 250,000 jobs here in the  United States . And
last month, we finalized a trade agreement with  South Korea  that
will support at least 70,000 American jobs.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
