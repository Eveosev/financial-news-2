U.S. stocks erased losses as a jump
in  consumer confidence  to an eight-month high helped wipe out an
early slide triggered by a reduced forecast from Kraft Foods
Inc. and concern Egypt’s political crisis will worsen.  JPMorgan Chase & Co., Caterpillar Inc. and Bank of America
Corp. rose more than 1 percent for the top gains in the  Dow
Jones Industrial Average . Kraft sank 1.9 percent after saying
rising commodity prices will weigh on earnings.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was little changed at
1,321.61 at 10:35 a.m. in  New York  after slumping as much as 0.4
percent. The Dow slipped 5.26 points, or less than 0.1 percent,
to 12,224.03, reversing most of an earlier 49-point slump.      The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
index of consumer sentiment for the month climbed to 75.1 from
74.2 in January. Economists projected the gauge would rise to
75, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey.  The S&P 500 has risen 5.1 percent this year through
yesterday as better-than-forecast economic data and company
earnings boosted confidence in the economic recovery. Earnings
at 74 percent of the 348 companies in the  S&P 500  that reported
results since Jan. 10 posted per-share profit that beat analyst
estimates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
