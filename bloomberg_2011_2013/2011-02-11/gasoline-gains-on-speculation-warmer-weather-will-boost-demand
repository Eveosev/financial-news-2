Gasoline pared gains and crude oil
fell after Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak  resigned, reducing
concern that violent protests would spread in the region and
disrupt crude oil and product shipments through the  Suez Canal .  Gasoline retreated from the day’s high after Mubarak handed
power to the military, bowing to the demands of protesters who
have occupied central Cairo for the past three weeks demanding
an end to his 30-year rule. Futures rose earlier as a forecast
for higher temperatures from Texas to New York indicated that
demand for the motor fuel will increase.  “The thinking is if he resigns peacefully, that take us
closer to a peaceful, nonviolent solution to this problem,”
said  Peter Beutel , president of trading advisory company Cameron
Hanover Inc. in  New Canaan , Connecticut.  Gasoline for March delivery sank 0.7 cent, or 0.3 percent,
to $2.4628 a gallon at 12:20 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Prices earlier touched $2.5037. The gasoline crack
spread, based on March contracts, widened $1.06 to $18.06 a
barrel.  “Mubarak has decided to relinquish the office of the
presidency,” said Vice President  Omar Suleiman  in a statement
on state television today. “He has instructed the Supreme
Council of the armed forces to take over the affairs of the
country.”  The Arab world holds more than 50 percent of the world’s
oil reserves as of 2009, according to the BP Statistical Review.
Crude oil for March delivery dropped $1.36 to $85.37 a barrel.  Higher Temperatures  Gasoline advanced earlier as higher-than-normal
temperatures were projected for much of the eastern half of the
U.S. Feb. 16 through Feb. 24, according to the National Weather
Service’s  Climate Prediction Center .  “The dramatic upshift in temperatures should lead to a
return in gasoline demand,” said  Phil Flynn , vice president of
research at PFGBest in  Chicago .  Stockpiles of the motor fuel rose 4.66 million barrels to
240.9 million barrels in the week ended Feb. 4, the largest
total since March 1990, according to Energy Department data.  Heating oil for March delivery dropped 1.43 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $2.6964 a gallon, after touching $2.735.  The heating oil crack spread, based on March contracts,
widened 68 cents to $27.80 a barrel as Brent crude oil’s premium
to West Texas Intermediate crude oil gained $1.50 to $15.64 a
barrel. Refineries on the East Coast, where Nymex futures are
delivered, process oil from  Europe  and West Africa, which is
traded relative to Brent.    New York  Harbor is the delivery point for heating oil and
gasoline futures.  Stockpiles of distillates, including heating oil and
diesel, rose 288,000 barrels to 164.4 million in the week ended
Feb. 4. Demand dropped 5.4 percent to an average 3.68 million
barrels a day, the lowest level in three weeks.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, added
0.8 cent to $3.127 a gallon yesterday, AAA said on its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
