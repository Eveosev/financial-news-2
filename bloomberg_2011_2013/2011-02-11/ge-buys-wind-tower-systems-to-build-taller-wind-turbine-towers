  General Electric Co ., the biggest
maker of  wind turbines  in the U.S., purchased  Wind Tower Systems
LLC  to gain access to technology for building tall towers more
cheaply.  Wind Tower Systems has developed a metal lattice system
that lets developers transport towers of 100 meters (328 feet)
or more in sections and assemble them on-site, Fairfield,
Connecticut-based GE said today in a statement. It did not give
a price.  GE plans to install a prototype this year and expects to
begin using Wind Tower’s so-called space frame systems
commercially in 2012.  Wind turbines are typically installed atop tubular towers
that are delivered to project locations in large sections.  Park City, Utah-based Wind Tower said that assembling its
space frame systems on-site can be as much as  80 percent  less
expensive and will let developers install taller turbines.  “Taller towers are an essential complement to longer
blades," Victor Abate, vice president-renewable energy for GE
Power & Water, said in the statement. "Longer blades capture
more energy and in turn improve return on investment for wind
farm developers.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
