Alex Corbisiero will replace Andrew
Sheridan at loosehead prop in the  England  lineup for tomorrow’s
Six Nations rugby match against  Italy .  Sheridan reported soreness in his back following training
yesterday and was ruled out of the game at Twickenham Stadium in  London  after seeing England’s medical team this morning, the
Rugby Football Union said on its website.  It will be the first international Test match for the 23-
year-old Corbisiero.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
