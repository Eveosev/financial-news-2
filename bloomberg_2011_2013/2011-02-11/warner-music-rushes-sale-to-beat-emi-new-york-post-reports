Warner Music Group is rushing a sale
of the company before EMI Group Ltd. comes up for auction and
has so far attracted more than 20 potential bidders, the New
York Post reported, citing unidentified persons.    Citigroup Inc ., which took over EMI, plans to put the
company up for sale shortly, the newspaper said.  A simultaneous sale of the two companies might make it
harder for them to find buyers, the Post said. Some units, such
as Warner Musicâ€™s Warner/Chappell publishing business would
compete with a similar bigger division at EMI, the newspaper
said.  Several potential bidders for Warner Music, including Clive
Calder, founder of Zomba, Russian investor Leonard Blavatnik,  Universal Music , Sony Music and several private-equity firms
might also be interesting in buying EMI, the newspaper said.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
