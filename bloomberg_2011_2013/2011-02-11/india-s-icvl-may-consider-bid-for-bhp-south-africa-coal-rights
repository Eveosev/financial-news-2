International Coal Ventures Ltd., a
grouping of Indian state-run metal and energy companies, may bid
for  BHP Billiton Ltd .’s coal prospecting rights in South Africa,
General Manager Ajay Mathur said.  “ICVL was formed to acquire coal assets overseas and it is
only natural for us to consider any opportunity,” Mathur said
by telephone from New Delhi today.  BHP Billiton Energy Coal South Africa Ltd. is divesting
some coal prospecting rights because other investor groups are
better positioned to develop them, the company said Jan. 31.
Indian companies are looking overseas to secure supplies of coal
to make steel and generate electricity in Asia’s second-fastest
growing major economy.  ICVL expects to acquire three coal assets in Indonesia and
Australia this year, Mathur said on Feb. 3. The company has bid
for a coal block in the Tavan Tolgoi mining area in Mongolia, he
said then.    Coal India Ltd . and  Steel Authority of India Ltd . each own
about 28 percent of ICVL. The other partners are NTPC Ltd.,
India’s largest power generator,  NMDC Ltd ., the country’s top
iron-ore producer, and steelmaker Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
