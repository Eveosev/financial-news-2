Light Louisiana Sweet and Heavy
Louisiana Sweet crude premiums rose to the highest levels
against West  Texas  Intermediate since at least 1991 as the U.S.
benchmark fell against its European counterpart.  The spread between March-delivery WTI futures and Brent,
the basis for European and West African crudes, increased $1.27
to $15.41 a barrel.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium strengthened 90 cents to
$17.40 a barrel at 11:58 a.m. in  New York , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg, the widest gap since 1991 when Bloomberg
began collecting the data. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to
WTI increased 80 cents to $17.30.  Among Gulf Coast sour, or high-sulfur, grades, Mars Blend’s
premium to WTI strengthened 25 cents to $11 a barrel, while
Poseidon increased 35 cents to $11.35 over the benchmark.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium widened 70 cents to $9.70 a
barrel. Thunder Horse’s premium to WTI strengthened $2.50 a
barrel to $17 a barrel. West Texas Sour’s discount narrowed 30
cents to $6.70. WTS is delivered in Midland, Texas, so its price
is less influenced by imports.  Syncrude’s premium increased $1 to at $6.25 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the  tar sands  in Alberta.  The discount for Western Canada Select narrowed $2.65 a
barrel to $23.25 after  Enbridge Inc . said it returned Line 6B to
premaintenance flow rates after the line was shut Feb. 7 for
planned work.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Aaron Clark  in New York at
