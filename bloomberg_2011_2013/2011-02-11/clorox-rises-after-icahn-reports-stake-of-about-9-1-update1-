  Clorox Co ., the maker of cleaners
including its namesake bleach and Pine-Sol, had its biggest gain
since May 2008 after billionaire investor  Carl Icahn  reported a
stake of about 9.1 percent in the company.  Icahn said in a filing today that he supports the company’s
plan to buy back as many as 11 million shares by the end of the
fiscal year, and that he may seek talks with Clorox management
“from time to time.”  Clorox Chief Executive Officer Don Knauss has sought to
boost overseas sales and revenue from higher-margin products.
The Oakland, California-based company said Feb. 4 that second-
quarter profit declined 81 percent on slumping demand and
charges tied to the value of its businesses.  Icahn “probably believes the sum of the parts is greater
than the whole,” said  Jack Russo , an analyst at  Edward Jones  in  St. Louis .  The investor could suggest that Clorox focus on a couple of
categories rather than remain the amalgamation of brands it is
now, Russo said. Clorox’s brands include Burt’s Bees skin care
and Hidden Valley Ranch salad dressing.  Icahn, 74, built his reputation as a corporate raider in
the 1980s, targeting companies such as Phillips Petroleum Co.
and Texaco Inc. He has also sparred with management at Time
Warner Inc. and Yahoo! Inc. He often spends years holding stocks
as he waits for investments to pay off.  Clorox rose $5.01, or 7.6 percent, to $71.26 at 4 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have
gained 19 percent in the past 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
