U.S. joblessness would be much
higher if Americans dropping out of the workforce were taken
into account, according to  Albert Edwards , a global strategist
at Societe Generale.  “The impression that unemployment has fallen” results
primarily from a drop in the participation rate, Edwards wrote
yesterday in a report. The rate is the percentage of working-age
people who are looking for a job or already have one.  The CHART OF THE DAY compares the  unemployment rate , as
compiled monthly by the Labor Department, with adjusted figures
that assume participation was unchanged in the past decade. The
adjustment produces a 12.8 percent jobless rate for January, as
the top panel shows. The actual rate was 9 percent after a two-
month drop of 0.8 percentage point, the steepest since 1958.  Labor-force participation appears in the bottom panel. The
rate declined last month to 64.2 percent, the lowest since 1984.
The adjusted unemployment data is based on a rate of 67 percent,
the average for 1996 through 2000.  “There are an awful lot of discouraged workers who might
emerge from the woodwork to keep the rate of unemployment very
high and wage inflation at its current low rate” as the economy
grows, Edwards wrote.  Compensation rose last year by 2 percent, according to the
department’s employment-cost index. The increase was the second-
smallest ever for a calendar year, beating only the 1.4 percent
growth in 2009. Records have been kept since 1982.  (To save a copy of the chart, click here.)  To contact the reporter on this story:  David Wilson  in New York at
