  Valero Energy Corp . scheduled
maintenance on a unit at its McKee refinery in Sunray,  Texas ,
according to a notice filed with the state Commission on
Environmental Quality.  The repairs, starting at 9 a.m. local time today, will
decoke tubes in the unifiner charge heater, according to the
 filing . Production wonâ€™t be affected,  Bill Day , a spokesman
based at company headquarters in San Antonio, said in an e-mail.  The refinery in the Texas Panhandle receives feedstock from
northern Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas and eastern Colorado. It
obtains crude from storage in Cushing, Oklahoma, through third-
party pipelines, Valero said on its  website .  The refinery can process 170,000 barrels of crude a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
