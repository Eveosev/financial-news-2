Mozambique’s government plans to
impose price controls on cement produced by Cimentos de
Mocambique, the largest cement factory in the country and a unit
of  Cimpor Cimentos de Portugal SGPS SA , state run Agencia de
Informacao de Mocambique said.  The company sells a 50-kilogram (110-pound) bag of cement
for $8, while resellers almost double the price on the local
market, the Maputo-based news agency said, citing Steffen Kasa,
chairman of the company’s executive committee.  Cimentos de Mocambique’s three cement plants produced
960,000 tons of cement in 2010, short of the country’s
consumption if 1.1 million tons, AIM said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
