Homebuilers rallied in  Sao Paulo ,
led by  Rossi Residencial SA , with the BM&FBovespa Real Estate
Index rebounding from a seven-month low as investors bet that
the impact of higher interest rates may be less than estimated.  Rossi jumped 6.3 percent to 12.97 reais at 2:09 p.m. New
York time, heading to the steepest rise since Oct. 13, and
leading gains on the index, which climbed 3 percent.  Gafisa SA 
advanced 4.7 percent to 10.17 reais.  “Even if interest rates keep rising, as we expect, there
won’t be a significant impact on housing credit, which is the
key driver to this industry,” Armando Halfeld, an analyst at
Ativa Corretora in Rio de Janeiro, said in a phone interview.
“The market has over-reacted over this issue.”    Interest rates  on most housing loans in Brazil are set by
the government, and aren’t significantly affected by increases
in the central bank’s benchmark lending rate, Halfeld said.  The BM&FBovespa Real Estate Index fell 16 percent this year
through yesterday. The Bovespa index declined 6.8 percent.  Central bank policy makers raised the benchmark Selic rate
to 11.25 percent in January. Yields on futures contracts
indicate that investors expect rates to end the year at 13
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
