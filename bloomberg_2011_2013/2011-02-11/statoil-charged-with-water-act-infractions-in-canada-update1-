  Statoil ASA ,  Norway ’s biggest oil
and natural gas producer, was charged with violating its water
license and providing false information at its oil-sands project
in  Canada .  Statoil Canada Ltd. faces charges under the Water Act and
the first court appearance is set for April 6 in  Edmonton , the
government of Alberta  said  on its website yesterday.  The company, which started production at its Leismer oil
sands project in Alberta last month, was charged with 19
violations from 2008 to 2009, Baard Glad Pedersen, a company
spokesman, said today.  “The infractions were related to the use of water to build
ice roads for drilling in winter, not to operating the Leismer
plant,” he said by phone. The Canadian province regulated how
much water one can use, where one can collect it and how it
should be reported, he said.  Statoil in 2007 bought North American Oil Sands Corp. for
about $2 billion to tap an area estimated to hold the largest
oil reserves outside  Saudi Arabia . It has since invested about
$1.5 billion in facilities at Leismer, according to calculations
by Arctic Securities ASA analyst Trond Omdal.  The company started production at the Leismer demonstration
plant in January and plans to produce 10,000 barrels a day
within two years, before expanding production capacity at the
site and moving on to the next phase of the project scheduled
for 2016, called Corner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
