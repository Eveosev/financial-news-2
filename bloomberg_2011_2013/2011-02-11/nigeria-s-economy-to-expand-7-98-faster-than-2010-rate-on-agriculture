Nigeria’s economy, the second-
largest in sub-Saharan  Africa , is projected to grow by 7.98
percent this year, led by non-oil industries including
agriculture, said Finance Minister Olusegun Aganga.  The expansion, which compares with 7.85 percent in the
previous year, comes amid a “commitment to grow the non-oil
sector to become the major driver of economic growth” this
year, Aganga said in a speech today in Abuja, the capital.  Africa’s most populous country is seeking to diversify its
economy, which relies on oil for some 95 percent of its export
income, Aganga said. The industry accounts for just 16 percent
of gross domestic product, while agriculture accounts for 42
percent, according to the Abuja-based  National Bureau of
Statistics .  On Feb. 1, the country’s 24 banks pledged to triple lending
to agriculture to aid the industry and boost economic growth,
said Phillips Oduoza, chief executive officer of  United Bank  for
Africa Plc.  Aganga said the security situation in the restive oil-rich  Niger Delta  has “improved” and helped boost crude production
amid high international prices. An infrastructure deficit
estimated at $100 billion remains a “major” challenge to growth,
he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
