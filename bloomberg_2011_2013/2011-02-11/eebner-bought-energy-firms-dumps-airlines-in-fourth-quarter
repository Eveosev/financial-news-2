Kenneth Heebner, manager of the top-
performing diversified U.S. stock mutual fund in the past 10
years, bought shares in several energy companies, including  Schlumberger Ltd , and sold stakes in two airlines in the fourth
quarter.  Heebner’s Capital Growth Management LP, acquired 3.4
million shares of Houston-based Schlumberger, the world’s
largest oilfield-services provider, worth $280 million,
according to a filing today with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission. He also invested in Halliburton Co., a
Houston-based energy services firm, and  Walter Energy Inc ., a
Tampa, Florida-based coal producer.  The 70-year Heebner is known for concentrating in
industries from homebuilding to commodities and a willingness to
shift directions quickly. His fund turns over its stock four
times more often than the typical equity fund, data from
Chicago-based Morningstar Inc. show.  Heebner sold his entire stakes in Atlanta-based Delta
Airlines Inc. and Dallas-based  Southwest Airlines Co .  Heebner’s $3 billion  CGM Focus Fund  returned 16 percent a
year in the 10 years ended Jan. 31, the best record among more
than 3,500 diversified U.S. stock funds, according to
Morningstar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
