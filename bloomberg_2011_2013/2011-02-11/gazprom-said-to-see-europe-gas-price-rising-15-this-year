OAO Gazprom expects European gas
prices to rise 15 percent and supplies about 9 percent this
year, as demand recovers in the Russian exporter’s biggest
market by revenue.  The average price will probably rise to $352 per 1,000
cubic meters this year from $306 last year, according to a
presentation to analysts and investors today, a copy of which
was provided to Bloomberg. Gazprom links its prices to oil and
products. Brent has risen 39 percent in the past year.  Exports to  Europe  are planned at about 152 billion cubic
meters of gas this year, compared with 139 billion cubic meters
last year, according to the materials. Gazprom said it had 23
percent of the market in 2010.  “This year, Gazprom expects growth because of rising
demand in Europe and increasing spot prices in Europe, which
make Russian gas competitive,” Svetlana Grizan, an analyst at
VTB Capital, said by phone today.  European sales accounted for 52 percent of Gazprom’s
revenue last year, according to the presentation. Deliveries may
return to pre-crisis levels this year after spot prices
increased, Deputy Chief Executive Officer Valery Golubev said
this week in  St. Petersburg . Supplies, mostly shipped under
long-term contract via pipeline, will face less pressure than
last year, he said.  Focus on LNG  Gazprom’s shipments to Europe slumped to 140.6 billion
cubic meters in 2009, from 158.8 billion cubic meters in 2008,
as the financial crisis eroded demand and some of the Russian
company’s customers shifted purchases to cheaper liquefied
natural gas cargoes. Exports were 150.5 billion in 2007.  Gas for next-month delivery in the U.K., Europe’s most
liquid market, has risen about 57 percent in the past year,
according to broker prices compiled by Bloomberg.  Gazprom, which has depended on pipeline supplies to Europe
for decades, plans to build a link to  China  and increase LNG
trade, according to the presentation.  “Gazprom has made LNG a priority,” Grizan said.  Gazprom plans to boost the share of LNG in its supplies
through planned projects in Russia and acquisitions, as the fuel
is chilled to a liquid for shipment by tanker to remote markets,
such as  Asia , and doesn’t pass through transit countries.  The Moscow-based producer, which agreed to gain control of
Royal Dutch Shell Plc’s  Sakhalin-2 LNG  project in 2006, plans to
carve out as much as 14 percent of global LNG trade by 2030,
according to the presentation. The share didn’t exceed 2 percent
last year, according to the materials.  Gazprom is selecting LNG projects outside  Russia  for
potential participation, which could add as much as 25 billion
cubic meters of gas to the company’s portfolio annually by 2030,
according to the presentation.  Gazprom’s gas output may slide to 505.6 billion cubic
meters this year from 508 billion last year, according to the
presentation. Production is set to rebound to 531.4 billion
cubic meters next year and 558.3 billion in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
