Gold fell from a three-week high as
an advance by the dollar eroded demand for the precious metal as
an alternative asset.  The greenback rose for a second straight day against a
basket of major currencies as reports showed the  U.S. economy  is
improving and Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak  stepped down.
Earlier, gold gained as much as 0.5 percent amid mounting
tensions in Egypt.  “Some of the dollar strength is hurting gold,” said  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at Integrated Brokerage Services LLC in  Chicago . “If gold doesn’t rally from here, it’s going to
trigger a lot of sell signals.”  Gold futures for April delivery fell $2.10, or 0.2 percent,
to settle at $1,360.40 an ounce at 1:46 p.m. on the Comex.
Earlier, the price reached $1,369.70, the highest for a most-
active contract since Jan. 20.  This week, the metal climbed 0.8 percent, the third
straight gain, after slumping 6.1 percent in January. In 2010,
the price jumped 30 percent, the 10th consecutive annual gain.  Silver futures for March delivery declined 9.9 cents, or
0.3 percent, to $29.995 an ounce. This week, the metal gained
3.2 percent.  Palladium futures for March delivery fell $6.20, or 0.8
percent, to $814.70 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . This week, the price dropped 0.2 percent.  Platinum futures for April delivery declined $17.30, or 0.9
percent, to $1,813.50 an ounce. The commodity fell 1.7 percent
this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
