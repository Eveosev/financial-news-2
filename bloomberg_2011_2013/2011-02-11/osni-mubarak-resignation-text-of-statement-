  Hosni Mubarak  stepped down as
president of  Egypt  and handed power to the military, bowing to
the demands of protesters who have occupied central Cairo for
the past three weeks demanding an end to his 30-year rule.  The 30-second statement on state television was read by
Vice President Omar Suleiman at 6:02 p.m. local time:  “Citizens, in these difficult circumstances that our
country is going through, President Hosni Mubarak has decided to
relinquish the office of the presidency and has instructed the
Supreme Council of the armed forces to take over the affairs of
the country.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
