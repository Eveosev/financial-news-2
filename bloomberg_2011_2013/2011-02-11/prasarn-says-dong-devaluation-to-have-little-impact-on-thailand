Bank of Thailand Governor Prasarn Trairatvorakul comments on  Vietnam ’s decision to devalue the
dong. He spoke to reporters in Bangkok today.  “Vietnam’s devaluation will have little impact on Thai
exports.  “We don’t have many products that compete with Vietnam.
Less than 10 percent of our total exports compete with Vietnam,
such as rice, textiles and furniture, so there will be some
impact, but very little.  “There is surging demand for farm commodities, and the
high demand will help farm products from both countries.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
