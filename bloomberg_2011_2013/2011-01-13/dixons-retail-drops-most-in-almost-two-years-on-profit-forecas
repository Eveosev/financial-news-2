Dixons Retail Plc (DXNS) , the U.K’s
largest consumer-electronics retailer, said full-year earnings
will miss most analysts’ estimates as sales decline because of
weakening consumer confidence.  Underlying pretax profit for the year through April will be
about 85 million pounds ($136 million), the bottom of a range of
estimates that extends to 109 million pounds, the  Hemel
Hempstead , England-based retailer said today in a statement.  Sales at stores open at least a year fell 7 percent in the
last 11 weeks, reflecting “the weaker trading environment
across many of our markets,” the owner of the Currys and PC
World chains said. U.K. consumer confidence fell to a record low
in February, and retailers may face further pressure after the
government increased sales tax and inflation accelerated to more
than double the Bank of England’s target.  “ Consumer confidence  across some of our markets is fragile
and we expect it to continue to be so through much of 2011,”
Dixons Chief Executive Officer John Browett said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
