Terra Firma Capital Partners Ltd.,
the private-equity firm founded by  Guy Hands , is close to an
agreement to buy U.K. care homes operator Four Seasons Health
Care Group Ltd., a person with knowledge of the talks said.  The London-based leveraged-buyout firm may pay about 820
million pounds ($1.33 billion) for control of the health-care
provider, said the person, who declined to be identified because
an agreement hasn’t been finalized. An announcement is expected
tomorrow, the Sunday Times reported today.  Terra Firma’s purchase of Four Seasons Health Care would be
the firm’s biggest acquisition since it ceded control of British
music label EMI Group Ltd. in February 2011, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The U.K. care homes company was bought in 2006
by Qatari-backed Three Delta LLP and then taken over by lenders
including Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc. Its shareholders
were considering bids as part of negotiations with debtholders.  Hands has said he would target clean-energy and
agricultural investments after losing almost a third of his
London-based firm’s most recent 5.4 billion-euro ($7.2 billion)
buyout fund on EMI, which  Citigroup Inc. (C) , its lender, sold in
November. Terra Firma last month agreed to buy the Garden Centre
Group, which sells plants and vegetables in 129 stores
throughout the U.K., for 276 million pounds.  A spokeswoman for Four Seasons and a spokesman for Terra
Firma both declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
