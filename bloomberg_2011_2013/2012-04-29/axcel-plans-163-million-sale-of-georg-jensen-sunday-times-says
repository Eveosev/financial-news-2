Axcel A/S, a Copenhagen-based
private equity firm, plans to sell Danish jeweler Georg Jensen
A/S for as much as 100 million pounds ($163 million), the  Sunday
Times  said without saying where it got the information.  Fosun International Ltd. (656) , owner of jeweler Links of  London ,
might buy the company, which reported last year its first profit
in a decade, the London-based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
