German Finance Minister  Wolfgang
Schaeuble  said the fiscal pact agreed by leaders of 25 European
nations will come into force,  Welt am Sonntag  reported, citing
an interview.  The pact brings “confidence in the long-term stability of
the system,” Die Welt cited Schaeuble as saying. Renegotiating
the fiscal pact completely is a utopia,  Jean-Claude Juncker , the
head of the group of euro-area finance ministers told Die Welt.
Juncker told the German newspaper that he would talk to Francois
Hollande, who wants the pact renegotiated, if he is elected a
France’s new president on May 6.  European Central Bank Executive Board member Joerg Asmussen
said the fiscal pact should be kept in its current form, Welt am
Sonntag reported.  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  on April 28 ruled out
reopening negotiations on the fiscal pact.  To contact the reporters on this story:
