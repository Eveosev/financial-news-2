Departing  AstraZeneca Plc (AZN)  Chief
Executive Officer  David Brennan  could get as much as 40 million
pounds ($65 million) as part of his exit package, the  Sunday
Times  said, not citing anyone.  This will include an almost 1 million-pound annual pension,
according to the newspaper.  “The exact terms of David Brennan’s package on retirement
have yet to be agreed by the Board, which we’ll disclose in due
course,” Neil McCrae, a spokesman for AstraZeneca said today in
an e-mailed statement. “The figures used in media reports are
entirely speculative at this stage.”  “David Brennan’s pension reflects the fact that he has
been at the company for 36 years at increasingly senior
positions,” McCrae also said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
