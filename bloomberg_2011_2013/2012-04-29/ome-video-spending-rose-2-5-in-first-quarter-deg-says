Home-video spending by U.S.
consumers rose 2.5 percent in the first quarter from a year
earlier, to $4.5 billion, driven by increased demand for Blu-ray
discs, according to the  Digital Entertainment Group .  Blu-ray disc sales jumped 23 percent in the first three
months of 2012, the industry-backed DEG said in a statement.
Spending on packaged videos, including DVDs and Blu-ray,
declined 0.6 percent to $2.1 billion, indicating a drop in DVD
sales.  Blu-ray accounted for a quarter of total spending on movie
discs, compared with less than 15 percent two years ago, the Los
Angeles-based group said. It didn’t break out specific dollar
amounts within the packaged-goods category.  Kiosk rentals, such as those provided by  Coinstar Inc. (CSTR) ’s
Redbox, jumped 30 percent in the quarter to $523 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
