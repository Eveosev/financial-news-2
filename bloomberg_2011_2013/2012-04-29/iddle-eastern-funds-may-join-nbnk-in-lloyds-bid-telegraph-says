Qatar Holding LLC and Abu Dhabi’s
Mubadala Development Co., two Middle Eastern wealth funds, have
held talks with  NBNK Investments Plc (NBNK)  about a possible increase
in the U.K. company’s offer for branches of  Lloyds (LLOY)  Banking Group
Plc, the  Sunday Telegraph  reported.  NBNK hopes to bring in one or both of the funds as
investors to help buy the 632 branches, which regulators are
requiring Lloyds to sell, the newspaper said, citing
unidentified people at NBNK.  Lloyds said April 27 it would consider alternative bids to
that of its preferred buyer, Co-Operative Group Ltd. NBNK
offered 1.5 billion pounds ($2.4 billion), an offer Lloyds
spurned last year.  Mubadala Development and Qatar Holding both declined to
comment when contacted today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
