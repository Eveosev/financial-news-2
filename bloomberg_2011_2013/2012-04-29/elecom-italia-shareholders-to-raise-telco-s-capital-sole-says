Telecom Italia SpA (TIT) ’s largest
shareholders will discuss a capital increase for Telco SpA, the
company’s controlling vehicle, at a May 3 meeting, Il Sole 24
Ore reported, without saying where it got the information.  Telecom Italia shareholders have still to decide the size
of the capital increase, which will depend on the loans Telco
needs to refinance in the coming month, Il Sole said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
