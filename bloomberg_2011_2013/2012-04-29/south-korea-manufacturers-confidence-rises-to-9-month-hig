South Korean manufacturers’
confidence fell from a 9-month high as concern mounted that a
deepening debt crisis in  Europe  may crimp demand for the
nation’s exports and slow growth.  An  index  measuring expectations for June fell to 86 from 90
in May, the Bank of  Korea  said in a statement in Seoul today. A
measure of expectations at  non-manufacturing companies  fell to
83 from 85.  A political impasse in Greece this month sparked worries
the Mediterranean nation may leave the euro, leading to broader
contagion. South Korean Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan said last
week he can’t be optimistic about an economic recovery in  South
Korea  amid the possibility of a global recession.  The Bank of Korea held rates for an 11th straight month on
May 10, while ratcheting up language to address the
deteriorating European outlook. Downside risks to the country’s
economic growth because of Europe are “significant,” the
central bank said.  The business survey, conducted from May 15 to May 22, was
based on responses from 1,597 manufacturers and 872 non-
manufacturers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
