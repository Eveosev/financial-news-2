A gym owned by a member of
 Bahrain ’s Parliament was riddled with 30 bullets, several days
after the lawmaker called for the removal of the country’s prime
minister.  The attack was an assassination attempt, Osama al-Tamimi, a
 Sunni Muslim , said in a telephone interview today. It was linked
to his call at a Parliament session last week for the departure
of Sheikh Khalifa bin Salman al-Khalifa, premier for more than
four decades, he said.  “This was a message to anyone trying to touch on this
subject,” al-Tamimi said. No one was hurt in the attack on al-
Tamimi’s gym in Sanad, south of Manama, which occurred at about
3:30 a.m. yesterday, he said.  A building in the central governorate was attacked with
gunshots and an investigation is under way to identify the
suspects, Bahrain’s  Interior Ministry  said in a statement late
yesterday.  Al-Tamimi, who ran as an independent in elections last
year, is a rare, vocal Sunni critic of the Sunni monarchy. His
call for a change of government, an elected cabinet and a
parliament with wider powers echoes that of the mostly Shiite
opposition.  Bahrain was rocked by one month of demonstrations last
year, led by the Shiite majority demanding equal rights and
representation. Small demonstrations still take place regularly
in Shiite neighborhoods, sometimes spilling into commercial
areas of Manama.  To contact the reporter on this story:
