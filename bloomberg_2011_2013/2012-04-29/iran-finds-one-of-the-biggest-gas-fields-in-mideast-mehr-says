Iran  discovered “one of the biggest
natural gas fields in the  Middle East ,” with reserves
comparable to those of the South Pars field,  Mehr  reported,
citing an industry official.  The gas was found in southwestern Khuzestan province at a
deposit already known to contain crude oil, said National
Iranian Oil Co. Director for Exploration Mahmoud Mohaddes,
according to the state-run  news agency . A 5000-meter (16,400-
foot) well will be drilled “soon” to collect further
information, he said.  South Pars, the world’s largest proved gas deposit, is
shared between Iran and Qatar. Iran holds the world’s second-
largest gas reserves, with 29.6 trillion cubic meters, according
to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy in June 2011.
Russia has the biggest reserves of the fuel, BP data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
