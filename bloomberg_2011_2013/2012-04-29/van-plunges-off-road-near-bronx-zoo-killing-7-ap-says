A van plunged off a roadway near
the Bronx Zoo in  New York City , killing seven people, including
three children, the  Associated Press  reported, citing the
police.  Police say the van was headed south on the Bronx River
Parkway, a highway in the city, the AP reported. It bounced off
the median, crossed all southbound lanes over to the guardrail
and fell from the overpass, the AP said.  Itâ€™s not clear what caused the van to go out of control, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
