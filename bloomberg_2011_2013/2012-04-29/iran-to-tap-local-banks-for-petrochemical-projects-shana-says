Iran ’s National Petrochemical Co.
plans to borrow from local banks some of the $50 billion it
needs to develop 60 projects by the end of 2015, the Oil
Ministry’s news website  Shana  reported.  The state-run company seeks to broaden its output to 85
products from the current 25 and wants to build production hubs
in the northeastern city of Sarakhs, the port of Chabahar, and
the Persian Gulf islands of Lavan, Qeshm and Kish, Managing
Director Abdolhossein Bayat said in the report today.  Iran is trying to expand petrochemicals-making capacity to
51 million metric tons a year in 2015. State media last year
said output was about 4 million tons. Iran, the second-largest
oil producer in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, faces economic sanctions over its nuclear program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
