Switzerland  may have net outflows
of as much as 15 percent of assets after new withholding taxes,
 NZZ am Sonntag  reported, citing an interview with  Vontobel
Holding AG (VONN)  Chairman Herbert Scheidt.  While inflows have recently been positive for the industry,
new taxes will lead to a net decline in assets under management,
the Zurich-based newspaper cited Scheidt as saying.  Net new money at Vontobel was “uncomfortably weak” in the
second half of 2011 and that trend continued in January, Scheidt
reportedly told NZZ am Sonntag.  To contact the reporter on this story:
