Speculators reduced bullish bets on
corn by more than any other commodity, just before the U.S.
reported its single biggest export sale in 18 years and prices
had their largest two-day rally in almost a month.  Money managers cut corn  wagers  by 30 percent to 103,079
futures and options in the week ended April 24, the biggest
decline since June 2010, according to data from the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission. The drop of 43,511 contracts was
larger than for any of the 18 raw materials tracked by
Bloomberg. Holdings across all the commodities fell for a fifth
week, the longest slide since June 2010, the data show.  U.S. exporters sold 1.44 million metric tons of corn in a
single day, taking the four-day total to 2.84 million tons, the
 U.S. Department of Agriculture  said April 27.  China  is
accelerating purchases to feed a hog herd that is projected by
the USDA to reach an all-time high of 690 million this year. The
demand combined with less bullish speculators will increase
 volatility  in  futures markets  and lead to “major price
spikes,” Rabobank International said in a report April 27.  “The world has to eat,” said Jeffrey Sica, the
Morristown, New Jersey-based president of SICA Wealth Management
who helps oversee about $1 billion of assets. “Everything from
grains to soybeans is being shipped to China, as we’re seeing an
emerging middle class. Demand is very much there.”  Stocks Rally  A measure of  wagers  on 11 U.S. farm goods fell to a two-
month low as the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Agriculture Spot Index
of eight commodities rose 2.5 percent, the most since mid-March.
Corn advanced 4.1 percent in the final two days of the week as
the export  sales  were announced. The S&P GSCI Agriculture gauge
rose 0.3 percent to 434.3 at 2:12 p.m.  New York  time.  The S&P GSCI Spot Index of 24 raw materials climbed 1.2
percent last week, led by natural gas, corn, wheat and soybeans.
The MSCI All-Country World Index of equities gained 1.1 percent.
The dollar declined 0.6 percent against a basket of six major
trading partners and Treasuries returned 0.2 percent, a Bank of
America Corp. index shows.  Cattle were the biggest loser, dropping 2.3 percent after
the U.S. reported its first case of mad cow disease in six years
on April 24. Speculators cut net-long  positions  for a fourth
week, to the lowest since December 2009. Prices rallied in the
last three days of the week after  Canada ,  Mexico ,  Japan  and
 South Korea , the four biggest buyers of U.S. beef, said they
won’t halt purchases.  Rising Chinese demand for agricultural supplies and drought
damage to crops in South America are bolstering prospects for
U.S. exports that are a foundation for President Barack Obama’s
goal of doubling sales overseas by 2015. Increased shipments
will help net farm  income  reach $91.7 billion this year, second
only to last year’s $98.1 billion, the USDA said Feb. 13.  Monetary Fund  Global food inventories remain “significantly” below the
average over the past four decades, the  International Monetary
Fund  said in a  report  April 17. The La Nina weather pattern,
which brings drier weather to  South America  and heavier rainfall
in  Asia , is the most prominent risk to food supply, and its
return this year has been “unexpectedly powerful,” the
Washington-based IMF said.  An  index  of 55 food items tracked by the  United Nations 
climbed for a third consecutive month in March and is within 9.3
percent of the record reached in February 2011.  Farmers are responding by planting more crops and U.S.
growers will sow the most corn acres since 1937, the government
said March 30. Global production will jump 4 percent to a record
900 million tons in the 12 months starting July 1, the
International Grains Council forecasts.  South America  Funds boosted their soybean bets by 1.1 percent to 243,389
contracts, the highest since at least June 2006. Prices will
average $14.75 a bushel in the second quarter as South American
output posts its biggest decline on record, Rabobank’s analysts
wrote in their report. That would be the highest quarterly
average ever, and the oilseed closed at $14.935 on April 27.  Investors pulled $291 million out of commodities in the
week ending April 25, said  Cameron Brandt , the director of
research at Cambridge, Massachusetts-based EPFR Global, which
tracks investment flows. Gold and precious-metals funds outflows
totaled $64 million, Brandt said.  Bets on rising gold prices fell 4.2 percent to 107,600
contracts, the lowest since January 2009. Bullion gained 1.3
percent in New York last week. Open interest, or contracts
outstanding, in U.S. gold futures fell to 395,389 on April 24,
the lowest level since September 2009, Comex data show.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said last week
that central bankers “remain prepared to do more” if U.S.
economic conditions worsen. Monetary stimulus is positive for
commodities as investors seek alternative assets, said  Michael Cuggino , who manages about $17 billion of assets at  Permanent
Portfolio (PRPFX)  Funds in San Francisco.  Quantitative Easing  The S&P GSCI rose more than 80 percent from December 2008
to June 2011 as the Fed bought $2.3 trillion of debt in two
rounds of quantitative easing and held borrowing costs at a
record low.  The world economy will expand 3.5 percent this year,
compared with a January projection of 3.3 percent, the IMF said
April 17, raising its outlook for the first time in more than a
year. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s commodity analysts, led by
 Jeffrey Currie  in  London , said in a report April 24 they expect
commodities to return 13 percent over the next 12 months.  “The fundamentals in commodities, especially on the
agriculture side, are quite positive,” said  Peter Sorrentino , a
senior  fund manager  at Huntington Asset Advisors in Cincinnati
who helps oversee $14.7 billion of assets. “The fundamentals
just cry out that food is going to be a solid investment.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
