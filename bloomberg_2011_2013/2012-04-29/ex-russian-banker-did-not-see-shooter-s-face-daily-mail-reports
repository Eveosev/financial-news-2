German Gorbuntsov, a former Russian
banker who was shot in east  London  on March 20, did not see the
face of his attacker, the  Mail on Sunday  reported.  Gorbuntsov, who was hit by six bullets in the shooting
outside his apartment, said in an interview with the London-
based newspaper that officers from the Serious Organised Crime
Agency had showed him CCTV footage of his assailant to try to
jog his memory.  He has given police the names of four former business
associates who he believes may have been behind the attack, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
