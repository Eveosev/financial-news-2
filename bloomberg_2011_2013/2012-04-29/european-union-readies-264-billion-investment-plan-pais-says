The European Union is working on an
investment plan of 200 billion euros ($265 billion) to be
focused on infrastructure, renewable energy and technology, El
Pais said, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter.  The money will be channeled mostly toward countries worst
hit by the European debt crisis, the newspaper said. The program
may be implemented by using 12 billion euros available under the
European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism to boost the capital
of the  European Investment Bank , El Pais reported.  The EIB, in turn, would use its expanded capital to
guarantee the issuance of bonds backed by assets such as
infrastructure projects to be offered to pension funds and other
institutional investors, El Pais said. An alternative would be
expanding the EIB’s capital with funds from the governments, the
newspaper said.  Also, the European Union is considering securitizing the
EIB’s loan portfolio, freeing up its capital and allowing the
lender to provide new financing, El Pais said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
