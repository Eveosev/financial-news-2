India , the world’s second-biggest
grower, may allow fresh cotton exports of up to two million
bales, a government official, who declined to be identified
citing rules, said.  The government will tomorrow consider resuming exports of
the commodity, Trade Minister  Anand Sharma  said in New Delhi
earlier today. He will discuss matters including availability of
cotton with India’s farm and finance ministers, Sharma said.  India barred cotton exports on March 5 to secure domestic
supplies after shipments surged before the ban to about 9.5
million bales, more than the 8.4 million-bale surplus the
government estimated. The curbs were partially ended a week
later after protests from growers, traders and  China , the
biggest buyer.  Cotton inventories in the nation may decline to the lowest
level in eight years because of record exports depleting
reserves. Stockpiles may fall to 2.5 million bales of 170
kilograms each on Oct. 1 from 3.9 million bales a year earlier
and 5.5 million bales estimated on Jan. 24, Textile Commissioner
A.B. Joshi said April 18.  India has already shipped 10.6 million bales in the year
that started in October, Minister Sharma said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
