Jason Dufner  won the Zurich Classic
of New Orleans in a playoff with Ernie Els for his long-awaited
first title on golf’s U.S. PGA Tour.  Dufner, 35, a three-time runner-up on the tour who was
playing in his 164th PGA event, had a 2-under-par 70 in
yesterday’s final round at the TPC Louisiana in Avondale to
finish tied with Els at 19 under par.  After both players parred the first playoff hole, Dufner,
an American, birdied the second sudden-death hole while Els had
a par.  “It was tough trying to get this first win, it was tough
for about six years now,” Dufner, who is getting married in
five days, said in a televised interview. “It’s a monkey off my
back.”  Els, 42, a three-time major champion from  South Africa , was
trying to end a two-year winless run on the PGA Tour.  The tour now moves to Charlotte, North Carolina, for the
Wells Fargo Championship, the last event on the schedule before
the  Players Championship .  Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson,  Rory McIlroy , Jim Furyk, Lee Westwood and Graeme McDowell are among those playing from May 3-
6 at Quail Hollow Club in Charlotte.  To contact the reporter on this story:
