Nigel Rudd, chairman of the airport
operator BAA Airports Ltd., is the preferred candidate for
chairman of  Prudential Plc (PRU) , the U.K.’s biggest insurer by market
value, the  Sunday Times  reported, without saying where it got
the information.  Rudd, who is also chairman of  Invensys Plc (ISYS) , is said to be
competing with  Pearson Plc (PSON)  Chairman Glen Moreno for the role,
but it’s not certain he will take the job, the London-based
newspaper said.  Jonathan Oliver, a spokesman for Prudential, declined to
comment when contacted by Bloomberg today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
