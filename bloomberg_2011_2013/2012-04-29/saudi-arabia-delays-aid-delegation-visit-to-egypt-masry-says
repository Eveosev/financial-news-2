Saudi Arabia  postponed sending a
delegation to Cairo to negotiate lending Egypt $2.7 billion,  Al
Masry Al Youm  reported, citing an unidentified government
official.  Saudi Arabia closed its embassy and consulates in the North
African country yesterday and recalled its ambassador because of
protests in front of its mission in Cairo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
