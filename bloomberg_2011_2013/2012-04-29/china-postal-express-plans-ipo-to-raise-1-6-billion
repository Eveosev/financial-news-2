China  Postal Express & Logistics
Co. plans to raise 9.98 billion yuan ($1.6 billion) in an
initial public offering, to buy trucks and airplanes and build
distribution centers.  The unit of state-owned China Post Group will sell as many
as 4 billion yuan-denominated shares on the Shanghai stock
exchange, according to a prospectus published yesterday on the
China Securities Regulatory Commission website. China Postal is
the nation’s  biggest courier service , according to its website.  The regulator is tightening rules to improve share pricing
and disclosure, with CSRC Chairman  Guo Shuqing  saying in March
that IPO prices are “too high.” Stocks that started trading in
China this year rose by an average 21 percent from their IPO
prices in their first trades, and closed the most recent trading
session an average of 7.1 percent below their offering prices,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  China Postal’s distribution network covers 31 provinces and
regions and more than 200 countries around the world, according
to the prospectus. The company employs 889,000 people, the
report said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
