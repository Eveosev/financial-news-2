Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG (HDD) 
Chief Executive Officer Bernhard Schreier sees an end to the
years of decline for  Germany ’s printing-press manufacturers,
according to an interview with  Welt am Sonntag .  Makers of printing presses will be able to defend market
share from digital-print competitors, Schreier told Die Welt.
Digital-print makers now have about 10 percent of the market by
print volume, and this shouldn’t rise to more than 20 percent,
Schreier told the German newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
