Manchester Airport Group Plc plans
to raise about 1 billion pounds ($1.6 billion) by selling a 50
percent stake to fund its bid to buy Stansted airport, the
 Sunday Times  said without saying where it got the information.  The group plans to choose a preferred bidder within the
next month from Australia-based Industry Funds Management Pty
Ltd., Cheung Kong Holdings Ltd., and a joint venture between  3i
Infrastructure Plc (3IN)  and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the
London-based newspaper said. The sale will be conditional on
Manchester making a successful bid for Stansted, which BAA
Airports Ltd. may be forced to sell later this year, the report
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
