Terra Firma  Capital Partners  will
pay about 820 million pounds ($1.33 billion) for control of Four
Seasons Health Care Group Ltd., the  Sunday Times  reported
without saying where it got the information.  The company founded by British financier  Guy Hands  is
expected to be unveiled as the new owner of the U.K. nursing-
home company tomorrow, the London-based newspaper reported. The
chain of 500 nursing and care homes is currently owned by a
consortium of banks led by Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
