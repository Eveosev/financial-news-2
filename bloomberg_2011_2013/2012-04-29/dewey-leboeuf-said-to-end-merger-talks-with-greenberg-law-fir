Dewey & LeBoeuf LLP, the New York
law firm struggling to survive after more than 70 lawyers left in
recent weeks, has ended talks with a potential merger partner,
Greenberg Traurig LLP, according to two people familiar with the
matter.  The firm told members of the end of negotiations in an
internal memorandum that also announced that Steven Davis, its
former chairman, has been terminated as a member of the five-
person chairmanâ€™s office and the executive committee.  The firm plans to continue merger talks with other firms as
it faces a deadline tomorrow with banks over whether to extend a
$100 million line of credit, according to the memo, which was
obtained by Bloomberg News.  The New York-based firm is said to be under investigation
by the New York District Attorney related to payments to
partners.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
