At least 24 Syrians were killed by
security forces during protests across the country, according to
an opposition group.  Twelve people were killed in the northern province of Idlib
and others died today in areas including Aleppo near the Turkish
border and Daraa in the south, the Local Coordination Committees
of  Syria  said in an e-mailed statement.  The group says more than 500 people have died since a
cease-fire went into effect on April 12. The truce was brokered
by United Nations envoy  Kofi Annan  and agreed to by President
Bashar al-Assad and the leading opposition groups.  The UN is seeking to recruit 300 observers to bolster a
monitoring mission in Syria to assess the cease-fire. The U.S.
and allies have expressed skepticism about the accord and say
they are preparing tougher measures against Assad.  Syria’s government has blamed the violence on foreign-
backed extremist groups, and says parliamentary elections due on
May 7 mark a step toward the political openness that the Syrian
public is seeking.  To contact the reporters on this story:
