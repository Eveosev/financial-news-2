Qatar Telecom QSC (QTEL) , the Persian Gulf
country’s biggest company by revenue, posted a 12 percent
decline in first-quarter profit after foreign-exchange losses in
Indonesia, the company said.  Net income fell to 711.4 million riyals from 810.8 million
riyals a year earlier, according to an e-mailed press release.
The median estimate of three analysts was for a profit of 644
million riyals, according to  data compiled by Bloomberg . Revenue
grew 7.6 percent to 8 billion riyals as the company’s customer
base rose to 84.4 million.  In Indonesia, where Qtel owns a majority stake in  Indosat
Tbk PT (ISAT) , the rupiah traded at 9,146 to the dollar on March 30
compared to 8,720 to the dollar a year earlier, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Doha-based Qatar Telecom, called Qtel, seeks to expand
overseas amid increased competition in its home market from
 Vodafone Qatar. (VFQS)  The company, which owns stakes in
telecommunications companies from North Africa to  Southeast
Asia , held talks to buy a 19 percent stake in its Iraqi unit
Asiacell from Merchant Bridge, Chairman Abdullah bin Mohammed Al
Thani said on Jan 22.  The company’s stock rose 2.4 percent to 138 riyals on the
Qatar Exchange today before the financial results were released.
The share price has risen 27 percent this year compared to a 1
percent decline for the  QE Index (DSM)  of Qatari companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
