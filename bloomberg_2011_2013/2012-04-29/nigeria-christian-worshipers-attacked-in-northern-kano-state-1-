Suspected Islamist militants opened
fire on and threw explosives at a Christian worship center in
northern  Nigeria ’s Kano state today while worshipers were
attending Sunday service, the military said.  The attack, which may have been by Boko Haram members, took
place at Bayero university campus in Kano city, the state
capital, said Ikedichi Iweha, a spokesman for the joint  task
force  in charge of security in the region. Soldiers were
deployed to the area and engaged in a gunfight with the
attackers, Iweha said.  Seven people were killed in the attack and several others
were injured, Mustapha Zaharadeen, a spokesman for the
university, said by phone from the city.  Authorities in Nigeria,  Africa ’s top oil producer, blame
Boko Haram for a surge of attacks since 2009 against government
buildings and security forces in the mainly Muslim north and
Abuja, the capital. The group, inspired by the  Taliban movement ,
claimed responsibility for multiple blasts and attacks in the
city of Kano on Jan. 20 that killed at least 256 people.  The group claimed responsibility for Apr. 26 attacks on
ThisDay’s office in Abuja, and a building housing the newspaper
and two others in the northern city of Kaduna because it
objected to coverage of its actions, Abul Qaqa, a spokesman for
Boko Haram told the Premium Times, which wasn’t targeted.  To contact the reporter on this story:
