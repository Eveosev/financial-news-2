The Beijing government reprimanded
the city’s auto show for allowing “scantily clad” models to
pose beside cars, the official Xinhua news agency reported.  The Capital Ethics Development Office said the clothing of
some models at the 2012 Beijing International Automotive
Exhibition had a “negative social impact,” Xinhua said late
yesterday. The statement may have referred to photographs
circulated on the Internet of Gan Lulu, a celebrity who wore a
“deep V-cut top,” and Li Yingzhi, a model who posed in a
“skimpy diamond-studded dress.”  The ethics office criticized the “vulgar publicity”
surrounding the models and told the auto show’s organizers to
ensure it doesn’t happen again, Xinhua said.  The Beijing auto show, held every two years, has attracted
carmakers including Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, General Motors
Co. and Honda Motor Co. The event is open to the public from
April 27 to May 2.  Three calls by Bloomberg News to the China International
Exhibition Center Group Corp., an organizer of the event, went
unanswered outside office hours.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Helen Sun in
