Resolving  Switzerland ’s tax dispute
with the U.S. remains a “major challenge” for affected banks,
 SonntagsZeitung  reported, citing an interview with Zuercher
Kantonalbank Chief Executive Officer Martin Scholl.  The delivery of information on bank employees to the U.S.
will be regarded as a “constructive contribution,” the Zurich-
based newspaper cited Scholl as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
