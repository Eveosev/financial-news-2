Jordan’s public debt rose 7 percent
to 14.3 billion dinars ($20.2 billion) in the first quarter of
this year, the  Finance Ministry  reported.  External debt reached 4.6 billion dinars and internal debt
was 9.7 billion dinars at the end of March, the ministry said in
a statement on its website. Total debt was up from 13.4 billion
at the end of 2011, it said.  Jordan, one of the smallest economies in the  Middle East ,
imports more than 90 percent of its oil and relies on foreign
investment and grants to support its budget and current-account
deficits. The kingdom’s power plants have had to switch to more
expensive fuels such as diesel after repeated interruptions in
natural-gas supplies caused by sabotage of the export pipeline
in neighboring  Egypt .  To contact the reporter on this story:
