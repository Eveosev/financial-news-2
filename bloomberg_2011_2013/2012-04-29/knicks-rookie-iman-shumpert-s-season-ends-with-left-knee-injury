New York Knicks rookie guard Iman Shumpert’s season came to an end when he twisted his knee during
the team’s 100-67 National Basketball Association playoff loss
to the  Miami Heat .  Shumpert, 21, tore the anterior cruciate ligament and the
lateral meniscus last night in the Knicks’ first playoff game.
The injuries will require surgery followed by rehabilitation of
six to eight months.  Derrick Rose’s season also ended last night when he tore
his ACL during the Chicago Bull’s 103-91 win over the
Philadelphia 76ers in their playoff opener.  Shumpert was hurt when he turned to get back a ball he lost
while dribbling across midcourt in the third quarter. He twisted
his knee and fell to the floor. His teammates carried him off.  “It’s tough, man,” teammate  Carmelo Anthony  said. “It’s
an unfortunate situation for us to lose a guy like Shump, the
way he’s been playing, and what he brings to our team. We’re
definitely going to miss that.”  Shumpert, the team’s first-round pick in the 2011 draft,
had been charged with guarding the Heat’s  Dwyane Wade , who
scored 19 points last night.  Shumpert led all rookies with 1.7 steals per game during
the regular season and averaged 9.5 points per game.  To contact the reporter on this story:
