Egypt ’s lower house of parliament
suspended its sessions for the remainder of this week to protest
the military’s refusal to dismiss the government.  The move was announced today by Parliament Speaker Saad el-
Katatni. Parliament, which is dominated by Islamists, has
rejected a broad development plan put forward by the military-
appointed government, and called on the army to fire the
Cabinet, which it blames for problems ranging from a faltering
economy to fuel shortages and deteriorating security.  Parliament has said that “the government creates the
problems and that it obstructs this assembly and the work of
this assembly,” el-Katatni said in footage aired by Nile News.
Parliament will not endure violations “to our dignity and that
of our members,” he said.  Egypt heads into presidential elections starting May 23.
Politics has been dominated during the past few months by
discord between secularists and Islamists, as well as an
escalating showdown between Islamists and the ruling military
council, which took power after the ouster of  Hosni Mubarak  last
year. Lawmakers have repeatedly called for the military to fire
the government following their rejection of the development
program.  El-Katatni said the lawmakers’ criticism comes from the
position of “historic responsibility” of being the first
parliament elected after the uprising last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
