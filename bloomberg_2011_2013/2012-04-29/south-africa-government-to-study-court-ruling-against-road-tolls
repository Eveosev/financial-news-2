South Africa’s government  will
review a High Court decision to block its plans to introduce
road tolls in the city of Johannesburg.  “We respect the decision,” the  Department of Transport 
said in an e-mailed statement today. “We will study the ruling
thoroughly and decide on the next course of action.”  Judge Bill Prinsloo stopped South African National Roads
Agency Ltd. from starting electronic tolling tomorrow on 185
kilometers of the city’s roads after the Opposition to Urban
Tolling Alliance, a civil society group, appealed to North
Gauteng High Court in  Pretoria .  The government planned to collect money from drivers in
Johannesburg to help repay 20 billion rand ($2.6 billion) of
debt incurred while expanding highways in the nation’s most
populous city. The court, in a judgment broadcast on live
television, ruled that a full review of the project be heard in
court.  To contact the reporter on this story: Sikonathi Mantshantsha in
