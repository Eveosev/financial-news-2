The Israeli Cabinet today approved
offering settlers living in the unauthorized West Bank
settlement of Migron an alternative site for their homes,
according to an e-mailed statement from the prime minister’s
office.  The new site is located in Kochav Yaakov, a settlement in
the West Bank north of  Jerusalem . The government plans to have
it ready by July 15, according to the statement.  Israel’s High Court of Justice rejected a government
proposal to delay the evacuation by three and a half years in
March and ruled that the Migron outpost must be evacuated by
Aug. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
