The  Boston Celtics  are a game down
in their National Basketball Association playoff series against
the  Atlanta Hawks , their best outside shooter is hurt and their
top playmaker faces a possible suspension.  With injured guard Ray Allen watching from the bench in a
suit and tie, the Celtics missed all 11 of their 3-point
attempts and lost 83-74 in the opener of their first-round
playoff series yesterday against the host Atlanta Hawks.  Point guard Rajon Rondo was ejected late for bumping
official Marc Davis and could be suspended by the NBA for the
second game of the series tomorrow night in Atlanta.  “As I was walking, I thought he stopped,” Rondo told
reporters. “My momentum carried me into him, I even think I
tripped on his foot. I didn’t intentionally chest-bump him.”  The  Los Angeles Clippers  overcame a 24-point fourth-quarter
deficit to defeat the Memphis Grizzlies 99-98, and the  San
Antonio Spurs  and  Los Angeles Lakers  also won the openers of
their best-of-seven series last night.  The Clippers trailed 95-71 with less than eight minutes
remaining in their game at Memphis before ending the contest
with a 28-3 run.  “We felt as though we gave this game away and everybody’s
down,” Rudy Gay, who missed a 16-foot jump shot at the final
buzzer after leading Memphis with 19 points, said at a news
conference. “We got too comfortable out there.”  Josh Smith had 22 points and 18 rebounds to lead the Hawks
past Boston at Philips Arena. Rondo and Kevin Garnett had 20
points each to lead the Celtics.  Allen’s Absence  Allen, 36, missed a playoff game for the first time in his
17-year career because of a sore right ankle. He has played in
110 postseason games for  Milwaukee , Seattle and the Celtics.  Rondo, who led the NBA by averaging 11.7 assists per game
during the regular season, got thrown out in the game’s final
minute after the Celtics had whittled a 19-point Atlanta lead to
four points.  “It affects us a lot, he’s our leader,” Garnett told
reporters. “Whatever the decision is, we have to be able to
play without him, and we’ll be prepared either way.”  In Memphis, the Grizzlies -- who led by as many as 27
points -- missed 13 of their final 14 shots. Chris Paul, who had
14 points and 11 assists for the Clippers, hit two free throws
with 24 seconds left for the victory.  “I don’t think I’ve been part of a game like that, ever,”
the Clippers’  Blake Griffin , who had 17 points, said in a news
conference. “It was unbelievable.”  Butler Breaks Hand  Clippers starting forward Caron Butler, 32, broke his left
hand in the third quarter and  Los Angeles  said his status for
the rest of the series had not yet been determined.  Tony Parker scored 28 points as host San Antonio defeated
the  Utah Jazz  106-91. The Spurs, the top seeds in the Western
Conference, are seeking a fifth NBA title after successes in
1999, 2003, 2005 and 2007.  Kobe Bryant  had 31 points and Andrew Bynum had a triple-
double with 10 points, 13 rebounds and 10 blocks for the Lakers,
who held the visiting Nuggets to 36 percent shooting in their
103-88 victory. The Lakers won the latest of their 16 NBA titles
in 2010.  Tonight’s three games including the second of the series
between the  New York Knicks  and  Miami Heat . Miami won the opener
100-67 two days ago at home and also hosts tonight’s game. Also,
Orlando tries for its second straight win on the road against
Indiana and Oklahoma City seeks a 2-0 series advantage against
visiting Dallas.  To contact the reporters on this story:
