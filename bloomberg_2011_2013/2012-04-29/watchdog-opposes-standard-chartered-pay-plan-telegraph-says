PIRC, a U.K. corporate governance
activist organization, is urging  Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) 
shareholders to vote against the bank’s remuneration report at
its annual general meeting on May 9, the Sunday Telegraph said,
citing a copy of PIRC’s recommendations.  The bank, which paid $92 million to its top 13 bankers,
hasn’t disclosed its long-term bonus targets and the pay plan is
geared toward short-term performance, the newspaper quoted PIRC
as saying in its guidance.  Standard Chartered spokesman Jonathan Tracey didn’t
immediately respond to a message left on his voicemail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
