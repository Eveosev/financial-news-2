Barclays Plc (BARC)  hired Martina
Bigliardi Moehr from Credit Suisse Group AG’s Clariden Leu unit
to open and head a new Zurich office that will offer private
banking services to ultra-wealthy Russian clients.  Moehr previously looked after Russian, central-European and
Israeli customers for UBS AG, Barclays’s Geneva-based Swiss 
private bank said today in an e-mailed statement. She will work
closely with investment bankers to provide institutional-type
services to clients with more than 50 million pounds ($81
million) of investable assets, the firm said.  Barclays, which plans to hire relationship managers for the
new office over the summer, is trying to close the gap on larger
Swiss private banks. The Swiss unit said in January that assets
under management rose by a “low double-digit percentage” to
almost 18 billion Swiss francs ($19.9 billion) last year.  “ Switzerland  is one of our key hubs from which we serve
global high-net worth clients and intermediaries,”  Patrick Ramsey , head of Barclays in Switzerland, said in the statement.
“The development of a Zurich office has been one of our key
strategic goals for some time.”  Barclays managed 164.2 billion pounds globally for wealth-
management clients at the end of December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
