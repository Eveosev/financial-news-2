Oil’s April trading range is the
tightest for any month in 17 years as concern eased that
supplies would be disrupted and reports showed slower U.S.
economic growth.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows the percentage difference
between the monthly high and low beginning with April 1983. This
month’s price has ranged from $100.68 to $105.49 a barrel, a
difference of 4.8 percent. That’s the smallest since February
1995, when the price ranged from $18.13 to $18.98.  “The oil market has found equilibrium right now,” said
 Tom Bentz , a director with BNP Paribas Prime Brokerage Inc. in
 New York . “There will have to be some more significant news to
get us to move out of the recent range.”  Crude rose to $110.55 a barrel on March 1 as Western
nations prepared sanctions against  Iran , then slipped as tension
eased. U.S. gross domestic product growth slowed to a 2.2
percent rate in the first quarter, according to the Commerce
Department.  “There have been some real negative economic headlines,
but they weren’t sufficient to move the market lower,” Bentz
said.  The record high difference is 81.9 percent, set in January
1991 when the Persian  Gulf War  began. The price ranged from $18
to $32.75 that month. The difference exceeded 60 percent in
October 2008 and December 2008 as oil fell to $32.40 a barrel in
December from the all-time high of $147.27 in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
