Rafael Nadal  beat fellow Spaniard
David Ferrer 7-6 (7-1), 7-5 in the Barcelona Open final to
become the first tennis player to win two separate ATP World
Tour events seven times.  Second-ranked Nadal has beaten Ferrer, the world No. 6, in
the Barcelona final four times, and has won 34 straight matches
at the clay-court tournament. He ended a 10-month streak without
a title last week by defeating top-ranked Novak Djokovic to take
his eighth straight Monte Carlo Masters championship.  “It’s almost unimaginable to win here seven times,” Nadal
said yesterday after beating Ferrer. “I am very happy to win
two titles in a row and to start the clay-court season like
this.”  Nadal, 25, is on a 21-match winning streak on clay since
losing to Djokovic in last year’s Rome final. He’ll try to win
his seventh French Open title when the year’s second Grand Slam
tournament starts May 27 in Paris.  Nadal saved five set points in the 12th game to reach the
tiebreaker against Ferrer. The 10-time major champion raced to a
3-1 lead in the second set before Ferrer came back to earn the
chance to serve for the set. He was unable to convert and lost
his next service game at love to fall to a 14th loss in 18
meetings against Nadal.  Gilles Simon  won his third title in Bucharest and 10th
overall by defeating Fabio Fognini 6-4, 6-3.  The Frenchman has won the clay-court tournament the last
three times he’s played in Bucharest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
