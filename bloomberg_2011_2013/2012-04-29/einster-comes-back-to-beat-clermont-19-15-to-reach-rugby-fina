Leinster came back to defeat
Clermont 19-15 in  France  to reach the Heineken Cup final as
Irish side tries to win European rugby union’s top club
competition for the third time in four years.  Clermont was leading 12-6 at halftime of the semifinal at
Stade Chaban-Delmas as Brock James kicked four penalties. The
home team could only manage one more penalty from James for the
rest of the game as Leinster took control with a try from Cian
Healy and a drop-goal from  Rob Kearney .  Leinster will meet Ulster in the May 19 final at Twickenham
in  London . Ulster beat Edinburgh 22-19 yesterday in the other
semifinal to reach the title game for the first time in 13
years.  Leinster beat Northampton 33-22 in last year’s final, and
took the victory over Leicester in 2009, 19-16. Toulouse beat
Biarritz 21-19 in the 2010 final. Ulster defeated Colomiers 21-6
in its previous final appearance in 1999.  Jonny Sexton’s penalty kicks accounted for Leinster’s
first-half points. After James made it a 1-point game in the
second period, Sexton kicked another. A Wesley Fofana try was
disallowed after a video review, and Leinster was able to keep
the French side off the scoreboard.  Yesterday in Dublin, Ruan Pienaar kicked 17 points to lead
Ulster to the home win. Pienaar booted five penalties and
converted Pedrie Wannenburg’s first-half try.  Greg Laidlaw kicked 14 points and James Thompson touched
down for Edinburgh, the first Scottish team to reach the
Heineken Cup semifinals.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
