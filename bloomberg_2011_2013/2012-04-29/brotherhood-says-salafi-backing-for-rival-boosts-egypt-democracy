The Muslim Brotherhood’s
presidential hopeful said the endorsement of his chief Islamist
rival by  Egypt ’s largest Salafi bloc is good for the country’s
democratic efforts.  Mohamed Mursi, the head of the Brotherhood’s political arm,
the Freedom and Justice Party, said al-Nour’s backing of Abdel
Moneim Aboul-Fotouh “enriches the democratic process and shows
that society is not divided on the basis of who’s Islamist and
who’s non-Islamist,” according to an e-mailed statement today
from the FJP, which holds the largest bloc of seats in
parliament’s lower house.  Islamist groups have been divided over which candidate to
support in the presidential elections that begin on May 23.
Aboul-Fotouh is seen as one of the strong contenders in the race
that includes 12 others, including the former secretary general
of the  Arab League , Amre Moussa, and Ahmed Shafik, who briefly
served as ousted President  Hosni Mubarak ’s last prime minister.  Al-Nour said in a statement on its website that Aboul-
Fotouh won the backing of 75 percent of its leadership. The move
came days after Mursi won the backing of another Salafi
movement. Salafis follow an austere interpretation of Islam.  Aboul-Fotouh has been courting secularists,  Coptic
Christians  and others in a bid to cast himself as a candidate
for all Egyptians, albeit one with Islamist credentials. He fell
out with the Brotherhood after declaring his candidacy at a time
when the group’s leadership said they were not going to field a
nominee for the vote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
