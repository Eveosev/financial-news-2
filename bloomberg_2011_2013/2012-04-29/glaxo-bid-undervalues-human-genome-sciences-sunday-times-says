GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) ’s $2.6 billion
offer for  Human Genome Sciences Inc. (HGSI)  “completely undervalues”
the company according to a major shareholder, the Sunday Times
reported.  Mark Evans  from Taube Hodson Stonex Partners LLP, a fund
manager that owns 5.6 percent of the U.S. drugs maker, termed
the bid “unacceptable,” the London-based newspaper said.  Human Genome rejected Glaxo’s $13-a-share cash offer on
April 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
