U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron
said it was “not true” that he had “some big deal” with  News
Corp. (NWSA)  Chairman Rupert Murdoch and his company to back their bid
for  British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc (BSY)  in return for political
support.  Cameron told BBC television today he also never had any
“inappropriate discussions” about the offer.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
