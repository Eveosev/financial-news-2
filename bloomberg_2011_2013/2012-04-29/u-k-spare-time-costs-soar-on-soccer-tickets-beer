Britons partying during the
economic boom or trying to forget their woes in the recession
have seen the cost of filling their leisure time soar in the
past decade.  Prices for soccer tickets led the surge in the 10 years
though March, rising 184 percent to an average 48.90 pounds
($79.35), according to a report published today by Lloyds
Banking Group Plc’s Halifax division. Getting away for the day
by car or train jumped 89 percent and 61 percent respectively,
compared with a 29 percent increase in overall consumer prices.  The costs of 10 out of 11 leisure activities, including
buying a beer in a bar, visiting a theme park and going to the
cinema, outpaced inflation, the report showed. Only gardening
lagged behind inflation, with a 17 percent increase in a decade.
With consumer-price inflation now at 3.5 percent, three times
wage growth, households may have less to spend on fun.  “Rising transport costs have been a clear driver behind”
the higher prices, said  Martin Ellis , chief economist at
Halifax. While cooling inflation this year may ease the squeeze
on consumers, “weak earnings growth is likely to constrain the
amount families are able to spend in entertaining the family
over the coming months.”  The Halifax report also showed that the cost of going to
gym has risen 48 percent in the past decade. Eating out advanced
42 percent, though getting takeout and watching television
doesn’t provide much better value, with those costs up 36
percent and 39 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
