Morgan Stanley (MS)  may take control of
Citypoint, a 36-story tower in  London â€™s financial district,
after Beacon Capital Partners Inc. failed to agree a rescue
plan, the  Sunday Times  reported without saying where it got the
information.  Beacon Capital has missed several interest payments on the
Morgan Stanley loan used to buy Citypoint in 2007, the London-
based newspaper said. A plan to rearrange its borrowings and add
new equity was blocked by an activist hedge fund that bought
some of the debt, the Sunday Times reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
