A pilot program in  Shanghai  to
change the way some businesses are taxed is “showing results”
and will be expanded, the Ministry of Finance said in  a report 
on its website.  The new rules reduced the tax burden for the businesses
covered under the trial and has spurred development of the
service industry, according to the report dated yesterday.
Finance Minister  Xie Xuren  and his deputy were in Shanghai to
evaluate the pilot program, the ministry said.  Shanghai on Jan. 1 replaced a tariff levied on the revenue
of some companies in the transport and other service sectors
with a value-added tax to avoid double taxation. China wants
local governments to implement tax-reduction policies to help
small and medium-sized enterprises remain competitive amid the
global economic slowdown.  At the end of March, 129,000 companies were involved in the
trial, according to the report.  The success of the Shanghai pilot program may lead to
nationwide implementation in the next 18 months, Lachlan Wolfers,
a Shanghai-based partner at accounting firm KPMG LLP in  China ,
said March 26.  The program may be expanded to cover asset leasing,
transportation, and other  service industries  in the
municipalities of Beijing, Chongqing and Tianjin by July 1, and
in the southern city of Shenzhen and eastern province of Jiangsu
by early-2013, Wolfers said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
