Transocean Ltd. (RIG)  has returned staff
to a drilling rig in Brazil that was evacuated after it started
taking on water and listed in Guanabara Bay in  Rio de Janeiro .  Transocean is pumping water out of the rig and the
situation is safe, spokesman Guy Cantwell said in an e-mailed
response to questions. The rig is in Guanabara Bay for scheduled
maintenance, he said.  There were no reports of fuel spills and the rig doesnâ€™t
carry crude oil, Cantwell said in a telephone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
