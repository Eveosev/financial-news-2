Sytrol,  Syria â€™s state-run oil
company, kept the official selling price of its Souedie crude
exports for March unchanged, said a company official.  Souedie crude, also known as Syrian Heavy, will be priced
at a discount of $9.25 a barrel to the Dated Brent benchmark,
the official said today. He declined to be identified, citing
company policy.  Syria pumped 140.9 million barrels of crude last year, of
which 57.4 million barrels were exported, the Oil Ministry said
in a Jan. 27 statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
