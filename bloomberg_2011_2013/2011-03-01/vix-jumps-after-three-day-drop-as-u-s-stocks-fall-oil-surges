The benchmark index for U.S. stock
options rose for the first time in four days as oil surged amid
speculation unrest in the Middle East and northern  Africa  will
disrupt supplies and stocks sank on concern about energy costs.  The VIX, as the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility
Index is known, jumped 15 percent to 21.01 today. The index
measures the cost of using options as insurance against declines
in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, which dropped 1.6 percent to
1,306.33.  “The VIX is the uncertainty gauge: It moves in relation to
the amount of uncertainty,” said Austin, Texas-based Randy Frederick, the director of trading and derivatives for San
Francisco-based Charles Schwab Corp., which has eight million
brokerage accounts. “Anytime there’s a big negative move in the
market, people get a little concerned about what might be going
to happen next, so the VIX has a tendency to spike higher.”  Energy prices jumped as unrest threatened to spread from
Libya to  Iran , OPEC’s second-largest oil producer. Oil for April
delivery rallied 2.7 percent to settle at $99.63 a barrel, the
highest since Sept. 30, 2008. Concern higher energy costs will
hurt consumer spending and corporate profits overshadowed data
showing that U.S. manufacturing grew at the fastest pace since
2004. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke today said the
increase in oil and other commodity prices probably won’t cause
a permanent increase in broader inflation.  The most-active VIX options were the May $40 calls, which
accounted for almost one-fifth of all call volume and advanced
35 percent. VIX March futures gained 10 percent to 21.20.  In  Europe , the benchmark gauge of stock-market volatility
jumped as well. The  VStoxx Index , which measures the cost of
protecting against a decline in shares on the Euro Stoxx 50
Index, gained 4.9 percent to 23.82 in  Frankfurt . The Euro Stoxx
50 stock index dropped 1 percent to 2,983.27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
