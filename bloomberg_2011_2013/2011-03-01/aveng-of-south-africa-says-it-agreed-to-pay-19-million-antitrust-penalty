  Aveng Ltd ., South Africa’s largest
construction and engineering company, will pay 128.9 million
rand ($18.5 million) to settle antitrust fines, denting first-
half earnings per share by as much as 35 percent.  The settlement for breaches of competition law at its
Steeledale unit is the equivalent of 8 percent of the turnover
of the steel business in the year ended June 30, 2008, the
Johannesburg-based company said in a statement today.  One of the fines is for historical antitrust violations at
its steel-mesh business, which was referred to the Competition
Tribunal in December 2009, according to the statement. The
second fine is for a complaint about past anticompetitive
behavior in the reinforcing steel bar market in  South Africa .  Earnings per share excluding one-time items, and basic
earnings a share will be between 30 percent and 35 percent lower
than a year earlier for the six-month period ended Dec. 31,
according to the statement. Aveng previously forecast on Jan. 31
that earnings per share for the period would be between 15
percent and 20 percent lower.  “In the light of these cases three employees of Steeledale
have been suspended, pending an internal enquiry,” it said.
Aveng “agreed with the  Competition Commission  that the penalty
will be paid in four equal installments over a period of 24
months from the date of the tribunal order.”  The stock fell as much as 2.7 percent, or 98 cents, to
35.60 rand in Johannesburg and was trading at 36.10 rand as of
3:22 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
