American Airlines parent  AMR Corp .
trimmed full-year capacity growth this year to blunt the effect
of jet-fuel prices at the highest level since 2008.  Available seats on American and regional carrier American
Eagle will rise 3 percent, down from an earlier plan of 4.3
percent, AMR said today in a U.S. regulatory filing. The  Fort
Worth , Texas-based company fell 2.7 percent as an index of U.S.
airline stocks tumbled to a five-month low.  AMR follows Atlanta-based  Delta Air Lines Inc . in cutting
growth plans as crude and jet fuel climb on concern that Middle
East oil supplies may be interrupted. U.S. carriers also have
raised fares across most of their networks five times in 2011 to
help offset the additional expense.  “If you boost prices to cover higher fuel costs, that is
almost certainly going to reduce the level of demand,”  David Swierenga , president of aviation consultant AeroEcon in  Round
Rock ,  Texas , said in an interview. “It’s just good economics to
tailor your capacity to the expected lower level of demand.”  Jet fuel for immediate delivery in New York harbor rose 13
cents, or 4.1 percent, to $3.22 a gallon today, its highest
since September 2008. Fuel, which is among the two biggest
expenses for airlines, has climbed 25 percent this year.  AMR slid 18 cents to $6.56 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The Bloomberg U.S. Airlines Index
declined 3.5 percent, paced by  US Airways Group Inc .’s drop of
66 cents, or 7.7 percent, to $7.95. Delta fell 63 cents, or 5.6
percent, to $10.61.  Capacity Plan  AMR originally said it would boost international capacity
at American by 7.5 percent in 2011 and domestic capacity by
about 1 percent, for a total increase of 3.5 percent. When
combined with Eagle, the increase was 4.3 percent.  “In light of the current environment, in particular recent
fuel price trends, we are trimming back our capacity plan for
2011,” said Andy Backover, an American spokesman.  Delta on Feb. 3 lowered its plans for capacity growth this
quarter to no more than 5 percent, down from earlier plans to
expand by as much as 7 percent. The airline said at that time it
was “revising full-year plans to reflect new fuel levels,”
without giving specifics.  AMR said today that winter storms in the first two months
of the year reduced revenue by about $50 million. Storms forced
the cancellation of 8,000 flights in the first 45 days of the
year, the company said.  American also disclosed it agreed last month to acquire a
third Boeing Co. 777-300ER as it expands international flying.
The aircraft, to be delivered in 2013, joins two others American
ordered in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
