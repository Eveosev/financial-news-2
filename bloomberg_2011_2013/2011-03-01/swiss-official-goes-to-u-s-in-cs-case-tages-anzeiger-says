Michael Ambuehl, Switzerland’s state
secretary to the  finance ministry , is traveling to the U.S.
after the arrest of a  Credit Suisse Group AG  employee and
charges against four other bankers, Tages-Anzeiger reported,
without saying where it got the information.  Ambuehl’s spokesman Mario Tuor was quoted as saying there
is regular contact during which “current bilateral finance and
tax questions are discussed.”  Ambuehl plans to offer the U.S. a system of
“regularization of the past” as with Germany and the U.K.,
including a withholding tax and an amnesty for the Swiss
bankers, Tages-Anzeiger reported, without giving details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
