  Yemen ’s government has started a
$40,000 emergency “income-generating project” to some 200
families in the province of Saada, state-run Saba News Agency

fabric and livestock to the families with assistance from the
Islamic Relief Organization, as well as provide assistance to
displaced residents living in Saada, the report said.  The northern province of Saada is a stronghold of Yemen’s
Houthi rebels, who have been fighting the government since 2004,
