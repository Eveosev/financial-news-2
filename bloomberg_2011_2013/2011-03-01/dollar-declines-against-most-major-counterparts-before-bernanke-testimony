The dollar fell against most of its
major counterparts on speculation  Federal Reserve  Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will tell a Senate panel economic stimulus will
continue as bets rose that interest rates will go up elsewhere.  The yen and Swiss franc slumped as investors sought higher-
yielding assets. The euro gained versus the dollar as the
European Commission raised its growth forecast and said
inflation may stay above the  European Central Bank ’s limit for
most of 2011.  “It has become the market view that the ECB and Bank of  England , and maybe the  Bank of Canada , will raise rates before
the Federal Reserve,” said  Michael Woolfolk , senior currency
strategist in New York at Bank of New York Mellon Corp., the
world’s largest custodial bank, with more than $20 trillion in
assets under administration. “The data and events this week
will be focused on fine-tuning the path of  interest rates .”  The dollar weakened 0.1 percent to $1.3825 per euro at 9:19
a.m. in New York, from $1.3806 yesterday. The shared currency
rose 0.6 percent to 113.60 versus the yen, from 112.91. Japan’s
currency lost 0.5 percent to 82.18 per dollar, and the franc
fell 0.4 percent to 1.2879 per euro.  The yen fell against all of its most traded counterparts.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index due this month
rose 0.3 percent before a report that economists said will show
manufacturing expanded at the fastest in almost seven years.  Bernanke Testimony  Bernanke is scheduled to deliver a semiannual report on
monetary policy at 10 a.m.  New York  time to the Senate Banking
Committee and is due to testify to the House Financial Services
Committee tomorrow.  Gross domestic product in the euro region may increase 1.6
percent this year, above an earlier forecast of 1.5 percent
growth, the Brussels-based commission said in a report published
today. Inflation will average 2.2 percent, the agency forecast,
up from a November estimate of 1.8 percent. Inflation in the 17-
nation bloc quickened to 2.4 percent last month from 2.3 percent
in January, the European Union’s  statistics office  in Luxembourg
said today in a preliminary estimate.  “For the past couple of days we’ve seen some broader-based
dollar weakness, especially against the G-10 currencies,” said  Amelia Bourdeau , a currency strategist in  Stamford ,  Connecticut ,
at UBS AG. “People expect the Fed to hike rates later compared
to others in the G-10.”  The ECB has held its benchmark interest rate at 1 percent
since May 2009.  Canadian Dollar  The Canadian dollar traded near the strongest level in more
than three years as the Bank of Canada kept its benchmark
interest rate at 1 percent and policy makers said they
will carefully consider future increases in a recovery that is
“slightly faster” than they forecast.  The currency traded at 97.28 cents per  U.S. dollar , down
0.1 percent, after touching 96.84 cents, the strongest since
November 2007.  The Swedish krona advanced 0.4 percent to 6.3014 against
the dollar, after appreciating 1.6 percent yesterday. Versus the
euro, it strengthened 0.3 percent to 8.7069. It has gained this
year versus all of its 16 most-traded counterparts.  Sweden’s gross domestic product expanded 1.2 percent in the
fourth quarter from 2.1 percent in the prior three months,
Stockholm-based  Statistics Sweden  said today on its website.
That compares with a 1 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey of 17 economists. Annual growth was at 7.3 percent, the
fastest pace in at least 15 years.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s U.S. manufacturing
index rose to 61.0 in February, the highest since May 2004,
economists in a Bloomberg survey forecast before today’s report.  Australian Dollar    Australia ’s dollar gained for a third day against the
Japanese currency, appreciating 0.4 percent to 83.65 yen as a
government report showed retail sales gained 0.4 percent in
January from a month earlier. That beat the 0.3 percent median
forecast in a Bloomberg survey.  Japan’s benchmark interest rate of as low as zero compares
with Australia’s 4.75 percent rate attracting investors to the
South Pacific nation’s higher-yielding assets.  The euro completed a third monthly advance versus the
dollar in February before the ECB holds its next policy meeting
on March 3. ECB governing council member  Mario Draghi  said on
Feb. 26 that inflation pressures are forcing policy makers to
focus more on the timing of interest rate increases.    Europe ’s shared currency has risen 1.3 percent this year,
while the dollar has lost 2.2 percent, according to Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes, which track the
currencies of 10 developed nations. The dollar dropped yesterday
to the lowest since August 2008, according to the indexes.  To contact the reporters on this story:
