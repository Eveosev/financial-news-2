  China ’s interest-rate swaps rose the
most in more than a week on speculation the central bank will
raise the amount of cash banks must set aside as reserves by the
end of this week.  The last reserve-requirement increase took effect Feb. 24,
the fifth since October, with the ratio rising to 19.5 percent
from 19 percent. Policy makers may announce another hike as soon
as March 4, said Pin Ru Tan, a Singapore-based strategist at
Royal Bank of Scotland Group.  “When we reach the end of next week, there’ll be 350
billion yuan ($53.2 billion) worth of central bank bills that
would’ve matured since the last increase,” said Tan. There’s a
chance of another to “mop up liquidity,” she said.  The one-year swap contract tied to the seven-day repurchase
rate climbed six basis points to 3.77 percent as of 11:47 a.m.
in  Shanghai , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The repo
rate, a gauge of the availability of funds, was little changed
at 3.01 percent compared with yesterday’s 3.03 percent,
according to a daily fixing from the National Interbank Funding
Center published at 11 a.m.  The People’s Bank of China sold 1 billion yuan of one-year
bills today in open market operations, keeping the yield
unchanged for a second week at 2.9972 percent. The central bank
added funds to the financial system for a 15th week in the five
days ended Feb. 24, pumping in 76 billion yuan, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on the government’s 3.77 percent bond due
December 2020 rose two basis points to 3.96 percent, according
to Chinabond, the nation’s biggest debt-clearing house. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
