Tropical Bank Ltd., a Libyan-owned
Ugandan lender, will be unaffected by United Nations-backed
sanctions imposed on the North African country, the Bank of  Uganda  said.  “The current situation in  Libya  does not in any way affect
the financial sector in Uganda,” the Kampala-based central bank
said in a statement published today in the Daily Monitor
newspaper. “Tropical Bank Ltd. is very well capitalized. Total
capital is well above the minimum regulatory requirements.”  Libya Foreign Bank owns 99.7 percent of Tropical, while the
Ugandan government owns the rest, according to the lender’s
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
