Britain’s opposition  Labour Party  is
four percentage points ahead of the governing Conservatives in
public estimation, at 39 percent against 35 percent, according
to the latest ComRes public opinion survey carried out for the
Independent.  The Liberal Democrats, the junior partners in the
Conservative-led coalition government, are favoured by 12
percent, the newspaper said.  Labour is down three points, the Conservatives are down one
point and the Liberal Democrats up one point, compared with the
last ComRes poll two weeks ago, the Independent said.  Labour had majority support among the estimated 11 million
people on low and middle incomes whom Labour leader  Ed Miliband 
has identified as being squeezed by the government’s spending
and tax policies, the newspaper said.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
