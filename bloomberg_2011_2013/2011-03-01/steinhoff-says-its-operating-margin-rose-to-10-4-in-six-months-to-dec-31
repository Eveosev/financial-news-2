  Steinhoff International Holdings
Ltd .,  Africa ’s largest furniture maker, said fiscal first-half
profit rose 5.6 percent as its logistics and automotive units
performed better.  Net income increased to 1.67 billion rand ($240 million) in
the six months through December from 1.58 billion rand a year
earlier, the Johannesburg-based company said in a statement
today.  Sales fell 3.4 percent to 24 billion rand, hurt by the
South African currency’s 15 percent gain against the euro for
the period under review, the statement said. More than half of
revenue is reported in currencies other than the rand.  Steinhoff’s operating margin widened to 10.4 percent in the
period from 10.1 percent a year earlier, as the company improved
purchasing practices and hedging protected it against rising
raw-material costs.  The logistics division, which provides services including
warehouse and distribution-network management, posted a 12
percent increase in sales. The automotive division, which sells
and rents cars, had a 14 percent revenue gain.  In January the company agreed to buy  PPR  SA’s Conforama
chain for 1.21 billion euros ($1.67 billion) to strengthen its
position in Europe. Conforama operates 236 furniture stores in  Europe , including 186 in  France .  The Conforama deal will probably be completed "in the
coming weeks,’’ Steinhoff said today. “The proposed acquisition
represents a great advance towards the completion of our mass-
market retail footprint in continental Europe, and in addition
will accelerate growth within the existing supply chain."  To contact the reporter on this story:
