  Cookson Group Plc , the world’s
biggest maker of ceramic linings for metal smelters, rose the
most in five weeks after returning to profit and making its
first payout since August 2008.  Net income last year was 145.3 million pounds ($236.6
million), or 52.2 pence a share, compared with a loss of 48.5
million pounds, or 17.8 pence, in 2009, the London-based company
said in a statement today. Revenue climbed 30 percent to 2.55
billion pounds.  “Assuming the global economy continues to recover, we
think we can produce results well ahead of 2010,” Chief
Executive Officer Nick Salmon said in a telephone interview.  Cookson, which makes components for the electronics, steel
and heavy machinery industries, is benefiting from faster
economic growth in emerging markets such as  Asia , eastern  Europe , Brazil and  South Africa , where it generates half of its
revenue. Only 6 percent of its sales are in the U.K.  The shares increased 34 pence, or 5.2 percent, to 688 pence
at the 4:30 p.m. close in London trading, the biggest rise since
Jan. 26, extending the gain over the past six months to 55
percent.  Cookson declared a dividend of 11.5 pence a share. It
expects to increase the payout by more than 10 percent a year in
line with the increase in earnings, Salmon said.  Profit and sales were in line with analysts’ estimates
after company forecasts in January, when Cookson set out revenue
targets until 2013. Earnings per share beat estimates because of
a lower-than-expected  tax rate .  To contact the reporter on this story:
