European Union Trade Commissioner
Karel De Gucht comments on China’s policy on the yuan’s exchange
rate. He spoke at a conference today in Brussels.  “Currencies should reflect economic reality.”  “The Chinese have been revaluing their currency; some will
say only marginally. I would say they have gone further.”  “I believe this will continue, not that much because we are
asking for it, but because they have to switch to another growth
model which is more and more based on domestic consumption.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
