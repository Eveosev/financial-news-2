Prosecutors asked a judge to order
medical examiners not to release autopsy results in the case of
Jared Lee Loughner, the suspect in a Jan. 8 shooting in Tucson,
Arizona, that killed six people and wounded 13 others, including
U.S. Representative  Gabrielle Giffords .  Detailed information on the autopsies “could taint the
jury pool,” Assistant U.S. Attorney  Mary Sue Feldmeier  said in
a motion filed yesterday in U.S. District Court in Arizona.  “This case has received extensive media coverage” and
reports describing the victims’ physical trauma “may spawn
prejudicial depictions of the decedents’ manner of death in the
press,” Feldmeier wrote. Prosecutors are also seeking a gag
order to prevent pathologist  Eric D. Peters  and his staff from
talking to reporters, according to the filing.  Loughner, 22, pleaded not guilty to attempting to kill
Giffords and two members of her staff. U.S. District Judge Larry Burns said last month he hoped to begin a trial no later than
Sept. 20.  The case is U.S. v. Loughner, 11-00187, U.S. District
Court, District of  Arizona  (Tucson).  To contact the reporter on this story:
