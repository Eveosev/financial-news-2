German 10-year bond yields rose to
the highest in more than a week before a report forecast to show
euro-area inflation stayed above the  European Central Bank ’s 2
percent ceiling for a third month in February.  The two-year yield was within four basis points of an 18-
month high. Inflation in the 17-nation bloc quickened to 2.4
percent in February, from 2.3 percent a month earlier, according
to the median forecast of 31 economists in a Bloomberg survey.
Irish 10-year bonds fell as talks began on forming a new
government following a Feb. 25 election at which no party won a
majority. The Netherlands plans to sell at least 5 billion euros
of 2021 bonds today. Austria will also auction debt.  “Things aren’t quite as rosy as they were for fixed income
last week,” said Eric Wand, a rates strategist at Lloyds Bank
Corporate Markets in  London . “It’s a busy supply week. The
European Central Bank is looking at the inflation picture with
some concern at the moment.”  German 10-year yields were two basis points higher at 3.19
percent as of 9:28 a.m. in London. The 2.5 percent security due
January 2021 fell 0.165, or 1.65 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,379)
face amount, to 94.23. Two-year yields climbed three basis
points to 1.55 percent.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index gained 0.6 percent and the MSCI
Asia Pacific Index of shares climbed 1.1 percent, sapping demand
for the relative safety of sovereign debt.  Austria plans to auction securities maturing in 2015 and
2022. Belgium and Malta will sell bills.  Rate Bets  Three-month Euribor futures fell, pushing the implied yield
up two basis points to 1.96 percent, which has risen from 1.33
percent at the end of 2010, as traders added to bets that the
ECB will boost borrowing costs.  The central bank holds its next policy meeting on March 3.
It has kept its key interest rate at a record low of 1 percent
since May 2009 and is forecast to leave it unchanged, according
to all 53 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  ECB governing council member  Mario Draghi  said on Feb. 26
that inflation pressures are forcing policy makers to focus more
on the timing of interest rate increases.  Ireland’s 10-year bond yields rose three basis points to
9.37 percent. Enda Kenny, leader of Ireland’s Fine Gael party,
is starting talks on forming a new government after elections
ejected the ruling Fianna Fail party. Kenny said he will seek to
lower the 5.8 percent interest rate on the country’s aid loans
from the European Union and the  International Monetary Fund .  German  government bonds  handed investors a loss of 1.3
percent this year, compared with 0.1 percent for U.S. Treasuries
and 1.2 percent for U.K. gilts, according to indexes compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies.  To contact the reporters on this story:
