South African tourist arrivals
surged 15.1 percent last year, bolstered by the country’s
hosting of the soccer  World Cup , the world’s most watched
sporting event.  The country attracted 8.07 million visitors, up from 7.01
million in 2009, Tourism Minister Marthinus van Schalkwyk told
reporters in Cape Town today.  “South Africa recorded peak tourist arrivals in June and
July 2010, which is traditionally our low season,” Van
Schalkwyk said. “More than 309,000 tourists arrived in South
Africa for the primary purpose of the World Cup.”  Tourist numbers from  North America  rose 23 percent, while
those from Europe increased 8.1 percent and from Central and
South America 109 percent, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
