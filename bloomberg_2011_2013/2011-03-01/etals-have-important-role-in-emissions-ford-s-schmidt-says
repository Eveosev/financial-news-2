Precious metals have “an important
role” in emissions control, according to Wulf-Peter Schmidt,
manager for sustainability at Ford Motor Co. Schmidt made the
comments on the sidelines of a conference in Brussels today.  “They have an important role in emissions control but we
try to have less material with the same effect.  “We’re talking about palladium, platinum and rhodium.  “The amount of precious metals in catalytic converters is
reduced. It’s already being done.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
