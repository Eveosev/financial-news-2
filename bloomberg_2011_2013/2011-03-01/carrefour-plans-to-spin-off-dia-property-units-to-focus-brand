  Carrefour SA , the world’s second-
largest retailer, said it plans to spin off its Dia discount
chain and 25 percent of its real-estate unit.  Dia shares will be listed on the Madrid stock exchange
after the separation, which the Paris-based company said today
will enable it to focus on developing the Carrefour brand.  The spinoff of Carrefour Property will contribute to
“enhancing the attractiveness and competitiveness of its sites
and allow Carrefour to unlock the embedded value of its real
estate assets,” the retailer said in a statement. The unit will
be listed on the Euronext Paris Stock Exchange.  The spinoffs “are a continuation of the strategy we have
been conducting since 2009, and if approved, will provide
Carrefour with new momentum,” Chief Executive Officer Lars
Olofsson said in the statement, released after markets closed.
“They aim to make the group more focused on its operational
priorities while creating value for our shareholders.”  To contact the reporter on this story:  Andrew Roberts  in Paris at
