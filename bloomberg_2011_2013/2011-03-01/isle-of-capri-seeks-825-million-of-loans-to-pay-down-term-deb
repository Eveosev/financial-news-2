  Isle of Capri Casinos Inc ., the
developer, owner and operator of gaming facilities, is seeking
$825 million of loans to refinance existing bank debt.  The company is in discussions with lenders to raise a $325
million revolving  credit line  maturing 2016 and a $500 million
term loan due 2017, St. Louis-based Isle of Capri said today in
a regulatory filing. The company said it also plans to sell $300
million of senior notes due 2019 to repay existing term loans.    Wells Fargo & Co ., Credit Suisse Group AG and Deutsche Bank
AG are arranging the loans and will host a lender meeting March
3 at 10 a.m. in New York, according to two people briefed on the
transaction.  Isle of Capri plans to offer term-loan lenders an interest
rate 3.5 percentage points more than the London interbank
offered rate, said the people, who declined to be identified
because the terms are private. Libor, the rate banks charge to
lend to each other, will have a 1.25 percent floor.  The company may issue the debt at a so-called original-
issue discount, which reduces proceeds for the borrower and
boosts the yield for investors, the people said.  Jill Haynes, a spokeswoman for Isle of Capri, declined to
comment.  As of Jan. 23, Isle of Capri owed $810.9 million on its
term loans maturing Nov. 25, 2013, and had $79.5 million
outstanding under its $375 million revolver due July 26, 2012,
according to the company’s most recent quarterly report filed
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  In a revolving credit facility, money can be borrowed again
once it’s repaid; in a term loan, it can’t.  Isle of Capri had a weighted average interest rate of 6.47
percent on its credit facility, the quarterly report shows. The
company pays a margin of 3 percentage points more than Libor on
the loans and the lending benchmark has a 2 percent floor for
the term debt, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
