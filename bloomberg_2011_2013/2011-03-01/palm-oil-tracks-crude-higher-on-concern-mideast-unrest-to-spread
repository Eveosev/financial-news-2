  Palm oil  climbed the most in a month
as soybeans and crude oil advanced on speculation that the
turmoil that has cut  Libya ’s crude production may disrupt more
Middle East supplies.  The May-delivery contract rose 2.1 percent to 3,546 ringgit
($1,169) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange, the
biggest gain since Feb. 2. Futures fell 8.9 percent in February,
the first monthly decline since June.  Palm oil futures gained 35 percent in the past year as
adverse weather hurt oilseed crops in the main growing regions,
tightening vegetable oil supplies. Crude oil climbed as much as
0.6 percent as authorities in  Iran , the second-largest producer
in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, arrested
opposition leaders to derail protests scheduled today.  “The protest wind in the Middle East is very strong and
that brings uncertainty to the markets,” Donny Khor, senior
vice president for futures & options at OSK Investment Bank
Bhd., said by phone from  Kuala Lumpur .  Fighting in Libya has shut as much as 1 million barrels a
day of oil output, according to  Barclays Capital , which said in
a note yesterday that the country “remains out of the market.”  Malaysia’s palm-oil exports fell 10.4 percent in February
to 1,110,672 tons from a month ago, independent market surveyor
Intertek said yesterday. Shipments slumped 9.1 percent in the
same period, rival Societe Generale de Surveillance said.  Still, demand for food is growing, Malaysian Plantation
Industries and Commodities Minister Bernard Dompok said on Feb.
25. The Food & Agriculture Organization’s World Food Price Index
gained to an all-time high in January.  ‘Overdone’  Palm oil gained as “traders deemed the recent fall in
Malaysian CPO prices as overdone, especially as the gap between
soyoil and CPO also narrowed after” soybean oil rose in  Chicago , Anand James, an analyst at brokerage Geojit Comtrade
Ltd., said in an e-mail today.  Soybean oil ’s premium over palm
oil narrowed to $102.72 a ton at 6:30 p.m. Singapore time after
widening to $124.62 yesterday, the highest level since November.  Soybeans for May delivery advanced as much as 0.5 percent
to $13.715 bushel and were at $13.7025 at 6:14 p.m. The oilseed
rallied 42 percent in the past year. Soybean oil climbed as much
as 0.7 percent to 57.72 cents per pound.  Palm and soybean oils are substitutes in food and biofuel
uses, and prices can be influenced by shifts in energy costs. As
crude oil prices gain, the attractiveness of biofuels made from
farm commodities increases.  September-delivery palm oil on the  Dalian Commodity
Exchange  fell 0.3 percent to close at 9,428 yuan ($1,435) a ton.
Soybean oil for delivery in the same month closed little changed
at 10,200 yuan. CME Group Inc.’s most-active June palm- oil
contract, pegged to the Malaysian benchmark price, gained 1.2
percent to $1,155 a ton at 5:16 p.m. Singapore time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
