  Coal of Africa Ltd ., a producer of
the fuel in  South Africa , advanced the most in almost two months
in Johannesburg after saying the nation’s Department of Minerals
and Energy accepted its application for new-order mining rights
at the Makhado coking coal project.   The acceptance “now triggers the commencement of a
rigorous process required for the final granting of a full
mining right,” the company said in a stock-exchange filing.  The stock climbed as much as 81 cents, or 8 percent, to
10.89 rand, the biggest intraday gain since Jan. 6. It traded up
61 cents, or 6.2 percent, at 10.69 rand at 10:35 a.m. in
Johannesburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
