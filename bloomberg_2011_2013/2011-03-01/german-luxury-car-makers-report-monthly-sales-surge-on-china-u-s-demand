  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG ,  Daimler
AG  and Audi AG, the world’s three largest luxury-car makers,
said deliveries surged last month on Chinese demand.    Volkswagen AG ’s Audi and BMW posted February sales gains of
about 20 percent, they said today at the Geneva auto show.
Mercedes-Benz’s increase was probably “in the double-digit”
range in percentage terms, Daimler Chief Executive Officer
Dieter Zetsche said.  BMW, Mercedes and Audi are hiring thousands of workers as
they target record 2011 deliveries. The three German
manufacturers are also expanding production to satisfy growing
demand from China, the U.S. and Germany.  “Our business looks very robust,” Audi sales chief Peter Schwarzenbauer told reporters today. This will be the best first
quarter in the company’s history.  BMW, based in Munich, gained as much as 2.32 euros, or 4
percent, to 61.10 euros and was up 2.3 percent as of 1:06 p.m.
in  Frankfurt . Daimler, with its headquarters in Stuttgart,
gained 1.3 percent and Wolfsburg-based VW’s preferred shares
climbed 1.1 percent.  Daimler will recruit more than 10,000 people in 2011 to
staff a new Mercedes-Benz car factory in Hungary and expand
truck capacity in North America, the company said Feb. 24. Audi
plans to add 2,000 employees this year and BMW will hire 1,300.  “We’re off to a fast start and laid a very nice basis”
for future growth, Audi CEO  Rupert Stadler  said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
