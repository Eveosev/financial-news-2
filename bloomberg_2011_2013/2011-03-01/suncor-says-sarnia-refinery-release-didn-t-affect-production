  Suncor Energy Inc . said a release at
its Sarnia refinery in Ontario didn’t affect production at the
84,910-barrel-a-day refinery.  “Everyone accounted for, neighbors notified, all clear
sounded within five minutes, no impacts to operations other than
one worker treated and back on the job,” Brad Bellows, a
company spokesman, said in an e-mail.  A “small release of propane vapor” occurred at the plant
earlier today, Kate Jordan, a spokesman for the Ontario Ministry
of the Environment, said in a telephone interview. “It was
resolved within minutes. It was brief release.”  To contact the reporter on this story:  Aaron Clark  in New York at
