  Swiss Life Holding AG ,  Switzerland â€™s
biggest life insurer, may say second-half profit advanced after
cutting costs and increasing policy sales to wealthy clients.  Net income probably rose to 245 million Swiss francs ($264
million) in the six months to Dec. 31, from 136 million francs a
year earlier, according to the median estimate of five analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. The Zurich-based insurer is due to report
earnings tomorrow at 7:00 a.m. local time.  Swiss Life said in November it was two-thirds the way
through a program to reduce costs by as much as 400 million
francs. The insurer plans to cut its reliance on investment
income by boosting earnings from AWD Holding AG, the German
financial-services broker acquired in 2008, and from its
business selling life products, known as wrappers, to wealthy
clients.  Gross written premiums and deposits received probably
dropped to 9.11 billion francs, analysts said.  The following is a table of analyst estimates and year-
earlier figures in millions of francs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
