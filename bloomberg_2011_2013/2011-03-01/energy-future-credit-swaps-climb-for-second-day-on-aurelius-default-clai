The cost to protect against a
default by Energy Future Holdings Corp. and its Texas
Competitive Electric Holdings Co. unit rose for a second day
after hedge fund Aurelius Capital Management LP said last week
the power company is in default on a $23.9 billion loan.  Swaps on Texas Competitive Electric rose 3 percentage
points to 50 percent upfront, according to data provider CMA.
That’s in addition to 5 percent a year, meaning it would cost $5
million initially and $500,000 annually to protect $10 million
of the company’s debt. The cost for one year of protection
climbed 1.1 percentage point to 16.1, CMA data show.  Aurelius sent a letter to Citigroup Inc., the
administrative agent on the Dallas-based energy company’s credit
line, claiming a loan under Texas Competitive Electric
is in default, according to a Feb. 25 filing with the Securities
and Exchange Commission. The allegations are “utterly
meritless,” Robert Walters, general counsel of Energy Future,
said in a telephone interview that day.  Swaps on Energy Future increased 1.4 percentage points to
42 percent upfront, CMA data show. The cost for one year of
protection is 13.7 percent upfront, CMA data show.  The power company was formerly known as TXU Corp. before
being acquired by KKR & Co. and TPG Capital in 2007. Credit-
default swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to
meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
