  Clearwire Corp ., a startup seeking
to build a nationwide high-speed network, registered to let
investors sell stock worth as much as $536.6 million.  The selling shareholders include Chesapeake Partners and
Highbridge International, Clearwire said today in a regulatory
filing. The company registered for a sale of as many as 108.8
million shares at a proposed maximum price of $4.93.  Clearwire, based in Kirkland,  Washington , said this month
that its network growth, along with cost-cutting efforts, will
allow its existing business to report positive earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, during 2012. In
2010, Clearwire warned investors it was short on cash and could
run out by mid-year. It then raised $1.325 billion in bonds and
exchangeable notes in December.  Clearwire dropped 5 cents to $5.03 at 4 p.m. New York time
in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares have declined 21
percent in the past 12 months.    Sprint Nextel Corp ., Google Inc., Time Warner Cable Inc.,
Comcast Corp., Intel Corp. and other investors pumped $3.2
billion into Clearwire in 2008, seeking to create a fourth-
generation wireless network. Several of those investors also
contributed to a $1.56 billion funding round, when Clearwire was
short on cash.  To contact the reporter on this story:
