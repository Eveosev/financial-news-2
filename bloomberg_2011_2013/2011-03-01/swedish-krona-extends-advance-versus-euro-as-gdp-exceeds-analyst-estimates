Sweden’s krona strengthened to the
highest in 2 1/2 years against the dollar as a report showed the
nation’s economy grew for a fifth consecutive quarter.  The krona climbed as much as 0.6 percent to 6.2889 per
dollar, the highest since August 2008, and was up 0.2 percent to
6.3133 as of 12:26 p.m. in London. It advanced as much as 0.4
percent to 8.7006 per euro, and strengthened versus 15 of its 16
most-traded peers.  Swedish gross domestic product expanded 1.2 percent in the
fourth quarter, down from 2.1 percent in the previous three
months though more than the 1 percent forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. Central bank Governor Stefan Ingves
warned yesterday of higher  interest rates  as the country
experiences the fastest economic recovery in the European Union.  “The krona is driven predominantly by the growth story,”
said  Lee Hardman , a currency strategist at Bank of Tokyo-
Mitsubihsi UFJ Ltd. in London. “The central bank has already
signaled it will raise rates.”  The krona is the best performer this year among a basket of
10 developed-nation currencies, climbing 4.9 percent, according
to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes. That’s more
than twice the jump in the next strongest currency, the pound.
In February, the krona advanced 1.9 percent versus the dollar,
its third monthly increase in a row.  Norway’s krone climbed 0.2 percent today to 5.5871 per
dollar, near the highest in 15 months, and 0.2 percent to 6.011
against the Swiss franc.  To contact the reporters on this story:
