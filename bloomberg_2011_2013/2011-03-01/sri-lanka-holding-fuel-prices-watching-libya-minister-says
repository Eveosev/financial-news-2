  Sri Lanka , which imports all its oil
requirements, will hold fuel prices steady as it has stocks for
45 days that were bought at a cheaper rate, Petroleum Minister
Susil Premajayantha said today.  Sri Lanka is “closely watching” the unrest in  Libya  even
as it expects global  oil prices  to ease amid offers for higher
supplies from other producer nations, Premajayantha said in a
telephone interview from his Colombo office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
