Russian stocks slid by the most in
almost three weeks after metals dropped on concern surging oil
may slow the global economy, damping the appetite for commodity
producers.  The 30-stock Micex Index declined by 1.1 percent to
1,758.44 by the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, its biggest retreat
since Feb. 10 and its first drop in four days. VTB Group,  Russia ’s second-biggest lender, dropped 3.2 percent. OAO
Severstal, the country’s largest steelmaker, and OAO Sberbank,
its biggest bank, both fell by at least 2 percent. The dollar-
denominated  RTS  decreased 0.4 percent to 1,962.66.  Copper fell from a one-week high, with futures for May
delivery falling 0.7 percent to $4,466 a pound at 11:08 a.m. on
the Comex in  New York . Lead, nickel, tin and zinc also dropped
as oil advanced from the lowest price in a week as unrest in the
Middle East threatened to spread from Libya to Iran, OPEC’s
second-largest oil producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
