Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu has decided to raze West Bank settlement outposts
built on private Palestinian land and legalize those on
government-owned property, the daily Haaretz said, without
saying where it got the information.  Netanyahuâ€™s decision was made in response to 15 High Court
petitions asking the outposts be demolished and will mean at
least three small settlements will be razed, the paper said.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
