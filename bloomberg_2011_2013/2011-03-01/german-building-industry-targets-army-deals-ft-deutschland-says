Germany’s construction industry will
seek more partnerships with the country’s armed forces as budget
cuts make contracting out barracks maintenance or canteen
operations more attractive,  Financial Times Deutschland  said,
citing  Hochtief AG  board member Peter Noe.  The value of new public-private partnership projects for
the German construction industry last year was 540 million euros
($746 million), its lowest level since 2005, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
