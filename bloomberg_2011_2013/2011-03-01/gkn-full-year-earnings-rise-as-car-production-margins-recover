  GKN Plc , the U.K. maker of aircraft
components for Airbus SAS, said full-year earnings more than
doubled as global car production recovered and its cost-cutting
program improved margins.  Operating profit from continuing operations surged to 411
million pounds ($668 million) compared with 156 million pounds a
year earlier, the company said in a statement today. JPMorgan
analysts had predicted profit of 399 million pounds. Revenue
rose to 5.4 billion pounds from 4.45 billion pounds.  “The trading environment has seen an improving trend for
GKN’s driveline, powder metallurgy and land systems
businesses,” Chief Executive Officer Kevin Smith said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
