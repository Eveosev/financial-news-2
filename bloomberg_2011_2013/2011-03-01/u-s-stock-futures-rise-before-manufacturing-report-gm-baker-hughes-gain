U.S. stocks slid, sending the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to its first drop in three days, as
concern that rising energy costs will hurt the economic recovery
overshadowed the fastest manufacturing growth since 2004.    Alcoa Inc. (AA)  and  Titanium Metals Corp. (TIE)  fell at least 2.7
percent as crude rose above $99 a barrel amid escalating unrest
in the Middle East and northern Africa.  Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) 
dropped 3.7 percent after receiving a subpoena from the
Securities and Exchange Commission for information on commercial
loans.  Carnival Corp. (CCL)  slid 4.4 percent after the chief operating
officer of the largest cruise-line operator sold 180,000 shares.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.8 percent to
1,316.23 at 12:39 p.m. in New York. The benchmark gauge fell 1.7
percent last week as anti-government uprisings in Libya pushed
oil prices higher. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  dropped
78.07 points, or 0.6 percent, to 12,148.27 today.  “Anyone who thinks that a year from now we’re going to look
at the Middle East and see nothing but candy and roses, that’s
not going to happen,” said Stanley Nabi, New York-based vice
chairman of Silvercrest Asset Management Group, which oversees
$9.5 billion. “Manufacturing, the overall  U.S. economy , is doing
well. Still, that geopolitical situation will be an overhang.”  Stocks erased an earlier advance after crude oil extended
gains amid concern unrest will spread from  Libya  to  Iran . Oil
climbed as much after 1.9 percent as authorities in Iran, the
second-largest producer in the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, arrested opposition leaders to derail
demonstrations scheduled for today.  Bernanke Speaks  Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke, testifying to the
Senate Banking Committee in  Washington , said the surge in oil
probably won’t cause a permanent increase in inflation and
repeated that  interest rates  are likely to stay low. His
comments suggest the Fed will stay on course to complete $600
billion of Treasury purchases through June in an effort to
suppress borrowing costs and safeguard the economic recovery.  “Bernanke’s reiterating that the Fed’s going to stay on
the path they’re on,” said Joseph Veranth, chief investment
officer at Dana Investment Advisors in Brookfield,  Wisconsin ,
which manages $2.8 billion. “That leaves room for inflation
concerns to continue to worry the market.”  The surge in oil overshadowed data showing that factories
added workers and boosted production in February, indicating
more momentum for the expansion. The Institute for Supply
Management’s factory index increased to 61.4, the highest since
May 2004, from 60.8 in January. Readings greater than 50 signal
growth. Estimates of the 77 economists in the Bloomberg survey
ranged from 58.7 to 63.3, with the median at 61.  February Rally  The  S&P 500  rose 3.2 percent in February, extending this
year’s gain to 5.5 percent, amid government measures to
stimulate the economy and higher-than-estimated corporate
earnings. Per-share profit topped estimates at 71 percent of the
463 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported results since
Jan. 10, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Still, metals, crops and fuel beat stocks, bonds and the
dollar for a third straight month in February, the longest
stretch since June 2008, as inflation lifted cotton and cocoa
and investors speculated violence in the Middle East and
northern  Africa  will restrain energy supplies.  The S&P GSCI Total Return Index of 24 commodities gained
3.8 percent in February and rose for a sixth consecutive month,
the longest streak since 2004, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Commodities Top Stocks  The MSCI All-Country World Index of equities in 45 nations
returned 3 percent including dividends, while corporate and
government bonds rose 0.13 percent, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch’s Global Broad Market Index through Feb. 25. The
U.S. Dollar Index, a gauge of the currency against six
counterparts such as the euro and yen, fell 1.1 percent in the
month.  “These commodity price increases are staggering,” said  Kevin Rendino , a money manager at New York-based  BlackRock Inc. (BLK) ,
which oversees $3.45 trillion. “Each commodity is different,
but there is a supply issue for oil. There has been real
economic demand for these commodities since the economy began
recovering.”  Alcoa, the largest U.S. aluminum producer, fell 2.7 percent
to $16.40, the biggest decline in the Dow. Material stocks slid
1.6 percent, the biggest drop out of 10 groups in the S&P 500.
Titanium Metals slumped 5 percent to $18.05.  Range Resources Slumps  Range Resources Corp. slipped 6.6 percent to $50.73 for the
biggest loss in the S&P 500. The natural-gas producer that is
one of the biggest landholders in the Marcellus Shale field in  Pennsylvania  said it will sell 52,000 acres in the Barnett Shale
in  Texas  for $900 million. FBR Capital Markets cut the stock to
“market perform” from “outperform” on valuation.  Carnival declined 4.4 percent to $40.78. Chief Operating
Officer Howard Frank sold 180,000 shares of the world’s biggest
cruise-line operator at $42.60 each on Feb. 25, according to a
regulatory filing.  Fifth Third dropped 3.7 percent to $14.06. Ohio’s largest
lender said it received a subpoena from the SEC requesting
information regarding accounting on certain commercial loans.
Financial stocks dropped 1.4 percent for the third-biggest
decline out of 10 groups in the S&P 500.  To contact the reporters on this story:
