Kumar Rachapudi, a Singapore-based
fixed-income strategist at Barclays Plc, comments on the outlook
for  India ’s rupee.  One-month non-deliverable forwards for the currency gained
0.2 percent to 45.45 per dollar as of 11:33 a.m. in Singapore,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts reflect
bets the rupee will decline 0.6 percent from the spot rate of
45.185.  “We are pretty flat on the outlook. We expect the rupee to
trade between 45 and 46 to the dollar during the whole year. We
expect the currency to weaken in the near term, largely based on
higher  oil prices .  “The budget definitely didn’t have any impact on the
currency.  While policy makers have made efforts to “attract more
inflows into infrastructure projects in terms of  capital
spending , I don’t think there will be huge inflows in the near
term.”  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
