A red dust cloud that covered two
villages in southern  Ukraine  poses “no threat to the
environmental situation” in the city of Nikolaev, United
Company Rusal said today.  After a sharp drop in temperature in Ukraine’s southern
Nikolaev region, the sludge fields of the Nikolaev alumina
refinery were frozen, the Moscow-based aluminum producer said in
an e-mailed response to questions. “Dust that appeared as a
result of freezing was raised by the wind.”  Environmental investigators in Ukraine are checking into
the cloud after residents said they were having headaches and
difficulty breathing,  Russia ’s state-run  Channel One  television
reported. A special commission was formed and may present its
findings as soon as today, the report said.  Sludge in the facility’s reservoir has “no harmful
effects” on the air or soil, Rusal’s press office said by e-
mail. The sludge goes through a six-stage filtration process and
does not contain caustic soda, it said.  “The situation has now normalized,” the company said.
“Rusal undertook all necessary measures to eliminate the
consequences of dusting.”  At least nine people died in  Hungary  in October after the
wall of an alumina refinery’s sludge reservoir burst, unleashing
a torrent of toxic material on neighboring towns.  To contact the reporter on this story:
