Piotr Kalisz, a Warsaw based
economist at Citigroup Inc., comments on Hungary’s fiscal plan,
aimed at cutting public debt to less than 50 percent of gross
domestic product by 2018 unveiled today.  Kalisz made the comments in an e-mailed note.  The plans are “ambitious, but still unconvincing. Although
the overall size of planned fiscal adjustment is ambitious, we
remain skeptical over the chances of its implementation. Today’s
release is unlikely to be a positive surprise.  ‘‘Taking into account the weak fundamentals of the
Hungarian economy, we are not surprised by the initial negative
market reaction - weaker forint, sell-off on Budapest stock
exchange and higher market rates.  ‘‘All in all, we believe the market has priced in so much
good news that room for further bond and forint rallies seems
rather limited. We stick to our opinion that a substantial
upward move in bond yields from current levels seems more likely
than a significant downward move.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
