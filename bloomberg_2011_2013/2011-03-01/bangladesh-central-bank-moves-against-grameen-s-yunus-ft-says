Bangladesh Bank, the country’s
central bank and financial regulator, said  Muhammad Yunus , the
2006 Nobel Peace prize winner and a pioneer of microfinance, is
too old at 70 to be managing director of Grameen Bank, the
Financial Times reported.  In a letter to the  finance ministry  that was presented to
the bank’s board yesterday by Muzammel Huq, Grameen’s
government-appointed chairman, the central bank argued that
Yunus never received regulatory approval to work beyond the
usual retirement age of 60, according to the newspaper.  The government controls 25 percent of the voting membership
of Grameen’s board; in December, Sheikh Hasina Wajed, the prime
minister, accused Yunus of exploiting the poor in the name of
poverty alleviation, the FT said.  Grameen said Yunus is still its managing director and
there’s no suggestion of him being removed from his post, the
newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
