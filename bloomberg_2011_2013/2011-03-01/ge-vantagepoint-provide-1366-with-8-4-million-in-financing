1366 Technologies, a Lexington,
Massachusetts-based solar wafer maker, raised $8.4 million in
financing from  VantagePoint Venture Partners  and  General
Electric Co . unit GE Energy Financial Services.  The amount is an addition to the $20 million of second
round of venture capital financing that brings to a total of $46
million that 1366 has raised from private investors, GE Energy
Financial Services said in a statement today. 1366 has also
received a $4 million funding from the Department of Energy’s
Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy program in October
2009.  The latest financing round includes existing investors
Hanwha Chemical Corp., Ventizz Private Equity AG and North
Bridge Venture Partners, which took part in the previous round
in October.  1366 says its “direct wafer” technology can cut the cost
of silicon wafers, a component used in the production of solar
panels, by 65 percent. The key to this cost reduction is scaling
revenue, the company’s chief executive officer Frank van Mierlo
said yesterday in an interview.  “I think solar power will be cheaper than coal by the end
of this decade,” van Mierlo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
