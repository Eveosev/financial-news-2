  China ’s stocks rose, extending the
benchmark index’s first monthly gain since October, as slowing
growth in manufacturing and home prices eased concerns that the
government will take more tightening measures to tame inflation.  Anhui Conch Cement Co., the nation’s biggest cement maker,
surged to the highest in three years. Poly Real Estate Group Co.,
the second-largest developer, gained the most in seven weeks
after profit rose 40 percent last year.  Industrial & Commercial
Bank of China  Ltd. led gains for lenders after the head of the
National Development & Reform Commission said inflation likely
slowed. The Purchasing Managers’ Index fell to 52.2 in February
from 52.9 in January. Readings above 50 indicate expansion.  “The PMI shows the government’s earlier tightening
measures have proven effective,” said  Li Jun , a strategist at
Central China Securities Co. in Shanghai. “Some companies like
property developers may rebound amid earnings growth.”  The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, advanced 13.87, or 0.5 percent, to
2,918.92 at the 3 p.m. close, extending a 4.1 percent gain last
month. The  CSI 300 Index  added 0.5 percent to 3,254.89 today,
led by financial companies.  The Shanghai gauge has advanced 3.9 percent this year on
speculation the world’s second-biggest economy is withstanding
tightening measures. The central bank has boosted banks’ reserve
requirement ratio eight times since the start of 2010, while
raising  interest rates  three times to rein in inflation that
reached 4.9 percent in January, near the 28-month high of 5.1
percent in November.  Manufacturing Growth  The PMI fell for a third month, the China Federation of
Logistics and Purchasing said on its website today. That
compared with 52.1 in a Bloomberg News survey.  “This is a good number, suggesting Beijing’s policy
tightening is starting to cool excessive growth and inflation,”
said  Qu Hongbin , Hong Kong-based economist at HSBC Holdings Plc.
The government “still needs to step up measures to combat
inflation in the months ahead,” he said.  A separate manufacturing index released by HSBC and  Markit
Economics  fell to 51.7 in February from 54.5 in January, the
slowest pace of expansion in seven months.  Anhui Conch extended gains to a fourth day, rising 2.6
percent to 35.51 yuan, the highest since February 2008. Gansu
Qilianshan Cement Group Co. advanced 4.1 percent to 19.26 yuan.
Tangshan Jidong Cement Co. added 3.1 percent to 26.60 yuan.  Citigroup Inc. increased its 2011 profit estimates for
Anhui Conch by 45 percent to 9 billion yuan ($1.37 billion),
saying cement prices in China may rise more than 10 percent this
year as new projects spur demand growth to surpass supply.
Cement stocks rallied yesterday after Premier  Wen Jiabao  said
over the weekend the government plans to build 36 million
affordable homes in the next five years.  Home Prices  Wen also pledged Feb. 27 to contain gains in consumer
prices and tackle surging property prices that could threaten
social stability in the world’s most populous nation. The
government aims to slow the pace of growth over the next five
years to curb overcapacity and reduce energy consumption.  China’s home prices rose 0.5 percent in February, the
slowest monthly gain since August, after the government expanded
efforts to curb risks of asset bubbles, said SouFun Holdings Ltd.  A gauge of developers, banks and brokerages gained 1
percent in the CSI 300, the most among the 10 industry groups.  Poly Real Estate climbed 3.5 percent to 12.80 yuan, the
biggest gain since Jan. 11. Net income for 2010 surged 40
percent from a year earlier as rising investments and housing
prices boosted sales, the developer said in a statement.  China Vanke Co., the biggest developer, added 1.7 percent
to 8.30 yuan. Gemdale Corp. advanced 2.2 percent to 6.61 yuan.
China Merchants Property Development Co. gained 2.8 percent to
16.83 yuan.  HSBC Buying  ICBC, the nation’s biggest listed lender, climbed 0.2
percent to 4.27 yuan.  China Construction Bank Corp ., the second
largest, added 0.6 percent to 4.85 yuan. Agricultural Bank of
China Ltd., the third biggest, rose 0.4 percent to 2.62 yuan.  HSBC Global Asset Management (UK) Ltd. has been buying
shares of the largest Chinese banks listed in  Hong Kong .  “The market’s been worrying about these things for quite a
few quarters now,” Nick Timberlake, global head of emerging-
market equities at HSBC Global, said in an interview in Hong
Kong today. “You have four or five of the largest banks that
are generating returns of mid-high teens and are trading at
valuations of less than 1.5 times book value. For us, that’s an
attractive risk-reward so we’ve been adding to that sector in
the last month or two.”  Inflation Outlook  Inflation in China is likely to slow in February, the
official Xinhua News Agency said yesterday, citing Zhang Ping,
the head of the National Development & Reform Commission.  Consumer price gains may have cooled to 4.8 percent in
February from 4.9 percent in January, China International
Capital Corp. and Shenyin & Wanguo Securities Co. said in
separate notes on Feb. 25. The February economic data including
figures for inflation are scheduled to be released March 11.  The government set an economic growth target of 7 percent
for the so-called 12th five-year plan period, which covers 2011
through 2015, Wen said. China’s target was 7.5 percent for the
period from 2006 through last year, with actual growth exceeding
that each year.  --Irene Shen, Zhang Shidong. Editors: Allen Wan, Richard Frost  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
