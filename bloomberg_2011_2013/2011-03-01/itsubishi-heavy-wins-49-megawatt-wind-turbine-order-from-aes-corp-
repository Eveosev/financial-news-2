  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd . won
an order from Mountain View Power Partners IV LLC., a unit of  AES Corp ., to supply 49 wind turbines.  AES will use the turbines, which have a total output of
49,000 kilowatts, for a wind power project in Palm Springs,
California, according to a  statement  from Mitsubishi Heavy on
its website. The turbines are scheduled to be delivered at the
end of 2011.  This is Mitsubishi Heavy’s first order for more than 40
turbines in about two years, after demand fell during the global
recession, Hideo Ikuno, a spokesman for the company, said by
phone in Tokyo today. Ikuno declined to confirm a Nikkei report
today that the order is worth about 4.9 billion yen ($60
million).  A dispute with General Electric Co. that is being heard in
a U.S. court over patent violations concerning Mitsubishi’s 2.4-
megawatt  wind turbines  may have also affected demand, he said.  -- With assistance from Go Onomitsu in Tokyo. Editors: Baldave
