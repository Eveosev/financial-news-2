 England prop forward Andrew
Sheridan will likely miss his team’s remaining two Six Nations
matches with a torn calf muscle, the Rugby Football Union said.  Sheridan left the field injured during the 17-9 win over  France  at the weekend. England tops the standings after three
wins and plays Scotland and Ireland in its final two games.  Winger Matt Banahan, who was not in the original group of
20 players at this week’s training camp in Oxford, was called
into the squad, the RFU said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
