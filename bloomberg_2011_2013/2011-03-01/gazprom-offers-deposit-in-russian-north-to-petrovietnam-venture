OAO Gazprom and  Vietnam  Oil & Gas
Group, known as PetroVietnam, may jointly develop a natural-gas
field in  Russia ’s north.  Gazprom offered the Severo-Purovskoye deposit in the Yamal-
Nenets region to its joint venture with PetroVietnam, called
Gazpromviet, said ZAO Gazprom Zarubezhneftegaz, the gas
producer’s international projects unit, in a statement on its
website yesterday. The field holds proved reserves of about 60
billion cubic meters.  In addition to projects in Vietnam, the two companies
