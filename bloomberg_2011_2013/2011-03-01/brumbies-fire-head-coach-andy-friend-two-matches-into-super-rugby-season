The ACT Brumbies fired coach Andy
Friend two games into the Super Rugby season and replaced him
with one of his assistants until the end of the 2011 campaign.  Friend, who was in the final season of a three-year deal,
had his contract terminated today, Chief Executive Officer
Andrew Fagan said. Tony Rea, the Canberra-based team’s defense
and skills coach, will take over as caretaker.  “After considering all the issues and effectiveness of our
current coaching arrangement, I made a decision that in order
for us to be competitive in 2011 we had to make changes to our
coaching structure,” Fagan said in an e-mailed statement.  Friend confronted his players and support staff yesterday
at a meeting amid reports they were unhappy with his coaching
and the team’s direction, the Australian newspaper said.  The Brumbies, who’ve twice won southern hemisphere rugby’s
top provincial competition, missed the finals the past two years
after Friend, 41, replaced Laurie Fisher as coach at the end of
the 2008 season.  The Brumbies opened the 2011 campaign by beating  New
Zealand ’s Chiefs before an upset one-point loss to tournament
newcomers the Melbourne Rebels four days ago. They next host the
Queensland Reds on March 5.  Rea, a former rugby league hooker with North Sydney and the
London Broncos, was head coach and CEO of the English Super
League club before joining the Brumbies in 2010.  The rest of the coaching lineup, including former Australia
internationals Stephen Larkham and Justin Harrison, remains in
place, the Brumbies said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
