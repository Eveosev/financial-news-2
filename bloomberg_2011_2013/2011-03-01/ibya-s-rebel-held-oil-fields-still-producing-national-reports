Opponents of Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi are in control of some state-owned  oil companies  and
continue to pump crude,  The National  reported, citing executives
at the largest of these businesses.  Arabian Gulf Oil Co. is among state companies that may fill
available storage with crude from the middle of March if turmoil
in the North African country disrupts exports, according to the
newspaper based in  Abu Dhabi  in the United Arab Emirates.  Output at Arabian Gulf dropped to 170,000 barrels a day, or
40 percent of its 420,000 barrels a day capacity, according to
the report, citing the head of the company’s reservoir
department, Yussef Ghorreya. Workers at the Benghazi-based
company sided with anti-Qaddafi rebels and soldiers who switched
sides are protecting oil assets in eastern  Libya , The National
reported.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
