Danish manufacturing expanded in
February at the fastest pace in three years as new orders
increased.  The Purchasing Managers’ Index was 66.4 compared with a
revised 62.9 in January, the Copenhagen-based  Danish Purchasing
and Logistics Forum  said today in an e-mailed report. A reading
above 50 signals expansion.  The PMI sub-index for new orders rose to 81.9 from 70.8 in
January, while the gauge measuring production decreased to 67.1
from 67.2, the forum said.  The PMI index is based on a survey of purchasing managers
at companies representing about 10 percent of  Denmark ’s
industrial production. The forum started compiling data in
January 1994.  To contact the reporter on this story:
