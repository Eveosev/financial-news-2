South Africa’s sugar production will
be 1.911 million metric tons for the season ending in March, the
smallest crop since 1995, the South African Sugar Association
said.  The estimate is down from 1.912 million tons, the Mount
Edgecombe, South Africa-based industry group said on its  website 
today. That would be the least since the 1.67 million tons
reaped 16 years ago, according to the association.  South African sugar cane is grown mainly around the
southeastern towns of Southbroom and Port Shepstone. The
country’s biggest producers include  Illovo Sugar Ltd ., Tongaat
Hulett Ltd.,  Crookes Brothers Ltd . and TSB Sugar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
