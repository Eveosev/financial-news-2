Caja Espana-Caja Duero and Banco
Mare Nostrum, two Spanish  savings banks  groups, are in talks
over a possible alliance.  No final agreement has been reached and Caja Espana-Caja
Duero is also speaking to other lenders, a spokesman for the
savings bank group said in a phone interview from Leon,  Spain ,
without giving more details of what type of alliance the talks
might lead to. Neither party in the talks is publicly traded.  Spanish business newspaper Expansion said earlier today
that the two groups had agreed to merge, creating the country’s
fourth-largest savings bank.  The Spanish government is forcing a  restructuring  of the
country’s banking industry by forcing lenders to meet new
minimum capital requirements.  To contact the reporters on this story:
