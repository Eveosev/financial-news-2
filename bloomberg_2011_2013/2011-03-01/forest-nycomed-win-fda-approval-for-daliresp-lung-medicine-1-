  Forest Laboratories Inc . and Nycomed
A/S won U.S. approval for the Daliresp drug to treat chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, also known as smokersâ€™ cough,
after regulators asked for more information on the product last
year.  The drug, the first in a new class of treatments for severe
COPD, will be available in the U.S. in the second quarter of
this year, the companies said today in a statement.  Forest Laboratories failed to win U.S. Food and Drug
Administration approval last year after the agency asked more
questions about the medicine. The New York-based company
licensed the drug for $100 million in 2009 after Nycomed, based
in Zurich, asked the FDA to clear the medicine. Forest
Laboratories is seeking new products before the top-selling
antidepressant Lexapro loses patent protection next year.  COPD, an irreversible condition resulting in difficulty
breathing, affects about 80 million people globally, the
companies said, citing  World Health Organization  estimates.
Daliresp, a once-daily tablet, is marketed in the European Union
and  Canada  as Daxas and is approved to reduce the risk of
attacks associated with severe COPD.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
