Natural gas shipments scheduled for
delivery to U.S. households dropped to the lowest level in more
than three months as warmer weather reduced heating demand.

fourth day, down 4.6 percent to 33.7 million dekatherms (32.8
billion cubic feet), the lowest level since Nov. 22, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg as of 2:32 p.m. in  New York .  About 3.05 million dekatherms were to be delivered to
Illinois homes, down from yesterday’s 3.29, Bloomberg data show.  Gas at the Alliance Pipeline delivery point near Chicago
was little changed at $4.1746 per million British thermal units
on the  Intercontinental Exchange .  Gas at the Chicago City Gate gained 0.9 percent to $4.1401
per million Btu. The price has declined 6.3 percent this year.  Temperatures will be as much as 14 degrees Fahrenheit above
normal in the U.S. East, Midwest and South through March 5,
according to Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda, Maryland.  The high temperature in Chicago may be 44 degrees
Fahrenheit (7 Celsius) today, 3 degrees above normal, according
