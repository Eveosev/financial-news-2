Aldi Group,  Germany ’s biggest
discount food retailer, will sell 17 percent of its Greek store
network to Lidl Stiftung & Co. for 55 million euros ($76
million),  Imerisia  reported.  Lidl agreed to acquire 10 stores owned by Aldi and two of
its leased outlets; the transaction must be approved by  Greece ’s
competition commission, the newspaper reported, without saying
where it got the information.  Aldi will book a loss of more than 30 million euros on the
sale, as it paid more than 88 million euros initially, according
to Imerisia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
