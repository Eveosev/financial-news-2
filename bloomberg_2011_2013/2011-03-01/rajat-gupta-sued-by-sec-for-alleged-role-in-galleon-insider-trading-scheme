The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission said it filed an insider trading complaint against
Rajat K. Gupta for tipping Galleon Group LLC founder Raj
Rajaratnam with inside information about the earnings at Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. and Procter & Gamble Co. as well as an
impending $5 billion investment by  Berkshire Hathaway Inc . in
Goldman.  The SEC’s Division of Enforcement said that Gupta provided
Rajaratnam with confidential information learned during board
calls and in other aspects of his duties on the Goldman and P&G
boards.  Rajaratnam used the information to trade on behalf of some
of Galleon’s hedge funds, or shared the information with others
at his firm who then traded on it, the SEC said in an e-mailed
statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
