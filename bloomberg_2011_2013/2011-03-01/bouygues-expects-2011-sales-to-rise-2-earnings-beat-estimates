(Corrects million to billion in third paragraph of story
published March 1.)    Bouygues SA , the French building,
television and telecommunications company, said sales will rise
by 2 percent in 2011, after posting earnings for 2010 that beat
analyst estimates.  Sales may rise to 31.7 billion euros ($43.8 billion) in
2011 from 31.2 billion euros in 2010, helped by an increase in
revenue at its telecommunications and construction units, Paris-
based Bouygues said in statement today.  Operating profit fell 3.5 percent to 1.79 billion euros in
2010, Bouygues said. That beat an average 1.69 billion-euro
estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  The company is cutting jobs at Colas, its road-building
unit, to restore margins hurt by a construction slump in central  Europe  and price competition in  France  last year.  Operating profit at Colas, Bouygues’s largest unit by
revenue, fell 42 percent to 313 million euros in 2010. Its
profitability “should gradually improve,” Bouygues said.  Bouygues, which owns France’s third-largest mobile-phone
operator, is facing an increase in the value-added  sales tax  in
2011. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization at the telecommunications unit rose 2 percent to
1.37 billion euros in 2010.  Bouygues’s net income fell 19 percent to 1.07 billion euros
in 2010. The company said its 31 percent stake in train- and
turbine-maker Alstom SA added 235 million euros to net income
last year, down 32 percent from a year earlier.  For the fourth quarter, Bouygues’s sales and operating
income were little changed, while net income fell 50 percent to
148 million euros.  The order book of Bouygues Construction rose 18 percent
from a year earlier to a record 14.2 billion euros on Dec. 31,
and the order book at Bouygues Immobilier, the real-estate unit,
rose 5 percent to 2.3 billion euros. The order book at Colas was
worth 6.1 billion euros on Dec. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
