  Brainsway Ltd . increased to the
highest level in almost a week after the company said tests of
its Deep TMS with H coil were safe and improved motor
functionality in Parkinson’s patients.  The shares of the developer of devices to treat
neurological disorders climbed 2.1 percent to 8.814 shekels at
the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv, giving the Jerusalem-based
company a market value of 417 million shekels ($115 million).  Tests were conducted on a “relatively small” number of
patients and additional trials need to be done, the Jerusalem-
based company said in a  statement to the Tel Aviv Stock
Exchange .  To contact the reporter on this story:
