PNC Financial Services Inc.,  JPMorgan Chase & Co . and  SunTrust Banks Inc . led U.S. banks in
taking customers from competitors, according to a J. D. Power
and Associates survey of consumers who switched banks last year.  Customers who changed banks increased to 8.7 percent from
7.7 percent during the past year, the survey of 25 banks showed.
The three lenders each increased new customers by more than 11
percent among 4,791 people surveyed, Rockwell Clancy, vice
president of the financial-services practice at  Westlake
Village , California-based J.D. Power and Associates, said in an
interview.  “There are more people in play, and they’re being more
diligent,” Clancy said. ”They’re looking at more alternatives
when they shop, which means the competitive pressure on the
banks is going up.”  Banks that gained the most customers marketed well, with
ads for specific products, such as gift cards and banking phone
applications, Clancy said. Less than half, or 43 percent, of
customers who bought additional products from banks made the
purchase from their primary lender, he said. Most were lured by
competitors’ promotional offers, Clancy said.  “It has less to do with the absolute product than it has
to do with the perceived innovation,” Clancy said.  Fees and interest rates carried “relatively little
weight” in consumers’ decisions, according to the study
conducted in November and December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
