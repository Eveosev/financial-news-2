Commodity futures trading volume in
China dropped 21 percent in the first two months of this year,
led by contracts on the  Shanghai  Futures Exchange, according to
data provided by the China Futures Association.  Total volume on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange , Zhengzhou
Commodity Exchange and the Shanghai bourse reached 39.68 million
lots in January and February, compared with 50.53 million lots a
year earlier. In Shanghai, where copper and gold futures are
traded, volume fell 52 percent from a year earlier to 34.37
million lots.  About 3.42 million lots of copper contracts were traded in
the first two months of 2011, 56 percent less than a year ago,
while aluminum volume declined 80 percent to 960,206 lots, the
association said in an e-mailed statement.  The association started to provide volume figures, with
trades counted as one lot, from this year. Previously each trade
was counted twice, including the buyer and seller.  --Helen Sun. Editors: Richard Dobson,  Matthew Oakley   To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
