Vision Solutions Inc., the provider
of recovery, systems and data management solutions, is seeking
$385 million of loans to refinance debt and fund a dividend to
owner Thoma Bravo LLC, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Jefferies Group Inc. will arrange a $15 million revolving  credit line  due in 5 years, a $240 million  term loan  maturing in
5.5 years and a $130 million second-lien debt expiring in 6
years, Bloomberg data show. The bank will host a lender meeting
March 3.  Vision Solutions obtained a $15 million revolver and $240
million term loan in July with an interest rate 6 percentage
points more than the London interbank offered rate, according to
Bloomberg data. Libor, the rate banks charge to lend to each
other, will have a 1.75 percent floor. The term loan was issued
at 96 cents on the dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
