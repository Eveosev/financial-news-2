  Saudi Aramco , the world’s largest
oil company, and petrochemical maker  Saudi Basic Industries
Corp . plan to invest about $100 billion in hydrocarbon projects
by the end of 2015, a multilateral investment agency said.  Aramco has confirmed plans to spend $70.1 billion on oil-
related assets, including $19.8 billion to develop new sources
of crude and keep output at current levels, said Ali Aissaoui, 
chief economist at the  Arab Petroleum Investments Corp. , known 
as Apicorp.  Aramco and Saudi Basic Industries, also known as Sabic,
will devote an additional $50.3 billion in oil-related outlays
to expand refining capacity and develop petrochemical projects,
Aissaoui said yesterday in an e-mailed assessment of Saudi
Arabia’s energy outlook. Apicorp is owned by the  Organization of
Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries .  Natural-gas projects will absorb $31.4 billion of total
hydrocarbon investment over the next five years, according to
Aissaoui’s assessment. Sabic and Aramco aim to boost production
capacity for gas and natural gas liquids, to supply the local
market and exports of gas-based petrochemicals and fertilizers,
the study reported.  In addition to spending on hydrocarbons,  Saudi Arabia  will
need $20.9 billion through 2015 for power generation, according
to Apicorp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
