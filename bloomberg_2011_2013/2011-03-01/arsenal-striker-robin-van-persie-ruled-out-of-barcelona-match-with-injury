Arsenal striker  Robin van Persie 
will miss next week’s Champions League match at Barcelona after
injuring his knee in the 2-1 League Cup final loss to Birmingham
two days ago.  The Dutchman joins Theo Walcott on the sidelines for the
second leg of the round-of-16 matchup at the Camp Nou on March
8. Van Persie scored the Gunners’ first goal as they rallied for
a 2-1 win in the opening match Feb. 16.  “Unfortunately, we had bad news on the scan and he will be
out for the next three weeks for sure,” Arsenal manager  Arsene Wenger  told the club’s in-house TV channel. “It could be
longer. The shortest delay we can imagine is three weeks, he is
definitely out for Barcelona.”  Wenger said it was “possible” that captain Cesc Fabregas
would be fit to face his former club. The midfielder limped out
of last week’s win over Stoke early in the first half with a
hamstring problem.  “He is making quick and good progress,” Wenger said. “It
is possible.”    Van Persie  was hurt scoring the tying goal in the first
half against Birmingham. Obafemi Martins then scored in the 89th
minute to extend Arsenal’s six-year wait for a trophy.  Midfielder  Alex Song  and defender  Laurent Koscielny , whose
mistake contributed to the winning goal, also picked up injuries
in the match and will miss tomorrow’s F.A. Cup replay with
Leyton Orient. Both should be recovered for the trip to Spain,
Wenger said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
