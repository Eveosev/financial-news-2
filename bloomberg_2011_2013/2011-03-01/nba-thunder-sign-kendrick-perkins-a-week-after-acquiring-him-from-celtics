The  Oklahoma City  Thunder signed
Kendrick Perkins to a multiyear contract extension, less than a
week after acquiring him from the  Boston Celtics .  Perkins, 26, was traded to the Thunder on Feb. 24 and has
agreed to remain with the team, general manager Sam Presti said
in a statement. Terms weren’t disclosed.  The 6-foot-10, 280-pound center is averaging 7 points and 8
rebounds per game this season, equaling his career high. Perkins
won an NBA title with the Celtics in 2008 and was unable to play
in Game 7 of the finals last year due to injury. Perkins sat out
the Thunder’s last two games and may miss up to three weeks with
a sprained medial collateral ligament in his left knee.  Oklahoma City is 36-22, in first place in the Western
Conference Northwest division.  To contact the reporter on this story:
