Shawn Lee, a starting defensive
tackle for the  San Diego  Chargers’ 1994 Super Bowl team, died
three days ago from an unknown cause,  the team said . He was 44.  Lee becomes the sixth member of the 1994 Chargers to pass
away since they lost to the  San Francisco 49ers  in the National
Football League’s title game.  Lee died Feb. 26 in Raleigh,  North Carolina . He spent six
seasons with the Chargers and totaled 6 1/2 sacks during their
run to the Super Bowl. Lee and Reuben Davis were together known
as San Diego’s “ Two Tons of Fun .”  “He was a person who was quiet, easygoing, always smiling
and he loved to help kids and give back to the community,”
Davis said on the Chargers’ website. “Shawn was never selfish
and he would never say no to anybody, even if it meant him
having to give up something.”  The 1994 Chargers previously lost two defensive starters
from their Super Bowl team. Linebacker David Griggs was killed
in a car accident five months after the  Super Bowl  loss and
defensive end Chris Mims died of heart failure at age 38 on Oct.
15, 2008.  Backup running back Rodney Culver was 26 when he died in a
May 11, 1996, plane crash in the Florida Everglades. Reserve
linebacker Doug Miller was 28 when he was fatally struck by
lightning while camping on the Colorado River on July 21, 1998.
Chargers backup center Curtis Whitley succumbed to a drug
overdose at 39 on May 11, 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
