  Petroleo Brasileiro SA , Brazil’s
state-controlled oil producer, said it found an estimated 1.885
billion barrels of recoverable oil in Brazil’s Campos Basin in
2009 and 2010.  The discoveries include 1.105 billion barrels above a salt
layer in the offshore region and an additional 780 million
barrels beneath the salt layer, Petrobras said today in a
presentation on its website. The discoveries are estimates that
aren’t yet included in the company’s proven reserve figures.  The discoveries at Campos will help Petrobras compensate
for declining production at mature fields and increase overall
output, Chief Financial Officer  Almir Barbassa  said today on a
conference call with analysts. Output at Petrobras’s existing
fields declines by 10 percent on average each year, or 210,000
barrels a day, according to Barbassa.  The company plans to boost crude production in  Brazil  5
percent this year to an average of 2.1 million barrels a day.
The majority of new production in 2011 will come from fields in
the Campos Basin, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
