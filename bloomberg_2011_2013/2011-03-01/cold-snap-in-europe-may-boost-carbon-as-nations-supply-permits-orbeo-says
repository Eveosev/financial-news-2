A cold snap in Europe may boost
demand for carbon dioxide permits as power and natural gas
prices rise, said Orbeo, the emissions-trading venture of  Rhodia
SA  and  Societe Generale  SA.  Carbon permits for December may rise as high as 15.70 euros
($21.73) a metric ton this week, said analysts for the venture
including Emmanuel Fages and Carine Hemery in Paris. Permits may
fall as low as 15.20 euros, they said yesterday in an e-mailed
research note. Allowances were little changed today at 15.47
euros on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London.  Nations usually issue permits every year in February, a
pattern that may drive permits lower, the analysts said.
“Additional EU-allowance distribution could classically lead to
the sale of some limited excess volumes, as has been witnessed
in the past.”  That would apply to the 10 nations with open carbon
registries, including  Germany , the U.K. and France, they said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
