Essar African Holdings Ltd., an
Indian company, signed a revised accord with Zimbabwe’s
government under which it will buy 60 percent of  Zimbabwe  Iron
and Steel Co.,  Newsday  reported, without saying where it got the
information.  The remaining 40 percent of the steelmaker will stay in
government hands, the Harare-based Newsday said on its website.  Essar will also acquire 80 percent of a second company that
will group Zisco’s mining operations, leaving the government
with 20 percent, Newsday reported. The new agreement brings an
end to negotiations that started on Nov. 5, when Essar won the
bidding for Zisco, Newsday said.  Zisco hasn’t operated since 2004, when it closed due to
mounting debts and aging equipment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
