Teodorin Obiang, son of the
president of  Equatorial Guinea , ordered a luxury yacht costing
$380 million from a German company, the  Daily Telegraph 
reported, citing  Global Witness , a corruption watchdog.  Obiang, who as agriculture minister earns $6,799 a month,
ordered the vessel from Kusch Yachts, stipulating it should have
a cinema, restaurant, bar and swimming pool, at a cost of $380
million, the newspaper said.  Global Witness said the U.S. should institute sanctions
against Obiang, who has a $35 million mansion in Malibu,  California , a $33 million private jet and a fleet of luxury
cars; the government press office in Equatorial Guinea said
Obiang had ordered the yacht with his own money but then changed
his mind, the Telegraph reported.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:  Chris Peterson  at
