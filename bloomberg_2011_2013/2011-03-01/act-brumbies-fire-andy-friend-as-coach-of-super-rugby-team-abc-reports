The ACT Brumbies fired coach Andy
Friend two matches into the Super Rugby season, the Australian
Broadcasting Corp. reported.  Brumbies Chief Executive Officer Andrew Fagan asked Friend
for his resignation yesterday, though he refused and was
subsequently fired, the ABC reported, without saying where it
got the information.  Friend replaced Laurie Fisher as coach of the Canberra-
based team at the end of the 2008 season. The Brumbies, two-time
winners of southern hemisphere rugby’s top provincial
competition, missed the finals the past two years.  The Brumbies opened the 2011 season by beating  New
Zealand ’s Chiefs before suffering an upset one-point loss to
tournament newcomers the Melbourne Rebels four days ago.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
