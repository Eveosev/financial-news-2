The  New York  Jets will release
offensive tackle Damien Woody, nose tackle Kris Jenkins,
linebacker Vernon Gholston and defensive end Jason Taylor, the
 New York Daily News reports .  The Jets will save $10 million by making the moves before
March 4, when the  National Football League ’s new league year
begins, the paper said, without citing the source of its
information. The Jets may re-sign some of the players at reduced
salaries, the Daily News said.  Jets spokesman  Bruce Speight  said the team wouldn’t comment
on the report. Woody, who suffered knee and Achilles tendon
injuries last season, confirmed on his Twitter account last
night that he was released.  Woody, 33, played with the Jets the past three seasons
after spending his first nine NFL seasons with the New England
Patriots and Detroit Lions. Jenkins, 31, has been limited to
seven games for the Jets over the past two seasons after twice
tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee.  Gholston, 24, had no sacks in three seasons with the Jets
since being picked in the first round of the 2008  NFL draft .
Taylor, 36, is a six-time Pro Bowl selection who had five sacks
last season, his first with the Jets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
