Financial Times  owner  Pearson Plc 
said it froze a stake owned by the Libyan Investment Authority,
blocking trading in the shares and dividend payments.  The Libyan Investment Authority owns 3.27 percent, or 26.6
million shares, in London-based Pearson. The company won’t
“register any transfer or pay any dividend in respect of the
shares until further notice,” it said in a statement today.  Pearson Chief Executive Officer Marjorie Scardino yesterday
said the company was in a “terrible position” regarding the
stake, adding that Pearson doesn’t choose its shareholders.
Pearson learned of the stake bought by the Libyan Investment
Authority in June 2010. The U.K. government Feb. 27 froze assets
of Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  and five members of his family.  Scardino, speaking at a press briefing to discuss Pearson’s
2010 earnings yesterday, said she’s never met with anyone from
the Libyan Investment Authority and that the company once spoke
to a “middleman.”  “It’s abhorrent to us what is happening in  Libya  and we
have made it clear we are uncomfortable with the holding,”
Scardino said.  Pearson has recommended a 9 percent dividend increase to
38.7 pence a share on 2010 earnings. The payment is subject to
approval at an annual general meeting of shareholders April 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
