  PNC Financial Services Group Inc .
expects to sign consent orders with U.S. regulators because of
allegedly faulty mortgage servicing and foreclosures.  The orders are likely to come from the  Federal Reserve  and
the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Pittsburgh-based
PNC said today in its annual filing with securities regulators.
The actions may include activities tied to the Mortgage
Electronic Registration System, the registry designed to track
mortgage-servicing rights and ownership of U.S. residential
loans, according to the filing.  The federal probe may result in formal enforcement actions
and civil fines, the filing said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
