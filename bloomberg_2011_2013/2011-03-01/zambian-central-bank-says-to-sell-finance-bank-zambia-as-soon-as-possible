Zambia’s central bank plans to sell
Finance Bank Zambia Ltd., the lender seized by the Bank of
Zambia in December and managed by  FirstRand Ltd ., as soon as
possible.  The central bank is seeking local and international buyers
and will invite possible investors to a conference on March 9,
Kanguya Mayondi, spokesman for the Lusaka-based Bank of Zambia,
said in an e-mailed statement today.  “The restructuring will entail a purchase and assumption
transaction under which depositors’ interests shall be fully
protected,” Mayondi said. “The bank is solvent but has a
shortfall in regulatory capital prescribed by the bank. It has
to be restructured.”  The southern African nation’s central bank seized Finance
Bank, the country’s biggest privately owned lender, on Dec. 10
for breaching financial laws and appointed FirstRand Ltd. to
manage it for 90 days. It has almost 1,000 employees and 39
branches.  John Sangwa, a lawyer acting on behalf of some of the
bank’s shareholders, said he plans to challenge the sale in
court.  “You can’t resolve this matter through a public
hearing,’” Sangwa said by phone from Lusaka. “It’s wrong and
the law is being flouted here.”  Finance Bank’s former chairman, Rajan Mathani, is facing
charges, including illegally transferring company shares and
falsifying documents, according the country’s Drug Enforcement
Commission, which also investigates  money laundering .  To contact the reporter on this story:
