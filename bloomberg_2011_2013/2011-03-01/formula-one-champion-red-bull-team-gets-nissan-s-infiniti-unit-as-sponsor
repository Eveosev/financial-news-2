Nissan Motor Co.’s Infiniti car unit
agreed to sponsor Formula One champion team Red Bull for two
years and share technical information.  Financial terms of the agreement weren’t disclosed in a
joint statement. The British Broadcasting Corp. on Feb. 27
reported the deal was worth at least 7 million pounds ($11.4
million) to Red Bull’s team.  “It’s still very much the Red Bull Racing team,” the  Milton Keynes , England-based team’s manager Christian Horner
said in an interview in London yesterday, adding that the car’s
dark blue-and-red color scheme won’t change. Infiniti’s logo
will be incorporated in four places on the chassis, Horner said.  Energy-drink maker Red Bull GmbH spent $675 million on
bankrolling its team since 2005, according to company filings in
the U.K. by Red Bull Technology Ltd. The team, whose driver
Sebastian Vettel won the championship last year, will continue
to use Renault SA engines in 2011 and 2012, the statement said.  “Historically, Infiniti has been mainly based in the  United States  and now we go very much worldwide,” Nissan Senior
Vice President Andy Palmer said in an interview in  London 
yesterday. “We need a marketing platform to grow the awareness
of the brand worldwide and what better platform than Formula
One?”  To contact the reporters on this story:
