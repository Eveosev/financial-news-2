Vienna.  The following were among the most active stocks in the

percent to 16.05 euros. The maker of circuit boards for mobile
phones said it secured a site in China to expand its capacity.  CA Immobilien Anlagen AG (CAI AV) rose 1 percent to 12.59

to 42.57 euros. Banking stocks were the worst performers in
Europe today.    Intercell AG  (ICLL AV) climbed 0.5 percent to 8.72 euros,
paring the previous day’s decline, even as the Austrian vaccine
maker said it lost 255 million euros in 2010 compared with 18.4
million euros the year before. The company also predicted that
it will lose 40 million euros in 2011.  Jefferies Group Inc. reiterated a “buy” rating on the
stock, saying in a note that “we still believe the share price
significantly undervalues the pipeline and platform
technologies, hence our buy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
