Chevron Phillips Chemical Co. LLC
had a  power failure  at its Cedar Bayou chemical plant in
Baytown, Texas, according to a  filing  with the U.S. National
Response Center.  The company was “attempting to shut down and block in all
feeds from the pipeline as safely as possible” after the
incident at 7:12 p.m. local time yesterday, the report said.  Linda Koenig, a spokeswoman for The Woodlands, Texas-based
company, declined to comment.  U.S. refineries must notify the  National Response Center  if
they release hazardous substances in excess of reportable
quantities, according to the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as
Superfund.  Chemical plant outages can increase prices for products as
companies turn to spot markets to help them meet supply
contracts.  The Cedar Bayou plant is located about 32 miles (51
kilometers) east of Houston. The company is a joint venture of  Chevron Corp . and  ConocoPhillips .  To contact the reporter on this story:
