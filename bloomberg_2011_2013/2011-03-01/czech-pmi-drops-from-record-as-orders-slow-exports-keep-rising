Czech manufacturing expansion slowed
from a record pace in February on the weaker inflow of new
orders, an industry gauge showed.  The HSBC Czech Republic Manufacturing PMI dropped to 59.8,
from 60.5 in the previous month, the bank said today in an e-
mailed report. A reading greater than 50 signals overall growth.  “New order growth moderated from January’s record pace,”
the bank said in the Purchasing Managers Index report, compiled
by Markit, a financial information services company. “That
said, the rate of expansion remained marked and well above the
long-run trend for the survey,” it said, adding that new export
orders rose at the fastest pace since June.  The Czech economy, where exports including cars made by
Skoda Auto AS account for about 70 percent of output, last year
rebounded from the worst recession since the end of communism in
1989. The  Finance Ministry  revised on Jan. 31 its forecast for
2011 economic growth to 2.2 percent, from 2 percent.  The economy expanded a preliminary 2.9 percent in the three
months through December from the year-earlier period, the
fastest growth in 10 quarters. The recovery was initially led by
renewed demand for exports and later accompanied by restocking
of inventories.  The HSBC Czech Republic Manufacturing PMI is based on data
compiled from monthly replies to questionnaires sent to
purchasing executives in over 250 manufacturing companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
