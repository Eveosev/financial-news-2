Peter Attard Montalto, a London-
based economist at Nomura International Plc, comments on
Hungary’s fiscal measures unveiled today aimed at cutting public
debt to 50 percent of gross domestic product by 2018.  Montalto made the comments in an e-mailed note.  “Today’s announcement was an uncertain step in vaguely the
right direction, but insufficient to fit its purpose, in our
view.  “The spending cuts and revenue changes are however good
measures. Whatever the government’s spin, they are austerity.
The issue is they target the wrong size budget hole -- we still
see a 480 billion forint hole in 2013 after today’s
announcements.  “Rating downgrade risks remain very real in our view,
though we still think the package has bought some time.  “Overall we think this is probably very slightly currency
and fixed-income market negative given lack of details and
equity market negative given removal of corporate tax cuts and
the addition of a bank tax in 2012.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
