  China  Banking Regulatory Commission
Chairman  Liu Mingkang  said the yuan has entered a period in
which it will only appreciate, the Financial News reported.  The country’s interest rates will increase in this period
while liquidity at banks will be volatile, the Beijing-based
newspaper, published by China’s central bank, cited Liu as
saying during a recent meeting in Beijing.  People’s Bank of China Governor Zhou Xiaochuan said last
month that policy makers may use means “including rates and
currency” to curb increases in food and home prices. The
central bank has raised benchmark lending and deposit rates in
the first two months of this year and increased the reserve
requirement for banks to curb inflation.  Liu’s statement “probably refers to the medium-term trend
for the yuan,”  Mitul Kotecha , Hong Kong-based head of global
foreign-exchange strategy at Credit Agricole SA, said in an
interview. The reference to one-way gains “isn’t usually stated
given that it encourages hot money inflows," he said.  The Chinese authorities will continue to leave plenty of
room for short-term fluctuations in the currency against the
backdrop of longer-term appreciation, Kotecha said.  The yuan rose 0.03 percent to 6.5697 per dollar as of 11:25
a.m. in  Shanghai , according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade
System. The currency has gained 3.5 percent since a two-year peg
was relaxed in June, and touched a 17-year high of 6.5654 on
Feb. 21.  A stronger yuan allows China to more cheaply import
commodities such as oil, copper and soybeans, which are priced
globally in dollars.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:  John Liu  at   jliu42@bloomberg.net
