  Petronet LNG Ltd .’s Dahej terminal
on India’s west coast may receive a cargo of 61,000 metric tons
of liquefied natural gas, according to EXIM  India , a data and
shipping newsletter.  The Seri Anggun may arrive at the western Indian port with
the fuel from  Egypt  today, according to ship transmissions
captured by AIS Live on Bloomberg.  MISC Bhd., the world’s biggest owner-operator of liquefied
natural gas tankers, owns the Seri Anggun, according to
Bloomberg data.  The vessel was last seen off the coast of Gujarat, near
Dahej, according to the ship transmissions. Petronet is India’s
biggest importer of LNG, while also leasing out its terminal to
other companies.  Dahej has an annual capacity of 10 million tons, which may
be increased to 15 million tons by 2012, the company said in
September 2009. Petronet imports about 7.5 million tons a year
of LNG from Qatar in term contracts, according to its  website .  Aseem, owned by Petronet LNG, is scheduled to reach Dahej
with 62,000 tons of LNG from Ras Laffan in Qatar today,
according to vessel transmissions and EXIM.  LNG is natural gas that’s chilled to a liquid, reducing it
to one-six-hundredth of its original volume at minus 161 degrees
Celsius (minus 258 degrees Fahrenheit), for transportation by
ship to destinations not connected by pipeline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
