  GlaxoSmithKline Plc ’s Ziagen,
Trizivir and Epzicom treatments for HIV infection weren’t found
to increase the risk of heart attacks in a review by U.S.
regulators, challenging reports from previous studies.  Doctors should be “aware there are conflicting data” and
keep prescribing the treatment, the Food and drug Administration
said in a notice on its website. The FDA  analyzed  26 studies of
medicines containing the chemical abacavir, sold by London-based
Glaxo and other generic drug-makers.  Several observational studies and one randomized-controlled
trial identified an increased risk of heart attack in patients
taking abacavir, the FDA said. The risk hasn’t been shown in
other studies or the safety database maintained by Glaxo, the
agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
