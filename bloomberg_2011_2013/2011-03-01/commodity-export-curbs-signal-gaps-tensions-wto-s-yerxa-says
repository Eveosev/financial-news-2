Raw material export curbs is an area
of “growing tensions,” according to Rufus Yerxa, deputy
general director of the  World Trade Organization . Yerxa made
the comments at a conference in Brussels today.  “What is clear is that there’s a gap between the countries
imposing these measures and the importing countries, a gap in
expectations and in appreciation of what the rules should be.  “This should be a major area of focus for the big players
in the WTO, such as the G-20 countries, to seek greater
cooperation and mutual understanding. There’s in fact an effort
within G-20 to do just that. I’d emphasize the need for G-20 to
enhance dialogue in these policy measures.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
