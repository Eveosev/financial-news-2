Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in Indonesian trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of the 4 p.m. Jakarta-time close.  The  Jakarta Composite index  gained 42.27 points, or 1.2
percent, to 3,512.62, the most since Feb. 18.  Banks: PT Bank Central Asia (BBCA IJ), Indonesia’s largest
bank by market value, rose 2.4 percent to 6,450 rupiah and PT
Bank Rakyat  Indonesia  (BBRI IJ), the second-largest by assets,
jumped 4.3 percent to 4,900 rupiah, the steepest increase since
Jan. 25. Financial shares rose, providing the third biggest
boost to the composite index, as evidence of slowing inflation
reduces pressure on the central bank to increase borrowing costs.  Indonesia’s consumer prices rose 6.84 percent last month
from a year earlier, after gaining 7.02 percent in January, the
central statistics office said. That’s less than the 7.13
percent median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of 15
economists.  PT Aneka Tambang (ANTM IJ), the second-biggest nickel
producer, rose 3.4 percent to 2,275 rupiah, the steepest
increase since Feb. 1. Aneka Tambang said unaudited 2010 profit
surged 175 percent to 1.66 trillion rupiah ($189 million) on
higher sales and nickel prices and lower sales costs.  PT Jasa Marga (JSMR IJ), a toll-road operator, climbed 1.6
percent to 3,225 rupiah. Jasa Marga plans to acquire a 70
percent stake in a project to build an 11-kilometer toll road in
Bali valued at 1.8 trillion rupiah,  Bisnis Indonesia  reported,
citing Frans Sunito, president director at the company. Sunito
couldn’t be reached when called at his office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
