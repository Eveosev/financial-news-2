  HMV Group Plc , the U.K.’s biggest
retailer of CDs and DVDs, said full-year pretax profit before
one-time items is likely to be ‘moderately below” analysts’
estimates, and it may not meet some banking covenant tests.  HMV dropped as much as 24 percent in London trading. The
Maidenhead, England-based company has started talks with lenders
about changes to its facility agreement, it said in a Regulatory
News Service statement today.  “We think a deal will be reached, though the cost to HMV
is likely to be onerous and the shares will remain under
pressure until we get clarity on the terms,” wrote Sanjay Vidyarthi, an analyst with Execution Noble who has a “sell”
recommendation on HMV.  HMV halved its dividend and is closing 60 stores as
consumers buy more music and films online. In January it said
some suppliers had their credit insurance levels reduced. To
cope, it’s trying to branch out into live music and concert
promotion, and boost its digital and Internet revenue.  HMV fell 3.25 pence to 17.5 pence at 8:57 a.m. in London,
after earlier declining to as low as 15.75 pence. The shares
have dropped 45 percent so far this year, giving it a market
value of 74.1 million pounds ($121 million).  Net Debt       Net debt is expected to be at least 130 million pounds, HMV
said today. The median analyst estimate for pretax profit
excluding one-time items is 45 million pounds, the company said.  Vidyarthi said he had been predicting that HMV’s debt would
be about 45 million pounds, so the revised number “needs
further explanation.” Debt excluding deferred financing fees
was 151.6 million pounds in October.    Nick Bubb , an analyst with Arden Partners, said today’s
announcement “firmly removes any lingering hope of a final
dividend.” Bubb, who said he expected 70 million pounds in
debt, has a “neutral” recommendation on the stock.  “Trading conditions remain tough, reflecting a difficult
consumer environment as well the changing markets in which we
operate,” HMV Chief Executive Officer Simon Fox said in the
statement. “However, our business is adapting quickly to
respond to these external factors, and we are confident that our
plans will ensure its long-term and sustainable future.”  U.K. entertainment retailers have struggled to contend with
competition from supermarkets such as Tesco Plc and online
retailers including Amazon.com Inc. The 99-year-old Woolworths
Group Plc and music chain Zavvi Group both went into
administration in December 2008.  The Mail on Sunday said Feb. 27 HMV will hold talks this
week over a potential sale of its Waterstone’s bookstore chain
to Russian investor Alexander Mamut. Mamut, who owns 6.1 percent
of HMV’s shares, is allied with chain founder Tim Waterstone,
the newspaper said.  Spokespeople for HMV weren’t immediately available for
comment today.  Borders Group Inc., the second-biggest U.S. bookstore
chain, filed for bankruptcy Feb. 16, and then got approval to
liquidate 200 outlets. Barnes & Noble Inc., the biggest U.S.
chain, suspended its dividend last month to save cash.  To contact the reporter on this story:
