Ukraine can export almost 1 million
metric tons of barley between Feb. 1 and June 30 if the
government scraps quotas on outbound shipments after the end of
March, UkrAgroConsult said.  Those deliveries will be pushed into the marketing season
beginning July 1 if the limits stay in place, the Kiev-based
researcher said in an e-mailed statement late yesterday.
“Ukraine has a high export potential” for barley, though
outbound shipments “directly depend on government decision when
to abolish the quotas,” it said.  Exports of barley from Ukraine reached 2.38 million tons
between July 1 and Jan. 31, according to UkrAgroConsult. The
country has scope to ship 3.3 million tons of the grain in total
for the marketing year ending June 30 without the quotas, the
researcher said.  Barley stockpiles as of Feb. 1 were 1.8 million tons, the
national statistics office said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
