Ineos Group Holdings Plc reported an
upset with a demethanizer tower in the olefins unit 1 at its
Chocolate Bayou chemical site in Alvin,  Texas , according to a
filing with state regulators.  Emissions associated with the flaring began today at 5 a.m.
local time and lasted for seven hours, the Lyndhurst, U.K.-based
company said in the report to the Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality.  Ineos was “stabilizing the unit to bring ethylene product
back on spec and decreased feed to the furnaces,” according to
the  filing .  “Operations are normal at Chocolate Bayou,” Charles
Saunders, a company spokesman based in League City, Texas, said
in an e-mail.  The Chocolate Bayou plant includes two olefins units and
has one of the largest hydrocarbon crackers in the U.S.,
according to the company  website . The plant is about 45 miles
(72 kilometers) south of Houston.  To contact the reporter on this story:
