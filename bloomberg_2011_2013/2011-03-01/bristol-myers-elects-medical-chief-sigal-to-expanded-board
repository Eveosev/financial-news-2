  Bristol-Myers Squibb Co ., the maker
of the Plavix blood-thinner, expanded its board by adding Chief
Medical Officer Elliott Sigal as a director.  Sigal, 59, takes the position effective today and will
become a member of the board’s science and technology committee,
New York-based Bristol-Myers said. The addition brings the
number of board members to 12, the average of Bristol-Myers’s
U.S. pharmaceutical company peers, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Since Sigal became medical chief in 2004, Bristol-Myers has
brought eight new drugs to market, with as many as five more
approvals expected by 2012, according to the company. As medical
chief, Sigal reports to Lamberto Andreotti, who replaced James Cornelius as chief executive officer a year ago. Cornelius
remains as Bristol-Myers’s chairman.  “We are very excited to have Elliott join our board,”
Cornelius said in a statement. “Under his leadership, our R&D
organization has become one of the most-productive in the
industry.”  To contact the reporter on this story:  Tom Randall  in  New York  at
