  Lloyds Banking Group Plc , Britain’s
biggest mortgage lender, said it will halt U.K. branch closures
as Antonio Horta-Osorio takes over as chief executive officer.  He is starting a review of the lender’s operations and
plans to announce its conclusions at the end of the first half,
London-based Lloyds said in a statement today. The bank, which
is 41 percent government-owned, will speed up plans to sell 600
branches to comply with European Union state aid rules. Lloyds
has until the end of 2013 to sell the branches.  “Today’s announcements mark the start of the next phase of
Lloyds Banking Group’s development,” said Horta-Osorio, who
became CEO today. “As the integration of our business comes to
a close in the coming months, we have a unique opportunity to
redefine our future and demonstrate how we will drive long-term
value for our customers, shareholders and employees.”  Horta-Osorio, 47, joins a bank that’s been shrinking
following its taxpayer-funded rescue. Lloyds has sold assets,
among them its Bank of Scotland Integrated Finance investment
unit, and cut more than 22,000 jobs since its rescue. The bank
plans to shrink its balance sheet by 200 billion pounds ($326
billion) by 2014.  The Portuguese national and former head of Banco Santander
SA’s British operations replaced  Eric Daniels , 59.  To contact the reporter on this story:
