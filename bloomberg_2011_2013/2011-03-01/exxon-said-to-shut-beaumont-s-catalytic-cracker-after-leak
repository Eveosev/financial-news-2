  Exxon Mobil Corp .’s Beaumont,  Texas ,
refinery shut a fluid catalytic cracker yesterday after a leak,
two people familiar with the plant’s operations said.  The unit, the plant’s only catalytic cracker, remains shut
today and may be down for a while, said the people, who declined
to be identified because they aren’t authorized to speak for the
refinery. Exxon is trying to identify the source of the leak,
one of the people said.  Kevin Allexon, a Fairfax, Virginia-based Exxon spokesman,
declined to comment, saying that “we do not comment on day-to-
day operations.”  The refinery is capable of processing 359,100 barrels a
day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Exxon is the largest U.S. refiner. Its  three Gulf Coast
plants  account for 17 percent of that  region’s operable  crude
oil capacity, according to the Energy Department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
