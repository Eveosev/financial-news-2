  Enea SA , Poland’s third-largest
power utility, said fourth-quarter profit rose from last year,
missing a consensus estimate by 39 percent on the performance of
its distribution and trading businesses.  Net income rose to 73.4 million zloty ($25.7 million) from
67.2 million zloty a year earlier, Poznan, western Poland-based
Enea said in a regulatory statement today. The mean estimate in
a survey of six analysts by the PAP newswire called for profit
of 120.5 million zloty.  The Polish government, which owns a majority stake in the
utility, is in talks with Electricite de France SA, the European
Union’s biggest power producer, to sell the shares. Enea is
valued at 9.67 billion zloty at yesterday’s closing price.  “We didn’t expect such a low result in the distribution
segment,”  Pawel Puchalski , an analyst at Bank Zachodni WBK SA,
told Bloomberg News by phone. Franciszek Wojtal, an analyst at
Bank Millennium SA, said the trading business was responsible
for the worse-than-expected earnings.  The distribution business reported a loss of 6.93 million
zloty in the quarter, compared with a 26.3 million-zloty loss
last year and 263 million-zloty profit for the full year. Enea’s
trading business generated profit of 5.57 million zloty, down
from 83.9 million zloty in the same period of 2009.  Revenue increased 4.2 percent to 2.01 billion zloty, while
earnings before interest and taxes climbed to 83.6 million zloty
from 66.2 million zloty, compared with the 125 million-zloty
estimate in the  PAP survey .  To contact the reporter on this story:
