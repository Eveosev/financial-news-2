Aluminum Corp. of  China  Ltd., the
country’s biggest producer of the metal, posted a second-half
profit that missed analyst estimates as higher prices and sales
were undercut by rising costs.  Profit for the six-months ended Dec. 31 was 247.4 million
yuan ($37.6 million), according to Bloomberg calculations. A
Bloomberg survey of 13 analysts estimated the half-year profit
to be 429.7 million yuan. The Beijing-based company, known as
Chalco, had a loss of 1.1 billion yuan in the same period of
2009.  The rising cost of coal and the removal of preferential
electricity rates eroded the profit of aluminum producers
including Chalco. While the metal’s price rose 11 percent last
year, coal prices at Qinhuangdao, a Chinese benchmark, gained as
much as 34 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Chalco buys coal to generate power at some plants. Electricity
accounts for 40 percent of production costs.  “Chalco’s production costs remained at a very high level”
despite rising aluminum prices, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
analysts Julian Zhu and Steven Tao wrote in a report today.
“Any further investments in its alumina/aluminum business would
likely not be profitable in the near term,” they wrote.  Chalco fell 2.7 percent to trade at HK7.48 at 10.05 a.m. in  Hong Kong . The stock has gained 5.6 percent this year, compared
with a 1.1 percent increase in the benchmark  Hang Seng Index .
Shares in  Shanghai  rose 2.6 percent to 11.03 yuan.  The cost of sales rose 64 percent last year, the company
said in a statement late yesterday. China’s government has
limited electricity use, which curbed aluminum output. Full-year
profit was 778 million yuan on sales of 121 billion yuan, the
statement said.  United Co. Rusal, the world’s biggest producer, expects the
price of aluminum to rise to $2,700 a ton in 2012. Global demand
for aluminum may rise 8 percent this year, while Chinese demand
likely growing 12 percent, the Moscow-based producer said in
January.  --Xiao Yu. Editors: Alan Soughley, Andrew Hobbs  To contact the reporter for this story:
