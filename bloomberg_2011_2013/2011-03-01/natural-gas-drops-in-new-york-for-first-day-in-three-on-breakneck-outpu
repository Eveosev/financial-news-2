Natural gas futures fell the most in
three weeks on speculation that production will rise faster than
demand as the end of the U.S. winter heating season nears.  Gas futures dropped 4.1 percent as U.S. output of the fuel
advanced for the fifth consecutive month in December, the Energy
Department reported yesterday. Temperatures may be above normal
next week in eastern states, crimping demand for the heating and
power-plant fuel.  “We’re producing at a breakneck pace, and we’re not using
enough of it,” said  Mike Rose , the director of energy trading
at Angus Jackson Inc. in  Fort Lauderdale ,  Florida . “Without the
cold weather to give the market a bid, we’re going to be stuck
in a range.”  Natural gas for April delivery fell 16.4 cents to settle at
$3.873 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , the biggest one-day decline since Feb. 7.
The futures have dropped 17 percent from a year ago. Gas futures
rose near the 100-day moving average of $4.1002 yesterday before
paring gains.  U.S. gas production advanced 1.1 percent in December from
November, according to the Energy Department’s monthly EIA-914
report. Output in the lower 48 states increased for a second
month, advancing 0.2 percent to 66.76 billion cubic feet a day
from a revised 66.6 billion.  “Production does still look pretty solid,” said  Kyle Cooper , director of research for IAF Advisors in Houston.
“We’re entering a lower demand period.”  Production in  Louisiana  gained 2.7 percent as drilling in
the Haynesville Shale gas formation increased, according to the
report.  Supply Report  The U.S. gas market may have excess supplies of about 1.6
billion cubic feet a day in 2011, said Pearce Hammond, an
analyst with Simmons & Co. International in Houston, in a note
to clients today.  Gas inventories dropped 81 billion cubic feet in the week
ended Feb. 18 to 1.83 trillion cubic feet, the Energy Department
said Feb. 24. A deficit to five-year average supplies for the
week narrowed to 3.2 percent from 6.3 percent the previous week.  Analysts are predicting another below-normal withdrawal
from gas inventories for the week ended Feb. 25. Department data
may show stockpiles fell 90 billion cubic feet last week,
according to the median of nine estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
The five-year average withdrawal is 131 billion.  Weather Outlook  Temperatures may be above-normal in the Northeast and South
from March 6 through March 10, according to MDA Federal Inc.’s
EarthSat Energy Weather in Rockville,  Maryland .  “In the East, the warmest conditions are expected early,
but the warmth should continue through most of the period,” MDA
meteorologists led by Travis Hartman said in a note to clients.  Heating demand in the Northeast may be 28 percent below
normal levels on March 6, according to Weather Derivatives in
Belton,  Missouri .  The low in New York on March 9 may be 42 degrees Fahrenheit
(6 Celsius), 9 degrees above normal, according to AccuWeather
Inc. in  State College ,  Pennsylvania . The low in  Washington  may
be 45 degrees, 10 above normal.  About 52 percent of U.S. households use natural gas for
heating, according to the Energy Department.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
258,553 as of 2:40 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 305,000. Volume was 258,922 yesterday. Open interest was
958,906 contracts. The three-month average open interest is
834,000. The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting
open interest and full volume data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
