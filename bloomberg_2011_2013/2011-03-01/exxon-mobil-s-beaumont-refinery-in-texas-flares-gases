  Exxon Mobil Corp ., the largest U.S.
oil company, flared gases at its refinery in Beaumont,  Texas ,
according to a message left on a community hot line.  “Conditions at the refinery at the time necessitated that
we flare,” Kevin Allexon, a company spokesman based in Fairfax,
Virginia, said in an e-mail today. Allexon declined to comment
further.  Outages can increase prices for refined products as
refiners turn to spot markets to help them meet supply
contracts. Operational disruptions can also depress prices for
crude oil because less feedstock is needed.  The plant can process 359,100 barrels of crude a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
