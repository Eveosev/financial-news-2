Swiss manufacturing growth rose more
than expected in February, adding to signs the economy is
maintaining some momentum.  The SVME Purchasing Managers’ Index increased to 63.5 from
60.5 in January when adjusted for seasonal swings, Zurich-based  Credit Suisse Group AG  said in an e-mailed statement today.
That’s the highest in seven months. Economist had expected an
increase to 60.9, the median of nine forecasts in a Bloomberg
News survey shows. A reading above 50 indicates growth.  In a separate report, the Swiss government today said that
gross domestic product rose a higher than expected 0.9 percent
in the fourth quarter as investments gained and private
consumption was holding up.  To contact the reporter on this story:
