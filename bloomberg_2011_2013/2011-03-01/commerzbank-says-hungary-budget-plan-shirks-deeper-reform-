Tatha Ghose, an economist at
Commerzbank AG in  London , comments on Hungarian plans revealed
today to reduce public debt to 50 percent of gross domestic
product by 2018 and for deficit cuts of 900 billion forint ($4.6
billion) in 2013 and 2014.  Ghose made the comments in an e-mailed note.  “The objective of the plan is to boost trend growth, and
make Hungary’s fiscal and debt situation long-term sustainable.
While neither of these objectives were met to any great extent,
some of the announced measures target micro inefficiencies which
have plagued the Hungarian system for decades. Tackling these
would help in the long term. But, the observed headline budget
improvements accrue from continuing crisis taxes and pension
changes, not from deeper reform.  “Our conclusion is that many of the micro changes being
introduced, on medical benefits, drug law, disability pension,
withdrawal of transport subsidy, are long overdue reforms, which
are all positive.  “However, the major medium-term headline improvements
claimed by the plan are being achieved by the easier route of
retaining the crisis taxes, and cutting transfers to the private
pension system.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
