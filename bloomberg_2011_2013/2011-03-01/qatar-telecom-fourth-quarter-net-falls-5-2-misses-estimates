  Qatar Telecom  QSC, the Persian Gulf
nationâ€™s largest company by revenue, said fourth-quarter profit
fell 5.2 percent amid increased competition in its home market
and as margin on earnings declined.  Net income fell to 451.9 million riyals ($124 million) in
the three months ended Dec. 31 from 476.5 million riyals a year
earlier, the company said in an e-mailed statement today. The
median estimate of three analysts was for a profit of 639
million riyals, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  EBITDA margin in the quarter dropped to 41 percent from 45
percent, while full-year revenue in Qatar, where it faces
competition from Vodafone Qatar, declined to 5.4 billion riyals
from 5.7 billion riyals in 2009. Qatar Telecom, which operates
in 17 countries, said its board recommended a full-year dividend
of 5 riyals a share and one free share for every five held.  EBITDA is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Robert Tuttle  in Doha at
