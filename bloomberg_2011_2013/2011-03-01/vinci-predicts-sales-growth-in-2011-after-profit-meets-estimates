  Vinci SA ,  Europe ’s biggest builder,
forecast revenue will grow at least 5 percent in 2011 after
reporting annual profit that met analysts’ estimates.  Net income rose to 1.78 billion euros ($2.5 billion) in
2010 from 1.6 billion euros, the company, based near Paris, said
in a statement today. The average estimate of 10 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg was 1.74 billion euros.  “Vinci has moved into 2011 with the strengths and
determination needed to go on building its business activities
in a balanced manner by continuing to improve their overall
performance,” the company said in the statement.  Vinci predicted profit will grow at the same pace as sales
this year, boosted by highway concessions and its traditional
construction arm. The company stands to benefit from last year’s
acquisitions of Cegelec SA, facility management company Faceo
and some Tarmac quarries as well as traffic and price increases
in the group’s highways.  The group’s net debt held steady in 2010 at about 13
billion euros. Vinci plans to pay a dividend of 1.67 euros,
compared with 1.62 euros in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
