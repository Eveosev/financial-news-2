European stocks retreated as oil
surged amid concern anti-government protests in the Middle East
may spread, overshadowing signals from China to  Germany  that the
global economy is strengthening.    United Business Media Ltd . sank the most in almost four
years after saying margins narrowed at its news and data-
services divisions.  HSBC Holdings Plc  fell for a second day as
Deutsche Bank AG and UBS AG downgraded  Europe ’s largest bank.  Cookson Group Plc  soared 5.2 percent as the world’s biggest
maker of ceramic linings for metal smelters returned to profit
and paid its first dividend since 2008.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index lost 0.6 percent to 284.63 at
the 4:30 p.m. close in London. The gauge erased an earlier
advance of 0.9 percent amid reports that  Iran  arrested
opposition leaders Mir-Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karrubi to
derail demonstrations scheduled for today.  Saudi Arabia ’s
benchmark stock index plunged the most since November 2008 on
concern political turmoil may spread to the kingdom.  “People are wary,” said Bill Ismail, a trader at City
Index Ltd. in  London . “No one knows the extent of what will
happen if unrest spreads to Saudi Arabia. What’s for sure is
that if there are protests in Saudi, then the events in Egypt
and Libya will seem insignificant.”  Popular Uprisings  The Stoxx 600 sank 2.4 percent last week as opponents of
Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi seized control of large parts of
the country. Popular uprisings across the Middle East and North
Africa over the past two months have already unseated Tunisia’s
Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and Egypt’s Hosni Mubarak.  National benchmark indexes fell in 14 of the 18 western
European markets today. Germany’s DAX Index slid 0.7 percent,
while  France ’s CAC 40 lost 1.1 and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 retreated
1 percent.  Oil for April delivery rose as much as 2.3 percent to
$99.15 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  “There’s speculation that there’s not enough oil around
and if the price continues to go up it will take out a lot of
GDP growth,” said Dieter Buchholz, head of equities at Falcon
Private Bank in Zurich, which has 13 billion Swiss francs ($14
billion) under management.  Meanwhile, reports today suggested the economic recovery is
on track. China’s Purchasing Managers’ Index for February was
52.2, the  China  Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said
today. That’s the 24th straight month the reading has remained
above 50, signaling expansion in manufacturing, and compares
with the median forecast of 52.1 in a Bloomberg survey of 14
economists.  Unemployment  Japan’s unemployment rate held steady at 4.9 percent in
January while the number of people in work increased by 170,000,
the statistics bureau said. German joblessness plunged in
February to the lowest since September 1992 as demand for
machines and cars surged, the Federal Labor Agency said.  In the U.S., the Institute for Supply Management’s factory
index showed manufacturing grew in February at the fastest pace
since May 2004.  United Business Media, the publisher of InformationWeek,
tumbled 8.6 percent to 651 pence, the biggest decline since
March 2007. Full-year adjusted operating profit was little
changed at 171.8 million pounds ($279 million), “reflecting
higher investment in new product development, sales and IT,”
UBM said.  HSBC fell 3 percent to 658 pence, leading bank shares to
the biggest drop among 19 industry groups in the Stoxx 600.
Deutsche Bank downgraded the stock to “hold” from “buy” and
UBS cut its rating to “neutral” from “buy” after HSBC
reported earnings yesterday.  BNP, SocGen    BNP Paribas  SA, France’s biggest bank, dropped 2.6 percent
to 55.12 euros and  Societe Generale  SA retreated 3.5 percent to
49.19 euros.  Carnival Plc, the world’s biggest cruise-line operator,
plunged 5.6 percent to 2,601 pence in London. Chief Operating
Officer Howard Frank sold 180,000 shares at $42.60 each,
according to a filing yesterday.    Kingfisher Plc  slid 4.5 percent to 243 pence as Societe
Generale analysts downgraded Europe’s largest home-improvement
retailer to “sell” from “hold.”  Cookson soared 5.2 percent to 688 pence after reporting
full-year net income of 145.3 million pounds and declaring a
dividend of 11.5 pence a share. The company said it expects to
increase the payout by more than 10 percent a year in line with
the increase in earnings.  Aixtron Advances  Aixtron SE rallied 3.6 percent to 30.95 euros. The maker of
equipment used to produce light-emitting-diode screens proposed
to quadruple its dividend to 60 cents from 15 cents, after full-
year profit and sales increased.    SGL Carbon SE  surged 5.1 percent to 28.40 euros, the
highest price in more than a month. Volkswagen AG bought an 8.2
percent stake in the German company that has a partnership with
Bayerische Motoren Werke AG to build a factory in the U.S. to
make carbon-fiber parts for electric cars.    Remy Cointreau SA  gained 2.7 percent to 50.01 euros as the
distributor of wines and spirits said it has entered talks that
could lead to the sale of its Champagne division to EPI, the
owner of French retail brands including Bonpoint. The division
may reap about 410 million euros ($568 million), Le Figaro
reported without saying where it got the information.    Omega Pharma  NV rose 4.9 percent to 36.69 euros. Belgium’s
biggest supplier of pharmacy products reported 2010 net income
of 69.5 million euros, beating the 68.3 million-euro average
estimate of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The company
forecast margins will be “at least stable” this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
