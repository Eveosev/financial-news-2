Higher food prices are undermining
stability and increasing poverty in  developing countries ,
Treasury Department assistant secretary Marisa Lago said today.  “Rising food prices pose great risks to many in the
developing world,” Lago said in the prepared text of a speech
in  Washington . Lago called on countries around the world to make
good on 2009 pledges to donate $22 billion for agricultural
investments in low-income countries.  “Unlike the last food price spike in 2007 and 2008, today
there are mechanisms in place that can help mitigate the short-
run impacts of higher food prices and also address the need for
longer-term investments,” Lago said.  -- Editors: Kevin Costelloe  To contact the reporters on this story:
