German 10-year bond yields climbed
to a one-week high as reports showed the nation’s unemployment
plunged in February while euro-area inflation remained above the  European Central Bank ’s ceiling.  The two-year note yield was within six basis points of an
18-month high. Irish 10-year bonds rose as talks began on
forming a new government following a Feb. 25 election at which
no party won a majority. The Netherlands sold 6 billion euros
($8.3 billion) of 2021 bonds while  Austria  issued 1.3 billion
euros of 2015 and 2022 debt.  “Really good figures from the German labor market are a
burden on the bund market at the moment,” said Ralf Umlauf,
head of floor research at Helaba Landesbank Hessen-Thueringen in  Frankfurt .  German 10-year yields were little changed at 3.18 percent
as of 4:43 p.m. in London after rising to as much as 3.21
percent, the highest since Feb. 21. The 2.5 percent security due
January 2021 fell 0.075, or 75 euro cents per 1,000-euro face
amount, to 94.32. Two-year yields were also little changed at
1.53 percent.  The number of people out of work in  Germany  fell a
seasonally adjusted 52,000 from January to 3.07 million, the
lowest since September 1992, data from the Federal Labor Agency
showed. Inflation in the 17-nation bloc quickened to 2.4 percent
in February, from 2.3 percent a month earlier, the European
Union’s statistics office said, increasing pressure on the
European Central Bank to raise  interest rates  later this year.  Growth Forecast  A euro-region manufacturing gauge rose to 59 last month
from 57.3 in January, London-based Markit Economics said today,
confirming a Feb. 21 estimate. That’s the highest since June
2000. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  Gross domestic product in the euro region may increase 1.6
percent in 2011, above an earlier forecast of 1.5 percent
growth, the Brussels-based European Commission said in a report
published today. Inflation will average 2.2 percent this year,
the agency forecast, up from a November estimate of 1.8 percent.  Spanish and Italian bonds rose. The yield on  Spain ’s 10-
year bonds fell 5 basis points to 5.34 percent, a nine-day low.  Italy ’s 10-year yield fell three basis points to 4.81 percent,
the least in a week.  “Of the peripherals, investors seem to be holding the most
faith in Spain and Italy at the moment,” said Eric Wand, a
rates strategist at Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets in London.
“When risk appetite comes back, they tend to benefit.”  Rate Bets  Austria sold 660 million euros of bonds maturing in April
2022 at an average yield of 3.647 percent, compared with 3.685
percent when it last sold the securities in January through
banks. It also issued 660 million euros of 2015 notes at an
average yield of 2.514 percent, compared with 1.816 percent in a
November sale.  Belgium  sold three- and six-month Treasury bills,
and Malta auctioned 91-day bills.  Investors bid for 1.2 times the amount of 10-year
securities sold by the Netherlands. The bonds were sold at an
average yield of 3.494 percent, compared with a yield of 2.606
percent at an auction of similar-maturity debt sold Nov. 9.  Germany plans to sell an additional 5 billion euros of
2 percent notes due 2016 tomorrow.  Portugal  is scheduled to sell
between 750 million and 1 billion euros of Treasury bills
maturing in September 2011 and February 2012. It also plans to
buy back securities maturing in April and June this year.  Three-month Euribor futures fell, pushing the implied yield
up one basis point to 1.94 percent. The rate has risen from 1.33
percent at the end of 2010, as traders added to bets that the
ECB will boost borrowing costs.  Coalition Talks  The Frankfurt-based central bank holds its next policy
meeting on March 3. It has kept its key interest rate at a
record low of 1 percent since May 2009 and is forecast to leave
it unchanged this month, according to all 53 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News.  ECB governing council member  Mario Draghi  said on Feb. 26
that inflation pressures are forcing policy makers to focus more
on the timing of interest-rate increases.  Ireland’s 10-year bond yields were four basis points lower
at 9.30 percent after earlier rising to 9.45 percent, the
highest since Nov. 30. Enda Kenny, leader of Ireland’s Fine Gael
party, is starting talks on forming a new government after
elections ejected the ruling Fianna Fail party. Kenny said he
will seek to lower the 5.8 percent interest rate on the
country’s aid loans from the European Union and the  International Monetary Fund .  German  government bonds  handed investors a loss of 1.3
percent this year, compared with 0.1 percent for  U.S. Treasuries 
and 1.2 percent for U.K. gilts, according to indexes compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies.  To contact the reporters on this story:
