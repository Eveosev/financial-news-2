  Metorex Ltd ., planning to invest as
much as $150 million to build a copper project in the Democratic
Republic of Congo, is negotiating loans to help fund the mine as
rising prices spur producers to expand.  Management may seek board approval for the Kinsenda project
at the end of April and start digging the mine soon after, Chief
Executive Officer Terence Goodlace said today by mobile phone.
The CEO is in talks on a $66 million loan to replace existing
debt facilities expiring in 2013, he said.  Rising demand for metals and minerals in emerging markets
has pushed up prices, triggering an increase in investment in
new reserves. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24
commodities has jumped 35 percent in the past year as the cost
of raw materials from copper to wheat and cotton advanced.  Kinsenda, where some infrastructure already exists, may
produce 22,000 metric tons of copper a year, boosting Metorex’s
output of the metal by about 40 percent, Goodlace said. The CEO
is also studying other projects in Congo and Zambia to benefit
from a forecast supply shortfall this decade. Copper prices rose
by a third in the past 12 months to $9,822 a ton in  London .  Metorex increased output of the metal by 5 percent in the
six months ended Dec. 31 to 26,358 tons and raised cobalt
production by 26 percent to 2,021 tons, the company said today
in a statement.  Metorex gained 2 cents, or 0.4 percent, to 5.72 rand as of
10:20 a.m. in Johannesburg trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
