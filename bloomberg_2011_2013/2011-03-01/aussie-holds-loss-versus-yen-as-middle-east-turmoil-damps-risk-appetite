The Australian dollar held onto
yesterday’s drop against the yen as turmoil in North Africa and
the Middle East reduced demand for higher-yielding currencies.  The so-called Aussie fell against eight of its 16 major
counterparts before a report on the nation’s economic growth.  New Zealand ’s dollar was about 0.5 percent away from the lowest
level against the yen in almost four months as a global slump in
stocks damped investor appetite for riskier assets.  “Those equity markets provide an indication to future
growth or expectations of future growth,” said  Richard Grace ,
chief currency strategist in Sydney at Commonwealth Bank of  Australia , the nation’s biggest lender. “If they are lower,
it’s generally not a reason to buy the Aussie, rather it’s a
reason to either take profit or sell.”  The Australian dollar was at 83.05 yen as of 10:23 a.m. in
Sydney from 82.95 yen in  New York  yesterday when it fell 0.4
percent. The Aussie bought $1.0136 from $1.0134.  New Zealand’s dollar traded at 61.26 yen from 61.16 yen. It
dropped to 60.85 yen on Feb. 24, the lowest level since Oct. 29.
The so-called kiwi bought 74.75 U.S. cents from 74.72 cents.  Crude oil climbed 2.7 percent to $99.63 a barrel, the
highest settlement since September 2008 as Libyan rebels braced
for renewed clashes with forces loyal to leader  Muammar Qaddafi .  Saudi Arabia ’s benchmark stock index plunged the most since
November 2008 on concern regional unrest would extend to the
kingdom, and Iranian protesters clashed with security forces in
Tehran, Al Arabiya television reported.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 1.6 percent in New
York yesterday, while the Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell 0.6
percent.  Australia’s gross domestic product expanded 0.7 percent in
the fourth quarter from the previous period when it grew 0.2
percent, according to the median estimate of economists surveyed
by Bloomberg. The report is due at 11:30 a.m. in Sydney.  To contact the reporter on this story:
