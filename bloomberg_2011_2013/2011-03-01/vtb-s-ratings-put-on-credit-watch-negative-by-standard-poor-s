VTB Group’s long-term and national
ratings were put on credit watch negative by  Standard & Poor’s 
Ratings Services, which cited the lender’s acquisition of a
stake in Bank of Moscow.  VTB’s ‘BBB’ rating was placed on credit watch due to “the
likely significant negative impact on VTB’s risk-adjusted
capital position of its cash acquisition of Bank of Moscow,”
S&P said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
