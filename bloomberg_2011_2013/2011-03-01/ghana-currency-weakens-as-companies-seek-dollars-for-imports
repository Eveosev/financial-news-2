  Ghana ’s cedi declined against the  U.S. dollar  as corporations sought foreign currency to finance
imports.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
traded at 1.5170 per dollar at 2:11 p.m. from 1.5155 yesterday,
according to data from  Barclays Bank  of Ghana Ltd.  The cedi weakened on “corporate demand,” said Jacob Brobbey, a currency trader with the Accra-based lender, by phone
today.  On Feb. 16, the Bank of Ghana sold its first three-year
bond of 2011, spurring a rally in the currency. It rose 4.3
percent in February, the biggest monthly gain since June 2001
according to Bloomberg data.  “Normally after a bond auction the cedi sheds some of its
gains,” Brobbey said, adding that the central bank may sell
dollars tomorrow to support the domestic currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
