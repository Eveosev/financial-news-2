Congress may damage national
security by using stopgap spending legislation instead of
regular appropriations bills, U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary
William Lynn said today.  The Defense Department has been funded since October at
fiscal year 2010 levels through a stopgap measure known as a
continuing resolution. That funding legislation will expire
March 4. The U.S. Senate and House are negotiating a measure to
finance the government until Sept. 30, the end of fiscal year
2011.  “In our view, this is not a workable approach” Lynn said
at a Senate hearing today. A continuing resolution “will damage
national security,” he said.  The U.S. Army and Navy will be struggling with maintenance
of equipment, such as Black Hawk helicopters made by Sikorsky, a
unit of  United Technologies Corp ., and Kiowa Warrior helicopters
made by Bell, a unit of  Textron Inc ., Lynn said.  The Navy may need to reduce maintenance by $900 million,
which would result in the cancellation of maintenance for 29
ships out of 85. The Navy would also have to defer torpedo and
missile certifications, he said.  “Deferring maintenance this way does serious damage to the
readiness of the world’s finest military,” Lynn said. Lynn made
the case for a 2011 defense appropriations bill rather than
another continuing resolution -- and continued uncertainty --
after March 4.  “We have been holding our breath so long we are starting
to turn blue,” said Pentagon comptroller Robert Hale. “We
really need help,” Hale spoke at the same hearing as Lynn.  To contact the reporter on this story:
