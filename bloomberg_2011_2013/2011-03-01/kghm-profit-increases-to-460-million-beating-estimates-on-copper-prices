  KGHM Polska Miedz SA , Polandâ€™s only
copper producer, said fourth-quarter unconsolidated net income,
which excludes earnings at certain units such as phone company
Telefonia Dialog SA, rose to 1.32 billion zloty from 685.4
million a year earlier. That compares with the 1.24
billion-zloty mean estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  The average price of copper on the London Metal Exchange
in the quarter rose 29 percent from a year earlier.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
