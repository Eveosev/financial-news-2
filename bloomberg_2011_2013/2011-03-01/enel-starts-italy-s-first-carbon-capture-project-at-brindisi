  Enel SpA , Italy’s biggest energy
company, started operating the country’s first plant for
capturing carbon dioxide emissions and storing them underground
in a pilot project intended to make the technology viable.  Enel won 100 million euros ($138 million) in European Union
funding for two projects to sequester emissions. The first is a
20 million-euro facility to capture 8,000 metric tons of CO2 a
year at its coal-fired plant in the southern Adriatic city of
Brindisi. It’s a test for a larger-scale project at Enel’s Porto
Tolle coal plant in northeastern Italy, which will capture 1
million metric tons of the greenhouse gas.  The company is investing 2.5 billion euros in its Porto
Tolle plant, which will have generating capacity of about 2,000
megawatts. An additional 1 billion euros will be invested over
10 years on  carbon capture  at this plant, Livio Vido, Enel’s
head of engineering and innovation, said today at a press
conference in Brindisi.  To contact the reporters on this story:
