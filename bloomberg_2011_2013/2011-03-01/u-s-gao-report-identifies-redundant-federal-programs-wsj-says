The U.S. Government Accountability
Office found redundant and potentially ineffective federal
programs in many areas of government, the Wall Street Journal
reported, citing a report by the agency.  The nonpartisan GAO said the overlapping programs may cost
taxpayers billions of dollars each year, the newspaper said,
citing the study.  The agency looked at the departments of defense,
agriculture and housing and urban development, the Journal said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
