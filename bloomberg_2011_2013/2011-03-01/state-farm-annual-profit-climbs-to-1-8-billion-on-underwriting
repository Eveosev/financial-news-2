State Farm Mutual Automobile
Insurance Co., the biggest U.S. home and car insurer, said full-
year profit more than doubled as underwriting losses narrowed.  Net income for 2010 rose to $1.8 billion from $777 million
a year earlier, the Bloomington, Illinois-based company said
today in a statement. The insurer is owned by its policyholders
and reports results once annually.  State Farm, led by Chief Executive Officer Ed Rust, was
helped by a recovery in debt and equity markets and a  hurricane
season  that left the U.S. largely unscathed. A rebound in policy
sales led by a revival in personal auto and home coverage
bolstered revenue at U.S. property-casualty insurers.  State Farm is “a well-managed company” that shows how
insurers can profit when investment returns cushion losses from
underwriting, said billionaire investor  Warren Buffett  in his
 annual letter  to  Berkshire Hathaway Inc . shareholders on Feb.
26. Berkshire’s Geico Corp. competes with State Farm for
customers seeking auto coverage.  Rust, 60, was paid $10.2 million in 2010, a figure tied to
three years of results including customer retention, employee
satisfaction, growth and financial results, said Dick Luedke, a
State Farm spokesman. Rust’s compensation, which totaled
$9.44 million a year earlier, includes a guaranteed salary that
has been about $1.75 million since 2001.  Net Worth  The insurer’s net worth, a measure of assets minus
liabilities, rose 5.3 percent to $61.2 billion on the investment
gains, including a $1.9 billion increase in its property and
casualty stock portfolio.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index returned 15 percent last
year, including dividends, after a 26 percent gain in 2009.
State and local  government bonds  returned 2.3 percent in 2010,
including invested interest, after rising 14 percent a year
earlier, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s Municipal
Master Index.  Catastrophes after reinsurance cost State Farm $4 billion
in 2010 and contributed to a $3.1 billion underwriting loss at
its property-casualty businesses, Luedke said. A year earlier,
disaster claims cost the insurer $3.6 billion and led to an
underwriting loss of $3.7 billion.  None of 19 named storms last year made landfall in the U.S.
as a hurricane, according to the National Hurricane Center in
Miami.  Policy Sales  Policy sales throughout the industry rose 2.3 percent to
$110.7 billion in the three months ended Sept. 30, the  Property
Casualty Insurers Association of America  said on Dec. 21. The
last time sales climbed more was in the third quarter of 2006,
according to the group’s data.    Allstate Corp ., the second-biggest home and auto insurer in
the U.S., said annual profit increased to $928 million last year
from $854 million in 2009.  Underwriting losses at State Farm’s auto business, which
provides the majority of its property-casualty premium revenue,
widened to $2.8 billion from $2.7 billion a year earlier. The
insurer had about 42.5 million auto policies at the end of 2010,
little changed from the previous year, Luedke said.  Allstate, based in Northbrook,  Illinois , reported eight
straight quarterly declines in the number of standard auto
policyholders. Progressive Corp., the fourth-largest car
insurer, added policies in 2010.  Bank Losses  Losses at State Farm’s bank narrowed to $35 million last
year from $158 million in 2009, as revenue rose on improved  credit quality , the statement said. The bank’s assets fell to
$15.1 billion at yearend from $16.2 billion a year earlier.  Allstate said last month that it’s exiting the banking
business and selling about $1.1 billion in deposits to
Riverwoods, Illinois-based Discover Financial Services amid
heightened scrutiny from industry regulators.  State Farm had 65,900 employees at the end of 2010,
compared with 67,500 a year earlier, Luedke said. Other
insurers, including American International Group Inc. and
Principal Financial Group Inc. also trimmed payrolls last year.
MetLife Inc. and Berkshire Hathaway increased the size of their
workforces in 2010.  State Farm, which has no publicly traded debt, reports
results based on state accounting rules for insurers. Publicly
traded insurers must use U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles, making comparisons inexact.  To contact the reporter on this story:
