Ghana’s  economy will grow by 13
percent this year, more than twice the rate of 2010, boosted by
both oil and non-oil industries, according to the  International
Monetary Fund .  The expansion will be “evenly divided between growth of
the non-oil economy and the start of oil production,” Peter
Allum, the fund’s mission chief for the West African nation,
told reporters in Accra, the capital, today. The projected rate
is faster than the government’s planned 12.3 percent and more
than last year’s 6 percent growth.  Ghana, the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer and
Africa’s second-largest gold miner, began production of oil for
export at its offshore Jubilee field on Dec. 15.  Output is expected to increase to 120,000 barrels a day
later this year from the current rate of about 50,000 barrels,
according to  Tullow Oil Plc , the field’s operator.  Editors:  Emily Bowers , Alan Crawford.  To contact reporter on this story:
