  Allstate Corp ., the largest publicly
traded U.S. home and auto insurer, sued Credit Suisse Group AG
units over claims they fraudulently sold the insurer more than
$231 million of residential mortgage-backed securities.  Allstate asked for damages including the lost market value
of the securities, plus principal and interest payments in the
suit, filed yesterday in New York state Supreme Court.  Credit Suisse is the latest target of Allstate’s litigation
over mortgage-backed securities. The company last month sued  JPMorgan Chase & Co . over $700 million of the securities the
bank sold the insurer;  Citigroup Inc ., over more than
$200 million; and Deutsche Bank AG, over about $185 million.
Allstate said the banks misrepresented underwriting standards,
owner occupancy data and loan-to-value ratios.  “The systemic (but hidden) abandonment of the disclosed
underwriting guidelines led to soaring default rates in the  mortgage loans  underlying the certificates,” Allstate said in
the Credit Suisse complaint. “The value of Allstate’s
certificates has plummeted, causing Allstate to incur
significant losses. These losses were not caused by the downturn
in the U.S. housing market, but by the defendants’ faulty
underwriting.”  Duncan King, a spokesman for Credit Suisse, declined to
comment.  The case is Allstate Insurance Co. v. Credit Suisse
Securities (USA) LLC, 650547/2011, New York state Supreme Court,
New York County (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
