  Fannie Mae  and Freddie Mac, the two
mortgage-finance companies operating under U.S. conservatorship
since the 2008 credit crisis, are borrowing billions of dollars
from the Treasury, much of which goes back to the U.S.
government in dividends, the Wall Street Journal reported.  Under the terms of the conservatorship, the two companies
have to pay a dividend of 10 percent on preferred shares, which
the U.S. government took in exchange for financial assistance;
this costs the two companies about $15 billion a year, and for
the past two quarters theyâ€™ve paid $7.5 billion in total
dividend payments, and received $5.7 billion in Treasury funds,
the newspaper reported.    To contact the editor responsible for this story:  Chris Peterson  at
