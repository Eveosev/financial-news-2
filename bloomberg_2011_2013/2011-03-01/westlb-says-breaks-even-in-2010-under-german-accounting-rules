WestLB AG, the state-owned lender
bailed out during the financial crisis, said it broke even last
year under German accounting rules.  The bank posted a result of “0 million euros” in 2010
following a loss of 295 million euros ($407 million) a year
earlier, Dusseldorf, Germany-based WestLB said in a statement
today, without providing details. The company’s result under
international financial reporting standards, or IFRS, is
scheduled to be published on March 25, Eberhard Roll, a
spokesman for WestLB, said by telephone today.  The lender needed bailouts from its owners, including the
German state of North Rhine Westphalia, and the country’s
federal government after running up losses amid the global
financial crisis. WestLB is seeking a buyer under conditions set
by the European Union for approving the aid. Its owners last
month submitted restructuring proposals for the bank to the
European Commission, the union’s executive arm.  Generally, banks’ results reported under German and IFRS
accounting standards can differ widely. In 2009, WestLB’s IFRS
loss totaled 531 million euros, according to the company’s
annual report for that year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
