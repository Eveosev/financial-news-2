CPC Corp. ,  Taiwan â€™s state-owned oil
company, said it will increase domestic liquefied petroleum gas
and natural gas prices for the month to reflect higher
international costs.  LPG prices will be raised by NT$0.50 (1.7 cents) per
kilogram and natural gas prices for household use will climb by
NT$0.45 per cubic meter, the Taipei-based company said on its
website today.  LPG, a by-product of oil refining, crude oil and gas
production, is used for cooking, heating and as motor fuel. The
wholesale price of the fuel for households will rise to NT$27.36
a kilogram from NT$26.86, effective from tomorrow, the company
said, without giving the new natural gas prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
