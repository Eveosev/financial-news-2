The following is a reformatted
version of the U.S. Treasury Department’s daily release on the
schedule for Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and other officials:  At 10 am, Secretary Geithner will testify before the House
Financial Services Committee to discuss the Administration’s
plan for reforming America’s housing finance market. The
Administration’s plan will wind down  Fannie Mae  and Freddie Mac
on a responsible timeline; reduce the government’s footprint in
housing finance; continue fixing the fundamental flaws in the
mortgage market; and provide targeted support for creditworthy
but underserved families who want to own their own home, as well
as affordable options for those Americans who rent. This
hearing, which will be held in the Rayburn House Office
Building, is open press.  In the afternoon, the Secretary will meet separately on
Capitol Hill with Senators Lugar and Kerry. Later in the
afternoon, the Secretary will meet on  Capitol Hill  with Senators
Whitehouse, Reed and Merkley. These meetings are closed press.  To contact the reporter on this story:
