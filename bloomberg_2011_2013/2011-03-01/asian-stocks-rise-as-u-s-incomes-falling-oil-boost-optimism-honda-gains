Asian stocks rose, driving a
regional benchmark index up for the third day as falling oil
prices and U.S. data showing higher personal incomes boosted
confidence in global economic growth prospects.    BHP Billiton Ltd ., the world’s No. 1 mining company,
climbed 0.6 percent in Sydney as copper advanced for the third
straight session in New York yesterday. Honda Motor Co., Japan’s
second-biggest carmaker, gained 1.8 percent in Tokyo as the yen
also weakened. Shinsei Bank Ltd. jumped 7.7 percent after Credit
Suisse Group AG raised its recommendation on the stock to
“outperform.” Developers rose in Hong Kong on speculation  China  may hold off interest rate increases.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index added 1.2 percent to 139.10 at
7:34 p.m. in Tokyo. The gauge, which advanced 0.6 percent in
February, dropped 2.1 percent last week as political unrest
swept the Middle East. All 10 industry groups tracked on the
index rose today.  “The fact that  oil prices  may be correcting back to levels
that are more reflective of the fundamentals is better for
everybody,” said Prasad Patkar, who helps manage about $1.8
billion at Platypus Asset Management Ltd. in Sydney. “If oil
spikes because of supply disruptions and stays elevated, then it
becomes just another tax on growth. The  U.S. economy  also seems
to be on the mend.”  Japan’s  Nikkei 225  Stock Average gained 1.2 percent. In  Australia , where the central bank today left its benchmark
interest rate at the highest level in the developed world, the
S&P/ASX 200 Index slipped 0.1 percent. China’s Shanghai
Composite Index rose 0.5 percent, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng
Index gained 0.3 percent. Markets in  South Korea  are closed
today.  U.S. Incomes  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.4 percent

rose to its highest level in more than 22 years.  In the U.S., incomes climbed 1 percent in January,
exceeding the median forecast of economists surveyed and the
most since May 2009, according to figures from the Commerce
Department yesterday in  Washington .  The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc. said
yesterday its business barometer rose to 71.2 in February, the
highest level since July 1988, from 68.8 in January. Figures
greater than 50 signal expansion. The gauge, which was projected
to fall, exceeded every estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  BHP, Rio  BHP climbed 0.6 percent to A$46.37 in Sydney, while rival
Rio Tinto Group rose 0.5 percent to A$85.31 as concern eased
that rising oil prices would choke off a global economic
recovery.  Crude oil for April delivery declined 0.9 percent to settle
at $96.97 a barrel in  New York  yesterday, the biggest daily drop
since Feb. 11, after  Saudi Arabia  offered to make up for
supplies lost because of unrest in  Libya .  “Although there’s still uncertainty about what’s happening
in North Africa and the Middle East, easing crude futures are
supportive” for the stock market, said Fumiyuki Nakanishi a
strategist at Tokyo-based SMBC Friend Securities Co. “The data
continues to show the economy is steadily improving.”  In Tokyo, Honda climbed 1.8 percent to 3,610 yen and Sony
Corp. Japan’s largest electronics exporter, rose 0.6 percent to
3,010 yen. Canon Inc., the world’s No. 1 maker of cameras,
gained 0.5 percent to 3,960 yen.  Yen Depreciation  The yen’s depreciation also gave a lift to Japan’s
exporters. The currency fell to as low as 82.24 against the
dollar, compared with 81.66 at the close of  stock trading  in
Tokyo yesterday. Against the euro, Japan’s currency weakened to
113.53 from 112.39. A weaker yen boosts the value of overseas
income at Japanese companies when converted into their home
currency.

after Credit Suisse raised the lender’s investment rating to
“outperform” from “neutral.”  In  Hong Kong , China Overseas Land & Investment Ltd.,
controlled by the nation’s construction ministry, gained 1.9
percent to HK$13.16 after a report showed China’s manufacturing
expanded at the slowest pace in six months, potentially reducing
the need for further interest-rate increases. China Resources
Land Ltd., a state-controlled developer, climbed 0.5 percent to
HK$12.70.  Noble Profit  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 0.2 percent through
yesterday in 2011, compared with gains of 5.5 percent by the S&P
500 and 3.9 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark are valued at 13.8 times estimated earnings on

exceeded analyst estimates while 165 trailed them.  To contact the reporters on this story:
