  Muammar Qaddafi  named Bouzid Dourda,
head of  Libya ’s external intelligence agency, to hold talks with
the interim council that controls the country’s east,  Quryna 
reported, citing unidentified people.  The interim council had indicated it won’t negotiate with
Qaddafi, the Benghazi-based newspaper said on its website.
Benghazi, the biggest city in eastern Libya, has fallen under
the rule of Qaddafi’s foes who are pushing to end his four-
decade rule.  Qaddafi also fired Abdallah Senoussi, his close aide and
head of Libya’s domestic intelligence services, Quryna reported
yesterday, citing people it didn’t name.  To contact the reporter on this story:
