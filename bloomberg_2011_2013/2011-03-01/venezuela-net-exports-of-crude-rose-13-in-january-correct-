Venezuela’s net exports of crude and
refined products rose 6.3 percent in January from a year earlier
to 2.54 million barrels a day, according to Inspectorate  Venezuela  SCS, a contractor to the country’s Energy Ministry.  Exports were about 13 percent higher than December´s
shipments, according to records e-mailed today to Bloomberg from
the ministry.  Production of crude increased to the highest level since
August, rising 4 percent to 2.8 million barrels a day in
December from 2.69 million barrels a day in November,
Inspectorate also said today. It didn’t give output for January.  Venezuela hired Inspectorate in 2009 to audit net exports
because of conflicting production reports.  OPEC estimated the country’s December production at 2.24
million barrels a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
