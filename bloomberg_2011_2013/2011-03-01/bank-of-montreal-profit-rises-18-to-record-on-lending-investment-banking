  Bank of Montreal ,  Canada ’s fourth-
biggest bank by assets, said profit rose to a record on gains
from consumer lending and  investment banking .  Net income for the quarter ended Jan. 31 rose 18 percent to
C$776 million ($800 million), or C$1.30 a share, from C$657
million, or C$1.12, a year earlier, the Toronto-based bank said
today in a statement. Revenue rose 11 percent to C$3.35 billion.  Bank of Montreal joins Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce
and National Bank of Canada in reporting higher earnings from
consumer lending after the country’s economy grew more than
economists forecast in the fourth quarter.  “We’ve seen some pretty good growth out of the retail bank
of Bank of Montreal over the last several quarters,” said  Craig Fehr , an analyst with Edward Jones & Co. in  St. Louis . “I would
expect that to continue.”  Adjusted earnings were C$1.32 a share, beating the average
estimate of C$1.31 a share from 14 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Bank of Montreal rose 26 cents to C$61.96 yesterday on the
Toronto Stock Exchange. The stock has risen 7.8 percent this
year, compared with a 7.5 percent gain for the 10-company  Standard & Poor’s /TSX Banks Index.  The bank had C$248 million in provisions for bad loans,
down from C$333 million a year earlier. The bank kept its
dividend unchanged at 70 cents.  Canadian consumer banking profit rose 10 percent to C$444
million from a year earlier. Profit from its Chicago-based
Harris consumer bank fell 18 percent to C$42 million.  The lender’s BMO Capital Markets investment-banking unit
earned C$257 million, up 21 percent from a year earlier.  Profit from the private-client group, which includes
brokerage, insurance, investing services and mutual funds, rose
38 percent to C$153 million.    Royal Bank of Canada , the largest lender, and Toronto-
Dominion Bank, the second-biggest bank, report results on March
3. Bank of Nova Scotia, the No. 3 bank, reports March 8.  (Bank of Montreal will hold a conference call to discuss
