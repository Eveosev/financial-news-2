     March 1 (Bloomberg) --  MetLife Inc . said 146.8 million of
its shares will be sold in public offerings as the firm raises
funds to redeem securities given to  American International Group
Inc . in the purchase of a non-U.S. life insurer. MetLife
declined in extended trading.  MetLife, the largest U.S. life insurer, will sell 68.6
million shares of its stock, and AIG will sell 78.2 million
MetLife shares, according to a Business Wire statement today.
MetLife plans to use the proceeds to repurchase and cancel
convertible preferred shares owned by New York-based AIG.  “The offerings are intended to provide for an orderly
disposition of the MetLife securities owned by AIG,” according
to the statement from MetLife.  MetLife in November paid $16.2 billion to buy American Life
Insurance Co. from bailed-out AIG to expand in nations including
Japan and Poland. MetLife paid $7.2 billion in cash and $9
billion in securities including common stock, convertible
preferred shares and equity units.  AIG will also offer 40 million MetLife common equity units,
according to the statement.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc .,  Citigroup
Inc . and  Credit Suisse Group AG  are managing the common stock
transaction.  MetLife dropped 4.8 percent to $43.85 at 5 p.m. in New
York. AIG slipped 10 cents to $36.60.  The transactions will allow AIG to accelerate its repayment
to the U.S. Treasury Department, which bailed out the insurer in
2008, the company said in a separate statement. Under the deal
struck last year, AIG had been required to hold the securities
for minimum periods of at least nine months.  “We appreciate MetLife’s agreement to permit the proposed
sales,” AIG Chairman Steve Miller said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
