The rand climbed for a fifth day
against the dollar as gold extended the best monthly gain since
April and a report showed manufacturing sentiment improved.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest economy appreciated 0.2
percent to 6.9447 rand per dollar as of 4:24 p.m. in
Johannesburg. Against the euro, the rand weakened 0.1 percent to
9.6071, snapping three days of gains.  Gold climbed as much as 0.8 percent to $1,423.30 an ounce,
extending last month’s 5.9 percent rally, as violence in  Libya 
and other Middle East states prompts investor demand for
precious metals as a protector of wealth. South Africa’s
purchasing managers’ index rose to a 10-month high in February,
spurred by a decline in the jobless rate and tempered by rising
input costs for manufacturers, Kagiso Securities Ltd. said.  “Commodity and emerging-market assets have continued to
enjoy strong support,” Tradition Analytics wrote in a client
note today. “Further rand gains are indeed possible.”  Metals, crops and fuel beat stocks, bonds and the dollar
for a third straight month, the longest stretch since June 2008,
as inflation lifted cotton and cocoa and investors speculated
violence in the Middle East and northern Africa will restrain
energy supplies. Bullion, along with platinum, accounts for
about a fifth of  South Africa ’s export revenue. The nation, with
more than $2.5 trillion in mineral reserves, is the world’s
richest nation by “commodity wealth” followed by Russia and
Australia, according to research by Citigroup Inc.  The seasonally adjusted index, a gauge of manufacturing,
advanced to 54.8 from 54.6 in January, Johannesburg-based Kagiso
said in an e-mailed statement today. The PMI has been above 50,
which indicates an expansion in factory production, for four
consecutive months.  South Africa’s 13.5 percent bond due September 2015 fell
for the first day in three, losing 10 cents to 121.442 rand,
raising the yield by two basis points to 7.803 percent.  Platinum jumped as much as 1.3 percent to $1,831.75 an
ounce, the highest in a week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
