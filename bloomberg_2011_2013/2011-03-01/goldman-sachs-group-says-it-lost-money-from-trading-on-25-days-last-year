  Goldman Sachs Group Inc ., the fifth-
biggest  U.S. bank  by assets, lost money from trading on 25 days
during 2010, up from a record-low 19 days in 2009, according to
a regulatory filing.  After incurring losses on trades during 12 days in the
first 9 months, the full-year figures indicate that Goldman
Sachs lost money on 13 days in the fourth quarter. The firm’s
traders also made $100 million or more on 68 days in 2010, down
from the record 131 days in 2009, according to the New York-
based company’s annual 10-K filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.  Traders exceeded the firm-wide “value-at-risk” limit, or
VaR, on one occasion during 2010 “to facilitate a client
transaction,” according to the filing. The risk position was
reduced the following day to comply with the limit, which is one
of the gauges Goldman Sachs uses to measure potential trading
losses. In 2009, the firm-wide VaR was exceeded on two
consecutive days, the filing said.  Although the filing doesn’t say when the VaR limit was
exceeded, it includes a graph showing a one-day increase in
daily value-at-risk early in the fourth quarter to a high of
$223 million from a fourth-quarter range of between about $100
million and $140 million. The average value-at-risk for the year
was $134 million, down from $218 million in 2009.  Goldman Sachs changed the way it reports trading revenue in
the last quarter of 2010, creating a separate category for so-
called “investing and lending” activities that were previously
included in trading. Under the new reporting system, the firm’s
2010 trading revenue dropped 33 percent from the previous year,
while revenue from investing and lending more than doubled.  Under the new reporting system, Goldman Sachs’s 2009
revenue from fixed income, currencies and commodities was cut by
$1.4 billion, or 6.1 percent, from the original figures. The
equities division’s revenue increased $950 million, or 9.6
percent, under the new method. The company didn’t provide 2010
results under the original reporting system.  To contact the reporters on this story:
