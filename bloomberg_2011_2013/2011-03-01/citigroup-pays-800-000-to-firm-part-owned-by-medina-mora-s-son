  Citigroup Inc ., the third-largest  U.S. bank , said it paid $800,000 for web-design services last
year to a company majority-owned by the son of consumer-banking
head Manuel Medina-Mora.  Jose Manuel Medina-Mora’s firm received the money from an
unnamed subsidiary of the New York-based lender, Citigroup said
yesterday in a regulatory filing. The son’s company, also
unnamed, provided services to a “transaction website” that
focuses on the Citigroup subsidiary’s “products and services,”
according to the filing.    Shannon Bell , a spokeswoman for the bank, declined to
comment on the identity of the subsidiary or the son’s firm. A
phone number for the son couldn’t immediately be found.  “The assignment has been fulfilled and the agreement is no
longer in effect,” according to the filing.  Manuel Medina-Mora, 60, chief executive officer of  consumer
banking  for the Americas, was the second-highest paid Citigroup
executive in 2010 with compensation of $12 million, a 33 percent
increase on 2009. He was among four Citigroup executives who
shared more than $42 million in compensation last year as the
bank rebounded from a $45 billion bailout in 2008, according to
the filing. The compensation includes $11.1 million in
restricted stock.  “Medina-Mora occupies a position that is unique in the
financial services industry,” the bank said in the filing.  He was previously chief executive officer of Banamex, the
Mexican lender, now a Citigroup subsidiary. Medina-Mora’s
benefit under “the Banamex Pension Plan” increased by $2.12
million last year, according to the filing.  To contact the reporters on this story:
