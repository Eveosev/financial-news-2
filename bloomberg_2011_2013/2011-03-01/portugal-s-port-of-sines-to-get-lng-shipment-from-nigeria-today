  Portugal ’s port of Sines was
scheduled to receive a shipment of liquefied natural gas from
Nigeria today.  The LNG Oyo is sailing from Bonny in Nigeria and was due to
dock at noon, according to the website of  Administracao do Porto
de Sines SA , the port’s management company.  The Sines LNG terminal, with a capacity of 5.26 billion
cubic meters of natural gas a year, is managed by REN-Redes
Energeticas Nacionais SA, the nation’s power and gas grid
operator. LNG is gas that’s cooled to a liquid for shipment by
tanker and then converted back to a gas at terminals for
distribution to users.    Galp Energia SGPS SA , Portugal’s biggest oil and gas
company, receives LNG at Sines, as well as gas from  Algeria 
through a pipeline crossing Morocco and Spain. Galp also
operates Portugal’s largest refinery at Sines. EDP-Energias de
Portugal SA, the country’s biggest power utility, runs a coal-
fired electricity plant at the site.  Other ships expected at Sines include Chaitali Prem, a ship
carrying coal that’s sailing from  Newport News  in the U.S. and
is scheduled to arrive on March 3. Seaprince, a tanker carrying
crude, is sailing from the Yoho terminal in Nigeria and is due
to arrive on March 5.  Sines is one of the European Union’s biggest deepwater
harbors, according to the port’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
