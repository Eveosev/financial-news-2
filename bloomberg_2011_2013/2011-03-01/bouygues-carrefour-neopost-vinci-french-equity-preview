  France ’s  CAC 40 Index (CAC)  retreated
32.83, or 0.8 percent, to 4,034.32 in Paris. The SBF 120 Index
also lost 0.8 percent.  The following shares rose or fell in Paris. Stock symbols
are in parentheses.    Arkema SA (AKE)   climbed 8 percent to 57.78 euros, a
fourth straight gain. The company said that it will meet its
2015 objectives. Arkema reported 2010 net income of 347 million
euros ($477 million), beating the average analyst estimate for
profit of 313 million euros.    Bouygues SA (EN)   advanced 3 percent to 34.21 euros, the
biggest gain since Jan. 18. Chief Executive Officer Martin Bouygues said the company is marginally hurt by the Middle East
turmoil because the construction of a metro line in Cairo is
temporarily halted. Bouygues has no operations in  Tunisia  nor in  Libya , the company said at a press conference in Paris.    Carrefour SA (CA)   slid 3.9 percent to 33.61 euros, the
biggest decline since Dec. 1. The company’s plans to spin off
100 percent of its Dia discount chain and 25 percent of its
real-estate unit may not achieve the company’s aim of boosting
value for shareholders, some analysts said.  Fitch Ratings  placed
Carrefour on rating watch negative.  Essilor International SA (EI FP) slid 3 percent to 51.08
euros, the biggest drop since May. Essilor said it’s targeting
sales growth of 6 percent to 8 percent in 2011. The stock was
cut to “underperform” from “outperform” at Cheuvreux SA.    Ipsen SA (IPN)   lost 1.7 percent to 24.35 euros, ending
three days of gains. The company said 2010 net income declined
39 percent to 95.3 million euros.    Sanofi-Aventis SA (SAN)   advanced 1 percent to 51.07
euros, a fifth straight advance. UBS AG raised its
recommendation on the shares of France’s biggest drugmaker to
“buy” from “neutral.”    STMicroelectronics NV (STM)  ,  Europe ’s biggest chipmaker,
gained 1.6 percent to 9.41 euros. JPMorgan Chase & Co. raised
its recommendation on the semiconductor industry to
“constructive” from “cautious.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
