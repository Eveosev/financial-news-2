  Bank of Japan  Governor Masaaki Shirakawa doesn’t believe the current historical high of the yen
is a risk to the Japanese economy, the Wall Street Journal
reported, citing an interview.  “At the moment, it is not working as an additional risk
factor,” Shirakawa told the newspaper, adding “but nobody
knows the course of exchange rates.”  He said that since August the yen had appreciated sharply,
business sentiment had worsened, although since the fall, there
had been no yen appreciation, and business had “somewhat
stabilized” as a result, the WSJ reported.  Although a strong yen made Japanese exports more expensive,
the rise had helped cushion the impact of rising commodity
prices, which in turn offset the negative impact in the increase
in the yen, he told the newspaper.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:  Chris Peterson  at
