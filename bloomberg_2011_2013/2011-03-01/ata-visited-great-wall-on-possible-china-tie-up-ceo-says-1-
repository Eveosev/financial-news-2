  Tata Motors Ltd ., the Indian
owner of Jaguar Land Rover, has met with companies including
Hebei-based Great Wall Motor Co. as part of its search for a
partner to build  luxury vehicles  in  China .  “It’s important to have a local partner,” Carl-Peter Forster, chief executive officer of the Mumbai-based
automaker, said in an interview at the Geneva Motor Show
today. “You need local knowledge, and also the government
requires involvement of a local manufacturer.”  Luxury vehicle makers including Bayerische Motoren Werke
AG and Daimler AG are expanding in China, where economic
growth and rising incomes spur demand for marquee brands.
Sales of Jaguar cars and Land Rover sport-utility vehicles
surged to a record in the nation last year, Tata Motors said
in January.  Tata Motors gained 4.7 percent to 1,134.95 rupees at
2:54 p.m. in Mumbai trading. The shares have dropped 13
percent this year, compared with a 10 percent drop on the
benchmark Sensex Index.  Sales rose 12 percent in February to 77,543 units, Tata
Motors,  India ’s biggest truckmaker, said in a separate
statement.  Jaguar Land Rover, which Tata Motors acquired from Ford
Motor Co. for $2.5 billion in 2008, posted a profit after tax
of 275 million pounds ($448 million) for the quarter ended in
December.  To contact the reporters on this story:
