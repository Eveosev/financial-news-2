Norwegian manufacturing growth
accelerated in February as orders increased at the fastest pace
in almost four years.  A seasonally adjusted index based on responses from
purchasing managers rose to 58.7, the highest since October
2007, from a revised 56 in January, Fokus Bank said today in a
statement. A reading above 50 signals growth. It was forecast to
rise to 56.2, according to the median estimate in a survey of
six analysts.  The mainland economy of the world’s second-richest country
per capita is expected to grow 3.3 percent this year after
expanding 2.2 percent last year, according to  Statistics Norway .  The sub-index measuring orders rose 61.6, the highest since
March 2007, from 56.6, while the gauge for production increased
to 59.7 from 56.3 in January, Fokus Bank said.  Norway’s PMI Index was started by Fokus Bank in 2004 in
cooperation with the Association for Purchasing and Logistics.
Fokus Bank is owned by Danske Bank A/S, Denmark’s biggest bank.  To contact the report on this story:
