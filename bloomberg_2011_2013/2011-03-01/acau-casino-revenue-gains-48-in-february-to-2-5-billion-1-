Casino revenue  in Macau, the world’s
largest casino hub, rose 48 percent in February as Chinese
gamblers placed more bets on baccarat and other card games.  Gambling revenue for  SJM Holdings Ltd. (880) ,  Sands China Ltd. (1928) 
and the four other casino operators in the former Portuguese
colony jumped to 19.9 billion patacas ($2.5 billion) from 13.4
billion patacas a year earlier, according to data from the
city’s  Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau .  Macau, the only place in China where casinos are legal,
boosted gambling revenue 58 percent to 188.3 billion patacas
last year, more than four times that of the $5.62 billion for
the Las Vegas Strip, according to government data.  The increase in February is “much higher than we
expected,” said Aaron Fischer, a Hong Kong-based analyst at
CLSA Ltd. “Spending on highly discretionary consumer categories
such as gaming and luxury goods has been extremely strong in
greater China over the last few months.”  Billionaire  Stanley Ho ’s SJM climbed 8.2 percent to
HK$12.40 at the close in Hong Kong trading. Sands China, the
Hong Kong-listed unit of billionaire  Sheldon Adelson ’s Las
Vegas-based company, rose 2.9 percent to HK$19.04.  Wynn Macau Ltd. (1128)  gained 2.4 percent to HK$21.60 and  Galaxy
Entertainment Group Ltd. (27)  advanced 11.2 percent to HK$11.16.
 Melco International Development Ltd. (200) , which has a venture with
Australian billionaire  James Packer ’s  Crown Ltd. (CWN) , climbed 5.3
percent to HK$5.17.  Stanley Ho’s daughter Pansy Ho has a closely held joint
venture with Kirk Kerkorian’s  MGM Resorts International. (MGM)   Macau’s visitor arrivals rose 1.4 percent to 2.1 million in
January, with more than half coming from mainland China,
according to the city’s  tourism agency . Gambling revenue for the
Chinese city’s six casinos reached 38.4 billion patacas in the
first two months of 2011, 40 percent higher than a year ago, the
bureau said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
