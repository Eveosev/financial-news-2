  Bellzone Mining Plc , developer of an
iron-ore project in Guinea, reported a wider 2010 loss and said
it’s raising as much as $200 million to fund investment.  The net loss was $24.1 million, or 4.806 cents a share,
compared with a loss of $13.1 million, or 3.110 cents, a year
earlier, the company said in a statement today.  China International Fund Ltd. agreed to invest about $100
million in the developer, Bellzone said in a separate statement.
The Perth, Australia-based company will raise a further $100
million by issuing new shares, according to the statement.  “Canaccord Genuity has underwritten $50 million of the
institutional placing,” it said in the statement.  Bellzone, which in May reached a binding accord with CIF
over funding rail and port infrastructure for its Kalia project
in  Guinea , plans to produce 20 million metric tons of ore a year
from the first quarter of 2014, and 50 million tons by 2018.  To contact the reporter on this story:
