  GKN Plc  and  Meggitt Plc , U.K. parts
suppliers to planemakers Airbus SAS and  Boeing Co ., said
production increases of new airliner models will propel revenue
growth as early as this year.  Meggitt, which makes jet-engine monitoring units, said
today that it’s forecasting “good” increases at existing
businesses in 2011, in addition to a contribution from an
acquisition. GKN said its aerospace division should return to
“its strong growth trend” in 2012 because of new plane models.  Boeing’s commitment for 2013 to build 10 planes a month of
the new 787 Dreamliner, even with a delay in the model’s
introduction, helps make GKN “quite optimistic,” Chief
Executive Officer Kevin Smith told journalists on a conference
call. Meggitt said revenue from airliner components may rise by
7 percent to 8 percent yearly through 2015, helped by the 787,
Airbus’s planned A350 and  Bombardier Inc .’s new CSeries.  “It’s good news for us” that planemakers are expanding,
Meggitt CEO Terry Twigger said in an interview today. “It’s
going to increase volumes going through our factories.”  Meggitt’s underlying pretax profit, which also excludes
amortization and financing costs, rose 9 percent in 2010 to
256.1 million pounds ($417 million) as sales increased 1 percent
to 1.16 billion pounds, the Christchurch, England-based
manufacturer said today in a statement.  GKN Investment  GKN’s pretax profit from continuing operations quadrupled
to 363 million pounds from 87 million pounds, the Redditch,
England-based company said separately. GKN will spend about 170
million pounds on the A350 program and may add employees to its
787 component-production lines, which include making the plane’s
de-icing system in Luton,  England .  “All those together, with some increase in production
rates on the existing civil airplanes, are making us quite
optimistic about 2012, 2013 and 2014, particularly with those
production ramp-ups,” Smith said.  Corporate-jet usage “rebounded strongly” in 2010, and
more growth is expected this year, Meggitt said. The company
expects revenue from original equipment for civilian aircraft to
grow at an average 7 percent to 8 percent a year through 2015.  “It’s been a pretty good year, taking it in total,” as
growth in the second half more than made up for a “weak” first
six months, Twigger said. “A lot of that that growth was in our
civil business, with stronger sales into power generation.”  Stock Prices  Meggitt rose as much as 21.4 pence, or 6.3 percent, to
359.6 pence and was up 3.6 percent as of 12:24 p.m. in  London 
trading, valuing the company at 2.7 billion pounds. GKN fell as
much as 3.1 percent to 203.5 pence and was down 2.8 percent.  Meggitt agreed on Jan. 18 to buy Pacific Scientific
Aerospace from Danaher Corp. for $685 million to expand its
range of firefighting products, allowing it to bundle together
more components for aircraft including the Dreamliner and
Airbus’s A380 superjumbo.  Pacific Scientific will bring electronic technology that
will add to Meggitt’s existing line of hydraulic and pneumatic
products, Twigger said. Use of electrical power by planes’
operating systems has about tripled in the past 20 years, “and
we see that as a continuing trend going forward.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
