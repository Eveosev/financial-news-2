The U.S. Treasury Department today
said it has priced a secondary offering at par for about $2.7
billion it holds in Ally Financial Inc. trust-preferred
securities.  “Today’s transaction represents an important step toward
exiting our investment in Ally,” said Tim Massad, acting
assistant secretary for financial stability, in a statement in  Washington . The sale is expected to close on March 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
