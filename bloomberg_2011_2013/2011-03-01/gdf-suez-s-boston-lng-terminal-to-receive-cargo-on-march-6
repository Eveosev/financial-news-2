  GDF Suez ’s liquefied-natural-gas
terminal near Boston is scheduled to receive a cargo March 6,
according to vessel tracking data compiled by Bloomberg.  GDF Suez Neptune, the tanker carrying the cargo, can move
as much as 145,130 cubic meters of LNG, or about 3.13 billion
cubic feet of natural gas, equivalent to 5 percent of estimated
daily U.S. gas production. The vessel is from  Trinidad and
Tobago , according to the data.  GDF Suez operates the Everett terminal, which can send
about 1 billion cubic feet of gas a day into the regional
pipeline network, according to  the company.  GDF’s Neptune
offshore LNG terminal, which consists of a buoy system, is also
near  Boston .  Natural gas scheduled for delivery to Massachusetts
residents rose 5 percent today to 1.22 dekatherms, or about 1.19
billion cubic feet, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  LNG is gas that’s cooled to a liquid for transport by ship
to markets not connected by pipelines. The fuel is received at
import terminals and converted back to a gas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
