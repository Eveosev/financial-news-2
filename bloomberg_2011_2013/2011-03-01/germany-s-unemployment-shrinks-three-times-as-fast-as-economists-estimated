German unemployment plunged in
February three times as fast as economists forecast, underlining
the gulf between  Europe ’s biggest economy and the region’s
peripheral countries.  The number of people out of work fell a seasonally adjusted
52,000 to 3.07 million, the lowest since September 1992, the
Nuremberg-based Federal Labor Agency said today. Economists
forecast a drop of 18,000, according to the median of 30
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  “The labour market recovery, which started around the
middle of 2009, is continuing at an unabated pace as the German
economy is powering ahead,” said  Aline Schuiling , an economist
at ABN Amro Bank NV in Amsterdam. Germany “remains the star
performer of the eurozone.”  Germany’s shrinking joblessness is helping  Chancellor
Angela Merkel ’s government meet a constitutionally imposed
deficit ceiling in 2015, a year earlier than planned. Merkel
plans to tout  Germany ’s belt-tightening at two European Union
summits this month that aim to staunch the financial crisis that
has forced Ireland and  Greece  to seek bailouts.  All European countries must take budget cutting “just as
seriously as we do in Germany,” bolstering competitiveness to
“maintain the confidence of financial markets” in the euro,
Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said yesterday in a speech.  The euro climbed 0.19 percent after the jobless report to
$1.3832 at 10:10 a.m. Frankfurt time, bringing the gain in the
single currency to 3.3 percent so far this year.  Ireland, Spain  As governments in countries such as  Portugal , Ireland,
Greece and Spain cut spending to rein in budget deficits, German
exports to  Asia  and stronger household spending are helping buoy
the economic outlook. Business confidence rose in February to
the highest since records for a reunified Germany began in 1991.  Consumer confidence  will increase to the highest level in three
and a half years in March as growth fuels income expectations,
Nuremberg-based market research company GfK said on Feb. 22.  Stuttgart-based  Daimler AG  said on Feb. 24 it will add
10,000 jobs, while Volkswagen AG, Europe’s biggest carmaker,
plans to add 6,000.  Robert Bosch GmbH , the world’s biggest
automotive supplier, said Jan. 24 that it plans to add 16,500
jobs this year to satisfy a “boom in emerging markets.”  “Economic growth has broadened, sparking company spending
in investment goods as well as solid growth in private
consumption,” Rainer Sartoris, an economist at HSBC Trinkaus &
Burkhardt in Dusseldorf, said in an interview.  Early Winter Onslaught  German joblessness has now declined for each of the last 19
months with the exception of December, when it rose by 1,000
amid the coldest winter in more than 40 years. The early
onslaught of winter led to a rise in unemployment sooner than
would normally be expected, helping the numbers in February, the
Labor Agency said. An ageing workforce also lowered the number
of those seeking work.  The adjusted jobless rate fell to 7.3 percent, the lowest
since December 1991, down from a post-World War II high of 12.1
percent in March 2005.  Ireland’s unemployment more than tripled over the same
period, to 13.4 percent in January from 4.1 percent in 2005,
according to Eurostat data. The jobless rate in  Spain  was 20.3
percent in December, up from 8 percent in 2007; in Greece, it
was 13.9 percent in November after 6.6 percent in 2008. Italy’s
jobless rate held at 8.6 percent in January for a third month,
close to a seven-year high.  ‘Good-News Show’  In Germany, “a further drop in unemployment to below 7
percent in the course of this year looks very likely,” said  Carsten Brzeski , an economist at ING Groep NV in Brussels.
“Even if the German economy is still a far cry from full
employment, the good-news show will continue.”  Using the latest data from the Paris-based  Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development , Germany’s unemployment
rate of 6.6 percent in December compared with an average in the-
then 16-state euro region of 10 percent and 9.6 percent in the
27-nation EU. In  France , Germany’s main EU trading partner, the
rate was 9.7 percent, in the U.S. 9.4 percent, while the Group
of Seven average was 8 percent.  Companies in Germany plan to hire as many as 300,000
workers this year, according to a survey of 28,000 firms by the
DIHK industry and trade chambers group this month. Machine and
electrical companies may add 80,000 jobs, the DIHK said.  Expansion by companies in Germany’s southern regions may
already be crimped by a shortage of skilled labor. A January IHK
industry and trade chamber poll of 3,800 companies in Bavaria
showed that some 41 percent of local companies were failing to
recruit skilled staff.  In January, the Labor Agency announced a 10-point plan
through to 2025 to reduce shortages of skilled labor as regional
offices reported 374,000 vacancies in technology as well as
health and service sectors such as hotels and catering.  To contact the reporters on this story:
