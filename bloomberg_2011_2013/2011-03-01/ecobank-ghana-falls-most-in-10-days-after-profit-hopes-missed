  Ecobank Ghana Ltd ., a lender in the
West African nation, fell for the first day in seven after the
bank’s full-year results did not meet investors’ expectations.  The stock lost 1 pesewa, or 0.3 percent, to closer at 3.49
cedis by 3 p.m. in the capital, Accra. That was the biggest loss
since Feb. 18.  “The bank’s 2010 results probably did not meet the
expectations of some investors,” said Hilary Lomotey, a trader
with  Renaissance Capital , by phone in Accra. “The bank usually
posts an increase in annual profit of between 20 and 25
percent,” he said.  Full-year net income rose 12 percent to 60.1 million cedis
($39.7 million), the company said in an advertisement published
in the Ghanaian Times newspaper yesterday.  Money made from fees and commissions fell to 43.7 million
cedis in 2010 from 44.2 million cedis a year earlier, which
shows “that overall business declined in the year,” Lomotey
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
