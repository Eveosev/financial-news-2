The  National Basketball Association 
extended the deadline for the  Sacramento Kings  to file a
relocation application until April 18.  The league’s Board of Governors approved extension of the
deadline, which typically is March 1 prior to the season before
a team is seeking to move, to allow the Maloof family, which
owns the Kings, to discuss its options with the board at its
April 14-15 meeting, the NBA said in a news release.  NBA Commissioner David Stern confirmed at a news conference
Feb. 19 during the All-Star break that the Kings have had
discussions to move the franchise to Anaheim, California.  The Kings have been unable to reach a plan with the city of
Sacramento and state of  California  about financing a new arena.  Sacramento  Mayor Kevin Johnson is a former point guard who
played 12 seasons in the NBA.  With a move to Anaheim, the Kings would play at the Honda
Center, which is home to the National Hockey League’s Anaheim
Ducks.  The Kings were scheduled to change its current arena name
to Power Balance Pavalion from the Arco Arena as of today,
though Power Balance LLC and the Kings are revisiting the
agreement terms because of talks between the franchise and
Anaheim officials, according to the  Sacramento Bee .  The Kings are 15-43 this season, 25 1/2 games behind the
Los Angeles Lakers in the Pacific Division.  To contact the reporter on this story:
