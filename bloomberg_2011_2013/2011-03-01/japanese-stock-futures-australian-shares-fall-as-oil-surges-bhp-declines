Japanese  stock futures  and
Australian shares fell after conflict in Libya escalated and  oil
prices  surged, sparking concern that higher fuel costs will
weigh on an economic recovery.  American depositary receipts of Toyota Motor Corp., the
world’s largest carmaker, retreated 1.1 percent from the closing
share price in Tokyo. Those of Sharp Corp., a maker of flat-
screen panels that gets almost half of its sales abroad,
declined 1.6 percent. Rio Tinto Ltd., the world’s third-largest
mining company, dropped 0.8 percent in Sydney today.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average expiring in
March closed at 10,640 in Chicago on March 4, compared with
10,700 in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at
10,630 in  Osaka  at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index dropped 0.4 percent today.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 0.1
percent today. The index slipped 0.7 percent on March 4 in  New
York  after fighting in Libya cut crude oil production in the
African country by as much as 1 million barrels a day, spurring
concern that there will be a slowdown in U.S. consumer spending,
which makes up about 70 percent of the world’s biggest economy.  Crude oil for April delivery increased 2.5 percent to
$104.42 a barrel in New York on March 4, the highest settlement
since Sept. 26, 2008. Fighting between Libyan rebels and troops
loyal to  Muammar Qaddafi  intensified yesterday as the opposition
advanced west from the oil hub of Ras Lanuf toward the leader’s
hometown of Sirte.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index increased 1.2 percent this year
through March 4, compared with gains of 5.1 percent by the  S&P
500  and 2.2 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark are valued at 14 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 13.7 times for the S&P 500 and 11.3 times
for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
