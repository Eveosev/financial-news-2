Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index fell
for a third day, dropping 0.5 percent to 4,803.20 at the 4:10
p.m. close of trading in Sydney. New Zealand’s  NZX 50 Index  slid
0.1 percent to 3,381.99 at the 5 p.m. close in Wellington.  The following were among the most active shares in the
market today. Stock symbols are in parentheses after company
names.  Australia:  Mining companies: Copper, zinc and lead declined for a
second day in London as oil traded above $100 a barrel, boosting
concern that inflation may accelerate and global growth slow.    BHP Billiton Ltd . (BHP AU), the world’s No. 1 mining
company, slid 0.7 percent to A$46.05. Rio Tinto Group (RIO AU),
which is vying to take control of Riversdale Mining with a A$3.9
billion ($3.95 billion) takeover offer, lost 0.7 percent to
A$84.12.  Riversdale (RIV AU) retreated 3.4 percent to A$14.97 amid
concern that Rio Tinto may not get full control after Tata Steel
Ltd. raised its stake in the smaller coal producer.  Mumbai-based Tata Steel, Riversdale’s biggest shareholder,
raised its stake to 27.1 percent from 24.2 percent. This comes
after Brazil’s Cia Siderurgica Nacional SA last month increased
its stake to 19.9 percent.  Gold producers: Gold traded near a record and silver
advanced to the highest level since 1980 as surging oil prices
boosted demand for the metals as haven investments and hedges
against inflation.    Newcrest Mining Ltd . (NCM AU), Australia’s biggest gold
producer, climbed 1.9 percent to A$38.41. Rival St. Barbara Ltd.
(SBM AU) rose 5.5 percent to A$2.13.        AMP Ltd . (AMP AU) fell 0.9 percent to A$5.30. Australia’s

employment, to which AMP has agreed, the company said in a
statement to the Australian stock exchange. AXA Asia Pacific’s
shares gained 1.3 percent to A$6.41.    Austar United Communications Ltd . (AUN AU) soared 11
percent to A$1.25, the biggest advance in more than two years,
after it said rival pay-television operator Foxtel is in talks
to buy the company from billionaire John Malone’s Liberty Global
Inc. The company did not elaborate on financial terms.  The Australian Financial Review reported Foxtel may offer
A$2 billion for Austar.    Boral Ltd . (BLD AU) dropped 2.6 percent to A$5.35 after

largest grocery wholesaler cut its annual earnings forecast amid
a slowdown in consumer spending and floods in two states.

5 percent in the 12 months ended April, compared with an earlier
forecast for growth of as much as 8 percent, it said.    Murchison Metals Ltd . (MMX AU) jumped 4.7 percent to A$1.45

nine months to decide whether to build a A$4.3 billion iron-ore

which he only joined in December. The company also appointed
James Warburton as chief executive officer after firing Grant Blackley last week. He will assume the role from July 14,
replacing acting CEO Lachlan Murdoch.  Warburton joins Ten Network from rival  Seven Group Holdings
Ltd . (SVW AU). Seven declined 2 percent to A$9 after rallying
3.7 percent the previous two days.  New Zealand:        Goodman Fielder Ltd . (GFF NZ) slid 1.8 percent to NZ$1.61
