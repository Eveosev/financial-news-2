  Persimmon Plc , the U.K.’s third-
largest homebuilder by volume, said 2010 profit rose 56 percent
as the company sold more homes at higher prices.  Net income climbed to 115.3 million pounds ($188 million)
from 74.1 million pounds a year ago, the York, England-based
company said today in a statement. Home completions rose 4.5
percent to 9,384 and the average selling price of Persimmon’s
homes rose 5.7 percent to 167,249 pounds.  U.K. house prices have fluctuated as a lack of supply
supports values while fading  consumer confidence , government
budget cuts and reduced lending crimps demand. Mortgage
approvals rose more than economists forecast in January,
providing evidence that the  property market  is stabilizing.  “It’s still a difficult market out there,” Chief
Executive Officer Mike Farley said in a telephone interview
today. “If you look at the first eight weeks, I would say that
we’re encouraged by the situation.”  Persimmon fell 5.8 pence, or 1.2 percent, to 464.6 pence at
10:15 a.m. in  London . The shares have risen almost 23 percent in
the past six months.  Underlying pretax profit, which excludes goodwill
impairments and exceptional items, increased to 95.5 million
pounds from 7 million pounds a year earlier as the company’s
profit margins widened.  “It reads well across the board,” said Kate Moy, an
analyst at Arbuthnot Securities Ltd. in London with a “buy”
rating on the stock. Moy had forecast underlying pretax profit
of 94 million pounds.  The underlying operating margin rose to 8.2 percent from 4
percent a year ago. In 2007, the margin was 21.8 percent.  “We will need a two- or three-year cycle to rebuild those
margins,” Farley said.  Net debt was 51 million pounds as of Dec. 31, a reduction
of 217 million pounds from a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
