The cost of oil imports for the
U.S., European Union and Japan may rise about 29 percent to $900
billion this year if crude prices average $100 a barrel,
according to estimates from the  International Energy Agency .  This would be almost $200 billion more than the U.S.,  Europe  and Japan might have to spend on crude imports this year,
“potentially threatening their economic recoveries,”  Fatih Birol , the Paris-based agency’s chief economist, said today in
an e-mail.  The U.S. may pay $385 billion for oil imports this year if
crude averages $100 a barrel, compared with $305 billion in
2010, the IEA estimated. Fuel shipments to the EU are projected
to cost $375 billion, versus $299 billion last year, it said.  The agency previously estimated oil import costs for its 28
member countries at $790 billion at the end of 2010, according
to a Jan. 5 statement on the IEA’s website.  The increase in import costs, “triggered by high  oil
prices , is equal to a loss of income of 0.5 percent of the OECD
countries’ combined gross domestic product,” the agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
