The U.S. government will reach its
$14.29 trillion legal debt limit between April 15 and May 31 if
Congress does not act, the Treasury Department said in a
statement today.    Mary Miller , the departmentâ€™s assistant secretary for
financial markets, said the Treasury would update its debt-limit
projection at the beginning of each month. In February, the
department projected the limit would be reached between April 5
and May 31.  To contact the reporters on this story:
