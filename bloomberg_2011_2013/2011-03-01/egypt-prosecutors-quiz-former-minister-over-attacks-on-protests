  Egypt ’s public prosecution officials
questioned former Interior Minister Habib El-Adly about attacks
on protestors during mass demonstrations that led to the ouster
of the country’s president.  Prosecutors heard El-Adly’s statements about the state of
lawlessness that terrorized many Egyptians during the unrest,
according to a release from the prosecutor’s office in Cairo
today. Witnesses, police officers and a number of those injured
in the confrontations were also questioned, it said.  El-Adly, who was arrested on Feb. 17, has been widely
blamed by protesters for his security forces’ use of brutality
against participants in the demonstrations. Grievances against
security bodies fueled the 18 days of protests that led to the
toppling of former President  Hosni Mubarak  last month.  The public prosecution office said in a separate statement
that it received complaints against Safwat el-Sherif, former
speaker of the upper house of parliament; Fathi Sorour, former
speaker of the lower house of parliament; and Zakaria Azmy,
former chief of the presidential staff. The public prosecutor
asked that the country’s public funds investigations unit, the
Central Auditing Agency and the Administrative Control Authority
investigate the complaints and forward their findings to his
office, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
