Togo  is setting up a special court
for the arbitration of business-related legal disputes in a bid
to attract local and foreign investment, said Commerce Minister
Kokou Gozan.  The court, which will start this month, will separate
investment cases from the country’s mainstream legal system “to
enable businessmen to settle very quickly contentious issues
related to business,” Gozan said in a phone interview yesterday.  The West African nation has undertaken reforms in an
attempt to lift economic growth, including cutting costs to
start a business and approving a new investment code that gives
tax breaks to companies that employ Togolese. In December, the  International Monetary Fund  said the country had become eligible
for as much as $1.8 billion in debt relief, or 82 percent of
total external money owed.  “After many years of political crisis, we need to attract
local and foreigners investors to develop our country,” Gozan
said.  Togolese President Faure Gnassingbe was elected to a second
term a year ago, promising to continue economic reforms that he
started when he came to power following the 2005 death of his
father, Gnassingbe Eyadema, who ruled for 38 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
