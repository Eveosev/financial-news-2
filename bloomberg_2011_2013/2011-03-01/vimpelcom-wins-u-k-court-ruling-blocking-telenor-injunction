  VimpelCom Ltd ., the Russian mobile-
phone operator seeking to combine assets with Naguib Sawiris’s
Weather Investments SpA, said a U.K. court denied a bid by rival  Telenor ASA  to block a shareholder meeting related to the deal.  The court in London today rejected Telenor’s request for an
order barring the planned March 17 gathering at which VimpelCom
will seek approval to issue about 630 million shares needed to
complete its combination with Weather Investments’ Wind Telecom
unit, Amsterdam-based VimpelCom said in a statement.  “VimpelCom believes strongly in the merits of this
transaction and is committed to continuing to act in the best
interests of all shareholders,” VimpelCom Chief Executive
Officer Alexander Izosimov said in the statement.  The opposition of Telenor, the Nordic region’s biggest
phone company, threatens the possible creation of the world’s
fifth-largest mobile-phone operator. VimpelCom,  Russia ’s No. 2
wireless company, and Egyptian billionaire Sawiris agreed in
October to merge their assets, including companies in Egypt and  Italy .  Telenor, owner of almost 40 percent of VimpelCom, said the
ruling included an agreement by VimpelCom, Weather and Altimo,
the telecommunications arm of Russia’s  Alfa Group , to “take all
necessary actions” to cause Telenor’s pre-emptive right shares
to be issued if an arbitration tribunal grants an award in
Telenor’s favor.  “Telenor is pleased with the court’s determination to
accept undertakings from VimpelCom, Altimo and Weather, which
stand in place of an injunction and which we believe will ensure
Telenor is able to enforce any arbitration award in its favor,”
Dag Melgaard, a spokesman for Fornebu, Norway-based Telenor,
said in a statement.  VimpelCom seeks shareholder approval to issue up to 325.6
million common shares and 305 million convertible preferred
shares, as well as an increase of the company’s share capital
needed to complete the deal, the company said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
