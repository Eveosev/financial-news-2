  HSBC Holdings Plc , Europe’s biggest
bank, has suspended U.S. foreclosures following a joint
examination by the  Federal Reserve  and the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency.  The regulators issued letters noting “certain
deficiencies” in the processing, preparation and signing of
affidavits and “other documents supporting foreclosures” at
HSBC Finance Corp. and  HSBC Bank USA , the London-based lender
said yesterday in its  annual report .  “We have suspended foreclosures until such time as we have
substantially addressed noted deficiencies in our processes,”
HSBC said in the report.  HSBC Bank USA Chief Executive Officer Irene Dorner said in
October that the bank reviewed its U.S. foreclosure process and
didn’t find evidence of so-called robo-signers, Reuters
reported. Robo-signers refers to bank employees who submit
hundreds or thousands of affidavits weekly to support
foreclosures without proper review.    Bank of America Corp . and  JPMorgan Chase & Co . were among
lenders that temporarily halted or delayed some repossessions to
review their foreclosure practices.  “We don’t think we have an issue with robo-signing,” Neil Brazil, an HSBC spokesman, said today in a telephone interview.
“As a result of internal and external review, we have taken the
decision to review all foreclosures where judgment has not yet
been entered and will be refiling affidavits where necessary.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
