  MBIA Inc ., the company that backed
some of Wall Street’s most toxic debt securities, settled $19
billion in guarantees with five financial institutions since
September, resolving the obligations with a one-time payment.  Its MBIA Insurance Corp. unit paid the firms to tear up
contracts insuring against losses on corporate, residential and
commercial-mortgage bonds and derivatives, the Armonk,  New York- 
based company said in a statement that didn’t disclose the
settlement amounts. The deals terminated guarantees on $15.7
billion of debt in the fourth quarter and $3.3 billion during
the first two months of 2011, the company said.  “Our insurance companies continue to have adequate
resources to meet all expected future claims obligations,” MBIA
President Chuck Chaplin said in the statement. “The
commutations and terminations of $15.7 billion of exposure in
the fourth quarter improved the balance sheet position of MBIA
Corp. and eliminated the volatility associated with the commuted
policies.”  Chief Executive Officer Jay Brown has settled $28 billion
of MBIA’s guarantees on mortgage-linked debt and other devalued
securities since 2008. The company is also seeking to compel
banks to buy back soured home loans.  The insurer was stripped of its AAA credit ratings in 2008
and shut out of the business of guaranteeing municipal bonds as
the housing market collapsed and debt markets froze.  Fourth-Quarter Profit  MBIA said fourth-quarter net income available to common
shareholders was $451 million, or $2.24 a share, compared with a
net loss of $240 million, or $1.16 a year earlier. The profit
hinged on a $1.1 billion pre-tax unrealized net gain on the fair
value of insured derivatives, a provision that reversed
previously recorded market value losses tied to the debt
contracts it settled in the fourth quarter.  Without that and other adjustments, MBIA would have
recorded a net loss of $311 million compared with a net loss of
$541 million for the same period in 2009.  The company increased its expected losses on debt tied to
commercial real estate by $604 million after a “modest”
deterioration in the performance of the securities and a change
in the way it models future performance.  MBIA dropped 50 cents, or 4.5 percent, to $10.55 a share as
of 5:21 p.m. in trading after the close of regular U.S. markets.  The cost to protect against a default by MBIA Insurance
Corp. jumped 3 percentage points to a mid-price of 41 percentage
points upfront, according to broker Phoenix Partners Group.
That’s in addition to 5 percentage points a year, meaning it
would cost $4.1 million initially and $500,000 annually for
credit-default swaps protecting $10 million of MBIA-backed debt
for five years.  (The company will hold a conference call tomorrow at 8 a.m.
