IMS Health Inc., the provider of
prescription data that was acquired by TPG Capital and Canada
Pension Plan Investment Board, is seeking to refinance $2
billion in loans it used to finance the takeover, according to a
person with knowledge of the deal.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is leading the refinancing, said
the person, who declined to be identified because the terms are
private. IMS Health planned to hold a lender call today at 10
a.m.  New York  time.  The acquisition was the biggest leveraged buyout of 2009,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. TPG and CPPIB agreed to
purchase Norwalk, Connecticut-based IMS Health in November 2009
for $5.2 billion.  A $1.25 billion term loan B portion of the financing
package was arranged Feb. 26, 2010, Bloomberg data show. The
interest rate on the loan was 3.5 percentage points more than
the London interbank offered rate, with a 1.75 percent minimum
on the lending benchmark.  The interest rate on a 550 million euro term loan B portion
was 3.75 percentage points over Euribor, with a 1.75 percent
floor on the benchmark, according to the data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
