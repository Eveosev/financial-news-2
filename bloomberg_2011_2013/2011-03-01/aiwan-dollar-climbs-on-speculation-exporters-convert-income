  Taiwan ’s dollar rose the most in a
month on speculation exporters took advantage of a decline last
week to repatriate overseas income at a more-favorable  exchange
rate .  The currency slid 1.2 percent in the five days ended Feb.
26, the most since May, as exchange data showed global funds
sold $1.1 billion more Taiwanese shares than they bought during
the period. Foreign investors bought a net $37.9 million of
local stocks today.  “Some exporters are selling the  U.S. dollar , and that
supported the Taiwan dollar,” said Tarsicio Tong, a Taipei-
based currency trader at the Union Bank of Taiwan. “It’s mainly
about trade-related transactions for the currency. Most
investors are still staying on the sidelines, waiting for more
signals.”  Taiwan’s dollar strengthened 0.3 percent to NT$29.660 from
Feb. 25 against its U.S. counterpart as of the 4 p.m. local time
close, according to Taipei Forex Inc. The advance was the
biggest since Feb. 1. Taiwan’s financial markets were closed for
a holiday yesterday.    Government bonds  fell for a fourth trading day. The yield
on the benchmark 10-year bond rose one basis point to 1.442
percent, according to Gretai Securities Market. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
