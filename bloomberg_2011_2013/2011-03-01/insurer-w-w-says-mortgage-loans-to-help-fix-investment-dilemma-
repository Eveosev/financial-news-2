  Wuestenrot & Wuerttembergische AG , a
German insurer and home lender, seeks to raise the share of  mortgage loans  among its investments as asset classes such as
bank debt or  government bonds  become less attractive.  “We consider it an advantage of our business mix that we
are actually able to offer insurance, mortgage loans and
mortgage bonds through our subsidiaries,” W&W Chief Executive
Officer Alexander Erdland said in an interview in Munich today.
“We don’t have to turn to structured products.”  The company, based in Stuttgart, has almost 10 percent of
its about 35 billion euros ($48 billion) in assets under
management in mortgage loans and considers increasing that to as
much as 15 percent, according to Erdland. W&W acquired home-loan
provider Allianz Dresdner Bauspar AG from Frankfurt-based
Commerzbank AG last year.  Insurers, which held about $23 trillion in assets globally
at the end of 2009, according to estimates by Swiss Reinsurance
Co., are facing pressure on their investment results as low  interest rates  hurt returns and planned new rules for the
industry in Europe make equity and real-estate investments less
attractive because of higher capital requirements.  Greater risk tied to bank and sovereign debt following the
financial crisis also adds to insurers’ “investment dilemma,”
Erdland said. “Plain capital returns for customers are going to
be lower in the future. As an industry we need to better
communicate to our customers that it’s our core value to provide
risk protection and reliable guarantees and that  life insurance 
is not just an investment product.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
