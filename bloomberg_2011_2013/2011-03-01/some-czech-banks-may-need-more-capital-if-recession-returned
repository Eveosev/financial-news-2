Several Czech banks would need a
capital injection if the economy unexpectedly returned to a
recession, though the banking industry as a whole would remain
stable, according to results of central bank stress tests.  The central bank tested banks under three scenarios,
including economic developments according to the bank’s own
forecast, an unexpected recession and an unexpected recession
preceded by payments of extraordinary bank dividends, the
Prague-based Ceska Narodni Banka said on its  website  today.  “Capital adequacy would stay above the regulatory limit
of 8 percent even in the very unfavorable stress scenario, which
assumes a sudden decline in domestic and foreign economic
activity in the second half of 2011,” the bank said in the
results of the tests.  The  Czech Republic  didn’t have to bail out any banks during
the global financial crisis as their exposure to toxic assets
accounted for less than 1 percent of all assets, banks had a
liquidity surplus and deposits exceeded loans, according to
central bank data.  In an unexpected recession, “several banks” would need a
capital injection worth a total 16 billion koruna ($909
million), or less than 0.5 percent of gross domestic product,
the central bank said.  In the most adverse scenario, the banks’ capital cushion
would weaken after the payment of extraordinary dividends and
more institutions would need an injection to reach the required
capital-adequacy ratio of 8 percent. In this case, the central
bank said, the total capital injection would need to be 28
billion koruna, or almost 0.8 percent of GDP.  The bank also said the share of non-performing corporate
loans held by the Czech banks will rise to peak at about 10
percent near the end of the 2011 in the basic economic scenario
based on its forecast, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
