U.K. stocks dropped for the eighth
time in nine days, led by basic-material shares, amid concern
that rising energy prices will curb the recovery in global
economic growth.    BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  and Rio Tinto Group paced a retreat among
mining companies, both falling more than 1.5 percent.  ITV Plc (ITV) 
rallied 4.7 percent, the largest gain in the Stoxx Europe 600
Index, after the U.K.’s biggest free-to-air commercial
broadcaster posted profit that almost tripled and declared its
first dividend to shareholders in several years.  The benchmark  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  declined 69.39, or 1.2
percent, to 5,866.37 at 8:41 a.m. in  London . The gauge has
slumped 3.6 percent from this year’s highest level on Feb. 8
amid concern that political unrest that began in Tunisia and  Egypt  will now spread from  Libya  to other Middle Eastern
countries, pushing  oil prices  higher and weakening the outlook
for economic growth. The  FTSE All-Share Index (ASX)  fell 1.2 percent
today and Ireland’s ISEQ Index dropped 1.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
