The value of the market for Polish
corporate, bank and municipal bonds rose 40 percent last year,
the most in a decade, as higher yields in emerging countries
boosted demand for debt in eastern  Europe ’s largest economy,
according to  Fitch Ratings .  The non-government  debt market  rose to 67.3 billion zloty
($23.5 billion) at the end of 2010 from 48 billion zloty a year
earlier. Growth was driven by a 57 percent increase in municipal
bonds and a 44 percent rise in corporate notes, according to the
Fitch report sent by e-mail today.  “The strong supply of high-yield bonds will continue,”
Miroslaw Dudzinski of the Fitch Polish unit wrote in the report.
“Volatility will not disappear from the markets” and banks and
companies “will remain favored issuers for investors.”  The expansion resulted from constraints in bank loans for
high-yield entities as well as yield chasing by investors,
Dudzinski said. Corporate loans in zloty fell 4.5 percent in the
12 months ended Sept. 30, according to the Polish financial
market regulator.  Companies’ bonds, which accounted for 26 percent of the
non-government notes market, rose to 17.6 billion zloty.  UniCredit SpA ’s  Bank Pekao SA  was the biggest corporate bond
arranger in 2010 for the third-consecutive year, while PKO Bank
Polski SA, its rival and Poland’s biggest lender, led in
municipal bonds management.  -- Editors: Douglas Lytle, Peter Branton  To contact the reporter on this story:
