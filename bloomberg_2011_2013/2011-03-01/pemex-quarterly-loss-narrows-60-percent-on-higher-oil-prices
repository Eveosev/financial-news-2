  Petroleos Mexicanos , Latin America’s
largest oil producer, said higher crude prices and lower costs
caused the company’s fourth-quarter loss to narrow 60 percent
from a year ago.  Pemex, as the company is known, lost 26.04 billion pesos
($2.15 billion), compared with a loss of 65.1 billion pesos in
the year-earlier period, the Mexico City-based company said
yesterday in a statement to Mexico’s stock exchange. It is the
state oil company’s third consecutive quarterly loss. Revenue
rose 10 percent to 343.1 billion pesos.  The Mexican crude export mix price climbed 10.8 percent to
average $77.70 a barrel in the quarter. Worldwide demand for
gasoline, diesel and jet fuel rose 3.5 percent during the last
three months of 2010, driven by economic expansion, the  International Energy Agency  said in a Jan. 18 report.  The increase in revenue “was partially offset by a higher
tax payment,” Pemex said in the statement.  Pemex operating income rose 88 percent to 132 billion pesos
on lower expenses, the company said, while total revenue from
exports rose 12.9 percent to 165.8 billion pesos. Sales of crude
and petrochemical products rose, while natural gas dropped 89.3
percent due to less availability, Pemex said.  Production dropped to 2.576 million barrels a day in 2010,
the lowest daily average since 1990, according to a report Jan.
26 on the company’s website. In 2009, crude output was 2.601
million barrels of oil a day.  Pemex may raise about $8 billion in bonds and loans during
2011, the company said. Most of the funds will be used to
refinance debt, Pemex said.  The company expects total debt to increase less than $1.5
billion this year, according to the report. Available cash and
cash from operations will enable the company to stay below the
$3.5-billion debt increase authorized by the state-owned
company’s board, Pemex said.  On Dec. 15, Carlos Trevino, then-chief financial officer of
Pemex, said the company may borrow as much as $10 billion in
2011 through bank loans or bond sales in domestic and
international markets.  Yesterday, Pemex posted a preliminary February output of
2.557 million barrels of oil a day, according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
