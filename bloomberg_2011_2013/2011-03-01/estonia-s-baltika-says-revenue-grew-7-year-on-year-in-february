AS Baltika, the third-largest Baltic
clothing company, said revenue rose 7 percent in February from a
year earlier, led by rising retail sales in Latvia and  Estonia .  Revenue rose to 3.3 million euros ($4.6 million) from 3.1
million a year ago, the Tallinn-based company said in a
regulatory statement today. Retail sales increased 21 percent in
Latvia and 15 percent in Estonia. Wholesale sales fell 7
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
