Egis Nyrt., the Hungarian drugmaker
owned by Laboratoires Servier, fell the most in three months on
speculation the government will announce extra levies on
pharmaceutical companies as part of its budget measures today.  Egis shares retreated 850 forint, or 4.2 percent to 19,730
forint by 9:43 a.m., the biggest drop since Nov. 29 and the
lowest intraday trading level since Dec. 17. Gedeon  Richter
Nyrt ., the country’s biggest drugmaker, retreated 1.8 percent to
37,305 forint.  Drugmakers’ earnings may be “substantially influenced” by
today’s budget announcements, Raiffeisen AG analysts including
Akos Herczenik in Budapest wrote in a research report today.
“As a first reaction, we are expecting a slump, especially in
the case of Egis.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
