Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  said financial markets will “take it in stride” when
the central bank ends its asset purchases aimed at stimulating
the economy.  “When we stop buying, whenever that may be, our previous
experience suggests that the market takes it in stride because
the market anticipates at some point that the purchases will
stop,” Bernanke said in response to questions at a Senate
Banking Committee hearing today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
