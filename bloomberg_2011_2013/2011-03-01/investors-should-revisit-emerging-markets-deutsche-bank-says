Private investors should consider
putting money back into emerging markets with strong exports
because they may benefit from a pick-up in U.S. economic growth,  Deutsche Bank AG  said.  “It could remain somewhat bumpy on the markets because of
inflation issues, discussions in Europe and possibly
developments in the Arab world,” Ulrich Stephan, global chief
investment officer for the retail banking unit, said in
Frankfurt today. “But it makes absolute sense to strategically
look at the topic and take first steps,” he said, naming
countries such as  China , India, Mexico and Turkey as examples.  The MSCI Emerging Markets Index of 811 companies has
declined about 3 percent this year as political unrest shook
countries such as Tunisia, Egypt and Libya. U.S. gross domestic
product increased 2.8 percent in 2010, the most in five years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
