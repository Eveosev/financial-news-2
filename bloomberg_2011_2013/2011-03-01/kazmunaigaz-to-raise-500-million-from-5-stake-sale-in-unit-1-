KazMunaiGaz National Co.,  Kazakhstan ’s state energy company, plans to raise $500 million
by selling a 5 percent stake in its London-traded unit to
citizens of the Central Asian country.  The sale of the stake in  KazMunaiGas Exploration Production 
will be followed by share offerings in state-owned  Kazakhstan
Electricity Grid Operating Co. ,  Kazpost  and railroad operator
Kazakhstan Temir Zholy, President Nursultan Nazarbayev said in a
statement dated yesterday on his website.  Metal producers Eurasian Natural Resources Corp.,  Kazakhmys
Plc , Glencore International AG’s Kazzinc and  ArcelorMittal ’s
Karmetcombinat will also sell shares to the public, Nazarbayev
said. The statement didn’t say when the shares will be sold.  Nazarbayev, 70, ordered state-owned companies last month to
sell shares to the public and urged foreign entities operating
in the country to do the same as he sought to remain in power.

scrapped a referendum on extending his 22-year rule when
protests had started against Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak .  Kazakh pension funds will be allowed to purchase shares
that aren’t bought by individual investors, Nazarbayev said.  State-owned KazMunaiGaz holds 61.4 percent of KazMunaiGas
Exploration’s ordinary shares, according to the Kazakhstan Stock
Exchange website.  The Kazakh government owns 11.65 percent of Eurasian
Natural, while Kazakhmys controls 26 percent, according to the
exchange  website . The nation holds 26 percent in Kazakhmys,
according to exchange  data .  To contact the reporter on this story:
