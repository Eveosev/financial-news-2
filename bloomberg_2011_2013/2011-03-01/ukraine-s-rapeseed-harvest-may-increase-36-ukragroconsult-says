Ukraine’s rapeseed harvest will
probably gain 36 percent in 2011 as winter damage is expected to
be lower than last year, UkrAgroConsult said.  The winter and spring rapeseed crops may total about 2
million metric tons, the Kiev-based researcher said late
yesterday in an e-mailed statement. Ukraine harvested 1.47
million tons of rapeseed in 2010, the state statistics office
said Jan. 18.  Winter rapeseed, planted on 1.08 million hectares (2.67
million acres) in 2010, will suffer losses to adverse weather of
10 to 15 percent at most, UkrAgroConsult said. The winter
rapeseed harvest will probably be between 1.8 million and 1.85
million tons, the researcher said.  Spring rapeseed may be planted on 150,000 hectares,
UkrAgroConsult said, adding that the optimal planting period is
from April 1 to April 20.  Ukraine exported 1.35 million tons of rapeseed from July
through January and total shipments by June 30 will be 1.43
million tons, according to UkrAgroConsult estimates. That would
be 400,000 tons less than in the previous marketing year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
