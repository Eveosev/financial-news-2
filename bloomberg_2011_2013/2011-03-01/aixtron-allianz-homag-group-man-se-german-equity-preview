turmoil in the Middle East pushed up the price of oil.    Deutsche Lufthansa AG  and  Air Berlin Plc , Germany’s biggest
airlines, declined amid concern fuel costs will increase.  E.ON

1 percent. Aixtron SE surged 3.6 percent after proposing to

optimism that the global economic recovery is gathering
strength. The broader HDAX Index declined 0.6 percent today.  Crude jumped as much as 1.9 percent to $98.77 a barrel in

demonstration today after leaders Mehdi Karrubi and Mir-Hossein Mousavi were transferred to a Tehran prison, according to the
opposition Kaleme website. Saudi Arabia’s benchmark stock index
