OAO Gazprom, Russia’s gas export
monopoly, may ship fuel from the Kovykta field to  China  after
buying the license to the eastern Siberian deposit from a unit
of TNK-BP at a bankruptcy auction.  Kovykta may serve as a “priority” resource base to supply
China, Energy Minister Sergei Shmatko told reporters today in
Moscow.  The unit, Rusia Petroleum, filed for bankruptcy after TNK-
BP, the Russian oil venture equally owned by  BP Plc (BP/)  and a group
of billionaires, demanded repayment for loans to develop the
field in May of last year amid threats from the government to
revoke the license over missed output targets. TNK-BP said the
local market couldn’t absorb the required volumes, while Gazprom
blocked plans to build a pipeline to  Asia .  Gazprom said last year it wouldn’t need Kovykta for either
exports or domestic use.  Gazprom offered 22.3 billion rubles ($780 million) for the
Rusia Petroleum assets, TNK-BP Chief Financial Officer  Jonathan Muir  said after the March 1 auction.  TNK-BP had agreed to sell its stake in Kovykta to Gazprom
in 2007 for $700 million to $900 million under a deal that
foundered amid disputes over the price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
