Cotton climbed to the highest price
since touching a record more than a week ago on renewed concern
that global supplies are failing to keep pace with demand from  China , the biggest consumer.  China imported 390,720 metric tons of cotton in January, 31
percent more than a year earlier, after an 86 percent increase
in 2010 to 2.84 million tons, the customs agency said Feb. 24.
The National Bureau of Statistics said yesterday that output
declined 6.3 percent to 5.97 million tons last year. Prices more
than doubled on ICE Futures U.S. during the past six months.  “China wants to import a whole lot of cotton,” said Louis Barbera, a broker at VIP Commodities in New York. “The lack of
cotton that we see will not change for the next few months.”  Cotton for May delivery advanced 2.37 cents, or 1.2 percent
to settle at $1.936 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. at 2:57 p.m. in  New York , after surging the exchange limit of 7 cents to
$1.9823. Prices, up 9.2 percent since Feb. 24, reached a record
$2.0893 on Feb. 18.  The fiber dropped 5.5 percent last week, the first weekly
loss in seven weeks and the biggest drop since November.
Cotton’s 34 percent rally since the end of December is the most
of the 19 commodities tracked by the Thomson Reuters/Jefferies
CRB Index.  “After last week’s drop, funds are returning to the market
where supplies are very tight,” said Toshimitsu Kawanabe, an
analyst at commodity broker Central Shoji Co.  India Outlook  India’s textile ministry reduced its production forecast by
5 percent because of low arrivals, the Business Standard
reported Feb. 27, citing A.B. Joshi, textile commissioner. The
country’s output in the 2010-2011 season may be 31.2 million
bales, each weighing 170 kilograms (375 pounds), down from the
previous estimate of 32.9 million bales, the Standard reported.  For the year that began Aug. 1, the U.S. will be the
world’s largest exporter, followed by  India , according to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture .  On the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange in China, cotton
futures for September delivery advanced 1.7 percent to close at
32,970 yuan ($5,018) a ton. The contract reached a record 34,870
yuan on Feb. 17.  To contact the reporters on this story:
