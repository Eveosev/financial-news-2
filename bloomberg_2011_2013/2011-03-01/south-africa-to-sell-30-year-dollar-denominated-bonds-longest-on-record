  South Africa  will sell 30-year bonds
in dollars, the longest-dated debt it has offered on
international markets, a person familiar with the offering said.  The bond may price today at a yield about 190 basis points,
or 1.9 percentage points, more than the equivalent  U.S.
Treasuries , said the person, who declined to be identified
because the terms haven’t been set.  Citigroup Inc . and Deutsche
Bank AG are managing the sale, the person said.  The National Treasury on Feb. 23 said it will sell about $1
billion of foreign bonds each year for the next three. It also
raised its forecast for domestic loans for 2011-12 to help fund
a higher-than-expected budget deficit of 5.3 percent for the
year through March 2012, compared with an estimate in October of
4.6 percent.  The nation will join other emerging markets such as
Ukraine, Mexico and  Nigeria  in selling bonds in dollars this
year. South  Africa  last sold an international bond in March
2010, when it raised $2 billion of debt due in March 2020. The
bond yielded 4.79 percent at 5:19 p.m. in Johannesburg, down
from 5.17 percent on Feb. 8, the highest since July.  South Africa in October scrapped plans to issue further
foreign-currency bonds in the year through March 2011 as part of
attempts to weaken the rand, which strengthened 11 percent
against the dollar last year. That made it the best performer
among more than 20 emerging-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg after Malaysia’s ringgit.  Debt Rating  Debt of Africa’s biggest economy is rated BBB+ by Standard
& Poor’s, the third-lowest investment grade and the same level
as Thailand’s.  Thailand ’s only dollar-denominated international
bond, which matures in August 2013, yielded 2.26 percent. A
dollar-denominated bond due in 2035 sold by  Poland , rated one
level above South Africa at A- by  Standard & Poor’s , yielded
100 basis points above the equivalent U.S. Treasury bonds,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  South Africa’s dollar-denominated debt has lost 0.5 percent
this year, in line with the 0.4 percent loss on the JPMorgan
Chase & Co. EMBI+ emerging-markets bond index.  Treasury spokesman Jabulani Sikhakhane said he could not
immediately comment on any sale when contacted by Bloomberg News
by phone today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
