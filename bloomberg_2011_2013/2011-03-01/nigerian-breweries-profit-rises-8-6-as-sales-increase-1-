  Nigerian Breweries Plc , the
country’s biggest brewer by market value, said profit for the
year through December increased 8.6 percent to 30.3 billion
naira ($197.5 million) as sales rose.  Revenue climbed to 185.86 billion naira from 164.21 billion
naira a year earlier, the Lagos-based company said in an e-
mailed statement today.  “Improvement in supply of products and the benefits from
increased investment in our brands resulted in volume and
revenue growth,” the company said.  The results “were broadly in line with our expectations,”
Vetiva Capital Management Limited said in a note to clients.  Nigerian Breweries proposed a final dividend of 1.25 naira
per share, the company said. With an interim dividend of 1.15
naira paid earlier, this brought the total per share dividend to
2.40 naira, implying a dividend yield of 3 percent that is
“below market and analysts’ expectations,” according to
Vetiva.  The brewer’s rating at Vetiva is “under review,” the note
said. The stock has lost 1 percent this year, compared with a
4.4 percent gain in the Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share Index
over the same period. Its shares were unchanged at 76.30 naira
today.  -- Editors:  Emily Bowers , Karl Maier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
