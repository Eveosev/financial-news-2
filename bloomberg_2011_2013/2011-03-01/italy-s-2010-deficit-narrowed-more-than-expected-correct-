(Corrects original 2009 GDP in last paragraph.)    Italy ’s budget deficit fell more
than economists forecast last year and public debt as a
percentage of gross domestic product rose to the highest on
record as the economy recovered from a recession.  The shortfall declined to 4.6 percent of GDP compared with
a revised 5.4 percent in 2009, Rome-based national statistics
office  Istat  said today. That was lower than the 5 percent
median forecast of 7 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. Debt
rose to 119 percent, while GDP advanced 1.3 percent on an annual
basis after contracting a revised 5.2 percent in 2009.  Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi ’s government last year
passed 11.6 billion euros ($16 billion) of budget cuts as
Italy’s economy recovered from its worst recession since World
War II. Lawmakers approved the same level of cuts for 2012 to
reduce the deficit below 3 percent of GDP.  Italy may miss its goal of reducing the deficit to below 3
percent if growth proves weaker than the government’s projected
1.3 percent in 2011, the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development said in a report on Nov. 18.  The 2009 deficit figure was revised from a previous reading
of 5.3 percent. The 2009 GDP reading was previously reported as
a contraction of 5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
