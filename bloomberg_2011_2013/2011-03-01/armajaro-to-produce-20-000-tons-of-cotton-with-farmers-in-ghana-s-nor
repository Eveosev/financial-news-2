Armajaro Holdings Ltd.’s unit in  Ghana  will invest at least $10 million to produce cotton amid
plans to use the fiber crop to boost development in the West
African nation’s arid north.  Armajaro Ghana Ltd., the fourth-biggest purchaser of  cocoa
beans  from Ghanaian farmers, will cultivate half-hectare farms
in the central part of the  Northern region  to produce 20,000
metric tons of cotton each year, said Nelson Kpodo-Tay, director
of operations with the Kumasi-based company, by phone today.  “Armajaro will be providing management, inputs and
technical support,” he said. “It will also be in charge of
marketing the produce.”  Ghana is the world’s second-largest cocoa producer, which
is grown mostly in the central part of the country. The northern
half has a dry, Sahelian climate and borders Burkina Faso, sub-
Saharan Africa’s largest cotton producer. Ghana will produce
5,000 tons of cotton in 2010-11, according to the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture .  Burkina Faso ’s output is projected at
185,000 tons.  Ghanaian Vice President John Mahama will start the Armajaro
project on March 5, Kpodo-Tay said. The country has the capacity
to produce 250,000 tons of lint cotton and give employment to
500,000 farmers, the state-owned Ghana News Agency reported on
Feb. 27, citing Agriculture Minister Kwesi Ahwoi.  Cotton for May delivery climbed for a third day, reaching
the daily limit on the ICE Futures exchange in  New York . It
traded $7, or 3.7 percent, higher to $1.9823 a pound.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
