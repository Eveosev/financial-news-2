Cash premiums for corn and soybeans
shipped this month to terminals near  New Orleans  widened
relative to Chicago futures as farmers withheld inventories
amid rising prices and as demand rose.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for corn delivered in
March at  Gulf of Mexico  ports rose to 52 cents to 53 cents a
bushel above May futures from 51 cents to 52 cents yesterday,
U.S. Department of Agriculture  data  show. The soybean basis for
delivery in the first half of this month rose to 66 cents to 68
cents a bushel above March futures from 63 cent to 70 cents.  “Farmers are just not selling because they are waiting
for higher prices,” said Garret Toay, a grain analyst at Toay
Commodity Futures Group LLC in Clive,  Iowa . “Basis will rise
the next month to get farmers and grain elevators to sell.”  Corn futures for May delivery rose 4.5 cents, or 0.6
percent, to close at $7.355 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade, after falling as much as 0.8 percent.
The most-active futures gained 30 percent in the past three
months, touching $7.4425 on Feb. 22, the highest since July
2008.  Soybean futures for March delivery rose 10.25 cents, or
0.8 percent, to close at $13.675 a bushel in Chicago. On Feb.
9, the price reached $14.5575, the highest since trading in the
contract began in October 2008.  U.S. corn stockpiles on Aug. 31 will total 675 million
bushels, down 60 percent from a year earlier and down from a
January forecast of 745 million, the USDA said on Feb. 9. That
represents 5 percent of projected annual usage and would equal
a record low in 1995. Soybean reserves will fall to 4.2 percent
of estimated demand before this year’s harvest, the USDA said.  “As we work down supplies, it is getting more difficult
to buy corn and soybeans,” Toay said. “Farmers may be down to
25 percent of last year’s crop left to sell, and soybean
supplies are down to gambling stocks.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
