German 10-year bond yields reached
the highest in a week before a report forecast to show euro-area
inflation stayed above the  European Central Bank â€™s 2 percent
ceiling for a third month in February.  The two-year yield was within six basis points of an 18-
month high. Inflation in the 17-nation bloc quickened to 2.4
percent in February, from 2.3 percent the month earlier,
according to the median forecast of 31 economists in a Bloomberg
survey. The Netherlands plans to sell at least 5 billion euros
of 2021 bonds, while  Austria  will auction securities maturing in
2015 and 2022. Belgium and Malta will sell bills.  German 10-year yields were one basis point higher at 3.18
percent as of 7:39 a.m. in  London . The 2.5 percent security due
January 2021 fell 0.05, or 50 euro cents per 1,000-euro ($1,379)
face amount, to 94.345. Two-year yields also climbed one basis
point, to 1.53 percent.  German  government bonds  handed investors a loss of 1.3
percent this year, compared with 0.1 percent for U.S. Treasuries
and 1.2 percent for U.K. gilts, according to indexes compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies.  The German  unemployment rate  remained at an 18-year low of
7.4 percent in February, according to the median estimate of 28
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The report is due for
publication at 8:55 a.m. London time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
