  Kenya ’s shilling weakened for the
third day and headed for the weakest level in 17 years against
the dollar amid increased demand for the U.S. currency by oil
importers in the nation.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy depreciated
0.2 percent 82.70 per dollar by 1:05 p.m. in Nairobi from a
close of 82.50 yesterday. A close at this level would be the
lowest since March 1994.  Oil advanced from the lowest in a week as demonstrations
planned in Iran stoked concern the turmoil that cut Libya’s
crude output may disrupt supplies from the Middle East. Crude
for April delivery rose as much 0.6 percent to $97.59 a barrel
in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  “The high demand by oil importers due to rising global  oil
prices  is piling pressure on the local unit and with low
inflows, all fundamentals point to a weaker shilling in the
coming days,” Steve Lagat, a trader at Nairobi-based CFC
Stanbic Bank Ltd., said in a phone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
