The Australian dollar extended
earlier gains after government reports showed that retail
spending climbed faster than economists estimated and the
fourth-quarter current-account deficit was wider than expected.  The currency was at $1.0195 as of 11:35 a.m. in Sydney from
$1.0180 before the data and $1.0186 yesterday in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
