Markit Group Ltd. , the financial
information company that produces bond indexes, said Richard Paddle is leaving as managing director and head of European
structured finance after 1 1/2 years.  Paddle’s team will now be managed by New York-based
Director Nathan Kirk, spokesman Michael Gormley said in an e-
mailed response to questions.  Paddle said that he left today in “a mutual departure”
that’s because he wants “to get back to portfolio management
and trading.” He joined the company’s London headquarters in
2009 from the treasury department of Bank of Scotland Plc, now
part of  Lloyds Banking Group Plc , Markit said when it hired him.  To contact the reporter on this story:
