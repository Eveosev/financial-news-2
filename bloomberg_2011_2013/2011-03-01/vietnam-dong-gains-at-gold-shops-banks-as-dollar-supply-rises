  Vietnam â€™s dong strengthened at banks
and money changers after the central bank said dollar supply
increased following an order for companies to sell more of the
U.S. currency back to lenders.  The dong also rose in official trading after the  State Bank 
of Vietnam set the daily reference rate higher at 20,668,
compared with 20,673 yesterday, according to its website. The
currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of
that rate.  The dong advanced in the unofficial market, trading between
21,620 and 21,720 as of 4:30 p.m. at gold shops in Hanoi,
compared with between 21,900 and 21,960 yesterday, according to
an information service run by state-owned Vietnam Posts &
Telecommunications. The official rate gained 0.02 percent to
20,873, according to prices from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The government ordered state-owned firms to sell dollars,
central bank Governor Nguyen Van Giau told reporters in Hanoi
today.  The yield on the benchmark five-year bond was unchanged at
11.55 percent, according to a daily fixing from banks compiled
by Bloomberg.  --Diep Ngoc Pham, with reporting by Uyen Nguyen in  Hanoi .
