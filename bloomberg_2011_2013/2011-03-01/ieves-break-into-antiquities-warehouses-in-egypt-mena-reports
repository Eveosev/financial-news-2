A gang looted two antiquities
warehouses south of the pyramids area in  Egypt , the Middle East
News Agency reported, citing Minister of State for Antiquities  Zahi Hawass .  Gang members tied up and threatened to kill six guards and
a policeman in the area, the Cairo-based news agency said,
citing an antiquities ministry statement. The ministry is
waiting for prosecutors to inspect the scene and has yet to take
an inventory of the items remaining in the warehouses, MENA
said, citing antiquities official Ali al-Asfar.  A number of armed robberies on ancient tombs and warehouses
in different parts of the country have occurred in the past
three weeks, the agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
