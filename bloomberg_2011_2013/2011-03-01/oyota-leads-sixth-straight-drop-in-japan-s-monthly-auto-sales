  Toyota Motor Corp . and Honda Motor
Co. led the sixth straight drop in the nation’s monthly auto
sales after a government subsidy program ended.  Sales of cars, trucks and buses, excluding minicars, fell
14 percent from a year earlier to 252,634 vehicles in February,
the  Japan Automobile Dealers Association  said in a statement
today. Toyota, Japan’s biggest automaker, sold 115,000 units,
excluding Lexus-brand cars, down 21 percent.  Industrywide sales in 2010 rose 11 percent to 3.23 million
vehicles as government incentives boosted demand for fuel-
efficient models. In February, deliveries at Nissan Motor Co.
fell 8 percent to 44,212 vehicles, while sales at Honda, Japan’s
third-largest automaker, dropped 16 percent to 34,387 units.  Auto sales in Japan may drop 13 percent to 2.8 million
vehicles this year, after a government subsidy for fuel-
efficient cars ended Sept. 8, the dealers association said
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
