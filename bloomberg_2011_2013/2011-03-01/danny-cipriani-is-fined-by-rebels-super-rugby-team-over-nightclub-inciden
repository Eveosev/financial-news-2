Melbourne Rebels fly-half Danny
Cipriani was fined one match payment over a nightclub incident
and will be suspended by the Super Rugby newcomer if he
transgresses again.  Cipriani, 23, was asked to leave a Melbourne nightclub
after allegedly helping himself to a bottle of vodka following
the team’s opening-round loss to the New South Wales Waratahs on
Feb. 18, newspapers including the Age reported.  “While the incident was not deemed to be a major
infraction, the club believes that Danny’s actions were in
breach of the expected behaviors of our players,” Rebels Chief
Executive Officer Ross Oakley said in an e-mailed statement.  Cipriani, the first  England  international to play for an
Australian team in southern hemisphere rugby’s elite provincial
competition, said he regretted that the incident had detracted
from the Rebels’ Super Rugby win over the ACT Brumbies four days
ago, when he kicked 20 of the team’s 25 points.  “I have apologized for my actions and I regret any
embarrassment my behavior has caused,” he said in the statement
after fronting the Rebels’ player standards group. “As my
behavior was not in line with our pledge, if anything else
happens along these lines again, I have agreed with the players
that I will stand down for an appropriate period of time.”  Cipriani, who has played seven times for England, joined
the Rebels for their inaugural season after seven years with  London Wasps .  The Rebels travel to  New Zealand  to face the winless Chiefs
on March 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
