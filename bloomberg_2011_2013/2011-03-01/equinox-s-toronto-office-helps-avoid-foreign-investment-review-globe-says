  Equinox Minerals Ltd ., which makes
most of its corporate decisions in Perth, Australia, may avoid a
foreign investment review by the Canadian government because
it’s based in Toronto, the Globe and Mail reported.  Equinox, which incorporated in Canada in 2004, offered this
week to buy Toronto-based  Lundin Mining Corp . for C$4.8 billion
($4.9 billion).  Equinox’s legal advisers say the bid won’t fall under the
Investment Canada Act, in which the Canadian government reviews
any bid worth more than C$300 million by a foreign investor, the
 newspaper  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
