TNK-BP, the Russian oil venture half
owned by  BP Plc , can raise the financing it may need to replace
the U.K. explorer in an alliance with state-run OAO Rosneft,
said Chief Financial Officer  Jonathan Muir .  “At the moment we are confident of our balance sheet, that
we would be able to raise the funds required,” Muir told
reporters in Moscow today.  TNK-BP management recommended the venture pursue BP’s plans
to form an exploration venture in  Russia ’s Arctic waters and
swap $7.8 billion of shares with Rosneft, the country’s largest
oil producer. The venture’s board is scheduled to meet on March
4 in Berlin to discuss the proposal.  AAR, which represents BP’s billionaire partners, has
temporarily blocked the BP-Rosneft deal, saying it violated
exclusivity provisions in the TNK-BP shareholders’ agreement.  TNK-BP may seek loans from banks as it refinances $500
million of bonds this year, Muir said. Barring acquisitions,
borrowing may be limited, he said.  “Our preference, on a steady state basis, will be to do
bank debt not bonds, simply because we have a good portfolio of
bonds right now,” Muir said. “We’re probably more limited on
bank debt.”  Net debt declined to $4.68 billion at the end of 2010, from
$5.97 billion at the end of the previous year, TNK-BP said today
in fourth-quarter financial statements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
