  Ecopetrol SA , Colombia’s largest oil
company, said a rally in crude prices and rising output pushed
fourth-quarter profit 57 percent higher.  Net income rose to 2.70 trillion pesos ($1.41 billion) from
1.72 trillion pesos a year earlier, the state-controlled company
said yesterday in a statement. Revenue increased 30 percent to
11.6 trillion pesos. Output rose 13 percent to 649,100 barrels a
day.  Bogota-based Ecopetrol is spearheading oil production
increases in Colombia, where billionaire  Carlos Slim ’s Grupo
Carso SAB and  Eike Batista ’s OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA
also plan investments. Ecopetrol said last year it will spend
more than $80 billion through 2020 to drill more wells and
expand exploration to double output to 1.3 million barrels.  “If they want to double production, they need more
reserves,” Daniel Munoz, an analyst at Bogota-based brokerage
Cia. de Profesionales de Bolsa, said in a telephone interview
yesterday before the results were released. “Production is
rising quickly.”  The brokerage has a “hold” rating on Ecopetrol.  Ecopetrol rose 10 pesos, or 0.3 percent, to 3,965 pesos
yesterday. The stock has declined 3.3 percent this year.  Colombia ’s benchmark Colcap index has dropped 2.9 percent in the
same period. The earnings report was released after the close of
regular trading.  The company said yesterday it expects a new pipeline,
called the Bicentennial, to add 120,000 barrels per day of
transport capacity this year as the nation boosts production.  Ecopetrol Acquisitions  Ecopetrol is expanding its production through exploration
and acquisitions. The company and Talisman Energy Inc. completed
an acquisition of a 51 percent stake in assets from a unit of BP
Plc for $1.75 billion in January. In 2009, Ecopetrol bought
Hocol Petroleum Ltd. for $742 million from Etablissements Maurel
& Prom SA to boost production.  Ecopetrol aims to increase output to 1 million barrels a
day by 2015.  Military strikes under President  Juan Manuel Santos  and his
predecessor,  Alvaro Uribe , have weakened guerrilla groups and
spurred investment in  oil wells , gold exploration and coal
mines. Foreign direct investment has doubled to $6.5 billion
through the third quarter of 2010 from $3 billion in all of
2009, according to central bank figures. In September, Santos
said an armed-forces strike killed rebel military leader  Mono Jojoy .  Record Oil Price  Slim said he sought to invest in Colombia’s oil sector
because of the Andean nation’s open policies on exploration.
Grupo Carso announced Feb. 22 it will buy a 70 percent stake in
Geoprocesados SA’s Tabasco Oil Co.  Tabasco won rights last year to explore and produce oil
from a block in eastern Colombia in an area where Ecopetrol also
plans to expand its search for crude and already operates wells.  Oil in New York reached $103.41 a barrel on Feb. 24, the
highest since Sept. 2008, as supplies declined from  Libya  amid
unrest. Crude for April delivery was at $96.89 a barrel, down 2
cents, in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 12:31 p.m. Sydney time. The commodity has rallied 17 percent
in 12 months.  Rising Ecopetrol output has made Colombia the third-largest
crude producer in  South America , behind Venezuela and  Brazil .
Colombia produced a total of 839,000 barrels a day in January.  In all of 2010, Ecopetrol’s average production was 615,900
barrels per day. The company has increased output of oil and
natural gas from an average of 520,600 barrels a day in 2009,
according to annual reports.  Colombia’s government said Jan. 12 it plans to raise as
much as much as 10 trillion pesos by selling as much as 7
percent of Ecopetrol, less than a previously planned sale of up
to 10 percent. The government may sell 2 percent this year and
an additional 5 percent later, Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
