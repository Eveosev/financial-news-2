The New York Mets hired  JPMorgan
Chase & Co . to put together a loan to cover “basic operating
expenses” until the baseball team can sell a minority stake,
the New York Post reported, citing an unidentified person.   JPMorgan is trying to recruit a syndicate of lenders for
the new loan “totaling tens of millions of dollars,” the
newspaper said. The bank led a group that loaned the team about
$430 million last year, it added.    Jennifer Zuccarelli , a spokeswoman for the bank, said
JPMorgan is not in discussions to syndicate a new loan for the
team.  David Howard , executive vice president for business
operations, declined to comment.  The team last week said it received a short-term loan from  Major League Baseball , without revealing the amount. Mets
Chairman Fred Wilpon said Jan. 28 that team owners were
considering selling a minority stake of up to 25 percent because
of a lawsuit tied to the Ponzi scheme run by Bernard L. Madoff.  The Mets are valued at $858 million, third-highest among
baseball’s 30 teams, Forbes magazine said last April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
