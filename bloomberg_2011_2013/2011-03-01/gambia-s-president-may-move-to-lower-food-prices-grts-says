Gambia’s President Yahya Jammeh may
move to lower prices of food in the West African nation, state-
owned Gambia Radio and Television Services cited the leader as
saying.  Jammeh told importers of basic commodities at a meeting in
Banjul, the capital, yesterday to bring down the costs,
according to the broadcaster. Finance Minister Mamburay Njie
blamed what he described as cartels for the high prices, GRTS
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
