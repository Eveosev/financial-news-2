  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd .,
the world’s largest maker of generic drugs, opened a $100
million distribution center in Shoham, Israel, saying it
expected to expand.  “We have built here a center that takes into account how
Teva will grow over the next 10 years and even beyond that,”
Chief Executive Officer Shlomo Yanai said at a ceremony to mark
the facility’s opening.  The center, located just south of the company’s
headquarters in Petah Tikva outside  Tel Aviv , is built over an
area of 77,000 square meters, making it the biggest warehouse in
Israel. Teva reported a profit of $3.3 billion in 2010, on sales
of $16.1 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
