  South Africa ’s purchasing managers’
index rose to a 10-month high in February, spurred by a decline
in the jobless rate and tempered by rising input costs for
manufacturers,  Kagiso Securities Ltd.  said.  The seasonally adjusted index advanced to 54.8 from 54.6 in
January, Johannesburg-based Kagiso said in an e-mailed statement
today. The PMI has been above 50, which indicates an expansion
in factory production, for four consecutive months.  “The most heartening trend” is an increase in the PMI
employment index “indicating that the factory sector may have
started employing again,” Kagiso consultant Theo Vorster said
in the statement.  South Africa’s jobless rate, the highest of 61 countries
tracked by Bloomberg, fell to 24 percent in the fourth quarter
from 25.3 percent in the previous three months as the government
hired more workers and manufacturing recovered. The sub-index
measuring employment increased by 3.8 points to 51.6 in
February, after nine months below the 50 mark, Kagiso said.  The index for the cost of inputs for manufacturing climbed
10.4 points to 81.7 last month, its highest level since 2008,
Kagiso said.  The outlook by business managers “was somewhat less
optimistic regarding the outlook for future business
conditions,” it said.  The  Bureau for Economic Research , based at the University
of Stellenbosch near  Cape Town , and the Institute of Purchasing
and Supply South Africa conduct the PMI survey on behalf of
Kagiso.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Franz Wild  in Johannesburg at
