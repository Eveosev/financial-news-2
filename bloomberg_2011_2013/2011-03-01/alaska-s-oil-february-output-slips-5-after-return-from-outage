Alaskan crude-oil production slipped
5.3 percent in February from last year after returning from a
shutdown of the Trans Alaska Pipeline that curbed output.  “We don’t anticipate any work that would cause an impact
to throughput” on the pipeline,  Michelle Egan , spokeswoman for
Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., the pipeline operator, said in an
e-mail. The line was shut Jan. 8 and started Jan. 17. Operations
have returned to normal, she said.  Production in February averaged 645,165 barrels a day, a
decline from 681,041 last year, according to the  Alaska Tax
Division . Output increased 34 percent from the previous month.  Oil inventories in the state finished the month at 2.9
million barrels, after dropping as low as 418,546 barrels,
according to the tax division.  The 800-mile (1,287-kilometer) system that runs from  Prudhoe Bay  on the North Slope to Valdez, the northernmost ice-
free port in the U.S, was started after a bypass was installed
around a leak at Pump Station 1.  Alaska production has declined every year since 2002, U.S.
Energy Department  figures  show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
