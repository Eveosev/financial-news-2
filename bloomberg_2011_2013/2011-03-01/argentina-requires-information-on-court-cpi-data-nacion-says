The Argentine government is
demanding that economic research companies provide them with
information on what inflation data they provide to judges,
newspaper La Nacion  said .  Judges frequently ask researchers to provide inflation data
for use in rulings on issues such as alimony payments because
the national statistics office underreports price increases, the
Buenos Aires-based newspaper said.  Earlier this year the government started to fine
researchers that didnâ€™t disclose how they collect inflation
data, the daily said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
