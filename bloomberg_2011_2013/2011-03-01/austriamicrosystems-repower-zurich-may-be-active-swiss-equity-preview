Swiss stocks declined, snapping a
three-day advance for the  Swiss Market Index (SMI) , amid concern that
rising energy costs will hurt economic growth.    SGS SA (SGSN) , the world’s largest sales inspection company, and  Swatch Group AG (UHR) , the largest watchmaker, slid.  Swiss Life
Holding AG (SLHN)  tumbled 3.3 percent as operating profit missed
estimates.  The benchmark SMI of the biggest and most actively traded
companies slid 0.4 percent to 6,592.07 in Zurich, paring its
rally this year to 2.4 percent. The broader Swiss Performance
Index decreased 0.7 percent to 5,923.29.  Oil in  New York  climbed above $100 a barrel for a second
day on concern that the unrest curbing exports from  Libya  will
spread to other countries in the region.    Saudi Arabia ’s benchmark stock index fell for a thirteenth
straight day, the longest losing streak since 1998, on concern
disturbances may extend to the kingdom, the biggest supplier in
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. In Libya,
rebels braced for renewed clashes with forces loyal to leader  Muammar Qaddafi .  “All that is happening now is worrying the market because
of the idea of energy prices and geopolitical instability,”
said Pierre Mouton, a  fund manager  at Notz Stucki & Cie. in
Geneva, who helps oversee $7 billion. “People tend to forget
that the market rose a lot until mid-February.”  SGS retreated 1.4 percent to 1,607 francs. Swatch slipped
0.9 percent to 396 francs.  Transocean Ltd. (RIG) , the world’s largest
offshore oil driller, declined 0.6 percent to 77.95 francs.  Swiss Reinsurance Co. sank 1.9 percent to 55.5 francs. The
world’s second-largest reinsurer estimated its claims cost from
the earthquake in  New Zealand  to be about $800 million.  Swiss Life,  Switzerland ’s biggest life insurer, tumbled 3.3
percent to 147.3 francs. Profit from operations rose 23 percent
to 694 million Swiss francs ($749 million) last year, the
Zurich-based company said today in a statement. That missed the
797 million-franc average estimate of six analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
