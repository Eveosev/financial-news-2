Brazilian President  Dilma Rousseff 
plans to hand out an extra 2.1 billion reais ($1.26 billion) to  Brazil ’s poorest families through the government’s “Bolsa
Familia” welfare program.  The Bolsa Familia shows “our commitment to the sector of
the Brazilian population that was always abandoned,” Rousseff
said today in an event in Irece, a city in the northeastern
state of Bahia.  The government will increase by as much as 45 percent its
cash payments to families with children younger than 15 years
old, the government said in an e-mailed statement. The average
benefit to poor families will increase to 115 reais from 96
reais.  The announcement of the increase comes a day after the
government detailed plans to slash 50.1 billion reais from this
year’s budget by reducing subsidies to the national  development
bank , trimming its housing program and postponing the purchase
of 36 fighter jets. The cuts aim at slowing economic growth and
reining in inflation, which is at a 26-month high.  The central bank, which said it was counting on increased
public savings to contain inflation this year, will raise  interest rates  for a second straight meeting tomorrow, the
futures market shows. Traders are wagering policy makers, after
lifting the Selic by half a point to 11.25 percent in March,
will push the rate to 11.75 percent.  The “Bolsa Familia” program pays monthly benefits to 12.9
million families, according to an e-mailed statement sent by the
Social Development Ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
