  Weatherford International Ltd . call
options were among the most-traded on U.S. exchanges after the
first  Gulf of Mexico  deep-water drilling permit was issued since
the Deepwater Horizon incident.  A block of 33,500 August $27 calls and the same number of
January $30 calls were traded at 11:31 a.m., data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The August $27 calls were exchanged for $1.37
each, and the January $30 calls for $1.42 apiece.  More than 76,200 calls to buy the stock of the provider of
drilling equipment and services changed hands today, a one-year
high. Volume was more than seven times the four-week average and
23 times the number of puts to sell. The August $27 calls and
January $30 calls together accounted for almost nine-tenths of
all call trades. Geneva-based Weatherford dropped 2.7 percent to
$23.52.  Weatherford advanced 42 percent in the past year, beating
the 36 percent increase for the Russell 1000 Energy Index. The
company’s implied volatility, the key gauge of option prices,
for at-the-money options expiring in 30 days rose to 39.11 from
37.37 yesterday.    Noble Energy Inc . of Houston yesterday won the first permit
for renewed deep-water drilling in the Gulf of  Mexico  since
London-based  BP Plc ’s Macondo well blowout 10 months ago that
caused the biggest U.S. offshore oil spill. More permits will be
approved in “coming weeks or months,” the department office in
charge of drilling said in a statement yesterday.  Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the
right to sell. Investors use options to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities they own, speculate on
share-price moves or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will
rise or fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
