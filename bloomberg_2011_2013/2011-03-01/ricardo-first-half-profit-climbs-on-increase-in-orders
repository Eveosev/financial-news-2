  Ricardo Plc , a U.K. developer of
fuel-efficient engines for automakers, said first-half profit
rose 53 percent after it won more orders, including a contract
with the U.K.’s Ministry of Defence.  Net income in the six months to Dec. 31 rose to 4.6 million
pounds ($7.5 million), or 9.3 pence a share, from 3 million
pounds, or 6.2 pence a share a year earlier, the West Sussex,
England-based company said in a statement today. Sales climbed
11 percent to 90.2 million pounds.  Ricardo, which adapts Land Rovers for military operations,
won a 13 million-pound deal with the defence ministry to
supply 200 vehicles, which can be used in mine-blast
operations, Chief Executive Officer David Shemmans said by
phone today. Total orders rose 16 percent to 117 million pounds
for the period.  “On defense, companies like us are viewing the situation
in the Middle East with interest as we can see the domino effect
of instability in the region,” Shemmans said, “We also see the
return of passenger cars as car companies are driven by
legislation and product development.”  About 36 percent of Ricardo’s business comes from passenger
cars, 26 percent from defense and 23 percent from commercial
vehicles, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
