Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the growing U.S. budget deficit could push
borrowing costs higher and curb economic growth.  “The long-term unsustainability of our debt is a
significant problem because it threatens higher  interest rates ,
less confidence, and it could have impact on the current
recovery,” Bernanke said in response to a question from the
Senate Banking Committee.  “I have been urging Congress to address these problems not
just in the current fiscal year, but looking over a longer time
frame, because it is in fact over the next 10 or 20 years that
these problems are going to be extraordinarily pressing,”
Bernanke said.  When asked if the debt is a top priority for lawmakers,
Bernanke said, “over the long term, certainly. It certainly
must be addressed to get us back on a sustainable path.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
