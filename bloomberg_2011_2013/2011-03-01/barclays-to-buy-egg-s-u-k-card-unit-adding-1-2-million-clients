  Barclays Plc , the U.K.’s third-
biggest bank, agreed to buy  Citigroup Inc .’s Egg credit card
assets to add customer accounts valued at about 2.3 billion
pounds ($3.2 billion).  Barclays plans to combine the 1.2 million U.K. accounts
with its Barclaycard credit-card unit, the London-based bank
said in a statement today. Terms of the acquisition, to be
completed in the first six months of 2011, weren’t disclosed.  The purchase “has been priced at a significant discount”
to Egg’s 2.3 billion pounds of gross receivables,”  Chris Lucas ,
Barclays group finance director, said in the statement. “We
expect the transaction to exceed the financial return targets
set out at our recent results announcement.”  Citigroup Chief Executive Officer  Vikram Pandit  has been
trying to sell units after the New York-based bank received a
$45 billion bailout from the U.S. government. Citigroup said
today it has reduced assets within its Citi Holdings unit, which
comprises those businesses, loans and securities targeted for
sale, by more than $400 billion since the first quarter of 2008.  Citigroup said it doesn’t expect the sale to be
“material” to net income. The transaction “demonstrates
Citi’s continued success in reducing assets and businesses in
Citi holdings in an economically rational manner,” the bank
said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
