  Nigeria  will sign binding
memorandums of understanding with  oil companies  for the building
of petrochemical and fertilizer plants at a cost of $20 billion
“in the weeks ahead,” the country’s petroleum minister said.  “Petrochemical plants mean fertilizer plants that will
increase our agriculture and food production and methanol plants
that will boost industrial production, creating over 300,000
jobs,” Diezani Alison-Madueke said today at a campaign rally of
the ruling People’s  Democratic Party  in Lagos, the commercial
capital. President Goodluck Jonathan is running in an election
scheduled for April 9.  Nigeria, Africa’s largest oil producer, plans to refine
more of its crude output locally by building three new
refineries in Lagos, the central Kogi State and the Southern
Bayelsa State.  Exxon Mobil Corp., Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron Corp., Total
SA and Eni SpA run joint ventures with state-owned Nigerian
National Petroleum Corp. that pump about 90 percent of the
country’s oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
