Overseas investors sold a net 693
million rupees ($15.3 million) of Indian equities yesterday,
taking total outflow from equities this year to 94.7 billion
rupees, the nation’s market regulator said.  Foreigners purchased 37.4 billion rupees of shares and sold
38.1 billion rupees, the  Securities and Exchange Board of India 
said on its website  today . They sold a net 17 billion rupees of
bonds, reducing their purchases in debt this year to 98 billion
rupees.  Global investors, attracted by  India ’s economic expansion,
bought a record 1.33 trillion rupees of shares in 2010, lifting
the benchmark index 17 percent and making it the best performer
among the world’s 10 biggest equity markets. They invested 464
billion rupees in bonds last year.  Foreign funds have placed 4.376 trillion rupees in equities
and 884.6 billion rupees in bonds since they were allowed into
the country in 1993. The previous record was in 2009 when flows
reached 834.2 billion rupees, sparking the biggest advance in 18
years. Funds withdrew a record 530 billion rupees from stocks in
2008, setting off the worst annual slump.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
