Ethanol futures were little changed
in  Chicago  on ample supply and on speculation that higher
gasoline prices will increase demand.  The alternative fuel was steady as gasoline touched a 30-
month high amid political upheaval in the oil-rich Middle East.
The Energy Department will release its report on production and
supply tomorrow after reporting last week that stockpiles had
slipped 1.2 percent to 19.3 million barrels from a record 19.6
million.  “Energies overall are helping out,” said Justin Dirico,
senior ethanol trader at SCB & Associates LLC in Chicago.
“There’s still a lot of ethanol out there. Hopefully tommorow’s
report will show a draw in stocks.”  Denatured ethanol for March delivery increased 0.3 cent to
$2.595 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the highest price
since July 15, 2008. Futures are 53 percent higher than a year
ago.  In cash market trading, ethanol on the West Coast gained
7.5 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $2.675 a gallon and in the U.S.
Gulf the additive jumped 4.5 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $2.62,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  New York  added 2 cents, or 0.8 percent, to
$2.675 a gallon and in Chicago the biofuel rose 1 cent, or 0.4
percent, to $2.57.  Oil Rises  Oil for April delivery rose $2.66 to $99.63 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest settlement since Sept.
30, 2008. Prices jumped 5.2 percent in February and have risen
27 percent in the past year. Oil touched $100.69 a barrel as of
4:45 p.m. New York time in electronic trading after the
settlement.  Gasoline for April delivery advanced 9.07 cents to settle
at $2.9834 a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the
highest level for the contract closest to expiration since Aug.
29, 2008.  Corn futures for May delivery gained 4.5 cents, or 0.6
percent, to settle at $7.355 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel
distills into 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  The average ethanol mill in Iowa is losing 7 cents on every
gallon produced, while plants in  Illinois  are losing 1 cent on a
spot basis, according to Ag Trader Talk, an online grains
information service in Clive,  Iowa .  To contact the reporter on this story:
