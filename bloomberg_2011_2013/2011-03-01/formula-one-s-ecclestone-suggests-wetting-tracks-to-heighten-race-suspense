After Qatar announced plans to
combat heat by air-conditioning 2022 World Cup soccer stadiums,
Formula One may simulate rainfall at racetracks to make racing
more unpredictable.  Chief Executive  Bernie Ecclestone  told the series website
that soaking racetracks for, say, 20 minutes of a 90-minute
event would guarantee “suspense.” Racing becomes more
treacherous in wet weather, usually requiring drivers to stop
for specially adapted tires.  “We always had the most exciting races in the wet so let’s
think of making rain,” Ecclestone told  Formula1.com . “There
are racetracks that you can make artificially wet” and it could
be done easily, he said.  Yas Marina circuit in  Abu Dhabi , which hosts a Formula One
race on Nov. 13, sprayed water onto the tarmac to simulate wet
weather at a January practice session.  The most-watched motor sport has grappled with making races
more entertaining since  Michael Schumacher  dominated from 2000
to 2004 with the Ferrari team. In 2002, television ratings fell
by one-third in parts of  Europe  after the German driver clinched
the title with six races left.  This year, Formula One is introducing adjustable rear wings
to increase car speed and try to make passing easier.  “Overtaking is almost impossible because in the dry there
is only one line good for maximum speed,” Ecclestone said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
