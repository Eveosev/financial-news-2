  Argentina ’s tax agency said it’s
investigating 48 cereals exporters for possibly evading levies.  The companies may have failed to pay a combined 150 million
pesos ($37 million) in taxes between June 2009 and August, the
agency known as Afip said today in an e-mailed statement. The
agency didn’t name the companies being investigated.  Last year, Afip accused  Bunge Ltd ., Cargill Inc. and
Molinos Rio de la Plata SA, three of the country’s largest
soybean processors and shippers, of not paying all their taxes.
Argentina is the world’s largest exporter of soy oil and the
third largest of soybeans.  Afip stepped up its scrutiny of commodity exporters in
September, when it said four of the country’s 10 biggest
exporters and cereals and soybean processors underpaid taxes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
