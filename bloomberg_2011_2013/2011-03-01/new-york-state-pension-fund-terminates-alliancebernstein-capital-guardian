New York’s $140.6 billion pension
fund ended relationships with two managers of U.S. large cap
stocks,  AllianceBernstein Holding LP  and Capital Guardian Trust
Co., as the third-largest U.S. retiree plan moves money into
assets like timber and gold as well as “opportunistic” funds.  AllianceBernstein managed $1.3 billion of assets and
Capital Guardian managed $1.2 billion, said Olayinka Fadahunsi,
a spokesman for state comptroller Thomas DiNapoli in a telephone
interview.  “We’re rebalancing,” Fadahunsi said. “We’re reducing
exposure in domestic equities.”  New York also committed $175 million to two private equity
funds, a $50 million commitment to Vista Foundation Fund and
$125 million to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.’s China growth
fund, Fadahunsi said.  John Meyers, a spokesman for AllianceBernstein, declined to
comment. Maura Griffin, a spokesman for Capital Guardian parent
Capital Group Cos Inc., didn’t immediately return a call seeking
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
