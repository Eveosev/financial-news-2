Political unrest in the Middle East
may drive energy prices higher, and the U.S. should boost
domestic energy production to limit damage to the economy, House
Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman  Fred Upton  said.  “We need to step up production,” Upton, a Michigan
Republican, said today in  Washington  at an event sponsored by
 Bloomberg Government  and  The Abraham Group LLC .  Crude rose from the lowest in a week as Libyan oil exports
were curbed by fighting in the North African country and
demonstrations planned in Iran raised concern that disruptions
will spread. Crude for April delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  rose as much as $1.08 to $98.05 a barrel and was at
$97.84 a barrel at 9:07 a.m. New York time. The contract
yesterday slid to $96.97, the lowest since Feb. 22.  Interrupted oil production in the Middle East might push
prices higher than $100 a barrel and “really threaten our
economy in the months and years ahead,” Upton said. The U.S.
should respond by boosting oil production in the  Gulf of Mexico 
and in Alaska, Upton said. The nation also needs more power
plants to meet higher electricity demand, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
