  Ghana ’s navy impounded a 70-meter
(230-foot) supply vessel traveling from Nigeria to Trinidad and
Tobago for illegally dumping oil-based mud, the  Daily Graphic 
reported.  The U.S.-flagged Spirit River, owned by Trico Marine
Services Inc., is being held in the western port city of
Takoradi after allegedly dumping the mud near the town of
Essipon, the Accra-based newspaper said, citing Ghana’s
 Environmental Protection Agency . The waste originated in the
Benniboye oilfields in Nigeria’s Benin State, the Graphic said.  No-one was immediately available to comment when Bloomberg
News called the company’s office in Aberdeen, U.K. Calls after
hours to Trico’s office in the Woodlands,  Texas , weren’t
answered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
