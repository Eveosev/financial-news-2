U.S. Representative Spencer Bachus,
the Alabama Republican who leads the House Financial Services
Committee, said Congress should move quickly on a bill to
overhaul U.S.-run mortgage companies Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac .  “I think we ought to approve legislation within three to
four months,” Bachus said today in a CNBC television interview.
“The market needs certainty.”  Bachus’s committee is scheduled to hold a hearing today on
the Obama administration’s proposal for weaning the two firms
and the rest of the $11 trillion U.S. mortgage market from
dependence on the federal government.  Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner , in remarks prepared
for the hearing, called on lawmakers to weigh trade-offs needed
to shore up the housing-finance system and prevent the need for
taxpayer-funded bailouts.  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been sustained by $154
billion in Treasury funds since they were seized and placed
under federal conservatorship during the 2008 credit crisis.  Fannie Mae , based in  Washington , and Freddie Mac of McLean,
Virginia, own or guarantee more than half of U.S. mortgages.  Congress must pass legislation to overhaul mortgage finance
within two years, Geithner said in his statement. Without
action, the housing market would remain vulnerable to flaws that
led to the collapse of the mortgage market in 2008, he said in
testimony obtained by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
