Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said it’s “possible” that U.S. states could pose a
risk to the financial system.  “Currently, while states are facing very tough financial
conditions, at least as long as the recovery continues, they are
seeing higher tax revenues and that will at least be helpful to
some of them,” he said today in response to questioning before
the Senate Banking Committee. “Obviously, this is something we
have to watch carefully.”  When asked whether states pose a systemic risk, Bernanke
said, “It’s possible.”  Asked if the there would be no purchases of state debt by
the Fed, Bernanke said “I can say that, yes.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
