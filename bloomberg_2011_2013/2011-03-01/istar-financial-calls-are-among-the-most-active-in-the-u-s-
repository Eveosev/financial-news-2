  IStar Financial Inc . call-option
trades were among the most active on U.S. exchanges as the real-
estate lender seeks $3 billion in loans to refinance debt.  An investor bought 39,337 July $10 calls for $1.40 at 12:41
p.m. in New York while selling the same number of July $13 calls
for 40 cents, according to a report today from options
strategists at Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP in  Bala Cynwyd ,  Pennsylvania , and data compiled by Bloomberg. Call volume jumped
to a record.  Almost 100,500 calls to buy the stock changed hands today,
more than 20 times the four-week average and 8.5 times the
number of puts to sell. The July $10 calls and July $13 calls
were the most-traded contracts and accounted for four-fifths of
all call trades. The New York-based company, which was facing
bankruptcy as recently as September, declined 1.5 percent to
$9.84.  IStar is seeking to take advantage of the strongest
investor demand for high-yield, high-risk loans in more than
three years. The company proposed pricing on the new debt on
Feb. 24 and lenders must let JPMorgan Chase & Co., the bank
arranging the credit facility, know by March 10 if they will
participate in the deal, according to a person with knowledge of
the matter.  IStar’s Debt  The cost to protect iStar’s debt for five years with
credit-default swaps fell 0.2 percentage point to 4.3 percent
upfront, according to data provider CMA. That’s in addition to 5
percent a year, meaning it would cost $430,000 initially and
$500,000 annually to protect $10 million of the company’s debt.  The CDS contracts have climbed from 3.5 percent on Feb. 22,
CMA data show. Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value if
a borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the value of the
defaulted debt.  IStar’s implied volatility, the key gauge of option prices,
for at-the-money options expiring in 30 days rose to 57.97 from
54.32 yesterday, which was its lowest level since June 2008.  Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the
right to sell. Investors use options to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities they own, speculate on
share-price moves or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will
rise or fall.  To contact the reporters on this story:
