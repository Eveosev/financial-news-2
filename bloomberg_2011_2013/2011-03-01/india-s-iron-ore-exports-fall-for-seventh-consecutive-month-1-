  Iron ore  shipments from India, the
world’s third largest exporter, fell for a seventh consecutive
month in January due to a ban on overseas sales from the
southern state of Karnataka and higher taxes on shipments.  Exports dropped 24.4 percent to 10.7 million metric tons,
the  Federation of Indian Mineral Industries  said in an e-mailed
statement today. Exports in the April-to-November period fell
18.1 percent to 75.1 million tons.  India raised export taxes on ore lumps last year to 15
percent from 10 percent. Karnataka banned iron ore exports in
July to increase supplies of the steelmaking ingredient. The
Indian government plans to raise duties on shipments of all
grades of iron ore to 20 percent from April 1, Finance Minister
Pranab Mukherjee said in his budget proposal yesterday.  Shipments from the state of Goa fell 6.5 percent to 7.2
million tons in January, while exports from the southern city of
Chennai fell to 11,000 tons from 688,000 tons a year earlier,
the statement said.  The Federation’s President Siddharth Rungta yesterday said  India  may export 85 million tons of ore in the year to March 31,
higher than an August forecast of 66 million tons. Indian miners
gained from a surge in demand from  China  and a supply shortfall
because of inclement weather in Australia and  Brazil .  To contact the reporter on this story:
