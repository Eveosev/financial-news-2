Zambia plans to restart production
at its largest coffee producer, which was closed in 2008 after
it defaulted on loan repayments,  Reuters  said, citing Dickson
Jere, a press aide to President Rupiah Banda.  The Northern Coffee Corp., formerly known as Kasama Coffee
Co., produced one-third of Zambiaâ€™s 6,000 metric tons of coffee
in 2004, the news agency cited Jere as saying.  Zambia produced 1,250 tons of coffee in 2010, down from
1,643 tons a year earlier, Reuters said, citing data from the
Zambia Coffee Growers Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
