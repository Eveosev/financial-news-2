U.S. stocks trimmed gains, a day
after benchmark indexes capped a third straight monthly advance,
as a surge in  oil prices  tempered optimism that the economy is
accelerating.  The Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index rose 0.1 percent after
climbing as much as 0.4 percent in early trading. The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  increased 7.23 points, or 0.1 percent, to
12,233.57. Crude oil for April delivery rallied 1.8 percent to
$98.71 a barrel, rebounding from a one-week low, as Libyan crude
exports were curbed by fighting and demonstrations were planned
in Iran.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
