Copper rose to a one-week high on
signs that the U.S. economic recovery is accelerating.  Manufacturing in the U.S., the world’s second-largest
copper user, grew in February at the fastest pace in almost
seven years, the Tempe, Arizona-based Institute for Supply
Management said today. The  unemployment rate  in January was at
9 percent, the lowest since April 2009.  “We are seeing improvement in everything except
housing,” said  Matthew Zeman , a metal trader at LaSalle
Futures Group in Chicago. “Even with the unrest in Middle
East, people are putting on the risk trade.”  Copper futures for May delivery rose 1.3 cents, or 0.3
percent, to close at $4.5095 a pound at 1:21 p.m. on the Comex
in  New York , after touching $4.525, the highest for a most-
active contract since Feb. 22.  The metal may finish the month “marginally higher” as
equity markets improve, said  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior market
strategist at Lind-Waldock in Chicago.  Prices have jumped 35 percent in the past year, touching a
record $4.6575 on Feb. 15, as mining companies failed to keep
pace with rising consumption in emerging markets.  China  is the
largest buyer of the metal.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months dropped $26, or 0.3 percent, to $9,860 a metric ton
($4.47 a pound). Tin, zinc, lead and nickel also declined in
London.  Aluminum gained 0.4 percent to $2,610 a ton, after
reaching $2,617.25, the highest since September 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
