  Kazakhstan ’s central bank said a
return to a “managed” free float by abolishing the tenge’s
trading corridor will allow the currency to strengthen until it
reaches a “comfort level” for the economy.  The factors “conducive to a strengthening” of the tenge,
including higher prices for oil, metals and grain, will continue
to gain momentum, the central bank said today in an e-mailed
statement from Almaty, the country’s financial center.  The regulator bought about $4.5 billion in the first two
months of the year to stem tenge gains, compared with $2 billion
in all of 2010, the regulator said.  The National Bank of Kazakhstan yesterday abolished the
corridor it had used to manage the tenge  exchange rate  by buying
and selling foreign currency in the past two years. The central
bank devalued the tenge by more than 20 percent in February 2009
amid the global credit crisis and sliding economic growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
