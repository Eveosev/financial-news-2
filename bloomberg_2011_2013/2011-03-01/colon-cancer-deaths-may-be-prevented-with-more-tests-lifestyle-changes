Colon cancer, the third-most-lethal
form of the disease for both men and women, would continue an
almost three-decade decline with increased screening, the  American Cancer Society  said.  The colon cancer rate, which has been dropping “since the
mid-1980s,” would also fall if people modify their lifestyles,
the  Atlanta-based group  said in a report. Only about half of the  U.S. population  aged 50 and older is up-to-date on colon cancer
screening, the report said.  About 141,000 people will be diagnosed with the cancer, and
49,000 people will die from the disease this year, the group
said. In addition to screening, people can reduce their colon
cancer risk through 30 minutes of daily physical activity, not
smoking, limiting intake of red and processed meats and alcohol,
and maintaining a proper body weight, according to the report.  “A recent study found that about one-quarter of colorectal
cancer cases could be avoided by following a healthy
lifestyle,” the authors of the report said.  The lifetime risk of being diagnosed with colon cancer is
about 5 percent for people in the U.S., the group said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
