  China ’s yuan rose toward a 17-year
high on speculation policy makers will permit more gains to help
contain inflation, which accelerated in all but one of the seven
months through January.  The currency strengthened for a third day after the
Financial News reported  Liu Mingkang , chairman of the  China
Banking Regulatory Commission , as saying the yuan had entered a
period of “only appreciation.” Exports exceeded imports by
$183 billion in 2010 and trade partners including the U.S.,
France and India say an undervalued yuan gives Chinese exporters
an unfair advantage.  “There is big appreciation pressure on the yuan as the  trade surplus  remains at such a high level,” said  Liu Dongliang ,
a Shenzhen-based senior analyst at China Merchants Bank Co., the
country’s sixth-largest lender by market value. The Chinese
currency will rise 5 percent during 2011, he predicted.  The yuan advanced 0.02 percent to 6.5703 per dollar as of
5:19 p.m. in  Shanghai , according to the China Foreign Exchange
Trade System. It touched 6.5654 on Feb. 21, the strongest level
since China unified official and market exchange rates at the
end of 1993.  The central bank set the reference rate for yuan trading
0.07 percent stronger at 6.5706 per dollar, near the highest
level since a dollar peg was scrapped in July 2005. Premier  Wen Jiabao  said Feb. 27 a stronger currency will benefit the
nation’s economy by cooling inflation.  Forwards Rise  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards rose 0.11 percent to
6.4055 per dollar, reflecting bets the currency will strengthen
2.6 percent in one year’s time, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  China’s manufacturing purchasing managers’ index fell to
52.2 in February from 52.9 in January, the National Bureau of
Statistics and the Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said
in a statement today. A reading above 50 indicates an expansion.  “The PMI figure shows economic vitality eased after all
the tightening measures came out in the past four months, but
there is no sign that the appreciation pace will slow down,”
said China Merchants’ Liu.  -  Judy Chen , Fion Li. Editors: Andrew Janes, James Regan  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
