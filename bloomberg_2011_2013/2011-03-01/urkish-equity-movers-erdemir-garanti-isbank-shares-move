Turkey’s benchmark  ISE National 100
Index  dropped the most since May, falling 4.2 percent to
58,709.33 at the 5:30 p.m. close of trading in Istanbul.  The following stocks were active. Symbols are in
parentheses.  Eregli Demir ve Celik Fabrikalari TAS (EREGL TI), or
Erdemir, Turkey’s biggest steelmaker, fell the most since May,
retreating 5.1 percent to 4.69 liras. The company sold its 25
percent stake in ArcelorMittal Ambalaj Celigi Sanayi & Ticaret
AS for $10.5 million after Turkey’s antitrust regulator ordered
it to divest shares, according to a statement to the bourse
after the close yesterday.    Turkiye Is Bankasi  AS (ISCTR TI), Turkey’s largest listed
bank by assets, fell 5.8 percent to 4.69 liras, the steepest
decline since December. An increasing trade deficit makes it
likely that Turkey’s central bank will need to raise interest
rates, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in an e-mailed report
today. Turkey’s index of bank shares fell 6 percent, the most
since January 2009.  Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS  (GARAN TI)
decreased 5.7 percent to 6.68 liras.  To contact the reporter on this story:
