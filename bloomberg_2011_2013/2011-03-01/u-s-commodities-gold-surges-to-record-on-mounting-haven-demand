Gold rose to a record of $1,435.60
an ounce in  New York  as unrest in  Libya  spurred demand for the
metal as an investment haven.  Libya’s opposition gained support from the U.S. and
European nations as  Muammar Qaddafi  sent forces to regain lost
territory. Protests spread in the region, partly because food
prices have soared. Crude oil in New York topped $100 a barrel
today as Iranian protesters clashed with security forces in
Tehran. Gold rose for the 10th time in 11 sessions.  “The continued violence in the Middle East is bringing in
new buyers and spurring gold to new territory,” said  Frank
McGhee , the head dealer at Integrated Brokerage Services LLC in  Chicago . “The rush to economic health is fading. Crude above
$100 is an  energy tax  that will force governments to put more
money into the system. Our old fear of stagflation returns.”  In other markets, oil surged to the highest since September
2008 as Middle East turmoil threatened to spread from Libya to
top OPEC producers  Saudi Arabia  and Iran. Cotton also gained.
The UBS Bloomberg Constant Maturity Commodity Index advanced 0.6
percent to 1,770.05. Earlier, the gauge reached 1,770.457,
extending a rally to a record.  Gold futures for April delivery reached the all-time high
after the close of regular trading on the Comex in New York. The
metal had settled up $21.30, or 1.5 percent, at $1.431.20. The
previous intraday record was $1,432.50 on Dec. 7.  Crude Oil  Oil futures for April delivery rose $2.66, or 2.7 percent,
to $99.63 on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest
settlement since Sept. 30, 2008. In electronic trading after the
close, the price reached $100.69.  Saudi Arabia’s benchmark stock index plunged the most since
November 2008 on concern that regional unrest would extend to
the kingdom. Fighting in Libya caused its oil output to drop
last month to the lowest since January 2003, according to a
Bloomberg News survey of companies, producers and analysts.  “All over the region, things are keeping the market very
nervous,” said  Phil Flynn , a vice president of research at
PFGBest in Chicago. “There’s no real end in sight.”  Saudi Arabia is the biggest producer in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, followed by  Iran .  Cotton  Cotton climbed to the highest since reaching a record price
more than a week ago on renewed concern that global supplies are
failing to keep pace with demand from  China , the biggest
consumer.  China imported 390,720 metric tons in January, 31 percent
more than a year earlier, after an 86 percent increase in 2010
to 2.84 million tons, the customs agency said on Feb. 24. The
National Bureau of Statistics said yesterday that output
declined 6.3 percent to 5.97 million tons last year. Prices more
than doubled on ICE Futures U.S. in the past six months.  “China wants to import a whole lot of cotton,” said Louis
Barbera, a broker at VIP Commodities in New York. “The lack of
cotton that we see will not change for the next few months.”  Cotton for May delivery advanced 2.37 cents, or 1.2 percent
to settle at $1.936 a pound on ICE in New York. Earlier, the
price surged by the exchange limit of 7 cents to $1.9823. The
fiber reached a record of $2.0893 on Feb. 18.  Commodities settled as follows:  Precious metals:
