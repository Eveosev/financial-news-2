CatalunyaCaixa, a grouping of
Spanish savings banks, may need between 1.5 billion euros and
1.7 billion euros to meet new government capital requirements,
Efe reported, citing Adolf Todo, the lenderâ€™s general director.  That estimate is based on a scenario in which
CatalunyaCaixa would need a core capital ratio of 10 percent,
Efe said, citing him. The lender has hired Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. to do a valuation and help it line up the new capital,
which could come from private investors or from the government
bank restructuring fund, known as the FROB, Efe said, citing
Todo.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
