  Goldman Sachs Group Inc ., the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, has closed or is closing two
trading units that made bets with the firm’s own capital, an
activity that has been prohibited under new U.S. financial rules.  To comply with provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, Goldman
Sachs during 2010 “liquidated substantially all of the
positions” in the principal-strategies unit that operated
within the firm’s equities division, the New York-based company
said today in its annual 10-K filing with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission.  In the first quarter of 2011, the firm “commenced the
liquidation of the positions that had been held by the global
macro proprietary-trading desk” within the fixed-income,
currencies and commodities division, according to the filing.  “Net revenues from principal strategies and our global
macro proprietary-trading desk were not material for the year
ended December 2010,” the filing said. “We will continue to
assess our business, risk management, and compliance practices
to conform with developments in the regulatory environment.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
