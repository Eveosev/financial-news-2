  Argentina  suspended the issue of
import licenses for farm equipment from  Brazil ,  Valor Economico 
reported, citing an official at the Brazilian automakers
association, known as Anfavea.  Manufacturers of harvesters and tractors havenâ€™t obtained
permits since January, Milton Rego, a vice-president at the
association, told the Sao Paulo-based newspaper. The suspension
is not official, Valor said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
