Aberdeen Asset Management Plc will
launch a fund that will invest in local-currency short-duration
Asian bonds, the company said in a release emailed to media
today.  The fund, to be managed by the fixed-income team in  Singapore , will focus mainly on sovereign bonds across as many
as 10 countries in Asia, excluding Japan, the release said.  Anthony Michael, who manages $6.4 billion as head of Asia-
Pacific fixed income at Aberdeen Asset in Singapore, will head
the new fund.  “Asian currencies are undervalued and will appreciate over
time,” he wrote in the release. “China is often singled out, but
at any given moment other countries’ currencies may be
appreciating faster.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:  James Regan  at
