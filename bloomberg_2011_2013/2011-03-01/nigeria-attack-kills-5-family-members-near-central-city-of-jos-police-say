Gunmen in  Nigeria  attacked a village
in the country’s Plateau state, killing five members of a family
in a region beset in recent months by sectarian violence, police
said.  The attack on the village of Dabwak occurred before dawn
yesterday “during which unknown gunmen killed a family of
five,” police state commissioner, Abdulrahman Akano, told
reporters today in Jos, the Plateau capital. “We’re yet to make
arrests.”  More than 200 people have died in reprisal attacks by
Christian and Muslim groups in the Plateau region, according to
New York-based  Human Rights Watch , since multiple bomb blasts in
Jos on Christmas Eve killed 80 people. A radical Islamic sect
known as Boko Haram, or “Western education is a sin,” claimed
responsibility for the explosions.  Nigeria,  Africa ’s top oil producer and most populous nation
with about 140 million people, is roughly split between a mainly
Muslim north and a predominantly Christian south. More than
14,000 people died in ethnic and religious clashes in the West
African nation between 1999 and 2009, according to the Brussels-
based  International Crisis Group .  A man funding the Boko Haram sect was killed in a police
raid on a hideout used by the group in the northeastern town of
Damaturu on Feb. 27 after militants in his compound engaged the
security forces in a gun fight, police authorities said
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
