Japan’s bonds rose, snapping a
three-day decline, as falling stocks and higher  oil prices 
boosted demand for the safety of government debt.  Yields on 10-year bonds sank the most in almost six weeks
as Japanese shares had the biggest slump since August and oil
prices reached a 29-month high amid unrest in the Middle East.
Bonds also climbed after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben Bernanke 
said yesterday he wants to see a “sustained period of stronger  job creation .”  “Bonds are being bought following a slump in stocks,”
said Tadashi Matsukawa, fixed-income head at PineBridge
Investments Japan Co. in Tokyo. “The market’s focus is on the
Middle East situation and oil prices.”  The yield on the 1.3 percent bond due March 2021 fell 4.5
basis points to 1.270 percent as of 3:09 p.m. in Tokyo at Japan
Bond Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker.
The 10-year bonds were issued yesterday. The yield decline was
the most for a benchmark bond since a six basis point slide on
Jan. 20.  Five-year yields decreased three basis points to 0.525
percent. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. Ten-year bond
futures for March delivery gained 0.35 to 139.70 at the 3 p.m.
close at the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  The  Nikkei 225  Stock Average sank 2.4 percent, the steepest
slide since Aug. 31. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index sank 1.6
percent yesterday, while U.S. 10-year yields dropped four basis
points to 3.39 percent.  Libyan rebels braced for renewed clashes with forces loyal
to leader  Muammar Qaddafi .  Saudi Arabia ’s benchmark stock index
plunged the most since November 2008 on concern regional unrest
would extend to the kingdom. Iranian protesters clashed with
security forces in Tehran, Al Arabiya television reported.  Oil Surges  Oil for April delivery gained to as high as $100.64 a
barrel in  New York  today, after closing at $99.63 yesterday, the
highest settlement since Sept. 30, 2008.  “The market is favorable for bonds on surging oil prices,
which sent U.S. stocks lower and Treasuries higher,” said
Shinji Ebihara, a Tokyo-based Japan rates strategist at Credit
Suisse Securities Japan Ltd. “Yields are unlikely to see upward
pressure.”  Bernanke’s comments yesterday indicate the Fed will stay on
course to complete $600 billion of Treasury purchases through
June in a bid to reduce an  unemployment rate  persisting at 9
percent or higher for almost two years.  The U.S. unemployment rate increased to 9.1 percent last
month from 9 percent in January, according to a Bloomberg News
survey before a Labor Department report on March 4.  To contact the reporters on this story:
