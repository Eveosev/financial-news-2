The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
probably won’t fall more than 6 percent from this year’s high
after holding above its “channel support” line during last
week’s retreat, according to Bank of America Corp.  While the benchmark for U.S. equities slipped as low as
1,294.26 last week, it managed to close above 1,300 each day,
staying above an uptrend line that’s been in place since the
index’s August low, according to data from Bank of America and
Bloomberg. That suggested the market may keep its momentum and
continue to rally after this dip, Bartels said.  “This support fits the definition of a limited pullback of
3 percent to 6 percent off the 1,344 high” of this year,
Bartels, who ranked second among analysts who study price charts
in Institutional Investor’s most recent survey, wrote in a note
yesterday. “The trend for the  S&P 500  remains up.”  The S&P 500 fell 1.7 percent last week for its biggest
weekly loss in three months as  Libya ’s anti-government uprising
pushed  oil prices  higher and prompted concern economic growth
may falter. The benchmark has jumped 27 percent since Aug. 26,
the day before Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said  he
was prepared to take action to help the economy. Since that
statement, the most the index has fallen from a peak was 3.9
percent from Nov. 5 through Nov. 16.  While last week’s slump wasn’t enough to threaten the  bull
market  that began in March 2009, trading volume started to show
signs of increased selling, Bartels said. On Feb. 22, when the
S&P 500 had its biggest slide since August, 5.65 billion shares
traded on the  New York  Stock Exchange, the third busiest day
this year. When the market rebounded three days later, volume
shrank to 4.03 billion, Bloomberg data showed.  Philip J. Roth, chief technical market analyst at New York-
based Miller Tabak, said increased volumes on rallies are needed
to preserve the market’s momentum.  “The next rallies are important,” Roth wrote in a note
yesterday. “Poor rallies could broaden a topping pattern. A
failure to rally much and renewed selling pressure right away
would likely be a medium-term negative.”  To contact the reporter on this story:  Lu Wang  in New York at   lwang8@bloomberg.net .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
