Italian banks are lobbying for a
change in the way their stakes in  Bank of Italy  are valued in an
effort to ease regulatory pressure on them to raise capital, the
Financial Times reported, citing unidentified senior bankers.  The mark-to-market valuation the banks are seeking would
include the central bank’s gold reserves and therefore increase
the value of the banks’ stakes to reflect rising gold prices,
the FT said. The change could give the Bank of Italy a mark-to-
market value of about 30 billion euros ($41 billion), the FT
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
