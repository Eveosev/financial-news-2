North Korean leader  Kim Jong Il ’s
youngest son and heir, Kim Jong Un, may make his first official
visit to China around March 14, the Sankei newspaper said.  Jong Un may visit Beijing around when China’s National
People’s Congress ends and meet with President Hu Jintao and
Vice President Xi Jinping to ask for economic assistance, the
Japanese daily said, citing unidentified sources on China-North
Korean relations.  China is concerned about the elder Kim’s health and wants
to gauge the impact in  North Korea  from pro-democracy movements
in Middle Eastern countries such as Tunisia, Egypt and Libya,
the paper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
