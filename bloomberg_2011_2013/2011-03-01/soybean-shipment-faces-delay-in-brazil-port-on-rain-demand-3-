Soybean and corn shipments from the  Brazil ’s second-largest port face delays because of rain as
farmers boost exports amid surging prices, a port official said.  About 1,000 trucks are waiting to unload at the southern
port of Paranagua, Business Director Lourenco Fregonese said in
a telephone interview today. A year earlier, there was no line,
he said.  Five days of above-average rainfall has prevented trucks
from unloading, and the line of waiting cargo now extends 20
kilometers (12 miles), Fregonese said. The port is expected to
handle as much as a combined 28 million metric tons of corn,
wheat, soybeans, soy meal and sugar this year, up 20 percent
from 2010 as farmers boost exports to benefit from rising
prices, he said.  “Farmers are in a euphoria and selling more abroad,”
Fregonese said. “Shipping demand will continue to heat up this
year.”  Soybean output in Brazil, the world’s second-biggest
grower, may rise to a record 70.1 million tons this year, from
68.7 million tons last year, the  Agriculture Ministry  said on
Feb. 9. Corn growers will harvest 54.5 million tons of the
grain, down from 56 million tons in 2010, the ministry said.  Soybean Exports  Soybean exports may rise 6.2 percent to a record 31 million
tons this year, or $21 billion, fueled by rising demand from  China , according to the Brazilian soybean processors’
association, known as  Abiove .  Corn prices have jumped 91 percent in  Chicago  in the past
12 months, while wheat has added 59 percent and soybeans rose 42
percent.  Soybean futures for May delivery were little changed at
$13.64 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade at 1:16 p.m. New
York time. The price hit a 30-month high of $14.5575 on Feb. 9.  Intermittent rain since yesterday hasn’t caused any
shipping delays at the Santos port, Latin America’s biggest,
said research firm SA Commodities and shipping agency Unimar
Agenciamentos Maritimos. While 15 ships wait to load grains at
Paranagua port, only three are waiting in Santos port, the firm
said.  Paranagua shipped 1 million tons of grains in January, and
Santos port shipped 709,000 tons, SA Commodities said. Paranagua
ships more grains than Santos, while Santos ships more sugar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
