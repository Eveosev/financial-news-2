  Roche Holding AG  should provide more
information on the survival benefit of the MabThera medicine for
advanced follicular non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, the U.K. National
Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence said today in draft
guidance on how to treat the disease.  Evidence indicates the drug could keep cancer in remission
following chemotherapy, though more analysis is needed to show
how long the effect lasts and whether the treatment improves
patients’ survival, according to the agency, which advises the  National Health Service  on the cost-effectiveness of treatments.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
