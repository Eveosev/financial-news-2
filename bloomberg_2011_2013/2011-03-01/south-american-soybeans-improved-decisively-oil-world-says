South American soybean prospects
“improved decisively” in February as rainfall boosted crop
conditions, and exports from the continent may reach a record,
Oil World said in a report.  Output in Brazil,  Argentina ,  Paraguay ,  Bolivia  and Uruguay
will total 131.13 million metric tons in the current marketing
year, up 2.8 percent from a January estimate, the analyst said.
South American exports may reach a record 47.4 million tons in
the year through August as  Brazil  ships more, Oil World said.
Exports from the U.S. and  Canada  also may increase, it said.  “In  South America , soybean production prospects have
improved decisively,” according to the report. “There is a
possibility that actual production in Brazil and Argentina even
turns out above our forecasts.”  Soybean futures for May delivery rose 7.5 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $13.7225 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade at
11:10 a.m.  London  time. The price has gained 43 percent in the
past year.  Global growers may harvest 259.01 million tons, up 1.2
percent from the Jan. 28 forecast, Oil World said. Stockpiles of
soybeans will total 66.2 million tons, up 3.1 percent from the
January estimate, Oil World said.  World soybean processing is set to increase 7.9 percent
compared with a year earlier to 227.2 million tons in the year
through September, the analyst said in the report.  World imports will reach a record 95.2 million tons through
September, an increase of 7.3 percent, Oil World said. Chinese
imports of the oilseed may total 55 million tons, 58 percent of
total purchases, according to the report. Rapeseed availability
has declined in the European Union, which may boost imports of
soybeans, Oil World said.  ‘Dramatic Expansion’  “The most dramatic expansion is occurring in  China ,”
according to the report. “EU imports of soybeans are set to
recover as crushers are replacing insufficient supplies of
rapeseed.”  EU rapeseed imports will total 2.5 million tons through
June, up from 2.18 million tons a year ago, Oil World said.
Production is forecast at 20.61 million tons, unchanged from a
January report and 5.3 percent lower than a year ago, the
company said. World output may fall 2.8 percent from a year
earlier to 58.77 million tons, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
