Cocoa prices received by farmers in  Nigeria , the world’s fourth-largest producer, rose to a record
yesterday, according to the country’s Cocoa Association.  The farmgate price was 535,000 naira ($3,490) a metric ton,
up from about 460,000 naira a month ago and an all-time high,
according to Neji Abang Neji, secretary general of the
association. Nigeria ranks behind  Ivory Coast ,  Ghana  and
Indonesia in cocoa production, according to the International
Cocoa Organization.  Cocoa-bean exports from Nigeria in the first 11 months of
last year rose 12 percent to 171,184 tons compared with the same
period a year earlier, according to figures from the Federal
Produce Inspection Service, the Lagos-based government agency
that inspects exports of cocoa beans.  Port arrivals of  cocoa beans  rose 7 percent from October to
Feb. 25, compared to the same period a year earlier, Anant
Patil, a business manager at Olam Nigeria Ltd., said from Lagos.  Editors: Claudia Carpenter, John Deane  To contact the reporter on this story:
