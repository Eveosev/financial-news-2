  UDR Inc ., the third-largest publicly
traded apartment owner in the U.S., plans to acquire its first
multifamily property in  Manhattan  as rents in the area climb.  UDR agreed to pay $260.8 million for  10 Hanover Square , a
493-unit Manhattan’s Financial District, the Highlands Ranch,
Colorado-based company said in a statement today. The 23-story
building, formerly office space for Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
Kidder Peabody & Co., was converted in 2005 to a residential
tower featuring a 28,000 square-foot (2,600 square-meter)
fitness complex, a rooftop sundeck and concierge service.  “The expansion of our portfolio into Manhattan reflects
our desire to own and operate apartment homes in markets that
have the best growth prospects based on favorable job formation
and low home affordability,” Tom Toomey, president and chief
executive officer of UDR, said in the statement.  Demand for Manhattan apartments is climbing as the city’s
rental market tightens. Leases almost tripled in the fourth
quarter and median rents rose 1.7 percent from a year earlier to
$2,950, appraiser  Miller Samuel Inc.  and broker Prudential
Douglas Elliman Real Estate said last month.  Assuming Mortgage  The purchase will be funded through the assumption of an
existing $192 million fixed-rate mortgage, and $4.5 million in
cash, according to the statement. UDR will also issue the
seller, New York’s Witkoff Group, $64.3 million of “operating
partnership units,” or equity.  “Our decision to receive nearly all of our equity in the
form of operating partnership units in UDR confirms our beliefs
in the management team and their ability to create significant
long-term value for its shareholders,” Witkoff Group CEO Steven
Witkoff said in the statement.  UDR estimates the purchase price, excluding retail, at
$484,000 per apartment.  Located between Pearl and Water streets, the property
includes 41,650 square feet of retail space that is fully
leased, according to the statement.  The deal will close once UDR assumes the $192 million
mortgage, according to the statement. The fixed-rate mortgage
requires interest-only payment through December 2012 and matures
in December 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
