  Indonesia ’s rupiah was steady, after
trading near the highest level in more than three years, as
government data showed inflation slowed for the first time in
four months in February. Bonds gained.  Consumer prices in Southeast Asia’s biggest economy climbed
6.84 percent last month from a year earlier, after gaining 7.02
percent in the previous month, the Central Bureau of Statistics
said today. That’s less than the 7.13 percent median forecast in
a Bloomberg News survey of 15 economists. The currency has
strengthened 1.8 percent this year, the best performance in  Asia ,
on speculation policy makers are using gains to temper inflation.  “The central bank has not shied away from saying that it
will use the  exchange rate  to combat inflation,” said  Gundy Cahyadi , an economist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. in
Singapore. “Some part of the rupiah’s appreciation is on
expectations of a further rate hike. The inflationary pressure
is still there.”  The rupiah, which earlier climbed to 8,808, was little
changed at 8,816 per dollar as of 3:20 p.m. in Jakarta,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 8,805
yesterday, the strongest level since June 2007.  Indonesia will allow the rupiah to appreciate to help keep
“imported inflation” in check, Deputy Governor Hartadi Sarwono
said on Feb. 24.    Bank Indonesia  on Feb. 4 unexpectedly raised its benchmark  reference rate  to 6.75 percent from a record-low 6.5 percent
after consumer prices climbed to a 21-month high. Eight
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News said policy makers will
tighten by another 25 basis points on March 4, while an equal
number predicted no change.  The yield on the government’s 8.25 percent bond due July
2021 dropped seven basis points today to 8.67 percent, according
to midday prices from the Inter-Dealer Market Association. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Overseas funds have increased their holdings of Indonesian
government debt to 201.9 trillion rupiah ($22.9 billion) as of
Feb. 25, from 195 trillion rupiah at the end of January,
according to the  finance ministry .  To contact the reporter on this story:
