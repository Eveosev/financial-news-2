  Lazard Ltd ., the world’s largest
independent merger adviser, named Ernst Fassbender chairman for
Germany,  Austria , as well as central and eastern Europe.  Alexander Doll and Eric Fellhauer, who were appointed co-
heads of  investment banking  for Germany, have taken over
operational responsibilities, a spokesman for the bank said by
phone today, confirming a report by Financial Times Deutschland.  Lazard, based in Hamilton, Bermuda, oversaw more than $23
billion in mergers and acquisitions in Germany last year,
ranking sixth, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The firm
advised BASF SE, the world’s largest chemicals company, on its
purchase of Cognis Holding GmbH, and Deutsche Bahn AG, Germany’s
state-owned railway, on its acquisition of U.K. bus and train
operator Arriva Plc.  Lazard, led by Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Jacobs, last
month reported fourth-quarter profit that beat analysts’
estimates as revenue from advising on takeovers increased.  To contact the reporter on this story:
