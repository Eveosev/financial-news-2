Asian currencies strengthened, led
by  India ’s rupee and Malaysia’s ringgit, after an overnight drop
in  oil prices  boosted investor confidence in emerging-market
assets.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index rose for a third
day after  Saudi Arabia  offered to make up for crude supplies
lost because of the unrest in Libya. A factory-output gauge in  China  increased by more than forecast in a Bloomberg survey,
brightening the outlook for the region’s exports. The MSCI Asia-
Pacific Index of regional shares gained after oil fell 0.9
percent yesterday.  “The rate of increase in oil prices has certainly stalled
and equity-market sentiment has also stabilized,” said Jonathan Cavenagh, a currency strategist in Singapore at Westpac Banking
Corp.  The rupee climbed 0.5 percent to 45.0513 per dollar as of
2:12 p.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The ringgit appreciated 0.4 percent to 3.0360, the  Taiwan dollar 
gained 0.3 percent to NT$29.660 and the Philippine peso
strengthened 0.3 percent to 43.445.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries’ crude-
oil output fell in February as Libya’s production dropped to an
eight-year low, slipping 200,000 barrels a day to 1.385 million,
according to a Bloomberg News survey. The price of oil rose 0.1
percent to $97.10 today.  Manufacturing Index Rises  The Purchasing Managers’ Index fell to 52.2 from 52.9 in
January, the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said
on its website today. The reading compares with the median
forecast of 52.1 in a Bloomberg News survey of 14 economists.  The ringgit approached a 13-year high after economists
surveyed by Bloomberg estimated a manufacturing index in the U.S.
rose last month to the highest level since May 2004.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s index rose to 61 in
February, from 60.8 in January, according to the median estimate
of economists in a Bloomberg News survey before data due today.
Readings greater than 50 signal growth.  “The economic data provides some support for the market
and we see sustained confidence among foreign investors in the
ringgit,” said Mohd. Yazid Safuan, head of treasury sales and
trading at Al Rajhi Banking & Investment Corp. in Kuala Lumpur.  Taiwan’s dollar rose the most in a month on speculation
exporters took advantage of a decline last week to repatriate
overseas income. The currency slid 1.2 percent in the five days
ended Feb. 25 as exchange data showed global funds sold $1.1
billion more Taiwanese shares than they bought during the period.  Indonesian Prices Rise  “It’s mainly about trade-related transactions for the
currency,” said Tarsicio Tong, a Taipei-based currency trader
at the Union Bank of  Taiwan . “Most investors are still staying
on the sidelines, waiting for more signals.”  Consumer prices in  Indonesia  rose 6.8 percent in February
from a year earlier, compared with a 7 percent gain in January,
according to official data released today. That was below the
7.1 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists.  Indonesia’s rupiah was little changed at 8,816 per dollar
after earlier gaining 0.1 percent.  Elsewhere, Thailand’s baht was little changed at 30.58 per
dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. China’s yuan
rose 0.02 percent to 6.5703, while Singapore’s dollar
strengthened 0.1 percent to S$1.2702. Financial markets in  South
Korea  are shut for a holiday.  To contact the reporter for this story:
