(Corrects to show fourth quarter 2010 and first quarter of
2011.)  Bank of England’s Deputy Governor
Charles Bean said the U.K.’s underlying growth across the fourth
quarter 2010/first quarter 2011 “looks likely to be weak.”  Bean also sees a “drop back” of inflation ‘‘as we go into
2012,’’ he said in a report to the Treasury Select Committee
today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
