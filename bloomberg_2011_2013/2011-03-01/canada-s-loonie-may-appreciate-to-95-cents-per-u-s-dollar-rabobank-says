  Canada ’s currency may extend gains
that took the so-called loonie to a three-year high versus its
U.S. counterpart if the Canadian central bank raises interest
rates as soon as May, according to Rabobank International.  The Canadian dollar appreciated to its strongest since
March 2008 after a report from  Statistics Canada  yesterday
showed gross domestic product grew 3.3 percent in the fourth
quarter. The loonie may appreciate to 95 cents per greenback, a
level it last reached in November 2007, by the second half of
this year, said Jane Foley, a senior currency strategist at
Rabobank in  London .  “Growth figures are again higher than the U.S. so you’ve
got a decent fundamental backdrop which is supportive of the
view that rates in Canada have to rise before those of the
U.S.,” said Foley. “The market was pricing in July but we see
risks they may increase before then, perhaps on May 31.”  Recent gains in the price of oil may also support the
currency, Foley said.  The Canadian dollar was 0.3 percent lower at 97.38 cents
per  U.S. dollar  as of 4:39 p.m. in London after earlier reaching
97.56.  The  Bank of Canada  today kept its benchmark interest rate
unchanged at 1 percent and policy makers said they will
carefully consider future increases in a recovery that is
“slightly faster” than they forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
