  Democratic Republic of Congo  will
lift a six-month-old ban on mining in three eastern provinces
rich in gold, tin ore and coltan on March 10, Mines Minister  Martin Kabwelulu  said.  The halt allowed the government to “put in place a mineral-
tracing program that will conform with international standards,”
he told reporters in Kinshasa, the capital, today. “We’re all
called to improve our governance as well as the business climate
in the mining sector,” he said.  President Joseph Kabila announced the ban on Sept. 9 to
break up “mafia groups” that he said controlled the mineral
trade in Maniema, North Kivu and South Kivu provinces. Congo
also wants to break the links between illegal mining and armed
groups that have fueled more than 15 years of conflict in the
region.  Kabwelulu announced the end of the ban at a conference with
provincial officials and representatives from the region’s
mining industry. Stockpiles waiting for export because of the
ban will need to be certified and tagged based on their origins,
Kabwelulu said.  Congo is  Africa ’s largest producer of tin ore and has
deposits of gold and tungsten, most of which comes from the
provinces that were affected by the ban.  To contact the reporter on this story:
