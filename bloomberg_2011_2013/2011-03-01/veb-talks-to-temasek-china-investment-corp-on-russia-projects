VEB,  Russia ’s state development
bank, is in talks with funds including Singapore’s Temasek
Holdings Pte and China Investment Corp., VEB Chairman Vladimir Dmitriev said.  “We have calculated that these funds have $3 trillion
under management,” Dmitriev told reporters in Moscow today.
Funds in the Persian Gulf and Asia “are ready to consider” co-
financing large investments in Russia, he said.  Russia, the holder of the world’s third-largest foreign
reserves, plans to create a “special sovereign fund” to
attract investment from abroad and at home, President Dmitry Medvedev said in January at the  World Economic Forum  in Davos.  Foreign direct investment dropped an annual 13 percent last
year to $13.8 billion, the Federal Statistics Service said on
Feb. 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
