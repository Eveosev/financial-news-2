Jordan will start construction work
on a 2.4 billion dinar ($3.4 billion) National Railway Network
in the first quarter next year, the  Jordan Times  reported,
citing Transport Minister Muhannad Qudah.  The government will issue a tender in coming months and
expects to receive letters of interest from several
institutions, including the  European Investment Bank ,  World Bank 
and the  Arab Monetary Fund , within two weeks, the Amman-based
 newspaper  reported.  The 950-kilometer (590-mile) network will connect Jordan
with Syria, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, the  newspaper  said. Annual
revenue from the rail line should rise to 375 million in 2020
from 229 million dinars in 2015, the Times said, citing a study
by  BNP Paribas  SA.  Construction of the railway is expected to create 5,000
jobs and will provide the government with an 11.1 percent annual
return on its investment, the  newspaper  added, citing Qudah.  To contact the reporter on this story:
