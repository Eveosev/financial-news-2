Australian Prime Minister  Julia
Gillard  said pricing for her carbon emissions trading program
will be decided before it gets under way, as business and
political opposition grew to the plan.  Gillard wants to set a carbon price from next July ahead of
a trading program that could begin as early as 2015. The
opposition Liberal-National coalition has vowed to repeal the
the plan, which it claims would raise household electricity
prices A$300 ($306) per year.  “We need to price carbon and the best way of doing that is
an emissions trading scheme where the market sets the price for
carbon,” Gillard told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio. “We
will have a fixed price from the start.”    Heather Ridout , head of the Australian Industry Group
business association, today said companies were “concerned”
about the plan and were reluctant to invest without certainty
about its prospects. The comments echo Paul O’Malley, chief
executive officer of  Australia ’s biggest steelmaker  Bluescope
Steel Ltd ., who said the plan was “economic vandalism.”  Gillard’s multi-party climate change committee, formed
after a request of the Greens party, released a framework on
Feb. 25 that didn’t fix a price or give a level of compensation
to be paid to households and companies. The government needs the
support of four non-party lawmakers to pass the laws through the
parliament.  To contact the reporter on this story:
