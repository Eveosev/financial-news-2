Western Canada Select, a heavy crude
blend from  Alberta , strengthened to the highest level in almost
two months as increased rail transport of the oil reduced
available supplies.  Canadian rail freight car loads of petroleum products rose
45 percent from a year ago to 5,934 in the week ended July 7,
Association of American Railroads data shows.  Cenovus Energy
Inc. (CVE)  is also shipping almost 5,000 barrels a day of oil by rail
to the  Gulf Coast  to capture higher prices, Paul Reimer, a
senior vice president, said July 4.  Western Canada Select gained $3.25 to $16.75 a barrel below
West Texas Intermediate at 2:01 p.m. in  New York , according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the smallest discount to the
benchmark since May 25.  Syncrude’s discount was unchanged at $1.15. Syncrude is a
synthetic oil upgraded from tarlike bitumen in Alberta into
refinery-ready crude.  Bakken oil was steady at $5.75 below the U.S. benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI increased 95 cents
to $18.15 a barrel, the largest gap since April 19. Heavy
Louisiana Sweet gained 85 cents to $17.85 over.  Poseidon’s premium increased $1.60 to $13.50 a barrel,
while Southern Green Canyon rose $1.55 to $13 over WTI. Mars
Blend increased 95 cents to $13.70 a barrel over the U.S.
benchmark.  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower sulfur content than
Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon, increased $1.25 to a
$16.85 a barrel premium.  To contact the reporter on this story:
