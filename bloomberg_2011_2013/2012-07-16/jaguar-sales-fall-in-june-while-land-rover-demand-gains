Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , India’s biggest
automaker, said June sales of its Jaguar brand vehicles declined
while  Land Rover  deliveries rose, driven by demand for the
Evoque compact sport utility vehicle.  Total deliveries at the Jaguar Land Rover unit, which
counts sales of both brands, climbed 39 percent last month from
a year earlier to 28,215 units, Mumbai-based Tata Motors said in
a statement today. That compared with the 28,658 average
estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News. Jaguar
deliveries fell 5 percent to 3,829 units, while Land Rover sales
gained 49 percent to 24,386.  The Jaguar Land Rover unit, based in Gaydon,  England , has
increased its contribution to Tata Motors’ revenue as emerging-
market sales help counter a slowdown in  Europe . Tata Motors
plans to invest 2 billion pounds ($3.1 billion) in the unit this
year to develop new models and expand factories to cater to
rising demand in China and Russia.  Tata Motors fell 1.7 percent to 231.90 rupees as of 2:10
p.m. in Mumbai trading, headed for the lowest close since June
14. The shares have gained 30 percent this year, compared with a
11 percent increase in the benchmark  Sensitive Index. (SENSEX)   The unit is in discussion with a number of parties about
producing vehicles in Brazil, the company said in a separate
statement. The Financial Times reported that the company is in
talks to build the Freelander vehicle from kits imported to
 Brazil  from the U.K., citing an interview with Chief Executive
Officer Ralf Speth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
