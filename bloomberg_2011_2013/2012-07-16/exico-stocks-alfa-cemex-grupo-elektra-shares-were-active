The following companies had unusual
price changes in Mexico City trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the close of trading.  The IPC index rose 1 percent to 40,910.80.  Alfa SAB (ALFAA)  , which controls Mexico’s largest
publicly traded petrochemical company, pared earlier gains of as
much as 0.6 percent and closed up 0.3 percent at 216.51 pesos.
The company said in a mid-day report that second-quarter net
income fell 33 percent as the peso weakened, increasing
financing costs.  Grupo Elektra SA (ELEKTRA*)  , the retail and banking
company controlled by billionaire  Ricardo Salinas , surged 7
percent to 595.90 pesos. Elektra has surged 46 percent since
saying June 19 that it unwound some stock derivatives contracts,
spurring optimism it will meet conditions to remain on the
nation’s benchmark index.  Cemex SAB (CEMEXCPO)  , the largest cement maker in the
Americas, fell 1 percent to 8.95 pesos. Retail sales in the
U.S., once Cemex’s biggest market by sales, unexpectedly fell
for a third month in June as limited employment gains took a
toll on consumers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
