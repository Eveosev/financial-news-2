Braskem SA (BRKM5) , a Brazilian
petrochemicals company, is maintaining all investments approved
for 2012, which amount to approximately 1.7 billion reais
($835.4 million), investor relations vice-president Marcelo Lyra
said.  Newspaper Valor Economico reported today that Braskem would
postpone the construction of three plants worth about 1 billion
reais as the global petrochemical industry is only expected to
start improving in 2013, citing Chief Executive Officer Carlos Fadigas.  “We are not postponing any project our board approved for
2012,” Lyra said in a phone interview from Sao Paulo. “The
plants the newspaper mentions are still in a very preliminary
stage, and the studies continue.”  Braskem fell 3.1 percent to 11.65 reais while Brazil’s
benchmark Bovespa index lost 1.7 percent to 53,401.80 today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
