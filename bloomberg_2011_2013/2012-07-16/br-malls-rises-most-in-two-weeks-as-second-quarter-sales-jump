BR Malls Participacoes SA (BRML3) , a
Brazilian shopping mall manager, jumped the most in two weeks
after reporting sales climbed more than 20 percent in the second
quarter.  Shares gained 3.8 percent to 22.10 reais at the close in
Sao Paulo, the most since July 3. The benchmark Bovespa index
fell 1.7 percent.  BR Malls’s sales increased to 4.6 billion reais ($2.26
billion) in the April-to-June period from 3.7 billion reais in
the same period last year, according to a regulatory filing
today.  “Investors expect the retail sector to slow down, but BR
Malls still shows good numbers as a result of its strategy to
build more shopping centers,” Sandra Peres, an analyst at
brokerage Coinvalores, said by phone from  Sao Paulo .  BR Malls has gained 22 percent this year, while the Bovespa
declined 5.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
