South Africa’s most active white-
corn futures climbed by the limit to the highest on record as
drought curbs crops in the U.S., driving the global price to a
more than 10-month high.  White corn for December delivery advanced 80 rand, or 3.1
percent, to 2,700 rand ($326) a metric ton by the noon close on
the South African Futures Exchange in Johannesburg. The yellow
variety for delivery in the same month rose 3.1 percent to 2,641
rand a ton, the highest for a most active contract on a closing
basis since Jan. 26.  Corn climbed to $7.715 a bushel on the Chicago Board of
Trade after the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  cut its outlook
for production of the grain by 12 percent, a month after
predicting a record harvest. The U.S. is the world’s biggest
exporter.  “The drought in the U.S. is affecting local prices,”
Benjamin Swanepoel, a trader at Trademar Futures Ltd., said by
phone from Johannesburg. “Guys are starting to compare this to
the drought of 1988.”  About 40 percent of the U.S. corn crop was in good or
excellent condition as of July 8, down from 48 percent a week
earlier and the lowest for this time of year since a drought in
1988, the USDA said July 9.  More than 1,000 counties in 26 states are being named
natural-disaster areas, the biggest such declaration ever by the
USDA, as drought grips the Midwest, making farmers eligible for
low-interest loans to help them cope.  South Africa  is the continent’s biggest corn producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
