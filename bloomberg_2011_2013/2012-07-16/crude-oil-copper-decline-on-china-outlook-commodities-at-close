The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities rose 0.3 percent to 622.83 at 5:02 p.m. Singapore
time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials advanced
0.2 percent to 1536.63.  CRUDE OIL  Oil fell from the highest close in more than a week after
Premier Wen Jiabao said  China ’s economic recovery hasn’t gained
momentum, stoking speculation that demand may ease in the
world’s second-biggest crude consumer.  Oil for August delivery dropped as much as 64 cents to
$86.46 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  and was at $86.69 at 9:13 a.m.  London  time. The
contract gained 1.2 percent to $87.10 on July 13, the highest
close since July 5. Prices are 12 percent lower this year.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas futures were little changed in  New York  after
rising 3.5 percent last week.  OIL PRODUCTS  The premium of gasoil, or diesel, to Asian marker Dubai
crude rose 45 cents to $16.88 a barrel at 11:30 a.m. Singapore
time, according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker.
This crack spread, a measure of processing profit, widened for
the first time in three days.  Gasoil swaps for August climbed 35 cents, or 0.3 percent,
to $115.35 a barrel, PVM said. That’s the highest since May 31.
Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil gained 10 cents to 95 cents, the
highest in six days. An increased regrade shows it is more
profitable to produce  aviation fuel  over diesel.  High-sulfur  fuel oil  fell 21 cents to $2.21 a barrel below
Dubai oil, according to PVM. That’s the largest discount since
June 5, indicating widening losses for refiners turning crude
into residual products.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold is set to decline in London on speculation  Europe ’s
debt crisis will strengthen the dollar, curbing demand for the
metal as an alternative investment. Bullion for immediate
delivery fell 0.2 percent to $1,586.35 an ounce by 9:24 a.m. in
London. August-delivery futures were 0.4 percent lower at
$1,585.70 on the Comex in New York.  Silver for immediate delivery fell 0.4 percent to $27.2075
an ounce. Palladium declined 0.8 percent to $580.35 an ounce.
Platinum was down 0.3 percent at $1,426.25 an ounce.  BASE METALS  Copper snapped a three-day rally after China’s Premier  Wen
Jiabao  said that the momentum for a recovery in economic growth
isn’t yet in place, increasing speculation demand may decline in
the world’s largest user.  The metal for delivery in three months lost as much as 0.5
percent to $7,661 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange,
before trading at $7,679.25 at 3:18 p.m. in  Shanghai . The metal
for delivery in October closed 0.7 percent higher at 56,170  yuan 
($8,807) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange.  On the LME, zinc declined 0.3 percent to $1,868 a ton, tin
lost 0.7 percent to $18,650 a ton and nickel fell 0.3 percent to
$16,112 a ton. Aluminum and lead were little changed at $1,908 a
ton and $1,878 a ton, respectively.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Corn for December delivery climbed as much as 4.2 percent
to $7.7125 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the highest
price for a most-active contract since Aug. 31, and traded at
$7.705 at 2:42 p.m. in  Singapore . Wheat traded at the highest
price since February 2011 and soybean meal rose to a record.  Soybeans for November delivery rose as much as 2.7 percent
to $15.9375 a bushel, the highest price since July 2008, and
were at $15.92. Soybean meal -- the best performer this year out
of 80 commodities tracked by Bloomberg -- traded at $467.30 per
2,000 pounds, the highest level ever, after gaining as much as
3.1 percent. The meal is fed to pigs, cattle and poultry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
