President Giorgio Napolitano will
ask  Italy ’s highest court to rule on the constitutionality of
investigations by prosecutors in Palermo who wiretapped his
office’s phone conversations.  Napolitano decided to raise the challenge after deeming the
use of wiretapping by prosecutors “as harming the prerogatives
of the President as determined by the Constitution,” his office
said in an e-mailed statement today.  Prosecutors in Palermo, investigating alleged relations
between the Sicilian mafia and state officials in the early 90s,
wiretapped conversations between former Interior Minister Nicola
Mancino and Napolitano’s office, newspapers including Il Fatto
Quotidiano reported last month. Mancino was minister at the time
of the anti-mafia prosecutor Paolo Borsellino’s assassination in
1992.  To contact the reporter on this story:
