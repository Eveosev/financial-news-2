The European Union loan of as much
as 100 billion euros ($122.3 billion) to bail out Spanish banks
will have a 30-year maturity and an interest rate of 2.5

which will include a 10-year grace period, “practically
agreed” but the final conditions will not be known until July
20 when the final bailout agreement is scheduled to be signed by
European Union finance ministers, the newspaper added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
