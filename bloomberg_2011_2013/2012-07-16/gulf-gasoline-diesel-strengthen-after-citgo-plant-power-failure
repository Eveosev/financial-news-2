Gasoline and diesel in the U.S. Gulf
Coast strengthened after Citgo Petroleum Corp.’s Corpus Christi
East refinery reported a  power failure .  The plant had power restored after a failure last night,
Citgo said in an e-mailed statement. The East and West plants on
the Gulf of Mexico operate as separate components of a single
refinery with a capacity of 165,000 barrels a day.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast narrowed 0.12 cent to 18.13 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 11:09
a.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s the first
gain in three days. Prompt delivery gained 1.84 cents to $2.652
a gallon.  The premium for ultra-low-sulfur diesel  at the hub  versus
heating oil futures rose 0.38 cent to 7.13 cents a gallon.  Phillips 66 (PSX)  completed maintenance at the Sweeny refinery in
Texas,  Rich Johnson , a Houston-based spokesman, said in an e-
mail.  The 247,000-barrel-a-day plant reported emissions from a
coker and fluid catalytic cracker No. 3 on July 11, according to
a filing with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.  To contact the reporter on this story:
