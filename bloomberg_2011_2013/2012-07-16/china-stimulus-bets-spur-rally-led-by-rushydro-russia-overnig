Russian  stock-index futures  rose and
the nation’s equities traded in the U.S. posted the longest
string of weekly gains since March, on prospects new stimulus
measures in  China  will boost demand for commodities.  Futures expiring in September on the dollar-denominated RTS
index added 0.3 percent to 136,475 on July 13. The  Bloomberg
Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  of the most-traded Russian companies in
New York rose 0.7 percent to 89.56, bringing last week’s advance
to 0.6 percent.  OAO RusHydro (RSHYY) , the nation’s biggest hydropower
company, had the largest weekly gain in five weeks while  OAO
Surgutneftegas (SGTPY) ,  Russia ’s fourth-largest oil producer, climbed to
the highest level since July 5.  Oil rose in New York last week and  commodities  climbed to
the highest level in two months as slowing growth in China
fueled speculation of more stimulus measures. Russia, the
world’s biggest energy producer and the largest exporter of
nickel and palladium, said China accounted for about 10 percent
of the country’s foreign trade in the first four months of 2012.  “Once approved, Chinese stimulus measures will lead to a
growing appetite for commodities,” Slava Smolyaninov, chief
strategist at UralSib Capital in Moscow, said by phone on July
13. Russian stocks benefit from a growing demand as “oil is
very important for the budget and to the ruble,” he said.  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the biggest U.S.-traded
exchange-traded fund that holds Russian shares, rose 1.7 percent
to $26.33 on July 13. The RTS Volatility Index, which measures
expected swings in the index futures, fell 5.3 percent to 31.71.  Risky Assets  China’s economic expansion slowed for a sixth quarter,
growing at 7.6 percent in the April-June period, data from the
National Bureau of Statistics showed last week. That compares
with an 8.1 percent gain in the previous quarter period and the
7.7 percent median forecast of economists. Industrial production
increased at a slower pace in June while retail sales growth
decelerated.  Premier  Wen Jiabao  said last week China will focus on
promoting investment growth in order to stabilize economic
expansion. Wen said the government will step up policy fine-
tuning in the second half of the year to support growth, the
official Xinhua News Agency reported yesterday.  “Stimulus measures fuel appetite for all kinds of risky
assets, you name it: energy, raw materials,” Smolyaninov said.
“The rally may quickly fade, because investors’ focus will then
switch to see whether the measures work and actually help
sustain growth.”  United Co. Rusal (486) , the world’s largest aluminum producer,
dropped 1.4 percent to HK$4.21 in Hong Kong trading as of 10:37
a.m. local time. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 0.2 percent
today amid speculation China will take more steps to bolster its
economy.  RusHydro Gains  American depositary receipts of Moscow-based RusHydro
jumped 6.4 percent to $2.58. RusHydro climbed 1.6 percent to
85.86 kopeks, or 2.64 U.S. cents, in Moscow on July 13. One
depositary receipt equals 100 Moscow-listed shares.  American depositary receipts of Surgutneftegas rose 1
percent to $5.93 in  new York  on July 13. The  stock  gained 1
percent in Moscow to 19.162 rubles, or 59 U.S. cents. One ADR is
equal to 10 Moscow-listed shares.  Russia, the world’s largest oil producer outside of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, received about
half of its 2011 budget revenue from sales of oil and natural
gas, according to government data.  China is the world’s second-biggest oil consumer after the
U.S., using 9.76 million barrels a day in 2011, according to BP
Statistical Review of World Energy.  Russia-China Trade  Russia’s trade with China reached $27.4 billion in the
January-to-April period, nearly 10 percent of the $269.5 billion
in exports and imports, according to Russia’s Federal Service of
State Statistics.  CTC Media Inc. (CTCM) , the Nasdaq-listed Russian television
company, advanced for the first time in 12 weeks, ending the
longest decline since the stock was listed in New York in 2006.
Deutsche Bank AG recommended investors buy CTC Media shares,
according to a July 12 report, revising its earlier
recommendation to hold the stock.  Oil for August delivery rose 1.2 percent to $87.10 a barrel
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  on July 13, for a weekly
gain of 3.1 percent. Prices have fallen 12 percent this year.  Brent for August settlement added 1.3 percent to $102.40 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. Urals
crude, Russia’s main export blend, increased 2.1 percent to
$102.13 per barrel on July 13, gaining for third consecutive
week. Urals ended the week above $100 per barrel for the first
time since the five days to May 25.  Oil may fall this week on concern weaker economic growth
may reduce fuel demand, a Bloomberg survey showed. Fourteen of
34 analysts, or 41 percent, forecast crude will drop through
July 20. Twelve respondents, or 35 percent, predicted that
futures will rise and eight said there will be little change in
prices.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index gained 1 percent to
621.190 on July 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
