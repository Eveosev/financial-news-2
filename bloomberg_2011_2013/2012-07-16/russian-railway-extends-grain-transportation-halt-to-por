OAO Russian Railways extended a
stoppage of grain transportation to terminals in the Black Sea
port of Novorossiysk until July 18 to avoid delays, Dmitry
Pertsev, a spokesman for the company, said today by phone in
Moscow.  The company halted grain shipments to the port on July 9
after flooding damaged a bridge, and diverted rail-cars to
Tuapse, another Black Sea port.  Flash floods in the southern Krasnodar region killed 172
people over the weekend of July 7 and slowed the movement of
rail-cars. OAO Novorossiysk Commercial Sea Port said July 9 it
had to use grain from its silo to load ships.  The flooding didn’t affect grain crops, Krasnodar’s
regional agriculture ministry said on July 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
