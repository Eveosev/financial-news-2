More than half of Europe’s money
market funds by assets have closed because securities they
invest in pay negative returns after the  European Central Bank 
cut interest rates, according to Standard & Poor’s.  Funds with assets totalling 79 billion euros ($96 billion)
have closed, out of a pool of 133 billion euros rated by the New
York-based firm, S&P said in a report.  Investor demand for haven assets sent yields on short-term
government bonds from France, Germany, Austria and Belgium
tumbling to all-time lows after the ECB cut its main refinancing
rate a quarter-percentage point to 0.75 percent and its deposit
rate to zero on July 5.  JPMorgan Chase & Co., (JPM)  the world’s
biggest provider of money market funds, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
and  BlackRock Inc. (BLK)  either closed their European funds to new
investment or restricted deposits.  “The rate cuts have hardened conditions for European  money
market funds , which have been coping with the prospect of near-
zero or negative yields for most of 2012,” S&P analysts led by
Andrew Paranthoiene wrote in the report published today.
“European money market fund providers have taken practical
steps to protect their funds from yield dilution.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
