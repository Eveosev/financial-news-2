The barley harvest in northwest
 Germany  was interrupted by rain after starting earlier this
month, agriculture lobby Bundesverband der Agrargewerblichen
Wirtschaft e.V. reported.  Farmers in the region of  Lower Saxony  began cutting barley
grown in sandy soils at the start of July, the BVA wrote in a
 report  on its website today. The main German harvest will start
once rains subside, the group said.  “Now farmers need several weeks of dry weather in order to
bring in the grain harvest in security and without quality
loss,” the BVA wrote.  Thunderstorms over the weekend caused “major damage” in
Brandenburg and harvest work had to be interrupted because
fields were no longer accessible, according to the BVA. Barley
harvesting in eastern Germany started last week, and there are
“large worries” about crop losses, the group said.  It’s unclear when flooded fields will be passable again,
the BVA wrote. There’s a “great risk” of mold in wheat and
rye, which are not ready for harvesting, and increased incidence
of aphids and powdery mildew because of the weather, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
