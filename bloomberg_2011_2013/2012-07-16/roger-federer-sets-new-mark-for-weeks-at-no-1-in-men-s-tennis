Wimbledon champion  Roger Federer 
broke the all-time record for most weeks at the top spot in
men’s tennis today with 287 weeks.  The Swiss, who has won a men’s record 17 Grand Slam singles
titles, regained the top ranking on the ATP World Tour last week
after he beat Britain’s  Andy Murray  in the finals of Wimbledon.
That win tied him with Pete Sampras’ 286-week mark at No. 1.   “I am extremely proud and honored to have beaten Pete’s
record as he was my childhood hero and I have always looked up
to him,” Federer said in a statement on the ATP website.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
