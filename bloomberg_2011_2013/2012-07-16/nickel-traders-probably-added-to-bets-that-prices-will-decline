Nickel traders probably added to
wagers on falling prices last week as the number of outstanding
futures contracts climbed to the highest in at least seven years
at the same time as prices declined.  Open interest  in London Metal Exchange nickel futures rose
by 9,160 contracts to 176,378 lots in the week to July 12, the
highest level since at least September 2005, exchange data today
show. Nickel for delivery in three months, the benchmark
contract, declined 5.5 percent over the period. One contract is
for 6 metric tons of the metal used to make stainless steel.  A combination of higher open interest and lower prices
suggests bets on a falling market, according to Macquarie Group
Ltd. Nickel slumped on July 12 as much as 2 percent to $15,770 a
ton, the lowest price since December 2009.  Open interest in copper, zinc and lead all fell as prices
declined, suggesting long positions were being liquidated.
Aluminum open interest rose at the same time prices fell,
suggesting new bets on lower prices.  Following are changes to market open interest for LME
members and clients compiled by the exchange for the six biggest
industrial metals futures traded on the bourse in the week ended
July 12, along with price changes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
