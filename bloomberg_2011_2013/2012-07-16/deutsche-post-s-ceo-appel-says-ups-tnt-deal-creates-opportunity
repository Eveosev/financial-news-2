Frank Appel, chief executive officer
of  Deutsche Post AG (DPW) , comments on rival United Parcel Service
Inc.’s proposed acquisition of  TNT Express NV. (TNTE)  He also talked
about  China’s economy  and domestic express delivery in the
country.  Deutsche Post’s DHL and partner Sinotrans Air
Transportation Development Co. sold their money losing domestic
express delivery operations in China last year to instead focus
on international shipments.  Appel spoke in Hong Kong today.  On UPS-TNT deal:  “If two competitors are integrating, that creates
opportunities for the market leader. When they are busy
internally, we will be busy with our customers, which I think is
a significant competitive advantage.”  On China’s economy:  “There’s volatility in the short term around the world
that includes China. But the long-term fundamental trend that
China will get a significantly bigger share of the global GDP
will continue. There’s a huge rising population of middle class
that want to spend their money and that creates a lot of
domestic demand.”  On China domestic express delivery:  “We’ve currently no plan to do the domestic express
business again because there is a law that doesn’t allow that
and there are very strong domestic players already in place.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
