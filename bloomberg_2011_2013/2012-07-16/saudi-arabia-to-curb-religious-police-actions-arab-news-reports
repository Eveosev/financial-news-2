Saudi Arabia  will implement rules to
prevent religious police from chasing individuals,  Arab News 
said, citing Sheikh Abdul Latif al-Asheikh, president of the
Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice.  The action was taken because of negative public reaction to
religious police pursuing individuals, the newspaper cited al-
Asheikh as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
