Colombia’s government has no urgent
need to sell part of its 88.5 percent stake in state-controlled
oil company Ecopetrol SA, President  Juan Manuel Santos  said.  “We’re not in a hurry with that,” Santos said in an
interview aboard his presidential airplane on July 14. “It
depends on the world markets, it depends on the financing, but
today we don’t really need it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
