KfW IPEX Bank GmbH, the export
credit unit of Germany’s development lender KfW Group, and
 Svenska Handelsbanken  AB will loan 200 million euros ($244
million) to a U.K. project to create energy from waste.  The loan will help finance construction of the 250 million-
euro project in Plymouth, southern  England , according to a
statement today from KfW IPEX, based in  Frankfurt  am Main.  MVV Energie AG (MVV1)  is building the facility, which will provide
as much as 22.5 megawatts of heat energy and 23.3 megawatts of
electricity to the Royal Navy base at Devonport, which is the
largest naval base in western Europe. It will burn about 265,000
tons of household and commercial waste a year.  The U.K. government aims to use 25 percent of municipal
waste in England for energy by 2020, up from 11 percent in 2007,
as it seeks to comply with a European Union directive limiting
waste to landfill, according to the  Environment Agency ’s
website.  KfW IPEX and Stockholm-based Svenska Handelsbanken
contributed equal shares to the loan for the public-private
sector venture, which is overseen by the South West Devon Waste
Partnership, a group of three regional authorities.  “It’s a long  term loan ,” said Marcus Jentsch, head of
finance and investor relations at MVV Energie. A further 50
million euros will be raised through equity, he said.  Jentsch said the loan would be partially replaced by
European Investment Bank funding when it expired, which would be
before the end of MVV Energie’s 25-year tenure of the plant.  “They will simply substitute parts of the loan,” he said.
“They have very attractive rates, so commercially it makes
sense.”  The EIB will invest up to 110 million pounds, according to
its website.  Construction began earlier this year, and the plant is due
to be operational in 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
