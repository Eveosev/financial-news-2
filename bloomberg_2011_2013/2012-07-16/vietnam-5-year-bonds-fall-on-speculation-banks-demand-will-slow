Vietnam ’s five-year bonds fell for a
seventh day, pushing the yield to a two-month high, on
speculation banks’ demand will slow as policy makers take steps
to spur lending. The dong was steady.  The State Bank of Vietnam will punish lenders that continue
to charge  interest rates  above 15 percent on existing loans from
today, Lao Dong newspaper reported, citing Nguyen Hoang Minh,
deputy head of the central bank’s  Ho Chi Minh City  branch. The
State Treasury will offer 1 trillion dong ($48 million) of two-
year bonds and 2 trillion dong of five-year debt at an auction
on July 19, according to a statement on the Hanoi Stock
Exchange’s website.  “Supply is going to be higher and in the last six months
of this year, banks will lend out more,” said Nguyen Tan Thang,
head of fixed-income research at  Ho Chi Minh City Securities
Corp. (HCM)  “Less money will be available for bond trading and
investment.”  The yield on benchmark five-year bonds rose three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 10.10 percent, according to
a daily fixing rate from banks compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the
highest level since May 4.  The Treasury sold a total of 1.15 trillion dong of two-,
three- and five-year securities on July 12.  The dong traded at 20,863 per dollar as of 3:37 p.m. in
Hanoi, compared with 20,865 on July 13, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The  State Bank  of Vietnam set its
 reference rate  at 20,828, unchanged since Dec. 26, according to
its website. The currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on
either side of the rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
