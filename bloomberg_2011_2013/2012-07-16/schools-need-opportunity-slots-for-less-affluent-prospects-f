In redressing the imbalance between
the economically advantaged and the disadvantaged, it may be
well to change the focus from inequalities in outcomes to
inequalities in opportunity, specifically in education,  Lawrence
Summers  wrote in the Financial Times.  The most-effective move in that regard would be to improve
public education so that “every child in the public system can
learn as much and go as far” as his or her talent permits, the
former U.S. Treasury secretary wrote.  “The best institutions” must undertake “the kind of
commitment to economic diversity that they have long mounted”
toward racial diversity, the Charles W. Eliot professor at
 Harvard University  wrote.  While it is unrealistic to imagine that universities will
not be attentive to the children of their financial supporters,
perhaps “the custom could be established that for each ‘legacy
slot,’ room would be made for one ‘opportunity slot,’’ Summers
wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
