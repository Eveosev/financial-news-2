Serena Williams  tied sister Venus
with her 43rd WTA Tour tennis title by beating fellow American
Coco Vandeweghe in straight sets at Bank of the West Classic.  Williams, 30, didn’t drop a set at the event in Stanford,
California, and defeated Vandeweghe 7-5, 6-3 yesterday in the
hardcourt final to defend her title and win back-to-back
tournaments following her victory at Wimbledon.  Williams’s 43 titles are tied with Venus, 32, for the most
among active players and she also pulls even with  Martina Hingis 
and Justine Henin for the 10th-most in the Open era.  “I’ve never felt this fit, this strong, this happy to
play,” Serena Williams said in comments released by the WTA
Tour. “I want to sustain this momentum and build on what I did
at Wimbledon. I’m going to get back on the grass now for the
Olympics. I’m not sure when I’m heading back to London, but I’ll
do it as soon as I can.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
