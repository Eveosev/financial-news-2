Iraq  will reduce its daily exports
of Basrah Light crude from the  Persian Gulf  by 3.8 percent in
the second half of July compared with the previous two weeks, a
loading program obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  The  nation  will ship 24 cargoes from the Basrah Oil
Terminal, compared with 18 in the first half of this month,
according to the plan. Exports will total 33.6 million barrels,
or 2.1 million barrels a day, compared with 2.19 million a day
two weeks earlier.  The program for the second half of July comprises 11
consignments of 2 million barrels each, seven 1 million-barrel
shipments, and six lots ranging from 300,000 barrels to 1.7
million barrels.  Loading programs are schedules of crude shipments compiled
by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan their
supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
