South Korea’s won advanced for a
second day as China’s Premier  Wen Jiabao  signaled further steps
are needed to support economic growth.  Government bonds  were
little changed.  Wen warned the momentum for a recovery isn’t yet in place
in South Korea’s largest export market, adding that the
government needs to comprehensively assess the situation and
recognize the problems, the official Xinhua News Agency reported
yesterday. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will present
his semi-annual report on the outlook for the  U.S. economy  to
Congress this week. The Kospi Index climbed 0.3 percent after
U.S. shares gained the most in two weeks.  “There were some expectations for China stimulus in the
market, and the won was also supported by overseas funds selling
the dollar to buy Korean bonds,” said Cho Hyun Seok, a Seoul-
based currency trader for Standard Chartered Bank  Korea .  The won strengthened 0.3 percent to 1,147.00 per dollar at
the close in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency’s one-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-
rate swings used to price options, slid 28 basis points, or 0.28
percentage point, to 7.70 percent.  China’s gross domestic product expanded 7.6 percent in the
second quarter from a year earlier, the sixth consecutive
slowdown, the statistics bureau said on July 13. The Bank of
Korea reduced its 2012 economic-growth forecast to 3 percent
last week from the April projection for a 3.5 percent growth.  The yield on the government’s 3.25 percent bonds due June
2015 was unchanged at 2.95 percent, Korea Exchange Inc. prices
show. This matches the July 13 level which was the lowest for a
benchmark three-year  note  since December 2010. Three-year debt
futures slid 0.02 to 105.74 and the one-year interest-rate swap
climbed three basis points to 2.95 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
