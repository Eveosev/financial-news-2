Commerz Real AG plans to buy the
main asset of a fund it created to purchase the former
headquarters of  Deutsche Boerse  AG, operator of the Frankfurt
exchange, after failing to find a new tenant for the building.  The German property manager announced the plan in an
invitation to a July 19 shareholder meeting, at which investors
will vote on the proposal. Commerz Real needs to acquire the
assets of CFB-Fonds 130 Deutsche Boerse to prevent the fund from
filing for insolvency by July 23, according to the invitation.
The assets are valued at about 45 million euros ($55 million).  Commerz Real needs to win 75 percent of the votes cast at
the meeting to proceed with its plan.  Deutsche Boerse’s rental contract ended in April 2011,
according to the invitation. Commerz Real is in talks with a
company that may rent about half of the space, though this
probably won’t generate any income before 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
