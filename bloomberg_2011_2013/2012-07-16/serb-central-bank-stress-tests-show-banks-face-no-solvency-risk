Banks in  Serbia  face no solvency
risk, while currency weakness and an expanding bad-loan
portfolio could require some banks to boost their capital.  The National Bank of Serbia conducted stress tests, which
in a moderate scenario assumed a 15 percent dinar decline and an
increase in non-performing loans to more than 23 percent of
total credit. This would push the capital-adequacy ratio of
seven of the Balkan country’s 33 lenders below the regulatory
minimum of 12 percent and they would need 7.15 billion dinars
($76 million) to improve their capital adequacy, which is 2.6
percent of “assessed regulatory capital,” the bank said.  In a worst-case scenario, where the dinar drops 25 percent
and the bad-debt portfolio exceeds 25 percent, nine banks would
need 10.08 billion dinars in total to meet the capital rules,
which would be equivalent to 4.4 percent of estimated regulatory
capital of the entire sector at the end of 2012, according to
the central bank’s Financial Stability report.  To contact the reporters on this story:
