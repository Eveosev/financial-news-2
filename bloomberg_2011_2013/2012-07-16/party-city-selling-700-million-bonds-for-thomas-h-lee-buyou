Party City Corp., the largest U.S.
party-supplies retailer, is planning to sell $700 million of
bonds to help fund its buyout by Thomas H. Lee Partners LP.  The company, which filed for an IPO last year, may sell
eight-year notes to yield about 9.125 percent, according to a
person familiar with the transaction. Proceeds also will be used
to repay debt.  The bonds may be rated Caa1, the fifth-lowest level of
speculative-grade, by Moody’s Investors Service, the ratings
company said in a July 13 release.  Bank of America Corp.,
Deutsche Bank AG, Barclays Plc, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
Morgan Stanley are managing the sale, said the person, who asked
not to be identified because the terms are private.  Party City has not previously issued bonds, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The bonds may price as soon as tomorrow, the person said.
The new bonds will be issued by PC Merger Sub.  Party City, which was founded in 1947 as a wholesale party
supplier,  filed  April 2011 to raise as much as $350 million in
an IPO that was never completed. Thomas H. Lee’s purchase gives
the private equity firm a majority stake in a chain with about
825 owned and franchised party superstores and about 400
temporary Halloween stores, according to an IPO prospectus filed
on May 10.  Party City’s existing owners -- Advent International Corp.,
Berkshire Partners LLC, Weston Presidio and company management -
- will hold minority stakes, Boston-based Thomas H. Lee said
June 5 in a statement announcing the agreement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
