The U.K.’s opposition  Labour Party 
will invite businesspeople to explore running for Parliament as
part of an effort to deal with its anti-corporate image.  Leader  Ed Miliband , who last year called for “producer”
and “predator” companies to be taxed differently, will today
announce a special stream of his party’s “Future Candidates
Program” for those from the private sector. Other streams focus
on women, people from ethnic minorities and the working classes.  Those in the program, who don’t need to be party members,
will be mentored by current Labour lawmakers.  “Our party -- all parties in fact -- must reflect what
Britain looks like and the jobs which people do,” the party’s
business spokesman, Chuka Umunna, said in an e-mailed statement.
“Not only do we want more people setting up businesses, leading
businesses and working in businesses, we want more people from
the world of business in our ranks.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
