The European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development plans to lend as much as 65 million euros ($79.5
million) to the city-owned municipal transport company in the
Serbian capital to renew its bus fleet.  The eight-year loan with two-year grace period, would help
 JKP Gradsko Saobracajno Preduzece Beograd , controlled by
Belgrade’s municipal government, purchase 280 18-meter long
buses and 120 buses powered by compressed natural gas, the
London-based lender said on its website.  Pending final review of the project, loan approval is
expected Sept. 18, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
