Restore Our Future, a super-
political action committee backing presumptive Republican
nominee Mitt Romney, raised a record $20 million in June,
spokeswoman Brittany Gross confirmed today.  The haul, which exceeds by double any previous month,
includes a $10 million check from Las Vegas casino billionaire
 Sheldon Adelson . Other donors will be included in a report to
the U.S. Federal Election Commission due by July 20.  Priorities USA Action, a super-PAC supporting President
Barack Obama, took in $6 million last month, co-founder  Bill Burton  told Bloomberg Television on July 13.  Both super-PACs are using most of their cash to air attack
ads in battleground states.  To contact the reporter on this story:
