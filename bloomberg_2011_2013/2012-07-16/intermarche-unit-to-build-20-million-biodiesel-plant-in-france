 France  awarded  BDI-BioEnergy International AG (D7I)  a 16.4 million-
euro ($20 million) commission to build and run a biodiesel plant
in  Le Havre , France, BDI said in a statement.  The plant will produce 75,000 metric tons of biodiesel
annually to be sold at filling stations operated by Intermarche,
one of France’s largest supermarket chains.  France, like other European Union member states, has a
target of 10 percent renewable energy use in transport by 2020.
The 27-nation group aims to use 20 percent renewable energy
overall by that date.  The BDI facility will run exclusively on waste materials
including animal fats and used cooking oils, making it greener
than ecoMotion’s  existing biodiesel facilities, which produce
200,000 metric tons of biodiesel annually using oils from crops
such as rapeseed. Investment in waste product biofuels is
encouraged by the EU Renewable Energy Directive, which sets
European targets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
