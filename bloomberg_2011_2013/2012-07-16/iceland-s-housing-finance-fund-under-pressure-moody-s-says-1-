Iceland’s Housing Finance Fund’s
rating is under pressure as its funding restrictions weigh on
its market share, Moody’s Investors Service said.  “Commercial banks’ non-inflation indexed loan issuance is
credit negative for HFF, constraining its market share and
franchise value,” Moody’s said. “It is credit positive for the
commercial banks, which are strengthening their balance sheets
and franchises through this collateralised household lending.”  The Baa3 rated government-owned lender reported a 40
percent decline in mortgage lending in the first half of 2012
from a year earlier, Moody’s said today in a weekly credit
outlook report. Lending fell and the  fund  lost market share to
commercial banks because it’s limited to inflation-linked
funding and loans, the rating company said.  HFF is preparing to start offering non-inflation linked
loans later this year, Chief Executive Officer Sigurdur
Erlingsson in a telephone interview. The fund still has a 60
percent market share for Icelandic mortgages and a “few
months” of declines doesn’t have a “significant impact on the
overall picture.”  Once HFF is able to offer homeowners loans which aren’t
indexed to inflation, the market will “seek its past balance,”
Erlingsson said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
