Repsol SA (REP)  and  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW)  will
plug and abandon an exploration well off Guyana after high
pressure prevented drilling. Their shares dropped.  The explorers started drilling the Jaguar-1 well in the
Georgetown Block in February. The well was halted at 4,876
meters (16,000 feet) “without reaching the primary objective,”
London-based Tullow said today in a statement.  The entry into Guyana was intended to open a new oil
frontier following Tullow’s success in  French Guiana  where an
estimated 840 million barrels were discovered. The partners were
drilling the well “close to the limits” because of high
pressure and temperatures, Repsol Chairman  Antonio Brufau  said
in May.  Repsol is the operator of the well with a 15 percent share.
Tullow and YPF SA each hold 30 percent, while CGX Energy Inc.
has the remaining 25 percent share. Samples of light oil were
recovered from the well.  “At least we now know the basin is oily,”  Oswald Clint , a
London-based analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co, wrote in an
e-mailed report. “The implication is merely a small increase to
exploration costs; and a delay to the eventual testing of the
prospect,” which may hold as much as 1.2 billion barrels of oil
equivalent resources, he said.  Tullow fell 2.2 percent to 1,402 pence at 2:20 p.m. local
time. Repsol retreated 3.1 percent to 12.245 euros in Madrid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
