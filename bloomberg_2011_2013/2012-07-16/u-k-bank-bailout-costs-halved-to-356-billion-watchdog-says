Taxpayer support for Britain’s banks
was almost halved to 228 billion pounds ($356 billion) in the
year through March, the government spending watchdog said.  The National Audit Office said government support for the
financial industry fell from 456 billion pounds in 2011 and from
1.2 trillion pounds at the height of the financial crisis. About
109 billion pounds of support for 2012 was on outstanding
guarantee commitments and 119 billion pounds was in cash, the
auditor said.  The fall in the share price this year at  Royal Bank of
Scotland Plc  and  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  have wiped 18 billion
pounds off the Treasury’s 66 billion-pound investment, said the
audit office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
