The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from non-payment decreased,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan slid 3 basis points to 161.5 basis
points as of 8:42 a.m. in  Hong Kong , according to Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc. The gauge is set for its lowest close since
July 4, according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index fell 2 basis points to
174.5 as of 10:36 a.m. in Sydney,  Australia  & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. prices show. The index is headed for its
lowest close since July 11, according to CMA, which is owned by
McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market.  Markets in Japan are closed today for a national holiday.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
