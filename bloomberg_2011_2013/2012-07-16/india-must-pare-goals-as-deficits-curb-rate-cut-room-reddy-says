India  needs to pare unrealistic
growth expectations as fiscal and current-account deficits
underscore risks in the economy and curb scope for interest-rate
cuts, a former central bank governor said.  “Many of the faster growing emerging-market economies don’t
have such a serious fiscal problem, most of them don’t have twin
deficits,” Yaga Venugopal Reddy said in an interview in Mumbai
today. “India has twin deficits, which means the starting point
is vulnerable. It’s time we reset expectations.”  Reserve Bank  of India Governor Duvvuri Subbarao refrained
from a rate cut in June even with economic expansion at a nine-
year low as inflation holds above 7 percent. Reddy said prior
annual increases in gross domestic product of about 9 percent
were “sort of overheating” and 7-8 percent is more normal,
adding excessive growth expectations have been “shattered.”  “The maneuverability for monetary policy action is
constrained, simultaneously, by the fiscal excesses and the
current-account deficit,” said Reddy, who ran the central bank
from 2003 to 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
