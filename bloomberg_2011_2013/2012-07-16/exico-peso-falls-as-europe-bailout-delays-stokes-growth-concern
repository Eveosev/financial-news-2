Mexico ’s peso bond yields fell to a
record low as an unexpected decline in U.S. retail sales stoked
speculation the  Federal Reserve  will take further steps to spur
growth in the world’s biggest economy.  The yield on Mexican local-currency bonds due in 2024
dropped three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 5.26
percent at 4 p.m. in Mexico City, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The bonds’ price increased 0.35 centavo to 143.13
centavos per peso. The peso rose 0.5 percent to 13.2192 per  U.S.
dollar .  Peso bonds rallied as retail sales in the U.S., the buyer
of about 80 percent of Mexican exports, unexpectedly declined
for a third straight month in June. The Fed has signaled that a
further slowdown would increase support among policy makers for
additional steps to lower borrowing costs and spur growth.  “The market is running with the notion that there’s
stimulus in the pipeline,” Alejandro Urbina, who manages and
advises on about $800 million of emerging-market assets at Silva
Capital Management, said by phone from  Chicago . “We’ve been
getting bad economic data.”  The 0.5 percent drop in U.S. retail sales last month
followed a 0.2 percent decline in May, Commerce Department
figures showed today in  Washington . The decline exceeded the
most pessimistic forecast in a Bloomberg News survey that called
for a median 0.2 percent increase in sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
