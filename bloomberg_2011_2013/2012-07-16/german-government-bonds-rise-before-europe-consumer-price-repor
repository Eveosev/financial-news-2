German bonds rose, with two-year
yields dropping to a record for a third day, as a euro-area
report showing  inflation  held at the slowest since February 2011
added to signs the region is headed for a recession.  Germany ’s  three-year yields  dropped below zero for the
first time and rates on Belgian, Dutch and French two-year notes
also declined to all-time lows as the debt crisis bolstered
demand for safer assets. The Netherlands and France both sold
bills at negative yields. Spanish and Italian bonds dropped,
with the extra yield investors demand to hold Italy’s 10-year
debt instead of Germany’s widening to the most since January.  “The general economic backdrop is poor, so people can’t
get too excited about the periphery,” said Eric Wand, a fixed-
income strategist at Lloyds Banking Group Plc in London.
“General risk sentiment is keeping the core underpinned and
investors are looking to rotate through the core and semi-core
to find yield.”  Germany’s two-year yield dropped one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to minus 0.055 percent at 4:22 p.m.  London 
time after falling to a record-low minus 0.06 percent. The zero
percent note due in June 2014 gained 0.025, or 25 euro cents per
1,000-euro ($1,223) face amount, to 100.105.  The three-year yield dropped as low as minus 0.022 percent,
and the five-year rate declined three basis points to 0.28
percent after falling to an all-time low 0.27 percent.  Core Nations  German  borrowing costs  have plunged over the past year as
investors sought the nation’s debt as a haven from  Europe ’s
financial turbulence. As yields declined, investors turned to
the securities of other so-called core and semi-core nations
seeking higher returns, pushing their borrowing rates lower.  Dutch two-year  yields fell one basis point to minus 0.01
percent after dropping to a record minus 0.015 percent. Similar-
dated French yields declined as low as 0.07 percent.  Belgium ’s
 two-year  rate dropped to an all-time low 0.254 percent.  The inflation rate in the 17-nation euro region stayed at
2.4 percent in June, the European Union’s  statistics office  said
in Luxembourg, confirming an initial estimate published on June
29. At least seven euro-member states are in recession and
Germany’s economy, which helped stem a region-wide contraction
in the first quarter, is also cooling.  French Auction  France sold 4 billion euros of 84-day bills at an average
yield of minus 0.015 percent, the  least  on record. The nation
also sold 161-day securities at minus 0.011 percent and 343-day
debt at minus 0.002 percent, both all-time auction lows,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Netherlands sold 105-day bills at a  record-low  rate of
minus 0.041 percent, and auctioned 7.6 billion euros of 84-,
161- and 343-day securities at negative yields. It raised 2.38
billion euros, less than its maximum target of 4 billion euros.  Volatility on Belgian government debt was the highest in
euro-area markets today, followed by Austria and  France 
according to measures of 10-year bonds, the spread between two-
and 10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  Spanish 10-year bonds fell for a third day, with the yield
rising 14 basis points to 6.80 percent. The nation’s two-year
rate climbed 19 basis points to 4.64 percent.  Spain  requested 100 billion euros of international aid for
its banks last month, becoming the fourth nation in the euro
region to seek assistance, after  Greece , Ireland and  Portugal .
Cyprus has also asked for aid.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Spanish 10-year
bonds instead of similar-maturity German bunds widened 17 basis
points to 557 basis points. The spread reached a record 589
basis points on June 18.  Italian Bonds  The yield on  Italy ’s 10-year bond increased five basis
points to 6.11 percent. The two-year rate climbed three basis
points to 3.65 percent.  The spread between Italian 10-year bonds and similar-
maturity German bunds widened as much as 15 basis points to 495
basis points, the most since Jan. 16.  Moody’s Investors Service lowered Italy’s credit rating by
two steps to Baa2 on July 13 and reiterated its negative
outlook. The rating company said further cuts were possible
because the economic outlook has “deteriorated.”  The  spread  between German two-year notes and 10-year bonds
may shrink to the narrowest in six weeks, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The difference, currently at 129 basis points, is below its
50-day moving average of 136 basis points and may target the
June 1 low of 113 basis points, the data show.  German bonds returned 4 percent this year, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Dutch bonds also rose 4 percent,
Italian securities gained 7.9 percent, while Spanish debt
dropped 4.5 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
