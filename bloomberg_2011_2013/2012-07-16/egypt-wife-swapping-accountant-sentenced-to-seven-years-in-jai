Cairo-area criminal court to seven years in prison with hard
labor, the state-run Ahram Gate website reported today.  Hossam Kamelâ€™s wife was sentenced to three years with hard
labor, the website reported. The two had been charged with
prostitution and setting up a wife-swapping website. Authorities
