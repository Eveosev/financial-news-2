The naira depreciated after the
 Central Bank  of Nigeria failed to meet accumulated demand for
dollars at an auction today, having sold the lowest amount of
the U.S. currency in more than two months last week.  The currency of  Africa ’s largest oil producer weakened 0.6
percent to 162.25 per dollar as of 3:18 p.m. on the  interbank
market  in Lagos, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The central bank sold $200 million at a foreign-currency
auction today, with lenders buying the entire amount on sale,
the Abuja-based bank said in an e-mailed statement. The
regulator sold $343.5 million last week, the least since the
five days to May 11. The bank said on July 6 it set a limit of
two business days for the use of foreign currency bought at its
twice-weekly auctions.  “The sale by the central bank is not enough to meet the
accumulated demand, so the naira remains under pressure,” Sewa
Wusu, a currency analyst at Lagos-based Sterling Capital Ltd.,
said by phone today.  Despite the central bank’s measures, “corporate demand is
still prevalent, which suggests that the naira will continue to
fluctuate in a broad range,” Celeste Fauconnier and Nema Ramkhelawan-Bhana, strategists at Rand Merchant Bank, wrote in a
report today.  Nigeria  approved a tender on June 27 to import 3.135
million metric tons of gasoline in the third quarter, the
Petroleum Products Pricing and Regulatory Agency said. The
country relies on imports to meet 70 percent of its fuel needs
because of inadequate refining capacity, Petroleum Minister
Diezani Alison-Madueke said in November.  Reserves  The country’s foreign-currency reserves have fallen by $1.2
billion since the end of May to $36.45 billion, according to
July 12 data compiled by the Abuja-based central bank.  The yield on Nigeria’s domestic 15.1 percent bonds due 2017
rose four basis points to 16.11 percent, according to July 13
data on the Financial Markets Dealers Association website.
Yields on the nation’s $500 million of Eurobonds due 2021
dropped eight basis points to 5.445 percent.  Ghana ’s cedi depreciated 0.4 percent to 1.955 per dollar in
Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
