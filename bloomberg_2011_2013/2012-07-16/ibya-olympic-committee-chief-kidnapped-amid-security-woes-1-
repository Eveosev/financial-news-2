The head of  Libya ’s Olympic
committee, Nabil al-Alam, was kidnapped and officials hope to
secure his release by tomorrow, the deputy head of the country’s
National Transitional Council said.  “We are now clearly coming close to securing the release
by the kidnappers,” Mustafa al-Houni told reporters at a news
conference with British Foreign Secretary  William Hague . “I
hope you will hear good news today or tomorrow.”  The U.K. diplomat said he was “concerned to hear” about
the abduction.  Al-Houni did not provide details about the kidnapping,
which underscored the challenges the central government in
Tripoli faces as it tries to restore order and security in the
oil-rich nation months after Muammar Qaddafi was deposed and
killed in a violent uprising.  Jacques Rogge , president of the  International Olympic
Committee , said he was concerned about the abduction and was in
contact with the Libyan Olympic committee about the incident.  Rogge said the international committee had few details on
the incident, aside from those reported in the media.  “The car which he drove was stopped by people dressed in
military outfits, and they have taken him for interrogation,”
he said in a conference call. “No one knows where he is for the
moment. Hopefully, this will evolve in the good way.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
