Cotton futures rose to a three-week
high as below-average rain spurred supply concerns in India, the
world’s second-biggest producer. Sugar also advanced, while
coffee, cocoa and orange juice fell.  The  India Meteorological Department  said yesterday that the
nation’s monsoon since June was 22 percent lower than the 50-
year average. Soaring U.S. corn, soybean and wheat prices may
spur farmers to shift away from cotton, which is down 20 percent
this year, said  Michael Smith , the president of T&K Futures &
Options in  Port St. Lucie , Florida.  “Any kind of weather that disrupts the crop is going to
have an impact after the way prices have fallen,” Smith said in
a telephone interview. “It adds to the uncertainty in the near
term” over supplies, he said.  Cotton for December delivery gained 0.9 percent to settle
at 73.3 cents a pound at 2:34 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York. Earlier, the price touched 73.4 cents, the highest for a
most-active contract since June 20.  The monsoon accounts for more than 70 percent of India’s
annual rainfall.  China  is the largest cotton consumer and
grower, and the U.S. is the top exporter.  Raw-sugar futures for October delivery rose 0.2 percent to
22.77 cents a pound in  New York .  Arabica-coffee futures for September delivery dropped 1.2
percent to $1.8395 a pound.  Cocoa futures for September delivery fell 0.9 percent to
$2,197 a metric ton.  Orange-juice futures for September delivery slipped 3.8
percent to $1.1795 a pound. Earlier, the price touched $1.1665,
the lowest since July 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
