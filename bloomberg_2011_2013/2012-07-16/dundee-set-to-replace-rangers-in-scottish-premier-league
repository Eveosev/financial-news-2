Dundee will be invited to replace
Rangers in soccerâ€™s Scottish Premier League, the SPL said in a
news release.  Rangers were dropped to the fourth tier of national soccer
in a vote of Scottish Football League clubs three days ago after
months of financial turmoil.  The 30 teams in the SFL, which oversees the three divisions
below the Premier League, voted to have the reformed Rangers
club start at the lowest level. The club went into liquidation
last month.  Dundee, runner-up in the second tier of Scottish soccer
last season, was chosen ahead of Dunfermline, relegated from the
SPL, for a place in the top division.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
