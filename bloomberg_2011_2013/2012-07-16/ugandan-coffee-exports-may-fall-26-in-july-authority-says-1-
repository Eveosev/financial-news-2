Coffee exports from Uganda, Africa’s
biggest exporter of the beans, may drop 26 percent this month
from a year earlier because of a smaller crop, the Uganda Coffee
Development Authority said.  Shipments may fall to 280,000 60-kilogram (132-pound) bags
from 376,173 bags a year earlier, the authority said today by e-
mail from Kampala, the capital.  The forecast is lower than the 275,057 bags shipped last
month because of a reduced harvest in the southern and
southwestern regions, the authority said.  The European Union,  Sudan , U.S., India,  Morocco ,  Ecuador ,
 Switzerland , Japan and  South Africa  are some of the major
importers of Uganda’s coffee, the agency says.  Uganda may export 3.1 million to 3.2 million bags in the
2011-12 season, which started on Oct. 1 and runs through
September, according to the authority. This compares with the
forecast of 2.8 million to 2.9 million given by National Union
of Coffee Agribusinesses and Farm Enterprises on May 8.  Shipments from October through June, the ninth month of the
season, dropped to 2.01 million bags worth $293.6 million, from
2.12 million bags valued at $300.6 million, the report said.
Last month’s exports were worth $36.6 million, it said.  The nation exported 3.15 million bags worth $448.9 million
in 2010-11, according to the authority. The Eastern Africa Fine
Coffee Association says Uganda consumes about 3 percent of its
annual crop.  Uganda was Africa’s biggest coffee exporter and the world’s
ninth-largest in the 12 months through last September, according
to the London-based International Coffee Organization. Robusta
beans, used in espressos and instant drinks, account for about
85 percent of Ugandan production, according to the authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
