Rubis may buy Petroplus Holdings
AG’s Reichstett fuel depot,  Les Echos  reported, citing Claude
Philipponneau, head of the refinery that used to operate at the
site.  Petroplus announced the shutdown and conversion of the
 refinery  to a terminal in October 2010 after failing to find a
buyer. A Strasbourg court is expected to rule Sept. 17 on the
future of the site, according to  Les Echos .  The delay in selling operations at Reichstett stems from a
lack of clarity over who is responsible for the site’s clean-up,
the newspaper said.  Rubis didn’t respond to a phone call and e-mail seeking
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
