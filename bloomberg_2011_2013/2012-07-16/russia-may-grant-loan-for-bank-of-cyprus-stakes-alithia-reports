Russia informed Cyprus that it’s
ready to grant a 5 billion-euro ($6.1 billion) loan if Russian
shareholders are allowed to increase their stakes in Bank of
Cyprus,  Alithia  reported.  Russian billionaire  Dmitry Rybolovlev , former owner of
fertilizer maker OAO Uralkali, has discussed increasing his
stake in Bank of Cyprus with the Cypriot government, the
Nicosia-based newspaper reported today without saying where it
got the information.  The move could take Rybolovlev’s holding above 9.9 percent,
requiring permission from the Cypriot central bank, Alithia
reported.  A Russian Finance Ministry official said the Alithia report
was inaccurate. The official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity in line with ministry rules, declined to elaborate.
Sergey Chernitsyn, a spokesman for Rybolovlev, declined to
comment when contacted by Bloomberg News.  Rybolovlev’s Odella Resources Ltd. owns 5.01 percent of
Bank of Cyprus, according to the lender’s  website . Rybolovlev is
behind Odella, Bank of Cyprus said in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
