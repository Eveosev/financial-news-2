An employee at a U.S. bank regulator
solicited prostitutes via government e-mail, according to the
Treasury Department’s internal watchdog.  The employee, from the now-defunct Office of Thrift
Supervision, used the agency’s e-mail “to communicate with
women offering a variety of adult/erotic services” and met with
prostitutes three times, the Treasury’s inspector general said
in a 2010 investigation. The report was posted this month on the
website governmentattic.org following a Freedom of Information
Act request.  The employee, a human resources specialist with 36 years in
the federal government, retired in October 2010 and wasn’t named
in the report.  The inspector general shared the information with the U.S.
Attorney’s Office for the  District of Columbia , “which declined
to accept the case for prosecution absent aggravating
circumstances,” according to the report.  In a separate incident, the inspector general found in 2010
that an examiner from the Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency accepted golf fees and food from executives at a bank
the OCC was inspecting.  The OCC “attaches great importance to ethical conduct by
all our employees, and we expect all OCC employees to meet these
high standards,” spokesman  Bryan Hubbard  said in an e-mail
today. “These are isolated incidences and do not diminish the
highly ethical behavior of thousands of other OCC employees.”  The OTS was a Treasury agency that became part of the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency last year. The
comptroller’s office is an independent Treasury bureau that
regulates U.S. banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
