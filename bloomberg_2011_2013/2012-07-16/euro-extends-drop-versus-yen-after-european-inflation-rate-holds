The dollar dropped to the lowest in
almost a month against the yen and erased gains versus the euro
as U.S. retail sales unexpectedly fell, adding to bets the
 Federal Reserve  is closer to a third round of asset purchases.  The euro touched a six-week low against the yen as
inflation in the currency bloc matched the lowest since February
2011. The  Dollar Index (DXY)  reversed an advance before Fed Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  testifies to Congress tomorrow, even as U.S.
five-year yields reached record lows. Higher-yielding currencies
including South Africa’s rand and Mexico’s peso rose as implied
 volatility  for currency options fell to an 11-week low.  “Lower yields, weaker  U.S. dollar , that’s consistent with
a market that’s expecting more easing from the Fed,” said Eric Viloria, senior currency strategist at Gain Capital Group LLC in
 New York . “Retail sales points at consumption, which is 70
percent of the  U.S. economy , and the last three negative prints
don’t paint a positive picture. We still think that there is
more downside for the euro versus the dollar.”  The dollar fell 0.4 percent to 78.87 yen at 5 p.m. in New
York and touched 78.69 yen, the lowest level since June 18. The
shared currency added 0.2 percent to $1.2273 after falling 0.6
percent earlier to $1.2176. It touched $1.2163 on July 13, the
lowest since June 2010. The yen appreciated 0.2 percent to 96.80
per euro and reached 96.17 yen, the strongest since June 1.  Dollar Index  The Dollar Index reversed gains after Commerce Department
data showed retail sales dropped for a third straight month in
June, falling 0.5 percent. The gauge, which Intercontinental
Exchange Inc. uses to track the greenback against the currencies
of six major U.S. trading partners, fell 0.3 percent to 83.349.
It rose 0.4 percent earlier.  The sales decrease was worse than the most-pessimistic
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey in which the median
projection called for a 0.2 percent rise.  Implied volatility  on three-month options for Group-of-
Seven currencies fell to 9.05 percent, the lowest level since
April 27, according to the JPMorgan G7  Volatility Index . Lower
volatility makes investments in currencies of nations with
higher benchmark  interest rates  more attractive because the risk
in such trades is that market moves will erase profits. The
average over the past year is 11.5 percent.  Rand Climbs  The South African rand was the best performer against the
dollar, rising 0.8 percent to 8.2025. The country’s key interest
rate is 5.5 percent. Mexico’s peso gained 0.5 percent to 13.2192
per dollar, while  Australia ’s currency advanced 0.2 percent to
$1.0249. Benchmark rates in Mexico and Australia are 4.5 percent
and 3.5 percent.  The MSCI World Index of stocks erased losses of as much as
0.4 percent before Bernanke testifies tomorrow to the Senate
Banking Committee, delivering his semiannual report on the
economy and monetary policy. He speaks to the House Financial
Services Committee the next day.  The Fed bought $2.3 trillion of Treasury and mortgage-
related securities from 2008 to 2011 in two rounds of a stimulus
strategy called quantitative easing.  The dollar tends to sell off before quantitative easing and
“rallies on the fact,”  Marc Chandler , currency strategist at
Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., said in a Bloomberg Television
interview on “Lunch Money.”  “That’s one of the reasons we only have the euro going
down to about $1.19 in the third quarter,” Chandler said.
“We’re concerned that the focus shifts back to the U.S. with
its QE, presidential elections, or its fiscal cliff. For all
those reasons, we look for the euro to have a better fourth
quarter than third quarter.” The “fiscal cliff” represents
tax increases and spending cuts that will take place unless
Congress reaches agreement on the nation’s finances.  Yield Drops  The dollar’s losses were tempered as investors sought
safety in U.S. Treasuries. U.S.  five-year note  yields fell to a
record 0.5770 percent.  Japan ’s currency rose versus the greenback as the extra
yield investors receive for investing in U.S. five-year debt
versus  comparable  Japanese  government bonds  fell to the lowest
since February, limiting dollar-denominated assets’ appeal. The
yield spread was 41 basis points, or 0.41 percentage point.  “U.S. Treasury yields are lower, the yen is benefiting and
it’s a relatively classic case of a ratcheting-up of Fed-easing
expectations,” said  Vassili Serebriakov , a currency strategist
at  Wells Fargo & Co . in New York.  Demand for refuge amid concern that global growth is
faltering and  Europe ’s debt crisis is worsening also drove
government-debt yields to record lows in the U.K.,  Canada ,
 France ,  Germany  and the Netherlands.  Merkel Stance  The rate of  inflation  in the euro area was at 2.4 percent
in June, the same as in May, the European Union’s  statistics
office  in Luxembourg said today. Earlier the euro traded below
$1.22 for a third day as German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said
she hasn’t softened her stance on measures to stem the sovereign
debt crisis.  The euro remained stronger versus the dollar and down
against the yen as Moody’s Investors Service lowered long-term
debt and deposit ratings on 10 Italian banks, citing its
downgrade July 13 of Italy’s government bond rating.  The shared currency was within two cents of its lifetime
average of $1.2087 from Jan. 1, 1999, when it began trading,
through July 13. It declined 3.9 percent over the past three
months, the worst performer among the 10 developed-nation
currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.
The yen advanced 6 percent, and the dollar gained 3.6 percent.  Even with the U.K. in its first double-dip recession since
1975, exports to Europe falling and the  Bank of England  adding
to the supply of sterling by injecting 375 billion pounds ($586
billion) of stimulus, the pound rose 3.1 percent over the past
six months. That’s the best performance of the basket of 10
developed-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  The pound gained 0.2 percent to 78.49 pence per euro today
and touched 78.32 pence, the strongest level since Oct. 31,
2008. Sterling rose 0.4 percent to $1.5637.  To contact the reporter on this story:
