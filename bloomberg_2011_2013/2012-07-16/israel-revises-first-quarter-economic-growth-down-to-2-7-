Israel ’s  economy  expanded an
annualized 2.7 percent in the three months through March, the
statistics office said, revising the figure down for a second
time as export markets stall.  Growth slowed from 3.1 percent in the previous three
months, the Jerusalem-based Central Bureau of Statistics said in
an e-mailed statement today. The bureau’s initial estimate for
growth in the first quarter was 3 percent, and that was revised
down to 2.9 percent last month.  “We believe that the global situation is taking its toll
on the domestic economy, and the pace of growth continued to
slow in the second quarter,” Bank Hapoalim Ltd. said in a
report before the release.  Economic growth is expected to decelerate to 3.1 percent
this year from 4.8 percent in 2011, according to central bank
estimates, as  Europe  struggles with a debt crisis and the global
expansion slows. More than 40 percent of Israel’s gross domestic
product is made up of exports, with Europe one of the largest
markets.  Israeli exports fell 11.9 percent in June, the biggest drop
this year. Inflation slowed to a five-year low of 1 percent, the
bottom of the government’s target range.  The  Bank of Israel  cut the benchmark  interest rate  by a
quarter percentage point to 2.25 percent on June 25, the first
reduction in five months, citing a “high” level of global
economic risk.  The bank may cut another quarter-point off the rate next
month and is likely to reduce its growth forecast, said  Jonathan
Katz , a Jerusalem-based economist for HSBC Holdings Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
