India ’s 10-year bonds gained,
pushing the yield to a one-month low, on speculation the central
bank will cut  interest rates  after inflation unexpectedly eased
in June.  The benchmark wholesale-price  index  rose 7.25 percent from
a year earlier, after climbing 7.55 percent in May, the commerce
ministry said in a statement in  New Delhi  today. The median of
36 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey was for a 7.61 percent
gain. The  Reserve Bank  of India, which lowered interest  rates  in
April for the first time since 2009, is scheduled to review
policy on July 31.  “The unexpected slowdown of inflation is fantastic news,”
Dariusz Kowalczyk, a strategist at Credit Agricole CIB in  Hong
Kong , wrote in an e-mailed statement. “We expect a 25 basis
point cut in rates at the RBI meeting.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 fell five
basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 8.05 percent in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system. The rate
is the lowest for a benchmark 10-year bond since June 15.  The RBI reduced its  repurchase rate  by 50 basis points to 8
percent in April, after raising it by a record 375 basis points
through 2010 and 2011. Governor Duvvuri Subbarao held the repo
 rate  at 8 percent at a meeting on June 18.  Inflation Risks  The  economy  expanded 5.3 percent in the three months
through March, the slowest pace in nine years.  Brent crude  has
fallen 11.8 percent in the past year to $102.64 a barrel,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Evidently inflation pressure has eased somewhat in recent
months with the slowing of growth and decline in global
commodity prices,” said Deutsche Bank economists Taimur Baig
and Kaushik Das in a research note.  The central bank may keep interest rates unchanged at this
month’s policy review, the Deutsche Bank economists said, citing
the rupee’s weakness and a “poor” monsoon.  The local currency has depreciated 4.1 percent this year,
the worst performing major currency in  Asia , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Monsoon, which accounts for more than 70 percent of India’s
annual rainfall, was 22 percent below a 50-year average since
June 1, the weather bureau said yesterday.  One-year  interest-rate swaps , or derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, was unchanged at
7.53 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
