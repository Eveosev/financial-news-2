The  European Central Bank  declined
to comment on a report that it had recommended that senior
bondholders should take losses in the event of a restructuring
of Spanish bank debt.  A report in the Wall Street Journal today said ECB
President  Mario Draghi  advocated imposing losses on senior
bondholders issued by “the most severely damaged” Spanish
savings banks at a meeting of European Union finance ministers
on July 9. A spokesman for the Frankfurt-based central bank
wouldn’t comment on that discussion.  The spokesman said in an e-mail that the ECB’s advice aims
to ensure that the treatment of senior bondholders is in line
with EU rules. He added that national authorities regulate bank
resolution processes. The ECB provides advice whenever
requested, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
