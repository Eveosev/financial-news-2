The Russian Football Union plans to
hire Fabio Capello to coach the national soccer team, Itar-Tass
reported, citing union acting chief Nikita Simonyan.  Either Capello or his lawyers will come to Moscow to sign a
contract in the next two days, Simonyan was cited as saying.
State television station Rossiya-24 said the contract will run
through the next World Cup tournament in 2014.  Capello quit as England coach in February. Dick Advocaat
left the Russia post after the Euro 2012 tournament, in which
his team failed to reach the quarterfinals.  Nobody in the unionâ€™s press service in Moscow answered the
phone when Bloomberg called seeking comment today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
