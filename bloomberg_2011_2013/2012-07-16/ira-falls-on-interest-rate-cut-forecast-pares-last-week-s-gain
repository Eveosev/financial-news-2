The lira weakened, paring last
week’s gain, and bond yields fell as JPMorgan Chase & Co. and
 Garanti Yatirim Ortakligi (GRNYO)  AS said the central bank may cut
 interest rates  at its policy meeting this week.  Turkey ’s currency depreciated as much as 0.3 percent and
traded down less than 0.1 percent at 1.8119 by 5:48 p.m. in
Istanbul, trimming its 0.4 percent gain last week. Yields on
benchmark  two-year bonds  declined 1 basis point to 7.94 percent,
which is within four basis points of a 10-month low.  “The Turkish central bank could deliver a 50 basis-point
cut in its overnight lending rate” and “is likely to reduce
its effective funding rate gradually towards 7.5 percent” from
about 8 percent now,  Yarkin Cebeci , an Istanbul-based economist
at JPMorgan, said in an e-mailed report today. “We assign a 60
percent probability that they keep all rates unchanged and a 40
percent probability that they cut the overnight lending rate.”  The average  weighted cost  of central bank funding has been
8.35 percent in July, compared with 9.18 percent in June,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Central bank Governor
Erdem Basci varies the rate at which he funds banks between the
benchmark one-week repurchase agreements rate of 5.75 percent
and the overnight repo rate of 11.5 percent. The monetary policy
committee is scheduled to meet on July 19.  “If there’s an interest-rate cut, we can expect a limited
sell-off in the lira and for rates to fall toward 7.7 percent,
Gizen Oztok Altinsac, an economist at Garanti Yatirim in
Istanbul, said by e-mail today. ‘‘A 50 basis-point cut, with the
intention of signaling, may be preferred.’’  The central bank will reduce its 6.5 percent inflation
forecast for 2012 toward the 5 percent goal when it releases its
quarterly inflation report on July 26 , Basci said in a speech
in the eastern city of Bursa on July 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
