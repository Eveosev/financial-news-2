Azerbaijan â€™s oil and natural gas
exports fell in the first half of 2012 from a year earlier, Meri
Amirova, a spokeswoman for the State Statistics Committee, said
by e-mail today.  Oil exports declined 8.2 percent to 12.69 million metric
tons while gas exports fell 17.3 percent to 2.5 billion cubic

last week.  Production of marketable gas rose 8.6 percent to 8.8
