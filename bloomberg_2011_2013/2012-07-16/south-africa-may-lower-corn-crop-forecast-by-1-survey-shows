South Africa , the continent’s
largest corn producer, will probably cut its forecast for this
season’s harvest of the grain by 1 percent, a survey showed.  The government may say farmers will reap 10.95 million
metric tons of corn in the season that started May 1, compared
with a June 26 forecast of 11.06 million tons, according to the
median estimate of seven traders surveyed by Bloomberg News.
Estimates ranged from 10.8 million tons to 11.06 million tons.
The nation produced 10.4 million tons of corn last year.  The government’s Crop Estimates Committee is scheduled to
announce its projection July 24 at 3:30 p.m. in  Pretoria .  White corn for December delivery, the most active contract,
surged 3.1 percent to a record 2,700 rand ($327) a ton by the
close in Johannesburg. The yellow variety, used mainly as  animal
feed , increased 3.1 percent to 2,641 rand a ton.  To contact the reporters on this story:
