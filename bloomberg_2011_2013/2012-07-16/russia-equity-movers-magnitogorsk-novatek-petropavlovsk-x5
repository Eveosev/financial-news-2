The 30-stock  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  gained 0.4
percent to 1,422.03 by the close in Moscow. The dollar-
denominated RTS Index added 0.4 percent to close at 1,374.02.  The following were among the most active equities in the
Russian market today. Stock symbols are in parenthesis.  OAO Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel (MAGN RX) rallied 1.9 percent
to 9.760 rubles, a second day of gains. The steelmaker advanced
as President  Vladimir Putin  was scheduled to visit the company’s
factory today.  OAO Novatek (NVTK RX) jumped 2.2 percent to 353.95 rubles,
the highest level since April 28. The share price increased on
speculation the Russian natural-gas producer may breach OAO
Gazprom’s monopoly on exports. Global depositary receipts
climbed 2.2 percent to $114.50.  Petropavlovsk Plc (POG)   dropped 4.3 percent to 441.70
pence in  London , heading for the biggest drop since June 18. The
London-listed producer of gold retreated after Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. almost halved its price estimate, citing rising costs
and high leverage.  X5 Retail Group NV (FIVE)   tumbled 2 percent to $20.75 in
London, set for the lowest since Jan. 30. Troika Dialog cut
Russia’s largest food retailer to hold from buy after Chief
Executive Officer Andrei Gusev quit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
