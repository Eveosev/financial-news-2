NeuroSearch A/S (NEUR)  jumped the most on
record in Copenhagen trading amid speculation U.S. authorities
will approve a second obesity medicine in less than three weeks,
reviving interest in the Danish drugmaker’s treatment.  NeuroSearch climbed as much as 160 percent, the most  since
1996 . Stock in Ballerup, Denmark-based company rose 2.60 kroner,
or 52 percent, to 7.60 kroner, the biggest advance since
February 2010, at 1:47 p.m. local time.  “It may have to do with the possible FDA approval of
Qnexa,” said Rene Schneider, the chief executive officer of
NeuroSearch. “I can only speculate.”  The U.S.  Food and Drug Administration  faces a July 17
deadline to rule on Vivus Inc’s Qnexa. The agency last month
approved Arena Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Eisai Co.’s Belviq. The
first obesity drug in 13 years to gain FDA backing, Belviq may
have sales of $2 billion by 2020, according to  Edward Tenthoff ,
an analyst with Piper Jaffray & Co. in  New York .  NeuroSearch has said it wants to out-license or sell its
experimental obesity treatment tesofensine to focus on a
medicine to treat  Huntington’s disease . The drugmaker hasn’t
actively developed tesofensine in the past two years, according
to its website.  Arena is projected by analysts to increase revenue 18-fold
in the next four years, the fastest growth in the world among
specialty pharmaceutical companies greater than $1 billion,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
