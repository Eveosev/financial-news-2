The following companies had unusual
price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of the close of trading.  The  IGBC Index (IGBC)  fell 0.6 percent to 13,576.91 while the
Colcap Index decreased 0.2 percent to 1,655.10.  Petrominerales Ltd. (PMGC)  , a Calgary-based  oil company 
that operates in the Andean region, fell 3.4 percent to 17,300
pesos. It dropped as much as 3.8 percent after saying protests
that began in April had forced the suspension of some
exploration and output. “There’s a lot of focus on
Petrominerales to get positive exploration results,” Juliana
Aguilar, an analyst Bolsa y Renta in Medellin, said in a phone
interview. “Having to suspend those operations obviously has a
negative effect.”  Canacol Energy Ltd. (CNEC)  , the Calgary-based oil
company that operates fields in  Colombia , rose 4.6 percent to
790 pesos. The stock may have gained on speculation the company
will be acquired, Justin Anderson, an analyst at Salman
Partners, said in a telephone interview. “Canacol has a very
solid set of assets and it’s got some funding issues,” he said.
“That typically will make it more interesting for other
companies to acquire.” Chief Executive Officer Charle Gamba,
speaking in a telephone interview, declined to comment on
takeover possibilities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
