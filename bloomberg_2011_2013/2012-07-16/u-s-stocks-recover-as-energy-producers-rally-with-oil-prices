U.S. stocks erased losses as a rally
in  oil prices  lifted energy producers, helping the market
recover from earlier declines triggered by concern the economic
recovery was weakening.  The Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index was little changed at
1,356.12 at 2:23 p.m. in New York after slumping as much as 0.6
percent. Crude oil climbed 1.4 percent to $88.32 a barrel,
helping send energy shares to the biggest gain among 10 groups
in the  S&P 500 .  Earlier losses in stocks came after the International
Monetary Fund cut its global economic forecast and retail sales
unexpectedly dropped.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
