Egypt ’s ousted President  Hosni Mubarak  was sent back to prison from the military hospital where
he was being held, the state-run Middle East News Agency
reported, citing a security source it didn’t identify.  The decision to move Mubarak, which reflects an improvement
in his health, was announced by Adel el-Saeed, the deputy
prosecutor general. An ambulance was seen leaving the hospital
in the direction of the prison today.  Mubarak was sentenced to life in prison in June for failing
to stop the killing of protesters who participated in the
uprising against him. He was transferred to a military hospital
after his health deteriorated. He had been held in the prison’s
intensive care unit since his sentencing before being
transferred to the hospital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
