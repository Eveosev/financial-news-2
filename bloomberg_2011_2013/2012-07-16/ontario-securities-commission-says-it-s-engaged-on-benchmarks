The Ontario Securities Commission,
the regulator in  Canada ’s most populous province, said it’s
“engaged” on issues relating to the setting of benchmark
reference rates by banks such as the Canadian Dealer Offered
Rate.  “We’re engaged in this issue and are coordinating our
efforts with our regulatory partners, both internationally and
domestically, as appropriate,” Tom Atkinson, director of
enforcement, said today in an e-mailed statement.  Regulators worldwide have been investigating rate-rigging
of the London interbank offered rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
