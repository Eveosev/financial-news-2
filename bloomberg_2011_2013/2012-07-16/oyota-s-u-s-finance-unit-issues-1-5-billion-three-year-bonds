Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the maker of the
world’s best-selling gasoline-electric vehicle, sold $1.5
billion of three-year dollar-denominated bonds.  Toyota Motor Credit Corp issued the 0.875 percent notes to
yield 58 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with a 1
percent coupon, or a spread of 67 basis points more than
benchmarks, on $1.25 billion of three-year debentures the
company sold in February.  The new debt may be rated Aa3, the fourth-highest
investment-grade level, by Moody’s Investors Service, according
to a person familiar with the transaction who asked not to be
identified because the terms are private.  The maker of the Prius last sold dollar-denominated, fixed-
rate debt in May, issuing $1 billion of 1.75 percent, five-year
securities at a relative yield of 110 basis points, Bloomberg
data show.  Citigroup Inc., BNP Paribas SA, Deutsche Bank AG and
JPMorgan Chase & Co. managed today’s sale, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
