Israel  and the European Commission
agreed to a five-year plan to expand collaborative efforts to
develop sustainable water supplies such as desalination and
boost energy-efficiency efforts.  The agreement is an “important milestone in the
progression of development between Israel and the EU,” Prime
Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  said. “The more we cooperate, the
more it will benefit our respective societies.”  Renewable energy, smart grids, energy-saving measures and
oil fuel alternatives are among the areas to be focused on in
the accord, the EU said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
