France’s  Finance Ministry  said it
will start consultations on a planned overhaul of the finance
industry that would separate some risky banking activities.  Finance Minister  Pierre Moscovici  met with a committee on
financial regulation and systemic risk today, and asked the
panel to start industry consultations in coming months, the
ministry said in an e-mailed statement today.  The goal of the reform is to focus banks on financing
companies and growth rather than “purely speculative, sterile
and risky operations,” the ministry wrote.  “The decisive gage is that of service to clients,” the
ministry said. “As for operations unrelated to it, Pierre
Moscovici recalled that he wouldn’t hesitate to assume a strict
limitation or even their prohibition.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
