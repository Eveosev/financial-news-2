Aberdeen Asset Management Ltd. will
stay underweight on the Russian market because corporate
governance improvements are slow and the country is too reliant
on oil and gas.  “Most other  emerging markets  have made significant
progress in corporate governance for the past 10 years, it’s
probably fair to say that Russia has made less progress,” Peter
Taylor, who oversees $1.5 billion in Russian equities as senior
investment manager at Aberdeen, said in a phone interview on
July 13. “We still have a long way to go.”  Russian equities  trade  at the cheapest valuations among 21
emerging markets tracked by Bloomberg, reflecting concern that
the country, which relies on energy sales for about half of
government revenue, is too reliant on commodity prices. Moscow’s
 Micex Index (INDEXCF)  trades at 5.2 times estimated earnings,  about half
 the valuation of shares in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Aberdeen is investing in Russian consumer stocks, like
 Russia ’s largest food retailer OAO Magnit, supermarket chain
O’Key Group SA and OAO Synergy, the Russian vodka maker, Taylor
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
