The French government may review its
position on shale gas as part of the planned mining code
revision,  Les Echos  reported, citing unidentified industry
ministry officials.  Energy Minister Delphine Batho will hold talks with non-
governmental organizations and there could be some progress on
the issue by the end of the month, the daily business newspaper
said.  The previous French government passed a law last year
banning hydraulic fracturing of shale though “experiments aimed
solely at scientific research” are still allowed, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
