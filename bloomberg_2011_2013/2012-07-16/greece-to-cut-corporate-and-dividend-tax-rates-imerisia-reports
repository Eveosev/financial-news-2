Greece â€™s  Finance Ministry  plans to
introduce a single tax rate of 20 percent on company earnings,
replacing rates that range as high as 45 percent today,  Imerisia 
reported, without citing anyone.  When economic conditions allow, the tax will be further
reduced to 15 percent, while the tax rate companies pay on
dividends they distribute will be cut to 20 percent, or even 15
percent, from the current 25 percent, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
