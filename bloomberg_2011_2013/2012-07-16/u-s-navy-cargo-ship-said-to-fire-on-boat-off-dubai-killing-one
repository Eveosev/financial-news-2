A U.S. Navy cargo ship operated by
the Navy’s Sealift Command fired on a pleasure boat off the
coast of Dubai, killing one person and injuring three others, a
U.S. official said.  The U.S. ship shot at the boat after issuing a series of
warnings by voice, radio, and lights not to get too close, the
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss an
issue that is still being investigated. Such ships are operated
primarily by a civilian crew, the official said.  The ship was operating in the U.S. Central Command’s area
of responsibility and it wasn’t clear when the incident took
place, the official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
