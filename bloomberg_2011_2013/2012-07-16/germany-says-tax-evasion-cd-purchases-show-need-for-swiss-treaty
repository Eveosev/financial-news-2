Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
government said the reported purchase by a German state of a
compact disc with data on tax evaders underlines the need for a
stalled German-Swiss  tax treaty  to be approved.  The accord, signed by the German and Swiss governments
though yet to be ratified in  Germany ’s opposition-controlled
upper house of parliament, presents “a correct, substantial and
helpful” way to resolve the matter of untaxed assets in
 Switzerland , Finance Ministry spokesman Martin Kotthaus told
reporters today in Berlin.  Ratification, which is being blocked by the  Social
Democrats  and Greens in the upper house, where Germany’s 16
state governments are represented, would remove an incentive for
regional authorities to buy tax-data CDs, Kotthaus said.
Kotthaus said he couldn’t confirm whether the purchase of the CD
has been completed.  The state of North Rhine-Westphalia, governed by an SPD-led
coalition, bought a CD from an undisclosed source in Switzerland
with data on about 1,000 German clients of RBS Coutts, the
private banking unit of  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc , the
Financial Times Deutschland reported July 14. The CD was
purchased for 3.5 million euros ($4.3 million), the FTD said,
without saying where it got the information.  RBS Coutts said yesterday that there’s no evidence its
client data has been infringed.  The Social Democrats are leading opposition to a treaty
that would levy a tax on German assets held in Swiss banks while
keeping client identities secret, saying that it doesn’t go far
enough in penalizing tax cheats. Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said the purchase of CDs can only be a “temporary
crutch,” according to an interview in today’s Bild newspaper.  To contact the reporters on this story:
