South Africa â€™s rand-denominated bond
yields fell to record lows and the rand gained after retail
sales in the U.S. unexpectedly declined for a third straight
month in June.  Yields on 6.75 percent notes due 2021 dropped six basis
points to 6.91 percent as of 2:40 p.m. in Johannesburg. The rand
climbed 0.2 percent to 8.2466 per dollar, reversing a decline of
as much as 0.3 percent in earlier trading.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
