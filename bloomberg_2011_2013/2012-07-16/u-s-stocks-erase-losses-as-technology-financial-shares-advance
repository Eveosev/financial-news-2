U.S. stocks erased losses as
technology and financial shares led the market higher following
a morning slump triggered by an unexpected drop in retail sales.  The Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index was down less than 0.1
percent at 1,356.36 at 11:18 a.m. in  New York  after slipping as
much as 0.6 percent earlier.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
