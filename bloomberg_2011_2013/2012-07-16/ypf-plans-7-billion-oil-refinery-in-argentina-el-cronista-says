YPF SA (YPFD) , Argentina’s state-run oil
company, plans to build a $7 billion refinery with capacity to
process 300,000 barrels of crude per day, EL Cronista reported,
without saying where it got the information.  The plant will be built in five years in Bahia Blanca, a
petrochemical hub in Argentina’s southern coast, the Buenos
Aires-based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
