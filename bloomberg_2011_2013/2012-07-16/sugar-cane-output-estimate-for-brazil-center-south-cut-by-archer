Sugar-cane output in the main
growing region in  Brazil , the world’s largest producer of the
sweetener, will be lower than previously forecast for the
current season, according to Archer Consulting.  Cane production in the center south of Brazil will total
502 million metric tons in 2012-13, below the prior 508 million-
ton estimate, Arnaldo Luiz Correa, a director at the Sao Paulo-
based company, said in a report e-mailed July 14. The estimate
was Archer’s fifth for the crop. Output in the 2011-12 season
fell for the first time in a decade to 493.3 million tons,
according to data from industry group Unica.  Millers in the region will produce 32.13 million tons of
sugar, below a previous forecast of 32.51 million tons,
according to Archer. The area’s sugar output was 31.3 million
tons in 2011-12, Unica data show.  Ethanol production may be 20.6 billion liters (78 billion
gallons), down from a previous forecast of 21.2 billion liters,
Archer said. Millers in center south produced 20.5 billion
liters of the biofuel last season, according to Unica.  To contact the reporter on this story:
