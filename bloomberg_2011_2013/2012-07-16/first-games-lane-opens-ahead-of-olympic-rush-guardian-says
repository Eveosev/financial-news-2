The first Olympic vehicle lane came
into operation today as athletes started  arriving in London
ahead of the games, the  Guardian newspaper  reported.  The lane is located on the M4 motorway connecting  Heathrow
airport  and central London and will operate between 5 a.m. and
10 p.m., according to the newspaper. The M4 lane is part of the
Olympic Route Network (ORN) in London designed to make it easier
for athletes and officials to get to and from to the Olympic
village in Stratford, East London and other venues.  The ORN will be fully operational on July 25, two days
before the Olympics opening ceremony, and covers 30 miles. Those
who stray into designated lanes face a penalty of 130 pounds
($202) and illegally parked vehicles may incur a release fee of
200 pounds, the Guardian said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
