What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets, which resume trading at 5 p.m.
on the  Chicago  Board of Trade.  -- Corn futures are called to open 20 cents to 25 cents a bushel
higher after a U.S. government report said today that crop
conditions deteriorated, reducing yield prospects of the biggest
U.S. crop, Doug Bergman, a vice president of agricultural
derivatives at RCM Asset Management in Chicago, said in a
telephone interview.  -- Soybean futures may open 15 cents to 20 cents a bushel higher
as unusually dry, warm weather forecast for the next two weeks
will increase crop stress and erode yield potential, Bergman
said.  -- Wheat futures may open 15 cents to 20 cents a bushel higher
on the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  after a Canadian agency reduced its production
forecast because of dry, warm weather, Bergman said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
