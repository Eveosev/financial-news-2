The U.S. Defense Department is
speeding deployment of the Navy’s John C. Stennis aircraft
carrier group to the  Middle East , four months ahead of its
scheduled deployment, Pentagon spokesman  George Little  said.  Marine Corps General James Mattis, commander of the U.S.
Central Command, who has responsibility for the region, sought
the earlier presence of the Stennis strike group and Defense
Secretary  Leon Panetta  approved the request, Little told
reporters today.  The deployment of the Stennis “is about a wide range of
U.S. security interests” and not specifically tied to threats
from  Iran  or the turmoil in Syria, Little said.  Sending the Stennis group ahead of schedule was intended to
avoid having just one aircraft carrier group in the Middle East
when the USS Enterprise carrier group leaves the region later
this year, Little said. He declined to say when the Enterprise
is scheduled to depart. In June, the Pentagon announced a nine-
month deployment of the carrier Dwight D. Eisenhower to the
area.  The Stennis strike group will include the Navy’s Aegis
destroyer USS Mobile Bay and a contingent of 5,500 sailors,
Little said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
