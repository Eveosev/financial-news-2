The Australian government awarded
researchers specializing in solar power almost A$1.3 million
($1.3 million) to develop technologies to make the energy source
more efficient and cost effective.  The grants are part of the government’s Skills Development
Program, resources minister  Martin Ferguson  said in an e-mailed
release today.  “From techniques to improve the efficiency of solar cells
made from low-cost and readily available organic materials, to
investigating ways to optimize hybrid solar-diesel systems in
remote areas using smart grids, the Skills Development Program
is helping to drive Australian solar innovation,” Ferguson said
in the statement.  Renewable energy sources generated enough electricity to
power the equivalent of more than 4 million average Australian
households in the 12 months ended in September,  according  to a
report by the Clean Energy Council, an industry association.  Hydro electricity accounts for about two-thirds of
 Australia ’s energy from renewables, followed by wind, bioenergy
and solar power from photovoltaic sources, the council says.  Australia is in the midst of efforts to cut  carbon
emissions  that the government says are the highest per capita in
the developed world.  Coal generated 77 percent of the nation’s electricity in
2009 and 2010, while natural gas accounted for about 14 percent,
according to data from the Energy Supply Association of
Australia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
