The  New York Knicks  re-acquired
point guard  Raymond Felton  in a six-player trade with the
 Portland Trail Blazers , making it less probable they’ll match
Houston’s contract offer to Jeremy Lin.  The Knicks picked up Felton, who ran their offense for most
of the 2010-11 National Basketball Association season, along
with forward Kurt Thomas for four players and a draft pick.
Thomas is also returning to  New York , having played for the
Knicks from 1998 through 2005.  The Knicks’ acquisition of Felton, 28, comes after they
signed 39-year-old point guard  Jason Kidd  earlier this month.
The additions indicate the Knicks might not match the Rockets’
three-year, $25 million offer sheet to Lin, who started 25 games
for New York last season.  The Knicks sent forward Jared Jeffries, center Dan Gadzuric
and the draft rights to Greek players Kostas Papanikolaou and
Giorgos Printezis, to Portland along with a protected future
second-round draft pick.  Felton, the fifth overall pick in the 2005 NBA draft, had
his best professional season while with the Knicks in 2010-11,
when he averaged 17.1 points and 9.0 assists in 54 games.  Felton was then sent to the  Denver Nuggets  as part of the
nine-player trade that brought  Carmelo Anthony  to New York. In
60 games for the Trail Blazers last season, Felton averaged 11.4
points and 6.5 assists.  Felton’s statistics in his lone season running the Knicks’
offense were better than Lin’s averages of 14.6 points and 6.2
assists for New York last season. Felton has averaged 13.4
points and 6.7 assists over 534 career games, while Lin, a 23-
year-old Harvard University graduate who is the first Taiwanese-
or Chinese-American to play in the NBA, has appeared in a total
of 64 NBA games.  Blocked Shots  The 6-foot-9 Thomas averaged 3.0 points and 3.5 rebounds
off the bench in  Portland  during the 2011-12 season. He’s
averaged 8.3 points and 6.8 rebounds over 17 NBA seasons and
still ranks fourth in Knicks history in blocked shots.  The Blazers add a pair of 10-year veterans in Jeffries and
Gadzuric, both of whom are 6-foot-11 and 240 pounds. Jeffries
has career averages of 5.0 points and 4.2 rebounds, while
Gadzuric has averaged 4.7 points and 4.4 rebounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
