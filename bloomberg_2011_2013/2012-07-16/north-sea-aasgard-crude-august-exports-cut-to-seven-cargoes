Exports of North Sea Aasgard crude
for August were reduced to seven cargoes of 855,000 barrels,
after the last lot for the month was postponed to September, a
loading program obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  Shipments of Aasgard for July were also revised lower to
seven from eight as one consignment was deferred to early
August, the plan showed.  Loadings of Statfjord for July will be two cargoes of
855,000 barrels each, after one shipment was dropped, another
schedule showed.  Statoil ASA (STL) ,  Norway â€™s largest oil and gas producer,
operates the two fields. Loading programs are monthly schedules
of crude shipments compiled by field operators to allow buyers
and sellers to plan their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
