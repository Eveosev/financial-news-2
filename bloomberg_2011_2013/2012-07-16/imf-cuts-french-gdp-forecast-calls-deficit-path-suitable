The  International Monetary Fund  cut
its predictions for French gross domestic product growth this
year and next and said President  Francois Hollande ’s plans to
cut the  budget deficit  are appropriate.  France’s economy  will probably expand 0.3 percent in 2012
and 0.8 percent in 2013, the IMF said today in its latest World
Economic Outlook. That’s down from growth forecasts of 0.5
percent and 1 percent made by the lender in April.  The forecast matches the 0.3 percent growth Hollande’s
 government is predicting  for this year and is less than 1.2
percent growth it expects next year. Still, the deficit-cutting
plan set out by Hollande, who won office in May, sets the right
pace for now, the IMF said.  “The new administration has committed to reducing its
headline deficit by about 1 percent of GDP this year and 1.5
percent of GDP next year,” the Washington-based IMF said. “The
underlying adjustment implicit in these targets is appropriate
under the baseline scenario. However, in the event that growth
disappoints, these targets could entail an excessive structural
adjustment.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
