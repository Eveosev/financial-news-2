Crude-oil options volatility slipped
after underlying futures capped the longest advance since April.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
September, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 31.37 percent at 3:55 p.m. on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange , down from 31.97 July 13. September
options are more active than August, which will expire tomorrow.  Crude oil for September delivery rose $1.31, or 1.5
percent, to settle at $88.81 a barrel on the Nymex. Prices have
risen four straight days.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
August $90 calls, which fell 4 cents to 14 cents a barrel at
4:02 p.m. with 4,506 lots trading. August $87 puts were the
second-most active options, with 2,891 lots changing hands as
they dropped 72 cents to 17 cents a barrel.  Calls accounted for 59 percent of total electronic trading
volume. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
trading, where the bulk of options trading occurs.  Bullish bets accounted for 56 percent of the 117,751
contracts traded in the previous session.  August $85 puts were the most actively traded, with 6,554
lots changing hands. They lost 45 cents to 26 cents a barrel.

cents to 99 cents on volume of 5,105.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with 43,765
contracts. Next were December $120 calls with 40,606 lots and
