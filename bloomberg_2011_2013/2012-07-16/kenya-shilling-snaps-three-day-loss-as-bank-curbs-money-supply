Kenya ’s shilling snapped a three-day
losing streak as the  central bank  stepped up restrictions on
 money supply .  The currency of  East Africa ’s largest economy gained less
than 0.1 percent to close at 84.13 per dollar, after appreciated
as much as 0.3 percent to 83.90 earlier, in the capital Nairobi.  The Central Bank of Kenya today sold a total of 7 billion
shillings ($83 million) of seven-day  repurchase agreements  and
term-auction deposits, said an official, who asked not to be
identified in line with policy. That compared with 2 billion
shillings on July 13. The repos and longer-tenure term auction
deposits are sold by the regulator in a bid to withdraw money
supply from the banking system.  “The shilling is getting support from the central bank as
it increases the amount of money its curbing in the market, a
situation that is likely to persist as it seek to maintain
liquidity levels in the market,” Jeremiah Kendagor, head of
trading at Nairobi-based  Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd. (KNCB) , said in a
phone interview today.  The bank accepted 3.5 billion shillings of seven-day repos
at a weighted average rate of 14.669 percent, the official said
by phone from Nairobi. The bank also accepted 920 million
shillings of 14-day term-auction deposits at 14.75 percent, 1.5
billion shillings of 21-day deposits at 14.733 percent, and 1.08
billion shillings of 28-day deposits at 14.617 percent.  The bank cut its  benchmark lending rate  for the first time
in 18 months on July 5, reducing the key rate by 1.5 percentage
points to 16.5 percent. The bank raised borrowing costs by a
record 12.25 percentage points in 2011 to help bolster the
shilling and curb price pressures following drought.  Inflation declined for the seventh straight month to 10.1
percent from 12.2 percent in May, the Kenya National Bureau of
Statistics said June 29.  The Tanzanian shilling gained for a second day, rising by
0.1 percent to close at 1,583 per dollar, while  Uganda ’s
shilling weakened 0.1 percent to 2,467.50 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
