Washington  has finalized $82 million
in awards for low-interest loans and grants earmarked for 57
clean water projects across the state ranging from upgrading
sewer plants to water re-use facilities.  The water quality awards from funds approved in the 2012
state budget will help provide about 900 jobs for projects
including expanding sewer facilities and collection systems,
stream protection and sewage disposal improvements, the
Washington Department of Ecology said in a statement.  The funding sources include $13.5 million from the
Centennial Clean Water Program, which is funded through state
bonds, the department said from Olympia. Granger, Mabton and
Snohomish were among the cities chosen for loans and grants for
wastewater treatment plant projects, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
