The Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of
24  raw materials  rose 1.5 percent to settle at 630.63 at 3:57
p.m. in  New York , led by grains.  The UBS Bloomberg CMCI index of 26  prices  climbed 1 percent
to 1,548.16.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS  Corn futures rose to a 10-month high and soybeans extended
a rally to the costliest since 2008 on speculation that an
expanding drought will cut supplies from the U.S., the world’s
biggest producer of the crops.  Most of the Midwest will be unusually dry and hot in the
next 10 days as occasional showers will be too light to induce
more than brief crop improvement, T-Storm Weather LLC in Chicago
said in a report. July is on pace to rank as the third driest
and warmest in 118 years of data, the private forecaster said.
Soybean-meal futures climbed to a record.  Corn futures for December delivery jumped 4.4 percent to
$7.725 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Earlier, the
price reached $7.78, the highest for a most-active contract
since Aug. 29.  Soybean futures for November delivery rose 2.4 percent to
$15.905 a bushel. Earlier, the price reached $15.985, the
highest since July 2008.  Wheat futures for September delivery surged 4.3 percent to
$8.845 a bushel. Earlier, the grain reached $8.89, the highest
since Feb. 15, 2011.  CRUDE OIL  Crude oil rose, capping the longest rally since late April,
as manufacturing in the New York region expanded in July at a
faster pace than anticipated.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , oil futures for August
delivery rose 1.5 percent to $88.43 a barrel. The price climbed
for the fourth straight session.  Brent crude  for August settlement increased 1.1 percent to
$103.55 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures  Europe 
exchange.  Statoil ASA failed to sell North Sea Forties at a higher
price. No bids or offers were made for Russian Urals in Europe.
Vitol Group offered Nigerian  Bonny Light  for delivery in
northwest Europe.  Iraq  will reduce its daily exports of Basrah Light grade
from the  Persian Gulf  by 3.8 percent in the second half of July,
compared with the previous two weeks, a loading program obtained
by Bloomberg News showed.  OIL PRODUCTS  Gasoline rose on speculation that weakening U.S. retail
sales will prompt the  Federal Reserve  to act to boost the
economy, bolstering prospects for fuel demand.  On the Nymex, gasoline futures for August delivery climbed
1.4 percent to $2.8547 a gallon.  Heating-oil futures for August delivery gained 1.4 percent
to $2.8277 a gallon.  SOFT COMMODITIES  Cotton futures rose to a three-week high as below-average
rain spurred supply concerns in  India , the world’s second-
biggest producer.  On ICE Futures U.S. in New York, cotton for December
delivery gained 0.9 percent to 73.3 cents a pound. Earlier, the
price touched 73.4 cents, the highest since June 20.  Raw-sugar futures for October delivery rose 0.2 percent to
22.77 cents a pound.  Arabica-coffee futures for September delivery dropped 1.2
percent to $1.8395 a pound.  Cocoa futures for September delivery fell 0.9 percent to
$2,197 a metric ton.  Orange-juice futures for September delivery slipped 3.8
percent to $1.1795 a pound. Earlier, the price touched $1.1665,
the lowest since July 2.  BASE METALS  Copper fell for the second time in three sessions as slower
growth forecast by the  International Monetary Fund  and Europe’s
deepening debt crisis added to speculation that demand for raw
materials will slow.  Copper futures for September delivery slid 0.5 percent to
$3.485 a pound on the Comex in New York. The metal has fallen
8.9 percent since the end of the first quarter.  Aluminum, zinc, nickel and lead rose on London Metal
Exchange, while tin declined.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas dropped for the first time in four sessions on
speculation that hot weather won’t erase an inventory surplus of
the power-plant fuel.  On the Nymex, gas futures for August delivery fell 2.5
percent to $2.801 per million British thermal units.  U.K. gas declined for a second day as imports from  Norway 
rose to a two-month high.  Day-ahead gas fell 0.85 pence, or 1.5 percent, to 55 pence
a therm at 4:13 p.m. London time, after reaching 54.25 pence,
the lowest since June 25. A therm is 100,000 Btu.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold futures fell for the fourth time in five sessions as
the Fed refrained from announcing more stimulus measures amid
mounting signs of slowing global growth.  On the Comex, gold futures for August delivery fell 40
cents to $1,591.60 an ounce.  Silver futures for September delivery slipped 0.2 percent

2011, on speculation that U.S. beef supplies will increase as
ranchers move animals from pastures scorched by drought.  On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, cattle futures for
October delivery fell 0.7 percent to $1.2055 a pound. The
contract dropped for the sixth straight session, the longest
slump in 14 months.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement fell by the CME
limit of 3 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $1.36 a pound, the lowest
for a most-active since Sept. 23. The drop was the biggest since
May 23, 2011.  Hog futures for October settlement dropped 0.3 percent to
79.2 cents a pound. Earlier, the price touched 78.7 cents, the
lowest for a most-active contract since Jan. 7, 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
