Solarworld AG (SWV) , Germany’s biggest
solar-panel maker, dropped to an eight-year low in Frankfurt
trading after Commerzbank AG cut its rating on the stock.  Solarworld fell as much as 9.2 percent to 1.112 euros, the
lowest price since April 2004, and was at 1.133 euros at 12:40
p.m. local time. The shares have slumped 65 percent this year,
valuing the company at 127.4 million euros ($155.3 million).  Commerzbank lowered its  recommendation  on the stock to sell
from hold today and reduced its price estimate to 80 euro cents
from 2.50 euros, saying earnings before interest and tax will
remain in “negative territory” amid “severe” competition and
tighter project financing.  Solarworld, along with peers  Conergy AG (CGYK)  and  Q-Cells SE (QCE) , has
struggled to cope with waning demand in Europe, where Germany,
Italy and France have cut premiums paid for power from solar
panels. Germany’s Centrotherm Photovoltaic AG filed for
 bankruptcy protection  on July 10, which helped push domestic
competitor SMA Solar Technology to a record low last week.  Solarworld, based in Bonn, may have difficulty paying the
interest on its “huge debt pile,” Lauren Licuanan, an analyst
at Commerzbank, said in a note to investors. Net debt is likely
to be more than 10 times earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization in 2012, her estimates show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
