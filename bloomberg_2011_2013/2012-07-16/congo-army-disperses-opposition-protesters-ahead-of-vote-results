Congo Republic’s army dispersed
supporters of the opposition Alliance for the Republic and
Democracy who staged a demonstration in the central town of
Gamboma after parliamentary elections yesterday.  Soldiers fired shots into the air after a crowd of
protesters threw stones at them and besieged an office of the
National Commission for the Organization of Elections in
Gamboma, 275 kilometers (171 miles) north of the capital,
Brazzaville, electoral official Lucien Okana said. The
opposition supporters were claiming victory for their candidate,
he said.  “The shooting lasted more than two hours,” Okana said. At
least three people were injured, including a 4-year-old child
who was hit by a stray bullet, he said.  Residents of the Central African nation voted yesterday in
elections in which President Denis Sassou Nguesso’s ruling
Congolese Labor Party will probably retain its majority in
parliament. Sassou Nguesso’s party and its allies won 125 of the
137 seats in a 2007 vote, which was marred by fraud and
irregularities, according to African Union election observers.  The results of yesterday’s vote are scheduled to be
announced later this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
