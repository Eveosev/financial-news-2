Orion Capital Managers LLP  bought a
former headquarters of the Daily Mail newspaper on the bank of
the River Thames near the  City of London  financial district for
an undisclosed price.  Orion and development partner Quadrant Estates will
refurbish the 120,000 square-foot (11,150 square-meter) office
block at 50 Victoria Embankment, the company said in a statement
today. The property, bought from clients of  Aberdeen Asset
Management Plc (ADN) , will be worth 120 million pounds ($186 million)
when the work is done, Orion estimated.  The amount of new and refurbished office space leased in
London last year was the lowest in a decade, hurt by a shrinking
financial-services industry, real estate broker Drivers Jonas
Deloitte said in  May . Developers including London-based Orion
are betting that businesses will choose less expensive
refurbished space over new buildings when their existing leases
expire. Work on the Victoria Embankment building should be
finished in 2014, according to the e-mailed statement.  London  has a limited supply of prime office space “and
this location is increasingly seen by many occupiers as a viable
alternative to the West End,” Tristram Gethin, managing
director of London-based  Quadrant Estates , said in the
statement. “We are expecting demand from occupiers looking for
first class offices in a prime riverside location.”  Rents for the best space in the City of London are about 55
pounds a square foot compared with approximately 95 pounds a
square foot in the West End, broker  Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. (JLL)  said
in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
