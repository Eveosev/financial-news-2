Aberdeen Asset Management Ltd. is
investing in OAO Magnit,  Russia ’s largest retailer, as the
economy’s expansion boosts  consumer spending  and spurs the best
performance on the benchmark Micex Index.  “What we’re trying to build is an exposure to Russian
growth, in particular, the growth of consumption, growth in the
domestic economy,” Peter Taylor, senior investment manager at
Aberdeen Asset Managers Ltd., said by phone July 13. “Our
conviction has always been quite high” on Magnit, Taylor said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
