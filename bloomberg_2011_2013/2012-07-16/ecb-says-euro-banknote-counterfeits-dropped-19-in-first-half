The  European Central Bank  said it
removed 19 percent fewer counterfeited euro banknotes from
circulation in the first half of the year compared with the
previous six months.  The Frankfurt-based central bank withdrew about 251,000
forged notes in the six months through June, compared with about
310,000 between July and December 2011, it said in an e-mailed
statement today. From a year earlier, the number was down 15.2
percent.  The ECB said the most counterfeited denominations remain
the 20-euro and 50-euro notes, which together accounted for 77
percent of discovered forgeries. The proportion of counterfeit
notes compared with the total in circulation remains “very
low,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
