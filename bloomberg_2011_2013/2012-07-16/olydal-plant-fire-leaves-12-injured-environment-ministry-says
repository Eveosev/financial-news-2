An explosion and fire in a factory
of French lubricant maker Molydal SA left 12 people “slightly”
injured this morning, the  Environment Ministry  said.  The fire at the factory in Saint-Maximin, about 40
kilometers (29 miles) north of Paris, was brought under control
by 120 firefighters, the ministry wrote in an e-mailed statement
today. Sixty companies with 1,000 employees in a radius of 300
meters (328 yards) around the site were temporarily evacuated
and a barrier was placed in the Oise River to retain pollution.  The ministry said it will investigate whether measures
demanded after a fire in 2007 had been put in place.  Molydal was founded in 1958 and makes greases for
lubricating equipment that operates in very high or low
temperatures or is exposed to saltwater, steam, solvents or very
high loads, according to the company’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
