Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-
bank lending  rate , opened at 0.18 percent, within the Federal
Reserve’s target of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.15 percent on July 13 after trading
from 0.15 percent to 0.5 percent and averaging 0.17 percent,
ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker, said in an e-
mailed statement.  The central bank will acquire $1.5 billion to $2 billion of
Treasuries maturing from August 2022 to February 2031. The
purchases are the part of the Fed’s program, which lasts through
the end of the year, to replace $267 billion of short-term debt
in its portfolio with longer-term Treasuries in an effort to
reduce borrowing costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
