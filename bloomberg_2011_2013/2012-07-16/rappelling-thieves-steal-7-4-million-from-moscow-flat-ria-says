Thieves stole about 240 million
rubles ($7.4 million) of cash and valuables from the home of a
Moscow lawyer after rappelling from the roof of his building,
RIA Novosti reported, citing an interview with the victim,
Leonid Rozenblyum.  Rozenblyum said heâ€™s certain who tipped off the robbers
because they also stole documents that are of interest to a
specific person, the state-run Russian news service said.  A neighbor who saw the burglars descending down the side of
the building called the police at 3 a.m. yesterday, though
nobody arrived until 11 a.m., RIA cited the lawyer as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
