Symrise AG (SY1) , the world´s fourth-
largest maker of flavors and fragrances, fell the most in two
months after Kepler Capital Markets SA reduced its stock
recommendation, citing limits to additional earnings growth.  Symrise dropped as much as 4 percent to 24.35 euros, the
steepest intraday slide since May 16, and was trading down 3.6
percent at 2:53 p.m. in Frankfurt. The Holzminden, Germany-based
company, which on July 13 reached the highest since the
company’s initial public offering in December 2006, is the worst
performer on the  STOXX 600 Chemicals Index (SX4P)  today.  Although still a “quality stock,” Symrise has reached
Kepler’s price estimate of 24 euros a share, and “we see no
trigger which could drive our earnings forecasts,” Markus Mayer, an analyst in Munich, said in a note to investors today.
Kepler lowered its  recommendation  on the stock to hold from buy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
