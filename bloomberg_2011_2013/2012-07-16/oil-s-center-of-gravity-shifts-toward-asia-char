Emerging economies will use more of
the world’s oil than advanced nations next year for the first
time, underscoring the growing industrial dominance of Asian
consumers such as  China .  The CHART OF THE DAY shows demand outside of the 34 members
of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
overtaking the OECD in the second quarter of 2013. Emerging
nations such as China, India and Indonesia will provide all of
next year’s oil-demand growth, with China alone accounting for
more than 30 percent of the global expansion, according to
 International Energy Agency  estimates released July 12.  “What we are seeing in terms of oil demand growth is a
reflection of the shift in the center of gravity of economic
growth,” said  Harry Tchilinguirian , head of commodity-markets
strategy at BNP Paribas SA in London. “So it’s no longer a
question of whether emerging market oil demand will overtake
that of advanced economies, but when.”  Crude consumption in the developing world will rise to an
average 45.72 million barrels a day in 2013, exceeding the 45.15
million barrels a day used in OECD nations, “a trend that is
unlikely to be reversed,” the Paris-based IEA said.  The geographic shift in demand reflects the closing of
refineries in Europe and the U.S. as new plants are being
constructed in Asia and the  Middle East , according to Sanford C.
