an inspection of  Barclays Plc (BARC) ’s investment banking unit,
Expansion reported.  The review is examining the practice of temporarily
switching ownership of securities to avoid the tax deduction of
dividend income at the source, the newspaper said today.  The firm is undergoing a routine inspection by Spanish
authorities and isn’t aware of an investigation, an official at
the bank’s Spanish unit in  Madrid  said in a phone interview.
Nobody at the budget ministry was immediately available to
