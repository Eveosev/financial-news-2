Daffy’s Inc., a 19-store chain that
sells discount designer brands in the U.S. Northeast, said it
will shutter its business in the next few months, citing an
uncertain economy and weak  consumer spending .  “The process will entail the gradual closing of Daffy’s
stores and the liquidation of its merchandise,” Michael McMullan, a spokesman, wrote in an e-mailed statement today.  Daffy’s, which doesn’t have a final date for the closure of
the business, will continue to employ its associates and give
them pay and benefits for at least 60 days, McMullan said.
Daffy’s has about 1,300 employees.  The announcement comes after  Syms Corp. (SYMSQ)  and its Filene’s
Basement LLC affiliate filed for bankruptcy in November. The
clothing chains faced a drop in consumer spending amid increased
competition, a proliferation of private-label discount chains
and a decline in buying opportunities.  Daffy’s traces its roots to 1961 when Irving Shulman opened
a store called Daffy Dan’s Bargain Town in Elizabeth,  New
Jersey , according to the company’s  website . The retailer has
locations in  New York , New Jersey and Philadelphia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
