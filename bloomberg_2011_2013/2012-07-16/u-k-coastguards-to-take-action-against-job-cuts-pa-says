U.K. Coastguards who are members of
the Public and Commercial Services union (PCS) will start a week
of industrial action today over job cuts, the Press Association
reported.  The PCS is protesting against plans to close nine of the
U.K.’s 18 rescue stations and 140 possible job cuts. Coastguards
will end their shifts an hour early in protest today and start
the next shift an hour later until 24 July, the PA said.  Members of the U.K.’s Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency
will go on strike on 27 July over office closures. The
announcement follows a strike by driving test examiners last
week as part of a dispute over job cuts at the Department for
Transport, the press service said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
