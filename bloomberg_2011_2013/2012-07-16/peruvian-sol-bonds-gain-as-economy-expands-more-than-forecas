Peruvian bonds rose, pushing yields
lower for a fifth day, after a report showing the economy
expanded more than forecast in May buoyed demand for the local
securities.  The yield on the nation’s 7.84 percent sol-denominated bond
due in August 2020 fell nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage
point, to 4.55 percent today, according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg. The price rose 0.67 centimo to 121.88 centimos per
sol.  “Growth surprised on the upside,” said  Hugo Perea , chief
economist at  BBVA Banco Continental  in  Lima . “We continue to
see foreign investors buying the local bonds, probably based on
the view that the global crisis is having a relatively low
impact on the Peruvian economy.”  Economic activity rose 6.5 percent from the same month a
year earlier, after a 4.4 percent expansion in April, the
government’s statistics agency said in an e-mailed report
yesterday. Economists predicted growth of 5.3 percent, according
to the median estimate of 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The sol advanced 0.1 percent to 2.6205 per  U.S. dollar  at
today’s close, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit. Data
from Peru’s financial regulator show that’s the strongest level
since 1997.  The central bank  bought  $31 million in the  spot market 
today to slow the sol’s advance, extending its purchases this
month to $391 million.  Demand for the currency stems from foreign investors’
purchase of local bonds and as companies buy soles to pay worker
bonuses this month, said Perea.  To contact the reporter on this story:
