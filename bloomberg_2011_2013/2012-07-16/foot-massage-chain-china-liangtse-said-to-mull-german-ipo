China Liangtse Wellness , a massage
chain with more than 300 branches in  China  and Europe, is
planning an initial public offering in Frankfurt, according to a
person with knowledge of the process.  Liangtse, founded in Shandong, China, in 1997, plans to
expand its business in Europe and seek a German listing as a
part of that strategy, said the person, who asked not to be
identified as the plans are private. Liangtse has branches in
Germany, the U.K. and Finland, according to its website. While
no final decision has been made on timing, size and valuation,
the IPO may happen as early as this year, the person said.  Chinese companies are forging ahead with small new share
sales in Germany even as Europe’s debt crisis has roiled IPO
markets in the region. Among the six newly listed companies in
Germany this year, five have ties to China.  Haikui Seafood AG (H8K)  and  Goldrooster AG (GO8)  raised a combined 18.8
million euros ($23 million) in May, while  Vange Software (VWA) , a
Chinese information technology service provider, fetched 26
million euros in June.  Fast Casualwear AG (FCA)  and  Ming Le Sports AG (ML2) ,
two clothing manufacturers, raised 21 million euros in their
IPOs this month.  A call made to Liangtse’s office in Jinan, the capital of
the northern Chinese province of Shandong, wasn’t answered
outside of regular business hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
