German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said
nations must increase climate-protection efforts or risk warming
the planet by as much as 4 degrees Celsius (7.2 Fahrenheit).  Current voluntary pledges to cut emissions are insufficient
to meet a target to limit warming since industrialization to 2
degrees, Merkel said today at a climate meeting in Berlin. A
United Nations summit this year in Qatar “must urgently provide
us with new momentum” toward a new climate treaty, she said.  Envoys from more than 190 governments who met in Durban,
 South Africa , last December agreed to discuss replacing the
 Kyoto Protocol , which sets emission-reduction targets only for
developed states. They’re seeking to devise a new climate treaty
by 2015 that will take effect by 2020.  A summit in Doha at the end of this year should be aimed at
expanding climate financing, starting to determine the carbon-
dioxide reductions needed to meet the 2-degree target, and
producing a “road map” to get to a deal by 2015, Merkel said.
“A binding treaty sounds like music to my ears,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
