ZTE Corp. (763) , China’s second-biggest
maker of telecommunications equipment, slumped the most in more
than three years in  Hong Kong  trading after the company said
first-half profit may have declined as much as 80 percent.  ZTE fell 16 percent to close at HK$10.46, the biggest drop
since October 2008. The equipment maker’s  Shenzhen-traded shares 
declined by the daily limit of 10 percent to 11.72  yuan .  First-half net income may be between 154 million yuan ($24
million) and 308 million yuan, sliding from 769.3 million yuan a
year earlier, ZTE said in a Hong Kong stock exchange filing on
July 13. The company based in Shenzhen, southern China, was
expected to post profit of 683.7 million yuan, according to the
average of three  analysts’ estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Credit Suisse Group AG cut its recommendation for ZTE’s
Hong Kong-traded shares to neutral from outperform, and reduced
the stock price estimate to HK$11.50 from HK$22, according to a
report from the brokerage today.  “Our cuts mainly reflect softer equipment orders in EU and
intensifying competition in smartphones and optical networks,”
Yan Taw Boon and Manish Nigam, Hong Kong-based analysts at
Credit Suisse, wrote in the report.  The smaller first-half profit is a result of reduced
investment income, foreign-exchange losses and delayed network
contracts, ZTE said in its filing.  Investment income in the first half declined from a year
earlier, when the company realized a gain on the disposal of a
stake in  Nationz Technologies Inc. (300077) , ZTE said.  The company also fell short of its targeted growth rate as
certain domestic carrier network contracts weren’t recognized in
the first half of this year due to “postponement of the tender
activities,” the equipment maker said, without giving details
on which orders were delayed.  ZTE’s overall gross profit margin also declined, the
company said, without providing details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
