The month of June globally was the
fourth-warmest on record since 1880 and the 328th consecutive
month with temperatures above the 20th-century average, the
 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  said.  The combined average temperature for land and sea worldwide
was 61.03 Fahrenheit (16.13 Celsius), or 1.13 degrees above the
average for the 20th century, according to the U.S. agency.  Land temperatures were the all-time warmest, averaging 1.93
degree above the 132-year record.  “Most areas of the world experienced much higher-than-
average monthly temperatures, including most of  North America 
and Eurasia and northern  Africa ,” NOAA  said in a statement .
“Only Australia, northern and western Europe and the
northwestern U.S. were notably cooler than average.”  Rising temperatures may affect food and energy supplies and
markets. A warmer-than-average U.S. winter contributed to lower
natural  gas prices , and a current heat wave and drought in the
Midwest has cut corn harvest projections and driven up prices.  Vienna,  Austria , reached 99.9 degrees June 30, the highest
temperature for the month on record in that country, according
to NOAA. The month in the U.K. was 0.5 degree below the long-
term average, making it the fourth-coolest June since 1991.  NOAA said last week the 48 contiguous U.S. states had the
warmest start to any year on records dating back to 1895.  U.S. Heat  The national temperature in the lower 48 was 52.9 degrees
from January to June, or 4.5 above average, according to  the
National Climatic Data Center  in Asheville,  North Carolina . The
12 months from July 2011 to June were also the warmest on
record.  Global land temperatures for the first half of 2012 were
1.57 degrees above the 20th-century average and ranked sixth
warmest overall, NOAA said today.  The Arctic lost 1.1 million square miles of sea ice, the
largest loss in any June. Ice coverage at the  North Pole  is now
9.8 percent below average and this year ranks second behind 2010
for the least amount, according to NOAA.  In the Antarctic, sea ice was 2.5 percent above average and
ranked as the 10th largest in the 34-year record, according to
NOAA. It is currently winter in the Southern Hemisphere.  To contact the reporter on this story:
