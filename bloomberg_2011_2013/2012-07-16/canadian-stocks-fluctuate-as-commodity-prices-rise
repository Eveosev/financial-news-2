Canadian stocks rose for a second
day as a rally in commodity prices offset concern over a slowing
global economy.  Energy companies contributed most to the advance among 10
industries in the  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX) , while
banks and raw-materials producers lost the most.  Suncor Energy
Inc. (SU) , the nation’s largest oil company, advanced 1.1 percent.
 Royal Bank of Canada (RY)  and  Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS)  retreated at least
0.2 percent.  The S&P/TSX added 6.65 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to
11,521.18. It fell as much as 0.4 percent and gained as much as
0.2 percent during the day. The index has lost 3.6 percent in
2012.  The International Monetary Fund lowered its global growth
estimate for 2013 to 3.9 percent from 4.1 percent, citing the
debt crisis in Europe as a drag on emerging markets. Oil rose
for a fourth day as manufacturing in the New York region
expanded in July at a faster pace than anticipated.  “The IMF forecast plays into the whole global growth
issue,” Chief Investment Officer  Jeff Young  at  NexGen Financial
Corp. (NFX) , who manages C$947 million, said in a phone interview.
“It may take some improvement in the leading indicators and
some improvement in the economic data before the market regains
confidence.”  The S&P GSCI Spot Index of commodities rallied 1.5 percent,
with 15 of the 24 raw materials advancing. A U.S. drought drove
grain prices higher on concern over falling harvests. Oil for
August delivery rose $1.33 to settle at $88.43 a barrel on the
New York Mercantile Exchange.  Oil Rises  Suncor added 1.1 percent to C$29.72.  Arc Resources Ltd. (ARX) ,
the western Canada oil and natural gas explorer, gained 3.2
percent to C$23.22. Imperial Oil Ltd., the second-largest energy
provider in Canada, rose 0.4 percent to C$42.54.  MEG Energy Corp. (MEG) , a Calgary-based oil sands developer,
jumped 7.2 percent to C$38.05, the most since April, after the
company boosted output targets at its oil sands project in
Alberta.  Royal Bank, the nation’s largest lender, lost 0.5 percent
to C$52.18. Bank of  Nova Scotia , the third-largest lender in
Canada, retreated 0.2 percent to C$52.13.  Goldcorp Inc. (G) , the second-largest producer of the metal,
dropped 0.6 percent to C$34.33.  Kinross Gold Corp. (K)  slumped 0.7
percent to C$8.45.  First Quantum Minerals Ltd. (FM)  declined 3.2 percent to C$16.97
