OMV AG (OMV) , central  Europe ’s biggest oil
company, fell in Vienna trading after Societe Generale analysts
said its strategy of turning itself into a “mostly upstream”
company held risks.  Shares declined 2.2 percent to 23.58 euros at the 5:30 p.m.
close of trading in the Austria capital, erasing its July 13
increase.  “OMV is attempting to do what Repsol did a few years ago
–- to turn a mostly downstream company, into a mostly upstream
company,” Irene Himona and Mehdi Ennebati, analysts at SocGen,
wrote in a note to customers. “That requires both downstream
asset sales, which in Europe could be tough to undertake at
acceptable prices, and upstream acquisitions.”  “With risks surrounding both parts of the strategy,” the
analysts cut their rating for OMV to hold from buy, and reduced
their price estimate for the stock to 25 euros from 34 euros.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
