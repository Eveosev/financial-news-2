Petropavlovsk Plc (POG) , a London-listed
producer of gold in  Russia , retreated after Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. almost halved its price estimate, citing rising costs and
high leverage.  Petropavlovsk dropped 2.1 percent to 452 pence by 11:51
a.m. in London.  Goldman Sachs cut its 12-month price estimate to 520 pence
from 980 pence today, according to an e-mailed note.  Risks to the stock’s valuation include “rising costs” and
“relatively high leverage and capital expenditure limiting
scope for debt repayment and upside in dividends in the near
term,” Yulia Chekunaeva and other analysts wrote in an e-mailed
research note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
