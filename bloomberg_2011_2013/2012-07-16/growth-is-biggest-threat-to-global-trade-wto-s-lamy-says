A deepening global slowdown may
prompt governments to take measures to shield domestic
industries, said World Trade Organization chief Pascal Lamy.  The Geneva-based trade arbiter’s top concern in the short
term is keeping protectionist pressures under control amid
deteriorating global economic conditions, Lamy said on Bloomberg
Television’s “City Central” show today.  “So far we haven’t registered the sort of tsunami of
protectionism which could have been expected in ’07 and ’08, but
our recent radar pictures show that there remain worrying trends
and that little by little, there’s a bit of that risk clogging
the arteries of the world economy in the future,” he said.  The WTO has tracked protectionist trends including tariffs,
red tape at borders, local-content requirements and anti-dumping
measures, since 2008. The WTO said in May that steps to protect
domestic companies in the previous six months had affected 3
percent of worldwide trade, up from 1 percent.  Still, Lamy sees no “risk of an explosion” in
protectionism.  “There is a gray zone between protectionism on the one
side and protection on the other side,” he said. “Our members
can absolutely legitimately take trade-restricting measures to
protect health of people, plants, animals. What is not OK with
WTO rules is to do that in such a way that in reality it’s more
about protecting your domestic producers than protecting the
health of your people and consumers.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
