Syracuse University  and the  Big East
Conference  agreed on a $7.5 million cash buyout that will allow
the school to move to the Atlantic Coast Conference as scheduled
in 2013.  One of the  Big East ’s founding schools in 1979, Syracuse
announced in September that it was leaving to accept an
invitation from the ACC.  The Big East typically requires schools to pay a $5 million
exit fee and give 27 month notice before leaving. As part of the
agreement, Big East members will vote to terminate Syracuse’s
membership effective July 1, 2013.  “This closes a chapter and opens a new one filled with
exciting possibilities for the Big East’s future,” Joe Bailey,
the conference’s interim commissioner, said in a statement.
“With the recent addition of eight schools to the Big East, the
future for the conference has never been brighter.”  The Big East lost  Texas Christian University  and West
Virginia to the Big 12 conference, and will also lose Pittsburgh
to the ACC. TCU left before it ever played a Big East game.  The conference offset those losses by luring eight  new
members .  Temple University  will join this year. The University
of Memphis,  Southern Methodist University , the University of
Central Florida, the University of Houston, Boise State
University and San Diego State University will join in 2013, and
the U.S. Naval Academy will be added in 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
