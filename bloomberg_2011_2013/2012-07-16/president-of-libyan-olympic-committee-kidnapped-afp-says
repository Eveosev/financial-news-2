The President of  Libya ’s Olympic
Committee, Nabil al-Alam, has been kidnapped by gunmen in
Tripoli and taken to a secret location, Agence France-Presse
said citing Libyan committee officials.  “Nine gunmen posing as members of the Libyan army removed
Mr Alam from his car in the centre of the city at around 3:00
p.m. and took him to an unknown location,” Alam’s aide, Arafat
Juwan, told AFP.  Alam was due to arrive in London this week, along with
Lybia’s Olympic representatives, ahead of the Games opening
ceremony on 27 July, AFP said.  Before last year’s revolt, which toppled Muammar Qaddafi’s
regime, the Libyan Olympic Committee was headed by Qaddafi’s son
Mohammed, the press service said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
