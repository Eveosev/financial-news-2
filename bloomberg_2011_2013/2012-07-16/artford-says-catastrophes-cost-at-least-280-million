Hartford Financial Services Group
Inc. (HIG) , the insurer that counts  John Paulson  as its largest
investor, said catastrophes cost as much as $300 million last
quarter as hail struck Texas and windstorms hit states including
Maryland and Virginia.  The cost was at least $280 million, according to a
statement today from Hartford, which is based in the Connecticut
city of the same name. Second-quarter results will also include
a cost of at least $45 million after the company found reserves
had been inadequate as part of its annual review of asbestos and
environmental lines.  “The  United States  endured a highly active month, with
multiple natural disaster perils occurring from coast to
coast,” insurance broker Aon Plc said in a  report  last week.  Hartford Chief Executive Officer Liam McGee is counting on
profit from property and casualty policies as the insurer limits
life insurance operations to narrow its focus. Paulson has said
the life business pressures the company’s stock price.  The insurer dropped as much as 3.3 percent in extended
trading. Hartford has gained about 1.9 percent this year on the
 New York  Stock Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
