Indian Oil Corp. (IOCL)  is offering to pay
a margin of 195 basis points over the London interbank offered
rate for a $300 million loan currently being marketed to banks
in syndication, according to a person familiar with the matter.  The company will market the facility to lenders in  Asia 
next week with meetings planned in  Tokyo  on July 23, Taipei on
July 25 and Singapore on July 26, the person said, asking not to

are due by Aug. 20, the person said.  Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd., Mizuho Corporate Bank
Ltd.,  State Bank  of India and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. are
arranging the facility, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  P.K. Goyal, Indian Oilâ€™s director of finance, was in a
meeting and not immediately available to comment on the
financing when contacted at his office today.  Banks pledging $15 million or above will receive a 194
