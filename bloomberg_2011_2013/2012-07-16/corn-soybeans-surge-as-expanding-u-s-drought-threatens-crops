Corn futures rose to a 10-month high
and soybeans extended a rally to the costliest since 2008 on
speculation that an expanding drought will cut supplies from the
U.S., the world’s biggest producer of the crops.  Most of the Midwest will be unusually dry and hot in the
next 10 days as occasional showers will be too light to induce
more than brief crop improvement,  T-Storm Weather LLC  in  Chicago 
said in a report. July is on pace to rank as the third driest
and warmest in 118 years of data, the private forecaster said.
Soybean-meal futures climbed to a record.  “The crops are shrinking daily, and the market is pricing
in the risk for less available supply for export and domestic
usage,”  Jim Gerlach , the president of A/C Trading Inc. in
Fowler,  Indiana , said in a telephone interview. “The path of
least resistance is for higher prices until the crops get enough
rain to stabilize yields. Demand is already starting to slow.”  Corn futures for December delivery jumped 4.4 percent to
close at $7.725 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the biggest gain in a week. Earlier, the price reached
$7.78, the highest for a most-active contract since Aug. 29. The
grain used to make food,  animal feed  and ethanol fuel has surged
53 percent since June 15 as the hot, dry weather intensified.  Soybean futures for November delivery rose 2.4 percent to
$15.905 a bushel on the CBOT. Earlier, the price reached
$15.985, the highest since July 2008.  Soybean-meal futures for December delivery gained 2.3
percent to $463.80 per 2,000 pounds in Chicago. Earlier, the
commodity, used in livestock feed, reached a record $470.70.  About 63 percent of the Midwest, where farmers harvested 60
percent of last year’s U.S. crop, had moderate to extreme
 drought  conditions as of July 10, the highest since the
government-funded U.S. Drought Monitor in Lincoln,  Nebraska ,
began tracking the data in 2000. About 40 percent of the
nation’s corn and soybeans were in good or excellent condition
as of July 8, the lowest for that date since 1988, government
data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
