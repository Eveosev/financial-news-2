Credit-card company agreements to
reduce merchant fees and permit surcharges may make card
purchases more expensive for consumers and reduce the quality of
credit-card-backed security pools, according to  Fitch Ratings .  Concessions to vendors will probably make credit-card
purchases pricier and dissuade more creditworthy holders from
making transactions, Fitch analysts led by Michael Dean wrote in
a report today. The decline in volume may shift the make-up of
credit-card securities pools to a higher percentage of lower-
quality consumers, reducing yields by as much as 5 percent, the
New York-based ratings agency said.  “With less incentive to charge purchases, high-quality
cardholders that pay their balances in full each month could
become a smaller proportion of the collateral pools,” Dean
wrote. “This could result in performance issues as more
receivables are associated with cardholders who carry balances
and tend to be of lower  credit quality .”  Dropping yields may be offset by an increase in interest
payments, according to Dean.  Credit-card companies agreed last week to pay $6.05 billion
to merchants, trim the fees vendors have to pay on transactions
for eight months and allow extra charges on credit-card
purchases in states where it is legal, according to the report.  The terms of the settlement may be altered based on the
outcome of a challenge from the National Association of
Convenience Stores seeking to secure greater vendor control over
credit-card transactions, Dean wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
