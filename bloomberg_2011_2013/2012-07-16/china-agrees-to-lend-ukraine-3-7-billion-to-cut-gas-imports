China agreed to open a $3.7 billion
 credit line  for Ukraine to build coal gasification plants and
cut down on natural-gas consumption, according to the  Ukrainian
Energy and Coal Industry Ministry .  The funds will be also spent on encouraging utilities to
switch to coal instead of gas, the ministry, based in the
capital of Kiev, said today in an e-mailed statement. The
agreement was signed on July 13.  Ukraine, which relies on  Russia  for more than 70 percent of
its gas needs, wants to cut consumption of the fuel after prices
jumped to $425 per thousand cubic meters last quarter.  Gas imports of 45 billion cubic meters of gas from Russia
last year cost $13.9 billion, or 8.4 percent of Ukraineâ€™s gross
domestic product, Deputy Finance Minister Anatilyi Myarkovskyi
said March 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
