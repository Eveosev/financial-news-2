Dubai’s  benchmark stock index 
climbed to the highest in more than two months amid investor
speculation  Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) ’s second-quarter earnings may
beat estimates.  Emaar, the developer of the world’s tallest skyscraper in
Dubai, advanced to the highest since May 1.  Deyaar Development (DEYAAR) 
PJSC, a Dubai-based property developer, closed at the highest
since June 13. The benchmark  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  climbed 0.9
percent to 1,516.53, the highest level since May 9, at the 2
p.m. close in the emirate.  Oman’s measure  gained 0.6 percent
after BankMuscat SAOG, the country’s biggest bank by assets,
reported a 20 percent increase in first-half profit.  The gain in Dubai is “driven by renewed buying interest in
Emaar on anticipation of better second-quarter numbers,” said
 Julian Bruce , the Dubai-based director of institutional sales
trading at EFG-Hermes Holding SAE.  Emaar’s  second-quarter profit  will more than double to 551
million dirhams ($150 million), according to the mean estimate
of four analysts on Bloomberg. Emaar, which has the heaviest
weighting on the benchmark index, is scheduled to release
financial results later this month. The stock has climbed 26
percent this year, more than double the DFM General Index.  Emaar rose 2.5 percent to 3.23 dirhams. Deyaar increased
2.7 percent to 31 fils. There are 100 fils to the dirham.  BankMuscat rallied 2.9 percent to 0.526 rial. Second-
quarter profit rose to 35 million rials ($91 million) from 29.4
million rials a year earlier, beating analysts’ estimates,
according to Bloomberg calculations based on first half
earnings. The mean estimate of six analysts was for a profit of
33.3 million rials, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Bloomberg GCC 200 Index rose 0.1 percent at 1:20 p.m.
in Riyadh, while Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul All Share Index lost 0.1
percent.  Abu Dhabi ’s ADX General Index fell 0.2 percent and
Kuwait’s gauge gained less than 0.1 percent. Qatar’s QE Index
advanced 0.1 percent and Bahrain’s measure rose 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
