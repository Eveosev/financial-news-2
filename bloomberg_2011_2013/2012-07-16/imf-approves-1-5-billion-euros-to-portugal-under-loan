The  International Monetary Fund 
approved a disbursement to  Portugal  of about 1.5 billion euros
($1.8 billion) after reviewing implementation of policies
attached to an aid package with the European Union.  “The authorities’ strong program implementation, despite
the difficult euro area environment, is commendable, and there
are welcome signs of adjustment in the fiscal and external
accounts,” IMF Deputy Managing Director Nemat Shafik said in a
statement released in  Washington .  “Given the daunting challenges that Portugal still faces,
it will be important to maintain the commitment to strong
policies and structural reforms to foster sustainable growth,
especially through labor and product markets reform, to
strengthen debt dynamics, and to regain  market access ,” she
said.  Portugal is cutting spending and raising taxes as it tries
to comply with the terms of the 78 billion-euro international
rescue plan. Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  said on March 5
that if the country can’t tap bond markets by September 2013 due
to “external reasons,” it would be able to count on continued
support from the IMF and the EU.  Portugal’s  10-year bond yield  is now at about 10 percent,
while two-year debt yields 7.6 percent.  Shafik said that the country’s fiscal consolidation “is on
track” and that current targets can still be reached, even if
risks have increased.  To contact the reporters on this story:
