China ’s yuan halted a three-day drop
after Premier  Wen Jiabao  reiterated that his government will
implement policies to steer economic growth.  Wen warned the momentum for a recovery in growth isn’t yet
in place and that “difficulties” may persist for a while, the
official Xinhua News Agency reported yesterday. The government
will step up policy fine-tuning in the second half, he said. The
central bank may cut  interest rates  by as much as one percentage
point in the coming year, two-year swap rates showed.  “China has to act as quickly as possible to safeguard
growth,” said Banny Lam, Hong Kong-based chief economist at CCB
International Securities Ltd., a unit of China’s second-largest
bank. “The hopes of more stimulus measures are supporting the
 yuan  today.”  The currency closed at 6.3787 per dollar in  Shanghai , from
last week’s 6.3789, according to the China Foreign Exchange
Trade System. The currency gained as much as 0.06 percent to
6.3748 earlier. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, was unchanged at
1.45 percent.  Asia’s largest economy  expanded  7.6 percent in the second
quarter from a year earlier, the slowest pace in three years,
official data showed last week.  The People’s Bank of China set the yuan’s  reference rate 
0.06 percent stronger at 6.3208 per dollar, raising it for the
first time in almost a week. The currency is allowed to trade as
much as 1 percent on either side of the fixing.  In  Hong Kong ’s offshore market, the yuan traded at 6.3773
per dollar, little changed from last week’s 6.3766. Twelve-month
non-deliverable forwards rose 0.04 percent to 6.4185, a 0.6
percent discount to the onshore spot rate, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
