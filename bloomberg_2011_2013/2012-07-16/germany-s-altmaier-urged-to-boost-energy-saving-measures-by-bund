German Environment Minister  Peter Altmaier , who told  Bild  newspaper the nation may miss energy-
efficiency targets, was urged to introduce stricter measures to
reduce power use by environmental group BUND.  Altmaier told Bild that Germany may not reach a goal to cut
power consumption 10 percent by 2020. His comments undermine the
country’s energy overhaul and international climate-protection
efforts just as the minister meets representatives from 30
countries in Berlin today to discuss  climate change , said Hubert
Weiger, the head of BUND.  “Germany can only demand as much from international
climate-protection efforts as it pushes through at home,”
Weiger said in an e-mailed statement.  Germany’s decision to phase out nuclear-energy generation
by 2022 is coupled with plans to increase  energy efficiency  and
raise the share of renewable-energy output in its power mix to
at least 35 percent by the end of this decade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
