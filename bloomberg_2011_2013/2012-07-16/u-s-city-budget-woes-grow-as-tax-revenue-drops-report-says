U.S. local property taxes fell in
the first three months of 2012, following two quarters of
growth, according to a report from the Nelson A.  Rockefeller
Institute  of Government.  The drop raises the prospect of “serious budget problems”
for municipalities because it coincides with employee benefit
costs soaring and states cutting local aid, wrote Lucy Dadayan,
a senior policy analyst at the institute who co-wrote the
report.  “This weakness in property tax revenue comes at a tough
time for local governments,” Dadayan said today in a  statement. 
“Budget pressures are coming at local governments from every
angle and affect both the revenue and spending side of municipal
and school budgets.”  Local property-tax collections fell 0.9 percent in the
first three months of this year, according to the institute. It
marked the sixth consecutive quarterly decline when collections
are adjusted for inflation, the  Albany , New York-based institute
said. Property taxes are the most significant revenue source
used to finance local services such as K-12 education, police
and fire protection.  Adjusted for inflation, local property taxes declined by
2.8 percent in the first quarter of 2012, the institute said.  The weakness is most acute in states such as California
that have experienced the largest declines in housing prices,
according to the  report . Three California cities have sought
 bankruptcy protection  in the last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
