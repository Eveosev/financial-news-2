Fan Milk Ltd. (FML) , a maker of ice cream
and frozen yogurt in  Ghana , rose to the highest in six weeks as
investors speculated first-half profit probably increased.  The shares rose 1 percent to 1.98 cedis as of the close in
the capital, Accra, the highest since June 4.  “We expect cost cutting to bolster the company’s earnings
in the first half while it did not increase the price of its
products,” Xorlali Torsu, a stock trader at Databank Financial
Services Ltd. in Accra, said by phone today. “Our expectation
is profit growth of about 25 percent from a year earlier.”  Fan Milk’s profit after tax increased 25 percent to 6.5
million cedis ($3.3 million) in the three months through March,
it said on April 23. Revenue increased to 35.7 million cedis
from 25.5 million cedis.  The company’s first-half results will be out by the end of
this month, Torsu said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
