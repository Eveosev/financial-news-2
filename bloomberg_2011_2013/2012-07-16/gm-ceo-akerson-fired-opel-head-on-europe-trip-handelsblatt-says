General Motors Co. (GM)  Chief Executive
Officer Dan Akerson fired Opel chief Karl-Friedrich Stracke
during a visit to the German unit’s Ruesselsheim headquarters on
July 12,  Handelsblatt  reported, without saying where it got the
information.  Akerson “impulsively” asked Stracke to resign after the
German said that Opel would fall short of a 2016 savings target
by more than 100 million euros ($122 million), according to
Handelsblatt.  Opel’s supervisory board will meet tomorrow to appoint 47-
year-old Thomas Sedran, the management board member responsible
for strategy, to succeed Stracke as CEO, Handelsblatt said,
citing unidentified people at the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
