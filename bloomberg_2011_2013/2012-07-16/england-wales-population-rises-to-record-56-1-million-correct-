(Corrects headline, first paragraph to show population is
for England and  Wales .)  The population of England and Wales
rose to a record 56.1 million people in 2011, according to
preliminary data from the census.  The population increased by 3.7 million, or 7.1 percent, in
the 10 years since the previous census in 2001, the  Office for
National Statistics  said on its website today. That’s the
largest increase since the census began in 1801.  The percentage of the population aged 65 and over was the
highest seen in any census, at 16.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
