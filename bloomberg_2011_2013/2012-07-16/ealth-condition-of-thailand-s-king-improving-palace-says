The health of  Thailand ’s King
Bhumibol Adulyadej is getting “progressively better” after he
experienced an elevated heart rate last week, the Office of His
Majesty’s Principal Private Secretary said in a statement today.  Tests of his brain yesterday showed no “abnormality” and
that “minute subdural bleeding in the left frontal area had
ceased,” the statement said.  The king, 84, experienced intermittent twitching of his
right hand and elevated heartbeat, according to a July 13
