RWE Supply & Trading GmbH’s managing
director and chief commercial officer Peter Kreuzberg left his
position on July 13, the company said.  Kreuzberg, who had been at the trading unit of  RWE AG (RWE)  since
October 2004, will be taking a sabbatical, Barbara Minderjahn, a
company spokeswoman, said by telephone from Essen.  Kreuzberg had been involved in developing RWE’s proprietary
trading activities, Leonhard Birnbaum, chief commercial officer
of RWE Group AG, said in an e-mailed statement.  RWE S&T will reduce its management board from five to three
people, consisting of Chief Executive Stefan Judisch, Chief
Financial Officer Bernhard Guenther and Chief Commercial Officer
for asset optimization Alan Robinson, Minderjahn said. Judisch
will assume responsibility for all energy trading, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
