Singapore home sales posted their
biggest drop in 2 ½ years in the second quarter as prices
rebounded to a record, a government report showed.  The island state’s private residential property sales
declined 17 percent to 5,572 units in the three months ended
June 30 from the previous quarter, according to  data  released by
the  Urban Redevelopment Authority  today. That’s the biggest
quarterly decrease since the three months ended December 2009.
Home sales have climbed to 12,254 units this year through June
30, according to data from the authority.  Singapore has been attempting to rein in prices since 2009,
when it barred interest-only loans for some housing projects and
stopped allowing developers to absorb interest payments for
apartments still being built. The government last week said it
is prepared to enhance measures aimed at ensuring a “stable and
sustainable” housing market, even as gains in  home prices 
slowed this year.  “Sales have been unnaturally high from January to May,” said
Nicholas Mak,  executive director  at SLP International Property
Consultants, a real estate consulting company. “It’s good news
that the sales have come off a little as it might now take some
pressure off on additional government measures, now that prices
have stabilized and sales are down to more sustainable levels.”  More measures were introduced in December. Foreigners and
corporate entities have to pay an additional 10 percent stamp
duty. The extra levy is 3 percent for permanent residents
purchasing a second home and for citizens buying their third
residential property.  Government Curbs  The government earlier imposed a 1 percent duty on the
first S$180,000 ($142,000) of the property price, 2 percent on
the next S$180,000 and 3 percent for the remainder. In January
2011, the government also raised down-payment requirements for
second mortgages and extended the period homeowners must hold
their properties to avoid a sales transaction tax to fend off
speculators.  Prices of non-landed private residential properties
increased by 0.6 percent in the Core Central Region in the
quarter compared with a decrease of 0.6 percent in the three
months to March 31, a separate government report showed earlier
this month. Prices in Outside Central Region climbed at a slower
pace of 0.4 percent in the quarter, compared with a gain of 1.1
percent in the previous quarter.  Home sales in June fell 20 percent to 1,371 units from a
month ago, according to today’s report. Private housing sales
slid to their lowest this year from the 2012 peak of 2,496 units
in April, according to the data.  Private home price growth slowed to 0.3 percent in the
first half compared with a 6 percent increase for the whole of
2011, the Ministry of National Development said in a  statement 
on its website last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
