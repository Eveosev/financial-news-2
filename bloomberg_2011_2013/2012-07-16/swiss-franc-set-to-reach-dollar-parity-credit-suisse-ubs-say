Switzerland ’s franc is weakening
toward parity with the dollar, dragged down by a tumbling euro,
analysts at  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  and  Swissquote Bank SA (SQN)  said.  The franc fell to its lowest level in 19 months at the end
of last week, trading 1.3 percent from one-to-one with the
greenback. It has dropped about 20 percent against the dollar
since the  Swiss National Bank  imposed a cap on the currency’s
appreciation in September to ease a strain on exporters. The SNB
has vowed to defend its 1.20 per euro limit.  “If we think the SNB is intervening, then they are
essentially recycling the euros into a series of other
currencies, 50 percent of which are going to be dollars,” said
 Chris Walker , a currency strategist at UBS AG in London.
“That’s going to push the dollar-franc higher.”  The franc weakened 0.2 percent to 98.24 centimes per dollar
at 7:52 a.m. London time, after depreciating to 98.73 centimes
on July 13, the weakest level since Dec. 9, 2010. Switzerland’s
currency was at 1.20103 per euro, from 1.20090 last week.  The euro depreciated 0.2 percent to $1.2225, down 5.7
percent this year.  “If the euro weakens due to global risk aversion toward
$1.20, we would expect dollar-franc to reach parity,” said
Bernd Berg, a foreign-exchange strategist at Credit Suisse in
Zurich.  The SNB imposed its limit after investors sent the franc
almost to parity with the euro in August as they sought a haven
from the deepening euro-area financial turmoil and ward off the
risk of deflation.  Franc parity with the dollar won’t boost Swiss inflation,
said Peter Rosenstreich, Geneva-based chief currency analyst at
Swissquote.  “It’s not going to have the overarching effect that people
expect it to have,” he said. “The Swiss economy is more
related to the euro economy.”  The franc-dollar pair will reach parity “within the coming
month,” Rosenstreich said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
