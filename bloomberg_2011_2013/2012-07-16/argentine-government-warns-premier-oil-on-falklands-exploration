The Argentine government sent a
letter to  Premier Oil Plc (PMO) , a U.K. explorer, letting them know
that it has declared illegal the exploration activity around the
territory in dispute.  The letter to Premier was sent today by the Argentine
Embassy in the U.S., the Argentine Foreign Ministry said in an
e-mailed statement.  Premier said it will buy 60 percent of  Rockhopper
Exploration Plc (RKH) ’s Falkland assets and that it plans to invest $2
billion to produce the Falkland Islands’ first oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
