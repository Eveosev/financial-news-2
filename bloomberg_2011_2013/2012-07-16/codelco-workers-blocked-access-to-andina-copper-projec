Codelco workers blocked access to a
copper mining project yesterday for three hours, delaying the
start of a morning shift, newspaper  El Mercurio  reported, citing
a union leader.  The workers closed down an international highway leading to
Andina in the Valparaiso region between 4:30 a.m. and 7:30 a.m.
local time yesterday, the Santiago-based newspaper  said  in its
online edition Emol.com. The workers are demanding better pay
terms, the newspaper said, quoting Guillermo Candia, president
of the Gardilcic union.  Susana Mena, a spokeswoman for Codelco, didnâ€™t immediately
respond to telephone calls and an e-mail seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
