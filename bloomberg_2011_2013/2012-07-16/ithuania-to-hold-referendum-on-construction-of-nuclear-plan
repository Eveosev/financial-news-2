Lithuanian lawmakers approved a
proposal to hold a referendum on whether to build a new nuclear
power plant, rebuffing calls from Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius to reject the initiative.  Parliament voted 62-39, with 18 abstentions, to hold the
plebiscite in October along with parliamentary elections,
according to the  vote-count  on the parliament’s website.  The Baltic region is seeking to cut its dependence on
energy imports from  Russia  by constructing a 1,300-megawatt
reactor in Visaginas, 150 kilometers (93 miles) northeast of
Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital. The Lithuanian government had
planned to sign an agreement with  Japan ’s  Hitachi Ltd. (6501)  to
proceed with engineering and preparation work.  Lithuania plans to hold a preliminary stake of 38 percent
in the Visaginas facility, which will cost as much as $6.5
billion, according to initial estimates. Estonia may own 22
percent, while Latvia and Hitachi will each hold 20 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
