Campaigning was fun -- up to a point, wrote  Geraldine Ferraro , the 1984 Democratic nominee for vice president: “Every time I faced the press, however, I was besieged with questions about our finances. It was brutal.” If  Mitt Romney  is feeling misunderstood and put upon, he might want to pick up Ferraro's  memoir  and read about the frenzy over her financial disclosure forms and her husband's tax returns.  Then again, he might not. Ferraro and her husband, John Zaccaro, had assets of less than $4 million. Mitt Romney may be worth 100 times that. Ferraro,  Walter Mondale 's surprise pick in 1984 as his vice presidential nominee, had days (that stretched excruciatingly to weeks) to get her affairs in order. Romney, by a conservative measure, has been running for president for five years. Zaccaro ran a small real estate company with haphazard accounting. Romney ran a powerful private equity firm with high-octane accountants and lawyers to manage the details. Still, given that even many Republicans have called on Romney to release his taxes, the reading might be instructive. Romney is having serious trouble explaining how he could be chairman, CEO and president of Bain without being involved. Here's Ferraro on the difficulty of explaining how she was officially listed as a principal of a firm while being largely ignorant of its actual operations: In order to put the tax questions to rest, Ferraro on Aug. 21, 1984 did something that seems unimaginable in the scripted reality show that is a 21st century campaign. A couple hundred journalists crammed into the ballroom of the Viscount Hotel near Kennedy Airport. After prepping for hours, Ferraro told them she would answer every question from every person in the room. After almost two hours in front of  a battery of microphones, she won respect but no respite. Here is Sam Roberts'  account  in the next day's  New York  Times: The New York Times article hinted that Ferraro's troubles might not be over: Those questions never stopped. Not even after the 1984 campaign ended. When Ferraro ran unsuccessfully for  U.S. Senate  in 1992 (and employed this blogger), the same questions resurfaced. No one outside Romney's camp knows what his taxes contain, or whether releasing them will settle the issues or raise new (and potentially more damaging) questions. As it happened, Ferraro and Zaccaro paid, on average, about 40 percent of their income in taxes. That's one plot point from which Romney's story surely diverges from Ferraro's.
