Euro-area sovereign-bond spreads
aren’t justified by countries’ economic situations and underline
the need for deeper changes to the currency union, the
 International Monetary Fund  said.  Spanish and Italian 10-year bonds yield more than 6
percent, compared with 1.2 percent for the equivalent securities
in  Germany .  “Current sovereign spreads are well above what could be
justified on the basis of fiscal and other long-term
fundamentals, suggesting that wide-ranging reforms durably
affecting expectations are needed,” the Washington-based IMF
said today in its Fiscal Monitor report. The plan backed by
European leaders on June 29 is a step in the right direction,
though it “will need to be complemented by more progress toward
deeper fiscal integration and full-fledged banking union.”  The IMF report lauded plans to ease Spain’s deficit-
reduction targets and said the budget-cutting path proposed by
 France  is “appropriate” for now. For the U.S., the looming
expiry of tax provisions known as the “fiscal cliff” remains a
“significant concern,” the IMF said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
