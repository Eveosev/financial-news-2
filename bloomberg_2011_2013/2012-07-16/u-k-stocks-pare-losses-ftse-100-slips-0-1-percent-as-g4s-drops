U.K. stocks declined, led by bank
shares, as investigations into allegations of interest-rate
manipulation intensified on both sides of the Atlantic.  The FTSE 100 Index dropped 0.2 percent to 5,652.33 at 9:59
a.m. in  London . The FTSE All-Share Index also lost 0.2 percent,
while Irelandâ€™s ISEQ Index gained 0.2 percent.  Libor investigations on both sides of the Atlantic
intensified as  Barclays Plc (BARC)  traders could face possible U.S.
charges by September and British lawmakers may use hearings this
week to expand their inquiry to other banks tied to the global
financial scandal.  Barclays retreated 3.3 percent to 156.85 pence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
