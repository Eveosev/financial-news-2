Japanese and Australian  stock 
 futures  were little changed after U.S. retail sales dropped and
the yen rose to a one-month high against the dollar, offsetting
investor optimism that China may take further steps to boost its
economy amid a global slowdown.  American depositary receipts of machinery maker  Komatsu
Ltd. (6301) , which gets 14 percent of its sales in China, rose 0.4
percent from the closing share price in  Tokyo . ADRs of  Sony
Corp. (6758) , Japan’s No. 1 exporter of consumer electronics, lost 0.4
percent. Those of  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , Australia’s biggest mining
company and oil producer, fell 0.4 percent after JPMorgan Chase
& Co. said it prefers rival  Rio Tinto Group. (RIO)   Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  expiring in
September were bid in the pre-market at 8,740 in Osaka at 8:05
a.m. local time after closing at 8,800 in Chicago on July 13.
Japan’s equity markets were closed yesterday for a public
holiday. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index were little
changed today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index was little changed in
Wellington.  “As tightening measures have slowed  China ’s growth, the
market’s focus is shifting to stimulus measures such as an
interest-rate cut,” said Koichi Kurose, chief economist in
Tokyo at Resona Bank Ltd., which oversees about 15 trillion yen
($190 billion). “One thing to remember is that the yen is on
the rise. Japan’s equities are sensitive to the yen’s level,
which is likely to put a lid on the market.”  China Stimulus  Premier Wen said momentum for a recovery in Chinese
economic growth isn’t yet in place and that “difficulties” may
persist for a while, the official Xinhua News Agency reported on
July 15. The government will step up policy fine-tuning in the
second half of this year to support growth, Wen said,
reiterating comments he made during a visit to eastern Jiangsu
province earlier this month. The comments drove a 0.4 percent
increase yesterday in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  fell less than
0.1 percent today. The index lost 0.2 percent in New York
yesterday after U.S. retail sales unexpectedly dropped 0.5
percent in June.  The yen reached 78.69 against the dollar yesterday, the
strongest level since June 18. A stronger yen reduces the value
of overseas earnings for Japanese exporters when repatriated.  Shares also fell after the  International Monetary Fund  cut
its global economic growth forecast as Europe’s debt crisis
prolongs Spain’s recession and slows expansions in  emerging
markets .  Global Growth  Growth worldwide will be 3.9 percent next year, less than
the 4.1 percent estimate in April, the IMF predicted in an
update of its World Economic Outlook.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 1.7 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 7.6 percent gain by the  S&P
500  and a 5 percent increase by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 11.8 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 13 times for the S&P 500 and
10.8 times for the Stoxx 600.  The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Chinese shares in New York lost 1.4 percent to 86.55 yesterday,
the lowest level since Oct 5.  To contact the reporters on this story:
