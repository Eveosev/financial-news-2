The French government will not make
a payroll tax on overtime hours retroactive to Jan. 1,  Les Echos 
reported without saying where it got the information.  Only overtime hours from Aug. 1 will be affected, the
newspaper said. The wealth tax increase paid by the wealthiest
10 percent of residents will be three times higher than had been
expected,  Les Echos  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
