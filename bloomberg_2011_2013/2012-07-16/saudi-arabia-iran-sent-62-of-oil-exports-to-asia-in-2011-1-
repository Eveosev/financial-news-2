Saudi Arabia  and Iran shipped about
62 percent of their oil exports to buyers in the Asia-Pacific
region last year, according to data in OPEC’s  Annual Statistical
Bulletin .  Asian buyers received 4.5 million barrels a day of Saudi
crude last year, rising from 4.3 million in 2010, the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries said in the report
today. Iran shipped 1.4 million barrels a day to Asia in 2011,
compared with 1.6 million the previous year.  The producer group’s exports to  North America  and Western
Europe fell in 2011 as total consumption of oil in those regions
shrank 1.2 percent and 2.1 percent, respectively.  The world’s five biggest crude exporters last year were
Saudi Arabia at 7.2 million barrels a day, Russia at 5.8
million, Nigeria at 2.4 million,  United Arab Emirates  at 2.3
million and Iran at 2.3 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
