Romania ’s power struggle between the
country’s ruling coalition and suspended President Traian Basescu and the impeachment vote later this month have increased
market concerns about the country’s fiscal tightening and are
“credit negative,” Moody’s Investors Service said.  “Political uncertainty may persist until, and even beyond,
national elections scheduled in the last quarter of 2012 and
will likely hinder structural reforms in Romania’s vast state
enterprise sector,” Moody’s analysts Atsi Sheth and Andrew Schneider wrote in the rating company’s Weekly Credit Outlook
published today.  International criticism of the political process “has
added to market concerns and, if it not adequately addressed, it
could impair relations between Romania and the EU, which has
been an important source of institutional and financial support
for Romania,” the two analysts said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
