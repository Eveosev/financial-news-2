Brazil’s oil regulator is preparing
about 50 million reais ($25 million) in fines against  Chevron
Corp. (CVX)  related to an oil spill last November at the Frade field
off the coast of  Rio de Janeiro ,  Agencia Estado  reported today.  Chevron won’t be able to resume drilling at the Frade field
until the regulator completes an investigation of a second spill
at the area in March, Estado quoted Magda Chambriard, the head
of Brazil’s oil regulator ANP, as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
