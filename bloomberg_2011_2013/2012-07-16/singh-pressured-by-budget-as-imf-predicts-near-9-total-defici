India’s estimated overall fiscal
deficits for 2012-2013 were revised up to almost 9 percent by
the  International Monetary Fund , which cited higher fuel
subsidies and revenue shortfalls.  “A determined reduction in costly subsidies would be a
strong signal of a credible fiscal turnaround,” the  IMF  said in
its Global Financial Stability Report Update released today.
“It would also allow relaxation of financial restrictions,
spurring private investment and growth.”  India’s central bank has signaled that efforts to curb the
budget shortfall will boost its scope to cut  interest rates  as
economic growth slows. The IMF projected an 8.9 percent gap for
2012 and 8.8 percent for 2013.  Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh , who took over the finance
ministry last month, has pledged to revive Indian growth after
expansion slowed to 5.3 percent in the first quarter from a year
earlier, the slowest pace in almost a decade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
