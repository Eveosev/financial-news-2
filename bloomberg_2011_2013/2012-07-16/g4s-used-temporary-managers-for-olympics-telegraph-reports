G4S Plc (GFS) , the U.K. security company
hired to provide security at the London Olympics, was using
fewer than 10 permanent staff as part of a 700-strong managerial
force for the 284 million pound ($442 million) contract, the
 Daily Telegraph  reported, without saying where it obtained the
information.  G4S said using temporary managers would keep costs down and
they would not necessarily be less competent than permanent
staff, according to the newspaper. The company has now brought
in a new 12-strong team of senior executives to prevent further
disruption after the U.K. government drafted 3,500 military
personnel to fill staffing shortfalls, the Telegraph said.  The London 2012 Olympic Games will begin on 27 July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
