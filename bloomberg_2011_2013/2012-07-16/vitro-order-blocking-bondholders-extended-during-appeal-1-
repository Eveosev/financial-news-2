Vitro SAB (VITROA)  bondholders will remain
blocked from seizing assets of the Mexican glassmaker while an
appeal over the company’s bankruptcy plan is pending, an appeals
court decided.  The stay that a bankruptcy judge in Dallas imposed last
month will “remain in place during the pendency of this appeal
or until further order of this court,” the  U.S. Court of
Appeals  in New Orleans said today.  Vitro appealed after U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Harlin DeWayne Hale refused to enforce the company’s Mexican reorganization
plan in the U.S. last month, saying it was “manifestly
contrary” to U.S. public policy. A Mexican court approved the
plan in February, after more than a year of legal battles
between Vitro and bondholders including Paul Singer’s Elliott
Management Corp.  The company is pleased the appeals court “extended the
temporary restraining order, thereby providing important clarity
and certainty for Vitro’s U.S. customers throughout the appeal
process,” said Roberto Riva Palacio, a spokesman for Vitro,
which is based in San Pedro Garza Garcia, Mexico.  Donald Cutler, a spokesman for bondholders, declined to
comment.  The case is Vitro SAB v. Ad Hoc Group of Vitro Noteholders,
12-10689, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (New
Orleans).  To contact the reporters on this story:
