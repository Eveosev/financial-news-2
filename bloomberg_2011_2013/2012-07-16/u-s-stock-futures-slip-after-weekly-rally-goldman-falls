U.S. stocks fell, dragging the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lower for the seventh time in eight
days, after the  International Monetary Fund  cut its global
economic forecast and retail sales unexpectedly dropped.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  lost 2.7 percent while Home Depot Inc.
and  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  dropped more than 1 percent to lead the  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  lower. Equities pared losses as energy
companies rose with the price of oil while  Visa (V)  Inc. and
 MasterCard (MA)  Inc., the world’s biggest payment networks, gained at
least 1.7 percent after agreeing to a settlement of at least
$6.05 billion in a price-fixing case.  The S&P 500 declined 0.2 percent to 1,353.64 at 4 p.m.  New
York  time after earlier retreating as much as 0.6 percent. The
Dow slipped 49.88 points, or 0.4 percent, to 12,727.21 today.  “The retail sales gives you another indicator that
uncertainty has showed up in the consumer side,” James Dunigan,
who helps oversee $112 billion as chief investment officer in
Philadelphia for PNC Wealth Management, said in a telephone
interview. “We’re in a bit of the summer doldrums.”  The  S&P 500  is down 4.6 percent from a four-year high in
April as economic data trails forecasts and investors brace for
what is projected to be the first decrease in quarterly earnings
since 2009. The Citigroup Economic Surprise Index for the U.S.,
which measures how much data from the past three months is
beating or missing the median estimates in Bloomberg surveys, is
at minus 64, near the almost 11-month low of minus 64.9 reached
last week.  Retail Sales  U.S.  retail sales  dropped 0.5 percent in June, following a
0.2 percent decrease in May, Commerce Department figures showed
today. The decline was worse than the most-pessimistic forecast
in a Bloomberg News survey in which the median projection called
for 0.2 percent rise.  The IMF cut its 2013 global growth forecast as  Europe ’s
debt crisis prolongs Spain’s recession and slows expansions in
 emerging markets . Growth worldwide will be 3.9 percent next
year, less than the 4.1 percent estimate in April, the fund
predicted in an update of its World Economic Outlook.  Manufacturing in the New York region expanded in July at a
faster pace than anticipated, signaling factories will keep
contributing to growth. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s
general economic index rose to 7.4 from 2.3 in June. The median
forecast of 51 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called for
an increase to 4.0. Readings greater than zero signal expansion
in the so-called Empire State Index that covers New York,
northern  New Jersey  and southern  Connecticut .  Earnings Season  Earnings beat estimates at 21 of the 32 companies in the
S&P 500 that have reported quarterly results so far, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Profits probably decreased 2.1
percent in the second quarter, the first drop in almost three
years, according to a Bloomberg survey of analysts.  JPMorgan Chase, the largest  U.S. bank  by assets, fell 2.7
percent to $35.09 after rallying 6 percent on July 13 as Chief
Executive Officer  Jamie Dimon  predicted the company will still
post record earnings this year despite a $4.4 billion trading
loss in the second quarter.  The bank’s assertion that traders at its London chief
investment office may have intentionally mismarked trades,
masking losses that total at least $5.8 billion, makes little
sense, according to former executives with direct knowledge of
the unit’s operation.  Home Depot, the nation’s largest home-improvement retailer,
slumped 1.2 percent to $51.45. Caterpillar, the world’s biggest
maker of construction equipment, declined 1.1 percent to $81.15.  General Electric Co. lost 0.9 percent to $19.59, helping
send industrial shares down 0.6 percent as a group for the
biggest drop among 10 industries in the S&P 500. Morgan Stanley
reduced its recommendation on the world’s biggest maker of  jet
engines , power generation equipment and locomotives to
equalweight from overweight, citing the stock’s higher valuation
relative to peers with or without GE Capital Corp.  Coal Stocks  Alpha Natural Resources Inc. (ANR)  declined 10 percent to $6.85
as Bank of Montreal cut its rating to underperform from
outperform, citing potential financing issues.  Arch Coal Inc. (ACI) ,
the fourth-largest U.S. producer of the fuel, sank 3.9 percent
to $5.90 after BMO cut the stock to underperform from market
perform.  Energy stocks added 0.3 percent after earlier falling as
much as 0.8 percent as the price of crude oil reversed earlier
declines to rise 1.5 percent to $88.43 a barrel. Chevron Corp.,
the second-largest U.S. energy company, climbed 0.7 percent to
$106.78. Denbury Resources Inc., the oil and natural-gas
producer, rallied 3.8 percent to $14.77.  MasterCard advanced 1.7 percent to $436.89 and Visa rose
2.5 percent to $127.15 after they agreed to settle a price-
fixing case brought by retailers over credit-card swipe fees.  Citigroup, Gannett  Citigroup Inc. (C) , the third-biggest U.S. bank, advanced 0.6
percent to $26.81 after reporting second-quarter profit that
beat analysts’ estimates on revenue from advising on mergers and
underwriting stocks and bonds.  Net income declined to $2.95 billion, or 95 cents a share,
from $3.34 billion, or $1.09, a year earlier. Excluding
accounting adjustments and a loss from the sale of a stake in a
Turkish bank, earnings were $1 a share, compared with the
average estimate of 89 cents in a Bloomberg survey of 18
analysts.  Gannett Co., the owner of 82 daily newspapers including  USA
Today , rallied 2.7 percent to $14.69. The company reported
second-quarter profit that topped analysts’ estimates, bolstered
by growing Internet revenue. Excluding some items, profit was 56
cents a share in the period, beating the 53-cent average
estimate by analysts, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
