Soybean growers in  Brazil , the
world’s second-largest producer, had sold 96 percent of the
current crop as of July 13, compared with 76 percent a year
earlier, researcher Celeres said in an e-mailed report today.  Corn growers in the country harvested 26 percent of the
mid-season crop, being harvest now that it’s winter in the
Southern Hemisphere, Celeres said in a separate report. That
compares with 21 percent a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
