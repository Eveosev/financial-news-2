China may make it easier for foreign
investors to pay a lower withholding tax on dividends they
repatriate,  KPMG  LLP said.  Under the new rules, any foreign investor publicly traded
in a country that has a  tax treaty  with China, such as  Hong Kong 
or the U.K., automatically qualifies for a 5 percent rate,
rather than 10 percent, and no longer has to go through an
assessment process, Abe Zhao, a Beijing-based international tax
partner at KPMG, said in a phone interview today.  While the rules have yet to be released by the  State
Administration of Taxation , they have been posted on some local
government websites, he said.  Savings from the rule could reach “hundreds of millions of
dollars,” Zhao said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
