Raytheon Co. (RTN)  won a $59.2 million
case against the U.S. seeking to recover pension deficits for
government contract work after the company sold off four units
as part of a restructuring plan that began 12 years ago.  Raytheon’s award, issued in a June 27 ruling that was
unsealed today, was $10 million less than it sought. A judge
heard 11 days of testimony in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims
in Washington last fall that was followed by closing arguments
in February.  “The end goal pursued by both the government and the
contractor is to settle up and pay their fair shares to ensure
that the pension plans at issue are fully funded to meet the
promises made to the employee-participants covered by the
pension plans,” U.S. Claims Judge Nancy Firestone wrote in her
149-page ruling.  Raytheon sued the U.S. in 2005 after a contracting officer
denied Raytheon’s claims for payment on the grounds that the
company hadn’t paid the pension deficits it sought to recover
from the government for the employees that remained within
Raytheon’s pension plans, according to the ruling.  Jon Kasle, a spokesman for Waltham, Massachusetts-based
Raytheon, declined to comment on the award. Mitchell Rivard, a
Justice Department spokesman, didn’t respond to an e-mail
message seeking comment on the award.  The case is U.S. v. Raytheon Co., 05-cv-00448, U.S. Court
of Federal Claims ( Washington ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
