Leap Wireless International Inc. (LEAP) 
shares declined the most in more than a month after the company
said it’s terminating the employment of Chief Operating Officer
Raymond Roman.  Roman will step down as operating chief immediately and his
employment will cease on July 31, the San Diego-based company
said today in a filing.  Leap’s stock fell 3.9 percent to $6.25 at the close in New
York, the biggest decline since June 1. The shares have fallen
33 percent this year.  Leap, a pay-as-you-go wireless-service provider, has seen
sales growth stall as it struggles to keep up with the major
carriers. The company is counting on Apple Inc.’s iPhone, which
it began offering last month, to help attract more customers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
