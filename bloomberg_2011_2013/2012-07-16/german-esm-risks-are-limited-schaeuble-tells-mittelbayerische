Germany ’s financial risks from
participation in the European Stability Mechanism are limited to
190 billion euros ($232 billion), Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said in an interview with  Mittelbayerische Zeitung .  Reports of an agreement on shared liability for banks in
the European Union at a euro region leaders’ meeting on June 29
are untrue, the newspaper cited Schaeuble as saying on its
Internet site.  Schaeuble told the newspaper he’s “confident” that
Germany’s highest court will reject legal motions to stop the
ESM, the euro region’s future financial backstop.  To contact the reporter on this story:
