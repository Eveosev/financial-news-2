Banco do Brasil SA ,  Latin America ’s
largest bank by assets, replaced Allan Simoes Toledo as head of
private banking, wholesale and international businesses.  Paulo Rogerio Caffarelli succeeded Toledo temporarily
starting yesterday and also will remain head of retail services,
Marco Tulio Bretas de Vasconcelos, communications manager at the
bank, said today in a telephone interview. The Brasilia-based
lender didn’t say why it replaced Toledo, who may remain an
employee, according to Vasconcelos.  Toledo, 44, started at Banco do Brasil in 1982 and helped
the firm expand abroad. The bank bought a 51 percent stake in
Buenos Aires-based Banco Patagonia SA for 1.86 billion pesos
($432 million) in April 2010. In January, the bank agreed to
purchase Florida-based EuroBank for $6 million. Toledo said in
June that Banco do Brasil was considering buying rivals in
Colombia, Chile and  Peru .  Banco do Brasil fell 1.2 percent to 23.76 reais in  Sao
Paulo  at 12:30 p.m., compared with a 0.9 percent decline for the
benchmark Bovespa index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
