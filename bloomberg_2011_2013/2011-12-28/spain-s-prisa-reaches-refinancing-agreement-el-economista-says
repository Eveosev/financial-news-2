Promotora de Informaciones SA (PRS) 
reached a refinancing agreement with more than 35 creditor banks
after months of talks,  El Economista  reported, without saying
where it got the information.  The Spanish company, known as Prisa, obtained extensions of
the maturity dates of two syndicated loans, of which it still
has to repay 2.9 billion euros ($3.8 billion), to March 19,
2014, and Jan. 15, 2015, the newspaper said.  Final approval still depends on the agreement of U.K.
banks, El Economista said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
