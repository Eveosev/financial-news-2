One in every five German hospitals
is unprofitable,  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  reported, citing
a survey by the Deutsches Krankenhausinstitut, or German
Hospital Institute.  The majority of clinics have improved their finances this
year from last year, according to the report. Most German
hospitals expect the situation to stay the same or deteriorate
next year, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
