Japan ’s Fair Trade Commission said
it has cleared  Western Digital Corp. (WDC) ’s application to purchase
 Hitachi Ltd. (6501) ’s hard disk drive unit after the U.S. company
agreed to sell off some other disk drive assets.  Western Digital has agreed to sell about 10 percent of its
units producing 3.5-inch hard disk drives for personal computers
and consumer electronics, the commission said in a statement
today.  On Dec. 5, the Japanese company said it expects the sale to
be completed by March. The cost of the purchase was reported on
March 7 this year as $4.3 billion in cash and stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
