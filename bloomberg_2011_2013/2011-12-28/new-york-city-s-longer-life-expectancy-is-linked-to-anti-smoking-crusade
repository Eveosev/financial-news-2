New York  City  heart-disease  deaths
have dropped 28 percent since 2002, a decrease the Health
Department attributes to bans on public smoking, cigarette taxes
and  ads  depicting tobacco-related illnesses.  The statistics were contained in a report Mayor  Michael Bloomberg  released yesterday giving babies born in New York a
record life expectancy of 80.6 years, three years more than in
2000 and above the national rate of 78.2 years. The report also
showed AIDS fatalities have dropped faster than any other cause
of death in the city.  “If you want to live longer and healthier than the average
American, come to New York City,” Bloomberg said as he released
the report. “By investing in health care and continuing to
encourage more  New Yorkers  to take charge of their own health,
we’ve experienced dramatic improvements in life expectancy.”  In September, the Health Department  said  the city’s adult
smoking rate had reached a record low, with only 14 of 100 New
Yorkers still smoking, a 35 percent decrease since 2002. Health
officials said the decline would prevent 50,000 premature deaths
in the next 40 years.  Dan Seidman, director of smoking-cessation services at
 Columbia University ’s behavioral-medicine program, said the
city’s campaign has had a big impact on reducing heart disease.  “It’s really impressive, since that’s been the big killer
in middle age and old age,” Seidman said in an interview.  Americans 65 and older now account for the largest
percentage of the population, according to the  U.S. Census
Bureau . From 2000 to 2010, the number of people 65 and older
grew 15.1 percent while the total population increased 9.7
percent, the bureau said.  Anti-Smoking Policies  The Health Department analyzed data from death certificates
to conclude that preventive measures and medical care
contributed to the increase in  life expectancy . Smoke-free air
policies in city parks and laws against smoking in all
workplaces -- including bars and restaurants -- cut smoking
rates among women to 12.2 percent in 2010 from 19.8 percent in
2002, the department reported.  Officials also attributed reduced smoking to a 4.3 percent
decrease in the cancer-death rate since 2002, to 162.9 deaths
per 100,000 people from 170.2 in 2010.  The anti-smoking campaign has also been bolstered with
improved care and access to medication for people with high
 blood pressure , high cholesterol or heart disease, the
department said in a statement.  Improvement Within Hours  “It’s hard to break out the extent to which cardiovascular
deaths have decreased from government actions or improved
medical care and diet and exercise,” said Susan Kansagra,
assistant commissioner for the Health Department’s Bureau of
Tobacco Control. “But heart disease and high blood pressure
improve within hours or days after someone stops smoking.”  City health officials expect that of 450,000 smokers who
have quit in the past 10 years, 150,000 will avoid smoking-
related deaths, she said. Declines in cancer rates from smoking
cessation take decades to show up statistically, she said.  Bloomberg, 69, the billionaire founder and majority owner
of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP, has spent hundreds of
millions of dollars of his own money on  public health 
initiatives, including a United Nations-sponsored international
anti-smoking campaign. His donations to  Johns Hopkins University 
in Baltimore, where he studied as an undergraduate, endowed the
 Bloomberg School of Public Health .  HIV Deaths  Among the improvements cited in yesterday’s report was an
11.3 percent decrease in HIV deaths since 2009, and a 52 percent
decline since 2002. The report attributed the drop to the Health
Department’s cooperation with clinics and community
organizations in conducting more than 600,000 HIV tests in three
years.  Since 2005, city hospitals have diagnosed 10,700 HIV-
positive individuals and linked them with medical care, the
report stated.  In fiscal 2011, city facilities tested 195,516 patients,
more than three times the number six years earlier, and
“preliminary data suggests that fewer than 3,500 new cases of
HIV were diagnosed in  New York City  for 2010, a more than a 30
percent decrease from 2002,” the Health Department said.  In 2010, the city’s infant-mortality rate fell to a
historic low of 4.9 deaths per 1,000 live births -- the lowest
since 1898, when the five boroughs were combined to form the
modern city of New York.  Heart disease, cancer and influenza/pneumonia continue to
rank as the top three causes of death, followed by  lung disease 
and diabetes, and 30 percent of all deaths in New York City
occur before age 65, with more than 15,000 New Yorkers dying
prematurely, the department reported.  New Yorkers are also less likely to die by homicide than
they were a few decades ago. The number of murders this year
will total “slightly more than” 500, the third fewest since
record-keeping began five decades ago, Bloomberg said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
