Former Brazilian central bank
president  Henrique Meirelles  plans to return to the private
sector next year in an investment project that will be announced
in January.  “The idea is to contribute to the country’s expansion,
investing and bringing national and foreign investments to some
important areas in Brazil,” Meirelles, 66, said today in an
interview at the Bloomberg office in  Sao Paulo . “We’re studying
several projects and may have the cooperation of some
international groups.”  He declined to provide details on the project.  Meirelles, a former BankBoston Corp. executive, was
Brazil’s longest serving central bank president, heading the
authority from 2003 through the end of 2010, during the
government of President  Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva . Under
Meirelles, annual  inflation  fell to 5.91 percent in 2010 from
12.5 in 2002 and the country’s benchmark lending rate dropped to
an all time low of 8.75 percent, in 2009.  Meirelles said  Brazil  will grow at a rate “close to
potential” in 2012 as domestic demand expands at a fast pace
and the country still have room for monetary and fiscal stimulus
if needed to face a worse global outlook. He declined to comment
on Brazil’s current monetary policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
