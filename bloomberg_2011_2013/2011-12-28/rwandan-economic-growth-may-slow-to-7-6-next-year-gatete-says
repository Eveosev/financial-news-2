Rwandan economic growth may slow to
7.6 percent next year from an estimated 8.8 percent this year,
Central Bank Governor Claver Gatete said.  Inflation in the East African nation is expected to remain
below 7.5 percent, Gatete said in a phone interview on Dec. 26
from Kigali, the capital. Annual consumer-price growth is
expected to be about 8 percent next month compared with 7.4
percent in November, he said.  Rwanda ’s central bank last month raised its benchmark
 interest rate  by half a percentage point, the second increase in
as many months, to fight accelerating inflation. Price-growth
has been stoked by higher food and fuel costs.  Rwanda’s economy, still recovering from the 1994 genocide
that left about a million ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus
slaughtered in 100 days, doubled in the nine years before 2010,
according to the World Bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
