Turkish lira, the worst-performing
currency this year, weakened as local companies drove demand for
the dollar even as the central bank sold three times the $50
million target it announced two days ago for daily auctions.  The currency depreciated 0.1 percent to 1.9017 per dollar
as of 4 p.m. in Istanbul, falling for the second time in two
days. The lira has weakened 19 percent this year, making it the
worst-performing among more than 20 emerging-market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg.  Turkey ’s central bank said it plans to sell $50 million a
day in its daily dollar auctions unless there are
“exceptional” circumstances. The plan, effective yesterday,
will continue until the next monetary policy committee meeting
in January. The bank sold $150 million today versus bids for
$263 million.  “The lira is today performing worse than other  emerging
markets  and we are seeing dollar buying from a local
corporation,” Burcin Metin, chief currency trader at ING Bank
AS in Istanbul, said today.  Yields  on the two-year benchmark debt declined seven basis
points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 10.73 percent, a Royal Bank
of Scotland index of the securities showed, the biggest fall in
a week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
