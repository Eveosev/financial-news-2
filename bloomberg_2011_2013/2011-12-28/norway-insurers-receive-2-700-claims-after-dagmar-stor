Norwegian insurance companies have
received 2,700 claims following storm Dagmar that swept in over
 Norway  over the Christmas holiday and thousands more are
expected, a trade group for insurers said.  Claims have reached 162 million kroner ($27 million) and
are expected to exceed the 275 million kroner paid out after
storm Berit, Tonje Westby, a spokeswoman for Finance Norway,
which manages tracking damage from natural disasters, said in a
 statement  yesterday. Storm-related claims will probably exceed 1
billion kroner this year, the most since 1995, she said.  “Currently we have no overview of the damage,” Westby
said. “It’ll take time before all building damages can be
inspected and assessed. It’s therefore impossible to estimate
the total amount of damages at this point.”  Dagmar lashed the Nordic countries with Hurricane-strength
winds, cutting power, damaging buildings, shutting roads and
halting trains. Norway’s grid operator Statnett AS said late
yesterday that about 15,000 homes were still without power.  The highest average wind measured in Norway on Dec. 26 was
44.6 meters per second (100 miles per hour), with gusts reaching
64.7 meters per second, Norway’s Meteorological Institute said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
