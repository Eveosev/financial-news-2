Canadian natural gas rose as
forecasters predicted cooler weather for the U.S. Northeast,
which would boost furnace use in the second-biggest consuming
region for the nation’s gas output.  Alberta  gas rose 0.6 percent. New York’s temperature will
top out at 27 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 3 Celsius) Jan. 4, 12
degrees below normal, according to AccuWeather Inc. Demand for
heat in the city will exceed normal by 48 percent that day,
according to Weather Derivatives, helping offset higher output
and inventories.  “Average onshore gas production has been running 5 billion
to 6 billion cubic feet a day higher than year-ago levels,”
said Stephen Smith, an analyst and president of Stephen Smith
Energy Associates in Natchez,  Mississippi . “This represents the
sustainable downward pressure on gas.”  Alberta gas for January delivery rose 1.5 cents to C$2.695
a gigajoule ($2.50 per million British thermal units) at 4:10
p.m.  New York  time on  NGX , a Canadian Internet market.  Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada 
and the U.S. and priced on TransCanada Corp.’s Alberta system.
NGX Alberta gas has fallen 28 percent this year.  Gas for January delivery fell 2.8 cents, or 0.9 percent, to
settle at $3.084 per million Btu on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . U.S. stockpiles of the fuel probably dropped 86
billion cubic feet last week, the median of 11 analyst estimates
compiled by  Bloomberg . The five-year average drop is 122
billion.  Spot Prices  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near Chicago
declined 4.2 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $3.1667 per million Btu
on the  Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance, an express line, can
carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day to the Midwest from western
Canada.  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas gained 6.76 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $3.0709,
according to ICE. At Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded
for California markets, gas was down 0.8 cent to $3.1998.  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.2 billion cubic
feet, 672 million below its target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 3 billion cubic feet at
Empress, Alberta. The fuel is transferred to TransCanada’s main
line at Empress.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 2.11 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 800 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.85 billion cubic feet today, about 70 percent of its
capacity of 2.65 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.87
billion cubic feet at 3:05 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
