Thailand ’s baht dropped to its
weakest level since August 2010 after global investors reduced
holdings of the nation’s assets on concern  Southeast Asia ’s
second-biggest economy is slowing.  The currency has declined 5 percent this year, its biggest
annual loss since 2005, as exchange data show that international
investors sold $195 million more local shares than they bought
through yesterday. Official data showed last week that Thai
exports shrank 12.4 percent in November from a year earlier, the
first contraction since 2009, as the worst floods in 70 years
disrupted manufacturing.  “There is a clear lack of investor interest in the
currency,” said  Nizam Idris , a currency strategist at Macquarie
Group Ltd. in  Singapore . Still, “the reconstruction and a
recovery next year could see the baht doing better than most
other regional currencies.”  The baht weakened 0.4 percent to 31.56 per dollar in
Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency
touched 31.61, the weakest level since August 2010.  The cabinet rejected a proposal to change the way the
central bank sets inflation targets, Finance Minister Thirachai
Phuvanatnaranubala said yesterday. The central bank, which uses
core price pressures to guide monetary policy, had planned to
switch to monitoring headline inflation.  The yield on the government’s 3.25 percent bonds due June
2017 was little changed at 3.13 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The one-year onshore interest-rate swap, the fixed cost
needed to receive a floating payment, fell four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 2.87 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
