Asian  stocks (MXAP)  fell for a second day
amid slow trading, with the regional benchmark index headed for
its biggest annual decline since 2008, after U.S. housing prices
fell, damping the earnings outlook for Asia’s exporters.  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s No. 1 exporter of consumer electronics,
dropped 2.4 percent. SK Telecom Co. paced declines among South
Korean companies that went ex-dividend today. China Mengniu
Dairy Co. plunged 24 percent after saying moldy feed given to
cows led to excessive levels of a toxin in its milk.  Tokyo
Electric Power Co. (9501)  fell to the lowest level in at least 37 years
after Japan’s trade minister said the utility should consider
temporary government control.  The MSCI  Asia  Pacific Index slipped 0.6 percent to 113 as
of 7:41 p.m. in Tokyo, with all but one of the gauge’s 10
industry groups falling. For the month, the index is heading for
a 0.5 percent decline. The measure has dropped 18 percent this
year, the most since 2008.  “The U.S. housing market has yet to get on a firm recovery
path because we don’t know if prices will actually come back,”
said Naoteru Teraoka, general manager at Tokyo-based Chuo Mitsui
Asset Management Co., which oversees about $29.6 billion.
“Market participants are in vacation mode and aren’t doing
much.”  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  climbed 0.2
percent today. The gauge was little changed yesterday in  New
York  as better-than-estimated U.S.  consumer confidence 
overshadowed a decline in  home prices  and concern about Europe’s
debt crisis.  ‘No Incentive’  Japan ’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 0.2 percent after a
report showed factory output fell 2.6 percent in November as
Thailand’s floods disrupted supply chains at manufacturers such
as Sony and Honda Motor Co. Trading volume on the Nikkei was 43
percent below the 100-day average.  “There’s no incentive for investors to move their
positions at the end of year,” said Hisakazu Amano, who helps
oversee the equivalent of $29 billion at Tokyo-based T&D Asset
Management Co. “The bottleneck is U.S. housing data. Corporate
earnings are recovering and consumer confidence was good.”  South Korea’s Kospi Index lost 0.9 percent. Yesterday was
the last day to buy shares and still get a year-end dividend in
15 percent of the companies included in the 785-member gauge.  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 lost 1.3 percent, while  Hong Kong ’s
Hang Seng Index slid 0.6 percent. Markets in Australia and Hong
Kong reopened today after a four-day weekend.  Exporters dropped after the S&P/Case-Shiller index of
property values in 20 U.S. cities dropped 3.4 percent in the
year ended October after decreasing 3.5 percent in the year
ended September, the New York-based group said yesterday.  Sony fell 2.4 percent to 1,354 yen, and  Canon Inc. (7751) , the
world’s biggest camera maker, slid 1.6 percent to 3,415 yen.  Going Ex-dividend  SK Telecom led declines among firms that have the highest
dividend yields among South Korea’s 50 largest publicly traded
companies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. SK Telecom
retreated 6.3 percent to 141,500 won. Rival  KT Corp. (030200)  slipped 4.8
percent to 35,850 won.  Korea Exchange Bank (004940)  fell 5.1 percent to
7,450 won.  China Mengniu Dairy plunged 24 percent to HK$20.00, the
biggest loss since September 2008. In a random inspection, the
level of a toxin in a batch of the firm’s milk was more than
double the nation’s permitted level, an unidentified official at
the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection
and Quarantine said in an interview with the Xinhua News Agency.  Tokyo  Electric Plunges  Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 12.6 times
estimated earnings on average, compared with 12.8 times for the
S&P 500 and 10.5 times for the Stoxx 600. Utilities have lost 27
percent this year, the worst among the 10 industry groups on the
Asian benchmark gauge, as Japanese power generators tumbled
after a nuclear crisis at Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s Fukushima
Dai-Ichi plant.  Tepco, as the utility is known, slumped 12 percent to 186
yen today, the lowest since at least September 1974. The company
needs to consider all options related to its survival, including
the government taking temporary control of the utility, trade
minister Yukio Edano told company president Toshio Nishizawa
yesterday.  Tepco has lost 91 percent this year, the biggest drop in
the  MSCI All Country World Index , which includes both emerging
and developed world markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
