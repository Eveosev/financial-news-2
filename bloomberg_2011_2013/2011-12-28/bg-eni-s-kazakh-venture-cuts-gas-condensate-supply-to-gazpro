A Kazakh venture led by  BG Group Plc (BG/) 
and  Eni SpA (ENI)  cut unstable gas condensate supplies to a Russian
plant run by  OAO Gazprom  after opening its own processing
facilities, Oil Minister Sauat Mynbayev said.  “The reason is the start of the new processing complex at
KPO, not any disagreements,” Mynbayev told reporters today in
Astana, the Kazakh capital, referring to the Karachaganak
Petroleum Operating BV venture, which is developing  Kazakhstan ’s
second-largest producing field.  Negotiations between Gazprom and KPO are in progress,
Mynbayev said, declining to comment on when a supply agreement
for Gazprom’s Orenburg plant may be reached. Karachaganak “will
need additional facilities, so some gas condensate may be
supplied to the Russian plant.”  The Orenburg plant, which handles 8 billion cubic meters of
gas a year from Karachaganak, may have to shut for lack of a key
feedstock that it gets from unstable gas condensate, Reuters
reported earlier today, citing unidentified people in the
industry.  BG Group and Eni each hold 32.5 percent of the Karachaganak
venture, Chevron Corp. has 20 percent and OAO Lukoil 15 percent.
The Kazakh government agreed with the partners this month for
state-owned KazMunaiGaz National Co. to acquire 10 percent in
Karachaganak.  To contact the reporter on this story:
