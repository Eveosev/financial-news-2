The  Green Bay Packers  are selling an
extra 30,000 shares in the team because demand for an ownership
stake in the defending Super Bowl champions remains strong
heading into the National Football League playoffs.  The Packers sold almost 250,000 shares in the first three
weeks of their fifth stock package, according to an e-mailed
release. The only publicly owned franchise in the major U.S.
sports, the Packers are 14-1 this season and have clinched a
first-round bye in the upcoming playoffs with a week remaining
in the regular season.  Shares can be purchased for $250 over the phone or online
at  PackersOwner.com . The stock doesn’t pay dividends or
appreciate in value and can’t be sold. The Packers are raising
money for a $143 million renovation of  Lambeau Field  that will
add two new gates, roughly 6,700 seats and a new video board.  “The support from our fans has been outstanding and we
appreciate their enthusiasm,” Packers President  Mark Murphy 
said in yesterday’s statement. “We continue to receive interest
in the offering, and this increase in the number of available
shares will help ensure that we are able to accommodate all
those who want to become shareholders.”  The team sold 1,600 shares in the first 11 minutes of the
sale on Dec. 6, and more than 185,000 shares, or $46.3 million,
in the first two days. Should the team sell all 280,000 shares,
it would bring in $70 million.  The sale will run until Feb. 29, unless all of the shares
are sold out before then, according to the release.  Shareholders get a vote for the team’s board of directors
and can attend stockholders’ meetings every summer in  Green Bay ,
 Wisconsin , with exclusive access to events such as rookie
practices and stadium tours. They also have a special store with
apparel such as “I Own A Piece of the Pack” T-shirts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
