King Juan Carlos received a stipend
of 140,519 euros ($183,000) before income tax from the Spanish
state in 2011, less than Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy 
earned as an opposition leader last year.  Spain ’s king received an additional 152,233 euros to cover
expenses related to his duties as monarch, the  royal press
office  said today on its website. It’s the first time in more
than 30 years that the royal family has provided details about
its annual allowance, which was 8.4 million euros in 2011.  Rajoy made 227,000 euros as head of the People’s Party and
member of parliament last year, according to parliamentary
filings released on Sept. 8 under a new transparency law.
Spain’s premier had a tax bill of 87,652 euros for his
investment income and rental income from four homes he owns.  Rajoy also earned more than former Prime Minister  Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero , whose Socialist party was beaten in a
national election on Nov. 20. Zapatero took home 67,400 euros in
2010, after tax, according to the filings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
