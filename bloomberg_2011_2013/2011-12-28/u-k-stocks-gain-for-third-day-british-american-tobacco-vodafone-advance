U.K. stocks  were little changed as a
surge in Boxing Day retail sales offset concern that the euro-
area debt crisis will harm the economic recovery.  Tesco Plc, the U.K.’s largest supermarket chain, climbed
2.3 percent and  Debenhams Plc (DEB)  rallied 1.5 percent as more people
went shopping on the day after Christmas.  ITV Plc (ITV) , Britain’s
biggest commercial broadcaster, advanced 1.6 percent.
Evraz Plc led mining companies lower as an earthquake
temporarily halted operations in Siberia.  The benchmark  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  declined 5.3, or 0.1 percent,
to 5,507.4 at the close in London, bringing this year’s decline
to 6.7 percent. The FTSE All-Share Index was also little changed
today, while Ireland’s ISEQ slid 0.5 percent, snapping a seven-
day rally.  Investors “seem quite some distance away from turning
optimistic given the difficult economic conditions already cast
within the first quarter of 2012,” said  Andrew Wilkinson , the
chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak & Co. in  New York .  The FTSE 100 has retreated in 2011 as the debt crisis
spread across  Europe , with Spanish and Italian borrowing costs
reaching euro-era records. The gauge rallied 11 percent from
this year’s lowest level on Oct. 4 amid better-than-estimated
U.S. economic data and speculation that European leaders are
moving to stem the crisis. Trading in London was closed over the
past two days for Christmas.  ECB Balance Sheet  Stocks pared gains today as the  European Central Bank  said
its balance sheet soared to a record after it lent financial
institutions more money last week in an attempt to keep credit
flowing to the economy during the debt crisis.  Lending to euro-area banks jumped by 214 billion euros
($280 billion) to 879 billion euros in the week ended Dec. 23,
the Frankfurt-based ECB said. Its balance sheet increased 239
billion euros to 2.73 trillion euros.  Italy sold 9 billion euros of six-month bills at an average
yield of 3.251 percent today, compared with a 14-year-high of
6.504 percent at an auction of similar-maturity debt on Nov. 25.
The Treasury also sold 1.7 billion euros of zero-coupon notes
due 2013 at 4.853 percent.  The government will auction as much as 8.5 billion euros of
debt due in 2014, 2018, 2021 and 2022 tomorrow.  Britain faces the “toughest” job market in two decades
with the number of working people likely to fall by 120,000 in
2012, the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development said.  Weaker Jobs Market  “The U.K. jobs market will be weaker than at any time
since the recession of the early 1990s,” John Philpott, chief
economic adviser at the CIPD, an association for human-resource
professionals, said in a statement. “The combination of
worsening job shortages for people without work, mounting job
insecurity and a further fall in real earnings for those in work
may test the resilience and resolve of the U.K. workforce far
more than it did in the recession of 2008-9.”  Tesco rose 2.3 percent to 399.8 pence and Debenhams, the
U.K.’s second-largest department-store owner, advanced 1.5
percent to 57.45 pence. U.K. shopper numbers for Dec. 26 jumped
22 percent from a year earlier, market research company Experian
FootFall reported yesterday.  ITV increased 1.6 percent to 65.5 pence, the highest level
in six weeks.  British American Tobacco Plc (BATS) , Europe’s largest cigarette
maker, climbed 2 percent to 3,057.5 pence, a record high.  Gambling Companies Gain  Bwin.Party Digital Entertainment Plc  surged 23 percent to
160 pence, the biggest gain since April. Exane BNP Paribas SA
analysts reiterated an “outperform” rating on the gambling
company, saying there is likely to be an improvement in the
regulatory framework in  Germany  and potential upside from a U.S.
legal opinion on online gambling.  William Hill Plc (WMH) , a U.K. bookmaker with about 2,350 betting
shops, advanced 3.2 percent to 194.7 pence.  Playtech Ltd. (PTEC) , a
developer of software for gaming companies, climbed 15 percent
to 266 pence.  Evraz sank 4.9 percent to 373.3 pence, the biggest drop
this month. The Russian steelmaker part-owned by billionaire
 Roman Abramovich  temporarily halted underground mining in
Siberia halted after a 6.7 magnitude earthquake in a nearby
region late yesterday.  Rio Tinto Group, the world’s second-largest mining company,
slid 2.1 percent to 3,091 pence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
