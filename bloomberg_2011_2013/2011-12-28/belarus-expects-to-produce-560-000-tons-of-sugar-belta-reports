Belarus expects to  produce  at least
560,000 metric tons of sweetener from this year’s  sugar-beet 
harvest, news agency Belta reported, citing the Belarusian State
Food Concern Belgospisheprom.  This will be the most sweetener produced from sugar beet in
recent years, Belta cited Valentin Komandirov, head of
Belgospisheprom’s development of sugar and confectionery
industry department, as saying.  About 507,000 tons of sugar has been produced to date, a 26
percent increase compared with the same period last year,
according to the report. Exports are down 78 percent at 380,000
tons, Belta reported, citing Komandirov.  To contact the reporter on this story:
