Money managers added to net-long

week ended Dec. 20 from the prior week’s 277, a report published
on the exchange’s website today showed. The chocolate ingredient
fell 5 percent in the latest week. A long position is a bet on
higher prices, while a short position is a wager on a decline.  Net-short positions in robusta coffee futures increased to
8,534 contracts from 5,493 a week earlier. The beans, used in
instant coffee and espresso, slid 2.7 percent in the period.  Net-long positions in white, or refined, sugar fell to 619
