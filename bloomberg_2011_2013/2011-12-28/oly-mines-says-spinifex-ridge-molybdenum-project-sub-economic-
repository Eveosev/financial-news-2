Moly Mines Ltd. (MOL)  doesn’t expect to
continue its Spinifex Ridge molybdenum and copper project in
 Western Australia  because of low metals prices.  Weak global molybdenum prices and a strong Australian
currency have rendered the project “sub-economic”, the Perth-
based company said in a statement today.  “It is disappointing that the economics do not allow us to
proceed with the Spinifex Ridge molybdenum/copper mine at this
stage,” Chief Executive Officer  Derek Fisher  said in the
statement.  China Development Bank Corp. agreed to provide a $454
million loan to help finance the project, Moly Mines said in
June. The loan facility expires in May and Moly Mines doesn’t
believe the project’s financial situation will improve before
then. The companies have formed a strategic alliance under which
 China Development Bank  may finance new Moly Mines projects.  The Chinese bank has asked Moly Mines to make a $210
million drawdown, which will be repaid within one week, reducing
the facility to $244 million, according to today’s statement.  Moly fell more than 10 percent to C$0.30 at 12:24 p.m in
Toronto.  To contact the reporter on this story:
