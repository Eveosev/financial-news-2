About 8,000 Chinese workers in LG
Display Co.’s factory in eastern Nanjing city went on strike
this week over pay, QQ.com and Sina.com reported today.  Workers are unhappy with a cut in year-end bonuses and
plans by the company to pay larger bonuses to Korean employees,
according to QQ.com, citing two unidentified workers. Bonuses
were reduced to one month’s pay from last year’s three month’s.  LG Display has started negotiating with the workers,
Sina.com said, citing an unidentified company official.  Claire Ohm, a spokeswoman at LG Display, declined to
comment. The Nanjing government press department didn’t return
calls.  QQ.com is a news website run by  Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700)   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
