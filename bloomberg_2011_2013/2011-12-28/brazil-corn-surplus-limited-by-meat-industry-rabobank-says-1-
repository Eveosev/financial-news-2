Corn stockpiles in  Brazil  will be
limited as livestock feeders increase use of the grain, Rabobank
International said.  The country’s expanding meat industry may limit corn
inventories through 2015, when inventories may be as low as 2
million metric tons, the bank said in a report today. Prices
will need to average about $6.35 a bushel at ports near
Paranagua to spur corn production, Rabobank said. Animal feeders
will use 16 percent more corn compared with this year, it said.  “Despite Brazil’s reputation as an agricultural
powerhouse, large land-area availability and vast farmer know-
how, an ongoing fast-paced development of its meat industry may
hinder” gains in corn stockpiles, according to the report,
written by Guilherme Melo and Renato Rasmussen. “Strong
incentives must be in place for Brazilian farmers to boost corn
production.”  Corn futures on the Chicago Board of Trade have gained 2.6
percent this year, making it the best-performing grain in 2011.  Poultry production will rise 3 percent annually in the next
five years as demand increases, according to the report. Pork
output will gain 2 percent annually and the number of cattle in
feedlots will rise by about 5 percent a year for the next five
years, Rabobank said. Demand for corn from dairy cows will rise
6 percent annually, the analysts said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
