Poland wants state-controlled energy
companies to join forces in the search for shale gas, with the
aim of starting extraction early in 2015 at the latest,  Parkiet 
reported, citing an interview with Treasury Minister Mikolaj Budzanowski.  Budzanowski said  PGE SA (PGE) , the country’s No. 1 power company,
 Tauron Polska Energia SA (TPE) , the second-biggest,  Enea SA (ENA) , the
third-largest, and Energa SA should form a “national alliance”
and play an active part in exploration, as they can use gas for
energy generation, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
