Italian two-year notes rose for a
third day and Spanish securities rallied on speculation the
 European Central Bank ’s provision of three-year loans is
boosting demand for the two nations’ debt.  Five-year Italian notes gained for the first time in five
days as borrowing costs declined and demand increased at a sale
of six-month bills. The nation plans to auction as much as 8.5
billion euros ($11 billion) of debt tomorrow. German and Dutch
two-year  yields  fell to records and overnight  deposits  with the
ECB climbed to an all-time high after the central bank lent
financial institutions 489 billion euros at a tender on Dec. 21.  “There’s a switch thanks to the ECB three-year tender,
which is helpful” for shorter-maturity debt in nations such as
Italy and  Spain , said  David Schnautz , a fixed-income strategist
at Commerzbank AG in London. “The next stop is tomorrow’s bond
auction and today’s result is a good omen for that.”  Italy’s two-year yield fell nine basis points, or 0.09
percentage point, to 4.98 percent at 4:39 p.m. London time. The
2.25 percent note due in November 2013 rose 0.165, or 1.65 euros
per 1,000-euro face amount, to 95.375. The five-year yield slid
11 basis points to 6.23 percent. The 10-year  yield  was little
changed at 7 percent.  Spanish two-year  rates  dropped 32 basis points to 3.31
percent. Ten-year yields fell 18 basis points to 5.15 percent.  Volatility on Spanish debt was the third highest among 24
nations tracked by Bloomberg, according to measures of 10-year
bonds, two- and 10-year yield spreads and credit-default swaps.  Italian Sale  The Italian Treasury sold 9 billion euros of 179-day bills
at a rate of 3.251 percent, down from 6.504 percent at the
previous auction on Nov. 25. Demand was 1.7 times the amount on
offer, compared with 1.5 times last month. The nation also sold
zero-coupon notes due in September 2013 at a yield of 4.85
percent, versus 7.81 percent in November.  The auctions were  Italy ’s first since the ECB’s three-year
tender, which central bank President  Mario Draghi  announced on
Dec. 8 in an effort to keep credit flowing to the 17-nation euro
economy while lawmakers tackle the sovereign debt crisis.  The loans were provided at the ECB’s benchmark rate, which
the central bank lowered to 1 percent at its Dec. 8 meeting.
They helped spur gains for Italian securities, which have
returned 4.6 percent this month, according to indexes compiled
by the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies and
Bloomberg. They still declined 6.1 percent this year.  Maturing Debt  Italy expects to raise almost 450 billion euros from debt
sales next year, enough to cover 202 billion euros of maturing
bonds and finance a 23.6 billion-euro deficit, Maria Cannata,
director of public debt, said in a Dec. 24 interview with
newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore.  The nation is scheduled to sell securities due in 2014,
2018, 2021 and 2022 tomorrow.  German two-year yields were little changed at 0.17 percent
after falling to a record 0.142 percent, the least since
Bloomberg began collecting the data in 1990. One-year  rates  were
at minus 0.05 percent. Ten-year yields declined three basis
points to 1.89 percent.  Two-year Dutch yields fell to as low as 0.194 percent.  Euro-area banks deposited 452 billion euros with the
Frankfurt-based ECB yesterday, the most since the common
currency’s introduction in 1999 and up from the previous record
of 412 billion euros a day earlier.  “There’s a flight to cash products” after the ECB tender,
said  Peter Chatwell , a fixed-income strategist at Credit
Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in London. “It looks like
some of it is on deposit in the ECB and some has been put into
front-end core notes. It will be interesting to see if any of
this is put into Italy,” he said before today’s debt sale.  The ECB’s balance sheet increased 239 billion euros to 2.73
trillion euros in the week ended Dec. 23, the central bank said
today. That’s 553 billion euros more than three months ago.  German debt has returned 9.3 percent this year, according
to the Bloomberg/EFFAS indexes, the most since 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
