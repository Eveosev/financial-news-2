The Yemeni parliament endorsed a
political program proposed by the country’s interim government
that aims to maintain stability after President Ali Abdullah Saleh agreed to give up power.  The measure passed today as Prime Minister Mohammed Salem Basindwah appealed to lawmakers from opposing factions to fight
corruption and join forces to assist in the transition, the
state-run Saba news agency reported.  The tasks ahead are “enormous and difficult to the extent
it is a salvage rather than a unity government,” Basindwah
said, speaking to parliament in the Yemeni capital of Sana’a.  Saleh agreed last month to surrender power amid anti-
government protests. Neighboring  Saudi Arabia  and other Gulf
cooperation Council states, with backing from the U.S., mediated
the agreement that sought to resolve months of unrest.  Tens of thousands of Yemenis rallied in Sana’a Dec. 26 to
demand Saleh’s prosecution after the outgoing president said he
plans to leave soon for the U.S. as the Arab country prepares
for a Feb. 21 election to replace him.  To contact the reporters on this story:
