Cheniere Energy Inc. (LNG) ’s proposal to
build a liquefaction facility to export natural gas from its
Sabine Pass terminal won’t significantly affect the environment,
staff of the  U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  said.  “Approval of the proposed project, with appropriate
mitigating measures, would not constitute a major federal action
significantly affecting the quality of the human environment,”
according to the  statement  issued today.  Cheniere built Sabine Pass as a gas-import terminal. It
received approval from the U.S. Energy Department to export
liquefied natural gas and is awaiting a final decision from the
commission for a project that would initially cost as much as $5
billion. Improved drilling techniques has made the U.S. the
world’s largest gas producer, creating the prospect of ship-
bound exports.  The export plant would cool gas to a liquid form so it can
be loaded onto tankers for shipment to markets inaccessible by
pipelines. The Louisiana project would be capable of exporting
about 16 million metric tons of LNG a year.  Cheniere has announced several 20-year gas-supply
contracts, including a pair of agreements for the project with
 BG Group Plc  and  Gas Natural SDG SA (GAS)  of  Spain .  Diane Haggard, a spokeswoman for Houston-based Cheniere,
wasn’t available for comment.  Cheniere climbed 4.6 percent to close at $8.90 in  New York .  The Sabine Pass terminal is set to be the first new North
American gas export project since 1969, when exports from the
Kenai terminal in  Alaska  started.  To contact the reporter on this story:
