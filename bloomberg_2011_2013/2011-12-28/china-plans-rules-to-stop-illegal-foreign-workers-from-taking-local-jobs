China  is reviewing amendments to its
immigration laws that would make it more difficult for foreign
workers to find jobs in the world’s second-biggest economy
without government approval.  A draft of the amendments would require foreign nationals
to obtain work permits, the official  Xinhua News Agency  reported.
Foreign nationals suspected of having entered the country
without authorization, of having overstayed visas or of working
illegally may be detained, repatriated and barred from returning
to China for five years, according to the Dec. 26 report.  China, being a nation with a large supply of labor, needs
to “strictly control” the entry of “ordinary” foreign
workers while it ushers in “high-end talent,” Xinhua reported,
without citing anyone. In a separate Dec. 26 report, Xinhua
cited Vice Minister of Public Security Yang Huanning as saying
that instances of foreigners entering, staying and working in
China illegally have been “prominent” in recent years.  Lawmakers conducted their first review of the amendments to
the laws governing entry by foreigners and departures Chinese
nationals on Dec. 26, according to Xinhua. It didn’t say when
the changes might be passed into law.  Foreigners that have made “outstanding” contributions to
China’s economic and social development can apply for permanent
residence rights, which requires approval by the public security
ministry, according to Xinhua.  --Zhang Dingmin. Editor:  John Liu   To contact the Bloomberg News staff for this story:
