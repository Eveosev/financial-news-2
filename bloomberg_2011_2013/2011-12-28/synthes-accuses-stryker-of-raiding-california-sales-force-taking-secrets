A unit of  Synthes Inc. (SYST) , the world’s
largest maker of bone-related medical devices, accused  Stryker
Corp. (SYK)  in a lawsuit of raiding its San Francisco sales force and
using confidential information from former employees.  Stryker seeks to obtain “an improper competitive
advantage” in the industry for medical implants and instruments
used in spinal surgery, Synthes USA Sales LLC said in the
complaint filed today in federal court in Philadelphia. Synthes
also accused three former sales employees of misappropriating
trade secrets and breaching their contractual and fiduciary
obligations to the company.  The former employees resigned from Synthes from August to
early October, according to the complaint. They immediately
began working for Stryker, one of the company’s direct
competitors, and are soliciting former customers, according to
the court filing.  Representatives of Kalamazoo, Michigan-based Stryker didn’t
immediately respond to an e-mail and phone message at the
company headquarters seeking comment on the lawsuit.  Johnson & Johnson agreed to buy Synthes, based in  West
Chester ,  Pennsylvania , in April for $21.3 billion to become the
leader in the $5.5 billion market for devices to treat trauma
victims.  The case is Synthes USA Sales LLC v. Stryker Corp., 11-
cv-07876, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania
(Philadelphia).  To contact the reporter on this story:
