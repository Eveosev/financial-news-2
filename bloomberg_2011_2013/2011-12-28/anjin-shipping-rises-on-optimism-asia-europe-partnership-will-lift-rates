Hanjin Shipping Co. (117930) , South Korea’s
largest shipping company, climbed to the highest level in three
months in Seoul trading on expectations cargo rates may rise
following a partnership on trade between Asia and Europe.  Hanjin Shipping advanced 8.9 percent to 11,650 won, the
highest closing price since Sept. 23.  STX Pan Ocean Co. (028670) , South
Korea’s largest commodities shipping company, rose 2.7 percent
to 6,060 won.  Five Asian lines including Hanjin Shipping and Evergreen
Line agreed yesterday to operate 12 weekly services to Europe
from the second quarter. The agreement follows two other
partnerships among rivals this month as overcapacity caused
cargo rates to drop as much as 62 percent on the unprofitable
route this year.  “Investors are betting that the recent cooperations
between major shipping lines will help lift rates,” said Um Kyung A, an analyst at Shinyoung Securities Co. in  Seoul . “It’s
going to be very difficult for those left out.”  China Cosco Holdings Co. (1919) , Yang Ming Line and Kawasaki Kisen
Kaisha Ltd. are the three other shipping lines in the latest
partnership.  Spot rates for hauling 20-foot cargo boxes to Europe from
Asia fell 62 percent this year to $536 last week, according to
the Shanghai Shipping Exchange. The break-even point on the
route is at least $700, according to Morgan Stanley.  U.S. consumer confidence rose to an eight-month high in
December, further fueling expectations that demand in the
world’s largest market may help lift cargo rates, Um said. The
Conference Board’s index increased to 64.5, the highest since
April.  Yang Ming Marine Transport (2609)  gained 6.6 percent to NT$12.05
in Taipei.  Evergreen Marine Corp. (2603) , part of Evergreen Line,
climbed 3.7 percent to NT$15.55.  To contact the reporter on this story:
