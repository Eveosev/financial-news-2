The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars dropped to the lowest level in a week against the yen as
concern increased that  Europe ’s debt crisis may deepen, damping
demand for higher-yielding assets.  The South Pacific currencies tumbled as Italian bond yields
rose after the nation sold less than its maximum target at an
auction. Losses in the Aussie and kiwi were limited as U.S.
stocks rebounded after economic reports signaled the U.S.
recovery is quickening.  “The European problem is going to continue to cause spooks
in the market and some spikes in  risk aversion ,” said  Thomas Averill , managing director in Sydney at Rochford Capital, a
currency and interest-rate risk-management company. “The moves
are exaggerated by the lack of liquidity.”  The Australian dollar fell 0.2 percent to 78.53 yen at
11:44 a.m. in  New York . It earlier dropped as low as 78.18, the
weakest since Dec. 20. The Aussie touched $1.0044, also the
lowest since Dec. 20, before trading little changed at $1.0104.  New Zealand’s dollar slid 0.2 percent to 59.57 yen, the
lowest since Dec. 20, before trading at 59.85 yen, 0.1 percent
below yesterday’s close. The kiwi fetched 76.98 U.S. cents,
after dropping as low as 76.54 U.S. cents, the least since Dec.
21.  The  yield (GBTPGR10)  on benchmark Italian 10-year bonds traded above 7
percent, the level that forced  Greece , Portugal and Ireland to
seek bailouts, after the nation auctioned debt. The Treasury in
Rome sold 2.5 billion euros ($3.2 billion) of securities due in
2014, less than the 3 billion euro maximum for the sale.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.7 percent after an
index of pending U.S. home sales rose more than economists
forecast, while earlier reports showed stronger-than-projected
growth in business activity and a drop in jobless claims over
the past month to a three-year low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
