The cost of insuring against default
on European sovereign and corporate debt fell, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings decreased five
basis points to 749 at 11:30 a.m. in  London . A decline signals
improvement in perceptions of  credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings fell one basis point to 171 basis
points.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.1 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
