The  International Monetary Fund  has
yet to decide on returning to Hungary for formal aid talks as
the decision depends on the government engaging on key “policy
issues,” Reuters reported today, citing an IMF official.  “Preparatory work on a program cannot continue until the
government indicates it is willing to proceed on the basis of a
Stand-by Arrangement,”  Christoph Rosenberg , the Washington-
based lender’s mission chief to Hungary, wrote in answers to
questions from Reuters.  The IMF told the government in Budapest that given
Hungary’s vulnerabilities, a Stand-By Arrangement with agreed
conditionality would be best for the country, Rosenberg said,
according to Reuters.  The government needs to “engage on policy issues that are
relevant to macroeconomic stability,” Rosenberg wrote, adding
that  Hungary ’s proposed central bank legislation and financial
stability law need “close consultation,” Reuters said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
