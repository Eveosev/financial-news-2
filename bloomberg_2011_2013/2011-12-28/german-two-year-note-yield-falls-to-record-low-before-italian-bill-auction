German  government bonds  rose, with
the two-year note yield falling to a record, as Italy prepared
to auction as much as 11.5 billion euros ($15 billion) of debt.  One-year German  yields  were negative for a second day as
Asian stocks declined, boosting the allure of fixed-income
assets.  Greece  will hold national elections at the end of April,
state-run Athens News Agency reported, citing Finance Minister
Evangelos Venizelos. Italy plans to sell 9 billion euros of 179-
day bills today and as much as 2.5 billion euros of zero-coupon
notes due in 2013. The nation is scheduled to auction bonds
maturing between 2014 and 2022 tomorrow.  The yield on two-year German  notes  dropped one basis point
to 0.16 percent at 7:26 a.m. London time, after falling as low
as 0.142 percent, the least since Bloomberg began collecting the
data in 1990. The 0.25 percent security due December 2013 rose
0.02, or 20 euro cents per 1,000-euro face amount, to 100.18.  One-year rates were at minus 0.03 percent.  German government bonds have rallied this year as  Europe ’s
debt crisis threatened to spread to the region’s larger
economies, stoking demand for the safest investments. German
debt has returned 9.3 percent, the most since 2008, according to
indexes compiled by the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies and Bloomberg. Italian debt lost 6.1 percent,
and Greek securities dropped 63 percent, the indexes show.  The new date for Greek parliamentary elections provides the
government of Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  with more time to
complete a new financing agreement and a debt swap, the Athens
News Agency reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
