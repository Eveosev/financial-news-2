Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK) , the most
active U.S. oil and natural-gas driller, agreed to sell a
pipeline subsidiary to an affiliated partnership for $865
million.  Chesapeake Midstream Partners LP (CHKM)  will buy Appalachia
Midstream Services, owner of 47 percent of a 200-mile (320-
kilometer) gathering system in the Marcellus Shale formation,
according to a statement today. The system transports more than
1 billion cubic feet a day and has 15-year contracts with gas
producers.  Chesapeake Energy is the largest gas producer in the
Marcellus formation and holds the most acreage in the region,
according to Bloomberg Industries. The formation, stretching
from  Canada  to Kentucky, holds an estimated 84 trillion cubic
feet of gas in dense shale rock, according to the  U.S.
Geological Survey .  Chesapeake Midstream, based in  Oklahoma City , bought $500
million worth of pipelines in the Haynesville Shale in 2010 from
Chesapeake Energy, which raises its ownership stake in the
pipeline partnership to 46.1 percent from 42.3 with today’s
sale.  The partnership, “expects to pursue a substantial number
of asset dropdowns from Chesapeake in the years ahead,”
Chesapeake Midstream Chief Executive Officer J. Mike Stice said
in the statement.  The transaction is expected to close by Dec. 30. Tudor,
Pickering Holt & Co. acted as the financial adviser to the
conflicts committee of Chesapeake Midstream’s board and
Richards, Layton & Finger PA was its legal adviser.  To contact the reporter on this story:
