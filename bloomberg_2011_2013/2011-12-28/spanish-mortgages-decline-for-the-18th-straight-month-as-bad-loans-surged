Spanish residential mortgages 
decreased for an 18th month in October as banks reined in
lending amid a surge in borrowing costs and bad loans.  The number of  home loans  fell 43.6 percent from a year
earlier after a 42 percent drop in September, the Madrid-based
National Statistics Institute said in an e-mailed statement
today. Total capital lent on all mortgages fell 40.6 percent, it
said.  Spain is struggling to digest a glut of 700,000 unsold new
homes since the collapse of the building boom that has pushed
the  unemployment  rate to 23 percent. Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy , who holds his second cabinet meeting on Dec. 30, has
pledged to bring back tax rebates for mortgage holders and clean
up an estimated 176 billion euros ($230 billion) of soured
assets linked to real estate from the books of the countryâ€™s
banks.  Bad loans as a proportion of total loans by Spanish lenders
jumped to a 17-year high 7.42 percent in October, the Bank of
 Spain  said on Dec. 19.  The average price of Spanish houses and apartments declined
7.4 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, the
National Statistics Institute said on Dec. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
