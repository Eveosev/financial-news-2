Japanese  stocks  fell for a second
day, with the  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  headed for its biggest
annual decline since 2008, after U.S. housing prices and
Japanese factory output dropped.  Sony Corp., Japan’s No. 1 exporter of consumer electronics,
lost 2.4 percent.  Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501)  plunged 12 percent to
an all-time low after the trade minister said the utility should
consider temporary government control. J. Front Retailing Co.
gained 3.7 percent after more than doubling its profit forecast
on lower taxes.  Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 0.2 percent to 8,423.62 at
the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo. With two trading days left this year,
the Nikkei is set for an 18 percent annual drop. Volume on the
gauge was more than 40 percent below the 100-day average,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The broader Topix Index
slipped 0.4 percent to 721.45.  “There’s no incentive for investors to move their
positions at the end of year,” said Hisakazu Amano, who helps
oversee the equivalent of $29 billion at Tokyo-based T&D Asset
Management Co. “The bottleneck is U.S. housing data.”  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  fell 0.3 percent
today after the S&P/Case-Shiller  index , a gauge of property
values in 20 cities, dropped 3.4 percent in October from a year
earlier. The  median forecast  of economists in a Bloomberg News
survey projected a 3.2 percent decrease.  Tepco Plunges  Tokyo Electric dropped 12 percent to 186 yen, the lowest
since its listing in August 1951. The power producer also known
as Tepco needs to consider all options for survival, including
the government taking temporary control, Trade Minister  Yukio
Edano  told company President Toshio Nishizawa yesterday. The
utility at the heart of the nuclear disaster is headed for a 91
percent plunge this year, making it the worst performer on the
1,659-member Topix.  The Trade Ministry said today factory output fell 2.6
percent in November from the month before, when it rose 2.2
percent. The decline was three times larger than estimated by
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Production for exporters such as
Honda Motor Co. and Sony Corp. has been hurt by a strong yen,
slowing demand and Thai floods, hampering  Japan ’s recovery from
the March disaster.  Topix in 2012  The Topix has plunged 20 percent this year, sending the
value of shares to an average of 0.86 times estimated book value,
the lowest since March 2009 and half the value of  stocks (TPX)  on the
 S&P 500 . Analysts are projecting a 20 percent gain in 2012.  The natural disasters “are things that happen once every 80
years,” said David Herro, manager of the $7.1 billion
Oakmark International Fund, who in February called Japanese
shares a “steal.” About a quarter of the fund’s assets are
invested in Japan. “If you liked Japanese stocks last year at
120 percent of book, you should like them better at 90 percent
of book,” he said by phone on Dec. 22.  The following are among the most active shares in the
Japanese market today. Stock symbols are in parentheses after
company names.  Ex-Dividend: Yesterday was the last day of the year to buy
shares and still get a dividend in  117 companies  on the Topix.
Among them, brewer  Sapporo Holdings Ltd. (2501)  (2501 JT) slid 1.4
percent to 291 yen.  TonenGeneral Sekiyu K.K. (5012)  (5012 JT), a unit
of Exxon Mobil Corp., lost 1.6 percent to 839 yen.  J. Front Retailing Co. (3086 JT), an operator of department
stores and supermarkets, climbed 3.7 percent to 368 yen. The
retailer more than doubled its full-year net-income forecast to
17.6 billion yen ($224 million) from 7.6 billion yen, citing
lower corporate taxes.  J Trust Co. (8508 JO), rallied 7.1 percent to 500 yen after
the Nikkei newspaper reported bankrupt consumer lender  Takefuji
Corp. (8564)  (8564 JP) may pick the financial-services company as an
investor for its restructuring. TPG Capital (8818Z US) was also
named as a candidate.  Nitto Boseki Co. (3110 JT), a maker of building materials,
sank 5 percent to 267 yen after slashing its full-year net-
income forecast 42 percent to 1.4 billion yen. The company plans
to reverse some of its deferred tax assets after passage of a
new tax law.  -- With assistance from Masaaki Iwamoto in  Tokyo .
