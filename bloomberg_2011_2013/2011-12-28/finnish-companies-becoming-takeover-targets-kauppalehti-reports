Finnish companies are shifting to
specialization and niche markets to survive tough times, and
that makes them takeover targets for global corporations,
 Kauppalehti  reported today.  Narrowing focus jeopardizes growth and makes it hard for
managers to broaden their professional skills, the Helsinki-
based newspaper said, citing a survey of managers at 31 listed
companies in  Finland .  As a result, Finnish companies including  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) ,  Kemira
Oyj (KRA1V)  and Waertsilae Oyj have looked for executives abroad,
Kauppalehti said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
