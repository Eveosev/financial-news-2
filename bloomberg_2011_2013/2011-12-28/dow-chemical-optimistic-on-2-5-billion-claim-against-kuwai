Dow Chemical Co. (DOW)  is “optimistic”
that an arbitration panel will rule favorably on its claim that
 Kuwait  owes at least $2.5 billion for breaching a 2008 agreement
to buy a stake in the company’s plastics business.  The arbitration tribunal of the  International Chamber of
Commerce  in  London  is expected to rule on claims against
Kuwait’s Petrochemicals Industries Co. “very soon,” Rebecca Bentley, a spokeswoman for Midland, Michigan-based Dow, said in
an e-mail today.  “Nothing has diminished our position that PIC was required
to close, and that PIC owes substantial damages to Dow,”
Bentley said. “We remain very optimistic about the reward.”  Maha Mulla Hussein, PIC chairwoman and managing director,
declined to comment by telephone today.  Dow is seeking $2.5 billion plus damages, more than the
company’s net income last year, because PIC, under pressure from
lawmakers, canceled a contract to form a 50-50 venture with
Dow’s plastics assets. Failure of the so-called K-Dow venture
deprived Dow of $9 billion during the financial crisis and
nearly derailed its 2009 purchase of Rohm & Haas Co.  Dow Chief Executive Officer  Andrew Liveris  said in April
that the parties had submitted their evidence and that he
expected a ruling by year end.  “It’s very clear that we were wronged and the contracts
are very clear,” Liveris said in an April 28 conference call.  To contact the reporter on this story:
