ThyssenKrupp AG  plans to compensate
 Deutsche Bahn AG  for the price-fixing of rails from the
mid-1990s to help win the national rail operator back as a
customer, Handelsblatt  reported , citing unidentified people
within the industry.  The first new supply contracts have already been agreed
between the two companies, Handelsblatt said, citing the same
people.  Compensation to  Deutsche Bahn , private rail buyers and a
fine will end up costing ThyssenKrupp a total of more than 100
million euros ($130 million), Handelsblatt said.  A ThyssenKrupp spokesman confirmed that the two companies
are in talks, without giving any further details, Handelsblatt
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
