Liverpool striker  Luis Suarez  was
suspended one game by the Football Association for his gesture
toward Fulham fans at a Dec. 5 match between the Premier League
teams.  Suarez was also fined 20,000 pounds ($31,000) after
admitting to making the gesture as he left the field at Craven
Cottage following Liverpool’s 1-0 loss, English soccer’s F.A.
said in a  statement  today.  Suarez last week received an eight-match ban for racially
abusing Manchester United’s Patrice Evra during an Oct. 15
match. The Uruguayan had denied the allegation.  The F.A. also fined Liverpool 20,000 pounds for failing to
control its players during the Fulham match. Team members
remonstrated with the referee after midfielder Jay Spearing was
red-carded for a challenge on Moussa Dembele.  To contact the reporter on this story:
