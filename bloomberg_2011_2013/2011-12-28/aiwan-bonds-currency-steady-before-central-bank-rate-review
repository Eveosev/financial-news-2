Taiwan ’s government bonds and
currency were little changed before the central bank reviews
borrowing costs tomorrow.  The monetary authority will leave its  benchmark rate 
unchanged at 1.875 percent, according to 11 of 15 economists in
a Bloomberg survey. Four predict a cut to 1.750 percent.  “Market participants are all waiting for the rate
decision,” said Tarsicio Tong, a trader at Union Bank of Taiwan
in Taipei. “Currency trades recently are mostly driven by
exporters and importers.”  The yield on the 1.25 percent notes maturing in September
2021, the most-traded  government securities , was little changed
at 1.27 percent, according to prices from Gretai Securities
Market. Benchmark 10-year rates have dropped 28 basis points, or
0.28 percentage point, this year.  Taiwan’s dollar was little changed at NT$30.310 against its
U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It has advanced
0.2 percent in 2011. “There won’t be too much movement in the
currency” until the island’s presidential elections are held on
Jan. 14, Tong said.  The  overnight money-market rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, was steady at 0.4 percent, according to a
weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
