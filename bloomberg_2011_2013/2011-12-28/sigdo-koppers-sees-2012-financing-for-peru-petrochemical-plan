Sigdo Koppers SA  aims to secure bank
financing by the end of next year for an $800 million ammonium
plant in  Peru  as part of the country’s goal of becoming South
America’s largest petrochemicals producer after Brazil.  Sigdo Koppers, based in Santiago, and its local partner
Brescia Group will award by June a construction and procurement
contract for the ammonium nitrate project called  Nitratos del
Peru , said Geir Skarstein, who heads Sigdo Koppers’ Peruvian
unit. The partners last week signed a letter of intent with
Spain’s  Tecnicas Reunidas SA (TRE)  to undertake studies.  The project, which has retained  BNP Paribas (BNP)  as a financial
adviser, is part of $60 billion in planned mining and energy
investments over the next decade in Peru, including
petrochemical projects by  CF Industries Inc. (CF) ,  Orica Ltd. (ORI)  and
Braskem SA. Odebrecht SA and  SK Group  are also studying projects
to produce polyethylene, fertilizers and explosives for mining.  “It makes sense to have industries in clusters as this
produces synergies,” Skarstein said in an interview in Lima
today. “It will be good for the local mining industry to have a
secure source of supply and for the  trade balance , as we’ll have
the capacity to replace all ammonium nitrate imports.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
