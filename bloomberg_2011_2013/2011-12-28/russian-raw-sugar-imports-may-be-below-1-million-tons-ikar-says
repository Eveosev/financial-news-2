Russian imports of raw sugar may
fall below 1 million metric tons for the first time ever in 2012
because of surging domestic production, according to the
 Institute for Agricultural Market Studies .  Sugar output may reach almost 5.1 million tons in the
current season running through July following a record beet
harvest of 50.5 million tons, Moscow-based Ikar, as the
institute is known, said in an e-mailed statement today. Inbound
shipments of raw sugar came to 2.2 million tons this year, it
said. Local production from domestic beets reached 4.6 million
tons as of Dec. 26, according to the Sugar Producers’ Union.  Still, crop losses may restrain output, Ikar said. Farmers
failed to harvest about 9 percent of this year’s beet crop
because of adverse weather, and at least 12 percent of the roots
that were gathered will be lost while in storage, it said.  Russia exported 180,000 tons of sugar made from domestic
beets as of today, First Deputy Prime Minister  Viktor Zubkov 
said in an interview with government newspaper  Rossiyskaya
Gazeta . He said in October the country might become a net
exporter this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
