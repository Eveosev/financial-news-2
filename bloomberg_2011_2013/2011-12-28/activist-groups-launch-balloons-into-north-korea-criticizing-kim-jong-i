South Korean civic groups and
defectors from the North said they launched balloons today that
will float across the border to deliver leaflets containing
criticism of the late  Kim Jong Il  and his son and successor, Kim Jong Un.  Forty activists set off 10 balloons that also carried
dollar bills, said Jang Se Yul, head of the North Korea People’s
Liberation Front, a Seoul-based group of former North Korean
soldiers and officers who defected to the South.  The regime in Pyongyang, which today bids farewell to Kim
Jong Il with a state funeral, has previously characterized such
acts as provocations that could ignite a war.  “North Koreans are being forced to participate in memorial
services for a criminal,” said Jang, who spoke by telephone from
Imjingak, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of Seoul. “We
want them to hear our call to rise up against Kim Jong Un and
end the generational dictatorship.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
