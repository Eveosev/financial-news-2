The Canadian dollar fell as stocks
dropped after the  European Central Bank ’s balance sheet soared
to a record on lending to the region’s banks, adding to concern
fiscal turmoil will slow growth.  The currency declined after earlier strengthening to the
highest level in almost three weeks as crude oil,  Canada ’s
biggest export, trading above $100 a barrel indicated a brighter
outlook for commodity-linked assets.  “There’s U.S. dollar buying across the board,” said
 Fabian Eliasson , head of U.S. currency sales at Mizuho Financial
Group Inc. in  New York , citing “further euro woes” and the
size of the ECB balance sheet. “We’re still at the mercy of
European Union news.”  The Canadian currency, nicknamed the loonie for the image
of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, dropped 0.6 percent to
C$1.0244 per  U.S. dollar  at 5 p.m. Toronto time. It touched
C$1.0126, the strongest since Dec. 8. One Canadian dollar buys
97.62 U.S. cents.  Lending to euro-area banks jumped 214 billion euros ($280
billion) to 879 billion euros in the week ended Dec. 23, the
Frankfurt-based ECB said in a statement today. Its balance sheet
increased 239 billion euros to 2.73 trillion euros, it said.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index decreased 1.3 percent.
Futures on crude oil, Canada’s biggest export slipped 1.9
percent to $99.46 a barrel in New York.  Commodity Link  The loonie rose against the majority of its most-traded
counterparts.  “Even with the reversal, the Canadian dollar is doing
better than most Group of 10 currencies today,” said  Nick Bennenbroek , head of currency strategy at  Wells Fargo & Co . in
New York. “More stable economic and monetary-policy trends for
Canada are helping contribute to overall resilience in this
currency.”  The best performers during the past month among the 10
major currencies tracked by Bloomberg are commodity-linked. The
loonie is up 1.8 percent, compared with gains of 2 percent for
the Australian dollar and 2.1 percent for the  New Zealand
dollar .  The loonie rose earlier after Italian 10-year bonds gained
for the first time in five days as the nation’s borrowing costs
plunged at an auction of 9 billion euros ($11.8 billion) of
debt. The rate on 10-year Italian bonds fell as much as 22 basis
points to 6.78 percent. Similar-maturity Spanish yields dropped
24 basis points to 5.10 percent.  The Rome-based Treasury sold 179-day bills at a rate of
3.251 percent, down from 6.504 percent at the last auction on
Nov. 25. Demand was 1.7 times the amount offered, compared with
1.47 times last month.  Government Bonds   Canadian 10-year government bonds  yielded  1.96 percent
today, compared with 3.23 percent at the end of last year. The
yield touched 1.837 percent on Dec. 16, the lowest level in
Bloomberg data going back to 1989.  The bonds yielded four basis points more than equivalent-
maturity U.S. Treasuries, compared with 32 basis points more on
Sept. 5, the most this year, and 17 basis points less at the end
of last year.  Canada’s bond market is beating the rest of the world by
the most since at least 1997 as the nation’s unscathed credit
rating draws investors seeking safety from global debt turmoil.  The Bank of America Merrill Lynch Canada Broad Market
Index, with 1,192 bonds and a par value of C$1.16 trillion
($1.14 trillion), returned 9.56 percent this year through Dec.
23, led by longer-term debt of  Quebec  and Canadian Pacific
Railway Corp. That compares with 5.39 percent for the firm’s
Global Broad Market Index. The difference of 4.17 percentage
points is the most according to Merrill records dating to 1997.  To contact the reporter on this story:
