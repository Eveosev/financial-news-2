Gasoline futures fell the most in
two weeks on speculation that demand for the motor fuel won’t
improve as consumption has failed to keep pace with 2010 levels.  Futures declined for the first time in seven sessions as
consumption in the  four weeks  ended Dec. 16, measured by
deliveries to wholesalers, was 4.7 percent below a year earlier,
Energy Department data show. Retail gasoline use through Dec. 23
was down 1.6 percent from 2010, according to  MasterCard Inc. (MA) ’s
SpendingPulse report today.  “There’s continued decline in gasoline demand in a year-
on-year comparison,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil
Associates LLC in Houston.  Gasoline for January delivery fell 4.1 cents, or 1.5
percent, to $2.6478 a gallon at 2:13 p.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , after touching a low of $2.6388. Prices are
up 7.9 percent this year, after rising as much as 41 percent
through April 29.  Fuel use dropped below the year-earlier level for the 17th
consecutive time last week, slipping 1.6 percent, according to
the SpendingPulse report.  Demand may grow 0.2 percent next year after dropping 2.6
percent to a 10-year low in 2011, the department said in its
Short-Term Energy Outlook Dec. 6.  Gasoline also weakened after the  European Central Bank ’s
sheet soared to a record after increasing loans to keep credit
flowing during the region’s debt crisis. The dollar gained 1
percent against the euro at 2:16 p.m. in New York, weakening the
investment appeal of commodities.  Euro Weakness  “The market is reacting to the weakness in the euro,”
said  Phil Flynn , vice president of research at PFGBest in
 Chicago . “That balance report did shake us up a bit. And
there’s no expectation gasoline demand is going to be strong.”  The Energy Department is scheduled to report last week’s
inventories tomorrow. The report will probably show that
distillate stockpiles fell 650,000 barrels, the first decline in
four weeks, according to the median estimate of eight analysts
in a survey by Bloomberg News.  “We’ve got three months of winter ahead of us and people
are expecting another draw in inventories last week,” Lipow
said.  Supplies of gasoline decreased 1.2 million barrels,
according to the survey.  The industry-funded  American Petroleum Institute  is
scheduled to report last week’s inventories at 4:30 p.m. today
in  New York .  January-delivery heating oil declined 0.68 cent to $2.9017
a gallon. Prices are heading for a 14 percent gain in 2011.  Regular gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, rose 1.2
cents to $3.243 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA data.
Prices were 6.4 percent above a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
