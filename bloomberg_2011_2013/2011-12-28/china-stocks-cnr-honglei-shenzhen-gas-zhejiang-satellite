Shares of the following companies
had  unusual (SHSZ300)  moves in  China  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the close.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) , which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, rose 0.2 percent to 2,170.01. The
measure has lost 23 percent this year as the central bank raised
 interest rates  three times to cool inflation and exports to
 Europe  slowed because of the region’s debt crisis. The CSI 300
Index gained 0.1 percent to 2,307.93.  Natural gas suppliers:  Shaan Xi Provincial Natural Gas Co. (002267) 
(002267 CH) climbed 4 percent to 16.05 yuan, its biggest gain
since Aug. 25. Shenzhen Gas Corp. (601139 CH) gained 2.9 percent
to 11.40 yuan.  Investors speculated that the government is moving towards
market-oriented prices, which would boost earnings of suppliers.
Consumers in Guangdong’s cities will pay a limit of 2,740 yuan
per 1,000 cubic meters for gas, according to a statement from
the National Development and Reform Commission on its website
yesterday. Urban users in Guangxi will be charged as much as
2,570 yuan per 1,000 cubic meters, it said. The proposed
nationwide pricing scheme will be evaluated in the two
provinces, the NDRC said, without giving a timeframe for its
introduction.  Railcar makers:  China CNR Corp. (601299)  (601299 CH), the nation’s
second-biggest trainmaker, lost 1.4 percent to 4.18 yuan, its
lowest close since the stock began trading in December 2009.  CSR
Corp. (601766)  (601766 CH), the biggest, slid 1.2 percent to 4.28 yuan.
The railways ministry may buy 86 billion yuan ($13.6 billion) of
railcars from CSR and CNR next year, the China Economic Times
reported. The order was less than estimated, said Stanley Yan,
an analyst at Masterlink Securities Corp.  Zhejiang Honglei Copper Co.  (002647 CH), which makes copper
tubes, slid 7.8 percent from its offer price to 11.80 yuan on
its trading debut in Shenzhen.  Zhejiang Satellite Petrochemical Co.  (002648 CH) tumbled 11
percent from the offer price to 35.65 yuan on the first day of
trading in Shenzhen.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
