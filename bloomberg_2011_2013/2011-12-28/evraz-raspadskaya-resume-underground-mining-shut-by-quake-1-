Evraz Plc  and  OAO Raspadskaya (RASP) 
resumed underground mining in Siberia halted after a 6.7
magnitude earthquake in a nearby region late yesterday.  Evraz’s coal and iron ore mines began operations at 5 p.m.
local time, the press office said in an e-mailed statement.
Miners returned to work after the Emergency Ministry ruled the
area was safe, Galina Kovalchuk, a Raspadskaya spokeswoman, said
by the phone.  OAO Mechel  is now running all mines as normal after a
suspension, said Dmitriy Kuchumov, a spokesman for the company’s
mining division.  All underground mines in Kemerovo, Russia’s biggest coal-
producing province, were closed temporarily on the ministry’s
recommendation while officials inspected them for damage. The
ministry has since cleared them to open.  Suek ,  Russia ’s largest producer of coal for power stations,
said it suspended operations after Kemerovo Governor Aman Tuleyev ordered the safety check, as well as underground work in
the neighboring Khakassia region. Alexey Naumenko, a company
spokesman, wasn’t able to say if work had resumed.  Authorities evacuated some deposits in the Krasnoyarsk
region, said an official in the ministry’s local office who
declined to be identified because of government policy.  There were no reports of deaths or serious injuries after
the quake hit in the Tuva region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
