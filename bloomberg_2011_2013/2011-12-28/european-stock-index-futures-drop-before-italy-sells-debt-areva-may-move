European  stocks fell, snapping a
three-day rally, as declines in carmakers and mining companies
outweighed optimism that an easing in Italy’s borrowing costs
indicated the region’s debt crisis won’t deepen.  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) , the world’s biggest maker of
luxury cars, lost 3.3 percent.  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  and  Commerzbank
AG (CBK) , Germany’s biggest lenders, slid at least 3 percent.  Tesco
Plc (TSCO) , the U.K.’s largest supermarket chain, jumped 2.3 percent.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  dropped 0.7 percent to 240.20 at
the close in  London . The gauge rallied 2 percent in the previous
three sessions as investors turned attention from the debt
crisis to U.S. data that showed the recovery in the world’s
largest economy is gathering pace.  Stocks erased gains after a report said the  European (SXXP) 
Central Bank’s balance sheet soared to a record after it lent
financial institutions more money last week in an attempt to
keep credit flowing to the economy during the debt crisis.  “The euphoria from this morning was quickly replaced once
people realized that the ECB balance sheet was bigger than
expected which once again kind of sets a negative tone that the
crisis is maybe worse than expected,” Ken Polcari, a managing
director at ICAP Plc’s equities unit in  New York , said in a
Bloomberg TV interview.  Lending to euro-area banks jumped 214 billion euros ($280
billion) to 879 billion euros in the week ended Dec. 23, the
Frankfurt-based ECB said in a statement today. Its balance sheet
increased 239 billion euros to 2.73 trillion euros.  Italian Debt Auction  Italy  today sold 9 billion euros of six-month Treasury
bills at half the yield it agreed to pay at an auction of the
securities last month. The Rome-based Treasury sold the 179-day
bills at a rate of 3.251 percent, down from 6.504 percent on
Nov. 25. Demand was 1.7 times the amount for sale, compared with
1.47 times last month.  Italy also sold 1.733 billion euros of 2013 notes today to
yield 4.853 percent, compared with a yield of 7.814 percent at
the last auction on Nov. 25. The bid-to-cover ratio was 2.24,
compared with 1.59 last month. Tomorrow Italy will auction four
different securities, including a 10-year bond.  “Tomorrow is really the longer-term money that Italy has
to raise,” Polcari said. “Are they going to be lucky enough
tomorrow as they were today with the short-term money? I think
the market is telling you it’s a little bit concerned.”  U.K. Job Market  Britain faces the “toughest”  job market  in two decades
with the number of working people likely to fall by 120,000 in
2012, the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development said.  “The U.K. jobs market will be weaker than at any time
since the recession of the early 1990s,” John Philpott, chief
economic adviser at the CIPD, an association for human-resource
professionals, said in a statement. “The combination of
worsening job shortages for people without work, mounting job
insecurity and a further fall in real earnings for those in work
may test the resilience and resolve of the U.K. workforce far
more than it did in the recession of 2008-9.”  Greece  will hold national elections at the end of April,
state-run Athens News Agency reported, citing Finance Minister
Evangelos Venizelos. The new poll date provides the government
of Prime Minister Lucas Papademos more time to complete a new
financing agreement and a debt swap, the newswire reported.  National benchmark indexes declined in 13 of the 18 western
European markets today.  Germany ’s DAX fell 2 percent, while
 France ’s CAC 40 lost 1 percent. The Swiss Market Index added 0.1
percent.  BMW fell 3.3 percent to 51.10 euros and Porsche AG dropped
3.1 percent to 40.88 euros. Daimler AG slid 3.9 percent to 33.07
euros.  German Banks  Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank declined 3.8 percent to 28.63
euros and 4.2 percent to 1.27 euros respectively.  Xstrata lost 2.1 percent to 958.8 pence. Copper retreated
in London after a report that industrial production declined in
 Japan , curbing demand for base metals.  Petropavlovsk Plc (POG)  dropped
2.8 percent to 618 pence and  Salzgitter AG (SZG)  slid 2.6 percent to
37.90 euros.  Tesco gained 2.3 percent to 399.8 pence pacing gains among
European retailers.  Debenhams Plc (DEB)  added 1.5 percent to 57.5
pence, while  Home Retail Group Plc (HOME) , the owner of U.K. Homebase
outlets, rallied 4.8 percent to 86.8 pence.  U.K. shopper numbers for the Boxing Day of Dec. 26 rose 22
percent from a year earlier, market researcher Experian FootFall
reported yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
