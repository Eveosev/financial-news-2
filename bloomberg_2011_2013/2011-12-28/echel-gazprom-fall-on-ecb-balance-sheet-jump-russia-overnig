OAO Mechel (MTL)  and  OAO Gazprom (OGZPY)  fell in
New York on concern the surge in the  European Central Bank ’s
balance sheet shows a lack of capacity for new loans, dimming
the outlook for European growth and Russia’s commodity exports.  The  Bloomberg Russia-US 14 Index  of Russian companies
traded in the U.S. dropped for a second day, losing 1.5 percent
to 89.77, its lowest level since Dec. 19.  Futures  on the dollar-
denominated RTS index expiring in March slipped 0.6 percent to
135,420.  Mechel (MTLR) , Russia’s largest coal producer for steelmakers,
declined 3.5 percent after a 6.7 magnitude earthquake
temporarily halted operations at its Siberian mines.  The ECB’s balance sheet soared to a record 2.73 trillion
euros ($3.55 trillion) as it lent financial institutions 489
billion euros last week to prevent a credit shortage, the
Frankfurt-based bank said in a statement yesterday. Crude fell,
gold capped the longest slump in two years and the euro tumbled
to a 10-year low against the yen on speculation the ECB may be
running out of fire power to shield the region’s economies from
a recession.  Europe  is Russia’s largest trading partner.  “Investors had been thinking the ECB will print a lot of
money and we’d be off to the races, but this is them saying that
they can’t do it anymore,” Bruce Bower, a partner at Moscow-
based hedge fund Verno Capital, which manages more than $150
million in assets, said in an interview in  New York . “Russia
remains very dependent on the swings of foreign investors, and
tighter credit lowers capital inflows.”  Commodity Ties  Russia, where the economy grew 68 percent over the past
decade on the back of surging demand for commodity exports such
as oil, gas and nickel, has been hurt by falling metals prices
and slower expansion in  China . Investors pulled $326 million
from Russia this year and $5.3 billion from funds that invest in
all four of the so-called BRIC countries --  Brazil , Russia,
 India  and China, EPFR Global data show.  The  RTS Volatility Index , which measures expected swings in
the index futures, rose 9.2 percent to 41.69 points, the first
increase in 11 sessions. The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , a U.S.-
traded fund that holds Russian shares, fell for a third day,
losing 2 percent to $26.26. The  RTS Index  in Moscow retreated
1.2 percent to 1,382.19, and the 30-stock Micex Index slipped
0.2 percent to 1,383.09.  Mechel’s American depositary receipts dropped to $7.90, the
lowest since July 2009, after an earthquake forced underground
mining in Kemerovo, Russia’s biggest coal-producing province, to
be closed temporarily.  Shares  in Moscow dropped 2.7 percent to
256 rubles, or the equivalent of $8.05. One ADR represents one
ordinary share.  Gazprom Slumps  Gazprom, the world’s biggest natural gas exporter, fell 2.2
percent to $10.60 after  shares  in Moscow dropped 0.3 percent to
169.90 rubles, or the equivalent of $5.34. One ADR represents
two ordinary shares.  OAO Sberbank ,  Russia ’s largest lender, fell to its lowest
price in a month in New York, declining 2.4 percent to $9.96
after  shares  in Moscow dropped 0.9 percent to 79.27 rubles, or
the equivalent of $2.49. One ADR represents four ordinary
shares.  The  Standard & Poor’s GSCI index  of 24 raw materials fell
for the first time in seven days, dropping 1.2 percent to 645.44
as copper fell to a one-week low and nickel declined. Copper
futures for March delivery retreated 1.3 percent to close at
$3.3655 a pound on the Comex in New York. Nickel lost 0.2
percent to $18,475 a ton on the London Metal Exchange.  The euro fell 1 percent to $1.2937 to the dollar in New
York yesterday. Russia’s ruble weakened 1.1 percent to 31.7945
per dollar.  Energy Prices  Oil for February delivery declined from a six-week high as
concerns eased that  Iran  will block the  Strait of Hormuz , a
corridor linking the  Persian Gulf  with international ports. Oil
fell 2 percent to settle at $99.36 a barrel on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange .  Brent oil for January settlement dropped 1.6 percent to
$107.56 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange, and Urals crude, Russia’s chief export blend, lost 1.8
percent to $108.10.  The  Micex (INDEXCF)  has lost 18 percent in 2011 and trades at 4.6
times analysts’ earnings estimates for member companies. That
compares with an 18 percent slide for Brazil’s  Bovespa (IBOV)  index,
which trades at 10 times estimated earnings, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  trades at
10.5 times estimated earnings, and the  BSE India Sensitive Index (SENSEX) 
has a ratio of 13.7.  To contact the reporters on this story:
