Most U.S. Gulf oils strengthened or
were unchanged as West Texas Intermediate widened its discount
to Brent crude oil for the first time in eight trading days.  The spread between February-delivery futures for the U.S.
benchmark and Brent, the basis for European and West African
crudes, rose to $8.21 a barrel at 2:23 p.m. in  New York  from
$7.93 yesterday.  When Brent gains versus WTI, it increases the value of low-
sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil priced
against the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s  premium to WTI widened 10 cents to
$8.60 a barrel at 2:51 p.m. in New York, the first gain since
Dec. 15.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s  premium to WTI fell 20 cents to
$8.90.  Among the Gulf Coast sour, or high-sulfur, grades, Mars
Blend’s premium to WTI rose 15 cents to $5.15 a barrel, the
first increase in eight days.  Poseidon  increased 80 cents to
$4.90 over the U.S. benchmark.  Southern Green Canyon ’s premium
was unchanged at $4 a barrel.  Thunder Horse’s premium to WTI was unchanged at $6.50.  West
Texas Sour’s  discount narrowed 5 cents to $1.25 a barrel. Among
Canadian grades, Western Canada Select and Syncrude were
unchanged at $16.35 a barrel under WTI and $2.55 over,
respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
