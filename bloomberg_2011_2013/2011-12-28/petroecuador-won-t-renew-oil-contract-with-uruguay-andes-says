PetroEcuador, the South American
country’s state oil company, won’t renew a crude-for-fuel swap
accord with Uruguayan oil company Ancap, state news agency  Andes 
reported.  Ecuador  decided not to extend the deal after Uruguay
exported 80 percent of crude from Ecuador to the U.S. and  Panama 
instead of refining the oil at its La Teja refinery as
stipulated in the contract, the agency said, citing PetroEcuador
Chief Executive Officer Marco Calvopina.  During the two-year contract, Ecuador exported 24 million
barrels of crude to Uruguay and imported 16.5 million barrels of
refined fuels, Andes said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
