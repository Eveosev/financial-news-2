U.S. stocks declined, halting a
five-day advance in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, as the
European Central Bank’s balance sheet increased to a record
after a surge of bank lending to stem the region’s debt crisis.  Alcoa Inc. (AA)  and  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  dropped at least 1.8 percent
as the euro tumbled to the lowest level since January against
the U.S. dollar, curbing demand for commodities. The  Morgan
Stanley (MS)  Cyclical Index sank 1.9 percent as  Caterpillar (CAT)  Inc. and
 Ford Motor Co. (F)  slid more than 2.3 percent.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) 
slumped 3.6 percent, extending yesterday’s decline.  The S&P 500 retreated 1.3 percent to 1,249.64 at 4 p.m.  New
York  time. The benchmark gauge erased its 2011 gain and fell
below its average price of the past  200 days. (SPX)  The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  slid 139.94 points, or 1.1 percent, to
12,151.41 today. The Russell 2000 Index of small companies
dropped 2.1 percent. About 4.4 billion shares  changed hands  on
U.S. exchanges, or 42 percent below the three-month average.  “The economy is not benefiting from the ECB lending to
banks,”  Timothy Ghriskey , who oversees $2 billion as chief
investment officer of Solaris Group LLC in Bedford Hills, New
York, said in a telephone interview. “With Europe likely to
lapse into a recession, banks are reluctant to actually lend.”  Equities slumped as the ECB’s balance sheet soared to a
record 2.73 trillion euros ($3.55 trillion). The ECB last week
awarded 523 banks three-year loans totaling a record 489 billion
euros to encourage lending. So far, banks are parking the money
back at the ECB. Overnight deposits at the central bank
increased to an all-time high of 452 billion euros yesterday.  Strategists’ Forecast  With two more trading days left in 2011, the  S&P 500  would
need to rise 2.6 percent to reach the year-end forecast of Wall
Street strategists. Their mean estimate of 1,282 is lower than
the 1,371 predicted in January, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Today’s decline sent the S&P 500 down 0.6 percent for
the year. Still, a 10.5 percent rally since the end of September
put the gauge on pace for the best fourth-quarter since 2003.  Earlier today, stock-futures rose as Italy sold 9 billion
euros ($11.8 billion) of six-month Treasury bills and borrowing
costs fell from the previous auction. A bigger test of the ECB’s
lending on demand for European bonds comes tomorrow when Italy
sells as much as 8.5 billion euros of longer-maturity debt.  “I hope tomorrow’s auction will also be successful because
that could be a positive for the markets,” Brian Jacobsen, who
helps oversee about $209 billion as chief portfolio strategist
at Wells Fargo Advantage Funds in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin,
said in a telephone interview. “It’s going to be critical for
people to see whether or not there’s enough investor interest in
the Italian debt to stave off any further crisis.”  Economic Concern  Companies most dependent on the economy  led (SPXL1)  the losses in
the S&P 500 as concern grew that Europe’s crisis would hamper
global growth. The Dow Jones Transportation Average, a proxy for
the economy, erased 1.6 percent. Caterpillar, the world’s
largest construction and mining-equipment maker, dropped 2.4
percent to $89.37. Ford retreated 2.7 percent to $10.52.  Gauges of commodity shares had the biggest declines among
10 groups in the S&P 500, falling at least 1.8 percent. Metal
prices sank as gold futures retreated for a fifth day, the
longest slump since 2009. Oil declined for the first time in
seven days, in part because of reduced concern that Iran will
block the Strait of Hormuz.  Alcoa, the largest U.S. aluminum producer, retreated 3.1
percent to $8.52. Chevron fell 1.9 percent to $105.96. Freeport-
McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc., the world’s largest publicly traded
copper miner, dropped 4.1 percent to $36.31.  Banks Tumble  The  KBW Bank Index (BKX)  declined 1.8 percent as all of its 24
stocks fell. Bank of America lost 3.6 percent, the most in the
Dow, to $5.29.  Citigroup Inc. (C)  erased 2.9 percent to $26.13.  Molycorp Inc. (MCP)  slumped 14 percent, the biggest decline in
the Russell 1000 Index, to $24.04. The price estimate for the
owner of the largest rare-earth deposit outside China was cut to
$39 a share from $57 by JPMorgan Chase & Co., which cited
pressure on rare earth prices.  Mead Johnson Nutrition Co. (MJN)  lost 1.6 percent to $67.98. U.S.
regulators have spent today and yesterday inspecting a Mead
Johnson factory as part of an investigation into whether a
Missouri child’s death this month was due to tainted infant
formula. The leading maker of child formula had its biggest gain
in five months yesterday after announcing that its tests had
shown the batch of formula used by the infant was not
contaminated with the bacteria blamed for the death.  Traders pushed bearish options on Pharmasset Inc. to the
highest level in the Russell 1000 Index, locking in gains before
 Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD) ’s $10.8 billion offer for the drugmaker is
scheduled to close.  Implied Volatility  Implied volatility for 30-day puts to sell Pharmasset
shares are 60.41 points higher than the level for calls,
compared with the 18-month average of 8.12, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The price measurement known as  skew (VRUS)  is 10
times higher for Pharmasset than it is for the average Russell
1000 company, the data show.  Pharmasset shares closed at $123.02 last week, the lowest
price since Gilead bid for the Princeton, New Jersey-based
company in November to gain its experimental hepatitis C
treatment. MKM Partners LP and Tullett Prebon Plc say that while
there’s about a 90 percent chance the deal will succeed,
investors are buying options in case the transaction fails.  “The deal not closing is a low-probability event, but a
high-impact one,”  Walter Todd , who oversees $925 million
including Gilead shares as chief investment officer at Greenwood
Capital in Greenwood,  South Carolina , said yesterday in a phone
interview. “The downside if the deal falls apart is pretty
significant for Pharmasset. People want to pay up for
protection.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
