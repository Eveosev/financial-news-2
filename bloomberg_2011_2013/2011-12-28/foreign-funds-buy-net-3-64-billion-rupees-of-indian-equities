Overseas  investors  bought a net  3.64
billion rupees  ($68.8 million) of Indian stocks yesterday,
paring their withdrawals from the equities this year to 22.7
billion rupees, the nation’s market regulator said.  Foreigners bought 10.5 billion rupees of shares and sold
6.8 billion rupees, the Securities and Exchange Board of  India 
said  today . They bought a net 4.29 billion rupees of bonds,
taking total debt purchases this year to 419.8 billion rupees.  The  BSE India Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  has dropped 23 percent this
year, on concern a slowdown in the U.S. and  Europe ’s debt crisis
may erode company profits already threatened by the most
aggressive interest-rate increases among major Asian economies.  India’s $1 trillion stock market,  Asia ’s fourth-biggest, is
influenced by foreign fund flows. Inflows from abroad surged to
a record $29.4 billion in 2010, making the Sensex the best
performer among the world’s top 10 markets. The largest-ever
outflow in 2008 led to the biggest annual slump of 52 percent.  Foreign  funds  have placed 4.448 trillion rupees in stocks
and 1.207 trillion rupees in bonds since they were allowed into
the country in 1993.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
