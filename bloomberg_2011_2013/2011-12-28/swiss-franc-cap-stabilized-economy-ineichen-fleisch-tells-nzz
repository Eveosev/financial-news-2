The upper limit of 1.20 francs
against the euro, imposed by the Swiss central bank, has given
companies stability and a stable planning environment,  Marie- Gabrielle Ineichen-Fleisch, who heads the State Secretariat for
Economic Affairs, told  Neue Zuercher Zeitung  in an interview.  To return to normal, the economy would need an exchange
rate of 1.35 to 1.40 francs per euro, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
