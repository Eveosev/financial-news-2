Switzerland  lifted a ban on weapons
sales to Qatar after the Persian Gulf emirate apologized for
sending Swiss munitions to Libya,  Swissinfo.ch  reported, citing
an unidentified spokeswoman at the Swiss State Secretariat for
Economic Affairs.  The embargo was imposed in July amid reports that Qatar
delivered munitions made by the Swiss state-ownd company Ruag
Holding AG to Libyan rebels, Swissinfo.ch said. The delivery was
a “military logistics error,” Swissinfo.ch cited the
spokeswoman as saying.  A phone call to Ruag wasn’t answered; the company’s offices
were closed, according to a voice recording. An official at the
office of Qatar’s prime minister said she couldn’t immediately
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
