The naira appreciated the most in a
week against the dollar as a major  oil company  sold the U.S.
currency.  The currency of Africa’s biggest oil producer strengthened
as much as 1.7 percent, the biggest intraday gain since Dec. 20,
before paring its gain to 1.1 percent at 163.15 as of 1:42 p.m.
in Lagos, the capital.  “The appreciation at the inter-bank market was due to
dollar sales by a major oil company,” analysts at Lagos-based
Diamond Bank said in an e-mailed note today. “Dealers expect
the naira to gain further as dollar liquidity improves.”  The central bank on Nov. 21 lowered the midpoint of its
exchange-rate band at the auctions to 155 naira per dollar from
150 naira as rising imports and weakening oil prices increased
pressure on the currency. Sub-Saharan  Africa ’s second-biggest
economy depends on oil exports for more than 95 percent of
foreign income, according to the  Finance Ministry .  Nigeria closed its foreign-currency auctions for the year
on Dec. 21 and will reopen them in January, Muhammed Abdullahi,
a spokesman for the central bank in Abuja, said Dec. 21.  Ghana ’s cedi was unchanged at 1.6395 per dollar as of 1.20
p.m. in Accra, the nation’s capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
