Morocco extended a suspension of
 import duties  for soft and durum wheat through February because
of declining stockpiles, Reuters reported, citing an unnamed
customs authority spokesman.  The government in October suspended duties from Nov. 15
through the end of 2011 for soft-wheat imports and from Oct. 1
through Dec. 31 for durum shipments, according to the report.
Tariffs prior to the suspension were 135 percent for soft wheat
and 80 percent for durum, Reuters said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
