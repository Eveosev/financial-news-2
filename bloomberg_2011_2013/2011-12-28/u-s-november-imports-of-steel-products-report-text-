The data in this report are preliminary and subject to
revisions.  Analysis of recent months for steel product imports indicates
the value of preliminary data should equal about 96 percent of
the final value reported in the regular monthly trade statistics

categories and at the individual country of origin level have
been less consistently predictive of the final data reported in
the regular monthly trade statistics. For further details visit
