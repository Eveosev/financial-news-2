million tons in the same period a month earlier, the researcher
said in an e-mailed statement today.  Corn shipments accounted for 1.22 million tons and went to
 Egypt ,  Spain ,  Iran  and Israel. About 380,000 tons of wheat was
exported to Spain, Thailand and Israel. December exports also

765,000 tons of corn are expected to be shipped in the near
