Cocoa arrivals from Bahia,  Brazil ’s
biggest growing region, declined 11 percent from a week earlier,
according to analyst  Thomas Hartmann .  Deliveries to shippers and processors totaled 57,390 bags
in the week ended Dec. 25, Hartmann wrote in a report yesterday.
That compares with 64,839 bags he reported a week earlier. Total
arrivals across Brazil were 64,394 bags, compared with 75,159
bags a week ago, he said. A bag weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds).  Bahia has accounted for 74 percent of Brazil’s cocoa
production and 94 percent of its grindings in the past five
years, Hartmann said in an Oct. 12 e-mail. He’s a board member
of the Commercial Association of Bahia and heads the group’s
statistical service on Brazilian production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
