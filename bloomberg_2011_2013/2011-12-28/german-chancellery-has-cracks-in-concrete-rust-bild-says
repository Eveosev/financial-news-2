Angela Merkel ’s 10-year-old
chancellery in Berlin has cracks in its concrete, rusting metal
on its roof edges and moss disfiguring its facade,  Bild-Zeitung  
reported.  Cracked concrete in the building’s underground parking
garage will have to be repaired, while the rusting roof and moss
don’t pose any threat, the newspaper cited an unnamed German
government spokesman as saying.  Bild said the  chancellery , which was completed in 2001, has
been a “permanent construction site” with repairs to the
facade in 2007 and the replacement of glass in roof windows and
their insulation in 2008.  The design of the building, chosen by Chancellor Helmut Kohl who led  Germany  from 1982 to 1998, has earned it the
nicknames of the Elephant Toilet and the Washing Machine, Bild
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
