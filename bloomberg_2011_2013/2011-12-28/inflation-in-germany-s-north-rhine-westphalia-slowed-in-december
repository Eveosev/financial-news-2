Inflation in the German state of
North Rhine-Westphalia slowed in December as heating oil and
fuel costs declined.  Prices rose 1.7 percent from a year earlier compared with a
2.1 percent annual increase in November, the state’s statistics
office in Dusseldorf said in an e-mailed statement today. In the
month, prices rose 0.7 percent.  Economists forecast that German  inflation , calculated using
a harmonized European Union method, will slow to 2.4 percent
from 2.8 percent, the median of 18 estimates in a Bloomberg News
 survey  shows. The Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden will
release that report, based on data from six states, tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
