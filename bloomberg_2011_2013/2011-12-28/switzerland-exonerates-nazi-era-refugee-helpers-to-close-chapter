Switzerland  exonerated 137 people
convicted of smuggling refugees from  Nazi Germany  into the
country, ending seven years of historical research to redress
what it now considers a “serious injustice.”  Those involved had their convictions canceled and were
formally rehabilitated, the government’s Rehabilitation
Commission said today in an e-mailed  statement . The commission,
founded in 2004, will be wound up at the end of this year, it
said in the statement.  Switzerland responded to a growing stream of Jewish
refugees from  Germany  fleeing the Holocaust by imposing a visa
requirement for people described as “German non-Aryans” in
1938. A year later, all foreign nationals had to apply for visas
to enter the country. Most border crossings were closed at the
outbreak of World War II.  “The commission’s work brought to light an important part
of the history of our country,” it said in the statement.
That’s “important to those involved and their relatives.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
