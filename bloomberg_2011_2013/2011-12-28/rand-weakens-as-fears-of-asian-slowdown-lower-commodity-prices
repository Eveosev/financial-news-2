The rand strengthened for a fifth
day against the dollar after  Italy ’s borrowing costs fell at an
auction, easing concern Europe’s debt crisis may escalate and
boosting demand for riskier, emerging-market assets.  South Africa’s currency appreciated as much as 0.5 percent,
and traded 0.3 percent stronger at 8.1120 as of 3:20 p.m. in
Johannesburg. Against the euro, it advanced 0.4 percent to
10.6048.  Italy today sold 9 billion euros ($11.8 billion) of six-
month Treasury bills at half the yield it paid at an auction of
the securities last month. Demand was 1.7 times the amount
available for salee, compared with 1.47 times last month. The
euro pared its decline against the dollar and European stocks
advanced for a fourth day.  South Africa ’s  benchmark stock index 
gained for a third day.  “The Italian auction went OK, and all Europe’s debt yields
have fallen,”  John Cairns , a currency strategist at Rand
Merchant Bank in Johannesburg, said by phone. “The euro-dollar
is a bit higher, and that has pushed the dollar lower” against
other currencies including the rand, he added.  South Africa’s 13.5 percent bonds due 2015 gained, cutting
the yield six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 6.76
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
