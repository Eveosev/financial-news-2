Hungary ’s forint weakened, snapping
two days of gains against the euro, and  government bonds  fell as
investors sold riskier assets worldwide.  The forint slid 0.8 percent to 308.60 per euro by 4:33 p.m.
in Budapest, after strengthening 0.4 percent in the previous two
days. Today’s move extends this year’s losses to 9.7 percent.
Bonds slumped, lifting yields on benchmark 2017 notes 24 basis
points, or 0.24 percentage point, to 9.49 percent, a month high.  The euro weakened, stocks fell and Italian bonds trimmed
gains as a surge in the European Central Bank’s balance sheet to
a record 2.73 trillion euros ($3.54 trillion) highlighted
growing risks from the region’s debt crisis. Hungary is the
European Union’s most-indebted eastern member.  Mol Nyrt. (MOL) , the biggest oil company in Hungary, declined 1.8
percent to 17,585 forint, leading a 1.3 drop for the country’s
BUX equity index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
