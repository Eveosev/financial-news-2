Russian grain exports have reached
17.5 million metric tons to date since the season started on
July 1, First Deputy Prime Minister  Viktor Zubkov  said.  “Grain is delivered to 84 countries,” Zubkov said, on
government television channel Rossiya 24 today. Exports are seen
at about 24 million to 25 million tons this season, with 6
million to 7 million tons being shipped in the January through
June 2012 period, he said.  Russia  harvested 99 million tons of grain before drying and
cleaning it this year, and 93.8 million tons afterwards, the
 Agriculture Ministry  said in a statement today. The country had
record crops of sunflower seeds at 9.6 million tons, rapeseed at
1.1 million tons, soybeans at 1.6 million tons and sugar beets
at 46.2 million tons, according to the ministry.  Russia’s exports of sugar from domestic beets may reach
200,000 tons in 2011, Zubkov said.  The government plans to increase meat output by about a 10
percent next year and a 5 percent increase in milk production,
he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
