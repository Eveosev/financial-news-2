Crude oil inventories increased 9.57
million barrels last week, the  American Petroleum Institute 
said.  Distillate fuel inventories  gained 554,000 barrels, the
APIâ€™s weekly report showed.  Gasoline stockpiles  rose 1.86
million.  Inventories at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for
futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, slipped
292,000 barrels.  The Energy Department is scheduled to release its inventory
report at 11 a.m. tomorrow in  Washington , a day later than usual
because of the Christmas holiday.  The government report may show stockpiles of crude oil fell
2.5 million barrels last week, according to the median of 10
responses in a  Bloomberg News  survey. Gasoline inventories
probably dropped 500,000 barrels, the survey showed. Distillates
were expected to decrease 650,000.  API collects stockpile information on a voluntary basis
from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines. The
government requires that reports be filed with the Energy
Department for its weekly survey.  Crude oil for February delivery dropped $1.80, or 1.8
percent, to $99.54 at 4:31 p.m. in electronic trading on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange . The contract, which settled at $99.36,
traded at $99.70 before the report was released at 4:30 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
