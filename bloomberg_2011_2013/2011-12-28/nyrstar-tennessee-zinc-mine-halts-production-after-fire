Nyrstar (NYR) , the world’s largest
producer of refined zinc,  halted production at its Young mine
in Tennessee after an equipment fire.  All employees have been evacuated, the company said in an
e-mail today. Three miners who were trapped underground because
of smoke were rescued at about 4 p.m. local time, it said. The
mine employs 99 people, Renata Roberts, a spokeswoman said.  The company is working with the U.S. Mines Safety and
Health Administration to ensure all areas of the mine are safe
to resume operations, according to the statement.  Nyrstar bought the Young operation in December 2009. The
company’s other five mines in Tennessee are continuing regular
operations, Roberts said.  Nyrstar produced 63,000 tons of zinc in concentrate from
its  Tennessee  mines in 2010, according to the company’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
