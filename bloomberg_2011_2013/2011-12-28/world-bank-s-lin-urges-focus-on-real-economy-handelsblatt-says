World Bank Chief Economist Justin
Lin said industrialized economies are bound to lose their
current standard of living if they keep focusing on the
financial sector and neglect the real economy,  Handelsblatt 
reported, citing an interview.  “The world community has to look beyond the euro zone and
the sovereign debt crisis and grasp the opportunity for
structural transformation in the real-economy sectors of the
developing world,” the newspaper cited Lin as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
