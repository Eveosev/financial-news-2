Treasuries  climbed, pushing the 30-
year bond yield down the most in seven weeks, as investors
sought refuge on concern  Europe ’s fiscal turmoil will undermine
the global economic recovery.  U.S. government securities increased after the  European
Central Bank  said its balance sheet soared to a record following
last week’s lending to keep credit flowing during the region’s
debt crisis. They also rose before Italy sells as much as 8.5
billion euros ($11.1 billion) of notes tomorrow due from 2014 to
2022. Stocks dropped and the euro weakened to the lowest level
against the dollar in almost a year.  “There’s a certain amount of risk-off that’s going to stay
in the market as Europe goes through its gyrations,” said  Kevin Giddis , president of fixed-income  capital markets  at the
brokerage firm Morgan Keegan Inc. in  Memphis ,  Tennessee .
“Treasuries is the best outlet for the risk-off trade. There
are a lot of geopolitical issues out there.”  Yields on 30-year bonds tumbled 11 basis points, or 0.11
percentage point, to 2.92 percent at 5:01 p.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. It fell as much as 14
basis points, the biggest intraday drop since Nov. 9, to 2.90
percent. Yields rose earlier today to 3.04 percent. The price of
the 3.125 percent debt maturing in November 2041 climbed 2 7/32,
or $22.19 per $1,000 face amount, to 104 2/32.  Ten-year  note  yields dropped nine basis points to 1.92
percent, while two-year note yields fell two basis points to
0.27 percent.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index retreated 1.3 percent,
halting a five-day gain after the ECB said its balance sheet
climbed. The euro touched $1.2912, the weakest since Jan. 11.  Yield Curve  The gap between yields on two- and 30-year Treasuries,
known as the yield curve, shrank to 265 basis points, the least
since Dec. 19. The difference between yields on conventional 10-
year U.S. notes and inflation-linked Treasuries, a gauge of the
inflation outlook for the period known as the  break-even rate ,
decreased to 1.99 percentage points, its first time below 2
percent on a closing basis since Dec. 19.  A $30 billion auction of four-week Treasury bills that drew
a rate of zero attracted the fourth-highest level of  demand  on
record. The bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by comparing
the number of bids with the amount of securities sold, was 6.68,
versus a five-year average of 3.81. The record high was 9.07 on
Dec. 20.  Treasuries Returns  Treasuries were headed for their best annual return since
the depths of the financial crisis in 2008. They have gained 9
percent in 2011, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
indexes. U.S. debt securities rallied in 2011 even after S&P
stripped the U.S. of its AAA credit rating on Aug. 5.  The ECB said its balance sheet climbed 239 billion euros to
2.73 trillion euros. Lending to euro-area banks jumped 214
billion euros to 879 billion euros in the week ended Dec. 23,
the Frankfurt-based central bank said in a statement today.  “The real key for Europe will be implementation of
austerity, and short of that we’ll have the same problems,”
said Giddis of Morgan Keegan. “That will keep a certain amount
of assets in risk-off. It will keep investors in dollar-
denominated assets.”  Treasuries briefly erased gains after  Italy  auctioned 9
billion euros of six-month bills at about half the rate they
fetched at a sale last month. The 179-day bills drew a rate of
3.251 percent, down from a 14-year-high of 6.504 percent at the
last auction of similar-maturity securities on Nov. 25.
Investors bid for 1.7 times the amount offered, up from 1.5
times last month.  The nation also sold 1.7 billion euros of zero-coupon notes
due in 2013, short of the maximum target, at 4.853 percent, down
from 7.814 percent on Nov. 25.  ‘Defensive Positions’  A bigger test comes tomorrow with Italy’s sale of longer-
maturity debt.  “People may be taking defensive positions in
anticipation” of the Italian bond supply tomorrow, said  Chris Ahrens , head interest-rate strategist at USB AG’s UBS Securities
unit in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , one of the 21 primary dealers
that trade with the  Federal Reserve . “They carry greater
capital risk, so people would look at that defensively. It’s
better to be safe than not.”  The Fed sold $8.63 billion of Treasuries today due from May
2014 to November 2014 as part of a program to lower borrowing
costs by replacing $400 billion of shorter-maturity Treasuries
in its holdings with longer-term debt.  Treasury market  volumes  have slid amid the Christmas and
New Year’s holiday season. About $108 billion of Treasuries
changed hands today through ICAP Plc, the world’s largest
interdealer broker, and about $90 billion changed hands on Dec.
23. The 2011 daily average is $287 billion.  “It’s a thin market,” said  David Coard , head of fixed-
income trading in  New York  at Williams Capital Group, a
brokerage for institutional investors. “We could see a lot of
volatility because there are not a lot of folks around and it’s
easy to move around the market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
