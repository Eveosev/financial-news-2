Chinese equities  listed in the U.S.
declined for a second day as fresh concern that  Europe ’s debt
crisis will derail global growth further dimmed the outlook for
corporate profits in the Asian nation.  The Bloomberg China-US 55 Index  slumped 0.8 percent to
94.70 as trading closed in New York, pushing the two-day decline
to 1.1 percent.  Yanzhou Coal Mining Co ., China’s fourth-biggest
coal producer, sank the most in two weeks.  Aluminum Corp. of
China Ltd. (ACH) , known as Chalco, dropped to a one-week low as a
report said its business in the first half of 2012 will be hit
by falling prices and orders.  Yingli Green Energy Holding Co. (YGE) 
and  LDK Solar Co. (LDK)  led a drop in solar stocks.  Global stocks retreated as the  European Central Bank ’s
balance sheet soared to a record 2.73 trillion euros ($3.55
trillion) after it lent financial institutions more money last
week to keep credit flowing during the debt crisis. Data
released this week showed profit growth at  China ’s industrial
companies slowed to the weakest pace in at least 10 months.  The government’s “restrictive policy slowed growth and it
hasn’t been a good year for Chinese stocks,” said  Tim Hartzell ,
chief investment officer at Houston-based Sequent Asset
Management. “Now you had the initial step back the other way.
It’s going to be a long way to turn around.”  The Chinese central bank cut the amount of cash lenders
must set aside as reserves this month for the first time since
2008. Vice Premier  Li Keqiang  said central government fiscal
spending may grow faster in 2012 than in 2011, the official
Xinhua News Agency reported Dec. 27.  Shanghai  Index (SPX)   The Bloomberg measure of the most-traded Chinese stocks
listed in the U.S. has lost 9.4 percent this year.  The Shanghai
Composite Index (SHCOMP)  rebounded yesterday from the lowest level since
March 2009, climbing 0.2 percent to 2,170.01. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index dropped 1.3 percent to 1,249.64.  Chalco, the listed unit of the nation’s biggest maker of
aluminum, slid 4 percent to $10.61. The company’s profit will be
hurt by declining prices and orders in the first half next year,
the Sing Tao Daily reported yesterday, citing General Manager
 Xiong Weiping . Chalco plans to develop other mining businesses
including copper, rare earth,  iron ore  and coking coal, the
report said.  Aluminum for three-month delivery fell for a second day on
the London Metal Exchange. The contract’s price has lost 19
percent this year.  Yanzhou Coal  Yanzhou’s American depositary receipts, each of which
represents 10 common shares, slid 4 percent to $20.42. The
decline in the ADRs resulted in a discount to its shares traded
in  Hong Kong , which fell 2.7 percent to HK$16.28, the equivalent
of $2.09 per share.  The company agreed to buy  Australia ’s Gloucester Coal Ltd.
last week for A$2.1 billion ($2.1 billion) in cash and shares.
Tang Sing Hing, an analyst at AMTD Financial Planning Ltd.,
rated the company “buy” in a report yesterday, saying the
acquisition will help improve Yanzhou’s portfolio. Bocom
International Holdings analyst He Wei maintained a “long-term
buy” rating on the shares yesterday with a 12-month price
target of $35.91.  The ishares FTSE China 25 Index Fund, the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., dropped 1.8 percent to $34.53.
The Chinese yuan was little changed at 6.3212 per dollar,
according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System. It has
appreciated 4.5 percent against the dollar this year, the most
among the 25 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  China, the world’s second-largest economy, grew 9.1 percent
in the third quarter from a year earlier, down from 9.5 percent
in the second. Consumer prices rose 4.2 percent in November from
a year ago, the slowest pace in 14 months.  Yingli, Trina Solar  Solar stocks fell as competition intensifies in the
industry in China. Yingli, the Baoding, China-based maker of
solar modules, plummeted 6.9 percent to $3.66, the most in two
weeks. LDK solar, China’s second-largest maker of solar wafers,
slid 5.2 percent to $4.60.  Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL) , the fifth-largest solar-panel supplier,
will raise module and cell capacity more than 26 percent next
year even as prices fall on a supply glut, it said yesterday in
a statement.  Prices for solar modules continue to fall on oversupply,
with the average cost declining 47 percent this year to $0.94 a
watt, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  Trina retreated 5 percent to $6.69, the lowest in a week.  The Shanghai benchmark stock measure is trading at an
estimated price-earnings ratio of 10.5 times. That compares with
13.7 for Indian stocks, 10 for Brazilian shares and 4.6 for
Russian equities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
