Qatar , the world’s biggest exporter
of liquefied natural gas, said its nominal gross domestic
product increased an annual 40 percent on expanding gas output.  Third-quarter GDP at current prices rose to 164.8 billion
($45 billion) riyals, the state statistics authority said in an
e-mailed press release. The mining and quarrying sector, which
includes gas and oil, increased 57 percent and manufacturing
rose 37 percent, according to the statement.  The rise “has been driven mainly by expansion in the
production levels of LNG, pipeline gas, other gas-related
products and condensates, coupled with increases in hydrocarbon
prices,” the statistics authority said.  Qatar, projected by the I nternational Monetary Fund  to have
the world’s fastest-growing economy for a second year in 2011,
raised its capacity to produce LNG, gas cooled to a liquid for
transport by ship, to 77 million tons with the start of its 14th
liquefaction plant earlier this year. Royal Dutch Shell’s Pearl
GTL, the world’s largest plant that converts gas into liquid
fuels such as diesel and kerosene, also started operation this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
