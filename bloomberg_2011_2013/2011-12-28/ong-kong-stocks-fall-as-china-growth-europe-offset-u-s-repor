Hong Kong stocks fell, with the Hang
Seng Index set for its first annual loss in three years, as
concern that slower growth in China and  Europe ’s sovereign-debt
crisis will damp company earnings offset better-than-estimated
U.S. consumer confidence.  Just four of 40 members on the  Hang Seng China Enterprises
Index (HSCEI)  advanced after the country announced slowing industrial
profit growth and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said the pace of
expansion may slow in the largest  emerging markets . China
Mengniu Dairy Co., the country’s largest producer of  milk
products , plunged 24 percent after a batch of milk was found
with high levels of a potentially cancer-causing toxin.
Industrial & Commercial Bank of China, the world’s No. 1 lender
by market value, dropped 3.3 percent.  The Hang Seng Index fell 0.6 percent to 18,518.67 at the 4
p.m. close after public holidays on Dec. 26 and Dec. 27. The
gauge climbed 1.9 percent last week, taking this quarter’s
advance to 5.9 percent. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of
mainland companies listed in  Hong Kong  fell 1.5 percent to
9,980.51.  “Declines are due to the slowing mainland economy and
disappointment that rumors last week about China loosening money
supply and undertaking other measures to boost the market did
not materialize,” said Francis Lun, managing director at
Lyncean Holdings Ltd. in Hong Kong. “Europe lacks the political
resolve to fix its problems. The longer they delay it, the worse
it will get.”  The Hang Seng Index fell 19 percent this year as banks and
developers dropped on China’s measures to curb inflation and
property prices.  Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330)  led declines in 2011,
falling 72 percent through today, on concern Europe’s failure to
contain its debt crisis will further undermine the brand in its
biggest market.  Futures, Volatility  Two  stocks (HSI)  fell for each that gained in the 48-member Hang
Seng Index. Companies in the gauge traded at 10.1 times forecast
earnings, down from 14.4 times at the end of 2010, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
traded at 12.8 times.  Futures on the  S&P 500 (SPXL1)  fell 0.2 percent today. The index
rose less than 0.1 percent in  New York  yesterday after the
consumer confidence report was offset by larger-than-estimated
declines in  home prices  and concern that Europe’s debt crisis is
still far from being resolved.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index fell 0.8 percent to 18,440.
The  HSI Volatility Index  climbed 4.7 percent to 24.73,
indicating options traders expect a swing of 7.1 percent in the
benchmark over the next 30 days.  China Mengniu fell the most in more than three years in
Hong Kong trading after saying moldy feed given to cows led to
excessive levels of a toxin in its milk. The shares tumbled 24
percent to HK$20.  Railway Companies Plunge  China Railway Construction Corp. (1186)  fell 5.4 percent to
HK$4.23 and China Railway Group Ltd. dropped 8.5 percent to
HK$2.37. The railway ministry will invest 400 billion yuan ($63
billion) in infrastructure construction next year, less than the
estimated 469 billion yuan spent in 2011 and the 709 billion
yuan spent in 2010, the  China Daily  reported Dec. 24.  ICBC, the country’s biggest bank, declined 3.3 percent to
HK$4.70 after announcing a plan to sell 50 billion yuan of bonds
tomorrow, according to a statement on the website of the Chinese
government bond clearinghouse.  Zoomlion Heavy Industry Science & Technology Co. , a maker
of cranes and heavy machinery, led construction-related
companies lower after a report in 21st Century Business Herald
that  China ’s government may purchase “normal” homes for use as
affordable housing. The shares fell 4.2 percent to HK$8.50.  Anhui Conch Cement Co., the largest maker of the material,
sank 5 percent to HK$22.85. China Overseas Land & Investment
Ltd., a state-owned builder, dropped 3 percent to HK$13.80.
