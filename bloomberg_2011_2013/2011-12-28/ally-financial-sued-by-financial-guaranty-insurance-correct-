Ally Financial Inc.  was sued by
Financial Guaranty Insurance Co. over soured  mortgage loans 
backing securities sold to investors and insured by Financial
Guaranty.  Ally’s Residential Funding unit made “material
misrepresentations” about the loans, which were riskier than
promised, Financial Guaranty said in two lawsuits filed
yesterday in New York State Supreme Court in  Manhattan .  “The levels of defaults and losses, and therefore the
amount of claims presented to FGIC, have been overwhelming,”
the company said in court papers.  The lawsuits involve insurance policies issued by Financial
Guaranty in connection with about $1.9 billion in mortgage-
backed securities, according to court papers.  FGIC Corp. , the
New York-based holding company for Financial Guaranty, filed for
bankruptcy in 2010. Financial Guaranty previously sued Ally
units in November.  Gina Proia, a spokeswoman for Detroit-based Ally, said in
an e-mail that the transactions are those of its ResCap unit, a
separate legal entity, and there is “no merit” to Ally being
named in the complaint.  “We believe there are substantial legal and factual
defenses related to the FGIC claims against ResCap, and we
intend to defend that position aggressively,” she said.  The cases are Financial Guaranty Insurance Co. v.  Ally
Financial  Inc., 653621-2011, and Financial Guaranty Insurance
Co. v. Ally Financial, 653623-2011, New York State Supreme Court
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
