The euro slid to a 10-year low
versus the yen and stocks fell, halting a five-day rally in the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, as Italian bonds erased earlier
gains and a surge in the  European Central Bank ’s balance sheet
to a record highlighted risks from the region’s debt crisis.  The euro lost as much as 1.1 percent to 100.73 yen and
decreased 1 percent to an 11-month low of $1.2937. The  S&P 500 
dropped 1.3 percent to 1,249.64 at 4 p.m. in New York and the
 Dow Jones Industrial Average  lost 139.94 points, or 1.1 percent,
to 12,151.41. Ten-year Italian bond yields rose less than one
basis point to 6.999 percent after losing as much as 25 basis
points. Oil snapped a six-day advance and gold capped the
longest slump in two years.  U.S. Treasuries  rallied.  The ECB’s balance sheet soared to a record 2.73 trillion
euros ($3.55 trillion) after it lent financial institutions more
money last week in an attempt to keep credit flowing to the
economy during the debt crisis. Early gains in stocks and U.S.
index futures came after  Italy ’s borrowing costs plunged at an
auction of 9 billion euros of six-month bills, while investors
turned their attention to the nation’s auction of longer-term
bonds tomorrow.  “If the  euro zone  banks are too afraid to lend, that does
not bode well for future growth in the region,” Brian Jacobsen,
who helps oversee about $209 billion as chief portfolio
strategist at Wells Fargo Advantage Funds in  Menomonee Falls ,
 Wisconsin , said in a telephone interview. “The banks are not
borrowing from the ECB in order to spur lending. It’s to shore
up their own balance sheets. That could lead to a credit
contraction in the euro zone.”  ECB Loans  The ECB last week awarded 523 banks three-year loans
totaling a record 489 billion euros to encourage lending. So
far, banks are parking the money back at the ECB. Overnight
deposits at the central bank increased to an all-time high of
452 billion euros yesterday.  The euro weakened against all 16 of its major peers except
for the British pound and Danish krone. The pound decreased
against all 16 peers, while the dollar strengthened against 13
of 16.  The S&P 500 retreated after rising for a  fifth straight (SPX)  day
yesterday, matching its longest streak of gains of the year.
Commodity and energy producers and financial companies led
losses in all 10 of the main industry groups in the benchmark
index today. Caterpillar Inc., Chevron Corp. and 3M Co. fell
more than 1 percent to lead declines in all 30 stocks in the
Dow.  Year in Stocks  With two more trading days left in 2011, the S&P 500 would
need to rise 2.6 percent to reach the year-end forecast of Wall
Street strategists. Their mean estimate of 1,282 is lower than
the 1,371 predicted in January, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Today’s decline sent the S&P 500 down 0.6 percent for
the year. Still, a 10.5 percent rally since the end of September
put the gauge on pace for the best fourth-quarter since 2003.  Treasury 10-year yields slipped eight basis points to 1.92
percent, while the 10-year German bund yield was three basis
points lower at 1.89 percent.  Oil in  New York  dropped 2 percent to $99.36 a barrel, the
first decline in seven sessions.  Crude climbed as high as $101.71 earlier amid concern  Iran 
will block the Strait of Hormuz, through which passes about 15.5
million barrels of oil a day, a sixth of global consumption. The
U.S. won’t tolerate a disruption to shipping in the strait, Navy
spokeswoman Rebecca Rebarich said in an e-mail. Gulf Arab
countries are prepared to make up for any loss of Iranian oil
from the world market, the  Associated Press  reported, citing an
unidentified Saudi Arabian oil official.  Gold Retreats  Gold for February delivery declined 2 percent to settle at
$1,564.10 an ounce, a fifth straight drop.  Cotton trimmed gains
after jumping the exchange limit 4 cents, or 4.6 percent, to
91.91 cents in New York as sales dropped by farmers in  India ,
the world’s second-largest grower.  Germany ’s  DAX Index (DAX)  lost 2 percent to lead declines among
major European markets. The FTSE 100 Index slipped 0.1 percent
today in the U.K., where financial markets were shut the
previous two days for holidays.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell 0.7 percent today and has
dropped 13 percent this year, compared with an 18 percent slump
in the MSCI Asia-Pacific Index and a loss of 0.6 percent in the
S&P 500, which has fluctuated above and below its 2010 closing
level since the end of October.  Today’s decline brought the S&P 500 back below its average
price over the past 200 days after it climbed above the trend
line in the previous two sessions. The Dow is up 5 percent in
2011.  Italian Debt  Two-year Italian yields slipped seven basis points to 5.00
percent today.  Italy sold 179-day bills today at a rate of 3.251 percent,
down from 6.504 percent at the last auction on Nov. 25. Demand
was 1.7 times the amount offered, compared with 1.47 times last
month. Italy will seek to sell bonds maturing in 2014, 2018,
2021 and 2022 tomorrow. The nation’s 10-year bond yields climbed
to 7 percent yesterday, the level that foreshadowed bailouts for
 Greece , Ireland and  Portugal . A report tomorrow may show Italian
business confidence dipped to the lowest in almost two years.  The MSCI Emerging Markets Index dropped 1.3 percent, its
biggest decline since Dec. 19. South Korea’s Kospi index fell
0.9 percent, down for a third day. India’s  Sensex (SENSEX)  decreased 0.9
percent before a report this week that may show the nation’s
current-account deficit widened to a record. Hungary’s BUX Index
retreated 1 percent, Poland’s WIG20 decreased 1.2 percent and
Turkey’s ISE National 100 Index slipped 1.9 percent.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific retreated 0.8 percent today.  Japan ’s industrial output slumped 2.6 percent in November
from October, more than all the forecasts in a Bloomberg survey
of 29 economists. The Bank of Korea said an index of
manufacturers’ expectations for January was 79, the lowest since
July 2009. Thailand’s industrial output sank the most in more
than a decade in November, government data showed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
