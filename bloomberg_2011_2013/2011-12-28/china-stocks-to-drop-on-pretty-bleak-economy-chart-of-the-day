China  stocks, trading at their
biggest discount to global equities in more than five years, may
extend the world’s worst two-year loss into 2012 as economic
growth slows and  money supply  tightens.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows the spread between the price-to-
estimated earnings ratios of the  Shanghai  Composite Index and
the MSCI AC World Index of developed and emerging nations since
2005. Companies in Shanghai traded at a record-low 10.41 times
on Dec. 22, the biggest discount to the global gauge’s ratio
since April 13, 2006, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
bottom panel tracks China’s quarterly gross domestic product
growth and monthly M2, a broad measure of money supply.  “The growth outlook is pretty bleak next year as the
government won’t increase money supply aggressively or introduce
a huge stimulus plan because inflation is still at a pretty high
level,” said  Zhang Qi , an analyst in Shanghai at Haitong
Securities Co., China’s third-largest brokerage. “Without
faster economic growth, the stock market will continue to
fall.”  China’s gross domestic product growth will slow to 8.5
percent in 2012, the least in 11 years, according to the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The
nation’s money supply expanded 12.7 percent in November, the
smallest monthly change in a decade. Government officials are
weighing benefits of stimulus against concerns over elevated
 house prices  and local-government debt.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  has plunged 34 percent since
2009, the worst performer among the world’s biggest 15 markets,
compared with 1.1 percent loss by MSCI’s global gauge. The value
of stocks traded in Shanghai slumped to the weakest level in
three years on Dec. 26.  When the Shanghai Composite last traded at such a discount
to the  MSCI World Index (MXWD)  in April 2006, GDP growth of as much as
14 percent helped the stocks gauge more than quadruple in 18
months. A 72 percent rout in stocks spurred by the global
financial crisis was reversed in late 2008 by 4 trillion yuan
($633 billion) of stimulus, which drove  money supply (CNMS2YOY)  up by a
monthly average of 26 percent in 2009.  --Richard Frost, Zhang Shidong. Editors: Darren Boey.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff for this story:
