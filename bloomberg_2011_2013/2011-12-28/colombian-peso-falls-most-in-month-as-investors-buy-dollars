Colombia ’s peso fell the most in a
month as investors bought U.S. dollars before the end of the
year.  The peso plunged 1 percent to 1,941.25 per  U.S. dollar ,
from 1,922.50 yesterday. That’s the biggest drop, on a closing
basis, since Nov. 25.  The Colombian currency has retreated 1.7 percent this year
on concern global growth will slow amid Europe’s sovereign-debt
turmoil. U.S. stocks fell today as a surge in the European
Central Bank’s balance sheet to a record highlighted the growing
risks of the region’s debt crisis.  “What we’re seeing today is specific trades moving the
market as investors make last-minute operations before the end
of the year,” said  Camilo Perez , head analyst at Banco de
Bogota SA. “With such low volume, any trade causes sharp
movements in the peso.”  The yield on the nation’s 10 percent bonds due in July 2024
rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.64 percent,
according to the stock exchange. The bond’s price fell 0.136
centavo to 118.512 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
