Bombardier Inc. (BBD/B) , which lost out to
 Siemens AG (SIE)  in a U.K. trainmaking contract, won a $296 million
order to build trains for Britain’s Southern Railway, helping
ease pressure on jobs at its Derby, England site.  The Canadian manufacturer will supply 130 of its
Electrostar cars to Southern, which operates on commuter routes
in and out of the U.K. capital. Production will start in the
second half of 2012, the company said in a statement.  Bombardier is cutting jobs at its Derby plant after the
U.K. government’s decision to award a contract to build 1,200
carriages for Britain’s new Thameslink commuter service to
Siemens on June 16. Siemens will carry out most of the
manufacturing work in  Germany . This time around, the government
provided 80 million pounds in funding to support the Southern
contract.  “The award of this contract does not let the government
off the hook on either the unsigned Thameslink contract or the
looming Crossrail deal,”  Geoff Martin , an official at the RMT
union, said in an e-mail. “That’s the work we need to secure
the long term future of train building in the U.K.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
