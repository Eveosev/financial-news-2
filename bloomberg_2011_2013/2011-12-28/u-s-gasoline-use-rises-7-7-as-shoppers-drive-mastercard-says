U.S. gasoline demand rose 7.7
percent last week from the prior week, boosted by holiday
shoppers, according to  MasterCard Inc. (MA)   Drivers bought 9.46 million barrels a day of gasoline in
the week ended Dec. 23, up from 8.78 million the week before,
according to MasterCard Inc.’s SpendingPulse report.  Fuel use fell below a year earlier for the 17th consecutive
time last week, slipping 1.6 percent from 2010 levels. Fuel
demand over the previous four weeks was 3.6 percent below a year
earlier, the 40th consecutive decline in that measure.  “We observed a noticeable week-to-week spike in gasoline
consumption as many drivers hit the road,” John Gamel, a
gasoline analyst and director of economic analysis for
SpendingPulse, said in the report.  Gasoline consumption in 2011 through Dec. 23 is down 1.6
percent from a year earlier, according to the second-biggest
payments network company.  The average pump price fell 4 cents to $3.23 a gallon, the
lowest level since Feb. 18. Prices were 7.7 percent higher than
a year earlier.  Gasoline demand peaked this year at 9.56 million barrels a
day in the week ended July 1 as motorists filled their tanks
before the July 4 holiday weekend. The lowest level of
consumption came in the week ended Feb. 11, when consumers
bought 8.47 million barrels a day.  The report from Purchase, New York-based MasterCard is
assembled by MasterCard Advisors, the company’s consulting arm.

check payments at about 140,000 U.S. gasoline stations.  Visa Inc. (V)  is the biggest payments network company by
