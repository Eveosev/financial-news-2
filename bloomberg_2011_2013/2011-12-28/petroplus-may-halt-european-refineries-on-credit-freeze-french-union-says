Petroplus Holdings AG may announce
the halt of its five European refineries today because it can’t
buy the crude it needs to maintain operations, according to a
French union representative.  Petroplus management and union representatives are meeting
later today at the Petit Couronne plant in northern  France 
following yesterday’s announcement by the company that lenders
have frozen credit, Laurent Patinier, a representative
of the CFDT union, said by telephone.  “They are clearly planning to stop the five European
refineries,” Patinier said. “When you can’t pay for crude, you
have to stop operations.”  The French refinery has been operating at lower production
rates than normal because of weakening refining margins, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
