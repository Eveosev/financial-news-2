Hungary  will unveil details in
January on subsidized forint loans for public workers who wish
to repay their foreign-currency mortgages at below market rates,
state news agency MTI said, citing a government official.  Public-sector workers should apply for the early repayment
plan to “escape the trap of foreign-currency loans,”  Peter Szijjarto , spokesman for Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  said,
according to MTI.  Orban sent out a letter to public workers last week
encouraging them to repay their foreign-currency mortgages under
the plan and promised the government would secure subsidized
forint loans for those wishing to refinance their mortgages, MTI
said.  Borrowers have until Dec. 30 to indicate to their banks
that they want to repay their mortgages, MTI said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
