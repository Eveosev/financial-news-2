OAO Acron (AKRN) , a Russian fertilizer
producer, rose in Moscow trading after announcing a plan to
cancel 15 percent of its shares as part of a reorganization.  Acron gained as much as 2.7 percent and was up 1.6 percent
at 1,375 rubles by 1:39 p.m. in the city. The company scheduled
a shareholder meeting on Feb. 27 to consider the reorganization
through a takeover of its Granit unit, which holds Treasury
shares, according to a company statement today.  “It is long expected and very positive news for all
shareholders as it increases the value of the stock,” Elena Sakhnova, a VTB Capital analyst, said today by telephone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
