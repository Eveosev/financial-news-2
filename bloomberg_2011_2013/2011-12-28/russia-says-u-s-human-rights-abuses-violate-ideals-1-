Human rights abuses by the U.S.
government, including violations of the law of war and
disproportionate use of force, are “far from the ideals
declared by  Washington ,” Russia’s Foreign Ministry said.  “The main unresolved problem is the odious prison in
Guantanamo Bay,” the ministry said in a  report  released today
on its website. “Violations of international humanitarian
rights in military conflict zones continue without end.”  The Obama administration’s effort to close Guantanamo have
been blocked by Congress. At the State Department in Washington
today, spokesman Mark Toner said the Russian report “can be a
useful mechanism” and may be studied.  “We certainly don’t regard it as interference in our
internal affairs,” Toner said. He added, “In terms of our
human rights record, we’re an open book.”  The U.S. and Russia have had strained relations over issues
unrelated to Guantanamo. The two nations have disagreed over the
NATO military campaign in  Libya  and U.S.-led attempts to censure
Syria at the United Nations for its crackdown on anti-government
protesters.  Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  accused U.S. Secretary of
State  Hillary Clinton  of provoking Russian protests against
alleged voter fraud following the Dec. 4 parliamentary election.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
