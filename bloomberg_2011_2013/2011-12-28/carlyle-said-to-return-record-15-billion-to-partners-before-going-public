Carlyle Group LP, the Washington-
based private-equity firm planning to go public next year,
returned $15 billion to its limited partners during the first
three quarters of 2011, the most the firm has ever distributed
over a nine-month period, according to an investor.  The amount includes equity plus gains on the capital, said
the investor, who asked not to be identified because the
information is private. Carlyle deployed $8.2 billion of capital
in the first three quarters, the investor said.  Carlyle’s distribution tops the $5.6 billion New York rival
KKR & Co. returned to investors in the same period. Carlyle has
exited investments including Insight Communications Co., which
it agreed to sell to Time Warner Cable Inc. in August for $3
billion, and Kinder Morgan Inc., which raised $2.9 billion in an
initial public offering in February.  Carlyle, which was founded in 1987 and oversaw $148 billion
in assets as of Sept. 30, is planning to go public next year in
what may be the biggest IPO by a private-equity manager since
Blackstone Group LP raised $4.75 billion in 2007.  Carlyle’s distribution amount was reported earlier today by
the Financial Times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
