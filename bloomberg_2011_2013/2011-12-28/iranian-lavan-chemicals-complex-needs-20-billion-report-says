The construction of a petrochemicals
complex on Iran’s Lavan Island would require $20 billion in
investment, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported, citing an
official at Iranian Offshore Oil Co.  A single petrochemicals plant on Lavan would cost $5
billion, Mahmoud Zirakchianzadeh, the company’s managing
director, told the official news agency.  Iranian offshore awarded a $1.9 billion contract to Sepehr
Energy Co. to develop the Lavan  gas field  and build a chemicals
complex on the island, state-run Mehr reported yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
