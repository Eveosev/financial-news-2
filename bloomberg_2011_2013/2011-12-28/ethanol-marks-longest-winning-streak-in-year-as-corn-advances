Ethanol futures posted the longest
streak of gains in a year on anticipation that bad weather in
 South America  will lead to higher production costs.  Futures increased an eighth day amid forecasts for dry
weather and above-normal temperatures in  Argentina  that could
curtail the nation’s corn crop and result in higher demand for
U.S. supplies. Ethanol is made mostly from corn in the U.S.  “We’ve had a pretty good rally in corn recently and
ethanol has gone with it,” said Matt Janney, a trader at
Citigroup Global Markets Inc. in  Chicago . “If you look at the
charts they’re pretty much identical.”  Denatured ethanol for January delivery rose 0.8 cent, or
0.4 percent, to settle at $2.231 a gallon on the Chicago Board
of Trade in the longest streak of increases since Dec. 29, 2010.
It was the highest price since Dec. 5. Futures have fallen 6.2
percent this year, headed for the first yearly drop since 2008.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  gained 1 cent,
or 0.4 percent, to $2.335 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the
additive increased 1 cent, or 0.4 percent, to $2.34, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago added 1.5 cents, or 0.7 percent, to
$2.275 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel rose 1 cent,
or 0.4 percent, to $2.295.  Corn futures for March delivery climbed 9.25 cents, or 1.5
percent, to $6.425 a bushel on the CBOT.  To contact the reporter on this story:
