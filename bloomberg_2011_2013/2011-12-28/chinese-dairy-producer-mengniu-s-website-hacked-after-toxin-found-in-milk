The website for  China Mengniu Dairy
Co. (2319) , the nation’s largest milk producer, was hacked overnight
after it said moldy feed given to cows led to excessive levels
of a toxin in its milk.  The title of mengniu.com.cn was changed to “Hacked
By:Drift,” and a message was posted saying “Mengniu once made
the Chinese people strong and proud, but now it’s doing harm to
its own people.” The website was taken over as early as 11:26
p.m. Beijing time yesterday and restored after midnight local
time.  China’s General Administration of Quality Supervision,
Inspection and Quarantine found excessive levels of flavacin M1
in the batch of  milk products  produced by China Mengniu during a
random inspection, according to  test results  released on the
regulator’s website Dec. 24. China Mengniu said moldy feed given
to cows led to excessive levels of a toxin in its milk.  Mengniu declined 24 percent to HK$20 at the close in  Hong
Kong  yesterday, the most since September 2008.  -- Editors: Marie-France Han, Brendan Walsh  To contact the reporter on this story:
