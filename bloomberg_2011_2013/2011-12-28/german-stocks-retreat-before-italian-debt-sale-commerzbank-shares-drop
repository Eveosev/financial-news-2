German stocks  retreated, with the
benchmark DAX Index snapping three days of gains, as the
 European Central Bank ’s balance sheet expanded to a record after
it lent financial institutions more money last week.  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  and  Commerzbank AG (CBK) , the nation’s biggest
lenders, declined more than 3.5 percent.  Bayerische Motoren
Werke AG  and  Daimler AG (DAI)  followed a selloff in European
carmakers.  ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA)  and  Salzgitter AG (SZG)  dropped with metal
prices.  The DAX Index slid 2 percent to 5,771.27 at the close in
Frankfurt. The benchmark gauge is headed for a 17 percent loss
this year, its biggest drop since 2008, as euro-area leaders
struggle to contain the region’s debt crisis. The broader HDAX
Index tumbled 1.8 percent today.  Lending to euro-area banks jumped by 214 billion euros
($280 billion) to 879 billion euros in the week ended Dec. 23,
the Frankfurt-based ECB said today. Its balance sheet increased
239 billion euros to 2.73 trillion euros, it said.  “The trading volume is very low so you can move the market
easily,” said Andreas Lipkow, an equity trader at MWB Fairtrade
Wertpapierhandelsbank AG in  Frankfurt . “Maybe someone used the
ECB statement to move the market but the statement is not very
new.”  German stocks (SXXP)  were little changed earlier as Italy sold 9
billion euros of six-month Treasury bills at half the yield it
agreed to pay at an auction last month. The Rome-based Treasury
auctioned the 179-day bills at a rate of 3.251 percent, down
from 6.504 percent on Nov. 25. Demand was 1.7 times the amount
for sale, compared with 1.47 times last month.  Italy also sold 1.733 billion euros of 2013 notes to yield
4.853 percent, compared with a yield of 7.814 percent at the
last auction on Nov. 25. Tomorrow, the nation will auction four
different securities, including a 10-year bond.  Deutsche Bank and  Commerzbank  lost 3.8 percent to 28.63
euros and 4.2 percent to 1.27 euros, respectively.  Luxury carmaker BMW fell 3.3 percent to 51.10 euros, while
competitor Daimler dropped 3.9 percent, to 33.07 euros.
Automakers were the worst performers in the benchmark Stoxx
Europe 600 Index today, losing 3 percent as a group.  ThyssenKrupp and Salzgitter,  Germany ’s biggest steelmakers,
tumbled 2.5 percent to 17.51 euros and 2.6 percent to 37.90
euros, respectively. Copper, lead, nickel, tin and zinc all fell
on the London Metal Exchange today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
