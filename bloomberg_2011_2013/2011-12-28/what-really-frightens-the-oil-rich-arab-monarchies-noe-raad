Dec. 27 -- In a summit ending with a call for greater "union" rather than mere "cooperation," the oil-rich, Arab monarchies of the Gulf Cooperation Council stressed threats emanating from  Iran . Commentators were quick to add that popular revolt prompted by a lack of democracy should also be of concern to the Arab kings. Made up of  Saudi Arabia , the  United Arab Emirates , Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and Bahrain, the GCC was set up in 1981 as a mechanism to balance against Iran, which the U.S. in October accused of plotting to murder the Saudi ambassador in  Washington . The council has accused Iran of instigating unrest in the region. Bahrain has seen months of sometimes violent protests for greater democracy tamped down by a GCC force led by Saudi Arabia, which has itself aggressively countered unrest in several of its oil-rich, eastern provinces. But that's not the full story,  wrote columnist Hussein Ali al-Hamdani  in a piece in the Iraqi daily Al-Mada headlined “The Gulf Summit, Unity Instead of Reform": Underscoring Hamdani’s point, one leading pro-monarchy commentator, Tariq al-Homayed, in his recent column about the GCC, dropped all mention of political reform. Writing last May in his capacity as the editor-in-chief of the Saudi-owned, London-based Asharq al-Awsat,  Homayed had praised  the council's decision to invite Jordan and  Morocco  to join, writing: By last week, however, much like the GCC -- which made it clear Jordan and Morocco were not likely to gain entry to the group any time soon -- Homayed had changed course, omitting any mention of the membership issue and the need for reform.  Instead, he wrote : The Gulf states are different from other countries in the region, Homayed wrote admiringly, since, “despite any flaws and shortcomings,” they have remained “the same today as they were yesterday,” prior to the popular revolts that have shaken other parts of the Arab world. For columnist Jameel Theyabi , writing in a rival Saudi-owned daily, the London-based Al-Hayat, such pronouncements will no longer do. He wrote: Failure to go down the road of domestic political reform, Theyabi concluded, “would be like planting bombs that could explode at any moment.” Similarly,  Abdel-Beri Atwan , editor-in-chief of  London ’s Al-Quds al-Arabi, advised Jordan and Morocco to embark on reforms as a reaction to the snub by the GCC -- which allocated $5 billion in aid to be divided between them, a sum Atwan dismissed as meager compared with their economic problems and the income of the Gulf monarchies. He urged: Now there's an interesting idea: model behavior as the best form of revenge. (Nicholas Noe and Walid Raad are the Beirut correspondents for the World View blog.
