Cyprus and  Hermes Airports  signed an
agreement today aimed at boosting the number of tourists by
offering incentives to airlines, said Efthymios Flourentzos,
minister of communications and works.  “The incentives aim at boosting tourist numbers mainly
from new markets through reduced passenger fees,” Flourentzos
told reporters in Nicosia today. “We intend to put these
incentives immediately into force. Passenger fees are considered
too high, mainly by low-cost airlines”.  Airlines can benefit from three incentive plans; one covers
new destinations, another the winter season and a third is
designed for airlines that intend using Cyprus’s airports for at
least five years, the minister said. The cut in passenger fees
will depend on the extra passengers carried, he added.  Nicolas Shacolas, honorary life chairman of Hermes
Airports, said the incentives could help increase tourist
arrivals “by more than 400,000” next year. Directly or
indirectly, tourism makes up a quarter of Cyprus’s economy, the
euro area’s third-smallest.  In the 11 months to November this year, 2,326,889 tourists
visited Cyprus, compared to 2,111,798 last year, government
statistics show.  Hermes Airports operates the island’s two international
airports at Paphos and Larnaca.  To contact the reporter on this story:
