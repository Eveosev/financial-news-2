Russian billionaire  Mikhail Prokhorov , who plans to contest the presidency next March, asked
supporters to cease donations after his campaign fund reached
the legal limit of 400 million rubles ($12.6 million).  “There’s no need to transfer any more money,” Prokhorov
said in a  blog  posting today. “By law, I won’t be able to use
it anyway.”  Campaign contributions are being made from across the
country, he said. Prokhorov, 46,  Russia ’s third-richest man
according to Forbes magazine and the owner of the New Jersey
Nets basketball team, this month announced his plan to challenge
Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  at the polls.  Prokhorov attended a Dec. 24 protest in Moscow against
alleged voter fraud in parliamentary elections as Russians
rallied in the biggest anti-government demonstrations against
Putin since he came to power 12 years ago.  “I feel your support, and it means a lot,” Prokhorov
wrote on his blog.  To contact the reporter on this story:
