Representatives of Bosnia’s three
main ethnic groups agreed on forming a central government, 14
months after elections,  Tanjug  news agency reported, citing a
Croat leader, Dragan Covic.  The Cabinet comprising ethnic Muslims, Serbs and Croats
will be headed by a yet-to-be-named Croat representative, the
Belgrade-based newswire said.  The end of political deadlock opens the way for an
agreement on the 2012 budget, holding a national census and
possible further integration with the European Union, the
newswire reported.  Standard & Poor’s  on Nov. 30 lowered Bosnia’s long-term
foreign-currency sovereign-credit rating to B from B+, citing
political disputes that prevented the formation of a government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
