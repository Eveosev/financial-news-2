Egypt  sold fewer nine-month treasury
bills than targeted as the yield climbed to a new high amid the
government’s plan to raise a record 170 billion pounds ($28
billion) in the coming fiscal quarter.  The Ministry of Finance raised 3 billion pounds out of the
3.5 billion pounds it had sought at an auction four days earlier
than planned. The average yield on the notes increased to 15.307
percent, the highest level since Bloomberg started tracking the
data in 2006, from 15.26 percent at a sale on Dec. 25. The rate
has surged 148 basis points, or 1.48 percentage point, since the
end of September.  Egypt’s local-currency borrowing costs have climbed amid
political and economic unrest that followed the ouster of
President  Hosni Mubarak  in February and as its financing needs
grew. The  finance ministry  raised 142.9 billion pounds out of
the 170 billion pounds it had targeted in the quarter that ends
this month, according to  data posted on its website .  The government plans to resume talks with the  International
Monetary Fund  for a $3.2 billion loan when the fund’s mission
arrives in Cairo next month, Minister of Planning Fayza
Aboulnaga said yesterday. The country signed an agreement this
week with the Arab Monetary Fund for a $270 million loan, after
receiving $200 million from the fund last month.  The yield on the 5.75 percent 10-year dollar bonds due
April 2020 advanced one basis point to 8.01 percent at 3:02 p.m.
in Cairo. The rate has increased 281 basis points this year.  The
pound (EGP)  weakened 0.1 percent to 6.0311 a dollar, taking this
year’s decline to 3.8 percent.  The finance ministry had moved the sale from Jan. 1 due to
the New Year holiday, according to a statement on the ministry’s
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
