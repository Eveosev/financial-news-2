Russian stocks declined a second
day, extending the Micex Index’s annual loss, on concern global
economic growth will slow, hurting exports from the world’s
largest energy supplier.  The 30-stock Micex fell 0.2 percent to 1,383.09 at the
close in Moscow, pushing this year’s decrease to 18 percent. The
dollar-measured RTS Index slid 1.2 percent to 1,382.19.  Stocks dipped as oil, the country’s biggest export, fell
for the first time in seven days as a surge in the  European
Central Bank ’s balance sheet to a record highlighted the growing
risks of the region’s debt crisis.  VTB Group , a Russian state-run lender, declined 1.2 percent
to 0.5923 rubles.  OAO Mobile TeleSystems , Russia’s largest
mobile-phone operator, dipped 1.6 percent to 179.78 rubles.  There’s “no significant positivity” for Russian stocks
today, so markets are following  Asia  lower, UralSib Capital, a
Moscow-based brokerage, said in a research note.  Economic reports today showed  Japan ’s industrial production
dropped and confidence among South Korean manufacturers sank to
a 30-month low. U.S. home prices fell more than projected in
October even as  consumer confidence  gained in December to an
eight-month high, data showed yesterday.  OAO Mechel , the largest supplier of coal to Russian
steelmakers, declined 2.7 percent to 256 rubles, while another
coal producer  OAO Raspadskaya  fell 0.9 percent to 101.15 rubles.  Russia  evacuated some coal mines in Siberia after a
magnitude 6.7 earthquake struck the Tuva region, the Emergency
Ministry said. Work is resuming and safety checks are
continuing, the ministry said. No injuries were reported.  Oil for February delivery fell as much as 1.4 percent in
electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  To contact the reporter on this story:
