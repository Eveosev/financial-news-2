BTA Bank’s capital shortfall widened
by 70.2 billion tenge ($473 million) last month, the Kazakh
central bank said.  The liabilities of the lender,  Kazakhstan ’s biggest before
it defaulted in 2009, exceeded assets by 232.6 billion tenge
under international accounting standards as of Dec. 1, compared
with a gap of 162.4 billion tenge a month earlier, the Almaty-
based central bank’s financial oversight committee said in a
monthly report on its  website  today.  BTA, which is seeking to restructure its debt for the
second time in as many years, will begin investor meetings on
Jan. 10 in  Singapore ,  London  and  New York , Chairman Anvar
Saidenov said in a letter to shareholders published on the
bank’s website yesterday. The bank said in September it has a
$150 million coupon payment due in January.  The Almaty-based lender may not make the next interest
payment “due on certain of its indebtedness,” Saidenov said in
the letter. “Any such payment would deteriorate the bank’s
current capital and liquidity ratios even further.”  The following table shows the 11-month performance of
Kazakhstan’s six largest lenders by assets, along with 12th-
ranked Temirbank, and their position as of Dec. 1. The data from
the oversight committee are in billions of tenge:  To contact the reporter on this story:
