Evraz Plc ,  Russia ’s largest
steelmaker, said its North American division agreed to borrow as
much as $610 million to refinance loans as it seeks to reduce
debt costs.  The five-year revolving credit facility will replace two
loans of $225 million and C$300 million ($294 million), Evraz
said today in a statement. A portion of the financing will be
used to fund working capital and other “corporate purposes” at
its U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries, it said.  Evraz, which reported  debt  of $7.2 billion at the end of
September, is refinancing loans as it seeks to expand while
protecting credit ratings. The steelmaker said this month it
plans to increase production of rails at a plant in Pueblo,
 Colorado , boosting the mill’s capacity by 10 percent to 525,000
metric tons a year from 2013.  The company agreed to pay interest at 1.5 percent to 2
percent over the  London  interbank offered rate, compared with
rates of 3.25 percent and 4.25 percent for the existing loans,
Evraz said. GE Capital Markets Inc., GE Capital Markets ( Canada )
Ltd., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc. and UBS Loan
Finance LLC arranged the transaction, the company said.  “It’s surprising news because the rate is low,” Kirill Chuyko, a Moscow-based analyst at UBS AG, said today by
telephone. “This is good for Evraz.”  Evraz’s shares started trading on London’s FTSE 100 index
on Dec. 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
