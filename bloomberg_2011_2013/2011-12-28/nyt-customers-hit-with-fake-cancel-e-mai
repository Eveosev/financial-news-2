New York Times Co. (NYT)  said it
erroneously sent an e-mail to about 8 million subscribers and
potential customers offering a 50 percent discount, after
earlier describing the note as having been sent by someone else.  The message “should have been sent to a very small number
of subscribers, but instead was sent to a vast distribution list
made up of people who had previously provided their e-mail
address to the New York Times,” Eileen Murphy, a company
spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. The message was intended for
about 300 people.  Earlier today, Times Co. said on its Twitter page that the
e-mail wasn’t from the company. The e-mail is addressed to
“Home Delivery Subscriber” and includes a phone number and an
offer code. The note, meant for subscribers of the company’s
namesake newspaper that had recently requested to cancel home
delivery, offers 50 percent off for 16 weeks.  Times Co. won’t extend the offer to all customers that
received the e-mail, Murphy said. A  New York  Times employee sent
the e-mail, spokeswoman Danielle Rhoades Ha said in a phone
interview.  Times Co. fell 1.2 percent to $7.67 at the close in New
York. The shares have dropped 22 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
