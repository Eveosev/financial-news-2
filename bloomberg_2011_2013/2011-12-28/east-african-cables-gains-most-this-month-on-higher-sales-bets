East African Cables Ltd. (EACL) , the
region’s biggest cable manufacturer, advanced the most this
month on speculation its sales will grow in 2012.  The stock rose 4.8 percent to 10.95 shillings at the end of
trading in Nairobi, the biggest gain since Dec. 1.  TransCentury  Ltd., which has a major stake in East African
Cables, acquired Civicon and “this has resulted in positive
sentiment that the market for cables will grow,” Deris Mogoi, a
research analyst at Nairobi-based Standard Investment Bank Ltd.,
said by phone today.  Shareholders of TransCentury, a Kenyan investor in
infrastructure projects, said Dec. 7 shareholders approved an
investment in Civicon Ltd., a civil and mechanical engineering
company with operations in five East African nations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
