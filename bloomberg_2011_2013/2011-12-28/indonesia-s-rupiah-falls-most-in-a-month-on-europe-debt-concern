Indonesia’s rupiah declined for a
second day on concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will sap demand for
emerging-market assets.  The currency traded near a two-week low as the  MSCI Asia
Pacific Index (MXAP)  of regional shares fell.  Foreign ownership  of
Indonesian government debt slid to 222.76 trillion rupiah ($24.4
billion) as of Dec. 23, from 223.7 trillion rupiah a week
earlier, finance-ministry data show. Italy’s 10-year bond yields
reached 7 percent yesterday, the level that spurred  Greece ,
Ireland and  Portugal  to seek bailouts. The rupiah also dropped
on speculation importers bought dollars.  “There is some risk-reduction in the regional markets
because of Europe,” said Tetsuo Yoshikoshi, a senior economist
at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. in Singapore. “At the end of
the year, dollar demand from importers is more than usual and
that may be putting pressure on the currency.”  The rupiah weakened 0.8 percent to 9,145 per dollar as of
3:15 p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 9,200 today and yesterday, the
weakest level since Dec. 15. The currency has dropped 1.5
percent this year, headed for first annual decline since 2008.  The yield on the government’s benchmark 8.25 percent notes
due July 2021 fell seven basis points, or 0.7 percentage point,
to 6.04 percent today, according to the midday prices by Inter-
Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
