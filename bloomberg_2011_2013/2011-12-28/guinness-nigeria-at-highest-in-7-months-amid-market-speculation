Guinness Nigeria Plc , the nation’s
second-largest brewer by market value, rose to the highest in
seven months amid speculation strategic investors may have
increased their stake in the company.  The stock rose as much as 5 percent to 257.25 naira before
trading up 2 percent at 250 naira at 12:52 p.m. in Lagos. A
close at this price would be the highest since June 8.  “It could be that some strategic investors are taking
position on the stock on its expansion project to cause such a
high demand for it,” David Adonri, chief executive officer of
Lagos-based Lambeth Trust and Investment Co., said by phone
today. Almost 452,000 shares were traded, down 24 percent since
the exchange’s previous session on Dec. 23, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Guinness parent  Diageo Plc (DGE)  this year started a 
56 billion-naira ($344 million) investment program for Guinness 
Nigeria to expand its Benin and Ogba breweries and upgrade other 
facilities tomeet growing demand for Harp lager and Guinness 
Foreign Extra Stout.  “These are factors that are compelling enough to encourage
investors to take position on the stock,” Adonri said.  The stock has gained 31 percent this year compared with a
16.8 percent loss for the Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share
Index over the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
