The  New Zealand  and Australian
dollars dropped against their U.S. counterpart as concern
increased that the euro region’s sovereign-debt crisis will damp
demand for higher-yielding assets.  The South Pacific currencies fell, erasing earlier gains,
after a report showed the European Central Bank’s balance sheet
soared to a record after it lent regional banks more money last
week to keep credit flowing. The currencies had gained earlier
as stocks advanced.  “There’s zero liquidity in the market and there’s zero
appetite for risk taking,” said  Sebastien Galy , a senior
foreign-exchange strategist at Societe Generale SA in London.  New Zealand’s dollar fell 0.6 percent to 76.79 U.S. cents
at 11:40 a.m. in  New York . It earlier gained as much as 0.7
percent. The kiwi weakened 0.5 percent to 59.89 yen, having
reached 60.63 on Dec. 23, the highest level since Dec. 8.  The Australian dollar dropped 0.7 percent to $1.0085 after
rising as much as 0.5 percent. It depreciated 0.6 percent to
78.66 yen.  The ECB’s balance sheet expanded to a record 2.73 trillion
euros ($3.55 trillion). Lending to euro-area banks jumped 214
billion euros to 879 billion euros in the week ended Dec. 23,
the Frankfurt-based ECB said in a statement today.  The balance sheet increased by 239 billion euros in the
latest period and was 553 billion euros more than three months
ago.  The  MSCI World Index (MXWO)  of equities fell 1.3 percent after
earlier gaining as much as 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
