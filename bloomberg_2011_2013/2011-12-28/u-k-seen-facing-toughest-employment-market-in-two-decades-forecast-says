Britain faces the “toughest” job
market in two decades with the number of working people likely
to fall by 120,000 in 2012, the Chartered Institute of Personnel
and Development said.  “The U.K. jobs market will be weaker than at any time
since the recession of the early 1990s,” John Philpott, chief
economic adviser at the CIPD, an association for human-resource
professionals, said in a statement. “The combination of
worsening job shortages for people without work, mounting job
insecurity and a further fall in real earnings for those in work
may test the resilience and resolve of the U.K. workforce far
more than it did in the recession of 2008-9.”  The number of people out of work will reach 2.85 million by
the end of 2012, with the  unemployment rate  rising to 8.8
percent, the CIPD said. Government measures to boost youth
employment and to get the long-term jobless back to work may
help the targeted populations, though won’t have a net effect on
total employment, it said.  British unemployment rose to a 17-year high in the three
months through October, with 2.64 million people out of work and
a jobless rate of 8.3 percent, the  Office for National
Statistics  said earlier this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
