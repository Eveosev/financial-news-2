New York gasoline strengthened to
its highest level in three weeks as  Petroplus Holdings AG  said
it may begin shutting a refinery in  France  amid a credit freeze
restricting crude supply for the plant.  The 161,800-barrel-a-day Petit Couronne refinery may be
forced to stop operations on Jan. 2 along with other plants in
Europe, Laurent Patinier, a CFDT union representative, said
today by phone. Lower gasoline production could restrict fuel
imports to the U.S. East Coast.  Conventional gasoline  to be blended with ethanol, or CBOB,
in New York Harbor rose 0.63 cent to a 50 cent premium versus
gasoline futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at
3:56 p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s the
strongest differential since Dec. 6. Prompt delivery fell 3.13
cents to $2.6563 a gallon.  Workers at Petit Couronne have voted to begin a strike
today that will block deliveries of oil products, while allowing
refinery operations to continue, Patinier said.  Petroplus management indicated that talks with creditors
have encountered hurdles and the company’s four other plants in
 Europe  may also be progressively stopped, Patinier said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
