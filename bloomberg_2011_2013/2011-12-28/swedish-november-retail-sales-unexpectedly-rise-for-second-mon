Swedish  retail sales  unexpectedly
rose for a second consecutive month in November as unemployment
declined.  Seasonally adjusted sales gained a  monthly  0.8 percent,
after rising 0.4 percent the prior month, Stockholm-based
 Statistics Sweden  said today. The  median estimate  of five
economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for a 0.3 percent drop.
Sales increased an annual 0.7 percent and dropped a revised 0.6
percent in October.  “The outlook for 2012 is unfortunately not that upbeat,”
said Mikael Sarwe, an analyst at Nordea Bank AB, in a note. “A
slowing labour market will weigh on  household income  and fiscal
policy will not provide support.”  Swedish  consumer confidence  this month held near the lowest
since 2009 as European leaders struggle to contain the region’s
debt crisis. Unemployment last month fell 6.7 percent from 7.1
percent a year earlier as an expansion in the largest Nordic
economy continued to generate jobs.  The krona rose 0.2 percent to 8.9408 per euro and 0.1
percent to 6.8443 against the dollar as of 9:50 a.m. in
 Stockholm .  The Nordic country’s central bank on Dec. 20 cut its
benchmark repo rate for the first time since 2009 as growth
prospects weakened on slowing demand for Swedish goods. The bank
also predicted it would probably leave rates unchanged over the
next year.  Borrowing Slows  Household borrowing slowed for a 14th month in November,
data released by the statistics office also showed today.
Borrowing growth was an annual 5.3 percent last month, compared
with 5.5 percent the previous month. That was the smallest gain
in at least nine years and down from a 2010 peak of 9.3 percent.  “Stock market declines have sharply eroded household
wealth and the housing market has cooled off,” Sarwe said.
“Heightened uncertainties overall also reduce consumers
willingness to spend. The odds are stacked against households.”  The National Institute of  Economic Research  last week cut
its growth forecast for the Swedish economy next year to 0.6
percent, and predicted unemployment will rise to 7.8 percent
next year and to 7.9 percent in 2013 from 7.5 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
