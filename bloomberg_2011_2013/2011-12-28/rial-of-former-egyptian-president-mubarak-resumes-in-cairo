The trial of former Egyptian
President  Hosni Mubarak  on charges that include conspiring to
kill some of the protesters who ended his rule resumed today
after a three-month break, state media reported.  State television showed a helicopter carrying Mubarak, 83,
to the police academy in Cairo that houses the makeshift court
where he is being tried. In previous sessions, Mubarak appeared
in court on a gurney.  Mubarak’s trial began on Aug. 3 after pressure from
demonstrators demanding a swift and public prosecution of the
man they blame for corruption, political repression and police
abuses. At least 846 people were killed during the anti-Mubarak
revolt which started in January. He has pleaded not guilty.  The court has heard testimony from prosecution witnesses
and, in closed sessions, from current and former officials,
including the head of the ruling military council, Field Marshal
Mohamed Hussein Tantawi and former Vice President  Omar Suleiman .
Some Egyptians have said they hoped the officials’ testimony may
shed light on Mubarak’s actions during the uprising and what
orders he may have given for dealing with demonstrators.  The trial had been postponed until a court decision on a
request to change the judge trying Mubarak. Earlier this month a
court ruled that Judge Ahmed Refaat should stay on the case and
fined the lawyer who brought the case.  Mubarak’s two sons, Alaa and Gamal, who are facing
corruption charges, and former Interior Minister Habib el-Adli
and six of his aides are also on trial alongside the former
president.  To contact the reporter on this story:
