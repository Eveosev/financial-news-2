New York City  homicides this year
will total “slightly more than” 500, the third fewest since
record-keeping began five decades ago, Mayor  Michael Bloomberg 
said today.  The city had 502 killings as of this morning, according to
 Marc LaVorgna , a mayoral spokesman. The record low was 471 in
2009; second lowest was 499 in 2007, according to police
statistics.  New York recorded 536 homicides last year, according to the
police department’s  website . Before 2002, the city hadn’t
experienced fewer than 600 murders since the early 1960s, the
mayor’s office said in a statement. Record-keeping began in
1963.  “New York City closes out the safest decade in recorded
city history,” Bloomberg said at a City Hall news conference
today. The police and fire departments “continued a remarkable
and history-making trend, even working under tight budget
constraints,” he said.  Low crime and fire-death rates have contributed to the
growth of the city’s population to a record 8.4 million, record
life-expectancy rates and an all-time high of more than 50
million tourists in 2011, Bloomberg said. The combination gave
the city “an economic recovery far more robust than other areas
of the country have seen,” the mayor said.  By contrast,  Chicago  had 432 murders in 2010, according to
the FBI. Its population is 2.69 million, according to the
census.  Los Angeles , with a population of 3.69 million, had 293
homicides.  Body Count  The bloodiest year in New York history was 1990, when 2,245
people were killed at the height of the crack cocaine epidemic,
said Andrew Karmen, a sociology professor at the  John Jay
College of Criminal Justice  in  Manhattan . Homicide has been on a
20-year decline, with most of the progress made in the 1990s,
said Karmen, author of a 2000 book on the subject called “New
York Murder Mystery.” At the end of the 1990s, the body count
had dropped to about 680, he said.  “Nobody knows for sure why this has happened,” Karmen
said.  While the decline in the  murder rate  is sharper in New York
than in the U.S. as a whole, reasons other than more efficient
and tougher policing may be at work, Karmen said.  What makes New York different from other cities is that a
bigger proportion of its young people attend college, Karmen
said. The  City University  of New York has more than 480,000
students.  ‘Different Lifestyle’  “They might be taking remedial courses at community
colleges of CUNY or they might be studying at Columbia,” he
said. “Students between 18 and 24 who are taking courses at
colleges lead a very different lifestyle than other 18-to-24-
year-olds,” who are at the highest risk of being murdered.  Major crime in 2011 was up 0.4 percent because a change in
the state’s criminal law expanded the definition of felony
assault, LaVorgna said. Under the old formula, major crime would
have decreased 1.2 percent, the 21st-straight annual drop.  This year’s 64 fire deaths were the second lowest, above
last year’s 62, the mayor said.  Since 2002, there has been an average of 88 fire deaths per
year, according to a city statement. In the decade before 2002,
 New York  averaged 140 fire deaths per year, the release said.  “Fires and fire death are at or near historic lows, and
response times for both fire and EMS are the fastest ever,”
said Fire Commissioner Salvatore Cassano in the statement.  The mayor is founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News
parent Bloomberg LP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
