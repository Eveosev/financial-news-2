(Corrects scope of bond rise in first paragraph.)  Israel ’s benchmark bonds rose for
the first time in four days on speculation the central bank will
resume  interest-rate  cuts in coming months as growth slows.  The yield on the benchmark 5.5 percent notes due in January
2022 declined two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to
4.53 percent at 2:19 p.m. in Tel Aviv. Two-year interest rate
swaps, an indicator of investor expectations for rates over the
period, rose one basis point to 2.53 percent.  “The market was surprised the central bank did not cut
rates but the central bank lowered its growth forecast and the
rate cuts will continue,” Effi Cohen, a trader at Leader
Capital Markets Ltd. in Tel Aviv said by telephone.  The  Bank of Israel  held its benchmark interest rate at 2.75
percent on Dec. 26 after reducing it twice in three months,
saying policy makers wanted to be able to react to future
developments. The bank lowered its 2012  growth  forecast to 2.8
percent from a September prediction of 3.2 percent, citing the
European debt crisis.  The yield on the consumer price-linked bonds due June 2013
increased three basis points to 0.79 percent. The two-year
break-even rate, the yield difference between the inflation-
linked bonds and fixed-rate government bonds of similar
maturity, declined four points to 189, implying an average
annual inflation rate of 1.89 percent.  The  Tel Aviv Bond 40 Index , which measures inflation-linked
and fixed-rate corporate bonds, rose 0.1 percent to 257.78.  The shekel weakened for the first time in four days,
dropping 0.5 percent against the dollar to 3.7942.  “We see local importers buying dollars,” said Rony Gitlin, a spot trader at Bank Leumi Le-Israel Ltd. in  Tel Aviv .
“This is the last week of the year and offshore banks and  hedge
funds  are out of the game.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
