Spain ’s Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy 
plans to freeze the minimum wage in 2012 at his second Cabinet
meeting on Dec. 30, according to Comisiones Obreras, or CCOO,
one of the country’s two largest labor unions.  CCOO was informed of the decision in a letter from the
Labor Ministry received today, Ramon Gorriz, a national-level
secretary of the Madrid-based union, said by telephone.  “Penalizing consumption is not going to help us exit the
crisis,” Gorriz said.  The minimum wage in Spain is currently 641.40 euros a month
or 21.38 euros a day. Last year, Spain’s Socialists, beaten by
Rajoy’s People’s Party in a national election on Nov. 20,
increased the  minimum wage  by 1.3 percent.  A spokeswoman for the Labor Ministry, who declined to be
identified in line with government policy, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
