The following is a roundup of soccer
stories from U.K. newspapers, with clickable links to the Web.  Berbatov for Bayer  Bayer Leverkusen wants to re-sign striker Dimitar Berbatov
from  Manchester United  and has already been in contact with the
Bulgarian’s representative,  the Daily Mail reported .  Berbatov, 30, has struggled for a regular spot with United
and is out of contract at the end of the season, the newspaper
said.  He spent five years with Leverkusen before joining
Tottenham in 2006 and “the club is still very dear to him,”
the Mail cited Berbatov’s agent Ivan Dobrinov as saying.  United to City  Manchester City is among clubs interested in signing
teenagers Ravel Morrison and Paul Pogba from United if they fail
to agree to new contracts at Old Trafford,  according to the
Express.   Morrison and Pogba, both 18, only have deals until the end
of this season, but United would be entitled to compensation for
development costs as they’re under 24, the newspaper said.  Spurs Want Samba  Tottenham is considering a move for Blackburn center-back
Chris Samba during next month’s transfer window, with top target
 Gary Cahill  of Bolton set to join Chelsea,  the Mail said .  Blackburn is reluctant to sell Samba, although it may be
able to raise 10 million pounds ($15.7 million) to strengthen
the squad, the newspaper said. Rovers are looking to sign
players including Manchester City’s Nedum Onuoha and Fulham’s
Andy Johnson, the Mail added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
