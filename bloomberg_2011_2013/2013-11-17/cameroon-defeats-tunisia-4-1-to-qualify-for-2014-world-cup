Cameroon beat Tunisia 4-1 to become
the third African nation to qualify for next year’s soccer  World
Cup  in Brazil.  Two goals from Jean Makoun and one each from Pierre Webo
and Benjamin Moukandjo secured Cameroon’s victory in Yaounde
yesterday. The teams’ first game in the two-match playoff in
African qualifying was scoreless.  Cameroon advanced to the four-yearly global championship
for the seventh time and joins Nigeria and  Ivory Coast , who won
their playoffs two days ago, at next year’s 32-team tournament.  The final two berths from Africa will be determined
tomorrow when Ghana takes a 6-1 lead into its match against
Egypt and  Burkina Faso  visits  Algeria  with 3-2 advantage from
last month’s opener.  If Ghana and Algeria advance, it will mean all five African
qualifiers from the 2010 World Cup will make a repeat appearance
in Brazil next year. The group-stage draw takes place Dec. 6.  Webo and Moukandjo put Cameroon 2-0 ahead by halftime in
Yaounde. Ahmed Akaichi got a goal back for the visiting team
four minutes into the second half before Makoun struck twice to
seal the victory.  Nigeria beat Ethiopia 2-0 to complete a 4-1 victory over
the two-game series and will make its fifth World Cup
appearance. Ivory Coast qualified for its third straight World
Cup with a 4-2 aggregate score after a 1-1 draw with  Senegal .  To contact the reporter on this story:
