Jimmie Johnson secured his sixth
Sprint Cup Series auto racing championship in eight years with a
ninth-place finish in Nascar’s season-ending race at Homestead-Miami Speedway.  Johnson, 38, is one season title away from tying Richard Petty and the late Dale Earnhardt for the most championships at
Nascar’s top level. Johnson, who captured a record five straight
Sprint Cup Series titles from 2006 through 2010, had six race
wins this season along with 24 top-10 finishes.  “I have six. We’ll see if I can get seven,” Johnson said
after last night’s race. “Time will tell. I think we need to
save the argument until I hang up the helmet.”  Johnson needed to finish 23rd or better in yesterday’s
EcoBoost 400 to claim the championship and ran among the top 10
for most of the 400-mile race, which was won by Denny Hamlin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
