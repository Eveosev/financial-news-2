Banks need to pay closer attention
to anti-money-laundering controls in companies they’re acquiring
to ensure the lenders don’t inherit Bank Secrecy Act risks,
according to Comptroller of the Currency Thomas Curry.  “Some institutions have inherited significant BSA problems
from the acquired institution, so it’s vital that due diligence
in an acquisition go beyond credit portfolios to include a look
at the target institution’s BSA program,” Curry said in remarks
prepared for a conference about money-laundering enforcement
today in  Washington .  Curry, who said his agency has had to make money-laundering
protections a focus, fined London-based HSBC Holdings Plc $500
million last year, a record penalty from a bank regulator, he
has said. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency often
discovers “insufficient staffing, high turnover rates, and
cutbacks in spending on compliance” that he said are
“unacceptable” management breaches.  In April, the Federal Reserve cited Bank Secrecy Act
concerns at Buffalo-based M&T Bank Corp. in halting the lender’s
acquisition of Hudson City Bancorp. While M&T reached a deal in
June with regulators on improving compliance, the intervention
jeopardized a Jan. 31 deadline for completing the $3.7 billion
acquisition, the company has said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
