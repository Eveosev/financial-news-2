Brazil’s  central bank  President
Alexandre Tombini didn’t see any shortage of foreign currency in
the country’s  spot market  in the week the real declined to a
two-month low.  The nation and other  emerging markets  face a “sell-off”
because of “interest rate normalization” in advanced
economies, Tombini said in a  speech  delivered in Santiago on the
evening of Nov. 15 and published on the Central Bank of Brazil’s
website yesterday. The world’s second-biggest emerging economy
after China is “providing currency hedge for the private
sector” with an $100-billion intervention program for 2013,
Tombini said.  Brazil’s real has fallen 5 percent since Oct. 31, when the
government said its  budget deficit   widened  to the largest in
almost four years on concern about a credit rating downgrade. On
Nov. 13, the currency dropped to 2.3341 per dollar, the weakest
since Sept. 4.  “There is no foreign currency shortage in the domestic
spot market, which the Central Bank monitors continually,”
Tombini said. “At the Central Bank of Brazil, we responded to
the change in global financing conditions in a classical
fashion, through policy tightening, exchange rate flexibility
and using accumulated buffers to reduce volatility.”  Emerging-markets countries, including Brazil, China and
India, face a challenge as they “continue country-specific
structural reforms and growth model adaption” while they
“maintain financial and price stability,” Tombini said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
