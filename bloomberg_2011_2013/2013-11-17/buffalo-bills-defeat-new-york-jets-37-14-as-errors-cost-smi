The Denver Broncos knocked off the
last undefeated team in the National Football League, beating
the Kansas City Chiefs 27-17 even though Peyton Manning was held
to a season-low one touchdown pass.  It was the first loss in 10 games for the Chiefs, who had
started 9-0 for the first time since 2003 yet hadn’t faced an
opponent with a winning record before last night.  Rookie running back Montee Ball rushed for two touchdowns
for the Broncos (9-1), who matched the Chiefs for the best
record in the American Football Conference’s West Division. The
teams will meet again on Dec. 1 in Kansas City.  “We’re going to enjoy this one,” Manning, who passed for
323 yards and wasn’t sacked by a Chiefs’ defense that led the
NFL with 36 quarterback sacks entering Week 11. “We put a lot
of work into this game preparing for these guys.”  The Broncos set an NFL record by scoring 25 or more points
for a 15th straight game and became the first team to put up
more than 17 points against the Chiefs this season. Manning, who
threw for a record-tying 33 touchdowns in Denver’s first nine
games, got his lone score last night on a 9-yard pass to Julius
Thomas in the first quarter.  The New York Giants beat the Green Bay Packers 27-13 to
become the second NFL franchise to win four straight games after
an 0-6 start, while the New York Jets (5-5) lost to the Buffalo
Bills 37-14 to become the first team in league history to
alternate wins and defeats through their first 10 games.  The Giants (4-6) had three interceptions of Packers third-string quarterback Scott Tolzien, including one that was
returned 24 yards for a touchdown by defensive lineman  Jason Pierre-Paul  in East Rutherford, New Jersey.  NFC East  New York remains 1 1/2 games out of first place in the
National Football Conference’s East Division, as the
Philadelphia Eagles improved to 6-5 by beating the Washington
Redskins 24-16 to snap a 10-game home losing streak. The Giants
next face the Dallas Cowboys (5-5), who were off this week.  “We’ve still got some digging to get back out of the hole
that we made for ourselves,” said Giants quarterback Eli Manning, who threw for 279 yards, including a 26-yard touchdown
pass to Reuben Randle. “We’ve got four in a row. That’s a good
feeling and we’re going to keep fighting.”  Jets rookie quarterback Geno Smith threw three
interceptions and also lost a fumble before being replaced by
Matt Simms in the fourth quarter in Buffalo. Even with the
letdown after a bye week, the Jets remain in the thick of the
AFC playoff race, as outside of the AFC West, the other three
division-leaders are the only teams with winning records.  Failed Execution  “We had two weeks to prepare, we thought we were prepared,
had some great practices, and we just didn’t execute,” Jets
coach Rex Ryan told reporters. “Simple as that. And you have to
give credit to Buffalo.”  The New Orleans Saints defeated the San Francisco 49ers
23-20 on Garrett Hartley’s third field goal of the fourth
quarter, a 31-yarder as time expired. The Saints improved to 8-2
with the home win while the 49ers fell to 6-4 with a second loss
in a row following a five-game win streak.  The Pittsburgh Steelers rallied for a 37-27 win over
 Detroit , holding the Lions scoreless in the second half while
getting 367 passing yards and four touchdowns from Ben Roethlisberger.  The Lions dropped into a share of the lead with the  Chicago 
Bears in the National Football Conference North division, with
both teams at 6-4. The Bears won 23-20 in overtime against the
Baltimore Ravens (4-6) in a game that was suspended for one
hour, 53 minutes because of the threat of a tornado in the area
around Soldier Field in Chicago.  Winning Kick  Robbie Gould kicked a 38-yard field goal on the second
possession of overtime to seal the win for Chicago.  Marshawn Lynch scored three touchdowns as the Seattle
Seahawks improved to a league-best 10-1 with a 41-20 rout of the
Minnesota Vikings.  In yesterday’s other games, it was Miami 20, San Diego 16;
Cincinnati 41, Cleveland 20; Oakland 28, Houston 23; Tampa Bay
41, Atlanta 28; and  Arizona  27, Jacksonville 14.  The Week 11 schedule began Nov. 14 with the Indianapolis
Colts (7-3) winning 30-27 at the Tennessee Titans (4-6).  The 2009 Titans had been the only team to follow an 0-6
start to the season with a four-game winning streak. The Giants
matched that yesterday by sending the Packers (5-5) to a third
straight loss.  New York opened a 20-6 lead on Green Bay, which was without
starting quarterback Aaron Rodgers because of a broken
collarbone. After the Packers pulled within 20-13 early in the
fourth quarter, Pierre-Paul jumped to intercept a pass from
Tolzien and returned it 24 yards for a touchdown.  ‘Huge Momentum’  “I gave him a freebie there, really,” Tolzien said. “It
was a huge momentum swing. We had a chance at that point and
that kills you.”  In Philadelphia, the Eagles got two rushing touchdowns from
LeSean McCoy and one from quarterback Nick Foles in opening a
24-0 lead before holding off a fourth-quarter rally by the
Redskins (3-7).  The Saints outgained the 49ers 387-196 in New Orleans, yet
needed field goals on their final three drives to pull out their
first win in the past three meetings with San Francisco.  The win means New Orleans will stay at least one game ahead
of Carolina in the NFC South. The Panthers (6-3) take a five-game winning streak into tonight’s home game against the AFC
East-leading New England Patriots (7-2).  To contact the reporter on this story:
