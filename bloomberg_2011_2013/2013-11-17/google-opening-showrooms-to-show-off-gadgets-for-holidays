Google Inc.  is opening showrooms in six U.S. cities, promoting its latest products and stepping up retail efforts against  Apple Inc.  and  Microsoft Corp.  as the year-end holiday shopping season gets under way.  Called Winter Wonderlabs, the outlets feature products such as Nexus 7 tablets, Chromebook computers and Chromecast video-streaming devices, the company said on a  new website  yesterday. Consumers can order the gadgets online after looking at the wares. The stores also feature a large snow globe that lets customers take videos of themselves, complete with fake snow.  The operator of the world’s most-popular search engine is investing more resources to bolster its position in hardware and joins  Intel Corp.  this year in  rolling out  showrooms to promote products. Microsoft has  opened  almost 50 stores after Apple found success with its retail outlets, where customers can purchase iPhones, iPads and Macs and also learn more about using the devices.  “The Winter Wonderlab is a fun and interactive way to experience all of Google’s new gadgets in one place,” the company said on the website.

The company is also building a barge in San Francisco Bay aimed at showing off new technologies.
