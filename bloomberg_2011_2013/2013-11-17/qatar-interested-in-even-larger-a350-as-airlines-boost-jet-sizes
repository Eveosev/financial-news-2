Qatar Airways  Ltd. said it would
consider buying an even larger version of the Airbus SAS A350
wide-body jet than currently on offer, as the No. 2 Middle
Eastern airline tilts its fleet toward bigger aircraft.  The Doha-based carrier would be interested in a variant
that stretches beyond the A350-1000, the largest of the three-member family of A350s for sale, Chief Executive Officer Akbar Al Baker told journalists today in Dubai at the biennial air
show. Qatar may also switch from some of its mid-sized A350-900
models into the larger type, he said.  “If they extend the size and stretch the airplane, Qatar
Airways will be very interested in placing additional orders,”
 Al Baker  said after announcing a purchase of A330 freighters.  Qatar, the launch customer for the A350, has already
dropped orders for 20 of the smallest versions for larger ones.
Al Baker, an early critic of the program, said today he was
impressed with the progress that Airbus has made in the last two
years on the A350, which performed its maiden flight in 2013.  Airbus has said it’s not currently working on an even
larger version of its A350, while maintaining that it would be
technically possible. The A350-1000 is aimed at taking business
from  Boeing Co. (BA) ’s popular 777, whose upgraded 777X model became
the bestseller on the first day of the Dubai Air show, including
50 orders from Qatar. The smaller A350 models compete with the
787 Dreamliner.  To contact the reporters on this story:
