A French hostage held for almost a
year in Nigeria by Islamist extremists has been freed, according
to  France ’s government.  President Francois Hollande lauded Nigerian authorities for
their “decisive action” to secure the release of Francis
Collomp, who had been held in captivity since Dec. 20, 2012, the
presidency said in a statement posted on the elysee.fr website.  Ansaru, a splinter group of Boko Haram, had claimed
responsibility for the kidnapping of the French engineer who had
been working for turbine manufacturer Vergnet SA on a wind-energy project in the town of Rimi in northern Nigeria, when
gunmen stormed his home.  Ansaru, whose full name is Jamaatu Anrul Muslimina Fi
Biladissudan, or “Vanguards for the Protection of Muslims in
the Land of the Blacks,” had said it took the hostages as a
response to the “atrocities done to the religion of Allah” by
European nations.  Several French kidnappings have occurred in the region
since France sent troops in  Mali  to fight Islamists and rebel
forces that had taken control of northern Mali, a nation that
vies with Tanzania as  Africa ’s third-biggest gold producer.  “This much anticipated news will not make us forget that
seven of our nationals are still held hostage in Syria, Mali and
Nigeria,” according to the government statement, which said
France will continue to work toward their freedom.  Chris Olukolade, a spokesman for Nigeria’s defense
ministry, declined to comment on Collomp’s release, as did
Nigerian national police spokesman Frank Mba.  To contact the reporter on this story:
