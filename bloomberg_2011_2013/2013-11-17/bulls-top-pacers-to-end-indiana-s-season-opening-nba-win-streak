Luol Deng  scored 23 points as the
Chicago Bulls won 110-94, ending the Indiana Pacers’ nine-game
winning streak opening to the National Basketball Association
season.  Indiana (9-1) 9-0 record was the best season start since
the 2002-03 Dallas Mavericks went 14-0.  Derrick Rose, recovering from a sore right hamstring,
scored 20 points and Taj Gibson had 15 points last night for the
Bulls (5-3), who owned a 60-35 halftime lead on their home court
at the United Center in Chicago.  “We got off to a good start,” Bulls coach Tom Thibodeau
told reporters. “(The Pacers) missed some shots that they
usually make. Overall, I thought it was a good win. We played
very unselfishly.”  Roy Hibbert  had 14 points for the Pacers and  Paul George 
added 12 points.  The Pacers shot 40 percent from the floor and 78.6 percent
from the free-throw line while the Bulls sank half their field
goal attempts and 79.2 percent of their foul shots.  To contact the reporter on this story:
