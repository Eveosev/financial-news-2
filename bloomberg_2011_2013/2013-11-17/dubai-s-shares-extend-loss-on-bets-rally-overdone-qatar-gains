Dubai’s  benchmark stock index  fell,
extending the declines of the past two weeks, on concern this
year’s rally may be overdone. Shares in Qatar rose.  The  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  lost 0.4 percent to 2,813.1 at the
close in the emirate, paring the gain for the year to 73
percent.  Deyaar Development PJSC (DEYAAR) , a builder of residential
towers in the emirate, declined for a fifth time in six days.
Investment bank  Shuaa Capital PSC (SHUAA)  retreated to its lowest in
more than a month and  Dubai Investments PJSC (DIC)  dropped 1.4
percent. Qatar’s QE Index climbed 0.7 percent and Israel’s  TA-25
Index (TA-25)  advanced 0.9 percent at the close in Tel Aviv.  Dubai’s benchmark index is among the five best-performing
gauges tracked by Bloomberg globally this year as the emirate’s
real-estate industry rebounds from a more than 60 percent
decline in home prices. A decision on Dubai’s bid to host the
World Expo in 2020 will be announced Nov. 27, with investors
expecting a win to boost economic activity. Dubai’s measure
trades at an estimated price-to-earnings multiple of 14.6
compared with 11.7 for the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index.  “Dubai’s gains for the year have been substantial, so it’s
no surprise to see some investors book their gains ahead of an
event like the Expo 2020 decision,” Amer Khan, a director at
Dubai-based Shuaa Asset Management which had 780 million dirhams
($212 million) under management at the end of September, said by
e-mail. “Some others may choose to wait before deploying
further capital.”  Expo Expansion  Deyaar declined 1.6 percent, the most in almost a week, to
68.5 fils and Shuaa, a bank controlled by Dubai’s ruler, dropped
3.6 percent to 89 fils. Dubai Investments, which owns stakes in
more than 40 companies, slid to 2.1 dirhams.  Dubai’s economy, the second-biggest among the seven
sheikhdoms that make up the U.A.E., is set to expand an average
4.6 percent a year between 2012 and 2015, more than twice the
rate of the previous four years, according to government
forecasts. Annual economic growth will be boosted by about 0.5
percentage points in the run-up to the Expo and by about 2
percentage points during the event should Dubai be selected,
Bank of America Merrill Lynch said Sept. 23.  Abu Dhabi’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  fell 0.1 percent, while
Oman’s benchmark was little changed. Kuwait’s index gained 0.1
percent and Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul All Share Index increased 0.8
percent.  Egypt ’s benchmark EGX 30 Index climbed 0.8 percent, rising
after two days of losses. Upper Egypt Contracting Co. was the
biggest gainer, jumping 7 percent.  Standard & Poor’s raised Egypt to B- from CCC+ on Nov. 15,
citing reduced pressure on balance of payments because of
foreign aid. Pro- and anti-government groups have called for
rallies on Nov. 19, the second anniversary of clashes between
protesters and security forces that left dozens dead.  Coffee Exit  In Tel Aviv,  Israel Chemicals Ltd. (ICL)  advanced 3.5 percent to
30.12 shekels and Strauss Group Ltd. gained 2.4 percent after
daily TheMarker reported the company has picked bankers for the
sale of its coffee unit. A spokeswoman for Strauss said there
was no decision on the matter yet.  The yield on  Israel ’s benchmark bonds due March 2023
slipped one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.53
percent. Israeli economic growth slowed more than expected to
2.2 percent in the third quarter as industrial exports and
tourism fell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
