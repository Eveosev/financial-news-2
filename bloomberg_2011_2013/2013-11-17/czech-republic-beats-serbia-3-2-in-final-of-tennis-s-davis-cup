Radek Stepanek  defeated Dusan
Lajovic in straight sets as the  Czech Republic  retained tennis’s
Davis Cup with a 3-2 victory over Serbia in the final.  Stepanek won 6-3, 6-1, 6-1 in the deciding match in
Belgrade. It was the second straight year that Stepanek won the
decisive fifth match in the final, having beaten defending
champion Spain’s Nicolas Almagro last year.  “I don’t think words can describe it, to win two Davis
Cups is my greatest achievement,” Stepanek said in a televised
interview. “To defend this trophy means the world for us and
our country. We played in Serbia, on their surface, in front of
their fantastic crowd, we made history today.”  The Czechs held a 2-1 lead going into today’s play. World
No. 2 Novak Djokovic leveled the scores with a 6-4, 7-6 (7-5),
6-2 victory over Tomas Berdych.  As well as in 2012, the Czech Republic previously won the
competition, the top team event in men’s tennis, as part of the
former Czechoslovakia in 1980. Serbia won the trophy in 2010.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
