Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg
said the coalition government should raise the amount workers in
the U.K. can earn before paying income tax to 10,500 pounds
($16,925) a year.  The  threshold , which is due to rise to 10,000 pounds in
April 2014, should increase by a further 500 pounds a year later
to help people on low incomes, the Liberal Democrat leader said.
He called for an announcement to be made in the 2014 budget.  “We need to go further because as the recovery is finally
taking hold it’s very important that as many people as possible
feel they are benefitting,” Clegg told BBC Television’s
“Andrew Marr Show” program today. It would deliver a tax break
“for millions of people who are working hard and seeking to
make ends meet,” he said.  Clegg and Prime MinisterDavid Cameron have steadily raised
the threshold from 6,475 pounds since taking office in 2010 to
its current level of 9,440 pounds. If adopted, Clegg’s proposal
would take effect a month before the next general election.  It would cut 100 pounds a year from the tax bill of people
earning more than 10,500 pounds and remove about 500,000 more
people from taxation altogether, Clegg said. The cost to the
Treasury would be about 1 billion pounds a year, he said.  Clegg said the proposal had not been agreed with Cameron,
whose Conservative Party opposes Liberal Democrat calls for a
“mansion tax” on the most expensive homes. The two parties
could find other ways to pay for a higher income-tax threshold,
including a further clampdown on tax avoidance, Clegg said.  The announcement comes as Chancellor of the Exchequer
George Osborne prepares to announce his Autumn Statement to
Parliament on Dec. 5.  Wages Lag  The cost of living has become the focal point of British
politics, with consumer prices continuing to increase about
three times faster than wages. Clegg’s electoral pitch aims to
convince voters that another coalition is desirable and viable,
as his party is unlikely to ever command power on its own.  The opposition Labour Party leads the Conservatives by 35
percent to 29 percent, with the Liberal Democrats on 10 percent,
according to the latest  ComRes Ltd. poll . The survey questioned
2,023 adults between Nov. 13 and Nov. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
