Paul Flowers, the former chairman of
Co-Operative Bank Plc, has been suspended as a Methodist
minister following drug allegations in a Sunday newspaper.  The Methodist Church of Britain said in a  statement  on its
website today that Flowers, who was named chairman of the bank
in March 2010 and was replaced in June this year, has been
suspended from his duties for three weeks pending an
investigation. The church will also work with the police if it
is considered that a crime has been committed, it said.  The Mail on Sunday  said  Flowers was filmed in his car
buying illegal drugs in Leeds, northern  England , days after his
appearance before Parliament’s Treasury Select Committee on Nov.
6 over the bank’s performance.  Flowers, 63, has apologized in a statement issued through
the church.  “This year has been incredibly difficult, with a death in
the family and the pressures of my role with the Co-Operative
Bank,” Flowers said. “At the lowest point in this terrible
period, I did things that were stupid and wrong. I am sorry for
this and I am seeking professional help, and apologize to all I
have hurt or failed by my actions.”  Patrick Tooher, a spokesman for the bank, declined to
comment today on “allegations which are of a personal nature
and being made against a former board member.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
