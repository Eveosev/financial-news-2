The World Anti-Doping Agency
threatened to suspend  Russia ’s drug-testing center for the
Winter Olympics unless it moves to improve its procedures by
Dec. 1.  The Moscow laboratory faces a six-month suspension unless
it instigates a “comprehensive quality management program” to
ensure “the necessary confidence in the accuracy and
reliability of the results reported,” WADA said  in a statement .
The Winter Olympics take place in Sochi, Russia, from Feb. 7-23.  WADA said that although it’s not the responsible medical
authority during the Games, it “strongly suggests” that the
International Olympic Committee consider appropriate action to
ensure the integrity of the analysis carried out by the lab
“and/or its satellite in Sochi.”  The IOC said it’s “confident that all the necessary
measures will be taken and the Sochi lab will be fully
functioning during the Games.”  “The integrity of the Games-time testing program will
remain unaffected by these developments, indeed it will be
strengthened,” the IOC said in a statement cited by the
Associated Press.  Last week soccer’s governing body said it will use a Swiss
lab to test players at the 2014 World Cup in  Brazil  for doping
violations after a Rio de Janeiro medical facility failed to
regain WADA accreditation.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
