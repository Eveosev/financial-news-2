Harris English recorded a four-stroke victory in this this year’s final U.S. PGA Tour event,
the OHL Classic at Mayakoba in Playa del Carmen,  Mexico .  English, 24, shot a 6-under-par 65 during yesterday’s final
round at El Camaleon Golf Club for a four-round score of 21
under. Brian Stuard was second at 17-under par, one shot better
than Jason Bohn, Chris Stroud and Rory Sabbatini.  English received $1.08 million for his second victory in
his past 14 PGA Tour events. His breakthrough win came at last
season’s FedEx St. Jude Classic, where he finished two shots
ahead of Phil Mickelson. With yesterday’s win, English also
earns invitations to the Masters Tournament and the PGA
Championship, two of this season’s four major championships.  English and Rory McIlroy are the only current golfers under
the age of 25 with two or more PGA Tour wins.  The OHL Classic was the last of this year’s six events in
the PGA Tour’s new wraparound 2013-14 schedule. There’s now a
six-week break before the season resumes in January with the
traditional swing through  Hawaii  before moving to the U.S. West
Coast for six events in California and  Arizona .  To contact the reporter on this story:
