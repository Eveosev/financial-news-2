ABB Ltd. (ABBN)  could make acquisitions of
up to $8 billion over the next three years,  SonntagsZeitung 
reported, citing Chief Executive Officer  Joe Hogan .  While ABB doesn’t rule out another “megadeal” in the
current year following the $3.9 billion-dollar agreement to buy
Thomas & Betts Corp., acquisitions in the hundreds of millions
of dollars are more likely, Hogan was cited as saying.  ABB is interested in makers of products for process
automation such as sensors and gauges and the company regards
the low-voltage sphere in India as an area for expansion, the
Zurich-based newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
