Axa SA (CS) , Europe’s second largest
insurer, plans to expand in Asia and doesn’t rule out bidding
for  ING Groep NV (INGA) ’s Asian assets,  The Sunday Telegraph  said,
citing Chief Executive Officer Henri de Castries.  About 60 percent of the company’s activities are in Europe,
the U.S. and the rest of the world contributes about 20 percent
each, de Castries told the newspaper in an interview. Axa plans
to grow organically and doesn’t need to do acquisitions, de
Castries said, according to the Telegraph.  Contact the reporter on this story:
