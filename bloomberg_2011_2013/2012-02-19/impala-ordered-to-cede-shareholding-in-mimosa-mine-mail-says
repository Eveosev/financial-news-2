Zimbabwe’s government ordered  Impala
Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP)  to cede its shareholding in the Mimosa
Mining Co., state-controlled  Sunday Mail  reported, citing
indigenization minister, Saviour Kasukuwere.  Impala owns 24.5 percent of Mimosa mine, which is
controlled by Aquarius Platinum Ltd., the Harare-based newspaper
said. Impala also owns  Zimbabwe Platinum Ltd. (ZIM) , the country’s
biggest producer of the metal, the newspaper said.  The government wants Aquarius to own 49 percent of Mimosa
mine, with the remaining 51 percent owned by black Zimbabweans,
Kasukuwere told the Sunday Mail.  Calls to Kasukuwere and Mimosa mine weren’t answered when
Bloomberg News sought comment today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
