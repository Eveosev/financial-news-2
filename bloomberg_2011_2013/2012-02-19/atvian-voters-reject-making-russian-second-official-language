Latvians rejected a proposal to make
Russian the country’s second official language in a referendum
yesterday that saw voter turnout reach a record since
independence was regained in 1991.  About 75 percent of ballots cast were against adding
Russian, with 25 percent in support of the measure, according to
the  Central Election Committee  today, citing all 1,035
precincts. A total of  1,098,313  ballots were cast, compared with
 1,010,467  in a 2003 referendum in which Latvians backed joining
the European Union.  Latvia regained independence from the  Soviet Union  in 1991.
Most native Russian speakers were settled in the country by the
Soviet leadership after World War II, replacing Latvians who
died during Nazi and Soviet occupation, were deported, or fled
to the West.  The Russian community is 600,000, of which about one third
remain non-citizens, according to the Office of Citizenship and
Migration Affairs. Latvia’s total population is about 2 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
