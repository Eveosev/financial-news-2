The dollar and the yen fell versus
the euro amid investor optimism that European governments are
closing in on a deal to unlock a 130 billion-euro ($171 billion)
aid package for  Greece , crimping demand for haven assets.  The dollar fell to $1.3186 per euro as of 6:30 a.m. in
Tokyo from $1.3140 on Feb. 17 in  New York . The yen slid to 105
per euro from 104.54. The dollar bought 79.63 from 79.55.  To contact the reporter on this story:
