Oversupply in  China ’s  steel industry 
will continue in 2012, Maanshan Iron and Steel Co. General
Manager Su Jiangang told China Business News for a story
published today.  China cannot put in place economic stimulus measures
similar to those it enacted in 2008, CBN reported, citing an
interview with Su, who said he is “not optimistic” about the
demand growth for the steel industry.  Maanshan needs to improve its cost efficiency and expand
non-steel related businesses, Su said, according to the report.
The company is looking into making high-speed rail wheels, the
report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
