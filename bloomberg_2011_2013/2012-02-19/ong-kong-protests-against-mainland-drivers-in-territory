About 300 demonstrators marched in
 Hong Kong  today to protest a government proposal that may allow
mainland Chinese to drive their cars into the territory.  The demonstrators, who were escorted by police as they
walked from the Causeway Bay shopping district to government
headquarters in Tamar, said the proposal would cause traffic
jams, pollution and accidents if it goes into effect.  “It would be a nightmare if the government let mainland
Chinese drive in Hong Kong, because of the traffic accidents and
congestion,” said Shirley Cheung, who brought her eight-year-
old son to the demonstration.  While mainland Chinese are a growing  source of revenue  for
Hong Kong, they have also been blamed for pushing up housing
prices and raising costs at hospitals, where Chinese mothers
sometimes come to give birth. Tensions rose after a Peking
University professor called Hong Kong people “dogs” in January
and an anonymous group of Hong Kongers later took out a
newspaper advertisement likening mainlanders to locusts.  The government plan, which could go into effect next month,
will allow up to 50 Hong Kong cars to cross into  China ’s
Guangdong province each day, the  South China Morning Post 
reported yesterday. Talks would then consider allowing mainland
cars into Hong Kong, though no timetable has been set, the
newspaper said. Hong Kong was handed over from British to
Chinese control in 1997.  Radio Television Hong Kong  estimated that about 300 people
attended today’s protest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
