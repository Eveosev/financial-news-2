Avenue Capital Group and Golden Tree
Asset Management are planning to take over Travelodge Ltd as the
budget hotel chain looks to raise cash, the Sunday Times
reported, citing unidentified people close to the negotiations.  The budget hotel chain has six weeks to raise 60 million
pounds ($95 million) or it could face bankruptcy, the newspaper
said. Avenue Capital and Golden Tree have joined a third party,
potentially an investment bank, in the plan, according to the
newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
