A top aide to Israeli Prime Minister
 Benjamin Netanyahu  will resign in exchange for the dropping of
an investigation into allegations he sexually harassed a female
staff member, the Justice Ministry said.  Natan Eshel, Netanyahu’s chief of staff, agreed to admit to
taking “inappropriate” photos of the unidentified woman and
searching her private e-mails, the Justice Ministry said today
in an e-mailed statement.  He will receive a severe reprimand and won’t be allowed to
seek another government job, it said. Eshel has been on leave
since the allegations became public in late January.  Netanyahu had no immediate comment on the matter, spokesman
 Mark Regev  said in a telephone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
