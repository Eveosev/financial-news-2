Iran  and  Pakistan  agreed to invest
$718 million in a network for transmitting electricity from Iran
to its eastern neighbor,  Tehran Times  reported, citing Energy
Minister Majid Namjou.  Iran sells about 35 megawatts a day to Pakistan, and the
two countries want to boost supply to as much as 4,000
megawatts, the Tehran-based newspaper said. The Persian Gulf
countryâ€™s power exports will reach a total of some $1 billion in
the current Iranian year ending March 19, Deputy Energy Minister
Mohammad Behzad said, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
