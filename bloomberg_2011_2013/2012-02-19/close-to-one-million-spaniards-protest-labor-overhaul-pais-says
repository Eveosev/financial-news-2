Around one million people marched in
 Spain ’s capital and other main cities to protest against Prime
Minister  Mariano Rajoy ’s labor rules overhaul,  El Pais  reported,
citing the countries’ two main unions, CCOO and UGT.  “Spain needs to avoid being the European country that most
destroys jobs,” Rajoy said earlier today during a televised
speech at a People’s Party convention in Sevilla, in the south
of the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
