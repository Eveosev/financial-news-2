Suisse Group AG boosted their share-price estimates.  Billabong
International Ltd. (BBG)  jumped 8 percent in Sydney after the surfwear

maintaining growth rates, which will provide support for equity
investors,” said  Tim Schroeders , who helps manage $1 billion at
Pengana Capital Ltd. in Melbourne. “The timing is probably just
ahead of China committing to European bailout funds.”  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  climbed 0.8 percent to 128 as

percent.  Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  slid 0.3 percent, while China’s

world’s largest container carrier, said it will cut 9 percent of
its shipping capacity between Asia and Europe. The reduction is
