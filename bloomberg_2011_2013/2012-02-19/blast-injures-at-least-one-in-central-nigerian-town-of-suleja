Police are investigating a roadside
explosion outside a church today in central  Nigeria  which
injured at least five people.  The blast in Suleja, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) north
of the capital, Abuja, was detonated from an abandoned car
outside the Christ Embassy church this morning in the middle of
worship, police spokesman Richard Oguche said by telephone today
from the scene. He didn’t give details. No group has claimed
responsibility for the attack.  Authorities in  Africa ’s largest oil producer blame Boko
Haram, which calls for the imposition of Shariah law, for bomb
and gun attacks in northern Nigeria and Abuja since 2009. Boko
Haram, whose name means “Western education is a sin,” claimed
responsibility for multiple blasts and attacks in the city of
Kano on Jan. 20, killing at least 256 people, according to the
Civil Rights Congress.  Boko Haram, which draws inspiration from  Afghanistan ’s
Taliban movement, also claimed responsibility for a Dec. 25
bombing of a church which killed 43 people in Madala, about
eight kilometers from Suleja.  Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country of more than 164
million people, is roughly split between a mainly Muslim north
and predominantly Christian south. More than 14,000 people died
in ethnic and religious clashes in the West African nation
between 1999 and 2009, according to the Brussels-based
 International Crisis Group .  To contact the reporter on this story:
