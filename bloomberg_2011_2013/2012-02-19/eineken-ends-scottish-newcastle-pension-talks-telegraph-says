Heineken NV (HEIA) , the worldâ€™s third-
biggest brewer, ended negotiations over pensions with former
employees at its  Scottish & Newcastle (SCTN)  unit,  The Sunday Telegraph 
said, citing Chief Executive Officer Jean-Francois van Boxmeer.  Scottish & Newcastle pensioners claim Heineken reneged on a
promise made in 2008 when it bought the U.K. company to tie
annual pension payouts to the rate of inflation, the newspaper
said. Boxmeer said pensions increases had always been
discretionary, according to the interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
