Nigeria , Africa’s top oil producer,
plans to step up maritime security in the Gulf of Guinea to
fight piracy and protect the environment off its coast.  Africa’s most populous nation will increase offshore
patrols “considering the strategic economic significance of the
Gulf of Guinea” to Nigeria, Vice President Namadi Sambo said,
according to a statement dated yesterday on the Abuja-based
presidency’s  website .  A captain and chief engineer on a bulk carrier were shot
dead by pirates in the third attack of its kind off Nigeria’s
coast since Feb. 9, Cyrus Mody, a London-based manager at the
International Maritime Bureau, or IMB, said on Feb. 13.  Nigeria is the fifth-biggest source of U.S. imports.  Royal
Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , Exxon Mobil Corp.,  Chevron Corp. (CVX) ,  Total SA (FP)  and
 Eni SpA (ENI)  operate joint ventures with the state-owned Nigerian
National Petroleum Corp. that pump about 90 percent of the
country’s crude.  More than 20 ships were attacked last year off the coast of
Nigeria in the Gulf of Guinea, with pirates targeting mostly oil
product tankers to steal cargo, according to the IMB.  To contact the reporter on this story:
