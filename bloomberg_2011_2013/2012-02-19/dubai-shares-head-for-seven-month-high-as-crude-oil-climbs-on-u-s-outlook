Dubai’s shares surged the most in
almost a year on investor confidence debt-burdened companies in
the emirate will meet payment obligations without government
support and as quarterly earnings beat estimates.  Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , developer of the world’s tallest
skyscraper whose fourth-quarter profit topped expectations last
week, advanced the most in almost a month.  Dubai Islamic Bank
PJSC (DIB) , the United Arab Emirates’ biggest lender complying with
Shariah rules, rallied 3.3 percent. Dubai’s  DFM General Index (DFMGI) 
advanced 3.6 percent, the most since March 13, to 1,571.09 at
the 2 p.m. close in the emirate. The  Bloomberg GCC 200 (BGCC200)  Index
rose 0.8 percent.  There has been “increasing positive sentiment with Dubai
entities saying debt will be repaid without government
assistance,” said  Julian Bruce , director of institutional sales
trading at EFG-Hermes Holding SAE in Dubai. With “full-year
earnings looking much more healthy and some companies
recommencing dividend payments,” trading volume has also
improved, he said.  Dubai, which teetered on the brink of default in 2009,
expects two of its main companies to refinance $3.25 billion of
debt this year without government help as growth accelerates,
Mohammed Al Shaibani, director general of the Dubai ruler’s
court, said Feb. 15. Dubai has “no intention” of seeking
support from  Abu Dhabi , he said. Abu Dhabi gave $20 billion to
its neighbor in 2009 to help restructure debt.  Beating Estimates  Dubai economy’s may expand as much as 5 percent this year
after growing more than 3 percent in 2011, Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, the head of Dubai’s Supreme Fiscal Policy
Committee, said last week.  Emaar shares rallied 3.9 percent, the most since Jan. 25,
to 2.97 dirhams. The company with th e heaviest weighting  on
Dubai’s index said on Feb. 14 fourth-quarter profit more than
doubled, beating  analysts’ estimates,  as it cut costs and
generated more revenue from hotels and international operations.
Dubai Islamic posted a 25 percent rise in  full-year profit ,
meeting estimates. Dubai Islamic also said it plans to pay a
cash dividend of 15 percent for last year. The shares rose to
2.22 dirhams, the highest since May 3.  About  397 million shares  were traded in Dubai today, almost
four times the 12-month daily average of about 109 million
shares.  Oil Above $100  The  Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU)  gained 0.4 percent in New
York on Feb. 17 to 12,949.87, the highest close since May 2008,
on improved economic data. Oil for March delivery rose 0.9
percent to $103.24 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange
on Feb. 17, the highest settlement price since May 10. Gulf Arab
oil exporters, including Qatar and the U.A.E., supply about a
fifth of the world’s oil.  “The positive sentiment is coming from the U.S.,” said
Nabil Farhat, a partner at Abu Dhabi-based Al Fajer Securities.
“The U.S. markets are moving ahead despite the confusion coming
out of Greece,” helping lift local shares, he said.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Italian Prime Minister
Mario Monti and Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos discussed a
second Greek bailout on a conference call and are optimistic
finance ministers will resolve remaining issues when they meet
on Feb. 20, according to Steffen Seibert, Merkel’s chief
spokesman.  Oman’s  MSM 30 Index (MSM30)  and Bahrain’s  BB All Share Index (BHSEASI)  gained
