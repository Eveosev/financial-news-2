Nigeria,  Venezuela  and Iraq raised
crude oil exports in December from a month earlier while other
 OPEC (OPCRTOTL)  members including Saudi Arabia decreased shipments,
according to the Joint Organization Data Initiative.  Nigeria increased its exports by 8 percent to 2.27 million
barrels a day, benefiting from higher crude  oil prices .
Venezuela boosted exports by 18.7 percent to 1.71 million
barrels a day while Iraq increased exports by 0.5 percent to
2.15 million barrels a day, data the government submitted to the
initiative and posted today on its  website  showed.  Saudi Arabia, the largest producer and exporter in the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, reduced exports
to 7.36 million barrels a day from 7.8 million barrels in
November, according to  JODI  figures, which include condensates
and exclude natural-gas liquids.  Angola  cut exports by 1.7 percent to 1.6 million barrels a
day in December, while Ecuador’s exports fell 5.7 percent to
299,000 barrels a day. Qatar kept its exports unchanged at
590,000 for the second month in a row, the data showed. Algeria
exported 693,000 barrels of oil during December, according to
the data.  Iran, OPEC’s second-largest producer, Kuwait, the United
Arab Emirates, and  Libya  didn’t submit data for the month.  OPEC decided on Dec. 14 to increase its production ceiling
to 30 million barrels a day, the first change in three years,
moving the group’s target nearer to actual output as it sought
to accommodate rising exports from Libya and Iraq.  To contact the reporter on this story:
