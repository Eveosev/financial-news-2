C&C Group Plc (GCC) , the maker of Magners
cider and Tennents lager, may move its main listing to  London 
from Dublin, the Independent on Sunday reported, without saying
where it got the information.  Chief Executive Officer Stephen Glancey has discussed the
move with investors, the newspaper said. Dublin-based C&C, which
has a secondary listing in London, would become the third Irish
company to switch its listing to London since December,
following  CRH Plc (CRH)  and  Greencore Group Plc (GNC) , the Independent said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
