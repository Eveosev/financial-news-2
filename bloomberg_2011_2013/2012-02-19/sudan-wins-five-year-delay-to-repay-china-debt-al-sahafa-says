Sudan  has secured a five-year delay
to repay its debt to China, al-Sahafa newspaper reported today,
citing the country’s minister of finance.  China agreed to accept a delay because of Sudan’s “loss of
oil revenues,” the Khartoum-based paper said, citing Sudan
Finance Minister Ali Mahmoud, without giving details on the
amount of debt.  The U.S. offered Sudan $2.4 billion of debt forgiveness
under the condition that Sudan is able to secure peace along its
borders with  South Sudan  and in Darfur, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
