Russian equities in  New York  posted
the sixth advance in seven weeks, led by  VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP)  and  OAO
RusHydro (RSHYY) , as the best gain for oil this year bolstered flows
into stock funds focused on the world’s largest energy exporter.  The  Bloomberg Russia-US 14 Index (RUS14BN)  of Russian companies
traded in New York rose 2.6 percent last week to 109.14. Equity
funds dedicated to  Russia  took in $109 million in the week ended
Feb. 15, the third consecutive week of net inflows and the
longest rising streak since November, according to EPFR Global.
 Futures (VEA)  expiring in March on Moscow’s  RTS index (RTSI$)  rose 0.1 percent
to 165,355 in U.S. trading on Feb. 17.  The 4.5 percent gain this year in oil, Russia’s biggest
export earner, has boosted the allure of the nation’s stocks,
the cheapest among 21  emerging markets  tracked by Bloomberg.
Crude traded in New York rose to a nine-month high, adding 4.6
percent last week, as an index of leading U.S. indicators rose
in January and jobless claims slid to a four-year low. Prospects
Greece will get its second bailout also supported energy prices.  “Russia has rallied strong from the December lows as the
European situation has gotten better and oil has also stayed
strong because of problems in the  Middle East ,” Nelson Saiers,
who oversees $639 million at Alphabet Management LLC in New
York, including Russian stocks, said on Feb. 17. “Russia is
cheap from a valuation standpoint, and that continues to attract
investors.”  VimpelCom’s Record Week  United Co. Rusal (486) , the world’s largest aluminum producer,
rose 1.7 percent to HK$6.78 in Hong Kong trading as of 10:08
a.m. local time. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 1.1 percent
today after  China  cut reserve requirements for banks to fuel
lending and buoy economic growth.  VimpelCom, the world’s sixth-largest mobile-phone company
with 200 million subscribers, added 3.6 percent to $12.21 in New
York on Feb. 17, bringing its advance in the week to a record
9.4 percent. VimpelCom was the biggest gainer on the Bloomberg
Russia-U.S. 14 gauge as largest shareholder,  Telenor ASA (TEL) ,
boosted its stake in the company and dropped claims against
other investors, including second-largest stakeholder, Altimo, a
unit of Russia’s Alfa Group.  The two investors may seek to form a new board.  Russian equity funds have attracted $457 million in 2012,
trailing China funds that received a net inflow of $1.8 billion
this year, said Cambridge, Massachusetts-based EPFR, a data
research company.  RusHydro, Russia’s largest renewable energy producer,
gained 6.6 percent last week in New York to $3.86 after  shares 
in Moscow advanced 4.8 percent.  Government Revenue  Crude for March delivery jumped 1.7 percent in electronic

 Europe  exchange. Urals crude, Russia’s chief export blend,
gained 0.3 percent to $119.79.  Oil and natural gas constituted almost 50 percent of
Russian government revenue last year.  OAO Mobile TeleSystems (MBT) , Russia’s largest cell-phone
operator and VimpelCom’s competitor in Russia and Ukraine, rose
to the highest level in six months on Feb. 17 in New York as the
largest U.S. largest mobile-phone companies, including AT&T,
 Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ)  and Sprint Nextel also gained.  Mobile TeleSystems -- or MTS, as the company is also known
-- advanced 2.5 percent to 17.74 in New York on Feb. 17. The
stock, up 21 percent this year, gained 4.9 percent last week,
the most since the week ended Jan. 6. Shares fell 30 percent in
2011.  $1 Billion  Belarus’ government extended an offer last week to sell a
51 percent stake in their joint venture in the nation with MTS,
after two failed auctions last year. The asking price is
unchanged at $1 billion.  “I don’t think anyone would buy this for the ticket price
of $1 billion,”  Luis Saenz , chief executive officer of the U.S.
unit of Moscow-based brokerage Otkritie Financial Corp, said by
e-mail on Feb. 17.  OAO Mechel (MTL) , Russia’s largest producer of coal for
steelmaking, fell 1.2 percent to $10.66 on Feb. 17, little
changed from the previous week. The stock, which lost 71 percent
last year, has gained 26 percent in 2012.  Moscow-based  Mechel (MTLR)  fell after saying during U.S. trading
on Feb. 17 that it will halt production temporarily at two
plants in  Romania  as cold weather in Europe disrupts scrap
supplies. The  stock  gained on Moscow’s Micex Index before the
announcement, rising 1.3 percent to 322.20 rubles, or $10.76.  Commodities Gain  The  RTS Index (RTSI$)  in Moscow rose 0.9 percent on Feb. 17 to

0.3 percent to 688.44 on Feb. 17 to extend its weekly gain to
2.2 percent. The surge in oil last week was partly offset by a
decline in copper due to signs of slowing growth in China.
Copper futures for May delivery fell 2.2 percent on Feb. 17 to
settle at $3.716 a pound on the Comex in New York.  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , a U.S.-traded fund that

its sixth advance in the first seven weeks of 2012. The  RTS

futures, fell for the third day in five on Feb. 17, losing 3.6
percent to 30.89 points.  The Micex has gained 12 percent in 2011 and trades at 6.1
times analysts’ earnings estimates for member companies. That

compiled by Bloomberg. The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  trades at
9.8 times estimated earnings, and the  BSE India Sensitive Index (SENSEX)
