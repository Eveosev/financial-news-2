Kyle Kendrick agreed to a two-year
contract worth $7.5 million with the  Philadelphia Phillies , a
little more than a month after the right-handed pitcher avoided
arbitration by coming to a one-year accord with the team.  Kendrick went 8-6 with a career-best 3.22 earned run
average in 34 games for the Phillies last year. The 27-year-old
made 15 starts, 19 relief appearances and went 5-2 with a 2.14
ERA in 18 games against National League East Division opponents,
the team said in a  statement  on its website today.  Selected by the Phillies in the seventh round of the 2003
draft, Kendrick has a career Major League Baseball record of
43-30, with a 4.41 ERA in 127 games, including 98 starts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
