GPT Group (GPT) ,  Australia ’s second-
biggest diversified property trust by market capitalization,
plans to expand its funds management and development businesses
this year as it seeks to boost earnings.  The company is exploring “opportunities to increase the
contribution development makes to our earnings, and that may
mean more mixed-use type developments,” Managing Director
Michael Cameron said today in a telephone interview. “Our funds
have been able to raise a stack of capital, so we’re really well
placed to borrow or raise money to acquire assets in those funds,
or establish new funds.”  GPT today reported operating income that rose 7 percent to
A$438.8 million ($473 million) in the 12 months to Dec. 31,
after selling “non-core” assets at home and abroad to focus on
its domestic office, retail and industrial properties. Net
income declined to A$246.2 million due to losses on derivatives,
it said in a statement to the Australian stock exchange.  The Sydney-based company will explore options for funding
new developments, including on its own, with outside investors
and in partnership with its funds, Cameron said, declining to
provide a target the company wants to expand the development and
funds management businesses to.  GPT  climbed  1.3 percent to A$3.12 at the close of trading
in Sydney, the highest in more than a month.  The group will also seek to boost its holdings of
industrial properties, which now make up 9 percent of its
portfolio, Cameron said, declining to specify a target.  GPT, which said in November it will internalize the
management of the industrial and office properties as part of
its strategy to actively manage the properties it owns, will
also explore offering property management services to other
groups to generate new revenue streams, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
