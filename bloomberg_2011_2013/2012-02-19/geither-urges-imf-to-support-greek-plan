U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy
Geithner  urged the  International Monetary Fund  to support
Greece’s plan to cut spending to secure a bailout.  “This is a very strong and very difficult package of
reforms, deserving of support of the international community and
the IMF,” Geithner said in a written statement. “The United
States will encourage the IMF to support this agreement.”  Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos identified 325 million
euros ($427 million) in spending cuts to secure a bailout aimed
at averting the region’s first sovereign default. Finance
ministers from all 17 euro-area countries are scheduled to meet
in Brussels tomorrow to finalize an aid package for Greece.  To contact the reporter on this story:
