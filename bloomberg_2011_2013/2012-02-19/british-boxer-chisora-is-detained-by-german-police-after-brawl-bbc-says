Defeated British heavyweight Dereck
Chisora was released without charge by police in Munich after
threatening boxing rival  David Haye  during a televised post-
fight news conference, the British Broadcasting Corp.  reported .  Chisora, who lost a World Boxing Council title fight
against Vitali Klitschko two days ago, was involved in a brawl
with Haye, who had been working for a television station, the
 BBC  said on its  website . Police are searching for Haye to
question him about the incident, the BBC added.  Chisora accused Haye of hitting him with a glass bottle
before repeatedly saying that he would shoot the former World
Boxing Association heavyweight champion, the BBC reported.
Haye’s manager, Adam Booth, suffered cuts to his face in the
melee, the BBC said.  Frank Warren, Chisora’s promoter, told BBC Radio 5 Live
yesterday that the clash was “unacceptable” and that he
expects the  British Boxing Board of Control  to “take
appropriate action.”  Ukraine’s Klitschko  retained  his WBC title in a unanimous
points decision over Chisora at Munich’s Olympic hall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
