Reserve Gary Neal hit a 3-pointer to
tie regulation play and another for the overtime win as the San
Antonio Spurs recorded their National Basketball Association-
leading 10th straight victory, beating the  Los Angeles  Clippers
103-100.  Neal tied the score at 95-95 from 25 feet with five seconds
left in the fourth quarter last night at Staples Center in Los
Angeles. Grabbing a pass from  Tim Duncan , he connected with
another 25-footer with 25 seconds to play in overtime, breaking
a tie and putting the Spurs ahead 101-98.  Tony Parker  sealed the
game by adding a pair free throws.  Chris Paul  missed a 28-foot attempt to tie the score in the
final second of overtime.  “Sometimes you got to get lucky and we definitely got
lucky,” said Duncan, who had 11 points and 17 rebounds. “It’s
been a great run for us.”  Parker had 30 points and 10 assists, while Neal had 17
points, Matt Bonner scored 13, Daniel Green had 11 and DeJuan Blair added 10 points.  Blake Griffin  led the Clippers with 22 points and 20
