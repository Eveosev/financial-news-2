Avner Oil Exploration LLP (AVNRL)  and  Delek
Drilling-LP (DEDRL)  rose the most in two weeks on speculation Israel
will allow exports of natural gas through a venture with Cyprus
and before Israel Electric Corp. approves a gas deal.  Avner shares  climbed 2.5 percent, the biggest advance since
Feb. 5, to 2.644 shekels at 3:45 p.m. in Tel Aviv. Delek
Drilling increased 2.2 percent, also the most since Feb. 5, to
15.15 shekels.  Isramco Negev 2 LP (ISRAL)  gained 1.5 percent to 0.526
shekel, the most since Feb. 12.  “The shares are advancing on reports that Israel will
promote the export of gas with Cyprus and expectations of the
closing of the contract with Israel Electric Corp. for the Tamar
gas,” Guil Bashan, an analyst at I.B.I.-Israel Brokerage &
Investments Ltd. in  Tel Aviv , said today by phone.  Cyprus and Israel are studying the possibility of a common
pipeline that could help export natural gas to Europe and Asia,
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Feb. 16.
Netanyahu appointed a committee to promote the growth of the
country’s gas sector and deal with geo-political aspects of the
industry, including gas exports to East Asia, his office said in
an e-mailed statement today.  Israel Electric’s board will continue today discussions  to
approve the Tamar gas deal, Iris Ben-Shahar, a spokeswoman for
the electricity company, said by phone. The talks began on
Thursday. Delek Drilling, Avner and Isramco are partners in the
Tamar  gas field .  To contact the reporter on this story:
