Friso van Oranje, the second son of
 Queen Beatrix  of the Netherlands, remains in stable but critical
condition after a Feb. 17 skiing accident, the  Dutch Government
Information Service  said.  “Prince Friso’s condition is still unchanged: stable but
critical,” the information service in  The Hague  said today in a
statement, following his second night in the intensive care
trauma unit of a hospital in Innsbruck,  Austria . No prognosis
can be given before the end of the week, it said.  Friso, 43, was trapped in an avalanche while skiing off-
piste at the western Austrian ski resort of Lech, where the
Dutch royal family has spent winter vacations since 1959. He was
recovered by the Lech mountain rescue service and volunteers
after being buried for about 20 minutes and was transported by
helicopter to Innsbruck.  Family members including Friso’s brothers Crown Prince Willem-Alexander and Prince Constantijn and their families have
flown to the area to join the Queen, Friso’s wife Princess Mabel
and their two daughters, who were in Austria at the time of the
accident.  To contact the reporter on this story:
