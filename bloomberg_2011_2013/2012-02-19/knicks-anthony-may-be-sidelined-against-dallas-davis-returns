New York  Knicks forward Carmelo Anthony will probably not play against the Dallas Mavericks
tonight, while Baron Davis could return to the National
Basketball Association team’s roster, coach  Mike D’Antoni  said.  Anthony has missed six games with a strained right groin
sustained Feb. 6 against the Utah Jazz. During that time, the
Knicks have gone 5-1, buoyed by the shooting strength of
undrafted Harvard University point guard Jeremy Lin, who was cut
by two NBA teams before spending the first part of the season on
New York’s bench.  “Just a little twinge here and there,” D’Antoni told
reporters yesterday after Anthony’s practice round. “We’re
thinking Monday.”  The Knicks are playing the  New Jersey Nets  tomorrow.  Davis, who has been out for the season with a herniated
disk in his back, could be ready for tonight’s game, D’Antoni
said. “He looks pretty good” during drills, D’Antoni said.
“He’s close. He can go.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
