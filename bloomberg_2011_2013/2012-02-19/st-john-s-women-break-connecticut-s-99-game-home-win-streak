Shenneika Smith made a 3-point shot
with eight seconds left to give  St. John’s  University a 57-56
win that broke the second-ranked  University of Connecticut ’s 99-
game home winning streak in women’s college basketball.  Huskies’ Bria Hartley missed a chance to win the game when
her 3-point attempt with three seconds left fell short last
night at Harry A. Gampel Pavilion in Storrs, Connecticut.  Nadurah McKenith and Da’Shena Stevens each had 15 points
and Smith scored 11 for the Red Storm (18-8, 10-3 Big East).
Kaleena Mosquda-Lewis had 12 points for the Huskies (24-3, 11-2
Big East).  The Huskies last lost at home on March 6, 2007, when they
played Rutgers in the Big East championship game. St. John’s,
visiting from  New York , is the first unranked team to beat the
UConn women at home since Louisville in the National Collegiate
Athletic Association tournament in 1993.  To contact the reporter on this story:
