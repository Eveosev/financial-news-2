Japan ’s liquefied natural gas
imports rose to a record in January after the Fukushima nuclear
disaster led to the shutdown of most of the country’s atomic
reactors, causing utilities to use more fossil fuels.  The nation’s LNG imports climbed 28.2 percent from a year
earlier to 8.15 million metric tons, according to a preliminary
report released today by the Ministry of Finance.  Power utilities increased thermal power generation by 28.5
percent in the month, according to  data  compiled by the
Federation of Electric Power Companies of Japan. The average
operating rate of nuclear  power plants  in January was 10.3
percent, it said.  The country’s crude-oil imports fell 2.1 percent to 18.83
million kiloliters (118 million barrels) in the month, the
 finance ministry  said in the report.  The following table shows Japan’s imports for January:  To contact the reporter on this story:
