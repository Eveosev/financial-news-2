European Central Bank Executive
Board member  Joerg Asmussen  warned emerging countries against
stockpiling large quantities of foreign currency,  Financial
Times Deutschland  reported, citing an interview.  The euro is not threatened as the second-most-important
reserve currency after the  U.S. dollar  even as the euro region
is facing a debt crisis, FTD cited Asmussen as saying. The
Chinese renminbi could also gain importance as a reserve
currency in the medium term if China liberalizes its movement of
capital, Asmussen said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
