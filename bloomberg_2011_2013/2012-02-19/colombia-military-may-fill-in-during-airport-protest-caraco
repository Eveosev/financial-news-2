Colombia ’s government said it may
use military air-traffic controllers to replace protesting
workers at Bogota’s El Dorado airport who have caused flight
cancellations and delays as they negotiate for better labor
conditions, Caracol Radio reported.  Colombian Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzon said the
military’s “contingency” plan could be put into effect if the
airport’s air-traffic controllers don’t soon reach an agreement
with the government, according to Caracol Radio.  The protests have caused at least four days of flight
cancellations for airlines including  Avianca Taca Holding SA (PFAVTA) ,
owner of Colombia’s biggest airline, according to statements by
Colombia’s civil aviation agency.  To contact the reporters on this story:
