Saudi Arabia  has yet to approve the
country’s  renewable energy  strategy that aims to reduce crude
oil used for domestic power generation and water desalination,
an official said today.  The strategy which includes new regulations and financial
incentives for private investors to develop the country’s
renewable energy sources have been submitted to the Cabinet for
approval, Maher al-Odan, a consultant with the King Abdullah
City for Atomic and Renewable Energy, said at a conference in
Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. The agency, known as KA-CARE, is in
charge of developing alternative and renewable energy sources.  Al-Odan didn’t say when the government would approve the
new strategy. Saudi Arabia, holder of one-fifth of global oil
reserves, aims to use solar energy to desalinate seawater and
build 16 nuclear reactors by 2030 as the nation seeks to cut the
amount of crude it burns in generators to meet rising power
demand.  Persian Gulf oil producers are seeking to reduce their
reliance on fossil fuels for power generation to maximize
exports of valuable crude and allocate natural gas to
petrochemicals production. KA-CARE’s al-Odan said that Saudi
Arabia is taking steps to develop its renewable strategy as the
country needs to add around 20,000 megawatt of electricity in
the coming ten years.  KA-CARE forecasts domestic demand for oil and refined
products will more than double to 8.3 million barrels of oil
equivalent a day by 2028 from 3.4 million last year, al-Odan
said. Around 60 percent of the electricity generated in the
country goes to cooling homes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
