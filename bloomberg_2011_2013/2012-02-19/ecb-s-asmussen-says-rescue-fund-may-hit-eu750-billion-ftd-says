European Central Bank Executive
Board member Joerg Asmussen said  Europe ’s permanent bailout fund
could be boosted to 750 billion euros ($988.7 billion) by
deploying unused funds from its temporary predecessor,  Financial
Times Deutschland  reported, citing an interview.  Asmussen said the European Stability Mechanism could
receive 250 billion euros in funds untapped from the European
Financial Stability Facility and that the ECB would support such
a move, the newspaper reported.  The ECB board member added that extra contributions to the
 International Monetary Fund  to ward off financial crises could
be agreed by April, the FTD reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
