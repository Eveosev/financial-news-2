Germany’s Foreign Minister  Guido Westerwelle  warned against a further escalation in a nuclear
dispute with  Iran .  “We will jointly examine with our partners in substance
the Iranian offer of dialogue, which was sent in writing,” he
said today in a statement. “Should there be a serious,
substantial willingness to talk, we want to identify it.”  While Iran insists its nuclear program is for civilian
energy and medical research, the U.S. and European governments
say they suspect it is seeking an atomic weapons capability.  Iran hasn’t negotiated with the so-called P5+1 -- the UN
Security Council’s permanent members China, France, Russia, the
U.K. and the U.S., plus Germany -- since talks broke down in
January 2011.  To contact the reporters on this story:
