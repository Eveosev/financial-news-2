German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said  Greece  will receive a second bailout package if
it implements all the necessary commitments and reforms by the
end of the month and “all other questions are solved,”
 Tagesspiegel  reported.  “We’re not giving new conditions,” Schaeuble told the
German newspaper in the interview published today. “A step-by-
step commitment wouldn’t be an efficient way. We’ll decide over
the overall package on Monday.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
