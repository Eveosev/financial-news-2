Germany ’s opposition Social
Democratic Party may suggest that Chancellor Angela Merkel
nominate Klaus Toepfer, a former environment minister, to be the
nation’s next president if agreement can’t reached on the
candidacy of Joachim Gauck, a former East German dissident,
 Spiegel online  reported, citing unnamed people close to the SPD.  Merkel has invited the opposition for talks at the
chancellery in Berlin tonight on a successor for  Christian Wulff , who resigned last week from his post as Germany’s mainly
ceremonial head of state, the magazine reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
