Iran ’s government has made provisions
to meet consumer demand ahead of the Iranian New Year, Minister
of Industries, Mines and Commerce Mehdi Ghazanfari said,
advising Iranians against hoarding goods.  “Piling up goods at home isn’t to the benefit of consumers
and we don’t advise it,” Ghazanfari said in Tehran without
providing details, according to the official  Islamic Republic
News Agency .  Food sales usually rise toward the end of the fiscal year
in preparation for Iranian New Year, which starts on March 20th.
Given the fluctuations in Tehran’s foreign currency markets and
volatility in the national currency’s value, Iranians may be
purchasing even more this year, Ghazanfari said.  The move may be due to concern that prices may increase
further. Iran’s December inflation rate was 20.6 percent. Iran
has also come under additional sanctions from the European Union
and the U.S., which are limiting its financial transactions and
trade.  People are worried that prices are increasing and they are
rushing to buy food items and store them, Mohammad-Reza
Mortazavi, the head of the Iranian Association of Food Industry,
said according to a report by the official  Iranian Students News
Agency  on Jan. 27.  Iranian demand for fruit for the New Year’s period can
fully be met with local production, Agriculture Minister Sadegh
Khalilian  said  Feb. 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
