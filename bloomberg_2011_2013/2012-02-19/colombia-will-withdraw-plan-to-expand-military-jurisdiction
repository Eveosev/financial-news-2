Colombia ’s government said it will
withdraw its proposal to expand military jurisdiction over cases
of abuses by Colombian security forces after human-rights groups
opposed the measure.  Colombian Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzon said he’ll
instead ask Congress to make clear in the constitution that
human-rights abuses including torture, extrajudicial killings,
disappearances and rapes shouldn’t go before military courts,
according to a statement on the ministry’s website late
yesterday.  A justice reform bill that had been promoted by the
government of President Juan Manuel Santos to expand the role of
military courts would “dramatically reverse” progress made in
investigating human-rights violations,  Human Rights Watch  said
in December.  “By virtually guaranteeing impunity for human-rights
violations committed by the security forces, it could ultimately
expose Colombia to investigations by the  International Criminal
Court ,” the New York-based group’s America’s director, Jose Miguel Vivanco, said in a letter addressed to Santos and
released by e-mail in December.  To contact the reporters on this story:
