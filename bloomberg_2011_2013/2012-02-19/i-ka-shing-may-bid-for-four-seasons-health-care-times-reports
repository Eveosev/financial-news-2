Hong Kong billionaire  Li Ka-Shing 
may make a bid for Four Seasons Health Care Group Ltd. through
his healthcare business, the Sunday Times reported, without
saying where it got the information.  Li’s  CK Life Sciences International Holdings Inc. (775)  may
compete against others including a Chinese state-backed company
and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority for the U.K.’s biggest
care-home group, which is struggling to repay debt, the
newspaper reported.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  may inject more cash into
Four Season Health Care, while a full sale of the business is
also being explored, the Times said. Rothschild and Gleacher
Shacklock LLP are handling the process, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
