British Airways Plc, a unit of
International Consolidated Airlines Group SA, may pay less than
half of a 125.5 million pound ($198.6 million) fine for alleged
price-fixing,  The Sunday Telegraph  reported, citing an
unidentified person.  The penalty levied in 2007 relates to BAâ€™s alleged
collusion with Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd. over fuel-price
surcharges from 2004 to 2006, the newspaper said. BA may pay a
reduced fine after it held talks with the  Office of Fair
Trading , according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
