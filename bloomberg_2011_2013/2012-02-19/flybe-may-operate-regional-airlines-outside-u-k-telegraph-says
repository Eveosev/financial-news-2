Flybe Group Plc, Britainâ€™s biggest
domestic airline, is in talks with European carriers to operate
their regional businesses on a contract basis,  The Sunday
Telegraph  said, citing Chief Executive Officer Jim French.  So-called contract flying would guarantee Flybe income
without relying on customers booking directly with the airline,
French told the newspaper, without identifying potential
partners.  To contact the reporter on this story:
