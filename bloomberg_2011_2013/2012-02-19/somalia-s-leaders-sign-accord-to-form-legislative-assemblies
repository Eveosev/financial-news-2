Somalia ’s leaders agreed to the
basic structures of a new government and parliament to replace
the current United Nations-backed transitional administration.  The country’s future lower house will have 225 members, at
least 30 percent of them women, according to a statement issued
after a meeting of signatories of the Somali road map -- signed
in September on setting up a new government -- in Garowe,
Puntland, in northern Somalia, hosted by Puntland State and held
under UN auspices. The upper house will be based on the future
federal state’s final configuration and have a maximum of 54
members.  A national constituent assembly of 1,000 people, with 30
percent women, will be appointed by traditional elders and civil
society members, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
