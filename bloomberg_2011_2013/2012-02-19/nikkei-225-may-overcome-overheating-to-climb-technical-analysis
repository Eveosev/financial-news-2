Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  may
rise further even as some indicators signal it has been
overbought in the short term, according to a technical analyst
at Nomura Holdings Inc.  The Japanese equity benchmark has risen  15 percent  from
Nov. 25, when the gauge closed at its lowest level since March
31, 2009. Measures of market momentum such as the 25-day Toraku
index and relative strength index show the Nikkei 225 has
reached levels associated with being overbought. The gains may
continue as the yen trends lower, boosting the country’s
exporters, said Nomura’s Shoichiro Yamauchi.  “The markets are strongly overheating based on short term
technical benchmarks, but the upside trend will still
continue,” said Yamauchi. “The Nikkei will likely reach a
level between 9,700 and 10,000 from the end of this month to the
Golden Week” in the first week of May.  The Nikkei 225’s 14-day  relative strength index , a measure
of momentum, is at 76.9, exceeding the threshold of 70 that some
traders use to identify when a security is overbought.  The 25-day  Toraku (TORAKU)  gauge, derived from the ratio of
advancing stocks to declining, topped 120 for a fifth day,
suggesting the market may be poised to fall. The Toraku spent 14
straight days above the 120 level in July last year, just before
 Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis and squabbling among U.S.
lawmakers over the nation’s debt ceiling prompted a market rout.  The yen recently fell through its 200-day moving average
against the dollar. That has coincided with a 6.6 percent
increase this month in the Nikkei 225, which includes exporters
such as Sony Corp. and Canon Inc. whose overseas sales are hurt
by a higher currency. That points to a longer term trend that
will cancel out any short term overheating shown by the
technical indicators, Yamauchi said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
