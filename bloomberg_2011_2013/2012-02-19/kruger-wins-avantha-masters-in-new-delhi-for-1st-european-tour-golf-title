South Africa ’s Jbe Kruger won golf’s
Avantha Masters in  New Delhi  by two shots for his first title on
the European Tour.  The 25-year-old, who collects 300,000 euros ($394,200),
finished with a 14-under-par 274 at the DLF Golf & Country Club
after a 3-under final round today. Spain’s Jorge Campillo and
Germany’s Marcel Siem tied for second place.  “I’m very relieved to win for the first time,” Kruger
said on the European Tour’s  website . “If you want to win you
need to make putts on the final day and I did that.”  Kruger held on to win even after a bogey at the penultimate
hole, his first since the second round. He then hit a camera
with a wayward drive at the last and fired his second shot into
the trees before recovering to make par.  Peter Whiteford, who was one shot behind Kruger overnight,
was disqualified. The Scot’s ball had moved fractionally before
he played to the green on the 18th hole in the third round but
he had signed for an incorrect score.  To contact the reporter on this story:
