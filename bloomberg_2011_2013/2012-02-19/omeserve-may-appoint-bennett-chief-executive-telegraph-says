Homeserve Plc (HSV)  may promote Martin Bennett as chief executive officer from his current role as
chief operating officer,  The Sunday Telegraph  said, citing
internal company documents.  Richard Harpin, the current CEO who owns 12 percent of the
company, remains committed to Homeserve, the newspaper said,
without providing details.  “It’s purely speculation,” Lucy Thomas, a Homeserve
spokeswoman, said today when reached on her mobile phone.
“There are no plans for him to become CEO at this moment,” she
said. Bennett was appointed chief operating officer three weeks
ago, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
