Israel Chemicals Ltd. (ICL) , the company
that extracts minerals from the Dead Sea to make fertilizer and
potash, advanced the most in two weeks on speculation price
rises in corn and wheat will fuel demand for fertilizers.  The  shares  increased 2.2 percent, the biggest intraday gain
since Feb. 5, to 39.85 shekels at 11:48 a.m. in Tel Aviv.
Israel’s benchmark  TA-25 Index (TA-25)  was up 0.8 percent.  “ICL is rising because the price of corn, wheat and soy
rose last week,” analyst Ilanit Sherf at Psagot Investment
House Ltd. in Tel Aviv said today by phone. “The price rises
indicate that farmers will be willing to buy more fertilizers
and pay more for them.”  In the week ended Feb. 17, corn and wheat for May delivery
rose 1.5 percent and soybeans for May delivery advanced 2.9
percent.  Shares of  Israel Corp. (ILCO) , which holds a 52.30 percent stake
in Israel Chemicals according to  data compiled by Bloomberg ,
advanced 1.7 percent to 2,317 shekels, headed for the biggest
gain since Feb. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
