HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  may reject the
U.K. government’s plan to inject 20 billion pounds ($31.6
billion) into the economy via bank lending to small- and medium-
sized businesses because it’s too expensive,  the Sunday
Telegraph  reported, citing unidentified people close to the
talks between the government and the lender.  The Treasury has set a March 15 deadline to complete the
loan-guarantee discussions and may present an accord ahead of
the budget announcement on March 21, the newspaper reported,
citing unidentified people. HSBC supports the program in
principle, the Telegraph said.  HSBC’s London press office didn’t immediately reply to a
message from Bloomberg News today seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
