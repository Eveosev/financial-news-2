Lindsey Vonn  of the U.S. claimed her
second World Cup skiing title in two days after fog forced the
cancellation of today’s super-combined race to give her an
unbeatable lead in the discipline.  Vonn, 27, leads the super-combined competition for a third
straight season, with Slovenia’s Tina Maze unable to overhaul a
55-point deficit after the event in Sochi, Russia, was scrapped.  Vonn yesterday matched the record of five straight downhill
titles Austria’s Annemarie Moeser-Proell set between 1971 and
1975. The American has a  448-point  lead over Maze in the overall
World Cup standings, with defending champion Maria Hoefl-Riesch
of Germany 38 points further back.  Austria’s Marcel Hirscher now only trails men’s  World Cup 
leader Ivica Kostelic of Croatia by  18 points  after winning a
giant slalom and slalom in consecutive days in Bansko, Bulgaria.  Kostelic was absent because of a knee injury he suffered in
a super-combined victory on Feb. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
