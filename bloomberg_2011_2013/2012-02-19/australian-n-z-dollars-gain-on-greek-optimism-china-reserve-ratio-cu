The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars advanced versus most major counterparts on the prospect
euro-area governments will agree today on a deal to release a
second bailout package for  Greece , spurring appetite for higher-
yielding assets.  Both currencies also strengthened after  China ’s central
bank said the  proportion of cash  that lenders must set aside
will fall from Feb. 24, adding to speculation the action will
boost the country’s economy and demand for exports from
Australia and New Zealand. The so-called Aussie and kiwi both
climbed to their highest levels against the yen in more than six
months as Asian stocks rose.  “The Greek deal should be rubber-stamped by tonight,”
said  Imre Speizer , a strategist in Auckland at Westpac Banking
Corp.,  Australia ’s second-largest lender. “For the next week,
the Aussie and the kiwi will remain on their uptrends.”  Australia’s currency rose 0.6 percent to $1.0770 as of 4:56
p.m. in Sydney. It gained 0.6 percent to 85.64 yen and earlier
touched 86.36, the strongest level since July 11. New Zealand’s
dollar advanced 1 percent to 84.06 U.S. cents. The kiwi
strengthened 1 percent to 66.85 yen after earlier reaching
67.32, the highest since Aug. 4.  The Aussie slid 0.4 percent to NZ$1.2811, the biggest one-
day drop since Jan. 31.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  of stocks climbed 0.9 percent.  Greek Bailout  Finance ministers from the 17 euro-area nations will meet
in Brussels today to decide on 130 billion euros ($172 billion)
in Greek aid. Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  said Greece found
all the extra cuts needed to reduce spending by 325 million
euros to receive a bailout and avert the region’s first
sovereign default.  The People’s Bank of China announced on Feb. 18 that it
would lower bank reserve requirements by 50 basis points. China
is Australia’s biggest trading partner and New Zealand’s second-
largest export destination.  “It’s a stimulus for China, which is good for risk
appetite,” Westpac’s Speizer said. “You’d have to be biased
upwards rather than downwards this week, at least for risk
assets” including the Australian and New Zealand dollars, he
said.  Currency Forecasts  The Aussie will probably climb to $1.08 by June 30 and end
the year at $1.09, according to a report today by  Commonwealth
Bank of Australia , the South Pacific nation’s biggest lender by
market value. That compares with previous forecasts of 95 U.S.
cents on June 30 and $1 at year-end. The New Zealand dollar may
advance to 88 U.S. cents by the end of 2012, compared with an
earlier estimate of 78 cents, the bank said.  “Over the medium-to-long term, we favor the Australian
dollar outperformance,” said  Thomas Averill , managing director
in Sydney at Rochford Capital, a currency and interest-rate
risk-management company. “I think fundamentals are quite
supportive of the Australian dollar.”  Australia’s dollar has appreciated 2.8 percent this year,
while New Zealand’s has strengthened 5.7 percent, the two best
performances among the 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.  Australia plans to price a new 10-year Treasury Indexed
Bond tomorrow, the nation’s funding arm said in an e-mailed
statement. The initial issue amount is expected to be A$750
million ($808 million), it said.  Australia’s  10-year (GACGB10)  bond yield rose eight basis points, or
0.08 percentage point, to 4.12 percent. New Zealand’s  two-year
swap rate , a fixed payment made to receive floating rates,
gained 10 1/2 basis points to 3.065 percent.  New Zealand’s dollar maintained its advance after the
Performance of Services index rose to 53.6 last month from a
revised 50.9 in December, Bank of New Zealand Ltd. and Business
New Zealand said today. A reading above 50 indicates an
expansion.  The nation’s  producer input prices  increased 0.5 percent in
the fourth quarter from the three months through September,
 Statistics New Zealand  said today. That’s the smallest advance
since the fourth quarter of 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
