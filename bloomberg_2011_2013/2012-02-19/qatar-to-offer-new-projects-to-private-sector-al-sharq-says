Qatar plans to invite the private
sector to participate in 30 new projects worth a total of $5.6
billion,  Al Sharq  reported today, citing Mohammed bin Ahmed bin
Towar, Vice Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.  The new projects, which the report didn’t provide details
of, are part of the first phase of a new port, which comes under
Qatar’s 40 billion-riyal ($11 billion) infrastructure program,
the newspaper cited Towar as saying.  Priority will be given to Qatari companies, followed by
companies with Qatari ownerships and then foreign companies,
Towar said, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
