Frank Schaeffler , a lawmaker for the
German Free  Democratic Party , warned against a future permanent
European rescue fund with its own banking license,  Handelsblatt 
reported, citing a guest editorial from the politician.  A banking license would be a “door opener” for “high
inflation,” Handelsblatt said, citing Schaeffler.  The FDP is part of German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
governing coalition. Schaeffler has been a leading opponent of
euro-area rescues.  To contact the reporter on this story:
