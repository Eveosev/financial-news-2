EON AG (EOAN)  is in early talks with
financial investors for a participation in its offshore wind-
power-park project,  Financial Times Deutschland  reported, citing
Mike Winkel, head of the utilityâ€™s clean-energy unit.  EON, which wants to invest about 7 billion euros ($9.2
billion) in renewable energy in the next five years, could
tackle even-larger projects with such participation, FTD said.
The company is ready to offer minority interests in the wind
parks, FTD quoted Winkel as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
