Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s ESPN apologized
for inappropriate references to New York Knicks point guard
Jeremy Lin, and said it fired an employee responsible for
sending one such headline on its ESPN.com mobile site.  A headline appeared early yesterday morning following the
Knicks’ 89-85 loss to the  New Orleans Hornets  using a common
phrase that could be construed as a racial slur, ESPN said. ESPN
said the headline was removed 35 minutes after it was posted.  The sports channel also said an anchor for ESPNNews has
been suspended for 30 days after using an inappropriate word in
asking a question about Lin. A similar reference was made Feb.
17 by a radio commentator on ESPN Radio New York, the network
said.  “We again apologize, especially to Mr. Lin. His
accomplishments are a source of great pride to Asian-American
community, including the Asian-American employees at ESPN,”
ESPN said in the statement.  Lin, a second-year point guard with an economics degree
from  Harvard University , led the Knicks to a seven-game winning
streak before the loss to the Hornets. On Feb. 14, he became the
only player to score more than 20 points and win each of his
first five starts since the  National Basketball Association 
merged with the American Basketball Association in 1976.  He is the NBA’s first American-born player of Chinese or
Taiwanese descent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
