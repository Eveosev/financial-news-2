Daimler AG received a business
license to operate a new truck manufacturing joint venture with
Chinese partner Beiqi Foton Motor Co., Daimler said in an

quarter of 2012, Daimler said in the statement. A Beiqi Foton
plant in Beijing is being retooled to give the venture annual
production capacity of 160,000 vehicles, according to the
statement.  Wu Yuejun was appointed president of the joint venture.
