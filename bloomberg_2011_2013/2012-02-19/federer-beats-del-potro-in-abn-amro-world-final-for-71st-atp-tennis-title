Roger Federer  extended his streak of
winning at least one title on the men’s tour to 12 seasons by
beating Juan Martin  del Potro  in the ABN AMRO World Tennis
Tournament final.  Federer, 30, won 6-1, 6-4 in Rotterdam yesterday to secure
his  71st career title  from 101 finals and improve his record
against Del Potro of Argentina to 9-2.  Switzerland’s Federer, No. 3 in the ATP rankings, has won
the past five indoor hard court tournaments he’s entered, a
streak of 24 straight victories stretching back to the 2010 ATP
World Tour Finals.  “It’s nice to pick up the momentum after the indoor season
I had last year,” Federer, who finished 2011 by winning titles
in Basel, Paris and  London , told reporters. “I really enjoyed
myself here and saved my best for last.”  Federer took a 5-0 lead in the first set yesterday before
Del Potro, 23, held serve for the first time. The Swiss then
served out the 34-minute set and broke 10th-ranked Del Potro
again in the fifth game of the second set. He saved all seven
break points on his own serve during the match.  Federer was playing in his third tournament of the year. He
withdrew from the Qatar Open with a back injury after the
quarterfinals, then lost to  Rafael Nadal  of Spain in the
Australian Open semifinals. He represented Switzerland against
the U.S. in the Davis Cup first round, losing to  John Isner .  Victoria Azarenka , the No. 1-ranked women’s player, lifted
her winning run in 2012 to 17 matches by beating Samantha Stosur
of Australia 6-1, 6-2 in the Qatar Open final.  Azarenka, a 22-year-old from Belarus, won the Sydney
International before breaking through for her first Grand Slam
title at the Australian Open.  To contact the reporter on this story:
