Kingfisher Airlines Ltd. (KAIR) , the Indian
carrier seeking new funds after losses, cut about 13 percent of
flights after bird strikes and other “unexpected events”
forced airplanes out of service.  As many as 32 daily flights were canceled starting Feb. 17,
the Bangalore-based company said in a Feb. 18 e-mailed
statement. The carrier, controlled by billionaire Vijay Mallya,
plans to resume its full schedule of 240 flights a day this
week, it said.  Kingfisher denied closing any operations permanently in a
bid to reassure customers about its long-term viability after
posting more than 10 straight quarterly  losses , having accounts
frozen by tax authorities and cutting flights last year. The
groundings following damage to engines after they sucked in
birds may also reflect a shortage of  power plants  cited by the
aviation regulator last month.  “If you’ve got a spare engine that’s a one-to-two day
problem,” said Neil Hansford, chairman of Strategic Aviation
Solutions, an adviser to airlines based in Port Stephens,
 Australia . Cutting flights may also cause costs as the carrier
will have to find other flights for passengers or refund them,
he said.  Regulator’s Summons  The Directorate General of Civil Aviation has summoned
Sanjay Aggarwal, the airline’s chief executive officer, to
explain tomorrow the reasons for the cancellations, the Press
Trust of  India  reported. The carrier had not informed the
regulator about cutting flights, the  news agency  cited Director
General E.K. Bharat Bhushan as having said.  Three calls by Bloomberg News to Bhushan’s office and
mobile phone today, a national holiday, weren’t answered.  The airline said “unexpected events” were the cause of
the cancellations. Suggestions it is cutting its schedule
permanently ‘are ill-founded,’’ it said.  The airline is also confident it will be able to resolve a
tax dispute and regain access to accounts, it said.  Kingfisher,  Jet Airways (India) Ltd., (JETIN)  the nation’s biggest
carrier, and discount airline  SpiceJet Ltd. (SJET)  all posted third-
quarter losses as higher  jet fuel  costs and price wars eroded
gains from rising travel. Kingfisher’s loss in the quarter ended
Dec. 31 widened to 4.44 billion rupees ($90 million) from 2.54
billion rupees.  The airline has  plunged  39 percent in the past 12 months in
Mumbai trading. It dropped 1.3 percent to 26.65 rupees on Feb.
17. Markets are closed today because of a holiday.  ‘Risks Associated’  Kingfisher is seeking new investment as it struggles under
$1.3 billion of  debt . The carrier has also met with banks and
requested additional working capital, it said.  “New investors in Kingfisher haven’t yet materialized,”
said Binit Somaia, a Sydney-based director at CAPA Centre for
Aviation, an industry consultant. “A serious investor would
only enter after having carefully understood the risks
associated with the transaction.”  The airline, which fell to fifth in the Indian market in
December from second in October, has grounded 12 of its existing
27 Avions de Transport Regional planes and delayed  Airbus (EAD)  SAS
A380 deliveries beyond 2016. ATR, a maker of turboprop aircraft,
said last month it canceled a 38-plane order from Kingfisher
after the carrier missed payments.  The airline has pledged its brand, office furniture and
other assets against a debt of about $1.3 billion. Kingfisher
said Jan. 19 it’s in talks with potential investors including SC
Lowy Financial Services.  India may soon let airlines import jet kerosene directly to
save on local sales taxes as high as 30 percent, the Civil
Aviation Ministry said in a Feb. 16 statement.  In November, chiefs of Indian carriers met Prime Minister
 Manmohan Singh  as they sought government assistance to stem
industry losses. The nation’s airlines will probably lose $2.5
billion in the year ending March, according to CAPA.  Kingfisher had a fleet of 64 planes ranging from ATR
turboprops to Airbus A330s as of Dec. 31, according to a Feb. 15
company statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
