Spain ’s government hasn’t decided
whether it will sell state-owned airports’ operator Aena
Aeropuertos SA in one go or gradually, Public Works Minister Ana Pastor told  ABC  newspaper in an interview.  The government is assessing the viability of each airport
operated by Aena, Pastor told ABC.  Spain will enact new rules to implement European
legislation guaranteeing air passengers’ rights in the case of a
bankruptcy such as with Spanair SA, Pastor told the newspaper.  Pastor also said the government will support Spain’s
highway operators to avoid any default.  To contact the reporter on this story:
