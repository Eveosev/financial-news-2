A delegation of  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) 
employees will start discussions with counterparts at  T-Mobile
USA  tomorrow on the topic of workers’ rights violations,
 Germany ’s Ver.di trade union said in a statement today.  Deutsche Telekom and AT&T Inc. in December called off a
deal to sell T-Mobile USA to the U.S. phone company after
concluding it would be too difficult to overcome opposition from
regulators.  To contact the reporter on this story:
