Dutch greenhouse growers will keep a
reduced  energy tax  on natural gas in 2013 and 2014 after
approval from the European Commission, the European Union’s
executive arm, the Netherlands’ Economy Ministry said.  In exchange for reduced taxation, Dutch greenhouses have an
annual ceiling on allowed carbon dioxide emissions, the ministry
said in an online  statement  today.  The costs of the measure to the Dutch state will be 184
million euros ($240 million) over the two-year period, according
to the statement.  “The greenhouse industry has been facing difficult
conditions for a couple of years,” Dutch Agriculture Minister
Sharon Dijksma said in statement. “The extension of the reduced
gas price is a major support for horticulturists.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
