India ’s rupee gained the most in a
week on speculation exporters converted overseas earnings and
after global funds pumped money into local stocks.  The currency strengthened a second day after overseas
investors  bought  $1.1 billion more Indian shares than they sold
this month through Jan. 7, adding to net purchases of $24.5
billion in 2012, exchange data show.  The rupee advanced 0.5 percent to 54.7550 per dollar in
Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Exporters looked to sell the greenback around 55.10 rupees
amid “consistent demand for dollars from oil importers,” said
Sudarshan Bhatt, chief currency trader at state-run  Corporation
Bank  in Mumbai.  One-month implied volatility in the rupee, a gauge of
expected moves in exchange rates used to price options, rose 14
basis points, or 0.14 percentage point, to 9.76 percent.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 55.82 per
dollar, compared with 56.01 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 55.78 versus 55.98. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
