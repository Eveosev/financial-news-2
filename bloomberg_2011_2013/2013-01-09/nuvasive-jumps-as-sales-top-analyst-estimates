NuVasive Inc. (NUVA) , a maker of devices to
treat spinal problems, jumped the most since October after
forecasting 2013 sales that would beat analyst estimates.  NuVasive climbed 10 percent to $17.39 at 9:50 a.m.  New York 
time, after rising to $18.05 for the biggest intraday increase
since Oct. 24. The San Diego-based company said in a statement
today that it expects revenue this year of $655 million. That
would be higher than the $638.3 million average estimate of 22
analysts compiled by Bloomberg. NuVasive said sales in 2012 were
about $619 million, also topping analyst predictions.  The company has struggled with departures in its sales
force and reported one of its biggest-ever quarter-over-quarter
revenue declines in October,  Glenn Novarro , a New York-based RBC
Capital Markets analyst, said in a research note before the
company announcement. NuVasive seems to be solving the issues,
said the analyst, who upgraded the company’s shares today.  “We had a sense that things were back on track, but these
results are certainly much better than we expected,” Novarro
said in a telephone interview. “They went out and aggressively
built back the sales force.”  NuVasive will report final  results  for 2012 on Feb. 26
after the close of New York trading, the company said in its
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
