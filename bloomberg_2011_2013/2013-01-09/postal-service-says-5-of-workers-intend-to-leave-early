About 5 percent of the U.S.  Postal
Service ’s 525,000 employees tentatively accepted an offer to
leave as the agency tries to cut costs.  About 26,000 workers indicated they will take the offer of
$15,000 apiece to retire early, and an additional 352 are
resigning, Mark Saunders, a Postal Service spokesman, said today
in an e-mail. The service, which lost $15.9 billion last year,
is trying to cut costs so it can keep paying its employees and
deliver mail.  The service won’t know until March 4 how many of its
employees take the offer, Saunders said.  The service, based in Washington, in October offered the
early-retirement incentives to American Postal Workers Union
members who met age and years-of-service requirements. About
115,000 employees were eligible to take it, meaning about a
fourth of them signed up.  The Postal Service has said it won’t have enough cash by
October to make required payments. It’s seeking congressional
action before that to allow it to make cuts such as ending
Saturday mail delivery.  To contact the reporter on this story:
