Wheat futures fell for a second day
after  France  raised its stockpiles outlook by 17 percent from a
December estimate.  France will have 2.29 million metric tons of soft wheat in
storage on June 30, up from 1.96 million tons forecast last
month, the crops office, known as FranceAgriMer, said today.
Through yesterday, prices in Chicago plunged 13 percent since
the end of November, partly on expectations for larger global
stockpiles.  “The French farm office raised their ending stocks for
wheat and maize just a little while ago,” Mike Zuzolo, the
president of Global Commodity Analytics in Lafayette,  Indiana ,
said in an e-mail.  Wheat futures for March delivery slid 0.4 percent to $7.475
a bushel at 11:04 a.m. on the  Chicago  Board of Trade. The price
on Jan. 4 fell to $7.3975, the lowest in six months.  Investment funds tracking commodity indexes may be selling
agriculture holdings as weightings shift for the Standard &
Poor’s GSCI and Dow Jones-UBS Commodity gauges, Louise Gartner,
the owner of Spectrum Commodities in Beavercreek,  Ohio , said by
telephone.  “The index funds are rebalancing, which includes selling a
lot of Chicago wheat,” she said. “There’s been huge fund
liquidation over the last month, but the first of the year is
mostly index fund portfolio rebalancing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
