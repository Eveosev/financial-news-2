Malaysia’s exports rebounded at a
stronger pace than economists estimated in November as shipments
of electronics and petroleum products increased.  Overseas shipments  gained 3.3 percent from a year earlier
after declining 3.2 percent in October, the Trade Ministry said
in a statement today. The median of 16 estimates in a Bloomberg
News  survey  was for 2.3 percent growth.  The World Bank last month raised its outlook for emerging
East Asia nations, citing  China ’s recovery, even as the export-
dependent region faces risks from  Europe ’s protracted sovereign
debt crisis. Malaysia’s economic growth has exceeded 5 percent
in the five quarters through September, underscoring the central
bank’s decision to keep interest rates unchanged since July 2011.  “There is an expectation of a marginal pick-up in global
trade,” Suhaimi Ilias, an economist at Maybank Investment Bank
in Kuala Lumpur, said before the report. “For the whole of 2013,
 Malaysia ’s exports will slightly improve from last year.”  Imports climbed 4.3 percent in November from a year earlier,
after gaining 5.7 percent the previous month, today’s report
showed. The trade surplus narrowed to 9.3 billion ringgit ($3.1
billion) from 9.6 billion ringgit in October.  The government expects trade to grow 5 percent this year,
Bernama news service said this week, citing International Trade
and Industry Minister Mustapa Mohamed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
