Indian (SENSEX)  stock-index futures swung
between gains and losses before the beginning of the earnings
reporting season and the release of monthly industrial output
data this week.  SGX S&P CNX Nifty Index futures  for January delivery gained
0.1 percent to 6,050 at 10:06 a.m. in Singapore after dropping
as much as 0.3 percent. The underlying S&P CNX Nifty Index on
the National Stock Exchange of  India  Ltd. climbed 0.2 percent to
6,001.70 yesterday. The BSE India Sensitive Index, or Sensex,
added 0.3 percent to 19,742.52. The Bank of  New York  Mellon
India ADR Index of U.S.-traded shares lost 1.4 percent, the
biggest drop since Nov. 7.  Infosys Ltd. (INFO) , India’s second-largest software exporter,
begins the earnings season for Sensex companies on Jan. 11,
announcing results for the three months ended Dec. 31. The
government releases industrial production figures for November
on the same day.  “We can expect the market to be volatile for this
remaining week,” Rakesh Goyal, senior vice president at Bonanza
Portfolio Ltd., wrote in an e-mail. “There is a resistance zone
of 6,050-6,100 from where the  Nifty (NIFTY)  has seen steep falls in the
past and hence some profit-booking may be seen from these
levels.”  Financial Stocks  Infosys’s net income for the quarter ended Dec. 31 may be
22.45 billion rupees ($408 million), according to the median
estimate of 28 analysts in a Bloomberg survey. That compares
with profit of 23.7 billion rupees in the same quarter last
year.  Industrial output  may have expanded 0.4 percent in
November, according to the median estimate of 20 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Production grew 8.2 percent in October,
the fastest pace in more than a year.  Global funds bought a net $110 million of Indian equities
on Jan. 7, a seventh consecutive day of purchases, exchange data
showed yesterday. The Sensex rallied 26 percent in 2012, its
 biggest annual gain  since 2009, as policy measures to revive an
 economy  expanding at the slowest pace in three years lured
foreigners to invest a net $24.5 billion into shares, the
highest among 10 Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg.  Bank of India  shares may be active after Deutsche Bank AG
upgraded the stock to buy from hold and raised its 12-month
target price today by 44 percent to 455 rupees. The lender is
the “best turnaround candidate” among the nation’s financial
stocks this year, the bank said in a report today. The shares
closed at 365.05 rupees yesterday.  Deutsche Bank also raised its target prices on Axis Bank
Ltd.,  Bank of Baroda , ICICI Bank, Punjab National Bank and
Shriram Transport Finance Ltd. Earnings will grow an average 21
percent this year on an expected 100 basis-point cut in the
benchmark  interest rate  by the  Reserve Bank  of India, according
to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
