Renaissance Capital, the Russian
investment bank controlled by billionaire  Mikhail Prokhorov ,
named Evgueni Konovalenko as head of Russian equities following
the departure of co-head Will Abbott.  Abbott left to pursue other opportunities, a Moscow-based
bank spokeswoman said in an e-mailed statement today. Abbott,
who had previously headed equity-sales trading at  Deutsche Bank
AG (DBK)  in Moscow, confirmed by telephone he had left, while
declining to elaborate. Konovalenko and Abbott were appointed
joint heads of equities in Russia and the Commonwealth of
Independent States in October.  Prokhorov’s Onexim Group agreed to buy Renaissance Capital
Ltd. in November as Stephen Jennings handed over control of the
investment bank he founded 17 years ago. Prokhorov is seeking to
turn around the fortunes of a bank that closed operations in
China,  India , Kazakhstan and Ukraine last year in a bid to halve
costs and personnel. RenCap,  Russia ’s largest organizer of
equity sales in 2010, slumped to eighth last year, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
