Ethanol gained the most in two weeks
against gasoline as production costs increased.  The grain-based additive discount to gasoline  narrowed  to
54.89 cents a gallon, based on prompt-month contracts for both
commodities, from 57.44 cents yesterday, the biggest contraction
since Dec. 21 and the narrowest since Dec. 25.  “The corn market recovered slightly today,” said Michael Breitenbach, an analyst and trader at Blue Ocean Brokerage LLC
in New York. “That is driving most of the strength in ethanol,
despite weakness in gasoline.”  Denatured ethanol for February delivery rose 1 cent, or 0.5
percent, to settle at $2.23 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of
Trade, the highest since Dec. 18. Prices have fallen 1.2 percent
in the past year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago added 1.25
cents, or 0.6 percent, to $2.20 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf
the biofuel increased 0.75 cent, or 0.3 percent, to $2.25, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Ethanol in  New York  slipped 0.5 cent to $2.285 a gallon and
on the West Coast the additive was unchanged at $2.335.  Corn for March delivery advanced 5.5 cents, or 0.8 percent,
to $6.9425 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  Based on March contracts for corn and ethanol, producers
are losing 27 cents on each gallon of the fuel made, up from 26
cents yesterday, according to data collected by Bloomberg. The
figures exclude the revenue that can be made from the sale of
dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol production that
can be fed to livestock.  Motor Fuel  Gasoline for February delivery fell 1.55 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $2.7789 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is
made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to filling
stations.  Prices for the motor fuel declined after the Energy
Department reported that  stockpiles  rose 7.41 million barrels to
233.1 million in the week ended Jan. 4, the highest level since
Feb. 25, 2011.  Ethanol also gained after the report showed  inventories 
fell 1.8 percent to 19.9 million barrels, a five-week low and
the third straight stocks drop, the longest streak since the
period ended July 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
