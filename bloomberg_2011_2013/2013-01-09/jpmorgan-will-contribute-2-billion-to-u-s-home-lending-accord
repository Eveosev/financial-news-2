JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the largest
U.S. bank, will pay borrowers $2 billion in the form of mortgage
relief and direct cash payments to settle home-loan abuse claims
with regulators.  The bank will make a cash payment of $753 million and set
aside $1.2 billion toward foreclosure prevention efforts as part
of an $8.5 billion deal with 10 banks and their regulators
announced Jan. 7, JPMorgan said in a regulatory filing today.  JPMorgan will take a $700 million pretax charge in the
fourth quarter related to the settlement, according to the New
York-based lender. Itâ€™s scheduled to report earnings Jan. 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
