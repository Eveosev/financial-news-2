Japanese  shares  advanced, with the
 Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  halting a two-day decline, as the yen
dropped against all its major counterparts, boosting the outlook
for exporters.  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , a carmaker that gets 81 percent of its
sales outside Japan, rose 1.6 percent. Gakken Holdings Co.
surged 34 percent, leading gains among education-related shares,
on a report individuals may receive a tax exemption on money
left for their grandchildren’s schooling. Furukawa-Sky Aluminum
Corp. added 4.1 percent after industry bellwether Alcoa Inc.’s
sales rose more than expected to open U.S. earnings season.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average advanced 0.5 percent to
10,555.01 at the close in Tokyo after dropping as much as 1
percent. The broader  Topix (TPX)  Index rose 0.8 percent to 879.05,
reversing losses after the yen weakened to as low as 87.55
against the dollar.  “Japanese stocks are highly sensitive to the yen’s level
and today’s market is a prime example,” said Fumio Matsumoto, a
 fund manager  who helps oversee about 73 billion yen ($834
million) in Japanese equities at T&D Asset Management Co. “The
yen trading near 90 per dollar will lift corporate earnings.”  The Topix has risen 22 percent since Nov. 14 when elections
were announced, driving the gauge into a  bull market  on
expectations a new government would call for more stimulus. An
advance of 20 percent or more from a low signals a bull market
to some investors. The gauge is trading at 1.04 times book
value, compared with 2.19 for the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1) 
and 1.58 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  BOJ Chief  Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, commenting
today on the selection of the next  Bank of Japan  governor, said
candidates should understand the need for bold monetary easing.
Governor Masaaki Shirakawa ends his five-year term on April 8.  Exporters gained as the yen fell against all 16 of its
major peers. A weaker yen boosts the value of overseas earnings
for Japanese companies.  Honda gained 1.6 percent to 3,250 yen.  Fanuc Corp. (6954) , the
world’s biggest maker of factory automation systems, added 1
percent to 15,860 yen.  Futures on the  S&P 500 Index  added 0.1 percent today. The
gauge dropped 0.3 percent yesterday as investors awaited results
from Alcoa Inc. to kick off corporate earnings season.  Furukawa-Sky Aluminum Corp. added 4.1 percent to 256 yen
after Alcoa, the largest U.S. aluminum producer, rose in after-
hours trading as sales beat estimates.  Education stocks jumped after  Kyodo News  reported the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party is weighing a  tax exemption  on
gifts of as much as 15 million yen to provide for
grandchildren’s schooling.  Gakken, TAC  Gakken, a publisher of educational books and magazines,
soared 34 percent to 317 yen, its  biggest jump  on record. TAC
Co., which runs preparatory courses for professional
certificates, surged 33 percent to 200 yen, also the biggest
increase ever.  Shares fell earlier after technical indicators signaled the
market may have been overbought. The 25-day  Toraku index , which
compares the number of stocks that have advanced with the number
that have declined on the Topix, was at 136 yesterday. A reading
above 120 indicates to some investors shares may be poised to
fall.  Toho Co., a movie studio and theater operator, gained 4.6
percent to 1,596 yen after announcing it would buy back shares
and raise a planned dividend.  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  added 1.9 percent
to 19.42, indicating traders expect a swing of about 5.6 percent
on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
