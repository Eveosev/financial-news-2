Japan ’s  Defense Ministry  requested
212 billion yen ($2.4 billion) in Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s
stimulus package, as the country seeks to maintain control of
islands also claimed by an increasingly assertive  China .  Included in the request are funds for extra PAC-3 missile
interceptors and upgrades for F-15 fighter planes, according to
a document distributed by the ministry. Abe, who vowed to boost
funding for the military and coast guard upon taking office last
month, will finalize on Jan. 11 about 12 trillion yen in extra
spending for the year ending in March.  Japan dispatched eight F-15 fighters in response to an
incursion last month by a Chinese plane into Japanese-controlled
airspace around the islands, known as Senkaku in Japanese and
Diaoyu in Chinese. Chinese government ships have repeatedly
entered Japanese-controlled waters in recent months and been
warned off by the Coast Guard, and Japan yesterday summoned
China’s ambassador to  Tokyo  to protest an incursion this week.  The dispute over the uninhabited islands in the  East China
Sea  was reignited in September when the Japanese government
bought three of them from a private Japanese landowner, sparking
violent demonstrations in China and damaging a $340 billion
trade relationship.  The extra funding would come on top of the defense budget
of 4.6 trillion yen for the year to March 2013. The ministry
will also seek to raise next year’s defense budget by about 120
billion yen, reversing the downward trend of the last decade.  To contact the reporters on this story:
