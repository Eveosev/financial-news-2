Washington Redskins quarterback
Robert Griffin III had two right-knee ligaments surgically
repaired today.  James Andrews, the surgeon who performed the operation,
said in a statement on the National Football League team’s
website that Griffin had a “direct repair” of the lateral
collateral ligament and a “re-do” of previous surgery on the
anterior cruciate ligament.  “We expect a full recovery and it is everybody’s hope and
belief that due to Robert’s high motivation, he will be ready
for the 2013 season,” Andrews said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
