Mota-Engil SGPS SA (EGL)  aims to end this
year with an order book exceeding the 3.5 billion euros ($4.58
billion) forecast for 2012 as it expands outside Portugal, said
the new chief of the country’s biggest construction company.  “We will work for that,” Goncalo Martins, whose
appointment as CEO of the Oporto-based company was announced on
Jan. 7, said in an e-mailed response to questions.  Mota-Engil is among local builders expanding in  emerging
markets  in  Africa  and  Latin America  as Portugal cuts spending to
comply with terms of a 78 billion-euro emergency aid program.
The company operates in about 20 countries.  “One of the pillars of Mota-Engil’s development is its
internationalization and this will remain a priority goal for
the group,” Martins said.  Mota-Engil forecasts sales will rise to 3.15 billion euros
in 2015 from 2.18 billion euros in 2011 and that more than 70
percent of revenue will come from outside  Portugal , according to
its 2013-2015  strategic plan  announced on Aug. 31.  While the main guidelines of the plan should remain, there
is room for “adaptations” if new business opportunities arise,
Martins said.  Mota-Engil isn’t looking to buy any companies this year
after announcing on Nov. 25 that it agreed to  acquire  a majority
stake in Empresa Construtora Brasil SA for 52.6 million reais
($25.8 million).  “Beyond the acquisition in Brazil, our strategic plan does
not forecast acquisitions for 2013 and the group will bet on the
organic growth of its existing units in each business and
market,” Martins said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
