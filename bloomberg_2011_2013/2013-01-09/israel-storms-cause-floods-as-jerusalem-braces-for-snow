Israel ’s heaviest rainstorms in more
than two decades have caused flooding that closed roads and
damaged property throughout the country, as  Jerusalem  residents
brace for as much as 30 centimeters (1 foot) of snow.  Jerusalem closed its schools at noon today and the
municipality advised drivers to stay off the roads unless
absolutely necessary. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended
a meeting with Internal Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovich
and police officials to assess disaster preparedness efforts.  “Emergency and rescue services are working around the
clock to save lives,” Netanyahu said in a text message sent
from his office in Jerusalem.  The storm cost Israeli industry about 300 million shekels
($80 million) yesterday, with half of it attributed to
absenteeism as people were prevented from reaching work by
roadblocks set up by police due to flooding, the Manufacturers
Association of Israel said in an e-mailed statement.  Tel Aviv’s main Ayalon highway remained open today after
closing for several hours yesterday due to water overflows.
Military helicopters were used yesterday to rescue people
stranded on rooftops by flooding in three towns in central
Israel, the army said.  “Several roads in the north and center of the country near
streams have closed due to flooding, as has the highway along
the Dead Sea,” police spokesman  Micky Rosenfeld  said by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
