U.S. ethanol production advanced 2.4
percent last week to 826,000 barrels a day, the Energy
Department said.  Output jumped the most since Nov. 30 and climbed to the
highest level in two weeks while  stockpiles  declined 1.8 percent
to 19.9 million barrels, a five-week low, according to a
department report today. It was the third straight inventory
drop, the longest streak since the period ended July 6.  Imports sank 40 percent to 52,000 barrels a day from 87,000
the previous week, the department said. Ethanol-blended gasoline
made up about 84 percent of the total U.S. gasoline pool, the
smallest share since June 3, 2011.  Denatured ethanol for February delivery rose 0.5 cent, or
0.2 percent, to $2.225 a gallon at 10 a.m. local time on the
Chicago Board of Trade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
