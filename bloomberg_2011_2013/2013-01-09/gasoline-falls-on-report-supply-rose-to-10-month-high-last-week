Gasoline fell after the industry-
funded  American Petroleum Institute  said that  inventories  of the
motor fuel jumped to a 10-month high last week.  Futures sank after yesterday’s API report, which showed a
7.93 million-barrel increase in the week ended Jan. 4. The
Energy Department will probably report today that stockpiles
climbed 2.5 million barrels, according to the median estimate of
11 analysts in a survey by Bloomberg. Refinery utilization rose
0.25 percentage point to 90.7 percent, according to the survey.  “The decline is clearly indicative of the nearly 8
million-barrel build,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil
Associates LLC in Houston. “The key thing to watch is if
refinery utilization remains about 5 percentage points above
last year, which indicates that refiners continue to turn crude
surplus into a product surplus.”  Gasoline for February delivery fell 2.27 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $2.7717 a gallon at 9:50 a.m. on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange, the first decline in three days.  The API reported that  inventories  of distillates, including
heating oil and diesel, rose 5.85 million barrels. The survey
projected the Energy Department will report at 10:30 a.m. today
in  Washington  that distillate stockpiles increased 1.9 million.  Heating oil gained on speculation that refinery unit
shutdowns may limit distillate supplies and that higher gasoil
prices in Europe will attract diesel shipments from the U.S.  Motiva Repairs  Motiva Enterprises LLC expects to take at least a week to
repair a recurring leak on the 325,000-barrel-a-day crude unit
at its Port Arthur, Texas, refinery, a person familiar with
operations said yesterday.  Gasoil for January delivery, which expires today, rose
$6.25, or 0.7 percent, to $951.5 a metric ton on the ICE Futures
 Europe  exchange in  London . Prices touched $952.25, the highest
intraday level since Dec. 3.  “Heating oil is probably being drawn up by the gasoil in
Europe,” Lipow said. “But, given the API stats, the market is
going to wait to see if the DOE confirms those very large builds
in product inventories.”  Heating oil for February delivery rose 0.63 cent to $3.0648
a gallon, the third consecutive increase.  The average nationwide  retail price  for regular gasoline
gained 0.4 cent to $3.304 a gallon, AAA said today on its
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
