Gold declined for the second time in
three days in  New York  as a stronger dollar eroded appeal of the
precious metal as an alternative investment.  The dollar rose as much as 0.4 percent against a basket of
six major currencies as investors awaited tomorrow’s  European
Central Bank  meeting. Gold slid to a four-month low on Jan. 4
after minutes from the  Federal Reserve  indicated that policy
makers may end $85 billion in monthly bond purchases this year.  “It’s the dollar that’s keeping the market under pressure
today,”  David Meger , the director of metal trading at Vision
Financial Markets in Chicago, said in a telephone interview.
“There is also some nervousness about the Fed statement.”  Gold futures for February delivery fell 0.4 percent to
settle at $1,655.50 an ounce at 1:39 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. The metal climbed 7 percent last year, a 12th straight
annual gain, as the Fed increased its asset purchases.  Prices earlier rose as much as 0.2 percent, climbing above
the 200-day moving average near $1,663.22. The move is a bullish
signal to some analysts who study historical price patterns.  Silver futures for March delivery fell 0.7 percent to
$30.249 an ounce, declining for the first time in three days.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
April delivery gained 1.1 percent to $1,600 an ounce.  Palladium futures for March delivery jumped 3 percent to
$688.20 an ounce, the biggest gain for a most-active contract
since Nov. 13.  To contact the reporters on this story:
