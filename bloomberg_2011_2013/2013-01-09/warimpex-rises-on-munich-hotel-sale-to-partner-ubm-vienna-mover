Warimpex Finanz und Beteiligungs AG ,
the Austrian hotel developer selling assets, rose in Vienna and
Warsaw after it agreed to sell a 50 percent stake in Munich’s
Angelo hotel to its co-investor.  Warimpex  rose as much as 4.4 percent , trading 3.6 percent
higher at 1.01 euros by 1:42 p.m. in the Austrian capital with
more than twice as many shares changing hands than the three-
month average. The shares, which have risen by a third in the
last three months, were heading to the highest level since April
30. They were up 2.7 percent at 4.21 zloty in Warsaw.  “Profitable asset sales are the key trigger for
Warimpex,” said Christoph Thurnberger, an analyst at Raiffeisen
Centrobank in Vienna, who  rates Warimpex  hold.  Warimpex agreed to sell its stake in Angelo, a 146-room
design hotel that opened in 2008, to  UBM Realitaetenenwicklung
AG (UBS) , which already owned half of it before, it said in a
statement today. A development plot adjacent to the hotel is
also part of the deal. Warimpex and UBM said they wouldn’t
disclose the purchase price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
