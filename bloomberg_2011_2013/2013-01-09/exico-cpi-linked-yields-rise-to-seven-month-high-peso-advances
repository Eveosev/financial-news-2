Mexico ’s inflation-linked bonds fell,
pushing yields to a seven-month high, as the pace of consumer
price increases slowed to within the central bank’s target range
for the first time since May.  Yields on the bonds known as Udibonos due in 2014 increased
six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 1.21 percent at
9:21 a.m. in Mexico City, the highest on a closing basis since
May 24, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The peso
advanced 0.5 percent to 12.7382 per  U.S. dollar .  Demand for Udibonos dropped after the government reported
today that annual inflation slowed to 3.57 percent in December,
below the 4 percent upper end of the central bank’s target
range. Consumer prices increased 4.18 percent from a year
earlier in the prior month.  “Udis are particularly sensitive to the monthly inflation
prints,”  Siobhan Morden , the head of Latin America fixed-income
strategy at Jefferies Group Inc., said in a phone interview from
 New York . “The inflation risks are receding.”  Inflation-linked bond yields fell to as low as 0.07 percent
in July as a bird-flu outbreak and drought pushed up egg,
poultry and grain costs. The annual inflation rate for December
was the slowest since April.  Yields on fixed-rate peso bonds maturing in December 2013
fell two basis points to 4.59 percent today. The price increased
0.01 centavo to 103.13 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporters on this story:
