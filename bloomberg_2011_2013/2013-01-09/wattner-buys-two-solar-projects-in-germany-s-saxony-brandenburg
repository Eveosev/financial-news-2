Wattner AG, a German solar-energy
investor, said it bought two projects in the country for about
26 million euros ($34 million).  Wattner, which didn’t identify the seller, acquired a 8.1-
megawatt solar park in Saxony and a 7.3-megawatt plant in
Brandenburg, it said today in a statement. Both were built last
year, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
