Oil was little changed after a
government report showed that U.S. crude and fuel inventories
surged while equities gained on economic optimism.  Futures fell 5 cents after the Department of Energy said
 crude stockpiles  rose 1.31 million barrels to 361.3 million and
output reached the highest level since 1993. The combined gain
of crude, gasoline and distillate supplies was 15.5 million
barrels, the most since 1996. Oil rebounded from the session’s
lows as the Standard & Poor’s 500 snapped a two-day slide.  “There’s a significant supply overhang in the market,”
said Adam Wise, who helps manage a $9 billion natural-resource
bond portfolio as managing director at Manulife Asset Management
in  Boston . “In a benign news environment, it will be harder to
ignore the fundamentals of the oil market.”  Crude oil for February delivery settled at $93.10 a barrel
on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Trading volume was 9.2
percent below the 100-day average. The daily move was the fifth
in a row of 20 cents or less, the first time that’s happened
since 2002. Oil is up 1 cent this week.  Brent oil for February settlement declined 18 cents to
$111.76 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. Volume was 25 percent above the 100-day average.  Last week’s increase in inventories was less than the gain
of  2 million barrels  that was the median estimate of 11 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Surging Production  Crude output  climbed 0.2 percent to 7 million barrels a day
last week, the highest level since 1993, the report showed.
Production has increased 17 of the last 18 weeks. The nation
will pump 7.92 million barrels a day in 2014, the department
said yesterday in the monthly  Short-Term Energy Outlook .  The S&P 500 rose on optimism that U.S. corporate earnings
will extend third straight year of growth after  Alcoa Inc. (AA) 
unofficially began the U.S. earnings reporting season yesterday
with better-than-estimated sales.  Futures surged to $93.87 a barrel on Jan. 2 in New York,
the highest intraday level since Sept. 19, following a budget
compromise in  Washington  that averted most of the so-called
fiscal cliff of spending cuts and tax gains. The S&P 500 also
increased on the agreement, reaching a five-year high last week.  Imports of crude oil rose 18 percent to 8.34 million
barrels a day, the first gain in four weeks. U.S. imports in
2012 averaged 8.65 million barrels, according to weekly
department data, which would be the lowest level since 1997.  ‘Remarkable Increase’  “Crude oil supplies continue to rise with the remarkable
increase in U.S. production,” said Tim Evans, an energy analyst
at Citi Futures Perspective in New York. “This is making us
less reliant on imports overall. The barrels that would have
come here are now available, so U.S. output is having an impact
on global supply.”  Increasing output in the U.S. and  Canada  has bolstered
supplies at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for West Texas
Intermediate crude, the grade traded in New York. Stockpiles at
the hub rose 332,000 barrels to a record 50.1 million in the
seven days ended Jan. 4.  The discount of WTI to Brent narrowed to $18.66 from $18.79
yesterday. The spread has slipped from $25.53 on Nov. 15 as
 Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD)  and  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  prepare to
resume service this week on the 500-mile (805-kilometer) Seaway
pipeline to full rates after boosting its capacity to 400,000
barrels a day from 150,000. The link connects Cushing to
refineries in the Houston area.  Narrowing Spread  “The most interesting energy story of recent weeks has
been the reduction of the WTI-Brent spread,” Wise said.
“Ramping up the Seaway pipeline to 400,000 barrels a day will
alleviate the bottleneck at Cushing and put further pressure on
the differential.”  Gasoline inventories  climbed 7.41 million barrels to 233.1
million, versus an expected gain of 2.5 million. Distillate
inventories increased 6.78 million barrels to 130.7 million,
versus a forecast advance of 1.9 million.  Total  fuel consumption  dropped 1.4 percent to 18.9 million
barrels a day in the four weeks ended Jan. 4, the report showed.
Gasoline demand fell 1.4 percent over the period to 8.44 million
barrels a day, the least since March.  “Both product demand and inventories are very bearish,”
Evans said.  Refineries operated at 89.1 percent of capacity last week,
the report showed, down from 90.4 percent the previous week.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 387,446
contracts as of 2:51 p.m. Volume totaled 454,577 contracts
yesterday, 6.1 percent below the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.48 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
