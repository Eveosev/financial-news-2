Afghanistan ’s President Hamid Karzai
met with senators today at the U.S. Capitol during a visit that
will include a meeting with President  Barack Obama  on Jan. 11.  With Congress on a break, Karzai met privately with a small
group of senators from both parties who were in town, including
Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of  Kentucky  and first-
term Democratic Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia.  Asked by reporters what he expects to bring home from his
trip, Karzai said, “I hope we get back for Afghanistan what
Afghans expect of me to take back to them.”  He declined to comment on how many troops he hopes the U.S.
will keep in his country after 2014, when Obama has pledged to
bring most of them home.  To contact the reporter on this story:
