Mainstream Renewable Power Ltd., a
closely held Irish clean-energy developer, is seeking
environmental permits to develop a $240 million wind farm in
 Chile â€™s southern Bio Bio region.  The Alena wind project will include as many as 43 turbines
with a total capacity of 107.5 megawatts, Dublin-based
Mainstream said today in a  filing  with environmental licensing
agency Servicio de Evaluacion Ambiental. The project includes
21.4 kilometers (13.3 miles) of  power lines  and a substation.  Work on the wind farm is expected to start Nov. 30,
according to the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
