Corruption shaved about 5 percent, or
17 billion euros ($22 billion), from  Austria ’s economy in 2012,
according to a study by the opposition  Green Party .  The party published today a 398-page review of documents
and testimony collected last year by a parliamentary corruption
panel that investigated abuses among Austrian businesses and
politicians. The country slid nine levels to No. 25 in the
latest Transparency International corruption-perceptions index
released last month.  Austria, which produced about 320 billion euros of goods
and services in 2012, was criticized in a report released
 yesterday  by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development for lax bribery investigations and bank rules. The
country hasn’t convicted a citizen of foreign bribery since
ratifying the Anti-Bribery Convention in 1999, the OECD said.  Parliamentary investigations have focused on improprieties
at Telekom Austria AG, the country’s former phone monopoly, as
well as state-owned real-estate and infrastructure companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
