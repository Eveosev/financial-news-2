John Isner , the highest-ranked
American men’s tennis player, pulled out of the  Australian Open 
starting next week because of a knee injury.  Isner, who was seeded 12th at the season-opening Grand Slam
tennis tournament in Melbourne, lost his opening round match
yesterday at the Sydney International 6-4, 6-4 to compatriot
 Ryan Harrison . Afterwards, he told reporters he’d been
struggling with a bone bruise on his knee.  “Doctors have told me that continuing to play on the knee
could result in a more serious injury,” Isner said today in
comments released by Australian Open organizers.  The two-week tournament starts Jan. 14.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
