Most Chinese  stocks  fell as declines
for industrial companies and utilities overshadowed gains by
liquor makers.  Zoomlion Heavy Industry Science and Technology Co.  sank 3.2
percent as it denied a Ming Pao Daily report questioning the
company’s sales.  Huaneng Power International Inc. (600011)  slid 3.7
percent as utility valuations traded near a four-month high.
 Ping An Insurance (Group) Co. (601318)  fell after the South  China  Morning
Post said the government is poised to reject HSBC Holdings Plc’s
sale of a stake in the company.  Kweichow Moutai Co. (600519)  led a
consumer-staples index to the highest since November.  About five stocks dropped for every four that gained in the
 Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) , which fell less than 0.1 percent to
2,275.34 at the close after changing directions at least 20
times. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  rose less than 0.1 percent to 2,526.13.  “Some investors are taking profits from the market as the
rally has already generated good returns for them,” said  Wang Zheng , the Shanghai-based chief investment officer at Jingxi
Investment Management Co., which manages $120 million. “The
correction will be mild and the market will come back amid the
backdrop of an economic recovery.”  The Shanghai Composite has surged 16 percent from an almost
four-year low on Dec. 3, while the CSI 300 has climbed 19.8
percent, on signs economic growth is picking up. The Shanghai
gauge trades at 12.6 times reported earnings, approaching the
highest level since June, according to daily data compiled by
Bloomberg since 2006.  Economic Data  Trade figures tomorrow may show  export  growth accelerated
to 5 percent in December from 2.9 percent the previous month,
while a Jan. 11 report may indicate inflation quickened to 2.3
percent, according to economist surveys by Bloomberg. New  yuan 
 loans  probably dropped 14 percent last month from a year
earlier, data due by Jan. 15 may show.  Average trading volumes in the Shanghai Composite were up
25 percent from the 30-day average. The index’s 14-day  relative
strength index , measuring how rapidly prices have advanced or
dropped during a specified time period, was at 74.5 today.
Readings above 70 indicate a price may be poised to fall,
according to some traders.  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index climbed 0.9 percent
today. The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) , the measure of the most-
traded U.S.-listed Chinese companies, fell 1.2 percent in  New
York  yesterday.  The possibility of a cut in the reserve-requirement ratio
is increasing for January as reverse-repurchase agreements
mature this month, the official Xinhua News Agency reported
yesterday, citing “most industry insiders” it didn’t identify.  Accounting Concern  Zoomlion, the nation’s second-biggest maker of construction
equipment, sank 3.2 percent, the most since Nov. 8, to 8.90
yuan. Allegations about its financial results detailed in Ming
Pao’s  report  were “false, groundless and misleading,” the
company said in a statement yesterday.  Its American depositary receipts dropped the most in two
weeks in New York.  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the largest Chinese
ETF in the U.S., slid 1.8 percent yesterday, the most since Nov.
8, on renewed concern over corporate accounting practices. Liu
Xinhua, vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory
Commission, urged more crackdowns on accounting firms’
violations, the China Securities Journal reported today.  A gauge of  utility companies  slid 1.3 percent today, the
biggest decline for CSI 300’s industry groups. The index is
 valued  at 16.2 times reported earnings, near the highest level
since August, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Stake Sale  Huaneng Power, the listed unit of China’s largest power
group, slumped 3.7 percent to 6.85 yuan.  Huadian Power
International Corp. (600027) , the listed unit of the fourth largest, slid
1 percent to 3.81 yuan.  Ping An, China’s second-biggest insurer, lost 0.9 percent
to 45.07 yuan. The insurance regulator is poised to reject
Charoen Pokphand Group’s proposed $9.4 billion purchase of
HSBC’s stake in Ping An on concerns the group may not be able to
fund the acquisition, the  South China Morning Post  reported. Two
calls to the regulator’s office weren’t returned.  A  measure  of consumer-staples stocks in the CSI 300 gained
2.1 percent to the highest level since Nov. 14. Kweichow Moutai,
China’s biggest producer of baijiu liquor by market value,
climbed 2.7 percent to 216.45 yuan. The company cut supply
quotas to some retailers by 30 percent after they lowered

equipment, gained 4.7 percent to 6.66 yuan. Sungrow Power Supply
