New York  Knicks forward Carmelo Anthony will miss tonight’s game at the Indiana Pacers after
being suspended for repeatedly confronting Kevin Garnett of the
Boston Celtics following a Jan. 7 game.  The National Basketball Association said yesterday in an e-
mailed statement that Anthony, 28, had received a one-game
suspension without pay.  Anthony confronted Garnett in the Madison Square Garden
tunnel, near the players’ locker rooms and in the parking garage
following the Knicks’ 102-96 defeat, the NBA said.  “There are no circumstances in which it is acceptable for
a player to confront an opponent after a game,” Stu Jackson,
the NBA’s executive vice president of basketball operations,
said in the statement. “Anthony attempted to engage with Kevin
Garnett multiple times after Monday’s game and therefore a
suspension was warranted.”  Both Anthony and Garnett received technical fouls in the
fourth quarter of the game after they pushed and shoved each
other and also exchanged words.  Anthony told reporters the day after the loss that he
wasn’t seeking a physical confrontation with Garnett following
the game.  “I wanted to talk to KG,” Anthony said. “I think it was
something that we both needed to get off our chest and see what
really the problem was. No altercations, it was just some words
and a conversation that we needed to have.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
