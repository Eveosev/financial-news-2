Norway  did well to step in an end an
oil strike last year as the country needs to ensure it doesn’t
damage its reputation as a reliable oil supplier, the head of
the  International Energy Agency  said.  “It was solved, and it was very important that the
reliability was not brought into question,” Maria van der Hoeven, the energy adviser’s executive director, said today in
an interview in Oslo. “To have reliable risk management is also
part of the trust and confidence put in you.”  A strike over pay and pensions at the end of June and
beginning of July was ended by the government through forced
arbitration as a total shutdown loomed. The strike disrupted 15
percent of oil production and 7 percent of gas output, according
to Norway’s Oil Industry Association.  Norway is western Europe’s largest producer of oil and gas.
The country produced about 1.44 million barrels of oil a day in
November and 10 billion cubic meters of natural gas, according
to the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate  “Norway is very reliable, not only in oil and gas, but
also in electricity and power supply to  Europe ,” van der Hoeven
said.  The IEA, based in Paris. is an energy adviser to 28 fuel
consuming nations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
