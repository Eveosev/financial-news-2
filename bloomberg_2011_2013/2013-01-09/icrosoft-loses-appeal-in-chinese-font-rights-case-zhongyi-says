Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  lost an appeal of a
three-year-old Beijing court ruling that it exceeded the scope
of a licensing agreement for Chinese fonts, according to rights
holder  Zhongyi Electronic Ltd.   The Beijing Higher People’s Court upheld a November 2009
judgment that Microsoft infringed Zhongyi’s rights for Chinese
character fonts, the Chinese company said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday. “We respect the court’s decision but
continue to believe our fonts licensing agreement with Zhongyi
should have granted us perpetual rights to the fonts at issue,”
Microsoft said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  Microsoft, the world’s largest software maker, used the
Chinese fonts “without authorization” in Windows 98, 2000,
2003, and XP Chinese editions as well as worldwide sales of
multilanguage versions of  Windows products , Zhongyi said.  “This ruling will not impact Microsoft customers in  China 
as it pertains to older versions of Microsoft products that are
no longer available for purchase,” the Redmond, Washington-
based company said in the statement.  Calls to Zhongyi’s headquarters in Beijing weren’t
immediately answered after business hours yesterday  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
