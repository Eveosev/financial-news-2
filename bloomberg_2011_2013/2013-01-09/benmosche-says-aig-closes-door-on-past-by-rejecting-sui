American International Group Inc. (AIG) 
Chief Executive Officer  Robert Benmosche  said the insurer is
focusing on serving clients rather than engaging in legal
disputes over its 2008 bailout.  “What’s important for this board and for the  employees  of
the company is to close the door on the past and focus on the
future and continue to work with our customers,” Benmosche said
today in a phone interview.  Board members today voted to reject joining ex-CEO Maurice “Hank” Greenberg in a lawsuit against the U.S. over the $182.3
billion rescue. Greenberg said the government violated
shareholders’ rights by taking a 92 percent stake in the insurer
and pressed the New York-based company to join the suit.  “It’s something that we felt just didn’t make sense,
considering what the probabilities of success would be, and the
facts around the case in terms of what happened,” Benmosche
said. “We just don’t think this should continue and AIG should
not join it. And nor should it be done in AIG’s name.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
