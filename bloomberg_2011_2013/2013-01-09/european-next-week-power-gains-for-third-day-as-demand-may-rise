Power contracts for 2014 delivery in
 Germany  and  France  fell to record lows as European Union
emissions permits dropped.  German 2014 power, a European benchmark, lost as much as
0.4 percent while the equivalent French contract fell 0.5
percent, according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg. Carbon
allowances for December declined as much as 3.7 percent.  German baseload power, for supplies delivered around the
clock, slid 20 cents to a record 44.75 euros ($58.49) a
megawatt-hour as of 6:04 p.m. in Berlin. French year-ahead
electricity fell 25 cents to a record 47.25 euros.  EU carbon permits for December slid as much as 29 cents to
6.18 euros a metric ton on the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange in
 London , the lowest price since Dec. 5. Power can track fuel and
emissions prices, which affect the cost of production at plants
that burn fossil fuels.  Low temperatures in  Frankfurt  are forecast to decline to
minus 9 degrees Celsius (16 Fahrenheit) on Jan. 16 versus a 10-
year seasonal average of minus 1 degree, according to
CustomWeather Inc. data on Bloomberg. Minimum temperatures in
Paris are expected to fall to minus 6 degrees on Jan. 16,
compared with a 10-year average of 2 degrees.  “Colder than seasonal weather and poor renewable
availability may push prices up moderately over the next week or
so,” Paolo Coghe, an analyst at  Societe Generale SA (GLE) , said in an
e-mailed report. “This will be more like a short-term remedy
than a much needed and more long-lived support to prices as
could come from a positive shift in fundamentals.”  Demand in France, Europe’s second-biggest power market, may
reach 86,200 megawatts on Jan. 15, according to a forecast on
the  website  of Reseau de Transport d’Electricite, the network
operator. That compares with 78,451 megawatts today.  Electricite de France SA  started its 890-megawatt
Dampierre-4 nuclear reactor after an unplanned halt, French grid
operator RTE said on its website.  RWE AG (RWE)  had an unplanned halt at its 607-megawatt Neurath-D
lignite fed power plant in Germany. The unit is scheduled to
start on Jan. 11, the company said on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
