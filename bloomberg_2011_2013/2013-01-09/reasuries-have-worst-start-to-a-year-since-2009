Treasury 10-year note yields traded
close to the highest level since April before the first auction
of the securities this year after the  Federal Reserve  announced
plans to buy more debt each month to sustain the U.S. economic
recovery.  The yield on the benchmark note was little changed as the
$21 billion of the securities the government is selling drew a
pre-auction yield of 1.88 percent, which would be the highest
since April. It is the second of three debt sales this week
totaling $66 billion. Treasuries fell on Dec. 12, the date of
the previous 10-year auction, as the central bank announced it
would purchase $85 billion of government and mortgage debt a
month.  “The sentiment last week was that yields would move higher
quickly, but that has reversed,” said Jason Rogan, director of
U.S. government trading at Guggenheim Partners LLC, a New York-
based brokerage for institutional investors. “The auctions
continue to be well received. Coming out of these auctions long
with the anticipation of the Fed buying as much paper as it will
might be on people’s minds.” A long is a bet the price of a
security will rise.  Ten-year notes yielded 1.87 percent at 11:39 a.m.  New York 
time, based on Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The yield last week
jumped 20 basis points, or 0.2 percentage point, touching 1.97
percent on Jan. 4, the highest since April 26. The price of the
1.625 percent note maturing in November 2022 was 97 26/32.  The  30-year yield  was little changed at 3.07 percent after
reaching 3.18 percent on Jan. 4, highest since April 25.  Previous Sale  At the December auction of the 10-year securities,
investors bid for 2.95 times the amount of debt offered,
compared with 2.59 times in November. The notes drew a yield of
1.65 percent, compared with a  record-low  auction yield of 1.459
percent on July 11.  Direct bidders  purchased 42.7 percent, the most since 45.4
percent in July, which was a record.  Indirect bidders , the
investor class that includes foreign central banks, bought 24.2
percent of the notes, the least since April 2009.  “There’s still ample demand,” said Justin Lederer, an
interest-rate strategist in New York at Cantor Fitzgerald LP,
one of 21 primary dealers that trade with the Fed. “Treasuries
erased a lot of the losses from last week. Expectations for
rates to go significantly higher” have not been realized.  Direct Bidders  A $32 billion auction of three-year notes yesterday drew a
yield of 0.385 percent, compared with a forecast of 0.387
percent in a Bloomberg News survey of five of the Fed’s primary
dealers.  Direct bidders  purchased 26.4 percent of the notes at
the sale, topping the previous mark of 24.8 percent set in
December and the average of 14.2 percent for the past 10
auctions.  The Treasury is scheduled to conclude this week’s auctions
with a $13 billion sale of 30-year bonds tomorrow.  The difference between the yields on two-year notes and 10-
year securities, the so-called yield curve, narrowed to 1.61
percentage points, after touching 1.69 percentage points on Jan.
4, the widest since May.  The so-called yield  curve  typically narrows when investors
anticipate a slow economic recovery because they demand less
compensation for the risk of inflation.  Fed Bank of Richmond President  Jeffrey Lacker  said
yesterday the central bank’s record easing measures risk fueling
inflation after this year.  Volume Drops  “I intend to remain alert for signs that our monetary
policy stance needs adjustment,” Lacker said in a speech in
Columbia,  South Carolina . He does not vote on monetary policy
this year or next.  The Fed purchased $2.3 billion of mortgage and Treasury
debt in two separate rounds of asset purchases from 2008 to 2011
intended to stimulate the economy, known as quantitative easing.
It bought $1.546 billion of Treasuries due from February 2036 to
November 2042 today as part of its outright purchase program.  The  difference  between yields on 10-year notes and same-
maturity Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of
trader expectations for consumer prices over the life of the
debt, was 2.50 percentage points, compared with an average over
the past decade of 2.19 percentage points.  Treasury  volume  was $279 billion yesterday after touching
the most in almost four months last week, according to ICAP Plc,
the largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt . Volume
rose Jan. 4 to $404 billion, the most since Sept. 13. Daily
volume averaged $239 billion in 2012.  Treasuries have handed investors a 0.6 percent loss this
year through yesterday, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch indexes. They returned 2.2 percent in 2012, the smallest
annual return since 2009.  To contact the reporters on this story:
