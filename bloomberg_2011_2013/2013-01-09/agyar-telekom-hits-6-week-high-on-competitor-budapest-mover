Magyar Telekom Nyrt., the Hungarian
unit of  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) , rose to the highest level in six
weeks after Napi Gazdasag reported a potential state-backed
competitor lost its two top executives.  The shares advanced 2.1 percent to 396 forint by the close
in Budapest, the second-best performance in the 11-member BUX
 index , which added 1.1 percent.  Istvan Kalmar, chairman of MPVI Mobil, and Chief Executive
Officer Pal Schmidt have left the company, Napi reported,
without citing anyone. Gabor Intody, a spokesman for MPVI,
declined to comment on the report. MPVI has been fighting a
court case on a tender which it won to become  Hungary ’s fourth
mobile operator, competing with incumbents Magyar Telekom and
the units of  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  and  Telenor ASA. (TEL)   “The entry of the fourth mobile provider may be further
delayed,” Gergely Palffy, a Budapest-based analyst at  KBC Groep
NV (KBC) ’s broker unit, said in a telephone interview. “That’s
certainly behind Magyar Telekom’s gains.”  The shares have rebounded 12 percent from a record low on
Dec. 21. The stock’s 14-day  relative strength index  fell to 25
on Dec. 21, below the 30-level which signals to some analysts a
security’s slump is excessive and it may be poised for a
reversal. The RSI last traded at 58.  “The stock was oversold on a technical basis,” Palffy
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
