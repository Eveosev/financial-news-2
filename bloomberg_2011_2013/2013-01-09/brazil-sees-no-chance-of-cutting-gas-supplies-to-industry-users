Brazil ’s Energy Minister ruled out
diverting natural gas used by industry to feed thermoelectric
plants, saying power supply in Latin America’s biggest economy
is assured.  Speaking after a monthly meeting with government officials
today, Edison Lobao said thermal generation can fill the supply
gap as low dam levels constrain hydroelectric output. If gas-
fired plants continue to operate at full capacity throughout
this year, prices increases would be capped at about 3 percent,
he told reporters.  Thermoelectric plants are generating 14,000 megawatts to
avert shortages after water reservoir levels in northeastern
Brazil fell to 32 percent, less than the 34 percent minimum the
government considers safe for the region’s plants to operate,
according to data on the national power grid operator’s website.  “There is no possibility that gas to be used for
industries be diverted to thermo plants,” Lobao said. “In our
meeting today there was a confirmation of our tranquility that
the country has a firm energy inventory, security and is in
conditions to fulfill every need.”  If thermoelectric plants can be shut down earlier, the cost
to consumers would increase by about 1 percent, Lobao said.
Thermoelectric generation may be reduced in April if there’s
enough rain in the coming months, he said.  Brazil adopted a rationing plan in 2001 after hydropower
dams fell below levels deemed safe. President Dilma Rousseff, in
her former role as energy minister, organized auctions to build
more dams and gas-fired plants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
