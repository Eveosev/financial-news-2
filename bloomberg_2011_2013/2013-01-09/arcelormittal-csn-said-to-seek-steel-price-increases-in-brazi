ArcelorMittal (MT) , the world’s largest
steelmaker, and rival  Cia. Siderurgica Nacional SA (CSNA3)  are seeking
to boost prices for some steel products in Brazil by as much as
7.5 percent, a person with knowledge of the plan said.  ArcelorMittal and CSN, as the Sao Paulo-based steelmaker is
known, informed clients that prices in Brazil will rise 3.5
percent to 7.5 percent next week, the person said, declining to
be named as the companies haven’t made an announcement. The
increase reflects higher iron-ore and coal costs and an attempt
by the companies to boost profit margins, the person said.  An external media official working for ArcelorMittal in
 Belo Horizonte , Brazil, said the company doesn’t comment on its
price policy. CSN also declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
