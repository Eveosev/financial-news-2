Copper rose for the first time in
five sessions as signs of renewed growth in  China  and better-
than-expected results from  Alcoa Inc. (AA)  pointed to stronger metals
demand.  Total imports and exports in China, the world’s biggest
copper consumer, probably gained in December, economists
surveyed by Bloomberg forecast before a government report
tomorrow. Alcoa Inc. said metals demand will climb in the Asian
country as the economy rebounds. The company yesterday reported
fourth-quarter sales that beat analyst estimates.  “The export numbers are expected to show the Chinese
economy is continuing to grow, and overall we have a better
demand picture,” Harry Denny, a broker at Hoboken, New Jersey-
based PVM Futures Inc., said in a telephone interview. “The
Alcoa numbers were good, and that took markets higher.”  Copper futures for delivery in March advanced 0.5 percent
to $3.6915 a pound at 11:10 a.m. on the Comex in  New York .
Prices fell 1.7 percent in the previous four sessions.  On the  London  Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months rose 0.4 percent to $8,109 a metric ton ($3.68 a pound).  Aluminum for delivery in three months added 1.7 percent to
$2,102.25 a ton on the LME. Demand in China, the top user, will
gain 11 percent this year, helped by stimulus spending announced
by the country’s new leadership, according to New York-based
Alcoa. The company is the biggest U.S. producer of the metal.  Tin, nickel, zinc and lead also climbed in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
