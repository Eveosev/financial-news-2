Suwon Samsung Bluewings , the South
Korean soccer team backed by Samsung Electronics Co., is set to
sign North Korean international striker Jong Tae Se from German
club Cologne.  The 28-year-old is undergoing a fitness test and may sign a
contract as early as today, Choi Won Chang, a spokesman for
Suwon Samsung, said by telephone. He declined to comment on the
size of the transfer fee or Jong’s salary.  Jong, who played at the 2010 World Cup, may become the
fourth player from the Communist nation to appear in South
Korea’s K-League. The two Koreas are technically still at war as
the 1950-53 conflict ended without a peace treaty.  Suwon Samsung will pay Cologne 300,000 euros ($390,000) for
Jong, Yonhap said yesterday, without giving a source for the
information.  Jong, who was born in  Japan , holds dual South and North
Korean nationality, according to Bluewing’s Choi. The striker
started his career at Japanese club Kawasaki Frontale in 2006
before moving to  Germany ’s VfL Bochum in 2010. He joined Cologne
last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
