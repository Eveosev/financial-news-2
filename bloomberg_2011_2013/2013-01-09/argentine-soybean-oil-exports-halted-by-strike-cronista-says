Soybean-oil  shipments from Argentina,
the world’s largest exporter, will be halted today because of a
strike at the country’s grain ports, El Cronista said, citing a
statement from a workers union.  Workers from the oilseed processing industry decided last
night to go on strike for a day, calling for a 26 percent salary
increase, the Buenos Aires-based newspaper said.  The union, which has 15,000 members, rejected a 16 percent
offer, Cronista said. The protest will mainly block shipments of
soybean oil and sunflower oil, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
