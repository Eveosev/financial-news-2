 Pattern Energy Group LP, a closely
held energy developer, said its Ocotillo wind farm in southern
California has begun providing power for Sempra Energy’s  San
Diego  Gas & Electric utility.  The 265-megawatt project in Imperial Valley entered
operation last month, San Francisco-based Pattern said today in
a statement. Ocotillo consists of 94  Siemens AG (SIE)  turbines, and an
additional 18 will be installed in the spring to provide enough
energy for about 125,000 homes a year once fully operational,
according to the statement.  SDG&E has a 20-year contract to purchase all of Ocotillo’s
power. The wind farm is the first clean-energy project to
transmit power across the utility’s 117-mile (188-kilometer)
SunRise Powerlink transmission line, which was completed in June
and will eventually deliver 1,000 megawatts of electricity into
San Diego, Pattern said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
