The zloty rallied the most in almost
two weeks after Governor  Marek Belka  said the central bank may
pause in its easing cycle after cutting  interest rates  for a
third month today.  The zloty jumped 0.8 percent to 4.0793 per euro as of 5:52
p.m. in Warsaw, the steepest advance since Dec. 27, and the
biggest appreciation after the Indonesian rupiah among more than
20 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The yield on
two-year notes rose 12 basis points to 3.31 percent.  Belka told reporters “a round of interest rate cuts is
drawing to an end” after the central bank reduced  borrowing
costs  by a quarter-point to 4 percent, matching expectations of
all 33 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The policy makers have
stepped in to boost the  economy  that slowed to it weakest pace
of expansion in more than three years.  “The outcome of the meeting confirms that the market was
too aggressive in pricing in the scale of monetary easing,”
Piotr Bujak, chief economist for  Poland  at Nordea Bank AB in
Warsaw, said in an e-mailed comment today. “That supports our
relatively upbeat forecast for the zloty to strengthen below 4
per euro” by the middle of 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
