(Corrects name of Guotai executive in third paragraph.)  China approved the introduction of
its first exchange-traded fund of  government bonds  as policy
makers seek to expand the nation’s debt market.  Guotai Asset Management Co. ’s exchange-traded fund of
Chinese sovereign debt will be listed on the  Shanghai Stock
Exchange  and benchmarked against an index of five-year
government bonds, according to a  statement  posted to the website
of the China Securities Regulatory Commission yesterday.  The fund will be “a bridge” that allows individuals to
invest in government debt traded on China’s interbank market,
from which they are barred, Pei Xiaohui, fixed-income head at
Guotai, was cited as saying by news website Sina.com.  China’s interbank market had 22.2 trillion  yuan  ($3.6
trillion) of outstanding debt at the end of November, according
to Chinabond, the nation’s bond clearinghouse. That compared
with 449 billion yuan of debt on  stock exchanges  where retail
investors are allowed to trade, according to Chinabond.  Policy makers may allow more types of bonds to be traded on
stock exchanges in a bid to boost volumes on the bourses, the
Shanghai Securities News reported Dec. 26. That may include
depositary receipts that allow debt currently tradable only on
China’s interbank market to also be traded on exchanges,
according to the report.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
