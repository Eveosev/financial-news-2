Hwang Investment Management Bhd.,
Malaysia’s fourth-largest asset manager, prefers bonds issued by
Asian lenders from Malayan Banking Bhd. to  DBS (DBS)  Group Holdings
Ltd. as regional economies lead a global recovery.  The company plans to reduce the average maturity of its
holdings in 2013 to about four years from six on prospects Asian
policy makers will switch their focus to containing inflation
over spurring growth, Esther Teo, the head of fixed income, said
in a Jan. 7 interview.  “The fundamentals of Asian banks are pretty solid,” said
Kuala Lumpur-based Teo, whose company manages $6.2 billion in
bonds and equities. “We saw a lot of rate cuts last year within
the region and we think a lot of the central banks will now be
neutral or toward the end of the rate-cut cycle.”  Inflation may accelerate to 3.97 percent in the region this
year and 4.11 percent in 2014, from an estimated 3.37 percent in
2012, according to median estimates of economists in Bloomberg
surveys. Asia’s developing nations will expand 7.2 percent in
2013, double the 3.6 percent pace for the world, International
Monetary Fund estimates published in October showed.  Asian bonds returned 8.9 percent in 2012, compared with 5
percent the previous year, according to a local-currency index
compiled by HSBC Holdings Plc. German 10-year bunds gave a 28
percent  loss , while similar-maturity U.K.  gilts  declined 7.6
percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  UOB, Westpac  Hwang also favors bonds from  Singapore ’s  United Overseas
Bank Ltd. (UOB) , Australia’s  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  and Malaysia’s RHB
Capital Bhd. in 2013, Teo said.  Fitch Ratings  said in a December
report that the rating outlook for lenders in the Asia-Pacific
region is stable as rising earnings and capital increased their
ability to handle external shocks.  Malayan Banking, or Maybank, posted net income of $1.8
billion in 2012, compared with $1.4 billion in 2011, according
to the average estimate of 26 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
DBS’ profit rose 17 percent to $2.8 billion in 2012 from 2011, a
separate survey of 24 analysts showed.  Money printing by central banks in  Europe , the U.S. and
 Japan  has boosted inflows into  emerging markets  over the past
year, threatening to reignite inflation. Developing-nation bond
funds accounted for more than half of the net $2.29 billion
invested in global debt during the week ended Jan. 2, according
to a Jan. 4 statement from U.S.-based research firm EPFR Global.  Price increases in Singapore slowed to 3.6 percent as of
November, compared with 5.5 percent in December 2011, while
Malaysia had the  lowest  rate in  Southeast Asia  of 1.3 percent.  Inflation Discounted  Lam Chee Mun, a  fund manager  at TA Investment Management
Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur , says Asian central banks won’t be in any
rush to increase  interest rates  until they see more evidence
that the economic slowdown is coming to an end, particularly in
China and the U.S.  “Until the global economy shows firmer signs of recovery,
inflation won’t be such a concern,” Lam, who oversees about
$215 million of assets, said in an interview yesterday. “So
investors wouldn’t go too short in bond duration for now.”  Hwang Investment’s flagship  Select Bond Fund  returned 11.2
percent in 2012, beating 92 percent of its 67 Malaysian peers,
who posted an average gain of 4.4 percent, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Westpac Banking was among the fund’s top 10 debt
holdings as of November, with the banking sector accounting for
29.8 percent of the total allocation, according to a statement
on its website.  Asian banks have shored up their finances since the
regional crisis in 1997, which was triggered by the devaluation
of the  Thai baht , and they are now more prudent with lending,
Teo said.  Net income from  Malayan Banking (MAY) , Malaysia’s biggest lender,
fell to $37.7 million in 1998 from $1.2 billion the previous
year, while profit at DBS, Singapore’s biggest bank by assets,
dropped 77 percent to $67 million, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “Asian credits are something that global investors are
still under-invested in,” Teo said. “We have seen a lot of
flows into Asian bonds.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
