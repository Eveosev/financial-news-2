The  Toronto Maple Leafs  fired General
Manager Brian Burke as the  National Hockey League  prepares to
begin its lockout-shortened season.  The firing of Burke, who had been the team’s general
manager since 2008, was disclosed in a statement from the Maple
Leafs. Dave Nonis has been promoted from senior vice president
of hockey operations to replace Burke.  Before joining the Maple Leafs, Burke won the Stanley Cup
as general manager of the Anaheim Ducks in 2007. He has also
served as GM of the Vancouver Canucks and Hartford Whalers. The
Maple Leafs haven’t won a league title since 1967, the longest
drought in the NHL, and haven’t qualified for the playoffs since
2004.  The NHL’s Board of Governors is scheduled to meet in  New
York  today to vote on a new collective bargaining agreement, the
next step toward ending a lockout that began Sept. 16. The
players’ association will vote later in the week. A potential
starting date for the season has yet to be disclosed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
