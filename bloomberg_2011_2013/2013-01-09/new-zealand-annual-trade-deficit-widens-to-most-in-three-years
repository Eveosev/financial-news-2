New Zealand ’s annual trade deficit
swelled to the widest in more than three years in November as
imports rose to a four-year high and a rising currency curbed
returns from exports.  Imports exceeded exports by NZ$1.46 billion ($1.2 billion)
in the 12 months ended Nov. 30, compared with a revised NZ$1.33
billion shortfall in the year through October,  Statistics New
Zealand  said today in Wellington. Exports fell 2.1 percent from
the year ended Nov. 30, 2011, while imports rose 1.7 percent.  New Zealand ended two years of annual trade surpluses in
April, and deficits are widening as slowing demand in global
markets curbs prices for dairy products, which make up a quarter
of all exports. The  New Zealand dollar ’s 6.5 percent gain in the
past 12 months compounds weaker returns for farmers and
exporters.  “Conditions for exporters have been challenging, with
global demand easing over 2012 while the New Zealand dollar has
remained elevated,” Christina Leung, economist at ASB Bank Ltd.
in Auckland, wrote in a Jan. 7 report. “We expect to see some
improvement in demand conditions in 2013, however the currency
will remain a headwind on returns.”  The local currency was little changed after the report,
buying 83.95 U.S. cents at 10:49 a.m. in Wellington.  Prices for the nation’s commodity exports fell 6.7 percent
in November from a year earlier, according to an index from ANZ
Bank New Zealand Ltd. published in early December. Still, the
annual decline is narrowing amid a 6.4 percent recovery in
prices from the 28-month low reached in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
