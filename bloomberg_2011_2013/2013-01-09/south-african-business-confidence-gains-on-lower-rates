South African business confidence
rose to a four-month high in December as low  interest rates 
helped boost manufacturing and construction in  Africa ’s largest
economy.  The  business confidence index  climbed to 93 last month,
from 91.7 in November, the Johannesburg-based South African
Chamber of Commerce and Industry said in an e-mailed statement
today. The index is compiled from 13 economic indicators,
including retail sales,  inflation  and financial gauges, such as
the stock-market index and currency.  “The relative  price stability  and the easing of the
monetary policy stance in  South Africa  have assisted the economy
and averted a more serious economic slowdown,” the chamber
said. “The promise of improvements in confidence will only
realize if the threats of continued labor protest activity,
already revealed in the early days of 2013, are dealt with
decisively.”  The central bank on Nov. 22 left its benchmark interest
rate unchanged at 5 percent, the lowest level in more than 30
years, after a surprise cut in July aimed at bolstering the
economy. Inflation has stayed within the central bank’s 3
percent to 6 percent target band since May.  Harmony Gold Mining Co. (HAR) , Africa’s third-largest producer of
the metal, on Jan. 7 said it may fire workers and close its
biggest mine following an illegal strike at the company. Harmony
was one of several mining companies affected by pay strikes that
began in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
