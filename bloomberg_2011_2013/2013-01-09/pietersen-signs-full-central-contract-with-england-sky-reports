Batsman  Kevin Pietersen  signed a full
central contract with the England and Wales Cricket Board,
signaling a return to normal relations with the ruling body, Sky
reported.  He was dropped by England after sending  text messages  to
South Africa players during last year’s Test series and
returned to the Test side for the successful tour of India.  Pietersen has been on a short-term deal expiring at the end
of January. Limited-overs coach Ashley Giles confirmed he’d
signed a full contract ahead of a five-match one-day
international series against India, Sky added.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
