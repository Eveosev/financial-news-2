The zloty slipped and the yield on
Polish 10-year notes fell for a third day amid speculation the
central bank will cut interest rates today to boost the economy.  The zloty retreated 0.2 percent to 4.1169 per euro as of
11:53 a.m. in Warsaw. The yield on notes maturing in October
2023 dropped two basis points to 3.75 percent, extending this
week’s decline to 20 basis points, or 0.20 percentage point.  Policy makers will probably lower borrowing costs by a
quarter of a percentage point for the third month today to spur
economic growth, according to all 33 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. The decision will come around midday in Warsaw,
followed by Governor Marek Belka’s press conference at 4 p.m.  “The zloty will be sensitive to what the central bank will
say,” Joanna Bachert, an analyst at PKO Bank Polski SA, said in
an e-mailed report today. “Dovish comments would be taken by
the market as a sign the next cut will come already in
February.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
