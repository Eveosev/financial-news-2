Delta Lloyd NV (DL) , the Dutch insurer
which sells life insurance in Belgium, the Netherlands and
Luxembourg, rose the most in more than a year after  Aviva Plc (AV/) 
sold its 19.4 percent stake in the company for 433.8 million
euros ($568 million).  Delta Lloyd rose as much as 9.5 percent to 14.09 euros, the
biggest intraday gain since September 2011. It traded at 13.80
euros as of 9:59 a.m. in Amsterdam, valuing the company at 2.4
billion euros.  “The overhang was a concern so removal thereof is a clear
positive,”  Albert Ploegh , an Amsterdam-based analyst at  ING
Groep NV (INGA)  with a buy rating on the shares, said in a note today.  Aviva, the U.K’s second-biggest insurance company by market
value, sold 34.3 million shares of the Amsterdam-based insurer
in a stock offering for 12.65 euros each. The ordinary shares
will be placed with various institutional investors, Delta LLoyd
said in a statement yesterday.  “We are pleased with this successful reallocation of
shares, showing a particular strong interest of long-term
investors reflecting their trust in Delta Lloyd,” Chief
Executive Officer Niek Hoek said. “It strengthens us pursuing
our strategy and enables us to retain a stable shareholder
base.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
