President  Barack Obama  won more
support from New York City in November’s election than any White
House candidate in more than 100 years, according to a final
tally of votes.  Obama beat Republican challenger  Mitt Romney  by 81 percent
to 18 percent in the nation’s largest city, according to a
certified vote count released Dec. 31 by the state board of
elections. Some New York ballots were counted late in part
because of complications caused by  Hurricane Sandy .  Obama’s share of the vote is the best showing by a
presidential nominee in New York since its five boroughs were
consolidated in 1898, according to data compiled by Bloomberg
from the state elections board and the 2005 books “America at
the Polls” and “The Encyclopedia of New York State.”  The results underscore New York’s decades-long status as a
Democratic bastion where most residents are racial and ethnic
minorities. Of the city’s 8.2 million residents, 29 percent are
Hispanic, 23 percent are non-Hispanic black and 13 percent are
non-Hispanic Asian, according to 2011 estimates from the Census
Bureau.  “Demographic shifts are permanently changing the political
landscape,” said Bruce Berg, a political scientist at Fordham
University in New York. Census data show New York “is a more
minority city than it already was,” he said in a telephone
interview.  Coolidge Results  Republican presidential candidates have taken less than
one-fourth of the city vote in each of the past six elections.
Calvin Coolidge in 1924 was the last Republican presidential
nominee to win New York.  Obama broke his own record of 79 percent support in New
York in the 2008 election. His showing four years ago topped the
78 percent that Al Gore won in the city as the 2000 Democratic
nominee.  The president in his re-election win improved on his 2008
showing in four of the city’s five boroughs. He rose to 91
percent from 89 percent in the Bronx, to 82 percent from 79
percent in  Brooklyn , and to 79 percent from 75 percent in
Queens, and carried Staten Island with 51 percent after taking
48 percent and losing the borough in 2008.  Manhattan , which includes Wall Street, is the one borough
where Obama’s support edged downward, falling to 84 percent from
86 percent four years ago.  The Bronx has been New York’s most Democratic borough in
each of the past five presidential elections, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It is one of the nation’s poorest areas,
with a median household income of $32,058 in 2011. More than 80
percent of residents are black or Hispanic.  The Bronx, Queens and Brooklyn “still have fairly strong
Democratic Party machines that get out the vote, and I suspect
they were well-mobilized for the presidential election” and
other political contests, Berg said.  Turnout in the city fell to 2.45 million votes from 2.62
million in 2008, when Obama when as elected the nation’s first
black president amid a financial crisis that took hold at the
end of Republican George W. Bush’s administration.  To contact the reporter on this story:
