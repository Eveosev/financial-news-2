Green Infra Ltd., an Indian wind-farm
developer backed by IDFC Private Equity, is in talks with at
least two investors to raise $150 million.  The funds raised will be used to increase generation
capacity to 1 gigawatt from 295 megawatts in two years, Chief
Executive Officer Shivanand Nimbargi said in a phone interview
from New Delhi. The company may consider an initial public
offering in 2015, he said.  India , the third-biggest wind market, is attracting
investments as the cost of wind power declines and fossil-fuel
imports increases, making renewable energy more competitive with
coal. Developers’ bids in auctions for coal-fired power stations
have ranged from $49 to $78 a megawatt-hour, compared with
tariffs for wind farms between $66 and $105 a megawatt-hour,
according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  Green Infra, which bought  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Indian wind-energy
businesses in 2009, has 270 megawatts of wind farms and 25
megawatts of solar plants in the country, Nimbargi said. BP’s
unit included about 100 megawatts of that total.  To contact the reporter on this story:
