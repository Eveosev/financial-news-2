Pier Luigi Bersani, the former
communist and frontrunner for  Italy ’s premiership, called for
higher taxes on the wealthy and reduced rates for lower earners.  “It’s reasonable to reduce the lowest brackets, the middle
and low, and raise the high one a little,” Bersani of the
 Democratic Party , said today in a televised interview on Sky
TG24.  Bersani, 61, is preparing a fiscal program to appeal to his
base of supporters in labor unions and to abide by European
Union budget rules. The former industry minister said he will
push the EU to ease restrictions to combat economic stagnation
if he wins the Feb. 24-25 election.  “We have to give a little bit of space to investment
immediately,” Bersani said.  Bersani also told Sky TG24 he is open to cooperation with
outgoing Prime Minister  Mario Monti  after the election.  To contact the reporter on this story:
