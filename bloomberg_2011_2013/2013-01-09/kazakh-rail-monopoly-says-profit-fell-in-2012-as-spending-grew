AO Kazakhstan Temir Zholy National
Co. said profit shrank 5.3 percent last year as the central
Asian country’s railroad monopoly raised  capital spending .  Net income fell to 116.7 billion tenge ($773 million), down
from 123.2 billion tenge in 2011 when profit doubled from the
previous year, the Astana-based company said in a  statement  on
its website. The state-run rail operator boosted capital
expenditure by 30 percent to 499.5 billion tenge last year from
2011, according to the statement.  The company projects profit will reach at least 125 billion
tenge this year, Interfax cited Chief Executive Officer Askar
Mamin as telling Prime Minister Serik Akhmetov today.  Akhmetov said the process of converting the state-run port
of Aktau into a joint-stock company should be completed this
year, transferring control to Temir Zholy’s management,
according to the rail operator’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
