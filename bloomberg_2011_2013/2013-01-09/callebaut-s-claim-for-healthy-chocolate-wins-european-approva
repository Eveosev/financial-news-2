Barry Callebaut AG (BARN)  will be able to
label chocolate as good for the heart after European Union
regulators agreed to approve a claim that some of its
ingredients can help the elasticity of blood vessels.  “The health claim on cocoa flavanols can be used, in
principle, exclusively by Barry Callebaut Belgium NV, for a
period of five years,” said  Frederic Vincent , a spokesman for
the European Commission in an e-mailed statement today. The
company must refer to the “maintenance of the elasticity of
blood vessels” in the claim, he said.  Vincent said the European Commission, the regulator for the
27-nation bloc, will make a final decision to approve
Callebaut’s claim in March.  Zurich-based Callebaut, which supplies chocolate to  Nestle
SA (NESN)  and  Hershey Co. (HSY) , declined to immediately comment, saying it
wasn’t aware of the EU decision. The company said last year that
it saw considerable market potential in EU approval for a claim
that consuming cocoa flavanols positively influences blood
circulation in the human body. Companies can’t make claims on
their packaging citing research that shows health benefits from
food and drinks without receiving EU approval.  To contact the reporter on this story:
