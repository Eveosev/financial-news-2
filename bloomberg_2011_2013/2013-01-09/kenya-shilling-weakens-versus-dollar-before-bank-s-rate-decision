Kenya ’s shilling fell for a fourth
day as importers exchanged the local currency for U.S. dollars
to be used for overseas payments before an expected interest
rate cut tomorrow.  The currency of East Africa’s largest economy dipped less
than 0.1 percent to 86.60 a dollar by 12:48 p.m. in the capital,
holding steady at the lowest in more than seven months,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The Monetary Policy Committee is meeting tomorrow and
we’re expecting a rate cut,” Julius Kiriinya, a dealer at
Nairobi-based African Banking Corp., said by phone. “There is
panic and demand from importers across the board. They are
buying dollars before the rate cut to be able to pay their bills
later in the month.”  All but one of the 10 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
expect the central bank to cut its benchmark lending rate
tomorrow. Seven economists expected a 1 percentage point
reduction, one forecast a 1.5 percentage point cut and another
predicted a 2 percentage point decrease. One analyst said the
rate will remain unchanged at 11 percent.  Uganda’s shilling gained 0.6 percent to 2,697.50 a dollar,
heading for its biggest increase since Dec. 24, while the
Tanzanian currency rose less than 0.1 percent to 1,594.50.  To contact the reporter on this story:
