MacDonald Dettwiler & Associates Ltd. (MDA) 
has won a contract to develop satellites to monitor Canadian
territory for military and environmental purposes, the federal
government said.  MDA, based in Richmond, British Columbia, will help build
three RADARSAT satellites to be launched in 2018, Industry
Minister Christian Paradis said in an e-mailed statement today.  The satellites will monitor  Canada ’s land, oceans and
coastal approaches daily, and as many as four times a day in the
far north, the government said in the statement. Data will be
used by the Department of National Defence, Environment Canada
and Natural Resources Canada, it said.  The government allocated C$497 million ($503 million) over
five years in its 2010 budget to develop the next phase of the
RADARSAT mission. Existing satellites provide data used to
support the military and track climate change.  Trading in MDA’s stock in Toronto was halted earlier today
pending news.  In 2008, the government blocked the acquisition of MDA’s
aerospace division by  Alliant Techsystems Inc. (ATK)  under Canada’s
foreign-takeover law.  To contact the reporter on this story:
