The Caspian Pipeline Consortium, the
operator of a Russian crude oil export link with foreign
shareholders, said oil shipments through its terminal at the
Novorossiysk port fell in December from the month before.  The terminal pumped 2.743 million metric tons, or 695,615
barrels a day, CPC said today on its  website . That is 3.4
percent less than November exports of 719,804 barrels a day.  The CPC pipeline, whose biggest corporate shareholder is
 Chevron Corp. (CVX)  with a 15 percent stake, runs from  Kazakhstan  to
the  Black Sea . Russia owns 31 percent and Kazakhstan owns 20.75
percent. Exxon Mobil Corp., OAO Lukoil and a joint venture
between OAO Rosneft and  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  are among the
other shareholders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
