Piraeus Port Authority SA (PPA) , which
operates Greece’s biggest port, said the number of containers
handled at its Pier I facility increased almost 28 percent in
2012.  The pier handled 625,914 20-foot-equivalent units, up from
490,904 in 2011, while container storage space at the pier rose
12 percent, the authority said in a  statement  on its website.  Greece may sell a stake in Piraeus Port as part of a
program of state asset sales. The harbor’s Pier II is run by
Piraeus Container Terminal SA, a unit of  Cosco Pacific Ltd. (1199) ,
which will also build a third pier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
