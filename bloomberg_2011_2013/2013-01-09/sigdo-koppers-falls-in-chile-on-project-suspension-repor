Sigdo Koppers SA (SK)  dropped the most in
three months after El Mercurio reported that the Chilean holding
company may suspend an ammonia project in  Peru .  Shares retreated 2.2 percent to 1,160 pesos at 1:17 p.m. in
Santiago after earlier falling 3 percent in the steepest
intraday decline since Oct. 10. The benchmark Ipsa index was
little changed.  The Santiago-based company, which controls subsidiaries in
explosives, mining equipment, construction, auto dealers and
port operations, may indefinitely postpone a project to build an
$850 million ammonia and ammonium nitrate plant in Peru as it
has tried unsuccessfully in the last five years to secure
natural gas supply contracts, El Mercurio wrote today.  El Mercurio cited unidentified sources from  Enaex SA (ENAEX) , Sigdo
Koppers’s explosives production unit. The Santiago-based
newspaper cited Geir Skarstein, chief executive officer of
Nitratos del Peru, the company in charge of building the plant,
as saying it has tried to secure gas from Peru’s Camisea
project. Moving the project to another country is an option,
Skarstein was quoted as saying.  Sigdo Koppers’s press office did not return phone calls
from  Bloomberg News  seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
