Banco Espirito Santo SA (BES) ,  Portugal ’s
biggest publicly traded bank, rose to the highest level in
almost a year as high demand for its bonds signaled borrowing
conditions are improving for the bailed-out country.  Espirito Santo advanced as much as 4.6 percent to 1.04
euros, the highest price since February last year. The stock
gained 3.4 percent to 1.03 euros at 11:43 a.m. in Lisbon, giving
the company a market value of 4.13 billion euros ($5.39
billion).  The bank sold 500 million euros of five-year bonds
yesterday in an operation that was six times oversubscribed,
Chief Financial Officer Amilcar Morais Pires said in an
interview. Spanish lender  Banco Popular Espanol SA (POP)  sold 750
million euros of 30-month bonds yesterday, according to a person
familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because
they’re not authorized to speak on the matter.  The impact of the sale was “positive,”  Banco BPI (BPI)  analyst
Carlos Peixoto said in a research note today. “This is another
signal of the progressive reopening of the wholesale funding
markets to both Portuguese and Spanish banks.”  Banco BPI SA, Portugal’s fifth-biggest bank, gained 6.5
percent to 1.14 euros and  Banco Comercial Portugues SA (BCP) , the
country’s second-largest publicly traded lender, rose 1.3
percent to 8.1 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
