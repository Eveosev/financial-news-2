Crude options volatility was below 25
percent for a sixth day as underlying futures moved 20 cents or
less for the fifth session.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
February, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 22.25 percent on the New York
Mercantile Exchange at 3:55 p.m., up from 20.46 percent
yesterday.  February-delivery crude oil fell 5 cents to settle at
$93.10 a barrel on the Nymex. Trading volume was 9.2 percent
below the 100-day average. Since Dec. 27, crude has traded in an
intraday range between $90 to $93.87.  Volatility has lessened and oil prices have been little
changed since Congress approved a budget deal Jan. 2 to avert
the fiscal cliff, spending cuts and higher taxes for most
Americans that threatened the U.S. economy.  “Volatility is usually low after the holidays but this is
the lowest since 1994,” said Ray Carbone, president of
Paramount Options Inc. in New York. “Interest in trading is at
a low, a hangover of regulatory fears, contraction of the
trading groups and banks, and the market has not moved much
since the reaction to the fiscal cliff. When the market moves
sideways, risk reward isn’t there.”  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
March $115 calls, which were unchanged at 6 cents a barrel on
volume of 2,766 contracts at 4:37 p.m. in New York. February $90
puts were the second-most active, with 2,183 lots exchanged as
they fell 6 cents to 21 cents a barrel.  Puts Dominate  Puts accounted for 53 percent of electronic trading volume.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  In the previous session, bearish bets accounted for 50.4
percent of the 122,784 contracts traded.  March $110 calls were the most active options with 6,383
contracts changing hands. They declined 1 cent to 9 cents a
barrel. June $115 calls fell 3 cents to 52 cents on 4,077 lots.  Open interest was highest for February $105 calls with
32,389 contracts. Next were March $70 puts at 27,583 and
