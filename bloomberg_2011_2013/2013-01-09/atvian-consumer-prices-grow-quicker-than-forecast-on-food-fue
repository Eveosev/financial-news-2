Latvian consumer prices rose in
December at a quicker pace than analysts forecast as food and
fuel costs advanced.  Prices grew 1.6 percent from a year earlier, the same level
as the previous month, the  statistics office , based in the
capital, Riga, said today on its website. A Bloomberg survey of
six economists had forecast an increase of 1.4 percent. Prices
were unchanged from the previous month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
