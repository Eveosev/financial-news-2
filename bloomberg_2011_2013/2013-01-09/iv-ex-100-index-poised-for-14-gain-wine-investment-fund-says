The Liv-ex 100 Index of fine wines is
poised for a 14 percent gain this year after the market’s return
to stability and less selling of stock by institutional holders,
the London-based Wine Investment Fund said in a January report.  The prediction follows a decline of 9 percent in 2012 and
15 percent in 2011, driving prices below trend and taking the
Bordeaux-dominated index down 28 percent from its June 2011
peak, according to the report.  “Downside risk is now rather limited and price falls over
the year as a whole require a pessimistic view,” the fund said,
adding there’s an 85 percent chance of “positive overall price
movements” this year.  To contact the reporter on the story:
