The Bank of  Spain  should increase
oversight of the country’s banks, according to the
recommendations of an internal review conducted under the terms
of a European bailout.  Inspection teams based at banks should extend the scope of
their work to cover the 16 most “relevant” lenders, the Bank
of Spain said on its website today, citing the  recommendations 
of a commission scrutinizing supervision practices. The largest
loan portfolios will be subject to inspections every three
years, it said.  “The purpose of the review has been to carry out a
diagnosis of the supervisory procedures of the Bank of Spain
with the aim of identifying shortfalls and formulating reform
proposals,” the commission said.  Spain was forced to seek European aid to rescue struggling
lenders including the  Bankia (BKIA)  group last year, leaving taxpayers
with a bill estimated by the European Commission at 52 billion
euros ($68 billion). No one had wanted to acknowledge that risks
were accumulating during the “bubble years” for Spain and
 Europe , Bank of Spain Governor Luis Maria Linde said in July.  El Pais newspaper this week published stories citing a
report by the association of Bank of Spain inspectors that
criticized the regulator, alleging it was too lax on bank
compensation practices and when infractions were highlighted. El
Pais said the inspectors also accused the central bank of
changing the conclusions of their probes.  In a statement published last night, the executive
committee of the Bank of Spain said it “profoundly lamented”
the spread of some of the claims in the report and it had sought
“ to comply with the best international standards of rigor,
independence and technical quality.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
