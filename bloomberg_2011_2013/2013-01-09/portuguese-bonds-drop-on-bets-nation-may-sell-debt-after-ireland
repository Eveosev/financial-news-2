Portuguese securities fell, with 10-
year yields rising the most in two months, on bets the nation
may sell bonds for the first time since its international
bailout after Ireland sold five-year debt yesterday.     Portuguese bonds have fallen amid “speculation that it,
too, may follow Ireland in selling bonds through banks,” said
Soeren Moerch, head of government bond trading at Danske Bank
A/S in Copenhagen. “We recommend that investors buy them into
weakness.”  The  yield  on Portuguese 10-year bonds climbed 20 basis
points, or 0.2 percentage point, to 6.66 percent as of 9:16 a.m.
London time. The rate earlier climbed 24 basis points, the most
since Nov. 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
