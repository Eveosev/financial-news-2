The Export-Import Bank of China will
lend Ivory Coast $500 million for a hydroelectric dam built by
Sinohydro Corp., the biggest amount given by the lender to the
West African nation in 30 years, Ambassador Guoqing Zhang said
in a statement.  Works started on Jan. 2 on the 275-megawatt plant at
Soubre, in the southwest, and will continue for more than four
years, Oil and Energy Minister Adama Toungara said in a separate
statement. Both were handed to reporters in Abidjan, the
commercial capital, today.  The plant will allow the country to “face the nation’s
growing consumption” of electricity, Toungara said. Operations
will start by late 2017 or early 2018 and the facility will be
the biggest hydropower producer in Ivory Coast.  Ivory Coast plans to invest $4 billion over the next six
years in energy infrastructure to boost power output by 80
percent, Toungara said in November. The country currently
produces 70 percent of electricity demand through natural-gas
fueled thermal plants, he said today.  After contracting 4.7 percent in 2011, Ivory Coast’s
economy grew more than 8.5 percent in 2012, Christine Lagarde,
managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said in
Abidjan on Jan 7. The government is targeting 9 percent growth
this year and 10 percent in 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
