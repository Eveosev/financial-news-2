Members of the European Parliament’s
environment committee proposed 35 new amendments to a draft
emissions-trading law change aimed at curbing oversupply of
permits from this year, according to an EU document.  The committee, which is due to vote on the measure next
month, will consider a total of 42  amendments  after its chairman
Matthias Groote proposed seven changes in a draft report in
November. The whole parliament may vote on the proposal in March
at the earliest.  The changes sought by lawmakers range from rejecting the
European Commission’s reassertion of its right to decide when
carbon-permit auctions are held, to increasing the pace of
emission reductions in the coming years. Some members of the
committee want to ensure any intervention would be exceptional
and the allowances would be returned to the market before 2020.  To contact the reporter on this story:
