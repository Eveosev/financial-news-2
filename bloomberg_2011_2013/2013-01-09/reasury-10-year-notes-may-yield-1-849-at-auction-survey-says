The Treasury’s $21 billion sale of
10-year notes may draw a yield of 1.849 percent, according to
the average forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of eight of the
 Federal Reserve ’s 21 primary dealers.  The notes, which mature in November 2022, yielded 1.86
percent in pre-auction trading. Bids are due by 1 p.m.  New York 
time. The  record-low  sale yield, 1.459 percent, was reached at
the July 11 offering.  The December auction’s  bid-to-cover ratio , which gauges
demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was
2.95, versus an average of 3 at the past 10 sales.  Indirect bidders , a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 24.2 percent of the notes at last
month’s offering, compared with an average of 38.1 percent at
the prior 10 auctions.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 42.7 percent of
the offering in December, after buying a record-high 45.4
percent of the notes at the July sale. The average at the past
10 auctions was 20.9 percent.  Ten-year  U.S. debt  has lost 1.1 percent this year,
according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes, compared
to a 0.6 percent loss in the broader Treasury market. The notes
returned 4.2 percent in 2012, compared with a 2.2 percent gain
by Treasuries overall.  This is the second of three auctions this week as the
government  sells  $66 billion of notes and bonds. It sold $32
billion of three-year securities yesterday, drawing a record
high direct bid, and is due to auction $13 billion of 30-year
debt tomorrow.  The sales this week will raise $24.4 billion of new cash,
as maturing securities held by the public total $41.6 billion,
according to the Treasury.  Primary dealers trade  government securities  with the
central bank and are obliged to participate in U.S. debt sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
