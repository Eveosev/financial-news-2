Renault SA (RNO) , France’s second-biggest
carmaker, is seeking a 6.5 percent increase in work hours at its
domestic factories in an effort to reduce spending 65 million
euros ($85 million) a year to boost profit.  The manufacturer will seek unions’ agreement for a 35-hour
workweek at all its sites in France when the two sides meet Jan.
15 to discuss efficiency measures, Raluca Barb, a Renault
spokeswoman, said in a phone interview today.  Renault, based in the Paris suburb of Boulogne-Billancourt,
is among European carmakers struggling with excess capacity as
the region’s market is set to shrink for a sixth consecutive
year. Executives told union leaders in November that
industrywide sales won’t start picking up again before 2018.  Chief Operating Officer  Carlos Tavares  said on Sept. 28
that there are too many car plants in Europe and that he
expected to find common ground with French unions on
competitiveness moves “in the next few months.” Tavares cited
Renault’s factory in Palencia, Spain, and a Sunderland, England,
site run by affiliate Nissan Motor Co. as examples of efficiency
to emulate.  PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG) , Europe’s second-biggest carmaker and
Renault’s larger domestic competitor, estimated today that the
European auto market will shrink 3 percent to 5 percent in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
