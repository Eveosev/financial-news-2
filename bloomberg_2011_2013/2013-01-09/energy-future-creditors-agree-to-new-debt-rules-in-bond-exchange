Energy Future Holdings Corp.
creditors agreed to exchange $1.37 billion of the company’s
bonds and to amend rules governing its securities as the power
producer shifts liabilities before a potential restructuring.  Lenders tendered $113 million of 9.75 percent notes due
2019 and $1.06 billion of 10 percent debt maturing in 2020,
Dallas-based Energy Future said today in a regulatory filing.
The company offered Dec. 21 to swap as much as $1.3 billion of
new 10 percent securities due 2020 linked to Energy Future
Intermediate Holding Co. for secured obligations at the parent
company as well as Energy Future Intermediate.  Energy Future also received requisite consents to amend
rules governing its secured debt, which may be revoked before
Jan. 24, according to the statement. The company proposed
changes in December that would delete restrictive covenants and
certain events of default from the indentures.  The transaction follows an agreement this week to extend
the maturity of $646 million in revolving credit commitments of
Energy Future’s unregulated electricity unit. Texas Competitive
Electric Holdings Co. added $340 million in term loans due in
2017 to compensate creditors, who allowed the unit to push the
maturity on commitments expiring this year to 2016.  A restructuring at that unit is likely to occur within the
next six to 12 months, James Hempstead, an analyst at Moody’s
Investors Service, said in a Jan. 3 report.  In 2007, KKR & Co., TPG Capital and Goldman Sachs Capital
Partners took Energy Future private for $43.2 billion, the
largest leveraged buyout ever. The power producer has posted
seven consecutive quarterly losses and had $37.4 billion of
long-term borrowings as of Sept. 30.  Energy Future, formerly known as TXU Corp., announced both
the exchange offer and debt extension last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
