The drought that ravaged U.S. corn
and soybean crops and spurred record prices may persist,
threatening a recovery in production this year that’s needed to
bolster global inventories, according to forecasters.  “Unless there’s a sudden change to very wet conditions, it
sure looks like drought is going to be a feature going into the
planting season, spring at least,”  Bryce Anderson , an
agricultural meteorologist at DTN, said in a phone interview
from Omaha,  Nebraska  yesterday. DTN provides weather information
on agricultural markets. “In the 1930s, there was a period of
four or five years when drought was a feature,” Anderson said.  The worst U.S. drought since the 1930s last year lifted
corn and soybeans to all-time highs, driving up  food costs  and
prompting South American growers to boost plantings. Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. said on Dec. 11 that there was a “growing
risk” output may disappoint again in 2013, forecasting higher
prices. The U.S. is the largest grower of corn and second-
largest of soybeans, and Chicago futures are global benchmarks.  “There’s nothing in terms of changes in climate positions
to suggest that the drought in the U.S. is going to be short-
lived,”  Jim Dale , senior risk meteorologist at British Weather
Services, said in a phone interview from  High Wycombe ,  England ,
citing computer models.  Corn, trading at $6.875 a bushel on the Chicago Board of
Trade today, has lost 19 percent from a record $8.49 in August
as global supply concerns eased. Soybeans, trading at $13.84 a
bushel, have tumbled into a  bear market , losing more than 20
percent from last year’s closing high of $17.6825. The oilseed
peaked at $17.89 on Sept. 4.  Soil Moisture  The Palmer drought index, which tracks rain and
temperatures to gauge the extent of drought conditions, fell to
minus 4 in July, said Anderson, who correctly predicted an end
to a La Nina weather pattern last year. History shows that in
the years that the index had reached that level before, it took
18 to 51 months for soil moisture to recover, he said.  As of Jan. 5, parts of the Midwest, the largest U.S. corn-
and soybean-growing region, and many parts of the South Plains
and High Plains remained at minus 4 on the Palmer index,
described as extreme drought, according to data on website of
the  College Park , Maryland-based  Climate Prediction Center .  Warmest Year  The drought in 2012, which covered almost 62 percent of the
48 contiguous U.S. states and was second in size only to the
Dust Bowl of the 1930s, may continue into 2013 in the southern
Great Plains, government climatologists said in December. Last
year was the warmest on records going back to 1895 for the 48
states, according to a report yesterday from a unit of the
 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .  U.S.  corn production  fell 13 percent to 272.4 million
metric tons in 2012-2013, the lowest since 2006-2007, according
to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture , which will update figures
on Jan. 11. The soybean harvest fell 4 percent to 80.9 million
tons, USDA data show. Global corn stockpiles will fall to 117.6
million tons by Oct. 1, or 13.6 percent of projected demand for
food, ethanol and livestock feed, the lowest ratio since 1974.  In  Iowa , the largest U.S. corn and soybean grower, 85
percent of top-soil moisture was classified as short to very
short, said Anderson, who tracks growing conditions using
satellite images from agencies including  NASA  and indicators
from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Organization.  Extreme Drought  Parts of Iowa, which produces almost double the corn output
of  Argentina , the world’s third-largest shipper, and almost as
much soybeans as  China , was still in  extreme drought  as of Jan.
1, according to the government-backed Drought Monitor.  The dryness may also hurt winter wheat. The crop is in the
 worst condition  since records began in 1985, according to USDA
data. Investors may not realize the potential problems with
global wheat supply,  Abdolreza Abbassian , an economist at the
 United Nations ’ Food & Agriculture Organization, said last month,
predicting global inventories will drop to a four-year low.  Corn may rebound to $8.25 a bushel within six months, just
2.8 percent below the record, while soybeans may advance to
$15.50, Goldman Sachs said in a Dec. 11 report. A Bloomberg
survey of analysts published Dec. 18 showed the median high of
forecasts for 2013 at $16.35 for soybeans and $8.25 for corn.  To contact the reporter on this story:
