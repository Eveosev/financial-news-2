Sugarcane growers in  Brazil ’s Center
South, the world’s largest producing region, are set to reap a
record crop, exceeding previous forecasts, as soil humidity
helps plants withstand dry weather, Datagro Ltd. said.  The region’s sugarcane producers will harvest between 580
million and 590 million metric tons in the crop year that starts
April 1, the research firm’s president, Plinio Nastari, said.
That compares with a previous estimate of as much as 575 million
tons on Oct. 15.  “High soil moisture helped the crops, including the newly
replanted fields, to go through the dry period in December,”
Nastari said today in a telephone interview from Barueri,
Brazil. “Now mills are just waiting for crops to finish
maturing to start the harvest.”  December rainfall in  Sao Paulo  state, which produces 60
percent of the country’s sugar, was 21 percent lower than the
30-year average for the month, he said. Soil humidity is high
because of showers between May and September, Nastari said.  The region’s production in the 2012-13 season ending March
31 is forecast at 535.7 million tons of sugarcane, 34.3 million
tons of sugar and 21.38 billion liters (5.64 billion gallons) of
ethanol, Nastari said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
