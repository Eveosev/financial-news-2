Boeing Co. (BA) ’s troubled 787 Dreamliner
plane got a vote of confidence from the chief executive officer
of Qatar Airways Ltd., who called the recent technical glitches
“teething problems” that won’t affect his purchase plans.  “We will have these problems, but it doesn’t mean that we
will cancel our orders,” Akbar al Baker, known to publicly slam
manufacturers for performances deemed sub-par, told reporters in
Doha, Qatar, today. “We’ve had no other technical issues, there
will be small teething problems.”  The Boeing wide-body aircraft has suffered a series of
technical setbacks, including a fuel leak and a fire on another
plane this week. The airliner, which has a fuselage made large
of lighter composite materials, entered commercial service late
in 2011, more than three years behind schedule.  Qatar, which markets itself as a luxury airline, was forced
to ground a factory-fresh Dreamliner in mid December because of
a faulty generator.  Al Baker  called the issue “unacceptable”
and said Chicago-based Boeing should “get their act together
very fast.”  The fire on the Japan Airlines Co.-operated Dreamliner at
Boston Airport may have been an “isolated event,” and the U.S.
 Federal Aviation Administration  would have ordered a grounding
of the fleet if the regulator considered the aircraft unsafe, Al
Baker said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
