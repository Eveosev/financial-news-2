(Corrects wording of comment in second paragraph.)  ArcelorMittal (MT) , the world’s largest
steelmaker, said it’s structured a bid for ThyssenKrupp’s
Alabama steel plant.  “Alabama is a world-class asset,” Chief Financial Officer
 Aditya Mittal  said today on a conference call, citing
“synergies” with the company’s American operations. “We’ve
structured a bid which will allow us to participate, which does
not detract from us achieving a net-debt target of $17 billion
by June-end.”  ThyssenKrupp said Dec. 11 there were more than five bidders
interested in one or both of its plants in Alabama and Rio de
Janeiro. The German company rose as much as 4.2 percent in
Frankfurt trading after today’s announcement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
