The Venezuelan government ordered
sugar producers to sell 70 percent of their production to retail
outlets and the rest to local industry, according to a
resolution published today in the Official Gazette.  Sugar producers must allocate the majority of output in
packages of five kilograms or less to shops to avoid shortages,
the resolution said. The measure comes after authorities this
week held meetings with local producers to address shortages of
food staples in supermarkets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
