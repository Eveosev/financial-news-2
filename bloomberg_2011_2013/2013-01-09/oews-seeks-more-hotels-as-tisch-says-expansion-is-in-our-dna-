Loews Corp. (L) , the company run by New
York’s Tisch family, said it plans to expand its hotel business
in 2013 after announcing additions to the chain last year.  “Expansion is very much in our DNA right now,”  Jonathan
Tisch , co-chairman of Loews and chairman of the hotel unit, said
today in an interview with Betty Liu on Bloomberg Television’s
“In the Loop” program. “We understand the economy, we
understand the challenges, but we feel good that people still
want to travel.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
