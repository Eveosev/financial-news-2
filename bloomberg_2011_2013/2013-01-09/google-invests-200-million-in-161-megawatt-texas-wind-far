Google Inc. (GOOG)  said it invested $200
million in a wind farm in west  Texas , adding to the list of
renewable-energy investments the Internet-search company has
made since 2010.  Spinning Spur Wind Project, in the Texas Panhandle about 35
miles from Amarillo, is a 161-megawatt facility built by EDF
Renewable Energy, Google said in a blog posting today. The
siteâ€™s turbines began operating full time at the end of 2012 and
its energy is contracted to a utility company serving mainly
Texas and New Mexico.  Google, based in Mountain View, California, said it has
made 10 other renewable-energy investments since 2010. The
projects altogether can generate 2 gigawatts of power, or enough
to run 500,000 U.S. homes for one year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
