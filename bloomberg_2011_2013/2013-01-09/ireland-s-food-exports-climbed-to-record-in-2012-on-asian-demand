Ireland’s food and drink exports last
year climbed above 9 billion euros ($12 billion) for the first
time, aided by rising shipments to Asia, Bord Bia said.  Meat and livestock made up the biggest export sector, with
shipments valued at 2.99 billion euros in 2012, up 4 percent
from a year earlier, the Dublin-based trade development
organization said today in a  statement  on its website. Seafood
was up 18 percent to 493 million euros and beverages climbed 3
percent from 2011 to 1.26 billion euros. Horticulture and cereal
shipments climbed by about 2 percent, while dairy and prepared
food exports fell from 2011.  Irish  food  exports have recorded an “exceptionally strong
performance” in recent years, with shipments to Asia rising by
75 percent since 2010, Bord Bia said. The weakening euro has
increased the appeal of Irish goods for buyers in the U.K. and
in other countries outside the euro zone.  “Despite falling global commodity prices, lower output in
some sectors and the continued weakness in consumer spending in
established markets, the Irish food industry has delivered
another robust export performance,” Aidan Cotter, Bord Bia’s
chief executive, said in the statement. “The continued
diversification into new and  emerging markets , benefiting
further from favorable exchange rates, is particularly
welcoming.”  Export prospects “remain positive” for 2013 as Ireland’s
beef production is set to increase while “more stable” world
commodity prices are expected, according to the statement. In a
Bord Bia survey completed last month, 77 percent of exporters
reported their sales rose during the past year, and 75 percent
expected another increase in 2013, the group said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
