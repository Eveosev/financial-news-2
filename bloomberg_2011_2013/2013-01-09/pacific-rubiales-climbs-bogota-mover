Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PRE) ,
Colombia’s largest private oil producer, rose the most in more
than three months after output at its largest field increased
faster than expected.  Shares (PREC)  rose 4.4 percent to 41,240 pesos at the close in
Bogota, the most since Sept. 27.  Gross production at the Rubiales field, which accounts for
60% of the company’s output, rose to 210,000 barrels a day  from
190,000 barrels a day in December, Chief Executive Officer
Ronald Pantin said during a conference call today.  “They have been able to accelerate Rubiales field quicker
than we thought, which was a big positive for the stock,” Matt Portillo, an analyst at Tudor Pickering Holt & Co., said on the
phone from Houston today.  Pantin also said the company’s forecast of 15 to 30 percent
growth is “conservative guidance” because the company doesn’t
know what might happen with environmental licenses pending in
Colombia.  “We’ll be changing the guidance when we have the
licenses,” he said.  Management made it clear that those numbers were
“extremely conservative,” Justin Anderson, an analyst at
Salman Partners, said in a telephone interview from Calgary.
“Unless everything goes poorly with permitting, the market is
assuming they’ll have no problem reaching the high end of that
guidance.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
