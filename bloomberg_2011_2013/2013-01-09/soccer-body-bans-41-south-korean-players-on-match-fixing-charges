Soccer’s governing body gave global
bans to 41 South Korean soccer players for fixing matches in the
country’s K-League.  FIFA’s disciplinary committee extended a domestic
suspension to the rest of the world, it said today in an e-
mailed statement. The governing body said 21 of the players, who
turned themselves in during a voluntary reporting period, may be
able to return to the sport within 2 to 5 years. They’ll have to
do community service such as youth club coaching before
regaining their eligibility, FIFA said.  The players weren’t named in FIFA’s statement.  The charges date to 2011, FIFA said. In July of that year,
South Korean prosecutors indicted players from six of the K-
League’s 16 teams on charges they accepted bribes to influence
games.  Most of the indicted players had been forced by colleagues
and gang members to take part in match fixing, the prosecutors’
office in Changwon, about 400 kilometers (250 miles) southeast
of  Seoul , said at the time.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
