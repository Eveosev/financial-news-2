Cooking oil imports by  India , the
world’s second-largest user, probably jumped in December after
palm oil prices slumped to a three-year low and farmers curbed
domestic oilseed sales.  Purchases rose 34 percent to 900,000 metric tons in
December from 669,912 tons a year earlier, according to the
median of estimates from five processors and brokers compiled by
Bloomberg. Imports of crude and refined palm oils probably
gained 38 percent to 750,000 tons from 543,830 tons, the survey
showed. The  Solvent Extractors’ Association of India  will
publish data next week.  Palm oil dropped 23 percent in Kuala Lumpur last year, the
worst slump since the financial crisis in 2008, as slowdowns in
Europe and  China  curbed demand, boosting stockpiles in Indonesia
and  Malaysia , the biggest producers. Increased imports by India,
the biggest palm oil buyer, may help pare inventories and stem
the slide in futures. Reserves in Malaysia rose 2.4 percent to a
record 2.63 million tons in December from a month earlier, the
Palm Oil Board said today.  “Prices have been cheaper than last year and there is good
demand,” said Govindlal G. Patel, managing partner at GG Patel
& Nikhil Research Co. “The local soybean harvesting is going
on, but the oil content in the seed is lower and availability of
oil is not comfortable.”  Futures Rebound  Palm oil for delivery in March fell as much as 2.3  percent
to 2,356 ringgit ($777) a ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange and was at 2,377 ringgit at 4:06 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur .
Futures have rebounded 7.2 percent after slumping to a three-
year low of 2,217 ringgit on Dec. 13.  India may buy a record quantity of palm oil in January as
Malaysian exporters are boosting crude palm oil sales to benefit
from zero tax on shipments, the extractors’ group said Dec. 20.
Malaysia allowed duty-free exports after fixing the average
price for calculating the tax at 2,147.81 ringgit a ton for this
month, below a minimum threshold of 2,250 ringgit.  “The Malaysians are aggressively looking to sell their
supplies because of the zero tax,” Patel said by phone from the
western Indian city of Rajkot. India buys palm oil from
Indonesia and Malaysia, and  soybean oil  from Brazil and
 Argentina .  Crude  soybean oil  imports probably jumped to 40,000 tons in
December from 7,387 tons a year earlier, while sunflower oil
purchases may have declined to 70,000 tons from 94,000 tons, the
survey showed.  Cooking oil imports surged 17 percent to an all-time high
of 10.2 million tons in the year ended Oct. 31, according to
data from the extractors’ association. Inventories, including
those at ports and in the pipeline, were 1.5 million tons as of
Jan. 1, said Sandeep Bajoria, chief executive officer at Mumbai-
based Sunvin Group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
