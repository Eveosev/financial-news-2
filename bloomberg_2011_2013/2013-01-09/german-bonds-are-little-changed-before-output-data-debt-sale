Portuguese  government securities 
dropped, with two-year yields rising the most in five weeks, on
bets the nation will sell bonds for the first time since its
international bailout after Ireland sold debt yesterday.  Portugal ’s two-year notes dropped for a fourth day on
concern the supply of the securities will increase after Ireland
raised 2.5 billion euros ($3.27 billion) in its first so-called
syndicated sale in three years. Germany’s  10-year bunds  rose for
a third day as a report showed the nation’s  industrial
production  rose less than economists predicted in November,
boosting demand for the euro area’s safest assets. Spanish bonds
fell before an auction tomorrow.  Portugal’s securities have fallen amid “speculation that
it, too, may follow Ireland in selling bonds through banks,”
said Soeren Moerch, head of government bond trading at  Danske
Bank A/S (DANSKE)  in Copenhagen. “We recommend that investors buy them
into weakness.”  The  yield  on Portuguese two-year notes rose 11 basis
points, or 0.11 percentage point, to 3.90 percent as of 4:26
p.m. London time. It earlier climbed as much as 43 basis points,
the most since Nov. 30. The 3.6 percent security maturing in
October 2014 fell 0.185, or 1.85 euros per 1,000-euro face
amount, to 99.525.  The  10-year rate  was three basis points higher at 6.49
percent after rising 24 basis points, the biggest increase since
Nov. 9. Portugal last sold 10-year securities on Jan. 12, 2011,
at an average yield of 6.72 percent, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Portuguese Aid  Portugal applied for a bailout from the so-called troika of
the  European Central Bank , the European Union and the
 International Monetary Fund  in April 2011.  Ireland attracted around 7 billion euros of orders for its
five-year notes, the Dublin-based National Treasury Management
Agency said in a statement yesterday. Prime Minister  Enda Kenny 
said the sale was a success and a sign that investors “are
looking at Ireland and see that the country has made progress.”  Irish five-year notes rose for a second day as the head of
the country’s debt management agency said he will meet with
investors next month to gauge their appetite for government
securities after yesterday’s sale.  Investors are “voting with their money” on Ireland while
speculative players or “fast money” have gone,  John Corrigan ,
the NTMA’s Chief Executive Officer, told reporters in Dublin
today.  The yield on Irish notes maturing in October 2017 fell four
basis points to 3.18 percent.  Bund Yields  German 10-year bund yields declined one basis point to 1.48
percent, after dropping four basis points in the past two days.
The rate climbed to 1.56 percent on Jan. 4, the highest since
Oct. 26.  German output rose 0.2 percent from October, when it fell a
revised 2 percent, the Economy Ministry in Berlin said.
Economists had forecast a gain of 1 percent, according to the
median of 23 estimates in a  Bloomberg News survey .  “The omens are for a slightly better environment in
2013,” said Piet Lammens, head of research at KBC Bank NV in
Brussels. “Last week we saw a sharp move higher in bund yields,
which was a repositioning of investors into the new year. We
don’t see the move higher in the bunds price early this week as
important from a longer-term perspective.”  Germany ’s Federal Finance Agency sold 5 billion euros of
0.5 percent securities due in February 2018 at an average yield
of 0.53 percent, compared with 0.41 percent at the previous
auction of similar-maturity notes on Nov. 28.  ECB Decision  ECB policy makers will keep the main  refinancing rate  at a
record-low 0.75 percent tomorrow, according to the median
forecast of 55 analysts in a separate Bloomberg survey. Five
predict the central bank will lower the rate to 0.5 percent.  Volatility on Italian bonds was the highest in euro-region
markets today, followed by Greece and Spain, according to
measures of 10-year or equivalent-maturity debt, the spread
between two-and 10-year securities, and credit default swaps.  Spain  is scheduled to sell as much as 5 billion euros of
government debt tomorrow at its first auction this year. It
plans to sell a new 2.75 percent note due in 2015, as well as
securities maturing in 2018 and 2026.  The Spanish 10-year bond yield rose five basis points to
5.12 percent. The rate on similar-maturity Italian debt was
little changed at 4.27 percent.  German bonds lost 1.1 percent this month through yesterday,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Portuguese debt fell
0.7 percent, while Spanish securities gained 1.3 percent, the
indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
