operated at 89.1 percent of their operable capacity last week.
Gasoline production decreased last week, averaging 8.4 million
barrels per day. Distillate fuel production increased last week,
averaging over 4.9 million barrels per day.  U.S. crude oil imports averaged 8.3 million barrels per day last
