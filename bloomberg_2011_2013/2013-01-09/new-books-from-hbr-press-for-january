Conscious Capitalism: Liberating the Heroic Spirit of Business  
by John Mackey and Rajendra S. Sisodia Whole Foods Market cofounder John Mackey and professor Raj Sisodia argue for the inherent good of both business and capitalism. Featuring some of today's best-known companies, Mackey and Sisodia illustrate how these two forces can — and do — work most powerfully to create value for all stakeholders: including customers, employees, suppliers, investors, society, and the environment: "We believe that business is good because it creates value, it is ethical because it is based on voluntary exchange, it is noble because it can elevate our existence, and it is heroic because it lifts people out of poverty and creates prosperity. Free-enterprise capitalism is the most powerful system for social cooperation and human progress ever conceived. It is one of the most compelling ideas we humans have ever had. But we can aspire to something even greater." Creative Conspiracy: The New Rules of Breakthrough Collaboration  
by Leigh Thompson  Think of your to-do list at work. Chances are the most important tasks require you to work with others — and the success of those endeavors depends on the effectiveness of your collaboration. According to management expert Leigh Thompson, collaboration that is conscious, planned, and focused on generating new ideas builds excitement and produces what she calls a "creative conspiracy." Teams that conspire to organize themselves, motivate one another, and combine their talents to meet creative challenges are the hallmark of the most successful organizations.

by Rodolphe Durand and Jean-Philippe Vergne When capitalism spread along the trade routes toward the Indies...when radio opened an era of mass communication...when the Internet became part of the global economy...pirates were there. And although most people see pirates as solitary anarchists out to destroy capitalism, it turns out the opposite is true. They are the ones who forge the path. In  The Pirate Organization , Rodolphe Durand and Jean-Philippe Vergne argue that piracy drives capitalism's evolution and foreshadows the direction of the economy.
