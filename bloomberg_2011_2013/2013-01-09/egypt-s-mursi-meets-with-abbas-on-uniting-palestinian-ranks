Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi and
his Palestinian counterpart met today to discuss reconciliation
between Mahmoud Abbas’ Fatah party and Gaza’s Islamist rulers,
the state-run Middle East News Agency reported.  Abbas had arrived earlier in the day and was preceded by
Hamas political chief Khaled Mashaal, who was also to meet with
Egyptian officials, MENA reported. The two groups pledged to
work toward reconciliation in November after the United Nations
General Assembly voted to recognize  Palestine  as a non-member
observer state.  The meeting between Mursi, an Islamist fielded by the
Muslim Brotherhood last year for the presidency, and Abbas
focused on unifying the Palestinian ranks ahead of any upcoming
peace talks, MENA reported. The discussions also looked at ways
of lifting the blockade on the Gaza Strip, it said.  Mursi earned international accolades by helping broker a
cease-fire between Hamas and  Israel  in November, ending an
eight-day round of violence between the two sides.  The Cairo-based agency also said that the U.S. peace envoy,
David Hale, arrived today in  Egypt  for meetings with Egyptian
officials.  To contact the reporter on this story:
