European Union antitrust regulators
would need to assess any plans by telecommunications companies
to share their infrastructure or networks, said Antoine Colombani, a spokesman for the European Commission.  Such a program “would be the initiative of these companies
only and does not originate from the commission,” Colombani
said in an e-mailed statement. “The effects on competition of
such plans would have to be assessed.”  EU Competition Commissioner  Joaquin Almunia  met on Nov. 28
with representatives of  Telefonica SA (TEF) , Belgacom SA,  Koninklijke
KPN NV (KPN) ,  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) ,  France Telecom SA (FTE) ’s Orange and
 Telecom Italia SpA (TIT) , Colombani said. While Almunia told the
companies that it would be desirable to have a single market for
telecommunications, the possibility of sharing infrastructure or
networks wasn’t discussed at the meeting, Colombani said.  The FT reported earlier today that telecoms executives were
talking about sharing their infrastructure networks in Europe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
