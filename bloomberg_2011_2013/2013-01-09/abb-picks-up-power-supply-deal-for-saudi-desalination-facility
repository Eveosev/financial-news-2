ABB Ltd. (ABBN)  won an order for high-
voltage gas-insulated switchgear to help supply power to a water
desalination plant in Saudi Arabia and support grid integration
of a 2.5-gigawatt power-generation plant. No terms were
disclosed by the largest power-transformer maker.  The facilities are being developed by the Saline Water
Conversion Corp., the Saudi government agency responsible for
desalinating seawater and the second-biggest electric power
producer in the country. The order was received from Al Fanar
Group, an engineering and construction company, ABB said.  The desalination plant, expected to be commissioned in June
2014, is in Yanbu, a port on the  Red Sea  in western Saudi
Arabia. The plant will be able to produce 550,000 cubic meters
of desalinated water a day, Zurich-based ABB said.  Saudi Arabia 
is the world’s largest producer of desalinated water and SWCC
operates 27 desalination stations producing at least 3 million
cubic meters a day of potable water, ABB said in a statement.  The new plants will “help address the country’s increasing
need for potable water and also support the growing demand for
electricity,” Giandomenico Rivetti, head of ABB’s High Voltage
products business, part of the Power Products division, said in
today’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
