The global default rate for high-
yield debt dropped 0.6 percentage point in the fourth quarter to
end 2012 at 2.6 percent, according to a report from Moody’s
Investors Service.  The ratings company’s trailing 12-month global speculative-
grade default rate fell from 3.2 percent in the third quarter
and remains below the 4.8 percent historical average in data
going back to 1983, New York-based Moody’s said. The rate is
higher than the 1.9 percent recorded in 2011.  “The low interest rate policy pursued by the Fed and other
central banks prompted both investment-grade and speculative-
grade rated companies to  sell  more bonds,” Moody’s said in a
report dated yesterday.  U.S. speculative-grade defaults fell to 3.2 percent in
December, down from 3.6 percent in the previous quarter and
compared with 1.9 percent at the end of 2011. High-risk, high-
yield bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody’s and lower than BBB-
by  Standard & Poor’s .  The worldwide total of corporate defaults rose in 2012,
with 58 Moody’s-rated corporate debt issuers defaulting compared
with 38 the prior year, the ratings company said. Ten defaults
were recorded in the last quarter, according to the report.  The ratings company expects the global rate to rise to 3
percent by the end of this year, as the economic recovery
remains weak and sovereign debt woes “will probably linger.”
The rate should reach 3.3 percent in  Europe  and 3 percent in the
U.S. in 2013, Moody’s said, with the advertising, printing and
publishing industries leading defaults in the world’s largest
economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
