Brazil ’s swap rates dropped after a
report showed inflation slowed more than forecast, fueling
speculation that the central bank will keep borrowing costs at
record lows to support the economy.  Swap rates due in January 2015 fell one basis point, or
0.01 percentage point, to 7.78 percent at 10:12 a.m. in  Sao
Paulo  after rising nine basis points yesterday, the most this
month. The real slid 0.1 percent to 2.0437 per dollar.  The IGP-M  price index  increased 0.41 percent in the 10 days
through Dec. 31 from a month earlier after climbing 0.69 percent
in the prior period, the Getulio Vargas Foundation reported
today. The median forecast of 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
was for a 0.5 percent advance. The gauge is composed of 60
percent producer prices, 30 percent consumer prices and 10
percent construction costs.  “Local swap rates should be responding to the inflation
indicators,” Octavio de Barros, an economist at Banco Bradesco
SA, wrote in an e-mailed report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
