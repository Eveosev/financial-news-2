Ecuador ’s economy, South America’s
seventh biggest, is growing at its weakest pace since 2010 as
lower oil prices and limited financing options after a 2008
default crimped government spending and cooled domestic demand.  Gross domestic product expanded 4.7 percent in the third
quarter from the previous  year  and 1.5 percent from the prior
 quarter , the central bank said today in a report on its  website .
The bank revised down figures for second-quarter growth to 4.6
percent from a previously reported 5.2 percent, the lowest
yearly reading since the third quarter of 2010.  Ecuador’s government, which depends on oil sales for about
44 percent of its revenue, used public spending to boost growth
in 2012, Economic Policy Minister Jeannette Sanchez said
yesterday. As oil prices fell last year, revenues declined,
which limits the amount the government can spend to stimulate
the economy, said Capital Markets economist Michael Henderson.  “Under Correa you’ve basically seen government spending
driving growth,” Henderson, who forecasts 4 percent annual
growth in 2012 and 2.5 percent in 2013, said Jan. 2 in a
telephone interview from  London . “You’re going to see domestic
demand slow further and pretty much we expect that to translate
into a halving of growth rates from 2012 to 2013.”  Prices for WTI crude sold in New York, Ecuador’s benchmark,
slid 5.8 to $91.82 in 2012, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Ecuador, a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, may see oil prices decline further to about $85 a
barrel in 2013, Henderson said.  Spending, Growth  Ecuador, which uses the U.S. dollar as its official
currency, has had limited access to foreign credit since
defaulting on $3.2 billion of international bonds in 2008 and
2009.  Since then, the country has relied on oil sales, tax
increases and loans from  China  to help finance the budget.  President Rafael Correa, a self-described socialist
revolutionary running for re-election Feb. 17, said last month
the government needs about $6 billion, or 7.75 percent of
forecast GDP, to finance public spending this year.  Ecuador reached a deal with China for an additional $2
billion loan to cover the budget gap, the Finance Ministry said
in December.  The central bank in July lowered its forecast for economic
growth this year to 4.8 percent from an earlier estimate of 5.35
percent.  In 2013, the economy is expected to expand 4 percent, less
than the bank’s earlier forecast of 4.37 percent growth, the
bank said.  The yield on Ecuador’s 9.375 percent bonds maturing in 2015
fell 2 basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.43 percent
as of 3:11 p.m.  Quito  time, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The bond’s price rose 0.4 cents to $102.40 cents on
the dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
