 FAL Oil Co., a United Arab Emirates-
based energy trader thatâ€™s under U.S. financial restrictions for
links to  Iran , suspended debt restructuring talks with lenders
on Dec. 10, a company official said.  The trader of marine fuel and other refined products is
working on a business plan that would allow it to resume talks
with lenders later this month, said the official who is involved
in the financing process and asked not to be identified by name
because of company policy.  FAL Oil, based in the U.A.E. emirate of Sharjah, is seeking
to revive fuel supply agreements with regional state refiners to
show lenders it would be able to generate income and allow it to
reach a debt repayment agreement, the official said. Companies
that FAL is approaching include refiners in  Sri Lanka ,  India  and
 Bangladesh  as well as in the Horn of  Africa , the official said.  Energy-trading companies faced additional cash-flow
difficulties since the global financial crisis began in 2008
because banks restricted lending amid rising commodity prices.
FAL, once one of the largest ship-fuel suppliers in the U.A.E.,
is trying to extend maturity of about $700 million of loans that
are already in default.  Debt restructuring talks with 14 lenders foundered last
month as the company needs to raise about $300 million to $400
million in working capital from the creditors to continue
operations, the FAL official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
