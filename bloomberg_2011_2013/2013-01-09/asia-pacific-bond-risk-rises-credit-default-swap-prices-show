The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region from non-payment
increased, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index rose 1 basis point to 113
basis points as of 11:08 a.m. in Sydney, according to Australia
& New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. The index is on course for its
highest close since Jan. 4, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  gained 1 basis point to 104.5 as of 8:18
a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices show.
The gauge is set for its highest close since Jan. 3, according
to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices
quoted by dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index climbed 1 1/2 basis points to
143 basis points as of 9:09 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices
show. The index is on track for its first increase this year,
according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
