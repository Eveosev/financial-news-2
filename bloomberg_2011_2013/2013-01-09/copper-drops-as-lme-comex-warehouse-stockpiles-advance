Copper declined as inventories at
London Metal Exchange warehouses climbed to the highest level in
11 months, prompting concerns over the demand.  Metal for delivery in three months on the LME fell as much
as 0.3 percent to $8,059.75 a metric ton, before trading at
$8,071.75 at 11:17 a.m. Shanghai time. Futures for delivery in
April traded little changed at 58,260  yuan  ($9,358) a ton on the
Shanghai Futures Exchange.  Stockpiles at the LME warehouses gained 2.5 percent
yesterday to 327,375 tons, the highest since Feb. 2 last year,
bourse data showed. Those held at  warehouses  monitored by Comex
were at 70,712 tons as of Jan. 7, the highest since May 7, while
inventories tallied by the SHFE increased to 206,458 tons last
week, the highest in eight months.  “The huge inventories are weighing on copper prices,
curbing any rally in spite of a strong expectation of a demand
revival,” said Cao Yanghui, an analyst at Nanhua Futures Co.
“There is no strong positive news or data right now to drive it
higher, and we’ll probably have to wait till March to see
whether the consumption can really improve in  China .”  Futures for March delivery on the Comex in  New York  traded
little changed at $3.625 per pound. On the LME, lead and tin
declined, while zinc gained.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
