Serbia  adopted new policy guidelines
for future talks with the breakaway province of Kosovo as part
of the Balkan country’s efforts to get a date for the start of
European Union membership talks.  Prime Minister  Ivica Dacic  will continue talks with Kosovo
representatives next week in Brussels and “any agreement should
contribute to Serbia’s European integration,” he told reporters
in Belgrade today.  Serbia, formally a candidate for EU membership since March
last year, may get a date for the start of entry talks by June
if it shows enough progress in mending ties with Kosovo, the
European Commission said on Dec. 12.  The guidelines, adopted unanimously by Dacic’s Cabinet and
President Tomislav Nikolic and submitted to Parliament, won’t
focus on the status of the former province, which unilaterally
declared independence in 2008.  Serbia has vowed never to recognize Kosovo’s independence.
Leaders want to talk about the rights of Serbs who live in
 Kosovo , especially in its north, the home to the largest Serbian
community, by offering solutions how they should live safely and
have their own institutions, including a right to personal
documents without Kosovo citizenship.  “It won’t be easy,” Dacic said. The initiative “reflects
our desire to get a date for the start of accession talks as
quickly as possible.” The European Commission will probably
disclose its initial opinion in February or March, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
