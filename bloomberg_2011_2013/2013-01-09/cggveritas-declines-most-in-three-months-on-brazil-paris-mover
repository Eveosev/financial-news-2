CGGVeritas (GA) , the largest seismic
surveyor of oilfields, slumped by the most in more than three
months in Paris trading after saying potential deals in  Brazil 
failed to “fully materialize” by the end of the year.  The company fell as much as 6 percent, the biggest drop
since Sept. 24, to 21.65 euros, the lowest level since Nov. 19.
So-called multiclient sales are seen falling to $150 million in
the fourth quarter, from $199 million a year earlier, on Brazil.  Today’s release suggests 2012 estimates are “challenging”
and may be lowered, Gilbert Dupont analysts wrote in a report.  “Significant potential deals discussed with main clients
did not fully materialize by the year-end due to uncertainty
remaining on the future offshore blocks to be licensed in the
upcoming 2013 bid rounds,” CGGVeritas said in a statement.  It fell 5.4 percent to 21.79 euros by 10 a.m. in Paris.  The company rose 31 percent last year as offshore oil and
gas producers have boosted spending on exploration amid growing
energy demand and depleting resources. Seismic surveyors like
CGGVeritas use ships to search for oilfields under the seabed.  The company agreed last year to buy Fugro NV’s geoscience
division for 1.2 billion euros ($1.6 billion) to benefit from an
expected recovery in the rates for surveying. The purchase will
add four seismic-survey vessels to CGGVeritas’s fleet.  To contact the reporter on this story:
