Canadian  stocks  rose a second day,
led by raw-material shares, as First Quantum Minerals Ltd. took
its C$5.1 billion bid for  Inmet Mining Corp. (IMN)  hostile and  Alcoa
Inc. (AA)  said aluminum demand will recover.  Inmet, which is developing the Cobre Panama copper mine in
Panama, rose 0.7 percent. First Quantum fell 1.5 percent.
 Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PRE)  added 3 percent after the company,
which explores for oil and gas in Colombia, said profit likely
jumped 48 percent last year. TransCanada Corp. gained 1.5
percent after agreeing to build and operate a C$5 billion
pipeline to a natural gas export terminal in British Columbia.  The  Standard & Poorâ€™s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  rose 16.61
points, or 0.1 percent, to 12,521.42 at 10:09 a.m. in Toronto.
The benchmark gauge has gained 0.7 percent this year, trailing
every developed market in the world.  Alcoa, which reported earnings yesterday, said aluminum
prices are rising as demand in  China  and the U.S. increases
while record amounts are being shut away in warehouses as part
of financing deals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
