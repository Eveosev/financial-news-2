Vitol Group failed to buy  North Sea 
Forties crude for a third day. Statoil ASA again offered cargoes
of Ekofisk and Oseberg blend without finding a buyer.  Iraq  halted exports via the Turkish port of Ceyhan because
of a fault on a pipeline, according to state-run North Oil Co.
Five Angolan crude shipments for loading in February remain
available, said three traders who participate in the market.  North Sea  Vitol bid without finding a seller for a Forties cargo
loading Jan. 28 to Feb. 3 at $1.45 a barrel more than Dated
Brent, 5 cents lower than yesterday, a Bloomberg survey of
traders and brokers monitoring the Platts pricing window showed.
That compares with a Jan. 21 to Jan. 23 lot it bought at a $1.50
premium on Jan. 4.  Statoil offered Oseberg shipment 20130104 for loading from
Jan. 24 to Jan. 26 at $1.60 more than Dated Brent, 10 cents less
than yesterday, according to the survey.  The Norway-based producer also sought to sell Ekofisk
consignment C11318 for Jan. 25 to Jan. 27 at $1.50 more than
Dated Brent without finding a buyer, the survey showed.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m.  London  time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days rose one cent to $1.55 more than Dated Brent, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. That is the most since March 9.  Brent for February settlement traded at $111.64 a barrel on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London at the close of the
window, compared with $111.69 in the previous session. The March
contract was at $110.76, a discount of 88 cents to February.  A Forties cargo for loading in January was advanced by one
day, the first change to this month’s program, according to
three people with knowledge of the loading schedule.  Consignment F0110 will now load from Jan. 17 to Jan. 19,
said the people, asking not to be identified because the
information is confidential.  Mediterranean/Urals  Petraco SpA failed to buy Russian Urals crude at a $1.10
discount to Dated Brent on a delivered basis to Rotterdam,
according to the Platts survey. That compares with the company’s
unsuccessful bid of $1.25 less than Dated Brent on Jan. 2.  The Urals differential to Dated Brent in the Mediterranean
was at minus 78 cents, 2 cents narrower than yesterday,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In northwest  Europe ,
the  discount  increased to $1.38 from $1.35 in the previous
session, the data showed.  PKN Orlen SA, Poland’s largest oil company, is seeking to
buy Urals for loading from two Baltic ports on Jan. 24 to Jan.
28, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.  Orlen plans to buy 100,000 metric tons from either Ust-Luga
or Primorsk, the people said asking not to be identified because
the information is confidential. It earlier this week bought a
Jan. 21 to Jan. 25 cargo from OAO Lukoil’s Litasco unit.  The halt of Iraqi crude exports via the Ceyhan pipeline
took effect earlier today at the request of Turkish authorities,
North Oil said in an e-mailed statement. About 425,000 barrels a
day were being shipped prior to the stoppage. That export route
is often disrupted by sabotage attacks and technical faults.  West Africa  Benchmark Nigerian Qua Iboe blend dropped one cent to $2.37
a barrel more than Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Unsold Angolan grades for export next month include two
shipments of Pazflor, and one each of Dalia, Hungo and Saturno,
said the people, who declined to be identified because the
information is confidential. All lots are for 950,000 barrels.  Angola plans to export 50 cargoes totaling 1.7 million
barrels a day in February, compared with 59 lots for January,
according to a revised shipping schedule obtained by  Bloomberg
News . Two Saturno consignments were added to the original plan.
The program for March is scheduled to be released next week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
