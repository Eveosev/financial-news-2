Blackstone Group LP (BX) , the largest
private U.S. real estate investor, is in talks with  Deutsche
Bank AG (DBK)  to double its line of credit for buying single-family
rental homes to $1.2 billion, according to two people with
knowledge of the negotiations.  Deutsche Bank extended a $600 million line of credit in
October to Blackstone to pay for the properties. The Frankfurt-
based lender will lead a group of banks that will contribute an
additional $600 million, according to the people, who asked to
be identified because the talks are private.  Blackstone has been spending about $100 million a week on
homes in states such as California, Arizona, Florida and Nevada
to take advantage of prices below replacement cost and rising
demand for rentals, Chairman Stephen Schwarzman said in October.  Renee Calabro , a spokeswoman for Deutsche Bank in New York,
and Christine Anderson, a spokeswoman for New York-based
Blackstone, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
