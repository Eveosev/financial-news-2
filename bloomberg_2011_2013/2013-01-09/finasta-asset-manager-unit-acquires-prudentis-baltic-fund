Lithuanian investment bank Finasta AB
said its asset management unit acquired the  Prudentis Baltic
Fund (PRUBALT) , which invests in publicly traded companies that work in
Lithuania, Latvia and  Estonia .  Finasta Asset Management UAB will keep the same investment
strategy as the previous  fund manager , Prudentis UAB, the
Vilnius, Lithuania-based bank  said  on its website today.  The fund had total assets of 619,550 euros ($811,110) on
Jan. 7 and a one-year return of 1.43 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Economic growth rates in the Baltic
region that are among the European Unionâ€™s fastest will help
improve performance and attract new investors, Finasta said.  Finasta is owned by now-defunct Lithuanian lender Bankas
Snoras AB, whose administrator is seeking a buyer for the
private banking and wealth-management subsidiary.  To contact the reporter on this story:
