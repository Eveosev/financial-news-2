Iron ore , which posted the biggest
quarterly climb on record in the final three months of 2012, may
extend gains from a 14-month high as Chinese mills restock, then
tumble into a  bear market , according to Deutsche Bank AG.  Prices may rise to $170 a ton in the first half on demand
in the biggest buyer, before falling to less than $120 as supply
expands, Deutsche Bank said in a report. Ore with 62 percent
content delivered to Tianjin rose to $158.50 a dry ton
yesterday, the highest since October 2011, according to data
from the Steel Index Ltd. A drop from $170 to $120 implies a 29
percent fall, more than the 20 percent that typically defines a
bear market.  The steelmaking raw material rallied 39 percent in the
three months through December, the biggest gain since at least
2009, as demand in  China  rebounded on optimism the world’s
second-largest economy is recovering. Gross domestic product is
poised to expand 8.1 percent this year, from 7.7 percent in
2012, according to the median estimate of economists surveyed
last month by Bloomberg.  Baoshan Iron & Steel Co. (600019) , China’s
largest steelmaker, said on Jan. 7 that it will raise product
prices.  “We could see a minor pullback if  steel mills  aren’t able
to pass on the full extent of these rising input costs to end
users and if demand doesn’t adequately match the recent build in
supplies,” Natalie Rampono, an analyst at  Australia  & New
Zealand Banking Group Ltd., said in an interview today, without
providing a specific forecast. “There could be some risk to the
downside from higher input costs.”  Walsh’s View  Iron ore  swaps for January fell 0.7 percent to $151 a dry
ton by 11 a.m. in  London , according to GFI Group Inc. That’s the
highest for the coming month since October 2011, according to
data from SGX Asiaclear, the largest clearer of the contracts.
The forwards anticipate prices retreating to $125.50 a ton by
September, GFI’s figures show.  The spike in iron ore prices is likely to be temporary, the
Australian newspaper said Jan. 3, citing  Sam Walsh , Rio Tinto
Group’s iron ore and Australia chief executive officer. Rising
Chinese demand has created conditions for a last run up in
prices, Credit Suisse Group AG said Jan. 3, forecasting an
average $130 a ton in the first quarter and $125 in the second.  “The theme for iron ore in 2013 could be a tale of two
halves in our view: strength in H1 and weakness in H2,”
Deutsche Bank analysts  Daniel Brebner  and Xiao Fu said in the
report dated yesterday. Inventories of steel and iron ore have
fallen “considerably within China over the past two quarters.”  Port Inventories  Inventories of ore held in Chinese ports declined for four
straight months through to December, touching 70.54 million tons
on Dec. 28, the lowest level since September 2010, according to
data from Beijing Antaike Information Development Co. The
reserves were at 72.97 million tons as of the week to Jan. 4.  Baoshan Iron & Steel said on Jan. 7 that it will raise hot-
rolled product prices by 160  yuan  ($25.70) per ton for February
delivery. Jiangsu Shagang Co. raised its rebar prices Jan. 1,
according to Shenyin Wanguo Futures Co. Further increases in
Chinese steel prices are needed to sustain iron ore above $150 a
ton,  Commonwealth Bank of Australia  said yesterday.  Iron ore is measured in dry tons, or metric tons less
moisture. At Tianjin port moisture can account for 8 percent to
10 percent of the ore’s weight.  Australia and  Brazil  are the two biggest exporters and
accounted for about 73 percent of world seaborne supply in 2012,
according to Credit Suisse. China buys about 65 percent of
seaborne shipments.  To contact the reporters for this story:
