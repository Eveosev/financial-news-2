Petkim Petrokimya Holding AS (PETKM) , a
Turkish petrochemicals maker, surged to the highest level in
almost 13 years as investors speculated it will reduce costs
while benefitting from government incentives.  The  shares  advanced 7.5 percent to 3.15 liras at the close
in Istanbul today, the highest close since March 2000. Petkim
has gained 51 percent since Oct. 15, when parent State Oil Co.
of  Azerbaijan , known as Socar, said it will invest as much as $8
billion by 2016 on projects including a refinery, a new port and
power plants.  “Four key developments have led to the surge,” HSBC
analyst Bulent Yurdagul said in a phone interview today. “The
prospects of importing naphtha from  Iraq  and buying gas directly
from parent Socar, the refinery investment and the securing of
government incentives for such investments.”  Petkim said Dec. 21 that it will start imports of naphtha,
its most important raw material item in terms of costs, from
neighboring Iraq. On Dec. 25, the company said it received
approval to buy as much as 455 million cubic meters of natural
gas a year directly from Socar, an amount which could cut annual
costs by $10 million to $15 million, Yurdagul said.  Turkish government incentives also saved Socar $1.5 billion
on its Star Refinery project, Vatan newspaper reported on Dec.
29.  The company will benefit from “integration with the Star
project,” BGC Istanbul Securities analyst Ezgi Yilmaz said in
an e-mailed report today. BGC raised the company’s target price
to 4.34 liras a share from 2.46 liras.  Petkim reported net income of 15.3 million liras on 1.1
billion liras in revenue in the third quarter of 2012, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company had reported losses
in the previous three quarters, according to the data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
