South  Korea ’s government bonds were
little changed, keeping the five-year yield at the lowest level
since November, and the won was just shy of a 17-month high
before the central bank reviews  interest rates  this week.  The Bank of Korea will leave its  seven-day repurchase rate 
at 2.75 percent when policy makers meet on Jan. 11, according to
all but one of 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. One forecast a
25 basis point cut, after similar moves at reviews in July and
October.  South Korea ’s  jobless rate  held at 3 percent in
December -- the lowest it has been in data going back to 1999 --
as the number of employed people increased by 277,000, a
government report showed today.  “Increased anxiety over the Bank of Korea’s rate decision
due later this week is limiting moves of the bonds,” said Kyung
Hee Jung, fixed-income strategist at Shinhan Investment Corp. in
 Seoul . “The  Bank of Korea  is likely to leave rates unchanged
this month as there are some signs the economy is improving.”  The yield on South Korea’s 2.75 percent bonds due September
2017 was unchanged at 2.87 percent, the lowest since Nov. 21,
according to Korea Exchange prices. The rate declined four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, yesterday and is down 10 basis
points for the year.  The won traded at 1,062.70 per dollar as of 10:41 a.m. in
Seoul, little changed from 1,062.90 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It has strengthened 9.2 percent in the
past 12 months and touched 1,060.50 on Jan. 7, the strongest
level since Aug. 4, 2011.  Herd Behavior  Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan said last week he was
concerned about herd behavior in the foreign-exchange market and
may introduce measures to curb won volatility. The central bank
is unlikely to cut interest rates to stem the currency’s
appreciation, Nomura Inc. said in a research note published
today.  “A stronger Korean won is a reflection of improvements in
global growth and the risk backdrop,” Nomura analysts including
Kwon Young Sun, who is based in  Hong Kong , wrote in the report.
“The strong currency would hurt the economy only if it became
substantially overvalued. Korean exporters can still enjoy price
competitiveness.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
