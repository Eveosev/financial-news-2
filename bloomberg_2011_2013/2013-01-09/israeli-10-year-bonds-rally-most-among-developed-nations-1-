Israel’s 10-year bonds rallied the
most among developed nations after new debt issuance sapped
demand and pushed prices to the lowest level in a month.  Yields on 4.25 percent notes due June 2023 fell seven basis
points, or 0.7 percentage point, the biggest decline among
similar-maturity sovereign debt of 23 developed nations tracked
by Bloomberg, to 3.98 percent at the close in Tel Aviv.  Government bonds  weakened earlier in the week, with yields
on 2023 securities gaining 12 basis points Jan. 7 to 4.08
percent, the highest level since Dec. 5. The Finance Ministry
sold 2.8 billion shekels ($740 million) in its first debt
auction of the year that day. Israel Aerospace Industries
accepted institutional commitments for 1.09 billion shekels of
its series Gimmel bonds, also issued Jan. 7.  “The corporate and government issues of the past few days
caused pressure on bond prices and a rise in yields,” Shuki Arditi, head of trading at  Leader Capital Markets (LDRC) , said by phone
in Tel Aviv. “Today, the pressure is off and yields are falling
again.”  The  Finance Ministry  selected Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
Barclays Plc and Citigroup Inc. as underwriters for a potential
dollar-denominated bond offering in the U.S., it said today.
Israel will find 14 billion shekels of savings by reducing
spending rather than boosting taxes and may raise funds on
international or domestic markets, Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz said in an interview at Bloomberg’s headquarters in  New
York  yesterday.  The shekel weakened for a second day, declining 0.1 percent
to 3.7793 per dollar by 11:07 a.m. in New York. One-year
 interest-rate swaps , an indicator of investor expectations for
borrowing costs over the next 12 months, fell two basis points,
or 0.02 percentage point, to 1.69 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
