Enel Green Power SpA (EGPW) , the renewable
energy unit of Italy’s largest utility, started one new Spanish
wind farm and re-powered three others, connecting a total of 29
megawatts to the grid.  Enel Green Power’s Spanish subsidiary completed the 18-
megawatt Agreda wind farm in northern Spain’s Castile and Leon
region, the Rome-based company said today in an e-mailed
statement. The plant is forecast to generate about 48 million
kilowatt-hours of power per year, it said.  The Spanish unit also upgraded and connected to the grid
three wind farms in the  Canary Islands , adding almost 2
megawatts in capacity to bring their combined capacity to 11
megawatts, the company said. The unit, Enel Green Power Espana,
is 60-percent owned by Enel Green Power, and the rest is owned
by  Enel SpA (ENEL) ’s unit Endesa SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
