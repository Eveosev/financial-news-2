boosted bets on rising prices of robusta coffee by more than
fourfold in the week ended Dec. 31, according to the exchange.

contracts a week earlier.  “Technically and fundamentally robusta still looks
bullish, and sell-offs like yesterday are a good buying
opportunity,” Keith Flury, a commodities analyst at Rabobank
International in London, said by e-mail today. “Roasters are
interested in buying robusta, but mostly buying the dips, and
speculators may add more length if prices keep the recent upward
trend.”  Robusta for March delivery advanced 0.9 percent to $1,932 a
ton by 11:05 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in London. Arabica coffee for
March delivery slid 0.6 percent to $1.472 a pound on ICE Futures

ample supplies, even as index funds are expected to buy the
futures due to changes in weightings of commodity indexes.  White, or refined, sugar for March delivery was little
changed at $506 a ton in London. Raw sugar for March delivery

demand,” Luiz Carlos dos Santos Jr., head of sugar brokerage
and operations at brokerage and consultancy SA Commodities, in
Santos,  Brazil , said in a report e-mailed yesterday, commenting
on raw sugar. “That suggests we still have a lot of sugar to be
shipped out of Brazil.”  Cocoa for March delivery was down 0.1 percent to 1,420
