The naira weakened as importers
sought dollars after the Nigerian commercial banks bought the
least amount of the U.S. currency in two months at an auction
today.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer depreciated
0.1 percent to 156.31 a dollar as of 3:30 p.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital, after gaining 0.6 percent yesterday,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Nigereia’s central bank sold $43.2 million, the lowest
since Nov. 7, after offering $100 million to lenders, according
to data on its website. The regulator, which sells dollars at
auctions on Mondays and Wednesday is the major supplier of
foreign exchange. Fuel imports have been a source of pressure on
the naira, according to the Central Bank of Nigeria.  “The reduction tightened supply at the interbank market,
putting naira under pressure,” Tunde Ladipo, chief executive
officer of Lagos-based Valuechain Investment Ltd., said by phone
today.  Nigeria’s  inflation  rate rose for a second month in
November to 12.3 percent from 11.7 percent, the  National Bureau
of Statistics  said Dec. 17. The central bank left the benchmark
interest rate unchanged at 12 percent last year.  “Speculation against the naira likely increased ahead of
the Jan. 7 auction,” Kunle Ezun and Kenneth Asenime, analysts
at  Ecobank Transnational Inc. (ETI)  in Lagos, wrote in an e-mailed
note to clients today.  The rate on the nation’s 10-year naira debt rose 13 basis
points to 11.41 percent, according to yesterday’s prices
compiled on the Financial Markets Dealers Association website.
Yields on the country’s $500 million of Eurobonds due January
2021 was little changed at 3.792 percent.  Ghana ’s cedi appreciated for a second day by 0.2 percent to
1.8855 a dollar in Accra, the capital, heading for its lowest
since Nov. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
