Palm oil  snapped a four-day losing
streak on speculation that falling output in  Malaysia  may help
cut record inventories and as investors reversed bets on further
declines from a two-week low.  The contract for March delivery climbed as much as 0.7
percent to 2,407 ringgit ($791) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange and ended the morning session at 2,402
ringgit. Futures dropped 4.4 percent in the four days through
yesterday to close at the lowest price since Dec. 20.  Palm oil, which constitutes 29 percent of world oil and
fats consumption, has “upward potential” from now to April as
southeast Asian production declines seasonally and heavy rain in
Malaysia threaten to delay harvesting, Oil World said in a
report yesterday. Futures, which slid to a three-year low last
month, have probably bottomed, as stockpiles are reduced, the
Hamburg-based researcher said.  “Production is in a declining period at the moment,” said
Donny Khor, associate director for futures and options at OSK
Investment Bank Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur . “But there is uncertainty
over demand and a lack of clear direction” ahead of key
industry data tomorrow, he said.  Stockpiles in Malaysia were 2.53 million tons in December
compared to the record 2.56 million tons a month earlier,
according to the median of estimates from six analysts and two
plantation companies in a Bloomberg survey published this week.
Official data on holdings in December are scheduled tomorrow.  Traders may be reversing bets on further declines and
futures may trade between 2,350 ringgit and 2,500 ringgit in the
near term, said Khor.  Palm oil for May lost 0.2 percent to 6,832 yuan ($1,098) a
ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange .  Soybean oil  for May fell
0.7 percent to 8,604  yuan  a ton.  Soybeans for March delivery gained 0.2 percent to $13.895 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybean oil for delivery
in March advanced 0.3 percent to 49.70 cents a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
