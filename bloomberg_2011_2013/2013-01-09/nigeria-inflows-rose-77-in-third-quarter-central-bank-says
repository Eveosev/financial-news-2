Foreign capital inflows into  Nigeria ,
 Africa ’s top oil producer, rose 77 percent from the previous
three months to $6.07 billion in the third quarter of 2012, the
 Central Bank of Nigeria  said.  Portfolio flows accounted for 76 percent of total inflows
during the period, with foreign direct investment accounting for
the remainder, the Abuja-based bank said in a Jan. 3  report  on
its website.  “The continued dominance of portfolio investment in
aggregate foreign capital inflows suggests the need to put in
place measures against capital reversal,” the bank said.  The current-account surplus rose to $5.03 billion, or 7.6
percent of gross domestic product, from $5 billion in the second
quarter, according to the report. Exports rose 4.2 percent from
the previous three months to $24.4 billion, and imports fell 22
percent to $12 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
