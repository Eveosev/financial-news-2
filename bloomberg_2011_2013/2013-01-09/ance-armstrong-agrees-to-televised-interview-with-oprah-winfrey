Lance Armstrong  agreed to be
interviewed by  Oprah Winfrey  in his first media appearance since
being stripped of his record seven Tour de France cycling titles
and being banned from Olympic sports for life for doping.  The 90-minute episode of “Oprah’s Next chapter” will air
Jan. 17 at 9 p.m. Eastern time, the Oprah Winfrey Network said
in a  statement  on its website last night. The interview will be
available simultaneously on Oprah.com.  The 41-year-old Armstrong may confess to the use of
performance-enhancing drugs in an effort to reduce his lifetime
ban from events sanctioned by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, which
has said the Texan’s career was “fueled from start to finish by
doping,” the  New York  Times reported Jan. 5.  Armstrong has repeatedly denied using such drugs and blood
infusions to further his cycling career.  Mark Fabiani , a spokesman for Armstrong, didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment about the Winfrey interview.  In another program set to air on Showtime at 10 p.m.
Eastern time tonight, USADA Chief Executive Officer Travis Tygart will say he rejected the offer of a $250,000 donation by
Armstrong to the anti-doping body in 2004.  “I was stunned,” Tygart told interviewer  Scott Pelley  for
the first edition of “ 60 Minutes Sports .” “It was a clear
conflict of interest for USADA.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
