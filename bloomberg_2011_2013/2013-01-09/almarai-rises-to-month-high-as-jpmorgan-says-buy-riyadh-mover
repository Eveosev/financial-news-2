Almarai Co. (ALMARAI) , Saudi Arabia’s largest
food processor by market value, rose to a one-month high as
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  initiated coverage with an overweight
recommendation based on a pick up in sales and margins.  The shares climbed 1.5 percent to 66 riyals, the strongest
level since Dec. 8, at the close in  Riyadh , on 97 percent of
three-month average daily volume. JPMorgan set Almarai’s 12-
month share-price estimate at 87 riyals. The stock helped the
gauge’s 1 percent gain to 7,126.71, the highest since Sept. 17.  Almarai, which is benefiting from a pick up in domestic
demand for poultry and dairy products, may post a 15 percent
advance in profit this year, JPMorgan said.  Saudi Arabia , whose
$727 billion economy expanded 6.8 percent in 2012, is the most-
populous nation in the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council. The
company trades at 16 times estimated 2013 earnings, compared
with 22 times for BRF- Brasil Foods (BRFS3)  SA, the world’s largest
poultry exporter, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “Almarai offers an appealing risk-reward balance to play
the region’s demographic and income growth,” JP Morgan analysts
including by Muneeza Hasan said in e-mailed report today. The
company’s shares trade at a 14 percent discount to global peers,
based on 2013 earnings, they said.  Almarai may next week report a  9 percent  increase in 2012
profit to 1.4 billion riyals ($373 million), according to the
average estimate of 14 analysts on Bloomberg.  “We expect near-to-medium term performance to come from
continued healthy volume growth and a quarter-on-quarter pick up
in poultry business sales and margins,” JPMorgan said.  Four analysts  recommend buy Almarai, while 12 say hold and
two advise to sell, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
shares advanced 12 percent in 2012, outpacing the benchmark
index’s 6 percent gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
