Hog futures fell the most in four
months on speculation that supplies of U.S. pork are outpacing
demand. Cattle prices declined.  Wholesale  pork  slumped 0.5 percent to 83.05 cents a pound
yesterday, the lowest since Jan. 2, U.S. Department of
Agriculture data show. Meatpackers processed 1.288 million hogs
in the first three days of this week, up 1.3 percent from the
same period a year earlier, government data show.  “You have some more pigs coming to the market,”  Christian Mayer , a market adviser at Northstar Commodity Investments Co.
in  Minneapolis , said in a telephone interview. “I don’t think
demand is quite strong enough to make up for that.”  Hog futures for February settlement slumped 2.5 percent to
close at 84.2 cents a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. That marks the biggest drop for a most-active contract
since Sept. 6.  Cattle futures for February delivery slid 0.8 percent to
settle at $1.3155 a pound on the CME. Last week, prices slipped
0.5 percent, the first drop since Nov. 30.  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement retreated 0.8
percent to $1.53775 a pound in Chicago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
