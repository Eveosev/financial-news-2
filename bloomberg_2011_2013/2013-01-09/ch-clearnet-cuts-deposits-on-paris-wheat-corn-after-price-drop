LCH Clearnet SA, the French arm of
 Europe ’s biggest clearinghouse, will lower the deposits it
demands from clients to trade grain and rapeseed futures on NYSE
Liffe in Paris after prices fell.  The margin for milling wheat futures will fall to 1,000
euros ($1,307) per contract from 1,150 euros, LCH.Clearnet wrote
in a  statement  on its website yesterday.  Milling wheat futures have fallen 11 percent in the past
two months in the French capital to 246.75 euros a metric ton,
and yesterday dropped as low as 241.75 euros a ton, the lowest
price for a most-active contract since July.  Margin requirements for corn will drop to 900 euros from
1,000 euros, the clearinghouse said. The deposit for rapeseed
futures will fall to 1,250 euros from 1,400 euros per contract,
while the margin for malting barley remains at 1,250 euros.  The changes will come into effect with the margin call on
the morning of Jan. 11 for positions at tomorrow’s close,
