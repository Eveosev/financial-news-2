Tesco Plc (TSCO) , Britain’s biggest
retailer, will tomorrow announce the promotion of Chris Bush to
the post of U.K. chief executive officer, according to a person
familiar with the matter.  Bush, chief operating officer of Tesco’s domestic business,
will take over the role from CEO Philip Clarke, said the person,
who declined to be identified as the matter is not yet public.  Bush, a 30-year veteran of the Cheshunt, England-based
company, has previously held senior posts at Tesco’s units in
 Thailand ,  Malaysia  and South Korea. He was called back from
Thailand last year to help Clarke with a turnaround at home.  Clarke has run the U.K. business since March, when  Richard Brasher  left in the wake of the failed Big Price Drop campaign
and the first reduction of profit guidance in two decades.  Also tomorrow, Tesco may report the strongest growth in
domestic sales since 2010. Six-week revenue at U.K. stores open
at least a year increased 1 percent, excluding gasoline and
value-added tax, according to the median estimate of 10 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News. That would be only the second
positive performance in eight quarters.  An official representing Tesco declined to comment on the
pending appointment of Bush, which was reported earlier today by
the Financial Times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
