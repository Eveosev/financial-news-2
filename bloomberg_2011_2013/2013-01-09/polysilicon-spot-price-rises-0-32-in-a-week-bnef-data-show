The price of polysilicon, the raw
material used to make most solar panels, rose 0.32 percent last
week.  The average spot price was $15.88 a kilogram, compared with
$15.83 a week earlier, according to a survey by Bloomberg New
Energy Finance. Polysilicon last year fell to its lowest level
in at least a decade amid an oversupply.  To contact the reporter on this story:
