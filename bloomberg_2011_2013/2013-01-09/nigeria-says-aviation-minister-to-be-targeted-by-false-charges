Nigeria ’s Aviation Ministry says
“big players” in the  airline industry  hired a person it didn’t
identify to spread false information about the minister, Stella Oduah.  The plan is being carried out by individuals “in the
aviation sector who have not been comfortable with the sweeping
reforms taking place,” Joe Obi, a spokesman for the minister in
Abuja, said today in an e-mailed statement. The person received
millions of naira and will call a press conference to reveal
documents containing “malicious” information about the
minister, Obi said, citing “reliable sources” he didn’t name.  The goal is to increase opposition to her in the National
Assembly over  Dana Airlines Ltd. ’s resumption of operations, Obi
said. Parliamentary members rejected the government’s decision
to allow Dana Airlines to resume flights before the conclusion
of the investigation into the crash of one of its planes in
June.  The airline resumed operations on Jan. 4, with a flight
carrying celebrities and reporters from the commercial capital,
Lagos, to Abuja.  A Dana Airlines  Boeing Co. (BA)  MD-83 plane from Abuja carrying
146 passengers and seven crew members crashed into buildings on
approach to Lagos on June 3, killing all 153 on board.  To contact the reporter on this story:
