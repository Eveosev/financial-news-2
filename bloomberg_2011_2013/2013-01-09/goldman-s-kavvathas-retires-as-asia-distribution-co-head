Dimitrios Kavvathas, a  Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS)  partner, co-head of Asia Pacific excluding Japan
securities distribution, and head of structuring in the region,
will retire, according to an internal memo seen by Bloomberg.  Separately, James Houghton, also a partner, will become

hedge fund sales desk in London and in 2008 became co-head of
 Europe ,  Middle East  and Africa credit flow sales. He took over
equity derivatives and credit distribution across Asia when he
moved to  Hong Kong  in 2009, according to the memo. He was named
managing director in 2005 and partner in 2008.  Houghton moved to Hong Kong at the end of last year and
became head of Asia Pacific ex-Japan macro sales. He previously
led hedge fund coverage for interest-rate products in the
Americas, according to the second memo. He was named managing
director in 2005 and partner in 2008.  To contact the reporters on this story:
