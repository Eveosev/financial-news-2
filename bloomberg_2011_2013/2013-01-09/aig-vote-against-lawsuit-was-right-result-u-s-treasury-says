American International Group Inc. (AIG) 
made the proper decision to opt against joining the insurer’s
former chief executive officer in a lawsuit against the U.S.
over the company’s 2008 bailout, the Treasury Department said.  The vote by New York-based AIG’s board was the “right
result,” said Timothy Massad, assistant secretary for financial
stability, in an e-mailed statement today. “It is consistent
with AIG’s determination to rebuild the company, repay
taxpayers, and move forward.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
