OAO  Razgulay Group (GRAZ)  rose to its
highest level in five trading sessions after the state
development bank agreed to boost its stake in the Russian grain
and sugar producer.  Razgulay advanced as much as 7.1 percent to 14.40 rubles a
share before settling at 13.94 rubles by the 6:45 p.m. close of
the main trading session in Moscow. That’s the highest close
since Dec. 25. The Moscow Exchange resumed trading yesterday
after halting for the New Year’s break on Dec. 28.  Vnesheconombank converted 1.11 billion rubles ($36 million)
of debt into shares, increasing its holding in Razgulay to 19.97
percent, the agricultural producer said in an e-mailed statement
today. The stock fell 45 percent last year as the company sought
to sell assets and reduce debt.  “VEB’s support signals that Razgulay won’t go bankrupt,”
Mikhail Loshinin, an analyst at Rye Man & Gor Securities in
Moscow, said by phone. The  state bank  holds most of Razgulay’s
25 billion-ruble debt, he said.  The agricultural holding will be able to invest in
strategic areas of the business now that debt servicing has been
reduced, Rustem Mirgalimov, Razgulay’s board chairman, said in
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
