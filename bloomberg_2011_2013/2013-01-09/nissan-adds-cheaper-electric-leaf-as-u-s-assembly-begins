Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , the world’s largest
seller of electric vehicles, said it’s adding a lower-priced
version of the rechargeable Leaf as production of the car begins
in  Tennessee .  For 2013 the company adds an entry level S grade Leaf
that’s cheaper than the SV and SL models sold in the U.S. since
late 2010, Nissan said in a statement today, without providing
prices. All 2013 Leaf models have improved electric range, and
recharge time for SV and SL grades falls to four hours from a
220-volt outlet from about seven hours currently, Nissan said.  “The refinements and enhancements for 2013 hit at the core
of customer requests during Leaf’s first two years,”  Al Castignetti , Nissan’s vice president of U.S. sales, said in the
statement. Those include faster charger time, better range and
optional leather seats and high-end audio systems, he said.  Nissan is trying to boost U.S. sales of the battery-powered
hatchback that have so far fallen short of the company’s
ambitions. Leaf deliveries to U.S. drivers grew 1.5 percent in
2012 to 9,819, less than half of Chief Executive Officer  Carlos Ghosn ’s 20,000-unit target.  U.S.  production  of the car has begun at Nissan’s Smyrna,
Tennessee, plant. The Yokohama, Japan-based company late last
year opened the largest lithium-ion battery plant in Smyrna,
funded with a federal loan from the Obama administration worth
as much as $1.4 billion.  Base prices for the 2012 SV and SL Leafs are $35,200 and
$37,250, respectively, before a $7,500 federal tax credit.
Nissan introduced a new Leaf to the Japanese market late last
year that was priced 11 percent less than the previously
cheapest one.  Range for the 2012 models averages 73 miles (117 km) per
charge, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.  Pricing of the 2013 model Leafs is to be announced later,
said Travis Parman, a company spokesman.  Nissan’s North American operations are based in Franklin,
Tennessee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
