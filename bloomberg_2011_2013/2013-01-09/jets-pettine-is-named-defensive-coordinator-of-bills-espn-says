The Buffalo Bills hired former New
York Jets defensive coordinator Mike Pettine for the same role,
 ESPN reports , without saying where it got the information.  Pettine, 46, agreed to a three-year contract to join the
staff of new Bills coach Doug Marrone, ESPN said.  Pettine spent the past four years with the Jets and his
contract expired after this season, when New York ranked eighth
in the National Football League in yards allowed and 20th in
scoring defense. The Bills allowed the seventh-most points in
the NFL last season in going 6-10, the same record as the Jets
in the American Football Conference’s East division.  Jets coach Rex Ryan had said yesterday that Pettine would
be leaving the organization.  “Mike thinks it’s best that he goes to a different team as
a defensive coordinator and I wish him all the best, unless he
goes to Buffalo,” Ryan joked.  To contact the reporter on this story:
