The  Chicago Board Options Exchange
Volatility Index (VIX)  rose, snapping a six-day streak of losses,
after the gauge of U.S. stock options prices reached the lowest
level since 2007.  The benchmark gauge, known as the VIX, rose 1.8 percent to
13.86 at 12:48 p.m. in New York, after earlier touching 13.22,
the lowest intraday level since June 2007. The index dropped 40
percent over the previous days, the most since November 2008.  “People are just looking at these low levels as
opportunity to buy portfolio protection,” Jonathan Krinsky,
chief technical analyst at Miller Tabak & Co., said in an
interview. “There were also a lot of eyes on it, and often
times when that happens as an instrument breaks support levels,
it reverses.”  The VIX tumbled a record 39 percent last week after U.S.
lawmakers reached a deal to avert more than $600 billion in tax
increases and spending cuts. During the week, the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index climbed 4.6 percent to 1,466.47, the highest
level since December 2007. The  S&P 500 (SPX)  rose 0.3 percent today
and investors’ optimism about fourth-quarter corporate earnings.  Record U.S.  corporate profits  and three rounds of Federal
Reserve monetary stimulus have helped the S&P 500 climb 116
percent since the bull market began in March 2009. The VIX is 83
percent below its all-time high of 80.86 reached in the two
months after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. declared bankruptcy
in 2008.  “We are seeing the combination of unwinding of fiscal
cliff hedges, which in the short term proved unnecessary, and a
new year rally combining to crush volatility,” Alec Levine, an
equity derivatives strategist at Newedge Group SA in New York,
said in an interview.  Analysts predict profits at S&P 500 companies will rise 4.4
percent this year to a record $102.60 a share, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Per-share earnings in the index probably
rose 2.9 percent during the fourth quarter after increasing 4.6
percent in the previous three months, the estimates show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
