Sempra Energy (SRE) , which operates or is
developing solar farms in three states in the U.S. Southwest,
completed a 150-megawatt project in Arizona.  The Mesquite Solar 1 power plant in Arlington, Arizona,
about 40 miles (64 kilometers) west of Phoenix, has a 20-year
contract to sell power to PG&E Corp., San Diego-based Sempra
said today in a statement.  Mesquite Solar 1 uses panels produced by Wuxi, China-based
 Suntech Power Holdings Co. (STP) , and is the first phase of a project
that may eventually be expanded to as much as 700 megawatts,
according to the statement. It currently has enough capacity for
about 56,000 homes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
