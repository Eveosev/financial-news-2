Rubber climbed for a second day,
nearing an eight-month high reached Jan. 7, as speculation grew
that  China , the world’s biggest consumer, will step up purchases
before holidays next month.  Rubber for delivery in June advanced as much as 1 percent
to 308.6 yen a kilogram ($3,528 a metric ton) on the  Tokyo 
Commodity Exchange and was at 306.7 yen at 10:33 a.m., extending
this year’s rally to 1.4 percent.  China boosted natural rubber imports by 15 percent to 3.28
million tons last year, according to Association of Natural
Rubber Producing Countries. Imports are likely to keep rising as
expanding car sales boost demand for tires, said  Kazuhiko Saito ,
an analyst at broker Fujitomi Co. in Tokyo.  “The market is supported by speculation that Chinese
buyers will step up raw-material purchases before the New Year
holiday,” he said by phone today.  Natural-rubber inventories monitored by the Shanghai
Futures Exchange gained 1,770 tons to 97,697 tons last week, the
highest level since March 2010. China’s markets are closed in
the week beginning Feb. 11 for the holiday.  Gains were limited as the dollar’s rally against the
Japanese currency has stalled, weakening the appeal of yen-
denominated contracts, Saito said. The yen traded at 87.21 per
dollar after reaching a 30-month low of 88.41 on Jan. 4.  Rubber for delivery in May lost 0.2 percent to 26,120  yuan 
($4,196) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange. Thai rubber
free-on-board fell 1 percent to 101.35 baht ($3.33) a kilogram
yesterday, according to the Rubber Research Institute of
 Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
