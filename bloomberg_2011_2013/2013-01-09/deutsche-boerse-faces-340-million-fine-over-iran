Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1)  said U.S.
regulators may fine its Clearstream settlement unit as much as
$340 million over possible violations of sanctions against  Iran .  Clearstream has started talks on a deal with the U.S.
Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control related
to securities transfers within its settlement system in 2008,
the Frankfurt-based exchange said in a statement today.  Deutsche
Boerse  shares rose 0.2 percent to 47.03 euros at the close of
trading in  Frankfurt .  Standard Chartered Plc agreed to pay $327 million in fines
last month, including $132 million to OFAC, after regulators
said it violated U.S. sanctions with Iran. Britain’s second-
largest bank by market value was accused of helping Iran launder
about $250 billion in violation of federal laws, keeping false
records and handling wire transfers for Iranian clients.  “Clearstream continues to believe that its actions were in
compliance with any applicable U.S. sanctions regulations and
considers OFAC’s preliminary figure to be unwarranted and
excessive,” Deutsche Boerse said in the statement.
“Clearstream appreciates the opportunity to engage in
substantive discussions with OFAC on the facts and reasons why a
penalty should not be imposed or, if a settlement payment is
agreed upon, why it should be in a far lesser amount.”  John Sullivan , a spokesman for OFAC at the Treasury
Department, declined to comment on Clearstream’s announcement.
OFAC doesn’t comment on open investigations, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
