Natural gas futures dropped to a 15-
week low in  New York  on speculation that unusually mild weather
next week will curtail demand for the heating fuel.  Gas fell 3.3 percent as forecasts from companies including
MDA Weather Services in Gaithersburg,  Maryland , turned warmer
for the eastern and central U.S. through Jan. 18. Gas has
dropped 21 percent from a one-year high on Nov. 23 as stockpiles
hovered near seasonal records.  “We are going to have incredibly unseasonably warm temps
here in the next week,” said Brad Florer, a trader at Kottke
Associates LLC in Louisville,  Kentucky . “You couple that with
the fact that we have high storage to begin with, it puts gas in
a very bearish place.”  Natural gas for February delivery fell 10.5 cents to $3.113
per million British thermal units on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the lowest settlement price since Sept. 26. Trading
volume was 329,359 contracts as of 2:41 p.m., up 12 percent from
the 100-day average.  The futures climbed to $3.933 on Nov. 23 before plummeting
to $3.05 on Jan. 2, the lowest intraday price since Sept. 26.
The futures are up 3.4 percent from a year ago.  The low temperature in  New York City  on Jan. 15 may be 42
degrees Fahrenheit (6 Celsius), 15 above normal, with the high
of the day reaching 50 degrees, 12 above normal, according to
AccuWeather Inc. in  State College ,  Pennsylvania .  Chicago ’s low
on Jan. 14 will be 10 above the usual reading at 28 degrees.  Mild Winter  About 50 percent of U.S. households use gas for heating,
according to the Energy Department. Last winter was the fourth-
warmest on record, which cut consumption during the  peak-demand
season  for the fuel.  “We see prices ultimately testing $2.20 and even last
year’s sub-$2, if the weather continues to moderate,”  Mike Fitzpatrick , editor of the Energy OverView newsletter in New
York, wrote today. “Like last year, we will be in a situation
where we will be coming out of the peak-demand season with ample
storage. The bearish sentiment will become overwhelming.”  February $3 puts were the most active gas options in
electronic trading. They were 2.4 cents higher at 5 cents per
million Btu on volume of 2,969 contracts as of 2:57 p.m.
February $2.90 puts, the second most active, doubled to 2.4
cents on volume of 1,026 lots. Puts accounted for 60 percent of
options volume.  The  discount  of the February contract to April futures,
reflecting cold and warm weather months, widened by 1.2 cents to
a record 6.9 cents.  Relative Strength  The relative strength index fell to 35.5 as of 2:35 p.m.,
the lowest level since April. A number below 30 is considered by
some traders to be a signal to buy contracts while a number
above 70 may be a sell signal.  The RSI may indicate a brief “bear market correction” but
prices will probably decline heading into early February, said
Brian LaRose, a technical analyst at United-ICAP, a brokerage
firm in  Jersey City ,  New Jersey .  Gas typically drops 42 percent from late November to the
first week of February, based on data going back to 1990, he
said. The seasonal trend means futures may bottom out at about
$2.28 per million Btu at the start of next month, LaRose said.  U.S.  gas stockpiles  totaled 3.517 trillion cubic feet in
the week ended Dec. 28, 12.4 percent  above  the five-year average
for the period, according to the Energy Department, which is
scheduled to release its weekly supply report tomorrow.  Weekly Report  Inventories probably fell by 190 billion cubic feet last
week, based on the median of 17  analyst estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg. The five-year average decline for the week is 121
billion, according to  Martin King , an analyst at FirstEnergy
Capital Corp. in Calgary.  Supplies may rise to an all-time high of 4.02 trillion
cubic feet in October, setting a record for a fifth straight
year as production climbs, the department said in its monthly
 Short-Term Energy Outlook , released yesterday.  Marketed gas production will average 69.84 billion cubic
feet a day in 2013, up 0.4 percent from 69.59 billion estimated
in December, the department said in the outlook. Supplies will
increase 0.9 percent from last year’s record of 69.19 billion.  U.S. gas output will climb to a record for the sixth
straight year led by gains at shale reserves. Drilling
technologies such as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, and
horizontal wells, which can bisect more pockets of gas than
vertical wells, have made it more economical to extract the fuel
from rock formations such as the Marcellus in the Northeast.  The boom in natural gas and oil production helped the U.S.
meet 83 percent of its energy needs in the first nine months of
2012, on course to be the highest annual rate since 1991, Energy
Department data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
