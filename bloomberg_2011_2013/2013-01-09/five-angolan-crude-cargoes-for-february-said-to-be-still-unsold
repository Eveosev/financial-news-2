Five Angolan crude cargoes, or about
10 percent, for loading in February remain available, about
normal for this time of the month, according to three traders
who participate in the market.  Unsold grades for export next month include two shipments
of Pazflor, and one each of Dalia, Hungo and Saturno, said the
people, who declined to be identified because the information is
confidential. All lots are for 950,000 barrels.  Two months ago, one cargo was left unsold, two traders
involved in the region’s oil said Nov. 9. Three months ago,
seven consignments were still available by Oct. 9.  Angola plans to export 50 cargoes totaling 1.7 million
barrels a day of crude in February, compared with 59 shipments
for December, according to a revised shipping schedule obtained
by  Bloomberg News . Two Saturno lots were added to the original
plan. The export program for March is scheduled to be released
next week.  Benchmark Cabinda grade was today 49 cents a barrel more
than Dated Brent, the North Sea benchmark used to price more
than half of the world’s oil, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s near the four-month high of 55 cents premium
on Jan. 2.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
