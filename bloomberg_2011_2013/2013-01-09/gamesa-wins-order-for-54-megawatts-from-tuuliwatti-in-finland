Gamesa Corp. Tecnologica SA,  Spain ’s
largest wind turbine maker, said it won a 54-megawatt order from
 Finland ’s TuuliWatti Oy, expanding its presence in a market it
entered last year.  The order for 12 of Gamesa’s G128 4.5-megawatt machines
forms part of a 117-megawatt framework agreement signed in
October, the Zamudio-based company said today in an e-mailed
statement. The machines are specially designed to operate in low
temperatures, it said.  “Finland is considered one of the most promising growth
markets in the European wind energy business in coming years,”
Gamesa said in the statement.  Finland is targeting 2,500 megawatts of installed wind
capacity in 2020, up from about 200 megawatts now, according to
Gamesa. Gamesa on Oct. 25 said it’s concentrating on new
markets, especially in  Latin America , as it adjusts to a global
market this year that it forecasts will include a 12 percent
drop in installations.  All except one of the turbines announced in today’s deal
will be installed this year, with the last in 2014, Gamesa said.
The order follows an 18-megawatt deal with the same client on
Oct. 11 that isn’t included in the 117-megawatt framework
agreement.  The deal includes a 10-year operation and maintenance
contract, with an option to extend it by five years, according
to the statement. TuuliWatti is a venture between Finland’s St1
Oy and S-Group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
