 Coffee growers in  Brazil , the
world’s largest producer, may approach last year’s record output
even as trees enter the lower-yielding half of a two-year cycle,
the  Agriculture Ministry  said.  Producers will harvest between 47 million and 50.2 million
bags, compared with 50.8 million last year, ministerial crop-
forecasting agency Conab said today by e-mail in its first
estimate for this year. Growers harvested 43.5 million bags in
2011, the previous lower-yielding year.  Investments in soil treatment and crop renewal in past
years, coupled with adequate rainfall, will help keep output
near record levels, Jose Milton Dallari, a director at the Rio
de Janeiro-based National Agricultural Society, said in a
interview this week. The outlook for a bumper crop growers will
start reaping in April may push coffee to as low as $1.4 a pound
on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York  in coming months, down from
$1.474 yesterday, he said.  Producers of the mild-tasting arabica variety may harvest
as much as 37.5 million bags this year, down from 38.3 million
bags last year, Conab said. Output of the robusta variety, used
to make instant coffee, may rise to as much as 12.7 million
bags, from 12.5 million.  A bag of coffee weighs 60 kilos (132 pounds).  To contact the reporter on this story:
