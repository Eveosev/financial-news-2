Dallas Mavericks owner  Mark Cuban  was
fined $50,000 by the  National Basketball Association  for making
critical comments about officials on his Twitter page.  Cuban, 54, has been fined more than $1.5 million by the
league for criticizing NBA officiating during his 13 years as
the Mavericks’ owner.  Cuban was disciplined for venting frustration on Twitter
following the Mavericks’ 99-96 overtime loss to the New Orleans
Hornets on Jan. 5. He apologized to NBA fans and wrote that he’s
tried for 13 years to “fix the officiating in this league and I
have failed miserably. Any Suggestions? I need help.”  The Mavericks have lost three straight games and have a
13-22 record this season, in fourth place in the Western
Conference’s five-team Southwest Division.  To contact the reporter on this story:
