Crude produced in the Gulf of Mexico
weakened ahead of the expansion of the  Seaway pipeline , which
will increase the supply of competing crudes on the Gulf Coast.  Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD)  and  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  plan to
resume service on the 500-mile (805-kilometer) Seaway line at
the 400,000-barrel-a-day rate late this week,  Rick Rainey , a
Houston-based spokesman, said in an e-mail Jan. 3.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI narrowed by 65 cents
to $17.20 a barrel at 3:51 p.m.  New York  time, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet also lost 55 cents
to trade at $17.30 above WTI.  Sour Gulf crude grades also weakened. Mars Blend fell 15
cents to a $13.25 premium, while Southern Green Canyon dropped
25 cents to $13.50 above WTI. Thunder House slipped 50 cents to
a $15.65 premium.  Canadian crude grades also weakened. Western Canada Select,
a heavy crude grade mainly produced from oil-sands bitumen, fell
65 cents to a $37.15 discount, according to Net Energy Inc., a
Calgary oil broker. Syncrude, a synthetic crude  produced from
bitumen, lost a 50-cent premium to trade at parity with WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
