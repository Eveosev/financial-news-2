Swansea City defeated Chelsea 2-0 to
open their two-match semifinal in English soccer’s League Cup.  Miguel Michu and Danny Graham had the goals at  Stamford 
Bridge in west  London . Michu scored in the 39th minute after
Chelsea’s Branislav Ivanovic gave the ball away. Graham clinched
the victory in second-half injury time after picking up an
errant backpass by Ivanovic.  The return game will be played Jan. 23 at the Liberty
Stadium in Wales. Bradford, which plays in England’s fourth
tier, beat Aston Villa 3-1 to open the other semifinal last
night.  The League Cup final will be played Feb. 24 at Wembley
