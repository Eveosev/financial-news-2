Canadian  housing starts  fell a fourth
straight month in December on multiple-unit projects, bringing
the rate to the slowest in a year, government figures showed.  The annual pace of work fell 1.7 percent to 198,000 units
on an annual basis from November’s revised 201,400 figure,
Canada Mortgage & Housing Corp. said in a statement today from
Ottawa. Economists forecast a December reading of 195,000
according to the median of 22 responses to a Bloomberg News
survey.  Multiple-unit starts in urban areas fell 4.7 percent to
111,500 units, while singles increased 8.6 percent to 67,400
units in December, according to the report.  Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  and the country’s banking
regulator tightened lending rules last year as consumer debts
reached record levels amid signs of overbuilding in cities such
as Vancouver and Toronto. Housing has been boosted by  low
mortgage rates , and the country’s central bank has signaled it
may raise  interest rates  as the economy approaches full output.  “The homebuilding sector, once an engine of growth for the
Canadian economy, is on a clear softening trend,” said
Emanuella Enenajor, an economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce in Toronto.  CMHC said it will present its final estimate of 2012 starts
later his month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
