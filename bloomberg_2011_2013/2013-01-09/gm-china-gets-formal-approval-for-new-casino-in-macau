MGM China Holdings Ltd. (2282) , a venture
between a daughter of casino mogul  Stanley Ho  and MGM Resorts
International, received formal government approval to build its
second resort in Macau. The stock surged.  The venture will pay a land premium of 1.29 billion patacas
($162 million) and annual rent of 2.15 million patacas to
develop a five-star hotel and a casino resort, the government’s
 gazette  said today.  The new project will give MGM China its first resort in
Macau’s Cotai area, Asia’s equivalent of the Las Vegas Strip.
The company joins other operators including  Galaxy Entertainment
Group Ltd. (27)  and  Sands China Ltd. (1928)  in expanding in the gambling
hub, the only place in China where casinos are legal.  The lease will last for 25 years, the gazette said. MGM
China made initial payments to the  Macau  government for the
project, the company said in a statement to Hong Kong’s stock
exchange in October. The formal approval allows the company to
proceed with construction plans on the 71,833 square meter site.  New Resorts  MGM China, partly owned by Stanley Ho’s daughter Pansy,
jumped 7 percent to HK$15.86 in Hong Kong for its highest close
since August 2011. The benchmark  Hang Seng Index  rose 0.5
percent.  “The formal approval means everything is set for MGM China
to move ahead,” said Gabriel Chan, a Hong Kong-based analyst at
Credit Suisse Group.   The casino resort, which will include 1,600 hotel rooms,
500 gaming tables and 2,500 slots, will take as long as 36
months to build, according to a statement from MGM today. It
will cost about $2.5 billion.  Galaxy, controlled by  Hong Kong  business tycoon Lui Che- woo, has said it plans to invest as much as $6.5 billion to
expand the third phase of its existing resort in Cotai. The
company expects to begin construction, which will cover about
929,000 square meters, at the end of this year or early next
year.  Gaming revenue in Macau jumped 14 percent to a record 304
billion patacas last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
