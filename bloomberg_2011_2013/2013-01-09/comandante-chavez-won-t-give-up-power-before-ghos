In 2011, the president of Venezuela's  Supreme Court , Luisa Estella Morales,
declared that Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez 's "direction, inspiration, and
conception of the Republic is what constitutionally inspires ... our
activities." So her  announcement  that Chavez's no-show for his own inauguration
doesn't violate the country's  constitution  should come as less of a shock than
some of her earlier pronouncements, like her wacky  claim  last year  that "space
law ... will be one of the main priorities of Venezuela's judicial branch." Venezuelans might have been better off if their Supreme Court had focused on
matters extraterrestrial, because as  Human Rights Watch  has  documented , the
court's recent interventions on Earth have mostly entrenched Chavez in power and
diminished their rights of redress. So desperate was the court for a legal rationale for not requiring Chavez to
turn over power that it actually  cited  the dreaded Yanquis -- in this case, the
delayed 1853 swearing-in of U.S. Vice President William R. King, who was in Cuba
for tuberculosis treatment -- as a precedent. The court, however, would have a hard time finessing demands for new
elections if Chavez dies, as seems very highly probable, during the first four
years of his new term. In that case, the constitution requires elections to be
held within 30 days. That doesn't preclude the possibility for constitutional
hanky-panky, of course. The best insurance against that possibility is for
Venezuela's neighbors, beginning with Brazil, to insist the country abide by its
constitution. Time is running out, Comandante! (James Gibney is a member of the Bloomberg View editorial board.  Follow  him
