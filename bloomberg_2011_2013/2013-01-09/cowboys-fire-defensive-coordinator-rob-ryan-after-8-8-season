The  Dallas Cowboys  fired defensive
coordinator Rob Ryan after finishing the season with the 19th-
ranked defense in the  National Football League .  “The decision has been made to move forward in a different
direction philosophically on defense,” coach  Jason Garrett  said
in a  statement  on the team’s website last night.  Ryan’s exit came a day after Dallas fired running backs
coach Skip Peete. The team missed out on the playoffs with a
28-18 loss to the Washington Redskins on the final day of the
regular season.  The Cowboys went 8-8 in each of Ryan’s two seasons in
Dallas. The Oakland Raiders never had a winning record in five
seasons with Ryan as defensive coordinator, while the Browns
finished 5-11 in both of his seasons in the same role in
Cleveland. Ryan, the brother of  New York  Jets coach  Rex Ryan ,
had a year left on his contract with the Cowboys.  Rob Ryan was on vacation in Turks & Caicos, about 650 miles
(1,000 kilometers) southeast of Florida, when he was told of his
dismissal in a phone call with Garrett, the Dallas Morning News
reported.  “It didn’t last long,” Ryan told the newspaper. “I have
no hard feelings, but it doesn’t matter if I coach here or not.
I’ll find another spot. I’m too damn good.”  The Dallas defense ranked 17th in the 32-team NFL against
the run this season and 21st against the pass.  To contact the reporter on this story:
