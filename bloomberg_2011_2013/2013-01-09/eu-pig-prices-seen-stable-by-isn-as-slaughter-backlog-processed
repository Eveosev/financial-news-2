Pig prices in the European Union were
stable this week as a slaughtering backlog resulting from the
year-end holidays was processed, said industry group
Interessengemeinschaft der Schweinehalter Deutschlands e.V.  Hog prices in  Germany , the European Unionâ€™s biggest
producer, were unchanged at 1.626 euros ($2.13) a kilogram (2.2
pounds), Damme, Germany-based ISN wrote in a  report  on its
website yesterday.  Pork accounts for about half of the meat consumption in the
EU, and per-capita consumption of pork in the 27-nation bloc is
set to fall to 40.3 kilograms this year from 41.2 kilograms in
2012, based on an EU forecast in September.  Spanish, Dutch, Danish and Belgian pig prices were also
unchanged, while in  France  the price of a kilogram of pork
climbed a 10th of a cent to 1.604 euros, ISN said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
