HRT Participacoes em Petroleo SA , a
Brazilian oil and gas exploration and production company, rose
after tests confirmed gas potential in a field in the Amazon
region.  Shares gained 1.2 percent to 5.12 reais at the close of
trading in  Sao Paulo . The benchmark Bovespa index added 0.7
percent.  Tests in two wells at the Solimoes Basin, in the Amazon
forest in northern  Brazil , prove the existence of gas and create
good prospects for new wells in the field, Rio de Janeiro-based
HRT said today in a regulatory filing. The stock tumbled 58
percent last year as the company drilled a dry hole in the
basin.  “The tests reinforce the positive expectations around the
exploration of the Solimoes basin, which holds HRT’s most
important assets,” Roberto Altenhofen, an analyst at Sao Paulo-
based consulting firm Empiricus Research, said by phone. “It’s
where the company is concentrating all efforts to find not only
gas but oil as well.”  The company set a six-month timeline beginning in January
for jointly developing gas fields in the Solimoes Basin along
with the state-controlled Brazilian oil company  Petroleo
Brasileiro SA (PBR)  and TNK-BP Ltd. During that period, they will do
an evaluation of the resources to be extracted and conduct
engineering, environmental and logistics studies on how to bring
gas to market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
