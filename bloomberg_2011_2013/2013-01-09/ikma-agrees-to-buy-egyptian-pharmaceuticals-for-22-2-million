Hikma Pharmaceuticals Plc (HIK)  agreed to
buy Egyptian Company for Pharmaceuticals & Chemical Industries
for about $22.2 million in cash to strengthen its position in
the Egyptian market.  The acquisition of EPCI will add a portfolio of 35 products
in 46 dosages and strengths, including three cephalosporin anti-
infection brands for the local market, Hikma said today in a
statement. The London-based drugmaker expects to complete the
purchase before Feb. 14.  “Since we entered the Egyptian market in 2007, we have
been rapidly growing our presence,” Hikma Chief Executive
Officer Said Darwazah said in the statement. “This acquisition
will further accelerate that growth.”  Egypt ’s drug market is one of the largest and fastest
growing markets in the  Middle East  and North Africa, Hikma said,
citing IMS Health. The private retail market is valued at about
$2.3 billion and grew by 11 percent in the 12 months to June
2012, according to the statement.  “The acquisition improves Hikma’s long-term prospects in
the region, and should further boost investor confidence that
Hikma can deliver on its acquisition strategy,” analysts James
Vane-Tempest and Peter Welford of Jefferies International Ltd.
in London said today in a note to investors.  Hikma shares rose 1.2 percent to close at 779.50 pence in
London.  HC Securities & Investment, based in Cairo, acted as
adviser to Hikma on the deal. Matthew Cole, a spokesman for
Hikma, said he didn’t have information identifying the investors
in the acquired company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
