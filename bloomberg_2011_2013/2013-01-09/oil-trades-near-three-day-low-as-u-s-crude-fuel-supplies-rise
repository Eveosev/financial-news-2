Oil rose to its highest level in
almost three months in  London  amid signs of growth in  China , the
world’s second-largest fuel consumer, and as  Saudi Arabia , the
biggest crude exporter, reduced supplies.  Brent futures advanced as much as 1.4 percent to the
highest since Oct. 18 after China’s customs agency reported
overseas sales jumped 14 percent in December from a year
earlier, exceeding the 5 percent median forecast in a Bloomberg
survey. The nation imported 271 million metric tons of crude
last year, 6.8 percent more than in 2011, according to the
Beijing-based General Administration of Customs. Saudi Arabia
reduced its crude production in December to a 19-month low, said
a Gulf official with knowledge of the kingdom’s energy policy.  “The Chinese data is allaying concerns of a hard
landing,” said  Christopher Bellew , a senior broker at Jefferies
Bache Ltd. in London, who predicts  Brent crude  may advance to
$115 a barrel this month. “Saudi Arabia will need to rein in
output this year after making up for outages in 2012, and the
latest numbers suggest they’re doing this.”  Brent for February settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures  Europe  exchange rose as much as $1.53 to $113.29 a
barrel. It was at $112.54 as of 1:29 p.m. local time. The
European benchmark was at a premium of $18.41 to the U.S.
benchmark, West Texas Intermediate, down from $18.66 yesterday.  WTI Crude for February delivery advanced as much as $1.60
to $94.70 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange, the highest since Sept. 19. Prices lost 7.1
percent in 2012 after three years of gains.  Saudi Cut  Saudi Arabia cut production by 4.9 percent to 9.025 million
barrels a day in December, according to a Gulf official who
asked not to be identified because the information is
confidential. The cut of 465,000 barrels a day is the largest
monthly drop since November 2008. Societe Generale SA and the
Centre for Global Energy Studies have said the kingdom needs to
trim output to prevent markets from being oversupplied.  A rebound in China’s trade may give policy makers more time
to shift the economy toward domestic consumption to sustain
expansion. Growth cooled to an estimated 13-year low in 2012 as
Europe’s debt crisis crimped demand for Chinese goods.  “This is positive for commodities including oil demand,”
said Jeremy Friesen, a commodity strategist at Societe Generale
SA in  Hong Kong . “We continue to see outperformance for China
through the first quarter as this cyclical recovery continues,
but improved external demand would add to this bullishness.”  China’s crude imports increased at a faster rate last year
than in 2011, while its daily net purchases in December were the
fourth-highest in 2012.  Low Temperatures  Low temperatures in  Frankfurt  are forecast to drop to minus
9 degrees Celsius (16 Fahrenheit) on Jan. 16, from 4 degrees
today, according to CustomWeather Inc. data on Bloomberg.
 Germany  is Europe’s largest heating oil market.  Gasoil for February delivery rose $14.25, or 1.5 percent,
to $963 a ton on the ICE exchange. It was as high as $965.50,
the highest for the contract since Oct. 19.  Oil fell yesterday after the Energy Department report
showed U.S. crude inventories rose  1.3 million barrels  last
week. U.S. gasoline stockpiles climbed for a seventh week to 233
million barrels, the highest since February 2011. Distillate
supplies increased 6.8 million barrels, the most since May 1997,
versus a forecast gain of 1.9 million.  Crude stockpiles at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point
for the WTI contract, were up for a fifth week to a record 50
million barrels, according to the Energy Department’s data.  “Inventories have been elevated for some time,” said
 David Lennox , an analyst at Fat Prophets in Sydney. “There
might be a modest recovery in demand in the U.S. China will put
further pressure on the demand side this year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
