Brainsway Ltd. (BRIN) , a maker of medical
devices for brain disorders, advanced the most in more than
eight months after the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration 
approved its device for treating depression.  Shares of the Jerusalem-based company surged 16 percent,
the most since April, to 38.45 shekels as of the close of
trading in  Tel Aviv , giving the company a market value of 481.6
million shekels ($127 million). Trading volume was more than 16
times the three-month daily average.  The company, which has European regulatory approval for the
use of its flagship Deep TMS system to alleviate depression,
bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, received approval for
marketing its system in the U.S. for the treatment of depression
patients who failed to recover following drug treatment,
Brainsway said in a  filing  with the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. The
potential market in the U.S. is worth “tens of billions of
dollars,” the company said.  Brainsway is examining its marketing and distribution
options for the device in the U.S. and worldwide, including
potential partnerships with leading companies in the field, it
said. Other potential applications for the treatment range from
cocaine addiction to obesity and  Alzheimer’s disease , according
to Brainsway.  Brainsway uses a coil device, placed on the patient’s head,
to produce directed electromagnetic fields that can induce
excitation or inhibition of neurons deep inside the brain,
according to the company’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
