The euro may advance versus the yen
to the strongest level in almost 21 months even as it approaches
a key level of resistance, according to Credit Suisse Group AG,
which cited technical indicators.  The shared currency, which is in an upward corrective
period after falling to a 12-year low in July, has “gained
traction” at 113.50 yen and should test 116.02, Cilline Bain, a
London-based technical analyst at Credit Suisse, wrote today in
a client note. A move past that resistance level may result in
appreciation to 121.94, which would be the euro’s highest level
versus the yen since April 2011, Bain said.  “The market continues a long-term uptrend from July
lows,” Bain said in a telephone interview. “The next leg
higher in this uptrend should bring us back up to around 116.”  The 17-nation currency increased 0.6 percent to 114.58 yen
at 10:26 a.m. in  New York , after falling as much as 0.3 percent.
The euro reached 115.99 on Jan. 2, its highest level since July
2011.  A break below 113.50 may result in a move lower to 111.45,
according to Bain. If the euro sees sustained depreciation below
that support level, it could experience a “deeper correction”
to 105.98, its lowest level since Dec. 10. Credit Suisse bank
has a year-end forecast of 100 yen per euro, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “We would need a sustained move or weekly close below
111.45 for a decent correction back down to support at 105.98,”
Bain said.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index. Resistance refers to an
area on a chart where sell orders may be clustered. Support is
an area where there may be buy orders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
