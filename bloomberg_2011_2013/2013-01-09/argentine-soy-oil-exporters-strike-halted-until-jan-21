The Argentine Labor Ministry
suspended a strike initiated yesterday that was halting soybean-
oil shipments from the world’s largest exporter by calling the
parties to a mandatory negotiation period.  The strike, by a union that represents 15,000 workers from
the oil-seed processing industry, affected Cargill Inc.’s Villa
Gobernador Galvez terminal this morning, Guillermo Wade, an
official at the Rosario port, said in a phone interview.  The union, which is calling for a 26 percent salary
increase and rejected a 16 percent offer, is accepting the Labor
Ministry order and resuming normal activities, Wade said. The
mandatory conciliation period will expire on Jan. 21, when the
union will again be able to strike.  To contact the reporter on this story:
