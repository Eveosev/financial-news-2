Vietnam ’s State Securities Commission
may increase the foreign-ownership cap on some companies as part
of a package of measures to boost the nation’s equity markets.  The regulator will start a pilot program allowing overseas
investors to own more than 49 percent of companies in some
sectors, according to a document released by the commission at a
briefing in Hanoi today. The benchmark VN Index jumped 2 percent
at 10:16 a.m. in Ho Chi Minh City, making it the best performer
in Asia today. The gauge is heading for an 11th daily gain, the
longest winning streak since the 13 days through Sept. 13, 2011.  The commission also plans to widen trading bands on the
country’s two stock exchanges “soon,” according to the
document, which didn’t give further details. The limit on daily
share-price gains or losses may be increased this month to 7
percent from 5 percent on the Ho Chi Minh City stock exchange
and to 10 percent from 7 percent on the Hanoi Stock Exchange,
Thoi Bao Kinh Te Saigon reported on its website today, citing an
unidentified official at the regulator.  The authority may also raise the margin-financing ratio
limit to 50 percent, according to the document. The commission
will also form a credit rating agency, and introduce pension
fund and bond-related products to boost trading, it said.  The  VN Index (VNINDEX)  has jumped 11 percent this year, the world’s
best performer.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
