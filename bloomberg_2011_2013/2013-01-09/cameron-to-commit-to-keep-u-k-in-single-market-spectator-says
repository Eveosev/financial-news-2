Prime Minister  David Cameron  will
commit to keeping Britain in the European Union’s single market,
rejecting calls by lawmakers in his  Conservative Party  for a
Swiss-style free-trade agreement, the  Spectator magazine  said.  The Tory-supporting weekly reported that Cameron will make
the case in a speech on the U.K.’s relationship with  Europe , due
this month, for expanding the single market and may suggest
giving EU lawmakers in Brussels more authority to enforce its
rules.  “So what does he want in exchange?” the author of the
Spectator article, James Forsyth, wrote in an article to be
published tomorrow. “His speech will not set out a shopping
list; he feels it makes no sense to show his hand too soon. But
most things outside the single market and foreign-policy co-
operation are up for consideration.”  Regional spending by the 27-nation bloc and its working-
time directive are areas in which Cameron will seek to
repatriate powers, Forsyth wrote, citing unnamed people in whom
Cameron had confided. The pledge to renegotiate would be
included in the Tories’ 2015 election program, Forsyth wrote,
and if Cameron won a parliamentary majority, the process would
start soon after.  To contact the reporters on this story:
