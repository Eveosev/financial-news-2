Romania’s economy shrank in the third
quarter less than preliminary reports on a smaller decline in
consumption.  Gross domestic product  shrank a seasonally adjusted 0.4
percent from the previous three months, less than a 0.5 percent
quarterly contraction from reports on Dec. 6 and Nov. 15, the
 National Statistics Institute  in Bucharest said in an e-mail
today. That compares with 0.1 percent growth in the second
quarter. Third-quarter GDP declined a seasonally unadjusted 0.5
percent from the same period a year earlier.  Romania’s economy went through its worst recession on
record from 2008 to 2010 and a second one in the last quarter of
2011 through the first quarter of last year. It will probably
see growth slow to less than 1 percent in 2012 from about 2.5
percent in 2011, because of a poor harvest and slower
industrial-output growth amid  Europe ’s debt crisis, according to
forecasts from the International Monetary Fund.  Final consumption contracted 0.7 percent in the third
quarter from a year earlier, less than a 1.6 percent decline
previously reported, according to the statement.  Construction output shrank 1 percent, while agriculture,
one of the main drivers of the economy in 2011, declined 30
percent in the third quarter. Industry fell 0.5 percent,
according to the institute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
