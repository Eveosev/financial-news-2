Apollo Group Inc. (APOL) , owner of the
University of Phoenix, fell the most in two months in  New York 
trading after new enrollment declined for a third straight
quarter and two analysts cut their ratings.  Apollo, based in Phoenix, tumbled as much as 12 percent to
$18.52, the most since Nov. 7. At 9:57 a.m., the stock was down
11 percent to $18.67. The company, the biggest U.S. for-profit
college, had lost 63 percent of its value in the past 12 months
before today, while an  index  of 13 for-profit colleges fell 48
percent.  Morgan Stanley and First Analysis Corp. downgraded the
shares to equalweight, the equivalent of a hold rating, from
overweight.  Apollo reported yesterday that total enrollment dropped 14
percent while the number of new students signing up for classes
fell 15 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
