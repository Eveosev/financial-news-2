Thailand ’s government bonds and the
baht rose as the central bank held borrowing costs at the lowest
level since 2011 to support the economy.  The Bank of Thailand left its one-day bond repurchase rate
at 2.75 percent today, a move predicted by all 22 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Global investors bought $1.1 billion more
of the nation’s sovereign debt than they sold this month through
yesterday, Thai Bond Market Association data show.  “Risk appetite has been improving globally,” said  Yuji
Kameoka , chief currency strategist at Daiwa Securities Co. in
 Tokyo . “But we are not yet in a situation to expect a trend of
rising interest rates and that remains supportive for bonds.”  The yield on the 3.625 percent notes due June 2023 fell two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.68 percent as of
3:35 p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The rate reached 3.70 percent yesterday, the highest level since
Sept. 25.  The baht advanced 0.2 percent to 30.38 per dollar,
strengthening for a third day and approaching a 10-month high of
30.29 reached on Jan. 3 , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected
moves in exchange rates used to price options, dropped 13 basis
points to 4.07 percent.  The central bank will monitor capital flows, it said today
after the rate decision. Foreign funds pumped a net $145 million
into Thai stocks in the first two days of this week, taking
inflows this year to $273 million, exchange data show.  “The BoT’s focus in the near-term will be on the potential
impact of volatile capital flows,” said Wee-Khoon Chong, a
strategist at Societe Generale SA in Hong Kong. “In other
words, more focus will be on the foreign exchange than on
interest rates. Intervention to slow the baht’s gains is
possible in the future.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
