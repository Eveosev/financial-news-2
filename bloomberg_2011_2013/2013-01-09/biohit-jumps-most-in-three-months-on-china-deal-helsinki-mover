Biohit Oyj (BIOBV) , the Finnish maker of
tools to diagnose and prevent gastrointestinal diseases, gained
the most in three months in Helsinki trading after adding a
distributor for its cancer-prevention product.  Biohit shares rose as much as 17 percent to 5.19 euros, the
biggest jump since Oct. 8. They were up 14 percent at 12:43 p.m.
in the Finnish capital. That was the  biggest increase  on the
Nasdaq OMX Helsinki all-share index with trading volume almost
five times the three-month average.  Biohit signed a distribution agreement with Grand
Pharmaceutical Co., a Chinese company, adding its third deal for
Acetium in a month. In December Biohit completed agreements with
Canadaâ€™s Xediton Pharmaceuticals and ProGalenika, which will
dispense the treatment in  Mexico , Argentina, Brazil,  Colombia 
and  Venezuela .  Acetium helps patients suffering from insufficient levels
of stomach acid to prevent stomach and esophageal cancers.  The
substance  is patented in the U.S. and Europe as a way to bind
carcinogenic acetaldehyde, which is naturally occurring and
present in food. Acetium is the only product proven to reduce
exposure to acetaldehyde, according to Helsinki-based Biohit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
