Britain’s  trade deficit  was little
changed in November as exports rose, led by chemicals and
intermediate goods.  The goods trade gap was at 9.16 billion pounds ($14.7
billion) compared with 9.49 billion pounds in October, the
 Office for National Statistics  said today in  London . The median
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of 20 economists was 9
billion pounds. Exports increased 2.9 percent to 24.8 billion
pounds, the highest since July. Imports rose 1.1 percent.  U.K. business confidence improved in the fourth quarter and
gauges of export orders increased, according to a British
Chambers of Commerce report yesterday. Still, the recovery this
year is likely to be modest, it said. Bank of England policy
makers will keep their  bond-purchase program  unchanged this week
as they gauge signs of economic improvement, economists said
before a decision tomorrow.  “Recent surveys suggest export orders have improved a bit
in the last couple of months,”  Vicky Redwood , an economist at
Capital Economics Ltd. in London, said before the report was
released. “But with the euro-zone recession deepening a
significant improvement in the trade balance is unlikely.
Ultimately  Europe  takes half of our exports so that’s the really
important factor.”  Exports of chemicals rose by 446 million pounds in
November, and overseas sales of intermediate goods increased by
130 million pounds, the ONS said.  The pound remained higher against the dollar after the
report was released. It was at $1.6070 as of 9:32 a.m. in
London, up from $1.6056 yesterday.  EU Trade  Today’s report also showed that exports to the European
Union increased 8.9 percent in November from October, while
imports rose 4.3 percent. The deficit with the 27-nation bloc
narrowed to 4.65 billion pounds from 4.99 billion pounds.  The services  trade balance  was at 5.7 billion pounds in
November, compared with 5.76 billion pounds the previous month.
That left the total trade deficit at 3.47 billion pounds.  In the three months through November, the goods-trade gap
was little changed at 27.1 billion pounds from the previous
three-month period. Exports fell 1.2 percent.  The statistics office said that in the 11 months through
November the goods-trade deficit has been running at an average
8.9 billion pounds a month. The gap in the same period of 2011
averaged 8.4 billion pounds.  In a separate report, the ONS said non-financial companies’
net rate of return was 12.2 percent in the third quarter,
compared with 12.1 percent in the three months through June.  The  Bank of England ’s Monetary Policy Committee will keep
its bond-purchase program at 375 billion pounds tomorrow, said
all 39 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. It will also leave
the benchmark  interest rate  at a record-low 0.5 percent,
according to a separate poll.  To contact the reporter on this story:
