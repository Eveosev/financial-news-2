Georgia  will release 190 political
prisoners starting Jan. 12 and seek measures to allow the return
of 25 political exiles, Justice Minister Tea Tsulukiani told
reporters in Tbilisi today.  Lawmakers on Dec. 28 overrode a presidential veto of the
legislation which allows the 215 to seek retrial after being
jailed under the previous administration, led by the party of
U.S. ally President Mikheil Saakashvili. The bill also
authorizes the release of about 3,000 prisoners, as well as a
reduction of prison terms for thousands of other inmates.  Georgian billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili’s opposition
coalition won Oct. 1 parliamentary elections, defeating
Saakashvili’s  United National (UNBK)  Movement and ending its nine-year
rule. Ivanishvili’s coalition promised to restore justice, to
raise  living standards  and improve relations with Russia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
