A Francis Bacon triptych self-
portrait is estimated to sell for as much as $24 million at a
sale in  London  next month.  It will be the first big test of the auction market for
contemporary art after a record week in  New York  in November.  Sotheby’s (BID)  56-lot auction on Feb. 12 carries a minimum
valuation of 63 million pounds ($101 million), based on hammer
prices, the highest figure for one of the company’s February
London contemporary sales since the previous art market boom of
2008, the New York-based company said today in an e-mail.  Wealthy individuals, concerned about continuing instability
in the wider economy, are increasingly turning to contemporary
art as an alternative investment, dealers said. Recent auctions
of contemporary art have been dominated by high prices for
classic works by gold-standard names such as Bacon,  Andy Warhol ,
 Gerhard Richter  and  Jean-Michel Basquiat .  Bacon’s “Three Studies for a Self-Portrait” dates from
1980 and is one of 11 such smaller-scale triptychs. Painted when
the artist was 71 years of age, it has been entered by a
European collector. Its formal top valuation is 15 million
pounds. The current auction high for this type of triple self-
portrait is the 17.3 million pounds paid for a 1975 version at
Christie’s International in 2008.  Richter was the biggest-selling living artist at auction in
2012, according to the Artnet database in New York, racking up
$298.9 million of sales, a 48.8 percent increase on 2011.  Record Year  Encouraged by this record year for the German artist,
sellers are offering at Sotheby’s “Abstraktes Bild (769-1)”
from 1992 and the 1976 photorealist painting, “Wolke (Cloud).”
These contrasting Richters carry low estimates of 7.5 million
pounds and 7 million pounds respectively.  Basquiat’s acrylic, oilstick and collage painting
“Untitled (Pecho/Oreja)” had been owned by the Irish rock band
U2 until July 2008, when it was sold for 5.1 million pounds at
Sotheby’s, London.  The painting, dating from 1982-1983, will be reoffered in
February with an estimate of 7 million pounds to 9 million
pounds.  Two 1965 monochrome “cut” paintings by the Italian
postwar conceptual artist  Lucio Fontana  -- another investors’
favorite -- provide the sale’s other big-ticket highlights.  The large white single-cut “Concetto Spaziale, Attesa,”
is estimated at 2.2 million pounds to 2.8 million pounds, while
the smaller blood-red “Concetto Spaziale, Attese,” with four
cuts, is priced at 800,000 pounds to 1.2 million pounds.  None of these higher-value paintings has been guaranteed a
minimum price, Sotheby’s said. The equivalent auction last
February raised 50.7 million pounds with fees from 63 offered
lots.  In November in New York, evening and day sales at
Sotheby’s, Christie’s and Phillips de Pury & Co. raised a record
$1.1 billion, more than double the $448.5 million achieved at
the previous week’s Impressionist auctions.  (Scott Reyburn writes about the art market for Muse, the
