  KKR & Co. (KKR) , the private-equity firm
run by  Henry Kravis  and  George Roberts , will more than double
its stake in a unit of Vietnam’s  Masan Group Corp. (MSN)  to $359
million, its biggest investment in Southeast Asia.  The U.S. firm will invest an additional $200 million in
Masan Consumer Corp., a Vietnamese fish sauce maker, the largest
private-equity deal in the country, according to a joint
statement today. KKR bought a 10 percent stake for $159 million
in April 2011, its first acquisition in Vietnam.  KKR, which has $66 billion in assets, is betting Vietnam’s
young population and growing middle class will help it generate
returns. The New York-based firm’s consumer and retail
investments in Asia include Oriental Brewery Co. in South Korea,
 China Modern Dairy Holdings Ltd. (1117)  and India’s Cafe Coffee Day.  “Doubling our investment in less than two years
demonstrates our strong conviction in Vietnam’s growth story,”
said Lu Ming, KKR’s regional head for Southeast Asia, said in
the statement. KKR said it will buy new and secondary shares of
Masan Consumer, without revealing the size of the additional
stake.  TPG Inc. and BankInvest, a Danish investment fund, bought a
$50 million stake in Masan Group in October 2009. Mount Kellett
Capital Management LP, a U.S. private equity group, said in
January 2011 it spent $100 million for a 20 percent stake in
Masan Resources, a unit of Masan Group that owns a tungsten mine
in the country.  KKR, which set up its first office in Asia in 2005, employs
almost 100 people in the region. It opened its seventh Asian
office in Singapore in October as its headquarters for Southeast
Asia. The firm is also raising a $6 billion Asian fund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
