New Zealand ’s dollar gained to the
highest in more than four years versus the yen as optimism U.S.
corporate earnings will extend a third year of growth boosted
global stocks.  The so-called kiwi remained higher against the  U.S. dollar 
following an advance yesterday. The Australian currency’s
advance was tempered after a government report showed the
nation’s retail sales unexpectedly fell.  “It’s more just an improvement in risk sentiment in
general than something very specific to kiwi,” Sireen Harajli,
a foreign-exchange strategist in  New York  at Credit Agricole SA,
said in a telephone interview. “It tends to be a favorite
currency right now.”  New Zealand’s currency reached 73.94 yen, the highest since
Sept. 22, 2008, before trading at 73.85, up 0.1 percent from the
close yesterday in New York. It was at 83.95 U.S. cents
following a 0.4 percent advance to 83.96. The Aussie dollar
added 0.1 percent to 92.45 yen and was little changed at
$1.0509.  The MSCI World Index of shares gained 0.4 percent
yesterday, while the  Standard & Poor’s 500 (SPX)  Index advanced 0.3
percent in New York. Fourth-quarter profit at companies in the
 S&P 500  probably increased 2.9 percent, according to analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg, extending a three-year
expansion while marking the second-slowest quarterly growth
since 2009.  Australian retail sales declined 0.1 percent in November
from a month earlier, the Bureau of Statistics said yesterday.
Economists in a Bloomberg survey had forecast a 0.3 percent
increase.  To contact the reporters on this story:
