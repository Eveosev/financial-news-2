Centamin Plc (CEY) , a miner of gold in
Egypt, rose the most in more than three weeks in London trading
after producing more of the metal than it previously forecast.  Centamin advanced as much as 10 percent, the steepest
intraday gain since Dec. 17. Full-year gold output rose 30
percent to 262,958 ounces, beating its guidance of 250,000
ounces, the company said today in a statement. Centamin has been
hurt by delays in Egypt since last year’s uprising that led to
the ousting of former national President  Hosni Mubarak .  It’s “an impressive end to the year,” Numis Securities
Ltd. said in a note. Still, “the cloud of political and
corporate issues are likely to continue to dog the stock.”  Centamin fell 52 percent last year and 53 percent in 2011.  The company, operating  Egypt ’s Sukari mine, halted mining
three times last year on labor disputes and supply problems.  The stock dropped as much as 59 percent on Oct. 30 after
Egypt’s administrative court issued a preliminary ruling to
annul its 18-year-old concession agreement with the government.  Joint venture partner, the state-owned Egyptian Mineral
Resources Authority, said it would appeal the decision.  “The team at Sukari has delivered a very strong set of
operating results, with a record output for the quarter,”
Chairman Josef El-Raghy said in the company’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
