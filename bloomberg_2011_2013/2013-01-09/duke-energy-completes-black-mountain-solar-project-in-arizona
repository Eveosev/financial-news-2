Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) , the largest U.S.
utility owner by market value, completed a 10-megawatt solar
farm in northwest Arizona.  The Black Mountain Solar Power Project near Kingman, about
85 miles (135 kilometers) southeast of Las Vegas, sells
electricity to UNS Energy Corp. under a 20-year agreement,
Charlotte, North Carolina-based Duke said today in a statement.
It went into operation last month.  Duke acquired the project from Solon Corp. in May. It has
enough capacity to power about 1,900 homes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
