Seattle Seahawks kicker Steven Hauschka will miss the rest of the National Football League
playoffs with a leg injury and has been replaced on the roster
by  Ryan Longwell .  Hauschka, 27, was placed on injured reserve today after
straining a left calf muscle in Seattle’s 24-14 opening-round
playoff victory over the Washington Redskins, the team said
today on its website. The 38-year-old Longwell will kick against
the  Atlanta Falcons  on Jan. 13 in the National Football
Conference semifinals.  Hauschka strained the calf in his non-kicking leg during
the second quarter last weekend. He remained in the game and
kicked field goals of 22 and 29 yards following the injury,
while punter Jon Ryan handled the kickoffs.  Longwell, one of four kickers who auditioned yesterday for
the Seahawks, hasn’t played since 2011 as a member of the
Minnesota Vikings. The 15-year veteran has kicked in eight
postseasons, two with the Vikings and six with the  Green Bay
Packers .  The Seahawks also placed defensive end Chris Clemons on
injured reserve, according to their website. Clemons, who had 11
1/2 sacks this season, tore the anterior cruciate ligament in
his left knee in the team’s win over Washington.  To contact the reporter on this story:
