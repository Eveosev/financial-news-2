Treasury 10-year yields are poised to
rise after breaking a 2012 downtrend, judging by trading
patterns, according to DZ Bank AG.  Andy Cossor, the Hong Kong-based chief market strategist
for  Asia  at Germany’s fourth-largest lender, drew a descending
trend line connecting the highs in yields set in March and
December. Extrapolating the line into 2013, it came to 1.82
percent on Jan. 2. Yields climbed through the level that day and
have been above it since.  “We busted through that and sustained the break,” Cossor
said. “It’s pointing to yields going higher.”  Benchmark 10-year  rates  were little changed today at 1.87
percent as of 1:51 p.m. in  Tokyo , based on Bloomberg Bond Trader
prices. The 1.625 percent note maturing in November 2022 changed
hands at 97 25/32.  Ten-year yields will climb to 2.15 percent by year-end,
according to a Bloomberg survey of banks and securities
companies, with the most recent projections given the heaviest
weightings.  The U.S. plans to sell $21 billion of 10-year notes today.
It sold $32 billion of three-year debt yesterday and is
scheduled to auction $13 billion of 30-year bonds tomorrow.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
