Peru’s sol fell to the lowest level
in a week as local lenders boosted dollar holdings to comply
with higher  reserve requirements  that the central bank
established to cool credit growth.  The sol declined 0.1 percent to 2.5505 per  U.S. dollar  at
the close of trading in  Lima .  The monetary authority increased the reserve ratio for sol
and greenback deposits effective Jan. 1 to slow dollar lending
and tame a rally in the local currency. The sol has gained 1.3
percent in the past three months, the best performance among its
six most-traded peers in  Latin America  after Colombia’s peso,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The sol’s appreciation has been “interrupted in the short
term” as banks increase the amount of dollars held at the
central bank, said Juan Carlos Odar, an economist at Banco de
Credito del  Peru  in Lima.  Loans denominated in U.S. currency increased 16.6 percent
to $28.3 billion in November, the fastest pace in eight months,
and accounted for 43.4 percent of all outstanding loans to
companies and households, the central bank said in a Dec. 28
 report . Sol loans grew 16.6 percent, the slowest since May.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 3.85 percent, according to prices compiled
by Bloomberg. The price rose 0.3 centimo to 125.89 centimos per
sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
