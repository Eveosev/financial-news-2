Lightsource Renewable Energy Ltd., a
London-based developer, gained a 54.4 million-pound ($87
million) loan from  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  and NIBC
Bank NV to refinance six U.K. solar parks.  RBS’s Corporate & Institutional Banking unit supplied 37.4
million pounds and NIBC of the Netherlands provided the
remainder, Lightsource said today in a  website statement .  The parks in the southeast and west of England cost “north
of 70 million pounds” in total, Paul McCartie, finance director
at Lightsource, said today by phone. Lightsource is backed by
London-based fund manager Octopus Investments Ltd.  The parks, with a total capacity of 23 megawatts, have been
working since before August 2011, when the so-called feed-in
tariffs for large-scale solar projects were cut by as much as 71
percent, according to Lightsource. The loan refinances a current
bridge loan provided by funds managed by Octopus. The debt is
non-recourse, where the lender can recoup payments from the
ventures’ profits, according to McCartie.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
