“Zero Dark Thirty,” Kathryn Bigelow’s controversial film about the hunt for  Osama Bin Laden , expands to about 2,500 theaters this weekend, part of  Sony Corp. (6758) ’s plan to exploit buzz from tomorrow’s Oscar nominations.  The film, an Academy Award contender now in just 60 theaters, has been denounced by three U.S. senators for its depiction of torture, notoriety that’s generated publicity for the movie. Sony limited showings of “Zero Dark Thirty” while critical praise and headlines in Washington stoked demand.  “It’s now a must-see movie,” said Tom O’Neil, editor of GoldDerby.com, which provides odds on award races. “This is one of the most dramatic events in recent history and, of course, it would be controversial. Otherwise the filmmakers aren’t doing their jobs.”  The strategy may bring in as much as $135 million in domestic ticket sales for a movie that cost $20 million to make, according to Exhibitor Relations Co., an industry researcher. Three years ago another Oscar hopeful, “ Slumdog Millionaire ,” more than doubled its theater count a day after the nominations and went on to triple its U.S. sales. Sony is going further with a 40-fold jump in locations.  The film features Jessica Chastain as a CIA operative whose unflagging determination led to Bin Laden’s death in a May 2, 2011, raid on his compound in Pakistan by U.S. Navy seals. The movie was produced by Annapurna Pictures, the Los Angeles-based company founded by Megan Ellison, daughter of  Oracle Corp. (ORCL)  Chief Executive  Larry Ellison .  The story addresses similar themes as the Showtime series “Homeland.”  Claire Danes , the central character in that pay-TV program, is also a female CIA operative who becomes personally invested in tracking down terrorists.  Release Strategy  The nationwide release of “Zero Dark Thirty,” between the Oscar nominations and the Golden Globes telecast on Jan. 13, was part of Sony’s marketing strategy, said Rory Bruer, president of worldwide marketing and distribution.  “We felt like we had a film that was an edge-of-your-seat thriller,” Bruer said in an interview.  “Slumdog Millionaire” went on to collect $141.3 million in U.S. sales as the News Corp. film won eight Academy Awards, including best picture and best director for  Danny Boyle . It collected $378 million worldwide, according to Box Office Mojo.  “Zero Dark Thirty” faces competition on the awards circuit from  Steven Spielberg ’s “Lincoln,”  Ben Affleck ’s “Argo,” about the Iranian hostage crisis, and the musical “ Les Miserables .”  Ranked Third  GoldDerby.com ranks “Zero Dark Thirty” third in the Oscar race, tied with “Les Miserables” and behind “Lincoln” at No. 1 and “Argo.” Scores are based on forecasts by journalists, the website’s editors and readers. Oscar nominations will be announced at 8:30 a.m. tomorrow by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences during an ABC telecast from Beverly Hills,  California .  “Zero Dark Thirty” was nominated for four Golden Globe awards, including best drama, best director, best screenplay and best supporting actress in a drama for Chastain.  Critics have praised the film for its realistic look at the clandestine world of intelligence gathering. Of 112 reviews compiled by the movie website Rottentomatoes.com, 105 were positive, or 94 percent.  “Lincoln” leads the Globe nominations with seven, including best picture-drama and best director for Spielberg. “Argo,” directed by and featuring Affleck, received five nominations, including best drama and best director. The Globe awards will be telecast by NBC at 8 p.m. on Jan. 13.  Sony opened “Zero Dark Thirty” on Dec. 19 in five theaters in New York and Los Angeles, qualifying for the 2012 awards and avoiding box-office competition with other holiday releases. As of Jan. 7, it had $4.6 million in sales from U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Box Office Mojo.  Senate Criticism  “Certainly we looked at the other films,” Bruer said. “The release pattern is unique to this particular film. We thought it would be appropriate and so far, so good.”  Democratic U.S. senators  Dianne Feinstein  of California and  Carl Levin  of  Michigan , along with Republican  John McCain  of  Arizona  have objected to the movie’s suggestion that harsh interrogation of captured al-Qaeda members provided key information about Bin Laden’s whereabouts.  Members of Congress, including New York Republican  Peter King , have also questioned whether Bigelow and writer  Mark Boal  were given access to classified material.  The film opens with scenes of an al-Qaeda member being waterboarded, deprived of sleep and forced to spend long periods curled in a small box before revealing the name of a Bin Laden courier.  CIA Comment  Acting CIA Director Michael J. Morell in a message to the agency’s employees said that some, though not all, of the critical information came from detainees subjected to “enhanced” methods, the New York Times reported on Dec. 22.  A debate over the movie’s accuracy and the harsh treatment of prisoners will probably generate more interest in the film, said Phil Contrino, editor of BoxOffice.com, a website that tracks movie performance.  “It just helps it, creates audience curiosity,” he said. “The senators speaking out about it are bringing more attention to it.
