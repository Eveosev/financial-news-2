Lanxess AG (LXS) , the synthetic-rubber
maker that joined  Germany ’s benchmark DAX index in September,
had its longest losing streak for three months after analysts at
 Citigroup Inc. (C)  and Main First Bank AG cut their investment
recommendations.  The supplier of compounds to tiremaker Michelin & Cie.
dropped as much as 3.6 percent, bringing the stock’s five-day
decline to 9.4 percent. A slowdown in the  auto industry  prompted
Citi’s Dominik Frauendienst, Andrew Benson and Evgenia Molotova
to lower earnings forecasts for this year and next, and re-
ranked Lanxess to sell from hold.  Chief Executive Officer Axel Heitmann predicted a bumpy
start to this year, Frankfurt Allgemiene Zeitung reported in
December. Lanxess has already said that profit growth in 2012
was at the lower end of its targeted range. Weaker demand for
standard rubber left capacity idle, denting third-quarter
earnings, with Heitmann predicting the automotive industry would
remain weak in the final three months of 2012.  Main First analysts Ronald Koehler and Thomas Swoboda on
Jan. 7 cut Lanxess’ rating to underperform from neutral, citing
a weak start to the year in the auto trade.  The stock was down 2.3 percent at 61.81 euros as of 10:03
a.m. local time. Lanxess has gained 16 percent in six months,
boosting its market value to 5.14 billion euros ($6.72 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
