ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel, in his first
night in a new 11:35 p.m. time slot, attracted more viewers than
CBS’s  David Letterman  and NBC’s Jay Leno  “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” drew a 2.8 rating, exceeding the 2.4
rating for “The Tonight Show with Jay Leno” and the 2.7 rating
for the “Late Show with David Letterman,” according to
preliminary Nielsen data provided by the TV networks.  With Kimmel’s move, ABC is seeking to close an advertising
gap with  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s NBC and the  CBS Corp. (CBS)  network.
Entertainment shows are more popular with marketers and draw a
broader mix of advertisers than news programs, according to
Peter Gardiner, chief media officer at Deutsch Inc., an
advertising company in New York.  “Nightline,” the ABC newscast pushed back to 12:35 a.m.
due to Kimmel’s move, averaged more viewers than CBS’s “Late
Late Show with Craig Ferguson” and NBC’s “Late Night with
Jimmy Fallon,” according to the early ratings. The news program
drew a 1.8 rating compared with 1.2 for Fallon and Ferguson.
Each rating point equals 1 percent of the 114.2 million U.S. TV
households.  Actress  Jennifer Aniston  and the band No Doubt appeared on
Kimmel’s show last night.  ABC parent  Walt Disney Co. (DIS)  rose 1.1 percent to $51.31 at
12:53 p.m. in New York. The stock climbed 33 percent in 2012,
outpacing the 7.3 percent gain in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average, which includes the Burbank, California-based media
company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
