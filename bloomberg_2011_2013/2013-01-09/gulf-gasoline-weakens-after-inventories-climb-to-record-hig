Gasoline on the U.S. Gulf Coast
weakened for the first time in three days after the Energy
Department said regional supplies of the motor fuel climbed to a
record last week.  Gasoline inventories in the area, known as PADD 3, rose 1.4
percent to 81.4 million barrels in the week ended Jan. 4, the
Energy Department said today. That’s the highest level since at
least 1990, when the agency began collecting the data.
Production of the fuel dropped 6.1 percent to 1.93 million
barrels a day.  The discount for  reformulated gasoline  to be blended with
ethanol on the Gulf Coast widened 6 cents to 11.75 cents a
gallon versus futures on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange at
2:17 p.m. East Coast time, the lowest level in almost two weeks,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. Conventional, 87-octane
gasoline weakened 3.5 cents to 14.25 cents below futures.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  in the region was unchanged at a
discount of 2.25 cents against Nymex heating oil futures.  Distillate fuel oil inventories on the Gulf Coast climbed
4.6 percent last week to 37.1 million barrels. Supplies are at
the lowest level for this time of year since 2008.  Motiva Enterprises LLC expects to take at least a week to
repair a recurring leak on the 325,000-barrel-a-day crude unit
at the Port Arthur refinery in  Texas , a person familiar with
operations said yesterday.  Motiva, a joint venture of Saudi Arabian Oil Co. and  Royal
Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  subsidiaries, is “still targeting early 2013”
for the full restart of the crude unit, Kimberly Windon, a
Houston-based spokeswoman for the refinery, said by e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
