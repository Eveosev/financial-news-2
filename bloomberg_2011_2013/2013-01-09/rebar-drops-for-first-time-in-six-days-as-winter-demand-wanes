Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
Shanghai fell for the first time in six days on speculation
demand for winter stockpiling was waning.  Rebar for delivery in May declined as much as 0.9 percent
to 3,976  yuan  ($639) a metric ton on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange today, before trading at 3,997 yuan at 11:04 a.m.
Futures reached 4,047 yuan on Jan. 7, the highest since July 10.  Prices surged 14 percent in December, the most since July
2009, as  China’s economy  headed for a rebound in the final three
months of the year after a seven-quarter slowdown as the
government increased infrastructure spending and accelerated
investment-project approvals.  Iron ore  climbed to the highest in
almost 15 months yesterday.  “All the recent bullish factors have been priced in at
this point, so a retreat and consolidation looks natural as
demand from winter stockpiling draws to an end,” according to a
report by Beijing CIFCO Futures Co.  Spot  iron ore  at Tianjin port gained 3 percent to $158.50 a
dry ton yesterday, the highest since Oct. 13, 2011, data
compiled by The Steel Index Ltd. showed. The average spot  price 
for rebar was unchanged at 3,774 yuan a ton yesterday, the
highest level since Oct. 15, according to data from Beijing
Antaike Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
