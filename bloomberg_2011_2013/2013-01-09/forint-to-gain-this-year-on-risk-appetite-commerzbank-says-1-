The forint, the world’s second-best
performing currency in 2012, will probably gain further this
year against the euro as global risk appetite improves,
according to Commerzbank AG.  Hungary ’s currency appreciated 0.3 percent to 291.02 per
euro by 1:09 p.m. in Budapest. The forint may strengthen to 275
per euro by the end of December, said Carolin Hecht, a
Frankfurt-based strategist at Commerzbank, the second-most
accurate forecaster for Hungary’s currency in the six quarters
through December, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
 Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP) ’s CIB Bank Zrt. unit was the most accurate.  The U.S. economy is poised to recover further this year,
increasing demand for riskier assets even as the Federal Reserve
phases out its so-called quantitative easing measures that
stimulated world markets, Hecht said. The global backdrop will
outweigh a gloomier prognosis for Hungary’s emergence from
recession, she said.  “I think that 2013 will be a moderately good year for the
forint,” Hecht wrote in comments sent by e-mail. “In this
market environment of low risk aversion, the forint has
potential to gain.”  Expectations of further monetary policy easing by Hungary’s
central bank are already priced into the forint’s rate, Hecht
added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
