Russian  inflation  accelerated to 6.6
percent in December from a year earlier, up from 6.5 percent in
November and October, matching a preliminary estimate.  Consumer prices advanced 0.5 percent in the month, the
Federal Statistics Service in Moscow said today in an e-mailed
statement.  Core inflation , which excludes volatile costs such as
energy, slowed to 0.4 percent from 0.5 percent in November,
bringing the full-year increase to 5.7 percent, according to the
statement.  Central bank Chairman Sergey Ignatiev wants to hold
inflation at 5 percent to 6 percent this year, half a percentage
point higher than previously targeted, as he winds up his third
and final term. Inflation slowed to a post-Soviet low of 3.6
percent in April and May after the government pushed back
increases in utility tariffs by six months to July 1.  Price growth in 2011 was 6.1 percent, a post-Soviet record
low for the year-end figure.  To contact the reporters on this story:
