South African vehicle sales expanded
at the slowest pace in three years in 2012 as consumers curbed
spending and economic growth slowed, the National Association of
Automobile Manufacturers of  South Africa  said.  Sales rose 9.2 percent from a year earlier to 623,914
vehicles, the Pretoria-based group said in an e-mailed statement
today. Sales in December rose 1.8 percent from a year earlier to
46,016.  Household spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of
expenditure in the economy, has come under pressure as growth
slowed and unemployment increased. Vehicle sales will probably
remain moderate this year, expanding 7.3 percent, the
association said.  “Following the strong improvement in trading conditions in
the automotive retail market in 2010 and 2011, the recovery
continued throughout 2012 albeit on a more subdued basis,”
according to the statement. “The positive momentum should
continue into 2013 with demand supported by historic low
 interest rates .”  The  Reserve Bank  has kept the  repurchase rate  at 5 percent,
the lowest level in more than 30 years, since a surprise cut in
July. Retail sales rose 1 percent in November, the slowest pace
since February 2010, according to the statistics office. The
economy probably expanded 2.5 percent last year, down from 3.5
percent in 2011, according to the central bank.  Passenger-car sales increased 11 percent to 439,997 last
year, while vehicle exports rose 3.5 percent to 277,844.  To contact the reporter on this story:
