Air Berlin Plc (AB1) ,  Europe ’s third-
biggest discount airline, said the passenger total fell 5.5
percent in 2012 as it cut routes to pare losses, widening the
gap to market leaders  Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA)  and  EasyJet Plc. (EZJ)   The Berlin-based company carried 33.3 million people last
year, down from 35.3 million in 2011, as the number of available
seats was reduced by 7.4 percent, it said today in a statement.  The decline widens the gap to European discount leader
Ryanair, which boosted its passenger total 4 percent to 79.6
million, and EasyJet, the No. 2, which had a gain of 6.7 percent
to 59.2 million. The capacity cut helped lift the  load factor , a
gauge of occupancy, by 1.6 points to 79.8 percent, though that’s
still below Ryanair with 82 percent and EasyJet on 88.9 percent.  Air Berlin this week appointed Wolfgang Prock-Schauer, the
former head of U.K. carrier BMI, to succeed Hartmut Mehdorn as
chief executive officer as it seeks a return to profit following
consecutive annual losses since 2008.  The carrier,  Germany ’s second-biggest after  Deutsche
Lufthansa AG (LHA) , said the December passenger total fell 8.5 percent
as capacity was cut 12 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
