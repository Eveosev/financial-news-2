Great Portland Estates Plc (GPOR) , the
property developer focused on office space in  London ’s West End,
said its real estate appreciated by 3.8 percent the fiscal first
quarter on demand from international investors.  The value of Great Portland’s properties rose by 58.4
million pounds ($94 million) to 1.7 billion pounds in the three
months through June, the London-based company said in a
statement today. Net asset value increased to 376 pence a share
from 362 pence at the end of March.  A weak pound, higher rents from a shortage of new office
space and the perception of London as a haven attracted
investors from overseas. Central London offices accounted for 46
percent of the 6.45 billion pounds of U.K. commercial real
estate deals in the second quarter, according to Stafford,
England-based  Property Data .  “Investor demand for central London commercial property
continued unabated during the quarter and with limited supply,
we expect much of it to remain unsatiated for some time to
come,” Chief Executive Officer Toby Courtauld said in the
statement.  Great Portland shares have risen almost 22 percent this
year, exceeding the 12 percent gain for the FTSE All-Share Real
Estate Investment Trust Index in the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
