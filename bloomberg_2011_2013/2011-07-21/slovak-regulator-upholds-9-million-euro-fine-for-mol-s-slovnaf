Slovakia’s Anti-Monopoly Office
upheld a 9 million euro ($13 million) fine for Mol Nyrt.’s unit
in the country for price discrimination, the regulator said in
an e-mailed statement.  The antitrust regulator rejected an appeal by Mol-
controlled  Slovnaft AS (SLOVN)  against the fine, which was originally
levied in December last year.  The decision took effect yesterday, the regulator said in
an e-mailed statement from Bratislava, Slovakia, today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
