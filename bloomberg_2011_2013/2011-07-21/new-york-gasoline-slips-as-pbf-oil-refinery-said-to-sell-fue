New York  gasoline dropped as PBF
Energy Partners LP was said to sell fuel from its Delaware City
refinery, an indication that the plant was back in operation
after being shut since 2009.  The company has been selling finished product, including
gasoline, from the 182,200-barrel-a-day refinery, according to
two people who declined to be identified because the information
isnâ€™t public.  The discount for conventional gasoline to be blended with
ethanol, or CBOB, in New York Harbor, widened 0.13 cent to 6.13
cents a gallon versus futures traded on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  at 4:14 p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Prompt delivery of the fuel fell 4.87 cents to $3.0383 a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
