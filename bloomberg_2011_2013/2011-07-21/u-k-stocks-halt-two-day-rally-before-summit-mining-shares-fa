U.K. stocks rallied for a third day
amid speculation today’s European Union summit will extend
financial assistance of the region’s weakest economies.  Barclays Plc (BARC) , the U.K.’s second-largest bank, jumped the
most since May 2010 and  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) 
advanced 5.7 percent. Insurers  Aviva Plc (AV/)  and  Legal & General
Group Plc (LGEN)  gained more than 2 percent.  The benchmark  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  rose 46.07, or 0.8 percent, to
5,899.89 at the 4:30 p.m. close in London after earlier falling
as much as 1 percent. The gauge has still lost more than 3
percent since this year’s high on Feb. 8 amid speculation that
Europe’s debt crisis will spread to Italy and Spain. The broader
 FTSE All-Share Index (ASX)  gained 0.7 percent today, while Ireland’s
ISEQ Index rose 0.6 percent.  “The rumors out of  Europe  have allowed markets to continue
in recovery mode as expectations that there is going to be a
concerted effort to resolve the sovereign debt crisis became
more likely,” said  Angus Campbell , head of sales at Capital
Spreads in London.  Euro-area leaders may accept a temporary Greek default and
ease the terms on bailouts to cash-strapped nations as they
intensify efforts to resolve the 21-month sovereign debt crisis,
officials said. A draft document from the meeting showed the
agency is calling to extend the maturity of loans for Greece and
to enhance the attributes of a rescue fund, Reuters reported.  Greek Loans  The draft document calls for an extension of loans for
 Greece  from the European Financial Stability Facility to 15
years from 7 1/2 years and a lowering of lending rates, Reuters
reported. The draft said new loans to Greece from the EFSF may
be offered at a rate of 3.5 percent, according to Reuters. The
EFSF may also be able to intervene in secondary bond markets,
depending upon European Central Bank input, and recapitalize
financial institutions through government loans, Reuters said.  U.K. stocks are beating European equities by the widest
margin in more than two years, luring investors who say the
fastest profit growth in the developed world will prolong the
advantage as the debt crisis worsens.  The FTSE 100 has climbed 5.4 percent since its 2011 low,
bringing its gain since the  bull market  began 28 months ago to
67 percent, or 14 percentage points more than the Euro Stoxx 50
Index, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Analysts estimate
earnings will rise 44 percent over the next 12 months for
companies in the U.K. gauge, the most among the world’s 10
largest economies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Barclays, RBS Gain  Barclays jumped 7.8 percent to 239.85 pence. RBS advanced
5.7 percent to 36.05 pence. Aviva, Britain’s second-biggest
insurer by market value, climbed 4.2 percent to 420 pence and
Legal & General, the fourth-largest, increased 2.5 percent to
117.2 pence.  Kingfisher Plc (KGF)  jumped 5.6 percent to 267.4 pence. Europe’s
largest home-improvement retailer rose the most in four months
as growth in sales at its French business helped offset a
decline in revenue at its U.K. stores.  Capita Group Plc (CPI)  dropped 1.6 percent to 686 pence, making
it the second-worst performer on the FTSE 100, as analysts at
Evolution Securities Ltd. downgraded the company to “neutral”
from “buy.”  Capita today reported a 7 percent increase in first-half
underlying pretax profit to 174 million pounds ($281.5 million).
Analysts at BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research said the results
missed consensus estimates on sales and cash.  To contact the reporter on this story:
