Vodacom Group Ltd. (VOD) , the largest
provider of mobile-phone services to South Africans, said
revenue climbed 8.1 percent in the three months through June 30
as it attracted more customers and added 107 third-generation
base stations.  Vodacom, which is controlled by  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) , added
1.9 million customers across the African countries in which it
operates during the quarter, taking its total customer base to
45.4 million, the company said in a statement. Average revenue
per customer each month declined 4.7 percent to 142 rand
($20.69) because of a 25 percent reduction in the price of
making a call per minute in South Africa, said Vodacom.  The Johannesburg-based company experienced network outages
in June in some parts of  South Africa . Chief Executive Officer
Pieter Uys said the company has installed more fiber capacity
to avoid disruptions in the future.  “Our number one priority over the coming months is to
ensure that our customers get the best possible network
experience,” Uys said in the statement.  Vodacom rose 1.1 percent to 88.8 rand at 9:33 a.m. in
Johannesburg trading.  Revenue increased 5 percent to 11.6 billion rand in 
South Africa, Vodacom’s biggest market, mainly
because of “robust data growth.” Customers in South Africa
increased by 20 percent to 27.7 million.  Revenue from international operations increased 10 percent
to 2.12 billion rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
