The pound weakened versus the euro
for a second day as a report showed U.K. consumer confidence
fell in June and optimism over a deal to provide  Greece  with
rescue funds boosted demand for the European currency.  Sterling was stronger against the dollar for a third day.
An index of sentiment declined 4 points to 51 from May, when it
rose because of a boost from an extra public holiday for the
royal wedding and warm weather,  Nationwide Building Society  said
today.  The pound slipped 0.3 percent to 88.23 pence per euro as of
7:45 a.m. in London. It climbed 0.2 percent to $1.6184 and
dropped 0.6 percent to 10.3464 Swedish krona.  U.K. retail sales rebounded in June, climbing 0.6 percent
from the previous month, when they slid the most since January
2010, according to the median estimate of 22 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News before a report from the  Office for National
Statistics .  To contact the reporter on this story:
