London ’s Metropolitan Police has
been asked to probe whether officers obtained tracking data from
mobile phone companies in order to give it to reporters at News
Corp.’s defunct Sunday tabloid, the News of the World.  Jenny Jones, a member of the Metropolitan Police Authority,
which scrutinizes the work of the London force, asked the police
to review the issue. In an e-mail, she said she planned to ask
Acting Commissioner Tim Godwin about it next week.  “I’ve asked the Met to consider undertaking comprehensive
steps to identify cases where this may have happened in the
past, to root out any officers involved,” said Jones, a member
of the Green party.  Police are investigating phone-hacking at  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s News
of the World. The scandal, sparked by the July 4 revelation that
the paper deleted voice-mail messages of a murdered school girl,
has forced the closure of the 168-year-old Sunday tabloid, the
resignation of two executives and shelved News Corp.’s bid for
full ownership of British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc.  Jones’s request follows a July 11  report  in the New York
Times that said police staff were bribed to use restricted
mobile phone tracking technology to pinpoint the location of
people sought by U.K. newspapers.  A police spokesman said the Met will review the request and
respond to Jones within the normal MPA process.  Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, competes with
News Corp. units in providing financial news and information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
