Djibouti appealed for $21 million
from international donors to help deal with a drought that has
left about 120,000 of the countryâ€™s citizens vulnerable.  Almost all of the dams and wells in the Horn of Africa
nation have run dry, resulting in a scarcity of drinking water
among the rural population, Communication and Culture Minister
Abdi Ahmed Houssein said in a press briefing broadcast on state
television yesterday. Cattle mortality rates have also
increased, Houssein said.  Parts of East Africa are facing the worst drought in 60
years. The United Nations yesterday declared a famine in two
regions of southern Somalia, amid a lack of rain that has
resulted in food prices almost tripling over the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
