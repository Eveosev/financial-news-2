Crude oil advanced in  New York ,
heading for a fourth week of gains, as signs Europe and the U.S.
will contain their debt crises eased speculation that demand for
raw materials may falter.  Futures climbed for a fourth day after euro-area leaders
announced 159 billion euros ($229 billion) in new aid for Greece
late yesterday. Prices also rose amid speculation U.S. President
 Barack Obama  may agree a deal to raise the country’s $14.3
trillion debt ceiling before an Aug. 2 deadline.  “There’s more relief over debt measures so there’s this
feel-good sense to the equity markets and that’s dragging up the
price of oil,” said  Jonathan Barratt , a managing director of
Commodity Broking Services Pty in Sydney, who predicts oil in
New York will average $100 a barrel this year. A resolution in
the U.S. “will add to this optimism, which should push crude
oil through $100 a barrel, even up to $102,” he said.  Crude for September delivery increased as much as 70 cents,
or 0.7 percent, to $99.83 a barrel in electronic trading on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange  and was at $99.77 at 4:07 p.m.
Sydney time. The contract yesterday gained 73 cents to $99.13,
the highest since June 14. Prices are up 2.6 percent this week
and have climbed 26 percent the past year.  Brent oil for September settlement rose 61 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $118.12 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. The European benchmark contract traded at a premium of
$18.37 a barrel to U.S. futures, compared with a record close of
$22.63 on July 14.  Greek Aid  Oil climbed as Asian stocks advanced, with the regional
benchmark index erasing its loss for the year. The MSCI Asia
Pacific Index gained 1.1 percent, heading for its highest close
since May 5.  European leaders empowered their 440 billion-euro rescue
fund to buy debt across stressed nations, helping to erect a
firewall around Spain and  Italy  even as they risked temporary
default to lighten the Greek debt burden.  U.S. President Barack Obama and House Speaker  John Boehner 
have pressed for a broad agreement to boost the U.S. debt limit
while cutting spending by trillions of dollars and overhauling
the  tax code .  IEA Supplies  Crude in New York rose yesterday after the  International
Energy Agency  said it won’t extend a release of oil supplies.  The IEA said that while it’s prepared to “augment” the
sale of 60 million barrels of emergency oil stockpiles first
announced on June 23, this intervention and higher output from
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will for now
“substantially cover” the loss of exports caused by an armed
conflict in  Libya .  The Libyan revolt, which began in February, has reduced the
availability of light, sweet crude, or oil with low density and
sulfur content. The country’s output fell 50,000 barrels, or 25
percent, to 150,000 barrels a day last month, a Bloomberg News
survey showed, the lowest amount in yearly data since 1962. It
pumped 1.59 million barrels in January, before the uprising.  The IEA’s action was the third time the agency has
coordinated the use of emergency stockpiles since it was founded
in 1974. The first was during the 1991 Persian  Gulf War  and the
second in 2005 when  Hurricane Katrina  struck the Gulf of Mexico.  To contact the reporter on this story:
