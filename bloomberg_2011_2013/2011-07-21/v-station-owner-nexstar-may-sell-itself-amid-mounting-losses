Nexstar Broadcasting Group Inc. (NXST) ,
manager of television stations in the south and northeast, said
it’s exploring strategic alternatives, including a possible
sale.  Nexstar, based in Irving,  Texas , hasn’t turned a profit in
at least 12 years, losing almost $100 million in 2002 and $78
million in 2008, when the recession caused a drop in  television
advertising . It had total debt of $627 million on March 31,
according to a company filing.  Nextstar rose 27 percent to its highest level since
November 2007 after the Wall Street Journal, citing people
familiar with the matter, reported yesterday that it may get
more than $1 billion, including debt, in a sale. The shares
gained 1 cent to $9.31 at 4:29 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq
Stock Market trading.  Founded by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Perry Sook
in 1996, Nexstar went public in 2003 and tried unsuccessfully to
sell itself in 2007. In a statement today, the company said
there’s no set timetable for the strategic review and that it
has no plans to disclose developments.  Nexstar has retained Moelis & Co. as its financial adviser
and Kirkland & Ellis LLP as its legal counsel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
