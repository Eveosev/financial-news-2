South African Reserve Bank Governor
Gill Marcus made the following comments on inflation after a
meeting of the bank’s monetary policy committee in  Pretoria 
today.  “The inflation forecast of the bank has shown a slight
near-term deterioration since the previous meeting of the MPC.  “Inflation is now expected to breach marginally
the upper limit of the target range in the final quarter of
2011, and to average 6.3 percent in the first quarter of 2012.  “Thereafter it is expected to remain at the upper end of
the target range for the next two quarters, before declining
somewhat in the final quarter of the year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
