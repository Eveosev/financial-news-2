The Mauritian rupee may gain against
the dollar this week on optimism the debt crisis in Europe, the
island nation’s biggest trading partner, will ease, Absa Capital
said.  The rupee fell 0.2 percent to 28.30 to the dollar as of
3:21 p.m. in  Port Louis , erasing an earlier gain of the same
margin, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It rose for the
two preceding trading sessions.  Leaders from France and  Germany , the two biggest economies
in the monetary area that uses the euro, yesterday agreed on a
common position on trying to avoid a default by  Greece . European
leaders are today holding a summit on the sovereign debt crisis
that has led to bailouts for Greece, Ireland and  Portugal .  “The rupee seems to be tracking euro performance,”
Lourens Harmse, a trader at Absa Capital in Johannesburg. “My
Bias is toward more strength in the coming sessions.” He didn’t
give a specific forecast. The euro gained as much as 0.5 percent
against the dollar today.  “ Europe  remains the principal investment and trade partner
in Mauritius”, Finance Minister Pravind Jugnauth said in a
speech to Swiss investors, a copy of which was received by e-
mail today.  Consolidated exchange rates from the Bank of Mauritius
website show a buying price range of 27.4612 to 27.6264 rupees
