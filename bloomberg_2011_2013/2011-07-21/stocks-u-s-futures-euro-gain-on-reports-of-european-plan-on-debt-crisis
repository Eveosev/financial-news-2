The euro, European stocks and U.S.
index futures rallied, erasing earlier losses, amid reports that
European Union officials have come up with a plan to
recapitalize struggling banks and halt a surge in bond yields.  The euro strengthened 0.5 percent to $1.4284 at 8:44 a.m.
in  New York  after slumping as much as 0.5 percent earlier. The
Stoxx Europe 600 Index increased 0.5 percent and futures on the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 0.6 percent. U.S.
Treasuries fell, while Italian, Spanish and Greek bonds surged.  The euro and equities erased earlier losses as Reuters
reported that a draft EU document called for a Greek “ Marshall
Plan ” that includes an extension of bailout funds to Greece and
the possible purchase of bonds in secondary markets to halt a
surge in yields that has raised borrowing costs for the most-
indebted nations.     Earlier, Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  said
Greece may be unable to avoid default. Any euro-area agreement
on a second aid package for  Greece  might include a selective
default on the nation’s debt, though other options would be
preferable, Juncker said today as officials gather in Brussels
to try to resolve the region’s debt crisis.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
