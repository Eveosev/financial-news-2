United Bank for Africa Plc (UBA) , a
Nigerian lender with operations in 18 countries, gained the most
in two weeks after  Renaissance Capital  said profit at the bank
increased.  The stock rose 4.8 percent to 5.02 naira per share at the
2:30 p.m. end of trading in Lagos, the biggest intraday jump
since July 7.  UBA’s first-half post-tax advanced 67 percent to 8.12
billion naira ($53 million), Renaissance Capital said in a note
to clients yesterday.  “The profit shows the bank is cutting costs, which is of
interest to investors,” Ifeanyi Odunwa, managing director of
Lagos-based Investment Centre Ltd., said by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
