Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) ,
the world’s largest publicly traded copper producer, reported
second-quarter profit that topped analysts’ estimates as metal
prices rose and production costs declined.  Net income climbed to $1.37 billion, or $1.43 a share, from
$649 million, or 70 cents, a year earlier, Phoenix-based
Freeport said today in a statement. The earnings, which included
a $61 million charge on the early payback of debt, beat the
$1.33 average estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Sales increased 50 percent to $5.81 billion from $3.86 billion a
year earlier.  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange averaged $9,163 a metric ton in the quarter, 30 percent
more than a year earlier. The metal reached a record $10,190 in
intraday trading on Feb. 15. Freeport’s so-called consolidated
net cash production costs averaged 93 cents per pound of copper
in the quarter, down from 97 cents a year earlier.  Freeport, which operates mines in the Americas, Africa and
 Asia , reiterated its full-year copper sales forecast of 3.9
billion pounds and its gold sales forecast of 1.6 million
ounces. The company lowered its full-year net cash-cost forecast
to $1.01 a pound from $1.04 previously.  The company is moving to increase U.S. output after
postponing some mine expansion plans amid the global economic
recession in 2008 and 2009.  Freeport reduced its debt to $3.5 billion at June 30, from
$4.7 billion at the end of 2010, after the redemption of $1.1
billion of notes in the quarter.  Freeport dropped 58 cents, or 1 percent, to $55.34 as of
4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
shares have fallen 6.9 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
