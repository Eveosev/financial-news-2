Chubb Corp. (CB) , the insurer of
commercial property and high-end homes, said profit fell 19
percent on increased claims costs from catastrophes including
U.S. storms. The company boosted its forecast for 2011 profit.  Second-quarter net income slipped to $419 million, or $1.42
a share, from $518 million, or $1.59, a year earlier, the
Warren, New Jersey-based company said today in a statement.
Operating profit, which excludes some investment results, was
$1.27 a share, beating the 99-cent average estimate of 20
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Chubb, led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Finnegan, joins Travelers Cos. in reporting worse second-quarter
results on U.S. storm losses. Industrywide, insurers faced $14.7
billion in direct insured losses to property in the second
quarter as tornadoes flattened parts of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and
killed more than 150 people in Joplin, Missouri, according to
ISO, a unit of Verisk Analytics Inc.  “You essentially had in the second quarter a large, almost
Hurricane Katrina-like event, if you added everything up,” Paul Newsome, an analyst at Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP, said in an
interview before Chubb announced earnings. “If the third
quarter ends up with a big  hurricane season , it’s going to be a
really ugly year for profits.” He rates the insurer “hold.”  Chubb advanced 72 cents to $62.56 at 4 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. It has climbed 21 percent in
the past year compared with the 11 percent gain in the 24-
company  KBW Insurance Index. (KIX)   2011 Forecast  The insurer said operating earnings for the year may be
$5.55 to $5.85 a share, an increase from its January forecast of
$5.35 to $5.75, as sales advanced, led by gains outside the U.S.  Premium revenue from property-casualty insurance rose to
$2.91 billion from $2.8 billion, as policy sales for commercial
insurance and home and auto coverage for individuals increased.  “This increase in earnings guidance comes despite an
increase in our catastrophe-loss assumption for the full year,”
Finnegan said in the statement.  Catastrophes cost the insurer $329 million before tax
compared with $193 million a year earlier. Chubb, which gets
about a quarter of its policy sales from outside the U.S., faced
losses earlier this year from flooding and a tropical cyclone in
 Australia  and earthquakes in  Japan  and  New Zealand .  Travelers posted its first loss since 2004 as the insurer
faced $1.67 billion before tax in costs tied to U.S. storms. The
New York-based insurer said today that catastrophes in the
quarter cost the firm more than  Hurricane Katrina .  More than  1,600 tornadoes  have been reported this year,
compared with 1,282 in all of 2010, according to the  National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . The tornado that tore
through Joplin on May 22 was the single deadliest U.S. storm in
at least 60 years. Homes and businesses in Tuscaloosa were
destroyed as tornadoes touched down in six states in the U.S.
