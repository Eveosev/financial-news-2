Nigeria ’s borrowing costs plunged to
the lowest in 10 months in the first bond auction since dropping
requirements for investors to hold government debt for at least
a year.  Africa’s biggest oil producer sold 70 billion naira ($460
million) of bonds due 2014, 2015 and 2018 yesterday, the Abuja-
based Debt Management Office said in a  statement  published today
on its website. Yields on the 4 percent debt due 2015 tumbled to
10.7 percent, from 12.75 percent at the last monthly auction,
the lowest since a sale in September.  Bond yields in the secondary market have been falling after
central bank Governor Lamido Sanusi said on June 23 Nigeria
would lift bondholder restrictions. Sanusi is opening Nigeria’s
debt markets to attract more capital and prevent a weakening of
the West African nation’s currency pushing up inflation and
damaging economic growth, he said in March.  “There is a lot of bullish sentiment in the market,”  Alan Cameron  an economist at CSL Stockbrokers Ltd. in London, said in
a phone interview today. “Yields are coming in partially
because of the rules and partially because of inflation.”  Yields on the 10.5 percent notes due 2014 declined to
10.2499 percent at the auction today, the lowest since the
notes’ March issue, and down from 11.69 percent at last month’s
sale. The DMO sold 25 billion naira of 10.7 percent bonds due
2018, yielding 11.5 percent.  Stronger Naira  The naira has strengthened 3 percent since Sanusi’s
announcement, appreciating to 152.17 per dollar on the  interbank
market  as of 11:31 a.m. in Lagos, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The stronger currency is helping to curb the cost of
imported food and slow inflation to 10.2 percent in June from
12.4 percent in May. The central bank’s target is below 10
percent, with policy makers increasing the benchmark interest
rate three times this year to 8 percent to stem price rises.  Yields may reverse a downward trend as the Central Bank of
Nigeria’s monetary policy committee is expected to increase
rates by 50 basis points to 100 basis points, said Cameron.  “The policy rate is still negative in real terms, they’ve
been pretty clear about the fact that to them, to the CBN, the
policy normalization means getting the policy rate above
inflation,” he said.  Nigeria plans to sell more “longer-tenured” bonds in the
fourth quarter to boost liquidity in the market, Abraham Nwankwo, director general of the Debt Management Office, said by
phone July 17. Nigeria issues sovereign bonds once a month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
