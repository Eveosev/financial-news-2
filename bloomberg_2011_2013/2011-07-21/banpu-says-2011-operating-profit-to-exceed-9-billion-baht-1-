Banpu Pcl (BANPU) ,  Thailand â€™s biggest coal
producer, expects profit from operations to exceed 9 billion
baht ($301 million) this year on a combination of revenue from
an Australian unit and higher coal prices.  Net income will be lower than the 24.7 billion baht
recorded last year because of the absence of extra gains, Chief
Executive Officer Chanin Vongkusolkit told reporters in Bangkok
today. The company booked 15.8 billion baht in gains last year
from the sale of investments in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
