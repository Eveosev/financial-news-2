Pipeline-safety legislation can’t be
brought up for a U.S. House subcommittee vote until September at
the earliest, said Representative Ed Whitfield, chairman of the
panel that will consider the proposal.  “I don’t think we’re going to be able to mark it up
probably until September at least, because we’re running out of
time,” the Kentucky Republican said in an interview in
 Washington  today.  Whitfield’s draft bill would reauthorize pipeline safety
programs through 2014, increase penalties for “major
consequence violations” to $250,000 from $100,000 per
violation, and set new fines if an operator intentionally
prevents inspections. It also would require the Pipeline and
Hazardous Materials Safety Administration to introduce
requirements for remote or automatic shut-off valves in new
transmission lines if it’s “economically, technically, and
operationally feasible.”  Whitfield heads the House Energy and Commerce Committee’s
energy and power subcommittee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
