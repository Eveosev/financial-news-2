U.S.  House Republicans , who hold the
majority in that chamber for the first time in four years, are
reaping the benefits financially, new  Federal Election
Commission  reports show.  The  National Republican Congressional Committee  entered
July with $11 million in the bank, more than the $7.4 million
reported by its House Democratic counterpart. The NRCC raised
$6.7 million last month, compared with $6.2 million for the
 Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee .  From January to June, the DCCC led the Republican committee
in fundraising, $33.7 million to $33.5 million. Republicans won
the majority in the  House of Representatives  in the 2010 midterm
elections after losing control of the chamber in the 2006 vote.  The DCCC began the year $19 million in debt and pared that
figure to $4.7 million at midyear. House Republicans reduced
their debt to $3.5 million from $10.5 million.  The  Democratic National Committee  continued to outpace its
Republican rival, bringing in more than $12 million in June for
a 2011 total of $58 million, according to its FEC report. Of
that total, $7 million was raised jointly with President Barack Obama’s re-election campaign.  The  Republican National Committee  raised $37 million this
year, including $6.8 million in June.  The DNC had $21 million in cash, compared with $7.3 million
for the RNC. The DNC owed $11.8 million, while the RNC’s debt
was $17.5 million.  Wooing Large Donors  Since Reince Priebus took over as RNC chairman in January,
he has been paying down a debt of more than $21 million. Priebus
has been trying to woo back large donors who deserted the party
during the tenure of his predecessor as party chairman,  Michael Steele .  “The RNC will have the resources and the funding it needs
to put a Republican back in the White House,” said Kirsten
Kukowski, a spokeswoman.  The  Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee  had $9.1
million in the bank after raising $4.8 million in June,
spokesman Matt Canter said by e-mail, while the  National
Republican Senatorial Committee  had $3.7 million in cash and
raised $3.8 million in June, according to figures released by
NRSC spokesman  Brian Walsh  in an e-mail.  From January to June, the DSCC raised more than $23 million
and the NRSC raised more than $21 million.  To contact the reporters on this story:
