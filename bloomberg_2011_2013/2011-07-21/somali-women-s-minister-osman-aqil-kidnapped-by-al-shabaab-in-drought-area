Somalia’s newly appointed minister
of women’s development, Asha Osman Aqil, was kidnapped by al-
Shabaab insurgents , said Work, Youth and Sports Minister
Mohamed Muhidin Mursal.  Aqil was seized at Johwar, 90 kilometers northeast of the
capital, Mogadishu, Mursal said in a phone interview today from
the city. The minister was “assisting drought-affected people
in Jowhar on behalf of non-governmental organizations” when she
was captured, Mursal said.  The  United Nations  declared a famine in the Bakool and
Lower Shabelle regions of southern Somalia yesterday following a
prolonged drought.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
