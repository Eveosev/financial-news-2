PT Bank Danamon  Indonesia ,
controlled by Singapore’s Temasek Holdings Pte and Deutsche Bank
AG, said first-half net income rose 3 percent, even as loan
demand increased significantly.  Net income rose to 1.47 trillion rupiah ($172 million) in
the six months ended June 30 from 1.43 trillion rupiah the same
period a year ago, the lender said in an e-mailed statement
today.  Bank Indonesia  expects economy to expand 6.3 percent to 6.8
percent this year, as the central bank kept its benchmark
reference rate near a record low of 6.75 percent for a fifth
month to help to boost loan demand and purchasing power in
 Southeast Asia ’s biggest Economy.  Lending jumped 31 percent to 92.79 trillion rupiah from a
year earlier, above Indonesian commercial banks loan growth as
on June at 23.4 percent.  “Indonesia’s promising economic outlook in 2011 has
enabled us to maintain growth in all of our business segments in
the first semester of the year,” President Director Henry Ho
said in the statement.  Net interest income, or interest earned on loans after
deducting interest paid for deposits, rose 8 percent to 5.24
trillion rupiah in the six months ended June 30, from 4.84
trillion rupiah at the same period last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
