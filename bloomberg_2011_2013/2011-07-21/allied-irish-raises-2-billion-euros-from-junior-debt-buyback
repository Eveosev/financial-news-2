Allied Irish Banks Plc (ALBK) , the nation’s
second-largest lender, said it will raise about 2 billion euros
($2.9 billion) following the completion of a buyback of
subordinated bonds, inflicting losses of as much as 90 percent
on investors.  The Dublin-based lender commented in a statement after a
deadline yesterday for holders of three final tranches of junior
securities to decide on the bank’s offer. The bank said on June
14 that it would raise at least 1.6 billion euros following an
earlier deadline for other bondholders.  Ireland’s government is imposing losses on junior bank
bondholders to lessen the cost of bailing out the country’s
debt-laden financial system.  Allied Irish , once the nation’s
biggest lender, was ordered by the country’s central bank in
March to raise 13.3 billion euros to bolster its reserves
against mounting bad loan losses.  Finance Minister  Michael Noonan  reiterated today that the
burden-sharing with junior bondholders should shave 5 billion
euros off the 24 billion euros Irish banks must raise following
stress tests carried in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
