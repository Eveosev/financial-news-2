Oil dropped from near its highest in
a week in  New York  on signs of a slowdown in Chinese
manufacturing and as the dollar pared losses, undermining the
appeal of commodities.  Oil reversed earlier gains, declining as much as 1.2
percent.  China ’s manufacturing may contract for the first time
in a year as output and new orders drop, preliminary data for a
purchasing managers’ index showed. The dollar recovered against
the euro as European leaders gathered in Brussels to discuss
 Greece ’s debt crisis. Initial jobless claims in the U.S., the
world’s biggest crude user, probably rose by 5,000 to 410,000
last week, economists said before a government report today.  “The broader market is on edge, given slowing growth
momentum this summer, while the situation in the  euro zone  is
unlikely to be resolved soon,” said  Andrey Kryuchenkov , an
analyst at VTB Capital in London.  Crude for September delivery was at $97.54 a barrel in
electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , down 92
cents, at 11:33 a.m. London time. It fell as low as $97.20.
Yesterday, the contract climbed 54 cents to $98.40. Prices have
risen 27 percent in the past year.  Brent oil for September settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange was at $117.15 a barrel, down $1. The
European benchmark contract traded at a premium of $19.61 to
U.S. futures, compared with a record $22.63 reached on July 14.  The euro was at $1.4145 against the dollar, slipping from
$1.4295. A weaker U.S. currency makes dollar-priced assets such
as crude more attractive for protecting against inflation.  U.S. Inventories  Standard Chartered Plc yesterday raised its 2012 price
forecast for  Brent crude  to $120 a barrel from $101, citing
economic growth and continued supply disruptions in Libya. Bank
of America Merrill Lynch forecasts Brent at $114 next year.  U.S. crude inventories fell in the week ended July 15 as
refiners boosted processing to a year-high, the Energy
Department said yesterday. Supplies declined 3.73 million
barrels to 351.7 million, beating a median forecast of a 2
million-barrel drop from analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Stockpiles at Cushing, Oklahoma, the physical-delivery
point for West Texas Intermediate oil, the grade traded in New
York, decreased 977,000 barrels to 36.7 million, the lowest
since Dec. 24, the department said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
