Scheduled natural gas deliveries to
U.S. electricity generators dropped for the first time in five
days as shipments to Texas declined.  A sample of scheduled deliveries to  power plants  in the
U.S. and Canada shows shipments fell 2.6 percent to 22.5 million
dekatherms (21.9 billion cubic feet) from 23.1 million
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Schedules
for 705 of 742 pipelines had been reported as of 2:15 p.m. New
York time.  Scheduled shipments to power generators in Texas dropped
8.8 percent to 2.12 million dekatherms, with reports from 79 of
83 pipelines in the region.  Power plants use about 30 percent of the nationâ€™s gas
supplies, according to the Energy Department.  Wholesale gas for next-day delivery at the  Houston Ship
Channel , supplying industrial users around the channel near
Houston, fell 5.49 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $4.4811 per million
British thermal units on the  Intercontinental Exchange .  Gas at the  Henry Hub  in Erath, Louisiana, the delivery
point for futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
fell 6.41 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $4.5773 per million Btu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
