U.S. Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid  said the U.S. House’s decision to be out of session this
weekend presents “a bad picture” to Americans as an Aug. 2
deadline nears for possible default on federal debt.  “I think it’s just untoward -- that’s the kindest word I
can say -- to have the  House of Representatives  out this
weekend,” Reid, a Nevada Democrat, said on the Senate floor.
“Time is of the essence. We are running out of time.”  Michael Steel , a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner,
an Ohio Republican, responded with an e-mail saying, “The House
has passed the ‘Cut, Cap, and Balance’ plan with bipartisan
support. We’re waiting for the Senate, which is run by  Senator
Reid , to act on it.’’  Steel was referring to the measure passed July 19 that
would slash spending while conditioning a $2.4 trillion increase
in the debt ceiling on passage of a constitutional amendment to
balance the budget and make it more difficult to raise taxes.  That bill, passed 234-190 in the Republican-controlled
House, stands little chance of being endorsed by the Democratic-
controlled Senate, and Obama has said he would veto it were it
to reach his desk.  To contact the reporters on this story:
