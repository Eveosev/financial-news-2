Larsen & Toubro Ltd. (LT) ,  India ’s
biggest builder of power networks and airports, plans to add
engineers in the  Middle East  to secure contracts in Qatar as the
country prepares to host the 2022 soccer World Cup.  The number of workers in the Gulf region will be increased
50 percent to 1,500 in a year, K.V. Rangaswami, a director on
Larsen’s board, said in an interview yesterday. Qatar may seek
bids for 40 to 50 large projects, including construction of
roads and buildings, in the next year, he said.  Chief Financial Officer Y.M. Deosthalee aims to double
overseas orders in three years as Mumbai-based Larsen divides
operations into nine units to improve management focus. The
company plans to tap opportunities emerging from Qatar’s state-
owned Lusail Real Estate Development Co.’s plans to award about
$3 billion of contracts to build a  new city  for the  World Cup .  “Qatar appears to be quite promising for the next 10 years
because of the games,” Rangaswami said by telephone from
Chennai. “They are putting up a lot of facilities.”  Larsen’s power transmission and distribution unit won an
order worth 12.1 billion rupees ($273 million), its single
largest in Qatar, it said in a statement yesterday.  “Larsen has been winning orders from the Gulf despite
competition,” said Dhananjay Mishra, an analyst at Sushil
Finance Consultants Ltd. in Mumbai. “It has also managed to
maintain margins.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
