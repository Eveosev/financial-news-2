England  was 127-2 against India on
the rain-shortened opening day of their first cricket Test at
Lordâ€™s in London.  Play was called about 6:30 p.m. local time after a lengthy
rain stoppage allowed for just 49.2 overs. The start of the
2,000th match in the 134 years of elite Test cricket was also
delayed by wet grounds this morning.  Jonathan Trott is 58 not out and  Kevin Pietersen  has scored
22.  Zaheer Khan  took 2-18 before leaving the field with a leg
injury in the 41st over.  India won the toss and elected to field. Khan trapped
Alastair Cook leg before wicket for 12 in the morning session
and had captain  Andrew Strauss  caught by Ishant Sharma after
lunch to leave England 62-2.  Trott and Pietersen then put up a 65-run stand before bad
light led to early tea just before 4 p.m. Heavy rain forced the
field to be covered and the umpires did an inspection at 6 p.m.,
with a view to restarting 30 minutes later, by another shower
ended the day.  England can overtake India as the top team in the
International Cricket Council rankings if it wins the four-match
series by two Tests or more.  To contact the reporter on this story:
