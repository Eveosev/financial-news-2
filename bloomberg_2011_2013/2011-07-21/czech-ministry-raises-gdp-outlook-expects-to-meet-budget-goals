The Czech Finance Ministry raised
its economic growth forecasts for 2011 and 2012 and expects to
meet the target of narrowing the fiscal deficit in the next two
years.  The ministry expects gross domestic product to rise 2.5
percent both this year and next, the Prague-based ministry said
in a document posted on its website today. The ministry’s
previous forecast was for the economy to expand 1.9 percent this
year and 2.3 percent in 2012.  “Economic growth in 2011 and 2012 should be driven by
foreign trade,” the ministry said. “Growth of household
consumption should be limited by the fiscal consolidation
measures and the government consumption should decline.”  The ministry forecasts Prime Minister Petr Necas’s
government will meet its goal of reducing the public finance
deficit, the fiscal yardstick for assessing a European Union
member’s readiness to adopt the euro, to 4.2 percent of economic
output this year from 4.7 percent in 2010. The deficit will
narrow to 3.5 percent of GDP in 2012, in line with the
government’s agenda, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
