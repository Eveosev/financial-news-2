Jake Westbrook allowed two runs over
eight innings and  Albert Pujols  hit a two-run home run to lead
the  St. Louis Cardinals  past the New York Mets 6-2 today.  The game at New York’s Citi Field took 2 hours, 7 minutes,
the fastest of the year for the Mets.  Westbrook allowed four hits for his eighth win of the Major
League Baseball season. Pujols, a three-time National League
Most Valuable Player who was hitless in his first 10 at-bats of
the series, hit his 21st home run of the year in the first
inning off of starter Jonathon Niese.  The Mets scored in the fourth and eighth innings, with
Justin Turner and Jason Pridie driving in the runs. The
Cardinals opened a four-run lead in the fifth following errors
by first baseman Lucas Duda and center fielder  Angel Pagan .  Jose Reyes  of the Mets hit his major-league-leading 16th
triple of the season in the fourth inning. Reyes struck out in
the ninth inning for the first time in 88 plate appearances, the
longest such streak for a Mets player since Bob Bailor’s 94 in
1982.  The Mets, who won the first two games of the series, are
49-49 and in third place in the NL East. The team travels to
Miami for a three-game series with the last-place  Florida
Marlins  starting tomorrow. St. Louis is 51-47, 1 1/2 games
behind first-place Milwaukee in the NL Central.  To contact the reporter on this story:
