Peruvian bonds extended their
longest rally in almost a month after the political party of
 Peru ’s President-elect Ollanta Humala announced his appointments
for finance minister and cabinet chief.  The yield on Peru’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-denominated
bond due August 2020 fell for a fifth day, dropping three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 6.23 percent at 4 p.m.  New
York  time, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The yield
dropped six straight days in the period ending June 24.  Humala will name Miguel Castilla to head the  finance
ministry  as part of a cabinet that may ease concerns that the
former army rebel, who takes office July 28, will put in place
policies that will stunt economic growth and fiscal stability.
Gana Peru, Humala’s political party, made the announcement about
Castilla, who stepped down as deputy finance minister for
departing President  Alan Garcia  last weekend, today on its
Twitter account. Humala will name Salomon Lerner as Cabinet
chief, the party said.  “What he’s actually determined is that he’s going to
continue more or less in line with the current centrist
orientation of the outgoing cabinet,”  Enrique Alvarez , head of
Latin America fixed-income research at IdeaGlobal in New York,
said in a telephone interview. “There are no negative surprises
and that’s what’s guiding the entire risk spectrum in Peru.”  Peru’s sol rose 0.1 percent to 2.7350 per U.S dollar, from
2.7370 yesterday, according to Deutsche Bank’s local unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
