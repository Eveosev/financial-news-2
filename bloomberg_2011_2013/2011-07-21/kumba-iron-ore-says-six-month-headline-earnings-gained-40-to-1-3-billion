Kumba Iron Ore Ltd. (KIO) , the world’s
fourth-largest supplier of seaborne  iron ore , said first-half
profit rose 40 percent after average export prices for the
steelmaking material increased.  Net income climbed to 9.05 billion rand ($1.32 billion),
or 28.11 rand a share, from 6.49 billion rand, or 20.19 rand, 
a year earlier, the  Pretoria , South Africa-based company said 
today in a statement. Average prices for customers abroad 
jumped 56 percent, it said.  Kumba is looking to expand in West Africa, either through
new projects or acquisitions, said Chief Executive Officer Chris Griffith. The company targets annual production from the region
of 10 million to 20 million metric tons by 2020, depending on
the opportunities it finds, Griffith said on a conference call.  Kumba is benefiting from demand in  China , where it
estimates second-half steel production will rise 8 percent from 
a year earlier.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  yesterday reported record-
high iron-ore production for an 11th year, driven by sales to
China.  Vale SA (VALE3) , the largest iron-ore producer, said this month
it sees no slowdown from Chinese customers as the country seeks
to build 36 million low-income houses in the next five years.  Kolomela, Kumba’s expansion project near its Sishen mine in
 South Africa 's Northern Cape province, is “94 percent complete” 
and will start ore production toward the end of the fourth 
quarter, the company said. The mine targets annual output of 
9 million tons by 2013.  Sales Increase  First-half sales climbed 35 percent to 24.1 billion rand,
while the volume of ore sold was maintained at about 22 million
tons, even as abnormal rainfall affected mining, the company
said.  Kumba expects “modest downward pressure” on iron ore
prices in the second half of the year, when global crude steel
production is seasonally lower. Full-year costs are projected 
to rise 25 percent on increased expenses for wages and
waste stripping, Griffith said.  Kumba, 63 percent-owned by  Anglo American Plc (AAL) , according to
its website, said it will pay an interim cash dividend of 21.70
rand, compared with 13.50 rand a year earlier. Its shares were
little changed in Johannesburg trading, 0.1 percent lower at
52.451 rand as of 9:12 a.m. local time.  Chief Financial Officer Vincent Uren plans to step down at
the end of December “in order to take a break from corporate
life,” Kumba said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
