The ruble appreciated to the
strongest closing level against the dollar in six weeks as
European leaders discussed a plan to recapitalize struggling
banks and halt a surge in bond yields, boosting demand for
riskier, emerging-market assets.  The Russian currency gained 0.9 percent at 27.74 per dollar
at the 7 p.m. in Moscow, the strongest closing level since June
7. The ruble lost 0.5 percent to 39.9299 per euro, leaving it
0.2 percent stronger at 33.2255 versus the central bank’s target
dollar-euro basket.  The euro advanced, U.S. Treasuries fell for a second day
and oil prices rallied on speculation governments in  Europe  may
guarantee Greek bonds to make it easier for the  European Central
Bank  to accept a default on the debt. Crude oil,  Russia ’s
biggest export earner, climbed as much as 1.8 percent to $100.16
a barrel in  New York .  Investors are anticipating “that the European Union summit
will yield a concrete solution to the Greek crisis,”
Johannesburg, South Africa-base Tradition Analytics wrote in an
e-mailed note to clients.  Russian  government bonds  were little changed, leaving the
yield on the ruble Eurobond due in 2018 steady at 6.842 percent.
Non-deliverable forwards, which provide a guide to expectations
of currency movements and allow companies to hedge against them,
show the ruble at 28.018 per dollar in three months, compared
with 28.2735 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
