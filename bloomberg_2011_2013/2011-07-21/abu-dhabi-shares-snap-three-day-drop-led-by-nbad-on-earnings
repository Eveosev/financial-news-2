Abu Dhabi  shares advanced, snapping
a three-day decline, after the United Arab Emirates second-
largest bank by assets,  National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC (NBAD) , posted
second-quarter earnings that topped analysts’ estimates.  National Bank of Abu Dhabi rallied the most in more than a
month after profit rose 2.5 percent in the quarter.  Abu Dhabi
Islamic Bank (ADIB)  PJSC, the U.A.E.’s second-biggest bank complying
with Shariah rules, advanced 1.8 percent. The  ADX General Index (ADSMI) 
increased 0.2 percent to 2,693.27 at the 2 p.m. close in Abu
Dhabi, paring its loss for the week to 1.2 percent. The
 Bloomberg GCC 200 Index (BGCC200)  gained 0.2 percent.  NBAD results “beat consensus with positive surprise on
loan growth,” said Hassan El Salah, head of institutional
equities at Al Ramz Securities LLC, an Abu Dhabi-based
brokerage. “The shares are likely to do well going forward.”  The bank’s net income rose to 1.03 billion dirhams ($280
million) from 1 billion dirhams, the government-controlled
lender said in a statement yesterday. That beat the 962 million-
dirham median estimate of four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Operating income grew 13 percent to 2.01 billion dirhams.  U.A.E. banks are recovering from the credit crisis, which
slowed lending, hurt  investment banking  and led to rising loan
defaults. NBAD has the second-biggest weighting on Abu Dhabi’s
benchmark index after Emirates Telecommunications Corp., the
phone company known as Etisalat. About 21 million shares traded
in Abu Dhabi today, the lowest since April 2010, compared with a
six-month daily average of 77 million.  NBAD rose 1.8 percent, the biggest gain since June 15, to
11.25 dirhams. Abu Dhabi Islamic increased for the first time in
four days to 3.48 dirhams.  Dubai’s  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  dropped 0.2 percent, while
 Kuwait ’s SE Price Index increased 0.7 percent. Bahrain’s measure
lost 0.5 percent, while Qatar’s gauge rose less than 0.1
percent.  Saudi Arabia ’s market was closed for the weekend and
Oman’s for a holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
