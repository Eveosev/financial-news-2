The Greek government is seeking 200
million euros ($285 million) from  Siemens AG (SIE)  in fines for
bribery, Handelsblatt reported, citing unidentified people close
to the company.  Siemens has asked a Munich court for a declaration
confirming that  Greece  has no valid claims, the German newspaper
said.  Munich-based Siemens in the past few months has been
negotiating with the Greek government on a solution and may have
been willing to pay 150 million euros on the condition Greece
retracts its claims, the newspaper said.  Siemens spokespeople weren’t immediately available to
comment when contacted by Bloomberg News. Greek government
spokespeople didn’t respond immediately to a call and an e-mail
seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
