The cost to ship Middle East crude
oil to  Asia , the world’s busiest route for supertankers, rose
for the sixth day in a row as activity “picked up”, according
to Oslo-based investment bank Pareto Securities AS.  Charter rates for very large crude carriers, or VLCCs, each
able to haul 2 million barrels, on the benchmark Saudi Arabia-
to-Japan voyage climbed 0.7 percent to 50.35 Worldscale points,
according to the  Baltic Exchange  in London. That’s the first
time the rate has risen above 50 Worldscale points in three
weeks.  Six VLCCs were hired from the Middle East Gulf yesterday,
analyst Jonas Kraft said in an e-mailed note today. Daily rental
income, which varies with changes in fuel costs, fell 12 percent
to $2,327 today. Returns have plunged 50 percent since the end
of June and 91 percent this year.  The price of global ship fuel, or bunkers, advanced 32
percent this year to $671.08 a metric ton, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg from 25 ports worldwide.  Worldscale points are a percentage of a nominal rate, or
flat rate, for more than 320,000 specific routes. Flat rates for
every voyage, quoted in U.S. dollars a ton, are revised annually
by the Worldscale Association in  London  to reflect changing fuel
costs, port tariffs and exchange rates.  The Baltic Dirty Tanker Index, an overall measure of
shipping crude that includes vessels smaller than VLCCs,
declined 0.7 percent to 738 points, according to the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
