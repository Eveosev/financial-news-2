Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY) , whose top-selling
schizophrenia drug Zyprexa faces generic competition in October,
raised its 2011 profit forecast on revenue growth and declines
in the dollar.  Lilly increased its target for full-year adjusted earnings
to $4.25 to $4.35 per share, the Indianapolis-based drugmaker
said today in a statement. The company previously expected $4.15
to $4.30 a share. Earnings matched analyst forecasts.  “Overall, it was a fine quarter,” said  Seamus Fernandez ,
an analyst at Leerink Swann in  Boston , in a telephone interview.
“It was abundantly clear they were going to beat the top line,
it was just a question of magnitude.” Fernandez predicted the
increased forecast in a June 15 note.  Lilly is attempting to replenish its portfolio without a
major merger as patents expire on Zyprexa, the antidepressant
Cymbalta, and other medicines. It has drugs for  Alzheimer’s
disease , cancer, and diabetes in final-stage trials. The company
said it will boost research and development spending and has 70
potential new medicines in clinical development.  Lilly expects to lose $7 billion in annual sales between
2010 and 2014 as patents expire, the company said at a June 30th
analyst meeting.  The shares rose 55 cents to $38.72 at 9:54 a.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading, after jumping 8.9 percent in
the year before today.  Net Income  Second-quarter net income fell to $1.2 billion, or $1.07 a
share, from $1.35 billion, or $1.22, a year earlier, on higher
marketing and research expenses, Lilly said in the statement.
Earnings excluding one-time items were $1.18 a share, matching
the $1.18 average estimate of 15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Revenue increased 9 percent to $6.25 billion from $5.75
billion on higher sales of  Zyprexa  and Cymbalta. Analysts had
estimated $6.01 billion. Zyprexa sales rose 12 percent to $1.41
billion, while sales of Cymbalta rose 16 percent to $1 billion.  Leerink’s Fernandez said Zyprexa is the drug whose revenue
beat his forecast the most “and that is the one that is going
generic at the end of this year.”  Driving the revenue gains were both stronger sales volume
and a slide in the dollar, Lilly said. The dollar’s decline
against other currencies increases the value of revenue earned
outside the U.S. The dollar fell 14 percent from the end of
2010’s second quarter to June 30 of this year, as measured
against a group of six other currencies.  ‘Slightly Better’  “Slightly better than expected revenues, that is the
pattern we are seeing,”  Tony Butler , an analyst with  Barclays
Capital  in New York, said in a telephone interview before the
earnings were released.  Net income declined on higher expenses, including a $132.3
million restructuring charge for previously announced job cuts,
as well as higher operating expenses resulting from Lilly’s
diabetes collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, of
Ingelheim,  Germany . Marketing and administrative expenses rose
16 percent to $2.04 billion in the quarter.  The first diabetes drug from that collaboration, Tradjenta,
was approved in the  United States  in May. The partnership also
includes another oral diabetes drug in final-stage trials as
well as two novel insulin products in human trials.  To contact the reporter on this story:
