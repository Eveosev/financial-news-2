A former employee of  Akamai
Technologies Inc. (AKAM)  agreed to plead guilty to providing  trade
secrets  to an undercover agent posing as an Israeli intelligence
officer, the U.S. government said.  Elliot Doxer, 42, of Brookline, Massachusetts, will appear
at a plea hearing in Boston Aug. 29 on the charge of foreign
economic espionage, according to a statement by the office of
U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz.  “Economic espionage poses a tremendous risk, not only to
corporate America, but to the safety and well-being of our
nation’s security,” Ortiz said in the statement.  Doxer sent an e-mail to the Israeli consulate in Boston in
2006 when he worked in Akamai’s finance department saying that
he would provide any information helpful to  Israel , according to
the statement.  An FBI agent posing as an Israeli intelligence officer set
up a site in 2007 where they could exchange communications.
Doxer provided information about the company’s customers and
contracts, according to the statement.  Akamai, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, provides
services for delivering content over the Internet.  Doxer could receive a sentence of as long as 15 years in
prison, prosecutors said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
