The following is the text of
 Canada ’s employment insurance report for May released
by Statistics Canada.  The number of people receiving regular Employment Insurance (EI)
benefits decreased by 18,100 (-3.0%) in May to 577,300. This was
the eighth consecutive monthly decline.  There were fewer beneficiaries in most provinces, with the
largest percentage declines in  Alberta , Ontario, Quebec and
Manitoba.  Number of claims edges up in May
To receive EI benefits, individuals must first submit a claim.
The number of claims provides an indication of the number of
people who could become beneficiaries.  In May, 238,400 initial and renewal claims were received, up
slightly (+1.3%) from the previous month. This follows a 4.6% in
April. With these recent increases, the number of claims
received returned to levels observed earlier this year.  Note to readers
All data in this release are seasonally adjusted unless
otherwise specified.  Each month,  Statistics Canada  provides analysis of the current
labour market situation, using Employment Insurance (EI)
statistics and other sources. Earlier this month, the Labour
Force Survey (LFS) provided a picture of overall labour market
conditions, including unemployment, total employment and
characteristics of those affected by changes in the labour
market.  In this release, Statistics Canada provides additional sub-
provincial detail through the EI statistics. Details by industry
will follow with data from the Survey of Employment, Payrolls
and Hours.  EI statistics are produced from an administrative data source
provided by Human Resources and Skills Development Canada. These
statistics may, from time to time, be affected by changes to the
Employment Insurance Act or administrative procedures. The
number of regular beneficiaries and the number of claims
received for April and May are preliminary. In this release,
large centres correspond to those with a population of 10,000 or
more.  The number of beneficiaries is a measure of all persons who
received EI benefits from May 15 to 21. This period coincides
with the reference week of the LFS.  EI statistics indicate the number of people who received EI
benefits, and should not be confused with data coming from the
LFS, which provides information on the total number of
unemployed people.  There is always a certain proportion of unemployed people who do
not qualify for benefits. Some unemployed people have not
contributed to the program because they have not worked in the
past 12 months or their employment is not insured. Other
unemployed people have contributed to the program but do not
meet the eligibility criteria, such as workers who left their
job voluntarily or those who did not accumulate enough hours of
work to receive benefits.  The change in the number of regular EI beneficiaries reflects
various situations, including people becoming beneficiaries,
people going back to work, and people exhausting their regular
benefits.  While the number of claims received in May rose slightly at the
national level, it increased sharply in Saskatchewan (+23.9%) as
well as in Newfoundland and Labrador (+21.7%). There were slower
increases in Manitoba (+5.7%) and Quebec (+3.1%). At the same
time, there were declines in other provinces, with the most
notable percentage decreases in Prince Edward Island (-7.2%) and
 New Brunswick  (-2.3%).  Fewer beneficiaries in most provinces, especially Alberta
There were fewer people receiving regular employment insurance
benefits in May, with the fastest percentage decline occurring
in Alberta. The number of beneficiaries in this province fell by
7.1% to 34,400, extending the downward trend that began in the
fall of 2010.  In Ontario, the number of beneficiaries decreased by 3.3% in May
to 175,200. This was the eighth consecutive monthly decline. The
downward trend also continued in Quebec and Manitoba, as the
number of beneficiaries in May decreased by 3.2% in both
provinces.  While the downward trend also continued in Newfoundland and
Labrador (-2.7%), British Columbia (-2.4%) and Saskatchewan (-
2.2%), the percentage decline was slower in May.  Prince  Edward Island  was the only province with a notable
percentage increase in the number of beneficiaries, up 3.5% in
May. This follows an increase of 2.3% the previous month. There
was little change in May in both Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.  Sub-provincial and demographic overview
Employment Insurance data by sub-provincial region, sex and age
are not seasonally adjusted and are therefore compared on a
year-over-year basis.  Most large centres show year-over-year declines
Between May 2010 and May 2011, the number of people receiving
regular benefits at the national level fell by 109,000 (-16.9%).
Declines occurred in 129 of the 143 large centres (see map).
Large centres are those with a population of 10,000 or more.  The number of people receiving regular benefits fell in all five
large centres of Newfoundland and Labrador, with the fastest
pace of decline occurring in St. John’s (-13.2%). This continues
the trend of monthly year-over-year decreases that began in
April 2010 for St. John’s. In May, there was also a marked
percentage decline in Grand Falls-Windsor.  There were fewer beneficiaries between May 2010 and May 2011 in
27 of the 33 large centres in  Quebec , with the fastest decline
occurring in Saint-Georges. Over the same period, the number of
beneficiaries also decreased sharply in the census metropolitan
area of Québec, falling by 26.9% to 7,200. At the same time, the
percentage decline was slower in Montréal, down 18.2% to 51,900.
Other large centres with notable percentage decreases in the
number of beneficiaries were Granby, Magog, Sainte-Hyacinthe and
Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu. This contrasts with Amos and Sept-
Îles, the only two large centres in the province with notable
year-over-year percentage increases. There was little or no
change in all other large centres.  In Ontario, nearly all large centres posted year-over-year
declines in the number of beneficiaries, with marked percentage
decreases in Greater Sudbury, Tillsonburg, Thunder Bay, Elliot
Lake, Belleville and Guelph. In Toronto, the number of
beneficiaries fell by 22.2% to 64,900. This rate of decrease was
slightly higher than the average pace of year-over-year declines
observed over the previous 11 months.  In Manitoba, the number of people receiving regular benefits
fell or was unchanged in all four large centres. The fastest
rate of decline occurred in Winnipeg, down 29.8% to 5,200. This
was the largest of nine consecutive monthly year-over-year
percentage decreases for Winnipeg.  There were year-over-year declines in the number of
beneficiaries for all eight large centres in Saskatchewan. The
number of beneficiaries fell by 34.5% to 1,500 in Saskatoon and
by 30.4% to 960 in Regina.  In Alberta, all 12 large centres had fewer beneficiaries in May
compared with May 2010. The number of people receiving regular
benefits in May totalled 10,100 in both Calgary and  Edmonton ,
down 36.2% and 30.0% respectively from 12 months earlier. Other
large centres with a year-over-year decline of 30% or more were
Brooks, Red Deer, Grande Prairie and Medicine Hat.  The number of people receiving regular benefits decreased in all
large centres of British Columbia. The most notable percentage
declines occurred in Fort St. John, Prince Rupert, Quesnel, and
Kamloops. The number of beneficiaries fell by 25.6% to 26,100 in
 Vancouver , and by 15.9% to 3,100 in Victoria.  Demographic groups
In May, the number of men receiving regular employment insurance
benefits fell 18.0% from 12 months earlier to 332,900. For
women, the rate of decline over the same period was slightly
slower (-15.1%), with 203,400 women receiving benefits. These
decreases extend the year-over-year downward trend that began in
March 2010 for men and June 2010 for women.  Among men, the fastest pace of decline occurred for those aged
25 to 54 (-20.1%) and youths under 25 (-19.1%). For men 55 and
over, the decrease was about half as fast as that of their
younger cohorts (-10.1%).  Among women, the number of beneficiaries decreased by 20.2% for
youths under 25, and by 16.3% for women aged 25 to 54. The
number of women aged 55 and over who received benefits fell
8.5%.
