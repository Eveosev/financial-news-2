Japan  bought 129,587 metric tons of
milling wheat in a regular tender today, the least in two weeks,
the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said.  Shipment of the grain is set from Sept. 1 to Sept. 30,
according to Masafumi Otsuka at the ministry’s grain-trade
division. It was the smallest purchase since July 7, when the
government bought 126,271 tons.  The ministry, which controls overseas purchases and
domestic sales of wheat to stabilize supply, is  Asia ’s largest
buyer as a single entity. It has bought 1.88 million tons
through regular tenders this fiscal year, compared with 5.16
million tons purchased in the year ended March 31.  Details of this week’s tender are listed below:  To contact the reporter on this story:
