Olympia Capital Holdings Ltd. (DNKN) , a
Kenyan maker of building materials, jumped the most in a week
after the company said it returned to profit last fiscal year on
cost cuts.  The shares jumped 3.6 percent to 4.35 shillings at the 3
p.m. close in Nairobi, the biggest gain since July 14.  Net income totalled 35.1 million shillings ($389,783) in
the 12 months through February, compared with a loss of 14.6
million shillings a year earlier, the Nairobi-based company said
in a statement e-mailed by the city’s stock exchange today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
