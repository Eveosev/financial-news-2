Mozambique ’s production of staple
foods -- corn, rice, millet and sorghum -- rose an average 21.5
percent over the past five years, the Famine Early Warning
Network Systems said.  The southern African nation produced about 2.91 million
metric tons of staple foods in the 2010-2011 agricultural
season, the organization, known as Fewsnet, said in an e-mailed
statement today.  The increase in production means that even in traditionally
“food insecure” parts of  Mozambique , people will probably be
able to meet their basic needs until October, when the “lean
season” begins, said Fewsnet, which is partly funded by the
U.S.  During Mozambique’s lean season some residents resort to
harvesting wild fruit to take them through to February, when
early harvests begin, the organization said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
