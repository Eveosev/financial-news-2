Gasoline declined the most in almost
four weeks after U.S. initial jobless claims rose, indicating
the labor market remains fragile and increasing speculation that
demand for motor fuel may decline.  Futures fell as the Labor Department reported that
applications for jobless benefits rose 10,000 to 418,000 last
week. The Energy Department reported yesterday that gasoline
supplies rose for the first time in five weeks and that demand,
on a four-week average, was 2.2 percent below a year earlier.
Refineries operated at the highest rate in almost a year.  “We have higher refinery runs and demand is poor,” said
 Phil Flynn , vice president of research at PFGBest in  Chicago .
“And the jobs report is disappointing.”  Gasoline for August delivery slipped 4.75 cents, or 1.5
percent, to settle at $3.0995 a gallon on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , after trading as high as $3.1572. It was
the largest since June 24.  The premium, or backwardation, on the front-month contract
relative to September futures narrowed 0.96 cent to 4.28 cents,
the smallest since July 8.  Stockpiles of gasoline rose 757,000 barrels to 212.5
million in the week ended July 15, the Energy Department
reported yesterday. A survey by Bloomberg News projected a
decline of 250,000 barrels.  Refiners increased rates 2.3 percentage points to 90.3
percent, the highest level since July 30, 2010, pushing output
up 3.9 percent.  Gasoline Down  “Gasoline is down because inventories are up, refinery
runs are over 90 percent and we’re almost halfway through the
summer,” said Dominick Chirichella, senior partner at the
Energy Management Institute in  New York .  Gasoline and heating oil premiums over West  Texas 
Intermediate oil on Nymex narrowed as WTI rose and  Brent crude 
fell on the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange. Refineries on the East
Coast, where Nymex gasoline futures are delivered, primarily use
oil from Europe and West Africa, which are priced versus Brent.  “Gasoline is coming under pressure relative to the rest of
the complex because inventories are up and it’s expected there
will be more cargos coming from Europe because of the high
prices in New York,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil
Associates LLC in Houston.  Imports Up  Gasoline imports last week jumped 17 percent to 881,000
barrels a day, the most in five weeks, according to Energy
Department data. Tight supplies of reformulated gasoline in New
York Harbor may draw imports from Europe and shipments from
other U.S. regions.    Supplies of RBOB in the U.S. East Coast, or PADD 1 region,
last week were 20 percent below a year earlier, the Energy
Department reported yesterday. The Nymex futures contract
reflects RBOB delivered to New York Harbor.  “The strength in the Harbor has attracted barrels from a
number of sources,” said  Tom Knight , vice president of trading
and supply at Truman Arnold Cos. in Texarkana, Texas.  The WTI-Brent spread, based on September futures, was
$18.38 a barrel, down from $19.75 yesterday.  The September gasoline crack spread fell $2.32 to $29.25 a
barrel on the New York exchange, while the September heating oil
crack spread dropped $2.11 to $31.04.  Regular gasoline rose 0.5 cent to $3.689 a gallon
yesterday, according to AAA data.  Heating oil fell after reports the European Union officials
have reached a compromise to resolve the region’s 21-month
sovereign debt crisis.  “Gasoline is lagging the market which is being drawn
higher by the events in Europe,” Lipow said.  Heating oil for August delivery lost 1.92 cents, or 0.6
percent, to settle at $3.0992 a gallon on the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
