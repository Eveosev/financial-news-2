The U.S.  Commodity Futures Trading
Commission  is likely to move to implement limits on speculation
by “early fall,” ChairmanGary Gensler said today.  The proposal for so-called position limits, which was
issued by the CFTC in January, has been among the most
contentious aspects of the agency’s rulemaking required by the
Dodd-Frank Act. The proposal spurred more than 13,000 comments
from supporters such as  Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL)  and opponents such
as Barclays Plc.  Democrats in Congress, citing run-ups in commodity prices,
have urged the agency to quickly implement the trading curbs.  Gensler said the agency has been going through the public
comments, holding internal discussions and meeting with other
regulators as it considers how to implement the limits.  “We hope to move to that in early fall,” probably in
September or October, he told reporters after testifying at a
Senate Banking Committee hearing marking the one-year
anniversary of Dodd-Frank.  The CFTC is also likely to consider final rules in the
“early fall” governing clearinghouses, business-conduct
standards for swap dealers involved with clients such as
municipalities and pension funds, and the definition of swap
dealers, Gensler told  House Agriculture Committee  members at a
separate hearing today.  Gensler told lawmakers the CFTC aims to consider final
rules on trading and how quickly trades must be reported later
in the fall.  CFTC commissioners may consider a final rule governing
whistleblowers at its next meeting, scheduled for Aug. 4,
Gensler said on July 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
