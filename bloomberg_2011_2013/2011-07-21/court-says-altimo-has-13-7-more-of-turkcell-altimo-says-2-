Russia’s Altimo said it won a legal
case in the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court, which ruled that
Altimo’s appropriation of an extra 13.7 percent of Turkish
mobile phone operator Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri AS was legal.  “The court confirmed that Alfa validly appropriated
Cukurova’s shares in Turkcell,” Altimo said in an e-mailed
statement today. “We welcome this milestone decision that
should conclude the 5-year litigation.”  Altimo now owns 26.9 percent of Turkcell and Cukurova has
almost no stake, as the court ruling means Altimo will add
Cukurova’s 13.7 percent stake to the 13.2 percent it already
owns, an official for Altimo said on the usual condition of
anonymity because he’s not authorised to make statements to the
media on such issues.  Cukurova may appeal the decision at the Privy Council, a
higher London court, the official said. Still, the court almost
always upholds the rulings of the Caribbean court, he said.  Altimo, Cukurova and TeliaSonera AB have been battling for
control of Turkcell. TeliaSonera is the largest shareholder with
a 38 percent stake. Altimo told the court it was entitled to the
13.7 percent share after Cukurova failed to repay $1.35 billion
it borrowed in 2005.  Turkcell was unchanged at 8.34 liras in Istanbul. The share
last rose on July 12.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
