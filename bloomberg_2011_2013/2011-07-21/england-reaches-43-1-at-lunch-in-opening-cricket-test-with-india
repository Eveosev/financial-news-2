England  reached 43-1 in the opening
cricket Test against India at Lordâ€™s in London.  Alastair Cook scored 12 before being caught leg before
wicket by Zaheer Khan after England was put into bat after
losing the toss. Captain  Andrew Strauss  is 20 not out and
Jonathan Trott has scored 9.  The match is the 2,000th in the 134 years of elite Test
cricket. England can overtake India as the top team in the
International Cricket Council rankings if it wins the four-match
series by two Tests or more.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
