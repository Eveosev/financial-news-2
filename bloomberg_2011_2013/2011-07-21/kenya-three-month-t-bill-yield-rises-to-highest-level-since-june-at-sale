Kenya ’s three-month borrowing costs
rose for a second week after the central bank tightened
borrowing rules to control  money supply  and inflation.  The yield on the 91-day Treasury bills climbed to 9.004
percent at today’s sale from 8.999 percent on July 14, the
Nairobi-based Central Bank of Kenya said in an e-mailed
statement. The yield is the highest since June 16. The bank
issued 2.83 billion shillings ($31.4 million) of debt after
investors bid for 4.27 billion shillings of the 2 billion
shillings offered.  “The prevailing tight liquidity situation will push the
yields up,” Peter Mwirigi, chief dealer at Nairobi-based
Sterling Investment Bank Ltd., said in a phone interview before
the auction. “The market trend points to rising yields across
the various securities.”  Banks planning to lend to other operators in the  interbank
market  can no longer access funds through the discount window on
the same day, the central bank said on July 12, bolstering its
attempts to rein in inflationary expectations and curb
speculative trading in the shilling. The currency slid to its
weakest level in 17 years against the dollar last month.  Also on July 12, monetary policy makers reversed an
increase in the rate the central bank charges lenders for
overnight loans back to 6.25 percent after raising it to 8
percent two weeks before. Banks were using the 8 percent rate as
a base for interbank lending, resulting in “distortions in the
money market,” the central bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
