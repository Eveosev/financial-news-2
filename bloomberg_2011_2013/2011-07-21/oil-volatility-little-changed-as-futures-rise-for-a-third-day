Oil options volatility was little
changed as the underlying futures rose for a third consecutive
day in  New York  after manufacturing in the Philadelphia area
rebounded and on reports European Union officials have come up
with a plan for the regionâ€™s debt crisis, bolstering the euro.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
September, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 28.78 percent at 4 p.m. in New
York, from 28.8 percent yesterday.  Crude oil for September delivery rose 73 cents, or 0.7
percent, to settle at $99.13 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the highest settlement since June 14. Prices have
risen 29 percent in the past year.  The most active contracts in electronic trading today were
September $105 calls, with 1,692 lots changing hands. They
gained 14 cents to 96 cents a barrel. September $111 calls, the
next-most active option, rose 3 cents to 27 cents a barrel with
1,462 lots trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information on floor trading, where the
bulk of options trading occurs, the next business day.  September $110 calls were the most active options traded
yesterday, with 5,430 lots changing hands. They slipped 4 cents
to 28 cents a barrel. The next-most active options, September
$95 puts, dropped 30 cents to $1.84 a barrel on volume of 4,202.  Open interest was highest for December $120 calls with
44,722 contracts. Next were December $125 calls with 41,814 and
December $80 puts with 40,953.  To contact the reporter on this story:
