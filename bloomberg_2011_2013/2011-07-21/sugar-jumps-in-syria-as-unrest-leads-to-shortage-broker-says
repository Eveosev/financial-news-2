Sugar prices are surging in  Syria ,
exceeding levels on NYSE Liffe by more than 50 percent, as
social unrest in the country leads to a shortage of the
sweetener, Swiss Sugar Brokers said.  White, or refined, sugar is above $1,200 a metric ton in
Syria’s domestic market, Naim Beydoun, a broker at the Rolle,
Switzerland-based company, said in a report today. The sweetener
for October delivery was at $775 a ton by 4:02 p.m. on NYSE
Liffe in  London .  “Very low” sugar inventories in Syria mean imports will
be needed, according to Beydoun. “They are importing right
now,” he said.  Syria has been convulsed since March by rallies seeking to
topple President Bashar al-Assad, part of a wave of unrest in
the Arab world. Protest organizers estimate that at least 15,000
people who have been arrested since the rallies began are still
being held amid government promises to release political
prisoners.  Sugar is being smuggled into Syria from adjacent nations,
leading to rising prices in Lebanon and  Iraq , Beydoun said.  Syria cut import levies on white sugar to 3 percent from 7
percent, the official Syrian Arab News Agency reported July 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
