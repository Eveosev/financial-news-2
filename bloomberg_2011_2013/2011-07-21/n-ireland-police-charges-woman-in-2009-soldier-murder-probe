Northern Ireland  police said a 57
year-old woman has been charged in connection with the 2009
murders of two British soldiers in the U.K. region.  The woman is charged with providing property for the
purposes of terrorism and will appear in Laganside court in
Belfast tomorrow, the Police Service of Northern Ireland said in
an e-mailed statement today. The woman was arrested in November
2009 and released pending a report to the Public Prosecution
Service, police said.  Two men are scheduled to stand trial in relation to the
murders, the first military fatalities in the U.K. region since
1997, later this year. The soldiers were shot dead in an attack
at their base in Antrim town, north of Belfast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
