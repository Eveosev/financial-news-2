The sugar cane crop in  Brazil ’s
Center South, the country’s main producing region, may be about
520 million metric tons and the harvest may end earlier than
usual, according to Sao Paulo-based consultancy Canaplan.  Production in the area was estimated at 533.5 million tons
by industry group Unica on July 13. Output will fall short of
the group’s forecast and will be about 520 million tons, Luiz Carlos Correa Carvalho, director at Canaplan, said by phone from
 Sao Paulo  yesterday. Brazil is the world’s largest producer of
sugar. The harvest usually runs from April to December.  “As the quality of the cane gets worse, with potential
rains and flowering hurting the crop, the tendency of the crop
is to fall to about 520 million tons,” he said. “The low
availability of cane may mean that the harvest will end earlier,
by the end of October, beginning of November.”  Frost that reached some producing states in Brazil,
alongside the flowering of the cane, accelerated deterioration
of the cane’s quality, he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
