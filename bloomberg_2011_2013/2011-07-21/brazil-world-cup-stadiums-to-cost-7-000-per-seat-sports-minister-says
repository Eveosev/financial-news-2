(Corrects per-seat cost in other World Cups in first
paragraph.)  Brazil ’s stadiums for the 2014
soccer  World Cup  will cost $7,000 per seat, compared with an
average of about $6,000 per seat in other recent World Cups,
Brazil’s Sports Minister Orlando Silva said in a telephone
conference call.  The higher costs in Brazil are due to a fast-growing
economy, and a heated construction sector, Silva said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
