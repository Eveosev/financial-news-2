Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) , the world’s
largest computer maker, plans to buy back $10 billion of its
stock, part of an effort to buoy its languishing shares.  The plan comes in addition to the an earlier buyback plan
announced last year, Palo Alto, California-based Hewlett-Packard
said today in a regulatory filing.  The company’s board also declared a regular cash dividend
of 12 cents a share. The dividend, the fourth of the company’s
fiscal year, will be payable on Oct. 5 to shareholders of record
as of Sept. 14, the company said in a separate statement.  Hewlett-Packard Chief Executive Officer  Leo Apotheker  is
looking for ways to boost shareholder returns amid a flagging
stock price. The shares, down 14 percent this year, rose 95
cents, or 2.7, percent to $36.23 today in New York Stock
Exchange trading. The stock is down 22 percent since Aug. 6,
when former CEO  Mark Hurd  resigned.  The moves today are in addition to the earlier stock
repurchase plan. As of April 30, the company had about $5.9
billion of repurchase authorizations available under that $10
billion program approved in August.  To contact the reporters on this story:
