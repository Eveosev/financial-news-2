based Ecobank Transnational Incorporated, rose to a one-week
high after saying it may merge with Trust Bank Ltd. of  Ghana .  The shares advanced 1 pesewa, or 0.3 percent, to 3.44 cedis
as of the 3 p.m. close in the capital, Accra, the highest since

of the two businesses,” according to a joint statement
published in the Ghanaian Times newspaper today.  “The news that the bank may merge with the Trust Bank to
become a bigger business is spicing some investor interest in
