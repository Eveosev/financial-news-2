Serena Williams  will use a special
ranking to play in the U.S. Open after missing almost a year of
competition because of injury, officials of the Grand Slam
tennis tournament said yesterday.  Williams, 29, who won the event in 1999, 2002 and 2008, is
ranked 172nd in the WTA Tour singles rankings this week after
being sidelined from July 2010 to June of this year by two foot
operations and a blood clot in her lungs.  An injury-protected ranking is available to a player out of
competition for at least six months and less than two years,
according to WTA rules. Players can use the ranking for as many
as eight tournaments, including one Grand Slam.  The  U.S. Open , which features 128 players each in the
women’s and men’s draws, will be played Aug. 29 to Sept. 11 in
 New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
