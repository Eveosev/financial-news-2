Canadian natural gas fell after the
U.S. government reported a stockpile increase of the power-plant
fuel that matched analyst expectations.  Canadian gas prices, which usually follow their U.S.
counterparts on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , dropped 1.3
percent after the U.S. Energy Department said gas inventories
gained 60 billion cubic feet last week. Analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg forecast a gain of 60 billion.  “I see the link with the Canadian market because the West
came in with a 16-bcf injection when we were expecting 13 bcf
tops,” Laurent Key, vice president of natural gas research at
Societe General in New York, said in a telephone interview.
“Demand was overestimated in the West so it’s bearish for
Canadian gas.”  Alberta  gas for August delivery declined 4.75 cents to
C$3.46 per gigajoule ($3.47 per million British thermal units)
as of 3:10 p.m. New York time, according to  NGX , a Canadian
Internet market. September gas fell 5.5 cents to C$3.45. Gas
traded on the exchange goes to users in Canada and the U.S. and
is priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.  Natural gas for August delivery fell 10.5 cents to settle
at $4.395 per million Btu on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  The high in  Los Angeles  may reach 80 degrees (27 Celsius)
today, 4 below normal, according to AccuWeather Inc. of  State
College , Pennsylvania.  Air Conditioning  Cooling demand in Los Angeles will be about 4 percent less
than normal until at least July 28, said Weather Derivatives,
based in Belton, Missouri.  Power plants  use 30 percent of U.S.
gas supplies, according to the Energy Department.  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 15.6 billion cubic
feet as of 2 p.m. in  New York .  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.63 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 1.8 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 448 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.96 billion cubic feet today, about 81 percent of its
capacity of 2.41 billion.  Gas at the Alliance Pipeline delivery point near Chicago
fell 10.51 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $4.7014 per million Btu as
of 1:28 p.m. New York time on the Intercontinental Exchange.
Alliance is an express line that can carry 1.5 billion cubic
feet a day to the Midwest from western  Canada .  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas dropped 5.14 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $4.2709.  To contact the reporter on this story:
