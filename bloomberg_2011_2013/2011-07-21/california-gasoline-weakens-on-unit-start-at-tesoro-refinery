California  gasoline weakened after
 Tesoro Corp. (TSO)  said it plans to start a process unit at its Los
Angeles refinery and San Francisco Carbob rolled into August
trading.  Prompt-delivery of Carbob, California-blend gasoline, in
Los Angeles fell 1.25 cents to a discount of 20.5 cents versus
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  as of 3:58
p.m. The fuelâ€™s discount is the largest since January 2008, when
the fuel declined to 22.5 cents below futures.  Tesoro plans to flare gases at its refinery in Wilmington,
California, tomorrow through July 26 as it restarts a process
unit, Mike Marcy, a company spokesman, said in an e-mail. The
San Antonio-based company began work on a unit July 7.  The discount for Carbob in  San Francisco  widened 0.25 cent
to 20.5 cents versus futures. The fuel began trading for August
delivery today, with Los Angeles Carbob expected to follow suit
tomorrow, said Randy Simpson, vice president of supply and
trading at Idemitsu Apollo Corp. in Sacramento, California.  Carbob strengthened 1 cent in Los Angeles and 2 cents in
San Francisco yesterday. The state Energy Commission said
California refineries cut their production of gasoline by 8.5
percent and their inventories of the fuel by 3.6 percent in the
week ended July 15.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in Portland, Oregon,
weakened 4 cents to a discount of 14 cents.  The premium for low-sulfur California diesel in Los Angeles
strengthened 1.62 cents to 5 cents a gallon versus Nymex heating
oil futures. The premium for the same fuel in San Francisco fell
0.5 cent to 4 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
