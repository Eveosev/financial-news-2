Unilever Plc will build a new plant
in central  Turkey  at an initial cost of about $100 million to
make ice-cream and help boost its leading position in the
market, the company said today.  The plant, owned by Unilever’s Turkish unit, will produce
Algida ice-creams, which has a 70 percent share in the Turkish
market that grew 28 percent to 134 million liters, or 945
million liras ($565 million), in 2010, the company said in an e-
mailed statement to Bloomberg. The plant will be built near the
central Turkish city of Aksaray, it said.  Unilever’s ice-cream plant in Corlu, near Istanbul, has an
annual capacity of 200 million liters, the statement said.  Unilever, which is also producing personal care products,
expects 1.2 billion euros ($1.7 billion) of sales in Turkey this
year, Izzet Karaca, Unilever’s head in charge of Turkey, said in
an interview on July 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
