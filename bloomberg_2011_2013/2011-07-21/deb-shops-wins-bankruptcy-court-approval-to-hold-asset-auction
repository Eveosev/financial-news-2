Deb Shops Inc. , a bankrupt retailer
of clothing for teenage girls and young women, won court
approval to sell its assets at auction with an opening bid from
lenders of $75 million.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Kevin Carey in Wilmington,  Delaware ,
today gave Deb permission to hold an Aug. 31 auction. He also
authorized the company to borrow as much as $21.7 million from
Ableco Finance LLC, as the agent for lenders, to help fund
operations while in bankruptcy.  Selling assets at an auction is the best way to preserve
value for the estates and creditors, Damon P. Meyer, a lawyer
for Deb, said at today’s hearing. Lenders led by Ableco have
offered to exchange debt owed to them in return for the assets,
according to court documents. Ableco owns most of the $129.9
million in debt with a first priority of repayment.  Lee Equity Partners LLC, the New York-based private-equity
firm that bought Philadelphia-based Deb in 2007, is part of the
purchasing group, according to a June 26 statement.  All other offers to compete at the auction must be
submitted by Aug. 24, court papers show. Deb will cancel the
auction if it doesn’t receive any other suitable bids. Carey is
scheduled to consider approving the sale Sept. 9.  The company listed debt of $270.1 million and assets of
$124.4 million as of April 30 in Chapter 11 documents filed June
26. The retailer, which traces its roots to 1932, has about 318
stores in 44 states, court papers show.  The main case is In re DSI Holdings Inc., 11-11941,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
