Microgen Plc (MCGN) , a U.K. supplier of
business software, said first-half profit rose 20 percent as
more banks used its products.  Adjusted operating profit rose to 4.6 million pounds ($7.4
million) from 3.8 million pounds a year earlier. Sales rose 18
percent to 19 million pounds, the Fleet, England-based company
said in a Regulatory News Service statement today.  Growth was driven by a strong performance from Microgenâ€™s
Aptitude Solutions range of business software, the company said,
which accounted for 57 percent of revenue. Sales of the product
grew by 38 percent in the period to 10.8 million pounds as
banks, insurers, and media organizations purchased software to
process data sets too big for competitors to handle.  Earnings per share rose 33 percent to 4 pence, while the
interim dividend increased 22 percent to 1.1 pence per share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
