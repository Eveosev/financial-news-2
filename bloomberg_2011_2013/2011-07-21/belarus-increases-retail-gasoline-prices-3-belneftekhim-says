Belarus raised retail gasoline
prices to keep pace with increases in its customs union partners
of Russia and  Kazakhstan , state-owned  oil company  Belneftekhim
said in a statement.  Fuel prices rose an average of 3 percent today, pushing the
cost of 95-octane fuel to 4,650 Belarusian rubles per liter (93
U.S. cents) the Minsk-based company said on its  website .  Belarusians staged a car blockade in central Minsk last
month after the authorities increased fuel prices by an average
of 31 percent, forcing President Alexander Lukashenko to restore
maximum prices to their original levels the day after the
protests.  To contact the reporters on this story:
