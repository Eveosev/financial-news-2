International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) , the world’s biggest computer-services provider, appointed
Kevin Reardon as head of mergers and acquisitions, according to
a person with direct knowledge of the situation.  Reardon, who has been general manager of intellectual
property at IBM, is taking over from Elias Mendoza, the former
global head of corporate development, said the person who
declined to be identified because IBM hasn’t announced the move.
Mendoza joined Union Square Advisors LLC as a partner in  New
York , the firm said in a statement July 20.  IBM, which has made more than 100 deals in the past decade,
said last year it plans to spend about $20 billion on
acquisitions through 2015. The Armonk, New York-based company
had $11.7 billion in cash at the end of June.  IBM made 23 acquisitions worth $4.26 billion since Mendoza
took over M&A in June 2009, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Over that time, IBM’s biggest deal was the $1.7
billion purchase of analytics-technology provider Netezza Corp
last year. The company has announced only one deal this year,
according to Bloomberg data.  Mendoza, who joined IBM in 2006 as head of corporate
development in Japan and growth markets, previously worked for
 Morgan Stanley (MS)  in New York,  London  and Tokyo.  Doug Shelton, an IBM spokesman, declined to comment.  IBM climbed $1.25 to $184.90 yesterday in New York Stock
Exchange trading, and had gained 26 percent this year before
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
