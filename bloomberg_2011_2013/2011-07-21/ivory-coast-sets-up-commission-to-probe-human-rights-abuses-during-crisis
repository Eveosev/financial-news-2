Ivory Coast President  Alassane Ouattara  set up a commission to investigate human rights abuses
that may have occurred during the West African nation’s
political crisis this year.  The commission will last for six months and “help
understand how and why people were able to conceive, plan and
execute massive human rights and public liberty violations,”
the government said in an e-mailed statement today.  As many as 3,000 people died after  Laurent Gbagbo , who
ruled the country for a decade, refused to step down following
the November presidential election, according to the
 International Criminal Court . The former president was captured
on April 11 after weeks of fighting in the commercial capital,
Abidjan.  As many as 24 of Gbagbo’s associates, including former
Prime Minister Gilbert Ake N’Gbo and ex-governor of the regional
central bank Philippe-Henri Dacoury-Tabley, were charged in June
with harming state security and economic crimes.  Abidjan’s prosecutor Simplice Koffi Kouadio said on July 4
that he was preparing to formally indict Gbagbo, currently
detained in the northern town of Korhogo, with endangering state
security, embezzlement and setting up armed gangs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
