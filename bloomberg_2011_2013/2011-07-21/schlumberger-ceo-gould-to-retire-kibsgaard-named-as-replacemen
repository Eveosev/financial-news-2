Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB)  Chief Executive
Officer Andrew Gould will retire on Aug. 1 and be replaced by
Chief Operating Officer Paal Kibsgaard.  Gould, 64, will remain as chairman of Schlumberger, the
world’s largest oilfield-services provider, until April 2012,
the Houston- and Paris-based company said in a statement today.
Tony Isaac, Schlumberger’s independent lead director, will
assume the top spot on the board when Gould departs.  Kibsgaard, 44, is a petroleum engineer who began his career
at Exxon Mobil Corp. in 1992. He joined Schlumberger five years
later as a reservoir engineer in  Saudi Arabia . Kibsgaard, who
has a master’s degree from the Norwegian Institute of
Technology, was appointed COO last year, where he has been
responsible for daily management of Schlumberger’s worldwide
operations.  Schlumberger rose $2.55, or 2.9 percent, to $90.96 at 4:15
p.m. in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
