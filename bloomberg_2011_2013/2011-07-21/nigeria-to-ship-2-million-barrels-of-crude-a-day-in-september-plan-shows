Nigeria , the largest oil producer in
 Africa , is scheduled to export 2 million barrels a day of 14
major crude grades in September, the lowest in six months,
according to loading plans obtained by Bloomberg News.  The country will ship 65 consignments in September totaling
59.9 million barrels. This compares with next month’s plan to
export 71 cargoes amounting to 64.6 million barrels. The daily
shipments for September will be 4.2 percent less than August.  Nigeria will ship 12 Qua Iboe, seven Agbami, seven
Forcados, six Bonny Light, five Akpo, five Bonga, five Escravos,
four Brass River, four Erha, three Amenam, three Okwori, two
Yoho and two Antan shipments. The cargoes range from 280,000
barrels to 1 million barrels each. It will not export any OSO
grade in September.  Including smaller blends such as Abo, EA and Pennington,
the country will export 70 cargoes amounting to 64.1 million
barrels, or 2.14 million barrels in September.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
