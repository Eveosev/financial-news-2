New York Mets third baseman  David Wright  will rejoin the team tomorrow against the  Florida Marlins 
after missing 58 games with a stress fracture in his lower back,
the club announced on its website.  Wright, 28, will come off the disabled list after
completing his rehabilitation assignment at the Mets’ Class A
affiliate in Port St. Lucie,  Florida , where he hit .476 in six
games. Mets manager Terry Collins said on the website that he
expects Wright to start tomorrow and bat fourth in the lineup.  “He said he feels great,” Collins said today. “He
doesn’t feel he needs another 10 at-bats. He said he’s seeing
the ball good, he’s healthy and he’s just ready to go. This
guy’s been here. He’s a five-time All-Star. Those guys know
themselves.”  Wright was hitting .226 with six home runs and 18 runs
batted in before going on the disabled list on May 18. He played
part of the early season with back discomfort after a collision
with Houston Astros outfielder Carlos Lee on April 19.  The Mets, 49-49 and in third place in the National League
East division, lost to the St. Louis Cardinals 6-2 today at Citi
Field in  New York . The team went 30-28 in Wright’s absence, and
sits eight games behind the division-rival  Atlanta Braves  for
the wild card, a playoff berth given to the team with the best
record that doesn’t win its division.  To contact the reporter on this story:
