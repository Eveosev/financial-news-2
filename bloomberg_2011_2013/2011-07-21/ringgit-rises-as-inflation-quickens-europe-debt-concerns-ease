Malaysia’s ringgit gained for a
third day after a government report showed inflation quickened
and on expectations European leaders will make progress in
resolving the region’s sovereign-debt crisis at today’s summit.  The German government said yesterday  Chancellor Angela
Merkel  and French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  have reached “a
joint position” on the Greek debt crisis. Malaysia’s consumer
prices increased 3.5 percent from a year earlier in June, the
most more than two years, according to data released yesterday.
Economists expected a 3.6 percent gain, a Bloomberg poll showed.  “The so-called agreement between Germany and  France  on the
Greek debt crisis is driving interest in emerging-market
assets,” said Yeo Chin Tiong, head of financial markets at
Alliance Bank Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. “Though Malaysia’s consumer
prices came in slower-than-expected, there is still a case for
the central bank to hike rates if prices continue to rise.”  The ringgit climbed 0.12 percent to 2.9943 per dollar as of
4:15 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , after appreciating 0.3 percent
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It earlier
reached 2.9925, the strongest level since July 11.  Bank Negara Malaysia Governor Zeti Akhtar Aziz said this
week that containing inflation was a priority as the benchmark
policy rate of 3 percent was “quite low.” The nation will
raise borrowing costs by 25 basis points, or 0.25 percentage
point, to 3.25 percent this quarter, according to a Bloomberg
survey of 10 economists. The next review is on Sept. 8.  Bonds fell as the treasury prepares to sell more 10-year
Islamic debt maturing April 2021 later this month. The yield on
the government’s 4.16 percent notes due July 2021 declined two
basis points or 0.02 percentage point to 3.89 percent, according
to Bursa Malaysia Bhd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
