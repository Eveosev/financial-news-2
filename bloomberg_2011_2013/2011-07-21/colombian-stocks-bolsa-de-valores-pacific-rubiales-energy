The following companies had unusual
price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 4 p.m. New York time.  The IGBC Index rose 2.1 percent to 13,880.9, while the
Colcap Index gained 1.2 percent to 1,647.32.  Bolsa de Valores de Colombia (BVC)  SA, the operator of
Colombia’s main stock exchange, rose 0.8 percent to 39.8 pesos.
The shares rose for a second day after  BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , the
world’s largest asset manager, launched an exchange-traded fund
to track Colombia’s Colcap Index and said it plans to offer more
ETFs to tap into the South American nation’s growing savings.  Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PREC)  , the Toronto-based
 oil company  that operates fields in Colombia, surged the most
since it began trading in 2009 after  Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL)  ,
Colombia’s biggest producer, said second-quarter profit more
than doubled from a year ago.  “The Ecopetrol results are an indicator that the sector is
having a good moment, and the market could be deducing that
Rubiales will also have positive results this quarter after its
share price dropped,” said Juan Nicolas Pardo, analyst at
Valores Bancolombia SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
