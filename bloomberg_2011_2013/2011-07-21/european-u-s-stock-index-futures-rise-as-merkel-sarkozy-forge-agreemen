European stocks advanced, with the
benchmark Stoxx  Europe  600 Index rising for a third day, as
investors speculated that European Union leaders will agree on a
plan to extend a bailout for  Greece .  National Bank of Greece SA (ETE)  led a rally of banks across
Europe as the leaders of euro-area governments were said to
accept lower  interest rates  on loans to Greece, Portugal and
Ireland.  Commerzbank AG (CBK)  soared 9.6 percent, its largest gain
since Sept. 2009, while  Barclays Plc (BARC)  jumped 7.8 percent.  The Stoxx 600 climbed 1 percent to 270.48 at the 4:30 p.m.
close in  London , gaining for a third day. The benchmark measure
has still retreated 7.1 percent from this year’s high on Feb. 17
amid growing concern that the region’s debt crisis will spread
from Greece to Italy and Spain.  “This is an element of relief,” said Guillaume Duchesne,
an equity strategist at BGL BNP Paribas SA in Luxembourg. “If
there is an extension, that reassures the market. Sentiment was
so negative recently that any news to avoid a collapse is good
news. Now we have to see the details of the plan. We hope there
will be a solution and the market can extend gains.”  National benchmark indexes in every western European market
except Iceland and Sweden rose today. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index
increased 0.8 percent.  Germany ’s  DAX Index (DAX)  climbed 1 percent,
while France’s  CAC 40 Index (CAC)  rallied 1.7 percent.  Bailout Fund  Euro-area leaders may accept a temporary Greek default,
officials said. The heads of government meeting in Brussels may
cut the interest rates on loans to Greece, Portugal and Ireland
to about 3.5 percent and double the repayment period to at least
15 years.  The EU’s main rescue fund, the European Financial Stability
Facility, may get the power to buy bonds from investors, helping
countries to recapitalize lenders and offering precautionary
lines of credit to repel speculative attacks.  The Stoxx 600 Banks Index posted its biggest three-day gain
in a year, led by National Bank of Greece which surged 11
percent to 4.90 euros.  EFG Eurobank Ergasias SA (EUROB) , Greece’s
second-biggest lender, increased 6.8 percent to 2.82 euros.
Alpha Bank SA soared 3.8 percent to 3.03 euros.  Commerzbank rallied 9.6 percent to 2.75 euros in  Frankfurt ,
its biggest gain in 22 months. Barclays jumped 7.8 percent to
239.9 pence in London, its largest jump since May 2010.
 UniCredit SpA (UCG)  rose 10 percent to 1.38 euros and Intesa Sanpaolo
SA surged 9.5 percent to 1.80 euros, its largest rally in six
months.  European services and manufacturing growth weakened more
than economists had forecast to the slowest pace in almost two
years, adding to signs that the euro-area’s recovery is losing
momentum as its debt crisis persists.  Purchasing Managers  A composite index based on a survey of euro-area purchasing
managers in both industries fell to 50.8 in July from 53.3 in
June, London-based Markit Economics said today. That’s the
lowest since August 2009. Economists had predicted a drop to
52.6, the median of 17 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey
showed.  Swedbank AB (SWEDA)  jumped 6.2 percent to 110.80 kronor. The bank
said second-quarter net income rose to 3.45 billion kronor ($546
million) from 1.57 billion kronor a year earlier. That beat the
average analyst estimate of 3.22 billion kronor in a Bloomberg
survey.  AstraZeneca, Kingfisher  AstraZeneca Plc (AZN)  rallied 2 percent to 3,092 pence after
winning U.S. approval for its heart drug Brilinta, a potential
$1 billion seller that will rival Plavix, the world’s second-
best selling drug. The Food and Drug Administration cleared
Brilinta, also known as ticagrelor, for use by patients with
severe chest pain or heart-attack history to cut the risk of
heart attacks, strokes and death, the agency said yesterday.  Kingfisher Plc (KGF)  advanced 5.6 percent to 267.4 pence.
Europe’s largest home-improvement retailer rose as growth in
sales at its French business helped offset a decline in revenue
at its U.K. stores.  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  increased 2.5 percent to 4.18 euros even as the
Finnish mobile-phone maker that’s ceding market share to Google
Inc. and Apple Inc. reported its first quarterly loss in 1 1/2
years. Handset sales slumped after Nokia agreed to install
Microsoft Corp.’s operating system on its smartphones.  Ericsson AB slumped 9.7 percent to 83 kronor for its
largest retreat in more than 2 1/2 years. The company said
second-quarter net income rose to 3.12 billion kronor from 1.88
billion kronor a year earlier. That fell short of the average
estimate for profit of 3.88 billion kronor, according to a
survey of analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  Konecranes, Scania Fall  Konecranes Oyj (KCR1V)  sank 8.3 percent to 22.92 euros for its
largest drop since November 2008. The company reported second-
quarter net income of 15.5 million euros ($22 million), missing
the 23.7 million-euro mean estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Scania AB (SCVB)  retreated 4.5 percent to 127.30 kronor. The
Swedish truckmaker controlled by  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  reported
quarterly profit that missed analysts’ estimates as orders from
 Brazil  slowed.  Volkswagen AG slipped 3.5 percent to 145.10 euros as
Manager Magazin reported that Europe’s largest carmaker has
offered to buy General Motors Co.’s Opel unit. Volkswagen
declined to comment on the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
