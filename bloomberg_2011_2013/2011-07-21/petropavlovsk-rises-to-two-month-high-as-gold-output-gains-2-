Petropavlovsk Plc (POG) , a producer of
gold in  Russia , rose to the highest price in more than two
months in London trading after second-quarter output jumped 43
percent, led by gains at the Pioneer mine.  Petropavlovsk rose 2.4 percent to 842 pence as of 4:30 p.m.
local time, the highest closing price since May 11. So-called
attributable gold output climbed to 143,700 ounces from 100,700
ounces a year earlier, the company said today in a statement.
Petropavlovsk reaffirmed its 600,000-ounce full-year forecast.  Gold producers are seeking to expand to meet rising demand
that has driven up prices as investors seek a safe haven amid
 Europe ’s sovereign-debt woes and weak currencies. Gold for
immediate delivery averaged a record $1,509.22 an ounce in the
second quarter, compared with $1,196.53 an ounce a year earlier.  “The strong first half and the fact that the second half
of the year is on schedule means that we remain on track to
achieve the 600,000-ounce production target,” Peter Hambro,
chairman of the London-based company, said in the statement.  An expansion of the company’s Malomir mine was commissioned
ahead of schedule, it said. After missing production targets
last year, Petropavlovsk has been cautious with expectations and
excluded output from the Malomir expansion and its new Albyn
mine, set to begin production in the fourth quarter.  Prudent Approach  “Given past production disappointments we continue to
think it is prudent to exclude this incremental production,”
Liberum Capital Ltd. said in a note to investors today.
“However it appears increasingly likely that Malomir and Albyn
could” help beat management’s 600,000-ounce guidance.  Hambro said that if Malomir has a “significant” impact in
the next quarter, the company may change guidance. “We’re very
conservative about these things,” Hambro said in a telephone
interview. “You never can tell, so until we’re sure we’ll leave
it as we are.”  Petropavlovsk sold 266,000 ounces of gold in the first half
at an average $1,455 an ounce. First-half output was 219,100
ounces, compared with 166,300 ounces a year earlier,
“marginally ahead” of the company’s forecast, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
