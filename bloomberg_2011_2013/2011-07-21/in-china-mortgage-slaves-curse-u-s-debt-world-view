The list of trending topics on  China ’s leading, twitter-like microblog, Sina Weibo, is typically dominated by entertainment news, celebrity gossip and the daily grind. So it was unusual when, on July 7, 2011,  news of China’s central bank's quarter-point interest hike  went to the top of that list. No, Chinese microbloggers weren’t rushing to discuss the macroeconomic consequences of the bank’s move. Rather, they were venting about how their mortgages, almost all of which are tied to that benchmark interest rate, had suddenly become less affordable. A Sina Weibo user,  QingMu2010 , shortly thereafter railed: Brother Salary and Brother Interest Rate are on Chinese urban dwellers' minds  these days , especially in light of the rising prices of  pretty much everything . This includes, of course,  housing . “One who doesn't have a house can’t afford one, and one who has bought a house can’t pay the mortgage!” Tweeted  Dragon In Society  on Sina. “It’s not easy to become a mortgage slave and one who has become a mortgage slave can't afford the pain.” Best as I can determine, there are no publicly available statistics on private mortgage defaults in China. There has also been little coverage of this issue in the Chinese or foreign press. Perhaps that’s because there aren’t many private mortgage defaults; or perhaps it’s because those are the kinds of numbers that the Chinese Communist Party would prefer not to circulate. But whatever the reason, public concerns over debt is palpable these days. In late June, the Party revealed that the post-2008 infrastructure binge that seemed to power much of the Chinese economy through the global economic crisis was largely financed on unsustainable and, in many cases, un-repayable,  local government debt . In the weeks since, bloggers, microbloggers, and editorialists have pondered how China –- a developing country, let’s not forget –- became a major creditor to an American government seemingly hell-bent on defaulting on its public debt. For those who self-identify as "mortgage slaves" (or sympathize with them), the ironies are particularly painful. “In this world, the poor borrow money to the rich,” tweeted  Yu Liang , a North American correspondent for Xinhua, the Chinese state news agency. “I have decided that from now on, when Americans smile at me, I will shout at them: ‘Smiling for what! Hurry up and pay back our money!!!’” Curiously, official voices featured in official Chinese media haven't said much on this subject. Many microbloggers, and a few commentators on established news sites, speculate that they are reluctant to say something that could damage China’s investment in  U.S. debt . On July 19, the Chinese State Administration of Foreign Exchange issued a statement encouraging the United States to  take “responsible” policy measures  to increase confidence in  U.S. government debt  and the dollar, but offered no specific criticism. The self-declared government mouthpiece, People’s Daily,  in a July 20 editorial , addressed the issue in the context of the Dali Lama's recent visit to the White House: But People's Daily has yet to declare an explicit opinion on how America’s political class manages China's finances. This week, HeXun, a leading financial Chinese news portal, featured a commentary that targeted the  China Investment Corporation , which manages China’s sovereign wealth fund, for its caginess on the issue.  HeXun reasoned  it was due to shame: “Of course, their restrained attitude also reflects China's embarrassing identity as the largest creditor country of America.” Meanwhile, at East Day, a Shanghai internet portal, Zhang Yunling, Director of the Asia-Pacific Research Institute at the  Chinese Academy of Social Sciences , took the more nuanced approach that one would expect from an establishment figure. He  suggested  that the default risk calls for change in the global economic order: The China Securities Journal seemed less concerned. Its  peculiar editorial , “No Need to Worry About the 1.15 Trillion US Debt,” tops even the most patriotic American analyst's confidence in U.S. debt. It said: It’s awfully hard to find a similar opinion among the Chinese microblogging masses, where there’s flagrant anger at both the Chinese government for funding the U.S. debt and the U.S. government for luring them into such a lousy investment. For example, Sina user  An Xinnuoxiao  tweeted: Plenty of other Chinese microbloggers have a more nuanced understanding of the American political deadlock, although that understanding has done little to increase their sympathy for the U.S. government system responsible it. In any case, for those netizens not latching onto conspiracies to explain a U.S. default, there reigns a sort of gallows humor, as exemplified by this Sina tweet from  Bamboo Bear : Default risk or not, there’s absolutely zero indication that China’s investment managers have any intention of weaning themselves from U.S. debt in the short-term. Indeed, even as paranoia over U.S. sovereign debt increases, Chinese interest in  purchasing U.S. assets  –- debt, real estate, and companies –- continues to rise. An absence of viable and transparent investment vehicles in China, combined with the pragmatic risk-taking that’s characterized China’s economic development, seemingly convinced China’s leadership and its business class long-ago that its best bets should often be placed elsewhere. Chen Zhiwu , a professor of finance at Yale University's School of Management offered this advice to his compatriots back home  on Sina : “If the deadlock causes a U.S. bond default their financial markets will be a mess for one or two weeks and you should seize the opportunity to buy U.S. stock!” A fine sentiment. That is, as long as you aren’t scraping by to find an additional RMB 80 (US$12.40) to meet this month’s mortgage payment.
