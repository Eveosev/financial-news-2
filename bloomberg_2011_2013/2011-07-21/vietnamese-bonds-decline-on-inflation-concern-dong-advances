Vietnam ’s five-year bonds declined
for a second day on speculation inflation will accelerate and
interest rates will be increased. The dong gained.  It will be “very difficult” to slow inflation to 17 percent
by the end of this year, Ha Van Hien, head of the National
Assembly’s Committee for Economic Affairs, told the legislative
body today in Hanoi. The government is forecasting annual
inflation of 15 percent to 17 percent, according to a statement
posted on its website last month. Consumer prices jumped 20.8
percent in June from a year earlier, the fastest pace since
November 2008, official data showed June 24.  “Bonds yields gained as investors are concerned the
government will further tighten monetary policy and  interest
rates  will rise again,” said Vu Anh Duc, a Hanoi-based senior
fixed-income dealer at Vietnam Joint Stock Commercial Bank for
Industry and Trade.  The yield on five-year bonds rose two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 12.47 percent, according to a daily fixing
from banks compiled by Bloomberg. The dong gained 0.4 percent to
20,532 per dollar as of 1:51 p.m. in Hanoi, according to prices
from banks compiled by Bloomberg. That was the biggest daily
increase in a month.  The central bank set the reference rate at 20,608 today,
unchanged from yesterday. The currency is allowed to trade up to
1 percent on either side of the official rate.  --Nguyen Kieu Giang in Hanoi. Editors: Andrew Janes, Anil Varma  To contact the Bloomberg News Staff on this story:
