Bulgarian Deputy Prime Minister
 Simeon Djankov  sees his country’s entry into the euro area as
likely to come “somewhere around” 2015, he told Sky News in an
interview.  Bulgaria  meets the Maastricht criteria for joining the euro
and its entry would mean it could “instill more fiscal
discipline in the eurozone itself,” he said in the interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
