Sabine Lautenschlaeger, vice
president of  Germany ’s Bundesbank, said she is not convinced
that annual stress tests of banks can restore reassurance in
financial markets,  Boersen-Zeitung  said, citing an interview.  While Lautenschlaeger said she assumes that the European
Banking Authority will carry out stress tests of the region’s
lenders also next year or in 2013, she said she doesn’t believe
that the results should always be made public, the German
newspaper reported today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
