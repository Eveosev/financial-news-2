New South Wales,  Australia ’s most
populous state, said it is extending until the end of the year a
moratorium on the use of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, to
extract natural gas from coal seams.  A 60-day moratorium was due to end July 23, according to a
 statement  posted on the state government’s website today. The
use of certain chemicals in drilling will be banned, it said.
These are benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene -- known
collectively as BTEX.  “We’re acting by introducing these tougher conditions” on
coal-seam gas exploration in the state, Chris Hartcher, the
resources and energy minister for New South Wales, was cited as
saying in the statement.  Hydraulic fracturing, which injects water and chemicals
into rock formations to free trapped gas, has drawn criticism
from environmental groups and politicians who say it may
contaminate drinking water supplies.  France  outlawed the
technique on July 1, the first nation to do so.  To contact the reporter on this story:
