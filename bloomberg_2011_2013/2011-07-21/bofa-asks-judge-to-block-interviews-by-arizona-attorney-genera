Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  asked an
Arizona judge to bar state attorneys from interviewing former
bank employees in private as part of a lawsuit accusing the bank
of misleading mortgage borrowers.  Don Bivens , a lawyer representing the bank, told Superior
Court Judge  Arthur Anderson  in Phoenix that prosecutors must
allow bank attorneys to attend the interviews because the ex-
employees aren’t included in the lawsuit.  “The state can’t simply prove misrepresentation without
proof of who told what to whom, and these folks are at Ground
Zero,” Bivens said.  The state sued Bank of America last year, saying the bank
misled homeowners seeking loan modifications. The bank has
engaged in “widespread consumer fraud,” the attorney general
said in the complaint.  The state is seeking court approval of interviews with non-
management former employees without bank attorneys present so it
can investigate its case.  Arizona  Assistant Attorney General Carolyn Matthews argued
that since the lawsuit doesn’t allege any wrongdoing on the part
of the former employees, investigators may conduct “informal
interviews.”  “These are junior employees trying to carry out the
instructions of management,” said Matthews.  Anderson didn’t say when he will rule.  The case is Arizona v. Countrywide Financial Corp., CV2010-
033580, Arizona Superior Court, Maricopa County (Phoenix).  To contact the reporters on this story:
