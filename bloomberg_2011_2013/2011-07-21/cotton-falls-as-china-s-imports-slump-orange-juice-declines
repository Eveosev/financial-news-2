Cotton futures declined for the
second straight day as imports dropped in  China , the world’s
biggest consumer. Orange juice fell.  China’s customs data showed today that cotton imports slid
17 percent to 119,997 metric tons in June from May. Prices have
tumbled as much as 57 percent since reaching a record $2.197 a
pound on March 7 on waning demand.  “The market is nervous about the demand situation,” Peter Egli, the Chicago-based director of risk management at Plexus
Cotton Ltd., a U.K.-based merchant, said in a telephone
interview.  Cotton for December delivery fell 2.12 cents, or 2.1
percent, to settle at 98.63 cents at 2:47 p.m. on ICE Futures
U.S. in  New York . The price headed for the seventh consecutive
weekly drop. On July 18, the commodity touched 94.46 cents, the
lowest for a most-active contract since Sept. 16.  Orange-juice  futures for September delivery slid 2.6 cents,
or 1.3 percent, to $1.974 a pound in New York. The commodity has
gained 38 percent in the past year. On July 19, the price
reached $2.0265, the highest since March 21, 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
