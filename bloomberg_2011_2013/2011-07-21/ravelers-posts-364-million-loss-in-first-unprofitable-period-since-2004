Travelers Cos., the lone insurer in
the  Dow Jones Industrial Average , posted its first loss in seven
years as U.S. tornadoes fueled catastrophe claims that cost the
company more than Hurricane Katrina.  The second-quarter net loss of $364 million, or 88 cents
per share, compares with a profit of $670 million, or $1.35, a
year earlier, the insurer said today in a statement.  Chief Executive Officer Jay Fishman scaled back share
repurchases as catastrophe claims swelled for New York-based
Travelers. U.S. property-casualty insurers including  Allstate
Corp. (ALL)  and State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. took losses
on a U.S. tornado season that killed more than 150 people in
Joplin,  Missouri , and leveled parts of Tuscaloosa,  Alabama .  “There were two events that really produced the great
majority” of losses,  Mark Dwelle , an analyst at  RBC Capital
Markets , said in an interview before Travelers announced
earnings. “A lot of the losses were commercial, not just the
routine residential losses that we normally see.”  Catastrophes cost the company $1.67 billion before taxes in
the three months ended June 30, compared with $439 million a
year earlier. Travelers posted $1.52 billion in pretax losses in
the third quarter of 2005 on claims tied to Hurricanes Katrina
and Rita. Travelers writes the majority of its policies for
commercial customers.  Policy sales climbed 2.3 percent to $5.82 billion from
$5.69 billion on higher rates for some business clients,
including those buying workers’ compensation coverage.  Rate Increases  Insurers “have to make money from something,” said
Dwelle. “If you can’t make it from investments, you eventually
have to start working on price to start making it from
underwriting.”  Travelers climbed 63 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $57.69 at
4:15 p.m. in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading. The
insurer had said last month that it would post an operating loss
for the period. The company has gained 3.6 percent this year,
compared with the 9.9 percent rise in the 30-company Dow
average.  Travelers’ book value, a measure of assets minus
liabilities, fell to $59.62 per share from $59.91 at the end of
March as the company scaled back share repurchases to guard
capital. Fishman bought back $237 million in shares in the
quarter, compared with $1.4 billion in the same period in 2010.  Travelers lost 25 cents per premium dollar in the second
quarter, compared with a gain of 4.8 cents a year earlier on
increased catastrophe losses.  Storms in the U.S. contributed to
$14.7 billion in direct insured losses to property in the second
quarter, ISO, a unit of Verisk Analytics Inc., said June 22.  U.S. Tornadoes  “These losses for us were larger than those we incurred
from  Hurricane Katrina  in 2005 and the equivalent of losses we
would expect from a 1-in-100 year hurricane,” Fishman said in
the statement.  More than  1,600 tornadoes  have been reported this year,
compared with 1,282 in all of 2010, according to the  National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . The tornado that tore
through Joplin on May 22 was the single deadliest U.S. storm in
at least 60 years. Homes and businesses in Tuscaloosa were
flattened as tornadoes touched down in six states in the U.S.
Southeast on April 27.  Travelers booked a $168 million gain by withdrawing funds
from reserves after determining it had more money set aside than
needed for claims on policies sold in prior quarters. That
compares with a benefit of $384 million a year earlier.  Private Equity   Net investment income fell to $606 million after tax from
$617 million in the same period a year ago on lower returns from
fixed-income holdings. Alternative  investments , including
private-equity funds, real-estate partnerships and  hedge funds ,
produced an $84 million gain, compared with a gain of $58
million a year earlier.  Fishman, 58, avoided losses in 2008 and 2009 by keeping the
fixed-income portfolio in municipal bonds, as rivals such as
 American International Group Inc. (AIG)  posted losses on mortgage-
backed securities. Travelers held about $39 billion of municipal
debt as of June 30, according to a filing.  “It is encouraging that more states are dealing with their
own financial situations, building foundations for an improved
fiscal outlook,” Fishman said today on a call with investors.  State and local  government bonds  gained 4.5 percent in the
second quarter, including invested interest, their biggest
advance since the three months ended Sept. 30, 2009, according
to Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s Municipal Master Index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
