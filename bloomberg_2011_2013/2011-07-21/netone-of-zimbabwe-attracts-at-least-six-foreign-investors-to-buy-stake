NetOne,  Zimbabwe ’s state-owned
mobile-phone operator, has attracted interest from at least six
foreign investors to buy a stake in the company, said Reward Kangai, its managing director.  “In the last two weeks alone, we have received four
inquiries from foreign companies wishing to acquire a stake,”
Kangai said in a telephone interview today from Harare, the
capital.  Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI)  of India and  MTN Group Ltd. (MTN) ,
Africa’s biggest mobile-phone operator, have also been “in
contact” with the company, he said, declining to give more
details.  “At the moment we cannot announce anything as a result of
the non-disclosure agreements we have signed,” he said.  Zimbabwe agreed in March to allow foreign investment in
NetOne to help boost capital in the company. It needs to inject
as much as $100 million a year into its network to grow its
subscriber base and roll out a 3G network and data services,
Kangai said March 9. NetOne competes with  Econet Wireless
Zimbabwe Ltd. (ECWH) , the southern African country’s biggest operator,
and Telecel Zimbabwe, a unit of Orascom Telecom Holdings SAE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
