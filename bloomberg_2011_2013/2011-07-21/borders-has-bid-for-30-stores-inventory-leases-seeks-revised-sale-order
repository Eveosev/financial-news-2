Borders Group Inc., the bankrupt
bookstore chain, said it will seek approval of a revised sale
order after receiving a bid for inventory and leases at 30
stores.  Borders, scheduled to seek court approval today to
liquidate its 399 remaining stores, filed a revised sale order
last night in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in  New York . It didn’t name
the “non-insider” who bid for the stores, and said it will
need permission from its bankruptcy lenders to seek approval of
that sale.  “The debtors received a bid from a non-insider to purchase
the inventory, furniture, fixtures, equipment and leases for
approximately thirty (30) stores,” lawyers for the company
wrote.  Andrew K. Glenn, a lawyer for Borders, and  Bruce D.
Buechler , a lawyer for creditors, didn’t immediately reply to
calls and e-mails seeking comment.  Borders, based in  Ann Arbor , Michigan, has about 10,700
employees. It said earlier this week that it will close its
stores by September.  The case is In re Borders Group Inc., 11-10614,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New York ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
