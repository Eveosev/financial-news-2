Oil fell in  New York  for the first
day in three after a report showed  China ’s manufacturing may
have contracted in July.  Crude for September delivery slid as much as 0.3 percent
today after gaining as much as 0.4 percent. The contract was at
$98.11 a barrel, down 29 cents, in electronic trading on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange  at 11.01 a.m. Singapore time. It
earlier rose as much as 43 cents to $98.83 a barrel.    Preliminary data for a purchasing managers’ index by HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics showed the gauge fell to 48.9
this month from a final reading of 50.1 in June. The data
suggest China’s manufacturing contracted for the first time in a
year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
