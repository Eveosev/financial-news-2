Oil traded near the highest level in
one week in  New York  after jobless claims in the U.S. rose more
than forecast, weakening the dollar and making crude attractive
for protecting against inflation.  Futures for September delivery advanced as high as $98.83 a
barrel, reversing an earlier decline to $97.20, as the Labor
Department said that applications for jobless benefits in the
week ended July 16 increased by 10,000 to 418,000. The U.S.
currency dropped 0.5 percent to $1.42 against the euro, making
dollar-priced assets such as crude appear cheaper. Oil fell
earlier on signs of slower manufacturing in  China , the worldâ€™s
largest energy consumer.  Crude for September delivery was at $98.71 a barrel in
electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , up 31
cents, at 1:38 p.m. London time. It gained as much as 0.4
percent, having earlier tumbled 1.2 percent.  Brent oil for September settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange was at $118.04 a barrel, up 11 cents.  To contact the reporters on this story:
