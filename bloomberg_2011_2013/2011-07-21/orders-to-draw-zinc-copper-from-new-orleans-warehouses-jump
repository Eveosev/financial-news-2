Orders to draw zinc from warehouses
monitored by the London Metal Exchange surged for a second day
this week, on bookings in  New Orleans .  Canceled warrants, as the orders are known, rose 32,525
metric tons, or 47 percent, to 101,925 tons, exchange figures
showed today. That’s the highest level since April 19, 2006.
Bookings in New Orleans’ warehouses climbed 73 percent, rising
35,575 tons to 84,350 tons.  Total canceled warrants for zinc have risen 162 percent
this week, with a 988 percent increase in bookings at New
Orleans, home to 63 percent of zinc stockpiles, this week’s data
showed.  Earlier this month, the LME said it would raise the minimum
daily volume of metal that warehouses it monitors must deliver
to ease backlogs.  The increase in orders probably has more links to “plans
to reposition the stocks than it does to any new upturn in
industrial demand,” Duncan Hobbs, an analyst at Macquarie Group
Ltd., said July 19.  Copper canceled warrants advanced 1,775 tons in New
Orleans, bringing the number of canceled warrants for all metals
at the location to 105,650 tons. With the most recent
cancellations, obtaining metals from LME stocks in New Orleans
may now take longer.  Lead Times  At the minimum daily delivery rate of 1,500 tons set by the
LME, removing any metal from LME warehouses in New Orleans may
take as much as 14 weeks, according to Bloomberg calculations.
That’s up from nine weeks estimated by Hobbs earlier this week.  Zinc stockpiles increased 11,800 tons to 891,875 tons,
driven by increases in New Orleans, Baltimore and  Chicago .  Total copper canceled warrants rose 1,075 tons to 24,250
tons. Inventories rose 6,350 tons to 474,050 tons, led by gains
in Chicago. About 26 percent of total LME copper stockpiles are
located in New Orleans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
