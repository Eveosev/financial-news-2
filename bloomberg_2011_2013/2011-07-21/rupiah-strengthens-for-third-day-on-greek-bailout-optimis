Indonesia ’s rupiah traded near the
strongest level this week on optimism an agreement between the
leaders of France and  Germany  will break a deadlock over a Greek
bailout package, boosting demand for emerging-market assets.  Foreign funds increased their holdings of Indonesian
government debt by 2.9 percent this month through July 18 to
241.76 trillion rupiah ($28.3 billion), according to  debt
management office  data. German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and
French President Nicolas Sarkozy reached a “joint position on
 Greece ’s debt situation,” Merkel’s spokesman said, before a
summit today to stamp out contagion in European bond markets.  The agreement on Greece “is having a positive impact on
Asian currencies because that will increase risk appetite,”
said Ho Woei Chen, a Singapore-based economist at United
Overseas Bank Ltd. “Gains in the rupiah are in line with the
general sentiment on Asian currencies.”  The rupiah was little changed at 8,538 from 8,539 yesterday
against the dollar as of 3:20 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It earlier touched 8,528, the strongest
level since reaching 8,526 on July 18.  The currency has strengthened 5.2 percent this year as
overseas investors bought $2.5 billion more Indonesian shares
than they sold, exchange data show.  Government bonds  rose. The yield on the 8.25 percent
securities due July 2021 fell seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 7.25 percent, according to midday prices
from the Inter-Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
