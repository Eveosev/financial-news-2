The cost of protecting corporate
bonds from default in the U.S. fell for a third day, reaching
the lowest in two weeks after European officials detailed a plan
to provide  Greece  with aid to stop the region’s debt crisis.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, declined 2.3 basis points to a
mid-price of 92.3 basis points as of 5:23 p.m. in  New York , the
lowest since July 7, according to Markit Group Ltd.  The index, which decreases as investor confidence improves
and rises as it deteriorates, declined after European Union
leaders said they would provide a 160 billion euro ($230
billion) aid package for Greece and empowered their bailout fund
to buy the debt of stressed nations and offer emergency credit
lines.  “The tone has been generally good out of the meeting in
 Europe ,” said Noel Hebert, credit strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ
Securities USA in New York.  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meets its obligations, less that value of defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
