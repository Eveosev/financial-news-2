Maverick Capital Management LP, the
$11 billion investment firm run by  Lee Ainslie , is planning to
invest in start-up hedge fund managers as seeding grows in the
industry.  The hedge fund has allocated $22 million to Maverick Seed
Partners LP, according to a July 15 regulatory filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. Fraser Seitel, a spokesman
for New York-based Maverick, declined to comment.  Maverick is joining firms such as Blackstone Group LP,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Shumway Capital Partners LLC in
putting money with new managers in exchange for a share of fees
as institutional investors have focused on larger firms with
established track records. About $2.6 billion was available to
seed managers in the first half of the year, up from $1.3
billion in the second half of 2009, according to Acceleration
Capital Group, a New York-based firm that works with seed
investors.  The number of money managers seeking to raise cash for
 hedge funds  increased as banks started disbanding their
proprietary trading desks to comply with U.S. legislation that
restricts trading with their own money.  Goldman Sachs said it raised $158.1 million for its seeding
fund as of July 14, according to a regulatory filing.  Ed
Canaday , a spokesman for the New York-based bank, declined to
comment.  Ainslie, 47, started Maverick in 1993 after working for
 Julian Robertson ’s Tiger Management LLC for three years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
