England  is 127-2 at tea on the
opening day of the first cricket Test against India at Lordâ€™s in
London.  Jonathan Trott was 58 not out and Kevin Pietersen scored 22
before rain and bad light brought an early tea break.  Zaheer
Khan  took 2-18 for the visitors.  The match is the 2,000th in the 134 years of elite Test
cricket. England can overtake India as the top team in the
International Cricket Council rankings if it wins the four-match
series by two Tests or more.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
