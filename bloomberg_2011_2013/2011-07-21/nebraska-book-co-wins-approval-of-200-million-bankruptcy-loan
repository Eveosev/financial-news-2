(Corrects amount of unsecured notes in fifth paragraph of
story published July 21.)  Nebraska Book Co., an operator of a
nationwide chain of college bookstores, won court approval to
borrow as much as $200 million to help fund operations while in
bankruptcy.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Peter Walsh at a hearing today in
Wilmington,  Delaware , gave the company final permission to
borrow the money, after allowing it to receive $125 million on
the loan last month. A  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  unit is acting as
the agent for lenders. The financing includes a $125 million
 term loan  and a $75 million revolving facility.  The funds will allow Nebraska Bookâ€™s stores to acquire
textbooks and other supplies they need for the fall back-to-
school rush, which were historically obtained on credit from
vendors, the company said in court papers.  Nebraska Book reached an agreement on a restructuring with
holders of more than 95 percent of its 8.625 percent senior
subordinated notes and more than 75 percent of its 11 percent
discount notes. The bookseller said in a June 27 statement that
it will restructure about $450 million in debt of its parent,
NBC Acquisition Corp., and affiliates.  Noteholders will get control of the company under the
reorganization plan  Nebraska  Book formally filed this week.
Under the plan, $175 million in 8.625 percent senior
subordinated notes would be converted into 78 percent of the new
equity, $110 million in unsecured notes and a cash payment of
$30.6 million. Holders of the $77 million in 11 percent discount
notes would get the remaining 22 percent of the stock.  Paid in Full  Secured lenders, owed about $26.3 million, and secured
noteholders, owed about $200 million, would be paid in full with
cash.  The company, based in Lincoln, Nebraska, listed about
$657.2 million in assets and about $564 million in debt as of
Feb. 14, including the debt and assets of affiliates, in Chapter
11 documents filed June 27.  Nebraska Book currently has about 280 stores on and off
campuses. It also has one of the largest wholesale distribution
networks of used textbooks, supplying college bookstores with
more than 105,000 different titles and selling more than 6.3
million books a year.  The case is In re Nebraska Book Co. Inc., 11-12005,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
