Mitchells & Butlers Plc (MAB) , the U.K.
owner of Harvester and Toby Carvery pubs and restaurants, fell
to a 1 year low in London trading after saying sales growth
slowed during the last nine weeks of the year.  Mitchells & Butlers declined 2.9 percent to 282.4 pence at
the 4:30 p.m. close, the lowest price since July 5, 2010, giving
the company a market value of 1.16 billion pounds ($1.87
billion.)  The company said in a statement today that sales growth
slowed in the last nine weeks of the year and the “underlying
like-for-like growth trend has softened to around 1 percent.”
Last week the company said Bob Ivell is to become interim
chairman following the decision of Simon Burke to step down.
Burke was made chairman on Feb. 11, replacing John Lovering.  “We recommend selling the shares, not only because of
weakening trading, but also because of the unpredictability of
board changes,”  Paul Hickman , an analyst at Peel Hunt, said in
a note today. There was a “lack of explanation” for the board
changes, Hickman said.  Revenue at outlets open at least a year in the nine weeks
to July 16 rose 2.8 percent, compared with a 3.3 percent
increase in the 33 weeks to May 14, the Birmingham, England-
based company said in today’s statement.  “It surely can’t enhance investor confidence,” interim
Chief Executive Officer Jeremy Blood said in a phone interview
today. “I would like to tell them we have a more stable
situation on the board. It is an issue in investor’s minds. Is
it affecting business? In my view it isn’t.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
