Zambiaâ€™s planned hydroelectric power
plant will cost about $2 billion, from an earlier estimate of
$1.5 billion after factoring in the cost of borrowing,  Reuters 
said, citing a project document.  The construction of the 750-megawatt Kafue Gorge Lower
electricity plant by a venture between state power company Zesco
Ltd. and two Chinese companies started yesterday and is expected
to be completed by 2017, the news agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
