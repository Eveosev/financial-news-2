Swiss investor confidence dropped to
the lowest in more than two years in July as a worsening
European debt crisis and an appreciating franc clouded the
growth outlook.  An index of investor and analyst expectations, which aims
to predict economic developments six months in advance, fell to
minus 58.9 from minus 24.3 in June, the ZEW Center for European
Economic Research in Mannheim,  Germany , and Zurich-based  Credit
Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  said in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
