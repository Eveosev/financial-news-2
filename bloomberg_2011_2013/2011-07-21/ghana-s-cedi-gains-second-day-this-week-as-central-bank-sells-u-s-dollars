Ghana ’s cedi gained for a second day
this week against the dollar as traders said the central bank
sold the U.S. currency.  The currency of the world’s second-largest cocoa producer
appreciated as much as 0.07 percent to 1.5110 per dollar, before
trading 0.03 percent stronger at 1.5115 by 1:55 p.m. in Accra,
the capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The central bank sold dollars today,” Kofi Pianim, a
currency trader at the local unit of Standard Bank Group Ltd.
said in a telephone interview from Accra, declining to say how
much the  Bank of Ghana  sold.  Nobody was available to comment at the Bank of Ghana’s
treasury department, said a woman who answered a telephone at
the central and declined to be identified.  Cocoa futures traded up 0.2 percent at $3,188 a metric ton
