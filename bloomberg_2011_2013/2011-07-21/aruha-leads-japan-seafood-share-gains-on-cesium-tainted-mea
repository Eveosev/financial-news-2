Maruha Nichiro Holdings Inc. (1334)  and
Tohto Suisan Co. led gains by seafood companies in Tokyo after
the government said beef contaminated by radiation had been sold
to Japanese consumers.  Maruha Nichiro advanced 6.3 percent to 136 yen as of 12:36
p.m. on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, set for the biggest gain since
June 2009. Tohto Suisan surged 11 percent to 150 yen, the
second-steepest rise among 1,667 companies on the benchmark
Topix, which slipped 0.1 percent.  The government on July 19 banned beef shipments from areas
near the crippled Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant north of
Tokyo, after finding 637 cattle were fed hay contaminated by
radioactive cesium. Some beef from the cattle contained cesium
exceeding government standards and was sold to consumers, said
Kazuyuki Hashimoto, an official at the food-monitoring division
of the  Tokyo  metropolitan government.  Kyodo News yesterday reported contamination had spread,
with 148 cows fed contaminated straw shipped from a farm in
Shizuoka prefecture, south of Tokyo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
