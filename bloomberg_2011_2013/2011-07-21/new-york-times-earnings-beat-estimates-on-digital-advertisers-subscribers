New York Times Co. (NYT) , publisher of the
namesake newspaper, posted earnings that beat analysts’
estimates as digital-advertising sales increased and customers
signed on to a new online subscription model. The shares rose.  Earnings per share, excluding some items, fell to 14 cents
in the second quarter, the New York-based company said in a
statement today. That exceeded the average estimate from
analysts of 9 cents in a Bloomberg survey. Revenue fell 2.2
percent to $576.7 million. Analysts had projected $577.6
million.  “They’ve been right-sizing the business,” Derek Maupin,
an analyst at  Dallas , Texas-based Hodges Capital Management,
said in an interview. “As the big picture improves, you’ll see
them continue to stabilize.” Hodges owns about 100,000 Times
Co. shares.  Advertising revenue slid 4 percent, as digital-ad sales
rose 2.6 percent and print ad sales fell. Circulation revenue
was little changed compared with the year-earlier period.  The company reported a net loss of $119.7 million, or 81
cents a share, compared with a profit of $32 million, or 21
cents, a year earlier. The company had an expense of $161.3
million for writing down the value of assets at the News Media
Group division.  With news consumers shifting from print to digital
platforms, Times Co. in March introduced a Web-based
subscription model at the  New York  Times, which requires online
readers who view more than 20 articles per month to pay for
access to the site’s content. Times Co. said it had 224,000
subscribers for the new service at the end of the quarter.  Times Co. climbed 17 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $9.14 at
4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
stock has declined 6.7 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
