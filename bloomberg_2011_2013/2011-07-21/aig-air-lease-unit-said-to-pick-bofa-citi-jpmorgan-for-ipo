American International Group Inc. (AIG) ’s
plane-leasing unit chose  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , Citigroup Inc.
and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  to lead a planned initial public
offering, a person familiar with the plans said.  The IPO from International Lease Finance Corp. may raise $2
billion and be completed as early as the third quarter, said the
person, who declined to be identified because the discussions
are private. The U.S. Treasury Department, AIG’s biggest
shareholder, will need to approve the hiring of the
underwriters, the person said.  Kerrie McHugh, a spokeswoman for Bank of America, declined
to comment as did Jennifer Zuccarelli of JPMorgan. Mark Costiglio, a spokesman for Citigroup, and Mark Herr, a spokesman
for AIG, declined to comment.  The Wall Street Journal reported ILFC’s choice of banks
earlier today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
