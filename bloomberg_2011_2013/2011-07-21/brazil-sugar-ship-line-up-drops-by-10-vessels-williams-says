As many as 58 ships were waiting to
load sugar at  Brazil ’s ports in the Center South, the country’s
main producing region, 10 fewer than a week earlier, according
to data from shipping agency Williams Servicos Maritimos Ltda.  The vessels were waiting at the ports of Santos and
Paranagua to load about 1.94 million metric tons of the
sweetener as of yesterday. On July 13, 68 vessels were waiting
to load about 2.32 million tons, Williams Brasil data showed.  Sugar output in Brazil, the world’s largest producer and
exporter, dropped almost 19 percent from the start of the
