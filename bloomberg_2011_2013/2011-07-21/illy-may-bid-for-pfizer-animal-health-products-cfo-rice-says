Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY) , whose top-selling
antipsychotic drug Zyprexa faces generic competition in October,
said it may bid for veterinary products being sold by  Pfizer Inc. (PFE)   Lilly, which had $1.39 billion in sales from animal-health
products last year, is monitoring Pfizerâ€™s plans to divest its
unit, Chief Financial Officer Derica Rice said in a conference
call with investors today. The Indianapolis-based drugmaker will
pursue any assets it deems of interest, Rice said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
