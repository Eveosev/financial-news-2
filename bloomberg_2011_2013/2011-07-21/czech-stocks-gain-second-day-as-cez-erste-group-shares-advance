The Czech Republic’s benchmark stock
climbed the most this month, led by  CEZ AS (CEZ)  and  Erste Group Bank
AG (EBS) , amid reports that European Union officials have come up with
a plan to prevent  Greece ’s credit crisis from spreading.  The PX gauge rose 1.4 percent, the most since June 29, to
1,210.3 at its 4:28 p.m. close in Prague. CEZ, the biggest Czech
power utility, surged the most in more than a year, rising 3.6
percent to 878 koruna. Austria’s Erste added 2.7 percent. The
two stocks have a combined 40 percent weighting in the index.  Global stocks and the euro rallied as European leaders
discussed easing the terms on bailouts to cash-strapped nations,
buying bonds from investors and helping countries recapitalize
banks. Spanish, Greek and Italian 10-year bonds rose after
German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President  Nicolas
Sarkozy  earlier agreed on a joint position to solve Greece’s
crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
