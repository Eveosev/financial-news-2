Mundial SA Produtos de Consumo
plummeted in  Sao Paulo  as investors retreated from bets that the
Brazilian consumer-products maker would be bought.  Mundial dropped 24 percent to 1.90 reais at 4:15 p.m. New
York time, for a two-day loss of 63 percent.  The stock had jumped seven-fold since the end of May to
5.11 reais on July 19 amid speculation it was an acquisition
target. The advance pushed its valuation as high as 133.9 times
reported profit, compared to a ratio of 9.7 for the benchmark
Bovespa index, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “At some point you have to stop and think if a gain as big
as the one Mundial has posted lately can be explained by the
actual performance by the company,” Leandro Martins, an analyst
at Sao Paulo-based brokerage Walpires SA, said in a telephone
interview. “It’s not a big shock that a stock that gained so
much in such a short period of time eventually falls hard.”  Mundial Chief Executive Officer Michael Lenn Ceitlin said
June 15 the company hadn’t received any takeover proposal. Zilma
Amorim, an investor relations coordinator for the company,
reiterated that in a July 19 e-mail.  “At the moment, there isn’t the slightest possibility of
the company being sold,” Amorim wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
