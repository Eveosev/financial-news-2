Five South Korean flour producers
bought a total of 30,000 metric tons of wheat from Eastern
 Australia , the first purchase from the region, as buyers seek
cheaper alternatives to U.S. supplies.  Importers including  CJ CheilJedang Corp. (097950)  and Daehan Flour
Mills Co. bought the cargo from GrainCorp Ltd. at $317.5 a ton
on a cost and freight basis, said two industry executives who
took part in a tender yesterday. The grain is for shipment
between late July and early August, they said, asking not to be
identified as the information is confidential.  The flour makers may increase purchases from Eastern
Australia as the grain from the region was cheaper than the U.S.
and Western Australian crops, the executives said. South Korea,
which imports almost all its wheat requirements, meets almost
half the needs from the U.S., with some 45 percent from
Australia and the rest from  Canada .  To contact the reporter on this story:
