Refined-copper imports by  China 
rebounded in June for the first time in three months, gaining 20
percent as buyers in the world’s biggest user started to
replenish stockpiles after the local market tightened.  Inbound shipments totaled 178,638 metric tons last month,
compared with 149,235 tons in May, according to Bloomberg News
calculations based on data provided by the General
Administration of Customs. Exports fell for a second month,
slumping to 3,065 tons from 20,175 tons in May.  Inventories in China have fallen by about a half from March
as imports in the first six months declined 30 percent from a
year ago. Copper in London climbed to a three-month high on July
19 on expectation of further Chinese buying in the second half.  “We expect a gradual recovery of Chinese imports in the
second half of this year,” Xiao Jing, an analyst at Beijing
Capital Futures Co., said. Still, “the high price now and the
negative arbitrage in the past month may keep the July and
August shipments relatively subdued.”  Copper stockpiles at Shanghai Futures Exchange-monitored
warehouses totaled 109,461 tons last week, 38 percent lower than
this year’s high of 177,365 tons in mid-March. Bonded warehouse
inventories fell to 300,000 tons to 350,000 tons from 600,000
tons in March, said Macquarie Group Ltd. analyst Duncan Hobbs on
July 19.  Copper for delivery in three months on the  London  Metal
Exchange dropped 0.2 percent to $9,740 a ton at 2:35 p.m.
Shanghai time. It reached $9,873.50 a ton this week, the highest
level since April 11.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
