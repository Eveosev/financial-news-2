Most Asian stocks fell, dragging the
regional benchmark index toward its first loss in three days, as
Korean technology companies reported lower profits and as a deal
to prevent a U.S.-debt default remained elusive.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropped 0.2 percent to 136.57
at 11:45 a.m. in  Tokyo , with five stocks falling for every three
that climbed.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
