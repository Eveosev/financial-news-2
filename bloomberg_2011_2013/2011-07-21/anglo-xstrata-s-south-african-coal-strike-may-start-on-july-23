(Corrects date in headline and first paragraph.)  South Africa’s Chamber of Mines,
which represents most mining companies in the country, expects a
strike by 30,000 coal workers at companies including  Anglo
American Plc (AAL)  and  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  to start on the night of July 24,
Frans Barker, a negotiator for the group, said in an e-mailed
response to questions today.  The Chamber hasn’t got formal notice of the strike yet, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
