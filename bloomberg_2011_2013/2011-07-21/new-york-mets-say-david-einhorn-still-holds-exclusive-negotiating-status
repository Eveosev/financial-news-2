David Einhorn , the hedge-fund
manager who offered $200 million for a 33 percent stake in the
 New York Mets , still holds exclusive negotiating rights with the
Major League Baseball team, the club said.  The New York Daily News reported yesterday that Einhorn, of
Greenlight Capital Inc., had competition from three other
bidders, including Ray Bartoszek, a former commodities trader
with Glencore International Plc. Bartoszek first inquired about
buying the team in April. The Daily News didn’t say where it got
the information.  “We are in exclusive negotiations with David Einhorn and
continue to have positive and productive discussions regarding
David’s ongoing interest in an investment in the Mets,” the
team said last night in an e-mailed statement.  The owners of the Mets decided to offer a minority share of
the team to defray costs from a $1 billion lawsuit filed by
 Irving Picard , the trustee representing investors who lost money
in Bernard Madoff’s Ponzi scheme. Team co-owner Fred Wilpon said
the Mets also may lose $70 million this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
