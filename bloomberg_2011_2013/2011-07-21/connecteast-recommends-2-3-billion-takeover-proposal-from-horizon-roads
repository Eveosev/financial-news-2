ConnectEast Group (CEU) , which runs the
EastLink toll road in  Australia ’s Victoria state, recommended
shareholders accept a takeover bid from Horizon Roads that
values the company at about A$2.2 billion ($2.4 billion).  Horizon Roads, managed by ConnectEast’s largest shareholder
CP2, will offer 55 Australian cents per share, ConnectEast said
in a statement to the stock exchange.  CP2  owns 35 percent of
ConnectEast, it said. The offer represents a 22.2 percent
premium to ConnectEast’s last closing price, according to the
statement.  Shareholders who don’t accept the cash offer may elect to
receive securities in an unlisted registered management
investment plan, allowing them to retain an indirect investment
in ConnectEast, the  company  said.  ConnectEast’s shares have gained 5.9 percent this year and
closed at 45 cents yesterday.  CP2 is an Australian-owned infrastructure fund manager,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter for this story:
