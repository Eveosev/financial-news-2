  Uganda ’s shilling fell to its
lowest level against the dollar in more than a week as companies
bought the U.S. currency to finance the import of raw materials.  The currency of  Africa ’s second-biggest coffee producer
declined as much as 0.2 percent to 2,600.50 per dollar at 3 p.m.
in the capital, Kampala, the lowest level since July 13. The
shilling closed at 2,595 yesterday.  The shilling fell because of “manufacturers who were on
the buy side,” Faisal Bukenya, a trader at the Ugandan unit of
Barclays Bank Plc, said in an interview from Kampala.  The Ugandan currency is the world’s second-worst performer
over the past month, after  Serbia ’s dinar, having declined 4.2
percent against the dollar, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The shilling has weakened as inflation accelerated to
a 17-year-high of 16 percent in May, before slowing to 15.8
percent last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
