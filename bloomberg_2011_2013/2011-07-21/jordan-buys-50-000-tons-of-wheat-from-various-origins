Jordan bought 50,000 metric tons of
wheat from various origins in a tender for 100,000 tons which
closed yesterday, an official at the Ministry of Industry and
Trade said.  The quantity was bought at $293 a ton, Mohamad Malahmeh,
head of the ministry’s tenders department, said by telephone
today. “The wheat comes from  Russia , Ukraine, Bulgaria, Romania,
the U.S., European Union,  Australia ,  Canada , Argentina and
Brazil,” he said.  Jordan has also issued a tender closing July 27 for 100,000
metric tons of barley. The tender was reissued as the prices
were too high, Malahmeh said. It was originally issued June 20
and closed July 7.  The country bought 150,000 metric tons of wheat, including
50,000 tons from Russia at $289.90 a ton, Malahmeh said July 7.
The remaining quantity was bought at between $289.90 a ton and
$290.90 a ton from origins including the U.S., the European
Union, Canada, Ukraine and Argentina, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
