National Football League owners
voted to accept a new collective bargaining agreement with its
players and re-open its business, pending approval by the NFL
Players Association, Commissioner  Roger Goodell  said at a news
conference in Atlanta.  The NFL, the U.S.’s most-watched and richest sports league,
locked out its players in March after negotations failed to
produce an agreement before the previous one expired.  To contact the reporter on this story:
