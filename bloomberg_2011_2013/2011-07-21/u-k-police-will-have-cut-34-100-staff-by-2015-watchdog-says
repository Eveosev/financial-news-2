British police are on course to cut
34,100 jobs between 2010 and 2015 as government austerity
measures bite, taking the workforce back to its 2003 level,
according to the body that monitors their performance.  Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary said in a  report
published  in  London  today that a third of the cuts had already
been made by March of this year. Just under half of the jobs
lost will be police officers, with the rest support and
administrative staff.  The reductions will save 1.6 billion pounds ($2.6 billion),
and forces are aiming to protect frontline officers, whose
numbers will fall only 2 percent by March 2012.  The opposition  Labour Party ’s Home Affairs spokeswoman,
 Yvette Cooper , called the cuts “an irresponsible gamble with
crime and public safety.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
