The likelihood of  Hungary ’s central
bank cutting its key interest rate this year has increased after
“the economic background deteriorated” globally and at home,
and domestic inflation slowed, according to  Societe Generale  SA.  Forward-rate agreements fixing three-month interest costs
in six months’ time will probably decline to 5.7 percent from
6.06 percent, the French lender wrote in a report to clients
dated today.  “We cannot rule out a case whereby the National Bank of
Hungary may cut its policy rate in late” 2011, Societe Generale
wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
