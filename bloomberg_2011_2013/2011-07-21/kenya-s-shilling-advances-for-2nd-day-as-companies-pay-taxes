Kenya ’s shilling strengthened for a
second day as companies bought the currency to meet tax
obligations.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy and the
world’s largest exporter of black tea appreciated as much as 0.5
percent to 89.81 per dollar, and last traded up 0.2 percent at
90.04 as of 1:13 p.m. in Nairobi. The currency has lost 0.8
percent versus the dollar so far in July.  “The shilling is riding on the existing tight liquidity
situation in the market further created by the settlement of tax
obligations by business and we expect it to trade within the
89.80-90.05 band as we head into the weekend,” Duncan Kinuthia,
head of trading at Commercial Bank of Africa Ltd., said in a
phone interview from the capital today.  The shilling has depreciated 10 percent versus the dollar
so far this year, touching a 17-year low of 91.58 per dollar on
June 21, as inflation accelerated to 13 percent from 3.2 percent
in October, shaking investor confidence. The central bank cut
 interest rates  to a record low in January, before raising them
by a total of a half a percentage point at the following two
monetary policy meetings in March and May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
