Residual-fuel inventories in
Singapore,  Asia ’s biggest oil-trading and storage center,
climbed 12 percent to the highest in three weeks, according to a
unit of the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Supplies including  fuel oil  and low-sulfur waxy residue and
excluding bitumen increased 2.18 million barrels in the week to
yesterday to 19.7 million,  International Enterprise Singapore 
said today in an e-mailed statement.  Onshore stockpiles of light distillates dropped 317,000
barrels, or 3.3 percent, to 9.4 million, a five-week low.
Middle-distillate stockpiles including gasoil, or diesel, and
kerosene decreased 243,000 barrels, or 1.5 percent, to 15.6
million. That’s the lowest in three weeks.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
