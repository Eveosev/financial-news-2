Philippine 10-year bond yields
dropped to the lowest level since April and the peso rose to an
eight-month high after the  International Monetary Fund  said the
pace of economic growth will attract overseas capital.  The near-term outlook for the  Philippines  is favorable,
International Monetary Fund mission chief Vivek Arora said in an
e-mail yesterday. The peso has appreciated 2.8 percent this year
as funds based abroad bought $605 million more local equities
than they sold, exchange data show. The  budget deficit  in the
first half of the year was below the government’s upper limit,
the Philippine Daily Inquirer reported today, citing Budget
Secretary Florencio Abad.  “The markets are bullish because of the positive news
flow,” said Dave Estacio, a senior fixed-income trader at First
Metro Investment Corp. in Manila. “The budget has stayed below
ceiling.”  The yield on the 7.375 percent bonds due March 2021 fell
seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 6.13 percent,
the lowest level since April 29, according to Tradition
Financial Services. The peso rose 0.2 percent to 42.618 per
dollar as of the 4 p.m. close in  Manila , according to Tullett
Prebon Plc. It touched 42.570 earlier, the strongest since
November.  The economy expanded 7.6 percent last year, the fastest
pace since at least 1999, official data show. Growth may average
5 percent in 2011 and 2012, the IMF’s Arora said.  The Daily Inquirer reported the latest estimates indicate a
budget deficit that was lower than 150 billion pesos ($3.5
billion) for the January through June period, citing Abad. The
target ceiling for the first half is 152 billion pesos, it said.  To contact the reporter for this story:
