The following companies had unusual
price changes in  Mexico  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 4 p.m. New York time.  The IPC index rose 0.6 percent at 35,555.83 after falling
as much as 0.5 percent.  Gruma SAB (GRUMAB MM), the largest maker of corn flour for
tortillas in Mexico, gained 2.3 percent to 24.51 pesos as
companies that benefit from increased imports rallied on a
report that European Union officials may implement a plan to
help banks hurt by the region’s sovereign-debt crisis. The U.S.
and  Europe  accounted for 47 percent of Gruma’s 2010 sales.  Grupo Carso SAB (GCARSOA1 MM), the holding company
controlled by billionaire  Carlos Slim  with subsidiaries in
retail, construction and industrial materials, advanced 3.1
percent to 35.89 pesos after euro-area leaders signaled they may
ease bailout terms to countries struggling with sovereign-debt,
halting a surge in bond yields and reversing an early decline in
Mexican equities.  Grupo Modelo SAB (GMODELOC MM), the Mexican brewer of
Corona beer, rose 1.1 percent to 72.36 pesos. Modelo has
increased exports as U.S. sales rose 4.4 percent in the 13 weeks
ended July 3, higher than a 1.7 percent gain for all imported
beers and a decline of 0.9 percent for the U.S. beer industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
