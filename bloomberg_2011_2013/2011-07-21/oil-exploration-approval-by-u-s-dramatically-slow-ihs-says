The Obama administration is
“dramatically” slow after lifting a drilling ban in approving
offshore oil exploration, limiting the nation’s ability to
increase domestic energy output, IHS Inc. said.  The  Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and
Enforcement  in six months since the moratorium was lifted
approved about 85 percent fewer exploration and development
plans for the  Gulf of Mexico  than the average from 2005 to 2010,
according to the report today by Englewood, Colorado-based IHS.  “The pace of plan and permit approvals is significantly
below historical norms,” the report said. “A sustained
slowdown in the Gulf of Mexico is already having a negative
impact on  job creation  and domestic oil production, and will do
so even more in 2012.”  Following BP’s record offshore spill last year, drilling
was banned until October.  Noble Energy Inc. (NBL)  won the first
drilling permit after the industry demonstrated in February the
ability to contain future offshore oil discharges.  To contact the reporter on this story:
