Housing Finance Ltd.,  Kenya ’s only
publicly traded mortgage lender, jumped the most in a week after
reporting first-half profit surged 70 percent.  The stock of the company jumped 2.4 percent to 21 shillings
as of 1 p.m. in the capital, Nairobi, the biggest intraday gain
since July 13.  Net income climbed to 241.6 million shillings ($2.68
million) in the six months through June, from 141.8 million
shillings a year earlier, the Nairobi-based company said in a
statement e-mailed by the city’s stock exchange yesterday. Net
interest income, what banks earn making loans, increased 35
percent to 896.3 million shillings, Housing Finance said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
