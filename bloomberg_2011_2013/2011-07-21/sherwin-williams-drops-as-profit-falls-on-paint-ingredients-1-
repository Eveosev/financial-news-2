Sherwin-Williams Co. (SHW) , the largest
U.S. paint retailer, fell the most in 21 months after second-
quarter profit unexpectedly dropped and the company cut its
full-year profit forecast because of rising raw material costs.  Sherwin-Williams declined $3.83, or 4.5 percent, to $81 at
4:01 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. It was
the largest drop since Oct. 20, 2009.  Net income decreased 1.4 percent to $179.1 million from
$181.7 million a year earlier, Cleveland-based Sherwin-Williams
said in a statement today. The company was expected to report
profit of $187.8 million, the average of seven analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Sherwin-Williams’s results were at the low end of the
company’s guidance because costs for paint ingredients are
outpacing price increases, Chief Executive Officer Christopher M. Connor said in the statement.  Sherwin-Williams’s price increases have lagged behind a 20
percent surge in raw material costs, particularly titanium
dioxide and acrylic acid, Don Carson, a New York-based analyst
at Susquehanna Financial Group, said in a report today.  “Prices still need to rise another 9 to 10 percent in
order to offset” rising costs, Carson wrote.  “Our operating segments continue to control costs and
implement price increase in an effort to keep pace with rising
raw material costs,” Connor said in the statement.  Per-share profit for the second quarter rose to $1.66 from
$1.64 a year earlier, after the company reduced the amount of
publicly traded stock.  Full-year profit will be $4.65 to $4.85 a share, the
company said, lowering the upper range from $5.05 forecast on
April 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
