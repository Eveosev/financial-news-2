The euro advanced to the highest
level in two weeks against the dollar as European officials
eased the terms of loans for cash-strapped nations and expanded
aid for Greece, reducing contagion concern.  The dollar dropped to its lowest level against the yen
since March as White House spokesman  Jay Carney  and House
Speaker  John Boehner  said there is no deal on raising the U.S.
debt limit. The Swiss franc fell against most of its major
counterparts on reduced safety demand as leaders agreed to
guarantee Greek bonds in money market operations if a bailout
agreement triggers a default.  “There’s enough good news in here to justify the rally
that we’ve had today,” said  David Mann , regional head of
research for the Americas at Standard Chartered Plc in New York.
“They’ve brought it back from going down one of the worst-case-
scenario paths, but we’re not fully out of the woods yet.”  The euro gained 1.5 percent to $1.4425 at 5 p.m. in  New
York , from $1.4215 yesterday, after touching $1.4435, the
highest level since July 6. The euro climbed 0.9 percent to
112.94 yen, from 111.99. The dollar dropped 0.6 percent to 78.30
yen and touched 78.29, the lowest level since the Group of Seven
intervened to weaken the currency following the March 11
earthquake and tsunami.  Sarkozy on Euro  French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  reiterated support for the
euro after the summit closed, saying it’s an “irreplaceable”
achievement of  Europe . He compared the transformation of the
bailout to the creation of a “European Monetary Fund.”  The Swiss franc, considered a haven in times of financial
turmoil, declined 0.9 percent to 1.1756 versus the euro,
compared with the record high 1.1374 reached July 18. The franc
gained 0.6 percent to 81.52 centimes versus the dollar.  Treasury 10-year notes fell, pushing the yield up nine
basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 3.01 percent on
reduced demand for a refuge in  U.S. government debt . The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 1.4 percent.  The region’s 440 billion euro ($633 billion) European
Financial Stability Facility will operate in the secondary
markets, aid troubled banks and offer credit lines, European
Union leaders said today after the summit.  “The EFSF coming into the secondary market will mean a
tightening of yields between the periphery and core,” said
 Sebastien Galy , a senior foreign-exchange strategist at Societe
Generale SA in  London . “It will also mean that the ability of
the market to push yields to the level where the deficit in a
country becomes unsustainable is greatly reduced. Countries
don’t have to fight against a giant.”  Spanish Bonds  Yields on 10-year Spanish bonds dropped 25 basis points to
5.73 percent after reaching 6.368 percent on July 18, the
highest level since 1997. The Italian 10-year bond yields fell
26 basis points to 5.34 percent, narrowing the yield spread with
bunds. Greek notes of the same maturity decreased 85 basis
points to 16.49 percent.  Leaders pledged a total 160 billion euro aid package for
 Greece , paid in part by private bondholders, and eased the terms
of its loans. Similar provisions will be made to the loans of
Portugal and Ireland, they said.  Intercontinental Exchange Inc.’s Dollar Index, which tracks
the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S. trading
partners, dropped as much as 1.2 percent to 73.889, the lowest
level since June 9.  Reports ‘False’  Carney, the White House spokesman, and Boehner responded to
a New York Times story today that the two sides were close to a
major deal. Boehner, an Ohio Republican, said in a Twitter
message that reports of a deal were “false.” Office of
Management and Budget Director Jack Lew, leaving a briefing with
Senate Democrats, said, “There is no agreement.”  A bipartisan group of senators called the Gang of Six
outlined a $3.7 trillion deficit-reduction plan, which Obama
embraced this week. Some Republicans have endorsed it or
signaled openness to considering it.  Norway’s krone gained 1.8 percent to 5.3987 versus the
greenback as crude oil rose, while  Canada ’s dollar appreciated
0.4 percent to 94.33 cents versus the U.S. currency after
touching 94.23 cents, the strongest level since November 2007.
Crude oil for September delivery climbed 1 percent to $99.13 a
barrel in New York trading.  China  should let the yuan gain to boost demand and global
economic stability, according to the  International Monetary
Fund , citing the risk that growth shocks in the country will
hurt the world.  Currency appreciation combined with reforms to rebalance
the Chinese economy “would yield substantial benefits,” the
fund said in a statement yesterday in  Washington . A “major
disruption in China’s so-far steady growth would have material
adverse consequences,” IMF directors said.  China disputed the assessment as the currency rose today in
 Shanghai  to 6.4509, a 17-year high, on the sixth anniversary of
the scrapping of a peg to the dollar.  To contact the reporters on this story:
