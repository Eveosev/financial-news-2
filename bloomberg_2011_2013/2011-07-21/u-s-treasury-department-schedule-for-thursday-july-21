The following is a reformatted
version of the U.S. Treasury Department’s daily release on the
schedule for Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and other officials:  On Thursday morning, Secretary Geithner will meet with New
Zealand Prime Minister John Key at Blair House. There will be a
photo spray at the bottom of the meeting.  At 10:00 a.m. EDT on Thursday, Deputy Secretary Wolin will
testify before the Senate Banking Committee on “Enhanced
Oversight After the Financial Crisis: The Wall Street Reform Act
at One Year.” His testimony will focus on how Dodd-Frank’s core
reforms are strengthening the safeguards for consumers and
investors, and providing the necessary tools for limiting risk
in the financial markets. These reforms are vital to restoring
trust in the financial markets and rebuilding a pro-growth, pro-
investment financial system. This hearing, which will be held at
the Dirksen Senate Office Building, is open press.  In the afternoon, the Secretary will meet with the
President and the Vice President at the White House. This
meeting is closed press.  Later in the afternoon, the Secretary will attend the Vice
President’s barbecue for members of the Cabinet at the Naval
Observatory. This event is closed press.  To contact the reporter on this story:
