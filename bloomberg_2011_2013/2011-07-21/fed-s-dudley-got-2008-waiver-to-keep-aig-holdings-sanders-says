The Federal Reserve Bank of New

financial holdings of  American International Group Inc. (AIG)  after
the company received a Fed rescue, a U.S. senator said.  Dudley, who was the New York Fed’s markets-group chief at
the time and is now the bank’s president, is the senior New York
Fed official identified in a Government Accountability Office
report today as receiving the waiver, Senator  Bernard Sanders , a
Vermont Independent, said today in a statement. Jack Gutt, a New
York Fed spokesman, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
