Wheat futures fell the most this
month on signs that demand is easing for supplies from the U.S.,
the world’s largest exporter, as competing producers boost
output and offer lower prices.  Net U.S. sales to foreign buyers in the week ended July 14
fell 22 percent from a week earlier to 403,528 metric tons, the
fewest since the end of May, the Department of Agriculture said
today. Russia may export 18 million tons in the year that
started July 1  after halting shipments during a drought last
year, the country’s agriculture minister said. This year’s crop
may be 48 percent larger than 2010.  “Russian business is more competitive than us,”  Tom Leffler , the owner of Leffler Commodities LLC in Augusta,
 Kansas , said in a telephone interview. “That’s not good,
because we have so much wheat, that we need to export some.”  Wheat futures for September delivery fell 19.75 cents, or
2.8 percent, to settle at $6.7725 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade, the biggest decline for a most-active
contract since June 30. The price has dropped 15 percent this
year.  Futures gained in the two previous days on concern that hot
weather in the U.S. and heavy rain in the European Union would
diminish global crops.  Russia removed its export ban on grains on July 1 after the
worst drought in 50 years cut production last year. Last week,
 Egypt  said it bought 180,000 tons of Russian wheat in a tender.  Wheat is the fourth-largest U.S. crop, valued at $13
billion in 2010, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
