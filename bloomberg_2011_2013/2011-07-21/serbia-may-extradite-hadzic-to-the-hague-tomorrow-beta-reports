Serbia will likely extradite Goran Hadzic, the last top commander sought by the International
Criminal Tribunal for the former  Yugoslavia , to The Hague
tomorrow, Beta News Agency reported, quoting his lawyer Toma
Fila.  Hadzic, who was arrested yesterday, will be extradited
after meeting with his family, Fila said, according to the news
service. Fila said yesterday his client won’t appeal a court
ruling that paved the way for his transfer to the Netherlands.  The leader of Serbs in Croatia during Yugoslavia’s violent
breakup in the 1990s, is accused of killing hundreds of Croats,
including more than 250 prisoners in Vukovar. He faces 14 counts
of  war crimes  and crimes against humanity at the tribunal in The
Hague.  To contact the reporter on this story:
