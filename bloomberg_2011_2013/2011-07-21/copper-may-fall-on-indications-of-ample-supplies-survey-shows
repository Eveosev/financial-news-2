Copper may fall as plentiful
inventories of the metal and a wider discount for scrap signal
ample supplies, a survey showed.  Seven of 13 analysts, investors and traders surveyed by
Bloomberg, or 54 percent, said prices will drop next week. Six
predicted a gain. Copper for three-month delivery was up 0.1
percent for this week at $9,682 a metric ton by 5 p.m. yesterday
on the London Metal Exchange.  Stockpiles tracked by the LME rose 36 percent from the 2010
low in December as of yesterday. Scrap, or recycled, copper has
been trading at a discount of 60 cents a pound to New York
prices, said Mark Lewon, president of recycler Utah Metal Works
Inc. That compares with 39 to 40 cents last week.  “This is a clear indication that there is no shortage of
copper out there,” Lewon said by e-mail from  Salt Lake City .
Demand is “weak” and  China , the world’s biggest consumer, is
buying only limited amounts of scrap, he said.  The red bars on the attached chart are derived by
subtracting bearish forecasts from bullish estimates, with
readings below zero signaling the majority of respondents expect
a decline. The green line shows the copper price. The survey
data shown are as of July 15.  The weekly copper survey has forecast prices accurately in
70 of the past 146 weeks, or 48 percent of the time.  This week’s survey results: Bullish: 6 Bearish: 7 Hold: 0  To contact the reporter on this story:
