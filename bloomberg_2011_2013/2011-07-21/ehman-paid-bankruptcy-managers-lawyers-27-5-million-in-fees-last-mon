Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) , whose
fees to advisers have exceeded $1.3 billion during its
bankruptcy, paid lawyers and managers $27.5 million in June.  Restructuring firm Alvarez & Marsal LLC, whose co-founder
 Bryan Marsal  runs the defunct investment bank, received $451
million in fees for 33 1/2 months of “interim management,”
including $9 million last month, according to a filing with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Weil, Gotshal & Manges
LLP, based in New York, whose fees through June were $319
million for acting as Lehman’s lead bankruptcy law firm, also
collected $9 million in June.  Kimberly Macleod, a Lehman spokeswoman, didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  Marsal, who bills Lehman hourly, ended a fight for control
of the firm’s $65 billion liquidation by taking some potential
payments from bondholders including hedge fund Paulson & Co. to
give to derivatives creditors such as  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) 
The chief executive officer has said holders of $100 billion in
claims now support his liquidation plan.  Marsal has said he aims to raise $65 billion by selling the
defunct company’s assets in the next few years to pay estimated
claims of more than $300 billion. He will start distributing
some cash by next year, or more than three years after the
September 2008 bankruptcy filing, he has said.  June Cash  Lehman and its affiliates reported cash and investments of
$24.4 billion on June 30, compared with $23.5 billion on May 31.
Of the June total, $2.6 billion was unavailable for use,
according to the filing.  The Lehman parent’s bankruptcy in  Manhattan  became the most
expensive in U.S. history in April 2010, when it topped the $757
million cost of energy trader Enron Corp.’s three-year
liquidation, according to data compiled by  Lynn LoPucki , a
bankruptcy-law professor at the University of California,  Los
Angeles .  Lehman’s creditors range from banks and hedge funds to the
New York Giants and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, as well as
individuals who hold Lehman bonds. Once the world’s fourth-
biggest investment bank, Lehman filed for bankruptcy on Sept.
15, 2008, with assets of $639 billion.  The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
