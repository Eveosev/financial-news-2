Germany â€™s army wastes billions of
euros on maintaining an oversized vehicle fleet, the
 Handelsblatt  said, citing a report of the Federal Audit Office
sent to lawmakers.  The army runs 72,000 vehicles maintained by 25,000 staff
yet only needs 30,000 of the trucks and cars, said the
newspaper. While Germany outsourced fleet operations a decade
ago, the army still employs its own maintenance staff that cost
2 billion euros ($2.85 billion) annually, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
