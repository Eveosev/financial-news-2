Brazilian swimmers Cesar Cielo,
Nicholas dos Santos and Henrique Barbosa escaped suspensions for
testing positive for a banned substance, while teammate Vinicus
Waked was banned for a year after rulings from sports’ top
court.  The four athletes were given warnings by the Brazilian
Swimming Federation in July after testing positive for
furosemide, a banned substance, and the sport’s international
body, FINA, appealed to court to get them suspended.  Today, the Court of Arbitration for Sport said the warnings
given to Cielo, dos Santos and Barbosa were appropriate, while
Waked faces a 12-month ban because it’s a second violation after
a failed drug test in 2010, CAS said today in an e-mailed
statement.  The four said they ingested a caffeine supplement that was
contaminated with furosemide, CAS said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
