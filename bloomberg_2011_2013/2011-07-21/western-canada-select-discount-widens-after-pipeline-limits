Western Canada Select’s discount
widened the most in almost two months after  Enbridge Inc. (ENB) 
limited August deliveries on two crude pipelines that help
deliver  Alberta  oil to U.S. refineries.  Enbridge’s Line 17, which runs from Stockbridge,  Michigan ,
to Toledo,  Ohio , and can transport 100,600 barrels a day of
heavy crude, can meet 87 percent of shipper requests for the
month, two people who received the information from the company
said.  The Calgary-based company’s Line 6B, which has a capacity
of 283,100 barrels a day and runs between Griffith,  Indiana , and
Sarnia, Ontario, can meet 79 percent of shipper requests for
August, said the people.  Western Canada Select’s discount to West Texas Intermediate
widened $2, to $18.75 a barrel at 12:14 p.m. in  New York ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the most the
grade has weakened in a day since June 2.  The premium for Syncrude gained 95 cents to $10.70.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
 tar sands  in Alberta.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium narrowed 55 cents to $19 a
barrel over WTI. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium narrowed 30
cents to $20 a barrel.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend lost $1.40 to $15.90 while Poseidon’s narrowed $1.05 to
$15.80 a barrel.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium retreated $1.70 to $12.25 a
barrel over WTI. West Texas Sour’s discount widened 13 cents to
50 cents below the benchmark. Thunder Horse’s premium lost $1.25
to $20.75.  To contact the reporter on this story:
