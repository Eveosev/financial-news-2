South Africa’s government is seeking
to overturn a decision by the country’s Competition Tribunal to
allow  Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT)  to buy a controlling stake in  Massmart
Holdings Ltd. (MSM) ,  Business Day reported .  Three government ministers filed papers with the
Competition Appeal Court yesterday arguing that the tribunal’s
decision should be set aside due to “unfair” hearings which
weren’t in accordance with “natural justice,” the
Johannesburg-based newspaper said.  The application was filed by Economic Development Minister
Ebrahim Patel, Trade and Industry Minister Rob Davies, and
Forestry and Fisheries Minister Tina Joemat-Pettersson, Business
Day said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
