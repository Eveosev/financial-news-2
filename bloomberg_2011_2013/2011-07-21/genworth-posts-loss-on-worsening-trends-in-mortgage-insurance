Genworth Financial Inc. (GNW) , the
Richmond, Virginia-based insurer, reported a second-quarter loss
on “worsening trends” in its mortgage-guarantee business. The
shares fell after the announcement.  The net loss was $92 million to $112 million, or 19 to 23
cents a share, the company said yesterday in a preliminary
earnings statement distributed by PR Newswire. The operating
loss of 14 cents to 18 cents a share missed the average estimate
of 24 cents by 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Net income was
$42 million, or 8 cents, a year earlier.  Genworth posted its second loss in three quarters as
homeowners fell further behind on their mortgage payments. The
company added to reserves as it  tallied  more than 39,000 insured
borrowers who had slipped into default by 12 or more payments.
That’s an increase of about 7,000 from a year earlier.  “The older delinquencies are up,” said  Steven Schwartz ,
an analyst at Raymond James & Associates Inc. “The older a
delinquency, the more you have to reserve against it.”  Genworth slumped about 8 percent to $8.68 in extended New
York trading following the announcement. It had declined 28
percent this year through yesterday.  Genworth, which also sells life insurance and retirement
products, said it will use assets with a market value of $375
million to add to reserves in its U.S. mortgage-guarantee
business.  MGIC Investment Corp. (MTG) , the biggest mortgage insurer,
had a second-quarter loss as fewer borrowers caught up on
overdue loans.  ‘Worsening Trends’  Genworth said the boost in reserves “was the result of
worsening trends” in  mortgage insurance . It also cited
“continuing weakness in the U.S. residential real estate
market.”  The number of so-called cures, in which insured borrowers
caught up on payments, dropped to 17,908 from 25,868 a year
earlier, Genworth said. New delinquencies fell to 21,272 from
26,034.  Mortgage insurers reimburse lenders when homeowners stop
paying and foreclosure fails to recoup costs.  Genworth, led by Chief Executive Officer Michael Fraizer,
reported its first annual profit since 2007 last year as
investments recovered from the credit crunch. The stock
quadrupled in 2009.  Genworth’s international business had operating income of
$105 million to $110 million in the second quarter. Operating
income at the retirement and protection segment was $145 million
to $150 million, the company said. Investment income rose 6
percent to about $880 million.  To contact the reporters on this story:
