National Commodity & Derivative
Exchange Ltd.,  India ’s second-biggest bourse, began trading gold
and silver contracts linked to the global spot price from today
as it seeks to attract bullion importers.  The contracts, called Gold International and Silver
International, will be settled at the daily rupee-dollar
 exchange rate  as set by the  Reserve Bank  of India, Somesh Vaidya,
deputy manager product, bullion, said in a phone interview from
Mumbai. The settlement price will not include customs duty as in
the contracts linked to the domestic spot prices, he said.  “It’s a pure hedge contract, because importers can import
at the prevailing international prices,” said Vaidya. The
international contracts won’t require compulsory delivery,
Vaidya said.  Gold demand in India, the world’s largest consumer, may
increase to more than 1,200 tons by 2020 as economic growth
boosts incomes and household savings, the World Gold Council
said on March 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
