Afgri Ltd. (AFR) , the handler of about a
third of South Africa’s grain, fell the most in two years after
it warned of a drop of as much as 45 percent in earnings per
share for the year ended June 30.  The stock declined as much as 7.1 percent, the biggest
retreat since July 2009, and traded down 39 cents, or 5.7
percent, to 6.50 rand as of 2:17 in Johannesburg. A close at
that level would be the lowest since June 29.  Earnings per share will be 35 percent to 45 percent lower
compared with the same period a year earlier, while headline
earnings per share will be 30 percent to 40 percent lower, the
group said in a trading statement late yesterday.  “The results were impacted by the difficult retail
operating environment in the agricultural-services industry,
both in  South Africa  and  Australia ,” Afgri said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
