The benchmark index for European
stock options plunged the most since November as euro-area
leaders considered widening the scope of their rescue fund to
halt the region’s debt crisis.  The  VStoxx Index (V2X) , which measures the cost of protecting
against a decline in shares on the Euro Stoxx 50 Index, plunged
14 percent to 23.83 in  Frankfurt  after earlier tumbling more
than 15 percent. The Euro Stoxx 50 stock index advanced 2.1
percent, the most since April 20, to 2,763.34.  Global stocks and the euro rose as European leaders
discussed easing the terms on bailouts to cash-strapped nations,
buying bonds from investors and helping countries shore up bank
balance sheets. The MSCI World Index gained 1.5 percent to
1,344.41 as of 2:11 p.m. in  New York , while the euro traded at
$1.4380, 1.2 percent more than yesterday. Stocks also gained
amid optimism lawmakers in  Washington  were nearing agreement to
increase the debt ceiling to avoid a U.S. default.  “There’s a sense of relief coming out of Europe,”
Philippe Trouve, the VIX options trader and director for equity
derivatives at Bank of America Corp. in New York, said in a
telephone interview. “People are taking it as positive news and
we also have the U.S. coming to an agreement, so those two macro
risks are getting better on the same day.”  August VStoxx futures tumbled 7.4 percent to 24.50, while
September contracts declined 4.2 percent to 25.10.  In  Germany , the benchmark gauge of the country’s stock-
market volatility dropped the most since June 29. The VDAX-New
fell 12 percent to 19.76 in Frankfurt. The measure is derived
from prices paid for options on the  DAX Index (DAX) , which added 1
percent to 7,290.14 today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
