Natura Cosmeticos SA (NATU3) ’s profit fell
1.8 percent in the second-quarter, as  Latin America ’s largest
cosmetics company’s sales grew at a slower pace, in line with
the country’s economic expansion.  Net income fell to 188.1 million reais ($120.2 million)
from 191.5 million reais a year earlier, the Cajamar-based
company said in a regulatory filing. The mean profit estimate by
eight analysts compiled by Bloomberg was 212.8 million reais.
Sales rose 8.6 percent to 1.39 billion reais, up from 1.28
billion reais a year earlier.  Growth in Latin America’s largest economy is poised to
decelerate to 4.5 percent in 2011, after growing 7.5 percent in
2010, the fastest pace in more than two decades.  “Natura has been investing aggressively in logistics,
information technology and headcount,” Banco Santander SA
analysts Joaquin Ley and Tobias Stingelin wrote in a July 19
note to clients. The investments are the “right strategy” to
sustain growth, “but it also reinforces our view that the ‘cost
of doing’ business is growing,” the analysts wrote. Santander
has an “underperform” rating to the stock.  Natura’s margin on earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization fell to 23.5 percent, from 25.9
percent in the same period last year, reflecting the company’s
higher expenses.  Natura fell 1.3 percent to 36.61 reais yesterday in the Sao
Paulo trading. The stock is down 23 percent since the beginning
of the year, compared with a 15 percent drop in the Bovespa
benchmark index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
