The following are rainfall figures
for  Ivory Coast , the world’s biggest cocoa producer, for July
11-20, according to the National Meteorological Service.  The central-western Daloa region is the west African
nation’s biggest cocoa-growing area geographically, with average
annual production of about 300,000 metric tons.  The southwestern Soubre region, including the western
coastal towns of  San Pedro , Tabou and Sassandra, produces about
300,000 tons a year.  The central Gagnoa area grows about 100,000 tons, while
output in the central Yamoussoukro region, including Dimbokro,
is about 30,000 tons.  Annual production in the coastal area around Adiake is
about 80,000 tons and the eastern Bondoukou region grows about
3,000 tons.  The figures are tabulated under weather station, the amount
of rainfall received, long-term average rainfall over the last
30 years, the number of days it has rained, and the amount of
rainfall in the same period last year. Rainfall amounts are in
millimeters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
