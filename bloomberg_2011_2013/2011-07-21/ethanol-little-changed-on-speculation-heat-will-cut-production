Ethanol futures were little changed
in  Chicago  amid concern that hot weather in the Midwest will
reduce production.  The corn-based additive dropped on speculation that a  heat
wave  covering the Midwest, where most U.S. ethanol plants are
located, will lead to lower output. A report from the Energy
Department’s Energy Information Administration showed production
steady at 873,000 barrels a day.  “Demand has been strong,” said Jerrod Kitt, an analyst at
Linn Group in Chicago. “The EIA stats were the only thing
supportive and the hot weather does reduce yields. When it gets
hot like this they always complain that they can’t get things
cool enough.”  Denatured ethanol for August delivery rose 0.3 cent to
settle at $2.895 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices
July 19 were at $2.911, the highest settlement since June 27,
2008. Futures are up 22 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf was
unchanged at $2.95 a gallon and in  New York  the additive lost 1
cent, or 0.3 percent, to $3.065, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago dropped 3.5 cents, or 1.2 percent, to
$2.975 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel slid 3.5
cents, or 1.1 percent, to $3.09.  Corn futures for December delivery dropped 4.75 cents, or
0.7 percent, to settle at $6.73 a bushel on the Chicago Board of
Trade. One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
