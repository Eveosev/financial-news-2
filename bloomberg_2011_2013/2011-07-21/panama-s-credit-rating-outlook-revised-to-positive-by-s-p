Panama  had its credit outlook
revised to positive from stable by Standard & Poor’s Ratings
Service as the economy grows faster than expected.  S&P lifted Panama’s foreign currency long-term debt rating
to BBB-, the lowest investment grade level, in May of last year.  “The positive outlook is based on our view that stronger
growth and increased infrastructure spending could result in
faster-than-expected improvement in the sovereign’s financial
profile,” analysts Roberto Sifon Arevalo and Joydeep Mukherji
wrote in a report from New York. “The positive outlook reflects
the likelihood of an upgrade if the better-than-expected
performance of Panama’s economy continues over the next year or
two.”  Fitch Ratings  lifted Panama’s credit to BBB, the second-
lowest investment grade rating, last month, while Moody’s
Investors Service has held it at Baa3, its lowest investment
grade, since June of last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
