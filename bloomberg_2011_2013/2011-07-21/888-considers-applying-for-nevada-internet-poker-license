888 Holdings Plc (888) , a U.K.-listed
 Internet gambling  company, may apply for an online poker license
in  Nevada , possibly for a venture with Caesars Entertainment
Corp., Deputy Chairman Brian Mattingley said.  The company is is in the “advanced stages” of talks with
Caesars, the world’s biggest casino company, about partnerships,
he said. Also, second-quarter sales rose 29 percent, led by
poker and casino games, the Gibraltar-based company said in a
statement.  U.K. gambling companies are looking to lock up deals in the
U.S. as states including Nevada and  California  consider Internet
gambling. U.K. bookmaker  William Hill Plc (WMH)  agreed to buy three
companies to offer sports bets, which are legal in Nevada. 888
was licensed by Nevada for software services after it signed an
agreement in 2009 with Caesars, formerly known as Harrah’s.  “We would love to do it with them,” Mattingley said in a
telephone interview. He said 888 would decide whether to try for
the Internet poker license by “mid-autumn.”  Last month, Nevada passed a law that permits Internet poker
if the federal government also approves it.  The company would consider debt funding if it needed the
money to expand in the U.S. or  Spain , which is considering
online gambling rules, Mattingley said. At the moment, 888 has
no need for such funding. “It’s just we don’t want to miss no-
brainer opportunities as they arise,” he added.  888 rose 2.25 pence, or 6.8 percent, to 35.25 pence at 9:45
a.m. in  London , after earlier gaining as much as 9.1 percent.
The shares have fallen 36 percent so far this year, giving the
company a market value of 122.2 million pounds ($197 million).  It expects to report a full-year financial performance
“marginally ahead” of current analyst forecasts. Second-
quarter revenue gained to $79 million from $61 million in the
year-earlier period, 888 said.  The company revamped its poker formats a year ago to make
them more accessible to casual players, and it also added what
it calls Pokercam, live video streaming of games. In April,
 Ladbrokes Plc (LAD)  ended takeover talks with 888 that lasted almost
four months.  Casino-game sales gained 34 percent to $36 million, and
poker sales increased 58 percent to $13 million, 888 said. The
company said its number of active casino and poker customers on
June 30 was 342,000, more than double a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
