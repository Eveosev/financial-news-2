Sweden’s krona rose the most in more
than three weeks against the euro amid speculation an agreement
to halt  Europe ’s debt crisis will boost appetite for currencies
tied to economic growth.  The krona appreciated for a third straight day versus the
dollar and advanced against all 16 major peers tracked by
Bloomberg.  Greece  may win an extension on bailout loans to 15
years at a rate of 3.5 percent, lower than its current payments,
and the European Financial Stability Facility may get the right
to act in bond markets, a European Union official said today.  “If the euro area does come out with some positive
progress, that should improve risk appetite,” said Sara Yates,
a foreign-exchange strategist at Barclays Plc, in a phone
interview. “The Swedish krona has very good fundamentals. It
has a positive relationship with global risk.”  The krona appreciated as much as 1 percent to 9.0697 per
euro before trading at 9.0993 per euro as of 2:59 p.m. in
 London . It advanced 1.5 percent to 6.3440 per dollar.  Those with an “optimistic” view of the euro-area debt
talks should buy the krona against the Swiss franc, Yates said
in an e-mailed note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
