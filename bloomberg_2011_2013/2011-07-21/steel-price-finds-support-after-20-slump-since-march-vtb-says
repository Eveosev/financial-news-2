Global steel prices won’t fall
further after dropping more than 20 percent from their two-year
highs of almost $1,000 a metric ton in March, VTB Capital said.  Prices for hot-rolled coil, a benchmark steel commodity,
“have normalised at an average of about $780 in recent weeks,”
Wiktor Bielski, a London-based analyst, said in a note today.
“We believe this will now be a floor for the market.”  Customers’ practise of destocking or buying on short notice
to fill immediate orders may prove “dangerous” as demand
increases in the third quarter, Bielski wrote. In addition,
higher raw materials prices will roll over into the fourth
quarter, pushing steelmakers to pass on their higher costs.  “Finally, Chinese hot-rolled coil prices have remained
well supported,” while futures on rebar, a steel product used
in construction, have “bounced back to their highest levels
since April,” Bielski said in the report.  Global steel output rose 8 percent in June from a year
earlier to 127.7 million metric tons, the World Steel
Association said yesterday on  its website . Annualized, that
implies record production of 1.55 billion tons,  Renaissance
Capital  said in a note today. Chinese steel output rose 12
percent in June to 59.9 million tons, the association said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
