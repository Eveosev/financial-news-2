Global cotton demand in the year
ending this month will be 1.7 percent lower than estimated in
June at 23.864 million metric tons, almost matching world
production of the fiber, researcher Cotlook said.  Output will come to 23.882 million tons, little changed
from the month-ago forecast, it said in a report today. Cotlook
lowered consumption estimates by 2.2 percent for  India , 0.8
percent for  Brazil  and 0.4 percent for  Turkey . Usage in the
coming year will be 3.5 percent below June’s estimate at 24.558
million tons, the report shows.  “The result is to place the season’s supply and demand
broadly in equilibrium,” Cotlook said. Lower consumption in the
coming year “far outweighs a net fall in the production figure,
and sharply increases the extent to which supply is expected to
exceed demand during the season ahead,” it said.  Cotton for December delivery fell 1.7 percent to 99.08
cents a pound by 12:34 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York .
Futures have dropped 32 percent this year as stockpiles are
expected to surge.  To contact the reporter on this story:
