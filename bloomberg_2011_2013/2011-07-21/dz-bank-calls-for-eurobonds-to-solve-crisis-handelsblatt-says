A solution to the euro-regionâ€™s debt
crisis should include so-called euro-bonds and intergovernmental
transfer mechanisms, DZ Bank AG Chief Executive Officer Wolfgang Kirsch said in a commentary in  Handelsblatt .  The measures would allow countries to refinance debt for as
much as 60 percent of their gross domestic product with a
guarantee from the rest of the eurozone, Kirsch said.  The remaining debt would be refinanced without that
guarantee, he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
