coming 12 to 18 months,  Financial Times Deutschland  reported
today, citing HHL Chief Executive Officer Roger Iliffe.  The CEO of HHL, which was created by Oaktree from  Germany ’s
Beluga Shipping GmbH, sees purchase opportunities as more German
shipping companies are likely to get into trouble, Iliffe said,
