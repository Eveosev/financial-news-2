BB&T Corp. (BBT) , the ninth-largest U.S.
bank by deposits, reported second-quarter profit increased as
provisions for credit losses decreased 50 percent.  Net income increased to $307 million, or 44 cents per
share, from $210 million, or 30 cents, in the year-earlier
period, the Winston-Salem, North Carolina-based bank said today
in a statement. The average estimate of 33 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was for profit of 43 cents per share.  BB&T, run by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kelly King, 62, continued to reduce the amount set aside for credit
losses after slashing it by 47 percent in the first quarter. The
provision decreased 50 percent to $328 million in the second
quarter from a year earlier. Minneapolis-based U.S. Bancorp, the
fifth-largest lender, and Pittsburgh-based PNC Financial
Services Group Inc., ranked sixth, reported yesterday that lower
loan-loss provisions helped increase second-quarter profit.  BB&T rose 35 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $25.63 yesterday in
 New York  Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have
fallen 2.5 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
