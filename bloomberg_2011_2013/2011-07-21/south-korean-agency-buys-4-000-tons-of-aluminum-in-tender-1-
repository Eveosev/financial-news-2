South Korea , Asia’s third-biggest
buyer of base metals, bought 4,000 metric tons of aluminum in a
tender at the same premium as paid in the last tender in May,
according to a state agency.  The Public Procurement Service, the state-run body that
manages strategic commodities, bought the so-called Western
origin metal at $102 a ton over the London Metal Exchange
official cash-settlement price from  Daewoo International Corp. (047050) ,
according to a notice on the agency’s  website  today. The high-
grade, primary aluminum is due for shipment by Sept. 30.  Aluminum for three-month delivery was little changed at
$2,533 per ton on the LME at 4:25 p.m. in Seoul. The light-
weight metal, used in automobiles, cans and window frames, has
advanced 2.6 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
