Cash premiums for U.S. corn and
soybeans shipped in July to export terminals near  New Orleans 
narrowed relative to Chicago futures as demand slowed.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for corn delivered this
month was $1.02 to $1.03 a bushel above September futures,
compared with $1.03 to $1.04 yesterday, U.S. Department of
Agriculture  data  show. The soybean premium declined to 75 cents
to 84 cents a bushel above August futures from 77 cents to 84
cents, the fifth drop in six sessions.  “It’s extremely quiet,”  Glenn Hollander , a partner at
Hollander & Feuerhaken, a cash grain merchandiser and broker in
Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “People are pulling
back a bit and waiting to see if prices fall.”  Corn futures for September delivery fell 8.75 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $6.7925 a bushel on the  Chicago  Board of Trade, the
third decline this week. On July 19, the price reached $7.235,
the highest for the contract since June 15.  Soybean futures for August delivery rose 2 cents to
$13.8025 a bushel, the first gain in four sessions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
