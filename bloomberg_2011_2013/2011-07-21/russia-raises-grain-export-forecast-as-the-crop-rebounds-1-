Russia  raised its grain export
forecast to 18 million metric tons in the marketing year that
started July 1 as the crop rebounds after last year’s drought,
Agriculture Minister  Yelena Skrynnik  said.  “We will regain our position in the global grain market,”
Skrynnik said in Moscow today. The grain crop may come to
between 85 million and 90 million tons, enough to meet domestic
needs and allow for exports, she said.  Russia resumed exports this month after banning overseas
sales last August amid the worst drought in at least 50 years.
The ministry’s latest export  forecast  rose from 15 million to 17
million tons, according to a statement on June 30. Russia’s
grain crop fell to 60.9 million tons in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
