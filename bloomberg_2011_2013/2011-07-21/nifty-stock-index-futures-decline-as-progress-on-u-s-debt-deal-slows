India’s benchmark stock index fell
to the lowest level in a week amid concern company earnings may
trail estimates as the central bank increases  interest rates  to
control inflation.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , India’s most valuable company,
lost 1.8 percent. Drugmaker  Biocon Ltd. (BIOS)  and  Exide Industries
Ltd. (EXID) , a battery maker, fell after earnings missed forecasts.
 Reliance Communications Ltd. (RCOM) , the second-largest mobile-phone
operator, sank 4.2 percent.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, fell
0.4 percent to 18,436.19, its lowest level since July 12, at the
3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai. The measure is the second-worst
performer this year among benchmark indexes in the biggest 10
markets amid interest-rate increases. Three out of seven Sensex
companies that have posted earnings for the June quarter have
missed estimates as rising borrowing costs damped demand.  “I suspect this result season is going to be worse than
the last season,” said Andrew Holland, chief executive officer
for equities at Ambit Capital Pvt. “Companies which will not
perform well will be punished. Foreign investors will take a
long time to come back to those stocks.”  Companies on the Sensex may report a profit growth of 12
percent to 14 percent in the year ending March 2012, less than
the consensus estimate of 17 percent, Rakesh Arora, head of
research at Macquarie Capital Securities ( India ) Pvt., said in a
July 18 interview. Bank of America Merrill Lynch reduced its
profit estimate to 17 percent from 21 percent, Jyotivardhan Jaipuria, head of India research, said July 19.  Some 33 percent of the companies in the Sensex missed
analysts’ profit estimates in the March quarter, compared with
less than a quarter that did so last year.  Food Costs Drop  The  Reserve Bank of India  meets on July 26 to set policy
after raising rates 10 times since March last year to rein in
accelerating prices. Inflation quickened to 9.44 percent in June
from 9.06 percent in May, the government said last week.  Food inflation rate fell to the lowest since March 2009 as
grain output increased, an easing that may not be sufficient to
prevent the central bank from raising rates next week.  An index measuring wholesale prices of agricultural goods,
including rice and lentils, increased 7.58 percent in the week
ended July 9 from a year ago, the trade ministry said today. It
gained 8.31 percent the week before.  “We expect a third round of quantitative easing in the
U.S. will add to inflationary pressures in India via higher raw-
material costs,” Rahul Singh, managing director and head of
equity research at Standard Chartered Securities (India) Ltd.,
said in an interview yesterday.  Reserve Bank  may raise rates by
another 50 to 75 basis points by end of 2011, he said.  The S&P CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange of
India Ltd. lost 0.5 percent to 5,541.60 and its July futures
settled at 5,544.20.  Cash Pile  Reliance Industries decreased 1.8 percent to 860.85 rupees
and its July futures settled at 859 rupees. The company may say
July 25 profit in the quarter ended June increased 16.5 percent
to 56.5 billion rupees, according to the median estimate of 14
analysts in a Bloomberg News Survey.  Reliance’s “results are not going to be up to market
expectations,” said Ambit’s Holland. “Until we get a clear
view of the company’s strategy on the huge cash pile, the stocks
is going” to underperform. The company’s shares have fallen 18
percent in the past year, compared with a 2.5 percent gain in
the Sensex. Cash and equivalents totaled 423.9 billion rupees
($9.5 billion), the company said April 21.  Biocon slid 2 percent to 363.3 rupees after profit at the
nation’s biggest biotechnology company declined 8.7 percent to
700.5 million rupees, less than 829 million rupees estimated by
analysts. Exide sank 9.4 percent to 154.35 rupees. The company
posted net income of 1.63 billion rupees in the June quarter,
compared with a median estimate of 1.78 billion rupees.  Motorcycle Sales  Hero Honda Motors Ltd. (HH) , which produces almost half the
motorcycles sold in India, climbed 1.6 percent to 1,785.25
rupees, ending a five-day 6.5 percent slide. Net income beat
analyst estimates for the first time in five quarters as rising
incomes boosted sales to a record.  Net income in the quarter ended June rose to 5.58 billion
rupees, from 4.92 billion rupees a year earlier, exceeding the
5.5 billion-rupee median of 27 analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales climbed 32 percent to 56.4 billion rupees.  Reliance Communications plunged 4.2 percent to 90.5 rupees,
extending this year’s loss to 38 percent.  JSW Energy Ltd. (JSW) , a power producer, plummeted 6.5 percent to
71 rupees, the most since Feb. 9, after its profit dropped 55
percent to 1.36 billion rupees from a year earlier.  MindTree Ltd. (MTCL) , a software maker, surged 9.5 percent to
393.85 rupees, the most in six months, after reporting first-
quarter profit more than doubled to 345 million rupees. That
beat analysts’ estimate of 245 million rupees.  Overseas funds sold a net 311 million rupees ($7 million)
of Indian equities yesterday, paring their investment in stocks
this year to 96.2 billion rupees, according to data on the
 website  of the  Securities and Exchange Board of India .  To contact the reporter on this story:
