Barclays Plc (BARC)  underpaid for Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc.’s North American businesses in 2008 when
it spent $500 million less on bonuses for former Lehman
employees than it should have, the bankrupt firm said.  Lehman, which lost a bid to recoup an alleged $11 billion
windfall from London-based Barclays, said it is counting the
bonuses as part of the sale price even if the money was owed to
its former employees. In a court filing yesterday, it asked a
judge to order the U.K. bank to pay the money to the estate as a
form of “damages.”  “Barclays simply has not lived up to its obligation,” it
said. “LBHI has been harmed.”  Barclays is fighting Lehman’s demand. The $2 billion in
bonuses listed in the sale documents was an estimate that
included severance payments, it has said. As Lehman wasn’t
harmed by the amount paid to former employees, it isn’t entitled
to claim damages, Barclays said in court filings.  A hearing on the issue is set for Sept. 7 in  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court  in Manhattan.  The main case is In re  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) ,
08-13555, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of  New York 
(Manhattan). The lawsuit is Lehman v. Barclays, 09-01731, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
