L’Tur Tourismus AG, majority-owned
owned by  TUI AG (TUI1) , said sales this year are “significantly”
higher than last year,  Financial Times Deutschland  reported
today, citing L’Tur Chief Executive Officer Markus Orth.  The company is likely to reach its goal of having more than
1 million customers this year, as it starts selling its last-
minute trips in TUI’s stores and because of a cooperation
agreement with Deutsche Bahn AG, Orth said, according to FTD.  To contact the reporter on this story:
