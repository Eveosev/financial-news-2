India ’s rupee fell for the first
time in three days on concern accelerating inflation will damp
economic growth and reduce corporate earnings.  The currency retreated from a one-week high as the Bombay
Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index fell for a second day. Infosys
Ltd., the nation’s second-largest code writer, and Housing
Development Finance Corp., the largest mortgage lender, reported
this month earnings that missed analysts’ estimates. Inflation
quickened to 9.44 percent last month, government data show, the
most after  Argentina  among the Group of 20 nations.  “Foreign investors are unsure about the Indian growth
story as inflation worries persist,” said R.S. Chauhan, the
chief dealer in charge of fixed income and currencies at  State
Bank  of Bikaner & Jaipur in Mumbai. “That’s putting pressure on
the rupee.”  The rupee declined 0.1 percent to 44.5050 at the 5 p.m.
close in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
touched 44.4250 earlier, the strongest level since July 14.  Factory output in India rose 5.6 percent in May from a year
earlier, the smallest gain in nine months, the government said
July 12.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 45.04 in
three months, compared with expectations of 44.99 yesterday.
