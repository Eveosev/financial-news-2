SunCoke Energy Inc., the
metallurgical coke-producing unit of  Sunoco Inc. (SUN) , climbed 6.3
percent after it raised $185.6 million in an initial public
offering.  SunCoke, rose $1 to $17 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading after gaining as much as 13 percent
to $18. About 11.6 million shares were sold at $16 each, SunCoke
said today in a statement. That was the midpoint of the price
range it sought.  Sunoco, a Philadelphia-based petroleum refiner, expects to
pare its SunCoke stake to 83 percent after the offering.
SunCoke, the biggest independent producer of metallurgical coke
in the Americas, won’t receive any proceeds from the IPO.  The coke is used as a fuel for steelmaking and to reduce
the metal’s oxygen content. SunCoke, which sells coke to
ArcelorMittal and AK Steel Holding Corp. in the U.S., signed an
agreement in May to take a minority stake in  India ’s Global Coke
Ltd. for $30 million.  “Further deals like that could be under consideration,”
Chief Executive Office Fritz Henderson said today in an
interview on Bloomberg Television’s “InBusiness with Margaret
Brennan.” “Outside of the U.S. we see good growth.”  SunCoke tapped the  bond market  yesterday, selling $400
million of debt maturing in August 2019, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The company was seeking $450 million in
loans to support the separation from Sunoco, two people with
knowledge of the matter said last month.  Net income declined 87 percent to $5.7 million in the three
months through March 31 as revenue increased 1.5 percent to
$333.3 million, according to a filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ,  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  and Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. managed the offering.  ----With assistance from Margaret Brennan, Sapna Maheshwari,
