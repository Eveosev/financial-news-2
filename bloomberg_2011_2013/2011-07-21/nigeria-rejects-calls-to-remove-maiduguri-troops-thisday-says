Nigerian President  Goodluck Jonathan 
rejected calls to withdraw troops from the northern town of
Maiduguri, which has seen a wave of attacks by an Islamic group,
 ThisDay  said, citing Labara Maku, the minister of information.  The decision followed a meeting on the security situation,
Maku said, according to the Lagos-based newspaper. The troops
have been accused of human rights abuses, ThisDay reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
