Palm oil  dropped as a rally to the
highest level in four weeks may have prompted some investors to
sell the commodity amid concerns that output may be rising.  The October-delivery contract fell as much as 0.4 percent
to 3,141 ringgit ($1,048) per metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange, and ended the morning session little
changed at 3,150 ringgit. Futures reached 3,164 ringgit earlier,
the highest level since June 23.  “There are concerns of rising production as we reach the
peak seasonal production months,” said Ivy Ng, an analyst at
CIMB Investment Bank Bhd. July, August and September are the
peak production months for the tropical oil.  Futures have lost 17 percent this year on prospects of
bigger inventories as better weather resulted in higher output
from  Indonesia  and Malaysia, the biggest producers. Malaysia
will produce 18.6 million tons in 2011, up 16 percent from a
three-year low last year, Oil World said in a report on July 19.
Indonesia’s output this year will rise 8.1 percent to 24 million
tons, according to the report.  World production of palm, soybean, cotton, groundnut, sun,
rape, palm kernel and coconut oils will rise to a total of 145.7
million tons this year, Oil World said. Global palm oil output
will rise 8.5 percent to 49.8 million tons and  soybean oil 
output will gain 5.2 percent to 42.3 million tons, it said.  Indonesia cut the  tax rate  on crude palm oil exports in
August to 15 percent from 20 percent this month, and reduced the
base price for calculating the levy on the tropical oil to
$1,017 a ton from $1,096 a ton, Deddy Saleh, director general
for foreign trade at the Trade Ministry, said yesterday.  Soybeans for delivery in November advanced as much as 0.6
percent to $13.92 per bushel in  Chicago . Soybean oil for
December climbed as much as 0.6 percent to 58.07 cents per pound.  Palm oil for May delivery on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange 
gained as much as 0.7 percent to 9,276 yuan ($1,438) a ton.
Soybean oil for delivery in the same month fell as much as 0.4
percent to 10,324 yuan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
