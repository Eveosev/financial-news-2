Chief Executive Officer Vincent de Rivaz said he is “very
confident” that its U.K. nuclear project will have a
“shorter” timetable than EDF’s Flamanville project in
Normandy, France, which has been delayed by two years, the
Financial Times reported, citing an interview.  “We will deliver our nuclear project when the country
needs it,” de Rivaz said, according to the FT.  To contact the reporter on this story:
