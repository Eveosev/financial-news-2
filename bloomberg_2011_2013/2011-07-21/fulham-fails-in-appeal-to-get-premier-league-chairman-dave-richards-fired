A London court rejected Fulham
soccer club’s latest effort to hear a case to remove Dave Richards as English Premier League chairman over his part
in a player sale.  Fulham claimed Richards acted improperly by becoming
involved in the transfer of  Peter Crouch  from Portsmouth to
Tottenham in 2009. It said Richards’s efforts led Crouch to join
Tottenham for 9 million pounds ($14.6 million) rather than
Fulham, which was prepared to pay 11 million pounds.  Fulham took the matter to court after rejecting the
league’s offer of arbitration. The court said Fulham must follow
league statutes that say matters must be resolved in arbitration.  High Court Judge Geoffrey Vos first ruled against the west
London-based team in December.  “I would affirm the decision of Vos and dismiss the
appeal,” Nicholas Pattern, one of three judges to rule on the
case, said today.  Richards had acknowledged talking to Tottenham on behalf of
Portsmouth but denied Fulham’s claims he acted as an
“unauthorized” agent in the trade. Portsmouth needed to raise
9 million pounds in order to avoid being shutdown over taxes
owed to the U.K. government, court papers show. Spurs paid the
entire fee in a lump sum.  Richards has been Premier League chairman for 12 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
