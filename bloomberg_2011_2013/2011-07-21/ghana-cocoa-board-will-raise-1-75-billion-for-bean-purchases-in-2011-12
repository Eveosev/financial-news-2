Ghana ’s Cocoa Board said it will
raise $1.75 billion for cocoa purchases in the 2011/2012 crop
season, $250 million more than a year earlier.  Increased use of pesticides and fertilizers in the world’s
second-largest cocoa producer has boosted output, Yaw Adu-
Ampomah, its deputy chief executive officer, said in an
interview yesterday in the West African nation’s capital, Accra.  The money will be raised by a consortium of banks on the
international market, he said. The state-owned board regulates
the market, buying beans from farmers and selling them on the
international market.  Adu-Ampomah said the board has plans to raise an additional
$200 million to fund improvements to the industry’s
infrastructure including roads and warehouses.  “We could produce 1 million tons next year, sustaining our
projected output for this year,” Adu-Ampomah said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
