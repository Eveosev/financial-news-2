South African Reserve Bank Governor
Gill Marcus made the following comments on inflation after a
meeting of the bank’s monetary policy committee in  Pretoria 
today.  “Food and oil prices remain the major risk to the
inflation outlook.  “The view of the MPC continues to be that the underlying
inflation pressures are mainly of a cost-push-nature.  “Despite the upside risk posed by cost-push factors, the
MPC sees a number of downside risks to the inflation outlook,
with the risks being seen to be delicately balanced.  “These risks include the continued fragile nature of the
domestic recovery, as well as the risks posed by the
ramifications of a possible disorderly default in the Euro zone.  “The MPC is not complacent and will remain vigilant and
continue to monitor closely any indications of second round
effects on inflation emanating from these cost pressures as well
as the changing risk profile of the inflation outlook.  “In light of the above the MPC has decided to keep”
interest rates unchanged.  To contact the reporter on this story:
