The euro surged the most in six
months and stocks rallied as European officials detailed a plan
to halt the region’s debt crisis. Treasuries fell and the Dollar
Index slid the most since December.  The euro strengthened 1.5 percent to $1.4425 as of 5 p.m.
in  New York  and climbed 2.2 percent in three days. The Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index rose 1.4 percent to 1,343.8 as of the market
close in New York. Italian, Spanish and Greek bonds surged and
costs to protect the region’s debt from default slid the most
since May 2010. Oil traded above $100 a barrel for the first
time in more than a month. The Dollar Index lost 1.1 percent.  The euro and equities strengthened as European officials
said Greece will receive aid worth 160 billion euros ($230
billion) and empowered their bailout fund to buy the debt of
stressed nations and offer emergency credit lines. Better-than-
estimated quarterly results from  Morgan Stanley (MS)  and other
companies also boosted U.S. stocks.  “It’s a sigh of relief,” Joseph Veranth, chief investment
officer at Dana Investment Advisors in Brookfield,  Wisconsin ,
said in a telephone interview. The firm manages $3.3
billion.“Progress on Europe’s debt situation is allowing the
market to remain at these levels. It’s the framework for a
package and the markets have reacted positively.”  Earnings Season  U.S. equities erased yesterday’s 0.1 percent drop in the
 S&P 500 , sending the index to its highest level since July 8.
The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  climbed 152.5 points, or 1.2
percent, to 12,724.41, its highest close since May 10.  Stocks rallied to their highs of the session after the New
York Times reported that lawmakers were close to a deal to cut
the U.S. deficit, helping the government of the world’s largest
economy avoid default. Spokesmen for President  Barack Obama  and
House Speaker John Boehner denied the report.   Morgan Stanley, the world’s largest brokerage, jumped 11
percent for its biggest gain in two years after reporting a
second-quarter loss that was smaller than analysts estimated as
trading revenue increased from the first quarter.  Medco Health
Solutions Inc. (MHS)  surged 14 percent after  Express Scripts Inc. (ESRX) 
agreed to buy the pharmacy-benefits manager for $29.1 billion.  Per-share earnings have grown 17 percent and exceeded
analyst estimates at 86 of the 100 companies in the S&P 500 that
posted results since July 11, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Economic Data  U.S. equity index futures maintained gains before the start
of trading even as more people than forecast filed claims for
 unemployment benefits  last week. Applications for jobless
benefits increased 10,000 last week to 418,000, Labor Department
figures showed. Economists forecast 410,000 claims, according to
the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  Stocks extended their advance in the first hour of trading
after the Conference Board’s index of leading economic
indicators and a Federal Reserve gauge of manufacturing in the
Philadelphia region both topped economists’ estimates.  The yield on the 10-year Treasury note increased eight
basis points to 3.004 percent, rising above 3 percent for the
first time in two weeks. Two-year yields added two basis points
to 0.40 percent.  S&P reiterated it sees a 50 percent chance of downgrading
the U.S. credit rating within three months as the federal debt
ceiling loomed. The Treasury auctioned $13 billion of 10-year
inflation-protected securities today and will sell $99 billion
in notes next week.  ‘No Deal’  President Barack Obama’s spokesman,  Jay Carney , and House
Speaker  John Boehner  said there is “no deal” on raising the
U.S. debt limit as all sides said they still lack a consensus on
spending cuts and  tax revenue . Carney made his remarks at a
briefing in Washington and Boehner posted his in a Twitter
message.  Senators seeking a compromise haven’t produced details
sought by leaders, making it harder to add their proposals to a
plan to raise the $14.3 trillion debt ceiling, said two
Democratic aides familiar with the discussions. A bipartisan
group of senators called the “Gang of Six” outlined a $3.7
trillion deficit-reduction plan and Obama embraced it this week.
Boehner told reporters he prepared his membership for a possible
compromise with Democrats and he believed a majority of the 240
Republicans are prepared to do so.  The euro increased versus 13 of 16 major peers after
depreciating against all of them earlier. The dollar weakened
against 15 of 16 counterparts and the Dollar Index, a gauge of
the U.S. currency against six major peers, fell 1 percent to
74.015 in its biggest drop since Jan. 13.  European Stocks  European stocks erased earlier losses, with banks leading
gains as details of the European debt summit trickled out during
the trading session. National Bank of  Greece  SA surged 11
percent to lead Greek lenders higher. Swedbank AB advanced 6.2
percent after the largest lender in the Baltic region posted
profit that beat analysts’ estimates. Ericsson AB, the world’s
largest maker of wireless networks, tumbled 9.7 percent as
earnings fell short of analysts’ estimates.  The yield on the Spanish 10-year bond decreased 25 basis
points to 5.69 percent. The government sold 2.6 billion euros
($3.7 billion) of securities. Similar-maturity Italian debt
yields fell 25 basis points to 5.32 percent and Greek 10-year
yields tumbled 86 points to 16.49 percent.  Credit-default swaps protecting Spanish debt decreased 36
basis points to 308 as of the market close in  London , Irish
swaps lost 172.7 basis points to 904.155 and contracts on Greece
fell 348 points to 2,000, according to CMA.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western  Europe  Index of swaps on 15
governments fell 21 basis points to 260, the biggest retreat
since May 10, 2010. The index is down from a record 306 points
on July 18.  Brussels Summit  Euro-area leaders redoubled efforts to end the 21-month
sovereign bond crisis as they risked a temporary default to ease
Greece’s debt burden and erected a firewall around Spain and
Italy. The wider scope for the 440-billion euro European
Financial Stability Facility resulted from concessions from
 Germany  and the  European Central Bank . Today’s summit in
Brussels was the latest in a battle to resolve and contain the
crisis amid calls this week for tougher action from Obama and
the  International Monetary Fund .  Two European officials familiar with the talks say
governments may guarantee any defaulted Greek debt offered as
collateral at money market operations. That would enable Greek
banks to keep tapping the ECB for emergency funds. The officials
said the aim would be limit any  credit event  to a few days.  Wheat Slumps, Sugar Rallies  Wheat lost 2.8 percent, leading losses in the S&P GSCI
Index, on signs that demand is easing for U.S. supplies as
competing producers boost output and lower prices. Sugar rallied
3.2 percent 29.85 cents a pound, leading gains among commodities
tracked by the index, on signs that production will trail
estimates in Brazil.  Oil for September delivery advanced 0.7 percent to $99.13 a
barrel in New York, a third straight gain, and traded above $100
for the first time since June 15. Gold futures decreased 0.6
percent to $1,587 an ounce, erasing earlier gains. The metal
reached a record of $1,610.70 on July 19.  The MSCI Emerging Markets Index advanced 0.6 percent for a
third straight gain as benchmark indexes in Hungary and Brazil
rallied more than 1.9 percent.  The Shanghai Composite Index sank 1 percent after the HSBC
Purchasing Managers’ Index slumped below 50 for the first time
in a year, denoting a contraction in the nation’s industrial
output. Turkey’s ISE National 100 Index slid 1.2 percent after
 Fitch Ratings  said the current-account deficit made an upgrade
of the country’s credit “uncertain.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
