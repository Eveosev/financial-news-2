Seagate Technology Plc (STX) , the world’s
second-largest maker of hard-disk drives, dropped the most in
two and a half years after forecasting first-quarter profit that
missed analysts’ estimates.  Seagate declined $2.86, or 17 percent, to $14.13 at 4:00
p.m.  New York  time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The stock has
dropped 6 percent this year.  First-quarter adjusted earnings will fall to as much as 33
cents a share, Dublin-based Seagate said today on a conference
call. Analysts projected 43 cents, the average of estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts including Bill Shope
reduced their price target for Seagate to $16.50 from $19,
citing margin pressures and a “disappointing” first-quarter
earnings forecast.  Fourth-quarter profit excluding some items totaled 28 cents
a share, the company said in a statement yesterday. Analysts
projected 25 cents, the average of estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales rose 7.6 percent to $2.86 billion for the three
months ended July 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
