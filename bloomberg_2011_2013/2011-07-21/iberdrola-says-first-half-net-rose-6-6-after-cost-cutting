Iberdrola SA (IBE) ,  Spain â€™s biggest power
company, said net income rose 6.6 percent in the first half of
the year as it cut costs.  Profit at the Bilbao-based utility reached 1.56 billion
euros ($2.23 billion) as sales advanced 1.5 percent to 15.56
billion euros, the company said in a regulatory filing.
Operating costs fell 3.2 percent to 1.7 billion euros while
financial costs were 22 percent lower at 1.35 billion euros.  Iberdrola is streamlining its business to sustain profit
growth even as electricity demand declines in its biggest
markets. Power consumption in Spain dipped 0.7 percent from the
year earlier period while in the U.K., where the utility has 3.4
million customers, it dropped 2.5 percent as governments cut
spending to rein in their budget deficits.  The shares rose as much as 2 percent in  Madrid  and traded
1.4 percent higher at 5.78 euros at 9:02 local time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
