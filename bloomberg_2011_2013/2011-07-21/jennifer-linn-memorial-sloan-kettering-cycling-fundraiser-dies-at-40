Jennifer Goodman Linn, who founded
the most successful patient-run fundraiser at Memorial Sloan-
Kettering Cancer Center, died yesterday after a long battle with
the disease. She was 40.  Linn, the subject of a 2009 Bloomberg News column, in 2007
founded Cycle for Survival, which has raised more than $9
million, according to the New York-based hospital’s  website . The
event has been the biggest patient-run fundraiser, according to
the center.  “Jen taught us all to live fearlessly, and that each of us
has the power to truly make a difference,” a post on the Cycle
for Survival website said. “She inspired us and countless
others, and words cannot express how deeply she will be
missed.”  More than 4,500 indoor cyclists participated in this year’s
 Cycle for Survival . Proceeds are allocated to the most promising
research and clinical trials of rare cancers.  Linn was diagnosed with sarcoma in 2004.  Services are scheduled for tomorrow at Riverside Memorial
Chapel in  Manhattan , where Linn lived with her husband, Dave.
Linn asked that donations be made to Cycle for Survival,
according to  Youfearless.com , the website she started to
document her illness.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
