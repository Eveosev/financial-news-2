What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Soybean futures may open 1 cent to 3 cents a bushel higher on
the  Chicago  Board of Trade on increased  U.S. export sales ,  Mark Schultz , the chief analyst for Minneapolis-based Northstar
Commodity Investment Co., said in a telephone interview.
Soybean-meal futures may open up $1 to $2 for 2,000 pounds, and
soybean-oil futures are expected to open steady to down 0.1 cent
a pound.  -- Corn futures are called to open 2 cents to 5 cents a bushel
lower in Chicago as rain in Iowa and Nebraska, two of the three
biggest U.S. producers, may ease the risk of crop damage from a
heat wave, while forecasts show less-threatening conditions in
parts of the Midwest during the next two weeks, Schultz said.  -- Wheat futures may open 1 cent a bushel lower to 1 cent higher
on the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  as a weaker dollar reduces the cost of supplies
from the U.S., which today reported exports last week were 36
percent below the average of the previous four weeks, Schultz
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
