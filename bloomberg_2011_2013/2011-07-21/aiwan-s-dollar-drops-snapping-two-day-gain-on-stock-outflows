Taiwan ’s dollar reversed earlier
gains as overseas investors cut holdings of the island’s stocks
and on speculation importers sold the local currency to take
advantage of a favorable  exchange rate .  Global funds sold $116 million more Taiwanese stocks than
they bought today, extending this month’s net sales to $1.7
billion, exchange data show. Export orders climbed 9.2 percent
in June from a year earlier, the slowest growth in four months,
the government reported yesterday.  “Looks like there was some demand for the  U.S. dollar  from
importers toward the end of trading,” said Tarsicio Tong, a
Taipei-based foreign-exchange trader at the Union Bank of Taiwan.  The Taiwan dollar declined 0.1 percent to NT$28.890 against
its U.S. counterpart as of the 4 p.m. local close, according to
Taipei Forex Inc. The currency will likely trade between
NT$28.79 and NT$29.00 in the near future, Tong said.  Government bonds  declined. The yield on the 2 percent notes
due July 2016, the most-traded government debt, rose one basis
point to 1.20 percent, prices from Gretai Securities Market show.  The overnight money-market rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, was little changed at 0.377 percent from
0.376 percent yesterday, according to a weighted average
compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
