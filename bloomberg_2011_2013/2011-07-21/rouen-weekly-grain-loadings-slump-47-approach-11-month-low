Grain loadings for export from the
French port of Rouen,  Europe ’s biggest cereal-shipping hub,
slumped 47 percent in the latest week to near an 11-month low
without the repetition of a wheat cargo for Cuba.  Outbound shipments were 40,840 metric tons from July 14 to
20, the  Seine River port  said in an e-mailed statement today,
down from 77,771 tons a week earlier. Loadings were 40,713 tons
in the week ended July 6, the lowest level since at least the
start of August last year.  Algeria was the biggest export destination in the latest
week with 25,070 tons of wheat, compared with 25,250 tons in the
prior week. Cuba, the destination for a 27,500-ton wheat cargo
the previous week, was absent as a buyer.  Rouen accounted for 45 percent of  France ’s wheat exports in
2009-10, ahead of La Pallice on the Bay of Biscay, which shipped
out 19 percent, according to data from national crops office
FranceAgriMer.  Rouen grain loadings by destination, in tons:  To contact the reporter on this story:
