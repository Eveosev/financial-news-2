Workers at  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) ’s
Escondida copper mine, the world’s largest, began a 24-hour
strike after failing to agree with the company over production-
related bonuses, a union leader said.  The strike by all union members at the northern Chilean
mine began at 8 p.m. New York time with the changing of a shift
and will run through to 8 p.m. tomorrow, union leader Jose Vidal
said by telephone. The protest may lead to about 3,000 metric
tons of lost copper production, he said.  The strike follows a one-day stoppage by union members at
Codelco, Chile’s state-owned copper producer, on July 11 to
protest planned job cuts as management revamps century-old mines.
Escondida’s operations were halted by unusual rains in  Chile ’s
Atacama Desert earlier this month, Marcelo Tapia, a union
official, said July 7.  BHP owns 57.5 percent of Escondida and its share of output
in the year through June was 390,500 tons, it said. Rio Tinto
Group owns 30 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
