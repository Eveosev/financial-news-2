Colt Group SA (COLT) , a U.K. provider of
networking and data services, posted a 62 percent drop in first-
half profit as mobile termination rates declined. The shares
dropped the most in four years.  Net income fell to 17.2 million euros ($24 million) from
45.6 million euros a year earlier, the London-based company said
in a regulatory statement today. Sales dropped 3.5 percent to
766.2 million euros. The company took a 5.1 million-euro tax
charge for the period, compared with an 11.2 million-euro credit
a year earlier.  “While economic conditions remain challenging, we continue
to see signs of improved pipeline,” Chief Executive Officer
Rakesh Bhasin said in the statement. “We expect incremental
growth in the latter part of the year.”  Managed services revenue grew 4.3 percent to 86.6 million
euros while voice sales declined 11.3 percent to 279 million
euros. Data sales climbed 1 percent to 400.6 million euros.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization decreased from 158.2 million euros to 157.2 million
euros.  “Ebitda was essentially flat last year on reduced revenues
which means we control our costs and deliver the same level of
profit on lower revenues,” Chief Financial Officer Mark Ferrari
said in a telephone interview.  There is “little evidence” of signs of improved pipelines
and incremental growth, Investec Securities’ analysts Morten Singleton and James Goodman wrote in a note to clients today.  Investec, which has a target price of 165 pence on Colt
under review, changed its recommendation on the company to
“hold” from “buy,” adding that the stock “is going to drift
for a while.”  Colt shares fell 14 percent to 114 pence at the 4:30 p.m.
close in  London , the biggest decrease since July 2006. The
shares have fallen 17 percent this year, giving the company a
market value of 1 billion pounds ($1.6 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
