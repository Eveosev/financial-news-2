MetLife Inc. (MET) , the biggest U.S. life
insurer, is exploring the sale of its deposit-gathering business
to avoid tighter regulation that comes with bank status.  “We do not believe it is appropriate for the overwhelming
majority of our business to be governed by regulations written
for banking institutions,” Chief Executive Officer Steven Kandarian said today in a statement.  MetLife is seeking to avoid stronger federal oversight
imposed on banks after government bailouts in 2008 prompted
Congress to increase regulation through the Dodd-Frank Act. New
York-based MetLife, which opted against accepting U.S. Treasury
Department capital, said it got about 2 percent of operating
earnings from its banking unit in the first quarter.  “This would be positive,” said  Randy Binner , an analyst
with FBR Capital Markets, who has an “outperform” rating on
MetLife. “Previously, the conventional wisdom was that Met was
a bank holding company, and it was going to be difficult to
change that reality.”  MetLife rose $1.15, or 2.8 percent, to $42.04 at 4:15 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The company has
fallen 5.4 percent this year.  MetLife said the business that may be sold includes  savings
accounts , certificates of deposits and money-market accounts.
The insurer plans to continue lending through its residential
mortgage business. MetLife Bank began in 2001 and expanded
through acquisition in 2008. The unit had total assets of $15.6
billion, including $9.3 billion in deposits as of March 31.  ‘Unequal Competitive Grounds’  “This is such a small portion of their business, and yet
under Dodd-Frank and various other issues, the tail might wag
the dog,” said John Nadel, an analyst at Sterne Agee & Leach
Inc., who has a “buy” rating on MetLife. Being regulated as a
 bank holding company  “would put them on very significant
unequal competitive grounds against all the companies they
compete against day to day.”  MetLife and  Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU) , the second-biggest
life insurer, are pushing federal regulators to refrain from
applying bank capital standards to insurance companies.  Newark ,
New Jersey-based Prudential isn’t a bank holding company and,
like rivals, including MetLife, has insurance operations
regulated by individual U.S. states.  “In a highly competitive global insurance marketplace, it
is imperative that MetLife be able to operate on a level playing
field with other insurance companies,” Kandarian said.  The  Federal Reserve , which regulates bank holding
companies, had no comment, said  Barbara Hagenbaugh , a
spokeswoman. Kandarian wasn’t available for an interview, said
 Christopher Breslin , a spokesman for MetLife.  Systemically Important  MetLife may face scrutiny as a so-called systemically
important financial institution, or SIFI, whether or not it
retains the banking assets. MetLife and Prudential have said
that because of their size they may be labeled SIFIs by federal
regulators.  While SIFI designations would subject the companies to
tighter standards, the rules may be less strict on MetLife if it
isn’t a bank holding company, Binner and Nadel said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
