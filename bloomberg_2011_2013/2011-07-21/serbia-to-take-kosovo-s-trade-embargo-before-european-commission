Serbia  will ask the European
Commission and  United Nations  to mediate a dispute over Kosovo’s
ban on imports of Serbian goods, saying it violates a free-trade
agreement.  The embargo violates the Central European Free Trade
Agreement, a European Union initiative, and jeopardizes supplies
for Serbs and other populations in Kosovo, government spokesman
Milivoje Mihajlovic told reporters in Belgrade today. Serbian
exports to its former province, which declared independence in
2008, totaled $391 million in 2010 and $161  million in the
first five months, according to the Serbian Chamber of Commerce.  “It’s a unilateral act that violates CEFTA,” Mihajlovic
said, referring to the trade pact between Serbia, Montenegro,
Bosnia-Herzegovina,  Croatia , Macedonia, Albania, Moldova and
 Kosovo .  Kosovo imposed the ban on July 20 in retaliation for
Serbia’s refusal to recognize its documents and customs stamps,
a consequence of Serbia’s rejection to recognize it as a state.  The trade dispute escalated just days after EU-mediated
talks between Serbia and Kosovo over energy, transportation,
telecommunications and other non-political issues were suspended
until September.  Kosovo also imposed a 10 percent tax on imports from
Bosnia-Herzegovina, which also refuses to recognize Kosovo’s
secession from Serbia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
