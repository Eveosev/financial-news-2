The biggest risk to  South Africa ’s
economy from the European debt crisis is through “contagion”
and a slump in global economic growth, Finance Minister  Pravin Gordhan  said.  South Africa’s direct exposure to Portugal, Ireland, Italy,
Greece and Spain is “reasonably low,” Gordhan wrote in a
column in Johannesburg-based Business Day today. Those countries
account for about 5 percent of South Africa’s exports to  Europe ,
he wrote.  The rand has dropped 1.3 percent against the dollar this
month, while bond yields jumped in June as concern spread that
Italy and Spain may be engulfed by the debt crisis. A default in
Italy, which has the biggest sovereign debt market in the euro
zone, would be a “disaster” for the global economy, Gordhan
wrote.  “The prospect of sustained stress in Italian and other
euro-region bond markets will increase  risk aversion  and
potentially stymie Europe’s already weak recovery, transmitting
the effects to South Africa and other parts of the world,”
Gordhan said.  The debt crisis illustrates the need for sustainable budget
deficits, faster economic growth and improved fiscal spending in
South Africa, Gordhan said. The government can use foreign
currency reserves of $50 billion “in an extreme crisis,” he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
