Any euro-area agreement on a second
aid package for  Greece  might include a selective default on
Greek debt, Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  said
while stressing other options would be preferable.  “I am not in charge of explaining if yes or no there will
be a selective default,” Juncker told reporters today in
Brussels before a meeting of euro-area leaders. “You can never
exclude such a possibility, but everything should be done in
order to avoid such a possibility.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
