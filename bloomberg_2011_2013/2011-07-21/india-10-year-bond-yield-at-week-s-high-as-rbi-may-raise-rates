India’s 10-year bond yields held
near a one-week high on speculation the central bank will
increase  interest rates  at a policy review on July 26.  The  Reserve Bank  of India will raise the repurchase rate by
25 basis points to 7.75 percent, according to 19 of 21
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Two forecast no change. The
rate was last boosted by a similar amount on June 16 to lower an
inflation rate that’s exceeded 8 percent for 18 months.  “The high-inflationary environment is not going away
anytime soon,” Leif Eskesen, Singapore-based chief economist at
HSBC Holdings Plc, wrote in a research report published today.
“The RBI is still likely to consider inflation as the dominant
concern and continue to tighten.”  The yield on the 7.8 percent government debt due April 2021
was little changed at 8.27 percent at the 5 p.m. close in
Mumbai, according to central bank data. It climbed to 8.28
percent yesterday, the highest level since July 13.  The central bank may raise its benchmark rate to 8.25
percent by March, according to Eskesen. The monetary authority
has boosted borrowing costs 10 times since the start of 2010.  India ’s wholesale-price index rose 9.44 percent in June
from a year earlier after climbing 9.06 percent the previous
month, according to government data. The pace of price gains may
slow to at least 7 percent by March, Finance Minister Pranab
Mukherjee said in  New Delhi  today.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 7.92
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
