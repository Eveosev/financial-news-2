Banco Sabadell SA, a Spanish retail
bank, will probably miss its targets for credit growth as demand
slumps in a sluggish economy, Chief Executive Officer Jaime Guardiola said.  “We are not able to fulfill our objectives for credit,”
Guardiola said on a webcast for reporters today to discuss
second-quarter earnings, which slumped 36 percent from a year
earlier. “Credit is not going to grow in this country for the
next few years and that is very clear.”  Spain ’s banks are seeing shrinking demand for loans as the
economy sputters, at the same time that doubts about the
finances of  Europe ’s debt-ridden nations drives up funding
costs. Sabadell announced targets in January, including adding 1
million new retail and 160,000 corporate clients through 2013,
and boosting average annual lending growth by 5 percent.  Second-quarter net income fell to 81.05 million euros from
126.44 million euros a year ago, the bank said in a filing to
regulators today. Earnings compared with the 73 million-euro
average estimate in a Bloomberg survey of six analyst forecasts.  Net interest income fell 1.4 percent to 385.4 million
euros, Sabadell said. Bad loans as a proportion of total loans
climbed to 5.55 percent from 4.38 percent a year before, the
lender said.  Costs for covering bad loans fell 59 percent from a year
ago to 215.5 million euros, the bank said. Personnel costs
climbed 8.3 percent from a year ago to 178.7 million euros, the
bank said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
