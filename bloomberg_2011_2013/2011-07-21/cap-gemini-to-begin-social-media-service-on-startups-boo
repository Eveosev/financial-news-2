Cap Gemini SA (CAP)  will begin offering a
service to analyze social media activity, pushing into an area
of  information technology  increasingly targeted by start-ups.  The Paris-based computer services company will partner with
Attensity, a provider of social-media monitoring software, it
said in an e-mailed statement. The service builds on a pilot
project already in use with 20 customers.  Information technology firms are looking for an edge in
helping clients make the most of services like Facebook and
Twitter as nimbler start-ups offer their own competing
solutions.  International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) , the worldâ€™s
largest technology services company, earlier this year opened a
new division devoted to helping clients develop social media
marketing.  Spending on social software that supports sales, marketing,
and customer service will exceed $1 billion worldwide next year,
according to researcher Gartner Inc. Such software helps
businesses track trends and respond to criticism or praise
online.  For IT companies, social media is one of a number of new
business areas being targeted to offset dependence on slower-
growing traditional computer services. Both  Cap Gemini  and
French rival Atos SA have begun pushes into energy management,
with the latter setting up a new division.  To contact the reporter on this story:
