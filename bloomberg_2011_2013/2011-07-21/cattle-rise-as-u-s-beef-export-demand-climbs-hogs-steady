Cattle futures rose on signs of
increasing export demand for U.S. beef. Hog prices were little

metric tons (9.2 million pounds), government data show. U.S.
 exporters  have shipped 1.09 billion pounds in the five months
ended May 31, up 27 percent from a year earlier.  The data on shipments was “good news for the market,”
 Dennis Smith , a senior account executive at Archer Financial
Services Inc., said in a telephone interview from Chicago. “We
were hearing that the export business was going really well.”  Cattle futures for October delivery rose 0.25 cent, or 0.2
percent, to $1.1555 a pound at 10:55 a.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. Earlier, the price climbed as much as 0.9
