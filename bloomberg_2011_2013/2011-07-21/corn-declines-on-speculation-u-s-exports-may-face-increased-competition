Soybean futures advanced for a
second day on optimism  China , the world’s biggest buyer, may
sustain purchases from the U.S.  November-delivery soybeans gained 0.5 percent to $13.915 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade at 3:01 p.m. Singapore time,
after trading between $13.765 and $13.9275.  Exporters in the U.S., the world’s largest shipper of
soybeans, sold 220,000 metric tons to China for delivery in the
marketing year that begins Sept. 1, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said yesterday.  “The oilseed data showed some positive sentiment” helping
push prices higher, Ker Chung Yang, an analyst at Phillip
Futures Pte said by phone from Singapore today.  December-delivery corn was little changed at $6.78 a bushel
on the Chicago Board of Trade, after retreating as much as 1.4
percent earlier.  Wheat for September delivery rose 0.6 percent to $7.0125 a
bushel in  Chicago , swinging from a 2 percent loss earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
