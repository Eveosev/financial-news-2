Iran ’s Foreign Ministry warned that
a U.S. attack on Syria would drag the whole region into
conflict.  “We want to strongly warn against any use of military
force in Syria,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Araghchi told
reporters in Tehran today, in televised comments. “There will
definitely be great consequences for the region and
complications will not be restricted to Syria, they will engulf
the whole region.”  Iran is a longtime Syrian ally.  Araghchi spoke a day after Secretary of State John Kerry
said there is “undeniable” evidence the Syrian government used
chemical weapons outside Damascus on Aug. 21. Kerry called the
alleged attack a “moral obscenity” as pressure mounted on the
U.S. to go beyond denunciations and take military action against
the Syrian government.  Some Syrian opposition groups say more than 1,300 people
were killed, an allegation that has not been confirmed.  Araghchi condemned the use of chemical weapons “under any
conditions by anyone” while accusing the U.S. and allies of
using the alleged attack as a “pretext” to strike  Syria .
Araghchi said the attack was carried out by “terrorist
groups.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
