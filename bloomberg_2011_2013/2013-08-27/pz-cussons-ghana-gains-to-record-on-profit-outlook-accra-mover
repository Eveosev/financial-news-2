PZ Cussons Plc (PZC) ’s Ghanaian  unit , a
distributer of consumer goods, rose to the highest on record on
speculation the shut down of a manufacturing unit in the West
African nation will cut costs and boost profit.  The stock gained 10 percent to 55 pesewas by the close in
Accra, the highest since April 1995 when Bloomberg began
compiling data on the company. It was the best performer today
on the Ghana Stock Exchange’s Composite Index. PZ shut a factory
in the port city of Tema in December, Charles Janney, director
of human resources and corporate affairs, said by phone.  The shut down is “expected to cut overhead and operational
costs, Randy Mensah, a stock trader at Ecobank Development
Corp., said by phone. ‘‘Profit is expected to increase as the
company imports the goods for sale in  Ghana .’’  PZ’s net income jumped to 7.9 million cedis ($3.7 million)
in the financial year to May 31 from 763,610 cedis a year
before, the company said on Aug. 2. Revenue climbed 16 percent
to 95.7 million cedis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
