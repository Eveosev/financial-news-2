Crude oil call options surged as
futures rallied on concern that supplies from the Middle East
may be disrupted if the U.S. and its allies attack  Syria  over
its use of chemical weapons against civilians.  Implied volatility of October calls protecting against a 10
percent rise in futures prices jumped to 29.39 percent at 2:15
p.m. from 22.73 yesterday as futures gained the most since May
2. Volatility for puts covering a 10 percent drop was little
changed, climbing to 25.58 percent from 25.23.  “Because of the imminent strike and risk to supply, people
are trying to hedge their position, buying options in case of
worst case scenario or you’re just adventurous and want to try
and capitalize on a big move in the market,” said Phil Flynn,
senior market analyst at Price Futures Group in  Chicago . “Vol
could go up again tomorrow if they are striking on Thursday.”  Implied volatility for at-the-money October options, a key
gauge of options value, was 24.44 percent on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange, up from 21.22 percent yesterday. Volatility
for the nearest-month options is at the highest level since May
