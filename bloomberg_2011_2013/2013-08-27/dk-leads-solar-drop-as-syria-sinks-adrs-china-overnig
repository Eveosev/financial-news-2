Chinese solar stocks fell in  New
York , with  LDK Solar Co. (LDK)  tumbling the most in three months,
after its cash balance dropped to the lowest level since 2009
and second-quarter sales sank 51 percent.  The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Chinese stocks in the U.S. slid 1.6 percent to 95.36 yesterday,
the biggest retreat in eight weeks. LDK, the world’s second-biggest maker of solar wafers, fell the most since May 22, and
Yingli Green Energy Holding Co. dropped 6.7 percent.  Noah
Holdings Ltd. (NOAH)  extended a two-day slump to 23 percent. China
Southern Airlines Co. widened the discount to its Hong Kong
shares after reporting an operating loss.  The China-US gauge joined a global stock market rout on
concern the U.S. will take military action against  Syria . LDK,
which reported a ninth consecutive quarterly loss and a drop in
sales, has $2.8 billion in debt and ended the second quarter
with $85.1 million in cash. The amount won’t suffice to make
today’s bond payment, Chief Financial Officer Jack Lai said
yesterday in a conference call with analysts.  “LDK, one of the biggest names in the industry, is taking
a big hit itself because of a rapidly decline in cash balance
and it’s highly indebted,” Angelo Zino, an analyst at  Standard
& Poor’s  in New York, said in a phone interview yesterday. “We
probably didn’t see enough along the lines of when these guys
can come back to some type of break even levels.”  The iShares China Large-Cap ETF, the largest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., declined 1.7 percent to
$35.08. The  S&P 500 Index  slid 1.6 percent.  LDK’s Loss  American depositary receipts of LDK retreated 12 percent to
$1.53 in New York, trimming this year’s advance to 6.3 percent.
Trading volume was twice the three-month average, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  LDK’s second-quarter loss narrowed to $165.3 million from
$254.3 million a year earlier. Sales slumped to $114.7 million
from $235.4 million. The company expects third-quarter shipments
of 350 megawatts to 450 megawatts of wafers and as much as 80
megawatts of cells and modules.  “It doesn’t look like its shipments will even get the
company close toward a break-even level over the next couple of
quarters,” S&P’s Zino said.  The delay in a bond payment was expected given its
financial position, according to Zino. LDK is seeking to
restructure its liabilities and raise capital, Chairman Peng
Xiaofeng said yesterday on the call. The company failed to fully
repay $23.8 million in bonds due April 15.  Yingli, Noah  Baoding, China-based Yingli, the world’s largest solar-panel maker, sank to $4.07 in the biggest decline since June 20.
 Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL) , based in Changzhou, fell 5.3 percent to $8.81.  Noah Holdings, which sells wealth-management products for
commissions, slid 7 percent to $12.73 in New York. The stock
posted the biggest two-day slump since September 2011. Volume
was almost six times the 90-day average, data compiled by
Bloomberg showed. JPMorgan & Chase Co. cut its recommendation on
the stock to neutral from the equivalent of buy on Aug. 23.  YY Inc. (YY) , an entertainment social media company, tumbled 5.9
percent to $39.19, sinking the most since Aug. 15.  ADRs of China Southern,  Asia ’s biggest airline by traffic,
dropped 4.1 percent to $17.89.  Its ADRs, each representing 50
underlying shares in the Guangzhou-based carrier, traded 1.2
percent below its Hong Kong-traded stock.  China Southern’s net income in the six months ended in June
fell 19 percent to 344 million  yuan  ($56.2 million). That lagged
behind the 516 million-yuan average profit estimate of five
analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News . The operating loss was 114
million yuan.  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index retreated 0.9 percent
to 9,988.23 in the biggest drop in a week. The Shanghai
Composite Index added 0.3 percent to 2,103.57, the highest level
since Aug. 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
