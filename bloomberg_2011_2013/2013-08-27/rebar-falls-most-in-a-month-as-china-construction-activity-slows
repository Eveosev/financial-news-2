Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  declined by the most in almost a month on concern that
slowing purchases for construction projects may reduce demand.  Rebar for delivery in January on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange retreated as much as 1 percent, the most since July 29,
to 3,776  yuan  ($617) a metric ton and was at 3,784 yuan at 10:05
a.m. local time. That pared this month’s advance to 3.8 percent.  Rebar for immediate delivery fell for a fourth day
yesterday, by 0.1 percent to 3,606 yuan a ton, according to
Beijing Antaike Information Development Co. Inventory in China
on Aug. 23 rose 0.1 percent to 6.6 million tons, the first  climb 
since April 5, according to Shanghai Steelhome Information
Technology Co.  “Demand from construction sites is still low while
supplies have increased, so the market is weakening,” Shanghai
Cifco Futures Co. said in a research report.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port gained 0.1
percent to $138.70 a dry ton yesterday, according to a  price
index  compiled by The Steel Index Ltd.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
