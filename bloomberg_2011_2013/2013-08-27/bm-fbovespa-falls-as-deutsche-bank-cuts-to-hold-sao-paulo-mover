BM&FBovespa SA (BVMF3) , Latin America’s
biggest exchange operator, fell the most in a week after
Deutsche Bank AG cut its rating on concern volumes will decline
as interest rates rise and investors sour on Brazilian stocks.  The shares  declined  2.9 percent to 11.56 reais at 12:56
p.m. in Sao Paulo, poised for the biggest drop on a closing
basis since Aug. 19. It was the worst performance on the  MSCI
Brazil/Financials index , which lost 2.3 percent.  Deutsche Bank cut its rating on the stock to hold from buy
and reduced its forecast for net income next year by 18 percent.
 Brazil ’s Ibovespa is the world’s second-worst performing major
stock index this year in dollar terms, and the 25 percent drop
in shares of BM&FBovespa is the most among securities-exchange
operators with a market capitalization of $1 billion or more,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “We are concerned about a potential slowdown in trading
volumes in light of a rising interest rate environment and
increased risk aversion towards Brazil,” analysts  Mario Pierry 
and Tito Labarta wrote in a note to clients today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
