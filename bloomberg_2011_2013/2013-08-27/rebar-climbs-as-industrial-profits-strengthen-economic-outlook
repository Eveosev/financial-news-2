Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  rose to the highest almost two weeks on speculation of
rising demand after a government report showed profit growth for
industrial companies accelerated.  Rebar for delivery in January on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange rose 0.1 percent to 3,818  yuan  ($624) a metric ton, the
highest close since Aug. 15 for a most-active contract. Futures,
which reversed an earlier decline today after the report, have
advanced 4.8 percent this month.  Industrial-profit growth rebounded in July, adding to signs
that the world’s second-biggest economy is stabilizing after a
two-quarter slowdown. Net income rose 12 percent from a year
earlier after gaining 6.3 percent in June, the statistics bureau
said in Beijing today.  “The economy is generally seen turning stronger, and
that’s bullish for rebar’s demand outlook,” said Huang Huiwen,
analyst at Shanghai Cifco Futures Co.  Rebar for immediate delivery fell 0.1 percent today to
3,604 yuan a ton, according to Beijing Antaike Information
Development Co.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port
gained 0.1 percent to $138.70 a dry ton yesterday, according to
a  price index  compiled by The Steel Index Ltd.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
