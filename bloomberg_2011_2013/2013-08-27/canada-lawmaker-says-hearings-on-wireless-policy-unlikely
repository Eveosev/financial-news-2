A House of Commons committee voted
down a proposal by the country’s biggest opposition party to
hold hearings on the government’s wireless-industry policies.  The  New Democratic Party  forced a meeting of the industry
committee today to discuss whether to hold hearings on the
government’s planned wireless spectrum auction. The closed-door
meeting ended quickly, leading the opposition to say the
committee’s majority of governing Conservative lawmakers voted
down the motion.  “In light of this very short meeting, we don’t believe
there will be public hearings,” NDP lawmaker Glenn Thibeault
said in an e-mailed statement. No further meetings are
scheduled, according to the committee’s  website .  The country’s three biggest wireless providers are pressing
the Canadian government to change the rules for the January
auction, which they say favor foreign carriers such as  Verizon
Communications Inc. (VZ)  The government has rejected the calls,
saying it wants to promote competition and lower prices.  A spokeswoman for Industry Minister  James Moore  didn’t
immediately return an e-mail sent after office hours seeking
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
