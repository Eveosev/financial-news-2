Uniqa Insurance Group AG,  Austria â€™s
second-biggest insurer, rose the most in two years after its
quarterly net income more than doubled on higher insurance
premiums.  The shares climbed as much as 6.9 percent to 10.95 euros,
the steepest intraday gain since August 2011. Uniqa traded 5.3
percent higher at 10.78 euros at 11:23 a.m. in Vienna. The
number of shares trading hands was double the average three-month daily volume.  Second-quarter net income rose to 74.6 million euros ($99.5
million) from 26.9 million euros a year earlier, the Vienna-based company said today in a  statement  on its website. Gross
premiums rose 6.7 percent to 1.2 billion euros.  Uniqa reiterated that profit from its ordinary activities
will increase this year. The company is planning to sell new
stock by the end of next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
