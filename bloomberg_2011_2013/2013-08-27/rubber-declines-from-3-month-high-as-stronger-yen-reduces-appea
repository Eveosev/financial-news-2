Rubber dropped from a three-month
high as Japan’s currency appreciated, cutting the appeal of yen-based futures that entered a  bull market  yesterday.  Rubber for delivery in January on Tokyo Commodity Exchange
fell as much as 0.7 percent to 275 yen a kilogram ($2,800 a
metric ton) and traded at 275.6 yen at 10:43 a.m. The drop pared
gains for the most-active contract to 15 percent this month, the
most since December.  The yen climbed to 98.05 per dollar, rebounding from a
three-week low reached Aug. 23, after U.S. Secretary of State
 John Kerry  said President  Barack Obama  will hold Syria
accountable for using chemical weapons against its people. The
yen also gained after a report yesterday showed U.S. durable
goods orders fell in July for the first time since March.  “The yen was bought as a haven amid rising tensions in the
 Middle East , leading to sales of futures in Tokyo,” said
Hideshi Matsunaga, an analyst at broker ACE Koeki Co.  Bookings for goods meant to last at least three years
decreased 7.3 percent last month in the U.S., the most since
August 2012, after a 3.9 percent gain in June, the Commerce
Department said yesterday. The median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg called for a 4 percent drop.  Rubber for delivery in January lost 0.8 percent to 20,530
 yuan  ($3,353) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange. Thai
rubber free-on-board added 1.2 percent to 83.95 baht ($2.62) a
kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research Institute
of Thailand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
