Total SA (FP)  said it reached an
agreement to buy  Chevron Corp. (CVX) ’s  Egypt  retail and aviation
businesses, the company’s second acquisition in Egypt this year.  The French oil company and Beltone Private Equity managed
funds will acquire 66 service stations, two oil depots and
aviation fuel operations at the Cairo and Marsa Alam airports,
according to a joint e-mailed statement today. The deal is set
to make Total Egypt the biggest marketing and services
subsidiary of its parent company outside Europe.  The government is short of cash to pay $5.4 billion it owes
to international oil companies, Oil Minister Sherif Ismail said
last week, as the upheaval following the military’s July
overthrow of president Mohamed Mursi scares away tourists and
foreign investors. Total’s investment is the second in Egypt
this year after buying  Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) ’s retail and commercial
fuel operations in May, according to the statement.  The purchase “is fully aligned with our strategy of growth
in the Middle East,” Thomas Rebeyrol, managing director of
Total Egypt, said in the statement. Once the Chevron and Shell
deals are complete, Paris-based Total projects annual sales in
Egypt of more than 3 million metric tons and a 14 percent share
of the country’s service stations, according to the statement.  The value of the deal wasn’t disclosed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
