Russia will export 17 cargoes of
East Siberia-Pacific Ocean, or ESPO, crude from the Pacific port
of Kozmino in October, one less than in September.  Kozmino will load 1.7 million metric tons, or about 402,000
barrels a day, of ESPO blend, according to a loading program
obtained by  Bloomberg News . Two of the shipments, which are in
lots of 100,000 tons each, will be transported by rail from
Skovorodino and the rest through a pipeline. Daily shipments
will fall 8.6 percent from the September level.  The ESPO link starts at fields in East Siberia. A second
phase of the project completed in December expanded the
pipelineâ€™s capacity and extended it to the Pacific coast at
Kozmino, reducing the need for rail shipments.  The October program includes a 100,000-ton rail consignment
for loading Oct. 30 to Nov. 2 and a partial rail cargo of 32,000
tons to be topped up at Kozmino in November.  OAO Rosneft and OAO Surgutneftegas will each export six of
the October consignments, OAO Lukoil and OAO Gazprom Neft will
ship one cargo each, and the remaining three are earmarked for
smaller producers.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
