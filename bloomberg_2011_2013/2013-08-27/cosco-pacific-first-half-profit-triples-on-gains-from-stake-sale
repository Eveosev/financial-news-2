Cosco Pacific Ltd. (1199) , the container-terminal arm of China’s biggest shipping group, said first-half
profit more than tripled, boosted by gains from selling its
stake in the world’s largest container maker.  Net income  increased to $560.3 million in the six months to
June from $179 million a year earlier, the company said in a
 Hong Kong  stock exchange  statement  today. Sales rose 7.6 percent
to $395 million.  Cosco Pacific had a gain of $393.4 million from selling its
holding in  China International Marine Containers Group Co. (2039)  to
its parent earlier this year. The company’s controlling
shareholder  China Cosco Holdings Co. (1919)  is restructuring assets in
a bid to return to profitability as a third straight annual loss
may result in its shares being delisted in Shanghai.  Excluding the share of profit from China International
Marine and gains from the stake sale, Cosco Pacific’s profit
fell 3.6 percent to $143.8 million in the first half.  Shares of Cosco Pacific fell 1.4 percent to HK$11.14 as of
1:03 p.m. in Hong Kong. The company, part of the  Hang Seng
Index , has gained 0.9 percent this year, compared with the
gauge’s 3.7 percent drop.  Cosco Pacific’s terminals, which are predominantly in
China, handled 9.7 percent more containers in the first half.
The company also has interests in terminals in Greece, Hong Kong
and Singapore.  The company proposed to pay a special interim dividend of
43.8 Hong Kong cents per share and an interim dividend of 18.6
Hong Kong cents, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
