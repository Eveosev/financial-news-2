State-owned Kuwait Oil Co. is
seeking bids to build a water-treatment and injection plant to
help boost crude production in the countryâ€™s north, MEED said on
its website without citing anybody.  Fourteen prequalified contractors for the water-injection
project to maintain pressure and production levels for the
Sabriya and Raudhatain fields in northern Kuwait and collect
effluent water include  Foster Wheeler AG (FWLT)  from the U.S.,  Petrofac
Ltd. (PFC)  of the U.K. and  Hyundai Engineering & Construction Co. (000720) ,
