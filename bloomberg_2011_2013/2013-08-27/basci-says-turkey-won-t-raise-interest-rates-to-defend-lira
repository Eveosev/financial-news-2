Turkey’s central bank Governor Erdem Basci said he won’t increase  interest rates  to fight a deepening
slump in the lira, and instead promised to use “surprise”
tools to reverse the trend.  The bank has $40 billion in reserves it can use to defend
the lira, which fell to a record low against the dollar today,
Basci said in a televised interview with state-run AAFinans. He
said the bank won’t change its overnight lending rates, the top
end of its interest-rate corridor, and will later announce “new
tools” to support the currency.  Basci increased the lending rate this month and last, and
has spent $8.7 billion buying liras since June 11. The Turkish
currency has fallen 12 percent against the dollar this year, the
second-most among currencies in  Europe ,  Africa  and the  Middle
East  after  South Africa ’s rand, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The slide in emerging-market currencies began in May
when the U.S. Federal Reserve signaled it may scale back its
monetary stimulus.  Basci’s comments ruling out higher interest rates was
“negative for the lira in our view, given the U.S. Fed
uncertainty,” Ibrahim Aksoy, an economist at Sekerbank AS in
Istanbul, said by e-mail as the central bank chief spoke.  The lira weakened 1.1 percent to 2.018 per dollar at midday
in Istanbul, after falling as much as 1.9 percent on Basci’s
comments. Yields on two-year benchmark  lira bonds  fell 14 basis
points, or 0.14 percentage point, to 10.02 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
