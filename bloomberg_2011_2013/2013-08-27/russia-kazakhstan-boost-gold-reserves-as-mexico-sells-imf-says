Russia and Kazakhstan expanded their
gold reserves for a 10th straight month in July as central banks
sought to diversify assets amid a rally in prices.  Mexico 
reduced its holdings.  Russian holdings, the seventh-largest by country, gained
about 6.3 metric tons to 1,002.8 tons, International Monetary
Fund data showed today. Kazakhstan’s reserves rose 1.1 tons to
about 132 tons and  Turkey  boosted holdings by 22.5 tons to 464
tons, the data showed.  Gold rallied 19 percent since reaching 34-month low in
June, climbing 7.4 percent in July, as lower prices boosted
demand for jewelry, coins and bars. Demand from central banks
may help counter  record outflows  from exchange-traded products
backed by physical bullion this year. Nations added 534.6 tons
to reserves last year, the most since 1964, and may buy a
further 350 tons this year, the World Gold Council estimates.  “I think this is a long-term trend that will continue,”
said Han Pin Hsi, Singapore-based global head of commodities
research at Standard Chartered Plc. “If we look at many
emerging countries, gold as a percentage of their total reserve
is still very low. And given the continued QE efforts by say the
central banks of developed countries, it makes sense for
countries to diversify and hold more reserves in gold.”  Bullion rose 70 percent from December 2008 to June 2011 as
the U.S. Federal Reserve pumped more than $2 trillion into the
financial system by purchasing debt, increasing investors’
concern about currency debasement and accelerating inflation.  Monthly Gain  Prices have slumped 16 percent this year amid speculation
the Fed may cut the $85 billion in monthly asset purchases,
known as quantitative easing, that helped bullion cap a 12-year
bull run last year. Spot gold lost 0.1 percent to $1,402.86 an
ounce at 3:23 p.m. in  Singapore  after touching $1,407.42, the
highest since June 7. Prices are up 5.9 percent in August.  Azerbaijan, the Kyrgyz Republic and  Guatemala  also added to
reserves in July, the IMF data show. Mexico reduced its holdings
for a 15th month to 123.8 tons, according to the data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
