The  New York  Mets sent team home-run
leader Marlon Byrd, catcher John Buck and cash to the Pittsburgh
Pirates for shortstop prospect Dilson Herrera.  The Mets also received a player to be named, the Major
League Baseball team said today in an e-mailed statement. The
Mets are 58-71, haven’t made the playoffs in six seasons and sit
14 1/2 games out of a postseason berth.  The Mets also announced that 24-year-old pitcher Matt Harvey has been placed on the 15-day disabled list. The National
League’s strikeout leader, Harvey has a partial tear in the
ulnar collateral ligament of his throwing elbow and is
considering Tommy John surgery, which would replace the damaged
connector.  Byrd is hitting .285 this season with 21 home runs and 71
runs batted in. The home run total is also a career high for the
35-year-old outfielder, who has played his 12-year career with
six different teams.  Buck’s 15 home runs are third on the team behind Byrd and
injured third baseman David Wright. The 33-year-old catcher hit
10 of those home runs in the first five weeks of the season, and
saw his playing time diminish when the Mets called up catching
prospect Travis d’Arnaud this month.  Herrera, 19, is hitting .265 with 11 home runs and 11
stolen bases in the Class A South Atlantic League. The Colombian
infielder played in the All-Star Game’s Future Game this year,
but wasn’t included among Baseball America’s June 2013 list of
the 10 best prospects in the Pirates’ organization.  Pittsburgh is 76-54, a half-game behind the St. Louis
Cardinals in the National League Central. The Pirates, who
currently hold a wild card spot, haven’t made the playoffs since
1992, which also was the team’s most-recent winning season.  To contact the reporters on this story:
