PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG) , Europe’s
second-largest carmaker, said it may beat a goal of reducing
cash consumption this year as new vehicles such as the 308
hatchback and 2008 crossover help the company boost prices.  The up-market model strategy “will help us to do better
than halving our cash burn this year,” Maxime Picat, head of
the Peugeot brand, said today in a Bloomberg Television
interview from the company’s car plant in Sochaux,  France . “The
global situation is improving, and it’s a good time to launch
the 308.” The stock climbed to the highest in almost 17 months.  Peugeot reported a 576 million-euro ($771 million)
 operating loss  in 2012 as deliveries fell faster than the
European car market contracted. The Paris-based company pledged
in February to cut its cash-consumption rate 50 percent in 2013
after burning through 3 billion euros last year. The strategy
includes closing a factory and cutting about 11,200 jobs by 2015
as well as adding more expensive models.  “Restructuring is coming through faster than expected,
with almost 60 percent of planned headcount reduction already
achieved,” David Lesne, a London-based analyst at UBS AG, said
today in a research report. Peugeot’s carmaking operations
“could achieve break-even” in the second half, said Lesne, who
raised his  recommendation  on the stock to buy from neutral.  Stock Rises  Peugeot  rose  as much as 4 percent to 11.80 euros, the
highest intraday price since April 2, 2012, and was trading up
0.3 percent at 11:33 a.m. in Paris. The stock has more than
doubled this year, valuing the company at 4.04 billion euros.  The new 308, scheduled to reach French dealerships on Sept.
12 as part of a “fast launch” throughout  Europe , will be “ a
very strategic model” targeted at the region’s mid-size vehicle
segment, Picat said today.  “We would like to be a reference generalist manufacturer,
but with a quality standard steadily approaching” those of
premium manufacturers, Picat said. “With the new 308, we will
achieve that very reference, benchmark level of quality.”  The model, marketed as a compact car for urban families,
will replace a version that went on sale in 2007, and will be
priced starting at 17,800 euros. It competes with  Volkswagen
AG (VOW) ’s best-selling Golf in Europe’s largest model segment. First-half sales of the current 308 totaled 115,950 cars, representing
14 percent of the Peugeot brand’s deliveries.  Frankfurt Show  The 308 will be on display at the International Motor Show
in  Frankfurt  next month and will enter showrooms in  Germany ,
 Italy  and  Spain  following the French dealer debut. The car will
be sold worldwide by the end of 2014, including vehicles to be
made in  China , the world’s largest auto market, Picat said.  Chief Executive Officer Philippe Varin outlined a plan in
February to upgrade Peugeot models to differentiate the brand
more from the Citroen division, which is meanwhile developing
its own up-market DS line.  The 308 is coming out four months after the introduction of
the 2008 compact sport-utility vehicle in May. Peugeot builds
the crossover in Mulhouse, France and plans to add production in
Wuhan, China, next year, and Porto Real,  Brazil , in 2015, when
it’s targeting 200,000 annual deliveries for the model.  “Expectations are definitely rising,”  Juergen Pieper , a
Frankfurt-based analyst at Bankhaus Metzler, said today in a
Bloomberg Television interview. “The products are better than
people expected.”  Market Share  The Peugeot and Citroen marques accounted for 11.1 percent
of car sales in Europe in the six months through June, a decline
from 12 percent a year earlier and 13.1 percent for all of  2007 ,
according to figures from the ACEA carmakers lobby. That
compares with an increase for the Volkswagen brand to 12.5
percent in the first half of 2013 from 10.5 percent in 2007, the
last year of industry growth in the region.  Including the Audi, Seat, Skoda and Porsche divisions,
Wolfsburg, Germany-based VW is Europe’s biggest carmaker, and
produces almost one in four autos sold in the region.  The current 308 ranked 10th in the so-called C segment in
Europe that was led by VW’s Golf,  Ford Motor Co. (F) ’s Focus and the
Bayerische Motoren Werke AG 1-Series, according to IHS
Automotive consulting company.  Cash Plan  Peugeot Citroen’s automotive division posted a 510 million-euro operating loss in the first half. The company reiterated
the 2013 goal of cutting the cash burn by at least 50 percent in
July, while holding back from repeating a plan to break even at
that level in 2014, saying only that it was targeting a “very
significant reduction” in cash burn that year.  “The real issue for Peugeot is Europe,” said Florent Couvreur, an analyst with CM-CIC Securities who recommends
selling the French manufacturer’s shares. “As long as they’re
not able to gain back market share, increase volumes and fill
their factories, they will keep on losing money.”  IHS Automotive estimates that sales of the 308 will jump 80
percent to almost 123,400 cars in 2014 in western Europe from
68,490 vehicles this year. IHS predicts VW will sell more than
340,200 Golfs in the region next year, down 4 percent from 2013.  Peugeot’s profit-restoration strategy includes cooperation
with Detroit-based  General Motors Co. (GM)  on developing new vehicles
and jointly buying components for their European operations. The
U.S. carmaker now owns 7 percent of its French counterpart as
part of the alliance.  “GM is the natural partner of Peugeot,” Pieper said. The
U.S. manufacturer is “likely” to raise its holding to 15
percent to 20 percent “to make sure they have important things
to say.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
