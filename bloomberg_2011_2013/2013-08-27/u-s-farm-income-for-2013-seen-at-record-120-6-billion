Record harvests for U.S. corn and
soybeans will reduce 2013 farm income from a previous estimate
as the bumper crops lower prices, the U.S. Agriculture
Department said today.  While the agency projected less farm income than it
forecast earlier this year, it still expects the figure to top
the previous record of $118 billion in 2011.  Net farm income in 2013 will be $120.6 billion, down 5.9
percent from a February forecast of $128.2 billion. The new
forecast is up 6 percent from a revised estimate of $113.8
billion for 2012, the USDA said in a  report  on its website.  The USDA figures released today tell a “very, very good
story, and a very positive story for much of U.S. agriculture,”
Patrick Westhoff, director of the Food and Agricultural Policy
Research Institute at the  University of Missouri , said in a
telephone interview.  “A bigger question is, what’s it going to look like a year
from now?” Westhoff said. Projected prices for farm commodities
are lower than they have been over the past two years, which
could translate into lower revenue for farmers in two or three
years, he said.  Farm Expenses  Total farm production expenses will increase 0.3 percent
from the USDA’s February estimate to $354.2 billion, the highest
level on record, in nominal and inflation-adjusted dollars. The
agency said it expects rent, labor and feed prices to increase
the most among farm expenses this year.  Among farmer costs, feed, the biggest spending component,
is projected to increase 3.7 percent from last year to $61.3
billion. Fertilizers made by  Potash Corp. (POT)  of Saskatchewan Inc.
and other companies will cost $28.2 billion this year, down 1
percent from last year, while seeds from  Monsanto Co. (MON)  and  DuPont
Co. (DD)  are up 4.9 percent to $21.3 billion.  “It’s important to note that while income numbers are
staying up at nice levels, production costs are continuing to
climb and climb,” Bob Young, chief economist for the American
Farm Bureau  Federation  in Washington, said in a phone interview.  The value of  crops  sold to companies such as Cargill Inc.
and  Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. (ADM)  will be $211.1 billion, down 2.4
percent from the February estimate, the USDA said today. Revenue
from livestock sales will increase 2 percent to $180.1 billion,
the USDA said.  “After adjusting for inflation, 2013’s net farm income is
expected to be the second highest since 1973,” the agency’s
 Economic Research Service  said in a  statement  on its website.  Depleted Inventories  Corn and soybean inventories depleted by last year’s
drought may more than double by 2014, the USDA said in a
separate report this month. Futures for the grain have dropped
27.6 percent percent so far this year before today, while the
oilseed is trading at about the same price as it was at the
beginning of the year. Wheat futures are down 15.8 percent.  Crop insurance for last year’s drought, which sent  corn
yields  to their lowest level since 1995, is buoying farmers.
Farm-related income, which includes government-backed crop
insurance, will total $36.9 billion, compared with $33.6 billion
last year and $36.4 billion estimated in February, the USDA
said.  Crop subsidies, excluding insurance assistance, may rise
4.7 percent this year to $11.1 billion, the USDA said. That
assumes that the benefits will continue beyond Sept. 30 when the
current farm bill expires. Both the U.S. Senate and House have
approved bills that would eliminate about $5 billion in annual
subsidies paid directly to farmers while boosting other support
programs by smaller amounts.  Today’s estimates will be revised in November, after the
harvest of major U.S. crops.  To contact the reporter on this story:
