FBN Holdings Plc (FBNH) , owner of First
Bank Nigeria, the West African nation’s third-largest lender by
market value, said first-half profit was little changed as costs
increased.  Net income in the six months through June rose to 46.1
billion naira ($284.9 million) from 45.3 billion naira a year
earlier, the Lagos-based lender said in a statement on the
website of the  Nigerian Stock Exchange  today. Gross earnings
increased 8 percent to 194.9 billion naira. Interest expenses
climbed 32 percent to 38 billion naira, while impairment charges
for loan losses rose 9 percent to 10 billion naira.  Profit growth was slowed by a “significant rise in
impairments that was up 371 percent quarter-on-quarter to 9.9
billion naira in first half versus 1.7 billion naira in first
quarter and 8.2 billion naira in the three months to June,”
Akinbamidele Akintola, a Lagos-based equity analyst with
 Renaissance Capital , said in e-mailed comments.  Lenders in  Africa ’s second-biggest economy are returning to
profitability after Central Bank of Nigeria Governor Lamido Sanusi bailed out banks with 620 billion naira as loans to
equity speculators and fuel importers in 2008 and 2009 pushed
the industry near collapse. The government then created the
Asset Management Corp. of Nigeria to buy lenders’ bad debts.  Amcon, which is partly funded by the nation’s banks,
increased the assets lenders are required to set aside for
failed loans to 0.5 percent this year from 0.3 percent. The
central bank also directed lenders to lower fees and commissions
starting April 1 to reduce conflict with clients.  First Bank’s shares declined 0.7 percent to 16.19 naira as
of 1:58 p.m. in Lagos, the commercial capital. The stock has
gained 3 percent this year, compared with the 17 percent rise of
the Bloomberg NSE Banking Index, which tracks  Nigeria ’s 10
biggest banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
