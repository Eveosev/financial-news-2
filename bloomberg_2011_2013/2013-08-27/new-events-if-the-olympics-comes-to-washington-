A group in Washington is  trying  to bring the Olympics to the capital in 2024. The city's journalists could barely hold in their excitement:  Karen Tumulty, Washington Post:  Annie Lowrey, New York Times: Dylan Byers, Politico: Ezra Klein, Washington Post and Bloomberg View:  Chris Moody, Yahoo News: Jackie Kucinich, In Play:  And then they embraced it, starting  #DCOlympicEvents  on Twitter. If Washington does indeed make the cut, here are six new events we'd like to see. Start training.  What are we missing? Leave your suggestions in the comments below.
