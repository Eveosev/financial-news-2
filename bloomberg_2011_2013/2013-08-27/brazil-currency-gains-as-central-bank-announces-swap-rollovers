Brazil ’s real gained after the
central bank announced plans to roll over all of its foreign-exchange swap contracts due Oct. 1 to stem the currency’s slide.  The real appreciated 0.4 percent to 2.3713 per dollar at
5:08 p.m. in Sao Paulo, erasing earlier declines. Swap rates due
in January fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
9.21 percent.  The central bank said in a statement that it will roll over
135,300 currency swaps at auctions Sept. 16-18. The bank has
said rollovers are in addition to the $60 billion intervention
program announced last week to support the currency.  To contact the reporters on this story:
