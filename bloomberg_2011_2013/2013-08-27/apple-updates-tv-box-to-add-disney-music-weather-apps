Apple Inc. (AAPL)  added programming from
Walt Disney Co., Weather Channel LLC and music-video service
Vevo LLC for Apple TV, stepping up the pace of bringing on new
video content to its $100 Internet-connected set-top box.  The material was added today with a software update, said
Christine Monaghan, a spokeswoman for Apple. Two applications
from Disney, Disney Channel and Disney XD, will have live and
on-demand content, and will be available to subscribers of pay-TV services that carry the channels. Vevo and the Weather
Channel will be available without a cable or satellite
subscription, she said.  Chief Executive Officer  Tim Cook  is adding more programming
to Apple TV after years of calling it a “hobby” product and
mainly keeping it as a tool to stream Internet video from iTunes
or  Netflix Inc. (NFLX)  on a television. In June, Apple made ESPN and
HBO programming available to customers who subscribe to those
channels through their pay TV service.  Apple is competing against Roku Inc. and Microsoft Corp. to
deliver Web video. Yet by adding applications from programmers
and restricting access for some material to pay-TV subscribers,
Apple is taking a different approach than  Intel Corp. (INTC)  and  Sony
Corp. (6758) , which are negotiating deals to build services that will
compete with existing cable and satellite plans.  In the latest update, Apple also added material from the
Smithsonian Channel, jointly owned by  CBS Corp. (CBS)  and Smithsonian
Institution.  To contact the reporter on this story:
