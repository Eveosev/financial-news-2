PZU SA, the Polish state-controlled
insurer that announced plans to pay an advanced dividend
yesterday, reported profit that topped analysts’ estimates.  Net income was 837.3 million zloty ($264 million) in the
second quarter, compared with 894.6 million zloty a year
earlier, the Warsaw-based company said in a regulatory statement
today. That exceeded the 794.6 million-zloty mean  estimate  of
seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  PZU, Poland’s biggest insurer, plans to pay out 1.73
billion zloty, or 20 zloty a share, in an advanced dividend from
2013 profit and 1.3 billion zloty in extraordinary dividends for
2014 and 2015, it said in a statement late yesterday. The
company, which is seeking to reduce its excess capital, plans to
finance the payouts from the sale of 3 billion zloty of bonds,
it said.  The company this year paid 2.56 billion zloty as a
dividend, or its entire 2012 unconsolidated profit, the maximum
amount allowed by the Polish financial market regulator.  The Polish government, which has a 35 percent stake in PZU
and seeks cash to plug a growing budget deficit, last week
increased its target for 2013 dividends from state-controlled
companies to about 6.5 billion zloty from 5 billion zloty.  The Treasury Ministry has gained 5.5 billion zloty in
dividends this year, it said in an e-mail to  Bloomberg News  on
Aug. 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
