(Corrects to say Awami works for oil ministry in 13th
paragraph.)  Eni SpA (ENI)  bought Russian Urals blend
at the lowest price in three months. BP Plc failed to buy  North
Sea  Forties crude at a lower price than the previous session.  Libyan oil production fell to one-eighth of its capacity as
protests over pay and allegations of corruption spread to fields
operated by Eni SpA and Repsol SA, executives at the state oil
company said.  North Sea  BP didn’t manage to buy Forties for Sept. 9 to Sept. 13
loading at 65 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent, a Bloomberg
survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts pricing
window showed. The grade was last offered at a premium of 80
cents on Aug. 23.  No bids or offers were made for Brent, Oseberg or Ekofisk
crudes. Reported crude trading typically occurs during the
Platts window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time.  Brent for October settlement traded at $114 a barrel on the
ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of the window, compared
with $110.78 in the previous session. The November contract was
at $112.65, a discount of $1.35 to October.  Futures surged as much as $3.62, or 3.3 percent, to $114.35
today on the ICE exchange on news of production cuts in Libya
and speculation fighting in  Syria  may escalate.  The share of Buzzard crude in the Forties stream was 58
percent in the week to Aug. 25, compared with 64 percent a week
earlier, BP said on its website.  Two Forties cargoes for loading in September will be
delayed by one to two days, said two people with knowledge of
the matter. Lot F0812 will be exported on Sept. 2 to Sept. 4
while F0813 will be shipped on Sept. 4 to Sept. 6, they said.  The Alvheim oil field restarted on schedule after
maintenance, according to operator Marathon Oil Corp.  Output is “a bit reduced the first 24 hours, but tomorrow
we will see the first regular production again,” said Ingvar
Solberg, a Stavanger, Norway-based spokesman for Marathon Oil,
in e-mailed response to questions.  Urals/Mediterranean  Eni bought 100,000 metric tons of Urals for Sept. 16 to
Sept. 20 loading from Glencore Xstrata Plc at 60 cents a barrel
less than Dated Brent on a delivered basis to Rotterdam, the
survey showed. This is the lowest trade since May 13.  There were no trades for the grade in the Mediterranean,
the survey showed. Urals in the region is priced near to parity
with Dated Brent, after trading at a premium since late June,
according to three of five traders surveyed by Bloomberg today.  Protesters in  Libya  yesterday stopped production at Repsol-operated Sharara and Eni-operated El Feel, or Elephant, fields
in western Libya, according to the Libyan oil ministry’s
Director of Measurement Ibrahim Al Awami. Output slumped to
about 200,000 barrels a day, compared with 640,000 in August and
its optimal capacity of 1.6 million, NOC Chairman Nuri Berruien
said today in an interview from Tripoli.  Russia will ship 4.49 million tons of Urals from the Baltic
port of Primorsk in September, or 1.1 million barrels a day, 25
percent more than planned in August, a final loading program
showed.  Ust-Luga, also in the  Baltic Sea , will load 2.297 million
tons of Urals next month, up 32% from 1.8 million tons this
month, according to the plan.  Novorossiysk port in the  Black Sea  will export 2.945
million tons of Urals in September, up 9.1 percent from a month
earlier. The port will also load 240,000 tons of Siberian Light
blend in September, unchanged from August.  Two 100,000-ton Urals cargoes at Ust-Luga and one 100,000-ton lot at Primorsk are unassigned, the plan showed.  PKN Orlen SA bought 100,000 tons of Urals for loading on
Sept. 12 to Sept.16 from Gunvor Group Ltd. at a discount of 55
to 65 cents a barrel to Dated Brent via a tender, said two
people with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be
identified as the information is confidential.  Poland’s largest oil company bought the same amount of
Urals on Aug. 23 for Sept. 8 to Sept. 12 from Royal Dutch Shell
Plc at a discount of 50 to 60 cents via a tender, said two
traders who participate in the market.  Algeria ’s Sonatrach increased its official selling price
for benchmark Saharan Blend crude for loading in September to
$1.05 a barrel more than Dated Brent from 60 cents for August,
according to an e-mailed price list.  West Africa  Nigeria will keep its Akpo crude exports for October
unchanged at five cargoes of 1 million barrels each and cut
Amenam loadings by one lot to two shipments of 950,000 barrels
each, according to a loading program obtained by  Bloomberg News .  Equatorial Guinea  will export two lots each of Ceiba and
Aseng grade in October, unchanged from September, a shipping
plan showed. Ceiba cargoes are of 1 million barrels each, and
Aseng of 650,000 barrels.  Republic of Congo will ship five 920,000-barrel
consignments of Djeno, unchanged from September, and increased
N’Kossa exports to two shipments of 950,000 barrels each, one
more than a month earlier, according to a loading schedule.  Ghana  will export three 950,000-barrel cargoes of Jubilee
crude in October, one more than September, a plan showed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
