The  Detroit Lions  cut Havard
Rugland, the Norwegian kicker whose four-minute trick-shot video
on YouTube drew the attention of National Football League teams.  Rugland, 28, made all three of his field-goal attempts
during the preseason, scoring from distances of 49, 50 and 33
yards. The Lions went instead with six-time Pro Bowl kicker
 David Akers  to replace Jason Hanson, who retired after last
season.  In the  video , titled “Kickalicious,” Rugland was shown
landing a kick in a moving rowboat, as well as making more
traditional kicks from as far as 60 yards. It had more than 3
million hits on the video-sharing website the past year.  “You just have to keep working hard and see what
happens,” Jill McBride Baxter, Rugland’s agent, said in a
telephone interview. “Veterans get hurt or someone isn’t
performing like expected and suddenly you are the guy. But based
on his performance, I would guess he’s on most teams’ lists.”  Akers, 38, who had two hernia operations this off-season,
regained his leg strength and converted seven of eight field-goal tries this preseason, plus a 63-yarder during practice this
month, according to the  Detroit Free Press .  Rugland had no American football experience and had worked
with former NFL kicker Michael Husted to improve his technique,
according to NFL.com.  Rugland was a social worker prior to coming to the U.S.,
Baxter said. He also played amateur soccer in  Norway .  To contact the reporter on this story:
