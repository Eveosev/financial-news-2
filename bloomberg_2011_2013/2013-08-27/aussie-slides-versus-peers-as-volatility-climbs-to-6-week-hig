The Australian dollar slid versus
all 16 major counterparts as volatility headed for the highest
close in six weeks, damping demand for the currency.  The Aussie weakened against its U.S. and Japanese peers as
investors continued to sell Asian emerging-market holdings and
before a report that may show  home-price  gains in the world’s
biggest economy remained near a seven-year high, boosting the
case for a reduction in Federal Reserve stimulus. New Zealand’s
currency fell, after yesterday advancing by the most in two
weeks, as a global decline in equities curbed appetite for
higher-yielding assets.  “Increased volatility historically has placed some
downward pressure on the Aussie,” said Peter Dragicevich, a
currency economist in Sydney at  Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) ,
the nation’s largest lender. “In terms of what’s contributed to
it, you’ve got concerns in the emerging-market space. And the
other factor is that historically, volatility does pick up in
and around large turning points in U.S. monetary policy, and we
are on the cusp of one at the moment.”  The Australian dollar lost 0.8 percent to 89.58 U.S. cents
as of 4:42 p.m. in Sydney. It fell 1.1 percent to 87.94 yen. New
Zealand’s currency slid 0.6 percent to 78.02 U.S. cents after
rising 0.6 percent yesterday, the biggest one-day gain since
Aug. 14. It declined 1 percent to 76.60 yen.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.4 percent yesterday.
The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of shares lost 0.7 percent today.  Volatility Climbs  One-month volatility for the Aussie jumped 68 basis points
this week to 13.03 percent today, set for the highest close
since July 16.  The Fed currently buys $85 billion of debt a month to
bolster growth. The U.S. central bank will reduce its purchases
at its next meeting on Sept. 17-18, according to 65 percent of
economists in an Aug. 9-13 Bloomberg survey.  Exchange data compiled by Bloomberg show overseas investors
have pulled $493.4 million from Indian stocks this month as of
Aug. 23, as the nation’s currency plunged to a record.  The Aussie has fallen 11 percent this year, the worst
performer among 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. Its New Zealand peer has
declined 1.7 percent.  The statistics bureau may say tomorrow  Australia ’s
 construction work  done in the three months through June climbed
1 percent from the previous period, when it fell 2 percent,
according to the median forecast of economists polled by
Bloomberg News. If confirmed, that would be the biggest advance
since the period ended September 2012.  ‘Growth Hole’  “Housing investment contribution of approx 0.2% GDP won’t
fill looming growth hole,” Robert Mead, the Sydney-based money
manager for Pacific Investment Management Co., which runs the
world’s biggest bond fund, wrote in a Twitter post.  Australia’s economy will probably expand 2.5 percent this
year after growing 3.6 percent in 2013, analysts in another
Bloomberg survey predicted.  Australia’s  10-year (GACGB10)  government bond yield dropped eight
basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 3.93 percent. The
rate on sovereign debt due in three years fell six basis points
to 2.72 percent. New Zealand’s  two-year swap rate , a fixed
payment made to receive floating rates, was little changed at
3.41 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
