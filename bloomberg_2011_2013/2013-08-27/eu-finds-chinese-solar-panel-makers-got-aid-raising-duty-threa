Chinese solar-panel makers received
subsidies, a European Union investigation showed, increasing the
likelihood of EU tariffs on imports of the renewable-energy
technology from China to counter trade-distorting  government
aid .  The European Commission has concluded in a probe opened
last November that Chinese manufacturers of crystalline silicon
photovoltaic modules or panels, and cells and wafers used in
them, benefited from preferential lending, tax programs and
other aid, an EU official said today in Brussels. The inquiry is
one of two that the commission is conducting into alleged unfair
Chinese trade in solar goods -- the biggest EU commercial fight
of its kind.  The commission, the 28-nation EUâ€™s regulatory arm, on Aug.
2 approved an agreement with China to curb Chinese shipments of
solar panels as part of a parallel probe into below-cost sales,
a practice known as dumping. The accord, which took effect Aug.
6, sets a minimum price and a volume limit on EU imports of
Chinese solar panels until the end of 2015. Chinese
manufacturers that take part are being spared provisional EU
anti-dumping duties as high as 67.9 percent.  The findings in the anti-subsidy case do not undermine the
amicable agreement with  China , said the official, who asked not
to be identified citing policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
