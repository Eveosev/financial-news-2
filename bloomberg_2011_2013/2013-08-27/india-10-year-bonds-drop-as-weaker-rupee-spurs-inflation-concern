India ’s 10-year government bonds
dropped for a third day as the rupee tumbled to a record low,
fueling concern inflation will accelerate.  The currency sank as much as 2.3 percent to an
unprecedented 65.82 per dollar, taking its loss this quarter to
more than 9 percent. A weaker currency stokes inflation as India
imports about 80 percent of its oil needs.  Wholesale prices  rose
5.79 percent in July from a year earlier, compared with 4.86
percent the previous month, official data show.  The yield on the 7.16 percent bonds due May 2023 jumped 12
basis points, or 0.12 percentage point, to 8.46 percent as of
12:03 p.m. in Mumbai, prices from the central bank’s trading
system show. The yield has climbed 101 basis points since the
end of June, touching a 12-year high of 9.48 percent on Aug. 20.  “There is continued pressure on the currency, which is
causing problems on the inflation front,” said Pradeep Madhav,
the Mumbai-based managing director of STCI Primary Dealer Ltd.
“The overall scenario looks pretty bleak.”  The rupee completed a second week of losses on Aug. 23
after a series of measures by policy makers since mid-July
failed to stem its slide. The  Reserve Bank  of India raised two
 interest rates  and tightened the supply of cash in the banking
system. A spike in yields after the cash squeeze prompted the
RBI to announce a plan to buy long-dated debt last week.  Strategy Shift  “While the RBI’s shift in strategy last week could have
marked a bottom for the  bond market , we don’t expect a sharp
rally from current levels and look for 10-year yields to be
range-bound in the near term,”  Rohit Arora , a Singapore-based
fixed-income strategist at Barclays Plc, wrote in a report
released yesterday.  India will sell 170 billion rupees ($2.6 billion) of bonds
maturing between 2019 and 2041 on Aug. 30. It will offer 10
billion rupees of inflation-indexed notes today, according to
RBI statements.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, advanced 10
basis points to 9.62 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
