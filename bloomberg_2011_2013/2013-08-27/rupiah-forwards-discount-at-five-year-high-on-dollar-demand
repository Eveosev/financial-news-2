Indonesia ’s rupiah forwards fell by
the most in two months, widening the discount to the spot rate
to the largest in nearly five years, on speculation dollar
demand from importers is exceeding supply.  The nation’s  trade shortfall  may expand to between $5
billion and $6 billion in 2013, compared with a deficit of $1.7
billion last year, Trade Minister  Gita Wirjawan  said this month.
 Bank Indonesia  will ease rules for exporters buying dollars when
they show documents proving they have sold the greenback before,
as part of measures meant to increase domestic foreign-currency
supply, Governor Agus Martowardojo said last week.  One-month non-deliverable forwards slid 2 percent to 11,632
per dollar as of 9:45 a.m. in Jakarta, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. It earlier fell 2.3 percent, the most since June
10. The contracts were 6.7 percent weaker than the spot rate,
which declined 0.2 percent to 10,865, according to prices from
local banks. That’s the biggest discount since November 2008.  “What’s happening to the forwards can drive expectations
for the spot rate,” said Nurul Eti Nurbaeti, Jakarta-based head
of treasury research at PT Bank Negara Indonesia. “Dollar
demand for imports still outstrips supply, while exporters are
preferring to hold on to their dollars.”  A  fixing  used to settle the forwards set by the Association
of Banks in  Singapore  was 11,052 yesterday. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of expected moves in the  exchange rate 
used to price options, rose 147 basis points, or 1.47 percentage
points, to 19.35 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The yield on  government bonds  due May 2023 climbed eight
basis points to 8.59 percent, the highest level since March
2011, prices from the Inter Dealer Market Association show. The
finance ministry plans to raise 8 trillion rupiah ($711 million)
from a sovereign debt auction today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
