(Corrects weight conversion in third paragraph of story
published Aug. 27.)  McDonald’s Corp. (MCD) ’s plan to start
selling bone-in chicken wings across the U.S. from September
through November likely will “shorten up” supply, said
 Sanderson Farms Inc. (SAFM)  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Joe F. Sanderson Jr.  “Anytime anybody features wings and sells wings, it’s
going to take some wings off the market,” Sanderson said in a
telephone interview today.  Wings in cold storage at the end of July almost doubled to
94.2 million pounds (42.7 million kilograms) from a year ago,
according to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture . The Georgia
Dock price of  wings , a benchmark for the commodity, has dropped
29 percent to $1.44 a pound from a January record, according to
the USDA.  It’s difficult to determine how McDonald’s entry into the
wings market will affect prices because it’s unclear how much
inventory the  Oak Brook , Illinois-based restaurant chain holds,
Sanderson said. Demand typically rises during the U.S. football
season that begins in September and peaks around the Super Bowl
championship game.  Sanderson is not a supplier of wings to McDonald’s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
