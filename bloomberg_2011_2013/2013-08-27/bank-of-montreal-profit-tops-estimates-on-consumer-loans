Bank of Montreal ,  Canada ’s fourth-largest lender by assets, said third-quarter profit topped
analysts’ estimates on record consumer lending and lower
provisions for bad loans.  Net income for the period ended July 31 climbed 17 percent
to C$1.14 billion ($1.08 billion), or C$1.68 a share, from C$970
million, or C$1.42, a year earlier, the Toronto-based company
said today in a statement. Revenue rose 4.4 percent to C$4.05
billion.  Bank of Montreal (BMO) , the first Canadian lender to report
quarterly results, posted growth across all its major
businesses, including record profit in Canadian banking and
wealth management. The bank also set aside less money for bad
loans.  “Canadian retail businesses were particularly strong in
the quarter with both personal and commercial banking Canada and
traditional wealth earnings reaching new highs,” Chief
Executive Officer William Downe, 61, said in the statement.  Adjusted earnings, which exclude some items, were C$1.68 a
share, beating the C$1.53 average  estimate  of 15 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  The bank set aside C$77 million for bad loans, compared
with C$237 million a year earlier.  Harris Bank  Canadian consumer-banking profit rose 8.3 percent to C$497
million on higher balances and fees, 10 percent loan growth and
lower provisions for credit losses, the company said. Profit
from its Chicago-based BMO Harris Bank rose 10 percent to C$153
million on lower provisions and cost-cutting.  Bank of Montreal has increased earnings from its U.S. unit
since doubling deposits and branches through the July 2011
takeover of Wisconsin-based lender Marshall & Ilsley. The C$4.1
billion acquisition was Bank of Montreal’s largest in its 195-year history.  Profit at the firm’s private-client group, which includes
insurance and mutual funds, doubled to C$218 million from a year
earlier on an increase in assets under management.  The BMO Capital Markets investment-banking unit profit rose
12 percent to C$280 million, with increases in trading and fees
from advising on stock sales.  The country’s six biggest banks are expected to post
average per-share profit growth of 3.3 percent excluding some
items, according to  Robert Sedran , an analyst with Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce.  Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) , the third-biggest bank, also reports today.  (Bank of Montreal will hold a conference call to discuss
quarterly results at 1:30 p.m. Toronto time at +1-888-789-0089
