Derek Jeter returned to the  New York 
Yankees’ lineup and went hitless in his sixth game of the
season.  Jeter, the Yankees’ 39-year-old shortstop and captain, went
0-for-3 with two groundouts, a strikeout and a walk in last
night’s 5-2 loss in Toronto. It was the Yankees’ second defeat
in 14 games against the Blue Jays this season.  Jeter missed the first 91 games of the Major League
Baseball season while recovering from a fractured left ankle. He
strained a thigh muscle while running the bases in his season
debut on July 11, forcing him to miss 12 more games, and
returned to the disabled list Aug. 5 with a strained calf
muscle.  “Everything looked fine,” Yankees manager Joe Girardi
told reporters last night. “I’m curious to see how he’ll feel
tomorrow, but he looked good.”  Jeter is hitting .182 with one home run and two runs batted
in this season.  “It’s good having him back,” Girardi said. “It gives us
more depth. He’s a guy who’s been very good at the top of the
lineup and at shortstop. It’s nice to write his name in.”  The Blue Jays snapped a 2-2 tie last night with three runs
in the fifth inning. Toronto scored the go-ahead run on an error
by Yankees right fielder Ichiro Suzuki and added two more runs
off starting pitcher Phil Hughes on a double by Adam Lind and a
sacrifice fly by Moises Sierra.  To contact the reporter on this story:
