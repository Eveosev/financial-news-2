U.K. billionaire Philip Green is set
to expand his fashion retail empire in the U.S. after extending
a partnership with department-store owner  Nordstrom Inc. (JWN)   Green’s Topshop will open sections in an additional 28
Nordstrom stores, taking the total to 42, the partners said
today in a statement. His Topman brand will start selling in
eight more outlets of the Seattle-based retailer, giving it a
presence in 18 stores.  Nordstrom first started selling Topshop and Topman clothes
in September last year. The department-store chain is the only
large U.S. retailer to sell a broad Topshop assortment.  “Through this collaboration, we hoped to attract new
customers to both our women’s and men’s apparel businesses and
to learn to create newness and excitement in our stores and
online,” Pete Nordstrom, president of merchandising at
Nordstrom, said in a statement. “We have been able to
measurably improve on these fronts.”  Nordstrom also plans a “completely refreshed design” for
all its new and existing Topshop and Topman departments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
