China ’s benchmark money-market rate
climbed by the most in almost a month after the central bank
rolled over some maturing three-year bills.  The People’s Bank of China re-issued 51.5 billion  yuan 
($8.4 billion) of three-year bills at 3.5 percent, according to
a statement posted on its website late yesterday. The monetary
authority issued 29 billion yuan of seven-day reverse repurchase
agreements at 3.9 percent today, and auctioned 50 billion yuan
of three-month deposits at commercial banks on behalf of the
Ministry of Finance at 4.75 percent, according to separate
statements.  “The central bank’s policy intention now looks pretty
clear, it wants to ensure short-term liquidity but lock up on
the long end,” said Cheng Qingsheng, an analyst at Evergrowing
Bank Co. in Shanghai. “The rates should be able to remain at
the current level until the month-end, and the real challenge
will be in late September.”  The  seven-day repurchase rate , a gauge of cash availability
in the banking system, climbed 39 basis points, or 0.39
percentage point, to 4.45 percent as of 10:07 a.m. in Shanghai,
according to a weighted average compiled by the National
Interbank Funding Center. That was the biggest increase since
July 29.  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repo rate, was unchanged at 4.08
percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The PBOC issued 36 billion yuan of reverse-repos at 3.9
percent a week ago,  injecting  a net 72 billion yuan into the
financial system, following an addition of 47.5 billion yuan a
week earlier. The rate on three-month treasury deposits at
today’s auction advanced from 4.69 percent in the previous sale
on Aug. 15.  The yield on the government’s 3.38 percent notes due May
2023 rose two basis points to 3.98 percent, according to the
Interbank Funding Center.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
