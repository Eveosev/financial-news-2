The shekel posted the steepest two-day loss in more than three months after U.S. Secretary of State
 John Kerry  said Syria will be held accountable for using
chemical weapons.  The shekel depreciated 1.2 percent to 3.6519 a dollar, at
5:45 p.m. in Tel Aviv, taking the two-day decline to 1.7
percent, the most since the two days ending May 14. The currency
is today the fifth-worst performer among an expanded list of 31
major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Israel ’s TA-25 benchmark
stock index slumped 2.4 percent to 1,156.19, the lowest level
since Sept. 23.  Global stocks fell as the Obama administration vowed to
hold Syria’s government responsible for using chemical weapons
and with its allies moves closer to a decision on retaliatory
military strikes. Hossein Sheikholeslam, the Iranian
parliament’s director-general for international affairs,
yesterday told the state-run Fars news agency that Israel risks
being the “victim” if any attempt is made to attack Syria.  “Foreign investors are shunning Israeli assets on concern
that a possible U.S. attack on Syria will include Israel in an
escalation,” said Moshe Nir, a trader at Mercantile Discount
Bank Ltd. in  Tel Aviv .  The shekel’s 14-day relative strength index climbed to
69.72, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The 70 threshold
suggests to some traders the shekel is oversold and a reversal
is imminent. The currency appreciated 2.3 percent this year, the
best performer among an expanded list of 31 major currencies
tracked by Bloomberg.  The yield on the benchmark 4.25 percent notes due March
2023 rose three basis points to 4 percent. Investors sought 5.1
times the 200 million shekels ($55 million) of the 2023 notes
sold at today’s  Finance Ministry ’s auction up from 3.7 times the
same amount offered on Aug. 19, ministry data on Bloomberg show.
The government sold a combined 900 million shekels in  government
bonds  at the last auction of the month. The  Bank of Israel 
yesterday left  interest rates  unchanged for a third month at
1.25 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
