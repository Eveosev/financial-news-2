Italy ’s government bonds fell for a
third day amid speculation a debate on former Prime Minister
 Silvio Berlusconi ’s political future will cause the governing
coalition to unravel.  The benchmark  10-year yield  climbed to the highest level in
four weeks as the nation sold 3.98 billion euros ($5.33 billion)
of zero-coupon notes and inflation-linked bonds today, the first
installment of 18.5 billion euros of supply scheduled for this
week. Italy’s upper house will start the impeachment process on
Berlusconi next month. German bunds rose as escalating tension
in  Syria  boosted demand for  Europe ’s safest fixed-income assets.  “There’s a bit of caution in the way the markets are
trading right now, with some anticipation of supply as well as
more political noise potentially out of Italy,” said  Orlando Green , a fixed-income strategist at Credit Agricole Corporate &
Investment Bank in  London . “The market wants reassurance that
it’s going to be the case that the coalition will remain in
place through the remainder of the year.”  Italy’s 10-year yield rose seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 4.45 percent at 4:30 p.m. in London time
after climbing to 4.46 percent, the highest since July 30. The
4.5 percent note due in May 2023 fell 0.545, or 5.45 euros per
1,000-euro face amount, to 100.75.  The  five-year yield  jumped nine basis points to 3.34
percent after climbing to 3.35 percent, the most since July 18.  Political Fate  Berlusconi instructed his political allies yesterday to
avoid public comments amid talks with Prime Minister Enrico Letta on changes to a controversial property tax. The fiscal
debate, on the agenda of a cabinet meeting tomorrow, is shaping
up as a prelude to a fight over Berlusconi’s political fate.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Italian 10-year
bonds instead of similar-maturity German bunds expanded 11 basis
points to 260 basis points after reaching 261 basis points, the
widest since Aug. 5.  Italian bonds also underperformed Spanish securities, with
the extra yield on Spanish 10-year debt over Italy’s shrinking
to as little as three basis points, the least since March 2012.  Italy sold 2.98 billion euros of zero-coupon notes maturing
in June 2015 at an average yield of 1.871 percent and 1 billion
euros of inflation-linked bonds due in 2018 and 2026.  The Rome-based Treasury will auction 8.5 billion euros of
bills tomorrow and 6 billion euros of bonds maturing in 2018 and
2024 on Aug. 29.  Inflation Outlook  Italy’s five-year  break-even rate , a gauge of inflation
expectations derived from the yield difference between
conventional and index-linked notes, fell one basis point to
0.96 percent after shrinking to 0.9, the least since July 26.  “There is little scope for break-evens to widen in the
near term,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a strategist at RIA Capital
Markets Ltd. in Edinburgh. “The main factor driving linkers
will be the general appetite for risk, which has clearly
deteriorated over the last few days.”  Germany’s benchmark 10-year bund yield fell five basis
points to 1.85 percent after climbing to 1.98 percent on Aug.
23, the highest level since March 2012.  U.S. President  Barack Obama ’s administration is vowing to
hold Syria’s government responsible for deadly chemical weapons
attacks on its people as the nation and its allies move closer
to a decision on retaliatory military strikes. Secretary of
State  John Kerry  yesterday denounced an attack last week on a
Damascus suburb as a “cowardly crime” requiring a response
against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime.  Spain  sold 4.2 billion euros of 84- and 259-day bills
today, while  Belgium  auctioned securities due in five, 10 and 20
years. Spain’s 10-year yield rose four basis points to 4.50
percent, while the rate on similar-maturity Belgian debt fell
three basis points to 2.75 percent.  Italian securities returned 3.7 percent this year through
yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Spain’s
earned 7.8 percent, while German bonds lost 2.4 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
