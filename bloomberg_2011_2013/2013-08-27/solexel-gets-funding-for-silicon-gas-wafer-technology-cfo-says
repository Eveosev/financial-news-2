Solexel Inc., a closely held U.S.
solar manufacturer backed by  SunPower Corp. (SPWR) , received about $5.5
million in equity in July and August from new and existing
investors.  The company has raised $56.8 million since last year, Mark
Kerstens, chief financial officer of the Milpitas, California-based company, said today in a phone interview. He declined to
name the new backers. SunPower invested in Solexel last year.  The company makes solar cells using silicon gas instead of
growing silicon ingots in furnaces and slicing them into wafers
like other companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
