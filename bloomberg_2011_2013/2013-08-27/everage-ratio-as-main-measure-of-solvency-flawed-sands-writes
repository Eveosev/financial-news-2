Standard Chartered Plc (STAN)  Chief
Executive Officer Peter Sands said using a leverage ratio as the
primary way of assessing banks’ solvency is flawed and will
create a financial system more vulnerable to crisis.  Because leverage ratios don’t differentiate between the
riskiest and safest assets, they create a “perverse” incentive
for banks to focus on the most hazardous assets with the highest
returns, Sands wrote in an op-ed in the Financial Times today.  He called for banks to address shortcomings in how they
apply risk-weightings to their assets to calculate their
financial health. The fact that different firms can give similar
assets different risk weightings is a “real problem,” Sands
wrote in the FT. Lenders should also update the models they use
in assigning risk-weightings, he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
