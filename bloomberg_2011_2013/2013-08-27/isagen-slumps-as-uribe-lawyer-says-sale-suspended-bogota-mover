Isagen SA (ISAGEN)  fell the most in five
years after a lawyer for former President  Alvaro Uribe  said he
won a court order temporarily suspending the government’s plans
to sell a majority stake in the hydropower producer.  Isagen dropped 3.3 percent to 2,960 pesos at 10:43 a.m. in
Bogota after earlier sinking 5.9 percent in the biggest intraday
decline since 2008. It was the worst performer after  Canacol
Energy Ltd. (CNE)  on the benchmark  Colcap index , which lost 0.2
percent.  “We demonstrated irreparable and immediacy of the harm if
Isagen is sold,”  Guillermo Rodriguez , a lawyer working on the
case led by Uribe, said in a post on his Twitter  account . A
tribunal in Cundinamarca province agreed to suspend the
government’s sale of its stake as a “cautionary measure,”
Rodriguez said.  Uribe says he opposes the sale because Isagen is “needed
to guarantee electric infrastructure” in the country, according
to a July 30 Twitter post.  Medellin-based Isagen is the operator of  Colombia ’s largest
hydropower plant, according to its  website . The company has six
plants with a generating capacity of 2,212 megawatts.  Isagen shares soared to a record 3,060 pesos yesterday.
Colombia sold a portion of its stake in an initial public
offering in 2007.  The government is seeking to sell its 57.66 percent Isagen
stake for a minimum of 2,850 a share, valuing the holding at 4.5
trillion pesos ($2.3 billion).  To contact the reporters on this story:
