A  Nebraska  policy barring gay and
lesbian couples and individuals from being foster parents was
challenged in an American Civil Liberties Union lawsuit.  The organization filed a complaint today at state court in
Lincoln, the capital, on behalf of three same-sex couples who
allege the prohibition violates their constitutional right to
equal protection of the law.  The state Department of Health and Human Services is barred
by a 1995 policy from placing foster children with people who
“identify themselves as homosexuals” as well as unmarried
adults living together, the ACLU said in a press statement.  The rule “cruelly takes stable, loving families away from
the vulnerable children who desperately need them,” Amy Miller
of the ACLU of Nebraska said in the statement. There are more
than 3,800 children in the state’s foster-care program, she
said.  The group asked for a court ruling that the policy is
unconstitutional and an order barring its enforcement.  Anita Scheuler, a spokeswoman for Nebraska Attorney General
Jon Bruning, said she could not immediately comment on the case.  The case is Stewart v. Heineman, D02CI130003157, District
Court of Nebraska, Lancaster County (Lincoln).  To contact the reporter on this story:
