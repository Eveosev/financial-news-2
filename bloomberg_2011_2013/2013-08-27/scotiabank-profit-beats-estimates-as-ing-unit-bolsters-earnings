Bank of Nova Scotia ,  Canada ’s third-biggest lender by assets, said adjusted quarterly profit rose as
its takeover of  ING Groep NV (INGA) ’s Canadian business added to
earnings. Scotiabank raised its dividend 3.3 percent to 62 cents
a share.  Scotiabank earned C$1.32 a share excluding some items for
the period ended July 31, the Toronto-based lender said today in
a statement, beating the C$1.31  average estimate  of 13 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Revenue was little changed at C$5.52
billion.  Record earnings from Canadian  consumer lending  was helped
by Scotiabank’s C$3.1 billion purchase of ING Direct Canada in
November, which bolstered loans and added about 1.8 million
customers. Wealth management also boosted results.  Profit for the period ended July 31 advanced to C$1.77
billion ($1.68 billion), or C$1.37 a share, from C$1.44 billion,
or C$1.69, a year earlier after excluding a $614 million gain
from the sale of its Scotia Plaza building in Toronto, according
to the statement.  (Scotiabank will hold a conference call at 2:30 p.m.
Toronto time to discuss results. To listen, dial +1-416-644-3414
