South Africa , the continent’s
largest producer of corn, may produce more of the yellow variety
than the white for the first time in 19 years as a lack of rain
in some areas curbs output of white.  The nation’s farmers will probably produce 5.93 million
metric tons of yellow corn in the year through April and 5.58
million tons of white, the Pretoria-based Crop Estimates
Committee said in a statement on its website yesterday. This
will be the first time since 1995 that South Africa produces
more of the yellow variety, according the committee’s data.  Some of the nation’s main growing regions, including the
Free State province, which produces 40 percent of the country’s
corn, haven’t received sufficient rain for crops to grow, which
will lead to lower-than-average yields. Output of yellow corn
will probably climb in all except one of South Arica’s nine
provinces, including a 23 percent increase in the Free State
from a year earlier and 27 percent gain in Mpumalanga, the
largest producers, the committee said.  Mpumalanga “had more rainfall than the white maize-producing areas of the North West province and the Free State,”
Andrew Fletcher, an independent trader in Kroonstad in the Free
State, said by phone yesterday.  White-corn output from the Free State, the biggest producer
of the variety, probably fell 14 percent from a year earlier.  “This year it is purely a reflection of rainfall
distribution, the yellow maize yields are higher than the white
maize yields,” Fletcher said.  Forecast Raised  South Africa raised its forecast for production of the
grain this season by 1 percent. Growers will probably reap 11.5
million metric tons of the grain in the year through April,
Marda Scheepers, a spokeswoman for the committee, said by phone
from  Pretoria  yesterday. This is bigger than the 11.4 million-ton prediction made by the committee last month and exceeds the
11.34 million-ton median estimate of seven analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  The nation produced 12.8 million tons in 2010, the biggest
crop since 1982. Meal made from white corn is one of the
country’s staple foods and the yellow variety is mainly used as
 animal feed .  White corn for delivery in December, the most active
contract, rose 0.5 percent to 2,401.20 rand ($230) a ton, while
the yellow variety for delivery in the same period gained 0.2
percent to 2,252 rand a ton.  Summer Grains  The committee decreased the sunflower-production forecast
by 1.7 percent to 566,600 tons, while the prediction for
soybeans was unchanged at 787,100 tons. The sorghum estimate was
cut by 5.8 percent to 154,494 tons and that for groundnut output
was left at 42,300 tons. Dry beans was unchanged at 60,200 tons.  Farmers in South Africa may produce 1.78 million tons of
wheat this season, 4.6 percent less than the 1.87 million tons
harvested last year. The median estimate by three analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg matched last season’s figure.  Wheat plantings may cover an area of 525,500 hectares (1.3
million acres) this season, the committee said. This compares
with the 515,900-hectare estimate of four traders in a Bloomberg
survey and is a 2 percent increase from last month’s forecast of
515,200 hectares. Last year, the nation planted 511,200 hectares
with the cereal, the smallest area since record-keeping started
in 1931.  Wheat for delivery in December rose 1.1 percent to 3,435
rand a ton.  The country’s growers may plant 75,165 hectares with canola
and reap 113,001 tons, 43 percent more than last season. The
area to be planted with malting barley may be 2.4 percent bigger
than the last forecast at 81,320 hectares, and farmers may
harvest 280,961 tons, 5.7 percent less than last season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
