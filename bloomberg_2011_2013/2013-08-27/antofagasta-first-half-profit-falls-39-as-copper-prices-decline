Antofagasta Plc (ANTO) , the copper producer
controlled by Chile’s Luksic family, said first-half profit fell
39 percent after metal prices declined and costs rose.  Net income slumped to $395 million from $646.1 million a
year earlier, the London-based mining company said today in a
statement. Sales dropped 12 percent to $2.78 billion.  Copper producers have seen profit eroded by weakening metal
prices and cost gains. Poland’s KGHM Polska Miedz SA this month
posted a 56 percent drop in quarterly profit, while  Australia ’s
 OZ Minerals Ltd. (OZL)  and  Kazakhmys Plc (KAZ)  reported first-half losses.  “With new copper supply coming online during the remainder
of this year and demand growth largely dependent on the
economies of  China  and the  United States , the pricing
environment for copper is expected to remain challenging,”
Antofagasta said in the statement.  The company sold its copper at $3.15 cents a pound, 16
percent lower than a year earlier, while cash costs climbed 15
cents a pound to $1.76. Earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization fell 31 percent to $1.28 billion,
missing the $1.34 billion average estimate of seven analysts
compiled by Bloomberg.  “As a single geography, single commodity stock,
Antofagasta does not usually throw up too many surprises and so
there will be some disappointment in the results today,”
Liberum Capital Ltd. said in a note to investors.  The company fell 3.3 percent to 884.5 pence by the close of
London trading, the steepest decline since Aug. 15.  Antofagasta, which produced 346,100 metric tons of copper
in the first half, reiterated its full-year output target of
700,000 tons. It increased the interim dividend by 4.7 percent
to 8.9 cents a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
