Mohamed El-Erian, chief executive
officer of Pacific Investment Management Co., said the Federal
Reserve’s policy of unprecedented asset purchases added 0.25 to
0.5 percentage point to gross domestic product.  “Most people agree that the impact on the real economy has
been disappointing,” El-Erian said today during an interview on
Bloomberg Television’s “In the Loop” with  Betty Liu . “But the
impact on financial assets has been quite considerable.”  The U.S. central bank has been buying $85 billion of
Treasuries and mortgage securities a month since January to keep
borrowing rates low and spur economic growth. The Fed’s first
step may be tapering monthly debt purchases in September by $10
billion, according to the median estimate of analysts in a
Bloomberg survey concluded this month.  Investors need to consider when the Fed will start to pare
asset purchases and how they will taper, as well as the global
implications, El-Erian said. The central bank will probably
reduce its Treasury purchases rather than mortgage bonds, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
