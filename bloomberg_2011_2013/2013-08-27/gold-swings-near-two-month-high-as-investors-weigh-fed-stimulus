Gold climbed to the highest since
May as political tension over Syria increased demand for the
precious metal as a store of value.  U.S. Secretary of State  John Kerry  said Syria will be held
accountable for using chemical weapons. Gold has rebounded 20
percent from a 34-month low of $1,179.40 an ounce in June as
lower prices boosted demand for jewelry, coins and bars.  “Syria is the new bullish barometer for gold,”  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior market strategist at Archer Financial
Services Inc. in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “We
are seeing renewed interest in gold.”  Gold futures for December delivery climbed 1.9 percent to
settle at $1,420.20 an ounce at 1:44 p.m. on the Comex in New
York, the biggest jump since Aug. 15. Earlier, prices reached
$1,424, the highest for a most-active contract since May 15.  “The fact that investment demand has picked up again
somewhat of late, coupled with the escalating Syrian conflict,
could see the upswing continue,” analysts at Commerzbank AG
wrote today in a report.  Russia and Kazakhstan expanded their  gold reserves  for a
10th straight month in July, data on the International Monetary
Fund’s website show.  Gold has slid 15 percent this year as some investors lost
faith in the metal as a store of value and on speculation that
the  Federal Reserve  will reduce stimulus that helped prices gain
for a 12th year in 2012.  Silver futures for December delivery gained 2.7 percent to
$24.70 an ounce on the Comex, after reaching $24.75, the highest
since April 26.  Platinum futures for October delivery fell 0.8 percent to
$1,532.10 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , after
touching $1,558, the highest since April 9. Palladium futures
for September delivery rose 0.4 percent to $749.15 an ounce on
the Nymex, the first rise in three sessions.  To contact the reporters on this story:
