Plains All American Pipeline LP (PAA) , the
oil transporter that has grown 45 percent in the last year,
offered to buy the shares of  PAA Natural Gas Storage LP (PNG)  it
doesn’t already own in a deal that values the company at $1.97
billion.  Owners of PAA Natural Gas’s outstanding partnership units
would receive .435 units of Plains All American, worth $22.74,
the Houston-based companies said today in joint statements.
Plains All American is the general partner of PAA Natural Gas
and  owns  46 percent of its limited-partner units.  The price is a 7.9 percent premium to Plains Natural Gas’s
closing price today.  PAA Natural Gas has been in a “defensive posture” as it
has seen shrinking profit margins from seasonal differences in
gas prices, President Dean Liollio said on the company’s second-quarter earnings call Aug. 6.  “It is clear that the next several years will be
challenging for PNG on a stand-alone basis,” Plains All
American Chief Executive Officer Greg Armstrong said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
