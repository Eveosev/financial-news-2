The franc rose against most major
currencies, as assets considered safe by investors got a lift
after U.S. Secretary of State  John Kerry  said  Syria  will be held
liable for using chemical weapons.  The Swiss currency advanced against 15 of its 16 major
peers, only declining against the yen. Against the euro, the
franc hit its strongest level in a week.  “The prevailing emerging-market jitters are exacerbated by
talk of possible U.S. strikes on Syria,” Alvin Tan, a director
of foreign-exchange strategies at Societe Generale SA in  London ,
wrote in a note to clients. “The yen and the franc have gained,
as per the typical playbook.”  The franc was up 0.3 percent against the euro at 1.2303 at
11:25 a.m. in Zurich. Against the dollar it appreciated 0.1
percent to 92.24 centimes. It also climbed against the Canadian
dollar, the British pound and the Australian dollar. It fell 0.6
percent against the yen.  Investors generally buy the franc at times of heightened
uncertainty. In September 2011, investor anxiety about the euro
area’s debts led the  Swiss National Bank  to set a cap of 1.20
per euro on the franc to shield the country from deflation and a
recession. The franc had nearly touched parity with the common
currency a month before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
