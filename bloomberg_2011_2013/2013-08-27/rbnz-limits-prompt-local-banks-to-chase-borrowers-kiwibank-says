New Zealand  banks will become more
aggressive in their pursuit of new mortgage lending in response
to central bank restrictions, Kiwibank Ltd. Chief Executive
Officer Paul Brock said.  Banks will offer cheaper home loans to people with high
deposits in an attempt to expand their overall lending, giving
them greater scope to lend to those with smaller downpayments,
who are typically first-home buyers, Brock said on a conference
call today.  The  Reserve Bank  of New Zealand announced last week that
loans for more than 80 percent of a property’s value must
account for no more than 10 percent of a bank’s new lending from
Oct. 1.  “If we grow the total pie, we can do more lending at
greater than 80 percent and support those first-home buyers,”
Brock said. “How fast you grow sub-80 helps you grow above
that. You will see more activity in that part of the market.”  More lending may undermine the central bank’s plan to curb
the excesses of the  property market . It is introducing the
lending limits because it’s concerned that the banking system is
getting over-exposed to any sudden collapse in  house prices .
Governor Graeme Wheeler has been reluctant to raise  interest
rates  because that may stoke demand for the  New Zealand dollar ,
hurt exports and hinder an economic recovery.  Banks will target borrowers who have high deposits by
offering lower rates or other incentives, Brock predicted. He
declined to talk about Kiwibank’s specific plans.  ASB Bank Ltd. on Aug. 23 began offering a home-loan fixed
for six months at 4.75 percent to borrowers who have a 20
percent deposit and become customers for their other banking.
Kiwibank’s six-month rate is 5.25 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
