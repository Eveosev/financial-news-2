Carnegie Wave Energy Ltd. (CWE) , an
Australian marine technology developer, said it signed a support
agreement with Water Corp. of Western Australia to help build
the world’s first wave-powered desalination plant.  “Water Corp. are innovators in the field of seawater
desalination and Carnegie’s wave-powered desalination pilot will
be a world first,” Michael Ottaviano, chief executive officer
of Perth-based Carnegie, said today in a statement.  Water Corp., which built the first large-scale mainland
seawater desalination plant in Australia in 2006, said
Carnegie’s wave-powered pilot plant offered a “promising
approach” to achieving desalinated water without producing
greenhouse gas emissions, the company said in the statement.  The pilot plant will be located on Garden Island, a naval
base in  Western Australia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
