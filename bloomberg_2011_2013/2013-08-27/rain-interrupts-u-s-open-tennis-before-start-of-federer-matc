Play has been suspended for the
night at the U.S. Open tennis tournament, pushing  Roger Federer â€™s first-round match to tomorrow.  Rain halted play before the start of the Federer match, and
showers and possible thunderstorms are forecast for at least the
next three hours.  Federer, a five-time winner at the last Grand Slam
tournament of the season, is to play Grega Zemlja of Slovenia in
the first round. Their match was the last one scheduled on Day 1
at the National Tennis Center in New York.  Light rain began to fall right after  Serena Williams 
wrapped up a victory at Arthur Ashe Stadium, where the Federer-Zemlja match was scheduled to follow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
