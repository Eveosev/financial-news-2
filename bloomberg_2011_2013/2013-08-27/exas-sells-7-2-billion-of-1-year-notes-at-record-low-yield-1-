Texas sold $7.2 billion in notes,
its smallest offering since 2009, at a record-low yield to help
manage  cash flow  in the fiscal year beginning Sept. 1.  The debt was priced to yield 0.201 percent, Comptroller
Susan Combs said in a statement. That compares with an  interest
rate  on benchmark one-year notes of  0.35 percent , data compiled
by Bloomberg show. The state offered similar debt a year ago at
what was then a historically low yield of 0.23 percent.  Sales-tax collections rose 7.8 percent for the 11 months
through July 31 compared with a year earlier, reducing the need
for borrowing after Texas  issued  about $10 billion in each of
the past two years, said R.J. DeSilva, a spokesman for Combs.  The notes mature in August 2014 and are rated SP-1+ by
 Standard & Poor’s , its highest short-term grade. The notes
amount to about 8.8 percent of projected general revenue for
fiscal 2014, “significantly smaller” than in the past three
years, according to S&P.  “The best ratings from Wall Street ratings firms and
strong demand for Texas notes helped drive down the borrowing
cost,” Combs said. “The competitive bids for today’s sale show
that investors are very confident in the Texas economy and the
direction it’s heading.”  Following California  California, the most populous state, this month sold $5.5
billion of revenue-anticipation notes maturing in June with a
yield as high as 0.23 percent, according to Treasurer Bill Lockyer. It was the lowest yields the state has paid since 1971,
the earliest year for which data was available, said  Tom
Dresslar , a spokesman for Lockyer.  The Texas Legislature in May approved a $102 billion
general revenue budget for 2014 and 2015, a 10.2 percent
increase from the previous two years.  The state has sold short-term notes annually since fiscal
1987 to provide aid to school districts when its financial year
begins. The state then reserves  tax revenue  to repay the debt
within 12 months.  Seven banks bought the debt, including JPMorgan Chase &
Co.,  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  and Morgan Stanley, Bloomberg data show.
Buyers submitted bids totalling $16.7 billion, Combs said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
