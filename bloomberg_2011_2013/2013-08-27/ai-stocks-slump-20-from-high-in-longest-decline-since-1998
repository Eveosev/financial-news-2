Thai stocks  retreated for a ninth
day, sending the benchmark index down more than 20 percent from
this year’s high, amid concern foreign outflows will accelerate
as the economy weakens. The baht and government bonds dropped.  The benchmark SET Index lost 2.7 percent to close at
1,293.97 in Bangkok, its longest losing streak since 1998.  Siam
Cement Pcl (SCC)  and  Total Access Communication Pcl (DTAC)  dropped more than
3.6 percent and were among the biggest drags on the index. The
baht weakened 0.8 percent to 32.18 per dollar, while the yield
on 10-year government debt rose 14 basis points to 4.29 percent,
the highest level since December 2009.  Thailand entered a recession in the second quarter,
according to figures released this month, while data yesterday
showed exports unexpectedly fell last month. Southeast Asia’s
second-biggest economy will probably post a current-account
deficit of $550 million in July, according to a Bloomberg survey
of economists.  “Companies with revenue from domestic markets should be
affected by weak economic growth,” Jintana Mekintharanggur,
director of equity investment at Manulife Asset Management Co.
in Bangkok, which has about $200 million of assets, said by
phone. “Overseas investors are unlikely to bring money back
into equity markets in  Thailand  and the region until there are
signs of strong economic growth.”  Fund Outflows  Overseas investors  sold  about $1.1 billion of Thai stocks
and $1.2 billion of  local bonds  this month amid speculation that
the U.S. Federal Reserve will reduce monetary stimulus this
year. Outflows from Indonesian shares totaled $442 million,
while investors withdrew $163 million from Philippine equities.  The three Southeast Asian markets led a four-year rally in
global shares through May as growing local economies sent
corporate profits to record highs and Fed stimulus spurred
international investors to seek riskier assets. The SET index
has dropped 21 percent from its May 21 closing high.  Thailand’s gross domestic product unexpectedly shrank 0.3
percent in the three months through June from the previous
quarter, when it contracted a revised 1.7 percent, the National
Economic & Social Development Board said on Aug. 19. The state
agency cut its full-year expansion forecast to as little as 3.8
percent from a previous estimate of 4.2 percent. It lowered its
export growth target to 5 percent from 7.6 percent.  Lower Valuations  Overseas shipments  in July dropped 1.5 percent from a year
earlier to $19.06 billion, the commerce ministry said yesterday.
Economists had expected a 0.8 percent increase, according to a
Bloomberg survey. The country posted a trade deficit of $2.28
billion last month, compared with an estimate of $2.03 billion.  “Global investors are worried about slowing growth in the
region,” Kasamapon Hamnilrat, head of research at Krungsri
Securities Co. in Bangkok, said by phone. “Weak export data may
prompt more downward revisions in Thai GDP growth.”  Siam Cement, the nation’s biggest cement producer, dropped
3.7 percent to its lowest close since Nov. 30. Total Access slid
6.4 percent, the lowest level since April 12.  CP All Pcl (CPALL) , the
nation’s largest convenience store operator, lost 2.9 percent.  The SET Index is valued at 11.4 times estimated profit for
the next 12 months, the lowest level since July 2012, according
to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with a multiple of
9.8 for the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
