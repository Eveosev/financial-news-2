The Obama administration will
require U.S. government contractors to set targets for hiring
veterans and people with disabilities.  The Labor Departmentâ€™s rules, announced today, are aimed at
curbing unemployment in both groups. Dozens of companies have
protested the proposals, saying they would increase costs.  The regulations would mandate that vendors set unspecified
employment benchmarks for veterans, according to a document
posted on an agency website. Contractors would be required to
set a goal of having 7 percent of their employees -- in each job
category -- be people with disabilities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
