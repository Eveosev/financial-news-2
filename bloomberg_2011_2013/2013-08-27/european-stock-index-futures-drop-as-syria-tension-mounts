the Syrian conflict and negative spillover effects to the whole
region, shaking investor sentiment,” Witold Bahrke, who helps

Copenhagen, wrote in an e-mail. “Policy risks are the
dominating issue and we are heading into a true minefield of
risk events over the coming weeks.”  The Stoxx 600 fell yesterday after Silvio Berlusconi’s

Damascus last week, saying it required a response against Syrian

is a moral obscenity,” Kerry told reporters in  Washington  after
the close of European markets yesterday.  The volume of shares changing hands in companies listed on
