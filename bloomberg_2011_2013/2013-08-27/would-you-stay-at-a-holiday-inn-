After years of success, the legacy brand Holiday Inn has lost market share to upstarts—including its sister brand that has won new business with its consistently funny ads punctuated with the punch line "but I did stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night." So the iconic brand, owned by InterContinental Hotels, will launch a new marketing effort to win back consumers that have decided that, on some trips,  limited-service hotels are a fine alternative to full-service properties . The launch comes with a new TV spot, which touts Holiday Inn's new focus, including a number of contemporary hotel touches like fitness centers, communal workspaces, and dining options designed for both solo travelers and groups. Laptops and cell phones, those twin tools of the always-connected traveler, are featured prominently, a nod to free wi-fi at any InterContinental hotel for members of its free loyalty program. But properties that have added these new and appealing amenities in recent years  still haven't caught on among travelers ,  USA Today  reports. Part of the reason is that limited-service hotels, with their  comfortable beds, free wi-fi, and other great amenities at an all-included rate  remain a popular alternative, particularly in smaller markets without big-name competition. In fact, Holiday Inn's ad for the new campaign was filmed on location in  Clark, New Jersey , just the sort of place where the brand is trying to make inroads.
