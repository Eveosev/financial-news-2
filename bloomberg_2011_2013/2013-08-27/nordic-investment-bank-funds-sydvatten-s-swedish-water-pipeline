Nordic Investment Bank agreed to
lend 67 million kronor ($11 million) to Sydvatten AB to build a
water pipeline in southern  Sweden .  The 20-kilometer (12-mile) pipeline will link the Angelholm
and Bastad municipalities to Sydvatten’s drinking-water supply,
the bank said today in a  statement  on its website. Resources in
the municipalities, with a population of 50,000, won’t be
sufficient to meet the expected increase in demand for drinking
water in coming decades, according to the statement.  Sydvatten is owned by 16 municipalities in southern Sweden
and produces drinking water for about 900,000 people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
