Question: Answer: That's a very hard question for me to answer, Matthew. On the one hand, the penthouse suites are lovely—they're more stylish than what you normally find on cruise ships—and an added bonus is that you'll get priority treatment when it comes to dinner reservations (meaning, you can get into  the first-rate specialty restaurants  more often and dine at the time you want). On the other hand, the difference between the penthouse suites and standard cabins onboard  Marina  is not nearly as dramatic as the difference is on larger ships. When  I sailed on the  Marina  last May , the passengers in standard cabins seemed very happy with their rooms and the service they were getting; they did not feel they were missing out by not having a suite on a higher deck. I was in a concierge-level cabin (on deck 9)—meaning, I was in a room that's somewhere in between a standard cabin and a suite—and I did not think that having a club lounge with a dedicated VIP concierge significantly enhanced my experience of the cruise. I barely used that club lounge. They had snacks in it, but you can order room service for free, so the food was not a draw. As for the concierge, I got better service when I made requests at the front desk. Matthew, since I'm naturally a bit biased against splurging on a suite in general—I'm simply the sort of person who would rather spend my money on as many trips as possible, staying in basic accommodations, than on one once-in-a-lifetime trip with fabulous accommodations—I figured I ought to get you a second opinion, so I went to one of my favorite travel agents who specializes in cruises,  Tom Baker of CruiseCenter . Tom has also sailed on  Marina  and has a somewhat different take than I do on the merits of upgrading: Since it's your first cruise, Matthew, I recommend strongly that you book it through a savvy travel agent like Baker who specializes in cruises. As for the intermittent-internet problem, I should add that the best spot on the ship for both a fast Internet connection and an ocean view simultaneously is the small sitting area between Barista's coffee bar and the computer center—plus there are free hors d'oeuvres at the library entrance right around the corner. ( I spent a lot of time blogging from that spot! ) Bon voyage! More From  Condé Nast Traveler :
