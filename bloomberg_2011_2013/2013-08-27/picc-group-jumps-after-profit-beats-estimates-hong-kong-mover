People’s Insurance Company (Group)
of China Ltd. (1339) , parent of the nation’s biggest non-life insurer,
rose to the highest in 11 weeks in Hong Kong trading after
reporting a better-than-expected 53 percent jump in profit.  The  stock  rose as much as 3.5 percent to HK$3.87, the
highest since June 3, and traded 2.1 percent higher at HK$3.82
as of 10:24 a.m. local time. First-half  net income  jumped to
7.54 billion yuan ($1.23 billion) as investment and premiums
income expanded, Beijing-based PICC Group, as the insurer is
known, said in a filing yesterday.  Chairman Wu Yan boosted premiums income in the first half
amid the nation’s economic slowdown after raising HK$24 billion
($3.1 billion) in an initial public offering in Hong Kong in
November to fund its business expansion. Net income at  PICC
Property & Casualty Co. (2328) , the main revenue contributor, climbed
17 percent to 7.63 billion  yuan  as underwriting profit grew and
investment income increased, the non-life unit said in a
separate statement.  PICC Group’s numbers were “stronger than expected due to
strong P&C result,” Credit Suisse Group AG analysts led by
Arjan van Veen wrote in a report dated yesterday. “This result
represents a ‘coming of age’ for PICC P&C, where it has caught
up with peers on claims management and its scale advantage is
finally shining through.”  ‘Much Better’  PICC P&C’s combined ratio, used to gauge claims and
expenses as a percentage of premiums earned, rose 1.2 percentage
points from the record-low 92.4 percent in the first half of
last year to 93.6 percent, according to the statement. Lower
combined ratio means higher profitability.  The combined ratio was “much better than expectation” and
compares with 97.7 percent at  China Pacific Insurance (Group)
Co. (2601) , the nation’s third-largest non-life insurer, the Credit
Suisse analysts wrote. They raised PICC Group’s target price to
HK$4.25 from HK$4.10. PICC P&C’s loss ratio, which gauges claims
as a percentage of premiums, was 61.5 percent, lower than
Pacific Insurance’s 62.2 percent, they wrote.  Gross premiums at PICC P&C jumped 14 percent, while revenue
at the group’s life insurance unit dropped 12 percent as higher-return wealth management products offered by banks dwarfed the
appeal of insurance products, according to data from the China
Insurance Regulatory Commission.  Investment income surged 50 percent to 15.34 billion yuan,
PICC Group said. Net investment income, mainly comprised of
interest and dividends, gained 21 percent to 12.61 billion yuan.
The company reported 3.7 billion yuan in realized gains from
investments, reversing 88 million yuan in realized losses a year
earlier.  PICC P&C jumped as much as 6 percent to HK$10.38, the most
since Jan. 2, in  Hong Kong .  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
