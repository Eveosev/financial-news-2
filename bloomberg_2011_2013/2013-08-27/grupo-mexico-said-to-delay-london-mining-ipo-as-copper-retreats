Grupo Mexico SAB (GMEXICOB) , billionaire German
Larrea’s holding company, is delaying a planned initial public
offering in  London  of its mining unit, according to three people
with direct knowledge of the decision.  Grupo  Mexico  tabled the offering of the unit, Americas
Mining, after the price of copper and emerging-market  stocks 
fell, said the people, who asked not to be named because they
weren’t authorized to comment publicly. An IPO is unlikely until
at least next year, according to the people.  Chief Financial Officer Daniel Muniz had said March 21 that
the company may sell as much as 25 percent of Americas Mining in
a share sale in London. The share sale would be a first step in
listing the individual parts of the conglomerate, which has a
market value of 310.5 billion pesos ($23.5 billion). Grupo
Mexico encompasses the country’s biggest mining company along
with railroads, highway construction, oil-rig leasing and a
stake in an airport operator.  Muniz didn’t return an e-mail and call requesting comment.  Copper futures have fallen 9 percent this year to $3.3225 a
pound on the Comex in New York, while the MSCI  Emerging Markets 
Index has dropped 13 percent this year.  Muniz had said in March that by listing each of its
divisions the company would “create shareholder value.” He
said the company was “practically ready” to move ahead with
the strategy, with sales possible as soon as this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
