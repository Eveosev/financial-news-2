Finland’s  manufacturing confidence 
fell to its lowest since January as weak demand led to thin
order books, low capacity utilization and increasing stockpiles.  Business confidence fell to minus 12 this month from a
revised minus 8 in July, the Confederation of Finnish Industries
said today in a statement on its website, citing a survey. The
figure was minus 7 a year ago and its long-term average is 2.  “Order books are well below normal and no production
growth is forecast,” Penna Urrila, chief economist at the
Helsinki-based organization, said in the statement.
“Expectations are weak.”  A slump in demand for Finnish exports is curtailing
production and boosting stockpiles of goods at warehouses.
Industrial orders declined an annual 6.3 percent in the first
half, according to data by the statistics office. Industrial
output fell an annual 6.7 percent on average in the second
quarter.  Finnish  consumer confidence  was unchanged at 5 in August,
also below its long-term average of 12.3, Statistics Finland
said, citing a separate survey. Those polled expect unemployment
to increase and Finland’s economic prospects to weaken,
according to the statement.  The Nordic nation’s trade unions and employer organizations
are gearing up to discuss wages as collective agreements expire
in October. Prime Minister  Jyrki Katainen  has called for
moderation in salary increases to regain competitiveness against
peers including Sweden and  Germany .  To contact the reporter on this story:
