The zloty depreciated to the weakest
level since the beginning of the month as concern that  Syria ’s
crisis will escalate overshadowed improved business confidence
in Poland’s biggest trading partner.  The currency declined 0.4 percent to 4.2494 against the
euro as of 4:19 p.m. in Warsaw, the weakest since Aug. 1. The
yield on Poland’s benchmark 10-year zloty bond was unchanged at
4.42 percent, while the rate on the country’s dollar note due in
March 2023 declined three basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, to a one-week low of 4.48 percent.  U.S. Secretary of State  John Kerry  said yesterday Syria
will be held accountable for using chemical weapons. Worry that
conflict in the  Middle East  will intensify “outweighs” an Ifo
institute report today showing German business confidence rose
to a 16-month high in August,  Rafal Benecki , chief economist at
ING Bank Slaski SA in Warsaw, wrote in an e-mailed note.  The government “is happy with the stable zloty exchange
rate compared with other emerging-market currencies,” Deputy
Finance Minister Wojciech Kowalczyk told reporters in Warsaw
today, adding it  highlights “strong Polish fundamentals and
investor belief in economic recovery.”  Polish  retail sales  rose 4.3 percent year on year in July,
the fastest growth in 12 months, the  Central Statistical Office 
said yesterday. The office will give full second-quarter gross-domestic product data on Aug. 30. A preliminary estimate
published on Aug. 14 showed the economy grew 0.8 percent,
compared with 0.5 percent in the previous quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
