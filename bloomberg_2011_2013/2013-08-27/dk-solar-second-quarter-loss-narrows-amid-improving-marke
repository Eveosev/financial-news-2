  LDK Solar Co. (LDK) , the second-biggest
maker of solar wafers, said its second-quarter loss narrowed and
forecast increased revenue as the market improves. Cash dropped
to the lowest in 15 quarters.  LDK had a quarterly deficit of $165.3 million, the ninth in
a row, compared with a $187.1 million loss in the first three
months of the year and a $254.3 million loss in the same period
a year earlier, it said in a statement today. The company ended
the second quarter with $85.1 million in cash, the least since
2009.  Solar-component prices, which had been eroded by oversupply
and weak demand, have begun to recover, with wafers gaining 7
percent this year and panels up 7.7 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Chief Executive Officer Sam Tong said
this month LDK may return to profit in 2013 on domestic demand
and after the European Union and  China  reached a tariff deal.  “We are starting to see early signs of improvement within
the photovoltaic market” as prices stabilize, Tong said in the
statement today. “We are also encouraged by recent updates on
solar policies from China and the EU.”  LDK forecasts revenue of as much as $180 million in the
third quarter from $114.7 million in the three months ended
June. The company also expects third-quarter shipments of wafers
of 350 megawatts to 450 megawatts and as much as 80 megawatts of
cells and modules.  LDK shares have risen 24 percent in the last year.  GCL-Poly Energy Holdings Ltd. (3800)  is the biggest solar-wafer
maker by production capacity.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
