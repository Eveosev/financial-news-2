New York  Harbor gasoline fell from
the strongest level in six months as a refinery in the U.S.
Northeast restarted a unit following a shutdown.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline weakened 1 cent to a
discount of 0.25 cent a gallon below futures on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  at 9:17 a.m., the lowest level in a week.
The spread rallied to a premium of 0.75 cent a gallon on Aug. 23
after  Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL) ’s Trainer plant reported the shutdown
of a fluid catalytic cracker.  The 185,000-barrel-a-day Pennsylvania refinery operated by
Delta subsidiary Monroe Energy LLC began restarting the unit
yesterday at about 6:51 a.m. local time, according to a report
by Genscape Inc. The company said Aug. 23 that the 52,000-barrel-a-day catalytic cracker was shut and was expected to be
back in operation within 48 hours.  Irving Oil Corp.’s Saint John,  New Brunswick , refinery
reported the shutdown of a 70,000-barrel-a-day catalytic cracker
last week. Over half of the refinery’s finished products,
including gasoline and diesel, are exported to the U.S.
Northeast.  Return of units at the two refineries may add to  stockpiles 
on the U.S. East Coast, which according to government data fell
by 2.74 million barrels to 58.5 million in the week ended Aug.
16, the lowest level since March 29.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  in New York Harbor gained 0.12 cent
to a discount of 0.13 cent below ULSD futures on the Nymex. The
3-2-1 regional crack spread, a rough measure of refining margins
for gasoline and diesel based on Brent oil in  Europe , slid $1.23
to $13.47 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
