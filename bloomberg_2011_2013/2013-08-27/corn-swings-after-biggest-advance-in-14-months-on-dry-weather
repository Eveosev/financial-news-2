Corn swung between gains and losses
after climbing the most in more than a year as investors weighed
the outlook for hot, dry weather in the Midwest against
prospects of a record U.S. crop. Soybeans fluctuated.  The grain for December delivery gained as much as 0.8
percent to $5.0425 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and
traded 0.2 percent lower at $4.995 by 10:49 a.m. in  Singapore .
Prices touched $5.0825 yesterday, the highest since July 17,
before ending 6.5 percent higher, the most since June 2012.  While corn slumped 28 percent this year on expectations U.S.
output will recover from last year’s drought-affected harvest,
rising temperatures in the biggest growing region have raised
concern that crop yields will suffer. Dry and warm conditions
will continue across the central and western Midwest in the next
six to 10 days, stressing corn and soybean crops, MDA
Information Systems LLC said yesterday.  “With the amount of corn that’s been planted this year,
even if we do have a little bit of a hiccup in terms of
production, we should still have a pretty good carryout,” said
Graydon Chong, a grains and oilseed analyst at Rabobank
International in Sydney. “We may well see some traders take
profit here and reassess, as is normal when you have big market
movements.”  The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  has cut its corn-crop
forecast three times in as many months, predicting production of
13.763 billion bushels. While that would be a record, it is down
from 14.14 billion expected in May. The country produced 10.78
billion bushels last year.  About 59 percent of the crop was in good or excellent
 condition  as of Aug. 25 from 61 percent a week earlier, the USDA
said yesterday.  Soybeans for November delivery fell 0.2 percent to $13.8625
a bushel after gaining 0.4 percent. Prices jumped 4.6 percent to
settle at $13.895 yesterday. That was the biggest advance since
Oct. 11, 2011 and the highest level at close since June 6. Wheat
for delivery in December lost 0.2 percent to $6.6525 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
