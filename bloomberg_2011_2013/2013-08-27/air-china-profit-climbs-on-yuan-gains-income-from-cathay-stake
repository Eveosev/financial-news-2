Air China Ltd. (601111) , the nation’s biggest
carrier by market value, said first-half profit rose 10 percent
as currency gains from a stronger  yuan  and income from its stake
in  Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. (293)  helped offset lower fares.  Net income  increased to 1.14 billion yuan ($187 million)
from 1.04 billion yuan a year earlier, the carrier said in a
Shanghai stock exchange filing today, citing international
accounting standards. That exceeded the 1.02 billion-yuan
average estimate of five analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  Currency gains also helped China Southern Airlines Co. prop
up its first-half profit as a stronger yuan helps Chinese
carriers pare the repatriated value of dollar-denominated debts.
Air China and rivals are offering discounted fares as they
contend with the nation’s economic slowdown and intensified
competition from bullet trains.  Air China’s sales fell 3.6 percent from a year earlier to
45.9 billion yuan. It carried 37.5 million passengers in the
period, 7.8 percent more than a year earlier, and filled 81.1
percent of seats.  The carrier had 1.12 billion yuan of foreign exchange
gains, compared with a loss of 341 million yuan a year earlier,
after yuan appreciated 1.5 percent against the U.S. dollar in
the period. It also booked 44 million yuan of gains from its
about 30 percent stake in Cathay after the Hong Kong carrier
posted a first-half profit.  Shares of Air China rose 0.2 percent to close at HK$5.15 in
Hong Kong trading before the earnings announcement. The stock
has lost 21 percent this year, compared with a 3.45 percent drop
in the benchmark  Hang Seng Index. (HSI)   Air China’s passenger yields, a measure of average ticket
price, fell 13 percent to 0.60 yuan, according to the statement.
China Southern’s yield also declined.  China Southern, Asia’s biggest carrier by traffic,
yesterday posted a first-half profit as gains from the yuan’s
appreciation helped mask an operating loss. Still, the
Guangzhou-based company’s profit missed estimates and was the
worst in three years.  The yuan was the best performer in 24 emerging market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg in the first half.  To contact the reporter on this story:
