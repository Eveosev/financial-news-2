Taiwan dollar forwards declined for
a second day on concern global investors will pull more money
out of  emerging markets  as the U.S. prepares to pare stimulus.  Federal Reserve officials were “comfortable” with a plan
to reduce asset purchases this year if the  U.S. economy  improves,
according to minutes of their July meeting released last week.
Overseas funds have sold $2 billion more Taiwanese shares than
they bought this month, exchange data show. The Bloomberg Dollar
Index, a gauge against 10 major trading partners, advanced 0.9
percent in the past week.  One-month non-deliverable forwards fell 0.1 percent to
NT$29.95 per dollar as of 4:28 p.m. in Taipei, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. They touched NT$29.97 earlier, the
weakest level since Aug. 22.  “It’s part of the overall outflows from emerging
markets,” said Andrew Tsai, an economist at KGI Securities in
Taipei. “Everyone is going to price in the impact of a strong
 U.S. dollar , but it’s going to be smaller in Taiwan. The central
bank will limit the volatility of the currency.”  In the  spot market , the local dollar weakened 0.2 percent
to NT$30.06 against its U.S. counterpart, Taipei Forex Inc.
prices show. It was trading 0.1 percent stronger 11 minutes
before the 4 p.m. close. The central bank has sold the currency
in the run-up to the close on most days since March 2012,
according to traders who asked not to be identified.  The yield on the 0.875 percent notes due January 2018
dropped one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.15
percent in Taipei, according to Gretai Securities Market prices.  One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in
the  exchange rate  used to price options, rose five basis points
to 3.91 percent. The  overnight interbank lending rate  was
unchanged at 0.385 percent, a weighted average compiled by the
Taiwan Interbank Money Center showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
