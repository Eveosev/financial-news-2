JA Solar Holdings Co. (JASO) , the largest
photovoltaic-cell provider by capacity, agreed to develop three
100-megawatt projects in eastern China’s Hebei province.  JA Solar has approval for the first 50 megawatts of a
project in Lincheng County and expects to receive development
rights in Neiqiu and Xingtai counties by the end of the year,
according to a statement today from the Shanghai-based company.  “These projects are a major step forward as we look to
increase the role project development plays in our overall
 revenue mix ,” Chief Executive Officer Jin Baofang said in the
statement.  China expects to double its generating capacity by 2030,
with half of all new plants powered by renewable sources.  To contact the reporter on this story:
