Alipay.com Co., an affiliate of
Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., halted payment services at
traditional stores in  China  amid increasing competition between
the nation’s financial sector and its biggest e-commerce company.  Alipay, controlled by billionaire Jack Ma, stopped the use
of point-of-sale devices in stores today, Teresa Li, a
spokeswoman for the company, said in an e-mailed statement. Li
declined to elaborate.  The payment business, which started as a way for shoppers
to buy goods online, has expanded for use in retail outlets,
where it competes for transactions with state-backed China
UnionPay, the nation’s largest electronic-payment network.
State-owned financial institutions are stepping up their efforts
to boost services in the world’s largest Internet market.  “Alipay and China UnionPay are in direct competition,”
said Ricky Lai, an analyst at Guotai Junan International
Holdings Ltd. in  Hong Kong . “Alibaba’s expansion in financial
services online has convinced a lot of people there is potential
to make money, and the traditional banks would like to join
in.”  There are more than 10,000 devices in stores for Alipay
users, and the company is arranging for banks to serve merchants
on its network, Li said in the e-mail statement. Alipay has
partnerships with China Post, the nation’s postal service, and
 convenience stores .  Alibaba has been expanding into microlending and credit
payments after Ma said an outsider was needed to “stir things
up” in China’s financial services industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
