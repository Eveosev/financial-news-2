Seventeen-year-old Victoria Duval,
an American qualifier ranked 296th in the world, upset 2011
champion Samantha Stosur in a first-round U.S. Open match on a
day otherwise dominated by favorites.  Men’s top seed Novak Djokovic and five-time champion Roger Federer both advanced to the second round with straight-set
victories yesterday. The women’s No. 2 seed, Victoria Azarenka
of Belarus, won 6-0, 6-0 against  Germany ’s Dinah Pfizenmaier.  Duval, winning her first Grand Slam tournament match,
leaped for joy after ousting the 11th-seeded Stosur of Australia
5-7, 6-4, 6-4 in Louis Armstrong Stadium. Stosur made 56
unforced errors, 21 more than her teenage opponent.  “I played amazing today,” Duval said in a news conference.
“It was incredible.”  The top two American women are in action today, with
defending champion and No. 1 seed Serena Williams playing Galina Voskoboeva of Kazakhstan in the afternoon and No. 15 Sloane Stephens facing  Poland ’s Urszula Radwanska at night.  Men’s defending champion Andy Murray of Briton plays his
first-round match today against Michael Llodra of  France  and
American James Blake, who has announced he is retiring after the
U.S. Open, has a match with  Croatia ’s Ivo Karlovic.  Djokovic breezed past Ricardas Berankis of Lithuania 6-1,
6-2, 6-2 in Arthur Ashe Stadium last night for his 40th career
win at the U.S. Open. Serbia’s Djokovic has reached the U.S.
Open final the past three years and won the tournament in 2011.  “I managed to make a lot of breaks in the beginning of the
match and that’s what I wanted to do,” Djokovic, 26, said after
his one-hour, 22-minute win. “I’m very happy with the
performance overall.”  Federer’s Win  Federer beat Grega Zemlja of Slovenia 6-3, 6-2, 7-5 in hot,
sunny and windy conditions yesterday afternoon. They had been
scheduled to play on the opening night before rain pushed the
match back a day.  “Day session or night, at the end of the day it doesn’t
really matter when you play on Arthur Ashe,” said Federer, 32,
who is seeded seventh in the men’s draw this year, his lowest at
one of the four Grand Slams since he came to the 2002 U.S. Open
at No. 13.  Former U.S. Open runner-up Caroline Wozniacki, the women’s
No. 6 seed from  Denmark , and seventh-seeded Petra Kvitova
advanced to the second round. Kvitova, the 2011 Wimbledon
champion, is from the Czech Republic.  John Isner and Sam Querrey, the only two seeded American
men at the U.S. Open, both won opening matches yesterday at the
National Tennis Center in New York.  Isner, seeded 13th, beat Italian Filippo Volandri 6-0, 6-2,
6-3, in a 76-minute match. Querrey, seeded 26th, was a 7-6 (7-3),
4-6, 6-1, 6-2 winner against Argentina’s Guido Pella.  “Very good start,” Isner said. “Can’t ask for anything
better on my side.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
