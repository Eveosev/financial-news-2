Robusta coffee climbed for the first
time in eight sessions on speculation stockpiles will continue
to fall, prompting roaster buying before the next crop starts in
October in top-grower  Vietnam . White sugar rose.  Inventories in warehouses monitored by the NYSE Liffe
exchange will tumble 34 percent to 52,000 metric tons by the end
of 2013, the lowest since May 2000, the average of 10 trader
estimates compiled by Bloomberg showed. Rain in the largest
growing regions of  Indonesia , the third biggest producer, has
been as much as twice the 30-year average since April, according
to forecaster MDA Weather Services in Gaithersburg,  Maryland .  “Rains in Indonesia are still helping the market with some
supply delays and there’s still good demand for robusta,”
Edward de Wismes, an agricultural broker at Aurel BGC in Paris,
said by e-mail today.  Robusta coffee for delivery in November was 0.6 percent
higher at $1,782 a ton by 11:03 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in London.
The market was closed yesterday for a public holiday. Arabica
coffee for December delivery fell 0.5 percent to $1.1715 a pound
on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York . It rose 0.6 percent yesterday.  Arabica coffee prices, down 19 percent this year, will
continue to trend lower, said  Kona Haque , an analyst at
Macquarie Group Ltd. in London. There will be enough supplies
even if  Brazil , the world’s leading producer of the variety,
buys beans to stockpile, she said in a report e-mailed today.  “Next season’s on-crop in Brazil will be bearishly
supplemented with massive opening stocks,” Haque said,
referring to the year in which arabica trees in Brazil enter the
higher-yielding half of a two-year cycle. “While there may be
tightness in the high-quality arabica supplies, this will be
played out through differentials,” she said, referring to a
discount or a premium paid to obtain physical coffee in relation
to futures prices.  White sugar for October delivery gained 0.2 percent to
$484.20 a ton on NYSE Liffe. Raw sugar for delivery in October
slid 0.2 percent to 16.57 cents a pound on ICE.  Cocoa for December delivery was 0.3 percent higher at 1,641
