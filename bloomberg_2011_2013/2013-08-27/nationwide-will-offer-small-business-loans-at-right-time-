Nationwide Building Society , the
U.K.’s largest customer-owned lender, said it will begin lending
to small businesses “at the right time.”  “We have previously said that it is our strategic
intention to enter” the banking market for small and medium-sized businesses, the Swindon, England-based lender said in an
e-mailed statement today. “‘We will do this at the right time
for the society and its members.’’  Nationwide had intended to begin loans to small businesses
this year and will delay the plan until 2016, the Financial
Times reported. The lender said on May 2012 it would offer
services to small businesses ‘‘over the coming years.’’  Standard & Poor’s  cut Nationwide’s credit rating on Aug.
16, citing impairments on commercial real estate loans that are
harming the firm’s efforts to bolster capital. Nationwide said
last month, that unlike competitor  Barclays Plc (BARC) , it could comply
with demands from regulators to increase capital without turning
to investors.  Barclays, Britain’s second-largest bank by assets, is
preparing to raise 5.8 billion pounds ($9 billion) in a rights
offering scheduled for next month.  -- Editors: Jon Menon, Steve Bailey  To contact the reporter on this story:
