The forint fell for a second day and
domestic government bond yields rose before a Hungarian central
bank rate decision and amid worsening global market sentiment
caused by tensions in  Syria .  The forint weakened 0.4 percent to 299.73 per euro by 11:16
a.m. in Budapest, extending this week’s loss to 0.6 percent. The
currency has depreciated 2.7 percent since Hungary’s government
announced plans to phase-out foreign-currency household
mortgages mid-July. Yields on Hungary’s benchmark three-year
bonds rose five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 5.24
percent, a nine-week high on a closing basis.  The Magyar Nemzeti Bank will cut its two-week deposit rate
to a record 3.9 percent from 4 percent after 12 consecutive
monthly quarter-point cuts, according to 16 of 22 economists in
a Bloomberg  survey . Markets worldwide declined after U.S.
Secretary of State John Kerry said Syria will be held
accountable for using chemical weapons.  Syria “hit sentiment this morning” and  Hungary ’s rate
decision may move markets if the central bank chooses to cut at
a different pace than expected or the reasoning isn’t well-received, Karoly Bamli, a Budapest-based currencies trader at
Commerzbank AG, said in an emailed note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
