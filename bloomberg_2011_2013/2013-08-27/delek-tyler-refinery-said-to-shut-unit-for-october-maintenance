Delek US Holdings Inc. (DK)  plans to shut
an alkylation unit at the Tyler, Texas, refinery for maintenance
in October, a person familiar with operations said.  The work is expected to last five to six weeks, said the
person, who asked not to be identified because the information
isn’t public.  Matt Barkett, managing director of Dix & Eaton in Cleveland
and an external spokesman for Delek, didn’t immediately respond
today to an e-mailed request for comment.  The  Tyler refinery , which has a capacity of 60,000 barrels
a day, processes mostly light, sweet crude oil, including West
Texas Intermediate, according to the company’s website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
