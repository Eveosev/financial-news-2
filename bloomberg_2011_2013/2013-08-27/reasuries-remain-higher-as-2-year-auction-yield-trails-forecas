Treasuries rose for a fourth day
after the U.S. sold $34 billion in two-year notes at a lower-than-forecast yield as concern turmoil in  Syria  may lead to
wider military conflict boosted refuge demand.  Benchmark 10-year notes extended their longest winning
streak in six weeks as the Obama administration is constructing
the legal and political justification for a limited military
strike on Syria that would demonstrate international censure
against chemical weapons. The notes drew a yield of 0.386
percent, compared with a forecast of 0.390 percent in a
Bloomberg News survey of seven of the Federal Reserve’s 21
primary dealers.  “The situation with Syria seems to be building up to some
action, so you get a safety bid,” said Larry Milstein, managing
director in New York of government-debt trading at R.W.
Pressprich & Co. “It was a decent auction. It came in line with
expectations.”  The U.S. 10-year yield dropped eight basis points, or 0.08
percentage point, to 2.71 percent at 4:59 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices, the longest run of
declines since July 11. The 2.5 percent benchmark note due in
August 2023 rose 21/32, or $6.56 per $1,000 face amount, to 98
6/32.  The yield on the current two-year note fell one basis point
to 0.36 percent.  Index Extension  Treasury trading  volume  at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of U.S. government debt, rose to $322.67 billion,
from $187 billion yesterday. The figure is down from a 2013 high
of $662 billion reached on May 22 and up from a low of $148
billion on Aug. 9. The 2013 average is $313 billion.  U.S. debt was supported by month-end buying to match market
indexes. Funds that manage portfolios against benchmark indexes,
including the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index, typically buy
longer-maturity Treasuries at almost month-end to align the
interest-rate sensitivity of their holdings with the indexes.  The Barclays index will extend its duration, the measure of
rate-sensitivity, by 0.11 year on Sept.1, compared with 0.10
year on Aug. 1.  Treasuries have  lost  investors 3.4 percent this year,
including 0.9 percent in August, according to Bloomberg U.S.
Treasury Bond Index.  The central bank today purchased $5.2 billion in Treasuries
maturing between August 2017 and May 2018 as part of its
government-debt-buying program.  The bid-to-cover  ratio  at today’s auction, which gauges
demand by comparing total bids with the amount of securities
offered, was 3.21, the most since April and versus an average of
3.49 for the past 10 sales.  Bid Pattern  Indirect bidders , an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 19.3 percent of the notes, the least
since January and compared with an average of 25.5 percent for
the past 10 sales.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 26.1 percent of
the notes at the sale, the most since April and compared with an
average of 23.8 percent for the past 10 auctions.  Today’s offering is the first of three note auctions this
week totaling $98 billion. The government will sell $35 billion
in five-year debt tomorrow and $29 billion in seven-year
securities on Aug. 29.  The five-year note yield touched 1.51 percent, the lowest
level in more than a week, after rising to 1.72 percent on Aug.
23, the highest level since July 2011. A reasonable range for
the five-year is 1.52 percent to 1.62 percent, said Jim Vogel,
head of agency-debt research at FTN Financial in  Memphis ,
 Tennessee .  Key Range  “People will settle for the auction in this range,” Vogel
said. “People’s plans have been changed by the global reaction
to Syria and the potential aftermath there.”  This week’s sales will raise $38.1 billion of new cash, as
maturing securities held by the public total $59.9 billion,
according to the U.S. Treasury.  Treasuries investors remained bearish this week, betting
that the prices of the securities will fall, according to a
survey by JPMorgan Chase & Co. The proportion of net shorts was
at 2 percentage points in the week ending yesterday, the same as
the previous week according to JPMorgan.  About 19 percent were short in the week ending Aug. 26,
down from 21 percent in the week ending Aug. 19. The percentage
of investors in the survey betting that Treasury prices will
increase dropped to 17 percent, from 19 percent. A long position
is a bet prices will rise.  Client Sentiment  About 64 percent of the clients surveyed by the primary
dealer were neutral in the week ending yesterday, up from 60
percent the previous week. The firm does not disclose the number
of clients in the survey.  “We’ve backed up considerably over the last couple of
weeks,” said Thomas Roth, senior Treasury trader in New York at
Mitsubishi UFJ Securities USA Inc.  The Fed’s debate about when to taper $85 billion in monthly
bond buying has roiled financial markets around the world and
sparked a selloff in fixed-income assets. The central bank will
vote to scale back stimulus at its Sept. 17-18 meeting,
according to 65 percent of economists surveyed this month by
Bloomberg.  Treasury 10-year note yields have risen from a 2013 low of
1.61 percent on May 1 and reached a two-year high of 2.93
percent on Aug. 22. The rise in yields has halted by renewed
concern about the U.S. debt ceiling.  Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew yesterday told Congress in
a letter that the U.S. will hit the $16.7 trillion debt ceiling
in mid-October and urged lawmakers to raise the limit as soon as
possible.  To contact the reporters on this story:
