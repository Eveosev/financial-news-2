Ever walk through a design center, flip through a home remodeling magazine or scroll through a  home improvement website  and think “Why can’t that be my house?” Not everyone is as gifted as  “Cousins on Call”  or  “Million Dollar Decorator,”  but knowing what to focus on can go a long way! Here are four places to start. Inlays, trays and molding They don’t call it “crown” molding for nothing. Make your walls look like royalty. Simple molding can add character to any space and highlight specific features in a room. A tray ceiling can make any standard room stand out, and adding inlays on doors can make any entrance grand. Paint it up A simple paint job can go a long way, but a bad paint job can end up causing a huge headache. You may toy with the idea of becoming the next Picasso and feeling “one” with your paintbrush, but that doesn’t mean that your paintbrush feels the same way about you. Don’t give your walls the short end of the deal. Spend the additional money and hire a professional for the best look possible. Custom and convenience From custom closets to custom kitchens, anything and everything that’s made-to-order will immediately put the home in “glam” status — not to mention add convenience, organization and extra space. Time to shine A little sparkle can go a long way. Silky drapes, cashmere throws and metallic pillows can add both a whimsical and romantic vibe that will transform any dull home into a luxurious space. In addition, new, shiny fixtures can add a sense of “wealth” to any average old item. Related items from  Zillow Blog : Samantha (Sam) DeBianchi  is a Realtor and founder of  DeBianchi Real Estate .
