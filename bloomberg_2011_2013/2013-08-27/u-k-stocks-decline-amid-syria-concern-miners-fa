U.K. stocks  fell from a one-week
high as commodity producers declined amid political tension
between U.S. and Syria, outweighing gains in retailers.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  and Rio Tinto Group, the world’s biggest
mining companies, each slid more than 1.5 percent.  Marks &
Spencer Group Plc (MKS)  and  Next Plc (NXT)  rose more than 1.5 percent as
Bank of America Corp. named them its top picks among European
retailers.  Petrofac Ltd. (PFC)  jumped 4.5 percent after reporting
first-half profit that beat estimates and raising its dividend.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  dropped 45.54 points, or 0.7 percent, to
6,446.56 at 8:54 a.m. in London. The gauge  has still gained  6.9
percent from a low on June 24 as the Bank of England gave
forward guidance on interest rates for the first time. The
broader FTSE All-Share Index also retreated 0.7 percent today,
while Ireland’s ISEQ Index lost 0.9 percent.  U.S. Secretary of State  John Kerry  yesterday said his
government will hold Syria accountable for using chemical
weapons against residents of a Damascus suburb. President Barack
Obama is facing pressure from U.S. allies and Congress to take
military action against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, after
an attack last week that local opposition groups say killed more
than 1,300 people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
