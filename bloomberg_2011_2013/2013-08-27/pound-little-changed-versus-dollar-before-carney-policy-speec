U.K. government bonds rose, pushing
10-year yields down the most in 11 months, amid speculation  Bank
of England  Governor  Mark Carney  will use a speech tomorrow to
affirm his intention to keep interest rates at a record low.  Two-year gilt yields dropped the most since June after
Deputy Governor Charlie Bean said in an interview late last week
that policy makers are sending a “clear signal” that they
won’t increase interest rates anytime soon. U.K. financial
markets were shut for a holiday yesterday when Treasuries
rallied after a report showed U.S. durable-goods orders slid by
the most in almost a year. The pound weakened against most of
its 16 major counterparts.  “We’re partly playing catch up from yesterday,” said  John Wraith , a fixed-income strategist at Bank of America Corp. in
 London . “Carney’s clearly put a lot of credibility on the line
by introducing forward guidance this early and against the
improvement in the data so he’s going to want to reinforce the
message. We’re comfortable with the move we’re seeing and think
it can go further at the front end particularly.”  The benchmark  10-year yield  fell 12 basis points, or 0.12
percentage point, from yesterday to 2.60 percent at 4:06 p.m.
London time. That’s the biggest one-day decline since Sept. 26,
2012. The 1.75 percent gilt due in September 2022 rose 0.895, or
8.95 pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,554) face amount, to 93.20.  The two-year yield dropped six basis points to 0.40
percent, the steepest drop since June 26.  Carney Address  Carney’s speech in  Nottingham ,  England , will be his first
policy address since announcing Aug. 7 that officials wouldn’t
consider raising  rates  before unemployment fell to 7 percent as
long as price and financial stability weren’t jeopardized. The
10-year gilt yield climbed to 2.76 percent on Aug. 22, the
highest level since August 2011.  The Bank of England governor has sought to underpin the
recovery by introducing interest-rate guidance to damp
speculation that borrowing costs will rise. Policy makers left
the  official bank rate  at 0.5 percent and maintained the central
bank’s  asset-purchase target , known a quantitative easing, at
375 billion pounds at their most recent meeting ended Aug. 1.  The central bank is “communicating not just to market
participants, but to people, to households and businesses, to
give them a clear signal that  interest rates  are not likely to
rise imminently,” Bean said in an Aug. 23 interview in  Jackson
Hole ,  Wyoming .  Durable Goods  Treasury yields dropped from an almost two-year high
yesterday after the U.S. Commerce Department said  durable goods 
orders fell 7.3 percent, the biggest drop since August 2012. The
 Treasury 10-year yield  declined three basis points to 2.75
percent today after sliding three basis points yesterday.  “Given the likelihood that Mr. Carney puts up a fight
against recent market moves, gilts look the best of the major
government bond markets to open bullish trades after the weaker
U.S. data,” Kit Juckes, a global strategist at Societe Generale
SA in London, wrote in a note to clients.  Short-sterling futures advanced, indicating investors are
reducing their bets on higher interest rates. The implied yield
on the contract expiring in December 2014 fell four basis points
to 0.88 percent.  The  additional yield  investors demand to hold 10-year gilts
over their two-year counterparts shrank five basis points to 220
basis points, the narrowest since Aug. 15.  Gilts lost investors 4.1 percent this year through
yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. German
bonds dropped 2.4 percent and Treasuries declined 3.4 percent.  Pound Falls  The pound dropped 0.2 percent to $1.5543 after declining to
$1.5482, the lowest level since Aug. 14. Sterling fell 0.4
percent to 86.17 pence per euro after depreciating to 86.23
pence, the weakest since Aug. 7.  Options traders have become more bearish on the pound this
month, so-called 25-delta risk reversals show. The premium for
three-month options granting the right to sell the pound versus
the dollar relative to those allowing for purchases was at 1.53
percentage points, from 1.34 on July 31 and 0.53 at the end of
last year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “Citi economists expect the governor to highlight that QE
may be used again to counter a sustained increase in gilt
yields,”  Valentin Marinov , head of European, Group-of-10
currency strategy at Citigroup Inc. in London, wrote in an e-mailed report. “The speech could weigh on sterling and support
euro-sterling.”  The pound has strengthened 5.4 percent in the past six
months, the best performer of 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro
gained 4.7 percent and the dollar climbed 2.5 percent.  Volatility on gilts was the highest in developed markets
today, followed by those of Denmark and  Israel , according to
measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between two- and 10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  To contact the reporter on this story:
