Visitors to Google's Palestine website yesterday were temporarily redirected to a page calling for Israel's removal from Google Maps. It was the second time this year that the Internet giant had become entangled in conflicts in the Middle East. "For a short period, some users visiting google.ps were redirected to a different website," Google said in an e-mailed statement. "Google services for the google.ps domain were not hacked." Pro-Palestinian hackers changed the IP address of the Palestine domain, sending users to a defaced site titled "Google Owned," according to the Israeli daily newspaper  Haaretz . A visit to the domain today revealed nothing unusual. "We've been in contact with the organization responsible for managing this domain name, and the issue should be resolved," Google said. Google sparked uproar in Israel in May when it  changed the taglines  on its websites from "Palestinian territories" to "Palestine." Peace talks between the two sides resumed  recently after a three-year breakdown.
