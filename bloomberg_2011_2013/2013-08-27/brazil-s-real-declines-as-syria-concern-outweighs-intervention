Brazil’s real fell after U.S.
Secretary of State  John Kerry  said  Syria  will be held
accountable for using chemical weapons, outweighing the central
bank’s $60 billion program to stem the real’s slide.  The real fell 1.3 percent to 2.4117 per dollar at 9:43 a.m.
in Sao Paulo. Swap rates due January 2015 rose eight basis
points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 10.42 percent.  Kerry said President  Barack Obama  believes there must be
accountability for the “moral obscenity” of using chemical
weapons, fanning concern unrest may disrupt Middle East oil
supplies.  “The problems in Syria are a new spark in an already
complicated scenario”, Jose Carlos Amado, trader at Brazilian
brokerage Renascença DTVM, said by phone from Sao Paulo.  Brazilian central bankers start a two-day policy meeting
today. Forty-four of 46 economists surveyed by Bloomberg predict
they will raise the target lending rate to 9 percent from 8.5
percent.  The real rallied the most in almost two years on Aug. 23,
the day after the central bank unveiled a $60 billion plan to
shore up the real by auctioning $1 billion of dollar loans every
Friday and offering $500 million of currency swaps Monday
through Thursday for the rest of the year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
