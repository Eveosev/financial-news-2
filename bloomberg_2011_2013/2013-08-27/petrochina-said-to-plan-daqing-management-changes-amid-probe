PetroChina Co. (857) , the nation’s biggest
energy producer, plans management changes at its  Daqing oilfield 
in northeast  China  after a government probe of the unit’s top
executive, said two people familiar with the situation.  An announcement may come later today, said the two people,
who asked not to be named as they don’t have authority to
disclose the news. The state-owned company suspended trading
today ahead of the announcement of an “important matter,”
according to statements posted to the  Hong Kong  and Shanghai
exchanges. Kunlun Energy Co. Ltd., a unit of PetroChina, was
also suspended from trading.  Wang Yongchun, deputy general manager at China National
Petroleum Corp., the state-run parent of PetroChina, and general
manager of PetroChina unit Daqing Oilfield Co., is under
investigation for “suspected violation of disciplines,” the
official Xinhua Newsagency reported yesterday, citing the
Communist Party’s discipline committee.  Three calls to CNPC’s General Office in Beijing seeking
Wang’s contact information went unanswered. An official
answering PetroChina’s general line in Beijing referred all
questions to CNPC’s press office, which didn’t answer three
phone calls. Li Hualin,  Kunlun Energy (135) ’s chairman and PetroChina
board secretary, did not answer three calls to his office line
seeking comment.  The Daqing oilfield in Heilongjiang province is one of
China’s biggest and was discovered in 1959. It produces 40
million metric tons of crude a year. CNPC controls 86 percent of
PetroChina’s shares.  Kunlun Energy is a crude and natural gas producer and
distributor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
