The trial over the merger of  AMR
Corp. (AAMRQ)  and US Airways Group Inc. should wait at least until March
instead of starting in November, the U.S. government told a
court.  Rushing to try the antitrust lawsuit isn’t a good idea
given the case’s complexity and the potential for the merger to
hurt competition and consumers, the Justice Department said in
papers filed yesterday in federal court in  Washington .  Short-term costs and uncertainties must be balanced against
“the need for a full and fair exploration of the claims at
issue, and the merger’s potential for long-term harm to
consumers,” the government said.  Given the volume of trial materials to be exchanged,
including interviews, expert testimony and data, “that is
hardly a leisurely schedule,” it said.  The Justice Department’s request for a trial date of March
3 “is entirely unreasonable” given that the department has
already been investigating the merger for more than 16 months,
Tempe, Arizona-based US Airways and Fort Worth, Texas-based
American Airlines said in a joint statement. The airlines
proposed a November starting date for the trial.  “The government cannot justify its slow trial schedule,”
the airlines said in the statement, noting that delays in
American Airlines’ exit from bankruptcy hurt its creditors,
shareholders and employees.  The case is U.S. v.  US Airways Group Inc. (LCC) , 13-cv-01236,
U.S. District Court, District of Columbia (Washington).  To contact the reporters on this story:
