WaterSmart Software, a San Francisco
provider of cloud-based technologies for water utilities,
announced the close of a round of $4.5 million in Series A
funding and will use the proceeds to expand.  The capital infusion, which will go toward expanding sales
and marketing nationally, was led by The Westly Group, the
company said today in a statement. Also participating were
Physic Ventures, Draper Fisher Jurvetson and Apsara Capital LLP.  The company said its analytics and increased water
efficiencies led to contracts with utilities in California,
 Colorado  and Texas including  Irvine  Ranch Water District and the
cities of  Sacramento  and Newport Beach. This is WaterSmartâ€™s
third round of funding starting with $900,000 in 2011 and $1.5
million last year that has also included Menlo Incubator and
Sand Hill Angels Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
