Mars Blend fell to the lowest level
in three years against domestic benchmark West  Texas 
Intermediate on speculation unplanned outages and seasonal
maintenance will reduce crude demand.  A 325,000-barrel-a-day crude unit remained shut at the
nation’s largest refinery, Motiva Enterprises LLC’s Port Arthur,
Texas, plant. Eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg estimated the
Energy Information Administration will report tomorrow a 0.2
percentage point drop in U.S. refinery utilization last week.  Mars Blend fell 55 cents to a discount of $2.70 a barrel
versus WTI at 4:05 p.m. in New York, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. It’s the largest gap since Aug. 25, 2010.  Gross inputs at PADD 3 refineries, the Gulf Coast region,
fell by an average of 7.8 percent in September for the past five
years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Southern Green Canyon weakened by $2.65 to a $4.15 a barrel
discount to WTI and Poseidon weakened by $1.15 to a discount of
$4 a barrel.  The premium for Light Louisiana Sweet narrowed by 40 cents
to $2.80 a barrel. Heavy Louisiana Sweet weakened by 10 cents to
$2.90 over WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
