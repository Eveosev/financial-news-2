Ibovespa  futures  dropped, following
the equity gauge’s first decline in three days, after traders
raised bets on higher borrowing costs in  Brazil  as policy makers
converged for a two-day meeting.  BM&FBovespa SA (BVMF3)  may move after Deutsche Bank AG cut its
recommendation on the exchange operator to hold.  Cia. de
Transmissao de Energia Eletrica Paulista , an electricity
distributor, may be active after saying Chief Executive Officer
Cesar Augusto Ramirez Rojas will step down in October.  Ibovespa futures contracts expiring in October fell 1.4
percent to 50,140 at 9:24 a.m. in Sao Paulo. The real weakened
1.5 percent to 2.4150 per dollar. Swap rates on contracts due in
January 2015 rose 10 basis points, or 0.1 percentage point, to
10.44 percent. Brazil’s central bank has increased the target
lending rate known as the Selic by 1.25 percentage points in
2013 from a record low 7.25 percent to control inflation.  “The tightening cycle could be more prolonged than our
current Selic forecast of 9.25 percent by the end of this
year,” JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s economists including Fabio Akira
wrote in a research note to clients, citing concern that a
weaker real will fuel inflation.  The Ibovespa has gained 14 percent from this year’s  low  on
July 3 as higher commodities prices and a weaker real boosted
raw-material exporters. Brazil’s benchmark gauge climbed 8.3
percent in dollar terms in this period, which compares with an
advance of 0.9 percent for the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index of 21
developing nations’ equities.  Trading volume of stocks in  Sao Paulo  was 5.21 billion
reais yesterday, compared with a daily average of 7.76 billion
reais this year through Aug. 23, according to data  compiled  by
the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
