Copper fell for the first time in
three days as a bigger-than-expected drop in U.S. durable-goods
orders stoked concern demand in the world’s second-biggest user
will slow and as tensions mounted in the  Middle East .  The metal for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange declined as much as 0.7 percent to at $7,309 a metric
ton and traded at $7,343.50 at 10:59 a.m. in Tokyo. The London
market was closed yesterday for a bank holiday.  Bookings for goods meant to last at least three years
tumbled 7.3 percent in July, the Commerce Department said
yesterday, compared with a median forecast in a Bloomberg survey
for a 4 percent drop. Secretary of State  John Kerry  said the
U.S. will hold Syria accountable for using chemical weapons
against its people. Equities fell in Asia.  “The U.S. durable-goods orders were a surprise,” said
Hwang Il Doo, a senior trader at Korea Exchange Bank Futures Co.
in Seoul. “That deepened concerns over U.S. metal demand. The
unrest in Syria also damped a  market sentiment  as investors
tried to avoid risky assets.”  Copper may trade in a range between $7,250 and $7,400 in
short term, Hwang said.  Futures for delivery in December on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange declined 1 percent to 52,830  yuan  ($8,629) a ton. Metal
for delivery in December was 0.5 percent higher at $3.3425 a
pound on the Comex in  New York .  On the LME, zinc, tin and nickel fell, while lead climbed
and aluminum was little changed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
