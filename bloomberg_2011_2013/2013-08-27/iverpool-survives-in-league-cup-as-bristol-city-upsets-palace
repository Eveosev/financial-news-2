Liverpool and Hull needed extra time
to defeat lower-division teams in the second round of the League
Cup, while Fulham advanced in a penalty shootout and Crystal
Palace was upset.  Liverpool beat Notts County 4-2 last night and Hull won 1-0
at Leyton Orient as Premier League clubs not participating in
 Europe  entered English soccer’s second-tier club competition.
Fulham beat Burton Albion 5-4 on penalty kicks after a 2-2 draw
and Crystal Palace fell 2-1 at Bristol City.  Daniel Sturridge  got his second goal of the game to lift
his tally to nine in his past eight matches as record eight-time
winner Liverpool scored twice in the extra period against League
One’s Notts County. Jordan Henderson added the fourth.  Raheem Sterling and Sturridge gave the Reds a 2-0 first-half lead at Anfield before Yoann Arguin and Adam Coombes tied
the game for Notts County. Sturridge made it 3-2 in the 105th
minute and Henderson clinched the win five minutes later.  Robbie Brady scored in the 107th minute to give Hull the
win at League One leader Leyton Orient, while David Stockdale
made the only save of the shootout as Fulham survived against
League Two’s Burton Albion.  Jay Emmanuel-Thomas and Scott Wagstaff scored in the second
half to lead Bristol City to the home win against Crystal Palace.
Sunderland scored three goals after the 87th minute to stun
Milton Keynes Dons 4-2, Norwich beat Bury 6-3, West Ham defeated
Cheltenham 2-1, West Brom was a 3-0 winner against Newport
County, while Southampton won 5-1 at Barnsley.
