The Treasury Department’s $34
billion sale of two-year notes may draw a  yield  of 0.390
percent, according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey of seven of the Federal Reserve’s 21 primary dealers.  The securities, which mature in August 2015, yielded 0.395
percent in pre-auction trading. Bids are due by 1 p.m. New York
time. Last month’s sale of the securities yielded 0.336 percent
and the record auction low was 0.220  percent  on July 24, 2012.  The size of today’s offering is the first cut in issuance
since October 2010. The Treasury has sold $35 billion at the
past 34 sales of two-year notes. The securities peaked at $44
billion from October 2009 through April 2010.  The July 23 offering’s  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges
demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was
3.08, up from 3.05 the previous month. The average ratio for the
past 10 auctions was 3.49.  Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 30.4 percent of the notes at the
July sale. The average for the past 10 auctions is 25.5 percent.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 16.4 percent of
the notes at the last sale, compared with an average of 23.8
percent at the past 10 sales.  Two-year notes have gained 0.03 percent this year, compared
with a decline of 3.5 percent by Treasuries overall, according
to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The two-year
securities returned 0.3 percent in 2012, while Treasuries
overall rose 2.2 percent.  Today’s offering is the first of three note auctions this
week totaling $98 billion. The government will sell $35 billion
in five-year debt tomorrow and $29 billion in seven-year
securities on Aug. 29  The sales will raise $38.1 billion of new cash, as maturing
securities held by the public total $59.9 billion, according to
the U.S. Treasury.  The Fed’s primary dealers trade government securities with
the central bank and are obligated to bid in Treasury auctions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
