The drug-testing laboratory that
would be responsible for Olympic and soccer  World Cup  testing in
 Rio de Janeiro  had its accreditation revoked by the  World Anti-Doping Agency .  The LAB DOP-LADETEC/IQ-UFRJ Doping Control Laboratory,
known as LADETEC, will no longer be authorized to carry out any
anti-doping activities for WADA, which announced the decision
today in an e-mailed statement. The penalty takes effect Sept.
25.  WADA didn’t elaborate on why the lab’s accreditation was
revoked, other than saying it didn’t meet the requirements of
the International Standard for Laboratories. This is the second
time that LADETEC has fallen below those standards, according to
the statement, and the lab was suspended for nine months in
January 2012 before being reinstated.  Today’s news comes three weeks after Montreal-based WADA
announced the lab’s accreditation was suspended. WADA’s
executive committee made the decision to revoke the
accreditation after a review by its disciplinary panel.  LADETEC can appeal the decision to the Court of Arbitration
for Sport within the next 21 days, according to the release. It
can also choose to reapply for accreditation through a fast-track process from the executive committee.  The only remaining South American  WADA-accredited lab  for
doping control analysis is based in Bogota. There are 32
worldwide, not including LADETEC.  The  World Cup  begins June 12, 2014, and the Olympics will
be held in Rio in 2016.  To contact the reporters on this story:
