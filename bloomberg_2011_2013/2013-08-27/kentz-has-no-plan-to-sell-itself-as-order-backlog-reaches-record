Kentz Corp. (KENZ) , the oil engineering
company targeted by two prospective bidders in recent months,
said it’s not looking to sell itself as orders rose to a record.  Both takeover approaches were “unanimously rejected,”
Chief Executive Officer Christian Brown said today in a
telephone interview. “We’re not looking at selling Kentz. We’re
focused on growing ourselves as a standalone entity.”  The stock rose 24 percent on Aug. 19, valuing Kentz at 670
million pounds ($1 billion) after the board snubbed a proposed
offer from  Amec Plc (AMEC)  of as much as 580 pence a share. M+W Group
also said it filed an indicative bid in July that was rejected.
Brown today declined to comment on a Sunday Times report that
unidentified investors would be open to a bid at 650 pence.  Kentz said its order backlog has grown 12 percent to $2.8
billion since June 2012. The Tipperary, Ireland-based company
submitted a record $4.5 billion of bids in the second quarter,
it said in half-yearly results published today in  London .  Kentz raised its interim dividend 20 percent to 6.6 cents a
share as earnings per share gained 23 percent to 33.25 cents.
The stock slipped 0.4 percent to 565 pence in London.  “We’ve delivered what we said operationally and we have a
great platform to grow from,” Brown said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
