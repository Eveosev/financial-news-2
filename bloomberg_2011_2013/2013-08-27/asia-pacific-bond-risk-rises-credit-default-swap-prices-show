The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region against non-payment
increased for the first time in three days, according to traders
of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  climbed 2 basis points to 161 basis
points as of 8:26 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. prices show. The gauge is set for its first
increase since Aug. 22 after falling from a two-month high,
according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index rose 1 basis point to 96 as
of 9:19 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup Inc. prices. The
measure, which has ranged from 90.9 to 110.2 this quarter, is
also on course for its first rise in three days, according to
CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices
quoted by dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index increased 1 basis point
to 122 basis points as of 10:20 a.m. in Sydney, according to
National Australia Bank Ltd. prices. The benchmark, also headed
for its first rise since Aug. 22, is set to climb the most in a
week, CMA data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . An increase signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while a drop suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
