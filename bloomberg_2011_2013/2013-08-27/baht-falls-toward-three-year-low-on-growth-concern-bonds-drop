Thailand ’s baht fell toward a three-year low and government bonds declined after a surprise drop in
exports added to concern  Southeast Asia ’s second-largest economy
will struggle to emerge from a recession this quarter.  Overseas sales  decreased 1.5 percent in July, the third
decline in a row and less than the 0.8 percent gain forecast by
economists surveyed by Bloomberg, a report showed yesterday. The
country will post a current-account deficit of $550 million in
July, according to another Bloomberg survey before data due Aug.
30, while figures released last week showed the nation entered a
recession for the first time since 2009.  “The trade data boosted concern about the possibility of
economic recovery in the third quarter,” said Tohru Nishihama,
an economist covering  emerging markets  at Dai-ichi Life Research
Institute Inc. in  Tokyo . “In addition, the nation has been
seeing a deficit in the current-account balance, putting
downward pressure on the baht for a while.”  The baht dropped 0.5 percent to 32.09 per dollar as of 8:45
a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency touched 32.17 on Aug. 22, the weakest level since Aug.
5, 2010, and has lost 3.2 percent this quarter. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in the  exchange
rate  used to price options, declined seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 7.13 percent.  Gross domestic product decreased 0.3 percent in the three
months through June from the previous quarter, when it
contracted 1.7 percent, the National Economic and Social
Development Board said Aug. 19. The agency cut its 2013
expansion forecast to between 3.8 percent and 4.3 percent from
an earlier estimate of 4.2 percent to 5.2 percent.  Global funds  sold  $1.2 billion more Thai bonds than they
bought this month through yesterday and pulled a net $1.1
billion from equities, official data show.  The yield on the 3.625 percent sovereign notes due June
2023 rose four basis points to 4.19 percent, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
