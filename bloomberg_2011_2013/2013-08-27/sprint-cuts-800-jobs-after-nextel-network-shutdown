Sprint Corp. (S) , the third-largest U.S.
wireless carrier, said it will cut about 800 customer-service
jobs, the largest employee reduction since  SoftBank Corp. (9984) 
acquired a controlling stake in the company last month.  Customer complaints have decreased, and satisfaction levels
are higher, requiring fewer positions, Sprint said. There are
also fewer users to serve. The company shut down its Nextel
network in June as part of a plan to revamp its technology,
contributing to a loss of 1.05 million monthly subscribers in
the second quarter.  The firings are “organizational adjustments being made to
meet the changing needs of our business,” Jennifer Schuler, a
spokeswoman for  Overland Park , Kansas-based Sprint, said in an
e-mail. Sprint started notifying most of the affected employees
last week. About a third of the workers -- 284 employees -- are
based in the Texas cities of  Fort Worth , Irving and Temple,
according to a letter to the state’s workforce commission.  Sprint plans to keep its total workforce steady at about
40,000, Schuler said. “Sprint continues to hire new employees
into positions that support our corporate strategy,” she said.  SoftBank, based in  Tokyo , completed its $21.6 billion
takeover of the company last month.  Sprint fell 2.3 percent to $6.75 at the close in New York.
The shares have jumped 22 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
