A  Missouri  bank chairman admitted to
using bailout money from the Troubled Asset Relief Program to
buy a luxury condominium in  Fort Myers ,  Florida .  Darryl Layne Woods, 48, pleaded guilty to misleading
federal investigators before U.S. Magistrate Judge Matt J. Whitworth today in Jefferson City, Missouri.  While serving as chairman of Mainstreet Bank and its
holding company, Calvert Financial Corp., Woods arranged for
Calvert to obtain $1 million in TARP money, more than $381,000
of which he used for the condo in 2009, according to a plea
agreement filed yesterday.  Woods failed to disclose that expenditure in response to a
use-of-funds inquiry from the relief program’s inspector
general, according to the plea agreement.  Under the agreement, his crime is a misdemeanor punishable
by as long as one year in prison. No sentencing date has been
set, Woods’s lawyer, J.R. Hobbs of  Kansas City , said today in a
phone interview.  “Mr. Woods accepts responsibility for the misdemeanor
charge negotiated with the government,” Hobbs said.  The case is U.S. v. Woods 13-cr-04035, U.S. District Court,
Western District of Missouri (Jefferson City).  To contact the reporter on this story:
