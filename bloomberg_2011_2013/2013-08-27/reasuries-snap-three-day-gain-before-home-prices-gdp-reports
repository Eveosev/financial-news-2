Treasuries advanced for a fourth day
as concern turmoil in  Syria  may lead to wider military conflict
bolstered demand for government debt as a refuge before the U.S.
sells $34 billion in two-year notes.  Benchmark 10-year notes extended their longest winning
streak in six weeks after U.S. Secretary of State  John Kerry 
said yesterday Syria will be held accountable for using chemical
weapons. The  Federal Reserve  purchased $5.2 billion in
Treasuries maturing between August 2017 and May 2018 as part of
its government-debt-buying program. The U.S. will sell $35
billion of five-year notes tomorrow, and $29 billion of seven-year securities the next day.  “The main driver today is from the  Middle East  - it’s
uncertainty,” said  Adrian Miller , director of fixed-income
strategies at GMP Securities LLC in New York. “The auctions
will be driven by Fed expectations as opposed to current
geopolitical tensions.”  The U.S. 10-year yield dropped three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 2.76 percent at 11:13 a.m. in  New York ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices, the longest run of
declines since July 11. The 2.5 percent note due in August 2023
rose 7/32, or $2.19 per $1,000 face amount, to 97 3/4.  Treasuries have  lost  investors 3.4 percent this year,
including 0.9 percent in August, according to Bloomberg U.S.
Treasury Bond Index.  Short Bets  Treasuries investors remained bearish this week, betting
that the prices of the securities will fall, according to a
survey by JPMorgan Chase & Co. The proportion of net shorts was
at 2 percentage points in the week ending yesterday, the same as
the previous week according to JPMorgan.  About 19 percent were short in the week ending Aug. 26,
down from 21 percent in the week ending Aug. 19. The percentage
of investors in the survey betting that Treasury prices will
increase dropped to 17 percent, from 19 percent. A long position
is a bet prices will rise.  About 64 percent of the clients surveyed by the primary
dealer were neutral in the week ending yesterday, up from 60
percent the previous week. The firm does not disclose the number
of clients in the survey.  “We’ve backed up considerably over the last couple of
weeks,” said  Thomas Roth , senior Treasury trader in New York at
Mitsubishi UFJ Securities USA Inc. “The auctions should go
fine.”  The two-year notes being sold today yielded 0.395 percent
in pre-auction trading, compared with 0.336 percent at the
previous sale on July 23. Investors bid for 3.08 times the
amount offered last month versus 3.05 in June.  Debt Ceiling  Treasury 10-year note yields have risen from a 2013 low of
1.61 percent on May 1 and reached a two-year high of 2.93
percent on Aug. 22. The rise in yields is halted by renewed
concern about the U.S. debt ceiling.  Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew yesterday told Congress in
a letter that the U.S. will hit the $16.7 trillion debt ceiling
in mid-October and urged lawmakers to raise the limit as soon as
possible.  U.S. government securities that mature Oct. 15 yield a
negative 0.006 percent, compared with a positive 0.004 percent
yesterday. Treasuries due Oct. 31 yield 0.032 percent, having
climbed from 0.029 percent yesterday and 0.027 percent on Aug.
23.  Fed Bank of San Francisco President  John Williams , who has
never dissented from a policy decision, said global coordinated
communication will be needed as policy makers try to wind down
stimulus in the world’s largest economy.  “That will help avoid at least somewhat the risks of big
market turmoil,” he said today on a panel in Gothenburg,
 Sweden .  The Fed’s debate about when to taper $85 billion in monthly
bond buying has roiled financial markets around the world and
sparked a selloff in fixed-income assets. The central bank will
vote to scale back stimulus at its Sept. 17-18 meeting,
according to 65 percent of economists surveyed this month by
Bloomberg.  President  Barack Obama  will hold the Syrian government
accountable for the “indiscriminate slaughter” of its own
people with chemical weapons, Kerry said yesterday. Obama hasn’t
decided whether the U.S. will take military action in Syria,
according to an administration official who asked for anonymity
to discuss internal deliberations.  Home Values  The Conference Board’s index of U.S.  consumer confidence 
increased to 81.5 in August from 81 the prior month, data from
the New York-based private research group showed today. The
median forecast in a Bloomberg survey called for a reading of
79.  The S&P/Case-Shiller index of property values in 20 cities
rose 12.1 percent in June from the same month in 2012 after
gaining 12.2 percent in the year ended in May, which was the
biggest gain since March 2006, the group said today in New York.  Revised figures from the Commerce Department on Aug. 29
will show the economy grew at a 2.2 percent annualized rate in
the second quarter, compared with an initial estimate of 1.7
percent, according to a separate survey.  To contact the reporters on this story:
