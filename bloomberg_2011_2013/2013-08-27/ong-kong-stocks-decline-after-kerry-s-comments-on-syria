Hong Kong  stocks  fell amid concern
tensions will escalate after U.S. Secretary of State  John Kerry 
said the president will hold Syria accountable for using
chemical weapons.  AAC Technologies Holdings Inc. (2018) , a maker of acoustic
components that gets more than half of its revenue from the
U.S., dropped 2.1 percent. China Southern Airlines Co. dropped
3.8 percent after missing earnings estimates.  Want Want China
Holdings Ltd. (151)  surged 9.6 percent after the snackmaker’s first-half profit beat expectations.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  slid 0.6 percent to 21,874.77 at the
close in Hong Kong, its biggest drop in a week. About four
shares fell for each that rose on the 50-member gauge. The
equity benchmark posted a 2.9 percent decline last week, the
most since the period ended June 21, as outflows from Asia
accelerated on expectations the  Federal Reserve  will cut
stimulus.  “Geopolitical risk is a concern but the biggest concern is
still Fed tapering,” said Christian Kielland, managing director
of brokerage BTIG Hong Kong Ltd. “Investors are likely to
remain cautious until the Fed meeting in September. There’s a
certain element of skepticism on Chinese data.”  An official report today showed China’s industrial profits
in July rose 11.6 percent from a year earlier, up from a 6.3
percent gain in June. The government will suspend the release of
industry-specific data from the purchasing managers’ index for
manufacturing due Sept. 1 because of accuracy concerns, the
National Bureau of Statistics said yesterday.  The Hang Seng Index retreated 3.5 percent this year, the
second-worst performer among developed markets tracked by
Bloomberg. The gauge traded at 10.5 times estimated earnings,
compared with 15 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Syria Conflict  Futures on the S&P 500 slumped 0.5 percent today. The gauge
fell 0.4 percent in  New York  yesterday after Kerry said
President  Barack Obama  called the Syrian government’s use of
chemical weapons against its people a “moral obscenity.”
Shares rose earlier as investors weighed how a drop in U.S.
durable goods orders might affect expected stimulus cuts.  Fed chief  Ben S. Bernanke  in May said the central bank
“could take a step down” in its record asset purchases
depending on the strength of the U.S. economic recovery. The
first stage may be to pare bond buying in September by $10
billion to a $75 billion monthly pace, according to economists
surveyed by Bloomberg on Aug. 9-13.  AAC Technologies slid 2.1 percent to HK$34.55. Li & Fung
Ltd., a supplier of toys and clothes to Wal-Mart Stores Inc.,
retreated 0.8 percent to HK$11.82.  China Shares  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, also known as the  H-share index , fell 0.9 percent to 9,988.23 today. The gauge
dropped 18 percent from a Feb. 1 high on concern  China ’s growth
is slowing and that the U.S. will taper the flow of stimulus.
The measure traded at 1.2 times book value, compared with a
five-year average of 1.77.  China Southern Airlines dropped 3.8 percent to HK$2.81. The
carrier’s first-half profit fell 19 percent to 344 million  yuan 
from a year earlier, the worst result in three years. Analysts
in a Bloomberg survey had expected net income of 516 million
yuan.  Belle International Holdings Ltd. (1880) , a retailer of woman’s
footwear, retreated 3.1 percent to HK$10.66. Its shares
yesterday jumped the most since July 4 after reporting first-half earnings.  Hisense Kelon Electrical Holdings Co. (921) , which sells
refrigerators, was suspended from trading in the afternoon
pending a statement on development of “significant”
litigation, according to a statement to the city’s bourse.  Want Want  Among stocks that climbed, Want Want surged 9.6 percent to
HK$11.42,  leading  gains on the  Hang Seng Index . First-half
profit climbed 33 percent from a year earlier to $307.6 million,
topping estimates for a $286.8 million gain.  Evergrande Real Estate Group Ltd. (3333)  gained 3 percent to
HK$3.40. China’s biggest developer by sales volume reported
first-half underlying profit climbed 23 percent as the company
sold the most property by area among Chinese developers in the
period, according to China Real Estate Information Corp.  The HSI Volatility Index gained 4.8 percent to 19.41,
indicating traders expect the equity benchmark to swing 5.6
percent in the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
