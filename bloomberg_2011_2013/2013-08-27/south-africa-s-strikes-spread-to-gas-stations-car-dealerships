Strikes in  South Africa  will spread
to gas stations and car dealerships after a deadlock in wage
negotiations with employers, a union said.  About 72,000 workers will down tools on Sept. 2 after a
breakdown in talks between the union, the Fuel Retailers
Association and Retail Motor Industry Organization, the
Johannesburg-based  National Union of Metalworkers of South
Africa  said in an e-mailed statement today. The proposed strike
follows a walkout from Aug. 19 of around 30,000 workers in car
plants operated by manufacturers including Toyota Motor Corp.,
Bayerische Motoren Werke AG and  Volkswagen AG. (VOW)   Africa’s biggest economy has been wracked by labor disputes
for more than a year, hurting economic growth. Work stoppages
are in progress at construction companies and state-owned
airline  South African Airways , while strikes are being
threatened in the gold mining industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
