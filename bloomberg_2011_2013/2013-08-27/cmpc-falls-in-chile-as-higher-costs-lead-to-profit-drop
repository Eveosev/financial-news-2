Empresas CMPC SA (CMPC) ,  Chile ’s second-largest pulp exporter, fell the most in three weeks after
reporting an unexpected drop in second-quarter profit on higher
costs in its forestry and tissue divisions.  CMPC retreated 4.2 percent to 1,489 pesos at 3:53 p.m. in
Santiago, the most since Aug. 6 on a closing basis. The
country’s benchmark IPSA index lost 2.2 percent.  Profit in the three months through June fell 21 percent
from a year earlier to $30.6 million, according to a filing
yesterday. That compares with the $88.4 million  average  of four
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Banco Santander SA
attributed the difference to higher distribution costs in the
forestry division and expenses related to the opening of new
plywood and tissue plants.  “We expect an unfavorable market reaction to this negative
surprise and continue to wait for an improvement in earnings
visibility before becoming more constructive on the name,”
Banco Santander analysts Rodrigo Ordonez and Francisco Errandonea said in an e-mailed note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
