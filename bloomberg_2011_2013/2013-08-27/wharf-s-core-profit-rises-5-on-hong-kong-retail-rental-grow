  Wharf (Holdings) Ltd. (4) , the  Hong
Kong  builder expanding in at least 14 other Chinese cities, said
first-half core profit rose 5 percent after posting gains in
rental income from its shopping malls in the city.  Profit excluding property revaluations and one-time gains
advanced to HK$5.68 billion ($732 million) in the six months
ended June 30 from HK$5.43 billion a year earlier, Wharf said
today in a filing to Hong Kong’s stock exchange.  Wharf’s Times Square and Harbour City shopping malls in
Hong Kong posted gains as Chinese tourists continued spending in
the city even as the nation’s economy slows. The developer’s
 earnings  were partly offset by lower home sales profit booked at
projects in Chinese cities including Chengdu and Suzhou.  Shares of Wharf, controlled by the family of billionaire
Chairman Peter Woo, declined 1.6 percent to HK$65.55 at the
midday trading break in Hong Kong before earnings were
announced. They have gained 8.2 percent this year compared with
the 7.8 percent decline in the nine-member Hang Seng Property
Index of which Wharf is a member.  Profit from property development fell to HK$922 million
from HK$3.43 billion, Wharf said.  Operating profit from rental income rose 12 percent to
HK$4.56 billion, with contributions from Harbour City and Times
Square malls gaining 17 percent and 6 percent respectively, the
company said.  Retail rents  in Hong Kong will post their first annual
decline since 2008 this year as a pledge by the Chinese
government to limit additional stimulus adds to the risk of a
deeper economic slowdown, property broker Cushman & Wakefield
Inc. said in a July report.  Wharf will pay an interim dividend of 50 Hong Kong cents,
compared with 45 Hong Kong cents a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
