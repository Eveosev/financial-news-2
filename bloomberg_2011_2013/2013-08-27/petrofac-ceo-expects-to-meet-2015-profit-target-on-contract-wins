Petrofac Ltd. (PFC) , a U.K. oil and gas
engineer focused on the Middle East, said it will meet a target
to double profit by 2015 as new contracts boost revenue.  “We have a strong bidding pipeline and expect more awards
by the year-end,” Chief Executive Officer Ayman Asfari said
today in a Bloomberg Television interview with Francine Lacqua.
“The additional orders will underpin” earnings expectations.  Oil above $100 a barrel and dwindling output from aging
fields have spurred global exploration, increasing demand for
engineering services. Petrofac, which has won orders in  Abu
Dhabi , Oman and  Algeria  and today announced a contract in  Iraq ,
is counting on the backlog to raise post-tax income to more than
$862 million by 2015, more than doubling 2010 recurring profit.  Petrofac rose as much as 6.3 percent in London trading, the
biggest intraday gain since December 2011, after reporting a
record 21 percent increase in its order backlog today. The stock
was up 5.1 percent at 1,330 pence as of 10:55 a.m. local time.  The growth in orders “provides strong revenue visibility”
for the rest of the year and 2014, Asad Farid, an analyst at
Berenberg Bank, said in a note.  Net income fell to $243 million in the first half from $325
million a year earlier, London-based Petrofac said today in a
statement. That beat the $224 million average estimate of five
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The order backlog expanded to
$14.3 billion in June from $11.8 billion at the end of 2012.  “Our project portfolio is in excellent shape,” Chief
Financial Officer Tim Weller said on a conference call. The
company remains on schedule to achieve “modest” earnings
growth this year, it said.  Outside the  Middle East  and North Africa, Petrofac has
added contracts in  Mexico , where the government is opening up
oilfields to foreign developers. The company hopes to benefit
from the liberalization, it said today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
