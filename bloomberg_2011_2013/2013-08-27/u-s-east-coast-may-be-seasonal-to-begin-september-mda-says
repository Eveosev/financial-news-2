The eastern U.S. is expected to have
seasonal temperatures through early September while the hottest
weather may be concentrated in the upper Great Plains and
Pacific Northwest,  MDA Weather Services  said.  Near-normal temperatures will dominate the East from Sept.
1 to Sept. 10, according to MDA. Readings in southern  New
England  and New York may creep 1 degree Fahrenheit (0.5 Celsius)
higher than usual from Sept. 1 to Sept. 5.  “Major cool changes were made from the Midwest to the East
today,” MDA said in its forecast.  Energy traders look to long-range forecasts to gauge
potential fuel use. Above-normal temperatures in the large
cities of the Midwest and Northeast can increase energy use as
people turn to air conditioning to cool homes and businesses.  While readings in the East stay at seasonal levels,
temperatures may reach 5 to 8 degrees above normal throughout
the Great Plains from Sept. 1 to Sept. 5. That heat may shift to
the Pacific Northwest from Sept. 6 to Sept. 10, MDA said.  The normal average temperature in  New York City  on Sept. 4
is 73 degrees, according to MDA. In Boston, it’s 68; Chicago,
69;  St. Louis , 76; Houston, 83;  Seattle , 64; and in Burbank,
California, 75.  To contact the reporter on this story:
