PT Pertamina,  Indonesia ’s state-owned oil company, failed to receive offers in a tender to buy
condensate, or a grade of light crude, for September and October
delivery, according to an official.  The Jakarta-based company sought unspecified volumes to be
delivered to its TPPI petrochemical plant in Tuban, East Java,
said the official, who asked not to be identified because he
isn’t authorized to speak to the media. The tender closed
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
