Telecom Italia SpA (TIT) ,  Italy ’s biggest
phone company, hired a former executive at pasta-maker Barilla
Holding SpA as its head of personnel, according to three people
familiar with the matter.  Mario Di Loreto, 50, will take the position of human
resources and organization chief as of Sept. 1, said the people,
asking not to be identified because the information isn’t
public. Di Loreto, who held the same role at Barilla, one of
Italy’s most well-known food companies, will replace 54-year-old
Antonio Migliardi, who resigned consensually after a five-year
mandate, one of the people said.  Telecom Italia employed more than 82,000 workers as of June
30, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Di Loreto will
oversee the reduction of about 2,750 positions, or 5 percent of
the Milan-based company’s domestic workforce, after a March
agreement with unions in exchange for waiting a year before
Telecom Italia disposes of any call-center operations.  The personnel role will also be crucial for the success of
any asset spinoff. In May, Telecom Italia directors approved a
plan to separate the company’s fixed-line network. The move,
setting a precedent for  Europe ’s indebted carriers as they look
for ways to raise funds and bargain for lighter regulations,
would involve transferring as many as 20,000 positions.  A Telecom Italia spokesman, who asked not to be named
citing company policy, declined to comment on the appointment.  Italian Productivity  Telecom Italia shares rose 0.4 percent to 47.7 euro cents
at 12:39 p.m. in Milan. The stock has fallen 30 percent this
year, cutting the company’s market value to 8.7 billion euros
($11.6 billion).  Telecom Italia employees’  productivity  lags behind  Sweden ’s
TeliaSonera AB and Royal KPN NV of the Netherlands.  Revenue per
worker last year was about 355,000 euros, compared with 433,000
euros for TeliaSonera and 474,000 euros for KPN, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. It beats Orange SA’s 255,000 euros
and 250,000 euros for Deutsche Telekom AG.  Spain ’s  Telefonica SA (TEF) , by selling its call-center unit with
more than 150,000 employees, doubled its sales per worker to
468,000 euros in 2012, the data showed. Telefonica is the single
largest shareholder of Telecom Italia.  Unlike their peers in the U.S., European phone companies
serve more fragmented markets and governments often balk at
firings. Many have held back large-scale layoffs and have turned
to asset sales and dividend cuts to bolster finances.  European carriers will probably cut their workforce by 30
percent -- more than 300,000 jobs -- over the next five years,
according to an April estimate by the UNI Europa ICTS union,
which represents telecom employees in 27 countries.  Di Loreto graduated with a degree in philosophy at the
University of Rome in 1989 and holds a Ph.D. in philosophy of
science. His previous employers include Alitalia SpA and
Starwood Hotels & Resorts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
