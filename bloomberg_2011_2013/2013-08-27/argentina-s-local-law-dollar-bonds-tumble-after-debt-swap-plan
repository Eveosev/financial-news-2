Argentina ’s dollar bonds sold under
local legislation fell after President  Cristina Fernandez de
Kirchner  said the South American nation will offer to swap
holders of defaulted and restructured debt into the securities.  Prices on local law bonds due 2017 dropped 2.67 cents on
the dollar to 85.47 cents at 8:36 a.m. in  New York , their
biggest drop on a closing basis since April 12, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The yield climbed 1.05 percentage
points to 13.06 percent.  Fernandez said yesterday that holders of bonds issued in
the nation’s debt restructurings will be able to swap them into
notes governed by Argentine law in a bid to prevent payment
disruptions from a U.S. court ruling in favor of holdout
creditors from the 2001 default. On Aug. 23, a three-judge panel
said Argentina cannot pay holders of the restructured
international bonds unless it pays the defaulted bondholders in
full.  “The possibility of increased supply will keep pressure on
prices” of the local securities,Russ Dallen, head bond trader
at Caracas  Capital Markets  in Miami, said in an e-mail.  The extra yield investors demand to own Argentine bonds
over U.S. Treasuries jumped 16 basis points, or 0.16 percentage
point, to 1,091 basis points, according to JPMorgan Chase &
Co.’s EMBI Global index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
