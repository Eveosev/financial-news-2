Foxtons Group Plc, a real estate
broker based in  London , plans to raise 55 million pounds ($86
million) through an initial public offering and will use the
proceeds to repay all of its debt.  An affiliate of BC Partners Ltd., the private-equity firm
that bought Foxtons in 2007, will sell some of its shares in the
IPO, the broker said in a statement today. Some Foxtons
executive directors and employees will also have the opportunity
to sell shares, according to the statement.  Foxtons is benefitting from London’s booming housing
market, where demand drove U.K. house prices to a record in
July. British home prices climbed 2.6 percent from a year
earlier, and the increase would have been 1 percent without
London, real estate researcher Acadametrics and LSL Property
Services Plc said on Aug. 9.  The broker has 40 of its 42 branches in London and sells
homes mostly at prices from 200,000 pounds to 1.4 million
pounds, according to the statement. Foxtons had revenue of 120
million pounds last year and adjusted earnings before interest,
tax, depreciation and amortization of 38.3 million pounds.  Foxtons said the offering will represent about 50 percent
of the company’s issued share capital and it expects the shares
to begin trading in London next month. Credit Suisse Group AG
and Numis Securities Ltd. are joint sponsors and bookrunners for
the IPO, while Canaccord Genuity Ltd. is serving as co-lead
manager. Rothschild is acting as financial adviser.  BC Partners bought Foxtons, founded by Jon Hunt in 1981,
for about 390 million pounds in May 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
