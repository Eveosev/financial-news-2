Everton’s Ross Barkley and
Tottenham’s Andros Townsend were named to the England soccer
squad for next month’s  World Cup  qualifiers.  England manager  Roy Hodgson  gave the midfielders their
first national team call-ups for the home game against Moldova
on Sept. 6 and the away match in Ukraine four days later, the
Football Association said in a  statement .  Southampton striker Rickie Lambert, who scored the winning
goal on his Aug. 14 debut as England defeated Scotland 3-2, was
chosen again, while Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge returns after
missing the last match with an injury.  England trails Montenegro by  two points  in its qualifying
group, having played one match fewer. The top teams in the nine
European qualifying groups advance to the 2014 World Cup in
 Brazil , while the top eight second-place teams play off for four
places.  To contact the reporter on this story:
