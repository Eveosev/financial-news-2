Money managers  turned bullish  on
robusta coffee traded in London for the first time since May as
reserves head for a 13-year low before the first significant
shipments in December from  Vietnam  and while rain disrupts
supplies from Indonesia.  Investors held a net-long position, or wager on a higher
market, of 1,191 futures and options in the week ended Aug. 20,
the Commitments of Traders report published today on the NYSE
Liffe exchange’s website showed. That was the first bet on a
gain since May 28 and reversed a week-earlier net-short position
of 670 contracts. The beans used to make instant coffee fell 3
percent in the period.  Robusta coffee inventories in warehouses monitored by NYSE
Liffe will tumble 34 percent to 52,000 metric tons, the lowest
since May 2000, by the end of this year, the average of 10
trader estimates compiled by Bloomberg showed. Rain in
 Indonesia ’s largest growing regions has been as much as twice
the 30-year average since April, according to MDA Weather
Services in Gaithersburg,  Maryland . Vietnam’s next harvest
starts in October.  “Rains in Indonesia are still helping the market with some
supply delays,” Edward de Wismes, an agricultural futures
broker at Aurel BGC in Paris, said by e-mail today. “There’s
still good demand for robusta. Supply issues are leaving the
market tighter.”  Vietnam is the world’s biggest robusta grower and Indonesia
is the third-largest.  Cocoa, Sugar  In cocoa, money managers  boosted bets  on rising prices to
the highest since Sept. 18. The net-long position amounted to
54,382 futures and options as of Aug. 20, up from 49,567
contracts a week earlier. The beans used to make chocolate
gained 1.3 percent in the period as dry weather threatens to cut
output in West Africa, accounting for 70 percent of supply.  “The weather in West Africa has remained dry, raising
risks for pod development for the upcoming main crops,”  Kona Haque , an analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd. in London, said in a
report e-mailed today. “By reducing the outlook for both  Ivory
Coast  and  Ghana ’s new crops, we see a bigger deficit developing
for the 2013-14 season.”  In white, or refined, sugar, money managers boosted bullish
bets to the highest since Oct. 9, NYSE Liffe data on Bloomberg
showed. The  net-long position  climbed to 11,218 futures and
options from 9,405 contracts a week earlier. The sweetener fell
2.9 percent in the period.  In feed wheat, money managers reduced their net-short
position to 493 contracts from 522 lots a week earlier. The
grain declined 0.3 percent in the period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
