Julia Numair, who traded credit-default swaps indexes at  Citigroup Inc. (C)  before leaving in March,
joined an online “digital doorman” company founded by two
other ex-Wall Street credit employees.  Numair started last month as head of sales and marketing
for  Clean Cube , which provides dry-cleaning drop-off and other
services to New York residential buildings without doormen, she
said in an interview this week. The company was started by
Arthur Shmulevsky, a former UBS AG structured credit employee
who left the bank in 2012, and Ryan Agran, a structured credit
salesman at Morgan Stanley before departing in March.  Numair left Citigroup after almost five years with the
bank, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority records show.
Scott Helfman, a spokesman for New York-based Citigroup,
declined to comment, as did Megan Stinson of UBS.  Clean Cube puts passcode-accessed cubbies in the lobbies of
apartment buildings in  New York  that are used for laundry and
dry-cleaning drop-off. They plan to include package and grocery
delivery, security services, and building community boards,
Shmulevsky said in an interview. More than half of their current
backers work or worked in credit sales or trading, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
