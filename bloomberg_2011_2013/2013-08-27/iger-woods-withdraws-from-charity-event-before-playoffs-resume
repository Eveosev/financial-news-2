Tiger Woods has withdrawn from a
charity golf event set for two days before the U.S. PGA Tour
playoffs resume because of a back injury.  Woods won’t play in the  Notah Begay III Foundation 
Challenge at the Oneida Indian Nation’s  Turning Stone Resort
Casino  tomorrow in Verona, New York. His place in the sixth
edition of the event will be taken by Gary Woodland, the charity
said in an e-mailed news release last night.  Woods had back spasms during the latter rounds of the
Barclays, the first of four playoff events to determine the
winner of the FedEx Cup and a $10 million bonus. Woods finished
the Barclays in a tie for second place with three players
including Woodland, one shot behind winner Adam Scott.  The Deutsche Bank Championship is scheduled to begin Aug.
30 at the TPC Boston. The field comprises the top 100 players in
the FedEx Cup standings. Since Woods leads the points table, he
has the leeway to skip the tournament and still be among the 70
players who go on to contest the third playoff event, the BMW
Championship, which is scheduled to begin Sept. 15.  The playoffs conclude with the top 30 players contesting
the Tour Championship from Sept. 19-22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
