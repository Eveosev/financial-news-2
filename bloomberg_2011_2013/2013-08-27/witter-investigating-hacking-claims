Twitter Inc., operator of the
microblogging service for posting short status updates, is
looking into claims that its Internet domain information has
been compromised.  A Twitter account that claimed to be run by the Syrian
Electronic Army, which has made claims in the past of hijacking
popular accounts on Twitter, sent a message today that said
Twitter.com is “owned” by the group, according to a posting
today.  The group linked to an Internet-domain service that
appeared to show “SEA SEA” as the administrator name for
Twitter’s Web address.  Jim Prosser, a spokesman for Twitter, said the company is
looking into the claims.  -- Editors: Reed Stevenson, Jillian Ward  To contact the reporter on this story:
