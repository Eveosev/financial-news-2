South Africa  is considering a ban on
wine festivals and competitions as part of a curb on alcohol
advertizing, Business Day reported, citing proposed legislation
that’s yet-to-be published.  Online wine retailers and rating platforms may also be
banned, Melvyn Freeman, head of non-communicable diseases for
the country’s Department of Health, said, according to the
Johannesburg-based newspaper.  The measures, if enacted, will damage the wine industry,
said Michael Fridjohn, a wine industry professor at the
University of Cape Town.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
