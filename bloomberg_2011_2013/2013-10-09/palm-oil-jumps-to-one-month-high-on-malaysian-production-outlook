Palm oil climbed for a fourth day to
the highest level in a month on speculation that output in
 Malaysia , the world’s second-biggest producer, may have expanded
last month at a slower pace than predicted by analysts.  The contract for delivery in December gained as much as 0.7
percent to 2,365 ringgit ($737) a metric ton on the Bursa
Malaysia Derivatives, the highest price for the most-active
contract since Sept. 11, and ended the morning session at 2,356
ringgit. Palm for physical delivery in October was at 2,350
ringgit yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “There is some short covering ahead of the Malaysian Palm
Oil Board data tomorrow as the market is estimating that
production would not rise as much as expected earlier,” said
Donny Khor, deputy director of futures and commodities at RHB
Investment Bank Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. Short-covering refers to
investors reversing bets on further declines.  Output probably climbed 15 percent to 2 million tons last
month, matching the record in September 2012, according to a
Bloomberg News survey published on Oct. 7. Inventories expanded
13 percent to 1.89 million tons, while exports gained 2 percent
to 1.55 million tons, the survey showed.  Soybeans for delivery in November declined 0.3 percent to
$12.85 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, while soybean oil
for December gained 0.4 percent to 40.57 cents a pound.  Refined palm oil for January delivery increased 0.8 percent
to 5,544  yuan  ($906) a ton on the Dalian Commodity Exchange and
soybean oil advanced 0.9 percent to 7,064 yuan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
