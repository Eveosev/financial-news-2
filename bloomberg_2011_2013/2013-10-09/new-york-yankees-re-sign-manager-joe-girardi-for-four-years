The  New York Yankees  signed manager
 Joe Girardi  to a four-year contract extension.  Girardi, 48, is now signed through the 2017 season, the
Major League Baseball team said in an e-mail. While terms of the
agreement weren’t disclosed, CBS Sports reported that the deal
was worth $16 million, plus bonuses.  Girardi has led the team to the playoffs in four of his six
seasons, including the club’s 27th World Series title in 2009.
The Yankees have the best record in baseball (564-408) since he
took over before the 2008 season.  New York was 85-77 in 2013, finishing tied for third in the
American League East division with the Baltimore Orioles. It was
the second time in the past 19 years that the Yankees have
missed the postseason.  To contact the reporter on this story:
