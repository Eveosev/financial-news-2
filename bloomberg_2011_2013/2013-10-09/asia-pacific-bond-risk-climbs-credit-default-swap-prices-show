The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default rose, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  increased 3 basis points to 153 basis
points as of 8:33 a.m. in Hong Kong, Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc prices show. The gauge is set for its highest close
since Oct. 2, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index advanced 1 basis point to
123 basis points as of 11:25 a.m. in Sydney, according to
 Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  The benchmark is poised for its highest
level since Oct. 1, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index rose 1 basis point to 96.5 as
of 9:33 a.m. in Tokyo, Deutsche Bank AG prices show. The measure
is on track for its highest close since Sept. 30, according to
CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
