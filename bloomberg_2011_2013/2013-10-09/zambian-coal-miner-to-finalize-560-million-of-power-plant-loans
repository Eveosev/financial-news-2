Maamba Collieries Ltd., the Nava
Bharat Singapore Pte Ltd. unit building Zambia’s first coal-fired power plant in 50 years, said it will finalize loans of
$560 million by December.  Plans to have the debt in place by August were postponed
while the company waited for legislation exempting the
electricity industry from having to bill in local currency,
Janardhan Lavu, a spokesman for Maamba, said in an interview in
Lusaka, the Zambian capital, today.  “We’re hoping to have the funding finalized by December
and the funds available to us by February,” he said.  Maamba is building a 300-megawatt power plant next to the
 coal mine  it owns in Zambia’s Southern Province, near Lake
Kariba, to cover an electricity shortage that has cut output in
 Africa ’s biggest copper producer. The  African Development Bank 
agreed to loan the company $150 million as part of the total
project funding, the lender said last week.  Development banks, export credit agency-backed lenders from
 China  and commercial banks will provide the remaining loans,
Lavu said. The project will cost $800 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
