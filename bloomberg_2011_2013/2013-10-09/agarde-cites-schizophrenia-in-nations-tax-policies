Christine Lagarde , managing director
of the International Monetary Fund, said “something of a
schizophrenia” applies to many global governments when it comes
to collecting taxes.  “On one hand, they really want to go after the uncollected
or yet-to-be collected,” Lagarde said at a World Bank
conference in Washington, speaking with Bloomberg Editor-at-Large  Tom Keene  on a panel at George Washington University. “On
the other hand, you have competition between governments, some
of them saying, my corporate tax rate is only going to be so
much.”  Lagarde also said the U.S. and Japan have “tax space,” or
room to readjust their taxation policies to restore public
finances, and that European policy makers have “more often than
not” pursued quick fixes as they try to put their fiscal house
in order.  “Surprisingly they will eventually increase taxation on
labor,” Lagarde said, something she said should be avoided
during times of economic hardship.  Asked about President Barack Obama’s announcement today
that he is nominating  Janet Yellen , vice-chairman of the Federal
Reserve, to take over the top spot when Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke ’s term ends in January, Lagarde said “I am
overjoyed.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
