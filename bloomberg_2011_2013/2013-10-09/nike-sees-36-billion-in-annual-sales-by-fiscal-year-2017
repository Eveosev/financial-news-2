Nike Inc. (NKE) , the world’s largest
sporting-goods maker, said annual sales will rise to $36 billion
by the end of fiscal 2017, lead by its apparel unit.  The company also said it will have $30 billion in annual
revenue by the end of its fiscal year 2015, hitting the high end
of its own previous forecast for revenue of $28 billion to $30
billion by then.  “For Nike, no market is yet fully developed,” Chief
Executive Officer  Mark Parker  said in a presentation to
analysts. “Nike is a growth company, and our results over the
past 10 years have proven this true.”  The  company , based in Beaverton,  Oregon , has seen its
results anchored by growth in  North America , its largest market,
and buoyed by sales of basketball and running gear. That’s
helped it overcome revenue declines in  China  and mixed results
in  Europe .  Revenue from apparel will grow to $10 billion in 2017 from
$7.5 billion in fiscal 2013, the company said in a statement.
Women’s products are seen rising to $7 billion by 2017 from $4
billion and Nike’s Converse line is forecast to almost double to
$3 billion in annual sales, the company said, from $1.45 billion
in fiscal 2013.  Nike rose 0.9 percent to $70.89 at the close in  New York .
The shares have gained 37 percent this year, compared with a 16
percent gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Nike’s sales forecast equates to a compound annual sales
growth rate of 9.2 percent over the next four years. The annual
sales growth rate was 10 percent in the past three years. In the
past four quarters through Aug. 31, sales gained 7.1 percent to
$25.8 billion while net income rose 26 percent to $2.7 billion.  Gross Margin  The company’s profit has been boosted by its ability to
raise prices while maintaining sales growth. Nike’s gross
margin, the percentage of sales left after subtracting the cost
of goods sold, widened to 44.9 percent in its fiscal first
quarter from 43.7 percent. The increase was the third straight
after eight consecutive declines caused mostly by rising labor
costs in  Asia .  Analysts had forecast Nike revenue would grow to $29.8
billion in the fiscal year that ends in May 2015, even after it
sold its Cole Haan and Umbro units.  To contact the reporter on this story:
