Robusta coffee fell for a second day
in London in anticipation of a record crop in  Vietnam , the
world’s biggest producer of the variety. Cocoa gained in U.K.
trading on speculation processing data will signal more demand.  Vietnam will harvest a record 29 million bags of coffee in
the season started this month, forecasts Macquarie Group Ltd.
ED&F Man Holdings Ltd.’s Volcafe unit projected a 30 million-bag
crop in August and raw-materials trader  Olam International Ltd. (OLAM) 
expects 28 million bags. Prices are falling after rallying 6.1
percent last week, the biggest gain since February 2012 for a
most-active contract.  “Momentum from the recent sharp rally continues to fade,”
Sterling Smith, a futures specialist at Citigroup Inc. in
 Chicago , said in a report e-mailed yesterday. “Fresh Vietnamese
beans from the latest harvest should be making their way into
the market shortly.”  Robusta coffee for delivery in November dropped 0.2 percent
to $1,692 a metric ton by 10:19 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in  London .
Arabica coffee for delivery in December slid 0.2 percent to
$1.148 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York .  Robusta prices rallied as stockpiles monitored by NYSE
Liffe fell 19 percent in the two weeks to Sept. 30 to 60,380
tons. That’s below the 75,000-ton limit on deliveries to a
single trader. Roasters are tapping inventories as beans trade
at a premium to futures in the physical market.  New Crop  “Premiums are quite wide at $120 over the board,” Smith
said, referring to the exchange. “However, little business is
seen being done as buyers are holding out for new crop.”  Robusta for delivery in November traded at a $21-a-ton
premium to the March contract, up from $12 a week ago and
reversing a discount two weeks earlier. Higher prices for
earlier deliveries, known as backwardation, may signal limited
supplies for now.  Cocoa for delivery in December added 0.3 percent to 1,759
pounds ($2,809) a ton on NYSE Liffe. Cocoa for the same delivery
month slipped 0.1 percent to $2,714 a ton on ICE, erasing a
climb as high as $2,733. Third-quarter processing figures for
 Europe  and  North America  will be published this month.  “Most analysts expect that they will reveal an increase,”
the International Cocoa Organization in London said of the data
in a report e-mailed yesterday. “The anticipated recovery in
most developed economies stimulated demand for cocoa products,
especially butter.”  Refined, or white, sugar for delivery in December fell 0.1
percent to $496.70 a ton in London. Raw sugar for delivery in
March tumbled 0.7 percent to 18.49 cents a pound in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
