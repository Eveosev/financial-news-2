Rubber retreated from a one-week high
after the  International Monetary Fund  cut its global growth
outlook for this year and next, raising concern demand may
weaken for the commodity used in tires.  The contract for March delivery on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange fell as much as 1.1 percent to 261.2 yen a kilogram
($2,688 a metric ton) and traded at 263.1 yen at 10:30 a.m.
Futures jumped the most in five weeks yesterday to settle at the
highest level since Sept. 30.  Growth worldwide will be 2.9 percent this year and 3.6
percent next year, the IMF said yesterday, compared with July
predictions of 3.1 percent and 3.8 percent. It warned a U.S.
government default could “seriously damage” the world economy
while capital outflows would weaken  emerging markets .  “A slowdown in emerging economies may curb demand for the
commodity,” said Hideshi Matsunaga, an analyst at broker ACE
Koeki Co. in Tokyo.  Losses in futures were limited by speculation that the
 Federal Reserve  may delay tapering of its bond-buying program to
support the world’s largest economy as a political stalemate
over  government spending  continues, he said.  Rubber for January delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange lost 0.2 percent to 20,550  yuan  ($3,356) a ton. Thai
rubber free-on-board gained 1.9 percent to 79.5 baht ($2.53) a
kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research Institute
of Thailand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
