Progressive Corp. (PGR) , the fourth-largest
U.S. auto insurer, said profit dropped 16 percent as investment
income declined for a 12th straight quarter.  Third-quarter net income decreased to $232.4 million, or 39
cents a share, from $277 million, or 46 cents, a year earlier,
the Mayfield Village, Ohio-based company said today in a
statement. Operating profit, which excludes some investment
results, was about 36 cents a share, matching the average
estimate of 19 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer Glenn Renwick is seeking to attract
more customers to a product that tracks a person’s driving, a
technology that helps the company set rates. The Federal Reserve
has kept  interest rates  near zero since 2008 to bolster the
economy, limiting insurers’ interest income from bond portfolios
and increasing pressure to improve returns from underwriting
policies.  “What we’ve seen is a pretty steady negative trend in
investment income on a year-over-year basis,” said  Meyer Shields , an analyst at Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc., in an
interview before results were announced. The last time
investment income climbed on a year-over-year basis was in the
third quarter of 2010.  Investment income slipped to $107.4 million from $109
million in the third quarter of 2012. Net investment gains
narrowed to $27.9 million from $171.9 million in last year’s
third quarter, when the company sold some stock holdings at a
profit.  Premium Revenue  Progressive fell 0.3 percent to $26.53 at 4 p.m. in New
York trading. The company gained 26 percent this year, compared
with the 29 percent jump of the 21-company Standard & Poor’s 500
Insurance Index. Renwick’s firm, which reports results monthly,
had previously announced earnings for July and August.  Premium revenue increased 6.1 percent to $4.3 billion from
$4.05 billion in the prior-year quarter. The number of
individual auto customers climbed to 9.01 million, an increase
of 1.7 percent from a year earlier. That compares with the 5.4
percent gain in the 12 months ended Sept. 30, 2012.  Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A)  Inc.’s Geico, the third-largest U.S.
auto insurer, is competing against Progressive to sign up
drivers through phone and Internet sales.  Travelers Cos. (TRV)  has
announced job cuts as CEO Jay Fishman works to lower prices.
State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. and Allstate Corp,
the two largest U.S. car insurers, have also been promoting
direct sales after typically relying on agents.  Book value, a measure of assets minus liabilities, rose
about 4.1 percent to $11.32 a share from $10.87 on June 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
