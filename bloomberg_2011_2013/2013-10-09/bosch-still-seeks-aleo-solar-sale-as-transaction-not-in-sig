Robert Bosch GmbH , Germany’s biggest
autoparts maker, is sticking with plans to sell solar operations
after failing to find any preferred candidates to buy the unit.  Bosch aims to sell all or part of its 91 percent of panel
maker  Aleo Solar AG (AS1) , it said today in a statement. “If and when
a transaction takes place remains open,” it said. There are no
preferred candidates, Aleo Solar said in a separate statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
