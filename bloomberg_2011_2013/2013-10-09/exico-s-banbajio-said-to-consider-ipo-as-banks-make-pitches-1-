Banco del Bajio SA,  Mexico ’s eighth-biggest bank, is considering an initial public offering,
according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter.  The lender has asked investment banks to put together
proposals for the sale, said the people, who asked not to be
identified because the deal is in the preliminary stages and the
details, including timing and size, haven’t been set.  The offering would add to a mounting presence of publicly
traded lenders. Grupo Financiero Santander Mexico SAB, a unit of
Spain’s biggest bank, raised a record $4.1 billion in its
offering last year. Grupo Financiero Interacciones SAB plans to
offer about $350 million of shares this year. Small-business
financier Banregio Grupo Financiero SAB was included in the
nation’s benchmark index for the first time in September, two
years after its IPO.  A press official at BanBajio, which is based in Leon, a
city in central Mexico, declined to comment on the possibility
of a share offering. The National Banking and Securities
Commission ranks it as the nation’s eighth-biggest bank by
loans.  The lender, founded in 1994, focuses on loans to small- and
mid-sized businesses, as well as financing for the Mexican
agriculture industry, according to an e-mailed report from the
company dated August 2013. BanBajio has 284 locations in 28
Mexican states with almost 350,000 clients, according to the
presentation, which cited data through June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
