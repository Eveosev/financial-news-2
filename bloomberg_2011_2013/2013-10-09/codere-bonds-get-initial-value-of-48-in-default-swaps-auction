Sellers of credit-default swaps on
Codere SA may have to pay 51.875 cents on the euro to settle
contracts triggered by the company’s failure to make a timely
bond payment last month.  Dealers set an initial value of 48.125 percent of face
value at an auction for the Madrid-based gaming company’s bonds
today, according to administrators Markit Group Ltd. and
Creditex Group Inc. The auction is being held under the rules of
the  International Swaps & Derivatives Association  and a final
rate will be determined at 3:30 p.m. in  London .  Codere’s credit-default swaps are being settled because the
company, which has debts totaling 1 billion euros ($1.35
billion), paid a coupon on $300 million of 9.25 percent bonds
two days after the end of a 30-day grace period. The issue has
rattled the  derivatives market  because debt insurance holders
are being compensated for losses that haven’t been incurred.  “The risk is that if you have these sort of upsets, it
reduces liquidity because specialist players are less willing to
get involved,” said Michael Hampden-Turner, a credit analyst at
Citigroup Inc. in London. “Certainly people will be unhappy,
but the contract worked the way it should.”  Codere’s 9.25 percent bonds due February 2019 were trading
at 49.25 cents on the dollar yesterday, according to Bloomberg
prices.  Sellers of protection will pay buyers face value in
exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent.
The results of the auction are posted on  Creditfixings.com , a
website run by Creditex, a New York-based derivatives broker,
and financial information provider Markit.  There were 2,951 default swaps contracts covering a net
$432 million of Codere’s debt as of Oct. 4, according to the
Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. There were 34 trades covering
a gross $112 million of Codere’s debt last week.  The company was also included in 13 versions of the Markit
iTraxx Crossover Index and new versions of those benchmarks now
trade without it, according to  Markit .  To contact the reporter on this story:
