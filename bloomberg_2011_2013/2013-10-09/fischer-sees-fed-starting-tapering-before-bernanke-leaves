U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  may decide to slow the central bank’s monthly bond
purchases before his term in office expires on Jan. 31, former
Israeli central bank Governor Stanley Fischer said.  If Congress agrees to raise the debt ceiling and the
economy shows more signs of picking up, the Fed could start
tapering now or in December, Fischer said at an event in
Santiago today.  “I will guess as an amateur psychologist that the outgoing
chairman of the Fed would like to start the process before he
leaves to say, ‘I did all of this and it worked,’” said
Fischer, a former vice chairman of Citigroup Inc. and onetime
thesis adviser to Bernanke.  President  Barack Obama  will nominate  Janet Yellen  to
replace Bernanke, putting the world’s most powerful central bank
in the hands of a key architect of the stimulus program. Obama
will announce the nomination at 3 p.m. in Washington, a White
House official said in an e-mailed statement.  “We are in the dark in the current situation” about the
impact that tapering will have, Fischer said.  With the global economy improving,  interest rates  should
rise in the U.S. “pretty soon,” according to Fischer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
