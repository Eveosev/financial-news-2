U.K.  natural gas  futures expiring in
November will probably advance after forming an island gap on
 technical analysis  charts, according to FuturesTechs.  The contract is supported at 68.8 pence a therm, the high
point in trading on the ICE Futures Europe exchange from Sept.
17 to Oct. 4, Clive Lambert, founder of Futurestechs in Leigh-on-Sea,  England , said in an e-mailed report. The island was
created after the contract traded Sept. 17 below the low set
Sept. 16, and traded Oct. 7 above the high set the previous
working day, leaving gaps in the candlestick chart.  “The Island Gap held,” Lambert said. “Now we would like
to see the bulls building on this with a sustained push above
69.40 then 70.10. So far so good.”  The November contract was little changed at 69.40 pence a
therm at 11:51 a.m. London time.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
