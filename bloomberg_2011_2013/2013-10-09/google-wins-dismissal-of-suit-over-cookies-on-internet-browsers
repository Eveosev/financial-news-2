Google Inc. (GOOG)  won dismissal of a
lawsuit alleging it violated computer users’ rights by slipping
electronic “cookies” into their Web browsers to facilitate
placement of advertising.  Cookies are used to track browsing activity and can help
advertisers target potential customers. The users claimed that
Mountain View, California-based Google, owner of the world’s
largest search engine, “tricked” their  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and
 Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  browsers into accepting cookies, according to
court filings.  The consumers sued in federal court last year saying Google
impinged on their privacy in violation of federal and state
laws. The court rejected those claims.  “Google did not intercept contents as provided for by the
Wiretap Act,” U.S. District Judge Sue L. Robinson in
Wilmington,  Delaware , said in her opinion. The users also didn’t
“demonstrate that Google intercepted any ‘contents or
meaning’” under California’s Invasion of Privacy Act, she said.
Nor did the users identify “any impairment of the performance
or functioning of their computers,” the judge wrote.  Stephen Grygiel, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, and Michael Rubin, a Google attorney, didn’t immediately respond to requests
for comment on the decision.  The case is In re Google Cookie Placement Consumer Privacy
Litigation, 12-md-02358, U.S. District Court, District of
Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
