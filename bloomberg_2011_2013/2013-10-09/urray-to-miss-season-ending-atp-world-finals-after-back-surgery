Wimbledon champion Andy Murray will
miss the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals after undergoing
back surgery.  The 26-year-old had an operation last month to clear up a
long-standing back problem. The Scotsman will sit out the  London 
tournament as he rehabilitates in preparation for the 2014
tennis season.  “I’m really disappointed not to be playing this year, I
love playing in front of my home crowd, it’s a great
atmosphere,” Murray said on the ATP World Tour’s  website . “All
the players look forward to competing in London and I’ll be
doing my best to qualify again for the tournament next year.”  The back injury forced third-ranked Murray to miss this
year’s French Open. He became the first British man to win the
Wimbledon title since Fred Perry in 1936, lost to Novak Djokovic
in the Australian Open final and reached the quarterfinals of
the U.S. Open as the defending champion.  The ATP finals, which feature the top eight men in the
world rankings, will be played Nov. 4-11. No. 1 Rafael Nadal,
defending champion and second-ranked Djokovic and No. 4 David Ferrer have already qualified for the tournament.  To contact the reporter on this story:
