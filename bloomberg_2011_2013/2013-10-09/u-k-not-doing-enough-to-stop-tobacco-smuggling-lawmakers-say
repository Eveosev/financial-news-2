The U.K. needs to step up action
against tobacco smugglers and money earmarked for new
initiatives shouldn’t be used for business as usual, a panel of
lawmakers said.  The government should also tackle companies that oversupply
tobacco to European countries where it’s bought for smuggling
into Britain, the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee
said in a report published today. Supply of hand-rolling tobacco
exceeded legitimate demand by 240 percent in one unidentified
country, the report said.  “Each year tobacco smuggling constitutes a theft of
revenue to the tune of some 1.9 billion pounds, 20 percent of
the total sum collected in tax” by Her Majesty’s Revenue &
Customs, the committee chairwoman, Margaret Hodge, said in an e-mailed statement. “What concerns us is that three of the five
HMRC initiatives to further tackle smuggling funded from the
2010 spending review had produced nothing by March 2013.”  Estimates for the effect of projects funded in 2010 were
“over-optimistic,” the committee said. HMRC and the U.K.
Border Force missed their target for additional revenue by 200
million pounds ($320 million), it said.  The committee praised the success of programs in the
previous decade. Estimates of market share were 9 percent for
illicit cigarettes in 2010-11 compared with 21 percent in 2000-01, and 38 percent for rolling tobacco compared with 61 percent,
the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
