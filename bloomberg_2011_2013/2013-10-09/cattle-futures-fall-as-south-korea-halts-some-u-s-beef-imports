Cattle futures fell as  South Korea 
suspended some U.S. beef imports after finding traces of a
banned feed additive. Hogs also dropped.  The Asian nation halted a beef shipment from a U.S. unit of
JBS SA after detecting zilpaterol, also known as Zilmax,
according to a statement today from the Ministry of Food and
Drug Safety. The country has a “zero-tolerance policy,” said
U.S. Meat Export Federation spokesman Joe Schuele. Tyson Foods
Inc. and Cargill Inc., two of the largest cattle processors,
have halted purchases of animals fed the supplement.  “South Korea has been known to be picky at times,”
 Christian Mayer , a market adviser at Northstar Commodity
Investments Co. in  Minneapolis ,  Minnesota , said in a telephone
interview. “It is going to be negative.”  Cattle futures for December delivery fell 0.3 percent to
$1.31875 a pound at 11:03 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.  Merck & Co., which makes Zilmax, said Aug. 16 it will
suspend sales of the livestock-feed supplement in the U.S. and
Canada after cattle taking it had trouble walking or standing.  Cash prices for steers and heifers were higher compared
with last week on increased demand, according to Paul Crayeraft
at East  Texas  Livestock Inc. in Crockett, Texas.  Feeder-cattle for November settlement decreased 0.3 percent
to $1.65875 a pound.  Hog futures for December settlement fell 0.6 percent to
87.65 cents a pound on the CME, snapping five straight gains.  To contact the reporter on this story:
