First Solar Inc. (FSLR)  agreed to sell a
facility in Mesa,  Arizona , to an unidentified buyer at a loss of
as much as $60 million against book value.  The company expects proceeds of more than $100 million from
the sale, which will close this quarter, according to a
Securities and Exchange Commission filing today from the Tempe,
Arizona-based company. The site was intended to be a panel-production plant and was never commissioned.  The loss will be incurred in the third quarter, according
to the filing. The deal will also involve $5 million to $10
million in costs.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
