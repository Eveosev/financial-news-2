Pretium Resources Inc. (PVG) , the developer
of the Valley of the Kings gold discovery in British Columbia,
plunged the most in almost three years after a company
evaluating an ore sample quit the project.  Pretium fell 29 percent to C$4.95 ($4.76) at 10:56 a.m. in
Toronto. It earlier slumped 35 percent, the most intraday since
its December 2010 initial public offering.  Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd., hired for an independent
assessment of a 10,000-metric-ton ore sample, resigned,
Vancouver-based Pretium said today in a statement.  Pretium, which didn’t give further details about
Strathcona’s exit, didn’t immediately respond to phone calls
seeking further comment. No one at Strathcona was immediately
available to comment.  Strathcona resigned after it disagreed with another
company, Snowden Mining Industry Consultants, over sampling
methods, Dan Rollins, an analyst with Royal Bank of Canada, said
today in a note, citing conversations with Pretium’s management.
Messages left at Snowden’s Vancouver and Calgary offices weren’t
immediately returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
