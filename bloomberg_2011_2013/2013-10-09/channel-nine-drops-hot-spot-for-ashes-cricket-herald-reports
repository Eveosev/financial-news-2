The Hot Spot infrared camera
technology used to help cricket umpires make decisions by
detecting edges won’t be used in the Ashes series starting next
month, the  Sydney Morning Herald reported .  Nine Entertainment Co.’s Channel Nine dropped the system,
which uses heat readings to analyze whether there has been
contact between the ball and the bat or batsman’s pads, because
of concerns over its cost and reliability, the Herald said.  “It’s their decision and that’s what’s been communicated
to us,” Hot Spot’s inventor Warren Brennan was cited as saying
by the Herald. “As far as I’m concerned, it is final. We’re
just moving on with things. Channel Nine have got a new deal
with Cricket Australia which I know has cost them a lot more
money. I gather there had to be some restructuring of costs.”  Hot Spot’s absence restricts television umpires to using
ball-tracking software, audio evidence from stump microphones
and slow-motion replays when England or  Australia  review an on-field umpire’s decision during the five-match Ashes, which
starts Nov. 21 in Brisbane.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
