South Korea halted beef imports from
a U.S. unit of  JBS SA (JBSS3)  after finding traces of the feed additive
zilpaterol in a consignment of the meat.  The substance, banned in South Korea, was detected in a 22-ton shipment from Greeley, Colorado-based Swift Beef Co. on
Sept. 24, according to a statement posted on the Ministry of
Food and Drug Safety’s website today. South Korea asked the U.S.
to investigate, the ministry said.  Swift, part of Sao Paulo-based JBS, accounted for 5.8
percent of 75,426 tons of purchases from the U.S. in the nine
months through September this year, according to the ministry.
 Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN)  and Cargill Inc., two of the largest U.S.
cattle processors, in August halted purchases of animals fed
with Merck & Co.’s Zilmax supplement, also known as zilpaterol.
CME Group Inc. last month banned cattle with the additive from
delivery for its futures contracts.  South Korea, the third-biggest buyer of U.S. beef before it
banned imports after mad cow case in 2003, resumed purchases in
2008 amid widespread street protests against the move. It agreed
to phase out beef tariffs over 15 years when a free-trade deal
with U.S. took effect last year.  Japan , Asia’s biggest beef buyer, imported 515,108 tons
worth 221 billion yen ($2.3 billion) last year from exporters
including the  Australia , the U.S. and New Zealand.  China , the
world’s largest meat consumer, banned U.S. beef in 2003 over mad
cow disease.  Cattle futures for December delivery in  Chicago  were little
changed at $1.32250 a pound at 6:38 p.m. Seoul time. Futures
surged 8.2 percent last quarter, the first such gain since 2012.  Tyson Foods said in August that potential problems with the
supplement concerned animal well-being and not food safety.  To contact the reporter on this story:
