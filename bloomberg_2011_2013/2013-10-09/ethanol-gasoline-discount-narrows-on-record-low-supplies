Ethanol’s discount to gasoline shrank
as nationwide inventories of the biofuel fell to the lowest
level in  three years  of data.  The ethanol-gasoline spread narrowed 4.06 cents to 90 cents
a gallon today, the first contraction in four days, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The biofuel advanced after a government report showed U.S. 
stockpiles  slumped 119,000 barrels, or 0.8 percent, to 15.4
million barrels in the week ended Oct. 4, the least in U.S.
Energy Information Administration data going back to 2010.
Production slipped to  868,000 barrels a day  from 875,000 the
prior week. There were no U.S. imports.  “We have tight stocks and imports haven’t been anywhere
near what we expected,” said Will Babler, a broker at Atten
Babler Risk Management LLC in Galena,  Illinois . “That’s giving
support to prices.”  Denatured ethanol for November delivery rose 3.3 cents, or
2 percent, to settle at $1.723 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of
Trade. Futures have dropped 21 percent this year.  November-delivery gasoline slipped 0.76 cent to $2.623 a
gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The contract covers
reformulated gasoline, made to be blended with ethanol before
delivery to filling stations.  Corn for December delivery gained 1.75 cents to $4.435 a
bushel. Futures rebounded after falling the most in a week
yesterday on speculation that harvesting would accelerate across
the U.S. Midwest because of dry weather. The December crush
spread of corn to ethanol was 3 cents, up from 1 cent yesterday.  ‘Little Bit’  “There’s a little bit of corn out there already,” said
Jim Damask, a manager at StarFuels Inc. in Jupiter,  Florida .
“It seems more and more corn should become available as the
days go on. The longer into the harvest, the cheaper ethanol
should become.”  In cash market trading, ethanol rose 6 cents to $2.11 a
gallon on the U.S. West Coast, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Prices climbed 4 cents to $2.25 a gallon in  New York ,
fell 2.5 cents to $2.05 a gallon in Chicago and slid 0.5 cent to
$2.15 on the  Gulf Coast .  New York’s premium to Chicago grew 6.5 cents to 20 cents,
the widest in a week, while the West Coast’s discount to the
Gulf coast narrowed 6.5 cents to 4 cents.  The government tracks compliance with federal blending
mandates with Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs,
certificates attached to each gallon of biofuel that are
submitted to the government and can be traded among companies.  Corn-based RINs gained 3 cents to 42 cents, while  advanced
RINs,  which cover biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-based
ethanol, rose 2 cents to 52 cents, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
