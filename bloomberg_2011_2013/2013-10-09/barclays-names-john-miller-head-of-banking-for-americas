Barclays Plc (BARC) , the U.K.’s second-largest lender by assets, appointed  John Miller  to the newly
created role of head of banking for the Americas and named Paul Parker to oversee mergers and acquisitions globally.  The lender also said that Ros Stephenson will become
chairman of banking worldwide, according to a memo yesterday to
employees from Tom King and Eric Bommensath, the co-chief
executive officers of the corporate and investment bank.  Kerrie Cohen , a spokeswoman for the London-based company, confirmed the
contents of the memo.  Barclays last year combined investment-banking units that
oversaw corporate-clients coverage and M&A advice to win a
bigger role in deals. King and Stephenson, both 52-year-old
former co-heads of corporate finance, became co-leaders of the
new division alongside Parker, 50, who previously ran M&A.  “These changes reinvigorate and further strengthen our
approach, while allowing Tom to focus more broadly on his wider
responsibilities as co-chief executive,” King and Bommensath
wrote in the memo.  Miller was head of the global financial sponsors and global
industrial groups at  Barclays Capital . He joined the bank in
2008 when it purchased Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s
investment-banking business, where he held a similar role.  Stephenson was head of global corporate finance and M&A in
the investment-banking division at Barclays. She previously was
co-head of corporate finance at Lehman.  Miller, Stephenson and Parker are based in New York and
report to King.  To contact the reporter on this story:
