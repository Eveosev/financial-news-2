Delhi Jal Board , the main water
supplier for  India ’s capital, plans to spend 40 billion rupees
($646 million) modernizing New Delhi’s treatment and
distribution infrastructure, Chairman Debashree Mukherjee said.  The state-run utility will invest as much as 15 percent
more in the financial year ending March 2014, or 40 billion
rupees total, in new water works and upgrades compared with the
year-earlier period, Mukherjee said today in India’s largest
city. Metropolitan New Delhi has about 22 million residents.  Delhi Jal Board, which treats 747 million gallons of water
a day, has awarded contracts to companies including Europe’s
largest water and wastewater-treatment utilities  Suez
Environnement Co. (SEV)  and  Veolia Environnement SA. (VIE)   Fifty-four percent of Delhi’s sewage is treated by Delhi
Jal Board, with the remainder released raw into the Yamuna
River, the largest tributary of the Ganges River, Press Trust of
India reported in April.  Delhi Jal Board expects more private companies to be
awarded water contracts, Mukherjee said today in New Delhi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
