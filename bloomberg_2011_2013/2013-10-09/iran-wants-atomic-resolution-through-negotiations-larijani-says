Iran wants to resolve an impasse with
Western powers over the nation’s disputed nuclear program
through talks, the speaker of its parliament said today, ahead
of a planned resumption of their dialogue.  “My feeling is that Iran wants to see a resolution to the
matter through political negotiations,”  Ali Larijani , also a
former nuclear negotiator, told reporters in Geneva. “I look at
the upcoming negotiations positively.”  Discussions between Iran and the six-nation group known as
the P5+1 are due to resume in Geneva next week, amid optimism
sparked by the election of President Hassan Rouhani and the
conciliatory tone of his trip to the U.S. last month. Rouhani
had a landmark telephone conversation with President  Barack Obama , and told the Washington Post he’s eager to resolve the
nuclear dispute within six months.  While Iran says its atomic program is solely for civilian
use, the U.S. and its allies suspect the Persian Gulf nation
wants to develop nuclear weapons. Currency and trade sanctions
imposed on  Iran  have caused its economy to shrink, with oil
exports plunging by more than half and slashing government
revenue. Rouhani came to office on a pledge revive the economy,
and a thaw in ties could help him meet that promise.  “Countries who used to think that by applying pressure and
leveling sanctions, they will be able to force Iran to change
its position have come to realize that despite all of these
impediments, Iran has persisted and today has a more advanced
access to peaceful nuclear technology,” Larijani said in
Geneva.  To contact the reporter on this story:
