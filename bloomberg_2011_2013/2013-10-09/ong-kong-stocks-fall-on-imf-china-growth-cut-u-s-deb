Hong Kong  stocks  fell after the
International Monetary Fund lowered growth forecasts for  China 
and warned that a U.S. government default could “seriously
damage” the global economy.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  slid 0.8 percent to 22,995.81 as of
9:31 a.m. in Hong Kong, with six shares declining for each that
rose. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI) , also known as the
H-share index, lost 1 percent to 10,433.86.  The IMF yesterday trimmed China’s forecast for economic
expansion to 7.6 percent this year from a 7.8 percent estimate
in July, saying growth would slow considerably without reforms
to spur consumption. Global growth will be 2.9 percent this
year, down from a projection of 3.1 percent for 2013, with the
outlook factoring in a short U.S. government shutdown and
agreement on the debt limit before the Oct. 17 deadline.  The Hang Seng Index gained 2.3 percent this year on better-than-expected China economic data and after the Federal Reserve
refrained from cutting stimulus. Hong Kong’s benchmark equity
gauge traded at 11.1 times estimated earnings yesterday,
compared with 14.9 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Futures on the S&P 500 climbed 0.2 percent after the U.S.
equity gauge lost 1.2 percent yesterday, its biggest one-day
loss since August. President  Barack Obama  said the U.S. economy
risks a “very deep recession” if Congress doesn’t raise the
$16.7 trillion debt ceiling. The country is nine days away from
reaching the borrowing cap.  Janet Yellen, the current Federal Reserve vice chairman and
a proponent of accommodative monetary policy, will be nominated
to succeed central bank chief Ben S. Bernanke, according to an
e-mail from a White House official  To contact the reporter on this story:
