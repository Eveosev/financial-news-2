Teknosa Ic ve Dis Ticaret AS  headed
for its lowest close in a week after an investor applied to sell
1.82 million shares, a move that would raise the Turkish
retailer’s equity available for trading by almost a fifth.  The unit of  Haci Omer Sabanci Holding AS (SAHOL)  fell 2.1 percent
to 11.85 liras at 2:19 p.m. in Istanbul, the lowest on a closing
basis since Oct. 1. More than 150,000 shares changed hands,
about 87 percent of the three-month daily average, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Turkey’s  Borsa Istanbul National 100 (XU100) 
index slid 0.9 percent, declining for a fourth day.  Investor Demir Sabanci has registered to sell Teknosa’s
stock, making it tradeable on the Istanbul bourse, the Central
Securities Depository said in a statement yesterday. Of the 110
million shares outstanding for the company, 10.6 million are now
available for trading on the Istanbul bourse, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “This shareholder’s action may create a short-term
underperformance,” Ender Kaynar, an analyst at Ata Invest in
Istanbul, said in a phone interview today.  Teknosa shares have surged 57 percent this year, compared
with the benchmark index’s 5.1 percent decline.  Sabanci Holding,  Turkey ’s second-biggest group of companies
that’s majority owned by the Sabanci family, owns 60.3 percent
of Teknosa, according to company filings. In addition, the
family members jointly account for a 29.7 percent stake in the
technology retailer.  Teknosa held its initial public offering in May last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
