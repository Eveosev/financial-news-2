Indian (SENSEX)  stocks dropped, led by banks
and power utilities, after the benchmark index rallied to a
three-week high and the International Monetary Fund cut the
nation’s economic growth forecast.  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC)  slid 2.4 percent, the worst performer in
the S&P BSE India Bankex index.  NTPC Ltd. (NTPC) , the nation’s largest
electricity generator, dropped 1.4 percent. Bharti Airtel Ltd.
tumbled 2 percent after the company’s retail unit called off a
partnership with Wal-Mart Stores Inc.  The S&P BSE Sensex lost 0.3 percent to 19,932.37 at 9:49
a.m. in Mumbai. The measure climbed to the highest level since
Sept. 20 yesterday after the central bank eased liquidity curbs
on lenders, rolling back emergency steps taken in July to boost
the rupee. The IMF cut its forecast for India’s 2013 economic
growth yesterday, warning that failure by U.S. policy makers to
agree on raising its debt ceiling “could seriously damage the
global economy” as President  Barack Obama  and Republican
lawmakers continued to tussle over reopening the government.  The IMF cut its growth forecast for India to 3.8 percent,
from a July prediction of 5.6 percent, and its 2014 prediction
to 5.1 percent from 6.3 percent. The fund reduced its global
outlook for this year and next as capital outflows further
weaken  emerging markets .  Global investors bought a net $130 million of domestic
stocks on Oct. 7, taking this year’s inflows to $13.8 billion,
data from the regulator show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
