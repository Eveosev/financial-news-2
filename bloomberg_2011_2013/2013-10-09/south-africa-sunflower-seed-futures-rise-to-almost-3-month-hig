South African sunflower-seed futures
rose to the highest level in almost three months in Johannesburg
trading, extending a rally in the price of the oilseed for a
sixth day.  Sunflower seed for delivery in December, the most active
contract, rose 0.3 percent to 5,375 rand ($539) a metric ton at
the end of trade on the  South Africa  Futures Exchange, the
highest since July 16.  Trading of sunflowers tracks the movement of soybeans in
the U.S., Gert van Wyk, an analyst at Klerksdorp, South Africa-based Senwes Ltd. said by phone today. The U.S. vies with  Brazil 
to be the worldâ€™s biggest producer of soybeans. The correlation
between the prices of December contracts of the seeds in
Johannesburg was 0.6 this month, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. A reading of 1 would mean they move in lockstep.  Sunflower seeds are the largest oilseed crop in South
Africa after soybeans. The nation is a net importer of oilseeds,
Van Wyk said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
