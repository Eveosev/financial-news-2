U.S. politicians are playing with
fire by risking a potential default that would have a major
impact on global markets,  Chile ’s Finance Minister Felipe Larrain said today.  A default would put at risk the credibility of the U.S. as
well as the country’s economic recovery, Larrain said in an
interview in Washington.  “Frankly speaking, I’m disappointed that politicians are
playing with fire here, are playing with the credibility of the
economy, with the sustainability of the recovery,” Larrain
said. “Some people in this country are minimizing for political
reasons the effects on financial markets of a U.S. default.”  The U.S. Congress needs to lift the government’s $16.7
trillion borrowing limit by Oct. 17 or risk a default on its
debt. International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde said on Oct. 3 that it is “mission-critical” for the
U.S. to raise its debt ceiling, warning policy makers that
failure to do so would seriously hurt the country and the world.  Janet Yellen , President  Barack Obama ’s nominee to head the
Federal Reserve, to a large extent holds similar views as  Ben S. Bernanke , the current chairman, Larrain said.  “I see her as the provider of most continuity,” he said.
“ Larry Summers  would have been different.”  While tapering by the Fed is tricky it is inevitable,
Larrain added.  “U.S. monetary authorities are in uncharted territory,
they don’t really know how to take this stimulus out,” Larrain
said. “This pace of increasing the monetary base is
unsustainable.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
