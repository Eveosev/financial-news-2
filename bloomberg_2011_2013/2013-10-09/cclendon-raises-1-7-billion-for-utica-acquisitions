Aubrey McClendon, the co-founder of
 Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK)  who was ousted in April, has raised
about $1.7 billion from private-equity firms to acquire and
develop leases in the Utica Shale of eastern  Ohio .  The Energy & Minerals Group is the lead equity investor and
 Blackstone Group LP (BX) ’s GSO Capital Partners is the lead debt
provider, Oklahoma City-based American Energy said in a
statement today. Other investment will come from First Reserve
Corp.,  BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , Magnetar Capital LLC and management of
McClendon’s American Energy Partners LP.  American Energy plans to buy and develop 110,000 acres in
the Utica and has arrangements to gather and process natural gas
on all of it, the partnership said. One rig will begin drilling
before year-end. McClendon left Chesapeake, the second-largest
U.S. gas producer, after questions were raised about his
personal borrowing from some of the company’s biggest
financiers.  Drilling in the Utica deposit, where Chesapeake is the
largest operator, has more than tripled in the past year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg Industries.  Gathering and processing on 80 percent of the acres will be
done by a joint venture of  MarkWest Energy Partners LP (MWE)  and
Energy & Minerals, according to the statement.  Jefferies Group LLC gave financial advice to American
Energy while Andrews Kurth LLP and Duane Morris LLP provided
legal advice. Baker Botts LLP represented Energy & Minerals and
Latham & Watkins LLP advised GSO and certain other lenders,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
