Canadian Trade Minister Ed Fast said
 China  should be prepared to drop trade barriers if it hopes to
join World Trade Organization talks on liberalizing cross-border
services.  Canada is among 23 WTO-member countries negotiating a so-called trade-in-services  agreement  as part of global trade talks
started in Doha, Qatar in 2001.  “We evaluate each partner as they express an interest,”
Fast said today in an interview in  Singapore , when asked about
the prospect of China joining the talks. Fast declined to
speculate about whether China would join the talks. “We’ll have
discussions with them and determine what their level of ambition
is and then make a decision collectively as a group.”  The countries negotiating the services deal “strongly
believe eliminating trade barriers in the trade of services is
highly desirable and we’re making good progress,” he said.  China told TISA participants in a letter circulated Sept.
29 that it promised to participate in the negotiations
“positively, constructively and equally” and that it looked
forward to participating in the next round of talks Nov. 4-8,
Bloomberg BNA reported this week.  Canada and China  signed  an agreement last year to protect
foreign investors. Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister  John Baird 
said last year his government would complete existing free-trade
negotiations before pursuing agreements with other countries.
Canada isn’t negotiating a free-trade deal with China.  To contact the reporters on this story:
