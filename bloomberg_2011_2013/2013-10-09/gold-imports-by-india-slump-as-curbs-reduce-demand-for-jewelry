Gold imports by  India  tumbled last
month after the world’s biggest user restricted shipments and
increased taxes to contain a record current-account deficit and
halt a plunge in the currency.  Purchases of gold and silver were worth $800 million
compared with $4.6 billion a year earlier, the Commerce Ministry
said today. Imports have declined since the government linked
shipments to re-exports in July and the trend may continue, the
Finance Ministry said on Oct. 1.  The slide in shipments will comfort Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who increased taxes on bullion three times this year to
cool demand after buying helped to widen the current-account
deficit and pushed down the rupee. The government plans to keep
imports to 800 tons in the financial year ending March 31 from
845 tons a year earlier, Economic Affairs Secretary Arvind Mayaram said on Oct. 1.  “Imports have been very negligible since the 80:20 scheme
came into place and they will remain low in October as well,”
 Prithviraj Kothari , a director at the Bombay Bullion
Association, said by phone from Mumbai. “There are supply
issues in the local market as only a couple of consignments have
been cleared by the customs so far.”  The Reserve Bank of India on July 22 made it mandatory for
importers to set aside 20 percent for re-export as jewelry,
almost halting imports by traders and banks. Shipments will be
cut to 150 tons at most in the second half from 478 tons a year
earlier because of higher tariffs and restrictions, according to
Bachhraj Bamalwa, a director with the All India Gems & Jewellery
Trade Federation.  Rupee Record  Spot gold traded in  London  plunged 26 percent in the past
year to $1,311.49 an ounce. Futures on the  Multi Commodity
Exchange of India Ltd. (MCX)  traded at 29,310 ($476) rupees per 10
grams today, 16 percent below the record 35,074 rupees reached
on Aug. 28.  The rupee tumbled to a record 68.845 against the dollar on
Aug. 28 and was at 61.8625 today. The deficit widened to $21.8
billion in April through June from $18.1 billion in the previous
quarter, the central bank said Sept. 30. The gap was a record
$87.8 billion in the year ended March 31.  The third quarter has been very difficult for the bullion
industry as it was the off-season for demand and because of the
confusion about import policy, Somasundaram P.R., managing
director of the World Gold Council in India, said yesterday.
Consumption in the last quarter will be 250 tons to 300 tons
compared with 260.3 tons a year earlier because of festivals and
a good monsoon, he said.  Consumption in India, which ships in almost all the bullion
it uses, accounted for 20 percent of global demand in 2012,
according to the council.  To contact the reporters on this story:
