Gold’s decline may drive an increase
in consolidation among companies that mine and explore for the
metal, according to the chief executive officer of  Kinross Gold
Corp. (K) , Canada’s third-largest producer.  “You may see some consolidation within the industry around
balance-sheet strength and margin and free cash flow and quality
assets that need funding,” Paul Rollinson said yesterday in a
telephone interview from  Russia , where he was visiting the
company’s new Dvoinoye mine. “You may see a gold price-driven
wave of M&A activity.”  Gold is poised for its first annual decline in 13 years
after slipping into a  bear market  in April. Producers have
responded by cutting spending plans, reducing dividends and
trying to sell less profitable assets.  Kinross doesn’t need to sell assets or make acquisitions,
Rollinson said. The Toronto-based company, which suspended
 dividend  payments in July, is focused on maintaining balance-sheet strength, operating its mines well and being disciplined
in spending, he said.  Kinross achieved commercial production at Dvoinoye in
eastern Russia this month, the company said yesterday in a
statement. Kinross expects the mine will produce 235,000 to
300,000 ounces of gold equivalent, a metric that includes silver
output, in its first three full years of production.  “It’s nice to be opening up a mine in this tough
environment,” Rollinson said in the interview. “It’s on time
and on budget even though it’s a pretty challenging, remote
location.”  Barrick Gold Corp. and Goldcorp Inc. are  Canada ’s largest
gold producers ranked by sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
