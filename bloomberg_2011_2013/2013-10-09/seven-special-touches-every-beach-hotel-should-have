I rarely go to a beach resort twice. It's my job to try out new places, after all. But last week I ended up back at the  Rosewood Mayakoba  in Mexico, a 40-minute drive from the Cancun airport. I was there for the same reason as last year: to speak at  an annual conference  held next door. Last year I was wowed enough to call the resort  my favorite tropical beach getaway , but this year I discovered several new niceties. While I've seen one or two at a resort before, I've never seen all of them in one place. These unusual touches make life so much better for guests that you've got to wonder why they're so unusual to begin with. In hopes that other hotels will copy them, I thought I'd share them with you: I also learned that every butler at the resort carries an iPad for snapping photos of little hotel details and moments—say, a gorgeous sunset, or a spoonbill spotted on the lagoon—that the hotel then posts on its Instagram page. So  here's a slide show  of photos that I myself snapped and posted to Instagram—just to give you a quick feel for some of those unusual touches I loved. More from  Condé Nast Traveler :
