Apache Corp. (APA) , the U.S. explorer that
found  Kenya ’s first offshore natural gas, will exit the East
African nation to focus on projects elsewhere.  The company plugged and abandoned the Mbawa-1 well in Block
L8 off Kenya last year after failing to find commercial volumes
of gas.  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW) ,  Origin Energy Ltd. (ORG)  and  Pancontinental 
Oil & Gas NL were Apache’s partners in the well.  Apache Chief Executive Officer Steve Farris in March said
the company began to streamline operations and review assets
after a $16 billion buying spree that began in 2010 and ended
last year.  “This move is part of the company’s overall portfolio
rebalancing program announced earlier this year,” Patrick
Cassidy, a spokesman for the Houston-based company, said by e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
