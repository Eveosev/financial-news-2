Copper declined for a third day as
the partial government shutdown in the U.S. and standoff over
the debt limit weakened the outlook for demand in the world’s
second-biggest user.  The contract for delivery in three months on the  London 
Metal Exchange fell 0.2 percent to $7,228 a metric ton at 10:01
a.m. in  Shanghai  and was headed for its lowest close since Oct.
3. The metal retreated 0.6 percent last week, the first such
drop in three weeks.  President  Barack Obama  said the partial government shutdown
and threat of default is hurting U.S. credibility around the
world, undercutting work on a trade pact with Asia-Pacific
nations and emboldening  China  in areas in which it disagrees
with the U.S.  “The deadlock damps market sentiment and investors are
disinclined to trade much now,” said Fang Junfeng, an analyst
with Shanghai CIFCO Futures Co. Fang said copper prices may
rebound later this month as the shutdown is unsustainable and
data from China may show improving demand.  Stockpiles tracked by the LME fell 1.2 percent yesterday to
517,100 tons, the lowest since March 11, daily exchange figures
showed. Codelco, the world’s biggest copper miner, plans to
invest an annual $4 billion to $5 billion in the next five years
to increase output of the metal to 2 million tons by as early as
2015 and higher than that from 2017, Chief Executive Officer
Thomas Keller said in an interview in London.  Futures for delivery in December were down 0.2 percent to
$3.287 a pound on the Comex in New York. The January contract on
the Shanghai Futures Exchange dropped 0.7 percent to 52,100  yuan 
($8,513) a ton.  On the LME, nickel dropped while zinc rose. Aluminum and
lead were little changed.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
