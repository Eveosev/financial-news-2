World Bank  President Jim Yong Kim
said today that the organization intends to help cut extreme
poverty in half within seven years.  Meeting the new interim target will be needed to reduce
global poverty to 3 percent by 2030, Kim said at a conference in
 Washington . That’s one of the bank’s dual goals, along with
boosting incomes of the poorest 40 percent.  “We don’t think that there’s any way that we can get 3
percent, unless we’re at least at 9 percent by 2020,” Kim said.  The Washington-based lender defines extreme poverty as
those who live on less than $1.25 a day and says more than 1
billion people currently do.  The global  poverty rate  is now about 18 percent, according
to Kim. He said that  developing countries  will have to perform
at their highest growth rates in recent years, not their
averages, to ease poverty in line with the World Bank’s targets.  Kim, responding to a question about the political impasse
over fiscal issues in the U.S., said it’s already poised to
lower demand for U.S. exports. He also said the World Bank would
provide direct support to member nations if the U.S. defaults
and threatens their stability.  To contact the reporter on this story:
