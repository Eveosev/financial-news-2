Barclays Plc Treasurer Benoit de Vitry will step down in December, Chief Executive Officer  Antony Jenkins  said in a memo this week.  De Vitry, 51, is leaving the London-based bank to spend
more time with his family, Jenkins said in the memo, the
contents of which were confirmed by Kerrie Cohen, a Barclays
spokeswoman in New York. Dan Hodge and Peter Freilinger will be
co-heads of treasury and report to Tushar Morzaria, according to
the memo.  The bank, the second-biggest in the U.K. by assets, started
a search for de Vitry’s replacement, said Jenkins, 52. Reuters
reported on de Vitry’s departure earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
