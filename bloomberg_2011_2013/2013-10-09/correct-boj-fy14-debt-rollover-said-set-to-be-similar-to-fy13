 (Corrects currency conversion) Bank
of  Japan ’s direct debt purchases from government may be capped
in next financial year at about current level, bucking some
forecasts for increase of as much as 18 trillion yen ($185
billion).
* Direct purchases of one-year bills won’t jump significantly
from this year’s 11.7 trillion yen, according to government
officials familiar with the matter who asked not to be named,
citing policy. That assessment was echoed by people familiar
with central bank discussions who asked not to be named because
their talks were private.
* A big increase in the BOJ’s direct purchases of Japanese
 government bonds , which are made by rolling over maturing debt
into short-term bills, could fuel speculation that the central
bank is financing government spending, the people familiar and
the officials said. Royal Bank of Scotland Plc had estimated a
rollover of about 25 trillion yen in the year starting in April,
while  Credit Agricole SA (ACA) , Meiji Yasuda Life Insurance Co. and
Mizuho Research Institute Ltd. forecast as much as 30 trillion
yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
