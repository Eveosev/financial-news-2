Soybeans declined for a second day on
speculation supplies in the U.S. and  Brazil  may expand as
favorable weather boosts crops. Wheat traded near the highest
since June as rain in  Russia  and snow in Ukraine may cut output.  Soybeans for November fell as much as 0.6 percent to
$12.8125 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and were at
$12.835 by 9:59 a.m. in  Singapore . Wheat reached $6.9975 a
bushel yesterday, the highest since June 24, and was at $6.9425.  Farmers began planting soybeans in central Brazil after
recent rains moistened soil for germination, according to a
report by Hinsdale, Illinois-based researcher Soybean & Corn
Advisor Inc. The U.S. Midwest will see dry weather that helps
advance the harvest, said T-Storm Weather LLC in Chicago. The
corn  harvest  was 12 percent complete on Sept. 29, while soybean
collection was 11 percent done, government data show.  “Forecasts for favorable harvest weather in the U.S. and
beneficial planting rains in South America weighed on CBOT
soybean prices,”  Luke Mathews , a commodity strategist at
Commonwealth Bank of  Australia , wrote in a note today.  Brazil’s coming oilseed crop was 32 percent sold in
advance, compared with 45 percent a year ago, said forecaster
Safras & Mercado. Corn for December was little changed at $4.415
a bushel after retreating as much as 2.1 percent yesterday, the
biggest intraday decline since Sept. 30.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s scheduled update of
global supply and demand forecasts on Oct. 11 will be delayed by
the government’s partial shutdown that began Oct. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
