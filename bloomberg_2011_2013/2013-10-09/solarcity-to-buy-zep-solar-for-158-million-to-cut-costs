SolarCity Corp. (SCTY) , the rooftop-solar
power provider that’s quadrupled in value since its December
initial public offering, agreed to buy closely held Zep Solar
Inc. for about $158 million in stock to ensure supplies of
racking systems that cut installation times in half.  Zep is one of the company’s largest suppliers of rooftop
mounting equipment and holds patents for designs that help lower
installation costs,  San Mateo , California-based SolarCity said
today in a statement.  It’s the second acquisition for SolarCity Chief Executive
Officer  Lyndon Rive  since the company raised $92 million in its
IPO. The company purchased in September the direct marketing
provider Paramount Energy Solutions for about $120 million in
cash and stock. Zep’s racking systems will help installers
complete jobs faster, according to Rive.  “Without Zep it would take us two to three days to install
a typical rooftop,” Rive said in an interview. “With it we’re
down to a single day and it looks better on the roof.”  The two acquisitions will help reduce costs of rooftop
solar systems and meet Rive’s goal of reaching 1 million
customers, or 6,000 megawatts installed, in five years.  Zep will honor its existing supply contracts with other
solar installers, and after that SolarCity expects to utilize
most of the company’s output, Rive said.  SolarCity also plans to expand sales and marketing of Zep
systems in Japan, Australia and  Europe , Rive said. He expects to
close the transaction in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
