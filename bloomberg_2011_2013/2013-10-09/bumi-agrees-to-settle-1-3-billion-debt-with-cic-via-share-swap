PT Bumi Resources (BUMI)  agreed to settle a
$1.3 billion debt with China Investment Corp. by swapping part
of it for stakes in units of  Indonesia ’s largest thermal coal
producer and extending the maturity of other principle owed.  Bumi will exchange part of the borrowings for 42 percent of
its stake in PT Bumi Resources Minerals and 19 percent of its
holdings in PT Kaltim Prima Coal, PT Indocoal Resources and PT
Indocoal Kaltim Resources, as well as $150 million of new shares
in Bumi, the company said today in an e-mailed statement.  The rest of the debt will convert into a three-year loan at
a “competitive market rate,” it said in the statement without
saying what proportion of the borrowings would be extended. The
company will seek approvals needed to close the deal this year.  Bumi posted a first-half net loss of $290.9 million after
paying $299.2 million in interest and financial costs. That was
on top of a net loss of $346.2 million a year earlier.  Indonesia’s Bakrie family has been battling with financier
Nathaniel Rothschild for control  Bumi Plc (BUMI) , which owns stakes in
Indonesian coal mines. In July, the London-listed company agreed
to sell its 29.2 percent in Bumi Resources to the Bakrie Group.  To contact the reporters on this story:
