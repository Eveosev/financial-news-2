Cotton reserve purchases in  China 
have slowed as the government raises quality requirements and
withholds a portion of payments until the fiber passes
inspection, according to textiles research firm Sinotex.cn.  China National Cotton Reserves Corp.  bought 100,630 metric
tons of new-crop local cotton as of Sept. 30, down 74 percent
from a year earlier, according to estimates by Qingdao-based
Sinotex.cn. Purchases from Xinjiang province, the top-producing
region, fell 76 percent to 71,400 tons, according a report dated
Oct. 4 and released during a week-long holiday in China.  Farmers had sold just 3.4 percent of their crop while the
harvest was 21.6 percent complete as of Sept. 15, Sinotex said.
Two calls today to the reserves corporation seeking comment
weren’t answered.  “Some cotton companies have slowed down purchases from
farmers or stopped altogether because they’re struggling to meet
the new standards,” Sinotex said.  The government started this season’s stockpiling program on
Sept. 9, buying cotton from companies when market prices stayed
below 20,400  yuan  for five straight days. Qualified companies
buy from farmers first, then sell the cotton to the government
through a trading platform.  Cotton futures for January delivery on Zhengzhou Commodity
Exchange were little changed at 19,930 yuan a metric ton ($1.48
a pound) at 11:29 a.m. local time. The contract is currently the
most active and has closed below 20,400 yuan a ton since
inception at the start of year.  Prices on the Chinese bourse compares with 83.70 cents a
pound on ICE in  New York , where futures have advanced 11 percent
this year on concern that global output is dropping.  The government this year will withhold 500 yuan a ton of
payment for cotton until the fiber and the packaging is judged
to have met quality standards, according to a statement on Sept.
9 by the China National Development and Reform Commission.  The fiber will be judged by color, length, strength and
purity, according to Sinotex.cn.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
