The Treasury’s $21 billion sale of
10-year notes may draw a  yield  of 2.67 percent, according to the
average forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of seven of the
 Federal Reserve ’s 21 primary dealers.  The securities, which mature in August 2023, yielded 2.67
percent in pre-auction trading. Bids are due by 1 p.m.  New York 
time. The yield at the 10-year debt offering on Sept. 11 was
2.946 percent, the highest since June, 2011. The record-low
auction yield was 1.459 percent in July 2012.  The  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges demand by comparing
the amount bid with the amount offered, was 2.86 at last month’s
sale, versus an average of 2.76 at the past 10 auctions.  Indirect bidders , a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 36.6 percent of the notes at the
September sale, versus 46.3 percent in August. The average at
the past 10 offerings was 37.3 percent.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 29.6 percent of
the securities at last month’s sale. The average for the past 10
auctions is 23.1 percent.  Ten-year notes have lost 5.6 percent this year, compared
with a 2.5 percent drop in the broader U.S. Treasuries market,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The
benchmark notes returned 4.2 percent in 2012, versus a 2.2
percent gain by Treasuries overall.  The auction is the second of three offerings this week as
the government sells $64 billion of notes and bonds. The U.S.
sold $30 billion of three-year debt yesterday at a yield of 0.71
percent and will auction $13 billion of 30-year bonds tomorrow.  The sales will raise $31.7 billion of new cash, as maturing
securities held by the public total $32.3 billion, according to
the  U.S. Treasury .  Primary dealers trade  government securities  with the Fed
and are obliged to participate in Treasury sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
