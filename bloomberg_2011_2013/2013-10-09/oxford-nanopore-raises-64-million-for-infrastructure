Oxford Nanopore Technologies Ltd .,
the U.K. company working to develop a portable gene-sequencer,
raised 40 million pounds ($64 million) from new and existing
investors in the U.S. and Europe.  The money will be used to build the company’s sales and
manufacturing capacity, research and development and for other
business purposes including protecting intellectual property,
the closely held Oxford, England-based company said today in a
statement.  The new shareholders include Odey Asset Management LLP, the
London-based hedge fund founded by  Crispin Odey , Oxford Nanopore
said. The company’s existing shareholders previously invested
105 million pounds and include  IP Group Plc (IPO) ,  Illumina Inc. (ILMN) ,
Invesco Perpetual and Lansdowne Partners. Oxford Nanopore also
has individual shareholders, including company managers, and
employees have  stock options .  Chief Executive Officer Gordon Sanghera said early last
year the company expected to begin selling its products by the
end of 2012. The company has since faced technical delays as it
has had to redesign a sensor that wasn’t performing
satisfactorily.  Oxford Nanopore is developing handheld and desktop devices
that use a novel technique known as strand sequencing, in which
an entire string of DNA is guided by an enzyme and passes intact
through a tiny hole in a cell membrane one-billionth of a meter
wide.  The company was spun out of Oxford University in 2005 and
its technology was initially based on research by  Hagan Bayley ,
a professor of chemical biology at the university. Numis
Securities analyst Charles Weston estimated the company’s value
at $1.5 billion in a Feb. 20 note to clients.
