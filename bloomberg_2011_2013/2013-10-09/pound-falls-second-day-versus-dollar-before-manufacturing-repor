The pound slumped to a three-week low
against the dollar after a government report showed industrial
production declined in August, casting doubt on the strength of
the economy in the third quarter.  The U.K. currency weakened at least 0.2 percent versus all
of its 16 major counterparts as separate data showed the goods-trade deficit improved less than economists forecast. U.K.
government bonds rose for a third day. Economists predict the
Bank of England will keep its benchmark interest rate at a
record low when it announces its policy decision tomorrow.  “There’s a sense of disappointment in today’s data, which
has weighed on the pound,” said Lee Hardman, a currency
strategist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in  London . “The
pace of economic recovery in the U.K. may prove slightly less
robust than anticipated.”  The pound fell 0.9 percent to $1.5942 at 4:36 p.m. London
time after dropping to $1.5920, the lowest since Sept. 18. The
U.K. currency slipped 0.5 percent to 84.80 pence per euro after
depreciating to 84.87, the weakest level since Sept. 3.  Sterling declined 1.4 percent in the past week, the worst
performer among 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar rose 0.6
percent and the euro gained 0.1 percent.  Output Slides  Industrial output dropped 1.1 percent from July, when it
increased 0.1 percent, the Office for National Statistics said.
The goods-trade deficit narrowed to 9.63 billion pounds in
August from a revised 9.94 billion pounds, the office said in a
separate report. Economists in a Bloomberg survey predicted the
deficit would shrink to 8.85 billion pounds.  Citigroup Inc.’s Economic Surprise Index for the U.K.
dropped to 28.1, the lowest since July 16. The gauge, which
shows whether data beat or fell short of economists’ forecasts,
climbed to a nine-month high of 113.30 on Aug. 19.  The pound is reversing gains that saw it jump 4.4 percent
versus the dollar in September as improving economic data
prompted investors to increase bets the Bank of England would
raise borrowing costs earlier than it predicted.  “The pound is being driven lower by the weak data,” said
Lee McDarby, executive director of U.K. corporate foreign-exchange sales at Nomura International Plc in London. This “is
in stark contrast to the strong U.K. figures we saw during
the summer.”  Finding Base  Sterling is likely to find a base around $1.59 to $1.5950
and the current level offers an opportunity to enter a bet the
currency will strengthen, according to Credit Agricole SA.  As long as the currency holds above $1.59 that means it
isn’t entering a new downtrend, said  Manuel Oliveri , a foreign-exchange strategist in London. The industrial production data
was not a “game changer,” he said.  The yield on the benchmark 10-year gilt fell one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 2.68 percent after dropping
to 2.65 percent, the lowest level since Aug. 27. The 2.25
percent bond due September 2023 rose 0.115, or 1.15 pounds per
1,000-pound face amount, to 96.26.  Gilts handed investors a loss of 2.7 percent this year
through yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes.
German bonds dropped 1.8 percent and U.S. Treasuries declined
2.5 percent.  The Bank of England will leave its  key interest rate  at 0.5
percent and its bond-purchase target as 375 billion pounds,
according to two surveys of economists. The central bank, which
will announce the decisions at noon, has said it will keep the
benchmark rate unchanged until  unemployment , currently at 7.7
percent, falls below 7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
