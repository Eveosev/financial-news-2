Saudi Arabia , the biggest oil
producer, approved $132 million of water and sanitation projects
across the kingdom, state-owned  Saudi Press Agency  said, citing
Minister of Water and Electricity Abdullah Al-Hussayen.  Twenty-two projects given the green light include water-treatment plants, pumping stations, reservoirs and the continued
buildout of water and sewage networks throughout the Arab
world’s largest economy, SPA said.  The projects that include works in Hafr al-Baten, Najran,
Buraidah and Jazan are part of  King Abdullah ’s orders “to
provide all the necessary services to every citizen” as demand
for water increases, according to the report. Saudi Arabia is
already the biggest desalinated water producer, serving the
 energy industry  and a population that’s quadrupled in 40 years.  In January, Al-Hussayen said $6.4 billion had been
allocated for water and sanitation projects in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
