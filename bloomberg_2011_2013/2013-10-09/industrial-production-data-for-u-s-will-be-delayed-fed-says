The September data on U.S. industrial
production will be indefinitely delayed because of the partial
government shutdown, the Federal Reserve announced today.  The report, originally scheduled to be released on Oct. 17,
will be postponed indefinitely. The central bank said it will
issue a new publication date once the government reopens.  To contact the reporter on this story:
