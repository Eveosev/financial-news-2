Principal Financial Group Inc. (PFG) 
shifted $390 million in loans from its bank unit as U.S.
regulators increase oversight.  Principal moved $350 million of commercial real estate debt
to another part of the Des Moines, Iowa-based company, Sonja
Sorrel, a spokeswoman, said in an e-mail today. About $40
million in loans were sold to external buyers, she said.  Principal, which offers investment products and life
insurance, is seeking to deregister as a savings and loan
holding company amid greater U.S. scrutiny of such firms under
the Dodd-Frank Act. Insurers including  MetLife Inc. (MET) ,  American
International Group Inc. (AIG)  and Allstate Corp. have sold deposits
or retreated from banking.  “Principal Bank remains on track to complete
deregistration by year-end,” Sorrel said. “As part of this
process, Principal Bank recently divested the bank’s commercial
and commercial real estate loans.”  Principal said in June it reached a deal to sell $200
million of deposits from the bank unit. The loan sales were in
August and September, Sorrel said.  The insurer has said its bank will operate as a limited
purpose trust institution after the sales are completed. The
unit will continue offering individual retirement accounts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
