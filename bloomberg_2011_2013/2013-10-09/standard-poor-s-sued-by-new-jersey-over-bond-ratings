Standard & Poor’s  Financial Services
LLC and its parent,  McGraw Hill Financial Inc. (MHFI) , were sued by New
Jersey for allegedly failing to give objective ratings to
mortgage-backed securities, the state’s attorney general said.  Standard & Poor’s harmed New Jersey consumers with claims
that its ratings of the securities were independent when they
were in fact driven by the company’s sales goals, the attorney
general said today in a statement. The filing couldn’t
immediately be confirmed in court records.  “Standard & Poor’s was not providing independent investor
information, but instead acting in its own business interests,
and in the interests of favored clients whose fees provided the
company with a significant revenue stream,” Acting Attorney
General John J. Hoffman said.  The deceptive ratings for mortgage-backed securities and
other structured financial products were assigned from at least
2001 to 2008, according to a copy of the complaint posted on the
attorney general’s website.  Edward Sweeney , a spokesman for New York-based Standard &
Poor’s, didn’t immediately return a call seeking comment on the
lawsuit.  The case is Hoffman v. McGraw Hill Financial Inc.,
Superior Court of New Jersey,  Chancery Division  (Newark, New
Jersey).  To contact the reporter on this story:
