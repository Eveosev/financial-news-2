Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  hired Armando Armenta as a Latin America economist covering Colombia, Peru and
Venezuela, according to a person with direct knowledge of the
matter.  Armenta started in September at the bank’s New York office
and reports to Gustavo Canonero, the chief economist for Latin
America, said the person, who asked not to be identified because
he wasn’t authorized to comment publicly about personnel moves.
Oksana Poltavets, a spokeswoman for the Frankfurt-based bank,
declined to comment.  Armenta had worked as an economic research analyst at
Atlanta-based  Invesco Ltd. (IVZ)  since 2012 after receiving a doctoral
degree in economics from the University of  Maryland  at College
Park. He declined to comment when reached by telephone.  Deutsche Bank also hired Alexis Milo, a former board member
of Mexico’s Federal Telecommunications Commission, to cover
Latin America’s second-biggest economy from Mexico City. Milo
and Armenta will take over the duties of Fernando Losada, who
left the bank to join AllianceBernstein LP in May, according to
the person.  Departures from Deutsche Bank’s emerging-markets team over
the past three months include Mauro Roca, a senior Latin America
economist who joined Goldman Sachs Group Inc., and Natalia Corfield, a corporate credit analyst, who was hired by JPMorgan
Chase & Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
