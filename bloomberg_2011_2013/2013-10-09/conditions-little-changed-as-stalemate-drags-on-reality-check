Financial conditions in the U.S.
improved as possible paths emerged to raising the nation’s debt
ceiling and ending a partial government shutdown that stretched
into nine days.  The  Bloomberg U.S. Financial Conditions Index (BFCIUS)  rose 0.07 to
1.22, the highest level this week, after decreasing 0.03
yesterday. The gauge measures stress in the markets by combining
everything from money-market rates to yields on government and
corporate bonds to volatility in equities. During the debt-ceiling debate of August 2011, the index fell to as low as
negative 1.631.  House Republican and Senate Democratic leaders are open to
a short-term increase in the debt limit, said congressional
aides of both parties who spoke on condition of anonymity to
discuss strategy. The steps mark the first movement toward
averting a U.S. default. President Barack Obama opened the door
to talks with Republicans on topics from health care to
entitlement programs if they end the debt-limit impasse, and
 House Republicans  will send a small group of negotiators to the
White House tomorrow.  “The shutdown, as well as the wrangling over the debt
ceiling, are both causing unnecessary harm to our economy,”
Alan Krueger, a labor economist at  Princeton University  who
served as chairman of President  Barack Obama ’s  Council of
Economic Advisers , said in an interview today on Bloomberg
Television. “It would be better if cooler heads prevailed.”  Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said over the weekend that
Congress must boost the $16.7 trillion debt ceiling by Oct. 17
or the U.S. risks defaulting on its payments.  Treasuries  Rates surged for a second day on Treasury bills maturing on
the debt-ceiling deadline. Rates on Treasury bills due on Oct.
17 climbed 20 basis points to 0.48 percent after jumping 14
basis points yesterday. They were negative as recently as Sept.
26. The securities are yielding more than the 0.177 percent
yield on the one-month London interbank offered  rate .  The yield on the benchmark 10-year  U.S. Treasury  note
increased three basis points to 2.66 percent, according to
Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. That’s down from the high this
year of 3 percent on Sept. 6 and compares with the average of
3.53 percent during the past decade.  Rate Derivatives  The U.S. two-year interest-rate swap spread, a measure of
debt-market stress, rose 0.75 basis point to 12.63 basis points.
The gauge typically widens when investors seek the perceived
safety of  government securities  and narrows when they favor
assets such as corporate bonds. The measure has dropped from
this year’s high of 19.55 on June 21.  Credit  A gauge of U.S. company credit risk fell. The Markit CDX
North American Investment Grade Index, a credit-default swaps
benchmark that investors use to hedge against losses or to
speculate on creditworthiness, dropped 1.1 basis points to a
mid-price of 83.4 basis points, according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg. The index, which typically climbs as investor
confidence in credit deteriorates and falls as it improves, has
averaged 81.8 this year.  Currencies  The Bloomberg U.S.  Dollar Index , which tracks the greenback
against 10 major currencies, rose 0.3 percent to 1,013.22. The
index has traded in a range of 1,007.9 and 1,053.48 the past
three months. The greenback gained 0.04 percent to 97.38 yen.  Stocks  The  Standard & Poor’s 500  rose 0.1 percent to 1,656.40. The
 Dow Jones Industrial Average  gained 0.2 percent to 14,802.98.  Volatility  The  CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) , or VIX, fell 3.64 percent to
19.6 after approaching its closing high for the year of 20.49 in
June. That compares with a low of 11.3 in March. Volatility in
Treasuries as measured by the Bank of America Merrill Lynch MOVE
index fell to 80.8 today, compared with the average this year is
72.4.  Currency swings as measured by the JPMorgan Global
Volatility Index rose to 8.84 versus a 2013 average of 9.37.  Energy, Commodities  West Texas Intermediate crude oil for November delivery
fell $1.88 to $101.61 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  Gold futures for December delivery fell 1.3 percent to
$1,306.90 an ounce on the Comex in  New York . Prices dropped 2.1
percent last week amid speculation that the Federal shutdown
that has furloughed 800,000 workers would be short-lived.  To contact the reporter on this story:
