Vedanta Resources Plc (VED) , the India-focused metals and oil producer, fell the most in seven weeks in
 London  trading after saying copper output in Zambia declined and
iron-ore mining in Karnataka state remains halted.  Vedanta dropped as much as 5.3 percent to 1,013 pence, the
biggest slump since Aug. 20, and was at 1,023 pence by 10:21
a.m. Copper production at Vedanta’s unit in Zambia fell 26
percent to 34,000 tons in the fiscal second quarter because of a
suspension of mining operations, it said in a statement today.  While a court lifted restrictions on Vedanta’s mining in
Karnataka, the company still needs “final statutory
clearances” to restart operations “shortly,” it said. Court
hearings have resumed on a ban on Vedanta’s mining in Goa.
Vedanta lowered its forecast for Zambian copper output to
140,000 tons this fiscal year because of a slower ramp up at its
Konkola unit. It maintained the production cost at 230 cents a
pound.  The forecast cut “will result in small downgrades to our
estimates,” Ben Davis, an analyst at Liberum Capital Ltd. in
London, said in a note to investors. “The timeframe for
possible lifting of the iron-ore ban remains inexplicit, typical
for Indian bureaucracy.”  In oil and gas, Vedanta increased its so-called average
gross operated production to a record 213,299 barrels a day in
the three months ended Sept. 30 from 207,245 a year earlier, it
said.  Vedanta was primarily a mine operator before it completed
in 2011 the purchase of a controlling stake in oil and gas
explorer  Cairn India Ltd. (CAIR)  for $8.67 billion, giving it access to
 India ’s biggest onshore oilfield.  Refined zinc output fell to 106,000 tons from 114,000 tons,
while aluminum production rose 2 percent to 200,000 tons,
Vedanta said. Alumina production slumped 43 percent to 116,000
tons after disruptions at the Lanjigarh refinery.  To contact the reporter on this story:
