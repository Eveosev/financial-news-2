Hartford Financial Services Group
Inc. (HIG) , the insurer focusing on property-casualty coverage, rose
as Reuters reported that Apollo Global Management LLC and J.C.
Flowers & Co. may bid for unit that sold annuities in  Japan .  Hartford climbed 4.5 percent to $32.06 at 3:24 p.m. in New
York. The insurer has rallied about 43 percent this year.  The insurer stopped selling annuities in Japan and the U.S.
to reduce the risk of interest rate fluctuations and stock
market declines. Hartford, based in the Connecticut city of the
same name, struck a deal in June with Berkshire Hathaway Inc.,
to limit annuity risk. Berkshire agreed to take on liabilities
from U.K. annuity contracts that Hartford sold in prior years.  “We do view transactions as a powerful tool to accelerate
the runoff of the annuity block,” Tom Hambrick, a spokesman for
the insurer, said in an e-mail. “Any transactions would be
evaluated by balancing the sales price and underlying economics
with the capital that would be released.” He declined to
comment on Apollo or Flowers.  Carolyn Sargent, a spokeswoman for Apollo at Rubenstein
Associates, had no immediate comment. A message left with
Flowers wasn’t immediately returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
