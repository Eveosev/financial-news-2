Austria ’s President Heinz Fischer
asked Chancellor Werner Faymann to form a new government and
supported a continuation of the so-called “grand coalition”
that has governed the Alpine republic since 2007.  Faymann’s Social Democrats remained the strongest party in
Austria’s Sept. 29 national elections. Vice Chancellor Michael Spindelegger’s conservative People’s Party finished second. Both
parties fell to their worst result since World War II as voters
strengthened the anti-euro Freedom Party and elected two protest
movements to the parliament.  “The strongest and the second-strongest parties have a
stable majority of seats,” Fischer told journalists at Vienna’s
former imperial palace, adding that he’d like successful
negotiations between Faymann and Spindelegger to form a new
government.  Faymann reiterated he seeks to start negotiations with the
People’s Party, ruling out a coalition with Heinz-Christian Strache’s Freedom Party. “We don’t need experiments with
unreliable partners,” Faymann said.  Conservatives have kept a possible pact with the euro-skeptics in play. A deal would need support from a party formed
by Austrian-Canadian billionaire Frank Stronach. The party will
decide Oct. 14 on who to start negotiations with.  To contact the reporter on this story:
