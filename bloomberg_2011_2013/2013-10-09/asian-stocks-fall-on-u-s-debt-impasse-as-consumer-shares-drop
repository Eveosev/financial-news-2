Asian  stocks  outside Japan fell on
concern the impasse over the U.S. debt limit may lead to a
default and after the International Monetary Fund cut its global
outlook. Japan’s Topix index posted its biggest gain in almost
three weeks after the yen weakened.  Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. fell 3.4 percent in Hong
Kong after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sold the carmaker’s shares
at a discount, according to a term sheet obtained by Bloomberg.
WorleyParsons Ltd. lost 2.9 percent in Sydney after the mining-services provider said it expects 2014 fiscal first-half
earnings to decline.  SoftBank Corp. (9984)  slumped 5.7 percent after
Citigroup Inc. cut the Japanese mobile carrier’s equity rating.
Toyota Motor Corp., Asia’s biggest auto manufacturer, gained 3
percent in Tokyo after falling as much as 0.7 percent.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific ex-Japan Index  slipped 0.2 percent to
466.21 at 9:39 p.m. in Tokyo, while the broader regional gauge
rose 0.3 percent to 138.92. The Topix climbed 1.5 percent, its
biggest gain since Sept. 19. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
fell 1.2 percent yesterday after President  Barack Obama  said the
U.S. economy risks a “very deep recession” should Congress not
raise the $16.7 trillion borrowing limit.  “Markets don’t like indecision and bickering by the
government,” said  Angus Gluskie , managing director at White
Funds Management in Sydney who oversees about $550 million.
“Political parties are prepared to use these agreements as a
bargaining chip. You certainly see a point of nervousness and
concern for investors.”  Regional Indexes  New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index fell 0.6 percent, while
 Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index added 0.1 percent. Hong Kong’s
 Hang Seng Index (HSI)  fell 0.6 percent.  Singapore ’s Straits Times
Index gained 0.3 percent, and  Taiwan ’s Taiex index dropped 0.4
percent. The Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.6 percent. South
Korea’s markets were closed today for a holiday.  The International Monetary Fund cut its global outlook for
this year and next as capital outflows further weaken  emerging
markets , and warned that a U.S. government default could
“seriously damage” the world economy. Growth worldwide will be
2.9 percent this year and 3.6 percent next year, the IMF said,
compared with July predictions of 3.1 percent for 2013 and 3.8
percent for next year.  Geely Drops  Geely dropped 3.4 percent to HK$4.26. A unit of Goldman
Sachs raised $309 million selling 578 million shares of the
carmaker at HK$4.15 each, a 5.9 percent discount to yesterday’s
close.  Japanese exporters jumped as the yen fell against most of
its 16 major counterparts. A weaker yen enhances the value of
overseas earnings at Japanese companies. Toyota gained 3 percent
to 6,230 yen. Komatsu Ltd., a maker of construction machinery
that gets 30 percent of its sales in the Americas, added 2.4
percent to 2,316 yen.  Mizuho Financial Group Inc.,  Japan ’s third-largest bank by
market value, dropped 1 percent to 204 yen after saying a former
top executive knew it was lending to crime groups three years
ago. The bank had earlier said that only compliance officials
were aware of the transgression.  WorleyParsons lost 2.9 percent to A$22.10, reversing
earlier gains of 2.2 percent, after saying earnings in fiscal
2014 will be more heavily weighted to the second half than in
recent years.  SoftBank dropped 5.7 percent to 7,000 yen after its rating
was cut to neutral from buy at Citigroup. Market expectations
may be too high for the company’s acquisition of Sprint Corp.,
analyst Hideki Takoh wrote in a report dated yesterday.  Futures on the S&P 500 gained 0.2 percent as the White
House prepared to nominate Janet Yellen to succeed Ben S.
Bernanke as chairman of the Federal Reserve. Yellen, vice
chairman of the central bank since 2010, has articulated the
case for maintaining accommodative monetary policy.  “Generally people feel Yellen will take a line that’s not
dissimilar from Bernanke, which will be reasonably dovish and
accordingly supportive for markets,” Gluskie at White Funds
Management said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
