Saudi Arabia  policy is moving away
from trying to grow wheat locally to importing more food as the
energy costs for irrigation and water exceed import prices, a
Saudi official said today at a conference in Budapest.  An arid climate, desert soil, the high price of water for
irrigating crops and energy expenses to produce local food all
combine to prompt the switch, Deputy Minister for Water Affairs
Mohammed Ibrahim al-Saud said at the Budapest Water Summit.  Almost 70 percent of Saudi Arabia’s domestic water usage
amid a rise in population comes from desalination and the
balance from limited groundwater supplies, he said.  In many Middle Eastern countries, the “food sector has no
realizations of what energy is embedded in production,” the
official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
