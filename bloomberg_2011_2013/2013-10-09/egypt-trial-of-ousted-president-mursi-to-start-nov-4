The trial of  Egypt ’s former President
Mohamed Mursi for allegedly inciting killings outside his palace
before he was ousted will start on Nov. 4, Judge Nabil Salib
said in a statement.  Mursi hasn’t been seen in almost 100 days, since the army
ousted him on July 3 after days of protests demanding his
removal. Today’s decision may fuel tensions ahead of planned
rallies by his supporters in Tahrir Square on Friday. At least
55 people were killed when similar rallies erupted into clashes
with security forces earlier this month.  Some of Mursi’s former aides and members of the
Brotherhood’s Freedom and Justice Party, including Essam el-Erian and Mohamed El-Beltagy, also face charges.  Brotherhood supporters say the group is the victim of a
politically motivated crackdown that includes arrests and asset-freezes.  To contact the reporters on this story:
