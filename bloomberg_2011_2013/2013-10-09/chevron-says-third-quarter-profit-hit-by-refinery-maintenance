Chevron Corp. (CVX) , the world’s third-largest energy producer by market value, said quarterly profit
was lower than the prior three-month period amid refinery
repairs and foreign-exchange losses.  Downstream earnings, which includes refining and retail
operations, are expected to be “significantly lower” than the
second quarter, the  San Ramon , California-based company said in
a statement today. The third quarter also includes almost $300
million in foreign-exchange losses, compared with the prior
quarter that included a similar sized gain, the company said.  Chevron’s wells produced the equivalent of 2.589 million
barrels of oil a day in July and August, compared with 2.516
million a day during the full third quarter of 2012. Increased
fuel production at its Richmond, California, refinery was mostly
offset by maintenance work at its El Segundo, California, plant,
Chevron said.  The company is scheduled to release complete third-quarter
results on Nov. 1. The shares fell 1.3 percent to $114.63 at
5:08 p.m. in after-hours trading in  New York .  Exxon Mobil Corp. is the largest energy company by market
value, followed by PetroChina Co., according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
