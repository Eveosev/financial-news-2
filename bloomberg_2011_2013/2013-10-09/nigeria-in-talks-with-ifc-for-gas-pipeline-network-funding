Nigeria,  Africa ’s top oil producer,
is in talks with the International Finance Corporation to help
fund a national gas-pipeline network to supply power stations
and industries.  “We asked for a mixed basket of debt and equity
financing,” Petroleum Minister Diezani Alison-Madueke said
today in the capital, Abuja. “Over the next six months, once
the front-end issues are sorted out, mobilization and
implementation of the financial support and the work, as well as
project advisorial and project support, will begin.”  Nigeria, the holder of Africa’s largest gas reserves of
more than 187 trillion cubic feet, flares, or burns, most of the
fuel it produces along with oil because it lacks the
infrastructure to process it. At least $3 billion in revenue is
lost annually due to flaring, according to the Petroleum
Ministry.  The IFC is interested in financing the 40-inch, 683-kilometer (424-mile) Ajaokuta-Kaduna-Kano northern link, the
primary network for the proposed trans-Saharan pipeline to
Europe, Alison-Madueke said.  State-owned Nigeria National Petroleum Corp. in July sought
expressions of interest in “co-development” of the country’s
northern and eastern natural gas pipeline system. The NNPC said
it would prefer a funding structure of 60 percent debt and 40
percent equity for the project estimated to cost $5 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
