Walt Disney Co. (DIS) , the world’s biggest
entertainment company, said it will close its Pixar animation
studio in  Vancouver  to focus the business at its main site in
Emeryville, California.  “As we look at the creative and business needs of our
studio, we’ve made the decision to refocus our efforts and
resources under one roof in Emeryville,” the Burbank,
California-based company said in an e-mailed statement, which
didn’t disclose how many jobs would be lost as a result.  Disney was attracted to Vancouver by tax incentives and the
shuttering of the operation follows a reduction of those
benefits by British Columbia, Variety reported, saying the move
will result in 100 job losses. Pixar, which Disney bought in
2006, employs about 1,200 staff according to a March 2011
posting on Pixar’s website.  Shares of Disney slipped less than 1 percent to $64 at the
close in New York to give the stock a gain of 29 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
