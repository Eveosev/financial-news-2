The  Democratic Republic  of Congo is
open to more investors joining three groups of companies bidding
to construct the $12 billion Inga 3 hydropower project, Energy
Minister Bruno Kapandji said.  “We’re open to other operators” joining the bid groups,
Kapandji told the iPad mining and infrastructure conference
yesterday in the capital, Kinshasa. “The candidates are not
closed.”  Congo will choose a development group for the 4,800-megawatt project in June or July of next year, Max Munga,
Kapandji’s technical adviser, told the conference. The bid
groups are currently made up of China Three Gorges Corp. and
Sinohydro Corp.;  Posco (005490)  and  Daewoo Corp. (047050)  of South Korea in
partnership with Canada’s  SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. (SNC) ; and
 Actividades de Construccion y Servicios SA , based in  Madrid , and
 Spain ’s Eurofinsa Group.  Construction on the Congo River may begin in October 2015
and power generation could start in 2020. Congo is set to sign a
treaty this month that will guarantee 2,500 megawatts from the
project for South Africa.  Inga 3 will be the first step in the Grand Inga project,
which may eventually produce more than 40,000 megawatts of
electricity, making it the largest source of hydropower in the
world. About 170 square kilometers (66 square miles) around the
Congo River will be flooded to create a total of 8 Inga
hydropower plants, Munga said.  Inga 1, built in 1972, and Inga 2, completed in 1982, have
the capacity to produce about 1,775 megawatts, though they are
being refurbished and operating below capacity.  Earth’s Circumference  For Inga 3, Congo will construct 1,841 kilometers of high-tension lines to its border with Zambia, Munga said.  South
Africa  will install 1,540 kilometers of lines from Zambia
through Zimbabwe to Witkop, he said. The total combined distance
of the lines would stretch around the circumference of the
earth, he said.  Congo will provide 1,300 megawatts of power from Inga 3 to
miners in Katanga province, with the remaining 1,000 megawatts
for internal use outside of mining, Munga said.  Congo is the world’s eighth-largest copper producer and its
miners currently have a power deficit of more than 300
megawatts, according to Kapandji. The shortfall has forced some
mining companies to install generators or buy electricity from
Zambia to run processing plants.  The country only has about 2,400 megawatts of installed
power capacity and because of mismanagement, only about half of
that energy is available, according to the  World Bank . Only 9
percent of Congo’s 70 million people have electricity, Kapandji
said.  After the initial phase of Inga 3 construction is complete,
an increase in the level of water powering its turbines could
improve power generation by about 3,000 megawatts, Munga said,
bringing the total capacity to 7,800 megawatts. Nigeria has
shown interest in purchasing power from the next phase, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
