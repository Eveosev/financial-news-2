New York Jets linebacker Antwan Barnes will miss the rest of the season after injuring his knee
in the team’s 30-28 win over the  Atlanta Falcons  two days ago.  Barnes, who signed a free-agent contract with the National
Football League team this offseason, was placed on injured
reserve according to the team’s Twitter account.  “Just want to take the time to thank everyone who is
supporting me through this time,” Barnes, 28, said today on his
Twitter account.  Barnes is in his eighth NFL season after stints with the
Baltimore Ravens,  Philadelphia Eagles  and San Diego Chargers.
Used primarily as an outside linebacker, he has two sacks this
year and three total tackles in five games with the Jets.  Linebacker Ricky Sapp will replace Barnes on the roster.  -- Editor: Jay Beberman  To contact the reporters on this story:
