Simran Wind Project Pvt., an Indian
wind farm developer backed by the International Finance Corp.,
halted plans to expand this financial year, saying government
subsidies arrived too late.  Simran, with 207 megawatts of capacity in operation, had
planned to add as much as 150 megawatts annually.  “We have not done any projects this year,” Joy Saxena, a
director at the company, said in an interview. While the
government reinstated a wind-farm subsidy in August, that was
too late for the wind developer to find a site and build a
project by the end of fiscal year on March 31, he said.  The company expects to resume its expansion next year and
is targeting 800 megawatts by 2017, focusing on Tamil Nadu
state, he said. Simran is a unit of Kolkata-based  Techno
Electric (TEEC)  & Engineering Co. The IFC acquired 3.4 percent of
Simran in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
