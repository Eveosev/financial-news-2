Spanish  government bonds  fell for a
third day as the nation sold 4 billion euros ($5.4 billion) of a
new  30-year (GSPG10YR)  security via banks, its first offering of the
maturity since March.  Italy’s bonds also declined as the nation sold 5 billion
euros of seven-year notes through banks, with auctions for
another 6 billion euros of securities scheduled for this week.
German bunds were little changed as U.S. lawmakers remained
deadlocked over the nation’s debt ceiling.  “The increase in long-dated Spanish bond yields is linked
primarily to new 30-year supply,” said  Peter Chatwell , a fixed-income strategist at Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank
in  London . “ Spain ’s 30-year debt was already looking slightly
cheap before the supply announcement. There should be enough
demand out there for the market to take down this supply without
a problem.”  Spain’s 10-year yield increased four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 4.33 percent at 4:58 p.m. London time after
rising to 4.34 percent, the highest since Sept. 30. The 4.4
percent bond due in October 2023 fell 0.29, or 2.90 euros per
1,000-euro face amount, to 100.545.  The 30-year yield rose two basis points to 5.10 percent
after rising as much as three basis points.  The October 2044 bonds were sold to yield 250 basis points
more than the mid-swap rate.  Italian Sale  Italy’s seven-year notes being sold through banks today
have been priced to yield 10 basis points more than the nation’s
bonds maturing in March 2021. The nation is also scheduled to
auction securities maturing between 2016 and 2028 on Oct. 11.  “Italian bonds are under a bit of pressure as the market
appears to be making room for fresh supply,” said  Luca Cazzulani , a senior fixed-income strategist at  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  in
Milan. “The total amount of Italian supply to the market this
week alone would be 11 billion euros. That is not a small
amount.”  The Italian  10-year yield  climbed three basis points to
4.38 percent after rising five basis points yesterday.  U.S. President  Barack Obama  and Republican lawmakers
remained at odds over reopening the government and raising the
debt ceiling. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew has said Congress
needs to increase the borrowing ceiling by Oct. 17 or the nation
risks defaulting on its payments.  ‘Some Support’  The cost of insuring German five-year bonds against default
fell to an almost four-year low. Credit-default swaps on the
securities dropped 1.5 basis points to 23 basis points, the
lowest since December 2009. Those on similar-maturity Treasuries
rose two basis points to 40 basis points, the highest since
March.  “The fiscal impasse in  Washington  continues but we still
expect a last-minute solution at this point,” UniCredit’s
Cazzulani said. “In politics, you don’t budge until it’s clear
you have no other choice. If this problem drags on, we are
likely to see some support for German bunds.”  The 10-year bund yield was at 1.81 percent after dropping
to 1.74 percent on Sept. 30, the lowest level since Aug. 13. The
five-year yield was also little changed, at 0.83 percent.  Germany  sold 3.3 billion euros of five-year notes today at
an average yield of 0.81 percent, down from 1 percent at the
previous auction on Sept. 4. Investors bid for 1.97 times the
amount sold, up from 1.5 times last month.  Volatility on Dutch bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today, followed by those of German and Spain, according
to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between two- and
10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  Spanish bonds returned 9.3 percent this year through
yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Italy’s
rose 5 percent, while German bonds lost 1.8 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
