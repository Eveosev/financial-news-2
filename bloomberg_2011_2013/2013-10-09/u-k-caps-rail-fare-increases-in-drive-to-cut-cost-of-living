The U.K. government capped the amount
rail companies can increase fares in a move it said may save
some commuters as much as 200 pounds ($320) a year.  Train operators will only be permitted to increase fares by
6.1 percent in January 2014, down from the 9.1 percent that
would have been permitted under current rules, Transport
Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said in an e-mailed  statement .  Companies are allowed to increase prices annually by
inflation plus 1 percent and had been able to add an additional
5 percent to some tickets as long as the average rise on a range
of regulated fares was limited to 1 percent above inflation.
That extra charge will now be limited to 2 percent.  “By capping fares we are protecting passengers from large
rises at a time when family incomes are already being
squeezed,” McLoughlin said today. “We will need to wait for
the rail industry to calculate individual ticket prices for next
year, but this cap could save some commuters as much as 200
pounds a year.”  Retail-price inflation  in July 2013, on which the fare
increase is calculated, was 3.1 percent.  The announcement is part of a  fares and ticketing review 
published by the Department for Transport today, which also
encourages the development of paperless tickets, a code of
conduct so passengers are confident they are getting the best
deal for their journey, and the introduction of season tickets
for part-time workers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
