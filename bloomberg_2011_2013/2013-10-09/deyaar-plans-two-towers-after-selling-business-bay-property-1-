Deyaar Development PJSC (DEYAAR) , the property
company controlled by  Dubai Islamic Bank PJSC (DIB) , sold an office
building in the Business Bay district for 141 million dirhams
($38 million) and plans to build two towers in the area, Chief
Executive Officer Saeed Al Qatami said in an interview.  The buildings will have 700,000 square feet (65,000 square
meters) of space, including homes and shops, the CEO said today
at the  Cityscape Global  property conference in Dubai. Sales will
probably start this year, he said.  Like most of Dubai’s developers, Deyaar’s sales and profit
tumbled when the emirate’s property market imploded in the
financial crisis. The company posted annual profits in the last
two years after recording a net loss of 2.87 billion dirhams for
2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Now we have finished all restructuring and we are working
on new projects,” after “tough” years in 2010 and 2011, Al
Qatami said.  The company has been selling its portfolio of about 1
million square feet of homes and offices, most of it in Business
Bay, he said. Funds from the sales, along with advance sales and
bank loans will pay for new projects.  The company is working with Dubai Islamic Bank on a bridge
loan to start the Business Bay development, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
