Argentina ’s Senate today began to
debate the 2014 budget bill, which proposes the use of a record
$9.9 billion of central bank  reserves  to pay government debt.  The 72-member upper house will debate budget forecasts that
envisage 6.2 percent  economic growth , consumer prices rising 9.9
percent and a weakening of the peso to 6.33 per dollar by the
end of next year from today’s 5.8218. The bill was approved by
the lower house on Sept. 26.  “We’re maintaining a managed floating  exchange rate  and
avoiding a  currency devaluation , which would have a negative
impact on  income distribution  and internal prices,” Anibal Fernandez, a senator from the ruling Victory Front coalition,
said at Congress today. “We’re counting on more private
investment that will accompany economic growth.”  Since 2010, President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  has
drained reserves to pay foreign-currency obligations,
contributing to this year’s decline of almost 20 percent in
central bank funds to $34.7 billion yesterday. South America’s
second-biggest economy hasn’t sold bonds abroad since defaulting
on $95 billion of debt in late 2001.  The budget’s economic forecasts have been questioned by
opposition senators who say the government has underreported
inflation and overestimated growth since 2007, when Fernandez’s
late husband and predecessor Nestor Kirchner changed personnel
at the statistics agency. The  International Monetary Fund 
censured Argentina in February for failing to report accurate
data.  ‘Fantasy’ Budget  In the 12 months through August  consumer prices  rose 10.6
percent, according to the agency, while a report compiled by
opposition lawmakers using statistics provided by private
economists put the increase at 25.2 percent.  “This budget is a fantasy, the numbers make no sense
whatsoever,” said opposition Senator Sonia Escudero in a
telephone interview during the debate. “By underestimating
inflation, the government will count on more funds than expected
and have the power to arbitrarily allocate them.”  Tax revenue  will increase 27 percent while spending will
rise 19 percent in 2014 from this year, resulting in a  budget
surplus  of 0.11 percent of gross domestic product, compared with
a deficit of 1.77 percent of GDP in 2013, according to the bill.  The world’s largest exporter of  soybean oil  forecasts the
2014  trade surplus  will narrow to $10.1 billion from $10.6
billion this year, according to the bill.  To contact the reporter on this story:
