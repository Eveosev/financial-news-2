India , where water availability per
person has shrunk by 70 percent in six decades, will set up a
monitoring agency for government, industry and private users to
help meet its target of cutting leaks and waste by a fifth.  Improved water use will help India save 500 billion rupees
($8 billion), M. Satyanarayana, adviser to India’s water
ministry, said today in New Delhi. The government will establish
the National Bureau of Water Use Efficiency by the financial
year that ends in March, he said.  The agency will help India, where 80 percent of its water
supplies go for agriculture and food crops, to label irrigation
equipment and help factories to set standards for water use,
Satyanarayana said. At least 60 percent of the water supplied to
Indian farms is wasted, he said.  To counteract that, India’s water ministry plans to set up
an agency similar to the  Bureau of Energy Efficiency  to ensure
efficient water usage by agriculture and industry, he said.  Industrial water demand in the second-most populous country
may surge 57 percent by 2025, with India being the most water-stressed of the Group of 20 nations that includes  China ,
according to HSBC Holdings Plc estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
