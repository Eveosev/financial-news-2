Crossrail, the U.K. government
project to develop a high-speed rail network from the west to
the east of  London , has completed construction of the first of
its new train tunnels under the city.  The 4.2 mile (6.8 km) passage from Royal Oak in west London
to Farringdon in the city center is one of 10 that will
collectively create 26 miles of tunnels under the city,
Crossrail said in a  statement .  “Construction continues to move ahead at a significant
pace,” Crossrail Program Director Andy Mitchell said.
“Crossrail has not only completed the first Crossrail tunnel
under London but has reached the half-way point for our
tunneling machines with a phenomenal 13 miles of tunnels
constructed to-date.”  The estimated 15 billion-pound ($24 billion) project will
cut commuting times by as much as half when completed in 2018.
The rail line is expected to carry more than 200 million
passengers a year and boost London’s rail capacity by 10
percent.  A second tunnel in central London’s Holborn area is due for
completion this winter, and another six machines will finish
digging next year, Crossrail said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
