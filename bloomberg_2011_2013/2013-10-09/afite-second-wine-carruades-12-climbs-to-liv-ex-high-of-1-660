Seventy-two bottles of 2012
Carruades de Lafite, the second wine of Chateau Lafite-Rothschild, sold for 1,040 pounds ($1,660) a case on the Liv-ex
market this week, setting a high for the year for the vintage.  The transaction is 3 percent up from the 1,012 pounds at
which it traded on Sept. 6 and the 1,010 pounds it fetched in
April soon after its release to the market, according to data on
Liv-ex’s Cellar Watch website. It is also 5 percent up from the
low of 988 pounds it reached on May 3, as the price slid in its
first week of trading on the London-based exchange.  The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index, tracking leading Bordeaux
vintages, has declined since March 15, paring an 8 percent gain
made in the previous 11 weeks to leave it 1 percent up since the
start of this year. Lafite, a first-growth wine estate in
Pauillac on the left bank of the Gironde, is one of the highest-priced growers of Medoc along with  Chateau Latour , Chateau
Mouton-Rothschild and  Chateau Margaux . Lafite’s second wine can
benefit when investors shun the region’s more expensive rivals.  “September saw losses for all of the Liv-ex indices,”
Liv-ex said in its monthly market commentary. “First growths
were hardest hit.”  Family Estate  The market price of the 2012 Carruades de Lafite is the
estate’s cheapest in the past quarter century, according to
merchant data compiled by Liv-ex. The vintage was rated in a
range of 87 to 89 on a 100-point scale by U.S. critic  Robert Parker  in an April online tasting note, putting it level with
2011 and below the previous five vintages.  Carruades contains a higher percentage of Merlot than 
Lafite's main wine and sells at less than one third of
the price, according to Liv-ex data. The 2012 vintage of 
Chateau Lafite-Rothschild traded at 3,700 pounds on Liv-ex 
last week.  Lafite has more than 100 hectares (247 acres) planted with
red-grape vines. Cabernet Sauvignon typically makes up from 80
percent to 95 percent of its main wine, with Merlot from 5 
percent to 20 percent, and smaller quantities of Cabernet
Franc and Petit Verdot.  The vineyards, owned by  Domaines Barons de Rothschild
(Lafite) , date back at least to the 17th century and the estate
has been under the control of the Rothschild family since 1868,
when Baron James de Rothschild, then head of its French branch,
acquired the property.  To contact the reporter on this story:
