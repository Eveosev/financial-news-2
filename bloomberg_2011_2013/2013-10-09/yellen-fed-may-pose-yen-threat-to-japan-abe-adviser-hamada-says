Janet Yellen ’s nomination as Federal
Reserve chairman raises the odds of prolonged U.S. stimulus that
could strengthen the yen and damage the Japanese economy, said
Koichi Hamada, an adviser to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.  “Yellen probably won’t seek an exit from an accommodative
policy immediately,” Hamada, a former Yale University
professor, said in a phone interview from  Connecticut . If the
Fed lengthens stimulus, the yen may gain, hurting Japan’s
recovery, Hamada said.  Hamada, 77, was one of Abe’s advisers on the creation of
the reflationary policies called Abenomics and on choosing a
governor for the  Bank of Japan , the job taken by Haruhiko Kuroda
in March this year. Today, Hamada said that Kuroda and his
officials must be ready to act if a stronger yen damages the
world’s third-biggest economy.  The yen tumbled about 20 percent against the dollar in the
past year, helping Japanese exporters and Abe’s efforts to jolt
the nation out of a 15-year deflationary malaise. The BOJ has
already rolled out unprecedented stimulus.  “The BOJ doesn’t have to promise anything now, but I want
them to be ready in case damage to  Japan ’s economy becomes
clear,” Hamada said.  While Hamada has Abe’s ear, Hamada doesn’t speak for the
Japanese government and Abe doesn’t always follow his advice. On
Oct. 1, Abe announced that the government was pressing ahead
with a sales-tax increase that Hamada opposed.  Hamada welcomed Yellen’s nomination, saying that her
experience and expertise made her the best person for the job.  To contact the reporter on this story:
