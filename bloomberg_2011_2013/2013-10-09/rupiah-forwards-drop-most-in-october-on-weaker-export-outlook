Indonesia’s rupiah forwards fell the
most in a week on concern slowing global economic growth will
hurt the nation’s exports, which dropped for a 17th month in
August. Government bonds advanced.  The International Monetary Fund yesterday cut its global
economic expansion outlook for this year to 2.9 percent from an
earlier projection of 3.1 percent. The U.S. risks a “very deep
recession” if Congress doesn’t raise the $16.7 trillion debt
ceiling, President  Barack Obama  said yesterday. The rupiah’s 14
percent decline last quarter is in line with Indonesia’s
fundamentals, the central bank said in a statement yesterday.  Rupiah one-month non-deliverable forwards declined 0.2
percent to 11,313 per dollar as of 4:28 p.m. in Jakarta, the
biggest drop since Oct. 2, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
offshore contracts were 1.9 percent stronger than the onshore
spot rate, which weakened 0.1 percent to 11,533 per dollar,
according to prices from local banks. The spot rate has traded
between 11,490 and 11,575 over the past week.  “The uncertain global economy is pressuring the rupiah as
it weighs on the export outlook,” said Nurul Eti Nurbaeti,
Jakarta-based head of treasury research at PT Bank Negara
 Indonesia . “The rupiah should be stable near this new
equilibrium as both the central bank and the government seem
comfortable with this level to help limit imports.”  Growth Forecasts  The IMF cut its growth forecast for  China , Indonesia’s
biggest overseas market, to 7.3 percent next year from a July
projection of 7.7 percent. China took 14 percent of the nation’s
non-oil shipments in August, official data show. The Washington-based lender cut its 2013 expansion forecast for Indonesia to
5.3 percent from 6.3 percent.  A daily fixing used to settle offshore rupiah forwards was
set at 11,214 per dollar, from 11,191 yesterday, according to
the Association of Banks in  Singapore . One-month implied
volatility, a measure of expected moves in the exchange rate
used to price options, fell six basis points, or 0.06 percentage
point, to 15.61 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Bank Indonesia issued guidelines for individuals and
companies, including state-owned firms, to hedge against
currency swings, it said in a statement posted on its website
today. The central bank kept its benchmark  interest rate  at 7.25
percent. The hold was predicted by 17 of 18 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg. The monetary authority has increased the rate by
1.5 percentage points since mid-June.  “Tight and prudent monetary policy is still needed to
maintain monetary stability, especially amid global
uncertainty,” Aldian Taloputra, an economist at PT Mandiri
Sekuritas in Jakarta, wrote in a report today, forecasting the
reference rate will be raised to 7.5 percent by year-end.  The yield on the government’s 5.625 percent bonds due May
2023 dropped two basis points to 8.05 percent, the lowest level
since Sept. 24, according to prices from the Inter Dealer Market
Association. The yield has dropped 45 basis points this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
