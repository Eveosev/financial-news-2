The home fields of the Indianapolis
Colts, Minnesota Vikings and New Orleans Saints were shortlisted
to host the Super Bowl in 2018, National Football League
Commissioner Roger Goodell said.  Indianapolis,  Minneapolis  and New Orleans were selected
yesterday from among six bidders at the NFL owners’ meeting.  New Orleans has hosted 10 Super Bowls including this year’s
title game, which was interrupted by a blackout.  Minneapolis,
where a new downtown stadium is scheduled to open in 2016, last
staged the event in January 1992. Indianapolis got the
championship game two years ago.  The next four Super Bowls are in East Rutherford, New
Jersey; Glendale,  Arizona ; Santa Clara, California, and Houston.  The 2018 Super Bowl will be awarded in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
