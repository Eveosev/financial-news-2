Steel reinforcement-bar futures
traded near the lowest level in three months after the
 International Monetary Fund  cut its forecast for China’s
economic growth, damping demand for the building material.  Rebar for delivery in January on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell as much as 0.5 percent to 3,580  yuan  ($585) a
metric ton and traded at 3,585 yuan at 10:14 a.m. local time.
Futures fell to 3,541 yuan yesterday, the lowest for a most-active contract since July 2.  China’s growth will be 7.6 percent this year and 7.3
percent next year, the IMF said yesterday, compared with July
predictions of 7.8 percent and 7.7 percent. The  World Bank 
lowered its China estimate a day earlier.  “The weaker macro fundamentals may suppress liquidity and
property markets, reducing rebar demand,” said Wang Yongliang,
an analyst at Beijing Cifco Futures Co. in Tianjin.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port gained 0.2
percent yesterday to $131.70 a dry ton, according to a  price
index  compiled by The Steel Index Ltd. The average  spot price  of
rebar was little changed yesterday at 3,491 yuan a ton,
according to Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
