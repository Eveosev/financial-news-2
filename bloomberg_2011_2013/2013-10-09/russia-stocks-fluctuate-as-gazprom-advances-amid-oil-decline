Russian equities swung between gains
and losses as the biggest companies by index weight rose, while
crude oil declined.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  added as much as 0.4 percent before trading
little changed at 1,504.02 as of 12:56 p.m. in Moscow. OAO
Gazprom, the natural-gas export monopoly, increased 0.5 percent
to 151.91 rubles. OAO Sberbank, Russia’s biggest lender, rose
0.6 percent to 102.55 rubles. OAO Rosneft, the nation’s largest
oil producer, traded up 0.2 percent.  Investors may be buying state companies’s shares on bets
they will be made to pay more in dividends, according to
Vladimir Bragin, head of research at Alfa Capital in Moscow.
Russia’s Finance Ministry is calling on state companies to
increase payouts to at least 35 percent of profit under
international accounting standards from 2016. Gazprom has the
biggest weighting on the Micex at 15.8 percent, while Sberbank
has the second largest at 14.5 percent.  “We’re seeing investors switching into blue-chip stocks,”
Bragin said by phone. “The government is pushing for higher
dividends among state companies, this is a positive signal for
investors in Gazprom, Rosneft, Transneft.”  Crude oil fell 0.1 percent to $103.34 in New York.  Russia 
receives about half of its budget revenue from the oil and
natural-gas industries.  Cheapest Valuations  The Micex has added 3.4 percent in five days. Even after
the rally, Russian equities have the cheapest  valuations  among
21 emerging economies monitored by Bloomberg, with shares on the
index trading at 4.5 times projected 12-month earnings, compared
with a multiple of 10.5 for the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index.  Ten-day  price swings  on the Micex subsided to 15.305 from
15.329 yesterday. The dollar-denominated  RTS Index (RTSI$)  retreated 0.2
percent to 1,469.19.  President  Barack Obama  said yesterday that the U.S. economy
risks a “very deep recession” if Congress doesn’t raise the
debt ceiling. Obama spoke after he called House Speaker John
Boehner to “reiterate that he won’t negotiate on a government-funding bill or debt-limit increase,” said  Brendan Buck , a
Boehner spokesman.  Still, lawmakers began taking the first tentative steps
toward a path to raising the limit even as the rhetoric grew
more divisive. Senate Democrats are planning a test vote before
the end of this week on a measure that would grant Obama
authority to raise the ceiling, probably for a year, unless two-thirds of both chambers of Congress oppose.  To contact the reporter on this story:
