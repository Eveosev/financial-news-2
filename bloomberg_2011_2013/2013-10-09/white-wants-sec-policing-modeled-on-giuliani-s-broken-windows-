U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission Chairman Mary Jo White said her enforcement program
will emulate the “Broken Windows” strategy used by former  New
York  Mayor  Rudy Giuliani , pursuing small violations to avert a
culture where laws are treated as toothless guidelines.  “Minor violations that are overlooked or ignored can feed
bigger ones,” White said at a securities enforcement conference
in Washington today. “What we can do is allocate our resources
in such a way so that market participants understand we are at
least looking and pursuing charges in all directions.”  White, since taking over the agency’s helm in April, has
upended a decades-old policy of allowing defendants to settle
cases without admitting wrongdoing and has said corporate
penalties must have “teeth” to deter future misconduct. To
cover broader ground with limited resources, she said the agency
is using “force multipliers” such as data analytics and
whistleblowers.  At the same time, White said, the enforcement division is
prioritizing bigger cases to send a message of deterrence to the
industry and boost investor confidence.  “I believe the SEC should strive to be that kind of cop --
to be the agency that covers the entire neighborhood and pursues
every level of violation,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
