U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron’s
government defended its new rules on consumer energy bills after
the opposition Labour Party said only 10 percent of customers
would be helped.  Cameron pledged in 2012 to change the law to force
suppliers to move customers onto the cheapest tariff. It was an
off-the-cuff commitment that came as a surprise to aides.  The Energy Bill, currently in the final stages of its
progress through Parliament, gives ministers the power to
require a supplier to change the price a customer is charged for
energy only if they’re on a “closed tariff” -- one that’s not
being offered to new customers. Labour said today that only 2.5
million of the country’s 27 million households are on such
tariffs. The party has pledged to freeze bills until the start
of 2017 if it wins the 2015 election.  “These figures are misleading,” the Department for Energy
said in an e-mailed statement. “Before the end of the year,
energy suppliers will be forced to offer no more than four core
tariffs per fuel. As these changes take effect, more people will
be on tariffs closed to new customers, and suppliers will need
to move these customers on to the best deal for their
preferences. Suppliers will also be required to tell all their
own customers if there is a cheaper tariff for them.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
