Offshore  Gulf Coast  oils weakened
against benchmark West Texas Intermediate after regional
supplies of oil reached the highest seasonal level on record.  The Energy Information Administration reported yesterday
that crude stocks in the Gulf Coast, or PADD 3 region, rose to
188.6 million barrels last week, the highest level for this time
of year in data going back to 1990.  Mars fell 20 cents to a discount of $1.50 a barrel to WTI
at 4:26 p.m. in New York, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Refineries in the region  processed  7.97 million barrels a
day of crude and other feedstocks in the week ended Oct. 4,
239,000 barrels a day less than the previous week, as refiners
shut units for planned and unplanned maintenance.  Heavy Louisiana Sweetâ€™s premium to WTI dropped 25 cents a
barrel to $3.40. Light Louisiana Sweet was unchanged at a
premium of $3.60.  Southern Green Canyon weakened by 30 cents to a discount of
$3.40 a barrel. Poseidon fell 20 cents to a discount of $2.30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
