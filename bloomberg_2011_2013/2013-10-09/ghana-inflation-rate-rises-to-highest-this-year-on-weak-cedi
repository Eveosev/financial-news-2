Ghana ’s  inflation  quickened in
September to the fastest pace this year as the cedi remained at
a record low, boosting the cost of imports, and the government
removed subsidies on gasoline.  The inflation rate rose to 11.9 percent from 11.5 percent
in August, Baah Wadieh, a statistician at the Ghana Statistical
Service, told reporters in the capital, Accra today. The
statistics office began using a 2012 base for inflation in
January.  “The impact of the fuel price adjustment was felt on
inflation through transport fare increases,” Collins Appiah,
director of asset management at NDK Asset Management Ltd. said
by phone before the release.  The government began removing subsidies on gasoline prices
this year, raising prices for fuel, a majority of which is
imported. Oil has risen 18 percent in  London  since reaching a
one-year low in July. The cedi has dropped 13 percent this year
against the dollar, the second-worst performer among the African
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Ghana’s National Petroleum Authority raised gasoline prices
by 3.7 percent on Sept. 16. The central bank left the benchmark
 interest rate  unchanged for a second consecutive month on Sept.
18 to counter sluggish growth and a weaker cedi. The inflation
rate will return to within the bank’s target of 9 percent plus
or minus 1 percentage point by the second half of next year,
Governor Kofi Wampah said last month.  The cedi was unchanged at 2.19 per dollar at 10:56 a.m. in
Accra. The rand is the only African currency that has dropped
more than the cedi this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
