Ultra-low-sulfur diesel slid as crude
tumbled after the government reported that oil inventories grew
the most in a year last week.  Futures dropped as much as 1.5 percent, as crude sank the
most in three months. The Energy Information Administration
reported that  oil stockpiles  rose 6.81 million barrels in the
week ended Oct. 4.  Distillate inventories  fell 2.4 percent.  “Are you going to stand there and buy more heating oil
futures when the sky is falling in crude oil futures?” said Tim Evans, an energy analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New
York.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for November delivery declined 3.17
cents, or 1.1 percent, to $3.0008 a gallon at 1:30 p.m. on the
New York Mercantile Exchange, after settling yesterday at the
highest level since Sept. 18. Trading volume was 5.8 percent
below the 100-day average.  West Texas Intermediate crude for November delivery
declined $1.92, or 1.9 percent, to $101.57 a barrel on the
Nymex.  Distillate inventories fell 3.14 million barrels to 126
million. Analysts in a Bloomberg survey estimated a 1.15
million-barrel withdrawal. Supplies in the U.S. East Coast, or
PADD 1, declined 1.51 million barrels to 40 million. Exports
were estimated at a record 1.39 million barrels a day, based on
the latest monthly data for July. That’s 28 percent higher than
a year earlier.  Downside Risks  “There’s two significant downside risks for heating oil
and diesel,” Evans said. “One is falling crude prices. And at
some point, the export market hits a wall.”  ULSD’s  premium  versus West Texas Intermediate, a rough
measure of the refining margin, widened 61 cents to $24.49 a
barrel. The  crack spread  over Brent rose 11 cents to $17.32.  Crude stocks are up more than expected, Evans said.
“Distillate stocks are down more than expected. It’s a crack-spread trade,” Evans said.  Prices also slid as as the partial U.S. government shutdown
entered a ninth day with no resolution. Besides the budget
impasse that led to the shutdown, U.S. borrowing authority will
lapse on Oct. 17 unless a politically divided Congress raises
the debt ceiling.  “The market is getting concerned that the deadlock is
going to spill over into the debt-ceiling negotiations,” said
 Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.
“Heating oil is getting dragged down by crude although it’s not
unexpected crude would build in the midst of fall maintenance.”  Gasoline Stockpiles  Gasoline stockpiles  rose 149,000 barrels to 219.9 million.
Analysts estimated a 1.05-million-barrel increase. Inventories
in PADD 1 grew 2.4 million barrels to 58.4 million as imports
climbed 7.3 percent to 547,000 barrels a day. PADD 1 includes
New York Harbor, the delivery point for Nymex gasoline and
diesel futures.  Gasoline for November delivery slipped 1.97 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $2.6109 a gallon on trading volume that was 8
percent below the 100-day average.  The motor fuel’s  crack spread  versus WTI widened $1.09 to
$8.09 a barrel. The fuel’s  premium  to Brent increased 60 cents
to 93 cents a barrel.  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, increased 0.5 cent to
$3.354 a gallon, 46.1 cents below a year ago, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said today on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
