The combined fuel costs for Japan’s
nine regional power companies will almost double to 7.5 trillion
yen ($77 billion) this fiscal year from three years earlier, the
Ministry of Trade, Economy, and Industry predicted.  Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501)  and eight other power companies
will have to pay 3.6 trillion yen more in combined fuel costs
this fiscal year than in fiscal 2010 to make up for lost nuclear
power output, the ministry known as Meti estimated in a  report 
today. The forecast assumes Japan won’t restart any of its
nuclear reactors by the end of March 2014, it said.  Kansai Electric Power Co.’s Ohi No. 3 and No. 4 reactors
were shut for planned safety checks in September, leaving the
country with no nuclear power output for the first time since
July 2012. An increase in fossil-fuel imports would force Japan
to have a third consecutive annual trade deficit in the year
ending in March, the government-affiliated Institute of Energy
Economics,  Japan , said in an August report.  The power companies boosted the use of liquefied natural
gas and oil as their reactors were shut one by one after the
March 2011 Fukushima disaster, which shattered Japan’s
confidence in the safety of nuclear energy. LNG costs in fiscal
2013 will rise by 1.7 trillion yen from three years earlier,
while utilities will have to pay 2.1 trillion yen more in costs
to purchase crude and fuel oil, Meti said in the report.  Coal costs will rise 100 billion yen, while fuel expenses
related to nuclear-power generation will fall 300 billion yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
