LightSquared Inc.,  Philip Falcone ’s
bankrupt wireless-spectrum company, will get court permission to
have creditors vote on four competing plans to restructure the
company.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Shelley Chapman in  Manhattan  today
said she would approve all four disclosure statements, which
describe the reorganization plans, once final versions are
submitted. The plans come from the company, an ad-hoc group of
lenders, Falcone’s Harbinger Capital Partners LLC, and  U.S. Bank 
NA and Mast Capital Management LLC. Creditors will vote by
Dec. 5, according to court papers.  “All parties have consensually agreed to resolve their
formal and informal objections to each others’ disclosure
statements,” Matthew S. Barr, a lawyer for LightSquared, told
Chapman today.  LightSquared’s plan proposes a sale of almost all of its
assets at auction while the company seeks approval from the
Federal Communications Commission to use its airwaves. The
lender group, which holds $1.4 billion of the $1.7 billion in
debt of LightSquared’s LP unit, has a similar plan calling for a
sale. A unit of Charlie Ergen’s  Dish Network Corp. (DISH)  would make a
lead, or stalking-horse, bid of $2.2 billion.  Harbinger Plan  Harbinger’s plan would reorganize LightSquared without a
sale. U.S. Bank and Mast, a Boston-based  investment adviser ,
focused on the sale of a LightSquared unit, One Dot Six. A unit
of Mast, which was LightSquared’s bankruptcy lender, would begin
the auction by bidding an amount equal to the company’s debt
under the loan, according to court papers.  LightSquared had at first objected to the three rival
plans, saying they would waste resources of the bankruptcy
estate. Its own plan “subsumes the isolated plans” proposed by
the other parties, LightSquared said in court papers.  One creditor, Centaurus Capital, had objected to all plans
save Harbinger’s, saying they didn’t disclose some potential
problems: LightSquared will need more money before the end of
the year, and selling the company before it gets FCC approval
would make the entire reorganization unworkable under bankruptcy
law, Centaurus said in court papers.  LightSquared, based in Reston,  Virginia , filed for
bankruptcy in May 2012, listing assets of $4.48 billion and debt
of $2.29 billion. U.S. regulators blocked the service after
makers and users of global positioning system devices, including
the U.S. military and commercial airlines, said LightSquared’s
signals would confound navigation gear.  Suit Halted  Separately, LightSquared can halt a lawsuit that Harbinger
brought against the GPS industry, Chapman said. The company said
the case overlaps with issues raised in the bankruptcy.
LightSquared asked the court to keep the lawsuit from going
forward for 60 days as it might “distract key LightSquared
officers and employees from the restructuring efforts at a
critical stage.”  The case was filed in August in U.S. District Court against
Deere & Co.,  Garmin International Inc. (GRMN) ,  Trimble Navigation Ltd. (TRMB) ,
the U.S. GPS Industry Council and the Coalition to Save Our GPS.  Falcone, a billionaire hedge-fund manager, in August agreed
to be banned from the securities industry for at least five
years under a settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission over whether he improperly borrowed money from
Harbinger to pay his personal taxes and favored some investors
over others.  The bankruptcy case is In re LightSquared Inc., 12-bk-12080,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of  New York 
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
