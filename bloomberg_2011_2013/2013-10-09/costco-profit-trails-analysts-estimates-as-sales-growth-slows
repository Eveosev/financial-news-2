Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST) , the largest
U.S. warehouse-club chain, posted fourth-quarter profit that
trailed analysts’ estimates, hurt by higher costs and lower
gasoline prices that crimped sales.  Net income in the quarter ended Sept. 1 rose to $617
million, or $1.40 a share, from $609 million, or $1.39, a year
earlier, the Issaquah, Washington-based company said today in a
statement. Analysts projected profit of $1.46, the average of 13
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Costco joins retailers from  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  to  Macy’s
Inc. (M)  in reporting sales that trailed analysts’ projections for
their most recent quarters as U.S. consumers restrain spending.
The profit  miss , Costco’s first in eight quarters, came as
selling, general and administrative expenses rose faster than
some analysts expected and revenue climbed at the slowest pace
since 2009.  Higher expenses “could be attributable to continued IT
spending and/or healthcare related expenses,”  David Strasser ,
an analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in New York, wrote
today in a note. He recommends buying Costco shares. “Both
negative  gas prices  and negative FX hurt” September comparable-store sales.  Revenue rose 0.8 percent to $32.5 billion, trailing
analysts’ $32.7 billion average estimate. The gain was the
smallest increase since  sales  fell in the quarter ended August
2009. Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 1.8
percent to $3.1 billion, more than the 0.3 percent increase
projected by Strasser.  Shares Fall  Costco advanced 2.1 percent to $114.59 at the close in New
York. The shares have climbed 16 percent this year, matching the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Sales at  stores  open for more than a year increased 5
percent in the period, excluding changes in gasoline prices and
foreign-currency exchange rates. That compared with an increase
of 7 percent on that basis in the third quarter.  Separately,  Family Dollar Stores Inc. (FDO) , the second-largest
U.S. dollar-store chain, said revenue rose 5.8 percent to $2.5
billion in the quarter ended Aug. 31, trailing analysts’ $2.56
billion average estimate.  “The environment was more challenging than expected,”
Chief Executive Officer  Howard Levine  said in a statement,
without elaborating.  Family Dollar , based in Matthews, North Carolina, said it
would earn $3.80 a share to $4.15 a share in the year ending
Aug. 30. Analysts’ estimate $4.12.  The shares slipped 1.1 percent to $68.71.  To contact the reporter on this story:
