Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa, the
Atlantic City resort owned by  Boyd Gaming Corp. (BYD)  and  MGM Resorts
International (MGM) , won permission to offer online gaming in  New
Jersey , becoming the first casino to gain approval there.  The permit was granted by New Jersey’s Division of Gaming
Enforcement, the hotel said today in a website statement. MGM
and Boyd are working with  Bwin.Party Digital Entertainment Plc (BPTY) ,
based in Gibraltar, to offer online gaming in the U.S.  “Borgata and bwin.party are aggressively pursuing our
objective of being among the first to launch online gaming in
the state,” Tom Ballance, Borgata’s president and chief
operating officer, said in the statement.  New Jersey legalized online gambling in February. Dave Rebuck, director of the state gaming enforcement division, has
said he expects operators to begin offering service by Nov. 26.  Online gambling is expected to be a $7.4 billion business
in the U.S. by 2017, according to the research firm H2 Gambling
Capital. Nevada and Delaware are the other two states that allow
online betting.  Station Casinos LLC’s Ultimate Gaming and  Caesars
Entertainment Corp. (CZR)  offer online poker in Nevada. Delaware’s
three horse tracks are expected to begin offering online betting
this month.  Casinos Co-Opt Timberlake Movie in Push for Legal Online Poker
