Dyson Ltd., the maker of bagless
vacuum-cleaners, sued the European Union over what it calls the
“misleading” labeling of energy efficient vacuum cleaners.  An energy label, developed by the EU to help people choose
household appliances, will also apply to vacuum cleaners in the
28-nation bloc. Dyson filed a challenge at the EU General Court
in  Luxembourg  this week, arguing that the EU’s method of
evaluating what label vacuum cleaners get will favor old-fashioned models that use bags.  “The energy label could have guided people towards high
performing, energy efficient vacuum cleaners,” James Dyson,
founder of the company, said in an e-mailed statement. “Instead
it will mislead people by overstating the energy efficiency of
old fashioned technology which loses performance in the home.”  Starting in September, vacuum cleaners must meet certain
energy performance criteria and the test to evaluate this is
misleading, Dyson argued, because it requires this be done in a
laboratory with an empty and dust-free vacuum. The test also
fails to include the cost of bags and filters, Dyson said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
