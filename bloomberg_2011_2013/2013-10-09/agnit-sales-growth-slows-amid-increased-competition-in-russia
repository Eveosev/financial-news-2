OAO Magnit (MGNT) ,  Russia ’s largest
retailer, said sales growth slowed in September amid increased
competition and as new stores took business from old ones.  Revenue last month rose 28 percent to 46.2 billion rubles
($1.42 billion), the Krasnodar, Russia-based company said today
in a  statement . That compares with growth of about 31 percent
for January through August.  The sales missed estimates because of price deflation and a
1.4 percent decline in the number of customers visiting the
stores in the third quarter, according to Mikhail Terentiev, an
analyst at Otkritie Capital. Management paid more attention to
profit margins rather on adding customers, he said.  “Witnessing tougher competition as well as stronger
cannibalization effect of our stores in July-September this
year, we have focused on operating efficiency and paid less
attention to traffic,” Magnit’s billionaire Chief Executive
Officer Sergey Galitskiy said in the statement.  Food-price deflation was 0.7 percent in the third quarter
compared with 0.7 percent inflation in the same period a year
earlier, Magnit said. Customer numbers at convenience stores,
which account for three-quarters of Magnit’s sales, fell 1.8
percent at outlets open at least a year.  Magnit fell 0.2 percent to $65.85 at 8:22 a.m. in  London ,
where the stock has its main listing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
