World soccer’s governing body gave a
lifetime ban to a Sri Lankan member of its executive committee
for bribery and other breaches of FIFA’s ethics code.  Vernon Manilal Fernando won’t be able to take part in any
international soccer activities as part of the ban, which comes
after a two-day appeal hearing in Zurich. Fernando and Michael J. Garcia, the chief investigator, were both appealing an April
decision to suspend the official for eight years.  FIFA’s Appeals Committee turned down Fernando’s appeal and
upheld that of Garcia, it said today in an e-mailed statement.  FIFA didn’t give details of the breach which led to the
suspension. Fernando joined the executive committee in 2001.  The lifetime ban was imposed for violations of several FIFA
rules, including those covering offering and accepting gifts and
other benefits and bribery and corruption, FIFA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
