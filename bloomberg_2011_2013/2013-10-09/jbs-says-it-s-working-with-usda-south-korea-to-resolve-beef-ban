JBS SA (JBSS3) , the world’s largest beef
producer, said it’s working to resolve  South Korea ’s suspension
of some imports from the U.S. after traces of the feed additive
zilpaterol were found in a consignment.  The substance, banned in South Korea, was detected in a 22-ton shipment from Greeley, Colorado-based Swift Beef Co. on
Sept. 24, according to a statement from the Ministry of Food and
Drug Safety today.  Swift is a unit of Sao Paulo-based JBS, which said today
it’s working with the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  and the
South Korean government.  “Given the current situation in Washington D.C. and the
lack of official notification from South Korea, we do not have
definitive information at this time,” JBS’s U.S. unit said in
an e-mail. “This is not a food safety issue.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
