A Chinese court sentenced a man to
life in prison for the sale of cooking oil produced from the
waste of meat processors as authorities crack down on  food-safety  violations.  Wang Chengkui, the legal representative for Kangrun Co.,
will also be deprived of his political rights for life and have
all his assets confiscated, the Lianyungang Intermediate
People’s Court said in a statement on its website yesterday. The
oil Kangrun sold was produced using discarded materials such as
skins, chicken buttocks and pig offal, the official Xinhua News
Agency reported.  Premier  Li Keqiang  has promised to ensure food safety after
incidents including tainted baby formula and chemicals in liquor
sparked public outrage. That included a 2011 pledge by the State
Council,  China ’s cabinet, to “thoroughly” destroy the
production and sale of so-called “gutter oil.”  Kangrun sold more than 60 million  yuan  ($9.8 million) of
its oil to 117 food makers or oil processors from January 2011
to March 2012, the court in the eastern province of Jiangsu
said. Another 15 people were also given prison sentences for
their roles, it said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
