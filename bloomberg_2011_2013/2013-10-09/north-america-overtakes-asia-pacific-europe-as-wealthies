North American households have
overtaken those in Asia-Pacific and  Europe  as the wealthiest for
the first time since 2005 boosted by a recovery in U.S. house
prices and an equity market rally,  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  said.  A recovery in the world’s largest economy fueled a fifth
consecutive year of wealth growth in  North America , rising 12
percent in the 12 months to mid 2013 to $78.9 trillion. The
Asia-Pacific region suffered from a 20.5 percent fall in Japan’s
wealth as that country flooded its economy with cash, weakening
the yen, Credit Suisse said in its global wealth report. Wealth
in Asia-Pacific fell 3.7 percent to $73.9 billion, the Zurich-based bank said.  Extraordinary monetary stimulus has helped propel the  U.S.
economy  by an annualized rate of 2.5 percent in the second
quarter, faster than the previous three months, government data
showed Sept. 26. With U.S. house prices rising 7 percent during
the 12 months to mid 2013, households there are now 54 percent
more wealthy than they were during a recent low in 2008, Credit
Suisse said.  In the U.S., “wealth per adult has fully recovered, and is
now 10 percent above the 2006 level,” the report said. “The
forthcoming reduction in monetary stimulus announced by the
 Federal Reserve  raises doubts about whether the recovery will
continue, but the signs are positive for household wealth in the
immediate future.”  More Millionaires  The wealth of European households climbed 7.7 percent to
$76.3 trillion, while wealth worldwide increased by 4.9 percent
to $241 trillion, according to the report.  Global wealth will rise by 39 percent to $334 trillion over
the next five years, Credit Suisse said, with 29 percent of the
projected growth expected from  emerging markets . Asia-Pacific
region will see a 75 percent increase in millionaires over the
next five years to 11.5 million in 2018 with China seeing an 88
percent rise, it said.  The U.S. is expected to have the highest aggregate wealth
of about $100 trillion by 2018 and  China  will overtake Japan as
the second wealthiest economy in 2016, Credit Suisse said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
