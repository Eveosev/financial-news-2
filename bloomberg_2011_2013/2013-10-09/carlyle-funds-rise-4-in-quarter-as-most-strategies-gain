Carlyle Group LP (CG) , the world’s second-biggest manager of alternative assets such as private equity and
real estate, said the funds from which it can collect a slice of
profits appreciated 4 percent in the third quarter and 13
percent this year through September.  Carry funds that invest in buyouts gained 5 percent in the
quarter and 20 percent in 2013, Washington-based Carlyle said
today in a statement. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of large
U.S. companies rose 4.7 percent in the quarter, and the MSCI
All-Country World Index increased 7.4 percent.  Carlyle, which oversees $180 billion across 118 funds and
81 funds-of-funds, is set to report full earnings for the third
quarter on Nov. 8. The firm held its  initial public offering 
last year and has disclosed preliminary fund performance before
its scheduled earnings reports to allow stockholders to see the
figures when its fund investors typically do.  Most of Carlyle’s strategies posted gains for the quarter.
Carry funds in Carlyle’s real estate unit rose 3 percent and
those investing in energy were unchanged.  The firm’s Global Market Strategies funds, which invest in
distressed companies and lend to mid-sized companies as well as
energy and power projects, appreciated 2 percent in the quarter
and 18 percent in 2013.  Blackstone Group LP (BX) , the largest alternative-asset manager,
is set to report third-quarter results on Oct. 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
