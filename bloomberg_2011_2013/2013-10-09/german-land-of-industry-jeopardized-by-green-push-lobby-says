Germany  will threaten jobs and hamper
growth if it persists with expanding renewable energy at the
current pace, a chemical lobby said.  Continuing with uncapped subsidies to renewable developers
and removing aid for companies that use a lot of energy risks
211 billion euros ($285 billion) in gross domestic product and
1.3 million jobs by 2030 compared with a slower renewable
expansion and greater use of natural gas, the VCI lobby said,
citing a new  IHS Inc. (IHS)  study it commissioned.  “The current course of the energy switch is extremely
dangerous for Germany, the land of industry,” Karl-Ludwig Kley,
president of the VCI, told reporters today in Berlin. “The
charges of the energy switch can decide over profit or loss,
growth or decline, survival or collapse.”  Chancellor Angela Merkel  needs to keep a lid on soaring
energy bills that have provoked consumer and industry anger as
her government phases out nuclear reactors, a 550 billion-euro
plan that has helped saddle Germans with the third-highest
electricity prices in the European Union. Merkel has vowed to
change the EEG clean-energy subsidy law aimed at increasing the
share of renewables to 80 percent of the power mix by 2050 from
about 23 percent now, to reduce the plan’s costs.  Germany can remain competitive if it continues to shield
large energy consumers from the EEG’s costs, expands the use of
gas and slows the pace of the renewable expansion by adding
fewer offshore wind farms, IHS said in the study.  “Rising electricity costs present a challenge similar to
one Germany faced a decade ago from a rigid labor market,” Ralf
Wiegert, director of IHS Economics, said in a statement handed
out at the event.  To contact the reporter on this story:
