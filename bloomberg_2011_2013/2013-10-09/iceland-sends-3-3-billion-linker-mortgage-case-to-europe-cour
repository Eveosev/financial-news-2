Icelandic banks face the prospect of
further $3.3 billion in writedowns should a  European Court  find
inflation-linked mortgages unlawful.  Iceland’s  Supreme Court   approved  a request to seek a legal
opinion from the European Free Trade Association’s court in
Luxembourg on whether Islandsbanki hf broke the law when it sold
an inflation-linked mortgage to one of its clients, the
Reykjavik-based body said in a ruling late yesterday.  Iceland’s banks have already forgiven $2.1 billion in debt
since the country’s 2008 crisis wiped out its financial
industry. The island’s lenders were in 2010 found to have
illegally linked loans to foreign exchange rates. A similar
outcome now could force as much as 400 billion kronur ($3.3
billion) in additional in writedowns, the majority of which
would fall onto the shoulders of the state-owned  Housing Finance
Fund , according estimates by Iceland’s Homes Association. The
group opposes linking consumer loans to inflation.  The case against Islandsbanki alleges that the way
inflation-linked loans are sold in Iceland clashes with European
Economic Area laws banning unfair terms in consumer contracts,
according to the court documents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
