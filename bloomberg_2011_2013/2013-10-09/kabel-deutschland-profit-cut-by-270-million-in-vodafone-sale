Kabel Deutschland Holding AG (KD8)  said
that its sale to  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  will trigger loss of tax
deferrals and financing charges that will cut net income by
about 205 million euros ($277 million) this fiscal year.  Kabel Deutschland also lowered its revenue growth forecast
for the year ending in March after a slowdown in the first
quarter. Sales should grow 5 percent to 6 percent for the year,
compared with earlier projection for 8 percent growth, the
Unterfoehring, Germany-based cable company said yesterday.  The cable operator also adjusted its revenue figures to
exclude carriage fees from public broadcasters, which were 25
million euros last fiscal year.  Vodafone is buying the German company to add to its
broadband and TV offerings in its biggest market as the Newbury,
England-based carrier expands beyond wireless service. The
transaction -- which values  Kabel Deutschland  at 84.50 euros per
share, or about 7.5 billion euros -- is scheduled to close this
month.  Kabel Deutschland added 84,000 subscribers to its phone and
Internet business and 55,000 for premium television service in
the second quarter.  Shareholders of Kabel Deutschland will meet today to vote
on a 2.50 euro-per-share dividend.  Kabel Deutschland fell less than 1 percent to 93.88 euros
at 9:54 a.m. in  Frankfurt . The  shares  have gained 66 percent
this year. Vodafone gained less than 1 percent to 215.85 pence
in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
