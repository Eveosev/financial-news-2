Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s latest iPhones, the 5s
and 5c, will be available in Italy, Russia, South Korea, Spain
and more than 25 additional countries on Oct. 25, expanding on
the product’s debut in a handful of markets last month.  The rollout will spread to other parts of the world a week
later, when more than a dozen countries, including India and
Mexico, get the new iPhones on Nov. 1, Cupertino, California-based Apple said today in a statement.  Apple sold a record 9 million iPhones in the weekend debut
of the two new models in September, when the product was offered

mobile-phone market, at the same time as the U.S.  The initial sales exceeded analysts’ projections, sending
