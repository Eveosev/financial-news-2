Banks are still not doing enough to
change a culture of profits over ethics and must do more to
regain public trust, the U.K. finance regulator’s top enforcer
will say.  Tracey McDermott, the Financial Conduct Authority’s
director of enforcement and financial crime will say in a speech
tonight that the financial services industry must “walk the
walk as well as talk the talk.”  Banks’ reputations have been tarnished by a number of
scandals since the financial crisis in 2008. Lenders have paid
fines for rigging benchmark  interest rates , while others were
penalized for failing to halt the laundering of money in
sanctioned countries such as  Iran .  “Even after all these years since the start of the crisis,
the reaction of certain individuals is to say, “not my job guv
-- we aren’t regulators,” McDermott will say according to
comment in an e-mailed statement from the FCA. “As long as the
industry believes the problems are created by the regulator or
are there to be fixed by the regulator, then nothing will
change.”  Adair Turner , the former chairman of FCA predecessor’ the
Financial Services Authority, made a number of calls last year
to change banking culture in the wake of the Libor interest
rate-rigging scandal. He said reforming the banking culture had
to start with the most senior levels of management questioning
excessively profitable products.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
