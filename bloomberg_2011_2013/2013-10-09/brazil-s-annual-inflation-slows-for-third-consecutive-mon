Brazil’s annual inflation slowed for
the third consecutive month in September, as the central bank
carries out the world’s biggest cycle of interest-rate
increases.  Consumer prices as measured by the benchmark IPCA  index 
rose 5.86 percent from the year before, the national statistics
agency said, compared with the median forecast of 5.85 percent
from 31 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Still, the monthly rate
accelerated to 0.35 percent from 0.24 percent in August, as
prices of transport, clothing and housing increased.  President  Dilma Rousseff ’s government has cut back stimulus
measures including consumer tax breaks as policy makers raise
borrowing costs to slow price increases in  Latin America ’s
largest economy. Analysts polled by Bloomberg forecast the
central bank will lift the benchmark Selic interest rate for a
fifth straight meeting today.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2015, the most
traded in  Sao Paulo  today, rose three basis points to 10.11
percent at 9:18 a.m. local time. The real strengthened 0.2
percent to 2.2060 per  U.S. dollar .  The central bank in August started a $60 billion program of
swaps and credit line auctions to buoy the real to prevent a
weaker currency from stoking inflation that twice this year
breached the 6.5 percent top of its target range. The real has
appreciated 10.4 percent since the program was announced on Aug.
22, more than any other major currency in the world.  The central bank in August raised its benchmark Selic rate
to 9 percent, the third straight 50 basis-point increase. The
board will boost borrowing costs by 50 basis points at its
monetary policy meeting that ends today, according to every
 estimate  from 49 analysts polled by Bloomberg.  Brazil ’s inflation is under control and the currency
intervention has provided positive results, the bank’s President
Alexandre Tombini said Oct. 3 in  London . He said in an interview
a day earlier policy makers would work in 2014 to bring
inflation as close to target as possible. The bank targets
inflation of 4.5 percent, plus or minus two percentage points.  Economists polled weekly by the central bank forecast
inflation of 5.82 percent this year and 5.95 percent in 2014.
Policy makers in a quarterly report last month raised their 2014
inflation forecast to 5.7 percent from 5.2 percent, citing a
weaker currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
