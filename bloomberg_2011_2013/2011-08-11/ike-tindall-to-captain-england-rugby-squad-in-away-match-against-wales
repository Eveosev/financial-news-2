Mike Tindall  will captain the
England rugby team in this weekend’s World Cup warm-up match
against Wales in Cardiff.  Tindall replaces the injured Lewis Moody as captain with
manager  Martin Johnson  making 13 changes to his starting lineup
from last week’s 23-19 win over Wales in London. Wing Mark Cueto
and prop Alex Corbisiero are the only returning starters as
Johnson rotates his squad ahead of his final World Cup selection
on Aug. 22.  “Last weekend’s match was hugely competitive and we expect
more of the same as we prepare to travel to the Millennium
Stadium,” Johnson said in a  statement . “We took a lot out of
Saturday’s game and this weekend gives the selected players
their opportunity and a chance for us to improve our overall
performance.”  England plays its final warm-up match Aug. 27 in Ireland
before opening the  World Cup  in New Zealand against Argentina on
Sept. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
