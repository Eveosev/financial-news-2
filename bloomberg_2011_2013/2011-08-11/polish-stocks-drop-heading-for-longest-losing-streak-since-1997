Poland’s benchmark stock index fell,
heading for the longest losing streak since 1997, as financial
shares extended losses and television network  TVN SA (TVN)  reported
earnings that missed analysts’ estimates.  The WIG20 Index tumbled 2.2 percent to 2,146.31 at 12:05
p.m. in Warsaw, heading for its ninth consecutive daily loss.
The gauge has plunged 27 percent from a 2011 high on April 8,
amid speculation that  Europe ’s debt crisis is spreading and the
U.S. economic recovery is stalling.  “Global sentiment weighs on the market and there are also
concerns that local mutual funds may see cash withdrawals if the
situation doesn’t stabilize soon,” said Grzegorz Zawada, who
heads equity research at PKO Bank Polski SA’s brokerage.  Polish mutual funds, among the biggest investors on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange , managed 119 billion zloty ($40 billion)
of assets at the end of July, according to data from Analizy
Online SA, a Warsaw-based research company. The total value of
Polish stocks listed in Warsaw stands at $155 billion, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Bank Pekao SA (PEO) , majority-owned by UniCredit SpA, sank 4.3
percent to 123.9 zloty, poised to close at a two-year low.  BRE
Bank SA (BRE) , a unit of Commerzbank AG, slid 2.7 percent to 230.6
zloty, falling for an eighth day. Bank Handlowy SA, controlled
by Citigroup Inc. declined 1.1 percent to 61.75 zloty.  TVN, put up for sale by majority owner ITI Holdings SA,
lost 9.4 percent to 12.09 zloty, heading for the lowest close
since July 2009. Second-quarter net income was 67.9 million
zloty ($23 million), missing the 86.8 million-zloty mean
estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH) , Poland’s sole copper producer, sank
4.3 percent to 152.9 zloty, its second day of losses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
