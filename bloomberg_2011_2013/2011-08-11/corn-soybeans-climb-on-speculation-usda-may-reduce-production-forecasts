Corn and soybeans rose in  Chicago  on
speculation the U.S. government will cut estimates for the
nation’s harvest this year as hot weather curbs yields.  U.S. farmers may harvest 13.079 billion bushels of corn,
below the Department of Agriculture’s July estimate of 13.47
billion bushels, according to the average estimate of 31
analysts in a Bloomberg News survey. Soybean output may be 3.184
billion bushels, under the USDA’s 3.225 billion-bushel forecast,
the survey showed. The USDA will release the latest outlook at
8:30 a.m. in  Washington  today.  “In view of the poorer quality of the plants, downside
revisions of expected crop yields are likely for corn and
soybeans,”  Carsten Fritsch , an analyst at Commerzbank AG in
 Frankfurt , said in a report today. “Coupled with continued
robust demand, the expected corn ending stocks for 2011-2012
should also be lower than previously thought.”  Corn for December delivery rose 3.75 cents, or 0.5 percent,
to $6.9225 a bushel by 11:17 a.m.  London  time on the Chicago
Board of Trade. Soybeans for November delivery climbed 15.75
cents, or 1.2 percent, to $13.1725 a bushel.  Production of ethanol, made from corn in the U.S., rose
last week to a nine-week high of 908,000 barrels a day,
according to an Energy Department report. Production of the
biofuel that’s mixed with gasoline was forecast by the USDA last
month to use about 38 percent of the nation’s corn crop.  Harvest Yields  Corn yields in the U.S., which accounts for 39 percent of
the global harvest and more than half of world exports, may
average 155.4 bushels an acre, the Bloomberg survey showed, less
than the government forecast for 158.7 bushels. Soybean yields
may drop to 42.9 bushels an acre, below the 43.4 bushels
forecast by the USDA.  “The grain fundamentals specifically are quite tight
still, and that’s showing itself in the market,” said
Christopher Gadd, an analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd. in London.
“The belief out there is that there’s a problem in corn. We’ve
seen corn prices supported because there’s talk of lower yields
in the Midwest.”  Wheat for December delivery gained 4 cents, or 0.6 percent,
to $7.2325 a bushel. Milling wheat for November delivery traded
on NYSE Liffe in Paris rose 1 euro, or 0.5 percent, to 196 euros
($278) a metric ton.  To contact the reporters on this story:
