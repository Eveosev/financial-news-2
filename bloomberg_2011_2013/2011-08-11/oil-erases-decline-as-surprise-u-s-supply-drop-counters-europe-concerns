Oil declined in  New York  as concern
that the European sovereign debt crisis is worsening countered
the largest decline in U.S. crude inventories since December.  Futures slid as much as 2.1 percent after U.S. equities
fell and the cost of protecting French debt reached a record.
The  European Central Bank  bought Italian and Spanish bonds to
help cut borrowing costs, according to people familiar with the
transactions. Switzerland’s central bank said it will
“significantly” increase the supply of liquidity to lenders.  “It’s a confidence game at the moment,” said  Jonathan Barratt , a managing director of Commodity Broking Services Pty
in Sydney who has maintained his forecast for New York crude to
average $100 a barrel this year. The Energy Department data is 
what “we should focus on but the market isn’t going to look at
it. People are more inclined to look at what’s happening in the
equity market,” he said.  Crude for September delivery dropped as much as $1.75 to
$81.14 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  and was at $82.50 at 3:31 p.m. Sydney time. The
contract rose 4.5 percent to $82.89 yesterday. Prices are 5.7
percent higher the past year.  Brent oil for September settlement slid 31 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $106.37 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The European benchmark contract traded at a
premium of $23.81 to U.S. futures, compared with yesterday’s
record close of $23.79.  Equities Fall  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropped 0.8 percent to 121.90
as the cost of protecting the government debt of  Greece , Italy,
 Spain  and  France  rose. The gauge pared a loss of as much as 2.4
percent. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 4.4 percent in New
York yesterday. That followed its biggest jump in more than two
years on Aug. 9 and its worst loss since 2008 on Aug 8.  “Market sentiment appears to be outweighing market
fundamentals,”  Mark Pervan , head of commodity research at
Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Melbourne, said in
a note today. The bank estimates oil in New York will average
$100 a barrel in the third quarter. “Just as the U.S. found
some market support,  Europe ’s negative debt situation returned
to the fore.”  U.S. crude-oil inventories decreased 5.23 million barrels
to 349.8 million last week, according to an Energy Department
report. It was the biggest decline since the week ended Dec. 17.
Inventories were forecast to climb 1.35 million barrels,
according to a Bloomberg News survey of analysts.  U.S. Stockpiles  Total products supplied, a measure of demand, surged
652,000 barrels a day to 20.3 million, the highest level since
Dec. 24, according to the report. Gasoline stockpiles dropped
1.59 million barrels to 213.6 million, the report shows.  The  International Energy Agency  signaled yesterday it may
need to cut estimates for global oil demand in 2012 as “storm
clouds” threaten economic recovery.  Worldwide oil consumption will expand by 1.6 million
barrels a day next year to 91.1 million a day, the Paris-based
adviser said in its monthly market report. There are increasing
risks that global gross domestic product will fall short of
expectations, causing demand instead to advance by 600,000
barrels a day, the IEA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
