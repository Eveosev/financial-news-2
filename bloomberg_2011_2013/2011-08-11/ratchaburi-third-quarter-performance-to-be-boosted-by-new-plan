Ratchaburi Electricity Generating
Holding Pcl (RATCH) , a Thai power producer, expects its financial
performance to improve in the third quarter from a year earlier
because of revenue from a new hydropower plant and income from
investments in  Australia , President Noppol Milinthanggoon said.  He didnâ€™t clarify whether the estimate was for revenue or
net income. Noppol also said the company plans to increase its
stake in an Australian unit to 80 percent from 56 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
