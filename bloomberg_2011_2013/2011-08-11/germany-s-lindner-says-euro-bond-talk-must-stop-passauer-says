Christian Lindner, general secretary
of  Germany ’s Free Democratic Party, said the discussion about
euro bonds has to end,  Passauer Neue Presse  reported, citing an
interview.  “Markets are speculating about it futilely,” Lindner,
whose party is in coalition with Chancellor Angela Merkel’s
 Christian Democrats , was quoted as saying. “Germany can’t
assume responsibility for the debt of crisis countries,” he
said, according to the newspaper. That would make Germany’s
financing more expensive and take away incentives for reform in
countries such as Greece, he said, Passauer reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
