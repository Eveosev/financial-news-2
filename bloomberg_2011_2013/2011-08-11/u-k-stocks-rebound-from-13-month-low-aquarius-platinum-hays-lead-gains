U.K. stocks climbed the most since
May 2010, with the benchmark  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  rebounding from a
13-month low, as mining companies advanced.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s largest mining company,
climbed 5.4 percent.  Aquarius Platinum Ltd. (AQP)  gained 8.6 percent
after earnings beat analysts’ estimates.  Hays Plc (HAS) , the U.K.’s
biggest recruitment company, rose 3.9 percent as UBS AG advised
buying the shares.  The FTSE 100 gained 3.1 percent to 5,162.83 at the 4:30
p.m. close in  London , having earlier fallen as much as 1.3
percent. The FTSE All-Share Index advanced 3 percent, while
Ireland’s ISEQ Index climbed 1.7 percent.  The FTSE 100 had declined 16 percent from the beginning of
July through yesterday, wiping more than $566 billion from the
value of U.K. shares, on speculation that  Europe  will fail to
contain its sovereign-debt crisis and that the U.S. economic
recovery is faltering. The slump has pushed down the gauge’s
price-to-earnings ratio to 9.1 times the estimated earnings of
its constituent companies, below the average multiple of 11.5
over the last five years, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “I’ve been putting money to work, gently,” said Piers Hillier, chief investment officer at Liverpool Victoria Asset
Management Ltd., which manages 8 billion pounds ($13 billion)
“Incrementally adding here is a sensible thing,” he said in a
Bloomberg Television interview. He is “overweight” in
developed-market equities.  BHP Billiton , Aquarius  BHP Billiton Ltd., the world’s largest mining company,
gained 5.4 percent to 1,966 pence as aluminum, copper, lead,
nickel, tin and zinc rallied in London.  Aquarius Platinum Ltd. (AQP)  gained 8.6 percent to 235.6 pence.
The miner of platinum and palladium in  South Africa  and Zimbabwe
reported full-year underlying earnings that exceeded analysts’
estimates.  Hays gained 3.9 percent to 75.5 pence. The stock was
upgraded to “buy” from “neutral” at UBS and raised to
“neutral” from “underweight” at HSBC Holdings Plc.  Anglo Pacific Group Plc (APF)  rallied 8.9 percent to 280 pence
after posting record first-half royalty income of 16.4 million
pounds, compared with 15.7 million pounds a year earlier. The
company increased its interim dividend by 7.6 percent to 4.25
pence a share.  To contact the reporters on this story:
