Indian companies led by  Adani
Enterprises Ltd. (ADE) , Bhatia International Ltd. and  JSW Energy Ltd. (JSW) 
increased coal imports by 8 percent in July from a month
earlier, according to data from  Interocean Group of Companies .  Power, steel, cement and paper producers purchased 10.8
million metric tons of steam and coking coal last month via 30
Indian ports, the New Delhi-based ship broker said.  India â€™s domestic coal production may fall short of demand
by 142 million tons in the financial year ending March 2012,
according to the coal ministry. The nation produces 530 million
tons of coal a year and imports about 67 million tons,
Sriprakash Jaiswal, coal minister, said in September.  Paradip, a port on the east coast, received the most coal
shipments in July, totaling 1.52 million tons. Visakhapatnam,
Gangavaram and  Krishnapatnam , all on the east coast, received
978,221 tons, 877,882 tons and 755,438 tons of the fuel,
respectively, Interocean data showed.  The monsoon from June to September can slow coal imports on
the west coast and divert shipments to ports in the east.  Most imports came from Indonesia,  Australia  and  South
Africa . State-owned  Steel Authority of India Ltd. (SAIL)  bought two
shipments while Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd. and  Shree Cement Ltd. (SRCM) 
received one shipment each from the U.S., the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
