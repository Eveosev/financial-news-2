Cell C Ltd.’s borrowing costs fell
to a six-week low after  South Africa ’s third-biggest mobile
phone company reported an increase in revenue and its subscriber
base last year.  The 11 percent bonds due in 2015 rose for a fourth day,
increasing $0.06 to $102.375, reducing Cell C’s yields by two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 10.2 percent, the
lowest on a closing basis since June 30, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Revenue rose 5 percent to 10.2 billion rand ($1.4 billion)
in 2010, Cell C said. Cell C should become profitable “quite
soon” and had debt of 8 billion rand as of December, acting
Chief Executive Officer Simon Duffy said in a presentation in
Johannesburg today. Duffy is temporarily filling in for former
CEO Lars P. Reichelt, who left for personal reasons, Cell C said
July 13.  The start-up of Telkom South Africa Ltd.’s 8ta mobile-phone
service hasn’t had much effect on Cell C’s business, Duffy said.
Cell C also competes with  Vodacom Group Ltd. (VOD) , the biggest
provider of wireless services to South Africans, and  MTN Group
Ltd. (MTN) , the continent’s largest mobile operator.  In June Cell C issued a tender for all of its $270 million
subordinated bonds due in 2015. The company offered a premium of
3.125 percent, with 40 percent of bondholders tendering their
notes. Following the tender,  Standard & Poor’s  put Cell C’s
credit rating on a positive outlook.  To contact the reporter on this story:
