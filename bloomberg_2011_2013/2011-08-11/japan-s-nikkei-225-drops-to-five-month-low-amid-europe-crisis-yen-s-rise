Japanese stocks pared losses as
higher earnings forecast from companies including  Nikon Corp. (7731)  to
Sumitomo Rubber Industries Ltd. offset concern Europe will fail
to contain its debt crisis.  Mazda Motor Corp. (7261) , the Japanese carmaker most dependent on
Europe, slumped 4.3 percent on speculation the region’s debt
crisis will damp earnings for exporters. Canon Inc., the world’s
biggest camera maker by market capitalization, dropped 1.2
percent. Rival Nikon Corp. surged 7.9 percent after the company
raised its full-year profit forecast by 43 percent.  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average fell 1 percent to 8,951.07 as
of 2:00 p.m. in Tokyo, paring losses of as much as 2.3 percent
earlier. The Topix slid 1.1 percent to 768.17, with about three
stocks falling for every two that rose.  “As  Europe ’s debt crisis spreads, concern is mounting
about damage to the financial system,” said Mitsushige Akino,
who oversees about $600 million in Tokyo at Ichiyoshi Investment
Management Co. “We may slip back into a global equity slump.”  Equity markets worldwide lost more than $7 trillion in a
selloff since July 26 as the  U.S. economy  showed signs of
slowing and the European debt crisis threatened to spill over
into the banking system. The rout deepened after Standard &
Poor’s Ratings Service on cut the U.S.’s credit rating on Aug. 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
