Canada ’s dollar advanced from almost
its lowest level since February as a rally in stocks reduced
demand for the greenback as a refuge.  The loonie, as the currency is known for the image of the
aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, pared its weekly loss to 0.6
percent as jobless claims in the U.S., Canada’s biggest trading
partner, unexpectedly decreased. Canadian 10-year bond yields
rose from a record low.  “Everything was overshot in this selloff, including the
Canadian dollar,” said  John Curran , a senior vice president at
CanadianForex Ltd., an online currency dealer, by telephone from
Toronto. “There’s most likely a lot of rebalancing going on
right now, and the fact that the loonie hasn’t broke back above
parity is a good thing.”  The Canadian currency appreciated 0.5 percent to 98.97
cents per  U.S. dollar  at 2:35 p.m. in Toronto, from 99.49 cents
yesterday. One Canadian dollar buys $1.0103. The currency
earlier slid to 99.69 cents, approaching the six-month low of
C$1.0010 reached Aug. 9.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 4.6 percent after
falling 4.4 percent yesterday. The S&P/TSX Composite Index
gained 2.8 percent. Crude oil, Canada’s largest export,
increased 3.2 percent to $85.55 a barrel.  Government 10-year bond yields erased yesterday’s drop,
advancing 12 basis points, or 0.12 percentage point, to 2.45
percent after falling to a record low 2.29 percent today. The
price of the 3.25 percent security due in June 2021 fell C$1.12
to C$106.93. Two-year note yields increased six basis points to
0.93 percent.  Trade Deficit  The loonie dropped earlier today after a report showed
Canada’s trade deficit was the widest in nine months, adding to
evidence the country’s recovery is waning.  The trade deficit increased in June to C$1.56 billion
($1.57 billion), the country’s fifth straight trade gap, from a
revised C$1.04 billion shortfall a month earlier,  Statistics
Canada  said today in Ottawa. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News forecast the nation would post an C$800 million deficit,
according to the median of 17 forecasts.  Canada’s currency has dropped 3.4 percent in August as
stocks worldwide tumbled on renewed concern  Europe ’s debt crisis
is getting worse and after the  Federal Reserve  said the recovery
of Canada’s biggest trade partner is “considerably slower”
than anticipated.  “The Canadian dollar has weakened sharply largely as
collateral damage,” said  Marc Chandler , global head of currency
strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., speaking by phone
from New York.  First-time applications for jobless benefits in the U.S.
decreased by 7,000 in the week ended Aug. 6 to 395,000, the
fewest since early April, the Labor Department said. Economists
forecast 405,000 claims, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the reporters on this story:
