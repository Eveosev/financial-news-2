Poland ’s WIG20 Index climbed 99.31,
or 4.5 percent, to 2,293.38 at the 5:30 p.m. close in Warsaw,
increasing the most since May 2010.  The following were among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Bank Millennium SA (MIL)  , controlled by Banco Comercial
Portugues SA, led gains among financial shares, soaring 0.5
zloty, or 14 percent, to 4.2 zloty.  BRE Bank SA (BRE)  , a unit
of Commerzbank AG, surged 28.9 zloty, or 12 percent, to 266
zloty.  Bank Pekao SA (PEO)  , Poland’s second-largest lender,
rallied 12.5 zloty, or 9.7 percent, to 142 zloty.  The zloty jumped as much as 5.5 percent against the Swiss
franc today, easing concern that banks’ foreign-currency
mortgages will sour. Franc-denominated mortgages totaled 151.8
billion zloty ($52 billion) in June, accounting for almost 53
percent of total home loans in Poland, according to the
country’s financial regulator.  AC SA (ACG PW) rose 0.4 zloty, or 2.1 percent, to 19.9
zloty as the car-parts producer started trading in Warsaw. The
company sold 40.7 million zloty of shares at 19.5 zloty each in
an initial public offering last month.  PKO Bank Polski SA (PKO PW) rose for the first time in nine
days, climbing 1.9 zloty, or 5.7 percent, to 35 zloty. Poland’s
largest bank said first-half net income rose to 1.84 billion
zloty from 1.5 billion zloty a year earlier.  TVN SA (TVN)  , Poland’s largest television network, lost
1.71 zloty, or 13 percent, to 11.64 zloty, falling the most
since March 2009. Second-quarter net income was 67.9 million
zloty, missing the 86.8 million-zloty mean estimate of seven
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
