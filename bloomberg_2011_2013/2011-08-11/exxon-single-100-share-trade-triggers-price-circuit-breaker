A single trade for 100 shares of
 Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  more than 6 percent below yesterday’s closing
price led to the triggering of a circuit breaker, pausing
trading in the stock.  The trade, later canceled, was executed at 10:33 a.m.  New
York  time at $63.47 on an exchange operated by Bats Global
Markets, according to data sent to Bloomberg. The stock closed
at $68.03 yesterday and the highest price in the 5 minutes
before the halt was $69.91, the data show.  Trading was paused under rules adopted after the May 6,
2010, stock market crash in which more than $860 billion was
erased from the value of U.S. equities in 20 minutes. Shares are
suspended if they rise or fall 10 percent within five minutes.  “It appears to be a ‘fat finger’ situation,”  Mike Shea , a
managing partner and trader at Direct Access Partners LLC in New
York, wrote in an e-mail.  Exxon Mobil, which was surpassed by Apple Inc. yesterday as
the world’s most valuable company, rose 3 percent to $70.05 at
11:32 a.m. in New York. The shares’ primary listing is on the
New York Stock Exchange, owned by  NYSE Euronext. (NYX)   “A quote was hit, triggering a pause. We have since busted
the trade,”  Randy Williams , a spokesman for Bats, said in an e-
mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
