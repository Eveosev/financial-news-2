U.S. stocks are priced at “very low
levels” because investors are nervous about earnings,
inflation, market volatility and the outlook for global growth,
according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s  Abby Joseph Cohen .  “Much of the ugly news that might take place in the
economy seems to be already priced in,” Cohen, a New York-based
senior investment strategist, said today in a radio interview on
“Bloomberg Surveillance” with Ken Prewitt and  Tom Keene .  Almost $3 trillion has been erased from U.S. equity values
in the last three weeks as the  Federal Reserve  pledged to keep
 interest rates  near zero through at least mid-2013 to bolster
U.S. growth and European Central Bank said it would buy bonds to
cap borrowing costs.  Goldman is concerned about the dragging growth in  Europe ,
the health of the European financial system and the sovereign
debt crisis, Cohen said. The U.S. also had more sluggish-than-
expected growth in the first half. Still, companies on the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index have strong balance sheets, which
they can use for share buybacks, dividend increases and
investments that lead to job creation, Cohen said.  “We do believe that many U.S. companies are sufficiently
flush with cash that they will continue to restore cash to the
shareholders,” Cohen said.  About 76 percent of companies in the  S&P 500 Index (SPX)  that
have released quarterly results since July 11 beat projections,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Earnings per share have
gained 17 percent, while sales advanced 13 percent. The S&P 500
rose 4.6 percent to 1,172.64 today.  Growth Forecast  Chief economist Jan Hatzius wrote in a note to clients on
Aug. 5 that Goldman cut its growth forecast for 2012 to 2.1
percent from 3 percent. Goldman also said it saw a one-in-three
chance of a renewed recession in the U.S. within the next nine
months.  The top-ranked strategist in Institutional Investor’s
surveys in 1998 and 1999, Cohen stayed bullish on computer-
related stocks for too long as the  S&P 500  suffered a  bear
market  from March 2000 to October 2002. She said in October 2000
that technology stocks would be a good investment in 2001. The
S&P 500 Information Technology Index then tumbled 26 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
