Singapore ’s stockpiles of residues,
or  fuel oil , fell to the lowest in a month, data from the
Ministry of Trade and Industry showed.  Onshore inventories of residues, a category that includes
fuel oil and low-sulfur waxy residue and excludes bitumen,
dropped 0.3 percent to 19.6 million barrels in the week ended
Aug. 10,  International Enterprise Singapore  said in an e-mailed
statement today. Supplies are the smallest since July 13.  Stockpiles of middle distillates, including gasoil and
kerosene, rose 11 percent to 14.8 million barrels. Light
distillates such as naphtha, reformate and gasoline dropped 6.8
percent to 8.9 million barrels, the lowest level since November
2009.  The trade ministry unit surveys refiners,  oil companies  and
storage terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude
some offshore storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
