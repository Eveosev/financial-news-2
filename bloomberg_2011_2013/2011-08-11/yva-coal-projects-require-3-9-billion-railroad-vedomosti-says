Evraz Group SA and OAO Severstal,
 Russia ’s largest steelmakers, may face difficulties mining
metallurgical coal in the untapped Tyva coal province in East
Siberia,  Vedomosti  reported, citing people it didn’t identify.  Exporting coal from the province will require 116 billion
rubles ($3.9 billion) of investment in expansion of OAO Russian
Railways’ Trans-Siberian railroad, and the state rail company
lacks money for this, the newspaper said, citing an official in
the  Economy Ministry .  Yenisei Industrial Co., acquired by Russian Copper Co.
shareholders this year, is another company seeking to develop
coal deposits in Tyva, according to Vedomosti.  To contact the reporter on this story:
