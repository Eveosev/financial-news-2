A123 Systems Inc. (AONE) , a maker of
batteries for electric vehicles, climbed the most in almost two
years after getting a contract to supply more cells to  General
Motors Co. (GM)   A123 climbed $1.41, or 44 percent, to $4.58 at 10:22 a.m.
in Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading. The shares surged as
much as 49 percent earlier, the most since September 2009.  A123 will supply lithium-ion cells and electronic parts to
Detroit-based GM for specific vehicles that will be announced
later, the automaker said today in a  statement . Kevin Kelly, a
GM spokesman, declined to provide financial terms of the
contract or production figures in a phone interview.  The contract with GM is an extension of Waltham,
Massachusetts-based A123’s existing agreements with the largest
U.S. automaker, according to the statement. A123’s customers
include Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, Daimler AG, Fisker
Automotive Inc. and Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp.,
according to a regulatory filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
