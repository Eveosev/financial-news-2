Canadian Prime Minister  Stephen Harper  said he doesn’t expect the nation’s economy will contract
after  Statistics Canada  reported the country’s trade deficit
widened to a 9-month high today.  Harper, speaking to reporters in San Jose,  Costa Rica , said
a widening of the shortfall had been expected, due to the high
value of the Canadian dollar and the relative strength of the
Canadian economy.  “It continues to be our view that the Canadian economy
will grow. It will grow gradually and slowly, along with the
world recovery,” said Harper, adding that he hadn’t seen the
latest trade figures and does not make judgments based on one
month’s data.  The prime minister said his government will push ahead with
plans to make “targeted, long-term investments” to create
jobs, while gradually cutting spending to meet its goal of
eliminating the deficit by the fiscal year that begins April
2014.  Harper, 52, said the government’s policy mix will remain
“appropriate” as long as the global economy continues to grow
as expected.  The  trade gap  increased to C$1.56 billion ($1.57 billion)
in June, the fifth straight monthly shortfall, Statistics Canada
said today in Ottawa. The trade drag will shave about 5
percentage points on an annualized basis from second-quarter
growth, according to calculations by economists such as  Doug Porter  at BMO Capital Markets.  Harper also said today his country will discuss with Costa
Rica ways to speed up the elimination of tariffs on agricultural
and industrial goods, and will ease air travel restrictions and
reduce tax evasion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
