Tanzania’s shilling appreciated for
a second day after the central bank of East  Africa ’s second-
biggest economy sold dollars to boost the local currency as it
trades near the weakest level in almost 17 years.  The shilling gained as much as 0.6 percent to 1.599.85 per
dollar and traded at 1,611.5 by 2:43 p.m. in Dar es Salaam, the
commercial capital. The currency reached 1,625 per dollar on
July 4, the weakest closing level since at least October 1994,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “We saw the central bank come in to sell dollars, and that
is when the shilling slightly gained,” Zainul Chandoo, Head
Treasurer at Standard Bank Group Ltd.’s Tanzanian unit, said by
phone today.  Tanzania’s inflation rate climbed to 10.9 percent in June,
the fastest pace in 14 months, on higher energy and food costs,
the National Bureau of Statistics said on July 15. Tanzania vies
with  Mali  to be Africa’s third-biggest producer of gold.  To contact the reporter on this story:
