Grain loadings for export from the
French port of Rouen,  Europe ’s biggest cereal-shipping hub,
more than doubled, lifted by the biggest volume of wheat for
 Algeria  in two months and the most barley shipped since May.  Outbound shipments were 177,500 metric tons from Aug. 4 to
10, the  Seine River port  said in an e-mailed statement today,
compared with 66,410 tons a week earlier. The cargoes included
130,074 tons of wheat and 47,426 tons of barley.  Algeria was the biggest export destination with 74,549
tons of wheat and 27,000 tons of barley, compared with 32,400
tons of wheat the previous week.  Egypt  was the second-biggest
destination with 39,140 tons of wheat, the first grain shipment
out of Rouen to the country in ten weeks.  Rouen accounted for 45 percent of  France ’s wheat exports
in 2009-10, ahead of La Pallice on the Bay of Biscay, which
shipped out 19 percent, according to data from national crops
office FranceAgriMer.  Rouen grain loadings by destination, in tons:  To contact the reporter on this story:
