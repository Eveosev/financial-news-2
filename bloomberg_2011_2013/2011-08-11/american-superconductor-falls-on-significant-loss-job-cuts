American Superconductor Corp. (AMSC) , a
wind-turbine component maker that lost its biggest customer in
April, sank as much as 10 percent today after it said it expects
to report a “significant net loss” in the quarter ended June
30.  The company fell 37 cents, or 6.2 percent, to $5.62 at
10:48 a.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Earlier the shares
sank to as low as $5.38.  The turbine-component maker’s shares have lost 77 percent
of their value since it said April 5 that Beijing-based Sinovel
Wind Group Co., its largest customer, had refused to accept
contracted shipments.  Sales in its first fiscal quarter were less than $10
million and the company expects to incur restructuring charges
of $3 million to $4 million in its second quarter, ending Sept.
30, as part of an effort to trim its workforce by as much as 30
percent, the Devens, Massachusetts-based company said today in a
statement.  American Superconductor is restating its financial results
for the second and third quarters and the full fiscal year that
ended March 31. It said in a filing after the close of regular
trading yesterday that it cannot complete its first-quarter
report, and it plans to submit by Aug. 16 a plan to regain
compliance with Nasdaq listing requirements.  The company was expected to report sales of $40.9 million
in the June quarter, the average of five analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
