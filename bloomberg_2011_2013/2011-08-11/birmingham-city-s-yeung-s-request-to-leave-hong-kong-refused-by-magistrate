Carson Yeung, the Birmingham City
soccer club owner facing charges of  money laundering , had his
request to leave  Hong Kong  for the U.K. rejected by a magistrate
in the Chinese city.  Acting Principal Magistrate David Dufton told Yeung today
to apply to a higher court to change the terms of his bail and
transferred the case to Hong Kong’s District Court. A hearing
date was scheduled for Aug. 30.  Yeung, 51, had to surrender his travel documents as part of
the conditions of bail that was granted June 30. He was charged
with five counts of money laundering involving HK$721.3 million
($93 million). Yeung’s lawyer Jonathan Kwan said the businessman
is needed in the U.K. because the period for player transfers
ends at the end of the month. No plea was entered today.  Yeung was released in June after posting HK$4 million in
cash and HK$3 million in cash guarantees. Each charge he faces
is punishable by up to 14 years in jail and a fine of as much as
HK$5 million.  Shares in  Birmingham International Holdings Ltd. (2309) , the West
Midlands-based team’s parent company, have been suspended since
June 30.  Birmingham was relegated from the Premier League last
season, three months after winning the League Cup, its first
major trophy in 48 years.  Birmingham, previously controlled by David and Ralph Gold
and  David Sullivan , was bought by Yeung in October 2009 in an
81.5 million-pound deal.  The case is Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and
Yeung Ka-sing Carson, ESCC2717/2011 in the Hong Kong Eastern
Magistrates’ Court.  To contact the reporter on this story:
