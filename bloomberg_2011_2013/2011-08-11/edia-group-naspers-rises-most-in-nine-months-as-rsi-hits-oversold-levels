Naspers Ltd. (NPN) , Africa’s largest media
company, rose the most in more than two years on speculation
yesterday’s drop to the lowest in almost a year was overdone.  The stock advanced 26.41 rand, or 8.2 percent, to close at
349.01 rand at 5 p.m. in Johannesburg, its biggest gain since
May 2009. Naspers plunged 4.2 percent yesterday after  Tencent
Holdings Ltd. (700) , in which the South African company has a 35
percent stake, reported profit that missed analysts’ estimates.
The company’s 14-day relative strength index, which shows how
rapidly prices advanced or dropped during a specified time
period, was 29.5 yesterday, the lowest since July 2010. A
reading of 30 or below signals to some investors that shares are
set to increase.  Kevin Mattison, an analyst at Avior Research Ltd., said
there had been an overreaction to Tencent’s results, which were
released in  Hong Kong  after the market had closed.  “The big surprise was that operating expenses had gone up,
but the core business is still operating well,” Mattison said
by phone from  Cape Town . “Both these shares are high-beta
shares and these are not normal times.”  High-beta refers to volatile stocks.  To contact the reporters on this story:
