Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC)  reported a
second-quarter profit of C$490 million ($493 million),
rebounding from a record loss a year earlier when it increased
reserves to protect against equity-market declines.  Net income at  Canada ’s largest insurer was 26 cents per
share compared with a year-earlier loss of C$2.4 billion, or
C$1.39 per share, the Toronto-based insurer said today in a
statement. The average estimate of 15 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was for 18 cents per share.  An update of U.S. mortality rates by the insurer may lead
to a third-quarter charge of as much as C$700 million on an
after-tax basis, the company said in the statement.  “While we currently cannot reasonably estimate the impact
of the additional basis changes in the third quarter, early work
suggests that our U.S. mortality table updates when completed,
may result in a material impact,” Chief Financial Officer
Michael Bell said in the statement.  Manulife rose 58 cents, or 4.6 percent, to C$13.08 at 4
p.m. in trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The shares have
fallen 24 percent this year, the second-most among the 43-member
S&P/TSX Financials Index.  “Manulife’s shares will continue to be buffeted by the
broader macro environment and, more importantly, investor
sentiment, we believe that the reported results represent a
strong quarter,” Barclays Capital analyst  John Aiken  said today
in a note to investors.  Asia  Profit Increases  U.S. insurance net income was C$299 million, compared with
a year-earlier loss of C$1.07 billion, while Canadian profit was
C$260 million, rebounding from a year-earlier loss of C$80
million, according to the statement. Manulife, which owns
Boston-based John Hancock Financial, said U.S. asset-management
profit was C$130 million compared with a loss of C$536 million.  Profit from Asia was C$28 million compared with a year-
earlier loss of C$632 million as funds under management
increased, the company said.  Manulife is the last of Canada’s four main insurers to
report quarterly results.  Great-West Lifeco Inc. (GWO) , the No. 2
insurer, said last week profit rose 16 percent to C$526 million,
or 55 cents a share, while Sun Life Financial Inc. reported that
net income surged more than fivefold to C$408 million, or 13
cents a share.  Industrial Alliance Insurance and Financial Services Inc.
said last month that profit climbed 28 percent to C$72.7
million, or 85 cents a share.  Separately, Manulife said that former  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) 
executive Andrea Rosen has been named to its board.  (Manulife will hold a conference call at 2 p.m. Toronto time to
