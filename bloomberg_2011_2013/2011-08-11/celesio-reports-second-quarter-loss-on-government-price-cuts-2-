Celesio AG (CLS1) ,  Europe ’s biggest drug
wholesaler, reported a second-quarter loss because of government
price cuts and increased competition, as well as a writedown of
businesses in Portugal and Denmark.  The loss was 86.9 million euros ($123.5 million) compared
with a profit of 50.3 million a year earlier, the Stuttgart-
based company said in a statement today. Analysts predicted a
loss of 61.4 million euros, the average of four estimates.  Celesio reaffirmed it would speed expansion into areas with
fewer government rules, including its Lloydspharmacy online site
in the U.K. The company has said that it has 1 billion euros for
potential acquisitions.  “The enormous government measures and a stagnating, in
parts declining, pharmaceutical market, significantly depressed
our earnings in the first half of the year,” interim Chief
Executive Officer Wolfgang Maehr said in a statement.  The company wrote down the value of businesses in Portugal
and  Denmark  as well as the Pharmexx division by 116.3 million
euros.  Revenue and profit fell at Celesio’s French wholesaler,
OCP, because of “intensive” competition, the company said
today. Regulations will cost Celesio 120 million euros in profit
this year, the wholesaler said, adding that weighed on German
profit as Celesio couldn’t pass along higher costs.  Profit Forecast  Celesio still expects earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization this year of about 600 million
euros, which would be a 14 percent decline, the company said
today. Second-quarter profit on that basis fell 24 percent to
130.2 million euros, beating the average estimate from 13
analysts of 126.1 million euros.  The reiteration of the full-year forecast signals that the
second half may become easier than the first half, Mark Belsey,
an analyst with WestLB, said in an interview today. Belsey, who
has an “add” recommendation on the stock, said he sees “a
number of positive catalysts in 2012.”  Celesio rose 7 cents, or 0.6 percent, to 10.62 euros at
9:22 a.m. in  Frankfurt . The shares have lost 42 percent this
year, giving the company a market value of 1.79 billion euros.
The stock on June 17 fell the most since at least 1996 after the
company said profit would drop more than forecast this year.  Revenue declined to 5.76 billion euros from 5.84 billion
euros a year earlier, falling short of the 5.79 billion-euro
average estimate.  Markus Pinger, who formerly worked for Nivea skin-cream
maker Beiersdorf AG, will take over as CEO Aug. 15, replacing
Fritz Oesterle, who retired June 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
