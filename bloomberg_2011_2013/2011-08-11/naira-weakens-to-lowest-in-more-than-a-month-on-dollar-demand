The naira depreciated to the lowest
in more than a month as  Nigeria ’s central bank failed to meet
demand at its twice-weekly foreign-exchange auction.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer weakened by
0.8 percent to 154.13 naira per dollar at 5:22 p.m. in Lagos.
That’s the lowest level since June 27.  “The depreciation was due to the inability of the central
bank to meet demand,” Lagos-based Diamond Bank analysts said in
e-mailed note to clients today.  Nigeria sold $250 million, less than the $369.3 million
demanded by lenders at yesterday’s auction, the Abuja-based
 Central Bank of Nigeria  said in a statement published today on
its website. The monetary regulator of sub-Saharan Africa’s
second-biggest economy has been using foreign-exchange reserves
to keep the naira within a 3 percentage-point band above or
below 150 per dollar at its auctions.  Dollars were sold for between 150 naira and 152.71 naira
each. The marginal rate, which is also used as the prevailing
exchange rate, was 150.75 naira, compared with 150.50 naira at
the previous auction on Aug. 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
