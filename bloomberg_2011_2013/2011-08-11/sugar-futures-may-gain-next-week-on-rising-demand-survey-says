Raw sugar may advance next week on
signs that global demand will outpace supplies.  Five of seven traders, analysts and brokers surveyed by
Bloomberg News said raw sugar in  New York  would rise. One said
it would fall, and one was neutral. Before today, futures for
October delivery rose 2 percent this week to 28.08 cents a pound
on ICE Futures U.S.  Four respondents said refined sugar on London’s NYSE Liffe
would gain, while one forecast a slide. Two expected little
change. Futures for October delivery rose 2.7 percent this week
through yesterday.  Three respondents said refined-sugar’s premium over raw
would widen, two said it would narrow, and two were neutral.  To contact the reporters on this story:
