Rosoboronexport,  Russia ’s state-run
arms trader, earned a 17 percent fee on a OAO Russian
Helicopters contract to supply aircraft to U.S.,  Kommersant 
reported, citing people familiar with the matter.  The Russian producer agreed to supply 21 Mi-17 helicopters
to the U.S. last year for $315 million to service the
Afghanistan military operation, the newspaper said. Afterwards,
Rosoboronexport joined the talks as a state intermediary and
inflated the price by another $52.5 million, Kommersant said.  The contract, which was one of the practical achievements
of the U.S.-Russia “reset” announced by the two countries’
leaders, was close to collapsing because of this, according to
Kommersant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
