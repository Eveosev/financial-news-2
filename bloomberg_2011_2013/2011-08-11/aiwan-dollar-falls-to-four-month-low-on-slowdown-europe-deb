Taiwan ’s dollar touched the weakest
level in almost four months after regional stocks slumped on
concern Europe’s debt crisis will derail efforts to boost
economic growth, sapping demand for emerging-market assets.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of shares dropped 1 percent,
while the island’s benchmark equity index fell 1.8 percent.
Relative borrowing costs climbed for France, Europe’s second-
largest economy, even as all three major ratings companies
reaffirmed the nation’s top credit grade. Ten-year  government
bonds  advanced for a second day, pushing yields to the lowest
level in almost five months.  “There’s  risk aversion  given the slowdown worries and it’s
a good time to buy bonds,” said Raymond Chen, a bond trader at
Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank Ltd. in Taipei. “The central
bank is unlikely to raise  interest rates  again at the next
meeting.”  Taiwan’s dollar dropped 0.1 percent to NT$29.025 against
its U.S. counterpart as of 9:45 a.m. local time, according to
Taipei Forex Inc. It reached NT$29.128 earlier, the weakest
level since April 19. The currency has declined 0.5 percent this
month.  The Central Bank of China (Taiwan) has raised its benchmark
discount rate on 10-day loans to banks by 12.5 basis points at
each of the last five quarterly meeting to 1.875 percent. Policy
makers next meet in September.  Global stocks slumped as the Federal Reserve’s pledge to
retain its target rate at zero to 0.25 percent at least through
mid-2013 failed to overcome concerns about the worsening debt
crisis in  Europe .  The yield on the 1.375 percent bond due March 2021 dropped
2.3 basis points, or 0.023 percentage point, to 1.349 percent,
prices from Gretai Securities Market show. The rate touched
1.330 percent earlier, the lowest level since March 18.  The overnight money-market rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, fell one basis point to 0.380 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
