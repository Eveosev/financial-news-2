Nigerian bank stocks rose the first
day in 12, snapping the longest streak of losses in at least
three years on speculation an 18 percent drop in the period was
overdone.  The  Bloomberg NSE Banking (NGSEB10)  Index, which tracks the
performance of the 10 most capitalized banks, rose 3 percent to
306.78 by the 2:30 p.m. close in Lagos, rebounding from the
weakest since January 2009 reached yesterday.  The gauge’s 14-day relative strength index, which shows how
rapidly prices advanced or dropped during a specified time
period, was 26 today. A reading of 30 or Equity  to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with 13 times reported
profit for the MSCI Frontier Markets Index.  “The valuations of the banks were getting too attractive
to be ignored, and their fundamentals do not justify such a
sell-off,” Adesoji Solanke, a Lagos-based banking analyst with
 Renaissance Capital , said by phone today. “The sector has been
oversold.”  The  Central Bank  of Nigeria on Aug. 6 nationalized Afribank
Plc, Bank PHB Plc and Spring Bank Plc on concern they won’t meet
a Sept. 30 recapitalization deadline. Asset Management Corp. of
Nigeria, set up by the central bank to buy non-performing loans
from the country’s lenders, will inject 679 billion naira ($4.5
billion) into the three banks.  Guaranty Trust Bank Plc (GUARANTY) , the country’s second-biggest
lender by market value, gained for the first time in seven days,
adding 5 percent to 12.22 naira, while  Zenith Bank Plc (ZENITHBA) , the
largest lender, rose 5 percent, the most since March 22, to
12.91 naira.  First Bank of Nigeria Plc (FIRSTBAN) , the third-biggest
lender, rallied 2 percent to 10.35 naira.  To contact the reporter on this story:
