Arsenal manager  Arsene Wenger  has
decided to sell Cesc Fabregas and Samir Nasri and is poised to
receive a 60 million-pound ($97 million) transfer windfall for
the midfielders, the U.K.’s Daily Telegraph reported.  Barcelona made a new bid for Fabregas that’s worth about 35
million pounds including add-ons, the Telegraph said, adding
that Arsenal is trying to push the fee up to 37 million pounds.
The Gunners are willing to sell Nasri to Manchester City if
their 23 million-pound valuation is met, the newspaper added.  Wenger is committed to reinvesting the transfer fees in his
squad, with center-backs Phil Jagielka,  Gary Cahill  and
Christopher Samba his three principal defensive targets, the
Telegraph said. Arsenal may also bid for Valencia midfielder
Juan Mata and Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema, the newspaper
added.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
