Turkish stocks rose, reversing
directions many times during the day before surging late in
trading to their biggest advance since May 2010.  The benchmark  ISE National 100 Index (XU100)  climbed 1,709.39, or
3.4 percent, to 52,017.02 at the 5:30 p.m. close in Istanbul.
The move was led by  Haci Omer Sabanci Holding AS (SAHOL) , which
rebounded from earlier losses to surge to limit-up in the last
minutes of trading, gaining 11 percent to 5.84 liras. Sabanci’s
bank  Akbank TAS (AKBNK)  also surged, rising 38 kurus, or 6.8 percent, to
5.98 liras.  Tupras Turkiye Petrol Rafinerileri AS (TUPRS) , the country’s
sole refiner, gained 8 percent to 32.5 liras.  “The ISE100 was the worst-performing major emerging market
in dollar-adjusted terms since panic-selling started last
Wednesday evening,” Isik Okte, a trader at Istanbul-based
Finans Invest, said in e-mailed comments. “This is a major
overreaction and if we get even a small hint of normalization in
European markets, the ISE has the potential to catch up.”  The Turkish stock market has lost 15 percent since Aug. 3,
underperforming the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, which slumped
11 percent. European stocks advanced today, rebounding from the
lowest level in two years. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index climbed 1
percent to 225.63, while the emerging markets index gained 0.4
percent as of 5:30 p.m. in Istanbul.  “We are a very high beta market, but I am expecting this
10 percent underperformance to emerging markets to reverse
starting today,” Okte said.  Turkey ’s lira has declined 13 percent since the beginning
of the year, making it the world’s worst-performing major
currency and contributing to concerns about investing in Turkey.
It dropped another 0.4 percent today to 1.7838 per dollar.  “The Turkish market is completely pegged to global
markets’ moves and global developments,”  Emre Balkeser , head of
trading at Garanti Securities, said in an instant-message
exchange. “Today’s move is just a rebound in line with global
markets.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
