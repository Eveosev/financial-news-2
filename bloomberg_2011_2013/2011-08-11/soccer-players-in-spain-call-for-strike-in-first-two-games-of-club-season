Players in Spanish soccer’s top two
divisions called for a strike for the season’s first two games,
the player’s association said today on its  website .  The association, known as AFE, and the professional league
failed to reach an agreement on collective bargaining, according
to AFE Chairman Luis Rubiales. Juanjo Montaner, a spokesman for
AFE, declined to comment when contacted by phone today.  “The professional soccer league doesn’t understand the
call for strike,” the club’s association for the two divisions
 said  in a press release on its website today. The goal is “to
advance in the negotiation and reach an accord as soon as
possible.”  A spokesman for the professional league wasn’t immediately
available for comment when contacted by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
