News Corp. (NWSA)  rose 18 percent in Nasdaq
trading, the biggest gain in almost three years, after analysts
upgraded their recommendations on the stock.  Gabelli & Co. raised its rating on the shares to “buy”
from “hold,” while Atlantic Securities boosted the stock to
“overweight” from “neutral.”  In a conference call yesterday, Chief Operating Officer
 Chase Carey  said the New York-based company, owner of the Wall
Street Journal and Fox TV, is planning share repurchases beyond
the $5 billion the company will start buying next week. He also
said News Corp.’s acquisition strategy focuses on investments in
the “tens or hundreds of millions, not billions.”  News Corp. Class A shares rose $2.48 to $16.19 at 4 p.m.
New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market. They have gained 11
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
