The cost of protecting European
corporate bonds from default surged to the highest since April
2009, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of swaps linked to 125
companies with investment-grade ratings rose 16 basis points to
165 basis points, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. at 1 p.m. in
 London .  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40 companies with
mostly high-yield credit ratings increased 67 basis points to
685. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to the senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers jumped 24 basis points to a record 255.  The indexes are benchmarks for the cost of protecting bonds
against default and an increase signals worsening perceptions of
 credit quality .  A basis point on a swap protecting 10 million euros ($14.2
million) of debt from default for five years is equivalent to
1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
