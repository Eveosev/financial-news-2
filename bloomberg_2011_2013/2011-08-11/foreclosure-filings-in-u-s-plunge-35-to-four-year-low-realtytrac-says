U.S. foreclosure filings dropped 35
percent last month to the lowest level in almost four years as
lenders and state and federal agencies increased efforts to keep
delinquent borrowers in their homes,  RealtyTrac Inc . said.  A total of 212,764 properties received default, auction or
repossession notices, the fewest in 44 months, the Irvine,
California-based data seller said today. Filings fell on a year-
over-year basis for the 10th straight month, and were down 4
percent from June. One in 611 households got a notice.  “The downward trend in foreclosure activity has now taken
on a life of its own,” RealtyTrac Chief Executive Officer James J. Saccacio said in a statement. “Unfortunately, the falloff in
foreclosures is not based on a robust recovery in the housing
market but on short-term interventions and delays that will
extend the current housing market woes into 2012 and beyond.”  The decline in foreclosure notices began last year when
 attorneys general  across the country began probing a practice
known as “robo-signing,” in which lenders and servicers pushed
through default documents without verifying their accuracy. Now
federal and state officials are also contributing to the
slowdown with payment assistance and loan modifications,
RealtyTrac said.  President Barack Obama’s administration yesterday said it’s
seeking ways to rent, sell or dispose of foreclosed homes
controlled by the government. The goal is to “bring stability
and liquidity” to the housing market, Edward J. DeMarco, acting
director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, said in a
statement. The FHFA regulates  Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac , which
together guarantee about 90 percent of U.S. mortgages.  Prices Decline  Home values fell in almost three-quarters of U.S. cities in
the second quarter from a year earlier as prices were undermined
by distressed sales, the National Association of Realtors said
yesterday in a report.  Default notices were filed on 59,516 U.S. properties last
month, down 7 percent from June and 39 percent from July 2010,
RealtyTrac said. Auctions were scheduled for 85,419 properties,
the fewest in three years. That was a decrease of 5 percent from
the previous month and 37 percent from a year earlier.  Home repossessions fell to 67,829, a decline of 1 percent
from June and 27 percent from last July. Bucking the trend,
states including  New York , Massachusetts, Georgia, Virginia and
 Illinois  had increases of 20 percent or more from June. Texas
home seizures rose 15 percent.  “The logjam may be starting to break up to a certain
extent, but it seems to be happening as a local occurrence,”
 Daren Blomquist , a RealtyTrac spokesman, said in a telephone
interview.  Nevada Is Highest  Nevada had the highest rate of filings per household for
the 55th straight month, at one in 115. California was second at
one in 239, and Arizona third at one in 273. Georgia, Utah,
 Florida ,  Michigan , Idaho, Illinois and Wisconsin were among the
top 10.  California led the nation with the most total filings at
56,193, followed by Florida at 22,377 and  Georgia  at 11,461.
Michigan was fourth at 10,894 and Illinois fifth at 10,627.  Texas, Arizona, Nevada, Ohio and Wisconsin rounded out the
top 10, said RealtyTrac, which sells default data from more than
2,200 counties representing 90 percent of the U.S. population.  To contact the reporter on this story:
