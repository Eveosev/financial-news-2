LG Electronics Inc. (066570) , the world’s
second-biggest maker of televisions, is accused of infringing a
patent related to liquid-crystal displays owned by a Taiwanese
research group.  Industrial Technology Research Institute , based in Hsinchu,
Taiwan, and supervised by the nation’s Ministry of Economic
Affairs, filed a patent-infringement complaint yesterday against
LG with the U.S. International Trade Commission in  Washington ,
seeking to block imports of LG televisions and monitors.  The patent covers a backlight module used in LCDs to
improve the uniformity of light so they have the correct
brightness. ITRI said it licenses the technology to LG’s larger
rival, Samsung Electronics Co.  ITRI, founded in 1973 “to strengthen the technological
competitiveness of Taiwan” through research and development of
new companies, last year filed four lawsuits against LG,
accusing it of infringing patents related to mobile phones, air
conditioners, Blu-ray disc players and LCD televisions.  LG has filed court papers seeking to have those cases
transferred from a federal court in Tyler,  Texas , to one in  New
Jersey .  The case is In the Matter of Certain Devices for Improving
Uniformity Used in a Backlight Module and Products Containing
the Same, Complaint No. 337-2839, U.S. International Trade
Commission (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
