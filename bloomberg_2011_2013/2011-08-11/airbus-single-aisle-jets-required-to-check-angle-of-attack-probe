Operators of Airbus SAS A320 family
single-aisle jets must check probes that help determine the so-
called angle of attack during flight after some devices showed
malfunction, the European Aviation Safety Agency said.  The directive by EASA follows tests on the Airbus final
assembly line that revealed inaccurate data because of
interference from machining oil residue left over from
manufacturing, according to a  statement .  “This condition, if not corrected, could lead to erroneous
angle-of-attack information and consequent delayed or non-
activation of the angle-of-attack protection systems which, if
during flight at a high angle of attack, could result in reduced
control of the aeroplane,” the statement said.  The angle of attack defines the angle between air flow and
the longitudinal axis of the aircraft and is a crucial component
for pilots to control the aircraft. The probes that EASA
identified as potentially faulty were manufactured by  Thales SA (HO) ,
according to the statement. Airlines should identify and replace
Thales devices that may be affected within six months, the
directive said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
