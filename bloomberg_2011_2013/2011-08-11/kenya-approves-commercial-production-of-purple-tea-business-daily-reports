Kenya’s government approved the
commercial production of a new variety of purple tea, Business
Daily reported, citing the Tea Research Foundation.  The tea has higher medicinal properties than green and
black varieties, and its oil can be used for cooking, cosmetics
and the pharmaceutical industry, the Nairobi-based newspaper
said.  Kenya is the world’s largest exporter of black tea.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
