Slovakia is sticking to its plan to
reduce the  budget deficit  to 3.8 percent of gross domestic
product in 2012 from a projected 4.9 percent this year,
according to next year’s draft budget released today.  The cash shortfall of the central budget is targeted at
3.17 billion euros ($4.5 billion), the  Finance Ministry  said in
an e-mailed statement from the capital Bratislava. The country
will need to borrow “more than” 7 billion euros and gross
public debt may reach 33.4 billion euros in 2012, equal to 44.8
percent of GDP, the ministry said.  A growing economy, set to expand 4.4 percent next year, is
helping the government cut its budget deficit and prevent the
debt crisis from spreading. A slower-than-expected recovery in
the euro area represents one of the key risks to the budget in
export-driven Slovakia, the ministry said.  “Consolidating public finances is a key priority,”
Finance Minister Ivan Miklos said at a press conference today.
“If our ambitions are fulfilled, we should meet the task to be
among the less risky countries.”  Prime Minister  Iveta Radicova ’s administration, in power
for 13 months, wants to reduce the budget gap to below the
European Union limit of 3 percent of GDP by 2013. The shortfall
ballooned to about 8 percent as the 2009 recession lowered  tax
revenue .  While the budget draft includes an 80 million-euro reserve
against a potential increase in borrowing costs, it doesn’t
stipulate any changes in taxes, nor a special bank levy, which
has been proposed by the ministry. Should the coalition agree on
these revenue-raising measures, spending may rise by 300 million
euros, Miklos said.  The government is obliged to agree on the budget and send
the spending plan to parliament for approval by Oct. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
