Oil declined before data forecast to
show that initial claims for  unemployment benefits  rose in the
U.S., the world’s largest consumer of crude.  Crude erased gains of as much as 1.6 percent in New York
and 1.4 percent in  London  as the dollar rebounded against the
euro. Applications for unemployment insurance payments in the
U.S. rose by 5,000 in the week ended Aug. 6 to 405,000, the
Labor Department is forecast to say today, according to a
Bloomberg News survey of economists.  “I see further downside to  oil prices  as austerity
policies, monetary tightening and high prices contribute to
slower economic growth,” said  Christophe Barret , a London-based
analyst at Credit Agricole CIB who predicted in June that oil
would decline “significantly” this summer. He forecasts U.S.
prices will average $81 a barrel in the fourth quarter.  Oil for September delivery was down $1.2, or 1.4 percent,
at $81.77 a barrel on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange at 1 p.m.
London time. It earlier rose as much as $1.56 to $84.45. Brent
for September settlement declined $1.60, or 1.5 percent, to
$105.08 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London.  The European benchmark traded at a premium of $23.31 to
U.S. futures, having earlier widened to a record of $25.54.  Prices in London may rise to $130 in the next 12 months as
producers such as Saudi Arabia curb output, Barclays Plc said.  Downside Protection  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries’ 12
members boosted production by 400,000 barrels a day last month
to an average of 30.07 million a day, the group said in a report
on Aug. 9.  “The big downside protection for oil, relative to most
other assets, is that OPEC can cut supply to restore the
balance,” Barclays analysts including New York-based Helima Croft said in a report. “With so little spare capacity,  Saudi
Arabia  is the world’s sole swing producer, giving it a level of
control not seen since the heights of OPEC in the 1970s.”  The Energy Department said yesterday that total products
supplied, a measure of demand, surged 652,000 barrels a day to
20.3 million, the highest level since Dec. 24. Gasoline
stockpiles dropped 1.59 million barrels to 213.6 million.  “Yesterday’s DOE report was almost unanimously bullish,”
 Stephen Schork , president of the Schork Group Inc., an energy
advisory company in Villanova,  Pennsylvania , said in a note to
clients today. “We are looking for a recoupling of the dollar-
oil link. Whether the Fed is aware of it or not, it likely just
sowed the seeds of another rally in oil.”  The dollar was at $1.4161 against the euro as of 1:02 p.m.
London time. Earlier it declined to $1.4275 after the  Federal
Reserve  this week said it may expand stimulus. A weaker U.S.
currency typically bolsters demand for dollar-priced assets such
as oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
