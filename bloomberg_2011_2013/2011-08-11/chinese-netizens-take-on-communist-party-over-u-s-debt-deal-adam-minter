On July 31, when Democrats and Republicans reached  a last-minute compromise on the United States' debt , Chinese state-owned media openly blasted the U.S., railed against the failures of the West, and used the American political crisis to warn Chinese citizens about the dangers of democracy. Generally, the millions of citizens active on Chinese microblogs welcome such criticism of the U.S. and the West. Before the debt deal, they had  routinely voiced their anger  and derision at the U.S. over the debt crisis. But contrary to the wishes of the  Chinese Communist Party officials who control the state media, ordinary Chinese microbloggers think they deserve a say in China’s public affairs. This tension between a democracy-phobic Party and millions of microbloggers is becoming increasingly palpable in  China . After the recent  high-speed train accident  at Wenzhou, public push-back against official state voices isn't surprising. And now netizens are openly challenging Chinese officials' online statements as well. Of all the state-owned Chinese media, none is more popular than the Global Times: a nationalist paper operated by the People’s Daily, the self-proclaimed official Party mouthpiece. Following the U.S. debt deal, the Global Times provided some of the most biting anti-Western, anti-democratic commentary in China. On August 9, for example, the  editors wrote : The Global Times is widely assumed to represent a significant constituency within the Chinese Communist Party. Rarely do Party members amplify such jingoistic commentary on their personal microblog accounts. But  Mei Xinyu , a senior researcher at China’s Ministry of Commerce, is an exception. When speaking with Chinese and foreign journalists, Mei normally offers them  balanced commentary  on business issues. However, on his  Sina Weibo  account, he is a fiercely nationalistic microblogger, frequently tweeting about the failures of the  United States , the West and democracy in general. Take, for example, Mei's reaction to the  July 22 massacre in Norway . Ever since the Nobel Prize Committee awarded the  2010 Nobel Peace Prize to  Liu Xiaobo , a Chinese human rights activist, in Oslo, the Scandinavian country has been decidedly unpopular with the Party leadership -- and with  those Chinese who are aware of Liu Xiaobo  and the award. Official Chinese reaction to the massacre was muted. But Mei Xinyu couldn't resist commenting on it. Shortly after news of the carnage began to circulate on Chinese microblogs, he implied in a Sina Weibo tweet that Norway had provoked the tragedy: “Hasn’t this country very much supported the old Dalai Lama … Chechen terrorists and the like? I fear this shooting incident is divine condemnation!” Mei was not shy in suggesting that the problem stemmed from  Norway 's coddling of religious minorities: Chinese netizens' backlash against Mei's tweet was immediate and widespread. Xue Biqun, a well-known investor, summarized the reactions of many when  he tweeted : “As a researcher at the Ministry of Commerce, Mr. Mei has shamed public servants by making such a statement!” Liu Hao, a reporter at the independent, Hunan-based Xiaoxiang Morning Herald, harshly criticized Mei's comment  on Weibo  and directly targeted the Party’s foreign policy choices: “If there is such a thing as divine condemnation, what will be the divine condemnation for China’s past support of Pol Pot, and current support of  Kim Jong Il ?” Liu couldn't print such scorn in his privately-held newspaper. In the face of such condemnation, Mei erased his offending tweet. Only hours later, on July 23, China’s microbloggers'  attention shifted  to the high-speed rail crash.  This likely saved Mei from a growing wave of their angry, shaming counter-arguments. Despite the nationalistic fervor of his Sina Weibo account, Mei has been a go-to source for Chinese and foreign journalists during the U.S. debt crisis. Most of the time, he has been depicted as a mild-mannered, sensible Ministry of Commerce bureaucrat. Unlike his boisterous demeanor on Sina Weibo, he is generally low-key when speaking directly with foreign journalists. For instance, on August 1, Mei had  this to say  to a Dow Jones Newswire reporter regarding the U.S. debt deal: Now consider the  far less diplomatic quote  on his Sina Weibo account on August 3: Curiously, the Chinese netizens' reaction to the anti-democratic nature of Mei’s tweet was almost uniformly negative. For example, A. Liang, a Sina Weibo user,  responded : In another response to Mei, Sina Weibo user, Highland Wolf,  saw merit in the debt deadlock  -- well beyond what most Americans discerned from the crisis: Chinese officials are quickly learning that while the public may routinely celebrate the West's decline, they’re increasingly enamored with free speech -- especially now that microblogs give netizens a platform to challenge Party officials' views.
