The Tullow Oil Plc-led  Jubilee oil
field  off  Ghana  will reach plateau output by the turn of the
year, said Kosmos Energy Ltd., its partner in the project.  The partners, including  Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC)  and Ghana
National Petroleum Corp., are “targeting production reaching”
capacity of their floating, production, storage and offloading
vessel around year-end,  Dallas , Texas-based Kosmos said today in
a statement. “Planning for the next phase of Jubilee field
development is under way,” it said.  The Tullow-led partners had planned to reach a plateau rate
of 120,000 barrels a day in “late August,” Paul McDade,
Tullow’s chief operating Officer, said July 5. The Jubilee field
is pumping about 80,000 barrels of oil a day, Kosmos said today.  “The commissioning of full water and gas injection
capability continues to be delayed,” Phil Corbett, an analyst
at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, wrote in an e-mailed
report. “One of the Phase 1 production wells is underperforming
expectations and the field partners have agreed to drill a side-
track to rectify this.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
