than the average estimate in a Bloomberg survey for 198.6

telecommunications services said it was “taking seriously” a
decision yesterday by Partner Communications Co. (PTNR IT), in
which Scailex has a 44 percent stake, not to pay a second-
quarter dividend, a payment Scailex said has “great
importance” to the company. Partner retreated 1.5 percent.  Tao Tsuot Ltd. (TAO)   slumped 5.3 percent to 0.09 shekel,
the lowest on record. The holding company said a drop in the
