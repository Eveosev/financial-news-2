Copper advanced for the first time
in seven days in  London  on speculation that demand from China,
the biggest user, will improve as the yuan strengthened against
the dollar to the highest since 1993.  Three-month delivery copper soared as much as 3.4 percent
to $8,884.75 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange, the most
since May 18. The metal traded at $8,823.25 at 3:31 p.m.
 Shanghai  time. Zinc advanced as much as 4.3 percent to $2,190 a
ton, while nickel gained as much as 4 percent to $21,799 a ton.  Metals climbed as the Chinese currency rose beyond 6.4 per
dollar, supported by the  Federal Reserve ’s pledge to keep
 interest rates  at a record low and signs Beijing will use
currency gains to help curb inflation.  China ’s July copper
imports were the highest since January as traders bought the
metal ahead of an expected seasonal rise in demand.  “We see Chinese buying supporting London prices during
Asian hours from time to time recently,” Xu Liping, an analyst
at HNA Topwin Futures Co., said by phone from Shanghai. “In
today’s case, a strong opening in Shanghai boosted London
prices. A price below $9,000 is attractive to buyers here.”  The yuan strengthened the most since November and 12-month
non-deliverable forwards climbed to a three-month high after the
central bank’s daily fixing had its biggest jump of 2011.
China’s consumer prices climbed 6.5 percent last month from a
year earlier, the fastest in three years, official data show.  ‘Good for Commodities’  A stronger yuan “is definitely good for commodities as
that allows China to import more, and it’s a sign that the
government is confident enough about the strength of domestic
demand and cares less about exports,” said  David Thurtell , head
of metals research at Citigroup Inc. in  Singapore .  Imports of the refined metal, copper alloy and semi-
finished products, gained for a second month in July, rising 9.5
percent to 306,626 tons from 280,009 tons in June, the General
Administration of Customs said yesterday.  Demand for the metal used in cables and wires is usually
subdued in the summer, when power supply disruptions can curb
production. Fabricators usually ramp up production from
September as electricity supplies improve.  China may adopt “targeted easing” in the second half to
support financing for agriculture, small and medium-sized
enterprises and social housing, the China Securities Journal
reported today, without saying where it got the information.  Potential Stimulus  “The market expects some sort of stimulus policies from
China if the condition worsens,” Xu said.  The dollar fell against a majority of its major peers
today, with the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against
the currencies of six major U.S. trading partners, dropping as
much as 0.7 percent to 74.36.  Minera Escondida Ltda., the operator of the world’s largest
copper mine in  Chile , said in a regulatory filing that a 15-day
workers strike “had no relevant impact” on output.  Copper for October delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange closed 0.6 percent down at 66,710 yuan ($10,437) a ton.
Aluminum in London gained 1.2 percent to $2,425 a ton and lead
advanced 2.6 percent to $2,335 a ton. Tin climbed 2.6 percent to
$23,330.  -- Helen Sun . Editors: Thomas Kutty Abraham, Jarrett Banks  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
