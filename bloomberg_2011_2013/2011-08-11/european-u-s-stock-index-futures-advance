European stocks rose, with the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index surging the most since May 2010, as investors
speculated that recent losses have overestimated the slowdown in
the pace of economic growth.  Societe Generale (GLE)  SA,  France ’s second-largest bank, paced
gains in banking shares.  Salzgitter AG (SZG)  rallied 21 percent after
posting a first-half profit compared with a loss a year earlier.  The Stoxx 600 jumped 3.2 percent to 230.57 at the 4:30 p.m.
close in  London , its biggest rally in 15 months. Even so, the
gauge has fallen 21 percent since its highest level this year on
Feb. 17.  “Shares look cheap,” said Henrik Drusebjerg, a senior
strategist at Nordea Bank AB in Copenhagen, in a telephone
interview. “There’s no news out there suggesting investors
should worry any more or less than yesterday.”  Of the 272 companies in the Stoxx 600 that have reported
earnings since July 11, 46 percent have missed analysts’
estimates for per-share profit, while 44 percent have beaten
projections, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
valuation of Stoxx 600 companies as a multiple of their
estimated earnings has slipped to 9.4, near its lowest level
since March 2009.  National benchmark indexes rose in every western European
market except Denmark and  Greece  today. The U.K.’s  FTSE 100
Index (UKX)  increased 3.1 percent and  Germany ’s DAX Index soared 3.3
percent. France’s  CAC 40 Index (CAC)  climbed 2.9 percent.  The VStoxx Index, which measures the cost of insuring
against a loss in the Euro Stoxx 50 Index, retreated from its
highest level since May 2010.  Societe Generale Climbs  Societe Generale jumped 3.7 percent to 23 euros. The shares
earlier soared 8.9 percent and plunged 9.1 percent. Chief
Executive Officer Frederic Oudea yesterday asked France’s market
watchdog to investigate moves in the lender’s share price.  The cost of insuring the senior debt of France’s second-
largest bank climbed 42 basis points to 379 basis points today,
according to CMA prices for credit-default swaps.  A gauge of bank stocks in the Stoxx 600 advanced 3.9
percent. Banca Popolare di Milano Scrl jumped 10 percent to 1.45
euros, rebounding from yesterday’s 8.9 percent loss.  A measure of commodity companies gained 4.5 percent, the
best performance of the 19 industry groups in the Stoxx 600.  Salzgitter, ThyssenKrupp  Salzgitter rallied 21 percent to 45.39 euros, its biggest
surge since October 2008, after posting a first-half profit of
93.7 million euros ($133.4 million), compared with a 3.5
million-euro loss a year earlier. The German steelmaker said
sales surged 18 percent and cited “the favorable” economic
environment as well as cost reductions.  ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA) , Germany’s biggest steelmaker, jumped 8.1
percent to 23.23 euros as copper, lead, nickel, tin, and zinc
all rallied on the London Metal Exchange.  Zurich Financial Services AG (ZURN)  soared 10 percent to 160.10
Swiss francs as  Switzerland ’s largest insurer posted second-
quarter profit that beat analysts’ estimates. Net income
increased 88 percent to $1.33 billion, exceeding the $1.04
billion average estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
