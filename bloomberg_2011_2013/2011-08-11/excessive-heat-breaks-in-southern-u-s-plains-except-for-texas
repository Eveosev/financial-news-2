Near-normal weather has returned to
parts of the southern Great Plains where a streak of 100-degree
days has broken, according to forecasters.  High temperatures in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and  Fort Smith ,
Arkansas, will be in the 90s through next week, according to the
 National Weather Service . The two cities had been recording
highs of 100 or more since the end of June.  However, Texas and the U.S. South are expected to stay hot,
said  Matt Rogers , president of Commodity Weather Group LLC. That
heat will spread into the Rocky Mountains, Great Lakes and mid-
Atlantic States from Aug. 16 to Aug. 20, and into the U.S.
Northeast, including  New York , and California by Aug. 21 to Aug
25, he said.  Rogers predicts Oklahoma and Arkansas temperatures will be
seasonal through the rest of the week, while the area from
eastern  Kansas  to Ohio may actually be cooler than normal.  Natural gas traders monitor weather forecasts to determine
if temperatures may boost heating or cooling needs. Futures rose
for a second day yesterday as forecasts showed hotter-than-
normal weather across much of the U.S. next week, boosting
demand from power plants.  Currently, the hottest U.S. weather is in Texas and
Louisiana, where the  National Weather Service  has issued a heat
advisory. High temperatures in the 100s are expected to last
into next week in Dallas, where the streak of 100-degree days
now stands at 40, two shy of the record set in 1980, according
to the agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
