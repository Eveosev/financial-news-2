Treasury 30-year bonds tumbled,
pushing yields up the most since 2008, on speculation  Federal
Reserve  policies will stoke inflation, which sapped demand at
the $16 billion offering of the securities.  The first auction of the debt since Standard & Poor’s cut
the U.S. credit rating on Aug. 5 drew the lowest level of demand
since February 2009. Today’s auction produced a yield of 3.750
percent, compared with the average forecast of 3.622 percent in
a Bloomberg News survey of eight primary dealers.  “People didn’t show up for this one,” said  Scott Sherman ,
an interest-rate strategist in New York at Credit Suisse Group
AG, one of the 20 primary dealers that are obligated to
participate in U.S. auctions. “Increased worry about inflation
has to get priced into the long bond, given the Fed’s
accommodative stance. For now, there will be apprehension to buy
that far out on the curve at these yield levels.”  The current 30-year bond yield increased 25 basis points,
or 0.25 percentage point, to 3.77 percent at 5:01 p.m. in New
York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The price of
the 4.375 percent securities maturing in May 2041 dropped 5, or
$50 per $1,000 face amount, to 110 25/32.  The yield rose as much as 29 basis points, the most on an
intraday basis since Nov. 21, 2008, when the  S&P 500 Index 
soared 6.3 percent after falling to its lowest level in 11 years
during a period of extreme volatility following the bankruptcy
of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  Bid’s Sag  At today’s auction, the bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges
demand by comparing total bids with the amount offered, was
2.08, compared with an average of 2.64 at the past 10 sales.  Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 12.2 percent of the bonds,
compared with 37.8 percent at the July 14 sale and an average of
39.8 percent for the past 10 auctions.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 19.5 percent,
compared with 21.9 percent of the securities at the last sale
and the 10-sale average of 10.6 percent.  “The players that play in the long end don’t feel
comfortable with all of the uncertainty that has to be factored
in,” said Jason Rogan, director of U.S. government trading at
Guggenheim Partners LLC, a New York-based brokerage for
institutional investors. “No one is worried about short-term
inflation, but with all the printing that has been done and with
the possibility of more stimulus needed there is an expectation
for a lot more cash that will be added to the system, and at
some point that means an inflation problem.”  Record Low  On Aug. 9, 10-year Treasury yields touched a record low as
the Fed vowed to keep  interest rates  near zero through at least
mid-2013. In pledging to keep its benchmark rate at an all-time
low, the Fed also discussed a range of policy tools to bolster
the economy, saying it is prepared to use them “as
appropriate.”  The statement fueled speculation the central bank may
consider a third round of quantitative easing through bond
purchases to revive a recovery it said is “considerably
slower” than anticipated.  The Treasury sold $32 billion of three-year notes at a
record low yield of 0.50 percent on Aug. 9 and sold $24 billion
of 10-year securities yesterday at a record low 2.14 percent
yield. The record low yield for a 30-year bond auction is 3.54
percent, reached in February 2009.  Bond Inflation  A bond market measure of inflation expectations the Fed
uses to help determine monetary policy was at 2.88 percentage
points, compared with 2.93 percentage points average for 2011.
The five-year, five-year forward break-even rate projects what
the pace of consumer price increases may be, beginning in 2016.
It averaged 2.78 percentage points during the past five years.  U.S. debt  dropped earlier, snapping a three-day surge, as
the Labor Department reported that claims for unemployment
insurance payments unexpectedly fell last week to a four-month
low, signaling the recent slowdown in payroll gains is due to a
lack of hiring, rather than more firings.  Applications for jobless benefits decreased 7,000 in the
week ended Aug. 6 to 395,000, the fewest since early April.
Economists forecast 405,000 claims, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  Real Yield  The 10-year real yield, which accounts for inflation,
dropped to negative 1.45 percent yesterday, approaching the
lowest since 2008.  Treasuries have surged this month, pushing 10-year yields
down about 50 basis points since the start of August, as the
European sovereign-debt crisis and a potential double-dip
recession in the U.S. sent the  Standard & Poor’s  500 Index down
about 9 percent.  Volatility in the Treasury market has picked up. Merrill
Lynch & Co.’s MOVE index, which measure price swings in
Treasuries based on prices of over-the-counter options maturing
in two to 30 years, has averaged 96.6 since the start of the
month, more than the 89.3 average since the start of the year.  Thirty-year bonds have returned 18 percent this year,
compared with a 7.1 percent return for Treasuries overall,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The bonds
have gained 10.8 percent this month, leading the 2.8 percent
gain in overall Treasuries, and are headed for the best month
since December 2008, according to Merrill Lynch Indexes.  To contact the reporters on this story:
