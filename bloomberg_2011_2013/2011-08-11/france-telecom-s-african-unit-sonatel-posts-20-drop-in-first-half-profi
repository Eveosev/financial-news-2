Sonatel (SNTS) , the Senegalese
telecommunications company that operates in four West African
nations, said first-half profit fell 20 percent as it paid more
tax and faced increased competition.  Net income for the  France Telecom SA (FTE)  unit declined to 75.4
billion  CFA francs  ($162 million) from 94.5 billion francs a
year earlier, the company said in a statement e-mailed by the
Abidjan-based Bourse Regionale des Valeurs Mobilieres. Revenue
increased 5.7 percent to 312 billion francs, Sonatel said.  The carrier’s share is up in Guinea and Guinea Bissau and
down in the “key markets of Senegal and Mali due to competitive
pressure,” the Dakar-based company said in the statement. Tax
charges rose to 34 billion francs, from 19 billion francs a year
earlier as its exempt status in  Mali  ended, Sonatel said.  Mobile-phone subscribers rose 31 percent to 12.8 million
while landline users increased 7 percent to 288,479, said
Sonatel, which is the biggest company listed on the regional
bourse with a  capitalization  of 1.4 trillion francs. France
Telecom controls 42 percent of the company, with the Senegalese
government, shareholders and employees holding the remainder.
President Abdoulaye Wade said he wants to increase Senegal’s
stake in the carrier, le Soleil reported today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
