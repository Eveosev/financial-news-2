Corn futures may open 20 cents to 25
cents a bushel higher in Chicago after the government said U.S.
production will be smaller than expected, reducing reserve
inventories, said  Mark Schultz , the chief analyst at Northstar
Commodity Investment Co. in Minneapolis.  Soybean futures may open 25 cents to 30 cents a bushel
higher on the Chicago Board of Trade after the government said
U.S. farmers will harvest a smaller crop this year, reducing
domestic and world inventories, Schultz said in a telephone
interview.  Wheat futures may open 8 cents to 10 cents a bushel higher
as demand for the grain in livestock feed climbs amid shrinking
corn production, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
