The rate at which European banks say
they see each other lending in euros for one week fell for a
third consecutive day, reaching the lowest level in five weeks,
according to the European Banking Federation.  The euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor, fell four
basis points to 1.182 percent today. That’s the lowest since
July 6, the EBF data show.  Three-month Euribor fell for the fifth day, dropping one
basis point to 1.535 percent. That’s the longest run of declines
since Feb. 18 and the lowest rate since June 28.  To contact the reporters on this story:
