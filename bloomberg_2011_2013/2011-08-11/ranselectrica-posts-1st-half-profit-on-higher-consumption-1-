Transelectrica SA (TEL) , the Romanian
power-grid operator, said it turned to profit in the first half
of the year, as the company cut costs and an industry-driven
economic recovery boosted electricity demand.  Transelectrica reported net income of 178.6 million lei
($59 million) in the first half compared with a loss of 58.1
million lei, the Bucharest-based company said in a filing to the
capital’s  stock exchange . Revenue rose 13 percent to 1.44
billion lei, while costs dropped 8.3 percent to 1.22 billion
lei.  The first-half “profit was mainly the result of additional
revenue stemming from higher electricity consumption, but also
from a diminished volume of expenses,” according to the
statement.  Romania’s economy exited a two-year recession in the first
quarter, helped by surging exports and industrial output, which
boosted electricity consumption by 5.6 percent in the first half
of the year and production by 11.4 percent compared with the
year-ago period, Transelectrica said. Electricity consumption
and production will continue to grow at the same pace in the
second half, it said.  Energy consumption will probably grow about 5 percent in
the second half compared with the same period of last year,
while production will probably increase about 10 percent in the
same period, Transelectrica said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
