Crude oil advanced as declining U.S.
jobless claims sent equities higher, adding to optimism that
 U.S. economy  is strengthening.  Futures climbed 3.4 percent after the Labor Department
reported that applications for jobless benefits decreased 7,000
to 395,000 last week, the fewest since early April. Equities in
the U.S. and Europe rebounded on the employment data. Crude
slipped 2.2 percent earlier on concern that  France ’s
creditworthiness was in doubt.  “Oil came off its lows once the jobless numbers came
out,” said  Addison Armstrong , director of market research at
Tradition Energy in Stamford,  Connecticut . “Worries about the
debt crisis and economy are being played out in equities and oil
is following.”  Crude oil for September delivery rose $2.83 to settle at
$85.72 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , extending a
two-day gain to 8.1 percent. The contract fell as low as $81.03
and reached $84.45. Oil is up 9.9 percent from a year earlier.  Brent oil for September settlement gained $1.34, or 1.3
percent, to end the session at $108.02 a barrel on the ICE
Futures Europe exchange in  London . The European benchmark’s
premium to U.S. futures, which reached an intraday record of
$25.54, fell to $22.30 from yesterday’s $23.79.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 4.9 percent to
1,175.39, and the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  advanced 459.66
points, or 4.3 percent, to 11,179.60.  All 10 groups in the  S&P 500  advanced, with gains being led
by financial, energy and technology companies. The index dropped
4.4 percent yesterday.  S&P 500  “We’re keeping an eye on the S&P, but we don’t fully trust
it after the recent erratic moves,” said  Tim Evans , an energy
analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New York. “A big day-to-
day change in prices is becoming the norm.”  Economists forecast 405,000 claims, according to the median
forecast of 48 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. The number
of people on unemployment benefit rolls and those getting
extended payments also dropped.  Federal Reserve policy makers this week announced they
would keep the benchmark lending rate near zero “at least”
through mid-2013 to spur economic growth.  French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor
Angela Merkel planned to meet next week as concern that the
euro-area debt crisis will spread rattled French markets. The
leaders of  Europe ’s two biggest economies will discuss economic
governance of the 17-nation euro region in Paris on Aug. 16,
according to separate statements issued today by Sarkozy and
Merkel’s offices.  OPEC’s Pricing Power  Prices in London may rise to $130 in the next year as the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries’ 12 members such
as Saudi Arabia curb output, Barclays Plc said.  “The big downside protection for oil, relative to most
other assets, is that OPEC can cut supply to restore the
balance,” Barclays analysts including New York-based Helima Croft said in a report. “With so little spare capacity, Saudi
Arabia is the world’s sole swing producer, giving it a level of
control not seen since the heights of OPEC in the 1970s.”  New York  oil climbed to $114.83 a barrel on May 2 as unrest
in the  Middle East  and North Africa toppled leaders in Tunisia
and Egypt and spread to Libya, Syria, Yemen and Bahrain. Libyan
output fell 50,000 barrels, or 33 percent, to 100,000 in July,
the lowest since at least 1962 based on yearly data, a Bloomberg
News survey showed.  U.S. Inventories  “I don’t think we’ve seen the absolute bottom, but I doubt
we’ll see the oil market test $75,” said Michael Lynch,
president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research in Winchester,
 Massachusetts . “The oil market is different from the global
economy, because of the geopolitical risk. The conflict in  Libya 
and the resulting disruption in supply are an example of what
makes this market unique.”  Oil rose 4.5 percent yesterday after an Energy Department
report showed U.S. crude stockpiles fell 5.23 million barrels to
349.8 million last week, the biggest drop since December.
Supplies at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for West Texas
Intermediate oil, the grade traded in New York, tumbled 1.37
million barrels to 34.6 million, the lowest since November.  Total fuel consumption climbed 3.3 percent to 20.3 million
barrels in the week ended Aug. 5, the highest level since
December, yesterday’s report showed.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 892,411
contracts as of 3:10 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 989,624
contracts yesterday, 44 percent above the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.58 million contracts, the
highest level since June 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
