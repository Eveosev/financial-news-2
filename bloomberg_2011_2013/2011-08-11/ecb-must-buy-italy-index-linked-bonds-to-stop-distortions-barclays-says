The  European Central Bank  hasn’t
bought Italian inflation-linked bonds under its asset-purchase
program, distorting the yield difference with conventional
securities that is has acquired, Barclays Plc said.  “By conducting only nominal bond purchases, the ECB is
creating distortions that push Italian breakevens lower,”
Khrishnamoorthy Sooben, a fixed-income strategist in London,
wrote in an investor report dated yesterday. “The exclusion of
linkers seems inconsistent with the stated aim of the program to
take account of dysfuctional market segments.  ‘‘This market has already been gradually losing the
sponsorship of many real money investors,’’ he wrote. The lack
of buying may impair the liquidity of the index-linked market
‘‘to a point at which issuance would be a significant
challenge,’’ he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
