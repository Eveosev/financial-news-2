Grainger Plc (GRI) , the U.K.’s largest
publicly traded residential landlord, said sales rose even with
the “ongoing challenges” in the residential market.  The company sold 531 homes for 94.3 million pounds ($153
million) in the 10 months ended July 31, compared with 593
properties for 90.1 million pounds a year earlier, Newcastle-
upon-Tyne-based Grainger said today in a statement.  “There is still concern about the general economic
environment and availability of mortgage finance,” Chief
Executive Officer Andrew Cunningham said in a telephone
interview today. Buyers aren’t going to enter into major
transactions, he added.  “Our portfolio is pretty resilient because our properties
tend to be below average value and are in more demand than
others.”  Cunningham said there is a “quite noticeable” divide
between north and south. “If there is any buoyancy in the
market, it’s in the south.”  Grainger owns more than 20,000 rental homes in the U.K. and
 Germany  valued at 2.4 billion pounds, according to its website.
It also manages 2.8 billion pounds in properties.  The Bank of England said last month that U.K. lenders
indicated there would be little change in mortgage approvals in
the next few months. Average  house prices  dropped in June for a
third month, according to data from LSL Property Services and
Acadametrics in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
