Orascom Telecom Holding SAE (ORTE) , North
Africaâ€™s biggest mobile networks operator, declined for the
fourth time in five days after reporting a second-quarter loss.  Shares fell 2.7 percent to 3.22 Egyptian pounds at the 1:30
p.m. close in Cairo, giving it a market value of 16.9 billion
pounds ($2.8 billion). The benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  retreated 1.5
percent.  The Cairo-based company said late yesterday it had a
second-quarter loss of $58.5 million without providing a
comparative figure for the year-earlier period. It had a loss of
$82.8 million in the second quarter of 2010, according to
Bloomberg data.  Orascom Telecom completed the sale of its 50 percent stake
in Orascom Telecom Tunisie, also known as Tunisiana, to  Qatar
Telecom  for $1.2 billion in January. The introduction of a
higher corporate tax rate in Egypt in the second quarter reduced
the gain realized from the sale by $58 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
