Oil fell in  New York , heading for a
third weekly decline, on concern that volatility in financial
markets will worsen an economic slowdown.  Futures slid as much as 1.7 percent today, ending a two-day
climb. Crude has traded from $75.71 a barrel, a 10-month low, to
as high as $85.97 in intraday trading this week. Reports today
may show manufacturing stalled in the euro region and Greece’s
economy shrank. Prices surged yesterday after applications for
U.S. unemployment benefits unexpectedly slid to the lowest in
four months.  “The biggest downside risk is that all this volatility
cripples confidence,” said  Ben Westmore , a minerals and energy
economist at National Australia Bank Ltd. in Melbourne, who
predicts oil in New York will average $98 a barrel in the third
quarter. “There are continued concerns around  Europe  and
sovereign debt and when you overlay that on weaker than expected
macro data, it can cause people to fear for the worst.”  Crude for September delivery fell as much as $1.49 to
$84.23 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . It was at $84.30 at 2:42 p.m. Singapore time.
Yesterday, the contract gained 3.4 percent to $85.72. Futures
have lost 3 percent this week and 7.8 percent in 2011.  Brent oil for September settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange dropped as much as $1.01, or 0.9 percent,
to $107.01 a barrel. The European benchmark contract was at a
premium of $22.73 to U.S. futures, down from a record close of
$23.79 on Aug. 10. The more actively traded October future was
down 51 cents at $107.31.  European Meeting  French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  and German Chancellor
Angela Merkel plan to meet next week after concern that the
euro-area debt crisis will spread rattled French markets. The
leaders of Europe’s two largest economies will discuss economic
governance of the 17-nation euro region in Paris on Aug. 16,
according to separate statements yesterday.  The euro extended a weekly drop against the dollar today
before reports forecast to show that industrial production in
Europe climbed 0.2 percent in May and Greece’s gross domestic
product declined 0.8 percent in the second quarter. A rising U.S.
currency tends to curb investor demand for commodities.  Regulators in  France ,  Spain ,  Italy  and Belgium will impose
bans on short-selling from today to stabilize equity markets
after European banks plunged. Asian stocks pared earlier gains.  Export Slump  The  U.S. trade deficit  unexpectedly rose 4.4 percent to
$53.1 billion in June from $50.8 billion in the prior month,
according to Commerce Department data yesterday. Exports slumped
2.3 percent, the most since January 2009, as overseas demand for
shipments of soybeans and plastics to industrial engines and
generators decreased.  Confidence among U.S. consumers dropped last week to the
lowest since May as high earners, homeowners and those working
full time turned more pessimistic, the Bloomberg Consumer
Comfort Index showed yesterday.  Crude climbed yesterday after the number of applications
for U.S. unemployment payments fell 7,000 in the week ended Aug.
6 to 395,000, the fewest since early April.  Oil in New York may gain next week as U.S. stockpiles
decline and fuel demand increases, according to a Bloomberg News
survey. Twelve of 29 analysts and traders, or 41 percent,
forecast crude will increase through Aug. 19. Last week, 51
percent of respondents predicted a decrease.  Prices may rebound as a “hammer” forms on the weekly
candlestick chart, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Futures rallied about 13 percent in the six weeks after a
similar technical pattern in May 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
