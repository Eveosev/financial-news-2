U.S. video-game retail sales fell 26
percent last month, led by lower demand for consoles such as
 Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ’s  Xbox 360 , researcher NPD Group said.  Retail-store sales of game hardware, software and
accessories from all makers fell 26 percent to $707.7 million,
the lowest level since October 2006, from $961.3 million a year
earlier, Port  Washington , New York-based NPD said in a statement
yesterday. Hardware sales declined 29 percent, and software
sales slipped 30 percent, the researcher said.  Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, posted a drop in
sales of Xbox 360 for the first time since December 2009. Sales
of the console, which was the top-selling video-game player in
July, plunged 37.6 percent to 277,000 units.  “This is more of a reflection of robust sales last July,
which was the biggest month for unit sales of the 360 in 2010
outside the holiday months November and December,”  Anita Frazier , an analyst at NPD, said in the statement.  Xbox sales in July last year were boosted after Microsoft
cut prices to clear old models for a redesigned console.  Consumers are increasing their spending to buy content in
other ways such as electronic purchases of full games, mobile
games and social-network gaming, Frazier said. “We have
measured some remarkable growth” in those areas, she said.  Sales of  Sony Corp. (6758) ’s motion-sensing Move peripheral for
the PlayStation 3 rose 18 percent from a year earlier, the
Tokyo-based company said in a statement, without citing figures
or overall hardware sales.  Nintendo Co.’s sales of DS and 3DS handheld players were
“about flat to last year,” NPD said, adding sales of all
hardware platforms dropped last month. The Kyoto, Japan-based
company cut prices of the 3DS by 32 percent to $169.99 in the
U.S., starting today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
