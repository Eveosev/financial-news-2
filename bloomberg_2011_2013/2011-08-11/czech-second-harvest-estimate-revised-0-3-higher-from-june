The Czech harvest of basic cereals
will probably be 0.3 percent higher than a previous estimate in
June, the Czech Statistics Office said.  The production of basic cereals is seen rising 6.4 percent
from the year-ago period, the Prague-based statistics office
said today in a statement on its website.  Rainy weather could still affect the quality of the
harvest, the office said, citing its estimate calculated as of
July 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
