Persian Gulf shares retreated,
sending Kuwait’s benchmark stock index to the lowest level in
almost seven years, amid concern  Europe  will fail to contain its
debt crisis, trimming investor appetite for riskier assets.  Combined Group Contracting Co. (CGC) , the Kuwaiti construction
company, lost 1.2 percent and lender  Al-Ahli Bank of Kuwait (ABK)  fell
for a second day this week. The Kuwait Stock Exchange Unweighted
Index dropped 0.9 percent to 5,850.60, the lowest close since
Aug. 25, 2004. The measure slumped 3.6 percent this week. The
 Bloomberg GCC 200 Index (BGCC200)  of the region’s stocks slipped 0.2
percent. Dubai’s  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  rose 0.2 percent after losing
as much as 1.4 percent earlier.  “Our markets are obviously following the volatility of
global markets,” Ahmed Talhaoui, the Abu Dhabi-based head of
investment at Royal Capital PJSC, said. “Local markets are
entirely at the mercy of the global  risk aversion .”  U.S. stocks tumbled yesterday, sending the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  to the lowest since September. The Dow Jones
Index fell 4.6 percent. The STOXX Europe 600 Price Index swung
between gains of as much as 2.7 percent and losses of up to 0.6
percent as concern over Europe debt crisis was tempered by
higher profits from the U.S. to Japan and Australia.  Abu Dhabi’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  dropped 0.5 percent and
Qatar’s  QE Index (DSM)  decreased 0.3 percent. Oman’s MSM 30 Index lost
0.8 percent.  “In addition to the global backdrop institutional
investors in particular see few domestic drivers,” said  Julian
Bruce , equity sales head at EFG-Hermes Holding SAE in Dubai.
“Recent earnings releases have been fairly moribund.”  Commercial Bank of Kuwait SAK (CBK)  on Aug. 3 said second-quarter
profit declined to 198,000 dinars ($726,000) from 2.3 million
dinars a year earlier. The stock retreated 2.3 percent to 850
fils when it last traded Aug. 9.  Combined Group Contracting fell the most since Aug. 9 to
1,660 fils. Ahli Bank decreased 1.5 percent, the most since Aug.
7, to 650 fils.  Saudi Arabia ’s market is closed for the weekend.  To contact the reporter on this story:
