Kenya  will ask the  Common Market  for
Eastern and Southern Africa for permission to keep taxing sugar
imports to protect domestic producers,  Business Daily  said,
citing Trade Ministry Permanent Secretary Abdulrazaq Ali.  Kenya charges a duty of 10 percent on imports of the
sweetener exceeding metric 340,000 tons that are bought from the
19-member Comesa trade bloc, the Nairobi-based newspaper
reported today, citing data from the organization.  Kenya will lobby for an extension to the agreement, due to
expire in March 2012, by writing letters and discussing the
proposal at the next Comesa meeting, the newspaper said, citing
Agriculture Ministry Permanent Secretary Romano Kiome.  Kenyaâ€™s sugar industry has production costs that are more
than twice the rate in Swaziland, Malawi and Zambia, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
