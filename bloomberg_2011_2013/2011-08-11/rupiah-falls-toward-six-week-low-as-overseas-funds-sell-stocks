Indonesia’s rupiah declined,
approaching its lowest level in six weeks, as concern  Europe ’s
debt crisis is spreading sparked further losses in stocks.
Benchmark bonds fell.  Overseas funds sold $269 million more Indonesian shares
than they bought in the last three days, exchange data show,
contributing to this week’s 1.4 percent drop in the  Jakarta
Composite Index (JCI)  of equities. The cost of insuring  France ’s
government debt from default rose to a record yesterday on
speculation the contagion in Europe will hit the region’s
second-biggest economy.  “The uncertainty about what’s happening in Europe is
causing investors to reduce their exposure to emerging-market
assets,” said Wiling Bolung, head of treasury at ANZ Panin Bank
in Jakarta.  The currency lost 0.2 percent to 8,548 per dollar as of
4:01 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It earlier fell as much as 0.4 percent to 8,564, near the six-
week low of 8,609 reached on Aug. 9.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of regional equities fell 0.4
percent, taking losses so far this week to 3 percent.  Foreign ownership  of Indonesian  government bonds  fell 2.6
percent to 243.19 trillion rupiah ($28 billion) in the first
three days of this week, according to the finance ministry’s
debt management office.  Ten-year benchmark bonds fell today. The yield on the 8.25
percent security due July 2021 climbed 2 basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 6.96 percent, according to closing prices
from the Inter Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
