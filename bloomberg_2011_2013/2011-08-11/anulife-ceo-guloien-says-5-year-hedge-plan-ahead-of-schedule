Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC) ,  Canada ’s
largest insurer, said it’s ahead of schedule on a five-year plan
to hedge most of the company’s equity risk.  Manulife, which is more sensitive to equity market
fluctuations than any other Canadian insurer, said in November
it plans to hedge 75 percent of equity risk by the end of 2014.  “We’re not likely to move it up or down until I have a
significant indication that circumstances have changed,” Chief
Executive Officer Donald Guloien said today in a telephone
interview. “I’m very comfortable with the progress, but it’s
too early to call it an absolute victory in terms of changing
that five-year plan.”  The owner of Boston-based John Hancock Financial reported
today that second-quarter profit was C$490 million ($493
million), or 26 cents a share, rebounding from a record loss of
C$2.4 billion, or C$1.39 a share, a year earlier. Results topped
analyst estimates, helped by Toronto-based Manulife’s
accelerated hedging, Guloien said.  Guloien, 54, told investors today that recent declines in
U.S. equity markets are a “gross overreaction.” Almost $3
trillion has been erased from U.S. equity values in the last
three weeks because of  Europe ’s debt crisis, signs the economy
is slowing, and S&P’s downgrade of the U.S. government’s AAA
credit rating.  The S&P downgrade “was essentially a non-event,” Guloien
said. “I think it was actually a positive thing in that it was
a wake-up call for the U.S. legislature. They’ve got to stop
their bickering and get on with business.”
