CME Group Inc. (CME) , the world’s largest
futures market, raised the margins on gold contracts by 22
percent after prices surged to a record on increased haven
demand amid a deepening rout in global equities.  The initial-margin requirement, or the minimum amount of
cash that speculators must keep on deposit, will rise to $7,425
per contract from $6,075 from the close of business today, CME
said in a  statement . The margin for hedging will also increase
22 percent, rising to $5,500 from $4,500, it said.  Gold futures on the CME’s Comex have rallied 26 percent
this year as the escalating debt crisis in  Europe , slowing
economic growth in the U.S. and accelerating inflation in  China 
boosted demand. The volume in Comex gold futures and options
surged to a record on Aug. 9, according to the exchange.  “There’s certainly a reasonably large volume on Comex and
it will add some downward pressure, but it won’t be sufficient
to prevent gold from remaining at elevated levels,” said Darren Heathcote, Sydney-based head of trading at Investec Bank
(Australia) Ltd.  The December-delivery contract, currently the most active,
gained as much as 1.9 percent to a $1,817.60 an ounce, and
traded at $1,786.40 at 11:21 a.m. London time. The immediate-
delivery price also rallied to an all-time high of $1,814.95
today, and was lastly down 0.5 percent at $1,783.73.  Dennis Gartman , the economist who correctly forecast the
slump in commodities in 2008, said he’s “surprised” that  gold
prices  haven’t declined more after CME Group Inc. raised the
margins on gold contracts.  Bull Trend  “This is long overdue and the CME is correct in having
done so,” Gartman said in his daily newsletter. “We are rather
surprised that gold has not sold off markedly on that news, and
we are left to conclude either that gold’s bull trend is truly
stronger than we might wish to believe or that the news has not
yet hit the markets and will have its effect later this morning
when the U.S. traders reach their desks.”  CME will raise the maintenance-margin requirement for gold
to $5,500 per contract from $4,500 for speculators and hedging
after the close of business today. One gold contract equals 100
troy ounces. Margins for so-called e-mini and e-micro gold
futures will also be increased.  The CME’s decision will boost the amount of cash investors
need as they expand their gold futures holdings amid the market
turmoil. Earlier this year, the CME announced five margin
increases for silver after prices jumped to a 31-year high of
$49.845 an ounce on April 25. In two weeks, it became 84 percent
more expensive for speculators to trade the metal, triggering an
exit by investors and sending silver down by the most since
1983.  Driven by Fear  “Silver was more of speculation at that time, but this
time it’s really driven by fear, that gold is where it is and
all the fundamental reasons for holding gold are still there,”
said Investec’s Heathcote. “It’s really difficult to see it
having much effect.”  CME joins the Shanghai Gold Exchange in hiking margins.
China’s largest physical gold market will boost the trade-margin
requirement to 11 percent from 10 percent for gold contracts
from settlement today, the bourse said on Aug. 8.  Margins will be raised to prevent risks, keep the market
stable and protect investors’ interests after the rapid increase
in prices, according to the Chinese bourse.  Immediate-delivery gold of 99.95 percent purity on the
Shanghai Gold Exchange, the benchmark cash contract, surged to a
record 373.20 yuan a gram ($1,814.90 an ounce) today, while
bullion of 99.99 percent purity touched 374.50 yuan a gram, its
highest ever.  Pushing Higher  “There are many other areas where gold is being bought,”
Heathcote said from Sydney. “The ETFs, pure spot, so it’s not
really going to prevent gold from pushing higher through another
new peak if the market gets spooked.” ETFs are the initials for
exchange-traded funds.  Gold holdings in exchange-traded products climbed to a
record 2,216.756 metric tons on Aug. 8, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Assets have expanded 5.4 percent this year and
were at 2,209.526 tons yesterday.  CME last boosted gold margins on Jan. 20, then decreased
them on June 20, according to  data  on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
