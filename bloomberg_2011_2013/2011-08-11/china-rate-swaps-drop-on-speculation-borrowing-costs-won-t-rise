China ’s interest-rate swaps fell to
their lowest level in almost two months on speculation the
central bank won’t raise borrowing costs this month.  The one-year contract declined for a third time this week
as the yuan rose, suggesting policy makers may prefer to fight
inflation by letting the currency appreciate. The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  slid to the lowest level since September 2010
yesterday as  Switzerland ’s central bank said it would
“significantly” increase the supply of cash to banks.  “There’s general  risk aversion  going on,” said Teck Wee Yeo, a local-markets strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc in Singapore. “Against this backdrop, people are not
expecting the People’s Bank of China to tighten in the near
term.”  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, declined 12
basis points to 3.60 percent as of 5:13 p.m. in  Shanghai ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The rate was the lowest
since June 13. It has declined 57 basis points, or 0.57
percentage point, this month.  The yuan rose 0.37 percent, the most since November, to
close at 6.3945 per dollar in Shanghai, according to the China
Foreign Exchange Trade System.  The seven-day repurchase rate, a measure of interbank
funding availability, dropped 1.3 basis points to 3.1047 percent,
according to the National Interbank Funding Center. The
authorities will inject a net 70 billion yuan ($10.9 billion)
this week to the financial system, according to Yeo.  The central bank has increased  interest rates  five times
since September and boosted major lenders’ reserve-requirement
ratios to a record 21.5 percent, policies that pushed the seven-
day repurchase rate to a three-year high of 9.2 percent on June
24. Consumer prices climbed 6.5 percent from a year earlier in
July, after increasing 6.4 percent the previous month, the
statistics bureau said on Aug. 9.  The yield on the 3.44 percent government bonds due June
2016 declined 4.5 basis points to 3.78 percent, the lowest level
since July 19, according to the Interbank Funding Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
