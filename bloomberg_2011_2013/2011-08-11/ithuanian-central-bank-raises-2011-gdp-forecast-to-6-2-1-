Lithuanian economic growth may
accelerate this year at a faster pace than previously estimated
on rebounding domestic demand and investments, the central bank
said.  Gross domestic product will probably expand 6.2 percent
this year, compared with a May estimate of 5.6 percent, the
Vilnius-based  Lietuvos Bankas  said today in an e-mailed
statement in its third increase in the outlook this year. It
kept its 2012 growth forecast unchanged at 4.8 percent.  Lithuanian economy, part of the Baltic region along with
 Estonia  and  Latvia  that suffered the world’s deepest recession
in 2009, is growing at the second-fastest rate in the European
Union after Estonia. Output grew a preliminary 6.1 percent in
the second quarter on year, driven by foreign demand for its
products and strengthening domestic consumption.  “It’s the first time in more than two years that
Lithuania’s real GDP is growing on recovering consumption and
investment,” Mindaugas Leika, the central bank’s chief-
economist, said in the statement.  The  Finance Ministry  estimates growth of 5.8 percent this
year.  The central bank also raised its inflation forecast for
this year to 4.4 percent from 3.8 percent and the 2012 outlook
to 4.1 percent from 3.9 percent.  The yield on  Lithuania ’s 10-year bonds rose 0.02 percentage
point to 5.18 today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
