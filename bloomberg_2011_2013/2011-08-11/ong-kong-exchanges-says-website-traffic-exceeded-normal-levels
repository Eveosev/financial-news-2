Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing
Ltd.’s website was disabled yesterday after traffic exceeded
normal levels, said Chairman Ronald Arculli.  The exchange is planning to review its entire technology
infrastructure, he told Bloomberg Television. The city’s bourse
yesterday suspended seven companies in afternoon trading,
including  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  and  Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. (293) ,
after its website was hacked.  “There was an awful lot of traffic coming into our
website,” Arculli said in an interview from Hong Kong. “Due to
the instability of it and because we were aware that companies
were making announcements, we really had no choice but to
suspend trading of those particular companies.”  The bourse joins companies from Sony Corp. to Citigroup Inc.
and Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. that have been targeted by hackers.
Hong Kong Exchanges said today that the website has resumed
operation.  Arculli also said the Hong Kong bourse is not in any talks
with other exchanges for a merger or acquisition.  To contact the reporters on this story:
