A temporary tie between the Swiss
franc and the euro to curb the Swiss currency’s gains would be
legal under the Swiss central bank’s mandate, Swiss National
Bank Deputy President Thomas Jordan was quoted as saying by
Tages-Anzeiger in an interview.  “Any temporary measures to influence the exchange rate are
permissible under our mandate as long as these are consistent
with long-term price stability,” Jordan said, responding to a
question whether a temporary linkage between the two currencies
would be allowed.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
