The cost of insuring corporate debt
surged to its highest in more than two years in  Europe  amid the
region’s deepening sovereign debt woes.  “The coming weeks are likely to be challenging for risk
assets,” said Shahzada Omar Saeed, the Zurich-based global head
of high-yield at Swisscanto Asset Management, which manages
about 1.2 billion euros ($1.7 billion) of assets.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of credit-default swaps
linked to 125 companies with investment-grade ratings surged 14
basis points to 163 basis points, the highest since April 2009,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. at 1:30 p.m. in  London . The
Markit iTraxx Crossover Index linked to 40 companies with mostly
high-yield ratings jumped 60 basis points to 678, the highest
since July 2009.  Corporate credit-default swap prices are rising amid
speculation the  European Central Bank ’s purchase of government
debt, while supporting the bonds themselves, is failing to
restore investor confidence in the ability of policy makers to
resolve the region’s deficit crisis.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to the senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers jumped 26 basis points to a record 257.  Contracts on  Portugal  climbed 26 basis points to 897 while
credit-default swap prices on Ireland rose 18.5 basis points to
805, according to CMA. Greek swaps jumped 17 basis points to
1750. The cost of insuring against an Italian default fell 5.5
basis points to 391 and Spanish swap prices declined 3 to 387.  Swaps on  Societe Generale (GLE)  SA’s senior debt rose 26 basis
points to 363 a day after Chief Executive Officer  Frederic Oudea 
denied “rumors” and asked the France’s market watchdog to
probe the bank’s stock moves.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
