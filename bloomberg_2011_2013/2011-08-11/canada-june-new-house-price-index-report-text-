The following is the text of
the new house price index report for June released by
 Statistics Canada .  The New Housing Price Index (NHPI) rose 0.3% in June,
following a 0.4% advance in May.  The metropolitan region of Toronto and Oshawa was the
top contributor to this rise and registered the largest
increase of the 21 metropolitan regions surveyed in June.  Between May and June, prices in Toronto and Oshawa
increased by 0.8% followed by Winnipeg (+0.7%).  In Toronto and Oshawa, the price increases were
primarily a result of good market conditions. Builders in
Winnipeg cited higher material costs as the main reason
for the price increase in that metropolitan region.  In June, prices remained unchanged in 10 of the 21
metropolitan regions surveyed.  The most significant monthly price decline was recorded
in Calgary (-0.3%), as some builders offered promotional
pricing to generate sales.  Year over year, the NHPI was up 2.1% in June following
a 1.9% increase in May. The main contributors to the
advance in June were the metropolitan regions of Toronto
and Oshawa as well as  Montreal .  The largest year-over-year price increase was in
Toronto and Oshawa (+4.7%) followed by Winnipeg (+4.4%).  Compared with June 2010, contractors' selling prices
were also higher in  St. John's  (+4.3%), Regina (+3.9%),
Kitchener-Cambridge-Waterloo (+3.6%) and Montreal (+3.4%).  Among the 21 metropolitan regions surveyed, 8 posted 12-
month price declines in June, led by Windsor (-4.3%) and
Victoria (-1.7%).  Note: The New Housing Price Index measures changes over
time in the selling prices of new residential houses
agreed upon between the contractor and the buyer at the
time of the signing of the contract. It is designed to
measure the changes in the selling prices of new houses
where detailed specifications pertaining to each house
remain the same between two consecutive periods. The
prices collected from builders and included in the index
are market selling prices less value added taxes, such as
the Federal Goods and Services Tax or the Harmonized Sales
Tax.  To contact the reporter on this story:
