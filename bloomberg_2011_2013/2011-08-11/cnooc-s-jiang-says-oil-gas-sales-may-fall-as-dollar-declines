Jiang Yongzhi, spokesman at  Cnooc
Ltd. (883) , China’s biggest offshore energy explorer, comments on the
impact of the dollar’s decline against the yuan, also known as
the renminbi.  The Chinese currency today strengthened beyond 6.4 per
dollar for the first time in 17 years, supported by the Federal
Reserve’s pledge to keep  interest rates  at a record low and
signs China will use foreign-exchange gains to rein in inflation.  Jiang, based in Beijing, made the comments in an e-mail.  On impact of falling dollar on Cnooc:  “On one hand, since benchmark oil and gas prices are
usually in U.S. dollars, our oil and gas sales may decrease due
to the depreciation of the  U.S. dollar  against the renminbi.  “On the other hand, the depreciation of the U.S. dollar
against the renminbi will also decrease our costs for imported
equipment and materials, most of which are denominated in U.S.
dollars.  “In addition, debt repayment by the company will decrease
since all of our debts are also denominated in U.S. dollars.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
