Two men charged with beating a San
Francisco Giants fan outside Dodger Stadium pleaded not guilty
in Los Angeles Superior Court.  Louie Sanchez, 29, and Marvin Norwood, 30, entered the
pleas yesterday during their arraignment on charges of mayhem
and assault and battery, Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the
Los Angeles County District Attorney’s office, said in a
telephone interview.  Bryan Stow, a 42-year-old paramedic, sustained brain
injuries in the March 31 beating. He has been hospitalized since
the attack on opening day between the rival Major League
Baseball teams.  Sanchez and Norwood are scheduled to appear for a
preliminary hearing Sept. 30, Gibbons said. The men, who were
arrested July 21, are being held on $500,000 bond each.  Deputy District Attorney Frank Santoro told the judge the
defendants had made admissions about the crime, according to the
 Associated Press .  “Making assertions and proving them are two different
things,” Gilbert Quinones, Sanchez’s attorney, told reporters,
according to AP. Quinones didn’t return a telephone call.  Stow, who was left paralyzed and comatose after the beating,
has been showing signs of recovery, his family said on the
victim’s  website .  In the most recent posting, the family said he lifted his
left leg and raised his left arm when asked.  “And the best part? Bonnie asked Bryan if she could have a
kiss and every time she asked him, he puckered his lips,” the
family wrote about his interaction with his sister.  To contact the reporter on this story:
