Swiss stocks soared the most since
2008, rebounding from a two-year low, amid speculation recent
losses have been overdone and as  Zurich Financial Services AG (ZURN) 
reported earnings that topped analysts’ estimates.  Zurich Financial, Switzerland’s largest insurer, rallied 10
percent.  UBS AG (UBSN)  and  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , Switzerland’s
biggest lenders, gained more than 7 percent.  Swisscom AG (SCMN) , the
nation’s largest phone company, dropped 0.9 percent.  The  Swiss Market Index (SMI) , a measure of the biggest and most
actively traded companies, advanced 5 percent to 5,032.75 at the
5:30 p.m. close in Zurich, having earlier dropped 1.7 percent.
That’s the biggest gain since December 2008. The gauge entered a
bear market on Aug. 4 and has still plummeted 25 percent from
its high this year on Feb. 18 as  Europe ’s debt crisis and the
slowing global economy prompted investors to buy the Swiss
franc, reducing the value of exporters’ revenue. The broader
Swiss Performance Index added 4.6 percent today.  “While markets are extremely oversold at the moment, I
expect a short-term relief rally,” said Joachim Klement, chief
investment officer at Wellershoff & Partners Ltd. in Zurich.
“Overall, I think we haven’t seen a bottom in this market yet
and continue to expect high volatility.”  A rout in global equity markets since July 26 erased $7.9
trillion in share prices and dragged valuations on the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index to near the cheapest levels in about two and
a half years. Central bankers are trying to restore investor
confidence, with the  Federal Reserve  pledging to keep  interest
rates  near zero through at least mid-2013 to bolster U.S. growth
and the European Central Bank buying bonds to stem a contagion
that’s threatening to spread to France.  Franc-Euro Peg  Swiss central bank Vice President Thomas Jordan said it
would be legal to peg the franc to the euro for a limited period
to help counter currency gains.  “Any temporary measures to influence the  exchange rate  are
permissible under our mandate as long as these are consistent
with long-term  price stability ,” Jordan said in an interview
with Tages-Anzeiger newspaper that was published today. SNB
spokesman Walter Meier confirmed the remarks.  Zurich Financial climbed 10 percent to 160.10 Swiss francs,
its biggest gain since March 2009, as the company said second-
quarter profit surged 88 percent following the sale of a stake
in New China Life Insurance Co. Net income increased to $1.33
billion from $707 million a year earlier, beating analysts’
estimates of $1.04 billion.  UBS, Credit Suisse  UBS rallied 10 percent to 11.04 francs and Credit Suisse
gained 7.7 percent to 22.61 francs.  Dufry AG, the operator of duty-free shops, climbed 4.9
percent to 79 francs, the most since May, after saying first-
half net income was 46.2 million francs, compared with 40.4
million francs a year ago.  Swisscom slipped 0.9 percent to 342.80 francs after cutting
its full-year sales forecast as the weaker euro against the
franc sapped revenue at  Fastweb SpA (FWB) , its Italian division. Net
revenue will be 11.5 billion francs ($15.8 billion), compared
with a previous forecast of at least 11.8 billion francs. First-
half sales fell 3.8 percent to 5.72 billion francs, missing the
5.77 billion-franc average by analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
