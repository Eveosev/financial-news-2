A group of former fighters in
 Liberia  pledged to support President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf’s bid for re-election in October, said Austen
Clarke, head of the Nimba Citizens United for Progress.  “She has done well,” Clarke, who was deputy defense
minister under ex-President  Charles Taylor , told reporters
in Monrovia, the capital, yesterday. He cited developments
in living standards and freedom of expression in the West
African nation that is recovering from civil wars between
1989 and 2003.  Clarke said his group comprises about 80 percent of
the country’s so-called Special Forces generals who led
various factions during the years of conflict. The leaders
have influence over as many as 100,000 former fighters.  Johnson Sirleaf, 72, was elected as  Africa ’s first
female president in 2005. She pledged that the vote would
be “credible, transparent, free and fair,” in a speech  on
July 26  to mark the country’s 164th anniversary.  To contact the reporter on this story:
