Etablissements Maurel & Prom SA, the
Paris-based energy company with assets in  Africa , rose the most
in more than two years after sales doubled in the first half.  Maurel climbed as much as 8.6 percent, the steepest
intraday gain since May 2009, and traded at 12.27 euros as of
9:27 a.m. in Paris.  The company said yesterday that sales rose to 292.5 million
euros ($417 million) from the year-earlier period as production
surged at the Onal field in Gabon.  Maurel’s share of total production rose to 20,323 barrels
of oil equivalent a day in the first half as Brent crude prices
increased 44 percent.  Oil India Ltd. (OINL) , the nation’s second-biggest state-run oil
producer, is in talks to buy a stake in the Gabon fields worth
about $1.5 billion, people familiar with the discussions said
last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
