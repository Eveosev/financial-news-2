The FTSE/JSE  Africa  All Share Index

Johannesburg.  The following were among the most active stocks in the

up 9 percent of the benchmark  stock index , increased for the
first day in 11, rising 6.97 rand, or 2.6 percent, to 279 rand.
Copper rose the most since March after claims for unemployment-
insurance payments unexpectedly fell in the U.S., tempering
concern that the economy is faltering.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  , the world’s biggest mining
group, rallied for a second day, adding 10.31 rand, or 4.7
percent, to 229 rand.  Basil Read Holdings Ltd. (BSR)  , a construction company,
fell the most since March 2009, dropping 78 cents, or 6.1
percent, to 12.02 rand. The company said it expects to report
that earnings per share for the six months to June 30 declined
by 20 percent to 30 percent from a year earlier.  Cipla Medpro South Africa Ltd. (CMP)  , a generic-drug
manufacturer, rose for the first time in more than two weeks,
gaining 26 cents, or 4.5 percent, to 6 rand. The company expects
earnings per share for the six months to June 30 to be 68
percent to 75 percent higher than the same period a year ago.  Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI)  , Africa’s second-biggest gold
producer, rose to its highest in more than three months,
advancing 5.50 rand, or 4.9 percent, to 118 rand. The group said

previous three months.  Naspers Ltd. (NPN)  , Africa’s largest media company, rose
the most since May 2009, gaining 26.41 rand, or 8.2 percent, to
349.01 rand. The company’s 14-day relative strength index, which
shows how rapidly prices advanced or dropped during a specified
time period, was 29.5 yesterday, the lowest since July 2010. A
reading of 30 or below signals to some investors that shares are
set to increase.  To contact the reporters on this story: Stephen Gunnion in
