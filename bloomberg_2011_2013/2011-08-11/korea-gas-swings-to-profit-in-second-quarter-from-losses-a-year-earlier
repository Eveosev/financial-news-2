Korea Gas Corp. (036460) , the world’s biggest
importer of liquefied natural gas, swung to a profit in the
second quarter, beating analysts’ estimates, after increased
power demand spurred fuel sales and the government raised prices.  Net income was 29.1 billion won ($27 million) in the three
months ended June 30, compared with a 10 billion-won loss a year
earlier, the Seongnam, South Korea-based company said in a
regulatory  filing  today. That compares with the average profit
estimate of 17.4 billion won in a survey of eight analysts
compiled by Bloomberg.  Gas sales for power generation rose 22.5 percent in June
from a year earlier, faster than a 10.6 percent gain in sales to
households and small factories, Korea Gas said on July 11. Sales
increased about 10 percent by volume in the second quarter,
according to a statement on the company’s website.  “The rise in sales volume is the main contributor to the
better-than-expected profit,” said Yang Ji Hwan, an analyst at
Daishin Securities Co. in  Seoul . “Demand for power generation
led to demand for the fuel,” said Yang, who has a “buy”
recommendation on the stock.  Second-quarter sales gained 22 percent to 5.81 trillion won,
helped by higher prices. The government allowed the utility to
raise gas prices by an average 4.8 percent during the May-to-
June period. The state controls utility prices to curb inflation.  Korea Gas has declined 41 percent this year in Seoul
trading, while the benchmark Kospi stock index lost 11 percent.
The stock fell 0.5 percent to close at 28,650 won, after the
earnings announcement.  The stock is rated a “buy” by 17 of 25 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg. Six recommend holding the shares.  To contact the reporters on this story:
