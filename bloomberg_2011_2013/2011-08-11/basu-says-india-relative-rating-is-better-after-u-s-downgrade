Kaushik Basu , chief economic adviser
to  India ’s finance ministry, comments after  Standard & Poor’s  on
Aug. 5 lowered U.S. debt rating by a level to AA+ from AAA. Basu
was speaking in Mumbai today.  “It’s a big global worry but you should understand a lot
of it was already priced into the markets. What S&P said, we all
knew for quite some time. It’s the signal that matters and it’s
the consequence that is of some concern.  “You have to keep in mind that as a consequence, India’s
relative ratings go up. In the medium- to the long-term, India’s
prospects are really unaffected by this incident. If we can
strengthen our economy, we could provide some safe haven, which
global capital is bound to look for.  “Fiscal consolidation is always a tough process. We are
very serious about the targets we have set for ourselves in
terms of the fiscal and revenue deficit, and in terms of the
borrowings by the government from the markets to create space
for private borrowers. I am not going to describe them as easy.
I don’t think there’s any special concern about meeting our
targets.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
