KfW Entwicklungsbank, the German
state development bank, agreed to loan 250 million euros ($356
million) to build  India ’s biggest solar park.  The bank, based in Frankfurt, will help fund the 125-
megawatt Shivajinagar Sakri plant with a loan to  Maharashtra
State Power Generation Co. , KfW said in a  statement . The park,
which can be expanded to 150 megawatts, powering the homes of
400,000 people, will cost as much as 370 million euros, it said.  That would equal the capacity from all 30 plants approved
in India’s first national auction of photovoltaic projects in
December. The country aims to achieve 20,000 megawatts of solar
capacity by 2022 as it seeks to curb  carbon emissions  while
satisfying surging demand for energy.  The “reduced-interest” loan, the terms of which weren’t
disclosed, is KfW’s largest for a solar project, Wolfram
Schweickhardt, a spokesman for the bank, said by phone. The loan
was provided on behalf of  Germany ’s Ministry for Economic
Cooperation and Development. Maharashtra State Power, the
utility that will develop and own the project, will contribute
about 120 million euros.  India operated 82 megawatts of photovoltaic capacity by the
end of 2010, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance figures.
The world’s largest installation is the 92-megawatt Sarnia plant
in Canada and the biggest announced is the 750-megawatt Calico
project in  California , the data show.  Lenders including the  Asian Development Bank  have also
supported India’s solar ambitions, with the Manila-based
institution saying in December it would partially guarantee
loans for solar projects worth as much as $425 million.  To contact the reporters responsible for this story:
