Brazilian phone operator
 Telecomunicacoes de Sao Paulo SA (TLPP3)  and homebuilder MRV Engenharia
& Participacoes SA said they plan to buy back shares after
concern the global economy is sinking into recession sparked the
biggest selloff since the 2008 financial crisis.  They join at least three other Brazilian companies in
announcing buybacks in the past two weeks, for a total of as
much as 388.1 million reais ($237.8 million), data compiled by
Bloomberg and Sao Paulo-based brokerage Link Investimentos show.
In the U.S., more executives at Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
companies are buying their stock than at any time since March
2009. MRV’s move is a “positive market signal,” analysts at
JPMorgan Chase & Co. said in a note to clients.  After $6.8 trillion was erased from global market value
this month, with  Brazil  accounting for $245.3 billion of the
total, valuations in  Latin America ’s largest equity market fell
to the lowest in 2 1/2 years. The benchmark Bovespa index
plunged 17 percent in the five days through Aug. 8, driving its
price down to 8 times estimated earnings, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  “It’s a great sign because if the company thinks the stock
is cheap, it’s going to know better than anyone,” said Otavio Vieira, who helps manage 1.5 billion reais ($922 million) at
Safdie Private Banking in  Sao Paulo .  Bear Market  The Bovespa rose 2.1 percent to 52,490.68 at 10:54 a.m. New
York time today, trimming its drop this week to less than 1
percent. Brazil’s benchmark equity gauge entered a  bear market 
July 27 after falling 20 percent from its November 2010 peak on
concern quickening inflation and slowing global growth will hurt
corporate earnings.  Further declines may still come as investors assess the
impact of  Europe ’s debt crisis on global growth, said Allan Hadid, who helps oversee about 4 billion reais as chief
executive officer of BRZ Investimentos.  “Is 50,000 the bottom for the Bovespa?” Hadid said in an
interview in Sao Paulo yesterday. “Nobody knows. It’s cheap --
could it be cheaper? Yes.”  Telesp, Telefonica SA’s Brazil unit, said in a filing today
it plans to buy as many as 2.7 million preferred shares through
Oct. 20, valued at 120.7 million reais at yesterday’s closing
price. MRV, Brazil’s fifth-largest real-estate company by sales,
said it plans to buy as many as 10 million common shares during
the next year, valued at 110.3 million reais, according to a
filing last night.  Insider Buys  Sixty-six insiders at 50 companies on the  S&P 500  bought
shares between Aug. 3 and Aug. 9, the most since the five days
ended March 9, 2009, when the benchmark index for U.S. equities
reached a 12-year low, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Eduardo Guardia, chief financial officer of  BM&FBovespa SA (BVMF3) ,
told reporters in Sao Paulo yesterday that the exchange plans to
purchase as many as 23.5 million shares by the end of the year
after having completed 22 percent of a 30 million-share buyback
announced in June.  Marcopolo SA (POMO4) , Brazil’s biggest bus maker, said Aug. 8 it
would buy stock valued at 20.8 million reais at that day’s
closing price over the next 120 days. Real-estate company Cyrela
Commercial Properties SA Empreendimentos & Participacoes said
Aug. 4 it would buy back as much as 75 million reais of shares
within a year.  Bradespar SA (BRAP3) , a holding company that owns a stake
in miner Vale SA, said July 27 it will purchase common and
preferred shares valued at as much as 61.3 million reais at that
day’s closing price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
