The zloty strengthened against the
euro after four days of declines, rebounding from its weakest
level in 15 months, as European stock markets advanced.  The Polish currency appreciated 0.6 percent to 4.1636 per
euro as of 11:22 a.m. in Warsaw after earlier tumbling to
4.2426, its lowest since May 2010. Against the Swiss franc, the
zloty jumped 2 percent to 3.9593, rebounding from a record low.  “Today’s gains on European equity markets may have helped
the zloty, but this impact may be rather temporary as sentiment
in general is gloomy and  risk aversion  is high,”  Maja Goettig ,
chief economist at Bank BPH SA in Warsaw, said in a phone
interview.  The Stoxx 600 Index of European stocks rallied as much as
2.7 percent to 229.53 today, advancing from its lowest level
since July 2009. Poland’s WIG20 Index fluctuated between gains
and losses, trading 0.1 percent lower at 2,195.96 at 11:05 a.m.
in Warsaw.  The Polish currency slumped earlier this week and Warsaw’s
benchmark stock index closed at the lowest level since February
2010 yesterday amid speculation  Europe ’s debt crisis is
spreading and the U.S. economic recovery is stalling.  To contact the reporters on this story:
