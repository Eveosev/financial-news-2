Ghana’s cedi headed for the weakest
close in six months against the dollar as companies sought to
buy the U.S. currency to pay for imports  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
depreciated for a third day, slipping as much as 0.3 percent to
1.5386 per dollar and traded at 1.5344 by 2:05 p.m. in Accra,
the capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A close at
this level will be the weakest since Feb. 7.  “The cedi weakened a bit today amid dollar buying from
domestic corporates, including manufacturers, traders and
banks,” Kobla Nyaletey, a currency trader at the local unit of
Barclays Bank Plc, said in a telephone interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
