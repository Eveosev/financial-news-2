China shouldn’t stop buying  U.S.
debt  following  Standard & Poor’s  downgrading of the U.S. credit
rating, Yi Xianrong, researcher with the Institute of Finance
and Banking under the  Chinese Academy of Social Sciences , wrote
in a commentary in the  China Daily .  China would have had lower rates of return on its foreign
reserves if the country had invested in bonds issued by other
countries or resources-based commodities, Yi wrote in the
newspaper.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
