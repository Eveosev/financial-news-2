India ’s 10-year bonds declined,
snapping a seven-day advance, as the government reported the
fastest food inflation in three months.  Yields on most-traded government debt due 2021 climbed from
a three-month low after the commerce ministry said that an index
measuring wholesale prices of farm products including rice,
wheat and lentils rose 9.9 percent in the week ended July 30.
Bonds also fell on speculation the lowest yields since May will
deter investors, said Roy Paul, a deputy general manager at
Federal Bank Ltd.  “The rise in food prices means the last word on inflation
hasn’t been said yet despite the global financial turmoil,” he
said. “Bonds were also probably overvalued.”  The yield on the 7.8 percent notes due April 2021 rose two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.21 percent at the 5
p.m. close in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. It fell to 8.19 percent yesterday, the lowest level
since May 6.  The 10-year bond yield has dropped 25 basis points this
month on concern the debt crises in  Europe  and the U.S. will
stall the recovery in the global economy, spurring India’s
central bank to halt interest-rate increases.  The  Reserve Bank  of India has boosted borrowing costs 11
times since the start of 2010 to damp inflation. The repurchase
rate was last raised by 50 basis points to 8 percent on July 26.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
rose three basis points to 7.53 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
