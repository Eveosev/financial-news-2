An International Monetary Fund
mission will visit Ukraine to review government policies at the
end of August as the former Soviet republic seeks the next
installment of a $15.6 billion bailout.  “An IMF mission headed by Mr. Thanos Arvanitis will visit
Ukraine Aug. 29 to Sept. 9 to continue discussions,” Max Alier,
head of the Washington-based lender’s Ukraine office, said today
in an e-mailed statement.  Ukraine was granted its second IMF bailout in three years
last July after the global recession cut demand for its exports,
including steel, and the  budget deficit  swelled. So far, it has
received two payments totaling $3.4 billion. A third, expected
in March, was delayed after the government failed to raise the
retirement age and increase household energy prices to help
balance the budget, conditions set by the lender.  Having approved a pension overhaul in July, Ukraine “hopes
to find understanding on gas prices,” Iryna Akimova, first
deputy head of the president’s staff, told a news conference in
Kiev today. The  IMF  may release $3 billion by the end of
September, Deputy Prime Minister  Serhiy Tigipko  said June 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
