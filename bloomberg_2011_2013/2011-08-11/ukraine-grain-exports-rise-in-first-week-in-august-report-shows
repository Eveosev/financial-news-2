Ukraine’s grain exports rose almost
fourfold in the first week in August from the same period a
month earlier, researcher UkrAgroConsult said.  Shipments jumped to 163,000 metric tons for Aug. 1-7 from
42,000 tons in July 1-7, the Kiev-based researcher said in an e-
mailed statement today, citing information from the country’s
ports. Grain exports in July included 96,800 tons of barley sent
mainly to  Saudi Arabia  and  Israel , according to the statement.
Wheat shipments were 66,400 tons to the European Union and
Lebanon.  Another 328,000 tons of grain, including 38,000 tons of
wheat, and 284,000 tons of barley and 5,000 tons of corn, are
due to be shipped, according to UkrAgroConsult.  Ukraine has harvested 22.4 million tons of wheat in bunker
weight, and almost 9.3 million tons of barley as of Aug. 10, the
researcher said. The country also reaped about 1.3 million tons
of rapeseed as of Aug. 8, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
