The following is the text of
 Canada 's international merchandise trade report for June
from Statistics Canada.  Canada's merchandise exports fell 1.7% in June while
imports decreased 0.2%. As a result, Canada's trade
deficit with the world widened from $1.0 billion in May to
$1.6 billion in June.  Exports fell to $36.5 billion, largely the result of
declines in energy products and automotive products.
Volumes, which decreased 2.2%, were down in five out of
seven sectors. Prices increased 0.5% and were up in all
sectors except energy products.  Merchandise imports declined to $38.0 billion, led by
energy products. Overall, prices fell 2.1% and volumes
increased 1.9%.  Exports to the United States declined 2.4% to $26.5
billion in June, while imports fell 2.3% to $22.8 billion.
Canada's trade surplus with the  United States  went from
$3.7 billion in May to $3.6 billion in June.  Imports from countries other than the United States
increased 3.1% to a record high of $15.2 billion. Exports
to countries other than the United States edged up 0.3% to
$10.0 billion. Canada's trade deficit with countries other
than the United States widened from $4.8 billion in May to
a record $5.2 billion in June.  Exports: Declines in energy products and automotive
products  Exports of energy products declined 5.1% to $8.7
billion in June, the result of lower volumes and prices.
The main contributors to this decrease were petroleum and
coal products as well as crude petroleum.  Exports of automotive products fell 5.3% to $4.5
billion, largely the result of a 6.8% decline in passenger
autos and chassis. The latter decrease was due to a 7.7%
drop in volume in passenger autos and chassis.  Exports of agricultural and fishing products declined
2.3% to $3.2 billion in June. The decline was led by lower
exports of other cereals unmilled, such as corn to Spain
and  Egypt , and canola to  Japan .  Industrial goods and materials exports increased 0.9%
to $9.5 billion in June, on the strength of metals and
alloys, and chemicals, plastics and fertilizers. These
increases were partially offset by a decline in exports of
metal ores, mainly nickel ores, concentrates and scrap.  Imports: Energy products main factor in decline  Imports of energy products declined 11.7% to $4.2
billion in June. Volumes were down 6.1% while prices fell
6.0%. Crude petroleum imports fell 22.1%, largely because
of timing of shipment and plant shutdowns for maintenance.  Imports of industrial goods and materials declined 0.5%
to $8.2 billion in June. Imports of chemicals and plastics
fell 2.6% while other industrial goods and materials
declined 1.2%. Partially offsetting this decline was an
increase in metals and metal ores, which reached a record
high of $3.5 billion.  Imports of machinery and equipment increased for a
fourth consecutive month, rising 2.5% to $10.6 billion in
June. Leading this gain was industrial and agricultural
machinery, in particular drilling and mining machinery.  Imports of other  consumer goods  increased 2.1% to $5.0
billion; the main contributor was apparel and footwear.  Note to readers  Merchandise trade is one component of Canada's
international balance of payments (BOP), which also
includes trade in services, investment income, current
transfers as well as capital and financial flows.  International merchandise trade data by country are
available on both a BOP and a customs basis for the United
States, Japan and the  United Kingdom . Trade data for all
other individual countries are available on a customs
basis only. BOP data are derived from customs data by
making adjustments for factors such as valuation,
coverage, timing and residency. These adjustments are made
to conform to the concepts and definitions of the Canadian
System of National Accounts.  Data in this release are on a balance of payments
basis, seasonally adjusted in current dollars. Constant
dollars are calculated using the Laspeyres volume formula.  New aggregation structure  Statistics Canada  will introduce a new aggregation
structure, the North American Product Classification
System (NAPCS), to organize and present import and export
statistics in various programs. The new structure will
replace the classification structures known as the summary
import groups (SIG) and the summary export groups (SEG)
and the higher level aggregations; Major Groups,
Subsectors, Sectors and Sections that have been in use for
several decades. The first release of data using the new
structure will be on June 8, 2012 for the April reference
month.  Readers interested in this upcoming change can find
more detailed information on our website page dedicated to
classification consultation and notification.  To contact the reporter on this story:
