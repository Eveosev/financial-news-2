Egypt  fell short of meeting its
fund-raising goal at a treasury bill sale for the first time
since June as the yield on one-year securities rose.  The country sold 2.33 billion pounds in one-year bills at
an average yield of 12.979 percent, up 4 basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, from the sale of similar-maturity notes last
week, according to data posted on the  Finance Ministry  website.
The ministry was seeking 3.5 billion pounds. It met its target
of raising 1 billion pounds from six-month notes as the average
yield dropped five basis points to 12.475 percent.  “The  Finance Ministry  has already sent a message to the
market that it will not pay 13 percent for one-year bills,”
said Nasser Abouelseoud, head of fixed income at Cairo-based
Bank of Alexandria. “With inflation and  interest rates  expected
to remain stable for the rest of the year, the ministry’s
position is unlikely to change.”  The ministry canceled an auction of six-month and one-year
bills on June 30 after the one-year yield rose to 12.982
percent, a 31-month high. Egypt plans to sell two-year and
three-year bonds with a combined value of 5 billion pounds on
Aug. 15. The country resumed bond sales this quarter after
canceling auctions worth 19.5 billion pounds since the start of
an uprising in January that toppled President  Hosni Mubarak .  The nation raised 3 billion pounds from the sale of three-
year bonds on Aug. 1, paying a fixed coupon of 13.35 percent.
That compares with a coupon of 13.1 percent on two-year bonds it
sold a week earlier.  The average yield on six-month notes dropped this week
because the amount offered was lower than the 2.5 billion pounds
usually sought by the government, Abouelseoud said.  Egypt’s 5.75 percent 10-year dollar bond due April 2020
fell, pushing the yield up 8 basis points, or 0.08 percentage
point, to 5.62 percent at 2:04 p.m. in Cairo. The pound lost
less than 0.1 percent to 5.9599 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
