As many as 52 ships are waiting to
load sugar at  Brazil ’s ports in the Center South, the country’s
main producing region, four fewer than a week earlier, according
to Williams Servicos Maritimos Ltda.  The vessels at the ports of Santos and Paranagua will load
about 1.62 million metric tons of sugar, the shipping agent
said, citing data compiled yesterday. On Aug. 3, 56 vessels were
waiting to load about 1.69 million tons.  Sugar output in Brazil’s Center South, the country’s main
producing region, will drop for the first time in six years to
32.4 million tons, industry group Unica said July 13. It is
scheduled to issue new estimates at 2 p.m. in  Sao Paulo .  To contact the reporter on this story:
