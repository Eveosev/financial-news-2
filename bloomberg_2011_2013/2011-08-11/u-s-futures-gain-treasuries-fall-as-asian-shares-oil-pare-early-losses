U.S. equity-index futures rallied,
signaling stocks may rebound from near the lowest levels in
about a year, while Treasuries fell for the first time in four
days and metals gained. Asian stocks and oil pared losses.  Standard & Poor’s 500 futures jumped 1.4 percent as of
11:31 a.m. in  Tokyo , following the index’s 4.4 percent slump
yesterday. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index slid 0.7 percent, paring
a loss of as much as 2.4 percent. Treasury 10-year notes yields
added seven basis points to 2.18 percent, while the dollar fell
against 12 of its 17 major peers. China’s yuan jumped the most
since November. Copper snapped a six-day slump, oil slid 0.2
percent in  New York , while gold retreated from a record.  Central bankers are trying to restore investor confidence,
with the  Federal Reserve  pledging to keep interest rates near
zero through at least mid-2013 and the  European Central Bank 
intervening in bond markets. The rout that has erased $7.9
trillion in global equity values since July 26 resumed yesterday
even as all three major rating companies affirmed  France ’s top
credit grade amid speculation Europe’s debt crisis will spread
to the region’s second-biggest economy.  Stocks have “been oversold and valuations are looking
better,” said Lee King Fuei, a Singapore-based fund manager at
Schroders Plc, which oversaw $323 billion as of March 31.
