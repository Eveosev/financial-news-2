Nakumatt Holdings Ltd. , a Kenyan-
based supermarket chain with 33 outlets, said it wants to sell
almost half of its equity to investors to help fund regional
expansion, Reuters reported, citing managing director Atul Shah.  The first sale for a 15 percent to 18 percent stake may
raise $50 million, followed by a second offering aimed at
foreign investors for 25 percent to 30 percent ownership, the
 news agency  reported. The company, which also has branches in
Uganda and  Rwanda , aims to open its first stores in Tanzania,
South Sudan and Burundi by the end of 2012, it said.  Nakumattâ€™s revenue is expected to increase by about a third
to 40 billion shillings ($427 million) in the 12 months through
February 2012, Reuters cited Shah as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
