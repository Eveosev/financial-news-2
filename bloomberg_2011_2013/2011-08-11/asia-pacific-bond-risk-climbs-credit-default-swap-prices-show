The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default jumped, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index rose 13.5 basis points to
153 basis points as of 10:06 a.m. in Sydney, Credit Agricole CIB
prices show. That is the highest level since Aug. 20, 2009 and
puts the index on course for the biggest daily increase since
May 19, 2010, according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc.
and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  climbed 10 basis points to 151 basis
points as of 8:06 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Credit Agricole prices
show. That’s headed for its highest level since May 26, 2010,
according to CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index added 5 basis points to 135
basis points as of 9:05 a.m. in Tokyo, Deutsche Bank AG prices
show. Five-year swaps on Japan’s sovereign debt rose 4 to 105.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporters on this story:
