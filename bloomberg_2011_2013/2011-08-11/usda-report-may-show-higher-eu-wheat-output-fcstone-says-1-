Wheat output in  Europe  may be
forecast higher than last month in a U.S. government report on
better-than-expected yields in France, researcher and brokerage
FCStone Europe said.  The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  will release its monthly
supply and demand report at 8:30 a.m. in  Washington . The USDA
last month forecast EU wheat production at 132.1 million metric
tons. Global stockpiles, forecast last month at 182.2 million
tons, will be “relatively comfortable,” Dublin-based analyst
Jaime Nolan Miralles wrote in a report today.  French farmers will collect 33.3 million tons of soft wheat
this year, according to an outlook from FranceAgriMer and crop
researchers Arvalis and Cetiom. That’s higher than a government
forecast for 32.5 million tons, and compares with 2010 output of
35.7 million tons. Rain in June boosted crops after a drought
that led to water-use restrictions in two-thirds of  France .  “In wheat, we can expect to probably see some adjustments
to European production estimates to take into account recent
better-than-expected yields and output in France and several
other origins,” Miralles wrote. France is the world’s second-
largest exporter of wheat behind the U.S., followed by Australia
and  Canada . Canadian production also will be monitored
“closely” for adjustments higher based on domestic data,
according to the report.  Wheat futures for November delivery on NYSE Liffe in Paris
gained 2 euros, or 1 percent, to 195.50 euros ($278.76) a metric
ton by 10:06 a.m. local time, the second straight increase.
Wheat on the Chicago Board of Trade, the world benchmark, jumped
5.75 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $7.2575 a bushel, rising for a
third day.  No ‘Wriggle’ Room  FCStone has forecast corn yields in the U.S., the biggest
grower and shipper of the grain, at 153 bushels an acre and
overall analyst estimates were about 155 bushels an acre,
according to the company’s report. The USDA said on July 12
yields would total 158.7 bushels an acre.  An estimate below 153 bushels an acre “has a strong
potential of sending this market limit up with overall U.S. corn
supply and demand left with no wriggle room,” Miralles said.  Corn futures for December delivery gained 4.25 cents, or
0.6 percent, to $6.93 a bushel. The price is up 11 percent this
year, making it the best-performing grain behind rice. The USDA
said in June it would resurvey farmers in northern states where
rain delayed planting, with the results due in today’s report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
