Turkey  introduced measures on short-
selling of stocks and threatened heavy penalties for investors
that don’t keep to rules governing the practice, the market
regulator said.  The regulator is probing short-selling practices on the
 Istanbul Stock Exchange  and futures market, the regulator said
in an e-mailed statement today.  The minimum cash or equity an investor should hold in an
investment account to start short-selling was raised to 70 
percent of the amount to be sold from 50 percent, the regulator 
said. A minimum of 35 percent of the amount should be maintained 
to continue short-selling, it said. Companies may also buy back 
as much as 10 percent of their share capital to allow “reduction 
in volatility of their share prices,” it said.  “If operations are identified wherein shares are
sold by sellers who don’t own the shares within the day and
don’t possess a sufficient equity ratio and without using the
short-sell button, or that violate other existing regulations,
severe penalties for these operations will be considered,” the
regulator said.  The main  ISE National 100 index (XU100)  slumped 5 percent to
50,307.63 yesterday, the lowest level since February 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
