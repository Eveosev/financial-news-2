Iceland’s government intends to sell
as much as a 25 percent stake in lender Landsbanki, Visir
reported, citing Finance Minister Steingrimur J. Sigfusson.  The sale is still in the “beginning stages” and no
political policy has been decided with regard to privatizing the
government’s shares in financial companies, Visir cited
Sigfusson as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
