Australia picked back-rower Scott
Higginbotham to make his first Test start and recalled lock
 Nathan Sharpe  for this weekend’s Tri-Nations rugby match against
 South Africa  in Durban.  Higginbotham, who impressed off the bench in Australia’s
opening three matches of 2011, replaces Ben McCalman at No. 8.
Sharpe comes in for Rob Simmons in the only other change to the
team that started the 30-14 loss to New Zealand five days ago.  “Scott has made a genuine impact in each of his Test
outings to date this year,” Wallabies coach  Robbie Deans  said
in an e-mailed statement. “We’ll be looking for him to do the
same from the start this week.”  On the bench, Salesi Ma’afu, Sitaleki Timani and Radike Samo replaced Pek Cowan, Dan Vickerman and Lachie Turner as
selectors opted for a split of five forwards and two backs
against the Springboks. Samo, 35, played the last of his six
Tests for  Australia  almost seven years ago.  The Wallabies, who last won the southern hemisphere’s
annual rugby championship in 2001, trail the All Blacks by four
points in the standings. Australia suffered an upset loss to
Samoa on July 17 before beating South Africa in the Tri-Nations
opener six days later.  WALLABIES SQUAD: 15.  Kurtley Beale , 14. James O’Connor, 13.
