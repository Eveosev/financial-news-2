Barclays Infrastructure Funds , a
unit of  Barclays Capital , bought a majority stake in a 26-
megawatt wind park in eastern  England  from  RES Group Ltd .  Barclays purchased an 85 percent share in the Wadlow wind
farm in Cambridgeshire, Gordon MacDougall, chief operating
officer of RES, said today by e-mail. He declined to disclose
the value of the transaction.  Construction began in June and RES expects the project to
start operating in October 2012. It will comprise 13 turbines of
2 megawatts each, producing enough power for about 15,000 homes.  RES, based in Kings Langley, England, doesnâ€™t plan to sell
its remaining stake, MacDougall said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
