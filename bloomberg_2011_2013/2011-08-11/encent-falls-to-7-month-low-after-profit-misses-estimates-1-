Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700) ,  China ’s
biggest Internet company by revenue, fell to the lowest level in
more than seven months in Hong Kong trading after reporting
second-quarter profit that missed analysts’ estimates.  The company dropped as much as 7.6 percent to HK$176.10,
the lowest intraday price since Jan. 4, and traded at HK$180.70
as of 10:24 a.m. local time. The stock is the worst performer on
Hong Kong’s benchmark  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  today.  Tencent yesterday reported profit grew 23 percent last
quarter, missing analysts’ estimates, afeter the company
increased spending to develop services including its
microblogging and electronic-commerce websites. The Shenzhen,
south China-based company’s stock has underperformed Chinese
Internet rivals including Baidu Inc. and Sina Corp. this year as
earnings growth is projected to slow.  “We think that Tencent shares could come under pressure in
the near term due to a negative market reaction to the higher
operating expenses,” Samsung Securities analyst Paul Wuh wrote
in a report today. He cut his estimates for Tencent’s profit
next year by 3 percent, citing the company’s higher spending.  Second-quarter net income increased to 2.35 billion yuan
($366 million) from 1.92 billion yuan a year earlier, Tencent
reported after the close of  Hong Kong  markets yesterday. This
lagged behind the 2.58 billion yuan average of 13 analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales climbed 44 percent to
6.74 billion yuan from 4.67 billion yuan.  General and administrative expenses more than doubled to
1.36 billion yuan, compared with 666 million yuan a year
earlier, Tencent said. Selling and marketing expenses rose 60
percent to 369.5 million yuan, it said.  In the second-quarter, Tencent added 27.6 million active
user accounts for its QQ instant-messaging service, China’s
most-popular, for a total of 701.9 million at the end of June.  Sales of Internet value-added services, including online
games and QQ-related subscription fees, rose to 5.39 billion
yuan from 3.58 billion yuan, Tencent said. Online advertising
sales increased 29 percent to 512.3 million yuan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
