Peru  will complete new windfall
mining tax regulations within two weeks, Gestion  reported ,
citing comments by Finance Minister Miguel Castilla.  The government has discussed its plan with mining companies
and formal negotiations will probably begin Aug. 15, Castilla
said in an interview with the Lima-based newspaper.  The tax on operating profits will be similar to  Chile ’s and
will maximize government revenue without affecting companies’
competitiveness, Gestion said citing Castilla.  To contact the reporter on this story:
