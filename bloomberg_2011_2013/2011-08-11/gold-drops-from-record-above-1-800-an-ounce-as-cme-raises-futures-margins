Gold futures fell the most in seven
weeks in New York as equities rebounded and  CME Group Inc. (CME) 
boosted margins to trade Comex contracts, prompting investor
sales after a rally to a record topping $1,800 an ounce.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose as much as 4.5 percent
after a drop in U.S. jobless claims. CME Group, owner of the
world’s largest futures market, raised  margins  on gold by 22
percent. The minimum amount of cash that speculators must keep
on deposit for an initial account increased to $7,425 on a 100-
ounce contract from $6,075.  “The strength in equities, coupled with the increase in
margins, is pushing gold down,”  Matthew Zeman , a strategist at
Kingsview Financial in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview.
“Investors are waiting for a deeper correction before they
start buying again.”  Gold futures for December delivery declined $32.80, or 1.8
percent, to close at $1,751.50 at 1:39 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York , the biggest decline since June 23. Earlier, the metal
climbed as much as 1.9 percent to a record $1,817.60. The price
fell as low as $1,734.50 after the settlement.  In the previous three days, gold jumped 8 percent after S&P
cut the U.S. credit rating one level from the top AAA grade on
Aug. 5. The metal has surged 46 percent in the past year on
demand for an investment haven as U.S. and European debt
escalated. On Aug. 8, the  S&P 500  tumbled to an 11-month low.  “As the economic problems around the world continue to
manifest, more and more people are identifying that gold is the
ultimate safe-haven asset,” Nick Barisheff, the president of
Toronto-based Bullion Management Group Inc., said in an e-mail.  Escalating Fears  Dennis Gartman , who correctly forecast the slump in
commodities in 2008, said he was “surprised” that gold hasn’t
declined more after the CME announcement.  “This is long overdue, and the CME is correct in having
done so,” Gartman said in his Suffolk, Virginia-based
newsletter.  Gold may rebound on European fiscal woes, Andrey Kryuchenkov, an analyst at VTB Capital in  London , said in a
report.  “Escalating fears over peripheral debt troubles in the
euro zone and of a sovereign downgrade on  France , with the
country’s banking sector taking a heavy hit yesterday due to
hefty exposure to Italy,” may boost demand for gold as a haven,
Kryuchenkov said.  Silver futures for September delivery fell 65.8 cents, or
1.7 percent, to close at $38.669 an ounce in New York.  Platinum futures for October delivery advanced $20.70, or
1.2 percent, to $1,792.40 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Palladium futures for September delivery rose $7, or 1
percent, to $733.80 an ounce.  To contact the reporters for this story:
