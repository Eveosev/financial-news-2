China  will accelerate spending on
social housing as the government gets “more serious” about the
effort in the second half of this year and in 2012, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  “Real growth” of spending on social housing may be as
much as 25 percent next year, according to a note by Merrill
Lynch economists including Lu Ting and Zhi Xiaojia. An
“increasingly uncertain” global economy and a scheduled
leadership change in China will contribute to an acceleration of
spending on social housing, according to the note.  China had by the end of June begun building more than 5
million of the 10 million social housing units targeted to start
this year, the Xinhua News Agency reported on July 14.  --Penny Peng. Editor:  John Liu   To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:
