Central American leaders are close
to a strategy for combating a drug-trafficking epidemic that has
gripped the region, said William Brownfield, assistant U.S.
Secretary of State.  Governments in the region need to lead efforts to eradicate
trade in illegal narcotics because the  U.S. Congress  probably
won’t devote significant additional foreign aid amid a push to
curb spending, Brownfield said. Spurring economic growth from
Guatemala to Panama will create jobs, reducing the temptation
for citizens to earn money by selling drugs, he said.  “Our challenge is to reach common agreement on the basic
elements of the strategy,” Brownfield said today at an event in
 Washington . “We’re pretty close to being there.”  Working with Colombia and  Mexico , the seven Central
American nations must decide on collective steps in the next one
to five years to fight narcotics shipments, Brownfield said.
Ninety percent of cocaine destined for the U.S. was smuggled
through Mexico or Central America in 2008, according to the U.S.
Drug Enforcement Administration.  Brownfield praised  Colombia ’s efforts for helping to train
police and provide drug-fighting resources, which spurred some
drug lords to seek haven in nations to the northwest. Cocaine
cultivation in Colombia, which receives $500 million a year in
U.S. anti-narcotics aid, fell 15 percent to 62,000 hectares last
year, according to a study based on satellite tracking published
in June by the  United Nations .  To contact the reporter on this story:
