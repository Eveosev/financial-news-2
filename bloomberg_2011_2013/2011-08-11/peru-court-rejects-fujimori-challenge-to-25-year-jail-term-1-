Peru’s  Supreme Court  didn’t violate
the constitution when it sentenced former President  Alberto Fujimori  to 25 years in prison for directing a government death
squad, the  Constitutional Tribunal , the nation’s highest court,
said today in an e-mailed statement.  The tribunal said it rejected Fujimori’s habeas corpus
request as the Supreme Court’s 2009 sentence was “totally
constitutional.”  Fujimori, 73, the country’s first leader to be extradited
and tried, was imprisoned for ordering two massacres of 25
people while he was president from 1990 to 2000. The Supreme
Court upheld the verdict following an appeal last year.  Fujimori’s supporters credit him with ridding Peru of the
Maoist guerrilla group, the Shining Path, which killed almost
70,000 people during its 20 year terror campaign, slashing
inflation from 7,650 to 3.5 percent, and laying the groundwork
for  Peru ’s booming economy, which shrank 5 percent when he took
office in 1990.  His government collapsed when his intelligence chief,
Vladimiro Montesinos, was caught on videotape in 2000 bribing
lawmakers.  His daughter, former congresswoman Keiko Fujimori, was
narrowly defeated in a June 5 presidential runoff by Ollanta
Humala after she failed to dispel concern that she represented a
return to the authoritarianism and corruption associated with
her father’s rule.  To contact the reporters on this story:
