The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars advanced against the greenback as equities climbed and
commodites rallied, spurring demand for higher-yielding assets.  The kiwi, as New Zealand’s currency is nicknamed, rebounded
from yesterday’s 3.3 percent decline versus the yen after prices
of commodities gained. Australia’s currency rose for the second
time in 11 days against its U.S. counterpart even after a report
showed the nation’s jobless rate increased by the most since
October.  “Aussie, kiwi have fallen greatly against the U.S. dollar
over the last two weeks and we’re seeing a slight rebound
today,”  John Doyle , a strategist in Washington at the currency-
trading firm Tempus Consulting Inc. “You’re having a risk-on
day with stocks up.”  Australia ’s dollar rose 0.9 percent to $1.0271 at 12:09
p.m. in  New York , from $1.0178 yesterday. The Aussie gained 0.7
percent to 78.79 yen, from 78.23 yen. New Zealand’s currency
strengthened 1.6 percent to 82.43 U.S. cents, from 81.12 cents.
It advanced 1.4 percent to 63.23 yen, from 62.35 yen.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 2.8 percent, after
plunging 4.4 percent yesterday. The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies
CRB Index of raw materials advanced 1.1 percent.  New Zealand’s currency maintained gains after data showed
 consumer confidence  rose. The sentiment index increased to 113.3
this month from 109.4 in July, according to figures from
Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. and  Roy Morgan
Research  released in Wellington today.  Australian unemployment jumped to 5.1 percent in July from
4.9 percent a month earlier, the first increase since October,
the statistics bureau said in Sydney today. The number of
workers fell by 100 after a revised 18,200 gain in June. That
compares with the median estimate for 10,000 additional jobs in
a Bloomberg News survey of 25 economists.  To contact the reporters on this story:
