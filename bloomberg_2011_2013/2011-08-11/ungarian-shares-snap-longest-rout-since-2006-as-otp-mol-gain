Hungarian shares rose, snapping the
longest losing streak since 2006 as the forint gained against
the euro and franc, reducing  default risk  for foreign-currency
loans. OTP Bank Nyrt. jumped the most in 15 months.  The BUX equity gauge advanced 2.1 percent to 17,746.91 at
its 5:06 p.m. close in Budapest, after sinking 20 percent in the
previous eight sessions. OTP added 6.8 percent to 4,200 forint
and oil refiner Mol Nyrt. rose 2.5 percent to 16,160 forint. The
two companies have a combined 58 percent weighting in the index.  Global stocks rebounded after a U.S. report showed jobless
claims in the world’s largest economy fell. The forint gained as
much as 6 percent versus the franc, the most in more than eight
years, and advanced 0.7 percent against the euro after the Swiss
central bank said it may temporarily peg the haven currency.  Hungary’s currency yesterday reached a record low of
272.624 versus the franc. The weaker forint hurts owners of
homes bought with loans denominated in foreign currency as they
pay more in local terms. Almost two-thirds of Hungarian
mortgages are denominated in foreign currencies, most of them in
francs, according to central bank data as of June 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
