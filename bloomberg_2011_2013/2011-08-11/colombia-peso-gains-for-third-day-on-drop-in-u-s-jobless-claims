Colombia’s peso rose for a third day
as an unexpected drop in U.S. jobless claims tempered concern
the  U.S. economy  is slowing.  The peso strengthened 0.4 percent to 1,789.57 per dollar at
2:24 p.m. New York time, from 1,795.97 yesterday. The peso has
gained 6.6 percent this year, the best performer among the six
most-traded Latin American currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  “The jobless report is bringing some calm to the market,”
said  Andres Pardo , the head analyst at financial services
holding company Corp. Financiera Colombiana, known as
Corficolombiana.  U.S. stocks rose after the Labor Department said today that
claims for unemployment insurance payments unexpectedly fell
last week to a four-month low of 395,000. Economists forecast
405,000 claims, according to the median estimate compiled by
Bloomberg. The number of people on unemployment benefit rolls
and those getting extended payments also dropped.  The yield on  Colombia ’s 10 percent bonds due in July 2024
rose five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 7.53
percent, according to data compiled by the nation’s stock
exchange. The bond’s price fell 0.478 centavo to 120.007
centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
