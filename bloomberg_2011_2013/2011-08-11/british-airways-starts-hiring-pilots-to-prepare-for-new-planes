British Airways, the biggest airline
based at London’s Heathrow airport, said it’s starting its
largest recruitment drive for pilots in more than a decade as
the carrier expands the fleet with new models.  British Airways plans to hire 800 pilots by 2016 in
anticipation of taking delivery of  Boeing Co. (BA)  787 Dreamliners
and Airbus SAS A380 superjumbos starting in two years, said Tony Cane, a spokesman. The new employees will help cover day-to-day
services, freeing existing flight crews to upgrade their skills.  “We need new pilots to cover for increased training for
flight crew due to fly the new aircraft,” Cane said today in a
phone interview. “We are ensuring that we have the right mix of
new and experienced pilots for the coming years.”  The airline, which merged with  Spain ’s Iberia to form
International Consolidated Airlines Group SA in January,
currently employs about 3,200 pilots, Cane said. About half the
recruits will be newly trained pilots, with the remainder coming
from other airlines and the U.K.’s armed forces. Those entering
the career for the first time will receive some training funding
that they will be able to pay back over time, British Airways
said in a  statement .  To contact the reporter on this story:
