Iceland’s Economy Minister Arni Pall Arnason wants continued cooperation with the  International
Monetary Fund  after the island country completes its bailout
program in August.  “It’s important for us to have a very close cooperation
with the fund during these times of uncertainty,” Arnason told
broadcaster  RUV . “It would be desirable for us to have in place
an agreement with the fund, which would enable us to use it as a
lender of last resort if the international markets are in
trouble.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
