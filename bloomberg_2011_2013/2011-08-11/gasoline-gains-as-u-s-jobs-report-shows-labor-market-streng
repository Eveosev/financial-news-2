Gasoline futures rose for a second
day as jobless claims fell to a four-month low last week,
indicating the labor market may be strengthening.  Futures rose as much as 2 percent as applications for
jobless benefits decreased 7,000 in the week ended Aug. 6 to
395,000, the fewest since early April, according to the Labor
Department. The Energy Department reported yesterday that U.S.
inventories crude oil and products fell last week.  “The jobs report was a positive today,” said  Phil Flynn ,
vice president of research at PFGBest in  Chicago . “And the
fundamentals look a little bit better if you look at yesterday’s
drawdown.”  Gasoline for September delivery rose 1.32 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $2.7957 a gallon at 9:29 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The futures are heading for the first two-
day gain since mid-July.  The number of people on unemployment benefit rolls and
those getting extended payments also dropped.  Futures jumped 4.3 percent yesterday after the department
said stockpiles of gasoline fell 1.59 million barrels to 213.6
million. Crude supplies fell for a second straight week and
distillate inventories dropped for the first time since July 1.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, fell 1.7
cents to $3.62 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA data.  Heating oil for September delivery declined 0.5 cent, or
0.2 percent, to $2.8603 a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
