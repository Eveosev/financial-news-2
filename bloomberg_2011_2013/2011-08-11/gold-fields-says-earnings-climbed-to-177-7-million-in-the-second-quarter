Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI) , the fourth-largest
producer of the precious metal, climbed to a three-month high in
Johannesburg trading after posting a 15 percent gain in second-
quarter profit on record  gold prices  and production gains.  The shares surged to the highest closing price since April
26. Profit excluding one-time items rose to 1.33 billion rand
($183 million), or 1.84 rand a share, from 1.15 billion rand in
the first quarter, or 1.60 rand, the company said in a statement
today. Production expanded 5.1 percent to 872,000 ounces from
830,000 ounces in the first quarter.  Gold prices jumped 8.6 percent in the quarter to an average
$1,508 an ounce, extending the rally to a record $1,814.95 in
 London  today on concern over global economic growth. The metal
may reach $2,000 by the year-end, Glenn Silverman, chief
investment officer at Investment Solutions, said yesterday.  Gold Fields,  Africa ’s largest producer after  AngloGold
Ashanti Ltd. (ANG) , gained 5.50 rand, or 4.9 percent, to 118 rand at
the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg, where the company is based.  “Clearly, at these sort of gold prices, cash flows for all
of the big gold majors are set to increase significantly,”
 David Davis , an analyst at SBG Securities Ltd., said by phone
from the city today. “The name of the game for all the big
companies is whether you can maintain or grow your production.”  AngloGold last week posted a 68 percent increase in second-
quarter earnings to $342 million excluding one-time items.  CEO Interview  Gold Fields Chief Executive Officer Nick Holland plans to
boost annual output to 5 million ounces from about 3.6 million
ounces this year to mitigate costs he sees rising 5 percent to
10 percent industrywide. In  South Africa , workers ended a five-
day strike this month to settle for wage gains of as much as 10
percent, twice the inflation rate, costing as much as 1.2 tons
of lost output. Average power tariffs rose 26 percent this year.  By the end of next year, Gold Fields may have given
approval to build “hopefully” three new projects, Holland told
Bloomberg News in an interview today. The company may spend a
minimum of $500 million to double production from about 230,000
ounces a year at its Damang mine in  Ghana , he said. A study on
the Chucapaca project potential in  Peru  may be completed next
year, while initial studies on the Arctic Platinum project in
 Finland  may be finished this year, the company said.  The Far South East project in the  Philippines  is also a
“sizeable opportunity,” Holland said, adding it may contain 15
million to 20 million ounces. Projects of that size would
“typically” be mined over 12 to 14 years, he said.  In Peru, where the company owns the Cerro Corona mine,
taxes or royalties may not be as harsh as is widely expected,
Holland said in the interview. In South Africa, Gold Fields’
view is mines won’t be nationalized, he told reporters.  The youth wing of South Africa’s ruling party has called
for mines and banks to be taken over by the government.  South African analysts compare quarters sequentially rather
than with the prior year  To contact the reporter on this story:
