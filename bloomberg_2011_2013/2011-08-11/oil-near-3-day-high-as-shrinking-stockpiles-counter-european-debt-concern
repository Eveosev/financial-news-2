Oil traded near a three-day high in
 New York  as shrinking U.S. crude stockpiles countered concern
that the European sovereign debt crisis is worsening.  Futures were little changed after slipping as much as 2.1
percent. Crude inventories dropped the most since December last
week, an Energy Department report showed. They were forecast to
climb a third week, according to the median analyst estimate in
a Bloomberg News survey. U.S. equities dropped yesterday and
costs to protect French debt reached a record.  “The market is telling us that down the lower end of the
range we should see reasonable demand come to the commodity,”
said  Jonathan Barratt , a managing director of Commodity Broking
Services Pty in Sydney, who kept his forecast for New York crude
oil to average $100 a barrel this year. “It’s a confidence game
at the moment.”  Crude for September delivery was at $82.88 a barrel, down 1
cent, in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 4:19 p.m. Sydney time. It earlier dropped as much as $1.75 to
$81.14. The contract yesterday rose $3.59, or 4.5 percent, to
$82.89, the highest since Aug. 5. Prices are 6.2 percent higher
the past year.  Brent oil for September settlement slid 26 cents, or 0.2
percent, to $106.42 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The European benchmark contract traded at a
premium of $23.64 to U.S. futures, compared with yesterday’s
record close of $23.79.  U.S. Futures Gain  Standard & Poor’s 500 futures increased 1.8 percent at 3:21
p.m. in  Tokyo , after the index’s 4.4 percent slump yesterday.
Euro Stoxx 50 futures added 1.8 percent. The MSCI Asia Pacific
Index lost 0.5 percent, paring a slump of as much as 2.4
percent.  Central bankers are trying to restore investor confidence,
with the  Federal Reserve  pledging to keep  interest rates  near
zero through at least mid-2013 to bolster U.S. growth and the
 European Central Bank  is buying bonds to stem a contagion that’s
threatening to spread to France.  U.S. crude-oil inventories decreased 5.23 million barrels
to 349.8 million last week, according to an Energy Department
report. It was the biggest decline since the week ended Dec. 17.
Inventories were forecast to climb 1.35 million barrels,
according to a Bloomberg News survey of analysts.  Total products supplied, a measure of demand, surged
652,000 barrels a day to 20.3 million, the highest level since
Dec. 24, according to the report. Gasoline stockpiles dropped
1.59 million barrels to 213.6 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
