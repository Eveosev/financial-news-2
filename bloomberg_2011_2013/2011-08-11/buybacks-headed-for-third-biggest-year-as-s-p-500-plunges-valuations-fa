U.S. companies are authorizing share
repurchase plans at a rate that may make 2011 the third biggest
year for buybacks since at least 1985, according to Birinyi
Associates Inc.  There were $36 billion in repurchases approved last month,
bringing the total this year to $324 billion, Rob Leiphart, an
analyst at the Westport, Connecticut-based research firm, wrote
in a note today. Should the rate hold up, 2011 would end with
$554 billion. Only 2006 and 2007 had more, with $655 billion and
$863 billion authorized, Birinyi data show.  Chief executive officers have more money than ever after
boosting cash for 10 straight quarters to $963.3 billion,
 Standard & Poor’s  data show. With stocks down 14 percent from
their April 2011 high, companies may be more inclined to
repurchase shares than return money through dividends, he said.  “Corporate America has a lot of money,” Leiphart said in
a telephone interview. “Buybacks offer the ultimate in
flexibility in that you can deploy capital and you aren’t
restrained going forward.”  The price-to-earnings ratio for the  S&P 500  has plunged as
the index dropped during the past 13 days. The benchmark gauge
for U.S. equities trades at 12.8 times earnings, 22 percent
below its 16.4 average since 1954, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. That’s the lowest point since March 2009, when the  bull
market  began.  The $324 billion in authorizations this year compares with
$222 billion at the end of July last year, Birinyi data show.
U.S. companies have executed 74 percent of all the buyback
programs they have authorized since 1985, according to Birinyi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
