Fibria Celulose SA (FIBR3) , the worldâ€™s
largest pulp producer, said it may sell its Piracicaba plant in
Brazil to OJI Paper Co. for $313 million.  OJI, based in Tokyo, has been granted exclusive acquisition
rights until Sept. 29, Sao Paulo-based Fibria said today in a
Brazilian regulatory filing. The sale is pending an audit of the
unit by OJI, among other items, according to the statement.  Fibria plans to use the proceeds from the sale to pay off
debt, Chief Financial Officer Joao Elek said in a May 25
interview. The paper maker obtained an $800 million  bank loan 
that month. Second quarter profit rose 67 percent after the
appreciation of the Brazilian real cut its dollar-denominated
debt and pulp production increased, the company said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
