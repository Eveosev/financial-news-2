Grupo Financiero Banorte SAB,
 Mexico ’s fourth-largest bank by outstanding loans, has started
talks to merge its pension fund with Afore XXI, the fund half-
owned by the Mexican Social Security Institute.  A merger of the pension funds “would allow for the creation
of important cost synergies and income that would benefit the
institutions and their clients,” Banorte said in a statement to
Mexico’s stock exchange yesterday after the close of trading.  The combined total assets of Banorte’s and Afore XXI’s
pension funds were worth 270 billion pesos ($21.6 billion) at
the end of July, according to data on the  website  of Consar, the
government pension regulator. This would represent the fifth
largest afore, as the pension funds are known, according to
Consar.  The combined afore would be Mexico’s largest by number of
accounts, Banorte said. The merger would be subject to approval
from  Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU) , which owns the other 50 percent
of Afore XXI and  Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G) , which holds a 49
percent stake in Banorte’s pension fund, Banorte said.  Mexico’s 15 afores managed 1.46 trillion pesos ($181
billion) of total assets as of June 30, according to Consar.  Afore XXI is the third best performer of Mexico’s 15
pension funds with an average three-year return of 10.5 percent,
Consar data shows. Banorte’s afore is ranked twelfth, with an
average three year return of 7.9 percent.  A representative for Banorte could not be reached for
comment after normal business hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
