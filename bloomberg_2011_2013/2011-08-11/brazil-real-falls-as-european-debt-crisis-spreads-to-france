Yields on most Brazil interest-rate
futures contracts rose as concern about slowing global economic
growth eased after claims for unemployment insurance payments in
the U.S. unexpectedly fell to a four-month low.  Yields on the interest-rate futures contract due in January
2013 increased five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to
11.92 percent at 12:21 p.m. New York time. The yield on the
contract due in January 2017 climbed nine basis points to 12.14
percent. The real declined 0.1 percent to 1.6273 per dollar,
from 1.6250 yesterday.  The yields reversed earlier declines and rose after the
U.S. Labor Department said applications for jobless benefits in
the world’s biggest economy fell 7,000 in the week ended Aug. 6
to 395,000, the fewest since early April. The report boosted
confidence in global economic growth, said  Luciano Rostagno ,
chief strategist at CM Capital Markets Ltda. in  Sao Paulo .  “The labor market data helped because it’s at the center
of the concerns,” he said in a telephone interview.  The real is weakening today amid concern over that the
sovereign debt crisis in the euro area is deepening, said
Alfredo Barbutti, an economist at Liquidez DTVM Ltda in Sao
Paulo,  “It’s  Europe  that is causing all this instability,”
Barbutti said in a telephone interview. “The volatility is
huge.”  -- With assistance from Claudia Carpenter in  London  and
