An investor’s $2.8 million bullish
bet on U.S. stocks jumped 79 percent in five hours as the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 4.6 percent to the highest
level since Aug. 5.  A trader bought 100,000 August $124  call options  on the
SPDR S&P 500 ETF for 28 cents each, according to a report from
Trade Alert LLC, a New York-based provider of options-market
data and analytics. Each option is linked to 100 shares, which
means that the initial investment jumped 79 percent to $5
million since the trade at 10:59 a.m.  New York  time. The ETF
surged 4.5 percent to $117.33 as of 4 p.m.  “Someone took a shot this morning and it paid off in a
matter of hours,”  Patrick Mortimer , director of options trading
at Pipeline Trading Systems LLC in New Hope, Pennsylvania, said
in a telephone interview. “You can do a lot more for your money
with options and take away your downside risk because it’s
limited and the sky’s the limit for upside.”  The  S&P 500  rallied as an unexpected drop in jobless claims
and improved corporate earnings tempered concern  Europe ’s debt
crisis is worsening. The benchmark gauge for American equities
increased 4.6 percent to 1,172.64.  A call-option buyer risks losing the amount paid for the
contact if the underlying shares don’t rise to the strike price
by the expiration date. This month’s options expire Aug. 19.
More than 2.1 million SPY calls changed hands today, 1.4 times
the four-week average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
