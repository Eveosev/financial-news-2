Samar Singh Sheikhawat, vice
president of marketing at  United Breweries Ltd. (UBBL) , comments on the
growth of the mild beer market in  India . Sheikhawat spoke in a
phone interview from New Delhi.  United Breweries, the maker of Kingfisher, India’s largest
beer brand, introduced Heineken in the world’s second-most
populous nation on Aug. 9.  “Eighty percent of the market is strong beer and the
balance is the mild beer market. That market has now started
growing in the last 1 1/2 to 2 years after being flat for about
3 years. At the top end of this market a significant crust is
forming -- the super-premium, mild beer market -- which today
consists of Kingfisher Ultra, Carlsberg, imported beers and now
Heineken. If you put all that together, this year it will be
about two million to three million cases.  ‘‘I would estimate that the rate of growth of this market
is about 30 percent to 40 percent year-on-year. While it’s a
small market in absolute size, the rate of growth is high.  ‘‘There’s a large youth population that is obviously the
target for beer. It is getting socially acceptable to drink,
especially beer.  ‘‘When we were going to launch Kingfisher Ultra two years
ago, we used to wonder who would buy a 100-rupee ($2.2) beer.
But today, Kingfisher or the mainstream beers are close to 90 or
95 rupees. What was considered a barrier for beer doesn’t exist
anymore. People are willing to pay for quality.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
