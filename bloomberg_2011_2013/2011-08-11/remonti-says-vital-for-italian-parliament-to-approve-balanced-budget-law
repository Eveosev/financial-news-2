Finance Minister  Giulio Tremonti 
said it’s vital to amend Italy’s constitution to make balanced
budgets compulsory.  “It is important that we put in the costitution the need
for a balance budget,” Tremonti said today in testimony before
bicameral committees of Parliament in Rome. The principle of the
amendment should be “that you can’t spend more than you get,
especially if at the same time you must issue  government bonds 
to fund your debt.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
