The Czech Republic’s equity index
rose from its lowest in more than two years, after a seven-day
selloff as gains at  Komercni Banka AS (KOMB)  and  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS) 
outweighed losses at  CEZ AS (CEZ)  and New World Resources Plc.  The PX stock gauge added 0.8 percent to 987.4 at its 4:28
p.m. close in  Prague , after earlier losing as much as 3.9
percent.  European and U.S. stocks rebounded as a report showing that
U.S. jobless claims dropped tempered concern the world’s largest
economy is slowing. The Swiss franc slid as plans to temporarily
peg the haven currency to the euro to stop its record rally were
considered by policy makers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
