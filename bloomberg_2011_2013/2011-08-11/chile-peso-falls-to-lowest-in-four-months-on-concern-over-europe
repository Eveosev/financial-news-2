Chile ’s peso was little changed as
higher-than-forecast U.S. industrial production offset Europe’s
slowest economic growth since the Euro region emerged from a
recession in 2009.  The peso fell less than 0.1 percent to 472.11 per U.S.
dollar at 2:43 p.m. New York time, from 472.04 yesterday. The
currency earlier dropped as much as 0.2 percent.  “We saw positive macroeconomic data from the U.S. that
showed an improvement in industrial production, helping to
increase demand for riskier assets, though the statistics on
economic growth in Europe were pretty bad,” Daniel Soto, an
analyst at ForexChile, said in a phone interview from Santiago.  U.S. industrial production rose 0.9 percent in July, almost
twice the median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg
and the biggest gain of the year, according to data today from
the  Federal Reserve  in Washington. Gross domestic product in the
17-nation euro area rose 0.2 percent from the first quarter, the
European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said in a
statement today. Economists had forecast the economy to expand
0.3 percent.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 1.3 percent to
1,189.24. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  slid 0.9 percent to
11,380.05. The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 slid 0.1 percent to
237.56 in  London  as three stocks dropped for every one that
climbed.  Copper, which accounts for half of Chile’s exports, fell 1
percent to $4.0125 per pound on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , after earlier dropping as much as 2 percent.  Chile’s one-year interest-rate swap rate, which reflects
traders’ views of future rates, climbed three basis points, or
0.08 percentage point, to 5.08 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
