South Korea  has “enough policy
room” to weather global uncertainties and a possible crisis as
the nation has a “solid” fiscal position and a flexible
monetary policy, Deputy Finance Minister Choi Jong Ku said. The
country has enough liquidity to meet foreign exchange demand in
times of emergency, Choi said at a briefing to the foreign press
in Seoul.  The nation’s foreign debt structure has improved
significantly and foreign-currency liquidity is sufficient
compared to during the Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. collapse in
2008, the  finance ministry  said in a separate statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
