Hungary’s forint gained the most in
more than eight years against the franc after the Swiss central
bank said a temporary peg is within the range of options that
policy makers could use to stem the currency’s record rally.  The forint appreciated 5.8 percent to 251.245 per franc as
of 4:34 p.m. in Budapest, its biggest intraday advance against
the Swiss currency since March 2003.  To contact the reporter on this story:
