Poland ’s benchmark stock index rose
for the first time in nine days, ending the longest losing
streak since 2001, as the zloty’s rally against the Swiss franc
eased concern foreign-currency mortgages will default.  The WIG20 Index climbed 4.5 percent to 2,293.38 at the 5:30
p.m. close in Warsaw, increasing the most since May 2010. The
gauge is still down 22 percent from a 2011 high on April 8, amid
speculation that  Europe ’s debt crisis is spreading and the U.S.
economic recovery is stalling.  “Polish banks are the biggest beneficiary of the falling
franc because of their large loan portfolios denominated in this
currency,” said Jakub Bentke, who helps manage the equivalent
of $2.1 billion at Warsaw-based mutual fund KBC TFI SA. “No
wonder banking stocks are among the biggest gainers as credit
risk is falling.”  The zloty surged as much as 5.5 percent against the franc
today, climbing from a record low, after the Swiss central bank
said a temporary peg is within the range of options policy
makers could use to stem the currency’s record rally.  A stronger franc increases loan payments for borrowers in
the Alpine country’s currency. Franc-denominated mortgages
totaled 151.8 billion zloty ($52 billion) in June, accounting
for almost 53 percent of total home loans in Poland, according
to the country’s financial regulator.  Bank Millennium SA (MIL) , majority-owned by Banco Comercial
Portugues SA, led advances among financial shares in Warsaw,
soaring 14 percent to 4.2 zloty.  BRE Bank SA (BRE) , a unit of
Commerzbank AG, rallied 12 percent to 266 zloty.  Bank Pekao SA (PEO) , Poland’s second-largest lender, surged 9.7
percent to 142 zloty, the biggest daily gain in two years.  PKO Bank Polski SA rose for the first time in nine days,
climbing 5.7 percent to 35 zloty as Poland’s largest bank said
first-half net income rose 23 percent to 1.84 billion zloty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
