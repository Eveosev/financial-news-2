The  New Zealand  and Australian
dollars dropped this week as concern the  U.S. economy  is slowing
and  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis is getting worse encouraged
demand for a refuge in the greenback.  The kiwi, as New Zealand’s currency is nicknamed, had its
biggest five-day slide versus the yen in more than a year after
a report showed confidence among U.S. consumers dropped to a
three-decade low.  The two South Pacific currencies “will be hostage to wider
global developments,” said Khoon Goh, head of market economics
and strategy at ANZ National Bank Ltd. in Wellington.
“Investors will still be pretty tentative about things. Until
we see real, concrete actions being taken, I don’t think any
rally that we’ve seen so far will likely be sustained.”  New Zealand’s dollar fell 0.2 percent 83.03 U.S. cents at
11:40 p.m. in  New York , from 83.19 cents yesterday. The kiwi
dropped 0.3 percent to 63.72 yen, from 63.93 yen. The Aussie
decreased 0.1 percent to $1.0338, from $1.0352, after touching
99.28 U.S. cents on Aug. 9, the lowest level since March 18. It
slid 0.3 percent to 79.35 yen, from 79.55.  The kiwi fell 1.6 percent this week versus the dollar and
plunged 3.6 percent against the yen in the largest five-day drop
since July 2010. The Australian dollar has declined 1 percent
against the greenback since Aug. 5 and weakened 3.1 percent
versus the yen.  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
index of U.S. consumer sentiment slumped this month to 54.9, the
lowest since May 1980. The gauge was projected to decrease to
62, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the reporters on this story:
