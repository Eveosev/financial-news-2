Canada recorded its biggest trade
deficit in nine months in June as energy and automotive exports
fell, adding to evidence the country’s recovery is waning.  The trade deficit widened to C$1.56 billion ($1.57 billion)
in June, the country’s fifth straight trade gap, from a revised
C$1.04 billion shortfall a month earlier, Statistics Canada said
today. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News forecast the
country would post an C$800 million deficit in the month,
according the median of 17 forecasts.  Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney said last month export
growth will remain modest because of a strong currency and the
need for companies to regain competitiveness. The country has
reported average monthly deficits of about C$500 million since
the start of 2009, compared with surpluses averaging about C$4.4
billion over the previous five years.  Exports decreased 1.7 percent in June to C$36.5 billion,
led by a 5.1 percent drop in sales of energy products amid
refinery shutdowns and a 5.3 percent fall in automotive
products. Imports declined 0.2 percent to C$38.0 billion as
prices for goods shipped into Canada fell and energy imports
dropped 11.7 percent.  The volume of imports, which excludes the impact of price
changes, rose by 1.9 percent as prices fell 2.1 percent. Export
volumes decreased 2.2 percent as prices rose 0.5 percent.  The trade surplus with the U.S., Canada’s largest trading
partner, narrowed to C$3.63 billion in June from C$3.73 billion
in May. Canada sends about 75 percent of its exports to the U.S.  In a separate report, Statistics Canada said the new house
price index rose 0.3 percent in June, led by increases in
Toronto. From a year earlier, new home prices increased 2.1
percent. Both numbers matched the median estimates in Bloomberg
surveys.  To contact the reporter on this story:
