Cameroon’s  main opposition party,
the Social Democratic Front, pledged to take part in a
presidential election scheduled for October, Chairman John Fru Ndi said.  The party, which set election-reform conditions last year
that needed to be met before it agreed to participate, will pick
its candidate once the date for the vote is chosen, Fru Ndi told
reporters in Yaounde, the capital, yesterday. He was the party’s
nominee during the last election, held in 2004.  President Paul Biya, who has ruled  Africa ’s fourth-biggest
cocoa producer for 29 years, has yet to declare whether he will
run for another term.  Cameroonians should register to vote in order to “point out
the weaknesses in the electoral system,” Fru Ndi said. National
polls in the central African nation, have been “marred by severe
irregularities,” according to the  U.S. State Department .  To contact the reporter on this story:
