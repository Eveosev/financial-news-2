Old Mutual Zimbabwe Ltd. has resumed
paying some pensions after converting payment to U.S. dollars,
 Newsday  said, citing a company statement.  The companyâ€™s life insurance unit has limited payments to
policies taken out before 2004, Harare-based Newsday said on its
website. Policy-holders may be able to cash-in pensions worth
less than $250, Newsday added.  Zimbabwe abandoned its currency in 2009 in an attempt to
wipe-out inflation of 500 billion percent. The country now uses
multiple currencies. The inflation rendered most pensions
worthless.  To contact the reporter on this story:
