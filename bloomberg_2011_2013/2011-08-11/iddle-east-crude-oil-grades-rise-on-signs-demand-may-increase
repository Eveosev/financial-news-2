Middle East crude-oil grades for
sale to  Asia  rose on speculation demand will grow after declines

slowdown in consumption.  Murban, produced by Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., advanced

Bloomberg News. Prices had tumbled 11 percent in the past six
trading days. Qatar Marine climbed 49 cents to $101.03 a barrel,

and 1.9 million barrels a day in 2012, Helen Henton, a London-
based analyst at Standard Chartered Plc, said in a report dated
yesterday. The bank estimates the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will need to produce 31 million barrels a
day to balance the market in this quarter, or 1 million barrels
a day higher than current production.  Oman crude for immediate loading climbed 0.5 percent to
$101.61 a barrel, Bloomberg data showed. Dubai oil for delivery
in October rose 49 cents to $101.19. Murbanâ€™s premium to its
benchmark price gained 7 cents to 13 cents.  Oman futures for October delivery fell $1.74, or 1.7
percent, to $100.72 a barrel on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange at
6:05 p.m. Singapore time, with 931 contracts traded. The
settlement price was $102.12 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  The September Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps, which
measures the European marker contract against the Persian Gulf
grade, rose 5 percent to $5.09 a barrel, according to data from
PVM Oil Associates. The exchange for swaps for October climbed
26 cents to $4.76.  To contact the reporter on this story:
