EM Ltd. won a restraining order in
its efforts to collect an $801.4 million judgment against
 Argentina  over defaulted bonds.  U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa signed the order, made
public today, which was directed to any assets the country may
have in Citibank NA and the Federal Reserve Bank of  New York .  The judgment stems from Argentina’s 2001 default on $80
billion owed to foreign creditors. The country hasn’t made
principal or interest payments since the default.  Last month a federal appeals court in New York ruled that
EM and NML Capital Ltd., which hold almost $2.4 billion in
judgments against Argentina, can’t seize $105 million in assets
of the country’s central bank held at New York’s Federal Reserve
Bank.  The case is EM Ltd. v. Republic of Argentina, 03-CV-2507,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
