Treasuries snapped a three-day surge
amid speculation investors will demand higher yields at a sale
of 30-year bonds today and as investors bet the  U.S. economy 
isn’t slowing enough to justify keeping yields at a record low.  Treasuries pared a bigger drop earlier as U.S. stock
futures reversed earlier gains, indicating the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index probably fell for the fourth day in five, supporting
demand for the safest assets. Ten-year yields rose after the
real yield, which accounts for inflation, dropped to negative
1.45 percent yesterday, approaching the lowest since 2008.  “Treasuries are still a safe haven because it is such a
deep and liquid market,” said  Marc Ostwald , a fixed-income
strategist at Monument Securities Ltd. in  London . “There’s a
limit to the downside here. There will probably be a
considerable concession made ahead of the auction.”  Ten-year yields rose two basis points to 2.16 percent at
8:01 a.m. in  New York , according to Bloomberg Bond Trader
prices. The 2.125 percent note maturing in August 2021 fell
4/32, or $1.25 per $1,000 face amount, to 99 22/32. Earlier
yields climbed as much as eight basis points.  The rate fell to a record low 2.0346 percent on Aug. 9. The
figure translated into negative 1.57 percent after subtracting
inflation, the lowest real yield since September 2008.  Thirty-year yields rose four basis points to 3.56 percent,
while two-year yields fell one basis point at 0.17 percent.  U.S. equity-index futures fell, erasing earlier gains and
signaling the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index may sink to an 11-
month low.  Treasuries surged this month, pushing 10-year yields down
more than 50 basis points since the start of August, as the
European sovereign debt crisis and a potential double-dip
recession in the U.S. sent the  S&P 500 Index  down 13 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
