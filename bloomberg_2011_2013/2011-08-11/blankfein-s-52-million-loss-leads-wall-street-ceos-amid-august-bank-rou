Lloyd C. Blankfein, chairman and
chief executive officer of  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , lost about
$52 million of his personal wealth this month -- more than the
combined losses of four other Wall Street CEOs.  The heads of  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , Citigroup Inc.,
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs saw the
value of their combined shareholdings fall by $94 million on
paper since July 29, based on regulatory filings. That includes
a $40 million plunge yesterday.  The  S&P 500 Financials Index (S5FINL)  of 81 companies fell 7.1
percent yesterday and is down 18 percent this month amid concern
that the  U.S. economy  is weakening and firms may face losses
linked to European sovereign debts. Bank of America declined the
most among the five banks, dropping 11 percent yesterday to shed
almost one-third of its market value since July 29.  “My entire net worth is in this company,” Bank of America
CEO  Brian T. Moynihan , 51, said yesterday on a conference call
hosted by mutual-fund manager Bruce R. Berkowitz, whose funds
own the lender’s shares. “We believe in the stock, and you’ll
see us buy the stock,” Moynihan said of his management team.  The value of Moynihan’s 485,904 shares dropped to $3.3
million yesterday from $4.7 million on July 29 as the  Charlotte ,
North Carolina-based company fell to $6.77 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading.  Morgan Stanley (MS) ’s James P. Gorman, who entered the market to
purchase 100,000 shares on Aug. 4 at an average price of $20.62
a share, watched his stock drop to $16.45 yesterday. Last week’s
purchase accounted for $417,070 of Gorman’s $5.4 million in
total stock losses since July 29.  Blankfein’s Holdings  Moynihan’s and Gorman’s holdings paled next to Blankfein’s
2.1 million Goldman Sachs shares, which were worth $232 million
at yesterday’s closing price of $110.34, down 18 percent since
July 29.  After Blankfein, 56, the biggest loser was JPMorgan’s James Dimon. His 5.08 million  shares  lost $31 million so far this
month as New York-based JPMorgan slid 15 percent to $34.37 from
$40.45.  “We will build this business,” Dimon, 55, said in an
interview on CNBC. “And I guarantee you in five years the stock
will be higher than today.”  Citigroup Inc. (C) ’s Vikram S. Pandit, 54, saw his paper wealth
drop 26 percent to $13.1 million from $17.7 million before the
start of August.  The five CEOs own a combined $439 million in common stock,
down from about $531 million on July 29. The holdings were taken
from company filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission and don’t include options or restricted stock that
haven’t been converted to common shares.  Spokesmen for all five banks declined to comment. The
following table shows the stockholdings of each of the five
CEOs, the value on July 29 and the value on Aug. 10.
