The Syrian government must be
supported, as a NATO attack on the country, which is cracking
down on its dissidents, would further destabilize the  Middle
East , a senior member of the Iranian parliament said,  Donya-e-
Eqtesad  reported.  “Throwing  Syria  in the jaws of a wolf called the U.S.”
means “one more disaster will be inflicted upon the Islamic
world,” Alaeddin Boroujerdi, who heads the parliament’s
national security and foreign policy committee, said during a
trip to  Egypt  this week, according to the Tehran-based
newspaper.  “Another option is to help Syria to end its internal
conflicts,” and the Syrian government’s suggested reforms are
“noteworthy,” the newspaper cited Boroujerdi as saying.  “The Islamic world’s interest is to try and maintain Syria
firm, as a center for Palestinian resistance,” Boroujerdi said,
according to Donya-e-Eqtesad.  To contact the reporter on this story:
