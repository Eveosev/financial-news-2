The Vietnamese dong weakened on
speculation companies bought dollars to import gold after
domestic prices for the metal surpassed global prices. Bonds
advanced.  The first imports of gold under new government quotas are
expected to start arriving tomorrow,  Vietnam  News reported today,
citing importers. Companies were given permission to import up
to five metric tons of gold, the nation’s central bank said on
Aug. 9 after local prices surged to a record.  “Dollars have been mobilized to import gold under the new
central bank regulation,” said Nguyen Duy Phong, a Ho Chi Minh
City-based analyst at ACB Securities Inc.  The dong fell 0.1 percent to 20,812 per dollar as of 3:39
p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency has declined 1.1 percent this week.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam set the dong-dollar  reference
rate  at 20,618 today, unchanged from yesterday, according to its
website. The dong is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either
side of the fixing.  The yield on Vietnam’s five-year bonds fell two basis
points to 12.55 percent, according to a daily fixing price from
banks compiled by Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point.  --Nguyen Kieu Giang in Hanoi. Editors: Andrew Janes, Anil Varma  To contact the Bloomberg News Staff on this story:
