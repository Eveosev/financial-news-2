gins and every effort is made to obtain a report from all ginners. Data are 
collected on the first and fifteenth of each month (September - January and 
February 1) for all estimating States while data collection begins with an 
August 1 survey in Texas. A final survey is conducted after gins finish 
ginning for the season. Ginners are asked to report the number of Upland and 
American Pima bales ginned prior to the data collection date. Data are 
collected by telephone, fax, and internet. If a completed report is not 
received from an active gin, the bales ginned are estimated using 
administrative data or imputed using current survey data for neighboring gins 
and the previously reported data for the imputed gin.  Estimating Procedures: Information obtained from the cotton ginnings survey 
is used to establish estimates of Upland and American Pima bales ginned to 
date. These estimates are reviewed for errors, reasonableness, and 
consistency with historical estimates.  Revision Policy: Cotton ginnings estimates are subject to revision in the 
annual report released in May and are based on a thorough review of all 
available data.  Reliability: Cotton ginnings estimates are based on a census of all known 
ginners and therefore, have no sampling variability. However, estimates are 
subject to errors such as omissions, duplication, and mistakes in reporting, 
recording, and processing of the data. While these errors cannot be measured 
directly, they are minimized through strict quality controls in the data 
collection process and a careful review of all reported data for consistency 
and reasonableness.  To contact the reporter on this story:
