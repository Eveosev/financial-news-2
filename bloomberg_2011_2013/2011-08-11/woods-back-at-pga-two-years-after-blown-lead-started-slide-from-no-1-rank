Steve Stricker  matched the lowest
score in major tournament history at the U.S. PGA Championship,
where  Tiger Woods  stumbled to his worst opening round in one of
golf’s four Grand Slam events.  Pre-tournament favorite Rory McIlroy started his second
round after straining a tendon in his right wrist three holes
into yesterday’s play. McIlroy said he had considered
withdrawing because of the injury.  Stricker, at No. 5 the world’s top-ranked American golfer,
shot a 7-under-par 63 yesterday at  Atlanta Athletic Club  in
Johns Creek,  Georgia , and has a two-shot lead over fellow
Wisconsin native Jerry Kelly at the year’s final major. Stricker
is the 23rd player to shoot 63 at a major and the 11th to
accomplish the feat at the PGA Championship.  “It’s a good start,” said the 44-year-old Stricker, an
11-time PGA Tour winner whose best showing in a major was a
runner-up finish at the 1998  PGA Championship . “I’m trying to
put this behind me and come out and start a new day.”  Woods, 35, a four-time PGA Championship winner, had five
bogeys, four birdies and three double-bogeys in his worst first-
round score in 62 majors as a professional or amateur. His
previous high for the opening round of a major was a 76, most
recently at the 2006 U.S. Open.  “Once you get to a major championship, you just let it
fly, let it go,” said Woods, who has continued to incorporate
swing changes since returning from a four-month injury layoff
last week. “And I did and it cost me.”  Halfway Cut  Tied for 129th in the field of 156, Woods is in danger of
missing the cut for weekend play at the PGA Championship for the
first time in 14 appearances. He’s scheduled to tee off at 1:45
p.m. today, a half hour before Stricker. Woods has missed two
cuts in majors as a professional -- at the 2006  U.S. Open  and
2009 British Open. The top 70, plus ties, will advance to this
weekend’s play.  The top four players on the leaderboard after the first
round were Americans, as the U.S. seeks to end a run of six
majors without a winner, the longest in history.  Shaun Micheel, the 2003 PGA Championship winner, is in
third place after a 4 under, one ahead of Scott Verplank.
Micheel, at 42, is the youngest of the group. Kelly, like
Stricker, is 44 and Verplank is 47.  Five players in their 40s have won the PGA Championship,
the last being  Vijay Singh  in 2004, when he was 41.  Anders Hansen of  Denmark  had an early birdie in the second
round today to get to 3-under par.  Americans  Davis Love III , 47, and Brandt Jobe, 46, are in a
group of eight golfers at 2 under. Italy’s 18-year-old Matteo
Manassero,  Australia ’s John Senden,  Zimbabwe ’s Brendon de Jonge,
 England ’s Simon Dyson and American Bill Haas also shot 68
yesterday.  McIlroy Injury  McIlroy, the U.S. Open champion from  Northern Ireland , shot
an even-par 70 while playing most of the first round with his
wrist taped. He was hurt when he jammed his club into a tree
root in front of his ball.  McIlroy said he had swelling and a sharp pain in his arm
that extended to his elbow and shoulder. He started his second
round at 8:35 a.m. this morning after testing the injury on the
practice range.  “It’s the last major of the year,” McIlroy said
yesterday. “I’ve got six or seven months until the Masters, so
I might as well try to play through the pain.”  Phil Mickelson , ranked sixth in the world, shot a 1-over 71
and is tied for 36th place. Top-ranked Luke Donald is even par,
while fellow Englishman Lee Westwood is 1 over.  First-Time Winners  Stricker, who has two victories this year, is seeking to
become the seventh consecutive first-time major winner, a streak
that started with Graeme McDowell at the 2010 U.S. Open.  Stricker had no bogeys and made two of his seven birdies at
the most difficult holes on the course, the 260-yard, par-3 15th
and the 507-yard, par-4 18th. The 15th played to a 3.43 stroke
average yesterday and the 18th was at 4.71.  “That’s like stealing probably three, four shots from the
field there,” Stricker said.  Woods started on the 10th hole and moved atop the
leaderboard with birdies on three of his first five holes. He
then shot 10 over par for the rest of the round, the slide
starting with a double-bogey at the 15th.  Woods’s worst previous score at the PGA Championship was a
75, most recently during the fourth round in 2009, when he blew
a lead and was beaten by Y.E. Yang. His worst round as a
professional was a 10-over 81 during the third round of the 2002
British Open.  Woods hasn’t won a tournament since November 2009 and the
most recent of his 14 major titles was at the 2008 U.S. Open.
The highest first-round score by a PGA Championship winner was
75 by John Mahaffey in 1978.  To contact the reporters on this story:
