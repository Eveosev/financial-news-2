Labor union officials for workers at
 Kia Motors Corp. (000270) ,  South Korea â€™s second-biggest carmaker, said
they hope to hammer out a wage agreement with management as
early as today.  Union officials and company representatives of Seoul-based
Kia will meet at 3 p.m. in an effort to reach a new agreement
covering wages for 2011 after a majority of employees rejected a
pact proposed two weeks ago, according to a statement on the
website of the union for Kia workers.  Michael Choo , a spokesman for Kia, declined to comment.  Kia Motors shares rose 0.3 percent to 70,200 won as of 2:35
p.m. in Seoul, compared with a 0.5 percent gain in the benchmark
Kospi index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
