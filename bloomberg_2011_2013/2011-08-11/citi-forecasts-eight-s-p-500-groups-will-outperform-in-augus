Eight of the 24 industry groups in
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index will “outperform” in August,
according to a forecast by Keith Miller, Citigroup Inc.’s co-
director of global quantitative research, in a note dated

transportation to “outperform” from “neutral” last month.
Energy and capital goods were cut to “underperform” compared
to their “neutral” ratings a month ago.
