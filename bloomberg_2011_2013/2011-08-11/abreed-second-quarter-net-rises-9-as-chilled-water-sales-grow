National Central Cooling Co., the
United Arab Emirates utility known as Tabreed, said second-
quarter  profit rose  9 percent as chilled water sales grew.  Net income advanced to 43.8 million dirhams ($12 million)
from 40.25 million dirhams, Chief Financial Officer Adrian Kershaw said in a conference call with reporters today. EFG-
Hermes Holding SAE estimated a profit of 30 million dirhams,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Tabreed, which builds and operates air-conditioning and
cooling systems, said in April it completed a recapitalization
program by refinancing 2.63 billion dirhams of debt and
obtaining as much as 3.1 billion dirhams of long-term capital
from Abu Dubai government-owned Mubadala Development Co. The
company repaid a 735 million-dirham sukuk in July.  “Our strategy of developing the business for the longer
term by focusing on the core business of chilled water is paying
off,” Chief Executive Officer Sujit Parhar said in an e-mailed
statement. “This business segment has contributed over 90
percent of the total earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation, and amortization in first half.”  First-half revenue rose 14 percent to 532.2 million
dirhams, while sales of chilled water increased 29 percent to
425.6 million, the company said.  Tabreed has no need to raise any debt in the near
future and a 1.4 billion-dirham bridging loan is available to
cover the rest of its capital expenditure, Kershaw said.  The shares rose 0.6 percent to 82 fils in Dubai yesterday,
giving the company a market value of 540 million dirhams. The
stock has lost 51 percent this year compared with a 10.4 percent
drop in the benchmark Dubai Financial Market General Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
