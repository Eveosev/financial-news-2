Havells India Ltd. (HAVL) , the nation’s
second-largest maker of electrical components, expects sales of
water heaters and kitchen appliances to increase revenue 15
percent this year.  “We expect the home appliances segment, including water
heaters, to contribute about 1.2 billion rupees to revenue,”
Anil Gupta, joint managing director, said in a phone interview
yesterday. A 15 percent increase over the 56.1 billion rupees
($1.2 billion) reported in the year ended March 31 will exceed
the 63.5-billion rupee median estimate of 15 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg News.  Havells shares, which have declined 12 percent in 2011,
closed little changed at 348.25 rupees in Mumbai yesterday. The
stock jumped 54 percent in 2010 after more than quadrupling in
the previous year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
