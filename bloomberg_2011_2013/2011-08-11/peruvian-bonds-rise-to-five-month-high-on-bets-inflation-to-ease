Peruvian bonds rose to a five-month
high on bets slower global growth will cause inflation pressures
to ease in the South American country.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 6.08 percent at 3:18 p.m. in  New York ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The bond’s price rose
0.22 centimo to 112.04, the highest since Feb. 23.  Investors are revising the outlook for  Peru ’s economy as
slower global growth risks curtailing output for the Andean
nation’s metal exports. Reduced world demand will help cool
inflation in Peru and lead the central bank to keep interest
rates unchanged until next year, said  Gustavo Rangel , an
economist at ING Financial Markets in New York.  “The Fed’s very dovish announcement of monetary policy and
the growth outlook added downside risk to yields in the U.S.,”
Rangel said. “The same is happening in  Latin America . It’s the
incorporation of downside risk for growth, so there’s no need
for central banks to raise anymore.”  The  Federal Reserve  vowed Aug. 9 to keep its benchmark
 interest rate  near zero through at least mid-2013 and signaled
it may expand record monetary stimulus as the world’s largest
economy grows more slowly than it was expecting.  Peru’s central bank will probably keep its benchmark
lending rate at 4.25 percent for a third month when it meets
today, according to 20 of 21 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
The central bank increased the rate to a two-year high in May,
after inflation accelerated the most since 2008. The bank will
announce its decision at about 7 p.m. New York time.  Economic Outlook  The Peruvian economy will grow 6.5 percent to 7 percent
this year and 6 percent in 2012, Walter Bayly, chief executive
officer of Credicorp Ltd., Peru’s largest financial services
company, said during a conference call with analysts today.  The sol gained 0.2 percent to 2.7445 per  U.S. dollar , from
2.7505 yesterday.  The central bank didn’t buy or sell dollars in the spot
currency market today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
