The Czech Republic’s PX stock gauge
rebounded from a two-year low, rising 0.8 percent to 987.4 at
its 4:28 p.m. close in Prague.  The following were among the most active equities on the
Prague Stock Exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG)   rose 4.6 percent, the most in
more than eight months, to 628.5 koruna. Banks were among the
biggest gainers as European shares rebounded after a report
showed U.S. jobless claims fell, overshadowing concerns that
 Europe ’s debt crisis will spread.  Komercni Banka AS (KOMB)   snapped a seven-day, 24 percent
plunge after its owner, Societe Generale SA, rejected market
speculation about the French company’s stability and  Standard &
Poor’s  and Moody’s Investors Service affirmed  France ’s top bond
ratings. Komercni rose 3.5 percent to 3,000 koruna.  To contact the reporter on this story:
