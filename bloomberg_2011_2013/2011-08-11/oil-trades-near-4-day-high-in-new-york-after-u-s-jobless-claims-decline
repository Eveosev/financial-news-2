Oil traded near a four-day high in
 New York  as investors bet that signs of a strengthening U.S.
economy indicate fuel demand will increase in the world’s
biggest crude-consuming nation.  Futures were little changed after rising for a second day
yesterday as U.S. and European equities surged. Applications for
jobless benefits decreased 7,000 to 395,000 last week, the
fewest since early April, according to the Labor Department. The
median forecast of 48 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
projected claims would increase to 405,000.  “Oil came off its lows once the jobless numbers came
out,” said  Addison Armstrong , director of market research at
Tradition Energy in Stamford,  Connecticut . “Worries about the
debt crisis and economy are being played out in equities and oil
is following.”  Crude for September delivery was at $85.56 a barrel, down
16 cents, in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  at 8:47 a.m. Sydney time. The contract yesterday gained
$2.83, or 3.4 percent, to $85.72, the highest settlement since
Aug. 5. Prices are down 1.4 percent this week and 13 percent
higher the past year.  Brent oil for September settlement gained $1.34, or 1.3
percent, to $108.02 a barrel on the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange
in  London  yesterday. The European benchmark contract settled at
a premium of $22.30 to U.S. futures, compared with a record
close of $23.79 on Aug. 10.  Equities Rally  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index jumped 4.6 percent to
1,172.64 at the 4 p.m. close in New York. The Stoxx Europe 600
Index rallied 3.2 percent, rebounding from a two-year low.  French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  and German Chancellor
Angela Merkel plan to meet next week after concern that the
euro-area debt crisis will spread rattled French markets. The
leaders of Europe’s two biggest economies will discuss economic
governance of the 17-nation euro region in Paris on Aug. 16,
according to separate statements issued yesterday.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will trim
shipments by 0.3 percent this month as refiners reduce imports
during plant maintenance, according to a report yesterday from
tanker-tracker Oil Movements.  Exports will drop to 22.71 million barrels a day in the
four weeks to Aug. 27, the Halifax, England-based researcher
said. That compares with 22.77 million barrels in the month to
July 30. The data excludes Ecuador and Angola. The decline is
smaller than expected for the time of year, which may be linked
to higher demand in  Japan , the consultant said.  New York oil climbed to an intraday high of $114.83 a
barrel on May 2 as unrest in the  Middle East  and North Africa
toppled leaders in Tunisia and Egypt and spread to Libya, Syria,
Yemen and Bahrain. Libyan output fell 50,000 barrels, or 33
percent, to 100,000 in July, the lowest since at least 1962
based on yearly data, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
