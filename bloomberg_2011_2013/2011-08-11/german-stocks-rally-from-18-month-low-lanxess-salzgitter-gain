German stocks climbed, with the
benchmark  DAX Index (DAX)  rebounding from its lowest level since
February 2010, as steelmakers advanced.  Lanxess AG (LXS)  jumped 7.9 percent as the chemical maker raised
its full-year profit forecast after demand for synthetic rubber
pushed second-quarter earnings higher than analysts had
estimated.  Salzgitter AG (SZG) ,  Germany ’s second-biggest steelmaker,
surged 21 percent after posting a profit in the first half.
Competitor  ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA)  rose the most since May.  The DAX Index rose 3.3 percent to 5,797.66 at the 5:30 p.m.
close in  Frankfurt , ending the longest falling streak since
1978. The gauge has still tumbled 23 percent since this year’s
high on May 2 amid concern that the global economic recovery is
stalling, while European leaders struggled to contain the
sovereign-debt crisis. The broader HDAX Index added 3.4 percent
today.  “Recent time has seen a lot of selling activity, but it is
unclear what the exchanges are discounting,” said Anita Paluch,
a sales trader at ETX Capital in  London . “The economic slowdown
has been indicated by the relevant data for quite some time and
the  euro-zone  problems aren’t new either.”  The benchmark DAX rose as much as 3.8 percent earlier today
and dropped as much as 2.2 percent. The gauge swung between
gains and losses more than 10 times.  “Investors are very nervous and the policy response is
uncertain,” said Marcus Svedberg, chief economist at East
Capital Asset Management AB. “Any short-term solution, which
may be necessary to calm down the market and reignite growth,
will not solve the underlying problems in the U.S. and the euro
zone.”  Lanxess, Salzgitter Jump  Lanxess surged 7.9 percent to 43.96 euros after saying
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and
exceptional items will increase by about 20 percent. Lanxess had
predicted a gain of as much as 15 percent. Second-quarter Ebitda
before items rose 26 percent to 339 million euros ($482
million), beating the 320.5 million-euro estimate in a Bloomberg
survey.  Salzgitter soared 21 percent to 45.39 euros, its largest
jump since October 2008, after posting a first-half profit of
93.7 million euros, compared with a 3.5 million-euro loss in the
same period a year earlier. The German steelmaker said sales
surged 18 percent and cited “the favorable” economic
environment as well as cost reductions.  ThyssenKrupp, Germany’s largest steelmaker, rose 8.1
percent to 23.23 euros as aluminum, copper, lead, nickel, tin
and zinc all rallied on the London Metal Exchange.  Evotec AG (EVT)  soared 13 percent to 1.96 euros, the biggest
advance in two years. The drug-development company raised its
full-year sales forecast and now predicts that revenue will jump
by about 30 percent to 70 million euros to 72 million euros
after first-half discovery-alliances revenue soared 34 percent
and operating profit more than doubled to 900,000 euros.  -- Editor: Will Hadfield  To contact the reporter on this story:
