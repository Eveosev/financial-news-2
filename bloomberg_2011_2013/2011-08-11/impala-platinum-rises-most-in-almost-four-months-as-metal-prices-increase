Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP) , the
world’s second-largest producer, surged the most in four months
after the metal increased to the highest in a week.  The stock gained as much as 5 percent, the biggest advance
since April 20, to 171.16 rand and closed 2.5 percent higher at
167.13 rand at the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg, paring the
shares’ retreat this year to 28 percent.  Platinum for immediate delivery rallied as much as 1.3
percent to $1,789.75 an ounce in  London , the strongest price
since Aug. 4.  “It’s on the back of better prices, but also that part of
the market has been hit quite hard,” Craig Pheiffer, general
manager of investments at Absa Investments, said by phone. “We
are going to see all these commodity prices at some point be
more reflective of the underlying supply and demand fundamentals
in these markets.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
