Daily loadings of North Sea Aasgard
crude will increase 16 percent in September, according to a
loading program obtained by Bloomberg News.  Nine cargoes will be shipped, one more than this month,
totaling 7.695 million barrels, or 256,500 barrels a day, the
plan showed. That compares with 220,645 barrels a day in August.  Statoil ASA (STL) ,  Norway â€™s largest oil and gas producer,
operates the Aasgard field.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
