The  Federal Reserve  refrained from
intervening in the foreign-exchange markets during the second
quarter of 2011, the central bank reported today.  The Fed’s trade-weighted measure of the U.S. currency
slumped 2 percent, with the dollar falling 2.4 percent versus
the euro and 3.2 percent against the yen, according to the
report.  The current value of the foreign-currency-denominated
assets of the U.S. Treasury’s Exchange Stabilization Fund
totaled $26.9 billion, made up of holdings in the euro and the
yen, the central bank said in the report.  At the end of June, direct holdings of foreign  government
securities  totaled $25.4 billion and repurchase agreements in
foreign currency amounted to $5.4 billion.  Central banks intervene by buying or selling currencies to
influence exchange rates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
