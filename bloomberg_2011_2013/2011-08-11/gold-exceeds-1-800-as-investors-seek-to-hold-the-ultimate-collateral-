Gold extended a rally to an all-time
high, topping $1,800 an ounce, on increased demand for a haven
investment as global equities plunged amid escalating European
and U.S. debt woes.  Immediate-delivery metal rallied as much as 1.2 percent to
$1,814.95 an ounce, and traded at $1,802.60 at 8:55 a.m. in
 Singapore . The December-delivery contract climbed as much as 1.9
percent to $1,817.60 on the Comex in New York, rising for a
fourth straight day.  The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  sank 4.6 percent to
10,719.94 yesterday, the lowest level since September 2010, and
the euro dropped for a second day against the dollar. Asian
stocks extended the global rout today, with the MSCI Asia
Pacific Index falling 1.6 percent. This week, spot gold has
jumped as much as 9.1 percent.  “The race to debase currencies is on,” James Dailey, who
manages $185 million at TEAM Financial Management LLC, said in a
telephone interview from Harrisburg,  Pennsylvania  yesterday.
“Gold will continue to appreciate until there is a fundamental
shift in government policies.”  CME Group Inc. (CME)  increased the initial margin on gold futures
to $7,425 per contract from $6,075 with effect from the close of
business today, according to a website statement. The
maintenance margin will rise to $5,500 from $4,500, it said.  Gold has surged after  Standard & Poor’s  cut the U.S. credit
rating by one level from the top AAA grade on Aug. 5. That S&P
announcement, combined with  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis,
spurred a rout in global equities and stoked concern that the
U.S. may lapse into another recession.  ‘Ultimate Collateral’  “Physical gold is the ultimate collateral because it has no
credit risk,” Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said in a report
dated Aug. 9. The bank raised its 12-month forecast to $2,000 an
ounce on the increased chance for another round of U.S. asset
purchases, known as quantitative easing.  Shares of producers rallied. Stock in Newcrest Mining Ltd.,
 Australia ’s biggest gold producer, surged as much 4.4 percent to
A$40.99 today, while Barrick Gold Corp., the world’s largest
gold miner, climbed as much as 6.3 percent to C$49.77 yesterday.  “The overall problems in the U.S. are far from over, and
the appetite for haven assets like gold is very strong,” said
Viral Shah, vice president at Geojit Comtrade Ltd. in Mumbai.
Investors “want to opt out from the other asset classes, and
that is always going to be to the benefit of gold,” he said.  Spot silver gained as much as 1.4 percent to $39.845 an
ounce, platinum rose as much as 0.4 percent to $1,777 an ounce
and palladium was little changed at $727.75 an ounce.  To contact the reporters for this story:
