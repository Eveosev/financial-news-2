Treasuries fell as stocks rose and a
government report showed initial jobless claims unexpectedly
declined last week, damping demand for safe assets before a $16
billion 30-year bond auction today.  U.S. debt  halted a three-day surge after the 10-year real
yield, which accounts for inflation, dropped to negative 1.45
percent yesterday, approaching the lowest since 2008. The
premium investors earn from 30-year bonds instead of two-year
notes shrank to 3.33 percentage points yesterday, a level not
seen in 10 months.  “Treasuries are weaker today as stocks seem to be
stabilizing and Treasury market is turning its eye to taking
down the supply,” said  Sean Murphy , a trader at Societe
Generale SA in New York, one of the 20 primary dealers that
trade with the  Federal Reserve . “There is still a lot of
uncertainty out there which should help the auction go well.”  Yields on 10-year notes rose 14 basis points, or 0.14
percentage point, to 2.25 percent at 11:54 a.m. in  New York ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2.125 percent
securities maturing in August 2021 traded at 98 31/32.  The yield fell to a record low 2.0346 percent on Aug. 9.
The figure translated into negative 1.57 percent after
subtracting inflation, the lowest real yield since September
2008.  Yield Moves  Thirty-year yields rose 11 basis points to 3.62 percent,
while two-year yields were at 0.18 percent.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 2.7 percent New York
after tumbling as much as 1.8 percent in futures trading
earlier.  The 10-day relative strength index for the 10-year note was
28.4 today. An RSI level below 30 suggests the securities may
change direction.  Treasuries surged this month, pushing 10-year yields down
more than 50 basis points since the start of August, as the
European sovereign debt crisis and a potential double-dip
recession in the U.S. sent the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index down
13 percent.  “The front end is now fully cooked,”  William O’Donnell ,
head U.S. government bond strategist in  Stamford  at Royal Bank
of Scotland group Plc’s RBS Securities unit, wrote in a note to
clients. “Expect the Treasury market to consolidate gains in
the near term. Buy any dips in intermediates; target sub-2
percent 10-year yields.”  Pre-Auction Trading  The 30-year bonds being sold today yielded 3.59 percent in
pre-auction trading, compared with 4.198 percent at the previous
sale of the securities on July 14.  Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes foreign
central banks, bought 37.8 percent of the bonds at the July
sale, compared with the 39.8 percent average for the past 10
auctions.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 21.9 percent of
the securities at the last sale, the most since April 2010 and
compared with an average of 10.6 percent at the past 10
offerings.  Thirty-year bonds have returned 18 percent this year,
compared with a 7.1 percent return for Treasuries overall,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The bonds
have gained 10.8 percent this month, leading the 2.8 percent
gain in overall Treasuries, and are headed for the best month
since December 2008, according to Merrill Lynch Indexes.  Volatile Measure  Volatility in the Treasury market has picked up. Merrill
Lynch & Co.’s MOVE index, which measure price swings in
Treasuries based on prices of over-the-counter options maturing
in two to 30 years, has averaged 96.6 since the start of the
month, more than the 89.3 average since the start of the year.  “Most traders will be extremely cautious in their auction
setups today, given the immense volatility in the marketplace,”
Justin Lederer, an interest-rate strategist at the primary
dealer Cantor Fitzgerald LP in New York, wrote in a research
note to clients. “Today’s auction results will be a total crap
shoot.”  Investors bid for 2.8 times the amount of debt offered last
month, versus an average of 2.64 for the past 10 sales. Indirect
bidders, the investor group that includes foreign central banks,
bought 37.8 percent of the securities, compared with the 10-
auction average of 39.8 percent.  Bid Pattern  A $24 billion 10-year auction yesterday drew higher-than-
average demand and a record low yield of 2.14 percent in the
first offering of the maturity following  Standard & Poor’s 
decision to cut the U.S. longer-term credit rating on Aug. 5.  The bid-to-cover ratio, a gauge of demand that compares
total bids with the amount of securities offered, was 3.22. The
average for the prior 10 sales was 3.11.  Claims for unemployment insurance payments in the U.S.
unexpectedly fell last week to a four-month low, signaling the
recent slowdown in payroll gains is due to a lack of hiring
rather than more firings.  Applications for jobless benefits decreased 7,000 in the
week ended Aug. 6 to 395,000, the fewest since early April, the
Labor Department said today in  Washington . Economists forecast
405,000 claims, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey. The number of people on unemployment benefit rolls
and those getting extended payments also dropped.  Jobless Claims  “The initial jobless claims numbers, while improving, is
still hovering around 400,000,” said  Ian Lyngen , a government
bond strategist at CRT Capital Group LLC in Stamford,
 Connecticut . “This trade report came in with a wider deficit
than expected which suggests lower GDP in the 2nd quarter, which
further weighs on the near-term growth prospects, which supports
Treasuries.”  The  U.S. trade deficit  unexpectedly increased in June to
the highest level since October 2008 as a slump in exports
exceeded a decline in shipments from overseas.  The gap widened 4.4 percent to $53.1 billion from $50.8
billion in the prior month, Commerce Department figures showed
today in Washington. The deficit exceeded all estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey of economists in which the median was $48
billion. Exports declined the most since January 2009.  The difference in yield between two- and 10-year Treasuries
was 2.06 percentage points after touching the least since April
2009 yesterday. The curve is about 60 basis points narrower than
the 2.65 percent it has averaged this year.  A narrower yield difference, or flatter curve, indicates
investors are betting on lower growth and inflation. The
difference widens as investors demand higher compensation to buy
longer-term securities on concern the economy may strengthen,
spurring inflation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
