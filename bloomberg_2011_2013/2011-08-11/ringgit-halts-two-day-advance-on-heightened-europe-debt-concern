Malaysia’s ringgit was little
changed as renewed concern that  Europe ’s debt crisis will worsen
was offset by better-than-forecast factory output data.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of shares dropped 0.5 percent
after relative borrowing costs climbed for  France , even as all
three major ratings companies reaffirmed their top credit grade
for the country. In the U.S., the Standard & Poor’s 500 stock
index fell 4.4 percent. A Malaysian government report yesterday
showed industrial output rose 1 percent in June from a year
earlier, compared with the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey
for a 0.8 percent contraction.  “Elevated concerns that the European debt crisis is
spreading and the weak outlook in the U.S. are weighing on
sentiment,” said Ahmad Fuad Mohd. Yatim, head of foreign
exchange at Kuwait Finance House (M) Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur . “The
ringgit may hover between 3.0 and 3.04 per dollar this week.”  The ringgit traded at 3.0030 per dollar as of 4:29 p.m. in
Kuala Lumpur, compared with 3.0073 yesterday. It fell by as much
as 0.7 percent to 3.0290 earlier, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency strengthened 0.7 percent yesterday.  Malaysia’s government bonds rose as the treasury prepares
to auction 3 billion ringgit ($999 million) of 15-year bonds
tomorrow, according to data published by the central bank on its
website.  The yield on the 4.16 percent notes maturing July 2021
dropped two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.67
percent, prices from Bursa Malaysia show. That was the lowest
since the security was listed in January.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
