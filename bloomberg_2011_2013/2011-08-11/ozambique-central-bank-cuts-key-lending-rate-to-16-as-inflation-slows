Mozambique’s central bank cut its
benchmark  interest rate  by half a percentage point as a stronger
currency helped to curb imported-food costs.  The standing lending facility rate was lowered to 16
percent, the Bank of Mozambique, based in the capital, Maputo,
said in a statement e-mailed today. The reserve requirement for
commercial banks was reduced by a quarter of a percentage point
to 8.75 percent.  Inflation in Maputo, which is tracked by the central bank,
eased to a 15-month low of 7.7 percent in July, compared with
9.3 percent in the previous month, according to the statistics
office. The metical has strengthened 20 percent against the
dollar this year, making it the world’s third-best performing
currency. It trading as high as 26.91 today.  “Food prices have come down this year due to the
appreciation of the metical,” Capranzine Hunguana, assets and
liability manager at First National Bank’s  Mozambique  unit, said
in a phone interview from Maputo today. “The market was
expecting a move as inflation has declined.”  Mozambique, which won independence from  Portugal  in 1974,
is an exporter of aluminum, cashew nuts and sugar. The economy
will probably expand 7.5 percent this year and 7.8 percent in
2012, according to the  International Monetary Fund .  To contact the reporters on this story:
