Japanese stocks fell, pushing the
Nikkei 225 Stock average toward its third weekly loss, as
Europe’s worsening debt crisis damped investor confidence.  Mazda Motor Corp. (7261) , the Japanese carmaker most dependent on
Europe, slumped 4.3 percent.  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s biggest
camera maker by market capitalization, dropped 1.5 percent.
Declines were tempered as companies including  Nikon Corp. (7731)  and
 Sumitomo Rubber Industries Ltd. (5110)  raised earnings forecasts,
saying production rebounded faster than expected from Japan’s
March earthquake disaster.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 0.6 percent to 8,981.94
as of the 3:00 p.m. close in Tokyo, paring earlier losses of as
much as 2.3 percent. The Topix slipped 0.8 percent to 770.88.  “Japanese stocks are relatively solid, but the external
environment won’t settle down,” said Takeshi Fukushima, who
helps manage about $37 billion at Meiji Yasuda Asset Management
Co. “The market’s biggest concern right now is  Europe . If
Europe’s economy slumps, there will be no way to make headway on
the debt issue and the problem will get worse.”  The Topix has fallen 10 percent this month even as
companies posted earnings that beat estimates. Of the 1,437
companies in the gauge that have reported earnings since July 11,
220 exceeded estimates, while 120 fell short, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Machinery Orders  Declines in Japanese stocks were limited today after a
report showed machinery orders rose for a second month in June
as companies replace equipment damaged in the March disaster.
Bookings rose 7.7 percent from the previous month. Economists
predicted a 1.7 percent increase  Stocks also trimmed losses after the yen weakened
temporarily following comments by Finance Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  that signaled the government may sell its currency again.
Movements in the yen, which is trading near a postwar high
against the dollar, continue to be one-sided even after the
government on Aug. 4 intervened to protect Japanese exporters,
Noda said.  Equity markets worldwide have lost more than $7 trillion
since July 26 in a rout that deepened after Standard & Poor’s
Ratings Service cut the U.S.’s credit rating last week. Stocks
from Tokyo to  New York  have fallen as the  U.S. economy  shows
signs of slowing and the European debt crisis threatens to
spread.  Europe Crisis  Mazda Motor, which gets about 18 percent of sales from
countries including Germany, U.K., and Russia, slumped 4.3
percent to 177 yen. Canon, which counts the continent as its
biggest market, fell 1.5 percent to 3,400 yen.  Speculation France will become embroiled in the region’s
crisis drove up the price of credit default swaps on the
country’s bonds. Societe Generale SA, France’s second-biggest
lender, plunged 15 percent. Larger BNP Paribas SA, which last
week said it may miss its 2012 earnings target because of write
downs on Greek government debt, sank 9.5 percent.  “Concern is mounting about damage to the financial
system,” said  Mitsushige Akino , who oversees about $600 million
in  Tokyo  at Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co. “We may slip
back into a global equity slump.”  Japanese banks fell today. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group
Inc., the country’s biggest lender, slid 1.9 percent to 357 yen.
Smaller rival Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. dropped 1.8
percent to 2,225 yen.  Crude Prices  Oil companies  also declined after crude prices dropped as
much as 2.1 in electronic trading in New York. Inpex Corp.,
Japan’s biggest oil explorer, decreased 1.6 percent to 503,000
yen.  AOC Holdings Inc. (5017) , an oil explorer and refiner, slipped 2.1
percent to 459 yen.  Nikon jumped 8.2 percent to 1,750 yen, leading stocks that
reported better earnings higher. The company, which rose the
most on the  Nikkei 225 (NKY) , boosted its profit outlook by 43 percent
to 60 billion yen ($783 million) for the year ending March 31.
The March disaster has had a smaller-than-expected impact, the
company said. Nikon also increased its planned first-half
dividend to 17 yen per share from 10 yen.  Sumitomo Rubber, Japan’s second-biggest tiremaker by
revenue, climbed 4 percent to 943 yen. The company boosted its
full-year profit forecast by 74 percent to 20 billion yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
