Republican Senator  Orrin Hatch  of
 Utah  called on U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy Geithner  today to
provide a contingency plan for “dealing with market turmoil”
in the event of further credit ratings downgrades or impasses
over the U.S. debt limit.  Hatch, the top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee,
said in a letter to Geithner that the Aug. 2 deadline that the
Treasury Department set for Congress to approve an increase in
the U.S. debt ceiling was “elusive.”  Hatch said Geithner was not responsive to him in an earlier
inquiry about the Treasury’s short-term cash flow projections
around that date. The Treasury’s closing operating cash balance
was more than $54 billion on August 2, he pointed out.  “Your response concerning cash flows was elusive,
identifying August 2nd as still being the date that Treasury
expected ‘to exhaust the extraordinary measures we have employed
to extend our borrowing authority in the absence of
congressional action to increase the debt limit,’” Hatch wrote,
citing Geithner’s earlier response to him. “I asked about
projections of cash exhaustion and not solely about exhaustion
of measures to extend borrowing authority.”  Hatch requested more information about contingency plans in
the event of further downgrades, after  Standard & Poor’s  lowered
the nation’s AAA rating to AA+. Two other ratings services have
maintained the highest rating for Treasuries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
