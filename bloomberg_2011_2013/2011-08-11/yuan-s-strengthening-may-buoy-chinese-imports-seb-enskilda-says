Gains by  China ’s currency may fuel
imports into the country by supporting purchases of cheaper
goods abroad, SEB Enskilda analyst Nikolaj Kamedula said.  The yuan strengthened beyond 6.4 to the dollar for the
first time in 17 years today, supported by the Federal Reserve’s
pledge to keep interest rates at a record low. A stronger
currency may reduce import prices for raw materials.  “If the domestic market can hold its consumption rate, we
will see more imports,” said Kamedula.  China, the world’s largest consumer of  iron ore , will
import 652 million metric tons of the steelmaking ingredient in
2011, up 8 percent, according to Clarkson Research Services
Ltd., a unit of the largest shipbroker. The country is the top
global steel producer.  China’s currency gained the most since November and 12-
month non-deliverable forwards climbed to a three-month high
after the central bank’s daily fixing had its biggest jump of
2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
