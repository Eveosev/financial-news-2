Japan may cut its growth forecast
for the year ending March as the U.K. sees headwinds
intensifying and the Federal Reserve signals that weakness in
the  U.S. economy  may extend through mid-2013.  The government will reduce the forecast to 0.5 percent from
a previous 1.5 percent estimate,  Kyodo News  and the Nikkei
reported today, without citing anyone. The new figure would
compare with a  Bank of Japan  estimate of 0.4 percent. An
official at the cabinet office said he wasn’t able to confirm
the media reports.  Japanese stocks declined today, with the benchmark  Nikkei
225 (NKY)  Stock Average heading for a third week of losses as a global
equity rout weakens confidence and worsens the outlook for
exports. The cut to the growth forecast will reflect damage to
the economy from the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that left
more than 20,000 people dead or missing and triggered a nuclear
crisis, Kyodo said.  The Kyodo report said that the following year’s expansion
may be in the high 2 percent range.  Bank of England Governor Mervyn King said yesterday that
“headwinds” buffeting the U.K. economy are intensifying “by
the day” and officials can expand stimulus if the outlook for
growth deteriorates further. The Federal Reserve plans to keep
its key rate at a record low at least through mid-2013 and has
pledged additional measures as needed, while the  European
Central Bank  has resumed bond purchases.  To contact the reporter on this story:
