Japanese and Australian stock
futures rose as fewer jobless claims in the U.S. and higher
corporate earnings overshadowed concern Europe’s debt crisis is
worsening.  American depositary receipts of  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s
biggest camera maker, jumped 4.8 percent from the closing share
price in  Tokyo  after the company said it will buy back its own
shares. Those of Toyota Motor Corp., the largest global carmaker
that counts  North America  as its biggest market, climbed 1.4
percent. ADRs of  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s largest mining
company and Australia’s No. 1 oil producer, advanced 2 percent
after crude and metal prices increased.  Futures on  Japan ’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average expiring in
September closed at 9,070 in  Chicago  yesterday, compared with
8,980 in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,060
in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on  Australia ’s S&P/ASX
200 Index climbed 1.8 percent today.  New Zealand ’s NZX 50 Index,
the first market to open in the Asia-Pacific region, gained 1.6
percent in Wellington.  “The latest U.S. jobs data and earnings results are a
reasonable indicator of the health of the economy and may
suggest that things are not as dire as the markets had feared,”
said Prasad Patkar, who helps manage the equivalent of $1.7
billion at Sydney-based Platypus Asset Management Ltd. “However,
fundamentals are not really driving stock markets at the moment.
To a large extent, we may be getting a bounce because they are
oversold.”  U.S. Stocks Rebound  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.2 percent
today. In  New York , the index surged 4.6 percent to 1,172.64
yesterday, reversing the previous day’s drop, as a decline in
jobless claims and better-than-estimated corporate earnings
tempered concern  Europe ’s debt crisis is worsening. The gauge
had plunged as much as 18 percent from its 2011 high.  Claims for U.S. unemployment benefits unexpectedly dropped
last week to a four-month low, signaling the job market is being
hampered by a lack of hiring rather than more firings.  A separate report showed that the  U.S. trade deficit 
unexpectedly increased in June to the highest level since
October 2008 as a slump in exports exceeded a decline in imports.  U.S. stocks were also boosted by better-than estimated
earnings at companies from Cisco Systems Inc., the world’s
largest maker percent of networking equipment, to Rupert
Murdoch’s News Corp.  Japanese Profits  Among the 1,453 Japanese companies in the Topix index that
posted quarterly earnings results since July 11, 203 beat the
average analyst profit estimate, while 120 reported
disappointing results, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 11 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with drops of 6.8 percent by the S&P
500 and 16.4 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in
the Asian benchmark are valued at 12.3 times estimated earnings
on average, compared with 11.8 times for the S&P 500 and 9.4
times for the Stoxx 600.  Crude oil for September delivery climbed 3.4 percent to
settle at $85.72 a barrel in New York yesterday. The London
Metal Exchange Index of prices for six industrial metals
including copper and aluminum jumped 3.1 percent yesterday, the
most since March 17.  The yen depreciated to 76.94 against the dollar, compared
with 76.62 at the close of  stock trading  in Tokyo yesterday.
Against the euro, Japan’s currency weakened to 109.73 from
108.99. A weaker yen boosts the value of overseas income at
Japanese companies when converted into their home currency.  Share Buyback  Canon will spend as much as 50 billion yen ($650 million)
to buy back up to 1.2 percent of its outstanding shares, it said
in a statement to the Tokyo Stock Exchange yesterday.  Taiheiyo Cement Corp. (5233) , a Japanese cement maker, which had
delayed its earnings forecast because of March’s earthquake,
said full-year net income will probably rise to 11.3 billion yen
from 4.45 billion yen a year earlier.  The company will pay an annual dividend of 4 yen per share
this year, up from the previous year’s payout of 2.5 yen,
according to a statement to the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  To contact the reporters on this story:
