Alastair Cook ’s century helped
England take a 95-run lead over India at tea on day two of the
third cricket Test at Edgbaston in Birmingham.  Cook is 129 not out to push England to 319-2 in reply to
India’s first-innings’ 224 all out. He and captain Andrew
Strauss, who scored 87, formed an opening stand of 186.  Kevin
Pietersen  is on 36, and Ian Bell was out for 34.  England won the first two Tests in the four-match
series. It can replace India as No. 1 in the International
Cricket Council rankings with another victory or by drawing the
final two matches.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
