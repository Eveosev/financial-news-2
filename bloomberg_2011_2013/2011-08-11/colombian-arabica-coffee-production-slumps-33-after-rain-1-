Colombia , the world’s second-largest
supplier of arabica coffee beans, trimmed its production
forecast for the year by about 5.6 percent after last month’s
crop slumped because of adverse weather.  Production will likely be 9 million bags,  Colombia’s
National Coffee Growers Federation  Chief Executive Officer Luis
Munoz told reporters today in Bogota, down from a forecast of
9.5 million bags in May. Output in July tumbled to about 530,000
bags from 787,000 bags a year earlier, the federation said.  Storms in Colombia have hurt a recovery in the nation’s
harvest from a 33-year low in 2009. Global stockpiles are enough
to supply about two months of consumption, which may keep coffee
prices above $2 a pound, according to Munoz.  “There isn’t any inventory,” he said. “The market should
have a floor of about $2.”  Arabica coffee for December delivery rose 5.70 cents, or
2.4 percent, to $2.4405 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York 
as of 2 p.m. New York time.  Concern about economic growth in the U.S. hasn’t reduced
consumption, he said.  Colombia’s crop slumped 40 percent in June to 471,000 bags
from 780,000 bags a year earlier, the federation had said.  Brazil  is the largest producer of arabica coffee beans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
