Uchumi Supermarkets Ltd.,  Kenya ’s
only publicly traded retailer, rose for the first time in five
days after sinking below a key level of an indicator used in
technical analysis.  The shares jumped 4.7 percent to 8.95 shillings by the 3
p.m. close in the capital, Nairobi.  Uchumi’s 14-day relative strength index reached 19
yesterday, below the 30 level that signals to some technical
analysts a security is poised to rise. The RSI, as the index is
known, identifies possible turning points in indexes or
securities by measuring the degree that gains and losses outpace
each other in a given period.  Yesterday, the stock tumbled 6 percent to 8.55 shillings,
the lowest level since May 1997. Uchumi shares have lost 38
percent of their value since May 31, when they resumed trading
after a five-year suspension due to bankruptcy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
