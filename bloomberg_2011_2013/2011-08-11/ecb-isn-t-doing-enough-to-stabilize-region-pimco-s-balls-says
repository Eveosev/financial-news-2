The  European Central Bank  isn’t
doing enough to stabilize the region’s financial system as the
debt crisis persists, said Andrew Balls, head of European
 portfolio management  at Pacific Investment Management Co.  “If there is a significant problem in Spain and Italy,
then this is going to impact the rest of the  euro zone , the
banking system and the core,” Balls said in an interview with
Bloomberg Television’s Sara Eisen today. “That’s why it’s so
important what the ECB is doing. Yes, they are maintaining
stability in terms of Italian and Spanish spreads, but what you
are seeing is what they are doing is not enough to try stabilize
the overall system.”  The ECB is buying Spanish and Italian bonds to try and stem
the spread of the region’s sovereign debt markets. The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  fell to the lowest level since September
yesterday as banks slumped on concern that the purchases will
fail to contain the crisis and that the  U.S. economy  is
faltering.  “In the case of the ECB, if they choose to, if they’re
willing to do it, they have a lot of power to stabilize the
situation, stabilize the banking system,” Balls said. “I’m
sure that the U.S., other G-7, G-20 countries, are on the phone
saying, ‘You need to take care of business, you need to
stabilize your system.’”  To contact the reporters on this story:
