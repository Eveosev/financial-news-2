Royal Philips Electronics NV, the
worldâ€™s largest maker of lighting, is recalling 1.86 million
 light bulbs  because they can cause cuts, the U.S. Consumer
Product Safety Commission said.  Philips has received 700 reports of the glass globe falling
after the glue that attaches it to the bulb body fails, the
commission said today in a statement. Two injuries and three
instances of property damage have been reported, the Washington-
based agency said.  The recall applies to three EnergySaver and Marathon
models, compact fluorescent bulbs usually used in recessed
lighting. They were manufactured by Philips Lighting Co., a
Somerset, New Jersey-based unit of the Amsterdam-based company,
and sold from March 2007 to July 2011.  Consumers should stop using the lamps and call Philips at
1-866-622-6372 for instructions on getting a free replacement,
the CPSC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
