More executives at Standard & Poor’s
500 Index companies are buying their stock than any time since
the depths of the credit crisis after valuations plunged 25
percent below their five-decade average.  Sixty-six insiders at 50 companies bought shares between
Aug. 3 and Aug. 9, the most since the five days ended March 9,
2009, when the benchmark index for U.S. equities reached a 12-
year low, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Morgan
Stanley (MS)  Chief Executive Officer  James Gorman  and two other
managers purchased 175,000 shares of the New York-based bank as
the shares fell to the lowest level since March 2009, according
to filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Almost $3 trillion has been erased from U.S. equity values
in the last three weeks as signs the economy is slowing and
S&P’s downgrade of the government’s AAA credit rating left the
benchmark gauge for U.S. shares within 30 points of a  bear
market . Some analysts say insider buying is bullish because
executives have the best information about their prospects.  “Nobody knows a company better than the people running
it,” Shawn Price, who manages $2.4 billion at Navellier &
Associates Inc. in Reno,  Nevada , said in a telephone interview.
“It’s a positive sign that they are committing their personal
capital.”  Stocks Drop  CEOs, directors and senior officers bought stock as the S&P
500 fell 18 percent from this year’s high on April 29 on concern
about  Europe ’s debt crisis and the political battle over the
U.S. debt ceiling. The index is trading at 12.3 times earnings
in the past year, compared with its average since 1954 of 16.4,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Gorman’s purchase of 100,000 shares was his first since
joining Morgan Stanley in 2006 and the biggest stock acquisition
among the firm’s executives in more than four years, according
to Princeton, New Jersey-based InsiderScore.com, which analyzes
insider transactions. Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat and
Paul J. Taubman, co-head of the firm’s investment bank, also
bought stock.  Morgan Stanley fell 19 percent from July 21 through Aug. 4,
the day of Gorman’s purchase. It has lost 17 percent since,
falling to $16.45 yesterday, the lowest level since January
2009, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  General Motors Co. (GM)  CEO Dan Akerson purchased $250,500 in
shares of the automaker on Aug. 9, a day before the stock fell
6.3 percent to $23.92, the lowest level since its November
initial public offering and down 35 percent for 2011. Akerson
bought 10,000 shares for $25.05 each, bringing his total to
103,600, Detroit-based GM said in a regulatory filing.  MEMC Electronic  CEO Ahmad Chatila and five other officers at  MEMC
Electronic Materials Inc. (WFR) , which has a price-earnings ratio of
8.4, bought a combined 468,057 shares of the silicon-wafer maker
on Aug. 5, when the stock sank to the lowest level since October
2002, regulatory filings showed. Shares of the St. Peters,
Missouri-based company rallied 19 percent to $5.93 on Aug. 9,
when the transactions were disclosed.  Robert Hugin, the chairman and CEO of Summit, New Jersey-
based  Celgene Corp. (CELG) , bought shares of the maker of blood-cancer
drugs for the first time since at least 2003, according to data
compiled by InsiderScore. Hugin acquired 10,000 shares on Aug.
8, when the stock fell to a five-month low, while Chief
Financial Officer Jackie Fouse bought shares three times this
month, according to SEC filings. The stock climbed 4.2 percent
on Aug. 9 and closed at $51.85 yesterday, down 12 percent for
the year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Insiders Buying  A total of 919 insiders bought stock among all publicly
listed U.S. companies between Aug. 1 and yesterday, data
compiled by InsiderScore show. That compares with a monthly
average of 1,065 transactions in data going back to January
2004. About 1,390 insiders bought during the first 10 days of
March 2009, InsiderScore data show.  Executives at 14  S&P 500  companies sold shares between Aug.
3 and Aug. 9, according to Bloomberg data, bringing the ratio of
those with buyers and those with sellers to 7 to 2. Since the
beginning of 2004, there have been on average 3.08 companies in
the S&P 500 with sellers for every company with buyers,
according to InsiderScore.  “It’s a fire sale and the insiders are stepping up to buy
at these prices,” Daniel Genter, who oversees about $3.7
billion as president of Los Angeles-based RNC Genter Capital
Management, said in a telephone interview. “The insiders are
saying that the lower valuation is unreasonable because they
believe the earnings power of their companies is likely to go
up.”  Rising Profits  Earnings per share increased 17 percent among the S&P 500
companies that have released quarterly results since July 11,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. About three-quarters of
the companies have topped the average analyst profit forecast,
the data show. Sales rose 13 percent during that period.  Insider behavior doesn’t always foreshadow stock moves,
according to  Michael Yoshikami , chief investment strategist at
YCMNet Advisors. Selling by S&P 500 executives reached a record
in November as the index was in the midst of a 33 percent rally
from July 2 to April 29, 2011. They increased sales in August
2009 when the S&P 500 was halfway through an advance in which it
doubled, data compiled by Bloomberg and InsiderScore show.  “It’s not a perfect indicator,” Yoshikami, who manages
about $1 billion in Walnut Creek,  California , said in a
telephone interview. “Insiders can be wrong and get carried
away by emotion. Just think about all the technology executives
who didn’t sell at the highs because they were overly
optimistic.”  The end of earnings season leads to an increase in insider
transactions because executives are prevented from buying or
selling before announcements, according to Ben Silverman, the
Seattle-based research director at InsiderScore. Of the
companies in the S&P 500, 427 have reported results since July
11, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  U.S. laws require executives and directors to disclose
stock purchases or sales within two business days. The data
don’t include transactions related to options and so-called
10b5-1 programs, which allow executives to cash out a portion of
their holdings when stocks reach predetermined prices.  To contact the reporters on this story:
