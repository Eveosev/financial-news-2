Norway ’s ruling  Labor Party  has
risen 6.5 percentage points after the July 22 twin terror
attacks, a poll by Norstat for next month’s municipal elections
showed.  The party led by Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg was
supported by 34.2 percent of voters, an increase of 4.6
percentage points from municipal elections in 2007 and 6.5
percentage points from July, according to the poll published
today on the  website  of Oslo-based broadcaster NRK.  Anders Behring Breivik, who has admitted to carrying out
both attacks, began eight weeks of pre-trial detention on July
26 after telling a court hearing that he wanted to inflict the
“greatest possible loss” on the Labor Party and halt what he
saw as an “Islamization” of Norway and  Europe .  The poll, based on 962 interviews from Aug. 2 to Aug. 8,
also showed that support for the opposition Conservatives
slipped 3.9 percentage points to 25.2 percent from July, while
backing for the Progress Party rose 0.5 percentage point to 16
percent in the period.  Municipal elections will be held on Sept. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
