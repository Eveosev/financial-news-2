The Ukrainian city of Odessa faces
difficulties in servicing its $40 million Swiss-franc
denominated debt to BNP Paribas,  Interfax-Ukraine   news agency 
reported, citing Mayor Oleksiy Kostusev.  Kostusev said today at the cityâ€™s administration meeting
that he asked the  Finance Ministry  to help but so far has not
received any assistance, according to Interfax.  Odessa received the BNP Pariba loan, which pays an annual
interest rate of 8.5 percent and matures on Dec. 30 next year,
in 2007, Interfax said. The city pays a coupon every quarter,
according to the news agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
