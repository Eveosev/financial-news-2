Hong Kong  stocks fell for a seventh
day in eight as concern mounted that Europe will fail to contain
its debt crisis, slowing the global economy.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Europe’s largest bank by market value,
slumped 2.9 percent.  Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) , the U.K.’s second-
biggest bank by market capitalization, declined 3.9 percent.

The Hang Seng  China  Enterprises Index declined 0.7 percent to
10,502.73. The measure of Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong
earlier dropped as much as 2.8 percent.  “The spread of  Europe ’s debt crisis is a major concern for
the market,” said Linus Yip, chief strategist at First Shanghai
Securities in Hong Kong. “But for Hong Kong, there are some
buying interests. It’s at a valuable level right now, triggering
long-term funds to come in. The market may have some good
support at the current level.”  The Hang Seng Index is in a  bear market  after falling 22
percent from its high in November 2010. The equity benchmark has
lost 15 percent this year, the worst performance among Asia’s
five developed stock markets, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Shares on the index traded at 10.5 times forecast
earnings, compared with 11.3 times for the  S&P 500 .  Banks Decline  HSBC slid 2.9 percent to HK$67, and  Standard Chartered 
declined 3.9 percent to HK$176.90.  Financial shares across Europe and the U.S. plunged
yesterday amid concern that the debt crisis in countries from
 Greece  to Italy and France is worsening. The gauge of banks,
brokerages and insurers in the Hang Seng Composite Index slipped
1.3 percent today.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 1.8 percent
today. In  New York  yesterday, the S&P 500 fell 4.4 percent as
banks slumped on concern Europe will fail to contain its debt
crisis and that the  U.S. economy  is faltering.  Contracts to insure French government debt against default
for five years increased 13 basis points to 174.5 basis points
yesterday, according to data by CMA, which is owned by CME Group
Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market.  Tencent Misses Estimates  Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700) , a Shenzhen-based  Internet company ,
slumped 4.7 percent to HK$181.60 after reporting second-quarter

7.3 percent to HK$33.25. China National Building Material Co., a
cement maker, slid 5.5 percent to HK$13.34.  China Railway Group Ltd., a builder of the nation’s rail
