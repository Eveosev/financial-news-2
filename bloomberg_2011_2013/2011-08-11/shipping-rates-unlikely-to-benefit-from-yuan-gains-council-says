Shipping rates probably will feel
little direct effect from the strengthening of China’s currency
to a 17-year high, according to the Baltic and International
Maritime Council.  The yuan rose beyond 6.4 to the dollar for the first time
in 17 years, supported by the  Federal Reserve ’s pledge to keep
 interest rates  at a record low and signs China will use currency
gains to help rein in inflation. A stronger yuan may reduce
import prices for raw materials. The country is the world’s
biggest consumer of energy,  iron ore  and industrial metals.  “If imports get cheaper, we could hope that it will boost
consumption and transportation, but the currency move is
definitely not the most important factor to watch out for right
now,” Peter Sand, an analyst at the Bagsvaerd, Denmark-based
council, said by phone today. “You need consumers to get back
to the stores and start buying instead.”  The council represents owners of two-thirds of the world’s
merchant fleet, its website shows.  China ’s currency rose the most since November and 12-month
non-deliverable forwards climbed to a three-month high after the
central bank’s daily fixing had its biggest jump of 2011. The
Baltic Dry Index, a gauge of costs to ship dry-bulk commodities
such as coal and grains, has dropped 28 percent this year, on
course for a second annual decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
