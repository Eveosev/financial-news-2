The sugar cane crop in  Brazil ’s
Center South, the world’s largest producing region, may fall
below 515 million metric tons in the 2011-12 season, according
to Armajaro Trading Ltd.  Brazil’s industry group Unica estimated the crop at 533.5
million tons on July 13, and is scheduled to update the forecast
at 6 p.m. London time. Sao Paulo-based consultancy Datagro
expects a crop of 517.36 million tons, while Archer Consulting,
also in  Sao Paulo , says the consensus is 515 million tons.  “I would suspect 515 million tons is a more reasonable
target at the moment, but I would not be at all surprised to see
the crop fall further,” Guy Toller, sugar director at Armajaro
Trading, the supplier of cocoa, coffee and sugar owned by
Anthony Ward’s Armajaro Holdings Ltd., said in an interview on
Aug. 8 at the company’s offices in London  Sugar climbed 13 percent in  New York  last month as Unica
said the Center South sugar output would fall for the first
time in six years. The price dropped 7.5 percent this month
on speculation demand would begin to slow. Sugar fell to 26.38|
 cents a pound on Aug. 8, the lowest since July 1.  “The lower Brazil crop was fully priced in at 31 cents a
pound, but now at about 26 cents a pound, I’m not sure,” Toller
said in the interview.  The current surplus projections for the 2011-12 season are
probably optimistic, Toller said. Rabobank International expects
a surplus of 9.8 million tons in the period. Macquarie Group
Ltd. says supplies will outpace demand by at least 5 million
tons, while Czarnikow Sugar Futures Ltd. estimates supplies will
exceed demand by 10.3 million tons.  “Most people are factoring in optimal crop expectations,
and there isn’t very much slack in the numbers for any weather
problems that may occur,” Toller said. “There is a forward
surplus developing in the market, but the question is when it
will be available for the market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
