There were no deliveries of coffee to
ports in  Ivory Coast ,  Africa ’s third-biggest producer of the
beans, in the week to Aug. 7, according to a document obtained
from the industry regulator.  Arrivals since the start of the marketing season on Jan. 1
total 20,268 metric tons, the document from the Abidjan-based
Bourse du Cafe et du Cacao showed.  Ivory Coast  mainly grows
robusta beans, a variety used in instant coffee and espresso.
Ethiopia and Uganda are the continent’s top coffee growers.  To contact the reporters on this story:
