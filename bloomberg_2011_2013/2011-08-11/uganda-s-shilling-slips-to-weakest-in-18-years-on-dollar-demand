Uganda ’s shilling, the world’s
worst-performing currency against the dollar this year, weakened
to an 18-year low, driven by demand for the U.S. currency by oil
importers and telecommunication companies.  The currency of East  Africa ’s third-biggest economy
depreciated 1.3 percent to 2,780 per dollar at 3:56 p.m. in the
capital, Kampala, the weakest level since June 1993, according
to Bloomberg data.  “We have a very lean market and yet there is demand by the
fuel sector and telecommunication companies,” Timothy Muzoora,
a currency trader at Cairo Bank Ltd., said by phone from
Kampala. “Telecommunication companies import equipments and
there are remittances they pay.”  Uganda, Africa’s second-biggest coffee producer, is on the
cusp of an oil boom with Tullow Oil Plc, a U.K.-based energy
company, is expected to start pumping crude and gas from the
Lake Albert Basin in 2012. The country has an estimated 2.5
billion barrels of oil, with about 1 billion barrels in proven
reserves, according to Tullow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
