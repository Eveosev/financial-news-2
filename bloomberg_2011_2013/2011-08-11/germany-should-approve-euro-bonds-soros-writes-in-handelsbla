Germany ’s government should agree on
the issue of euro bonds to help protect the euro,  George Soros ,
the billionaire investor, wrote in Handelsblatt.  “Only Germany can reverse the dynamic of a European
decay,” Soros wrote in the Dusseldorf-based newspaper.
“Germany and other countries with a AAA rating have to approve
some sort of euro-bond regime. Otherwise, the euro will
implode.”  German  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s reaction to the
sovereign-debt crisis has been too slow, Soros also wrote. “The
next step” should be an expansion of the European rescue fund.
“But by the time we get there,  France ’s AAA rating could be in
danger,” Soros wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
