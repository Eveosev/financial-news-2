Italian and Spanish two-year notes
opened lower, declining for a second day.  The yield on two-year Italian securities climbed 10 basis
points to 3.61 percent as of 7:44 a.m. in  London , while the
yield on similar-maturity Spanish notes increased eight basis
points to 3.29 percent. Belgian notes also dropped, sending the

less than one basis point higher at 5.10 percent, narrowing the
difference in yield, or spread, with benchmark German bunds by
three basis points to 287 basis points. The Spanish-German 10-
year yield spread tightened five basis points to 278 basis
