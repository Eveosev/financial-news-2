The U.S. government is imposing
sanctions on four state-owned companies in Belarus, State
Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said today.  The sanctions build on those imposed in January in response
to government repression of dissent, Nuland told reporters in
 Washington . She called on the regime to release political
prisoners.  The four companies targeted for sanctions are the Belshina
tire factory; Grodno Azot, which makes fertilizer; Grodno
Khimvolokno, a fiber manufacturer; and Naftan, an oil refinery,
according to a State Department press release.  Those companies were determined to be owned or controlled
by the Belneftekhim conglomerate, which was already targeted by
previous sanctions, the State Department said.  President  Barack Obama  in May announced his intent to levy
additional sanctions in response to the continued incarceration
of political prisoners in Belarus and a government crackdown on
political activists and journalists.  The sanctions target those responsible for the repression
in Belarus following the Dec. 19 presidential elections, the
State Department said.  “They are not designed to harm the people of Belarus,”
Nuland said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
