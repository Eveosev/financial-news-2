Russia ’s largest steelmakers asked
the government to impose a 22.5 percent duty on cold-rolled
polymer-coated steel from  China  as an anti-dumping measure.  China exported 216,451 metric tons to Russia in the first
half of the year, 10 times more than in the same period of 2009,
according to Russian Steel, a lobby representing the country’s
eight largest steelmakers including OAO Severstal and OAO
Novolipetsk Steel. The Chinese product was sold 11 percent more
cheaply than the local going rate, the lobby said in an e-mailed
statement that cited data from the Russian Federal Customs
Service.  Russia began an anti-dumping probe in February after
complaints from steelmakers about Chinese imports of cold-rolled
steel with polymer coating. The lobby has asked the government
to impose duties on the imports immediately rather than wait for
the inquiry to finish, according to the statement.  “We aren’t commenting on this question until the end of
the probe,” Aliona Shipilina, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of
Industry and Trade, said by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
