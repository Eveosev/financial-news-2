Komercni Banka AS (KOMB)  jumped, ending a
seven-day, 24 percent drop, after its owner,  Societe Generale (GLE) 
SA, rejected market speculation on the company’s stability and
 Standard & Poor’s  and Moody’s Investors Service affirmed
France’s top bond ratings.  The stock rose 4.8 percent to 3,040 koruna by 10:25 a.m. in
Prague. A close at that level would mark the biggest one-day
gain in more than eight months. The Czech bank fell 10 percent
yesterday to 2,900 koruna, its lowest in more than two years.  European shares and U.S. index futures rose after a rout in
global stock markets since July 26 dragged valuations in Europe
and the U.S. to the lowest in 2 1/2 years, prompting investors
to start buying again. SocGen jumped as much as 8.9 percent
after the bank denied that a worsening in  France ’s
creditworthiness would damage the company’s stability.  There was pressure toward the end of yesterday’s session
over concern that France’s credit rating would be lowered, J&T
Banka in Prague wrote in a report today, adding: “We expect
that Komercni Banka’s shares will erase a part of yesterday’s
loss right after open.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
