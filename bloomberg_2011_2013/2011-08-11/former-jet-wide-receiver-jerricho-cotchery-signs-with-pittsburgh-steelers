Receiver Jerricho Cotchery agreed to
a one-year contract with the Pittsburgh Steelers today a week
after he was cut by the  New York Jets .  Financial terms weren’t disclosed. Steelers spokesman Burt
Lauten confirmed the signing in an e-mail.  Cotchery, 29, was slowed last season by a herniated disk in
his back and finished fifth on the Jets with 41 catches for 433
yards, while making five starts.  Cotchery led  New York  in catches and receiving yardage from
2007 to 2009. He was the franchise’s fourth-round pick in the
2004 National Football League draft and took over as a starter
two years later. He had a career-high 1,130 yards receiving in
2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
