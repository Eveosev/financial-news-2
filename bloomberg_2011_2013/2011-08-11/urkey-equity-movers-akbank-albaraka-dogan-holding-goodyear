Turkey ’s benchmark  ISE National 100
Index (XU100)  rose 448.70, or 0.9 percent, to 50,756.33 at 4:40 p.m. in
Istanbul, bringing the week’s losses to 9.8 percent.  The following stocks were active. Symbols are in
parentheses.  Akbank TAS (AKBNK)  , a lender part-owned by Citigroup
Inc., rose 20 kurus, or 3.6 percent, to 5.8 liras. The bank was
the biggest mover by index points on the exchange. The overall
banking index gained 0.8 percent.  Albaraka Turk Katilim Bankasi AS (ALBRK)  , an Islamic
bank, dropped 4 kurus, or 2.2 percent to 1.81 liras. The bank
said after the close yesterday that second-quarter profit
increased to 29.7 million liras ($17 million), missing analysts’
estimates.  Dogan Sirketler Grubu Holdings (DOHOL)  AS, a holding
with interests in banking, media and energy, headed for its
biggest gain since February, adding 7 kurus, or 13 percent, to
63 kurus. The company is predominantly locally owned and has
been one of the most volatile in recent weeks, according to
broker Adil Rizvi at EFG Istanbul Securities, who said it was
“fundamentally cheap” in terms of cash level and market value.  Zorlu Enerji Elektrik Uretim AS (ZOREN)  , the electrical
utility owned by Zorlu Holding, jumped as much as 3 percent

from the stock market. The shares pared gains to 1.2 percent to
trade at 1.68 liras.  To contact the reporter on this story:
