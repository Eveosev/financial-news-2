Cash premiums for U.S. corn shipped
in August to export terminals near  New Orleans  fell relative to
Chicago futures as farmers increased sales after prices rose.
The soybean basis was unchanged.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for corn delivered this
month was 78 cents above September futures, down from 78 cents
to 80 cents yesterday, U.S. Department of Agriculture  data  show.
Bids for delivery in September and October fell as much as 2
cents. The soybean premium was 58 cents to 64 cents.  “We saw a slight increase in farmer selling earlier
today,” Tim Emslie, the research manager for Inver Grove
Heights, Minnesota-based Country Hedging Inc., said in a
telephone interview. “Farmers will be harvesting corn by early
September” in parts of the Midwest, after unusually hot weather
in July accelerated plant maturity, Emslie said.  Corn futures for September delivery rose 24.5 cents, or 3.6
percent, to close at $7.025 a bushel on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the biggest increase for the contract since Aug. 2 and 62
percent higher than a year earlier.  Soybean futures for November delivery rose 30.25 cents, or
2.3 percent, to $13.3175 a bushel on the CBOT, the biggest gain
for the contract since May 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
