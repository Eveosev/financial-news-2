Syria ’s government will approve a
law allowing investment funds in two days after the Syrian
Commission on Financial Markets and Securities completed its
text, Al Watan newspaper reported.  Syrian investment funds will be allowed to invest in traded
stocks and bonds of domestic companies, government-issued
Treasury bonds and units of investment companies and funds, the
Damascus-based newspaper said today, citing a draft of the law.
A fund must have at least 50 million pounds ($1.05 million) of
capital, it reported.  Fund founders must contribute at least 10 percent and no
more than 75 percent of a fund’s capital, according to the
newspaper. They can sell their holdings after their fund’s third
year,  Al Watan  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
