The Polish central bank may try to
stop further zloty losses “in the coming days” using its
foreign-currency reserves, according to Danske Bank A/S.  “ Poland  has relatively large foreign-currency reserves and
so the  National Bank of Poland  could, in the near term, easily
intervene in the markets to curb the selling of zloty,” Danske
analyst Lars Christensen in Copenhagen wrote in a report today.
“We would certainly not rule out the possibility of the NBP
intervening in the coming days if the selloff continues.”  The zloty today slid as much as 1.3 percent to 4.2426 per
euro, its weakest level in 15 months, and traded at 4.1949 as of
3:28 p.m. in Warsaw. The Polish currency has lost 4.8 percent so
far this month, compared with a 2.4 percent drop for  Hungary ’s
forint. The Czech koruna is little changed in the same period.  European shares, U.S. index futures and oil tumbled while
most emerging-market currencies weakened as growing concern the
sovereign debt crisis is hurting French banks drove investors
from riskier assets worldwide.  “We think the selloff in the zloty is an overreaction and
with euro-zloty having traded above 4.20 today, we argue that
the zloty is cheap compared with fundamentals,” Christensen
said. The zloty “has taken an unexplainable beating” and “is
beginning to look undervalued,” he wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
