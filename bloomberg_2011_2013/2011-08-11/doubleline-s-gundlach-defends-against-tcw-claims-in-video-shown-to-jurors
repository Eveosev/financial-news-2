DoubleLine Capital LP’s  Jeffrey Gundlach , in a videotaped deposition shown to a jury, defended
himself against claims that he used proprietary information from
former employer TCW Group Inc. when he started his new firm.  “In the things I was involved with, I don’t think TCW had
any proprietary information,” Gundlach said in the deposition
that TCW’s lawyers showed today in California state court in Los
Angeles. He said it was “experience and thinking” that was
making money for clients rather than TCW’s analytical systems,
which were “just data.”  TCW, the Los Angeles-based unit of  Societe Generale (GLE)  SA,
sued Gundlach, 51, and three other ex-employees in January 2010,
a month after he was fired and more than half of TCW’s fixed-
income professionals had joined his new firm. TCW seeks
$375 million in damages, claiming Gundlach stole its  trade
secrets , including client portfolio data, to start DoubleLine.  Gundlach, who had worked at TCW for 25 years and who was
named Morningstar’s Fixed Income Manager of the Year in 2006,
countersued, saying that TCW fired him to avoid having to pay
management and performance fees for the distressed-asset funds
his group managed and that went “through the roof.” Gundlach
seeks about $500 million.  The case is Trust Co. of the West v. Gundlach, BC429385,
California Superior Court,  Los Angeles  County.  To contact the reporter on this story:
