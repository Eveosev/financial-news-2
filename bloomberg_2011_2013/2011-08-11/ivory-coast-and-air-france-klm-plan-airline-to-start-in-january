Ivory Coast  plans to start a new
airline that will replace the grounded regional carrier Air
Ivoire, with  Air France-KLM (AF)  Group holding a minority stake, said
Transport Minister Gaoussou Toure.  The company will have capital of 50 billion  CFA francs  ($108
million) and will start flights by January, he said in a phone
interview from Abidjan, the commercial capital, today.  The West African nation, which is rebuilding its economy
after a violent post-election crisis that ended in April, will
control 51 percent of the company, Toure said. Paris-based Air
France-KLM will hold 35 percent and private shareholders that
have yet to be identified will hole the remainder, he said.  “We want Ivory Coast to have a powerful national carrier,”
he said.  Air Ivoire’s  four planes, which flew from Abidjan to
West African capitals including Accra, Conakry and Dakar, have
been grounded for at least four months as it struggled with debt
and high costs, Toure said.  Ivory Coast  will spend 10 billion francs each year on the
new airline whose name is yet to be chosen, Toure said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
