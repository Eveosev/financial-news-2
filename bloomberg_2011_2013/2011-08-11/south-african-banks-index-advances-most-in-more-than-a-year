South Africa ’s banks index surged
the most since May 2010 as European banks recovered from their
recent sell-off.  The FTSE/JSE  Africa  Banks gauge rose 4.3 percent to
37,896.92 by the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg.  Absa Group Ltd. (ASA) ,
South Africa’s third-largest bank by market value, jumped 5.3
percent to 132 rand. Standard Bank Group Ltd., Africa’s biggest
bank, gained 4.4 percent to 94.50 rand.  Firstrand Ltd. (FSR) , South
Africa’s second largest banking group, added 4.2 percent to
18.81 rand.  Nedbank Group Ltd. (NED) , the fourth-largest lender,
advanced 3.8 percent to 131.51 rand.  Banking shares posted one of the best performances among
the 19 industry groups in the benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index,
climbing 2.8 percent.  “Global banks are bouncing and although South African
banks have not fallen nearly as much, certainly they have been
oversold,” Lisa Haakman, banks analyst with London-based
Religare Capital Markets, said by phone.  The index’s 14-day relative strength index, which shows how
rapidly prices advanced or dropped during a specified period,
reached 23.1 yesterday, the lowest in two years. A reading of 30
or below signals to some investors that shares are set to
increase.  To contact the reporters on this story:
