Par Pharmaceutical Cos. and units of
Actavis Group HF were sued in federal court in Delaware by
 Avanir Pharmaceuticals Inc. (AVNR)  for patent infringement related to
plans to market generic versions of a drug used to control
emotional outbursts.  Avanir contends its rivals are violating two patents for
Nuedexta, a treatment for pseudobulbar affect, or uncontrolled
laughing or crying in patients with neurological disorders,
according to court papers filed yesterday in Wilmington.  Avanir, based in  Aliso Viejo ,  California , “will be
substantially and irreparably damaged and harmed” if the
infringement by Par and Iceland’s Actavis isn’t stopped by a
judge, the company said in two separate complaints.  Avanir officials said in a July 1 statement it “intends to
vigorously enforce its intellectual property rights to
Nuedexta.” The most recent of the patents expires in 2026,
according to U.S. Food and Drug Administration  records .  Allison Wey, a spokeswoman for  Woodcliff Lake , New Jersey-
based Par, didn’t immediately return a call seeking comment on
the lawsuit.  “It is Actavis’s policy to not comment on pending patent
litigation,” Actavis spokesman Gerard Farrell said in an
e-mailed statement.  The cases are Avanir v. Par and Avanir v. Actavis, U.S.
District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To see the patents, click RE38,115 and 7,659,282.  To contact the reporter on this story:
