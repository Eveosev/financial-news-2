Profit estimates for  Bank of America
Corp. (BAC)  and other large U.S. lenders may need to be slashed as
much as 30 percent if economic growth slows to 1 percent or
less, according to analysts at  Deutsche Bank AG. (DBK)   Consensus earnings estimates assume that gross domestic
product will expand at an annual rate of 3 percent or more,
Deutsche Bank analysts led by Matt O’Connor wrote in a note to
investors. O’Connor’s team produced estimates that reflect
slower economic growth, the note said.  Their assumptions include no change in short or long-term
interest rates, a U.S. jobless rate of 10 percent to 10.5
percent and a further 10 percent to 15 percent drop in stock
markets, the note said. With some exceptions, the banks would
experience a 0.1 percentage point drop in net interest margins
next year and a 0.15 percentage point decline in 2013 compared
with the level in the second quarter of 2011, the note said.  “Based on the above assumptions, we find that both 2012
and 2013 EPS consensus estimates could fall by 25 to 30
percent,” the note said, referring the consensus of Wall Street
analysts’ estimates.  Lenders with the most risk are Bank of America, Memphis,
Tennessee-based  First Horizon National Corp. (FHN) , and  Regions
Financial Corp. (RF) , based in Birmingham, Alabama. The least risk is
at Buffalo, New York-based  M&T Bank Corp. (MTB) , Minneapolis-based
U.S. Bancorp and  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  in San Francisco.  Lower Estimates  Under the low-growth scenario, Deutsche Bank estimates that
Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America, the biggest
U.S. lender by assets, would earn 47 cents a share in 2012
instead of the “consensus estimate” of $1.51, the note said.
The company’s 2013 per-share earnings would be cut to 96 cents
from the $1.89 expected by the consensus, the note said.  The 2012 estimate for First Horizon would drop to 29 cents
from 76 cents, while Regions Financial’s would decline to 30
cents from 61 cents, O’Connor’s team wrote.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the second-largest U.S. bank, would
earn $4.02 in 2012 under the low-growth scenario instead of the
$5.68 consensus estimate, the note said.  Citigroup Inc. (C) , the
third-largest bank, would make $3.14 a share in 2012 instead of
$5.22 a share, the analysts estimate. Both are based in  New
York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
