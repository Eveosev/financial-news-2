Asia ’s naphtha crack spread rose,
signaling increased processing profit for refiners. Glencore
International AG sold gasoil in  Singapore , the region’s largest
oil-trading center.  Light Distillates  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures rose
to $115.31 a metric ton at 5:45 p.m. Singapore time from $98.30
a ton at the end of Asian trading yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. This crack spread is a measure of
refining profit.  BP Plc sold two 50,000-barrel cargoes of 92-RON gasoline in
Singapore, according to a Bloomberg News survey of traders
monitoring transactions on the Platts window. Vitol Group bought
at $116.60 a barrel and PetroChina Co. paid $116.80 a barrel.  Middle Distillates  Glencore sold 150,000 barrels of 0.5 percent sulfur gasoil,
or diesel, to BP at 30 cents a barrel below quotes for August,
according to the Bloomberg News survey. The world’s biggest
commodities trader was the largest gasoil buyer in Singapore
last month, purchasing at least 4 million barrels.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian benchmark Dubai crude dropped 12
cents to $18.62 a barrel at 2:15 p.m. Singapore time, according
to PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. This crack spread is the
narrowest this month.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil advanced 20 cents to $2.10 a
barrel, the highest since Feb. 28, PVM said. A rising regrade
shows it is more profitable to produce  aviation fuel  over
diesel.  Fuel Oil   Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude narrowed 19 cents to
$4.82 a barrel at 2:15 p.m. Singapore time, according to PVM.
The difference was $4.39 on Aug. 8, the smallest loss from
turning oil into residual products in almost a year.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
was unchanged after dropping to $7.50 a ton yesterday, PVM said.
This viscosity spread was the narrowest since Sept. 29, meaning
bunker, or marine fuel, has gained more than higher-quality fuel
oil.  To contact the reporters on this story:
