Newsletter writers became more
optimistic about stocks amid the biggest slump in the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index since 2008, a sign the market retreat may not
be over, according to Miller Tabak & Co.’s  Peter Boockvar .  The proportion of writers who are bullish on equities
increased to 47.3 percent from 46.3 percent in the week ended
Aug. 9, while bears fell to 23.7 percent from 24.7 percent,
according to a report from New Rochelle, New York-based
Investors Intelligence yesterday. The S&P 500 fell 7.2 percent
in the week ended Aug. 5, the most since November 2008,
Bloomberg data show.  Analysts who study charts to predict markets view more
optimism as a contrarian sign because investors may have bought
shares and have less money to invest. The S&P 500 extended its
decline this week, including a 6.7 percent drop on Aug. 8, the
first session after a downgrade of the U.S. credit rating by S&P
stoked concern that the nation’s economic slowdown may worsen.  “One thing last week’s 7.2 percent decline in the S&P’s
didn’t do was shake the confidence of newsletter writers,”
Boockvar, a New York-based strategist, wrote in a note
yesterday. “This reflects a clear buy-on-the-dip mentality,”
he said. “Bear markets don’t bottom with more bulls than
bears.”  The  S&P 500  plunged 18 percent from an almost three-year
high on April 29 through Aug. 8. The next day, the benchmark
gauge rallied 4.7 percent after halting its slide intraday
within a half percentage point from 1,101.73, a level marking
the erasing of 38.2 percent of its entire gain during the  bull
market  that began in March 2009, according to Bloomberg data.
The threshold is part of Fibonacci chart analysis, which
attempts to identify points where losses may gain momentum or
reverse. The S&P 500 fell 4.4 percent to 1,120.76 yesterday.  ‘Violent Rallies’  “While some may say we’re not in a  bear market  yet, the
two main characteristics of one are oversold markets that get
even more extremely oversold and secondly are followed by
violent rallies that don’t last long,” Boockvar said.  The 14-day relative strength index for the S&P 500, which
identifies possible turning points by measuring the degree to
which gains or losses outpace the other, dropped to 16.5 on Aug.
8, the lowest level since September 2001, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Readings have stayed below 30, a level
seen as evidence that stocks have fallen too far too fast, in
four out of the past five days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
