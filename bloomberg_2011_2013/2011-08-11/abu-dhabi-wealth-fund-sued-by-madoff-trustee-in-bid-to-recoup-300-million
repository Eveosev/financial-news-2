The liquidator for Bernard L. Madoff’s firm sued the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, seeking
to recover $300 million for victims of the confidence man’s
Ponzi scheme.  Irving Picard , the Madoff firm’s trustee, said the
sovereign wealth fund withdrew the money from Fairfield Sentry,
a so-called feeder fund to Madoff’s fraud, in a complaint filed
today in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in Manhattan.  Picard said he has the authority to take back the transfers
made to the Abu Dhabi authority as he works to recover money for
Madoff customers. Madoff is serving a 150-year sentence in a
prison in North Carolina.  Erik Portanger, a spokesman for Abu Dhabi Investment
Authority, didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking
comment.  The case is Picard v. Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, 11-
02493, U.S. Bankruptcy Court Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
