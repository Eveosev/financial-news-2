England  stretched its lead to 232
runs over India in their third cricket Test as the hosts try to
take over the top spot in the sport’s rankings.  England was 456-3 at the end of the second day at Edgbaston
in Birmingham, with Alastair Cook scoring 182 and Eoin Morgan on
44. Captain  Andrew Strauss  was bowled for 87 and  Kevin Pietersen 
was caught on 63 as England increased the pressure.  England started the day trailing by 140 runs after bowling
the visitors out for 224 in its first innings. England picked up
73 runs in this morning’s 22 overs after the start was delayed
because of rain. Praveen Kumar was 2-75 for  India .  England, which took the first two Tests in the four-match
series, won the toss yesterday and put the visitors in to bat.
It can replace India as No. 1 in the International Cricket
Council rankings with another victory or by drawing the final
two matches.  India lost four wickets in each of yesterday’s first two
sessions, with six batsmen failing to reach five runs as Tim Bresnan and Stuart Broad combined to take eight wickets.  The teams will also play one Twenty20 match and five one-
day international games following the Test series.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
