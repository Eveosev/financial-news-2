Spain  won European Union consent for
temporary restrictions on Romanians seeking jobs in the country.  Exceptional curbs on Romanians’ ability to apply for jobs
in Spain are justified by the “dramatic” problems facing the
Spanish economy, the European Commission, the 27-nation EU’s
executive arm, said in an e-mailed statement today. The
restrictions will remain in place until the end of next year.  “We hope this move will be limited in time as much as
possible and an overall positive attitude towards free movement
in  Europe  will continue to prevail,” Laszlo Andor, the EU’s
employment and social affairs commissioner, said in the
statement. “This decision has been taken because of the very
specific employment situation in Spain.”  Spain’s economy has been battered during the economic and
financial crisis that followed the 2008 collapse of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. The country’s finances came under further
pressure as part of the contagion from  Greece ’s fiscal turmoil.
Unemployment in the country has stood at more than 20 percent
since May 2010 and is the highest in the 27-nation EU.  While  Romania ’s accession treaty to the EU allowed nations
to restrict access to their labor markets in a crisis, Spain’s
decision is the first time these emergency curbs have been used.
Romania’s government has two weeks to request an annulment of
the EU’s decision to approve Spain’s request.  To contact the reporters on this story:
