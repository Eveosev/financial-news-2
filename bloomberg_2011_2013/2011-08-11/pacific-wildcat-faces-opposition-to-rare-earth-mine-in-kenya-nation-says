Pacific Wildcat Resources Corp. (PAW) 
faces opposition to its search for rare earth oxide and niobium
at Mrima Hill in southeastern  Kenya , the  Daily Nation  reported,
citing Jemedari Omar, chairman of Kaya Mrima.  Residents in the area want a halt to prospecting that may
damage indigenous plants that have medicinal value, the Nairobi-
based newspaper said. The local community regards the forest at
Mrima Hills as sacred, it said.  Pacific Wildcat owns 70 percent of Cortec Mining Kenya, a
South African company that was issued an exploration license
last year, the newspaper said.  Pacific Wildcat didnâ€™t immediately respond to a voicemail
left by Bloomberg outside normal business hours requesting
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
