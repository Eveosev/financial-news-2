French nitrogen-fertilizer
deliveries increased 14 percent in the 11 months from July
through May to the highest in three years,  France ’s fertilizer-
industry association Unifa said.  Potassium shipments in France, the European Union’s largest
crop grower, rose 43 percent in the year through April, while
phosphate-fertilizer sales gained 28 percent in the same period,
Paris-based Unifa said in an e-mailed statement today.  Nitrogen deliveries rose to 2.19 million metric tons from
1.93 million tons in the year-earlier 11-month period. Potassium
sales rose to 592,000 tons in the 2010-11 season from 413,000
tons and phosphate shipments increased to 517,000 tons from
403,000 tons a year earlier, Unifa said.  France is the EU’s largest fertilizer user, according to
the International Fertilizer Industry Association. Unifa tracks
nitrogen sales on the basis of a year that starts July 1, while
the marketing year for potassium and phosphorus starts May 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
