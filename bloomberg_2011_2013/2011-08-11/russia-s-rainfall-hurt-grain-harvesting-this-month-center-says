Rains impeded harvesting of grains
in European Russia and the southern part of its Asian
territories in the first 10 days of August,  the Federal
Hydrometeorological Center  said.  Harvesting was suspended for as many as seven days in parts
of European Russia, the center said on its website. Heavy
rainfall and hail damaged crops in parts of the Black Earth
region of Voronezh and in the Saratov and Samara regions of the
Volga federal district, according to the statement.  In the south of the Asian territories, rains impeded
harvesting of winter grains and maturation of spring crops for
up to five days during the period, the center said.  Excessive dryness damaged grain quality in some western
parts of the Altai region and southwestern areas of the
Novosirbisk region in West Siberia.  In the 10 days from today, weather will be favorable for
formation of late crops in most parts of the Black Earth area,
which includes the Bryansk, Kursk, Belgorod, Voronezh and Tambov
regions. Conditions will be mostly satisfactory in  Russia ’s
Southern and North-Caucasus federal districts. In the Urals and
West Siberia, weather conditions will be mostly favorable for
maturation of spring crops, harvesting and the start of the
winter crops’ sowing, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
