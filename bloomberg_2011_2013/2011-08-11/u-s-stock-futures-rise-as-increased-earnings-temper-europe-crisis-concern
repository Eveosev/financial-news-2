U.S. stocks rallied, reversing
yesterday’s drop for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, as a
decline in jobless claims and better-than-estimated corporate
earnings tempered concern  Europe ’s debt crisis is worsening.  All 10 groups in the S&P 500 advanced at least 2.5 percent,
with gains being led by financial, energy and raw-material
companies.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) 
rallied more than 6.7 percent, after plunging at least 5.5
percent yesterday.  Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) , the world’s largest maker
of networking equipment, soared 16 percent, the most since May
2002, as profit and sales beat analysts’ estimates.  The S&P 500 surged 4.6 percent to 1,172.64 at 4 p.m. in New
York. The gauge had plunged as much as 18 percent from its 2011
high and yesterday traded at 12.3 times reported earnings, the
lowest valuation since March 2009, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  jumped 423.37
points, or 4 percent, to 11,143.31 today.  “We’re in the process of trying to establish a bottom,”
 James Paulsen , the chief investment strategist at Minneapolis-
based Wells Capital Management, which oversees about $340
billion, said in a telephone interview. “The jobless claims
number was calming in the middle of the storm. It’s a good
reminder that -- hey, we have stuff going on in Europe, but if
the economy does not roll into a recession, there’s no reason
for stocks to be selling at these levels.”  $3 Trillion  Almost $3 trillion was erased from U.S. equity values in
the last three weeks as Europe’s debt concern, signs the economy
is slowing and S&P’s downgrade of the government’s AAA credit
rating left the benchmark gauge for U.S. shares within 11 points
of a  bear market . Both European shares and the Russell 2000
Index of small companies entered a bear market this week,
falling at least 20 percent from their previous highs.  The whipsaw in stocks this week has left the  S&P 500  down
2.2 percent since Aug. 5. Today’s gain erased yesterday’s 4.4
percent decline in the gauge, which had been propelled by a drop
in banks. The index rose 4.7 percent on Aug. 9 and fell 6.7
percent on Aug. 8.  Stocks rose today as a report showed that claims for
unemployment insurance payments in the U.S. unexpectedly fell
last week to a four-month low. First-time applications for
jobless benefits decreased 7,000 in the week ended Aug. 6 to
395,000, the fewest since early April, the Labor Department
said. Economists forecast 405,000 claims, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  Trade Deficit  A separate report showed that the U.S. trade deficit
unexpectedly increased in June to the highest level since
October 2008 as a slump in exports exceeded a decline in
shipments from overseas.  A rout in global equity markets since July 26 erased $7.9
trillion in equity values through yesterday. Central bankers are
trying to restore investor confidence, with the  Federal Reserve 
pledging to keep  interest rates  near zero through at least
mid-2013 to bolster U.S. growth and the European Central Bank
buying bonds to cap borrowing costs.  Financial shares had the biggest gain in the S&P 500 within
10 groups, rising 6.3 percent. The group plunged 7.1 percent
yesterday. Bank of America, the nation’s biggest lender, added
7.1 percent to $7.25. JPMorgan increased 6.8 percent to $36.69.  Benchmark indexes were also lifted by better-than-estimated
corporate earnings. Since July 11, about 76 percent of S&P 500
companies that have released quarterly results beat projections,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Earnings per share have
increased 17 percent, while sales rose 13 percent.  Strong Balance Sheets  “Balance sheets are very strong,” Abby Joseph Cohen, the
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategist known for predicting the
1990s bull market, said in a radio interview on “Bloomberg
Surveillance” with Ken Prewitt and  Tom Keene . “This market
volatility is happening at a time when U.S. companies,
especially those in the S&P 500, are performing extremely well.
Stocks, not just in the United States, but in some of the other
major markets, are also priced at very low levels.”  Cisco Systems soared 16 percent to $15.92. The company has
reined in operating expenses, unveiling a plan to cut about
6,500 jobs worldwide and closing the Flip video camera unit to
concentrate on its more profitable switches and routers.  News Corp. (NWSA)  surged 18 percent, the biggest gain in the S&P
500, to $16.19. The owner of Fox TV and the Wall Street Journal
posted profit that beat estimates and raised its dividend 27
percent, cushioning investor losses after a phone-hacking
scandal hurt the stock.  Kohl’s Forecast  Kohl’s Corp. (KSS)  gained 7.3 percent to $47.50. The fourth-
largest U.S. department-store chain said profit per share this
year would be higher than it previously forecast.  Brinker International Inc. (EAT)  surged 14 percent to $23.54. The
operator of the Chili’s restaurant chain forecast 2012 profit
that exceeded analysts’ estimates.  Energy shares in the S&P 500 rose 5.2 percent as crude oil
rallied.  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  added 3.9 percent to $94.07.  A single trade for 100 shares of  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  more
than 6 percent below yesterday’s closing price led to the
triggering of a circuit breaker, pausing trading in the stock.  The trade, later canceled, was executed at 10:33 a.m. New
York time at $63.47 on an exchange operated by Bats Global
Markets, according to data sent to Bloomberg. The stock closed
at $68.03 yesterday and the highest price in the 5 minutes
before the halt was $69.91, the data show. The shares closed 5.2
percent higher today, at $71.58.  Smaller Harvest  Fertilizer producers advanced after the U.S. government
said corn, soybean and spring-wheat harvests will be smaller
than forecast last month.  CF Industries Holdings Inc. (CF)  gained 10
percent to $164.19.  Mosaic Co. (MOS)  increased 8.4 percent to $64.46.  Only two stocks in the S&P 500 fell today. Sara Lee Corp.,
the maker of Ball Park hot dogs and Senseo coffee, dropped 1.3
percent to $17.09 after its sales forecast trailed estimates.
Sprint Nextel Corp., the third-largest U.S. mobile-phone
carrier, slid 1.3 percent to $3.12.  More executives at S&P 500 companies are buying their stock
than any time since the depths of the credit crisis after
valuations plunged 25 percent below their five-decade average.  Sixty-six insiders at 50 companies bought shares between
Aug. 3 and Aug. 9, the most since the five days ended March 9,
2009, when the benchmark index for U.S. equities reached a 12-
year low, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Morgan
Stanley Chief Executive Officer James Gorman and two other
managers purchased 175,000 shares of the New York-based bank as
the shares fell to the lowest level since March 2009, according
to filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  “Nobody knows a company better than the people running
it,” Shawn Price, who manages $2.4 billion at Navellier &
Associates Inc. in Reno,  Nevada , said in a telephone interview.
“It’s a positive sign that they are committing their personal
capital.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
