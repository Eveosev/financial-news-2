The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission spent $2.5 million on a court-rejected rule aimed at
making it easier for shareholders to put board nominees on
corporate ballots, according to the agency’s top official.  The SEC used about 21,000 staff hours -- valued at $2.2
million -- writing the so-called proxy access rule and needed
$315,000 to defend it against a court challenge by the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce and the  Business Roundtable , SEC Chairman
 Mary Schapiro  said in a letter to House lawmakers dated Aug. 5,
according to a copy obtained by Bloomberg News. The letter’s
contents were confirmed by John Nester, an SEC spokesman.  Schapiro was responding to Republican Representatives Randy Neugebauer and  Jeb Hensarling  of Texas and  Scott Garrett  of New
Jersey, who sought an accounting after the U.S. Court of Appeals
in Washington decided in favor of the business groups on July
22. The lawmakers said the ruling that the SEC failed to
properly study the rule’s impact on companies raised
“fundamental questions” about the agency’s work and spending
on such efforts reflects “serious mismanagement.”  In her letter, Schapiro defended the spending, noting that
it represented less than a tenth of a percent of the agency’s
budget during that time.  “Writing rules to effectuate free and fair markets is a
time-consuming, resource-intensive effort for the SEC,” she
wrote. “The proxy access proposal was just one of more than 100
rulemakings the SEC has proposed or adopted over the past two
years.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
