Ethanol futures rose the highest
price in more than a week in  Chicago  after the U.S. trimmed its
estimate for the corn crop.  Futures advanced after the Agriculture Department cut its
outlook by 4.1 percent to 12.914 billion bushels, down from a
July estimate of 13.47 billion. The grain is the primary input
used to make ethanol in the U.S.  “Ethanol was able to make gains on the back of corn and
the general bullishness,” SCB & Associates LLC, including
Justin Dirico, a senior ethanol trader, said in a note to
clients.  Denatured ethanol for August delivery climbed 7.5 cents, or
2.8 percent, to $2.777 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the highest settlement since Aug. 3. Futures have risen 17
percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago increased 7.5
cents, or 2.7 percent, to $2.81 a gallon and in  New York  the
biofuel jumped 6 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $2.92, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf gained 3.5 cents, or 1.2 percent,
to $2.925 a gallon and on the West Coast the additive slumped
6.5 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $2.925.  Corn futures for December delivery surged 25.5 cents, or
3.7 percent, to $7.14 a bushel in Chicago, the biggest gain for
a most-active contract since Aug. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
