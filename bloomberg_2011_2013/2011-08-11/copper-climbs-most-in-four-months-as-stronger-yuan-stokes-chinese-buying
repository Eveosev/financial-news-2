Copper futures in  New York  rose the
most since March after claims for unemployment-insurance
payments unexpectedly fell in the U.S., tempering concern that
the economy is faltering.  Applications for jobless benefits decreased in the week
ended Aug. 6 to 395,000, the fewest since early April, the Labor
Department said. Economists forecast 405,000 claims, according
to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. The U.S. is
the world’s second-largest copper user. On the London Metal
Exchange, lead and zinc jumped more than 4 percent.  “Any type of drop in jobless claims adds to the bullish
momentum,”  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior strategist at MF Global
Holdings Ltd. in Chicago, said in a telephone interview.  Copper futures for December delivery gained 11.9 cents, or
3 percent, to close at $4.03 a pound at 1:15 p.m. on the Comex
in New York, the biggest gain for a most-active contract since
March 17. The metal has climbed 23 percent in the past 12
months.  “Strength in the Chinese yuan, which increases  China ’s
purchasing power for dollar-based commodities, helped fuel a
rally in base metals overnight,”  RBC Capital Markets  said in a
report.  The yuan strengthened beyond 6.4 per dollar for the first
time since 1993, supported by the Federal Reserve’s pledge to
keep  interest rates  at a record low. China is the largest metal
buyer.  On the LME, copper for delivery in three months jumped
$286, or 3.3 percent, to $8,881 a metric ton ($4.03 a pound).  Nickel, tin and aluminum also gained in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
