through the  Department of Commerce , announced today that total
June exports of $170.9 billion and imports of $223.9 billion
resulted in a goods and services deficit of $53.1 billion, up
from $50.8 billion in May, revised.  June exports were $4.1
billion less than May exports of $175.0 billion.  June imports
were $1.9 billion less than May imports of $225.8 billion.  In June, the goods deficit increased $2.1 billion from May to

2010 to June 2011.  Exports were up $19.5 billion, or 12.9
percent, and imports were up $25.7 billion, or 13.0 percent.  Goods (Census Basis)  The May to June decrease in exports of goods reflected decreases
in industrial supplies and materials ($2.0 billion); capital
goods ($1.5 billion); foods, feeds, and beverages ($0.8 billion);
and other goods ($0.5 billion). An increase occurred in  consumer
goods  ($0.7 billion). Automotive vehicles, parts, and engines

business, professional, and technical services, insurance
services, and financial services). Changes in the other
categories of services exports were small.  Services imports were virtually unchanged from May to June.

and financial services.  Goods and Services Moving Average  For the three months ending in June, exports of goods and
