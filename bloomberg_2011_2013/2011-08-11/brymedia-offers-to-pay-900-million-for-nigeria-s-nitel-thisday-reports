Brymedia West Africa Ltd. has
offered to pay $900 million to acquire state-owned Nigerian
Telecommunications Ltd., ThisDay reported, without saying where
it got the information.  Brymedia has completed a due diligence study on Nitel, as
the fixed-line operator is known, and is ready to make the
payment to help turn the company around, the Lagos-based
newspaper said. Brymedia offered to pay $550 million for Nitel
at an auction in 2010, with its bid coming third behind Omen
International’s $956 million and New Generation Group’s $2.5
billion, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
