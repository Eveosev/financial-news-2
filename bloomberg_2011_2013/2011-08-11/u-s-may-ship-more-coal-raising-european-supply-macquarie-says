The U.S. may increase coal exports,
further boosting supply of the commodity in  Europe ,  Macquarie
Group Ltd. (MQG)  said.  “A big push” to encourage natural-gas burning in the U.S.
may drive up coal exports to Europe, China and  India , said
Hayden Atkins, an analyst in  London  at Macquarie’s commodities
unit. The closing of Germany’s nuclear plants will increase
demand in that nation, Atkins said.  U.S. steam-coal exports to Europe in the first quarter more
than tripled from a year earlier to 4.9 million metric tons from
1.5 million tons, according to a  report  on the website of the
U.S. Energy Information Administration. U.S. coal exports are at
their highest level since 1992, it said.  Exports to the Netherlands jumped to 1.1 million tons from
334,628 tons. Shipments to  Germany  went to 899,009 tons from
166,314 tons. Trade to the U.K. rose to 852,159 tons from
159,280 tons.  Switching to natural gas from coal in U.S. power generation
will accelerate in 2012 because of new Environmental Protection
Agency rules to cut emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen
oxides, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said July 19.  The Cross-State Air Pollution Rule requires 27 states in
the eastern U.S. to cut sulfur dioxide emissions by 73 percent
and nitrous oxides by 54 percent by 2014 compared with 2005
levels, Merrill analysts including Sabine Schels in London said.
Generators that exceed caps must cut emissions by twice the
amount exceeded as a penalty, they said.  China  Imports  China’s coal imports may fall 15 percent this year to 94
million metric tons as domestic supply increases, according to
Miswin Mahesh, an analyst at  Barclays Capital  in London. “Signs
of comfortable end-user stocks which indicate a well-supplied
domestic market and well-performing transport system will help
in transporting domestically produced coal within the country,”
Mahesh said Aug. 8.  Increased shipments to Europe may curb prices in the 27-
nation bloc. Coal for northwest Europe for next year has fallen
6.4 percent since reaching $135 a ton on April 4, its highest
intraday level for more than two years. The contract rose 0.4
percent today to $126.35 a ton, according to prices from brokers
compiled by Bloomberg. The median forecast for 2012 in a survey
of eight analysts by Bloomberg data was $120. Estimates ranged
from $89 to $139.  Any further decline in coal would boost the profitability
of burning the fuel for power, “which should push up both the
demand for and the price of carbon permits,” said Matthew Cowie, an analyst in London for New Energy Finance.  Emissions of  greenhouse gases  in the European Union’s
carbon market, the world’s largest, may be 19.7 billion tons in
the eight years starting 2013, known as the program’s phase
three, according to a model by analysts at Bloomberg New Energy
Finance in London. That’s 5.1 percent more than the model’s
forecast on May 31.  Increased demand for fossil fuels including coal in Europe,
due to the closure of nuclear stations in Germany, prompted the
change in the model’s forecast, along with lower carbon prices,
according to New Energy Finance.  To contact the reporters on this story:
