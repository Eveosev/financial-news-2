Imperial Oil Ltd. (IMO) , the Canadian
crude producer owned by  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , reported second-
quarter profit that missed analysts’ estimates because of
refinery maintenance and lower production volumes.  Per-share profit was 20 cents less than the average
estimate of C$1.05 from three analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Net income rose to C$726 million ($766 million), or 85 cents a
share, from  C$517 million, or 60 cents, a year earlier,
Imperial said in a statement today.  Revenue in the quarter increased 27 percent to C$7.77
billion, missing the C$7.88 billion estimate. Production
declined to 292,000 barrels per day from 300,000 barrels in the
year-earlier quarter because of lower output at Syncrude Canada
Ltd., Calgary-based Imperial said today.  Imperial owns a stake in Syncrude as well as oil production
sites in  Canada  and operates a network of gasoline stations
across Canada under the Esso brand.  Exxon Mobil  holds about 70
percent of Imperial, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Planned maintenance at Imperial’s refineries cost about
C$95 million, the company said.  Imperial said higher crude prices contributed an additional
C$430 million to earnings in the quarter, helping to offset
increased royalty costs and lower production.  Imperial and other Canadian oil-sands companies have
benefited from the rising price of oil over the past year. Crude
futures trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  averaged
$102.34 a barrel in the second quarter compared with an average
of $78.05 in the same period in 2010.  Imperial fell 92 cents, or 2 percent, to C$42.53 at 4 p.m.
in Toronto Stock Exchange trading. The stock, which has gained
9.9 percent this year, has two buy, nine hold and four sell
ratings from analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
