Vale SA (VALE3) , the world’s largest iron-
ore producer, posted second-quarter profit that missed analysts’
expectations and said it will pay an extra dividend of $3
billion as it seeks to boost returns to shareholders.  Net income rose to $6.45 billion, or $1.22 a share, from
$3.71 billion, or 70 cents, a year earlier, the Rio de Janeiro-
based company said today in a regulatory filing. Vale was
expected to post per-share profit of $1.39 on an adjusted basis,
the average of 13 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Vale is profiting from higher iron-ore prices as  China , the
biggest consumer of the steelmaking ingredient, invests in
projects including low-income housing. The company, which
announced in a separate statement today it will pay an extra
dividend of 57.7 cents a share, is joining rivals BHP Billiton
Ltd. and Rio Tinto Group in returning capital to shareholders.  “With high volumes and high prices, this should be a
banner year for Vale,” Jordi Dominguez, an equity analyst at
Societe Generale SA in  New York , said in telephone interview on
July 22. Dominguez, who has a “buy” recommendation on the
stock, said he expects Vale to generate $28.8 billion in net
income this year, a 66 percent increase from the prior year.  Chinese demand and startup production difficulties at iron-
ore projects will cause a market imbalance for as long as seven
years, Vale Chief Financial Officer Guilherme Cavalcanti said
July 5.  “The delivery of new iron-ore capacity involves huge
challenges, with a large potential to cause delays in execution
and higher production and investment costs,” Vale said today in
a statement.  Project Budgets  A weaker dollar combined with increased engineering and
construction costs prompted Vale to boost its capital-
expenditure budget for three projects, the company said in
today’s statement. Vale increased planned spending by 12 percent
to $3.17 billion for its Onca Puma nickel mine, 29 percent to
$2.33 billion for its Salobo copper project and 25 percent to
$878 million for its Estreito hydroelectric plant.  Net sales surged 55 percent to $15 billion in the quarter,
helped by  iron-ore , nickel and copper production increases. Vale
invested $4.04 billion excluding acquisitions, about 17 percent
of its record $24 billion planned for 2011.  Production  Vale produced 80.3 million metric tons of iron ore in the
three months through June 30, 5.8 percent more than a year
earlier, the company said. Nickel production climbed by more
than half to about 56,000 tons and copper output increased 57
percent to 63,000 tons, it said.  Prices for iron-ore sold by Vale averaged $145.30 per ton
in the quarter, an increase of 58 percent from last year.  BHP, the world’s largest mining company, boosted its iron-
ore output by 14 percent to 35.5 million tons in the quarter,
the company said July 20.  Rio Tinto , the world’s third-largest
mining company by market value after BHP and Vale, said July 14
that its iron-ore output climbed 12 percent to 48.9 million tons
in the quarter.  Vale gained 42 centavos, or 0.9 percent, to 46.27 reais in
Sao Paulo trading. The stock has dropped 4.6 percent this year,
compared with a 15 percent drop for the benchmark Bovespa Index.  The earnings report was released after the close of
trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
