Sanofi said the first target linked
to fee payments for its acquisition of  Genzyme Corp. (GENZ)  won’t be
met as the U.S. biotech company takes longer than expected to
return to normal supplies of Fabrazyme, a medicine for patients
with Fabry disease. Second-quarter profit fell 13 percent to 2.2
billion euros ($3.1 billion), in line with analyst estimates,
the company said in a statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
