National Express Group Plc (NEX) , a U.K.
bus and rail operator, said profit more than doubled as
consumers in the U.K.,  Spain  and the U.S. rode buses more to cut
transport costs.  Net income was 54.1 million pounds ($89.3 million) compared
with 19.2 million pounds a year earlier today the London-based
bus and rail operator said today in a statement. Sales rose 5.6
percent to 1.12 billion pounds.  National Express  is focusing on improving the profitability
of its bus and rail businesses after borrowing to expand in U.K.
rail. The government stripped National Express of the high-
profile East Coast line between London and  Scotland  in 2009
after the company said it could no longer afford to fund the
franchise.  The company is “well placed” to improve its operations,
Chief Executive Officer Dean Finch said in the statement. “We
are focused on organic growth, new contract wins and carefully
targeted opportunities in attractive markets.”  National Express rose 1.8 pence, or 0.7 percent, to 252.1
pence at 8:11 a.m. in  London . The company’s stock price is
little this year, valuing it at 1.29 billion pounds.  The company ended a dispute with Elliott Advisors, one of
its largest shareholders, in May by agreeing to appoint three
independent non-executive directors. The U.S. hedge fund had
challenged the company’s board over its strategy, proposing a
breakup to boost its value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
