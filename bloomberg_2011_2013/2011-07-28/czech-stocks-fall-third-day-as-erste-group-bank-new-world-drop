The Czech benchmark stock index
dropped for a third day as worse-than-expected earnings at
European companies and concern U.S. politicians won’t agree on
increasing the debt ceiling drove investors from riskier assets.  The PX gauge of 14 companies declined 0.4 percent to 1,176
at 4:27 p.m. Prague, its lowest closing level in more than seven
months. Austria’s  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  retreated 1.2 percent and
 Komercni Banka AS (KOMB)  slid 0.7 percent. The two stocks have combined
40 percent weighting in the index.  European stocks fell after earnings at Credit Suisse Group
AG, Switzerland’s second-biggest bank, and BASF SE, the world’s
largest chemical company, missed analysts’ estimates.  Europe ’s
indexes pared losses and U.S. stocks gained as better-than-
forecast data on jobless claims and home sales in the world’s
largest economy offset concern about the government’s deficit.  “European stock indexes declined this morning following
the events in the U.S. and a series of mostly bad results at
European firms,” Ondrej Moravansky, an analyst at Cyrrus
brokerage in Brno,  Czech Republic , wrote in a report today.  Equities in Europe and America fell yesterday amid a row
about raising the U.S. debt ceiling that threatens to send the
country into a potential default. The  House of Representatives 
is set to vote today on Republican John Boehner’s proposal that
faces unified opposition from Democrats in the Senate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
