Russia loaded 1.5 million metric
tons of grain for export from July 1, some 30 percent more than
a year earlier, Agriculture Minister  Yelena Skrynnik  said in an
 interview  with state-run newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta.  The main buyers were Turkey, Egypt, Azerbaijan, Israel, and
the European Union, she said. Russia will also deliver
humanitarian supplies to  Nicaragua  and North Korea, she said,
without elaborating on the size of the shipments.  Russia’s outbound flour shipments reached 600,000 tons so
far this year, three times more than a year earlier, she said. A
grain exports ban, applied from August until July 1 after the
country’s worst drought in a half century, didn’t relate to
flour this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
