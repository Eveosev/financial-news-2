Russian farmers reaped 6 million
metric tons of winter grains from 2.1 million hectares (5.2
million acres), or 83 percent of the sown area, in the southern
Rostov region, the  local agriculture ministry  said.  Farmers completed harvesting of more than 86 percent of the
winter wheat crop, 92 percent of winter barley, 64 percent of
spring barley, more than 70 percent of legumes and 74 percent of
rye, the ministry said in an e-mailed statement today.  The average yield for winter grains was 2.85 tons a
hectare. Yields reached as much as 4.3 tons a hectare in some
districts, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
