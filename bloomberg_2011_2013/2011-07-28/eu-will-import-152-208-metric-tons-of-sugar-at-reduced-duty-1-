The European Union will import
152,208 metric tons of sugar at a reduced duty rate under the
second of five planned tenders to alleviate tight supplies,
according to the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm.  The 27-nation bloc backed a proposal in May to import the
sweetener at a reduced rate and authorized duty-free imports of
200,000 tons of sugar to boost supplies in the region. The EU
also allowed 300,000 tons of imports at zero duty earlier this
year, bringing the total of duty-free imports to 500,000 tons.  Raw sugar imports under today’s tender will total 142,160
tons, while white, or refined, sugar will account for 10,048
tons, the commission said in an e-mailed statement today.  The lowest duty to be paid will be 151.05 euros ($215.8) $a
ton, on 141,960 tons of raw-sugar for refining, while the
highest will be 225 euros a ton on the 10,048 tons of white
sugar, it said.  The commission accepted offers to import 64,364 tons of
sugar on July 14, bringing the total amount of sugar to be
brought into the bloc at reduced duty to 216,572 tons.  The results of the next tender will be decided Aug. 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
