Produce Buying Co., the biggest
purchaser of cocoa beans from farmers in  Ghana , gained the most
in six weeks after saying nine-month profit more than doubled.  The shares rose 1 pesewa, or 3.7 percent, to 28 pesewas by
1:40 p.m. in the capital, Accra. Thatâ€™s the biggest increase
since June 15.  Net income jumped to 23.6 million cedis ($15.7 million)
from 9.9 million cedis in the period through June while revenue
surged 94 percent to 1.1 billion cedis, it said in a statement
handed to reporters at the Ghana Stock Exchange yesterday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
