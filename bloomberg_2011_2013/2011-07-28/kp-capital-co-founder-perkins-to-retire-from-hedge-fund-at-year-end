Maurice “Chip” Perkins, co-founder
of $4.5 billion hedge fund MKP Capital Management LLC, is
retiring at the end of the year.  Perkins, 53, recently served as Strategic Relationship
Manager, focusing on developing senior relationships with
investors and counterparties, the New York-based firm said today
in a statement. Before starting MKP Capital in 1995 with Patrick McMahon and Eric Keiter, Perkins worked for 13 years at  Salomon
Brothers . Keiter retired from MKP Capital in 2006.  Anoop Dhakad, a partner who has overseen the firm’s fund
raising efforts since 2007, and Katherine Plavan, a managing
director who joined in 2009, were promoted to lead the hedge
fund’s investor relations worldwide, according to the statement.
Their promotions are part of MKP Capital’s long-term succession
plan, the firm said.  MKP Capital’s $2.8 billion credit hedge fund, profitable
every year since it was started more than a decade ago, lost 4.8
percent in the first half of 2011 as bonds tied to U.S. real-
estate loans fell, according to an investor letter.  The firm’s macro fund, MKP Opportunity, designed to profit
from broad economic trends by trading everything from
commodities to currencies, gained 2.8 percent this year through
June 30, according to a person familiar with the returns, who
asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public.  Hedge funds  on average have gained 4.4 percent this year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
