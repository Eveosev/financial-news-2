Inchcape Plc (INCH)  rose the most since
October 2009 after it beat analyst estimates for first-half
pretax profit, led by sales in Russia and emerging markets.  Inchcapeâ€™s pretax profit was 126.8 million pounds ($207
million), which compares to a median estimate of 115 million
pounds from six analysts, according to Bloomberg data. Inchcape
rose 8.4 percent.  Inchcape gained 30.3 pence to 390 pence in  London . The
shares have gained 9.4 percent so far this year, giving it a
market value of 1.8 billion pounds.  Inchcape plans to have 20 dealerships in China by 2016, up
from three today, Chief Executive Officer Andre Lacroix said in
a telephone interview.  The U.K. car retailer and wholesaler is also preparing to
open outlets in Santiago and Lima, as part of its push into
emerging markets, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
