Gasoline in the  Gulf Coast  rose to
the strongest level in two months after  LyondellBasell
Industries NV (LYB)  had an upset in a fluid catalytic cracker at its
Houston refinery yesterday.  The plant flared gases after the upset at the 302,300-
barrel-a-day plant, according to a filing with the Texas
Commission on Environmental Quality. Western Refining Inc. began
starting units at its El Paso refinery after a power outage July
26, a separate filing showed.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast versus New York Mercantile Exchange futures narrowed
0.62 cent to 6.88 cents a gallon at 1:48 p.m., according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the smallest gap since May 13.
Prompt delivery sank 2.01 cents to $2.988 a gallon.  The premium over heating oil futures for for ultra-low-
sulfur diesel, or ULSD, at the hub rose 0.4 cent to 3.5 cents a
gallon.  Several units shut after Western’s 128,000-barrel-a-day
refinery in El Paso lost power July 26, the company said in the
 filing .  To contact the reporter on this story:
