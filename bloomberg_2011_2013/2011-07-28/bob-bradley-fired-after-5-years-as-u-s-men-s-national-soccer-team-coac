Bob Bradley was fired as coach of
the U.S. men’s national soccer team, less than a year after
agreeing to a four-year contract extension.  Bradley, who was named coach of the team in January 2007,
had a 43-25-12 record during his five-year tenure, including the
championship of the 2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup. The U.S. also
finished second in the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup, and
advanced to the Round of 16 of the 2010  World Cup  in  South
Africa  after winning its qualifying group.  “During his time as the head coach he led the team to a
number of accomplishments, but we felt now was the right time
for us to make a change,” U.S. Soccer President Sunil Gulati
said in a  statement . “We wish him the best in his future
endeavors.”  Bradley signed a four-year extension in August.  A replacement has yet to be named, U.S. Soccer said. An
additional announcement will be made tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
