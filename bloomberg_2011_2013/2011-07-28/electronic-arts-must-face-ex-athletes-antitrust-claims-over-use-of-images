Electronic Arts Inc. (ERTS) , the second-
largest U.S.-video game publisher, must face antitrust claims
that it conspired with the National Collegiate Athletic
Association to deprive student athletes of payments for use of
their images in video games, a federal judge ruled.  U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken in Oakland,  California ,
said today Electronic Arts must respond within 14 days to claims
in a lawsuit filed on behalf of former NCAA athletes that the
company and the association colluded to allow third parties to
create modifications to NCAA-themed basketball and football
video games allowing users to upload their names, height, weight
and appearances without compensation.  Wilken said the ex-players have made “significant” new
allegations that EA agreed to not offer payment to athletes once
they left their college sports careers, in addition to NCAA’s
rule prohibiting compensation of current student athletes.  “It suggests that EA was actively participating to ensure
that former student-athletes would not receive any compensation
for the use of their images, likenesses and names,” Wilken
said.  Jeff Brown, a spokesman for  Redwood City , California-based
EA, didn’t immediately return a voice-mail message seeking
comment about the ruling.  The case is In Re NCAA Student-Athlete Name and Likeness
Licensing Litigation, 09-1967, U.S. District Court, Northern
District of California (Oakland).  To contact the reporters on this story:
