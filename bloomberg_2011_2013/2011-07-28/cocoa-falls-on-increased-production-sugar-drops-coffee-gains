Cocoa fell to a one-month low on
signs that rising supplies in Cameroon and  Ivory Coast , the
world’s largest producer, will compound a global production
surplus. Sugar and coffee declined.  Cocoa deliveries to ports in Ivory Coast climbed 25 percent
to 1.35 million metric tons in the season to date, a document
obtained from the industry’s regulator showed. Cameroon said
today that production in June more than doubled from a year
earlier to 6,840 tons. On July 22, Rabobank International
boosted estimates of the global surplus by 51 percent to 292,000
tons for the year that ends in September.  “We’ve seen a real uptick in the availability of cocoa
coming out of West Africa,” Luis Rangel, the vice president of
commodity derivatives at ICAP Futures LLC, said in a telephone
interview from  Jersey City ,  New Jersey . “Bean availability has
been going up in the last several weeks, and people are now
fully aware of the higher production numbers.”  Cocoa futures for September delivery declined $62, or 2
percent, to settle at $2,974 a ton at 12:02 p.m. on ICE Futures
U.S. in New York, after touching $2,972, the lowest for a most-
active contract since June 27. Prices, down 1.2 percent from a
year ago, have declined 5.6 percent this month.  Raw-sugar futures for October delivery dropped 1.21 cents,
or 3.9 percent, to settle at 29.92 cents a pound on ICE, the
biggest drop since July 14.  Arabica-coffee futures for September delivery retreated
2.55 cents, or 1.1 percent, to settle at $2.3865 a pound in  New
York .  In  London , cocoa, sugar and coffee dropped on NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
