Vallourec SA (VK) , a French producer of
steel pipes for the oil and gas industry, declined the most in
more than 2-1/2 years in Paris trading after profit shrank.  Vallourec fell as much as 17 percent, the steepest intraday
decline since Oct. 6, 2008. It was reduced to “neutral” from
“buy” by Natixis SA and to “underperform” from “neutral”
at BofA Merrill Lynch after posting an 11 percent decline in
second-quarter profit as rising raw material costs cut margins.  Net income slid to 112 million euros ($161 million) from
126 million euros a year earlier,  Boulogne Billancourt , France-
based Vallourec said yesterday after the close of trading. The
company said it “will continue to operate in a context marked
by the volatility and high level of raw material costs.”  “Vallourec’s very cautious stance on the second half is
set to take the market by surprise,” Bofa wrote in a note
today. “Unless we see a material uplift in demand and the
pricing environment, we expect Vallourec will struggle to
convince the market of a quicker pace of margin expansion.”  The pipemaker said revenue will “progress at a lower
pace” even as volumes rise in the second half compared with the
first six months of the year. Earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization will be “slightly higher.”  Material costs are hobbling steel-product makers’ efforts
to emerge from the industry’s worst crisis in 60 years following
the world financial crisis. The price of  iron ore , a key steel-
making ingredient, may average $170 a metric ton in 2011, up
from $122 a ton last year, according to Morgan Stanley.  Vallourec declined 12.82 euros, or 15 percent, to 71.35
euros by 10:03 a.m. in Paris trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
