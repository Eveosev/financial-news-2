Japanese finance ministry officials
raised their assessment of the economy amid signs of recovery in
the second quarter from a record earthquake.  “The economy is showing some improvements,” managers of the
finance ministry’s regional branches said in a quarterly report
in  Tokyo  today, upgrading the evaluation for the first time in a
year.  Managers of eight out of 11 regions raised their economic
assessments, including those covering Tokyo,  Osaka  and the
northeastern area devastated by the March 11 temblor and tsunami,
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
