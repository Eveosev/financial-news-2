Dollar loan rates in  Brazil  plunged
to the lowest level since April after the government levied a
tax on foreign-exchange derivatives as part of an effort to curb
gains in the real.  The cupom cambial contract due in January, a measure of the
annual costs of borrowing dollars in Brazil, fell 59 basis
points, or 0.59 percentage point, to 2.75 percent, the lowest
level since April 4, according to trading on BM&FBovespa SA in
 Sao Paulo .  Brazil authorized the monetary council yesterday to charge
a 1 percent tax on certain derivatives operations. The
government may increase the tax up to 25 percent if needed,
according to the decree signed by President Dilma Rousseff and
published yesterday in the Official Gazette.  To contact the reporter on this story:
