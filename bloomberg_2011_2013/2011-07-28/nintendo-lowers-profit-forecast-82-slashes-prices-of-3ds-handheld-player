Nintendo Co., the world’s largest
maker of video-game machines, unexpectedly slashed its profit
forecast 82 percent after slumping demand for its new 3-D
handheld player led the company to cut prices of the product.  Net income may total 20 billion yen ($257 million) for the
year ending March 31, compared with Nintendo’s previous estimate
of 110 billion yen, the Kyoto-based company said in a statement
today. The forecast was almost 70 percent below the lowest of
the 21 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Nintendo will cut the price of the 3DS by 40 percent, less
than six months after the product’s debut, as gamers flock
toward  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone and online games played on Facebook
Inc.’s service. President Satoru Iwata is counting on the
reduced prices and new titles such as “Mario Kart” to spur
demand for the new portable player and help the stock rebound
from near five-year lows.  “Nintendo is getting desperate,” said  Koichi Ogawa , chief
portfolio manager at Daiwa SB Investments Ltd. in Tokyo, which
manages $28 billion. “The video-game industry is in a tough
period with consumers shifting to playing on their
smartphones.”  Nintendo, the third-worst performer in the MSCI  Japan  Index
this year, rose 0.1 percent to 14,000 yen on the Osaka
Securities Exchange before the company released earnings. The
stock has fallen 41 percent in 2011.  Cheaper Than Vita  The price of the 3DS, released in February, will be lowered
to 15,000 yen from 25,000 yen in Japan starting Aug. 11, to
trigger “momentum” for the product before the year-end
shopping season, the company said. Prices will be cut overseas
before the end of September, it said.  The cuts will make the 3DS cheaper than the PlayStation
Vita portable player that  Sony Corp. (6758)  plans to introduce this
year.  Nintendo lowered its revenue forecast 18 percent to 900
billion yen. It also reduced the full-year operating profit
estimate by 80 percent to 35 billion yen.  The video-game maker kept a forecast to sell 16 million 3DS
players by the end of the March, betting the price cut will spur
demand. Nintendo cut its annual sales projections for the Wii
game console by 7.7 percent to 12 million and lowered the
forecast for previous-generation DS players by 18 percent to 9
million units.  Mario to the Rescue?  The company plans to introduce flagship titles such as
“Super Mario 3DLand” and “Mario Kart” in November and
December for the 3DS, the company said. Capcom Co. began selling
a game from the “Resident Evil” franchise for the 3DS this
fiscal year.  For the quarter ended June 30, Nintendo had a loss of 25.5
billion yen, as sales tumbled 50 percent, the company said.  Sony, Nintendo’s main domestic rival in games, today cut
its annual profit forecast after a slump in demand in the U.S.
and  Europe  led the company to lower its estimate for television
sales. Last month, Sony said the PSP Vita will sell from $249 in
the U.S., 249 euros ($359) in Europe and 24,980 yen in Japan.
The handheld game player will feature a five-inch display and a
rear touch pad.  Nintendo is also facing increasing competition from Apple,
which has sold more than 200 million devices capable of
downloading and playing games. Apple’s App Store offers a choice
of more than 100,000 game and entertainment applications to
users of the iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch.  Nintendo based its annual earnings estimates on exchange
rates of 80 yen against the dollar and 115 yen per euro,
compared with its previous rates of 83 yen and 120 yen
respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story::
