The FTSE/JSE  Africa  All Share Index
fell for a third day, closing at its lowest in a month as it
dropped 147.60 points, or 0.5 percent, to 31,446.39 by 5 p.m. in
Johannesburg.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today.  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  , the diversified mining company
that makes up 10 percent of the benchmark  stock index , closed at
its lowest in more than a week, dropping 3.35 rand, or 1
percent, to 327.40 rand. South African coal producers improved a
wage offer to striking workers, Solidarity union Deputy General
Secretary Dirk Hermann said. Details of the new offer by Anglo
American, Exxaro Resources Ltd., Optimum Coal Holdings and
Xstrata Plc haven’t been made public, Hermann said by phone
today.  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG)  , Africa’s largest gold
producer, fell for a fourth day, declining 8.97 rand, or 3.1
percent, to 281.11 rand. Members of the National Union of
Mineworkers in  South Africa  plan to start a strike over pay at
AngloGold,  Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI)  , and Harmony Gold Mining
Co. (HAR SJ) mines in South Africa today. Talks between the
union and the Chamber of Mines, which represents the three
companies, will resume tomorrow.  Harmony, Africa’s third-largest gold producer, declined
2.95 rand, or 3.1 percent, to 91.19 rand, its lowest close in
more than two weeks.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  , the world’s biggest mining
group, closed at its lowest in a month, slipping 1.25 rand, or
0.5 percent, to 253.75 rand. The group declared force majeure on
shipments from  Chile ’s Escondida copper mine, the world’s
largest, as a strike stretched into a seventh day with workers
threatening to take control of the site.  Calgro M3 Holdings Ltd. (CGR)  , a housing developer,
rallied to its highest since September 2008, gaining 25 cents,
or 29 percent, to 1.10 rand. Earnings per share will more than
triple in the six months through August, it said.  Investec Ltd. (INL)  , a private bank and wealth manager
with operations in South Africa,  Australia  and the U.K., slumped
to a month low, dropping 80 cents, or 1.5 percent, to 54 rand.
Operating conditions in the first quarter of its fiscal 2012
year were more difficult than anticipated, the bank said in an
interim management statement.  Mondi Ltd. (MND)  ,  Europe ’s largest maker of office
paper, declined the most in almost two weeks, sliding 1.22 rand,
or 2.2 percent, to 54.18 rand. Second-half performance will be
affected by the planned maintenance shutdown of “a number of”
its “large and strongly profitable European mills,” the group
said in its first-half results announcement.  Northam Platinum Ltd. (NHM)  , the operator of the world’s
deepest platinum mine, closed at its lowest since November 2009,
easing 91 cents, or 2.3 percent, to 38.09 rand. The company was
downgraded to “hold” from “buy” by Nic Dinham, an equity
analyst at Cadiz Securities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
