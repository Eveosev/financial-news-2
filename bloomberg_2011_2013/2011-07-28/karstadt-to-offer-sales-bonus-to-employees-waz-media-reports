Karstadt Warenhaus GmbH, the German
retailer, will pay bonuses based on how much employees sell,
starting Sept. 1, the WAZ newspaper group  said , citing an
interview with Chief Executive Officer Andrew Jennings.  The change could add several hundred euros to an employee’s
paycheck, he was quoted as saying in an e-mailed article to be
published in the Essen, Germany-based newspapers tomorrow.  Karstadt,  Germany ’s biggest department store chain, filed
for insolvency in 2009 and was acquired by U.S. investor Nicolas Berggruen in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
