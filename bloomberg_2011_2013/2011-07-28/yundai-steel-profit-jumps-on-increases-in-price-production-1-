Hyundai Steel Co. (004020) ,  South Korea ’s
second-biggest steelmaker, said second-quarter profit more than
doubled after increasing prices and production of automotive
sheets and ship-plates.  Net income climbed to 333.8 billion won ($317.3 million) in
the three months ended June 30 from a revised 130.3 billion won
a year earlier, the Incheon-based company said today in a
regulatory filing. Sales rose 50 percent to a record 4.05
trillion won.  The unit of Hyundai Motor Group last year started two
blast-furnaces, boosting production and sales of automotive
sheets that fetch higher prices. The company raised prices of
hot-rolled coils by about 18 percent in May and for re-enforcing
bars, used in construction, by 4 percent in March.  “We were able to post record sales and improve
profitability because product sales increased across the board
on a seasonal pick-up in demand and higher output from new
furnaces,” the company said today in a statement.  Sales are expected to increase to 15.7 trillion won this
year, higher than the 13.7 trillion won estimated in January,
the company said.  Hyundai Steel, the nation’s biggest construction-steel
maker, fell 1.5 percent to close at 133,000 won today in  Seoul .
The stock has advanced 6.8 percent this year, outperforming a
5.1 percent gain in the local benchmark Kospi stock index.  The earnings were announced today after the market closed.
Bigger rival  Posco (005490) , which dropped 4.1 percent this year, last
week reported a 22 percent gain in group net income for the
second quarter.  International Standards  Hyundai Steel’s operating profit increased 12 percent to
409 billion won in the April-to-June quarter, the company said.
The year-earlier figures released today were revised after the
company adopted the International Financial Reporting Standards
starting this year. Output of steel products climbed 35 percent
to 4.3 million tons in the quarter from a year earlier, it said.  Profit may decline this quarter because of maintenance
shutdowns and higher raw material costs before rebounding in the
final quarter, M.J. Bang, an analyst at HI Investment &
Securities Co., wrote in a July 14 report.  Iron ore  contract prices for the quarter ended June 30
climbed 25 percent from the previous three months and coal
prices increased 47 percent, the steelmaker said on April 28.
Third-quarter contract prices for iron ore may remain little
changed from the previous quarter, the company said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
