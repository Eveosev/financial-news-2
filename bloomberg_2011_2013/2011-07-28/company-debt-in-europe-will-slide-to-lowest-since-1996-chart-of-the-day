European corporate indebtedness will
slide to the lowest level in 16 years in 2012, a signal that the
two-year-old rally in the region’s stocks will extend its gains,
according to  Societe Generale  SA.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows how the benchmark Stoxx Europe
600 Index has entered two bull markets in the last decade, from
2003 to 2005 and since the end of 2009, as its constituent
members lowered a measure of their indebtedness. Companies’ net
debt as a proportion of earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization will fall its lowest level since
1996 next year, according to Societe Generale.  “Companies having had a near death experience want to
deleverage and this may continue for another year or so,” said
 Andy Lynch , who manages about $1.9 billion at Schroder
Investment Management Ltd. in London. “We are seeing a swing
back to sensible levels. It’s good for systemic stability of the
economy if you have fewer companies that are deeply indebted.”  The ratio of European companies’ debt to Ebitda will fall
to 0.8 in 2012, according to Societe Generale. The last time
that corporate debt dropped below Ebitda, European stocks
rallied 154 percent over the following five years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
