Vale SA (VALE3) , the world’s largest iron-
ore producer, said it’s planning to pay an extra dividend of $3
billion this year as it seeks to boost shareholder returns.  The Rio de Janeiro-based company will pay an additional
57.7 cents per share, according to a regulatory filing today
from Vale. The company had planned to pay at least $5 billion in
dividends in 2011, two-thirds more than last year, and said June
30 it will buy back as much as $3 billion of its shares.  “Vale’s strong cash generation and its excellent
performance perspectives allow the financing of growth
opportunities and the return of capital to shareholders,” the
company said. “The approval of this proposal by our board of
directors along with other decisions taken so far implies a
record return of cash to shareholders in 2011,” it said.  The stock gained 42 centavos, or 0.9 percent, to 46.27
reais in Sao Paulo trading today and dropped 4.6 percent this
year, compared with a 15 percent decline for the benchmark
Bovespa Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
