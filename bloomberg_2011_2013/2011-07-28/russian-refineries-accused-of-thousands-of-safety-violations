Russia’s industrial safety watchdog
discovered “thousands” of violations in a national inspection
of oil refineries.  The watchdog, known as Rostekhnadzor, has ordered companies
to close units at refineries visited by inspectors since last
year because of outdated production facilities, Nikolai Kutin,
the agency’s head, told reporters in Moscow today.  The Ryazan refinery, owned by TNK-BP, the Russian oil
producer half-owned by BP Plc, is “in particularly bad shape,”
he said. “It will require major investment to bring it into
normal condition.”  TNK-BP has received the results of the inspection and plans
to submit a detailed plan to the watchdog, Dmitry Sergeev, a
spokesman for the company, said by telephone.  “TNK-BP is working in close cooperation with the
inspection and oversight agencies and is pleased with the
objective nature of the inspection,” he said.  Russia is seeking to modernize its refineries and will
penalize  oil companies  for failing to upgrade their plants,
Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  said earlier this month.  The country may see an improvement at refineries in two to
three years, Kutin said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
