India fast-bowler  Zaheer Khan  will
miss the second cricket Test against England with a hamstring
injury, captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni said at a news conference.  Khan was injured taking 2-18 on day one of the opening Test
at Lord’s in London, which England won by 196 runs. The second
test begins tomorrow at Trent Bridge in Nottingham and back-ups
Munaf Patel and Sreesanth are among Dhoni’s options as
replacements.  England captain  Andrew Strauss  said today he’s confident
fast bowler Chris Tremlett, also bothered by a hamstring, will
be available. Tremlett, who claimed four wickets in the first
Test, sat out training yesterday and briefly bowled this morning
before having treatment.  “I think he’s fine, he’s had a bit of a niggle with the
hamstring,” Strauss said on the England and Wales Cricket
Board’s website. “At the moment we expect him to be fit for
tomorrow, but obviously like all things we’ll see in the
morning.”  England can overtake  India  at the top of the International
Cricket Council  rankings  if it wins the series by two Tests or
more. It would be the first time the English have been top-
ranked.  To contact the reporter on this story:
