Welcome to The Ticker, a blog written and produced by Bloomberg View's editors and columnists. What can you expect to find here? Well, economics, politics, finance, markets and more. Nothing is off limits. Most of the time, though, you'll find us at the corner of the political economy and  Wall Street . We will react to the news of the moment and to subjects that transcend the daily reports. We will crunch the numbers, so you don't have to. And we will draw on the vast data, analytics and news reporting resources of the extended Bloomberg organization. From time to time, we will dissect the ideological or partisan reactions that appear elsewhere. We have no singular economic philosophy, and we don't favor any demographic or geographic interests. Our goal, rather, is to start a conversation, one that might lead to a change in policy or reforms in a program. We'd prefer not to do this alone. In fact, we'd like for you to be involved, which is why there's a comment button at the bottom of this page. We hope you'll use it to let us know when you like what we're doing, or when you disagree and, most of all, to help us push the conversation forward.
