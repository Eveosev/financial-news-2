Aluminum stockpiles monitored by the
London Metal Exchange rose the most in almost seven months on an
increase in the Dutch city of Vlissingen.  Inventories climbed 92,425 metric tons, or 2.1 percent, the
most since Jan. 10, to 4.46 million tons, exchange data showed
today. Stockpiles gained for the first session in seven. Orders
to draw aluminum from warehouses, known as canceled warrants,
declined 7,575 tons to 386,225 tons.  Vlissingen registered a 100,000-ton delivery. Stockpiles at
the location have surged more than sixfold to 403,825 tons this
year. Pacorini Metals, acquired last year by commodities trader
Glencore International Plc, has warehouses at six local sites,
according to the LME website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
