LG Electronics Inc. (066570) , accused last
month of infringing  Siemens AG (SIE) ’s patents for light-emitting
diode technology, retaliated yesterday by filing a U.S.
International Trade Commission complaint of its own.  The case targets Munich-based Siemens’s Osram unit and
involves similar LED technology, according to a  notice  posted on
the ITC’s website. While a copy of the complaint filed by Seoul-
based LG wasn’t immediately available, companies in these cases
typically seek to block U.S. imports of products they say
infringe patents.  The dispute is over technology used in LED displays for TV
sets and monitors that require less energy than traditional
lighting. Osram last month filed complaints at the ITC and in
federal courts against LG and Samsung Electronics Co. over LEDs.
Samsung responded with its own ITC case against Osram, and LG
had submitted a complaint with the Korea Trade Commission.  “We are well prepared,” Stefan Schmidt, a spokesman for
Osram, said in an e-mail regarding LG’s complaint. “Osram holds
around 8,000 LED-related patents globally and has a long
standing tradition in handling  patent rights .”  The ITC in  Washington  is a quasi-judicial agency that
arbitrates trade disputes, and has the power to block products
that infringe U.S. patents. It typically completes its
investigations in 15 to 18 months.  The new case is In the Matter of Certain Light-Emitting
Diodes, Complaint No. 2837, U.S. International Trade Commission
(Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
