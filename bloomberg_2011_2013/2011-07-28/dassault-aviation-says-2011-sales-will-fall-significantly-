Dassault Aviation SA (AM) , the maker of
Rafale fighter planes, said sales will probably fall
“significantly” this year as it delivers fewer Falcon jets and
suffers from the dollar’s drop against the euro.  Net income fell 45 percent to 94 million euros ($135
million) in the first half excluding the impact of Dassault’s
holding in  Thales SA (HO) , the Paris-based company said in a
statement today. Sales dropped 34 percent to 1.32 billion euros.  Dassault said it expects to deliver 65 Falcon corporate
jets this year, down from a record 95 last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
