U.S. stock futures rose, signaling
the market may halt a three-day slump, as Cisco Systems Inc. and
DuPont Co. rallied and investor attention remained fixated on
 Washington  before a House vote on the debt limit.   Cisco climbed 2.4 percent as Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
advised buying the shares. DuPont advanced 2.6 percent after
increasing its full-year forecast. Exxon Mobil Corp. advanced
before reporting results, while Akamai Technologies Inc. and
Citrix Systems Inc. tumbled after the technology companies
forecast profit that missed analysts’ estimates.   Futures on the  S&P 500  expiring in September advanced 0.2
percent to 1,301.7 at 7:49 a.m. in  New York . The gauge has
retreated 3 percent over the past three days amid concern
lawmakers will fail to agree on an increase in the U.S. debt
ceiling. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose 21 points,
0.2 percent, to 12,265.  Lawmakers are continuing to wrangle over raising the U.S.
debt limit with less than a week before a potential default on
Aug. 2. The  House of Representatives  is set to vote today on
Republican  John Boehner ’s plan to boost the debt ceiling. The
proposal faces unified opposition from Democrats in the Senate,
who have a majority in the upper chamber.  Exxon, the world’s largest oil company, is among 62
companies in the S&P 500 due to release results today. Some 78
percent of companies in the gauge to have reported earnings
since July 11 have exceeded analyst estimates, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Data from the National Association of Realtors at 10 a.m.
in Washington may show the number of contracts to buy previously
owned U.S. homes fell in June for a second time in three months,
according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of
economists. Separate figures may show jobless claims fell to
415,000 last week from 418,000 the previous period.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
