National Bank of Canada (NA) , the
countryâ€™s sixth-largest bank, increased the size of its share
buyback program.  National Bank has received permission from the Toronto
Stock Exchange and Office of the Superintendent of Financial
Institutions to buy as many as 7.1 million common shares, or 4.4
percent of its outstanding stock, the Montreal-based lender said
today in a statement. Previously, it was authorized to buy back
as much as 3 percent under the program, which expires Jan. 31.  The amendment becomes effective Aug. 1, National Bank said.
The lender has already bought back 3.8 million shares this year
as of July 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
