Grain loadings for export from the
French port of Rouen,  Europe ’s biggest cereal-shipping hub, more
than doubled in the latest week on a surge in cargoes for
 Algeria  and sub-Saharan  Africa .  Outbound shipments were 120,975 metric tons from July 21 to
28, the  Seine River port  said in an e-mailed statement today,
almost triple the 40,840 tons shipped a week earlier. The
cargoes consisted of 104,975 tons of wheat and 16,000 tons of
barley.  Algeria was the biggest export destination with 51,950 tons
of wheat, more than double the prior week’s 25,070 tons,
followed by Cameroon with 22,700 tons of the grain.  Rouen accounted for 45 percent of  France ’s wheat exports in
2009-10, ahead of La Pallice on the Bay of Biscay, which shipped
out 19 percent, according to data from national crops office
FranceAgriMer.  Rouen grain loadings by destination, in tons:  To contact the reporter on this story:
