Inchcape Plc (INCH) , a U.K. auto dealer and
distributor operating in 26 countries, said first-half profit
rose 14 percent even though sales dropped, as demand for  luxury
vehicles  increased in  Russia  and other emerging markets.  Net income was 90 million pounds ($147 million), or 19.3
pence per share, up from 78.9 million pounds, or 17.1 pence per
share a year ago, the London-based company said in a statement
on the Regulatory News Service. Sales dropped 5.3 percent to 2.9
billion pounds.  Inchcape said it was hurt by weak economies in some of its
markets, as well as tight supplies of Japanese cars caused by
the earthquake and tsunami there. Two-thirds of the company’s
operating profit, excluding one-time items, came from Asia-
Pacific countries and emerging markets.  “While in some of our markets we will continue to
experience a temporary supply restriction on new cars as a
result of the earthquake in  Japan , we believe the group will
deliver a solid performance for 2011, in line with our
expectations,” the company said in the statement.  Inchcape said it will stock more Jaguar,  Land Rover  and
Porsche models in  China  in the second half, to meet demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
