Syria  is seeking to buy 100,000
metric tons of soft wheat to boost its reserves, the Syrian
General Establishment of Cereals Trade and Processing said.  The state agency will accept bids until Aug. 15, Bassam al
Hammed, head of its foreign-trade department, said in a
telephone interview from Damascus today.  “We are seeking to import wheat from one supplier and from
one origin,” Hammed said.  Syria this month purchased 127,366 tons of soft wheat,
comprised of 100,000 tons from an Egyptian supplier at 213 euros
($304) a ton and 27,366 tons from a Cypriot company at 205 euros
a ton, he said.  Syria may import more wheat this year, Hammed said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
