Bodycote Plc (BOY) , a U.K. supplier of
metal-strengthening services to  Ford Motor Co. (F) , would consider a
takeover bid, Chief Executive Officer Stephen Harris said today.  The company would be open to an offer “if somebody was to
come over the hill and pay a lot of money,” Harris said in a
telephone interview today, adding that the company hasn’t been
approached.  Bodycote rose 8 percent in London after saying first-half
profit was more than double last year’s figure. Shares closed at
388 pence, giving the company a market value of 741.8 million
pounds ($1.2 billion).  Adam Pinckard, a Goldman Sachs analyst, listed Bodycote on
July 26 among U.K. capital goods stocks which may be takeover
targets.  Harris said the company, which signed a 10-year contract
renewal to provide thermal processing services to Rolls-Royce
Holdings Plc in June, is planning similar long-term deals,
although he didn’t identify any companies.  Bodycote, which specializes in heat-treatment services for
the energy, auto and aerospace industries, said it expects full-
year profit to beat analysts’ forecasts as pretax profit for the
half grew to 40.3 million pounds from 19.1 million pounds in the
same period last year.  Bodycote said it signed a five-year 125 million-pound
revolving credit facility to replace two credit lines due to
mature in March 2013. The existing funding, for $20 million and
110 million pounds, were refinanced on “favorable terms,” the
company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
