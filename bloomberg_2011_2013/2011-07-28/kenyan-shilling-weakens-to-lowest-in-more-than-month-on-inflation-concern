Kenya ’s shilling dropped to the
weakest in a month against the dollar as the central bank
unexpectedly left its key lending rate unchanged, raising
concern that inflation in East Africa’s biggest economy will
remain more than triple the targeted rate.  The currency slipped as much as 0.3 percent to 91.10 per
dollar, the lowest since June 24, and was trading 0.2 percent
down at 91.00 by 12:26 p.m. in Nairobi, Kenya’s capital.  The monetary policy committee kept the rate at 6.25 percent
yesterday, with only one of seven economists surveyed by
Bloomberg expecting the decision. The committee said tighter
monetary policy would not curb inflation pressures from higher
food, fuel and energy costs, according to an e-mailed statement.  “The weakening of the shilling is on sustained demand for
the greenback and on the decision by the central bank to
maintain the rate, saying further tightening would not rein in
inflation as it’s cost-driven rather than as a result of  money
supply ,” Bernard Matimu, the chief dealer at Nairobi-based NIC
Bank Ltd., said by phone today.  Inflation accelerated 14.5 percent in June as food and fuel
costs surged. Aiming to bring price-growth back to the
government’s 5 percent target, the central bank increased the
benchmark  interest rate  twice this year, each time by a quarter
point, from a record low in January. It also raised mandatory
commercial bank reserves by the same margin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
