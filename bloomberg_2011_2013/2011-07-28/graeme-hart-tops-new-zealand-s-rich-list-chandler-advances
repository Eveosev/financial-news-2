Graeme Hart , owner of the world’s
second-largest drink-carton maker, retained his position as New
Zealand’s richest person, with an estimated NZ$6.5 billion ($5.7
billion), according to National Business Review’s 2011  Rich List .  Hart’s wealth rose from NZ$5.5 billion a year earlier, the
Review said. He has topped the list in nine of the past 10 years.
Last month, his Reynolds Group Holdings Inc. said it planned to
borrow $5 billion to buy York, Pennsylvania-based Graham
Packaging Co., a plastic container company with customers such
as PepsiCo Inc.  Second on the list is Richard Chandler, who’s wealth has
surged to NZ$4 billion from NZ$1.4 billion a year earlier. The
Singapore-based  investor  this month raised his stake in Sino-
Forest Corp., the Chinese tree-farm operator, to 15 percent.  The Todd family, with an estimated NZ$2.7 billion through
closely held Todd Corp. is third on the list. They have
interests in  New Zealand ’s largest oil and gas fields, as well
as in media and coal mining. Eamon Cleary, who owns Southland
dairy farms and commercial property in Queenstown, is worth an
estimated NZ$2 billion and ranks fourth.  Lynette Erceg, who sold her late husband Michael’s
Independent Distiller Group company in 2006 and has reinvested
in wine and property, is fifth with NZ$1.5 billion. Dubai-based
Christopher Chandler, Richard’s brother, is equal fifth with
NZ$1.5 billion, the Review said.  The 2011 list includes 151 entrants with a combined wealth
of NZ$45.2 billion, up from NZ$38.2 billion last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
