Reed Elsevier Plc (REL) , the owner of the
LexisNexis database, said first-half revenue fell 3 percent on
currency swings and as the company sold some assets.  Sales declined to 2.9 billion pounds ($4.74 billion) from
2.99 billion pounds a year earlier, the London-based company
said in a statement. Analysts had forecast 2.93 billion pounds,
according to the average of eight estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Adjusted for disposals and currency swings, sales
rose 1 percent.  Reed Elsevier last year sold off chunks of its trade
magazine unit, Reed Business Information, including all U.S.
publishing operations except Variety magazine. At the same time,
the company has increased investment in product development and
sales and marketing to tap growth in electronic data offerings.  Earnings, adjusted to exclude acquisitions and other
charges, rose to 22.3 pence per share from 21.3 pence a year
earlier, beating analysts’ 21.2-pence estimate from the
Bloomberg survey.  Sales at the company’s business information unit fell 8
percent and rose 2 percent on an adjusted basis. The unit had
strong growth in data services and online marketing solutions,
while still facing “difficult” print advertising markets, the
company said.  Reed Elsevier  also has divested publishing assets including
the Computer Weekly trade publication and the Excerpta Medica
medical communications agency.  Reed Elsevier fell 1 percent to 554 pence in London
trading. The shares have gained 2.3 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
