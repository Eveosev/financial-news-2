S-Oil Corp. (010950) ,  South Korea ’s third-
largest refiner, posted a fourfold increase in second-quarter
profit that missed estimates after it paid a fine and was
ordered by the government to cut fuel prices.  Net income climbed to 239.7 billion won ($228 million) in
the three months ended June 30 from a revised 53.7 billion won a
year earlier. That was less than the mean estimate of 398
billion won of two analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Profit fell
57 percent from the first quarter.  South Korea’s antitrust watchdog fined four refiners
including S-Oil in May for colluding to maintain their
respective market shares since March 2000 by rejecting requests
from gas stations to switch oil-product brands. Retail prices of
fuels were cut by 100 won a liter for three months starting
April 7 as the government sought to curb inflation.  The company accounted for 45 billion won in fines in the
quarter, Chief Financial Officer Ryu Yeol told investors on a
conference call today. The refiner rejected the regulator’s
claim.  S-Oil fell 1.3 percent to 158,000 won as of 1:47 p.m in
Seoul trading, headed for the biggest drop since July 19.
 Korea ’s benchmark Kospi stock index declined 1 percent.  Operating profit, or sales minus the cost of goods sold and
administrative expenses, rose 13 percent to 241.8 billion won
from a year earlier. Sales rose 63 percent to a record 8.03
trillion won, according to the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
