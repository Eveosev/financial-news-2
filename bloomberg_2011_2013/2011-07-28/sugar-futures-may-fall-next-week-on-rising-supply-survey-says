Raw sugar may decline next week on
signs that global supplies will outpace demand.  Seven of 10 traders, analysts and brokers surveyed by
Bloomberg News said raw sugar in  New York  would fall. Two said
it would gain, while one was neutral. Before today, futures for
October delivery fell 4.5 percent this week to 29.92 cents a
pound on ICE Futures U.S.  Seven respondents said refined sugar on London’s NYSE Liffe
would fall, while one forecast a gain. Two expected little
change. Futures for October delivery fell 2.9 percent this week
through yesterday.  Four respondents said refined-sugar’s premium over raw
would narrow, two said it would widen, and four were neutral.  -- Editors: Millie Munshi, Daniel Enoch  To contact the reporters on this story:
