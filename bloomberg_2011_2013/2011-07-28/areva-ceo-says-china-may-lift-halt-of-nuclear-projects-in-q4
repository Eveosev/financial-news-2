Areva SA Chief Executive Officer Luc
Oursel said he “understands” that  China  may lift a suspension
on new builds for nuclear plants in the fourth quarter.  The Chinese government is showing a “growing interest” in
third-generation technologies, and won’t give up its plan for a
“very strong development of its nuclear fleet” because of
growing energy needs and a will to limit greenhouse gas
emissions, Oursel said on a conference call today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
