The  United Arab Emirates , the
second-biggest Arab economy, said the dirham’s peg to the U.S.
dollar is “steady and consistent” even as U.S. lawmakers
remained deadlocked over the country’s debt limit.  “No fear on the U.S. dollar, although it is exposed to
price fluctuations as it happens with all the major
currencies,” the Abu Dhabi-based central bank said in an e-
mailed statement today. “Despite the fact that the central bank
foreign reserves are mostly denominated in U.S. dollars, they
are invested mostly in non-U.S. assets.”  The central bank doesn’t hold U.S. Treasury bonds “or any
other financial instruments issued by the U.S. government due to
the very low return on holding these instruments,” it said.  The U.A.E. and  Saudi Arabia  are among five members of the
Gulf Cooperation Council that keep their currencies pegged to
the dollar. Kuwait links its dinar to a currency basket.  The Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives remains on
a collision course with the Senate and the White House over
competing plans to increase the country’s debt limit. President
 Barack Obama  has threatened a veto of House Speaker  John
Boehner ’s two-step plan to raise the debt ceiling.  Standard & Poor’s , which has given the U.S. a top ranking
since 1941, reiterated July 21 that the chance of a downgrade is
50 percent in the next three months. The ratings firm said it
may cut the nation as soon as August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
