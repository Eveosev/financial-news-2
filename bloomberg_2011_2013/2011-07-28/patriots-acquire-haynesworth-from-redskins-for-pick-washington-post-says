The  New England Patriots  acquired
defensive tackle Albert Haynesworth from the  Washington Redskins 
for a fifth-round draft pick, the Washington Post reported,
citing three people in the  National Football League  that it
didnâ€™t identify. Haynesworth clashed with coach Mike Shanahan
last year, and was suspended for the final month of the season.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
