The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default increased, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index climbed 3 basis points to
119 basis points as of 10:21 a.m. in Sydney, according to Credit
Agricole CIB prices. Thatâ€™s on course for its highest close
since July 20, CMA prices in New York show.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  rose 2.5 basis points to 118 as of 8:21
a.m. in  Hong Kong , Credit Agricole prices show.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index advanced 1 basis point to 121
as of 9:12 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
