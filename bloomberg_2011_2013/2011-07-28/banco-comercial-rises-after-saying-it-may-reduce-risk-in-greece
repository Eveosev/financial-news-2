Banco Comercial Portugues SA (BCP) ,
Portugal’s second-biggest lender, rose as much as 5.6 percent in
Lisbon trading after saying the company may reduce risk in
Greece by merging a unit and re-evaluate its business in Poland.  BCP gained as much as 2 euro cents to 32 cents and traded
at 31 cents at 1:50 p.m. That pares the stock’s loss this year
to 43 percent.  The company said in a presentation yesterday in Lisbon that
it has an “option to integrate” its Millennium bank in Greece
through a merger with another lender in the country. The firm
also is reclassifying its European assets as “non-core,” Chief
Executive Officer Carlos Santos Ferreira said at the
presentation.  The company, which also operates in  Romania , said as
recently as July 14 that Poland was still “a core operation”
and wasn’t in talks to sell the unit. Santos Ferreira declined
to elaborate on the plans for the division.  Portugal became the third country after Ireland and Greece
to request external aid amid the sovereign-debt crisis in
Europe. Greece has seen its  credit rating  cut by Moody’s
Investors Service by three steps to Ca, its second lowest, while
 Standard & Poor’s  lowered its rating to CC, two levels above
default, as the European Union’s rescue for that nation is seen
to amount to a default.  To contact the reporter on this story:
