Cap Gemini SA (CAP)  said first-half profit
rose as sales climbed in  North America  and emerging markets,
falling just short of analysts’ estimates.  Net income at the Paris-based computer services company
increased 26 percent to 127 million euros ($182 million),
compared with a 101 million-euro profit in the year-earlier
period, Cap Gemini said in a statement. Analysts had predicted
profit of 132 million euros, according to the average of six
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The company confirmed its full-
year outlook.  Computer-services and software companies are looking to
capitalize on a rebound in corporate spending on information
technology projects delayed during the global economic crisis.
 International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) , the world’s largest
computer-services provider, earlier this month raised its profit
forecast after reporting sales that beat analysts’ estimates.  North American sales rose 12.1 percent in the first half,
while those in other regions outside Europe climbed 13.3
percent. Overall revenue rose 13 percent to 4.8 billion euros.  Along with competitors like Atos SA,  Cap Gemini  is
expanding its offerings in the energy sector and in technologies
like social media to offset dependence on traditional computing
projects. The company this month announced plans for a service
that will analyze social media activity for clients, pushing
into an area increasingly targeted by start-ups.  To contact the reporter on this story:
