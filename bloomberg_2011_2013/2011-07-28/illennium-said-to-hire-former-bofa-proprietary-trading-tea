Millennium Management LLC, the $11.3
billion hedge fund run by Israel Englander, hired a proprietary-
trading team formerly at  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , according to a
person familiar with the matter.  Linus Wright, 41, and his eight-person team will start at
Millennium’s London offices next month, said the person, who
asked not be identified because the information is private. Dave Millar, a spokesman for the New York-based company, declined to
comment on the appointments.  Englander said in November that it was the best time in 15
years to hire traders as banks shuttered their proprietary-
trading businesses to comply with U.S. financial legislation
that bars them from trading with their own money. Bank of
America, based in  Charlotte ,  North Carolina , last month shut a
15-person proprietary bond-trading unit run by  Scott Brown ,
three people briefed on the decision said on June 10.  Wright’s team, which left the bank in April, had traded
relative value, a strategy that seeks to profit from differences
in prices of various markets. The London-based group was part of
Bank of America’s proprietary-trading business before the firm
bought Merrill Lynch & Co. in 2009.  Wright joined Bank of America in 2007. His team includes
Paul Cloke, Suketu Shah and Stephanie Allen, the person said.  Englander, 62, who worked as a floor broker on the  American
Stock Exchange , founded Millennium in 1989 with $35 million. The
firm employs more than 110 portfolio managers, according to its
 website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
