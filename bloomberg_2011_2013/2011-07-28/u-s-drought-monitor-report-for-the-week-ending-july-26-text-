Following is the text of the weekly
 U.S. Drought Monitor  as released by the National Drought
Mitigation Center in Lincoln,  Nebraska :  Weekly Weather Summary:  A record-setting heat wave gripped most
areas from the Plains to the East Coast. The combination of high
temperatures, oppressive humidity, and a lack of overnight
cooling resulted in significant stress on humans, animals, and
crops.  In contrast, cool weather prevailed in the Pacific Coast
States.  Meanwhile, little or no rain fell from the southern
Plains into the lower Ohio Valley.  The combination of heat and
a lack of rain caused further devastation in the drought-ravaged
south-central U.S. and brought the season’s first round of
stress to some Midwestern crops.  The Midwest’s problems were
compounded by the fact that for some corn and soybeans, the heat
wave coincided with the reproductive stage of development.  Late
in the week, however, beneficial rain fell across an area of
emerging dryness from  Iowa  into the lower Great Lakes region.
Areas to the south, however, including the middle Mississippi
Valley, remained dry.  Hot weather also contributed to an
increase in crop stress in parts of the East.  Rain tempered the
heat’s effects in some areas.  Farther west, beneficial monsoon
showers dotted the Southwest.  The Midwest and Northeast: Record-setting heat affected both
regions for several days.  On July 18, Rochester, Minnesota, set
an all-time record with a dewpoint of 83F (previously, 82F on
July 12 and 13, 1995).  On July 19, Aberdeen, South Dakota,
reported its first triple-digit heat since July 7, 2007, while
Moline,  Illinois , registered a 100-degree day for the first time
since July 17, 2006.  Even more impressively, Rockford, Illinois
(100F on July 19), tallied its first high of 100F or greater
since July 10, 1989, while Indianapolis, IN (100F on July 21),
experienced its hottest day since August 16, 1988. Later,
record-shattering heat spread into the East.  On July 22, highs
soared to 108F in Newark,  New Jersey , and downtown Baltimore,
Maryland.  Newark’s former all-time record of 105F had been set
on August 9, 2001, and several earlier dates.  Downtown
Baltimore’s reading missed the Maryland state record by 1F.
All-time-record highs were also set or tied on July 22 in
locations such as Virginia’s Dulles Airport (105F; previously,
104F on August 20, 1983, and July 16, 1988); Bridgeport,
Connecticut (103F; tied the record set on July 22, 1957);
Reading,  Pennsylvania  (106F; previously, 105F on August 7,
1918); and Georgetown, Delaware (104F; previously, 102F on July
31, 1954, and July 6, 2010).  A July record was set in Portland,
 Maine  (100F on July 22), where it was the hottest day since
August 2, 1975 (103F).  In Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (96F on July
22), it was the hottest day since August 15, 1995.  In some
locations, including Reading (102, 106, and 100F from July 21-
23), daily-record highs were set on 3 days in a row.  At the
height of the heat wave, all-time records for the highest
minimum temperature were set or tied in numerous locations,
including  Newark  (86F on July 22);  Washington , D.C. (84F on July
23 and 24);  New York ’s Central Park (84F on July 22); and
Scranton, Pennsylvania (80F on July 22).  In Omaha, Nebraska,
the minimum temperature remained at 80F or higher from July 17-
20, marking the second-longest such streak on record behind 8
days from July 18-25, 1934.  However, as the heat relaxed, heavy
rain erupted in a few areas, especially from eastern Iowa into
northern Illinois.  In particular, July 23 was the wettest day
on record in  Chicago , Illinois, where 6.86 inches fell
(previously, 6.64 inches on September 13, 2008).  The heat wave struck at an inopportune time for crops, resulting
in a broad expansion of D0A.  In Pennsylvania, the portion of
the corn crop rated in very poor to poor condition jumped from
11 to 30% between July 17 and 24.  During the same period,
 Missouri  noted an increase from 16 to 22%.  By July 24, the
portion of pastures rated in very poor to poor condition stood
at 62% in Pennsylvania and 53% in  Maryland .  Nearly all (92%) of
Pennsylvania’s topsoil moisture was rated very short to short,
along with 80% in Maine, 73% in New York, 72% in Michigan, and
53% in Indiana.  The Southeast: Scattered showers helped to offset the effects of
heat in some areas.  Rainfall was heaviest in the central Gulf
Coast region and along the western slopes of the central and
southern Appalachians, resulting in some modest improvements in
the drought depiction. Meanwhile, short-term dryness (D0A) began
to push northeastward across the Mid-South, reaching into
central Missouri and western sections of Kentucky and Tennessee.
In  Arkansas , nearly two-thirds (66%) of the pastures were rated
in very poor to poor condition on July 24, while topsoil
moisture was 86% very short to short.  Ft. Smith, Arkansas,
reported 22 consecutive days of 100?F heat (and counting) from
July 5-26, shattering its previous record of 17 days in July
1934.  In the Southeast, some lingering poor crop conditions
were noted on July 24. In Alabama, for example, nearly one-third
of the peanuts (32%) and cotton (33%) were rated very poor to
poor.  On the same date, 37% of Georgia’s cotton was rated very
poor to poor.  In  Florida , concern still exists for Lake
Okeechobee, which had an average surface elevation of 10.26 feet
on July 26.  This level is 3.71 feet below the level observed a
year earlier, on July 26, 2010.  The Central and Southern Plains: Disastrously hot, dry
conditions persisted across much of the drought region, which
extended as far north as southeastern Colorado and the southern
half of Kansas.  In northern  Texas , Amarillo’s tally of 100?F
readings reached 30 days on July 26; the former annual record of
26 days had been set in 1953.  Elsewhere in Texas, Tyler
recorded 29 consecutive days (and counting) of 100-degree heat
from June 28 to July 26, demolishing its record of 20 days in a
row set from July 15 to August 3, 1998.  From 1995-2010, the
coverage of Texas rangeland and pastures in very poor to poor
condition peaked at 81% in August 1998 and 2006; on July 24,
2011, coverage stood at 91%. The rangeland and pasture situation
was nearly as bad in  Oklahoma  (84% very poor to poor) and Kansas
(52%).  One of the region’s hardest-hit row crops was cotton,
with 79% rated very poor to poor in Oklahoma and 59% in Texas.
Spotty showers dotted western and southern Texas, as well as the
central and southern High Plains, but in many cases temporary
drought relief was more than offset by the relentless heat.  One
exception was extreme southeastern Texas, where heavy rain took
a bite out of the extreme to exceptional drought.  The Southwest: A plume of tropical moisture triggered scattered
monsoon showers.  Some of the most widespread rain fell from
southeastern Arizona into northeastern  New Mexico  and
southeastern Colorado.  However, only minimal changes were
introduced, as the rain provided only limited and localized
relief from a serious drought situation.  On July 24, USDA rated
89% of New Mexico’s rangeland and pastures in very poor to poor
condition.  Puerto Rico, Hawaii, and Alaska: No changes were introduced in
Puerto Rico (no dryness or drought), Hawaii, or Alaska.  Hawaii
is currently in the midst of its dry season; long-term rainfall
deficits persist across portions of the central and eastern
Hawaiian Islands.  Meanwhile, patchy dryness lingered across
south-central and southeastern Alaska.  Looking Ahead: During the next 5 days (July 28 to August 1),
Tropical Storm Don will cross the  Gulf of Mexico , contributing
to late-week rainfall in the central and western Gulf Coast
States.  The degree of drought relief provided by Don will
depend upon the storm’s intensity, as well as the track and
forward speed.  Meanwhile, the Southwestern monsoon circulation
interacting with a cold front will produce widespread showers
and thunderstorms from the Four Corners region into the northern
Plains, Midwest, and Northeast.  Showers will increase in
coverage over the Southeast, but hot, mostly dry conditions will
persist from the southern Plains into the Ohio Valley and
northern Mid-Atlantic region.  The CPC 6- to 10-day outlook for August 2-6 calls for hotter-
than-normal weather east of a line from New Mexico to  Minnesota ,
excluding New England, while below-normal temperatures will be
confined to the northern Rockies, northern  California , and the
Pacific Northwest. Meanwhile, wetter-than-normal conditions will
arc across the Four Corners region, northern Plains, Midwest,
Ohio Valley, and southern Mid-Atlantic States, but the remainder
of the U.S. will experience near-to below-normal rainfall.  SOURCE: National Drought Mitigation Center  To contact the reporter on this story:
