 Acquirers who buy more than 25
percent of an Indian company will have to make a public offer
for a further 26 percent of outstanding shares under takeover
rules proposed by  India â€™s markets regulator, a person familiar
with the matter said.  The Securities and Exchange Board of India requires
companies to make a so-called open offer for an additional 20
percent, after they crossed a threshold of 15 percent, the
person said declining to be identified before an official
announcement. The proposed open offer requirement is less than a
recommendation last year, by a SEBI panel, that acquirers make
an offer for all remaining shares in a company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
