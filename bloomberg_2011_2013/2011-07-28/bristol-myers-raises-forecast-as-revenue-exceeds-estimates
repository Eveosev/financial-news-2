Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY) , whose
best-selling blood thinner Plavix faces generic competition next
year, raised its 2011 profit forecast after second-quarter sales
of nine of its 10 top drugs exceeded analysts’ estimates.  The New York-based company raised its forecast, excluding
certain items, by 10 cents to a range of $2.20 to $2.30 a share,
compared with a $2.21 average estimate of 18 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg. Second-quarter revenue jumped 14 percent to $5.43
billion, topping the $5.05 billion average estimate of 13
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Bristol-Myers has been developing new medicines and
divesting nondrug businesses as it prepares for U.S. competition
to Plavix, whose sales topped analysts’ estimates with a 15
percent gain in the quarter. Its skin-cancer drug, Yervoy, won
U.S. approval in March and brought in $95 million in sales,
beating estimates. The company said it plans to apply for
approval of its next-generation blood thinner, apixaban, in the
second half of this year.  “Bristol-Myers remains hands down the best pipeline story
among the U.S. and European pharmaceutical companies we cover,”
said  Tim Anderson , an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., in
a note to clients today. “2011 is likely to be a buy year.”  Net income for the quarter declined 2.7 percent to $902
million, or 52 cents a share, from $927 million, or 53 cents, a
year earlier. Excluding one-time restructuring and tax charges,
profit climbed to 56 cents a share, exceeding the 55 cents
estimated by 16 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Exchange Rates  Bristol-Myers climbed 44 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $29.05
at 4 p.m. in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading. The
stock has gained 16 percent in the past 12 months.  Profit for the quarter was tempered by higher taxes and
expenses. The effective  tax rate  was 27 percent, compared with
20 percent a year ago. Marketing, selling and administrative
expenses increased 16 percent to $1 billion for the quarter.
Research and development costs rose 12 percent to $923 million.  Fees and drug discounts required in the U.S. health-care
law passed last year reduced earnings by 3 cents a share and
will subtract 25 cents a share for the year, the company said.  Revenue for the quarter was boosted by favorable exchange
rates for medicines sold outside the U.S. The dollar fell 14
percent from the end of 2010’s second quarter to June 30 of this
year, as measured against a basket of six currencies. The
currency adjustment accounted for 4 percentage points of the
company’s 14 percent sales growth.  Reiterates Forecast  Bristol-Myers reiterated its 2013 profit forecast of at
least $1.95 a share. Analysts estimated $2 a share.  Revenue from Plavix, the world’s second-biggest-selling
medicine, was $1.87 billion, beating the average analyst
estimate of $1.72 billion. Plavix is co-marketed with Paris-
based  Sanofi-Aventis SA. (SAN)  The drug faces generic competition in
the U.S. in May 2012 and already faces generic challengers in
 Europe . New York-based  Pfizer Inc. (PFE) ’s cholesterol pill Lipitor is
the world’s top-selling drug.  Sales of the antipsychotic drug Abilify increased 12
percent to $706 million, topping the $633 million average
estimate. Revenue from the HIV drug Reyataz climbed 11 percent
to $396 million, and the Sustiva AIDS medicine increased 12
percent to $371 million.  Sales of the Avapro and Avalide treatments for  blood
pressure  fell 18 percent to $251 million. Avalide pills were
recalled after a manufacturing glitch was discovered that could
reduce the drug’s effectiveness. Two of the three dosages that
were recalled were back on the market in February. The third
dosage remains unavailable, according to the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
