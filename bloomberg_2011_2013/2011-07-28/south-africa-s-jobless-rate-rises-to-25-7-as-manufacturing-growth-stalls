South Africa ’s jobless rate, the
highest of 61 countries tracked by Bloomberg, increased to 25.7
percent in the second quarter as the recovery in Africa’s
biggest economy waned.  The unemployment rate rose from 25 percent in the first
quarter, Statistics South Africa said in a report released in
Pretoria today. The number of people without work surged 174,000
to 4.5 million.  Manufacturing, which makes up 15 percent of the economy,
grew 0.6 percent in May from the year earlier, the statistics
office said on July 12, while retail sales were unchanged in the
same period. The weak economy may undermine the government’s
goal of creating 5 million new jobs by 2020 in order to reduce
the  unemployment rate  to 15 percent.  “Our unemployment levels are unacceptably high and pose a
risk to the stability of our society,” Mathews Phosa,
treasurer-general of the ruling  African National Congress , said
in a speech in Johannesburg today.  The rand was at 6.6868 against the dollar as of 2:33 p.m.
in Johannesburg, little changed from 6.6880 before the data was
released.  Unemployment increased as the economy failed to create
enough jobs for new entrants into the labor market, the
statistics office said. Employment increased by 7,000 to 13.1
million, it said.  Job Opportunities Static  “There are more people looking for work,” Peter Buwembo,
manager of labor market statistics, told reporters in Pretoria.
“The jobs on offer have remained almost the same for the last
two quarters.”  Manufacturing lost 68,000 jobs last quarter, while
employment in the  mining industry  fell by 31,000, the statistics
office said. The retail trade industry cut 18,000 jobs and
agriculture lost 5,000.  The biggest increase was in the finance industry, which
added 73,000 jobs, followed by construction with 12,000, the
statistics office said.  Wage demands have increased this year even as jobs were
shed. Petroleum and chemical workers ended an 18-day strike
today that interrupted supplies from refineries owned by  Sasol
Ltd. (SOL) , Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BP Plc and caused fuel
shortages. Employers agreed to increase salaries between 8.5
percent and 10 percent, double the 5 percent inflation rate.  The  Reserve Bank , which left its benchmark interest rate
unchanged at a 30-year low of 5.5 percent on July 21, expects
the economy to expand 3.7 percent this year and 3.9 percent in
2012. The National Treasury has estimated it needs 7 percent
annual growth over the next decade in order to meet its jobs
target.  To contact the reporters on this story:
