Russia ’s grain exports in July may
beat a nine-year record as shipments are expected to reach 2
million metric tons, Moscow-based researcher SovEcon  said  on its
website today.  In July 2010, Russia exported 1.9 million tons, the most
since 2002. Exports failed to exceed 1 million tons in the same
month in the 2002-08 period, SovEcon said.  A discount for Russian wheat to world prices is the main
cause of this month’s increase, the researcher said. On July 26,
traders sold 120,000 tons of the cereal to  Egypt  at $249.47 a
ton and $250.40 a ton on a free-on-board basis for shipment in
the last 10 days of August. The spot price in  New Orleans  for
No. 2 soft red winter wheat yesterday was $7.4725 a bushel,
equating to $274.56 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
