Edscha North America Inc., the
former maker of car door hinges, received court approval of its
liquidation plan.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Carol Doyle said at a hearing today
in  Chicago  that she will confirm the Chapter 11 plan proposed
jointly by the company and the committee representing its
creditors with unsecured claims, according to a clerk in her
office.  Edscha filed for Chapter 11 creditor protection in October
2009, three months after it ceased manufacturing, citing the
“negative trends in the North American automobile market.” It
sold off most its assets after the filing. Liabilities totaled
$672.4 million at the time of the petition.  The company, based in Birmingham,  Michigan , was a
subsidiary of Edscha AG, which filed for insolvency in  Germany 
in 2009 and said it could no longer subsidize its American unit.
Edscha was owned by U.S.-based buyout firm  Carlyle Group .  The judge also today approved Edscha’s disclosure
statement, a document that outlines the reorganization plan to
creditors who will vote on it. In this case, approval of the
disclosure statement and the plan itself were combined at the
same hearing to reduce legal and administrative costs, according
to court papers. The hearing was held over two days, starting on
July 21.  Edscha’s plan includes a payment of $694,000 to settle
claims by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. that amounted to
$11.8 million.  The case is In re Edscha North America, 09-39055, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Illinois (Chicago).  To contact the reporter on this story:
