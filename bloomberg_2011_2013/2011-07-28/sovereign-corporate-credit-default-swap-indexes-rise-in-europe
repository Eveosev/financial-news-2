The cost of insuring against default
on European sovereign and corporate debt rose, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments rose 2 basis points to 270 at 8:40 a.m. in London.
An increase signals deteriorating perceptions of  credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40 companies with
mostly high-yield credit ratings increased 4 basis points to
438, the highest in more than a week, according to JPMorgan
Chase & Co.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings rose 1 basis point to 116.5 basis
points. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers climbed 4 basis points to 175.5 and the
subordinated index climbed 6.5 to 309.5.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.4 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
