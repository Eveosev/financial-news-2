Gold may decline as a rally to a
record on debt concerns in the U.S. and  Europe  prompts some
investors to sell the metal, a survey found.  Twenty of 33 traders, investors and analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg, or 61 percent, said bullion will fall next week. Ten
predicted higher prices and three were neutral. Gold for
December delivery was up 0.6 percent for this week at $1,610.80
an ounce by 11:40 a.m. yesterday on the Comex in  New York . It
reached an all-time high of $1,631.20 on July 27.  Demand for a protection of wealth boosted bullion to a
record on concern that Europe will struggle to contain its debt
burden and as U.S. lawmakers battled over how to raise the
country’s debt limit in time to avoid a default. The metal is
set for an 11th straight annual gain, the longest winning streak
since at least 1920 in  London , and touched all-time highs last
week priced in euros and pounds.  “After gaining almost 10 percent from its lowest level in
July and hitting multi nominal highs in July, we expect some
profit-taking to take place,” said Bayram Dincer, an analyst at
LGT Capital Management in Pfaeffikon,  Switzerland .  The attached chart tracks the results of the Bloomberg
survey, with the red bars derived by subtracting bearish
forecasts from bullish estimates. Readings below zero signal
that most respondents expect a decline. The green line shows the
gold price. The data are as of July 22.  The weekly gold survey, which started seven years ago, has
forecast prices accurately in 215 of 373 weeks, or 58 percent of
the time.  This week’s survey results: Bullish: 10 Bearish: 20 Neutral: 3  To contact the reporter on this story:
