Italy sold 6.5 billion of bills
($9.3 billion) today and borrowing costs fell from the previous
sale after the  European Central Bank  began buying the country’s
bonds, leading to a plunge in yields this week.  Italy sold its one-year bills to yield 2.959 percent, down
from 3.67 percent at last auction on July 12. Demand was 1.94
times the amount on offer, compared with 1.55 times last month.  The yield on the country’s benchmark 10-year bond has
dropped 100 basis points this week as the ECB began purchasing
Italian and Spanish bonds. Prior to the ECB action, the
countries’ yields had surged to euro-era records on concern the
countries would become the next victims of the region’s debt
crisis. Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  agreed to speed up
austerity and balance the country’s budget in 2013, a year
earlier than planned, to secure the ECB’s support.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Italian 10-year
bonds over German bunds fell 3 basis points to 278 basis points.
That spread has narrowed 138 basis points since reaching a euro-
era record 416 basis points on Aug. 5.  The surge in Italian bond yields has raised concern about
the sustainability of the euro-region’s second-biggest debt,
which ended last year at 1.8 trillion euros. Italy still faces
75 billion euros of maturing treasury bills this year and needs
to sell about 80 billion euros of bonds to pay for redemptions
and cover the  budget deficit .  The biggest test for Italian financing will come in
September when about 46 billion euros of bonds mature.  To contact the reporter on this story:
