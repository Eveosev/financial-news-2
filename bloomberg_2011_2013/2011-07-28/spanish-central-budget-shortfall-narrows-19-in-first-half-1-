Spain ’s central-government budget
deficit narrowed 19 percent in the first half, putting the
administration ahead of schedule to meet its full-year target.  The central government reported a 24.1 billion-euro ($34.5
billion) deficit, or 2.2 percent of gross domestic product,
compared with 29.8 billion euros, or 2.8 percent of GDP, a year
earlier. The government has a 2011 target of 4.8 percent of GDP,
as part of the overall budget-deficit goal of 6 percent of GDP.
Tax revenue rose 4.2 percent in the six months.  Central budget cuts that go beyond what the government has
forecast may leave room for slippage in regional administrations
that are struggling to pay bills amid a slump in taxes linked to
real estate. Socialist Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero has cut wages and frozen pensions in his efforts to
shield Spain from  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis.  “Everything points to us meeting the target this year,”
Deputy Finance Minister Juan Manuel Lopez Carbajo told reporters
in  Madrid  today. The overall public-sector shortfall, which
combines regions, the central government, town halls and the
social security system, is also “on the right track,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
