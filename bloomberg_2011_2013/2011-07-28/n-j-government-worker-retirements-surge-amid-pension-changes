Retirements among New Jersey state
and local-government workers more than doubled in the month
before Governor  Chris Christie  signed a bill raising their
pension and health-care costs.  A total of 11,385 people enrolled in the Public Employee
Retirement System have filed since January to leave the
workforce this year, according to state Treasury Department
records. In all of last year, about 10,700 retired. If
applications continue at the current pace, almost 13,000 state
and local workers would retire this year, an increase of more
than 20 percent.  “Some folks will look to get out of the system with change
on the horizon,”  Kevin Roberts , a spokesman for Christie, said
in an e-mail. “It’s not at all unexpected when you’re talking
about the kind of significant, overdue reforms that are needed
to fix the long-term health of the system.”  Christie, a first-term Republican, signed the pension and
benefits legislation on June 28, less than a week after he got
the Democratic-led Legislature to approve the measure. The bill
will increase workers’ pension contributions by 2 percent of
salaries and require them to eventually pay as much as 35
percent of the cost of insurance premiums based on income, up
from the 1.5 percent of salary now.  In June, 1,688 state and local workers filed retirement
applications, compared with 675 for the same month in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
