Investors in Greek government bonds
will make a “significant” contribution to a second aid package
for the debt-laden country as they’ll have to write down
their claims by 21 percent, German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble   told  Passauer Neue Presse.  The “overall direction” of aid for  Greece  and the setup
of the European Financial Stability Facility and the European
Stability Mechanism, the euro backstop from 2013, have the
“broad support” of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s ruling
coalition, the newspaper cited Schaeuble as saying in an article
published today.  The government and parliament will decide in the fall how
to divide responsibilities for approving aid disbursements by
the euro backstops, Schaeuble said. Both sides will make sure
that the institutions can act quickly without undermining
parliament’s budgetary rights, he said.  Germany  wants to help bring know-how and investment to
Greece, Schaeuble said, citing renewable energy, logistics,
tourism and agriculture as areas that can help boost the
economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
