Canadian stocks rose for the first
time this week as better-than-forecast economic reports from the
U.S. offset concern that lawmakers there won’t be able to reach
an agreement to raise the debt ceiling and avoid default.  Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC) ,  Canada ’s largest insurer, rose
1.3 percent, as financial shares gained after U.S. jobless
claims and home sales figures beat expectations.  Goldcorp Inc. (G) ,
the second-biggest producer of the metal by market value,
dropped 3.6 percent as bullion futures retreated from a record
and the company cut its production forecast.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index gained 15.11
points, or 0.1 percent, to 13,047.78 at 4 p.m. in Toronto. It
had fallen as much as 0.8 percent and risen as much as 0.6
percent.  “You have an investment base right now that is pretty
unsettled because of the prospect of what could happen if there
isn’t a decision next week,” Gareth Watson, vice president of
 investment management  at Richardson GMP Ltd. in Toronto said in
a telephone interview. Richardson oversees about C$16 billion
($16.6 billion).  The stock benchmark sank 3 percent in the previous two
sessions, the most for a two-day period in almost 13 months, as
U.S. lawmakers fought over rival plans to raise the country’s
debt ceiling and that country reported a decline in durable-
goods orders. Seventy-five percent of Canadian exports went to
the U.S. last year, according to  Statistics Canada .  Jobless Claims  An index of financial shares in the S&P/TSX rose after
closing yesterday at a seven-month low. U.S. Labor Department
figures showed that applications for  unemployment benefits 
dropped last week to the lowest level since April, signifying
that the weakness in the labor market is fading. Another report
showed the number of contracts to buy previously owned homes
unexpectedly increased in June.  Royal Bank of Canada, the largest Canadian lender, gained
1.4 percent to C$52.05. Manulife Financial, North America’s
fourth-largest insurer, increased 1.3 percent to C$15.34.  Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. increased 4.8 percent to
C$60.81. The company reported second-quarter net income of 75
Canadian cents a share, beating the 72-cent average of analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The shares were raised to “top
pick” from “outperform” at  RBC Capital Markets .  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU) , Canada’s largest oil and gas producer,
dropped 2.8 percent to C$37.09 after its second-quarter profit
trailed the average estimate in a Bloomberg survey by 7.2
percent, excluding certain items.  Output Forecast  Talisman Energy Inc. (TLM)  retreated 4.1 percent to C$17.99. The
Calgary-based oil and gas producer cut its full-year output
forecast, including Colombian volumes, to 430,000 to 440,000
barrels of oil equivalent a day, citing delays at the Yme, Kitan
and Eagle Ford projects.  OceanaGold Corp. (OGC) , which explores in  New Zealand  and the
 Philippines , sank 17 percent, the most since January 2009, to
C$2.35, after cutting its production forecast and raising its
estimate of cash costs per ounce.  Goldcorp lost 3.6 percent to C$46.50 after cutting its 2011
production estimate to a range of 2.5 million to 2.55 million
ounces, from the previous forecast of between 2.65 million and
2.75 million ounces.  Romarco Minerals Inc. (R)  fell 6.8 percent to C$1.64 after it
was cut to “sector underperformer” from “sector performer”
at CIBC.  Extorre Gold Mines Ltd. (XG)  decreased 3.7 percent to
C$11.94.  Shares Sold  Rubicon Minerals Corp. (RMX) , the developer of a gold mine in
Ontario, surged 29 percent to $3.94 after  Agnico-Eagle Mines
Ltd. (AEM)  agreed to buy 21.7 million of its shares at C$3.23 a share.
Rubicon closed at its lowest price since August 2009 yesterday.  Thomson Reuters Corp. (TRI)  increased 3.7 percent, the most since
September 2009, to C$33.10. The financial news and information
provider said second-quarter profit increased 93 percent,
bolstered by rising revenue from the legal-data and tax and
accounting divisions.  Magna International Inc., Canada’s largest auto-parts
maker, rallied 2.2 percent to C$46.59 after  Auburn Hills ,
Michigan-based peer BorgWarner Inc. said second-quarter profit
almost doubled.  Imax Corp. (IMX)  dropped 16 percent, the most since November
2006, to C$19.43. The maker of widescreen projection technology
reported second-quarter adjusted earnings of 7 cents a share,
missing the average analyst estimate of 19 cents a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
