The rand snapped the longest streak
of gains in 15 months after  South Africa ’s jobless rate, the
highest of 61 countries tracked by Bloomberg, increased in the
second quarter, missing analysts’ expectation for it to drop.  The currency of  Africa ’s largest economy weakened for the
first time in eight days, erasing an earlier advance of as much
as 0.7 percent and weakening 0.5 percent to 6.7002 per dollar as
of 5:28 p.m. in Johannesburg. The rand fell for the first day in
three against the euro, sliding 0.1 percent to 9.5914.  The unemployment rate rose to 25.7 percent from 25 percent
in the first quarter, Statistics South Africa said in a report
released in  Pretoria  today. The median estimate of five
economists was for the rate to drop to 24.9 percent. The number
of people without work surged 174,000 to 4.5 million.  “The gross domestic product implications of today’s data
are likely rand-negative,” Nomvuyo Guma, a Johannesburg-based
analyst at Standard Bank Group Ltd., wrote in a note to clients
today. “The fact that the  unemployment rate  continues to rise
despite government declaring  job creation  a top priority is
likely to be of concern to policy makers.”  Manufacturing, which makes up 15 percent of the economy,
grew 0.6 percent in May from the year earlier, the statistics
office said on July 12, while retail sales were unchanged in the
same period. The weak economy may undermine the government’s
goal of creating 5 million new jobs by 2020 in order to reduce
the unemployment rate to 15 percent.  U.S. Debt Concern  There is still “nervousness in the market” that will
weaken the rand, Standard Bank analysts wrote, as investors see
if a U.S. debt impasses if overcome before a potential default
on Aug. 2. The  House of Representatives  plans to vote today on a
debt-limit increase proposal that confronts unified Democratic
opposition in the Senate, setting the stage for a congressional
showdown to avert a U.S. default.  South African stocks fell for a third day, as the FTSE/JSE
Africa All Share Index declined to the lowest since June 28,
dropping 0.5 percent, to 31,446.39 by the 5 p.m. close in
Johannesburg.  South Africa’s producer-price inflation rate increased at
the highest rate in 10 months, a government report showed today.
Factory-gate prices climbed 7.4 percent in June from a year
earlier, after gaining 6.9 percent in May, Pretoria-based
Statistics South Africa said on its website. The median estimate
of 16 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 6.9 percent. Prices
rose 4.4 percent in the month.  The government’s 13.5 percent notes due 2015 snapped two
days of gains, falling 3 cents to 121.374 rand, pushing up the
yield by less than one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
7.371 percent. The 6.75 percent securities due 2021 weakened 3
cents to 89.781 rand, driving the yield up less than one basis
point to 8.306 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
