Hindustan Unilever Ltd. (HUVR) , the Indian
unit of Unilever Plc, reported first-quarter profit rose 18
percent, exceeding analysts’ estimates, as sales surged to a
record helped by demand for the company’s soaps and detergents.  Net income increased to 6.27 billion rupees ($142 million)
for the three months ended June 30 from 5.33 billion rupees a
year earlier, Hindustan Unilever said in a statement today. That
exceeds the 5.9 billion rupee average of 18 analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Sales climbed 15 percent to 55 billion
rupees.  The maker of Dove shampoo and Surf detergent benefited as
rising incomes in the world’s second-most populous nation
spurred people to spend on personal-care products and pre-
packaged food. Sales of its soaps and detergents grew 13
percent, while food and beverage sales increased by 14.9
percent, the company said in the statement.  Hindustan Unilever fell 1 percent to 322.85 rupees in
Mumbai trading.  India ’s benchmark sensitive index declined 1.2
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
