The following companies had unusual
price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 4 p.m. New York time.  The IGBC Index rose 0.9 percent to 14,069.38 while the
Colcap Index rose 1.1 percent to 1,671.32.  Bancolombia SA (BCOLO)  , Colombia’s biggest bank, rose
1.7 percent to 28,800 pesos. The company sold 800 billion pesos
($451 million) of bonds in an offering, as investor demand
totaled 2 trillion pesos, the stock exchange said yesterday.  Cia. Colombiana de Inversiones SA (COLINV CB) rose 3.9
percent to 4,810 pesos. The electricity holding company known as
Colinversiones said first-half unconsolidated revenue rose 125
percent from a year ago to 175 billion pesos. First-half net
income was 134.6 billion pesos, according to a regulatory filing
yesterday.  Grupo de Inversiones Suramericana SA (GRUPOSUR)   rose 1.5
percent to 35,920 pesos. The parent company of Colombia’s
biggest bank said yesterday it is seeking to offer shares worth
about $1.4 billion in  Colombia  and $700 million overseas in
October, and has an additional $500 million available to help
pay for the $3.9 billion purchase of Groep ING NV’s Latin
American assets.  The details on how it will pay for the acquisition helped
“calm” investors after shares fell yesterday when Standard &
Poor’s Ratings Services said it may cut the company’s ratings to
junk because of the planned ING purchase, said Wilson Tovar, an
analyst at Acciones y Valores SA.  Fitch confirmed its ratings for Suramericana’s bonds and
commercial paper today, according to a regulatory filing. The
move further relaxed investors, Tovar said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
