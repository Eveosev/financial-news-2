Civic Platform ,  Poland ’s ruling
party, saw its support slip to 47 percent in a July 21-25 poll
of 1,000 Poles by Warsaw-based market researcher GfK Polonia,
 Rzeczpospolita  reported.  The party’s backing dropped by 3 percentage points from the
previous GfK Polonia poll on June 7-10, while support for Law &
Justice, the biggest opposition party, increased 3 percentage
points to 30 percent, according to the newspaper. The Democratic
 Left Alliance , also in the opposition, attracted 11 percent of
voters, while the Polish Peasants Party, the junior coalition
partner in government, had 5 percent, the newspaper said.  The GfK poll registered answers from respondents who
declared they would vote in the autumn general elections and
gave a party preference. Undecided voters weren’t included in
the survey, Rp.pl reported. The newspaper didn’t give the poll’s
margin of error.  To contact the reporter on this story:
