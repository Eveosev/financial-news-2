Gold futures fell for the second
straight day on investor sales after the metal surged to a
record. Silver dropped the most in two weeks.  The 14-day relative-strength index for gold rose above 70
in the previous three days, a signal that prices are poised to
fall. The metal reached a record $1,631.20 an ounce yesterday as
the cost of insuring  U.S. debt  rose to a 17-month high. Before
today, the commodity gained 7.6 percent this month as debt woes
in the U.S. and  Europe  escalated.  “Gold has moved $150 this month, so there are going to be
some investors who are going to take profit,”  Frank Lesh , a
trader at FuturePath Trading LLC in  Chicago , said in a telephone
interview.  Gold futures for December delivery fell $1.10, or 0.1
percent, to settle at $1,616.20 at 1:44 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. The price has gained 14 percent this year, heading for the
11th straight annual increase.  The U.S. House of Representatives is expected to vote to
approve a debt-limit plan that the Senate has signaled it will
reject. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  has said the
government’s authority to borrow will run out on Aug. 2 unless
Congress raises the debt ceiling.  “Gold’s job now is to hang in there until we get an idea
of what the big money wants to do on the debt resolution,” Lesh
of FuturePath said. “I can’t make an argument for being short
gold from here.”  Gold may drop $30 to $60 if a debt agreement is reached, TD
Securities said in a report.  “In the absence of a comprehensive deal, we do not see a
sharp and prolonged sell-off,” the analysts said.  Silver futures for September delivery fell 77.4 cents, or
1.9 percent, to $39.794 an ounce on the Comex, the biggest drop
since July 11.  Platinum futures for October delivery declined $15.60, or
0.9 percent, to $1,792.40 an ounce on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange. Palladium futures for September delivery fell $5.10,
or 0.6 percent, to $828.10 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
