The Pittsburgh Pirates’ protest
following their 19-inning loss to the  Atlanta Braves  resulted in
Major League Baseball officials acknowledging an umpire’s
mistake.  The July 26 game ended when home plate umpire Jerry Meals
failed to call an out when Pittsburgh catcher Michael McKenry
tagged Julio Lugo at home. Atlanta won the game 4-3.  “Unfortunately, it appears the call was missed, as Jerry
Meals acknowledged after the game,”  Joe Torre , baseball’s
executive vice president for baseball operations, said yesterday
in a statement. “Many swipe tags are not applied to the runner
with solid contact, but the tag was applied and the game should
have remained tied.”  The Pirates (53-49) are third in the six-team National
League Central Division.  “While we cannot begin to understand how umpire Jerry
Meals did not see the tag made by Michael McKenry three feet in
front of home plate, we do not question the integrity of Mr.
Meals,” Pirates President Frank Coonelly said on the team’s
website. “Instead, we know that Mr. Meals’ intention was to get
the call right. He got this one wrong.”  The teams played again last night at Turner Field in
Atlanta. The Braves needed only 10 innings to win 2-1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
