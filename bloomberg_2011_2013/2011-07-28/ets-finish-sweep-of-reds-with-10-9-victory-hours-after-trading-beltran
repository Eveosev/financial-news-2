Lucas Duda and  Jason Bay  each drove
in three runs as the New York Mets completed a four-game sweep
of the Cincinnati Reds, winning 10-9 just hours after finishing
a deal that sent All-Star Carlos Beltran to the San Francisco
Giants.  Duda, Beltranâ€™s replacement in right field, had two hits
and Bay three for the Mets, who won for the seventh time in 10
games and moved to 54-51 for the season.  David Wright  and Angel Pagan also had three hits for New
York at Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati.  The Mets today dealt Beltran and cash to the Giants for
minor-league pitching prospect Zack Wheeler.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
