Boston Scientific Corp. (BSX) , the second-
largest maker of implanted heart devices, said it will eliminate
1,200 to 1,400 jobs to trim costs and raised its full-year
profit forecast. The shares rose the most since March 10, 2009.  The reduction in the workforce will be completed by the end
of 2013 and will include some attrition, the Natick,
Massachusetts-based company said in a statement today. The job
cuts, affecting about 5 percent of the company’s 25,000
employees, are part of a program that will trim annual costs by
as much as $275 million.  Boston Scientific said profit this year will be 64 to 70
cents a share after second-quarter earnings beat analyst
estimates. The company, which has been struggling with weak
demand for its stents and defibrillators, paid down debt in the
quarter and today announced a program to buy back as much as $1
billion of shares.  “The turnaround is exceeding our expectations,” Chief
Executive Officer Ray Elliott said on a conference call. He will
step down at the end of the year, the company said in May.  Boston Scientific rose 57 cents, or 8.5 percent, to $7.28
at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, after
rising to as high as $7.55. The shares had fallen 11 percent in
this year before today. Minneapolis, Minnesota-based  Medtronic
Inc. (MDT) , the largest device manufacturer, gained 26 cents to $36.14
after declining 3.3 percent this year before today.  Sales Little Changed  Second-quarter sales of $1.98 billion were little changed
from a year earlier when revenue from sold businesses and a
foreign-currency benefit were excluded, the company said.  While the market size for drug-coated stents fell both in
the U.S. and internationally, Boston Scientific remains the
biggest seller, Chief Financial Officer Jeff Capello said on the
conference call. The worldwide market was $1.9 billion during
the second quarter, down 1 percent from a year earlier, while
U.S. sales plunged 10 percent to $410 million, he said.  “We now have a significant ability to increase shareholder
returns with a balanced program of targeted M&A and internal
investment as well as stock buybacks,” Capello said.  The share repurchase effort announced today is in addition
to a previous program under which the company still has
authority to buy back about 37 million shares.  Net Income  Second-quarter net income rose to $146 million, or 10 cents
a share, from $98 million, or 6 cents, a year earlier, the
company said. Earnings excluding some one-time items of 12 cents
a share beat the 9-cent average estimate of 22 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg.  “They delivered a very good quarter,” Joanne Wuensch, an
analyst with BMO Capital Markets in  New York , said in a
telephone interview. “They did so in the face of very difficult
end markets.”  Boston Scientific forecast third-quarter net sales of as
much as $1.97 billion. Revenue will be decreased by $40 million
from a year earlier because of the divestiture of the company’s
neurovascular business.  The company previously forecast full-year earnings of 68
cents a share.  Boston Scientific announced yesterday a $150 million
investment in  China  that will be spent on developing local
manufacturing and physician-training facilities. The company
expands to increase its employees in China from 200 to 1,200.
Boston Scientific prepaid the remaining $750 million of its term
loan borrowings, reducing its gross debt to $4.2 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
