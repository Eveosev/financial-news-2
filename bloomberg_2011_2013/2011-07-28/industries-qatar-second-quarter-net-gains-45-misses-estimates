Industries Qatar, the second-biggest
petrochemicals company in the  Middle East , posted a 45 percent
gain in second-quarter profit as commodity prices increased.  Net income rose to 2.06 billion riyals ($570 million) from
1.42 billion riyals a year earlier, based on Bloomberg
calculations using first-half results published on the Qatar
Exchange today. The median estimate of three analysts was for a
profit of 2.13 billion riyals, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Industries Qatar, which has stakes in petrochemical,
fertilizer and steel manufacturers, benefited from increased
prices for some products. Korean ethylene prices rose 33 percent
in the past year, according to PolymerUpdate.com data. Steel
billets increased 27 percent on the London Metal Exchange.  Saudi Basic Industries Corp., the world’s biggest
petrochemicals maker, said July 16 that profit surged 61 percent
because of higher prices for its products.  Industries Qatar said first-half earnings advanced to 4.17
billion riyals from 2.63 billion riyals a year earlier. Revenue
increased to 8.17 billion riyals from 5.56 billion riyals a year
earlier.  The company forecasts lower earnings this year and next as
it opens new plants and depreciation costs almost double to
2.067 billion riyals by 2013, according to an April statement.  Profit will fall to 4.6 billion riyals next year from 4.9
billion expected for 2011, the company said at the time.
Industries Qatar, which posted a 2010 profit of 5.6 billion
riyals, plans to start two fertilizer plants, two steel plants
and a polyethylene facility by 2015.  The Doha-based company is using Qatar’s natural gas
reserves, the world’s third-largest, to ramp up production as
demand grows in  Asia  and the Middle East for food, chemicals and
building materials.  The shares fell 1.2 percent to 138.2 riyals on Qatar
Exchange today before the results were released. The stock has
gained 0.1 percent this year compared with a 4.2 percent drop
for the QE Index of leading Qatari companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
