The  Zimbabwe  Power Co. will hold
public debates about the environmental impact of a planned
increase in output at its Hwange and Kariba power plants,
 Newsday  reported.  The company will increase output at Hwange by 600 megawatts
from its current 920 megawatts, and boost Karibaâ€™s capacity to
1,050 megawatts from 750 megawatts, Harare-based Newsday said on
its website, citing Fullard Gwasira, spokesman for its owner,
state-owned utility Zesa Holdings.  Refurbishment at Hwange, where a new cooling tower was
constructed, began in April, Newsday said. KPMG has been hired
to help finance the expansion, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
