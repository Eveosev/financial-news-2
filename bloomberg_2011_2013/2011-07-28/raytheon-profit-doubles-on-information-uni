Raytheon Co. (RTN) , the world’s largest
missile maker, said second-quarter profit doubled after sales at
its information systems unit recovered from a U.K. program loss
last year. It cut its full-year revenue forecast.  Income from continuing operations rose to $438 million, or
$1.23 a share, compared with profit of $212 million, or 55 cents
a share, a year earlier, the Waltham, Massachusetts-based
company said. The average estimate of 20 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was for profit of $1.16 a share. Sales rose 4.2
percent to $6.22 billion.  Full-year sales will be between $25.5 billion and $25.9
billion, a decline of $400 million or 1.5 percent on the upper
end of the range than an earlier projection made in April, the
company said. The profit forecast remained unchanged in the
range of $5.50 to $5.65 a share. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
expect profit of $4.92 a share on sales of $26 billion.  Revenue at the company’s Intelligence and Information
Systems division rose 59.3 percent to $752 million from $472
million, after a canceled contract to develop computer systems
for the U.K. Border Agency in 2010 reduced the unit’s sales and
profit for the comparable period last year, the company said.  Chief Executive Officer Bill Swanson has stepped up
acquisitions and targeted international sales to boost revenue
as the U.S. defense spending is projected to decline in the next
decade.  Raytheon rose 4 cents to $45.02 at 4:15 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock has declined 2.9
percent this year before today, compared with the Standard &
Poor’s Supercomposite Aerospace & Defense Index which has
increased 4.6 percent in the same period.  Backlog  Raytheon bookings during the quarter were $7.42 billion
including a $1.7 billion order to upgrade the Patriot air and
missile defense system for  Saudi Arabia , the company said. Total
backlog at the end of the quarter declined slightly to $34.5
billion, the company said.  Three of the company’s six units had lower sales in the
quarter compared with the previous year.  Sales at the  Integrated Defense Systems  unit, which makes
electronic systems for the U.S. Navy’s DDG-1000 destroyer, fell
5.9 percent to $1.22 billion and unit profit fell 6.9 percent to
$203 million because of lower U.S. Navy sales, the company said
without identifying the programs.  Missile Unit  Revenue at the  Missile Systems  unit, the company’s largest
by sales, declined 3.5 percent to $1.37 billion and unit profit
fell 6.8 percent to $151 million on lower sales of Standard
Missile-2, the Navy’s primary surface-to-air weapon, the company
said.  The  Network Centric Systems  unit’s sales fell 5.8 percent
to $1.14 billion because of lower sales of U.S. Army sensor
systems, the company said. Unit profit rose 3.6 percent to $170
million.  Space and Airborne Systems  unit revenue increased 12.2
percent to $1.34 billion, driven by intelligence, surveillance
and reconnaissance systems, the company said. Unit profit rose 4
percent to $176 million.  Technical Services sales increased 2 percent to $851 and
profit remained flat at $72 million, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
