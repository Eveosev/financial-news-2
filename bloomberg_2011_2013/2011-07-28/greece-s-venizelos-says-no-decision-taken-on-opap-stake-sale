Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said the government hasn’t made a final decision
regarding the sale of its 34 percent stake in  Opap SA (OPAP) ,  Europe ’s
largest listed gambling company.  “This isn’t a decision we are making now,” Venizelos said
to lawmakers, according to an e-mailed transcript sent from the
 Finance Ministry . “The cabinet and privatization committee, on
the basis of estimates from our international consultants for
the value of Opap, will make the best decision for the public
interest and for the reduction of public debt.”  Opap will get a license for 35,000 new video lottery
terminals, of which it will operate 16,500 with the remainder
outsourced to other operators, Venizelos said.  “We will enhance Opap and after we will see what the best
way to exploit the asset is,” Venizelos said.  The sale of the government’s stake in Opap is part of plans
by  Greece  to raise 50 billion euros ($71.5 billion) through
state asset sales to pay down debt. The sales are required as a
condition in exchange for a new aid package agreed to on July 21
by European leaders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
