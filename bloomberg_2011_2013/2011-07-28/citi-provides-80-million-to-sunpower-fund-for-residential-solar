Citigroup Inc. (C) , the third-biggest
U.S. bank, will contribute $80 million to a $105 million fund
that  SunPower Corp. (SPWRA)  created to finance residential solar
projects in eight states.  SunPower, which is 60 percent-owned by French oil company
 Total SA (FP) , leases rooftop solar systems to homeowners in Arizona,
California, Colorado, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New
York and Pennsylvania, the companies said today in a statement.
Under these leases, SunPower owns the equipment and customers
pay a monthly fee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
