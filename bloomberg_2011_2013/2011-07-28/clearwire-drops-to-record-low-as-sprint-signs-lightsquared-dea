Clearwire Corp. (CLWR) , the provider of
fourth-generation wireless service for  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) , fell
to a record low after Sprint said it signed a network-sharing
deal with LightSquared Inc.  Clearwire fell 62 cents, or 22 percent, to $2.15 at 4 p.m.
New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, its lowest level
since going public in March 2007. The slump was the biggest one-
day drop since 2008 for the Kirkland, Washington-based company’s
stock, which has lost 58 percent this year.  Sprint signed a 15-year deal with billionaire  Philip Falcone ’s LightSquared to share network expansion costs and
equipment in an effort to make both stronger wireless
competitors.  Overland Park , Kansas-based Sprint also posted a
second-quarter loss of $847 million as 101,000 contract
