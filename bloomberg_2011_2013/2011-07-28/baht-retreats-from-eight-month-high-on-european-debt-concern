Thailand ’s baht reversed an earlier
loss and bonds rose as overseas investors added to holdings of
the nation’s assets to benefit from growth in  Southeast Asia ’s
second-largest economy.  Global funds bought more Thai equities than they sold for
nine straight days through yesterday, the longest period of net
purchases since April 28, according to exchange data. Bank of
Thailand Governor Prasarn Trairatvorakul said last week the
central bank had been active in the  currency market  to curb
excessive volatility.  “There’s been quite a big amount of fund inflows into
Thailand recently,” said Satoshi Ushijima, vice president of
the treasury division in Bangkok at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd.
“There is concern about intervention as well, limiting the
baht’s move.”  The currency added 0.1 percent to 29.70 per dollar as of
3:17 p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The baht touched 29.67 on each of the past two days, the
strongest level since Nov. 12. It may rise to around 29.50 in
two weeks, Ushijima said.  Thailand’s economy will likely expand 4.1 percent this year,
compared with growth of 7.8 percent in 2010, the central bank
said last week. The baht appreciated 3.5 percent in July, the
best performance among  Asia ’s 10 most-traded currencies
excluding the yen.  Funds based abroad purchased a net $1.2 billion of Thai
shares this month, stock exchange data showed. Global investors
also bought a net $4.3 billion of Thai government debt in July,
according to the Thai Bond Market Association.  The yield on the 5.25 percent bonds due May 2014 slipped
four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 3.77 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The one-year onshore interest-rate swap, the fixed cost
needed to receive a floating payment, fell 1.5 basis points to
3.665 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
