Most European stocks declined as
companies from  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  to  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  reported
earnings that missed analysts’ estimates and as U.S. lawmakers
moved no closer to a deal to avert a default.  Volkswagen sank 4.2 percent, its largest slide in more than
two months. Credit Suisse, Switzerland’s second-biggest bank,
dropped 1.6 percent. Alcatel-Lucent SA plunged 15 percent on
concern that spending by U.S. mobile phone companies will slow.
 BASF SE (BAS) , the world’s largest chemical maker, retreated 4.2
percent after posting profit that missed estimates.  The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index rose less than 0.1 percent to
267.08 at the 4:30 p.m. close in  London  as three stocks dropped
for every two that gained. The index has fallen 8.3 percent from
this year’s high on Feb. 17 as investors speculated that
Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis will derail the economic recovery
and as concern mounted that U.S. lawmakers will fail to agree on
the federal government’s debt ceiling by next week’s deadline.  “What’s really weighing on the market is the problem of
the U.S. debt ceiling,” said Jerome Forneris, who helps manage
$11 billion at Banque Martin Maurel in Marseille. “We only have
4 1/2 days left. If the U.S. defaults, it’s bad for the whole
world. They have to resolve this problem. Investors are pulling
money out of stocks and buying gold. People are worried about
the uncertainty and are looking for safe havens.”  National benchmark indexes fell in 13 of the western
European markets. France’s CAC 40 Index slid 0.6 percent. The
U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index climbed 0.3 percent, while  Germany ’s  DAX
Index (DAX)  retreated 0.9 percent.  Sovereign Credit Rating  Moody’s Investors Service, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch
Ratings have said they may cut the U.S.’s top-level sovereign
rating if officials fail to resolve the stalemate on the $14.3
trillion borrowing ceiling before the Treasury Department’s
deadline on Aug. 2.  Of the 141 Stoxx 600 companies that have reported quarterly
earnings since July 11, 51 percent have missed analysts’
estimates for profit per share and 40 percent have beaten
predictions.  Volkswagen AG slipped 4.2 percent to 138.05 euros as
Europe’s largest carmaker said rising commodity prices and a
strengthening euro will damp earnings gains this year.
Volkswagen also posted second-quarter earnings before interest
and taxes of 3.17 billion euros ($4.5 billion). That fell short
of the 3.26 billion-euro average estimate of 14 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Credit Suisse dropped 1.6 percent to 28.80 Swiss francs.
The lender said it plans to cut about 2,000 jobs after second-
quarter profit fell 52 percent to 768 million francs ($955
million) on lower earnings from trading. That missed the 1.06
billion-franc average estimate of analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Alcatel-Lucent Tumbles  Alcatel-Lucent plunged 15 percent to 2.86 euros. France’s
largest telecommunications equipment supplier fell amid concern
spending by U.S. mobile operators in the second half will slow.
 Thomas Langer , an analyst at WestLB AG in Dusseldorf, said that
Alcatel Chief Executive Officer Ben Verwaayen’s remarks on the
company’s U.S. prospects during a conference call were “very
vague.”  Chemical makers posted the biggest loss among the 19
industry groups in the Stoxx 600, slipping 2.1 percent, as BASF
and  Kemira Oyj (KRA1V)  retreated.  BASF, Kemira Retreat  BASF sank 4.2 percent to 63.09 euros for its biggest drop

2.24 billion euros.  Kemira Oyj slumped 9.4 percent to 10.82 euros. The Finnish
maker of water-treatment chemicals reported second-quarter net
income of 30.7 million euros, missing the 34.3 million-euro mean
estimate of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Technip SA (TEC) , Europe’s second-largest oilfield-services
provider, gained 2.2 percent to 75.45 euros. The company said
second-quarter net income rose to 132.5 million euros from 106.1
million euros a year earlier. That beat the average analyst
estimate of 108.6 million euros. The company lifted its full-
year estimates.  Construction and industrial stocks decreased, led by
 Lafarge SA (LG) , which dropped 5.1 percent to 37.68 euros. The
world’s biggest cement maker said second-quarter operating
profit declined to 702 million euros from 838 million euros a
year earlier. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had estimated

estimates as fuel costs soared and uprisings in north Africa
clipped demand.  SBM Offshore NV (SBMO)  tumbled 11 percent to 16.97 euros, its
biggest slide in more than 2 1/2 years. The company said it will
report a first-half net loss after booking a $450 million
impairment charge.  Vallourec SA (VK)  plunged 17 percent to 69.99 euros. The French
producer of steel pipes for the oil and gas industry said that
second-quarter profit declined from a year earlier as rising raw
material costs cut the company’s margins.  Finmeccanica, Inchcape  Finmeccanica SpA (FNC) , which produces commercial and military
aircraft, tumbled 17 percent to 5.76 euros for the largest
retreat in the Stoxx 600. The company lowered its 2011 revenue

Finmeccanica had forecast sales this year of 18.3 billion euros
to 19 billion euros.  Inchcape Plc (INCH)  jumped 8.4 percent to 390 pence. The company

according to Bloomberg data.  Thales SA (HO)  surged 6.2 percent to 29.89 euros. The French
