U.K. growers collected 30 percent of
winter barley and 20 percent of their rapeseed as of July 26,
the Home-Grown Cereals Authority said in a report today.  Barley yields are about 10 percent below the five-year
average and rapeseed yields are 10 percent better than average,
the HGCA said. The wheat harvest, which started in a small area
near Kent and is less than 1 percent complete, is expected to
accelerate within two weeks, according to the report. In eastern
 England , heavy rain fell the prior week, the authority said.  “Crops were slow to dry out and as a result the first
combines only started work on Sunday, giving just two to three
harvest days for the period,” the HGCA said. “Further west,
where the preceding week was drier, crops dried out quicker and
farmers were able to start harvesting on Friday, giving up to 5
harvesting days.”  Feed-wheat futures for November delivery gained 2.70
pounds, or 1.7 percent, to 166.20 pounds ($270.90) a metric ton
on NYSE Liffe in London by 11:13 a.m. today. The price has risen
for three straight days, gaining 3.8 percent. Wheat traded on
the Chicago Board of Trade, the world benchmark, rose 3.75
cents, or 0.5 percent, to $7.49 a bushel.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
