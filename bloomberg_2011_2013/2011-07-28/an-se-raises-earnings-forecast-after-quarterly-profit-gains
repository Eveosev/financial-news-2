MAN SE (MAN) , Europe’s third-largest
truckmaker, raised its 2011 earnings outlook after second-
quarter profit increased on growing demand from the region’s
freight transporters and construction companies.  Earnings before interest and taxes rose 58 percent to 437
million euros ($628 million) from 276 million euros a year
earlier, the Munich, Germany-based company said today in a
statement. Profit beat the 397 million-euro average estimate of
nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Revenue gained 17 percent
to 4.2 billion euros.  The truckmaker increased its sales forecast, saying revenue
this year will grow 10 percent to 15 percent. The previous
target was for a rise of 7 percent to 10 percent. First-half
Industrywide truck sales in  Europe  have gained 56 percent,
according to the  European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association .  “The European trucks market keeps recovering and is the
main pillar of growth at MAN,” said  Marc-Rene Tonn , a Hamburg-
based analyst with M.M. Warburg, who recommends buying the
stock. “It’s no surprise that they raised the outlook.”  MAN rose as much as 55 cents, or 0.7 percent, to 84.50
euros and was up 0.5 percent to 84.39 euros as of 9:05 a.m. in
Frankfurt trading. The shares have declined 5.4 percent this
year, valuing it at 12.2 billion euros.  Raised Forecast  MAN forecast an operating margin “slightly exceeding” 8.5
percent, compared with an earlier goal of more than 8.1 percent.
MAN, which also makes  diesel engines  for ships and power
generation, reported an 88 percent jump in second-quarter net
income to 287 million euros. Orders climbed 18 percent to 4.41
billion euros.  MAN is exploring a merger with  Scania AB (SCVB)  to create Europe’s
biggest truckmaker, leapfrogging Volvo AB and Daimler AG.
 Volkswagen AG (VOW) , which aims to control MAN and Scania following
regulatory approval, is pushing the two to work more closely to
cut development and purchasing costs.  MAN and Scania together had 30 percent of the European
heavy-truck market last year, compared with 21 percent each for
Daimler and Volvo, according to the Brussels-based ACEA industry
group. VW, which already controls Scania, is waiting for
regulatory approval to raise its MAN voting rights to 55.9
percent after completing a takeover bid this month.  Daimler, the world’s largest maker of commercial vehicles,
reported second-quarter operating profit at the trucks unit
gained 58 percent to 474 million euros, while  Volvo AB (VOLVB)  said Ebit
more than doubled to 5.11 billion kronor ($820 million). Scania
reported lower-than-expected profit, citing slowing orders in
 Brazil , the company’s biggest market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
