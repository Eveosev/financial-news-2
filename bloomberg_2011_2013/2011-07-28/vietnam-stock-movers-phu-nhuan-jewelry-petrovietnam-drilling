Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in Vietnam trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of the 11 a.m. local-time close.  The VN Index, the benchmark measure of the Ho Chi Minh City
Stock Exchange, decreased 0.3 percent to 408.39, the lowest
since May 26.  Phu Nhuan Jewelry Joint-Stock Co. (PNJ VN), the only
jewelry manufacturer on the bourse, dropped for a third day,
losing 1.1 percent to 27,000 dong. The company’s unconsolidated
profit slid 15 percent to 52.4 billion dong ($2.55 million) in
the second quarter, according to an exchange filing.  PetroVietnam Drilling & Well Services Joint-Stock Co. (PVD
VN), slipped 1 percent to 39,900 dong. Oil declined for a second
day in  New York  as investors bet that rising crude supplies and
signs of a slowing economy in the U.S. indicate fuel demand may
falter in the world’s biggest consumer.  Southern Rubber Industry Joint-Stock Co. (CSM VN) fell 2.3
percent to 12,800 dong, a record low. Rubber declined from a
two-month high as strengthening yen and declining crude prices
reduced the appeal of the commodity used in tires and gloves.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
