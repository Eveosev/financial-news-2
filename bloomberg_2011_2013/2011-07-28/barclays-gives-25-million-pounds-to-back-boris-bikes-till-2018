Barclays Plc (BARC)  will provide an extra
25 million pounds ($41 million) to extend its sponsorship of
London Mayor  Boris Johnson ’s cycle-hire initiative, doubling its
investment in the program, the mayor’s office said today in an
e-mailed statement.  The “Boris Bikes” will bear the bank’s branding until
2018, as the program is expanded into west and southwest London
and 2,000 more of the distinctive silver and blue cycles are
made available, the statement said. Barclays provided the
initial 25 million pounds to start the system.  Johnson called the project, which started a year ago, a
“glorious new form of public transport.” Londoners have made
more than six million journeys using the cycles since last July.  The program, currently confined to central  London , will
expand into the boroughs of Wandsworth, Hammersmith & Fulham,
Lambeth and Kensington & Chelsea by the summer of 2013,
according to the statement.  New docking stations will serve the Westfield Shopping
Centre in West London.  Last year Johnson said the program would be extended to
areas of east London, including Tower Hamlets, North Shoreditch,
Bethnal Green, Bow,  Canary Wharf , Mile End and Poplar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
