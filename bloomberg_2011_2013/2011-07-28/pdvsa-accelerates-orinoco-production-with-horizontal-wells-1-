Petroleos de  Venezuela  SA is
accelerating efforts to bolster production in the heavy crude
fields of the Orinoco Belt by drilling hundreds of small
horizontal wells, company President  Rafael Ramirez  said.  PDVSA, as the state-oil company is known, began producing
3,000 barrels a day at an eight-hectare field today in the
Carabobo area, Ramirez said today on  state television  during an
event with workers. The area consists of 24 wells that will
reach 40,000 barrels a day of output within months, he said.  Venezuela, which surpassed  Saudi Arabia  as having the
world’s largest oil reserves of 296.5 billion barrels last year,
according to OPEC, plans 146,000 barrels of new production in
the Orinoco this year. PDVSA plans to invest about $140 billion
through 2015 to boost output to 4 million barrels a day from the
2.9 million barrels the country says it currently produces.  “This is a modern and efficient method of producing oil,”
Ramirez, who is also the oil minister, said. “We have the
largest reserves in the world and now we’re going to exploit
them to make our potential a reality.”  PDVSA formed joint ventures with foreign  oil companies 
including Chevron Corp., Repsol YPF SA, Eni SpA and China
National Petroleum Corp. to develop the heavy  oil fields  in the
Orinoco. Those projects, which require billions of dollars of
infrastructure spending, have yet to begin initial production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
