Spanish and Italian bonds pared
losses amid speculation the  European Central Bank  bought
securities from financially troubled nations.  German bunds also erased their advance, while the euro
strengthened against the dollar. The ECB’s press office didn’t
immediately return a call seeking comment.  “There are rumors around but we haven’t seen any flows,”
said  Matteo Regesta , a senior interest-rate strategist at BNP
Paribas SA in London. “The weakening of bunds and the
tightening of spreads is mostly driven by these rumors.”  The yield on Spanish 10-year debt was unchanged at 5.98
percent at 9:33 a.m. in London. The yield had risen as much as
five basis points earlier. The 10-year Italian bond yield was
two basis points higher at 5.78 percent after earlier rising as
much as eight basis points.  German 10-year bonds erased an advance, leaving the yield
one basis point higher at 2.66 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
