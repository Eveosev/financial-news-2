U.S. stock-index futures advanced
after jobless claims fell more than economists estimated,
decreasing below 400,000 for the first time since April in a
sign that the labor market may be improving.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
September climbed 0.2 percent to 1,301.2 at 8:33 a.m. in  New
York  after declining earlier following lower-than-estimated
earnings from Exxon Mobil Corp. Dow Jones Industrial Average
futures increased 13 points, or 0.1 percent, to 12,257.  Jobless claims fell by 24,000 to 398,000 in the week ended
July 23, Labor Department figures showed today in  Washington .
The median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg News survey
called for a drop to 415,000. There were no special factors
associated with the decrease other than the usual volatility
that occurs each year in July, a Labor Department spokesman
said.  The  S&P 500  has retreated 3 percent over the past three
days amid concern lawmakers will fail to agree on an increase in
the U.S. debt ceiling.  Lawmakers are continuing to wrangle over raising the
borrowing limit with less than a week before an Aug. 2 deadline.
The  House of Representatives  is set to vote today on Republican 
John Boehner’s plan. The proposal faces unified opposition from
Democrats in the Senate, who have a majority in the upper
chamber.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
