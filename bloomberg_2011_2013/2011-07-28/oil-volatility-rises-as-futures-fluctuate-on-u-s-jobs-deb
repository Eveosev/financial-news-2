Oil options volatility increased as
futures fluctuated in  New York  after U.S. jobless claims dropped
to the lowest level since April and as congressional leaders
wrangled over proposals to avoid a default on the national debt.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
September, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 30.1 percent at 3 p.m. in New York,
up from 28.9 percent yesterday.  Oil for September delivery edged up 4 cents to $97.44 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Futures increased as
much as 0.6 percent and declined as much as 0.9 percent in
intraday trading and switched directions more than 15 times.
Prices have climbed 27 percent in the past year.  The most active contracts in electronic trading today were
September $90 puts, with 1,664 lots changing hands. They gained
5 cents to 69 cents a barrel. September $85 puts, the next-most
active option, rose 3 cents to 26 cents a barrel with 1,615 lots
