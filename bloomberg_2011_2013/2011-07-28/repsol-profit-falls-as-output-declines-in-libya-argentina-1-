Repsol YPF SA (REP) , Spain’s biggest oil
company, said second-quarter earnings fell 7.3 percent after
refining margins narrowed and output declined because of the
civil war in  Libya  and strikes in Argentina.  Profit adjusted to exclude inventories and one-time items
fell to 485 million euros ($694 million) from 523 million euros
a year earlier, the Madrid-based company reported today in a
statement. The result beat the 418 million-euro mean estimate in
a Bloomberg survey of analysts.  “The main factors explaining the decline in earnings from
the year-earlier quarter were the output decline in Argentina
due to social conflicts, and the suspension of production in
Libya,” the company said in the statement.  Repsol is investing in exploration in  Brazil ’s offshore
 Santos Basin  and elsewhere to raise output and reduce dependence
on mature  Argentine  fields. Repsol this year suspended its
exploration and production operations in Libya after the
uprising in  Africa ’s third-biggest oil-producing country.  Short-term, Libya is still “uncertain,” Chief Financial
Officer Miguel Martinez said on a conference call today. The
company’s facilities in the country are undamaged, he said.  Repsol rose 1.9 percent to close at 22.085 euros in Madrid
trading, bringing the gain this year to 5.9 percent.  Refining Margins  The company is investing to improve refining margins, while
new units at refineries in Bilbao and Cartagena begin operating
at the end of 2011. The refining margin indicator for  Spain , a
measurement of the profit from turning crude into fuel, fell to
$2.10 a barrel in the quarter from $3.30 a year earlier. Brent
oil prices were 50 percent higher in the quarter, Repsol said.  Oil and gas production at the upstream division, which
doesn’t include the Argentine YPF unit, declined 13 percent from
a year earlier to 296,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day.  Output from Buenos Aires-based YPF dropped 20 percent to
446,000 barrels a day, hurt by labor strikes. While Repsol has
been selling part of its stake, it aims to keep at least 51
percent. In 2008, Repsol delayed a public offering for YPF.  Argentina ’s billionaire Eskenazi family this year said it
was paying $1.3 billion to boost its stake in YPF to about 25
percent. The $1.3 billion price was set when the family’s
closely held Petersen Group bought about 15 percent of YPF in
2008. Repsol now holds 57.4 percent of YPF. The company isn’t
studying more sales of shares in the short term, Martinez said.  Investing Upstream  The Spanish company will consider investing in other
upstream assets after reducing its holding in the Argentine
unit, Chief Operating Officer Miguel Martinez said in May.  Repsol forecasts annual production growth of as much as 4
percent through 2014 as projects in  Brazil  and  Peru  start up. It
plans to invest 28 billion euros from 2010 to 2014, developing
fields in Venezuela, Bolivia and  Algeria .  The company will invest about 6 billion euros this year and
its drilling plan for 2011 includes 25 to 30 exploration and
evaluation wells, Repsol said in a Feb. 24 presentation. A
platform in Cuba should be drilling in November, Martinez said.  The producer’s reserve replacement ratio rose to 131
percent last year from 94 percent in 2009. Repsol has forecast a
ratio of more than 110 percent in the next five years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
