The  International Monetary Fund  has
been warned by emerging-market countries against putting large
sums into a new Greek rescue, the Financial Times reported.  Paulo Nogueira Batista, Brazil’s executive director at the
International Monetary Fund, who also represents eight other
countries, said the Greek austerity program is too stringent,
while the restructuring of Greek debt held by European banks is
too small, the newspaper said.  Arvind Virmani,  India ’s executive director at the IMF, said
the proposal leaves Greece with a large sovereign debt stock
that threatens future defaults, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
