The price of goods leaving South
African factories and mines rose at a faster pace in June than
the previous month, reflecting the increased cost of food, fuel
and electricity.  Producer prices increased 7.4 percent from the year earlier
after gaining 6.9 percent in May, Pretoria-based Statistics
 South Africa  said on its website today. The median estimate of
16 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 6.9 percent. Prices rose
4.4 percent in the month.  Higher factory-gate prices may feed through to consumer
inflation, placing pressure on the central bank to raise
interest rates from a 30-year low. The consumer inflation rate
rose to a 15-month high of 5 percent last month from 4.6 percent
in May. The central bank’s inflation target range is 3 percent
to 6 percent.  The central bank “will face a difficult dilemma over the
coming months: how to react to rising inflation in an
environment where growth is both weak and fragile,”  Carmen Altenkirch , an economist at Nedbank Group Ltd. in Johannesburg,
said in e-mailed comments. “We still believe that hiking rates
too soon would do more harm than good.”  The rand fell to 6.6867 per dollar at 12:29 p.m. in
Johannesburg from 6.650 before the release of the data and
6.6703 late yesterday. The 13.5 percent bond due September 2015
strengthened less than 0.1 percent to 121.45 rand, reducing the
yield by one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.352
percent.  Volatility  “Year-on-year producer price inflation has displayed some
volatility in recent months, partly a result of commodity price
fluctuations,” central bank Governor Gill Marcus said on July
21, when the bank left the benchmark  interest rate  unchanged at
5.5 percent. “Food and oil price developments remain the major
risks to the inflation outlook.”  The price of electricity leaped 27.6 percent from a year
ago, while an index of food-manufacturing prices gained 5.9
percent, the statistics agency said. An index of mining and
quarrying prices advanced 7.1 percent.  “Commodity prices have corrected slightly off earlier
highs, which should help to contain producer inflation in the
months ahead,” Altenkirch said. “However, base effects and the
return of some pricing power to producers should push prices at
the manufacturing level up modestly over the months ahead.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
