Mol Nyrt. dropped for a third day to
a seven-month low after the government said it will consider
selling part of its stake in the country’s biggest refiner to
keep budget revenue on target in 2012.  The stock fell 1.8 percent to 19,750 forint at 5:07 p.m.
close in Budapest, its lowest since Dec. 21, valuing the company
at 2.06 trillion forint ($11 billion). Nearly 112,000 shares
changed hands, or 78 percent of the three-month daily average.  Hungary  owns 23.8 percent of the country’s largest oil
refiner, the company said in a filing to the Budapest Stock
Exchange on July 8. The state acquired OAO Surgutneftegas’ 21.2
percent stake in Mol and got an additional 2.6 percent as a
result of taking over private pension funds.  Mol was the second-worst performer in Hungary’s benchmark
BUX index of 13 companies, which retreated 0.5 percent today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
