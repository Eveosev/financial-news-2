Corn and soybean prices may rise on
production concerns in the U.S., said Morgan Stanley Research
analyst  Hussein Allidina  in a report today.  Corn may reach $7.25 a bushel in the 2011-12 marketing year
and soybeans might surge to $14.50 a bushel on the Chicago Board
of Trade, according to the report. Wheat may rise to $8.25 a
bushel, Allidina said. Heat and dryness have followed a wet
spring that delayed sowing, curbing prospects for corn and
soybeans, he said.  “We are growing incrementally more concerned over the
state of the U.S. corn and soybean crops,” Allidina said.
“After a wet spring delayed planting in the U.S., hot, dry
conditions have now descended, threatening yields.”  Corn futures have gained 11 percent this month and soybeans
are up 6.8 percent, partly on concern that production in the
U.S., the world’s biggest exporter of both commodities, will
decline because of adverse weather. Growers will collect 157.1
bushels an acre of corn this year, according to the report. The
 U.S. Department of Agriculture   forecast yields  at 158.7 bushels.  “We see corn and bean prices continuing to lead higher as
production concerns in the U.S. and abroad keep inventories
tight for at least another year,” Allidina said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
