Time Warner Cable Inc. (TWC) , the second-
largest U.S. cable-television operator, reported profit that
beat analysts’ estimates after luring more Internet subscribers.  Second-quarter net income rose to $420 million, or $1.24 a
share, from $342 million, or 95 cents, a year earlier, the New
York-based company said today in a statement. Excluding one-time
items, earnings per share were $1.19. Analysts predicted $1.16,
the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Time Warner Cable added broadband customers in the quarter,
helping to offset slowing demand for TV subscriptions. The
company bought back 11.5 million shares for $863 million.
Consistently returning capital to shareholders is one of the
reasons Time Warner Cable has gained 39 percent in the past 12
months, said  Craig Moffett , an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &
Co. in New York.  “Time Warner Cable is more of a buyback story than
anything else,” said Moffett, who has a “outperform” rating
on the stock. “People want to know they are generating free
 cash flow  and using it to buy back stock. The general sense is
that everything else will take care of itself.”  Todd Mitchell , an analyst at  Brean Murray Carret & Co .,
estimated the company would spend $500 million on repurchases
during the quarter. The buybacks are part of $4 billion
repurchase plan Time Warner Cable announced in November.  Total sales rose 4.4 percent to $4.9 billion, compared with
the $4.94 billion average analyst estimate.  Time Warner Cable fell 1.1 percent to $77.10 yesterday in
 New York  Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have
gained 17 percent this year.  (Time Warner Cable will have a conference call at 8:30 a.m.
