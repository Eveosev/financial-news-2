The lira weakened for the first time
in three days before the central bank releases its quarterly
inflation report today.  The lira lost 0.2 percent to 1.6939 at 9:04 a.m. in
Istanbul. The lira lost 8.9 percent this year, making it the
worst-performer among more than 20 emerging market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg.  Inflation slowed to 6.2 percent in June, supporting the
central bank’s forecasts that an acceleration to 7.2 percent in
May would prove temporary, according to data from the statistics
office. Central bank governor Erdem Basci will announce the
inflation outlook at 10 a.m. in Ankara.  “A lingering dovish tone, which seems more likely than a
shift to a hawkish bias, could see the lira back in weakening
mode,” the Royal Bank of Canada said in a note to clients.  Basci said on July 22 a free-floating currency helps
economic growth. The comments were “almost a green light” for
further lira weakness, the Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc said
last week.  Policy makers have added 10 percentage points to the amount
banks have to hold in reserves since December to limit consumer
loans and curb the current-account deficit. They have left the
main  interest rate  at 6.25 percent since January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
