Ethanol futures dropped the most in
three weeks in  Chicago  as corn declined on speculation that wet
weather in the Midwest will help yields, leading to lower costs
for the biofuel.  The alternative fuel slumped from a five-year high as corn
declined on forecasts for wet, cooler weather in the region
where most U.S. ethanol plants are located. One bushel of corn
makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol, which is part of U.S.
energy plans to reduce foreign oil imports.  “It just kind of lessens the charge with all the variables
down today,” said  Dan Flynn , a trader at PFGBest in Chicago.
“We’ve got a kind of choppy trade on crude oil.”  Denatured ethanol for August delivery fell 6.9 cents, or
2.2 percent, to settle at $2.999 a gallon on the Chicago Board
of Trade, the biggest drop since July 7. Futures declined from
the highest price since July 13, 2006.  In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago rose 5 cents, or
1.6 percent, to $3.185 a gallon and in  New York  the additive
increased 1 cent, or 0.3 percent, to $3.11.  Corn futures for December delivery fell 5.25 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $6.8625 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.  On a spot basis, an average ethanol mill in  Iowa  is making
8 cents on every gallon of the fuel, while a typical plant in
 Illinois  is pocketing 18 cents, according to Ag TraderTalk, a
Clive, Iowa-based online grains information service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
