Obama administration officials will
brief the public no earlier than after financial markets close
tomorrow on priorities for paying the nation’s bills if the U.S.
debt limit isn’t raised, a Democratic official said.  A Treasury official said in an e-mail earlier today the
department would provide more information on how the government
would operate in the absence of borrowing authority as the Aug.
2 deadline approaches.  The House plans to vote today on a proposal to raise the
limit that confronts unified Democratic opposition in the
Senate, setting the stage for a congressional showdown. Treasury
Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  has repeatedly said the government
will run out of options for paying all of its bills on Aug. 2.  William Daley , the president’s chief of staff, indicated
that the Treasury Department has a contingency plan if a deal
isn’t reached by the deadline. Daley didn’t provide details.  “We will follow what has been the plan that every other
administration, Democrat or Republican, has prepared for if --in
the unlikely situation that that would occur,” Daley said in a
July 26 interview with Bloomberg Television.  When pressed for details, Daley said, “The Treasury
secretary will speak to that at some point as we get closer to
the date and lay out exactly what that process would be.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
