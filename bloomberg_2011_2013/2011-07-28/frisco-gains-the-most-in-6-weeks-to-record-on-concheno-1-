Minera Frisco SAB, the mining
company controlled by billionaire  Carlos Slim , rose the most in
six weeks after boosting this year’s investment plan to $ 1.2
billion  to double the capacity of its Concheno project.  Frisco rose 4.8 percent to 60.04 pesos, the highest ever
for the stock, in Mexico City trading. Shares of Mexico City-
based Frisco have doubled since the company was spun off from
Slim’s holding company, Grupo Carso SAB, on Jan. 6. Frisco’s
pre-spinoff value was 30.14 pesos.  Concheno is a gold and silver project that will process
20,000 metric tons of minerals a day. Originally the company
targeted capacity of 10,000 tons. Concheno is expected to start
producing January 2012.  “We have found very interesting mineral reserves, and
that’s why we expect to double the capacity,” spokesman Jorge Serrano said today on an earnings conference call. Frisco is
ready to issue peso, U.S.-dollar debt in the third quarter to
complete the 2011 capital expenditure budget, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
