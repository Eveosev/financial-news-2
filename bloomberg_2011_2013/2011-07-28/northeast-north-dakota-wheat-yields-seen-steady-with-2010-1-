Yields of hard-red spring wheat in
 North Dakota ’s northeast region may be little changed this year
compared with 2010, based on preliminary field surveys on the
annual Wheat Quality Council tour of farms in the state.  Yields may average 50.6 bushels an acre in the area, based
on random samples collected from nine fields on the third day of
the tour. In 2010, the estimated yield in the northeast region
was 50.2 bushels, council data show.  Samples today included fields between Devils Lake and Grand
Forks, and “it looks like a pretty promising crop,” Erica
Olson, a marketing specialist at the Mandan-based North Dakota
Wheat Commission, said in an interview. “Although it’s all so
far behind, who knows?”  Some crops may be about a month away from harvest, Olson
said. Much of the state had above-normal rainfall this year,
which delayed planting and leaves crops more at risk for frost
before the harvest.  On the first two days of the tour, yields in northwest and
southern North Dakota and northern  South Dakota  were projected
at 40.8 bushels per acre, based on samples from 305 fields. That
was down from last year’s estimated yield of 44.5 bushels.  The tour finishes today in Fargo. North Dakota is the
biggest U.S. wheat-producing state.  To contact the reporter on this story:
