Chile’s  industrial production  rose
less than economists forecast in June, the  National Statistics
Institute  said in a report today.  Output rose 4 percent from a year ago, less than the 7
percent median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 11 economists.
Retail sales rose 12.5 percent from June last year while
production of copper, Chile’s biggest export, fell 8.5 percent
to 426,477 metric tons, the institute said.  Economic growth in Chile will slow in coming quarters after
climbing 9.8 percent in the three months through March,
according to central bank forecasts, which show gross domestic
product expanding 6 percent to 7 percent this year. Chile’s
government has  increased its 2011 growth estimate  to 6.6 percent
from 6.1 percent.  “Internal activity shows signs of growth moderation in
recent months but risks persist in this area,”  Chile ’s central
bank President Jose De Gregorio said today, according to speech
notes published on the bank’s website. “Towards the end of the
year growth should be in line with trend.”  Economic expansion is rebalancing as industrial output
helps drive the post-earthquake expansion more than domestic
demand, Finance Minister Felipe Larrain told reporters in
Santiago on July 5. Chile in February 2010 was struck by an 8.8-
magnitude earthquake that caused an estimated $30 billion of
damage and losses in the $200 billion economy.  “Our productive sectors are recovering and growing in a
sustained way,” the minister said at the time.  The peso rose 0.1 percent to 456.15 per  U.S. dollar  at 9:10
a.m. New York time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
