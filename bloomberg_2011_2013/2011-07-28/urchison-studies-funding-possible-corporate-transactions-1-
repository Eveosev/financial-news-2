Murchison Metals Ltd. (MMX) , an Australian
iron ore exporter, allowed other companies to study its finances
as part of a strategic review to help seek funding for its share
of a A$5.94 billion ($6.6 billion) port and rail project.  A number of options are being studied “including the
potential for transactions at the asset and, or, corporate
level,” Perth-based Murchison said today in a statement to the
Australian stock exchange. “A data room has been established,
and Murchison continues to advance discussions with interested
parties.”  Murchison shares plunged the most in more than six years
July 5 on concern cost increases at the Oakajee project would
hamper the company’s efforts to fund its share. The project also
suffered a blow after foundation partner Sinosteel Midwest
Corp., a unit of Sinosteel Corp., said last month it would halt
work on the A$2 billion Weld Range  iron ore  project due to
ongoing delays in the development of the port and rail lines.  Murchison has appointed Rothschild and O’Sullivan Partners
to help with the strategic process, it said. Posco, the world’s
second-biggest maker of stainless steel, is the largest
shareholder. Iron ore is the key steelmaking ingredient.  To contact the reporter on this story:
