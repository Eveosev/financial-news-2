German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said that he is “confident” the stalemate over the
U.S. debt ceiling can be resolved, the  Passauer Neue Presse 
newspaper reported, citing an interview.  “I remain confident that a sustainable solution will be
found, though perhaps only at the last minute,” the German
newspaper cited Schaeuble as saying. “That won’t solve
America’s problems,” he told the newspaper, adding that a
“debt level that is too high and the economic outlook” are the
main issues the U.S. needs to address.  To contact the reporter on this story:
