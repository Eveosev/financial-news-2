SG-SSB Ltd. (SGSSB) , a Ghanaian lender, fell
the most in 10 days as the lender’s first-half profit didn’t
meet investors’ expectations, according to Databank Financial
Services Ltd.  The unit of Societe Generale SA declined 1 pesewa, or 2
percent, the most since July 18, to 49 pesewas by the 3 p.m.
close in Accra, the capital. The lender’s profit rose 6 percent
to 10.7 million cedis ($7.1 million) in the six months through
June, according to a statement published in the Daily Graphic
newspaper today.  “An average of 20 percent bottom line would be okay,” said
Randy Mensah, a stock trader at Accra-based Databank, in a
telephone interview. “Investors want to get out to more exciting
stocks.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
