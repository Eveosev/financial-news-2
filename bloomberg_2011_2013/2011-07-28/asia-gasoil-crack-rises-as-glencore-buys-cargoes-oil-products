Asia ’s gasoil crack spread widened
as Glencore International AG bought more cargoes in Singapore.
Brightoil Petroleum Holdings Ltd. sold  fuel oil , and Royal Dutch
Shell Plc bought gasoline.  Middle Distillates  Glencore brought its purchases of 0.5 percent-sulfur
gasoil, or diesel, in Singapore this month to at least 26
cargoes totaling 4.3 million barrels, according to a Bloomberg
News survey of traders monitoring transactions on the Platts
window. The world’s largest commodities trader paid 40 cents a
barrel below benchmark quotes to Singapore Petroleum Co. and
minus 50 cents to Shell.  Shell also sold 150,000 barrels of gasoil to Hin Leong
Trading Pte at a 50-cent discount, the survey showed.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian benchmark Dubai crude increased
14 cents to $18.17 a barrel at 3:11 p.m. Singapore time,
according to PVM Oil Associates, a broker. This crack spread, a
measure of refining profit, narrowed in the past three days.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil increased for a sixth day,
climbing 10 cents to $1.85 a barrel, PVM said. This regrade is
in the longest rising streak since February, indicating it is
more profitable to produce  aviation fuel  over diesel.  Fuel Oil  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude narrowed 5 cents to
$7.09 a barrel at 3:30 p.m. Singapore time, according to PVM.
That indicates reduced losses for refiners turning oil into
residual products.  Brightoil brought its sales of 180-centistoke fuel oil in
Singapore this month to at least 34 cargoes totaling 768,000
metric tons, according to the Bloomberg survey. The Hong Kong
trader sold 20,000 tons to Vitol Group at $3 a ton over
benchmark quotes and two cargoes to BP Plc at a $2.50 premium.  Hin Leong purchased 380-centistoke fuel oil for a fourth
day, paying $3.25 a ton over quotes to Kuo Oil Ltd. and plus
$4.50 to Westport Petroleum Inc., the survey showed.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade was unchanged after declining to $9.75 a ton, PVM said. A
narrow viscosity spread shows bunker, or marine fuel, gained
more than higher-quality fuel oil.  Light Distillates  Shell, the largest buyer of 97-RON gasoline this month in
Singapore, purchased 50,000 barrels from Morgan Stanley at
$130.90 a barrel, according to the Bloomberg survey.  Europe ’s
biggest oil company yesterday bought a similar cargo at $131 a
barrel. Trafigura Beheer BV sold 50,000 barrels of 92-RON grade
to Total SA at a premium of 60 cents above prices published by
Platts.  Naphtha for delivery to  Japan  in the first half of October
traded $1 a ton lower than second-half September cargoes, the
survey showed. BP sold 25,000 tons for first-half October to
Total at $1,004 a ton. Shell sold 25,000 tons for second-half
September to Noble Group at $1,005.  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures, or
the crack spread, rose to $115.87 a ton at 5:35 p.m. Singapore
time from $109.91 at the end of Asian trading yesterday,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
