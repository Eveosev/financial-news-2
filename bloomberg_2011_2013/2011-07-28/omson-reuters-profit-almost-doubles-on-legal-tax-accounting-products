Thomson Reuters Corp. (TRI) , the financial
news and information provider, said second-quarter profit almost
doubled, bolstered by rising revenue from the legal-data and tax
and accounting divisions.  Net income advanced 93 percent to $572 million, or 67 cents
a share, from $297 million, or 35 cents, a year earlier, the New
York-based company said today in a statement. Excluding some
items, profit was 51 cents, topping the 49-cent average
projection of 18 analystsâ€™ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Revenue rose 7.2 percent to $3.45 billion. Sales of legal
products advanced 9 percent, while tax and accounting revenue
jumped 10 percent, excluding the impact of currency translation.  Thomson Reuters  rose C$1.15, or 3.6 percent, to C$33.08 at
4:10 p.m.  New York  time in Toronto Stock Exchange trading. The
shares have dropped 11 percent this year.  Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, competes with
