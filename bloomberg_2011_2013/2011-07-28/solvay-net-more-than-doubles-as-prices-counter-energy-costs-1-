Solvay SA (SOLB) , the chemicals and
plastics maker buying  Rhodia SA (RHA) , said second-quarter profit more
than doubled, led by price increases for PVC and soda ash as
growth in demand for specialty polymers slowed.  Net income climbed to 111 million euros ($159 million), or
1.36 euros a share, from 44 million euros, or 60 cents, a year
earlier, the Brussels-based company said today in a statement.
Earnings before interest, tax and special items increased 27
percent to 219 million euros, beating the 203.4 million-euro
average of eight analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales
rose 11 percent to 1.72 billion euros.  Rhodia joined Solvay today in saying that price increases
countered higher raw-material and energy costs and were the
biggest driver of earnings in the quarter as growth in demand
for products including consumer chemicals and engineered
plastics slowed. Solvay agreed in April to buy Rhodia in a
transaction valued at 6.6 billion euros including debt and
pension liabilities and is waiting for European Union antitrust
approval to complete the deal.  “Business climate seems still supportive for the third
quarter,” Bernard Hanssens, an analyst at Bank Degroof SA in
Brussels, wrote in an investor note. “Rhodia also enjoys good
business conditions and solid pricing power.”  Soda-Ash Maker  Solvay advanced 0.2 percent to 108.70 euros by 9:30 a.m.
local time in Brussels trading, valuing the world’s largest
soda-ash maker at 9.2 billion euros. The shares have climbed 36
percent since the start of the year, the best performance among
the 23 companies in the Stoxx 600 Chemicals Index.  Solvay reported its cash and short-term investments, less
financial debt, fell by 163 million euros in the quarter to 2.53
billion euros at the end of June. Rhodia said net debt was
little changed at 1.09 billion euros.  The French specialty chemicals maker reiterated its profit
forecast, saying it will generate at least 1 billion euros of
cash from operations before one-time items and changes in
working capital this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
