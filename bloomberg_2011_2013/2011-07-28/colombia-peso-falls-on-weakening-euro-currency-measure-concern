Colombia ’s peso fell for a second
day as the euro weakened and investors bet the government may
adopt new measures to stem the currency’s gains at a central
bank meeting tomorrow.  The peso fell 0.3 percent to 1,771.50 per  U.S. dollar  at
11:20 a.m. New York time, from 1,766.70 yesterday. The currency
has jumped 8.2 percent since March 1, the best performance among
25 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  “The market may be speculating about whether measures will
be taken,” said Francisco Chaves, analyst at Corredores
Asociados. “Surely the bank will bring up the issue tomorrow,
though there’s not much risk of strong  capital controls .”  The euro’s drop also led declines in the peso, Chaves said.
The euro weakened for a second day against the dollar and the
yen on speculation the region’s sovereign-debt crisis will keep
spreading.  President  Juan Manuel Santos  said July 26 the government
will continue its policy of “interventions” to stem gains in
the currency and counterweigh the effect of record foreign
direct investment.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent bonds due July 2024 rose
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.70 percent,
according to the stock exchange. The security’s price fell 0.166
centavo to 118.440 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
