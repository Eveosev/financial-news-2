Redecard SA (RDCD3) ,  Brazil ’s second-largest
card-payment processor by market value, said profit fell 14
percent in the second quarter, as fees for credit- and debit-
card sales declined and operating costs rose.  Net income fell to 322.6 million reais ($207.4 million)
from 374.6 million reais a year earlier, Redecard said in a
regulatory filing yesterday. The result beat the average
estimate of 291.8 million reais from nine analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Net operating sales rose 2.9 percent to 888.1 million
reais. The value of credit- and debit-card transactions rose 33
percent to 55.7 billion reais, Redecard said.  Fees charged to retailers have fallen after a ruling in
July 2010 ended exclusivity over certain transactions,
increasing competition. Redecard’s net fees declined to 1.2
percent in the quarter, down from 1.4 percent during the period
last year. Operating costs rose 28 percent to 154.8 million
reais as the company added staff, invested in client services
and  information technology  for administrative systems.  “This is the trough in terms of year on year comparison,”
Henrique Caldeira, an analyst at Barclays Capital Plc said in a
telephone interview from  Sao Paulo  on July 21. “Numbers for
Redecard are already improving. We expect an improvement in the
third quarter and a positive result in the fourth quarter.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
