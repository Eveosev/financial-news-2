U.S. Gulf oil premiums surged after
 BP Plc (BP/)  and  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  began shutting oil production
platforms with a combined capacity of at least 300,000 barrels a
day as Tropical Storm Don headed for the Texas coast.  Don, the fourth named storm of the  Atlantic hurricane
season , gained strength today, with winds increasing to 45 miles
(72 kilometers) an hour from 40 mph, according to a National
Hurricane Center bulletin at 10:40 a.m. East Coast time today.  Shell executed a “full shut-in of production” at its
Perdido Spar platform, which has a peak production capacity of
100,000 barrels a day of oil equivalents, according to the
company’s website.  BP shut production at its Atlantis platform, the company
said in a recorded telephone message. The platform can produce
200,000 barrels a day of crude and 180 million cubic feet of
gas, U.S. Interior Secretary  Ken Salazar  said in a briefing last
year.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium added 65 cents to $22.20 a
barrel at noon in  New York , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium increased $1.50 a
barrel to $23.25 a barrel.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend increased 55 cents a barrel to $17.60 while Poseidon added
75 cents to $17.50 a barrel over WTI.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium advanced 75 cents to $15.25
a barrel. West Texas Sour’s discount narrowed by 20 cents to 55
cents below the benchmark. Thunder Horse’s premium added $1.25
to $22.50.  The discount for Western Canada Select was unchanged at
$18.45 a barrel.  The premium for Syncrude increased 25 cents to $13.50 a
barrel. Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived
from the  tar sands  in  Alberta .  To contact the reporter on this story:
