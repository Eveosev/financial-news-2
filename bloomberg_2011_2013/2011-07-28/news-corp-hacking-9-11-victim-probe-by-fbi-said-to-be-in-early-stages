The FBI probe of the  News Corp. (NWSA) 
hacking scandal is in a preliminary stage, a person familiar
with it said, as investigators gauge whether U.S. law will allow
prosecutors to bring charges related to claims it hacked a rival
company and sought access to phone records of victims of the
9/11 attacks.  Investigators are evaluating questions of where a case may
be filed, whether alleged crimes in the U.S. took place too far
in the past to be prosecuted, and who the victims of any alleged
crime may be, said the person, who declined to be identified
because the matter isnâ€™t public.  To contact the reporter on this story:
