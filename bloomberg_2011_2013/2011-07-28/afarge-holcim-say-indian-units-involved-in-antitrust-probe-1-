Lafarge SA (LG)  and  Holcim Ltd. (HOLN) , the
world’s largest cement makers, said their Indian units have been
accused by local regulators of breaking the country’s antitrust
rules.  The  Competition Commission  of  India  told Lafarge last
month the company is among several accused of violations dating
from 2005, the Paris-based cement maker said in a regulatory
filing today. Lafarge “vigorously defends itself against the
allegations,” it said. The decision may come by the end of the
year, it added.  Holcim’s Ambuja Cements and ACC units are being probed by
India’s competition regulators and are “fully collaborating
with the authorities,” Roland Walker, a spokesman for the Jona,
Switzerland-based company, said in an e-mail.  Lafarge and Holcim are among companies facing a European
Union probe into possible price fixing and import limits.
Lafarge last year lost a challenge at the EU’s highest court
against a 249.6 million-euro ($357 million) antitrust fine in
2002 for its role in another cartel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
