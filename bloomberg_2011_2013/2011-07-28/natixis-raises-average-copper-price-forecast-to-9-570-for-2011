raised estimates for copper’s average price to $9,570 a metric
ton for 2011 and $10,600 for next year  “The combination of Chinese restocking and tight Chilean
supply will push copper prices higher,” analysts including Nic Brown in  London  said in a report today. Until now, Natixis
expected copper to average $9,450 a ton this year and $9,700
next year.  Tin will average $29,850 a ton this year, below the prior
estimate of $31,500, Natixis said. It cited “the extent and
persistence of the recent correction exceeding” expectations
and said its “underlying view on tin’s market fundamentals
remains positive.”  Aluminum will average $2,600 a ton this year, compared with
$2,650 previously, Natixis said. It raised estimates for this
year to $25,300 a ton for nickel and $2,400 a ton for zinc.
Nickel will average $26,500 a ton next year, according to
