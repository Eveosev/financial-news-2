The average price of tobacco in
Malawi, the world’s largest producer of the burley variety, is
selling for 39 percent less than the government’s recommended
price, the Daily Times reported.  The leaf is selling for an average $1.10 per kilogram (2.2
pounds) since the auction season started on March 14, the
Blantyre-based newspaper said, citing Bruce Munthali, the chief
executive officer of the Tobacco Control Commission. The country
has generated $104.8 million from tobacco sales this year, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
