Former Tunisian President Zine El
Abidine Ben Ali, whose ouster helped inspire uprisings in the
region, was sentenced in absentia by a court in the north
African nation to 16 years in prison on charges that include the
abuse of power.  The court sentenced Ben Aliâ€™s daughter Nesrine to eight
years in prison and her husband, Sakher el-Materi, to 16 years.
Both were also tried in absentia. The ex-president is currently
in  Saudi Arabia .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
