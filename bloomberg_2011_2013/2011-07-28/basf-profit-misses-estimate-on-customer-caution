BASF SE (BAS) , the world’s biggest
chemical company, reported second-quarter profit that fell short
of analysts’ estimates, held back by a weaker  U.S. dollar  and
shrinking margins.  Earnings before interest, tax and one-time items was 2.24
billion euros ($3.2 billion), little changed from the 2.21
billion euros a year earlier, Ludwigshafen, Germany-based BASF
said today in a statement. Sales gained 14 percent to 18.5
billion euros. Analysts in a Bloomberg survey predicted profit
of 2.4 billion euros on sales of 18.8 billion euros.  BASF reiterated targets for the full year, with higher
prices offsetting raw-material inflation to help boost operating
profit by more than 10 percent. Chief Executive Officer Kurt Bock, now in the job 12 weeks, has said he will continue
shifting the company away from more cyclical commodity chemicals
and closer to the end customer, a strategy exemplified by the
purchase of moisturizer-ingredient maker Cognis last year.  The high oil price “is having a negative impact on margins
across our value chains and is leading to some customers being
more cautious in their orders,” Bock said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
