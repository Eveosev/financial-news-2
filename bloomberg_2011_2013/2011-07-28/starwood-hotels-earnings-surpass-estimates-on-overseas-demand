Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide
Inc. (HOT) , owner of the St. Regis and W brands, reported second-
quarter earnings that beat analysts’ estimates as lodging demand
climbed in U.S. metropolitan areas and overseas.  Excluding one-time items, income from continuing operations
rose to 50 cents a share from 35 cents a year earlier, the  White
Plains , New York-based company said in a statement today. That
exceeded the 46-cent average estimate of 27 analysts in a
Bloomberg survey. Net income rose to $131 million from $114
million.  The hotel industry has been helped by a rebound in business
and leisure travel, particularly outside the U.S. Revenue per
available room, or revpar, is up more than 10 percent from a
year ago in Asia and more than 20 percent across Europe,
compared with an increase of about 7 percent in the U.S.,
according to Patrick Scholes, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets
Corp.  “Starwood is in all the markets that are performing the
best right now, domestically and globally,” Joseph Greff, a New
York-based analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co., said in an interview
before earnings were announced. “In terms of their fee growth,
70 percent is coming from outside the  United States , and that’s
where investors consider the growth opportunities to be the
best.”  Revpar, a measure of occupancy and rates, was up 12 percent
worldwide in the second quarter, Starwood said today. In  North
America , it rose 9.5 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
