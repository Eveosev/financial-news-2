The Environmental Protection Agency,
which is scheduled to propose new pollution limits for U.S. oil
and gas production, should delay adopting a final rule by six
months, an American Petroleum Institute official said.  The EPA, as part of a legal settlement with environmental
groups, faces a deadline today to suggest standards for
hazardous emissions from oil and gas exploration and production.
The agency has said it will issue final regulations by Feb. 28.  The API, the largest U.S. oil and gas lobby, hasn’t yet
seen the EPA’s proposal. The group wants the postponement to
give energy companies more time to weigh in, said Howard
Feldman, director of science and regulatory policy at the
Washington-based trade group.  The oil and gas lobby wants to ensure that the proposed new
regulations don’t “stifle the development of our abundant
natural resources,” Feldman told reporters today on a
conference call.  An EPA update to oil-and-gas emission rules under the  Clean
Air Act  is overdue, according to Jeremy Nichols, director of the
climate and energy program at  Santa Fe , New Mexico-based
WildEarth Guardians, one of the groups that sued the EPA in a
bid to force an update of standards that haven’t been revised
since 1985.  API’s request to delay a new rule “would be seriously
misguided,” Nichols said today in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
