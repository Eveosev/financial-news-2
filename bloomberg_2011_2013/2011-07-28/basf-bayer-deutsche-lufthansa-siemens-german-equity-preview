German stocks slumped for a second
day as earnings from Volkswagen AG,  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  and
 BASF SE (BAS)  missed estimates and U.S. lawmakers moved no closer to
agreeing a compromise to raise the federal debt limit.  Volkswagen AG sank 4.2 percent, its largest drop in almost
three months. Lufthansa declined 2.8 percent as it posted
operating profit that missed analyst estimates. BASF slid 4.2
percent.  Siemens AG (SIE) ,  Europe ’s largest engineering company,
slipped 1.1 percent after saying profit in the fiscal third
quarter almost halved.  The  DAX Index (DAX)  retreated 62.62, or 0.9 percent, to 7,190.06
at the 5:30 p.m. close in Frankfurt. The gauge has retreated 4.5
percent since this year’s high on May 2 amid concern that
Europe’s fiscal crisis will derail the economic recovery and as
speculation mounted that U.S. lawmakers will fail to agree to
increase the nation’s debt ceiling by next week’s deadline. The
broader HDAX Index lost 1 percent today.  “Maybe the global economy is slowing and we are feeling
the impact,” said Louise Cooper, a markets analyst at BGC
Partners in  London . “Investors are finally starting to become
less complacent about the debt-ceiling deadline next week. The
global macro situation is still dominating the thoughts of all
in the markets.”  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  slipped 4.2 percent to 138.05 euros as
Europe’s largest carmaker said rising commodity prices and a
strengthening euro will damp earnings gains this year.
Volkswagen also posted second-quarter earnings before interest
and taxes of 3.17 billion euros ($4.5 billion). That fell short
of the 3.26 billion-euro average estimate of 14 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Deutsche Lufthansa, Siemens  Lufthansa lost 2.8 percent to 14.07 euros. The airline
posted profit that missed analysts’ estimates as fuel costs
soared and uprisings in north Africa clipped demand.  Siemens slid 1.1 percent to 90.13 euros. The engineering
company said profit in its fiscal third quarter fell 47 percent
because of a fine tied to a nuclear-energy joint venture and
charges at its health-care unit.  BASF declined 4.2 percent to 63.09 euros. The chemical
maker reported second-quarter profit that fell short of
analysts’ estimates and said that growth will slow in the second
half.  Bayer AG (BAYN)  dropped 1.2 percent to 56.85 euros as the aspirin
maker reported second-quarter net income of 747 million euros,
missing the 777.7 million average analyst estimate in a
Bloomberg survey.  Siemens, BASF and Bayer are the three largest companies in
 Germany  by index weighting, according to Bloomberg data.  Wacker Neuson SE (WAC)  rallied 1.6 percent to 12.55 euros as the
company raised its earnings forecast for 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
