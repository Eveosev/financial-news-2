Ceske Aerolinie AS, the unprofitable
Czech state carrier, said protests planned by pilots for next
week against layoffs shouldn’t have a big impact on flight
schedule.  “We have taken a number of precautions to minimize the
impact on passengers,” Hana Hejskova, a spokeswoman for Ceske
Aerolinie, said by phone today. The company, which started to
cut staff in 2009, started to hand out first dismissals to
pilots this week, Hejskova said. CSA plans to fire some 50
pilots within several weeks, she said.  CSA pilots may begin protests against the job cuts on Aug.
1, CTK reported yesterday, citing Filip Gaspar, the head of the
Czech Association of Passenger Jets. Pilots will start to
prolong pre-flight procedures, causing delays as of next week,
CTK said.  The Czech government merged CSA with Letiste Praha AS, the
operator of  Prague ’s international airport, in November to cut
the carrier’s costs before a planned sale in 2012. The
restructuring plan includes reducing the size of the fleet,
staff cuts and canceling unprofitable routes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
