Ghana  will sell more five-year bonds
in December following today’s offering of the maturity, its
first since June 2007 to develop infrastructure in West Africa’s
second-biggest economy after  Nigeria .  The  Bank of Ghana  plans to auction 200 million cedis ($133
million) of the debt, it said in an issuance calendar on its
website today. It offered 300 million cedis of the same duration
today.  The bank will also sell 300 million cedis of three-year
bonds in October, its fourth this year of the maturity in 2011,
according to the calendar. The offerings in February and April
were oversubscribed, while in June the Accra-based bank failed
to meet its target.  The three-month borrowing costs of the world’s second-
biggest cocoa producer have retreated to 10.2 percent, the
lowest in at least four years, as inflation slows. The cedi,
which reached the weakest in at least 17 years against the
dollar on Feb. 3, has strengthened 5.1 percent since then.  To contact the reporter on this story:
