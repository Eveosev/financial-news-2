KLA-Tencor Corp. (KLAC) , a maker of
machinery used in the production of computer chips, said orders
have stalled over the past couple of weeks as  semiconductor
companies  pull back on expansion plans.  Orders in the fiscal first quarter, which ends in
September, will fall as much as 45 percent from the fourth
quarter, Chief Executive Officer Rick Wallace said on a
conference call with analysts today. Sales will be $770 million
to $820 million, he said. That compares with an average analyst
estimate of $798.1 million, according to Bloomberg data.  A drop in demand from made-to-order chipmakers, mostly
located in  Taiwan , accounts for the majority of the decline,
Wallace said. Some of the reduction in bookings may have
occurred as chipmakers focus on installing machinery they have
already received and “pause” in buying more, he said.  “Given the severity of the fall-off, it’ll take a while to
get back to the current levels,” Wallace said in an interview.
“You would need to see some improvements in the macro economy
to drive growth beyond an industry correction.”  KLA-Tencor’s orders for the first quarter will decline 35
percent plus or minus 10 percentage points, the company said. On
July 12, Wallace had predicted a decline of 15 percent to 20
percent. Earnings per share will be $1.10 to $1.24, the
Milpitas, California-based company forecast today.  KLA-Tencor shares fell 6 cents to $41.71 at 4 p.m. New York
time on the Nasdaq Stock Market. They have gained 7.9 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
