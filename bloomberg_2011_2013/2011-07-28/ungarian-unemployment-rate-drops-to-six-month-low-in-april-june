Hungary’s jobless rate dropped to a
six-month low in the April to June period,  the statistics office 
in Budapest said today by e-mail.  The  unemployment rate  fell to 10.8 percent, the lowest
since October-December of last year and matching the median
estimate of nine economists in a Bloomberg survey. The jobless
rate was 11.6 percent in the January-March period.  Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  has pledged to create 1 million
jobs in a decade to raise the European Union’s second-lowest
employment rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
