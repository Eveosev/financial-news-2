Canadian stocks fell, completing
their worst weekly decline in a year, as commodity producers and
financial companies slid after  Canada  and the U.S. reported
economic growth figures that trailed economists’ forecasts.  Royal Bank of Canada (RY) , the country’s largest lender, dropped
1.3 percent after Canada reported the biggest monthly decline in
gross domestic product in two years.  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU) ,
Canada’s largest oil and gas producer, slipped 1.3 percent as
crude slumped 1.8 percent to $95.70 a barrel. Barrick Gold Corp.
and  Goldcorp Inc. (G) , the biggest producers of the precious metal,
declined after analysts cut their price estimates.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index decreased 102.15
points, or 0.8 percent, to 12,945.63 at 4:00 p.m. in Toronto,
extending its weekly retreat to 4.1 percent, the most since July
2, 2010.  “The macro scene dominates today,” Marcus Xu, Vancouver-
based director of equity investments at Genus Capital
Management, said in a telephone interview. Genus oversees C$1.7
billion. “For the overall general economy to recover, you need
the price of oil” to fall to the $80-a-barrel range and “stay
low,” he said.  The index fell 3.3 percent over the past four days as U.S.
lawmakers failed to reach a deal to raise the country’s debt
ceiling and that country reported a decline in durable-goods
orders. Seventy-five percent of Canadian exports went to the
U.S. last year, according to  Statistics Canada .  Slower Growth  U.S. gross domestic product rose at a 1.3 percent annual
rate in the second quarter after a 0.4 percent gain in the prior
quarter that was less than earlier estimated, Commerce
Department figures showed today. The median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called for a 1.8 percent
increase.  Canada’s gross domestic product fell 0.3 percent, missing
every economist forecast, as production in the mining and oil
and gas sector declined, government data showed. Output fell 0.3
percent in May to C$1.26 trillion ($1.32 trillion). The median
growth estimate in a Bloomberg survey was 0.1 percent.  A gauge of financial companies in the S&P/TSX fell to the
lowest level since December 2010.  National Bank of Canada , country’s sixth-largest bank,
declined 2.3 percent to C$74.05. Royal Bank of Canada dropped
1.3 percent to C$51.40.  Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) , Canada’s third-
biggest lender by assets, decreased 1.3 percent to C$54.18.  Energy Shares  Crude oil futures fell for their first weekly drop since
June, on concern that the failure to reach a debt deal in the
U.S. threatens the economy of the biggest crude consumer. The
index of energy companies in the S&P/TSX slipped 0.7 percent.  Suncor Energy slipped 1.3 percent to C$36.62.  Capital Power
Corp. (CPX) , an electricity generator, fell 1.9 percent to C$24.45,
the lowest price since Feb. 8.  Trilogy Energy Corp. (TET) , a western
Canadian oil and gas producer, dropped 2.4 percent to C$27.20.  Goldcorp, fell 1.7 percent to C$45.69 as its price estimate
was cut by HSBC Securities USA Inc.,  Scotia Capital  Inc., UBS AG
and Cormark Securities Inc. following a reduction in its
production forecast. It dropped 11 percent this week, its
biggest loss since January 2009. Gold gained 0.7 percent after
dropping for two days.  “Investors continue to flock to the safety of the gold
bullion in a risk-off play, and not to the gold stocks because
of their equity market exposure,” said Kenneth Mack, an analyst
and trader at Stone Asset Management in Toronto in an e-mail.
Stone Asset Management oversees about C$850 million.  Barrick slid 0.7 percent to C$45.55, after the 12-month
price estimate on its U.S. shares was trimmed to $60 from $64 at
UBS AG, which cited an increase in capital spending estimates.
The shares were cut to “market perform” from “buy” by an
analyst at Cormark.  Energy-Sensitive  “The mining sector is getting bigger and bigger in Canada
and it is getting to be more important,” Genus’s Xu said.
“High energy prices will impact them as well.”  Dundee Precious Metals Inc. (DPM) , a gold producer with mines in
Bulgaria and  Armenia , lost 3.2 percent to C$8.29.  Silver Wheaton
Corp. (SLW) , Canada’s fourth-largest precious-metals company by market
value, fell 2.4 percent to C$34.41.  Gildan Activewear Inc. (GIL) , the country’s biggest clothing
maker, tumbled 7.3 percent to C$28.64, the most in the S&P/TSX.
Susan Anderson, an analyst at Citigroup Inc., cut the stock to
“sell” from “hold,” saying the company will have to cut
prices to drive sales.  Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc. dropped 1.9 percent
to C$55.16. The world’s largest fertilizer producer by market
value was cut to “sector perform” from “sector outperform”
by Scotia Capital, even after its second-quarter earnings beat
the average analyst estimate by 14 percent. Potash’s earnings
have risen to levels that are unsustainable beyond 2015-2016,
Scotia analysts led by Ben Isaacson wrote in a report.  Imax Corp., which makes widescreen projection technology,
tumbled 6.4 percent to C$18.19. The shares fell 33 percent this
week, the most since August 2006. The company said
“disappointing film performance” contributed to a drop in
second quarter profit.  To contact the reporters on this story:
