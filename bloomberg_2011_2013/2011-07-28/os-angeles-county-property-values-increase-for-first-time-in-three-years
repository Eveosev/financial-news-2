Los Angeles  County tax rolls climbed
for the first time in three years as home sales and new
construction boosted valuations, Assessor John Noguez said.  Assessments in the nation’s most populous county rose by
$16.2 billion, or 1.49 percent, to $1.1 trillion, Noguez said in
a report today. Valuations based on changes of ownership
accounted for a $12.8 billion increase, while construction
contributed $3.9 billion. The gains were offset by reduced
assessments on some properties including businesses, he said.  “We’re still not back up to the high of the market, but at
least we see a spark,” Noguez said in a telephone interview.
“Overall there’s a little more confidence. People are having
bidding wars.”  Tax rolls in the county, home to almost 10 million
residents, topped $1 trillion for the first time in 2007 before
declining in 2009 and 2010.  The median home or condominium in Los Angeles County sold
for $318,000 in June, a 5.1 percent decline from the same period
the year before, according to DataQuick, a San Diego-based real
estate researcher.  To contact the reporters on this story: Christopher Palmeri in
