treasury department, said at a press conference in  Tokyo .

billion yen in the 12 months ended March 31.  The company, also Japan’s top producer of seamless steel
pipes, plans to produce 1 million metric tons of the pipes this
fiscal year, up from 960,000 tons a year earlier as global
demand for energy, including natural gas, increases, Masato
Hoshi, the head of the company’s investor relations division,
said at the conference.  Pipe Demand  Demand for the pipes will enable the company to charge
customers more than increases in material costs for the fiscal
first half, he said.  Sumitomo Metal’s first-quarter operating profit, or sales
minus the cost of goods sold and administrative expenses, rose
18 percent to 16.8 billion yen, as cost reductions helped
counter the rising price of  iron ore  and coking coal and lower

ton this quarter, 15 percent higher than a year earlier, while
the price of coking coal increased 40 percent to $315 a metric
ton, according to Kobe Steel.  To contact the reporters on this story:
