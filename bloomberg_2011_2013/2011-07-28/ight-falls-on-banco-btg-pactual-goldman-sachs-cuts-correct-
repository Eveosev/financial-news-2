Light SA (LIGT3) , Brazil’s second-biggest
electricity distributor, fell the most in more than two months
after having its recommendations cut at Banco BTG Pactual SA and
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  Shares dropped 2.5 percent to 28.19 reais at the close of
 Sao Paulo  trading at 4:15 p.m. New York time, the most since May
17. It was the second-worst performer on the Bovespa index. The
benchmark equity gauge rose 0.7 percent to 58,708.25.  Light was cut to “neutral” from “buy” at Goldman Sachs
after it gained 14 percent this year through yesterday.  “From current levels we see less scope for the stock to
outperform,” Goldman Sachs’s analysts Francisco Navarrette and
Andre Gaeta wrote in a note to clients today.  The company, a unit of Cia. Energetica de  Minas Gerais , was
lowered to “neutral” from “buy” at BTG Pactual. Light’s
higher leverage after the acquisition of Renova Energia SA may
limit dividend distribution for the next two years, analysts
including Antonio Junqueira wrote in a research note.  Light may issue 350 million reais ($224 million) of bonds
in the domestic market to finance the purchase of Renova
Energia, Chief Financial Officer Luiz Fernando Rolla said in an
interview July 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
