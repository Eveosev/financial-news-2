Natural rubber output in key growing
countries will expand at a slower pace in the third quarter as a
“severe” leaf disease delays tapping in  Vietnam , according
to the  Association of Natural Rubber Producing Countries .  Production from member countries, representing 92 percent
of global supply, may increase 3.4 percent to 2.77 million
metric tons during the July-to-September period compared with
12.1 percent a year earlier, the group said in an e-mailed
report today. Supply growth in the first and second quarter this
year was 10.5 percent and 3.3 percent respectively, it said.  “Slow growth in supply and high oil price could help
natural rubber market to continue staying strong,” the Kuala
Lumpur-based group said in a monthly report. Supply ’deficit’
will probably continue through 2018 as gains in production
may be marginal, it said.  Limited supply may help extend a 46 percent rally in rubber
futures in  Tokyo  in the past year and increase costs for
Bridgestone Corp., Michelin & Cie. and Goodyear Tire & Rubber
Co., the top three tire makers. Global natural rubber stocks-to-
use ratio has plunged to the lowest level ever as expanding
demand shrinks inventories in China, RCMA Commodities Asia Pte.
Chief Executive Officer Chris Pardey said on July 26.  A supply deficit in natural rubber may be between 200,000
tons and 300,000 tons this year and may widen to 1 million tons
by 2020, the International Rubber Study Group said June 8.
Global usage was about 10 million tons in 2010, according
to Oxford, England-based LMC International Ltd.  Thailand  Flood  Rubber for January delivery  declined 1.1 percent to 391.5
yen a kilogram ($5,032 a ton) on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange
today. Futures reached a record 535.7 yen on Feb. 18 as global
demand led by  China  outstripped supply and after rain and
flooding curbed output in Thailand and  Indonesia , the two
largest exporters.  Production may increase in Thailand, Indonesia and
 Malaysia  in the third quarter, while supplies from Vietnam may
decline 9.4 percent as farmers delay latex tapping after a
spread of leave disease, the group said.  Total supply of natural rubber is expected to increase 4.9
percent to 9.96 million tons this year, it said. Production may
climb to as much as 10.3 million tons next year and further
expand to 13.4 million tons in 2018, the group said.  Imports by China,  India  and Malaysia are expected to
decline during the July-to-September period, the group said. The
three countries account for about 48 percent of global demand.  China, the largest buyer, may import 695,000 tons including
rubber compounds in the third quarter, a decline of 5.4 percent
from a year ago, the group said. Imports by India may plunge 32
percent in the third quarter, while Malaysia may buy 6.3 percent
less than a year earlier, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
