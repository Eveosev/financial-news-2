South Africa  wants  Wal-Mart Stores
Inc. (WMT)  and  Massmart Holdings Ltd. (MSM)  to increase the size of a
supplier-development fund to 500 million rand from 100 million
rand, Business Report said, citing an unidentified government
person familiar with the matter.  Three government departments are appealing antitrust
conditions imposed on Wal-Mart for the purchase of a controlling
stake in Massmart in an effort to boost the size of the fund,
the Johannesburg-based newspaper cited the person as saying.  The Competition Tribunal ruled on May 31 that the worldâ€™s
biggest retailer could proceed with the 16.5 billion-rand
takeover on condition no jobs are cut for two years. Economic
Development Minister Ebrahim Patel, Trade and Industry Minister
Rob Davies  and Forestry and Fisheries Minister Tina Joemat-
Pettersson filed an application appealed against the decision,
the Competition Tribunal said July 21.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
