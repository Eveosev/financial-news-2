Time Warner Cable Inc. (TWC) , the second-
largest U.S. cable-television operator, fell the most in more
than 10 months after subscriptions in the second quarter
declined more than analysts’ estimates.  Time Warner Cable declined $3.67, or 4.8 percent, to $73.43
at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the
largest one-day drop since Sept. 15. The shares have gained 11
percent this year.  The company lost 130,000 residential video subscribers
while gaining 54,000 residential broadband customers and 32,000
home phone users in the period ended June 30, according to a
statement today. The total drop in residential subscribers
trailed estimates from analysts including  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) ’s
Marci Ryvicker and Macquarie Securities’ Amy Yong.  “The fact that the overall primary service unit number is
negative is not good news,” said Yong.  Second-quarter subscription “weakness” has continued into
the early part of the third quarter, Time Warner Cable Chief
Operating Officer Rob Marcus said on a conference call today.
Some of the losses can be traced to “increased competitive
intensity” from companies including  DirecTV (DTV) ,  Verizon
Communications Inc. (VZ)  and  AT&T Inc. (T) , which are offering new and
cheaper packages in Time Warner Cable’s footprint, Marcus said.  Slowing Demand  Net income rose to $420 million, or $1.24 a share, from
$342 million, or 95 cents, a year earlier, the New York-based
company said today. Excluding one-time items, earnings per share
were $1.19. Analysts predicted $1.16, the average of estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Revenue from residential high-speed Internet grew 8.5
percent to $1.11 billion, helping to offset slowing demand for
TV subscriptions. Residential video revenue fell 0.1 percent to
$2.68 billion.  The company bought back 11.5 million shares for $863
million.  Todd Mitchell , an analyst at  Brean Murray Carret & Co .,
estimated the company would spend $500 million on repurchases
during the quarter, and Barclays Capital Inc.’s  James Ratcliffe 
estimated $750 million. The buybacks are part of $4 billion
repurchase plan that Time Warner Cable announced in November.  There is about $1.5 billion remaining from the
authorization. Time Warner Cable is likely to announce a new
share buyback authorization by the end of October, wrote Tom Eagan, an analyst at Collins Stewart LLC in New York, in a note
to shareholders.  Total sales rose 4.4 percent to $4.9 billion, compared with
the $4.94 billion average analyst estimate.  Chief Executive Officer Glenn Britt, on today’s conference
call, also hinted at acquisitions, acknowledging the company
continues “to be interested in expanding our cable footprint
when we can do so at the right price.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
