Iberdrola SA (IBE) , the world’s biggest
renewable energy producer, and wind-turbine maker Gamesa
Corporacion Tecnologica SA ended a strategic accord on wind-farm
development because of the economic crisis.  Iberdrola and Gamesa,  Europe ’s second-largest turbine
maker, signed the agreement in 2009 that allowed for joint
development and operation of wind parks and included options for
Iberdrola to buy projects in Europe from Gamesa starting this
month. The end of the deal, due to global economic conditions
and the companies’ strategies, means those options are
cancelled, the companies said in statements today in Madrid.  Gamesa, which also reported a 29 percent increase in first-
half net income today, rose 1.8 percent to 5.24 euros at 9:45
a.m. in  Madrid  today. Iberdrola fell 0.1 percent to 5.70 euros.  Zamudio, Spain-based Gamesa said first-half net income rose
to 29 million euros ($41.4 million), while revenue rose 26
percent to 1.3 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
