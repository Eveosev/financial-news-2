  Logitech International SA (LOGN) , the
world’s biggest maker of computer mice, declined as much as 3.5
percent in Zurich trading after posting a first-quarter loss
that was wider than analysts’ estimates and saying Gerald Quindlen stepped down as president and chief executive officer.  At 9:01 a.m., Logitech was down 20.5 centimes at 8.01 Swiss
francs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
