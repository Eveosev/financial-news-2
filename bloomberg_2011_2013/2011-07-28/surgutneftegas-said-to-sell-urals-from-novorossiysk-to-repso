OAO Surgutneftegas, a Russian oil
producer, sold a cargo of August-loading Urals crude to Repsol
YPF SA in a tender, said two traders who participate in the
market.  Repsol won a shipment for Aug. 12 to Aug. 13 loading from
the  Black Sea  port of Novorossiysk, according to the traders,
who declined to be identified because they arenâ€™t authorized to
speak to the media.  Surgutneftegas was also seeking to sell 100,000 tons of
Urals for loading Aug. 11 to Aug. 12 from Primorsk on the Black
Sea through the same tender. The outcome of this tender is not
available, the traders said.  Details of the sales are as follows:  To contact the reporter on this story:
