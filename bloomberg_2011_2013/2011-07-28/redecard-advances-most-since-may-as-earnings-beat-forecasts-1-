Redecard SA,  Brazil ’s second-biggest
card-payment processor by market value, rose the most since May,
leading gains for card companies after second-quarter profit was
higher than forecast.  Redecard advanced 5 percent to 26.25 reais at the close of
Sao Paulo trading at 4:15 p.m. New York time. Larger rival  Cielo
SA (CIEL3)  increased 2.8 percent to 42.30 reais.  The value of credit- and debit-card transactions processed
by Redecard rose 33 percent to 55.7 billion reais ($35.6
billion) in the second quarter from a year earlier, the company
said in a regulatory filing yesterday. That beat a 53.6 billion-
real estimate by  Raymond James , according to a research note
today by analysts Federico Rey-Marino and Francisco Pereyra. Net
income fell 14 percent to 322.6 million reais in the quarter on
higher costs and lower fees from a year earlier. The result beat
the average estimate of 291.8 million reais from nine analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Volumes continued to grow fast, and faster than expected,
suggesting that Redecard is still taking market share from
Cielo,” Rey-Marino and Pereyra wrote in the note. “The most
surprising event in the quarter was the unexpected increase in
the merchant discount rates.”  While fees charged to retailers for credit-card
transactions, known as the merchant discount rate, fell to 1.19
percent in the quarter from 1.43 percent a year earlier, they
recovered from 1.17 percent in the first quarter because of
negotiations with major clients, Redecard said.  Debit-card fees were stable at 0.78 percent in the quarter
compared with a year earlier, increasing from 0.75 percent in
the previous quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
