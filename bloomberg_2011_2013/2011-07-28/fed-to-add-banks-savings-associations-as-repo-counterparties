The  Federal Reserve Bank of New York 
is seeking to expand its counterparties in reverse repurchase
agreements to include banks and savings associations, for use
when policy makers drain the record amount of cash they added to
the financial system.  The New York Fed released the eligibility criteria today on
its  website.  Yesterday, the New York Fed added  Fannie Mae  and
 Freddie Mac  as counterparties. It also added domestic money
funds last year.  Fed officials have said they may use reverse repos, pay
interest on excess bank reserves and sell securities directly to
investors to withdraw or neutralize cash in the banking system.  In a reverse repo, the Fed lends securities for a set
period, draining cash from the banking system. At maturity, the
securities are returned to the Fed, and the cash to the primary
dealers. In a tri-party repo, a clearing bank acts as a third
party to make sure there’s adequate collateral behind the repo
and that it conforms throughout the life of the transaction to
the investor’s requirements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
