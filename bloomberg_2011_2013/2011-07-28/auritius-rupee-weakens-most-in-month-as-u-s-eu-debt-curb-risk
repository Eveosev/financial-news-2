Mauritius’s rupee weakened the most
in a month against the dollar as concern that the U.S. and
 Europe  will struggle to contain their debt burdens curbed
appetite for riskier, frontier-market assets.  The currency depreciated as much as 1.8 percent, the
biggest intraday decline since June 17, to 28.15 per dollar and
traded 1.3 percent down at 28 as of 11:46 a.m. in Port Louis,
according to Bloomberg data. Versus the euro, the rupee
strengthened 1.6 percent to 40.194.  Standard & Poor’s lowered  Greece  rating to CC, two steps
