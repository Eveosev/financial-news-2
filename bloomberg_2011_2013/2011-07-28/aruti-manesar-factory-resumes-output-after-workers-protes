Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL) ’s factory
at Manesar resumed production after employees halted work for an
hour today to protest plans to remove some workers, a labor
group said.  “We went on an hour’s tools-down strike after the company
threatened to terminate seven workers,” Sonu Nehra, one of the
workers who led the protest at the carmaker’s Manesar factory,
said by phone. “Everyone’s back at work now.”  Shares of Maruti,  India ’s biggest carmaker, fell as much as
2.6 percent after the Press Trust of India news service earlier
reported the workers’ strike at the factory located in the
northern state of Haryana. Today’s protest follows an 11-day
strike at the Manesar factory last month, when employees
demanded better working conditions and recognition for its
union. That strike ended when the company agreed to take back
workers who had been dismissed.  Kanwaldeep Singh, spokesman of Maruti Suzuki, did not
respond to an e-mail and three calls made to his mobile phone.  Shares fell 1.9 percent to 1,185.9 rupees at the 3:30 p.m.
close in Mumbai. The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index
dropped 1.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
