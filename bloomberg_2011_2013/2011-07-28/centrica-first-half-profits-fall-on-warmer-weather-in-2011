Centrica Plc (CNA) , the U.K.’s largest
energy supplier, said first-half profit dropped on higher
commodity costs and lower natural gas and electricity demand.  Adjusted operating profit declined 19 percent to 1.26
billion pounds ($2 billion), missing the 1.3 billion-pound
median estimate of five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Revenue
dropped 2 percent to 11.5 billion pounds.  Wholesale gas prices were 30 percent higher, while average
residential gas consumption was down 18 percent in the first six
months of the year compared with the same period of 2010, the
company said in a statement. Warmer temperatures and energy
efficiency measures also trimmed electricity consumption.  “The first half was pretty turbulent,” Finance Director
Nick Luff said on a conference call today. There will be a
“better balance” between the two halves of the year in 2011,
compared with 2010 when the coldest winter in 30 years skewed
results, he said.  The utility is “on track” to increase earnings in 2011,
it said in the statement. While U.K. residential operating
profits are half of what they were last year, revenue coming
from the company’s exploration and production business, as well
as a recently announced price increase, will shore up full-year
results, Luff said.  “While the overall numbers were okay, we believe the
composition of the operating profit could give some cause for
concern,” Unicredit SpA analyst Scott Phillips said in a note
to investors today. “The downstream retail business was weaker
than expected –- particularly in residential services, which is
feeling the effects of the weak macro and increasingly
competitive environment.”  Price Increase  Centrica said earlier this month that it will raise
domestic gas rates by an average of 18 percent and electricity
prices by 16 percent from Aug. 18. Three of the U.K.’s six
largest energy companies including  Iberdrola SA (IBE) ’s Scottish Power
and  Scottish & Southern Energy Plc (SSE)  have announced price
increases over the past month.  The company added 159,000 residential energy customers,
boosting the total number of accounts to 16.1 million, the
highest since 2005. Operating profit from Centrica’s downstream
business dropped 38 percent to 518 million pounds because of
lower consumption.  Centrica retreated 2.3 percent to 313 pence in  London . The
stock has slipped 5.6 percent this year, valuing the utility at
16.2 billion pounds.  The utility will spend 1.3 billion pounds in 2011, mostly
on upstream oil and gas production and its 270 megawatt Lincs
offshore wind farm. The company owns 50 percent in the wind
farm, with  Siemens AG (SIE)  and Dong Energy AS controlling the rest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
