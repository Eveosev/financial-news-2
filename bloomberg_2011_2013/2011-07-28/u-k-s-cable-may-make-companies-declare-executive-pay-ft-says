U.K. Business Secretary Vince Cable
is being urged to require companies to reveal the share of
revenue that goes to executive pay, compared with dividends,
 capital investment  and overall remuneration, the Financial Times
reported, without attribution.  Cable sees a “serious problem” in the misalignment of
executive pay with company performance, with pay running far
ahead of share prices, the FT said, citing comments by Cable.  To contact the reporter on this story:
