KenolKobil Ltd., a Kenyan fuel
retailer with operations in nine African nations, gained to the
highest in two weeks after  Business Daily  reported the company
plans to raise money to fund its expansion.  The company’s shares climbed for a second day, adding 1.7
percent to 11.70 shillings as of 2:16 p.m. in the capital,
Nairobi, the second day of gains.  KenolKobil plans to raise as much as 1.5 billion shillings
($16.5 million) through the sale of promissory notes that were
approved last month, the Nairobi-based newspaper said, citing
Patrick Kondo, the company’s mergers and acquisitions manager.  The fuel retailer plans to enter  Namibia , the  Democratic
Republic of Congo ,  Mozambique , Malawi and Botswana amid plans to
reduce reliance on Kenyan operations, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
