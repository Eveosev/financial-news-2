The  New Zealand  dollar rose toward a
record high after the central bank said it will likely remove
the half-percentage-point “insurance” cut in the target
lending rate made after a February earthquake.  Gains in the currency were limited as Reserve Bank Governor
Alan Bollard signaled the kiwi’s strength may reduce the extent
of rate increases.  Australia ’s dollar was little changed after
advancing toward its highest level against the greenback since
it was freely floated in 1983 as the U.S. House prepared to vote
on a debt-limit plan that faces opposition in the Senate.  “The statement is slightly bullish for the kiwi because it
now brings in the possibility of a September rate hike, which we
didn’t have before,” said  Imre Speizer , a strategist at Westpac
Banking Corp., Australia’s second-largest lender. “It means
that they can actually hike by 50 basis points in September and
then pause for a while.”  New Zealand’s dollar rose 0.2 percent to 87.13 U.S. cents
at 12:58 p.m. in  New York , from 86.98 cents yesterday, when it
reached as high as 87.66, the most since it was freely floated
in 1985. Australia’s dollar fell 0.1 percent to $1.1010, from
$1.1020 yesterday, when it climbed to a record $1.1081.  Benchmark rates are 2.5 percent in New Zealand and 4.75
percent in Australia, compared with as low as zero in the U.S.
and  Japan .  To contact the reporter on this story:
