Israel ’s 10-year government bonds
headed for the first monthly gain since May on speculation the
central bank will slow the pace of  interest rates  increases on
signs of weaker economic growth.  The yield on the benchmark 5 percent Mimshal Shiklit notes
due in January 2020 dropped 14 basis points, or 0.14 percentage
point, since the end of June to 5.02 percent at 1:32 p.m. in  Tel
Aviv . The rate declined one basis point today. The shekel
weakened 0.7 percent to 3.4330 against the dollar, bringing the
monthly declined to 0.9 percent.  “Yields on the long-end have been performing well this
month on signs of softer growth, which are fueling bets monetary
tightening will not be as aggressively as previously expected,”
 Jonathan Katz , a Jerusalem-based economist at HSBC Holdings Plc,
said by telephone. “Concerns over weak global growth are also
softening growth and inflation expectations.”  The  Bank of Israel  maintained its main lending rate at 3.25
percent for a second month on July 25, as exports dropped amid
weaker global demand. Central bank Governor Stanley Fischer
raised the rate 10 times in the past two years from a record low
of 0.5 percent in August 2009, as Israel recovered from the
global recession faster than most major economies.  Two-year interest-rate swaps, an indicator of investor
expectations for the benchmark rate, were little changed at 3.86
percent today, according to Bloomberg data. Economic growth may
be slower this year than the central bank’s forecast of 5.2
percent, Fischer said on July 7.  “Most economic indicators published this month support the
assessment that the rate of growth in economic activity in
Israel moderated in the second quarter, primarily as a result of
the slower expansion of goods exports,” the bank said in its
interest rate decision on July 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
