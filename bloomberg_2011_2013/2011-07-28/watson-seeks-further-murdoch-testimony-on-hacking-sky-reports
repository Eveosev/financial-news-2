British lawmaker  Tom Watson , a
member of the media committee probing the phone-hacking scandal,
will ask the committee to “immediately invite”  News Corp. (NWSA) 
Deputy Chief Operating Officer James Murdoch, as well as Colin Myler and Tom Crone to answer more questions about the hacking
of phones by reporters at the News of the World newspaper, Sky
reported, in an interview with Watson.  “There are some quite central questions that still need
answering” about the “contradictory stories” given, Watson
said in the interview. The invitations will be issued “in the
very near future,” Watson said to Sky.  Myler is the former editor of News of the World and Crone
is the former legal manager at News International.  To contact the reporter on this story:
