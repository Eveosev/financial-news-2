A top official from  South Africa ’s
ruling African National Congress rejected calls from the party’s
youth wing for the country’s mines and banks to be nationalized,
and acknowledged that debate on the issue may be hampering
efforts to attract investment.  “I certainly do not believe that we should indulge
ourselves in meddling with the affairs of successful and
profitable concerns,” ANC Treasurer-General Mathews Phosa said
in an e-mailed copy of a speech delivered at a lunch hosted by
Standard Bank Group Ltd. today. “We could, however, create
state-owned entities to compete in the market, such as in the
mining sector.”  Calls for the government to seize mines, banks and land are
being led by  Julius Malema , the youth league’s leader, who says
the country’s black majority doesn’t have an adequate stake in
 Africa ’s largest economy 17 years after the end of white-
minority rule. The ANC agreed in November to institute an
independent study on the viability of nationalization and debate
its findings next year.  “Criticism regarding the drawn-out manner in which we have
dealt with this matter in terms of decision-making is valid.”
Phosa said. The ANC needs to “understand how our debates impact
on foreign direct investment and on the local commercial
partnerships that we have carefully forged.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
