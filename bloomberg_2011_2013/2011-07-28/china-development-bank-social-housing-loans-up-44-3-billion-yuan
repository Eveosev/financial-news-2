China Development Bank Corp., the
state policy lender, boosted outstanding loans for affordable
housing projects by 44.3 billion yuan ($6.9 billion) in the
first six months, it said in a statement on its website today.  The rise was nearly half the 90.8 billion yuan increase in
affordable housing loans from Chinese banks this year, said the
statement. The lender, which is also known as CDB, plans to
spend 100 billion yuan to support construction of social housing,
it said.  China aims to build 10 million units of affordable homes
this year. Loans for such projects have been exempted from a
crackdown on lending as the worldâ€™s fastest growing major
economy battles to curb prices that rose 6.4 percent year-on-
year last month.  -- Henry Sanderson . Editor: Hugh Chow  To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:
