India ’s 10-year bond yield rose to
its highest level in 34 months after the central bank boosted
 interest rates  this week for the fifth time in 2011 to damp
inflation.  The  Reserve Bank  of India raised the repurchase rate by 50
basis points to 8 percent on July 26, double the increase
forecast by most economists in a Bloomberg survey. Finance
Minister Pranab Mukherjee said yesterday he couldn’t say if the
central bank has reached the end of the rate-rise cycle.  “Bonds are likely to trade in a narrow range around
current levels,” said  Anoop Verma , a fixed-income trader at
Development Credit Bank in Mumbai. “Investors are probably
refraining from adding to their holdings after the rate increase
as inflation is still a concern.”  The yield on the 7.8 percent government debt due April 2021
rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.47 percent,
the highest level since Sept. 29, 2008, as of the 5 p.m. close
in Mumbai, according to central bank data.  Inflation has held above 8 percent every month since the
beginning of 2010. Wholesale prices rose 9.44 percent in June
from a year earlier after climbing 9.06 percent the previous
month, according to the latest government data issued on July 14.  Food inflation decelerated to the slowest pace since
February 2009 after prices of pulses, milk, meat and fish eased.  An index measuring wholesale prices of agricultural
products gained 7.33 percent in the week ended July 16 from a
year earlier, the commerce ministry said in a statement today.
It rose 7.58 percent the previous week.  Monsoon rainfall may be less than forecast in July, the
weather bureau said, likely slowing oilseed planting in the
world’s second-biggest importer of cooking oils.  Rains this month may be about 90 percent of the 50-year
average, Ajit Tyagi, director general of the  India
Meteorological Department , said today in an interview. That
compares with 93 percent predicted by the bureau on June 21.
July accounts for one-third of total showers.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
rose two basis points today to 8.35 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
