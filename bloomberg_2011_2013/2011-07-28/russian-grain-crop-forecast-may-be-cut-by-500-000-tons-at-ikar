Russia’s Institute for Agricultural
Market Studies, or  Ikar , may reduce its forecast for the
national grain crop by 500,000 metric tons to 89 million tons if
heat persists for another seven to 10 days.  Higher temperatures and a lack of rain are fueling concern
about maturation of corn in European Russia and development of
other spring crops in parts of the Urals region, Ikar grain
analyst Oleg Sukhanov said by phone from Moscow today.  While the forecast may be lowered if no rain falls in the
next few days, the reduction will have little effect on overall
crop projections, Sukhanov said.  According to a weather forecast by  the Federal
Hydrometeorological Center , “conditions for late crops’
formation will be worsening because of the higher temperatures
that will be dominant” in European Russia in July’s last 10
days.  Dryness affected corn, buckwheat, potatoes and sugar beets
in the southern parts of the Central and Volga federal districts
in the July 15-20 period, the center said on its website. Heat
and lack of moisture slowed growth of sugar beets in the
Southern and North Caucasus federal districts, it  said .  While heat affected crops in some areas, it will “have
only a positive effect in the regions which are conducting
reaping,” Anna Strashnaya, head of agro-meteorological
forecasts at the center, told Bloomberg on July 27. Those are
the Southern, Northern Caucasus, and Central federal districts
as well as the southern part of the Volga Federal District, she
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
