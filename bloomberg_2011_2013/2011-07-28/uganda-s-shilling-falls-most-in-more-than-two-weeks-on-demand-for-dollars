Uganda ’s shilling, the world’s
second worst-performing currency in the last six months, fell
the most in two weeks as buyers raised demand for dollars.  The currency of  Africa ’s second-biggest coffee producer
depreciated 0.1 percent to 2,607.5, the weakest since July 13,
and traded at 2,605.25 by 3:51 p.m. in Kampala, the capital.  “We had some slight demand in the morning,” Ahmed Kalule,
a currency trader at Bank of Africa Uganda Ltd., said by phone
from Kampala. “Buyers were compelled to buy dollars because
they have excess amounts of the shilling witnessed through
yesterday’s oversubscription” at a central-bank debt sale, he
said.  Investors bid for 218.6 billion shillings ($84 million) of
12-month bills at the auction, the biggest amount demanded since
April 2010, with 45 billion shillings allocated, according to
central-bank data on Bloomberg. The yield fell to 14.719 percent
after reaching the highest since February 2009 at the previous
sale.  The shilling has depreciated 12 percent against the dollar
over the past six months, making it the world’s second-worst
performer after Maldives’ rufiyaa, as a surge in food and fuel
prices pushed inflation to a 17-year high.  To contact the reporter on this story:
