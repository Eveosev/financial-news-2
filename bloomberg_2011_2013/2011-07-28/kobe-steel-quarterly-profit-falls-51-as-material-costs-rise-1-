Kobe Steel Ltd. (5406) ,  Japan â€™s fourth-
largest steelmaker, posted a 51 percent decline in first-quarter
profit as raw material costs increased.  Net income fell to 9.84 billion yen ($126.5 million) in the
three months ended June 30 from 20 billion yen a year earlier,
the Kobe-based company said today in a statement.  The company today forecast net income may be 20 billion yen
in the financial year to March 2012 down 62 percent from a year
earlier. Profit in the first half may be 10 billion yen, down 66
percent on the previous period, it said.  Steelmakers are seeing profit margins squeezed as price
increases fail to keep pace with rising material costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
