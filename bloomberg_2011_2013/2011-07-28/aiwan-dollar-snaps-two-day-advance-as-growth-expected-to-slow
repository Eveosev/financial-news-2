Taiwan ’s dollar dropped, snapping a
two-day gain, ahead of a report that economists predict will
show the economy grew at the slowest pace in almost two years in
the second quarter.  Gross domestic product increased 4.50 percent from a year
earlier, compared with a rise of 6.55 percent in the previous
three months, according to the median estimate of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg before data due tomorrow. The MSCI Asia-
Pacific Index of stocks declined 1.1 percent after House Speaker
 John Boehner  revised his plan to raise the U.S. debt ceiling,
gaining support among fellow Republicans for a proposal which
Senate Democrats said they won’t support.  “It’s risk-off sentiment affecting the market today
brought by the lingering U.S. debt ceiling concern,” said
 Frances Cheung , a senior strategist at Credit Agricole CIB in
 Hong Kong . “We’ve seen signs of slowing economic growth across
 Asia  and that’s affecting the currencies too.”  Taiwan’s dollar fell 0.2 percent to NT$28.845 against its
U.S. counterpart as of the 4 p.m. local time close, according to
Taipei Forex Inc. It touched NT$28.902 earlier, the weakest
level since July 22.  Government bonds extended their decline after the
government sold NT$30 billion ($1 billion) of 20-year bonds
today at a yield higher than traders forecast as insurers, the
biggest buyers of 20-year debt at auctions this year, almost
halved their purchases.  Auction Yields Rise  The Ministry of Finance sold the securities at a yield of
1.975 percent, compared with the 1.945 percent median estimate
in a Bloomberg News survey of six finance companies.  The yield on the 2 percent due July 2016, the most-traded
 government bonds , increased two basis points to 1.209 percent,
prices from Gretai Securities Market show. The rate reached
1.222 percent on July 22, the highest level for a benchmark
five-year note since January 2009.  The overnight money-market rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, increased one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 0.391 percent, according to a weighted
average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
