Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and Petroliam
Nasional Bhd. workers will end an 18-day strike in South Africa
after signing a wage agreement with employers, arbitrators said.  “All parties signed the settlement,” the Commission for
Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration said in a statement.  Oil companies  operating in the country will increase entry-
level pay 10 percent and other salaries will rise 8.5 percent,
Solidarity Deputy General Secretary Dirk Hermann said by phone.  BP Plc,  Sasol Ltd. (SOL)  and PetroSA are also party to the accord
following the strike, which forced producers to reduce output
and caused shortages at filling stations in Africa’s biggest
economy. Diamond, coal and gold companies are also dealing with
wage demands above the inflation rate of about 5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
