Scor SE (SCR) , France’s largest reinsurer,
said second-quarter profit was unchanged as higher property-and-
casualty premiums countered a drop in life sales.  Net income totaled 120 million euros ($172 million), the
Paris-based company said today in a statement. The reinsurer
repeated its forecast for property-and-casualty sales to rise 9
percent this year.  Scor’s global property-and-casualty unit had 991 million
euros of gross premiums in the quarter, a 16 percent increase
from a year earlier, the company said. That outweighed a decline
in sales of life premiums, which fell 5.8 percent to 744 million
euros.  “Scor’s very good results in the quarter and its capacity
to absorb major shocks” demonstrate “the relevance of the
group’s business model,” Chief Executive Officer Denis Kessler
said in the statement.  The reinsurer’s first-half profit dropped 75 percent to 40
million euros after the company posted a net loss of 80 million
euros in the first quarter because of “unprecedented”
catastrophes such as the floods in  Australia  and earthquakes in
 New Zealand  and  Japan .  Policy renewals for June and July have been “excellent”
with a gain of 22 percent, the company said.  Reinsurers help primary carriers including Allianz SE and
Axa SA shoulder risks for clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
