Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and  Chevron
Corp. (CVX)  are examining plans to expand the  Malampaya  natural-gas
project in the Philippines.  The partners are negotiating the second and third phases of
the project, which started pumping gas in 2001 to supply fuel
for power generation at the Batangas plant.  They plan to “maximize the country’s clean energy
resources” supply, Shell’s Chief Executive Officer Peter Voser
told reporters on a conference call today.  The field, located in the province of Palawan, holds an
estimated 2.7 trillion cubic feet of gas. The partners, which
include the state-owned  PNOC Exploration Corp. (PECB) , may invest as
much as $1.5 billion in the hunt for more reserves, Energy
Secretary Rene Almendras said last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
