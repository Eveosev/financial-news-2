China ’s overnight money-market rate
dropped the most in more than two weeks as the central bank
injected cash to help ease a cash squeeze.  The People’s Bank of China added a net 32 billion yuan
($4.96 billion) this week, compared with 19 billion yuan in the
five days through July 22, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The money-market rate fell for a fifth day before the
China Securities Regulatory Commission reviews tomorrow an
initial public offering application by Sinohydro Group Ltd. to
fund 17.3 billion yuan of projects.  “The PBOC’s capital injection has helped ease the cash
shortage a bit,” said Tang Guohui, a bond analyst at Industrial
Securities Co. in  Shanghai . “There are big uncertainties in the
liquidity situation next month because of the possible upcoming
IPO.”  The one-day repurchase rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, dropped 52 basis points to 3.65 percent as
of 1:26 p.m. in Shanghai, according to a weighted average rate
compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center. That was the
biggest slide since July 12. The seven-day rate rose nine basis
points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 5.06 percent.  The central bank kept the yield on three-month bills
unchanged at 3.0801 percent for a fourth week at an auction,
according to a statement on its website today. The monetary
authority didn’t offer any  repurchase agreements , according to
the statement.  The one-year interest-rate swap contract, the fixed cost
needed to receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate,
dropped one basis point to 4.23 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on the 3.94 percent government bond due January
2021 was unchanged at 4.08 percent, according to the Interbank
Funding Center.  -- Judy Chen . Editors: Ven Ram,  James Regan   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
