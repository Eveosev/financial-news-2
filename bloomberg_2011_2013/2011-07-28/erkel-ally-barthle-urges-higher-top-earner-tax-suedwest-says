Germany  should raise the income-tax
rate for individuals earning more than 100,000 euros ($142,800)
per year to help pay for tax cuts for low earners,  Norbert Barthle , a senior coalition lawmaker,  told  Suedwest Presse.  The threshold for the 42 percent income-tax rate should be
raised to 70,000 euros or 80,000 euros per year from 53,000
euros at present, said Barthle, the budget policy spokesman for
 Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s conservative bloc in parliament. The
rate for individuals earning 250,000 euros per year or more
should be kept at 45 percent, he was cited as saying. Barthle
didn’t say which tax rate should apply between 100,000 euros and
250,000 euros of income.  Barthle told the newspaper he sees no leeway to abolish the
so-called solidarity surcharge on income and corporate taxes
that generates about 12 billion euros per year for federal
coffers, rejecting a proposal by members of Merkel’s Free
Democratic Party coalition partner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
