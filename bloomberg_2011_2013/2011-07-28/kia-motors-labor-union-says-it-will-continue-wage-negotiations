Union officials representing workers
at  Kia Motors Corp. (000270) ,  South Korea ’s second-biggest carmaker, will
continue negotiations with the company after a majority of
employees yesterday rejected a wage pact.  Workers at the Seoul-based company will consider whether or
not to strike after the summer vacation period that lasts from
July 30 to Aug. 7, according to a statement today from the Kia
Motors Workers’ Union.  Company spokesman Michael Choo declined to comment on the
results of the voting yesterday and any potential strike.  Only 46 percent of the workers voted in favor of the
agreement yesterday, rejecting the pact made between union
officials and the company on July 22.  “Depending on how things go, we will consider going into a
strike after the break,” said Kim Yeon Hong, secretary general
of the Korea Metal Workers Union, an umbrella labor group that
covers the Kia Motors Workers’ Union. “We can’t definitively
say there will be a strike.”  Kia Motors shares fell 2.4 percent to 77,500 won as of the
3 p.m. close of trading in  Seoul  today, compared with a 0.9
percent decline in the benchmark Kospi index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
