Middle East oil for sale to  Asia 
traded at discounts as refiners eased purchases amid declining
processing profits.  Murban, produced by Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., stayed at a
discount of 13 cents a barrel to its official selling price for
September loading, according to data compiled by Bloomberg News.
Qatar Marine remained at a discount of 18 cents a barrel to its
official selling price, Bloomberg data showed.  Refiners may be easing purchases as a drop in refining
profits reduce the incentive to run plants at maximum capacity.
The black-white spread, or the price difference between fuel oil
and diesel, dropped 1 cent to $24.17 a barrel today, down from
$26.25 a week ago. The narrowing spread indicates refiners with
the ability to upgrade  fuel oil  are making less money than
before.  Oman crude for immediate loading declined 33 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $112.31 a barrel, Bloomberg data showed. Dubai oil
for delivery in September fell 0.3 percent to $111.85. Murban
decreased 0.3 percent to $116.10.  Oman futures for September delivery rose 67 cents to
$112.67 a barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange  at 5:41 p.m.
Singapore time, with 1,395 contracts traded. The settlement
price was $113.30 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  The September Brent-Dubai EFS widened 28 cents to $5.82 a
barrel, according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a
London-based broker. The exchange for swaps for October widened
14 cents to $5.36.  To contact the reporter on this story:
