Ryan Lochte of the U.S. beat his
teammate and 14-time Olympic gold medalist Michael Phelps in the
200-meter individual medley final at the world swimming
championships in a world-record time.  Defending champion Lochte won in 1 minute, 54.00 seconds in
 Shanghai , breaking his own previous mark by 0.10 second. It was
the first world record set during the championships, ending a
long-course drought since high-tech bodysuits were banned 1 1/2
years ago. Forty-three records fell at the 2009 world
championships in Rome.  “I don’t think the suits make any difference, it’s all in
your head,” Lochte told the British Broadcasting Corp. “People
said that record would never be broken and I just wanted to
prove them wrong.”  Phelps, a two-time Olympic champion in the event, finished
second in 1:54.16, while  Hungary ’s Laszlo Cseh was third in
1:57.69.  “To be honest, I can’t be upset with that, it’s faster
than I did in the Olympics,” Phelps told reporters. “I thought
I had it on the last stroke, I felt myself gaining and gaining.
There’s lots of frustration going through my head, I think it’s
going to help me through the tough months of training over the
next year.”  It’s the last major international swimming meet before the
 2012 Olympics , which start in a year’s time in  London . Phelps
has said he’ll retire after those Games.  Freestyle Final  Lochte also beat Phelps two days ago in the final of the
200-meter freestyle. Phelps yesterday won his first gold medal
in Shanghai as he retained his 200-meter butterfly title.  “I think he has more comfortable speed now than he had
before,” Phelps said of Lochte. “He’s super-focused right now
and you can see that. He’s putting the races together that are
helping him win.”  Also today, the fifth day of the world championships, James
Magnussen of  Australia  won the 100-meter freestyle final in
47.63 seconds.  China ’s Jiao Liuyang won the women’s 200-meter butterfly in
2:05.55 while Anastasia Zueva of  Russia  took the women’s 50-
meter backstroke in 27.79 seconds. The U.S. won the women’s 800-
meter relay in 7:46.14, ahead of Australia and China.  To contact the reporter on this story:
