Nectar d.o.o ., a Serbian beverage
maker, said its purchase of Slovenia’s Fructal d.o.o. may cost
more than 50 million euros ($71.3 million) and the investment
may pay off in seven years.  Two days after announcing it will buy 93.7 percent of
Fructal for 35.3 million euros from Pivovarna Lasko Group
d.d., Nectar confirmed it will also assume Fructal’s debt of
more than 13 million euros and that it was in talks with
creditors to refinance it.  “We will also have to offer to buy the remaining equity,
so our overall investment will probably exceed 50 million
euros,” Nectar General Manager Bojan Radun told reporters in
Belgrade today. He refuted speculation that the family-owned
Nectar may have overpaid the Slovenian juice maker.  “We expect the investment to return in seven years and
our business plan allows for nine years, so I think it’s
comfortable,” Radun said. The two companies’ combined sales
will grow more than 15 percent this year to 140 million euros,
he said.  The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has
approved a  loan  of as much as 35 million euros to Nectar to
support its acquisition of Fructal.  Pivovarna Lasko (PILR) ’s shareholders are set to vote on the
deal on July 30. Pending approval from regulators in several
Balkan countries where Nectar and Fructal are present, the
takeover may be completed by early November, Radun said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
