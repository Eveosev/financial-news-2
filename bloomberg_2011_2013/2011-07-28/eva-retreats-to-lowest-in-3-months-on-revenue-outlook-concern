Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) 
dropped to the lowest level in almost three months after the
world’s largest generic drugmaker said third-quarter profit will
miss analysts’ estimates.  The shares tumbled 2.2 percent to 157.10 shekels at the
4:30 p.m. close in  Tel Aviv , the lowest since May 1.  Third-quarter earnings excluding some costs will be $1.22 a
share, Chief Financial Officer Eyal Desheh said on a conference
call yesterday. That falls short of the $1.35 a share analysts
expected, based on the average of 20 estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. The Petach Tikva, Israel-based Teva said it expects
to meet a full-year target of $4.90 to $5.20 a share.  “We’re all struggling a little bit with the trajectory
from here to the end of the year because it’s so back-end
loaded,” Ronny Gal, a New York-based analyst for Sanford C.
Bernstein & Co., told Teva executives on the call.  To contact the reporter on this story:
