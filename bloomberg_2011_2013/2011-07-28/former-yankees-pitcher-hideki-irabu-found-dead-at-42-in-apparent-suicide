Former New York Yankees pitcher
Hideki Irabu committed suicide by hanging himself, the Los
Angeles County coroner’s office said.  An autopsy on Irabu, 42, whose body was found at his home
in  Rancho Palos Verdes , was completed yesterday, coroner’s
investigator Kitty McCracken said in a telephone interview.  The Yankees held a moment of silence in memory of Irabu,
whose major league record never matched the dominance in his
native  Japan , before last night’s game against the  Baltimore
Orioles  at Yankee Stadium.  Irabu went 34-35 in six major league seasons in 1997-2002,
including stints with the Montreal Expos and Texas Rangers.
Before that, he led Japan’s Pacific League in strikeouts and
earned run average in 1995 and 1996.  Five years after his major league career ended in 2002,
Irabu returned to pitching in Japan. A wrist injury forced the
right-hander to retire for good in January 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
