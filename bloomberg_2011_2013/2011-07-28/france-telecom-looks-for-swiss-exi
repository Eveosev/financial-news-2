France Telecom SA (FTE) , the nation’s
largest phone company, is seeking a buyer for its Swiss business
more than a year after regulators blocked a deal to merge the
unit with a rival.  The board will decide on a sale after weighing the quality
of the offers, the Parisian company said today in a statement.
The Swiss division, which had about 1.7 million mobile clients
last year, may fetch about 1.4 billion euros ($2 billion) based
on preliminary estimates, WestLB analyst Tarkan Cinar said.  Chief Executive Officer Stephane Richard is reviewing
 France Telecom ’s European investments and looking for new assets
in Africa as growth in the telecommunications market slows in
developed countries. The review will focus on operators in which
France Telecom has only a minority stake, such as those in
Portugal and Austria.  Swiss antitrust authorities stopped a planned merger last
year between Orange Switzerland and Sunrise, then owned by TDC
A/S, that would have left the country of 8 million with two
mobile operators. Swisscom AG, which is majority-owned by the
Swiss government, is the country’s largest operator.  Separately, Richard said today that France Telecom would
consider acquisitions in Spain, where the company already
operates, if they are available. In addition to  Telefonica SA (TEF) 
and Vodafone Group Plc,  TeliaSonera AB (TLSN)  operates in Spain through
its Yoigo unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
