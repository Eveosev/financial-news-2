Russia  is studying the profitability
of a pipeline supplying natural-gas to  Turkey  to decide whether
the government can levy export duty on the fuel to raise funds
for the budget and lower taxes on state-run OAO Gazprom.  Russia and Turkey had agreed gas shipped through the Blue
Stream pipe wouldn’t be liable for duty until the project was
profitable, according to Russian Energy Minister Sergei Shmatko.  “The Intergovernmental agreement allows for breaks from
export duties for the Blue Stream pipe until the project has
broken even,” Shmatko said in Moscow today. “We, with Gazprom,
have reached the phase where we are examining the project’s
performance. After that we will take the appropriate decision.”  The  Finance Ministry , seeking an extra 150 billion rubles
($5.4 billion) in revenue for the budget, has proposed raising
extraction tax on Gazprom to 509 rubles per 1,000 cubic meters
in 2012, or just 431 rubles if export duty can be wrested from
Blue Stream. The ministry had last month proposed a gain to 480
rubles for next year, still double the extraction tax for 2011.  Blue Stream, below the  Black Sea , last year shipped just
over half its 16 billion cubic-meter capacity, Gazprom says.  To contact the reporters on this story:
