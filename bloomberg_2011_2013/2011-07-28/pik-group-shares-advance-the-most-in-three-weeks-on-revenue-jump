PIK Group (PIKK)  climbed the most in almost
two months after the Russian property developer said gross cash
collections jumped 57 percent in the first half as the countryâ€™s
economic recovery drove demand for new apartments.  The company advanced 1.4 percent to 108.28 rubles by the
6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, its biggest advance since May 30.  Revenue rose to 23.3 billion rubles ($845 million) from
14.9 billion rubles in the same period last year, PIK said in a
statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
