St. James’s Place Plc, the wealth
manager majority-owned by Lloyds Banking Group Plc, said first-
half profit climbed 68 percent as it attracted new funds.  Net income rose to 47.6 million pounds ($77.8 million) in
the six months to June 30, compared with 28.4 million pounds a
year earlier, the Cirencester, England-based firm said today in
a statement. That beat the 43 million-pound estimate of four
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “The results were particularly pleasing given the current
economic environment, sovereign debt concerns and fragile stock
markets,” Chief Executive Officer David Bellamy said in the
statement. “We continue to attract new funds from both new and
existing clients.”  St. James’s Place, which advises clients with more than
30,000 pounds to invest, is the best-performing member of the
 FTSE ASX Life Insurance (FALIFE)  Index over the past six months after
raising its dividend 49 percent in February. The firm has
benefitted from wealthy clients seeking to shelter their savings
in tax-free accounts as the British government raised levies on
higher earners.  Net inflow of funds grew 13 percent to 1.7 billion pounds,
the company said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
