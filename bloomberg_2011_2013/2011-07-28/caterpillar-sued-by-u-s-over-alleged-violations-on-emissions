Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) , the world’s
largest maker of construction and mining equipment, agreed to
pay $2.55 million to resolve a U.S. lawsuit that accused it of
selling engines for on- and off-road vehicles that violated
environmental laws.  Under a consent decree, Peoria, Illinois-based Caterpillar
also agreed to recall noncompliant engines and install required
equipment, the U.S.  Justice Department  said today in an e-mailed
statement.  The Justice Department, in a lawsuit filed today in federal
court in  Washington , said Caterpillar sold more than 590,000
engines that didn’t conform to Environmental Protection Agency
standards, in violation of the National Emission Standards Act.  The engines were shipped to equipment manufacturers from
February 2002 to November 2006, according to the complaint. The
U.S. said the engines weren’t equipped with fuel-programming
software required for EPA certification.  “As the decree indicates, Caterpillar denies any
wrongdoing, but does agree that the decree represents a good-
faith effort between the parties to resolve their differences
and avoid potentially lengthy litigation,” Bridget M. Young, a
Caterpillar spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed statement.
“Caterpillar is committed to following the terms of the decree.”  The case is U.S. v. Caterpillar Inc., 11-cv-01373, U.S.
District Court,  District of Columbia  (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
