Romania harvested 5.8 million metric
tons of wheat so far this year, exceeding last year’s total crop
as favorable weather helped increase output and the quality of
grains, Agriculture Minister Valeriu Tabara said.  The eastern European country, which harvested 83 percent of
planted areas by yesterday, estimates total wheat production at
6.7 million tons, 18 percent more than the 5.7 million tons
harvested in 2010, Tabara said today at a news conference in
Bucharest.  “The quality of the wheat harvested so far is very good,”
Tabara said. “We can secure internal consumption and we can
also export some of it.”  Romania is seeking to take advantage of higher
international prices for grains and increase its exports as its
farmers need money to invest in fertilizers and machinery to
improve output. The country’s barley harvest is higher than
estimated previously, at 758,000 tons compared with a forecast
of 712,000 tons, Tabara said. The rapeseed crop is 16 percent
higher than anticipated, at 748,000 tons.  To contact the reporters on this story:
