Russian stocks snapped a four-day
losing streak as oil, the country’s biggest export revenue
earner, rebounded and a report signaled the weakness in the U.S.
labor market was fading.  The Micex Index of 30 stocks advanced 0.8 percent to
1,720.38 by the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow. Oil producer OAO
Tatneft rose 0.9 percent, while OAO Gazprom, the natural gas
export monopoly, advanced 1 percent. OAO Novatek,  Russia ’s
second-largest natural gas producer, jumped 2.3 percent. The
dollar-denominated RTS Index increased 0.5 percent to 1,985.11.  Crude for September delivery gained 0.2 percent to $97.61 a
barrel in  New York , erasing an earlier loss of as much as 0.9
percent, after the Labor Department said applications for
 unemployment benefits  dropped last week to the lowest level
since April.  “U.S. jobs data is helping the Micex today, as is oil,”
Marco Casas, a New York-based vice-president of equity sales at
Otkritie Capital, said in e-mailed comments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
