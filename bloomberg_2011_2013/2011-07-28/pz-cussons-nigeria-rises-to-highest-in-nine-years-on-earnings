PZ Cussons Nigeria Plc (PZ) , a
manufacturer of consumer products and home appliances, rose to
highest price in more than nine years after saying full-year
profit advanced.  The stock climbed by 1.90 kobo, or 4.99 percent, to 40
naira per share, the highest level since at least January 2002
at the 2:30 p.m. close of trading in Lagos.  Net income for the year gained to 5.7 billion naira ($37.2
million) from 5.6 billion naira a year earlier, according to
 Renaissance Capital , which cited figures released by the
 Nigerian Stock Exchange . Revenue increased to 65.9 billion naira
from 62.7 billion naira, it said.  “The price gain is a reflection of the profit declared by
the company,” Chris Okoro, operations head of Lagos-based
Gosord Securities Ltd. said on phone today. “There is increased
confidence on conglomerates based on their market share.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
