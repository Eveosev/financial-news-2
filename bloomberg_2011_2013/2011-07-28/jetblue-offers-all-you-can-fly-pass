JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU)  is selling a
three-month pass for unlimited flights to help win business
passengers after the peak season ends for U.S. vacation travel.  The so-called BluePass covers trips from Boston or  Long
Beach ,  California , to certain markets from Aug. 22 through Nov.
22 with no blackout dates, New York-based JetBlue said today in
a statement. Prices range from $1,299 to $1,999 for three
service options based on origination and destination airports.  U.S. leisure travel usually declines after the Labor Day
holiday in September, and domestic airlines have offered similar
promotions in the past. In 2009, JetBlue sold a $599, one-month
unlimited-flight pass for travel across its entire network from
early September through early October.   The period between the Labor Day and Thanksgiving holidays
in the U.S. “is certainly not a peak travel time, so it was an
ideal period to try this out,” said Allison Steinberg, a
JetBlue spokeswoman.  Pass holders may book flights up to 90 minutes before 
departure, JetBlue said.  Chief Executive Officer David Barger told analysts and
investors this week that the company would offer a flat-rate
pass to lure business travelers as the carrier expands
operations in  Boston . JetBlue began service in the Massachusetts
capital in 2004, with 11 departures a day.  “We currently operate approximately 100 daily flights in
Boston and plan to grow to nearly 150 daily flights by 2015,” he
said on a July 26 earnings call. “That’s a similar number of
departures we currently operate” at  New York ’s John F. Kennedy
airport, Barger said.  JetBlue fell 9 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $4.61 at 2:26 p.m.
New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares earlier
dropped to $4.59, the lowest intraday price since July 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
