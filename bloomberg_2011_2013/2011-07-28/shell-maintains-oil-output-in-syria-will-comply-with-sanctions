Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , Europe’s
largest oil company, plans to maintain production in Syria and
will comply with sanctions, according to Chief Executive Officer
 Peter Voser .  The civil unrest in the country hasn’t affected operations,
Voser said today in a Bloomberg Television interview with
Francine Lacqua. “We are watching and monitoring it,” he said.  Shell, China National Petroleum Corp. and Oil & Natural Gas
Corp. of India are partners in Syria’s  Al Furat Petroleum Co .
The partners, which extract about 100,000 barrels of oil a day
through the venture, resumed pumping crude through a pipeline
damaged by fire earlier in July.  The U.S. and European Union imposed sanctions against
Syrian officials earlier this year following the government’s
crackdown on protests against President Bashar al-Assad.  To contact the reporters on this story:
