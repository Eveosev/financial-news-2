SAP AG’s Chief Financial Officer
Werner Brandt said partnership agreements reached in the last
few months will start to pay off in the next few quarters,
according to an interview in  Boersen-Zeitung  today.  Brandt also said that if the U.S. were to halt investments
in software, SAP wouldn’t be hurt in the short term, the
newspaper said. The company gets about a tenth of its worldwide
sales from the governments, Brandt told Boersen-Zeitung.  To contact the reporter on this story: Ragnhild Kjetland in
