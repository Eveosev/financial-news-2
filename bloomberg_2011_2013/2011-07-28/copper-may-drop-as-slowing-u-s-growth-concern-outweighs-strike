Copper gained on the prospects of
tight supplies after  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  declared force majeure at
its Escondida mine, increasing demand for the metal.  The metal for three-month delivery advanced as much as 0.3
percent to $9,812 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange and
traded at $9,793 at 3:12 p.m. Singapore time, after earlier
dropping to $9,750. October-delivery copper on the Shanghai
Futures Exchange closed little changed at 72,750 yuan ($11,287)
a ton.  BHP declared force majeure on shipments from  Chile ’s
Escondida copper mine, the world’s largest, as a strike
stretched into a seventh day with workers threatening to take
control of the site. Force majeure is a legal clause invoked
when companies can’t meet supply obligations because of
circumstances beyond their control.  “The Escondida force majeure news is very important to the
copper market because it represents the downside risk to global
mine output, which has been tight,” Judy Zhu, an analyst at
Standard Chartered Bank in  Shanghai , said today by phone.  The strike is cutting output by about 3,000 tons a day,
according to the worker’s union. Escondida, which declined an
invitation by Chilean labor authorities to attend mediated
talks, is urging workers to return to their posts.  The dispute follows a 24-hour strike at Codelco, Chile’s
state-owned producer, on July 11 and protests by contract
workers at Codelco’s El Teniente last month. Codelco workers
support the Escondida strike, their union said in a statement.  “We are bullish on copper and think prices will rise to
$10,000 a ton later this year and make a new record high,” said
Zhu.  Growth Concern  Copper had earlier dropped amid signs U.S. economic growth
is slowing as the nation struggled to resolve an impasse on
raising its debt ceiling. House Speaker  John Boehner  revised his
plan to lift the ceiling as he gained support among fellow
Republicans for a proposal which Senate Democrats said will not
pass their chamber.  The  Federal Reserve  said in its Beige Book survey yesterday
the  U.S. economy  expanded at a slower pace in more parts of the
country since the beginning of June, with figures due tomorrow
forecast to show growth last quarter was at a 1.8 percent annual
rate, the slowest pace in a year.  Aluminum climbed 0.5 percent to $2,656.50 a ton and lead
advanced 0.6 percent to $2,705, while zinc was little changed at
$2,522 a ton after reaching $2,539.50 yesterday, the highest
price since April 11. Nickel rose 0.5 percent to $24,526 a ton.
Tin increased 0.8 percent to $28,975.  To contact the reporters on this story:
