McGraw-Hill Cos., the publisher and
provider of debt service, said second-quarter profit rose 10
percent on increased demand for credit ratings.  Net income climbed to $211.1 million, or 68 cents a share,
from $191.1 million, or 61 cents, a year earlier, the New York-
based company said today in a statement. That beat the 66-cent
average of analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Demand for ratings buoyed the company’s  Standard & Poor’s 
unit as corporate bond sales from the U.S. to  Europe  to  Asia 
increased 47 percent to $906 billion in the second quarter from
$618 billion a year earlier, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Standard & Poor’s and financial information make up
about 70 percent of McGraw-Hill’s annual operating profit, said
 Peter Appert , an analyst at Piper Jaffray & Co. in San
Francisco.  “Total debt issuance was up quite substantially” in the
quarter, Appert said in an interview before the earnings were
released. That produced “very healthy results in the financial
part of the business.”  Second-quarter revenue rose 7.2 percent to $1.58 billion
from $1.47 billion a year earlier, the company said.  Sales at Standard & Poor’s, the world’s largest bond rater,
advanced 19 percent to $480.3 million.  Moody’s Corp. (MCO) , the
second-largest ratings company, yesterday reported a 27 percent
increase in second-quarter revenue.  McGraw-Hill rose 3 cents in early trading to $43.10. The
shares had climbed 18 percent this year before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
