Workers at six  New York  City-area
H&M stores, owned by a Sweden-based clothing retailer, won a
two-month union-organizing campaign after their employer didn’t
demand a secret-ballot election.  The United Food and Commercial Workers Union will represent
240 sales clerks at H&M stores in Queens,  Brooklyn , West Nyack,
White Plains, Yonkers and  Staten Island , all in New York. They
join about 1,200 New York H&M workers, most based in Manhattan,
already in the UFCW.  H&M, owned by Stockholm-based  Hennes & Mauritz AB (HMB) , the
world’s second-largest clothing retailer, accepted the union’s
bid for representation after workers turned in signup cards.
Companies typically require an election to ratify the petitions,
said UFCW spokesman Evan Yeats. A vote gives employers a chance
to influence the outcome.  “H&M prides itself as an employer who values its
associates and presents a positive work environment,” Jennifer
Ward, a company spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. “H&M has a
tradition of working with unions around the world, and we are
confident that we will continue to build our new relationship
with the UFCW.”  H&M workers wanted to unionize because of dissatisfaction
with the retail industry, not their company, Yeats said. They
want a more stable schedule, better  job security , and better pay
and health care.  “Workers are making retail jobs into good long-term retail
careers,” said Tom Plumb, director of the retail stores
division of the UFCW.  To contact the reporter on this story:
