The European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development and four commercial banks will
lend 68 million euros ($97.2 million) to Belgrade-based
household and beauty products maker Beohemija d.o.o. to expand
output and exports.  The money would be used to help it gain market shares
through southeastern  Europe , the London-based EBRD said in an
e-mailed statement today.  The EBRD will provide 20 million euros of the total, with
the rest provided via subsidiaries of European commercial
banks, including Serbian-based units of  Unicredit SpA (UCG) ,  Societe
Generale (GLE)  SA,  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  and  EFG Eurobank Ergasias SA (EUROB) ,
it said in the statement.  Beohemija produces washing powders and other cleaning
goods, beauty and cosmetics products at four facilities,
including Dahlia, Inhem and Brixol plants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
