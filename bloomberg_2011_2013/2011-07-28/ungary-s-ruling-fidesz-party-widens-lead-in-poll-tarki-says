Hungary’s governing Fidesz party
widened its lead against the opposition Socialist Party this
month, pollster Tarki said.  Support for Fidesz and its Christian Democrat allies rose
to 30 percent among all voters from 27 percent in June, while
the Socialist Party dropped one percentage point to 11 percent,
Tarki said in a survey posted on its  website  yesterday.
Opposition party Jobbik rose to 9 percent from 8 percent and
Lehet Mas a Politika from 3 percent to 5 percent.  Tarki’s survey was based on responses from 1,000 people.  Editors:  Chris Peterson   To contact the reporter on this story:
