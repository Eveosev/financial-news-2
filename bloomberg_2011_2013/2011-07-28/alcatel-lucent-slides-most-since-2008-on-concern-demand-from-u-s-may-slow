Alcatel-Lucent SA plunged the most
in more than two-and-a-half years amid concern spending by U.S.
mobile operators in the second half will slow.  Shares tumbled as much as 58 cents, or 17 percent, in the
biggest intraday decline since Oct. 24, 2008. They traded down
52 cents, or 15 percent, to 2.86 euros as of 2:27 p.m. in Paris.  Comments by Chief Executive Officer Ben Verwaayen on a
conference call in which he expressed confidence in the
company’s U.S. prospects were “very vague,” said  Thomas
Langer , an analyst at WestLB in Duesseldorf.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
