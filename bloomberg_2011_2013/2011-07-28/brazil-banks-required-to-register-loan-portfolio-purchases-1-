Brazilian banks will be required to
report the purchases of some credit portfolios next month in the
wake of the government’s fraud investigation into Banco
Panamericano SA’s booking of such transactions.  The purchase of loan portfolios made up of payroll and auto
loans will need to be registered starting Aug. 22 by the seller
and the buyer of the asset, according to a decision by the
National Monetary Council distributed today in Brasilia. The
monetary council may extend the requirement to other types of
loans, according to the decision.  “This is very good for financial institutions and very
good for the central bank’s oversight” of financial
institutions, Sergio Odilon dos Anjos, head of the financial
system regulation department for the central bank, told
reporters in Brasilia.  An alleged fraud by Sao Paulo-based Banco Panamericano SA
caused the market for loan portfolios to dry up after the auto
lender was bailed out Nov. 9. The Brazilian Federation of Banks,
along with other Brazilian banking associations, said in January
they would work with the central bank to create a registry with
details about loans in order to revive financing by improving
transparency.  To contact the reporters on this story:
