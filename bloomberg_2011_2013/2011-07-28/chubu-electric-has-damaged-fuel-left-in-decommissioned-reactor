Chubu Electric Power Co. said it has
damaged fuel stored for about 17 years in a reactor being
decommissioned at its Hamaoka nuclear plant, southwest of  Tokyo .  The fuel rod, damaged in an accident in December 1994,
remains in the spent-fuel pool for the No. 1 reactor that
stopped operating in 2009, Atsuo Sawaki, a company spokesman,
said by phone from Nagoya. The company kept the fuel there as
was unable to find a special cask to transfer it to reprocessing
facilities, he said.  Chubu Electric plans to move the rod to the spent-fuel pool
for the No. 4 or No. 5 reactor by March 2013 and store it there
temporarily as facilities for No. 1 reactor will be dismantled.  To contact the reporters on this story:
