The European Union said “lone-wolf
terrorism” may need more attention from governments in the wake
of the twin terror attacks in  Norway  last week that killed 76
people.  Anders Behring Breivik has been charged with two counts of
terrorism after the 32-year-old Norwegian citizen set off a car-
bomb in Oslo’s government district before going on a shooting
rampage at a  Labor Party  youth camp on nearby Utoeya island.
Police said they may seek to bring the nation’s first charge of
crimes against humanity against Breivik.  “The issue of ‘lone-wolf terrorism,’ represented by
terrorists that are self-radicalized (e.g. through the Internet)
with no obvious attachment to any terrorist organization, seems
to require increasing attention,” the EU said in a statement
today following a meeting of terrorism experts from the bloc’s
27 nations in Brussels. “The importance of strengthening
response capacity was another issue that was highlighted” at
the meeting, it said.  Breivik, who railed against multiculturalism and Islam in a
1,500-page manifesto posted on the Internet before the attacks,
said he intended to inflict the “greatest possible loss” on
the country’s ruling Labor Party and halt what he called the
“Islamization” of Norway and  Europe .  At today’s meeting in Brussels, “particular attention was
given to the processes of radicalization and recruitment, which
usually depend on a variety of factors independent of the cause
which any terrorist seeks to promote, whether the ideology of
al-Qaeda, the far right or any other extreme ideology,” the EU
said in the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
