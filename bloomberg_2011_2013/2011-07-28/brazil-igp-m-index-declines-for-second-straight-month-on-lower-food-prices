Brazilian wholesale, construction
and consumer prices declined for the second straight month as
food prices continued to fall.  The IGP-M index declined 0.12 percent in July, after
falling 0.18 percent in June, the Rio de Janeiro-based Getulio
Vargas Foundation said.  Economists expected prices to fall 0.14 percent, according
to the median estimate of 29 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Prices rose 8.36 percent from a year ago, the lowest annual
reading since September.  Food prices fell 0.99 percent in July, after falling 0.81
percent in June, helping push consumer prices 0.13 percent lower
in the month. Wholesale prices, which have a 60 percent
weighting in the index, declined 0.22 percent.  Construction prices rose 0.59 percent in July, fueled by a
0.84 percent jump in labor costs as unemployment in  Latin
America â€™s biggest economy remains near a record low.  To contact the reporters on this story:
