The ruble weakened for a second day
versus the dollar as debt concerns in the U.S. and  Europe  hurt
demand for riskier assets.  Russia’s currency depreciated 0.3 percent to 27.6024 per
dollar at the 7 p.m. close in Moscow, the biggest drop since
July 18. The ruble was 0.3 percent stronger at 39.4975 per euro,
leaving it steady at 32.9552 against the central bank’s target
dollar-euro basket.  Emerging-market currencies declined as concern mounted that
U.S. lawmakers will fail to agree on the federal government’s
debt ceiling by next week’s deadline. Standard & Poor’s cut
 Greece ’s credit rating, saying it will partially default once a
European-Union bailout is implemented.  Oil traded below $98 a barrel for a second day after a U.S.
Energy Department report showed the country’s crude stockpiles
climbed 2.3 million barrels last week, while a Bloomberg News
survey forecast a drop of 2 million barrels. Crude for September
delivery slid as much as 0.9 percent to $96.51 a barrel.  “With  oil prices  moderating, the Russian bourses will
struggle to make much headway,” Johannesburg-based Tradition
Analytics wrote in an e-mailed note to clients.  Russian  government bonds  rose, pushing the yield on the
ruble Eurobond due in 2018 down one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 6.847 percent. Non-deliverable forwards,
which provide a guide to expectations of currency movements and
allow companies to hedge against them, show the ruble at 27.8625
per dollar in three months, compared with 27.816 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
