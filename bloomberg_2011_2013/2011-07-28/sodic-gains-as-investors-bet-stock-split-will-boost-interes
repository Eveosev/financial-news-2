Six of October Development &
Investment (OCDI)  Co.,  Egypt ’s third-biggest property developer, rose
the most in more than two weeks after a five-for-two stock split
went into effect today.  The shares of the Cairo-based company jumped as much 4.1
percent, the most since July 13, before trading 1.5 percent
higher at 23 Egyptian pounds at 1:41 p.m. in Cairo. That gave
the company a market value of 2.1 billion pounds ($353 million).
The benchmark EGX30 Index declined 0.4 percent.  “Investors are hoping the split will create more interest
in the name,” said Omar Darwish, equity sales trader at Cairo-
based Commercial International Brokerage Co.  The company said in December the split was aimed at making
the shares more accessible for small investors and to boost
liquidity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
