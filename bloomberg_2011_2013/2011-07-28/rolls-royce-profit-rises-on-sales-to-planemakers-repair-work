Rolls-Royce Group Plc (RR/) , the world’s
second-largest aircraft-engine maker, said first-half profit
rose as civilian plane manufacturers bought more powering
systems and the company provided more repairs.  Adjusted net income, excluding revaluation of currency
hedging contracts, increased to 442 million pounds ($722
million) from 349 million pounds a year earlier, the London-
based company said in a statement today. Analysts had predicted
profit of 375 million pounds. The company’s first-half dividend
rose 8 percent to 6.9 pence a share.  Demand for engines has been sustained as Airbus SAS and
 Boeing Co. (BA) , the world’s two largest makers of commercial
aircraft, work through order backlogs. Chicago-based Boeing is
scheduled in September to deliver its first 787 Dreamliner
model, a plane powered by Rolls-Royce’s Trent 1000 engine.
Repair work has increased as airlines restored planes to service
following an increase in traffic.  “Performance in the first half of the year was strong with
our order book and underlying profit showing solid growth,
enabling an increased payment to shareholders,” Chief Executive
Officer John Rishton, who took over this year, said in the
statement. “This demonstrates the resilience of our strategy
that is based on a diverse portfolio and access to global
markets.”  Rolls-Royce gained as much as 12.5 pence, or 2 percent, to
654 pence, and traded at 642 pence as of 8:21 a.m. in  London .  Rolls-Royce’s Trent 900 model is used on Airbus’s double-
decker A380 plane and an engine dubbed the Trent XWB will be the
exclusive powerplant for Airbus’s planned A350, which is due to
enter service in 2013. The company aims to more than double
engine production by the middle of the decade.  A Trent 900 exploded in November on a Qantas Airlines Ltd.
A380, leading to an emergency landing of the plane in  Singapore .
Rolls-Royce said in June after a settlement with Qantas over
A380 fleet disruptions that its total costs from the incident
amounted to 56 million pounds in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
