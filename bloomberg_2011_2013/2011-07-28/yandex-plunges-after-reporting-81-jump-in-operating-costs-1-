Yandex NV, operator of the most
popular Russian search engine, sank the most since its initial
public offering in May after reporting its second-quarter costs
surged 81 percent.  The stock plunged as much as 15 percent before paring
losses to 6.5 percent at $36.01 at 11:15 a.m. in  New York .  The Moscow-based company sold 52.2 million shares, or a
16.2 percent stake, at $25 a share on the Nasdaq Stock Market on
May 24.  The company said net income rose 11 percent to 1.13 billion
rubles ($41 million) in the second quarter, while operating
costs jumped 81 percent to 3.16 billion rubles.  “The results were not good with costs outpacing
revenues,” Marco Casas, a New York-based vice-president of
equity sales at Otkritie Capital, said in emailed comments.
“This was mainly because of higher labor costs and traffic
acquisition.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
