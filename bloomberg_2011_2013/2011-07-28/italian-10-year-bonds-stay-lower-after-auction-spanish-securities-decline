Italian 10-year bonds stayed lower
after the nation sold almost 8 billion euros ($11.5 billion) of
government bonds and notes.  The 10-year yield rose eight basis points to 5.84 percent
as of 10:34 a.m. in  London . The yield on similar-maturity
Spanish securities was three basis points higher at 6.01
percent.  Italy sold 2.7 billion euros of its 10-year benchmark bond,
less than the maximum target of 3 billion euros. The debt was
priced to yield 5.77 percent, which compares with 4.94 percent
the last time the securities were sold on June 28. Demand was
1.38 times the amount sold, compared with 1.33 at last monthâ€™s
auction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
