The U.S. Northeast may cool down in
the second week of August, although there isnâ€™t any relief in
sight for the heat that has gripped the center of the country,
said  Matt Rogers , president of  Commodity Weather Group LLC .  In his 11- to 15-day forecast for Aug. 7 to Aug. 11, Rogers
said the Northeast will have seasonal or cooler-than-normal
weather. The Great Plains to the South will broil under warmer-
than-normal conditions until Aug. 11.  Natural gas traders monitor weather forecasts to determine
if temperatures may boost heating or cooling needs. Excessive
heat warnings and advisories remain in place from northern  Texas 
to Indiana, according to the  National Weather Service .  The temperature reached 107 yesterday in  Fort Smith ,
Arkansas, a new daily record. It was the 23rd day in a row of
100-degree heat or more, besting the old record of 17
consecutive days set in July 1934, the weather service said.  Rogers, based in Bethesda,  Maryland , said that while the
heat in the center of the country may expand and contract
through the second week in August, he expects it to remain
firmly in place.  To contact the reporter on this story:
