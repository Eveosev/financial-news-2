(Corrects headline to say state-owned bank sells.)  Poland’s zloty extended its gains,
appreciating the most in more than a week versus the euro, amid
speculation the government is in the market buying the currency.  The Polish currency strengthened as much as 0.7 percent,
the most since July 20 on an intraday basis, and traded up 0.5
percent at 4.0065 per euro as of 4:55 p.m. in Warsaw.  State-owned Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego sold euros for
zloty today, according to two people involved in the  currency
market  who couldn’t be named because the information is private.
The government is selling all the euros it receives from the
European Union on the currency market, Finance Minister Jacek Rostowski told the Money.pl financial website on July 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
