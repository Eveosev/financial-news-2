The Philippine peso retreated from a
three-year high as a technical gauge used by traders signaled
the dollar will rebound.  The peso’s 14-day relative strength index to the dollar
fell below the 30 threshold, suggesting this month’s 2.7 percent
rally is close to ending. The Southeast Asian currency halted a
two-day gain as Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas left borrowing costs
unchanged today, while ordering lenders to set aside more cash
as reserves. In the U.S., Republicans and Democrats continued to
disagree on how to tackle the nation’s debt yesterday as an Aug.
2 deadline to raise the borrowing ceiling looms.  “The dollar is oversold and I think there’s room for it to
appreciate and for the peso to weaken,” said Ricky Cebrero, a
treasurer at  Philippine National Bank  in Manila. “As the Aug. 2
deadline nears for the U.S., I think the market will come to a
consensus that something will be agreed upon to avert
disruptions.”  The peso fell 0.1 percent to 42.160 per dollar as of the 4
p.m. close in Manila, according to data from Tullett Prebon Plc.
It touched 42.085 yesterday, its strongest level since April
2008.  Fifteen of 18 economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast the
central bank would leave its benchmark  interest rate  at 4.50
percent, with three predicting a quarter of a percentage point
lift. The monetary authority increased lenders’ reserve-
requirement ratios to 21 percent from 20 percent, effective Aug.
5, it said in a statement in  Manila  today.  The yield on the 9.125 percent bonds due September 2016
rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 5.00 percent,
according to Tradition Financial Services.  To contact the reporter for this story:
