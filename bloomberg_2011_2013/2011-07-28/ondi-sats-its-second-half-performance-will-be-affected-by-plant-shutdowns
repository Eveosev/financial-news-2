Mondi Group,  Europe ’s largest maker
of office paper, said maintenance shutdowns at some “large and
strongly profitable” mills in the region and slowing demand
will hold back second-half earnings.  As the economic outlook weakens, the market in the second
half will be probably be “softer” after sales of paper
products increased in the first six months of the year,
Johannesburg-based Mondi said in a statement today.  A European Commission measure of corporate executive and
consumer sentiment in euro countries released today dropped more
than economists had forecast. Mondi reiterated previous plans to
suspend operations at three plants in Europe in the second half
of 2011 to perform equipment repairs.  “Paper companies are quite a good barometer of the global
economic outlook,” Nick Kunze, head of trading at Barnard
Jacobs Mellet Private Clients in Johannesburg, said in a
telephone interview today.  Mondi fell as much as 1.9 percent to 54.35 rand and was
down 1.4 percent as of 2:50 p.m. in Johannesburg trading, paring
its gain this year to 32 percent. Shares of South African
competitor  Sappi Ltd. (SAP) , the world’s largest maker of glossy
paper, have dropped 10 percent in 2011 and are trading at about
a 13-month low.  First-half net income at Mondi surged 88 percent to 254
million euros ($363 million) while operating profit from
continuing operations jumped 74 percent to 354 million euros.
The manufacturer plans to more than double the dividend for the
period to 8.25 euro cents a share from 3.5 cents a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
