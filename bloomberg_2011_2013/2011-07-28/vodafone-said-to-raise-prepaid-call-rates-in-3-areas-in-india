Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) ’s Indian unit,
the nation’s third-largest mobile phone company by subscribers,
raised call rates by 20 percent in Delhi and other regions to
boost profit margins, a person familiar with the matter said.  The increases for customers, who pay before using the
services, in three of  India ’s 22 telecommunications zones --
Delhi, Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh -- are effective this month,
said the person who declined to be identified because he isn’t
authorized to speak publicly on the matter.  Vodafone Essar Ltd. joins  Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI) , India’s
biggest mobile-phone service provider, in raising call rates in
a signal that a two-year price war in the world’s second largest
market for mobile services is coming to an end. Mobile-phone
operators cut rates to less than one U.S. cent per second to
compete with low priced plans introduced when  Telenor ASA (TEL)  and
NTT DoCoMo Inc. entered India.  “You are now starting to see all players in all areas
starting to selectively put up pricing,” Nick Read, Vodafone’s
regional chief executive officer in charge of the Asia Pacific,
 Africa  and Middle East region, said in a July 22 call with
analysts. “We have done that in a number of areas as well,
especially on our per-second billing. And we continue to monitor
and review the situation.”  Fifteen mobile-phone operators compete in a market that
researcher Gartner Inc. has estimated will exceed 993 million
users by the end of 2014.  India had 840 million mobile phone accounts at the end of
May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
