Belgian inflation accelerated to the
fastest in 33 months in July, boosted by the cost of vacations
and hotel rooms.  The inflation rate in  Belgium , the sixth-largest economy in
the euro region, increased to 3.8 percent, compared with 3.7
percent in June, the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Brussels
said today in an e-mailed statement. That’s the highest since
October 2008.  Energy costs declined in July, with motor-fuel prices
falling 0.6 percent, the ministry said. Excluding energy,
inflation quickened to 1.92 percent this month from 1.88 percent
in June, according to today’s report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
