German 10-year bonds rose for a
fifth day before an Italian debt sale and after  Standard &
Poor’s  said  Greece  risks further defaults after the
restructuring agreed upon at a summit last week.  German yields were the lowest in five months compared with
similar-maturity  U.S. debt  as lawmakers pushed conflicting plans
to raise the nation’s debt ceiling. S&P also said lower
borrowing costs for Ireland and Portugal may boost their debt
sustainability. Italian bonds declined for a second day before
an auction of up to 8.5 billion euros ($12.2 billion) of bonds
due 2014, 2015, 2018 and 2021.  “Following the knee-jerk relief reaction to last week’s EU
summit outcome, lingering contagion risks appear to be at the
forefront of the market’s concerns with Italian and Spanish
spreads now heading back towards their recent highs,” said  John Davies , a fixed-income strategist at WestLB AG in  London . “Any
signs of weak demand for the Italian bond taps today will
underpin the safe-haven bid for bunds.”  Ten-year bund yields fell three basis points to 2.63
percent as of 8:09 a.m. in London. They touched 2.62 percent on
July 18, the lowest since July 12. The 3.25 percent security
maturing in July 2021 climbed 0.23, or 2.3 euros per 1,000-euro
face amount, to 105.38.  The difference in yield, or spread, with 10-year Treasuries
was at 35 basis points. Yields on two-year German notes declined
two basis points to 1.24 percent.  European Confidence  A report today may show European confidence in the economic
outlook dropped to the lowest since September, according to the
median of 24 estimates in a Bloomberg survey before the data.  German unemployment figures may flag disparity among the
euro-member economies. Expected to show the jobless rate held at
7 percent, the lowest since records for a reunified  Germany 
began in 1991, the data come a day after  France  reported number
of job seekers climbed for a second month in June.  Italian and Spanish 10-year bonds fell, increasing the
yield spread over benchmark bunds. The yield on 10-year Italian
securities rose six basis points to 5.82 percent. That pushed
the difference in yield, or spread, to 10-year German bonds nine
basis points wider to 319, the most since July 19.  Spain ’s 10-year bond yield was five basis points higher at
6.02 percent, 339 basis points more than the equivalent-maturity
German securities.  Greek and Irish 10-year bonds were little changed, with
yields at 14.73 percent and 11.19 percent respectively.  German  government bonds  handed investors 2.3 percent this
year, compared with 3.4 percent for U.S. Treasuries, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Greek bonds have lost 10 percent,
while Portugal’s declined 22 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
