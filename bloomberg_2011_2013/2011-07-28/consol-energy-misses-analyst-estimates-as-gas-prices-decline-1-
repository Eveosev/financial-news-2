Consol Energy Inc. (CNX) , an Appalachian
coal and natural-gas producer, boosted its outlook for 2012 coal
shipments after reporting profit rose 16 percent on higher
demand.  Net income climbed to $77.4 million, or 34 cents a share,
from $66.7 million, or 29 cents, a year earlier, Pittsburgh-
based Consol said today. The company was forecast to earn 72
cents, according to the mean of 10 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales rose 23 percent to $1.59 billion.  Consol, led by J. Brett Harvey, boosted its production
forecast by 1 million tons to between 60.5 million and 62.5
million tons to capitalize on export demand for both thermal and
metallurgical varieties of the fuel.  “Inventories are getting tight in the U.S., there’s export
demand,” said Meredith Bandy, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets
in Denver. “You have positive news in growing products, a
better product.”  Consol rose 56 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $53.47 in  New York 
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have gained 38
percent in the past year.  The company recorded a $115.5 million writedown to shutter
its Mine 84 operation near  Washington ,  Pennsylvania . Absent the
expense, on an adjusted basis, net income was $174 million, or
76 cents a share.  “That’s a one-time occurrence,” said  Jeremy Sussman , an
analyst at Brean Murray Carret & Co. in New York. “Consol is
growing their metallurgical coal both for the high quality and
lower quality and that’s a good thing.”  Coal Reserves  The company decided not to sell its Amonate reserve, which
contains about 240 million tons of metallurgical coal, in
southern  West Virginia  amid growing global demand. Consol had
explored selling the reserves in November.  “To accommodate future growth, we are expanding our
terminal, we are developing the BMX Mine in the Pittsburgh seam,
and we are restarting our Amonate Mining complex,” Harvey said
in the statement. “All three of these coal projects are driven
by increased worldwide coal demand.”  Consol, which owns an export terminal in Baltimore, plans
to ship 2.3 million tons of coal to  Europe  this year.  It lifted 2011 production guidance this month after selling
15.4 million tons of the fuel, surpassing the previous estimate
of as little as 14.75 million. Benchmark prices for coking coal,
used to make steel, surged 65 percent to a record $330 a ton
from a year earlier amid global supply disruptions.  Rising Costs  Consol said its cost per ton will rise $1 for both the
third and fourth quarters.  “Costs are going up, but so is pricing,” Bandy said.
“Demand is good. Consol has low-cost mines, so it doesn’t crush
them like it may someone else.”  Consol received $207.05 a ton for its low-volatility
metallurgical coal, used by steelmakers, up 37 percent from a
year earlier, it said. Low-volatility coal has fewer impurities
than the higher-volatility and can withstand higher levels of
heat during the process of forging steel.  Utilities in Consol’s region have seen inventories dwindle
as much as 13 million tons or eight to 10 days less than a year
ago, company executives said on a conference call with analysts
and investors today.  Consol bought Dominion Resources Inc.’s gas exploration and
production business last year for $3.48 billion and spent an
additional $963 million to buy the 16.7 percent of CNX Gas Corp.
that it didn’t already own.  The gas division produced 37.5 billion cubic feet of the
fuel, up 18 percent from a year earlier, it said in the July 14
statement. It plans to produce between 150 billion cubic feet
and 160 billion cubic feet this year.  Consol drills in the Marcellus and Utica  shale  deposits
where the gas is locked in non-porous rock that made the
reserves inaccessible until new drilling technologies were
developed in the 1990s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
