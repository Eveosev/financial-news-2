U.S. stock-index futures erased
gains as  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  slumped after its earnings trailed
analysts’ estimates and investor attention remained fixated on
 Washington  before a House vote on the debt ceiling.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed at 1,298.7 at 8:04 a.m. in  New York . Dow Jones
Industrial Average futures retreated 1 point, or less than 0.1
percent, to 12,243 after climbing 0.5 percent earlier. Exxon
Mobil slipped 1.4 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
