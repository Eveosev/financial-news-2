The first sale of five-year bonds in
 Ghana , the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer, since 2007 was
oversubscribed as investors demanded more debt than was offered,
said Adams Nyinaku, head of treasury at the  Bank of Ghana .  The bank offered 300 million cedis ($199 million) and sold
301 million cedis after buyers sought 448 million cedis, Nyinaku
said by phone from Accra, the capital. The yield was 14.25
percent, he said.  “Our economy has stabilized for some time now, and this is
attractive to investors,” Nyinaku said.  West Africa’s second-biggest economy expanded at an annual
rate of 23 percent in the first quarter of the year. The local
currency, the cedi, has gained 3.5 percent against the  U.S.
dollar  since it fell to the lowest in 17 years in February.
Investors who were eager to buy the bonds led the cedi to three
days of gains out of four this week. It weakened less than 0.1
percent to 1.5086 by 5:47 p.m. in Accra.  Ghana’s last five-year bond, sold in June 2007, has a yield
of 13.67 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. An
issue that will mature in December yields 14.47 percent and
another bond due in December 2012 is 15 percent.  Ghana will sell 200 million cedis more five-year bonds in
December, the central bank said in an issuance calendar on its
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
