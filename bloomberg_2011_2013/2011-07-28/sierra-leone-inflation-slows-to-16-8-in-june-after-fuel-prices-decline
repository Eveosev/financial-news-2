Sierra Leone ’s inflation rate fell
in June, the first decline in five months, as prices for fuel
eased in the West African nation, according to Statistics Sierra
Leone.  Prices rose 16.8 percent compared with 17.8 percent in May,
Samuel Turay, head of the consumer-price division at the
Freetown-based agency, said in an e-mailed statement today.
Prices rose 0.5 percent in the month, compared with 2.3 percent
in May, he said.  Prices of gas, diesel and kerosene declined 8.9 percent in
June and lowered transportation rates, the agency said. Fuel
costs are regulated by the Bank of Sierra Leone’s petroleum
unit.  Inflation in Sierra Leone had accelerated each month since
January, when it declined to 13.5 percent from 17.8 percent in
December, according to the agency’s  website . The country’s
currency, the leone, weakened 4.2 percent against the  U.S.
dollar  this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
traded at 4,376 leones per dollar by 12:22 p.m. in Freetown,
unchanged from yesterday’s close.  To contact the reporter on this story:
