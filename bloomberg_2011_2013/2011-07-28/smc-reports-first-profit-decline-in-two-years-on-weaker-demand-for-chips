Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Co., the world’s largest contract manufacturer of chips, posted
its first profit decline in almost two years and cut its
expansion plan after  Europe ’s debt crisis forced clients to
scale back orders.  Second-quarter net income fell 11 percent to NT$36 billion
($1.3 billion) from NT$40.3 billion a year earlier, the Hsinchu,
Taiwan-based company said in a statement today. The average of
15 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg was for profit of
NT$36.4 billion.  Slowing demand for computers and concerns about Europe’s
debt are forcing clients including  Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM)  to cut their
sales expectations. TSMC,  Asia ’s second-largest buyer of chip-
making equipment, cut its forecast for capacity expansion this
year, citing “the weakened economic condition,” the statement
said.  “Customers are being cautious because they’re taking a
macro view which indicates the global economic recovery may not
be as strong as expected,” Taipei-based Macquarie Group Ltd.
analyst Michael Liu, who cut his 2011 earnings forecast for TSMC
by 15 percent, said before today’s announcement. “PC orders
have been weak, while smartphone demand won’t be enough to make
up for the wider slowdown.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
