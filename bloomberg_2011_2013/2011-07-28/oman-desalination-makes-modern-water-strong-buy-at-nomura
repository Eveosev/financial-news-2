Modern Water Plc (MWG) , a British
developer of desalination technology, was rated a “strong buy”
by Nomura Code Securities analysts, who said the company has
proved its forward osmosis method is commercially viable.  Ken Rumph, an analyst at Nomura, said the Guildford-based
company with a market value of 22 million pounds ($35 million)
is well financed and undervalued at the current price of 38.5
pence per share. His target price is 180 pence.  Modern Water opened a 500,000 pound ($800,000) commercial
desalination plant in  Oman  last month, the world’s first to use
forward osmosis technology, which is 30 percent cheaper than
conventional reverse osmosis, according to the company. The
 Middle East  will be spend more than $50 billion a year on water
treatment by 2016 compared with $30 billion in 2009, according
to Global Water Intelligence, an industry analyst.  “The potential market is huge and they’ve proven that it
works on a commercial basis,” Rumph said by phone today. “They
have plenty of cash on the balance sheet and they’ve got a
better product than everybody else.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
