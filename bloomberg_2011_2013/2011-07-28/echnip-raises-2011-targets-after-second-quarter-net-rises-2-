Technip SA (TEC) ,  Europe ’s second-largest
oilfield-services provider, raised full-year targets after
reporting a 25 percent increase in second-quarter profit.  Net income rose to 132.5 million euros ($190.2 million)
from 106.1 million euros a year earlier, the Paris-based company
said today in a statement. That compared with an average
estimate of 108.6 million euros from nine analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Sales gained 12 percent to 1.66 billion euros and the
company raised 2011 targets for subsea and operating margins.  “It’s a pretty solid, robust performance,” Mick Pickup,
an analyst at  Barclays Capital , said today by telephone.  Technip rose as much as 3.8 percent and was 2.20 euros
higher at 76.03 euros at 10:45 a.m. in Paris. The shares have
risen about 10 percent since the start of the year.  Technip, whose largest competitor in Europe is  Italy ’s
 Saipem SpA (SPM) , has said the market for flexible pipelines for
offshore oil exploration and production is growing at a faster-
than-expected pace. Saipem yesterday reported a drop in new
orders in the latest quarter.  “A high and fairly stable oil price combined with an
increasing demand for gas is driving upstream investments,”
Technip said in the statement. Economic and political
uncertainties are affecting the schedules of some projects,
mostly those needing financing.  Order Backlog  Technip had an order backlog of 9.41 billion euros at the
end of June, compared with 9.08 billion euros at the end of
March and 8.26 billion euros a year earlier. Second-quarter
order intake was 2.09 billion euros compared with 1.52 billion
euros the previous year.  The subsea operating margin was 17 percent in the second
quarter compared with 16.9 percent a year earlier while the
combined onshore/offshore margin was 7.6 percent compared with
7.1 percent.  The company kept targets for group revenue of 6.5 billion
to 6.7 billion euros in 2011 and raised one for a subsea
operating margin of between 16.5 percent and 17 percent compared
with the previous one for above 15 percent. It’s also now
seeking an onshore/offshore margin of 6.5 percent to 7 percent
compared with 6 percent to 6.5 percent previously, with revenue
from that division unchanged at 2.6 billion to 2.7 billion
euros.  Technip announced contracts in  China , the  North Sea  and
 Vietnam  in the last two months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
