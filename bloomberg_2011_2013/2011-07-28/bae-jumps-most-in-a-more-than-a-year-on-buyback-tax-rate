BAE Systems Plc,  Europe ’s largest
defense company, advanced the most in a year in London trading
after announcing a 500 million-pound ($816 million) share
buyback as well as a lower  tax rate .  BAE rose as much as 5.3 percent to 308 pence, the steepest
gain since February 2010. The stock traded at 307.5 pence as of
9:39 a.m., giving the London-based company a market value of
10.51 billion pound.  The share repurchase will boost adjusted earnings per share
by about 5 percent, JP Morgan analyst John Middleton said in a
note. BAE reiterated earnings per share for the year will be
“broadly” similar to 2010. A charge related to an Omani
patrol-ship contract and foreign exchange movements were offset
by a one-off gain from a Ministry of Defence settlement.  BAE is seeking foreign contracts to counter budget
constraints in the U.K. and U.S., and is expanding into new
areas including cybersecurity. The defense company is targeting
defense budgets in nations such as  India .  The company continues to anticipate a reduction in sales in
2011. First-half earnings before interest, taxes and
amortization, excluding one-time items, fell to 968 million
pounds from 1.1 billion pounds. Analysts had predicted 843.5
million pounds.BAE booked a surprise gain of 125 million pounds.  Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s government announced an 8
percent cut in defense spending over four years in October. It
also scrapped an order for BAE Systems Plc’s Nimrod
reconnaissance aircraft, cut the number of Challenger II tanks
and opted for fewer, cheaper planes for two new aircraft
carriers, one of which may be sold after completion.  In the U.S., President  Barack Obama  in April announced $400
billion of cuts in national security spending through 2023, in
addition to the $78 billion five-year reduction in the  defense
budget  proposed in January. Budget negotiations between Obama
and Congress may lead to deeper cuts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
