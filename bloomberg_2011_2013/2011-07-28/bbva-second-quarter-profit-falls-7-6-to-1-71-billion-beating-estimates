Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) ,
Spain’s second-largest bank, reported quarterly profit that beat
analyst estimates after a Turkish investment partly offset a
slump in earnings in its home market.  Net income fell to 1.19 billion euros ($1.7 billion) in the
three months to June 30, from 1.29 billion euros a year earlier,
the Bilbao, Spain-based lender said in a filing to regulators
today. That exceeded the 1.09 billion-euro average estimate of
13 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Earnings from Spain, where the bank has about 60 percent of
its lending, plunged 36 percent amid the country’s property
crash. That was partly countered by higher profit from  Mexico 
and the bank’s investment in Turkey. Newly defaulted loans
totaled 3.7 billion euros in the quarter, BBVA said.  “It looks like a reasonable set of results and they’re
still generating capital,” said Daragh Quinn, an analyst at
Nomura International in  Madrid , who has a reduce rating on BBVA
stock. The big increase in new defaults “shows the scale of the
challenge they still face in managing asset quality,” he said.  BBVA rose 1.7 percent to 7.37 euros in Madrid trading,
paring this year’s decline to 2.5 percent. The 46-company
Bloomberg  Europe  Banks and Financial Services Index has dropped
12 percent while larger Spanish rival  Banco Santander SA (SAN) , which
yesterday reported a 38 percent decline in second-quarter
profit, fell 7.1 percent over the same period.  Bad Loans  Bad loans as a proportion of BBVA’s total lending fell to 4
percent from 4.1 percent in March and 4.2 percent a year ago,
the bank said. Impairment costs dropped 28 percent to 962
million euros.  Entries into default rose from 2.8 billion euros in the
first quarter, while the net amount after recoveries climbed by
a third to 1.23 billion euros. The bank wrote off 939 million
euros of assets, compared with 1.14 billion in the first
quarter. BBVA chose to classify 450 million euros of Spanish
 mortgage loans  as in default, even though they’re still being
paid off, President and Chief Operating Officer Angel Cano said
on a webcast for analysts today.  Core capital, a measure of financial strength, was 9
percent compared with 8.9 percent in March.  Profit from  Spain  plunged to 419 million euros from 651
million euros a year earlier. Net lending in the country rose
2.8 percent from a year ago, BBVA said.  Borrowing costs have soared because of investor doubts
about Spanish government finances.  Mexican Boost  Net interest income in Spain fell to 1.1 billion euros from
1.25 billion euros a year earlier and stabilized compared with
the first quarter, BBVA said. The bank’s bad-loans ratio in
Spain was 4.7 percent, down from 4.8 percent in March and 4.9
percent a year ago.  Earnings from Mexico, where BBVA owns the biggest bank,
rose 4.1 percent to 455 million euros, the lender said.  Profit from Eurasia, a unit including BBVA’s businesses in
 Turkey  and  China  and its operations in Europe outside Spain,
jumped 71 percent to 251 million euros. That included the first
full-quarter contribution from the bank’s 24.9 percent stake in
Turkiye Garanti Bankasi.  Profit from the U.S., a franchise built on BBVA’s $9
billion acquisition of Compass Bancshares Inc. in 2007, fell to
72 million euros from 79 million euros a year earlier.  To contact the reporter for this story:
