The world’s 7-billionth person will
be born Oct. 31 in  India , according to a projection by
researchers working with data from the  United Nations .  Medical advances, more effective vaccines, antibiotics and
improvements in public-health conditions has boosted life
expectancy in  developing countries , where most of the population
growth is taking place, according to the UN  data  reported
tomorrow in the journal  Science .  The number of people globally reached 1 billion in 1800,
then 2 billion in 1925, the report said. Within the last half
century, the population boomed to just under 7 billion from 3
billion. By 2050, the population will reach 9.3 billion, and 97
percent of the growth will be in less developed regions, said
 David Bloom , an economist at  Harvard University  in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, who wrote the report.  “In the 1960s and 1970s, people expected a population
bomb,” Bloom said in a telephone interview. “Now, we have
mini-bombs going off in the most fragile parts of the world.
Issues of inequality and poverty may spill over from less-
developed countries, which will not be good for their neighbors
or the rest of the world.”  Since 1970, population growth has slowed to 1 percent per
year from a little over 2 percent, according to the U.N. date.
Still that means that by 2050, India will overtake  China  as the
most populous country in the world, and the U.S. will be the
only developed nation among the ten most populated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
