Travelers Cos., the lone insurer in
the Dow Jones Industrial Average, was upgraded by  Standard &
Poor’s  on the prospect the company will post better results than
competitors.  The  credit rating  was lifted to A from A- on the prospect
that Travelers will “continue to outperform the industry
average and its peer group beyond 2011, with better underwriting
margins,” the ratings firm said today in a statement on the New
York-based insurer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
