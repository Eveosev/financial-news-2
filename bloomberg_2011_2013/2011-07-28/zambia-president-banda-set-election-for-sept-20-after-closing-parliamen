(Corrects election to be held within 90 days of parliament
closing in second paragraph.)  Zambia,  Africa ’s biggest copper
producer, will hold a general election on Sept. 20 after
President Rupiah Banda dissolved parliament and the Cabinet with
immediate effect.  The vote must be held within 90 days of parliament closing,
Banda said in a speech televised live by Zambian National
Broadcasting Corp. from the capital, Lusaka, today.  “Only the vice president and myself shall remain in office
to execute executive powers,” he said. “I remain head of state
and commander-in-chief until elections are held.”  Banda, the 74-year-old leader of the Movement for
Multiparty Democracy, will compete for the presidency for the
second time against Michael Sata, head of the Patriotic Front,
the southern African nation’s largest opposition party. Sata
narrowly lost in the previous ballot in 2008, winning 38.1
percent of the vote to 40.1 percent for Banda. Zambia’s economy
has expanded an average of more than 6 percent a year since
Banda became president in 2008 when his predecessor Levy Mwanawasa died in office as companies, including  Vedanta
Resources Plc (VED)  and  Vale SA (VALE3) , boost copper output.  The government will invite foreign observers to ensure the
election is free and fair, Banda said.  Zambia’s kwacha weakened 0.2 percent to 4,805 against the
dollar by 12:30 p.m. in Lusaka.  To contact the reporter on this story:
