Italian bonds fell for a second day,
increasing the yield spread over German bunds, after the
nation’s borrowing costs rose at a sale of 10-year debt and
 Standard & Poor’s  said  Greece  risks further defaults.  Italy’s 10-year yield surged to the most in more than a
week amid speculation a probe into a former aide of Finance
Minister  Giulio Tremonti  may force him to step down. German
yields fell to a five-month low versus their U.S. counterparts
as American lawmakers pushed conflicting plans to raise the
nation’s debt ceiling. S&P also said lower borrowing costs for
Ireland and Portugal may boost their debt sustainability.  “The negative picture developed after the auction and we
see spreads widening,” said Norbert Aul, a European rates
strategist at  RBC Capital Markets  in  London . “The auction
looked good. The problem is the fragility in the market.
Tremonti basically personifies investor confidence.”  Italian 10-year bond yields rose 21 basis points to 5.97
percent as of 1:14 p.m. in London. The 4.75 percent security due
September 2021 fell 1.435, or 14.35 euros per 1,000-euro face
amount, to 91.495. That pushed the difference in yield, or
spread, to 10-year German bonds 26 basis points wider to 337,
the most since July 18.  Ten-year bund yields slipped five basis points to 2.61
percent, pushing the difference in yield, or spread, with 10-
year Treasuries to 36 basis points, the most since Feb. 21.  Italian Auction, Tremonti  Italy  sold 2.7 billion euros of its 10-year benchmark
security, less than the maximum target of 3 billion euros. The
debt was priced to yield 5.77 percent, higher than 4.94 percent
the last time the securities were sold on June 28, and drew bids
for 1.38 times the securities on offer, compared with 1.33
times. In six sales of 10-year bonds this year, the average bid-
to-cover ratio was 1.42 and the average yield was 4.81 percent.  Italy also sold 3.5 billion euros of new notes maturing in
July 2014, as well as floating-rate debt due in 2015 and 2018.  Umberto Bossi , the leader of Italy’s Northern League party
and a key ally of Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi , said
Tremonti shouldn’t resign, Ansa news agency reported, citing
comments by Bossi after a Cabinet meeting.  “There’s talk of Tremonti resigning, that’s weighed on
Italian bonds,” said  Ciaran O’Hagan , head of European interest-
rate strategy at Societe Generale SA in Paris. The speculation
and resultant widening of yield spreads is “a reflection of
wider malaise concerning sovereigns,” he said.  Swap Spread  No one at the  Finance Ministry  in Rome was immediately
available to comment on speculation that Tremonti, who is not
under investigation, may resign. His former spokeswoman, Manuela
Bravi, left her post this month and has yet to be replaced.  European financial stocks declined. Credit Suisse Group AG,
the second-biggest Swiss bank, fell after it missed earnings
estimates, helping to drag the Stoxx 600 Banks Index down 0.1
percent. The Zurich-based bank slumped 2.7 percent after it
reported net income dropped to 768 million Swiss francs ($956
million) from 1.59 billion francs in the year-earlier period.  The 10-year euro swap spread, which shows the difference
between the 10-year swap rate and the yield on benchmark German
bunds, used as a measure of perceived risk, rose to 53 basis
points, the most since January 2009.  “The swap spread is being driven by bank risk and by safe-
haven flows into bunds,” said  Kornelius Purps , a fixed-income
strategist at UniCredit SpA in Munich.  German  government bonds  handed investors 2.3 percent this
year, compared with 3.4 percent for U.S. Treasuries, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Greek bonds have lost 10 percent,
while  Portugal ’s declined 22 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
