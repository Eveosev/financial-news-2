U.S. stocks pared gains as lawmakers
indicated they were no closer to reaching an agreement to
increase the debt ceiling, pushing the federal government closer
to default.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.2 percent to
1,307.71 at 2:31 p.m. in New York after rallying as much as 0.9
percent earlier. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  retreated 6.32
points, or 0.1 percent, to 12,296.23, erasing an 82 point
advance.  Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid  said he will move tonight
to kill House Speaker John Boehner’s debt-ceiling proposal.
Provided the House passes the measure later today, Reid said he
plans to bring Boehner’s legislation immediately to the floor
and “it will be defeated.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
