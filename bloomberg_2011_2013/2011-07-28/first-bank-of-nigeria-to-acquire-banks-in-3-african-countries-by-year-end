First Bank Plc,  Nigeria ’s third-
biggest lender by market value, plans to acquire banks in three
African countries before the end of next year, Chief Financial
Officer Bayo Adelabu said.  “We are about to close the deal on one of the target
banks,” Adelabu said in an interview today in Lagos, the
commercial capital, without naming the banks or the countries.
“We will buy majority or total stakes in medium-sized banks”
in the chosen countries.  The lender is also planning to sell Eurobonds to refinance
maturing debt, with the amount and date of issue yet to be
determined, he said.  Under a new licensing rule introduced by regulators, First
Bank adopted the holding company structure, aiming to expand
across 10 sub-Saharan African countries while divesting its
record-keeping business and non-core real estate assets, it
said.  First Bank wasn’t seeking acquisitions in Nigeria after a
failed attempt to buy  Oceanic Bank International Plc (OCEANIC) , one of
eight banks bailed out by the  Central Bank of Nigeria  in 2009,
Adelabu said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
