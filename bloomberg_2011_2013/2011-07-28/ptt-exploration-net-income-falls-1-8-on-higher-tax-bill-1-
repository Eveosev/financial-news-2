PTT Exploration & Production Pcl (PTTEP) ,
 Thailand ’s only publicly traded oil and gas explorer, said
second-quarter profit fell 1.8 percent on higher taxes, beating
the expectations of most analysts.  Net income was 11.2 billion baht ($377 million), or 3.37
baht a share, in the three months ended June, compared with a
revised 11.4 billion baht, or 3.43 baht, a year earlier, the
company said today. The median estimate of eight analysts in a
Bloomberg survey was for profit of 11 billion baht.  The unit of  PTT Pcl (PTT) , the nation’s largest energy group, is
seeking more overseas acquisitions to support growth. Chief
Executive Officer Anon Sirisaengtaksin said last month the
company will invest as much as $60 billion to meet a goal to
produce 900,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2020.  Sales this year may be less than 270,000 barrels of oil
equivalent per day because of delays in the restart of the
Montara project in  Australia , Anon said last month. The company
said today it would pay a dividend of 2.61 baht per share for
the first half of 2011, compared with an interim dividend of
2.55 baht per share a year ago.  PTT Exploration’s corporate tax jumped 54 percent to 10.6
billion baht in the second quarter, according to the statement.
Revenue rose 19 percent to 45 billion baht in the three-month
period, while total expenses increased 19 percent to 22 billion
baht. That excludes financial costs, which rose 32 percent to
957 million baht.  PTT Exploration shares fell 0.5 percent to 184 baht as of
the mid-day break. The stock has gained 9.5 percent this year,
compared with a 9.6 percent advance for the benchmark SET Index.  PTT Exploration started reporting results using U.S.
dollars as its “functional currency” this year. In dollar
terms, net income totaled $370 million for the period, 5.2
percent higher than the same period last year, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
