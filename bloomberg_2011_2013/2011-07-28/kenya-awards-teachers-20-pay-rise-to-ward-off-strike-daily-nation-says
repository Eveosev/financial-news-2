Kenya awarded teachers a 20 percent
pay increase with effect from the end of this month to ward off
a threatened strike, the  Daily Nation  reported, citing Teachers
Service Commission Chairman Ibrahim Hussein.  Following the raise, the lowest-paid teachers in public
schools will earn 13,700 shillings ($150.8) a month, while the
highest paid will receive 120,270 shillings before allowances,
the Nairobi-based newspaper said.  The Kenya National Union of Teachers said on July 11 it
plans to call a strike on Sept. 1 if its demands, including the
hiring of new teachers, arenâ€™t met.  To contact the reporter on this story:
