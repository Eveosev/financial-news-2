Greece  will need a decade to regain
its competitiveness, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble
 Passauer Neue Presse  reported, citing an interview.  “Greece will certainly need a decade to regain its
competitiveness,” the newspaper cited Schaeuble as saying. The
alternative to save the euro would have been “much more risky
and expensive,” he said, according to the newspaper.  Schaueble also said the rescue packages’ conditions “are
tough” and that no country that needs the new aid measures will
get those “as a free ticket,” Passauer reported. There won’t
be any help “without appropriate austerity and structural
programs,” the newspaper cited him as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
