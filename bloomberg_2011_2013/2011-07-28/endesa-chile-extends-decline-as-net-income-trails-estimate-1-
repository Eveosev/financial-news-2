Empresa Nacional de Electricidad SA,
 Chile ’s largest electricity generator, fell after second-quarter
profit slumped 44 percent, more than analysts forecast.  Endesa Chile, as the company is known, dropped 0.5 percent
to 821.16 pesos, extending a decline after the release of
earnings. The stock, which earlier rose as much as 0.2 percent,
was trading at 832 when the financial results were released.  Profit fell to 64.9 billion pesos ($142 million) from 115
billion pesos a year earlier, according to a statement posted on
the Chilean securities regulator’s website. The average profit
estimate of three analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News was 71.4
billion pesos. The company’s controlling shareholder,  Enersis
SA (ENERSIS) , posted net income that was little changed from a year ago.  In the first half of the year, energy purchase costs in
Chile rose 31 percent while operating revenue fell 3.3 percent
as low rainfall forced the company to rely on more expensive
power sources, it said in an e-mailed statement. In  Colombia , a
one-time tax expense and a fall in revenue led to a 15 percent
fall in operating profit in the first half, the statement said.
It didn’t give separate second-quarter commentary.  Enersis, a unit of  Spain ’s Endesa SA, posted second-quarter
net income of 106 billion pesos, little changed from a year
earlier, according to a separate statement on the website of
Chile’s securities regulator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
