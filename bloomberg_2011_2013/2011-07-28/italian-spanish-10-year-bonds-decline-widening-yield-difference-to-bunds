Italian and Spanish 10-year bonds
opened lower, increasing the additional yield investors demand
to hold the securities instead of benchmark German bunds.  The yield on 10-year Italian securities rose six basis
points to 5.82 percent as of 7:38 a.m. in  London . That pushed
the difference in yield, or spread, to 10-year German bonds
eight basis points wider to 319 basis points, the most since
July 19. The yield on Italian two-year notes rose eight basis
points to 4.25 percent.  Spain â€™s 10-year bond yield was three basis points higher at
6 percent, 337 basis points more than the equivalent-maturity
German securities.  Greek and Irish 10-year bonds opened little changed, with
yields at 14.76 percent and 11.17 percent respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
