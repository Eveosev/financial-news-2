Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) , the world’s largest
coffee-shop operator, said third-quarter profit rose 34 percent
as customer traffic increased in the U.S.  Net income in the period ended July 3 climbed to $279.1
million, or 36 cents a share, from $207.9 million, or 27 cents,
a year earlier, the Seattle-based company said today in a
statement. The average estimate of analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was for profit of 34 cents a share.  Chief Executive Officer  Howard Schultz  has sought to boost
sales with single-serve beverages that customers can brew at
home. This year, the company began selling Via instant-coffee
packets in China and partnered with Green Mountain Coffee
Roasters Inc. to make Starbucks brand capsules for  Green
Mountain ’s Keurig brewer.  “ We continue to be on a very, very strong path to Via
being a billion dollar business some years in the future,”
Chief Financial Officer Troy Alstead said in a telephone
interview today. Food, including petite desserts and “Bistro
Boxes” also are “working very well,” he said.  Starbucks said earnings excluding some items in its fiscal
2011 will be as much as $1.51 a share, up from a previous
forecast of as much as $1.48. Analysts predict $1.50.  Starbucks rose 81 cents, or 2 percent, to $40.79 at 4:46
p.m. New York time in trading after the close of the Nasdaq
Stock Market. The shares had gained 24 percent this year through
the close of regular trading today.  Coffee Costs  Starbucks, along with other restaurant operators, has faced
higher ingredient costs during the past year. Higher coffee
costs will reduce fiscal 2012 profit by 21 cents a share, the
company said.  Sales at U.S. stores open at least 13 months advanced 8
percent in the quarter, while international same-store sales
rose 5 percent. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expected gains of
5.3 percent in the U.S. and 4.9 percent abroad.  Revenue advanced 12 percent to $2.93 billion. Analysts had
estimated $2.84 billion.  Starbucks, which gets more than 20 percent of its sales
from outside the U.S., has sought to benefit from  China ’s
growing middle class by accelerating store openings. The coffee
brewer plans to more than triple its store count in mainland
China to 1,500 locations by 2015, Schultz said in April.  The company will open 800 net new stores globally in fiscal
2012, of which about 150 will be in China, Alstead said.
Starbucks has almost 17,000 cafes worldwide, including 10,900 in
the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
