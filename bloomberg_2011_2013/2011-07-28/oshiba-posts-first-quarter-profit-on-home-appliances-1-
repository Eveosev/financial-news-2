Toshiba Corp. (6502) , the world’s second-
largest maker of flash memory chips, posted 470 million yen ($6
million) in quarterly profit, exceeding analyst estimates, on
demand for power systems and home appliances.  Net income in the three months ended June 30 increased from
466 million yen a year earlier, the Tokyo-based company said in
a statement today. Analysts expected a loss of 7 billion yen,
based on the average of five estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Sales of home appliances including air conditioning and LED
lights helped ease damage from  Japan ’s 9-magnitude earthquake
and tsunami in March, the maker of Regza televisions said.  The company kept its annual forecasts unchanged.  To contact the reporter on this story:
