Canadian stocks fell for a fourth
day as energy companies including  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU) ,  Talisman
Energy Inc. (TLM)  and Imperial Oil Ltd. missed analysts’ earnings
estimates and  Goldcorp Inc. (G)  cut its gold-production forecast.  Suncor,  Canada ’s largest oil and gas producer, dropped 1.4
percent after its second-quarter profit trailed the average
estimate in a Bloomberg survey by 7.2 percent, excluding certain
items. Goldcorp, the world’s second-biggest gold producer by
market value, lost 3.6 percent. Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan
Inc., the world’s largest fertilizer producer by market value,
gained 2.7 percent after beating analysts’ average earnings
estimate.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index slipped 49.85
points, or 0.4 percent, to 12,982.82 at 9:35 a.m. in Toronto.  The stock benchmark sank 3 percent in the previous two
sessions, the most for a two-day period in almost 13 months, as
U.S. lawmakers fought over rival plans to raise the country’s
debt ceiling and that country reported a decline in durable-
goods orders. Seventy-five percent of Canadian exports went to
the U.S. last year, according to  Statistics Canada .  To contact the reporter on this story:
