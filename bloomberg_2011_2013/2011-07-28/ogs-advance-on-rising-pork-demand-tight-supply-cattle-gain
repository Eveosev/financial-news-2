Hog futures rose for the first time
this week on signs of climbing demand for U.S. pork amid
tightening supplies. Cattle prices also gained.  Yesterday, spot-market hogs rose 1.6 percent to a five-week
high of 99.35 cents a pound, and wholesale-pork prices climbed 1
percent to $1.0234 a pound, the highest since at least October
1997, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.  “The cash market has been super strong,” Ryan Turner, a
risk-management consultant at FCStone Group Inc. in  Kansas City ,
 Missouri , said in a telephone interview. “The pork-product
supply is really tight, and the values are really high.”  Hog futures for October settlement rose 0.275 cent, or 0.3
percent, to 91.7 cents a pound at 9:50 a.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. Before today, the commodity advanced 20
percent in the past year.  Cattle futures for October delivery climbed 0.475 cent, or
0.4 percent, to $1.15925 a pound in Chicago. Before today, the
price jumped 23 percent in the past 12 months.  Wholesale beef rose 0.6 percent to $1.7573 a pound
yesterday, the first gain since July 18, government data show.
In the four weeks ended July 21, U.S. beef exports rose 48
percent from a year earlier, the USDA said today.  “Beef-export sales were very good again,” Troy Vetterkind, the owner of Vetterkind Cattle Brokerage in  Chicago ,
said in an e-mailed report. “This should be supportive.”  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement dropped 0.15
cent, or 0.1 percent, to $1.35225 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
