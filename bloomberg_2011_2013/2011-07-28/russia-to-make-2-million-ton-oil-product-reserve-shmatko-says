Russia plans to create an oil
product reserve of roughly 2 million metric tons, mainly of
winter diesel, Energy Minister Sergei Shmatko said.  The fuel may be stored at gas-fired power plants, which
previously ran on fuel oil and where there is storage for as
much as 3 million tons, he told reporters in Moscow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
