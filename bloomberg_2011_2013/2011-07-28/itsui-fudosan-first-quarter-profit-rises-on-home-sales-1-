Mitsui Fudosan Co.,  Japan ’s biggest
developer, said first-quarter net income rose 44 percent as the
company earned more from houses and apartments following the
country’s strongest earthquake on March 11.  Net income rose to 6.47 billion yen ($83 million) in the
three months ended June 30 from 4.49 billion yen in the same
period a year earlier, the company said in a statement
distributed through the Tokyo Stock Exchange today. Sales
dropped 1.3 percent to 279.1 billion yen.  Mitsui Fudosan’s earnings have been helped by housing
demand. The company sold 26 percent more houses and apartments
in the quarter from a year earlier on demand after the quake,
according to the statement.  The Tokyo-based company left its net income forecast of 47
billion yen unchanged for the year ending March 31, 2012, on
sales of 1.4 trillion yen.  For the quarter, operating profit from leasing, the
company’s biggest division, gained 2.2 percent to 24 billion yen
as the vacancy rate for its office and commercial buildings
dropped to 3.3 percent in June from 3.5 percent in March.  Operating profit from the second-biggest division
comprising of housing, office buildings and land sales, was 3.3
billion yen from a loss of 2 billion yen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
