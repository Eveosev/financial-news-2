South African mutual funds had the
lowest inflows in three years in the second quarter because of a
proposed change in the way dividend-income funds are taxed, the
Association for Savings and Investment  South Africa  said.  Mutual funds attracted net inflows of 4 billion rand ($598
million) in the three months through June, the least since the
first quarter of 2008, most of which is income that had been re-
invested, the Cape Town-based industry organization said in an
e-mailed statement. Without the reinvested income, there would
have been a net outflow of 5 billion rand in the quarter, it
said.  “The recently released 2011 Draft Taxation Laws Amendment
Bill indicated that the tax loophole would soon close for
Dividend Income Funds, causing investors to exit these funds,”
association Chief Executive Officer Leon Campher said, according
to the statement.  South  Africa ’s central bank has maintained its key lending
rate at 5.5 percent, the lowest in 30 years, since November to
spur growth in Africa’s largest economy. A debt crisis in  Europe 
and in the U.S. is fuelling recession concern and has increased
market volatility, with the JSE Ltd.’s South African Volatility
Index, a daily measure of annualized three-month implied
volatility on the 40 biggest companies on the exchange, rising
for two consecutive quarters.  Money-market funds posted net outflows of 9.9 billion rand
for the quarter, the biggest among all funds, as corporate
investors withdrew cash.  “This is not necessarily a bad thing since these
corporates may well have ring-fenced this money for development
projects or other investment opportunities,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
