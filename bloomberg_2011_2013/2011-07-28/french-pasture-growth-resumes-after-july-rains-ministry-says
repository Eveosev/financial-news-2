French grassland growth resumed in
the country’s east after July rains, which should ensure
sufficient grass production for pastured herds, the country’s
 Agriculture Ministry  said.  Forage losses caused by spring drought are “very big” in
more than a third of  France  and will be difficult to make up for
through summer and autumn growth, the ministry said in a  report 
on its website today. As of July 20, cumulative grass production
was 60 percent of normal levels, it said.  France had its second-hottest April since 1900, and soils
in the country’s northern half were the driest in 50 years at
the end of that month, according to the government. Lack of
grass growth forced livestock breeders to buy forage for cattle
and sheep that typically rely on grazing from spring to autumn.  “Thanks to the rains of the past weeks, the reprisal of
growth should be sufficient to satisfy the needs of herds in
pasture,” the ministry said. “Due to the spring losses, forage
stocks are greatly insufficient and livestock breeders will have
to reconstitute them through external buying.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
