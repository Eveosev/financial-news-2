Yandex NV, operator of the most
popular Russian search engine, said second-quarter revenue
jumped 57 percent on higher ad sales, outpacing profit as costs
climbed.  Sales climbed to 4.54 billion rubles ($164 million) from
2.89 billion rubles a year earlier, the U.S.-listed company said
in materials handed out before a briefing in Moscow today. Net
income rose 11 percent to 1.13 billion rubles in the period,
while operating costs jumped 81 percent to 3.16 billion rubles.  The company first sold shares to the public in May in one
of the biggest technology initial public offerings of the year,
raising $1.3 billion. Online advertising in  Russia  climbed 51
percent in two years through 2010, reaching 26.65 billion
rubles, according to the Moscow-based Association of
Communication Agencies.  Russia is the second-largest European base of  Internet
users  after  Germany , the  Boston Consulting Group  said in a
report released May 19.  Yandex rose $1.06, or 2.8 percent, to $38.51 in Nasdaq
Stock Market trading yesterday. The company gained 54 percent
since its IPO before today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
