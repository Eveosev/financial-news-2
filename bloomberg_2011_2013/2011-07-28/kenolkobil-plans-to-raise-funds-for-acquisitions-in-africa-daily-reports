KenolKobil Ltd. will raise as much
as 1.5 billion shillings ($16.5 million) through the sale of
promissory notes to help fund acquisitions in five African
nations, Business Daily reported.  The sale of the notes was approved last month, the Nairobi-
based newspaper said, citing Patrick Kondo, the company’s
mergers and acquisitions manager. KenolKobil plans to enter
 Namibia , the  Democratic Republic of Congo , Mozambique, Malawi
and Botswana amid plans to reduces the company’s reliance on its
Kenyan operations, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
