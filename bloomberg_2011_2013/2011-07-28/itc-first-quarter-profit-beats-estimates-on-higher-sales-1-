ITC Ltd. (ITC) ,  Asia ’s second-largest
cigarette maker by value, reported first-quarter profit gain of
24 percent that beat analysts’ estimates on higher sales.  Net income increased to 13.3 billion rupees ($301 million)
in the three months ended June 30, from 10.7 billion rupees a
year earlier, the Kolkata-based company said in a statement
today. This exceeds the 12.9 billion rupees average of 17
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Sales for the maker of Wills cigarettes and Fiama di Wills
shampoo, which is backed by British American Tobacco Plc, grew
19.7 percent to 57.7 billion rupees as rising salaries and
increased spending in the world’s second-most populous nation
encouraged consumption of personal care products and cigarettes.  “ITC is able to pass costs on to customers because its
product mix is stronger compared with the competitors, which
gives them an edge in terms of volume,” said Mehul Desai, a
Mumbai-based analyst with K.R. Choksey Shares and Securities
Pvt. “The loyalty of the customer is higher in case of ITC.”  ITC’s shares gained 2.7 percent, the most since July 7, to
206.25 rupees at the 3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai.  India ’s
benchmark sensitive index declined 1.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
