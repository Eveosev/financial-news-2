Russian farmers started harvesting
sugar beets in the southern Krasnodar region and will begin
refining at 14 plants in the middle of August, the country’s
Sugar Producers’ Union  said .  Farmers had reaped 401 metric tons of beets by July 26 in
Krasnodar, where 212,500 hectares (525,000 acres) were sown with
the crop this year, the union said today on its website. That
was an 8.2 percent increase from a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
