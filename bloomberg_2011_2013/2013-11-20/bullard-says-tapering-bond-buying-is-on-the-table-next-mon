President  James Bullard , a voter on policy this year who has
backed record stimulus, said that a strong jobs report could
increase the chance of a reduction in bond purchases next month.  “It’s definitely on the table, but it’s going to depend on
the data,” Bullard said in a Bloomberg Television interview
with  Erik Schatzker . “A strong jobs report, I think, would
increase the probability some for a December taper.”  When asked how he would quantify strong, Bullard said,
“I’m going to leave it at strong.”  The  Federal Open Market Committee  plans to press on with
$85 billion in monthly bond buying until seeing substantial
improvement in the outlook for the labor market. While U.S.
employers last month added 204,000 workers, the Fed probably
won’t  taper  its purchases until a March 18-19 policy meeting,
according to the median of 32 economist estimates in a Bloomberg
News survey Nov. 8. The next meeting is Dec. 17-18.  Bullard also said he doesn’t anticipate that financial
markets will react dramatically to a discussion of tapering.  “If we taper because we see a stronger economy, I think
the markets will swallow that without a problem,” he said. “In
the summer, we were talking about tapering but the data wasn’t
coming in very well.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
