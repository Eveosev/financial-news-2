Philip Morris International Inc., (PM) 
the world’s largest publicly traded tobacco company, said its
per-share profit would grow more slowly next year than its long-term target as shipments to Europe and  Russia  shrink.  Per-share profit excluding currency swings will grow 6
percent to 8 percent in 2014, the New York-based maker of
Marlboro cigarettes said today in a statement. Its long-term
target is for 10 percent to 12 percent growth, it said.  International cigarette volume may drop 2 percent to 3
percent next year, with declines of as much as 8 percent and 11
percent in the EU region and Russia, respectively, it said. The
company will provide precise profit guidance in February.  Philip Morris  fell 2.4 percent to $89.30 at the close in
New York, for the biggest drop since September. The shares have
advanced 6.8 percent this year compared with a 25 percent  gain 
for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
