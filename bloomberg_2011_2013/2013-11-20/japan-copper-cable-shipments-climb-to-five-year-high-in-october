Japan ’s copper wire and cable
shipments expanded 11 percent in October to the highest level in
five years as demand from home and overseas markets increased,
said an industry group.  Shipments totaled 66,400 metric tons last month, compared
with 60,046 tons a year earlier, the Japanese Electric Wire &
Cable Makers’ Association said today in a statement, citing
preliminary data. Deliveries were 59,969 tons in September, up 4
percent from a year earlier.  Japan’s total exports grew 18.6 percent in October,
exceeding the median estimate of 16.2 percent in a Bloomberg
survey. The nation posted its biggest October trade deficit on
record after costs for imported fuel surged in the wake of the
nuclear industry’s shutdown. Imports climbed 26.1 percent.  “The shipments were the highest since October 2008 as
exports rose and demand from main domestic industries
increased,” said Keiichi Ohki, an official at the association’s
research department.  The yen’s slide against the dollar has boosted profit
forecasts of exporters such as Toyota Motor Corp. The Japanese
currency has weakened 13 percent this year.  Copper wire and cable shipments to the construction
industry climbed 13 percent, with deliveries to automakers up 12
percent and 11 percent higher to power companies, according to
the statement. Exports jumped 25 percent, it said.  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange rose 0.4 percent to $6,997.25 a ton at 12:24 p.m. in
 Tokyo , bringing this year’s losses to 12 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
