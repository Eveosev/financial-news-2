Chris Christie ’s second-term
economic agenda includes reviving his proposal for a 10 percent
across-the board income-tax cut, said  Robert Grady , chairman of
the New Jersey governor’s Council of Economic Advisors.  The Republican governor, who won re-election on Nov. 5,
also plans to complete the phase-in of business-tax cuts, Grady
said today at an economic forum in Trenton. Christie also plans
to push for an expansion of school choice, merit pay and charter
schools, and for passage of the rest of a 20-bill “tool kit”
aimed at helping municipalities control property-tax growth,
Grady said.  “We’re at the point where the economy has stabilized
enough and is healthy enough that it really is time to consider
giving tax relief across the board -- not only to improve our
standing, but it will help our competitiveness and actually
assist in both  job creation , business retention and business
attraction,” Grady told the audience at Thomas Edison State
College.  To contact the reporter on this story:
