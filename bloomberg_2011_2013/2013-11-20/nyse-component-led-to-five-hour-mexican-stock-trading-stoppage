(Corrects company name in third paragraph.)  Mexico ’s five-hour stock trading
stoppage yesterday was caused partly by a connection failure
with a component bought from a unit of NYSE Euronext, said Luis Tellez, chief executive officer of the country’s exchange.  The exchange had to halt transactions from 8:54 a.m. to
1:52 p.m. Mexico City time yesterday to resolve a communication
error, Tellez told reporters today at the stock exchange. NYSE
Euronext advised the exchange to reprocess all the data from the
opening hour of trading, according to Tellez.  The trading stoppage was at least the fifth since mid-April
and follows Bolsa Mexicana de Valores SAB’s installation of an
internally-developed processing engine in 2012 to increase
transaction speeds.  “What the Bolsa has developed hasn’t caused failures,”
Tellez said. “It’s the auxiliary pieces that we have
purchased.”  IntercontinentalExchange Group Inc. bought NYSE Euronext
this month, and yesterday said it plans to sell technology
businesses owned by the acquired company.  Eric Ryan, NYSE spokesman, said he couldn’t immediately
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
