Everett Golson, who was suspended by
the University of Notre Dame after starting 11 games last
season, submitted an application to return to the school,
football coach  Brian Kelly  said.  Kelly said at a  news conference  that admissions decisions
are made mid-December. The Irish finish their season Nov. 30 at
Stanford and Golson, if re-admitted, would be eligible to
practice with the team ahead of a postseason bowl game, though
he wouldnâ€™t be permitted to play.  Notre Dame has a  7-3 record , a year after starting 12-0
under Golson before losing to the University of Alabama in the
Bowl Championship Series title game.  Four months later, the South Bend, Indiana-based university
suspended Golson for poor academic judgment, without being
specific about the nature of his mistakes. Golson, 20,  told
Sports Illustrated  last month that he had cheated on a test.
Senior Tommy Rees has started at quarterback for  Notre Dame  this
