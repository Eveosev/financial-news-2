SunEdison Inc. (SUNE) , the solar developer
and polysilicon supplier formerly known as MEMC Electronic
Materials Inc., received $100.4 million in loans from Overseas
Private Investment Corp. and the World Bank Group to build a
power plant in northern Chile.  OPIC, the U.S. government’s development finance
institution, provided $62.9 million in debt financing and the
World Bank’s IFC unit contributed $37.5 million, St. Peters,

market, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
