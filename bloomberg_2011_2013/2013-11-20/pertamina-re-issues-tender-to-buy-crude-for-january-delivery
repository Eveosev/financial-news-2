PT Pertamina re-issued a tender to
buy 950,000 barrels of crude for Jan. 7 to Jan. 9 delivery to
its  Cilacap refinery  in Java, according to a company official.
Offers are due tomorrow.  Indonesia ’s state-owned oil company didn’t award its recent
tender, which closed Nov. 18, said the official, who asked not
to be identified because he isn’t authorized to speak to the
media. He didn’t provide details.  Jakarta-based Pertamina most recently bought 600,000
barrels each of Brunei’s Champion and Seria Light grades for its
Balikpapan refinery in East Kalimantan and 950,000 barrels of
Nigeria’s Qua Iboe for Cilacap, all for January delivery.  To contact the reporter on this story:
