People who experience multiple
economic recessions in mid-life may be at higher risk of
cognitive decline, according to a study published in the Journal
of Epidemiology and  Community Health .  Men who didn’t live through any recession in their mid- to
late 40s had an average cognitive score of negative 0.07 at ages
50 to 74, compared with a score of negative 0.12 for those who
experienced four or more recessions, according to an analysis of
data from 12,000 people in 11 European countries. The research,
 published  today, was led by Anja Leist, a post-doctoral research
fellow at the University of Luxembourg.  Cognitive decline may result from lay-offs, enforced part-time work, and the need to take salary cuts and accept lower-status work, according to the authors. The research adds to a
separate study that showed that  being born during a recession  is
significantly linked to lower later-life cognitive function.  “Our findings suggest that potentially unanticipated
macroeconomic shocks during vulnerable periods in mid-life may
affect an individual’s potential to accumulate cognitive
reserve,” the authors said in the paper.  Cognitive function was assessed through tests on verbal
fluency, immediate recall, delayed recall, orientation and
arithmetic.  The research also suggests that policies that encourage
women to enter and remain in the job market through early
adulthood and mid-adulthood, and policies that enable men to
return to work or remain engaged in productive activities during
the late stages of their career may bring benefits to cognitive
functioning in older age, they said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
