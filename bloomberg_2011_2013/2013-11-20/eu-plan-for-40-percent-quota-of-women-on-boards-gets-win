European Union companies may soon be
forced to favor women over equally-qualified men for supervisory
board seats after EU lawmakers backed draft rules that would
impose a 40 percent quota for female directors.  The European Parliament in Strasbourg,  France , today voted
with 459 votes in favor of the draft law, 148 votes against and
81 abstentions. To become law, the plans still need the backing
of EU members states.  The European Commission, the EU’s executive authority,
proposed the new law last year to make boards two-fifths female
by 2020. EU Justice Commissioner  Viviane Reding  called today’s
vote a “historic moment for  gender equality .”  In 2013, 17.6 percent of non-executive board members of the
EU’s largest companies were women,  according  to the commission.
The European Parliament’s push for more female candidates in top
posts almost scuppered the appointment of Luxembourg’s Yves Mersch to the European Central Bank’s Executive Board last year.
Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann earlier this year said he
won’t set a quota to promote women into management in the German
central bank.  The measures would apply to about 5,000 listed companies in
the EU by 2020 and state-owned companies by 2018, the commission
said last year. They exclude companies with less than 250
employees or global sales below 50 million euros ($67.6
million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
