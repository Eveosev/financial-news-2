The U.S. may be able to delay a
debt-limit increase until as late as June 2014, the
Congressional Budget Office  said today .  Under an agreement reached last month, Congress suspended
the  debt limit  through Feb. 7, 2014. After that, the Treasury
Department will be able to use so-called extraordinary measures
to stave off default, such as suspending investments of a
retirement fund.  Income tax receipts increasing around the April 15 tax-filing deadline may provide enough revenue to meet scheduled
payments as late as June, the CBO said.  “Given the volume of the government’s daily cash flows and
the uncertainty about the magnitude of key transactions during
those months, the Treasury could exhaust its extraordinary
measures and authority to borrow as early as March or as late as
May or June,” the CBO report said today.  The Bipartisan Policy Center estimated last month that the
extraordinary measures would be exhausted between the end of
February and late March.  Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said yesterday that the
extraordinary measures would last for about a month. One unknown
issue is how the date will be affected by the Internal Revenue
Service’s delay of the start of the tax filing season because of
the government shutdown. That would push more refunds into the
period after Feb. 7.  Congress came close to exhausting U.S. borrowing authority
in August 2011 and again in October 2013. In 2011, lawmakers
reached a bipartisan agreement to cut spending. This year, the
debt-limit standoff ended with minimal policy changes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
