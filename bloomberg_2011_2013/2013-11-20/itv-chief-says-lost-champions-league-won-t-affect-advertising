ITV Plc (ITV)  said that losing broadcast
rights for two of  Europe ’s soccer leagues to  BT Group Plc (BT/A)  won’t
hurt advertising and the 299 million-pound ($483 million) price
per season was too high.  “We’re very clear-eyed about what sport does for us and
over the years we have a very sophisticated model to decide the
value,” Chief Executive Officer Adam Crozier said today at an
investor conference in Barcelona. “We got to the level where it
didn’t make financial sense.”  The owner of the U.K.’s biggest commercial TV station will
reinvest in other “high-quality content,” Crozier said. The
UEFA Champions League and Europa League games that BT won this
month typically represent less than 1 percent of viewing. Other
programs can achieve that at a fraction of the cost, he said.  “I’m confident that we can replace it,” Crozier said at
the event organized by Morgan Stanley. “I don’t think it will
affect our advertising performance.”  BT Sports will replace British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc’s
Sky Sports and London-based ITV in broadcasting the 350 matches.
The rights run for three seasons from 2015. This is the first
time a U.K. broadcaster has won exclusive rights to all matches
for both tournaments, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
