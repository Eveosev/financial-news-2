New Zealand’s dollar is diverging
from global investor sentiment by the most in six years as
central bank Governor Graeme Wheeler pushes home-loan curbs to
give him flexibility on interest rates.  The 240-day correlation between the MSCI All-Country World
Index of shares and the New Zealand dollar’s trade-weighted
gauge was at 0.22 after sliding to 0.21 last week, the lowest
since July 2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
Australian dollar remained higher following a three-day gain
after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said the
benchmark rate will probably stay low once the central bank’s
asset purchases end.  “Even as the Fed starts to scale down quantitative easing,
New Zealand is more likely to be ahead of the U.S. and other
nations when it comes to a rate hike,” said Takuya Kawabata, a
Tokyo-based analyst at Gaitame.com Research Institute Ltd., a
unit of  Japan ’s largest currency-margin company. “The N.Z.
economy is resilient.”  The kiwi dollar rose 0.1 percent to 83.76 U.S. cents at
11:30 a.m. in Sydney. The Aussie was little changed at 94.34
U.S. cents after gaining 1.3 percent in the past three days.  The correlation between the kiwi and the stock gauge has
averaged 0.42 since 2007 with the highest at 0.55 in August
2012. A figure of 1 means they move in lock step.  To contact the reporter on this story:
