(Corrects to remove reference to distributions related to Tile Shop Holdings Inc. offering in eighth paragraph of a story originally published Nov. 20.)  J.W. Childs Associates LP, the owner of consumer-focused businesses such as Brookstone and Sunny Delight Beverages Co., is considering giving investors who have been locked in a fund raised more than a decade ago an option to cash out, two people familiar with the matter said.  The firm, which is based in  Boston , has selected Park Hill Group LLC, the placement-agent arm of Blackstone Group LP, to advise on a structured deal for J.W. Childs Equity Partners III LP, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. The structure and size of a possible arrangement hasn’t been decided yet.  J.W. Childs is joining a growing number of private-equity firms in giving investors in older funds the option of selling their stakes or rolling them into new vehicles with extended lives and new terms. New York-based Veronis Suhler Stevenson is shopping the remaining investments in a buyout fund from 1999, three people familiar with the matter said in October. Last year, Chicago-based Willis Stein & Partners gave clients the choice of selling their interests in its 2000 fund or shifting them into a new pool.  Limited partners have long griped about paying management fees to private-equity firms that sit on investments far past the typical 10-year life of their funds. The clients say the practice skews the alignment of interests between investors and the fund company, especially if there’s little or no chance of generating a profit on the investments.  Capital Raising  Philip Nunes, a spokesman for J.W. Childs at BackBay Communications Inc., said the firm didn’t respond to a request for comment.  J.W. Childs hasn’t raised a fund since gathering $1.75 billion for its third vehicle in 2002. It abandoned efforts to raise a successor fund in 2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The third fund, which holds stakes in five remaining companies, is valued at about $1 billion, the people said. Its investments include Sunny Delight, Mattress Firm Holding Corp., retailer Brookstone, office products maker Esselte and WS Packaging Group Inc. The fund was producing a multiple of about 1.4 times invested capital as of March 31, according to a quarterly report by  Switzerland ’s Castle Private Equity AG, an investor.  John W. Childs and Adam Suttin founded the firm in 1995. Childs came from  Thomas H. Lee Partners , where he was a senior managing director. The firm primarily invests in consumer products and specialty retail businesses. It has invested more than $3 billion in 40 platform companies since its inception, according to an August press release.
