Dan Dierdorf said he’s retiring from
 CBS Sports  after 30 years as a broadcaster, the longest tenure
among National Football League television analysts.  Dierdorf, 64, got into broadcasting after a 13-year NFL
playing career as an offensive lineman with the St. Louis
Cardinals. A six-time Pro Bowl selection, he was inducted into
the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1996 and was the 2008 recipient
of its Pete Rozelle Radio-Television Award for long-time
contributions to the sport.  Dierdorf joined CBS radio in 1984 and spent 12 years on
ABC’s “Monday Night Football” telecasts before rejoining CBS
in 1999.  “Very few people in any profession can boast a Hall of
Fame playing career and Hall of Fame broadcasting career,” CBS
Sports Chairman  Sean McManus  said in a statement. “Dan, without
question, is one of them.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
