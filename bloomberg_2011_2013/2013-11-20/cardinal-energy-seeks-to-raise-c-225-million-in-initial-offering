Cardinal Energy Ltd., a producer of
oil in  Alberta , filed with regulators to sell about C$225
million ($215 million) of stock in what would be  Canada ’s
largest energy initial public offering in seven months.  Cardinal Energy expects to sell 21.4 million to 22.5
million shares in its IPO, the Calgary-based company said in a
Nov. 18 regulatory filing. The shares will be offered for C$10
to C$10.50 apiece in a sale led by Royal Bank of Canada and
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.  The energy producer will use the proceeds to help pay for a
C$210 million acquisition of oil-and-gas properties in southeast
Alberta, the filing said. Cardinal Energy said it began
operations in May 2012 with the goal of building a dividend-paying, oil-focused company. The firm plans to pay an annual
dividend of 65 cents a share, disbursed monthly, according to
the filing.  Cardinal Energy, led by Chief Executive Officer Scott Ratushny, is targeting annual production growth of 5 percent to
10 percent, the firm said.  The company currently produces the equivalent of 5,800
barrels of oil a day, it said in the filing. Including the
assets it is acquiring in southeast Alberta, daily output would
have amounted to 6,275 barrels for the nine months ended Sept.
30.  Cardinal Energy is purchasing the assets from  Penn West
Petroleum Ltd. (PWT)  in a deal expected to be completed this year, a
person familiar with the sale said last week, requesting
anonymity because the plans weren’t public. Ratushny didn’t
immediately return a telephone message seeking comment.  Oryx Petroleum Corp. Ltd. raised C$250.5 million from its
May 9 sale, the largest Canadian energy IPO this year. The
Calgary-based firm’s stock has fallen 6.4 percent since its
trading debut.  To contact the reporter on this story:
