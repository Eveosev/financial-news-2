Chris Kermode will take over as the
head of the men’s tennis tour next year after overseeing the
season-ending ATP event in  London  since 2008.  The retired British player and former tournament director
of the grass-court Queen’s Club event will get a three-year
contract as president and executive chairman of the men’s tour.
The ATP World Tour Finals has brought in more than 1.28 million
fans to The O2 arena in London in the past five years.  “It’s a huge honor to have been given the opportunity to
lead the ATP during what is unquestionably one of the most
exciting periods in the history of men’s professional tennis,”
Kermode said in the ATP statement.  Kermode, 48, was a unanimous choice by the ATP Board of
Directors. He worked as a tennis professional and then as a
coach. He also held positions in the film and music industries,
including starting his own promotion and events company, before
returning to tennis.  The 48-year-old replaces Brad Drewett, a 54-year-old
Australian who left the ATP in January before succumbing to
motor neurone disease in May.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
