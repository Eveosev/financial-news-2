Rubber climbed for the first time in
three days as car sales rose in  Europe  and Japan’s currency
weakened after the Asian nation’s trade deficit widened more
than expected.  The contract for delivery in April on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange climbed as much as 1 percent to 261 yen a kilogram
($2,608 a metric ton) and traded at 259.5 yen at 10:28 a.m.
local time.  European new car sales rose 4.6 percent in October, marking
the first consecutive monthly gain since 2011, data showed
yesterday. The yen dropped to 100.22 a dollar, nearing a two-month low, as Japan’s  trade deficit  expanded to 1.09 trillion
yen last month, extending a record run of shortfalls to 16
months. A weaker yen boosts the appeal of yen-based futures.  “The car sales increase added to expectations that rubber
demand will keep expanding,” said  Kazuhiko Saito , an analyst at
broker Fujitomi Co. in Tokyo.  Japan’s imports climbed 26.1 percent from a year earlier,
while exports gained 18.6 percent. The yen’s slide against the
dollar has boosted profit forecasts of exporters such as Toyota
Motor Corp.  Rubber for May delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
gained 0.5 percent to 19,330  yuan  ($3,172) a ton. Stockpiles
monitored by the bourse expanded 6.1 percent to 163,604 tons
last week, the highest level since November 2004.  Thai rubber free-on-board lost 0.3 percent to 78.35 baht
($2.47) a kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research
Institute of  Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
