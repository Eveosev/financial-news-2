Antofagasta Plc (ANTO) , the copper company
controlled by  Chile ’s billionaire Luksic family, predicts global
supply and demand will remain in balance longer than previously
thought on project delays and an increase in orders.  The copper market’s move into surplus estimated by the end
of this year probably won’t happen until the second half of next
year, Chief Executive Officer  Diego Hernandez  said yesterday in
an interview in Santiago. Chinese manufacturers are building
their stocks of copper at current prices, he said.  “Some of the projects that will come into production will
take a little longer,” he said. “That’s one factor. The other
is because of rebuilding inventories or increasing consumption,
we have seen slightly more purchases of copper on the market.”  Copper demand probably will continue to grow an average 3
percent to 3.5 percent in the coming years, underpinned by
Chinese urbanization, and a lack of new mining projects will
eradicate the market surplus from 2016, Hernandez said.  He declined to give an estimate on copper prices.  Antofagasta rose 4 pence, or 0.5 percent, to 809 pence at
2:25 p.m. in  London . The shares have slumped 6 percent this year
as the metal’s price lost 12 percent on increasing supplies.  The global supply of mined copper will expand at least 4
percent annually from 2012 to 2016, Standard Bank Plc said in a
report in October, compared with less than 1 percent in four of
the six years through 2012.  Warehouse Declines  Inventories of the metal used in electrical wire held in
London Metal Exchange monitored warehouses have declined more
than 30 percent since June, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Copper futures for March delivery rose 0.4 to $3.18 a pound
at 9:37 a.m. on the Comex in  New York .  State-owned Codelco started its Ministro Hales mine in
Chile’s Atacama Desert this month. London-based Rio Tinto Group
started its Oyu Tolgoi mine in  Mongolia  earlier this year.  Antofagasta plans to produce 700,000 metric tons of copper
this year, compared with 709,600 tons in 2012, Hernandez said in
an Aug. 27 interview. The Santiago-based miner whose shares
trade in London is investing $1.9 billion to start its Antucoya
mine in Chile in 2015. With Antucoya partner  Marubeni Corp. (8002) ,
Antofagasta secured $650 million in loans Nov. 6 from a group of
banks including Japan Bank for International Cooperation and
Export Development  Canada .  The Luksic Group owns about 65 percent of Antofagasta,
which also has railroad and water assets in the Atacama Desert.
The company stems from the Antofagasta Railway Co. listed in
London in 1888. Hernandez, 65, was previously CEO of Codelco.  To contact the reporter on this story:
