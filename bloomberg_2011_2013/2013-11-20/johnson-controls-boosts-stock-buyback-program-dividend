Johnson Controls Inc. (JCI) , the largest
U.S. auto-parts maker, rose to its highest since at least 1980
after saying it will boost a stock-buyback program by $3 billion
on greater confidence in its outlook for fiscal 2014 and beyond.  The  shares  gained 7.2 percent to $51.69 at 10:40 a.m. in
 New York  after climbing to $51.90, the intraday peak in data
compiled by Bloomberg that go back to July 1980. The stock had
advanced 57 percent this year through yesterday, as the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index rose 25 percent.  Johnson Controls’ total share-repurchase authorization is
now $3.65 billion, according to a statement yesterday. The
Milwaukee-based company said it has bought back $400 million of
shares so far this fiscal year and will purchase $800 million of
its stock from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The rest of the
authorization is to be used during fiscal 2015 and 2016.  The auto-parts and building-controls company also raised
its quarterly dividend by 16 percent to 22 cents a share. The
payment will be made Jan. 6 to shareholders of record as of
Dec. 16.  “We have a strong balance sheet and are committed to
disciplined capital allocation, giving us the capacity to
continue investing in our businesses while meaningfully
increasing the cash we return to our shareholders,” Chief
Executive Officer Alex Molinaroli said in the statement.   To contact the reporter on this story:
