Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
Shanghai climbed as inventory in China fell to the lowest level
in more than two years.  Rebar for May delivery, the most-active contract on the
Shanghai Futures Exchange, rose as much as 0.8 percent to 3,651
 yuan  ($599) and traded at 3,646 yuan at 10:50 a.m. local time.  Rebar  inventory  tracked by the Shanghai Steelhome
Information Technology Co. fell for the fifth week last week to
5.3 million tons, the lowest since Jan. 14, 2011.  “The scope of the reduction in traders’ inventory helped
offset higher output from mills,” said Wang Yongliang, an
analyst at Beijing Cifco Futures Co. in Tianjin.  Iron ore  for May delivery on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange 
was little changed at 943 yuan a ton.  Iron ore  for immediate
delivery at Tianjin port tracked by The Steel Index fell 0.5
percent yesterday to $136.30 a dry ton.  Rebar for immediate delivery tracked by Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co. was little changed yesterday at
3,538 yuan a ton.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
