 U.S. stocks trimmed gains as
Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President  James Bullard  said a
reduction in bond buying is “on the table” for the central
bank’s next policy meeting.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was up 0.2 percent at
1,790.53 at 10:42 a.m. in New York after earlier rallying as
much as 0.4 percent after the European Central Bank was said to
consider a negative deposit rate.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
