U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron
said he wants to see women bishops jump the queue for places in
the House of Lords as the Church of  England ’s ruling body backed
proposals to create them for the first time.  There are places for 26 bishops in the unelected upper
chamber of Parliament. These go to the Archbishops of Canterbury
and York, and the bishops of Durham, London and Winchester. The
other 21 places are allocated to the bishops who have held
office longest.  Asked during his weekly Prime Minister’s Questions session
if he wanted to see female bishops in the Lords faster than the
current system allowed, Cameron agreed.  “The government is willing to work with the church to see
how we can get women bishops into the Lords as soon as
possible,” Cameron told lawmakers in the House of Commons.  The General Synod of the Church  of England today voted 378
to eight in favor of introducing women bishops, alongside
guidance for parishes that reject them.  To contact the reporter on this story:
